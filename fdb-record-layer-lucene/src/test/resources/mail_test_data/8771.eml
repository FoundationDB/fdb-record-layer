for parole and the diminution of your sentence which the law allows:     1. Your first duty is strict 

obedience to all rules and regulations and       any orders of the officer under whose charge you 

may be placed.    2. You must observe strict silence in all departments of the prison and       while 

marching through the yard.    3. You must not speak to, give or receive from visitors anything 

except       by permission of the Warden or Deputy Warden. Gazing at visitors or       strangers 

passing through the prison is strictly forbidden.    4. You are expected to apply yourself diligently at 

whatever labor you       are assigned, and, after reasonable teaching, to perform the same 

amount of work as would be required from you as a citizen.    5. At every signal to fall in for 

marching take your place in line       promptly. March with military step, attend to and promptly 

obey the       orders of your officer.    6. You will be required to keep your person clean and your 

clothing       tidy and in good order. You must not make any alterations in your       clothing or cut 

your shoes; if they do not fit or need repairs       report the fact to your officer. You must not carry 

knives, tools of       any kind, pencil, paper or any material whatever from your shop to       your cell 

without permission in writing from the Warden or Deputy       Warden. Finding these things in your 

possession will be considered       proof that you have violated this rule. Tinkering or writing notes 

to other convicts or carrying notes from one convict to another is       strictly forbidden.    7. You 

are not allowed to have any money on your person or in your       possession, neither are you 

permitted to trade or purchase any       article whatever. All of your business must be done through 

the       Warden.    8. Snipe, should be served with the same Sauces that are used for Partridges. 

The Sauces in his Directions are within a trifle the same as those I have already set down in 

_September_ for Partridges or Quails, so that I shall not repeat them here.  The Truffle, which I 

have treated of at large as to its manner of Growth and Season of Maturity, in my _Gentleman and 

Farmer's Monthly Director,_ affords such Variety of agreeable Dishes, that I have taken care to 

send to a curious Gentleman abroad for the Receipt how to dress it: They are very plenty in our 

Woods in _England,_ as I understand by several who have found them this Summer by my 

Directions, and I believe will be much more so, since several curious Gentlemen have followed my 

Advice in propagating them. It is now, as well as in the two preceding Months, that we may find 

them of a fine Flavour; but they being something more in perfection in this Month than in the 

others, I think it the properest to give the Methods of ordering them for the Table in this place: The 

first manner is to broil them.    To broil Truffles.  The Truffle being brought in fresh, wash it well, 

and cut off the rough Coat on the outside: some of these will be as large as one's Fist, and they 

are the best for this purpose; but let them be of any size, as soon as the Coat is off, cut them 

through a little more than half-way, and put Pepper and Salt into the opening, and close it again; 

then wrap up each Truffle in wet Paper close, and broil them over a gentle Fire of Wood-Embers 

till you judge they are enough, which will be as soon as they are very hot quite through; let them 

be turn'd as occasion requires, that they may be all equally done, and then serve them to the 

Table in a folded Napkin. This is a very good way of eating them, but the other I have more 

frequently eaten.    To

him before speaking. You must confine your conversation with him       strictly to the business in 

hand. You must not address an officer on       matters outside the prison. Insolence in any form to 

an officer,       foreman, or even to a fellow convict will not be tolerated,    9. On entering the cell 

house, office of the Board of Control, Warden       or Deputy Warden you must uncover unless 

your duties are such that       you have special permission to remain  The Truffles must be peel'd 

from the rough Coat on the outside, and well-wash'd; then cut your Truffles into Slices, and stew 

them in White wine, or Claret, which you please, with Salt, Pepper, and a Bay-leaf; or in the lieu of 

that, some _Jamaica_ Pepper, and serve them. White-wine for this use is generally preferred. 

To Stew Truffles after another manner.  Gather Truffles, peel them and wash them, and then cut 

them in Slices, after which fry them a little in a Stew-pan,

[Audience Looking Down on Prisoners in Prison Park, Decoration Day, 1909]   Audience Looking 

Down on Prisoners in Prison Park, Decoration Day, 1909                [Prisoners in Prison Park, 

Decoration Day, 1909]  Prisoners in Prison Park, Decoration Day, 1909. On holidays They Have 

the                           Privilege of Talking.                                     PRIVILEGES   You are not 

compelled to attend service, but you are specially requested to do so, believing that the moral 

support of religeous instruction is necessary to all.  You are required to bathe once a week in 

summer, once in two weeks in winter, and oftener if considered necessary by the prison Physician 

unless excused by him, the Warden or Warden.  On entering the prison you will receive three (3) 

tickets entitling you to the following privileges as long as you obey strictly all the rules of the 

prison:        First. One ration of tobacco each week.       Second. Permission to write under grade 

rules.       Third. Permission to see friends once in four weeks.       NEWSPAPERS. You are 

permitted to receive such weekly papers as the       Warden may approve. No daily papers or 

sensational publications of       any description will be admitted.       EXTRA LETTERS. Written 

permission must be obtained from the Warden       or Deputy Warden in case it becomes 

necessary to write special       letters.       MAIL MATTERS. Letters and papers of every description 

must be       examined at the office under the direction of the Warden before       being mailed or 

delivered.                                     SHOP RULES      1. On entering the shop you will take off your 

coat, put on your apron       and get at your work promptly. If you have any cause for complaint, 

whether from keeper, foreman or others you will be allowed to send       application for an interview 

through your officer at any time to the       Board of Control, Warden or Deputy Warden.    2. 

Communications between prisoners is strictly prohibited and will not       be allowed at any time 

except by special permission of the officers       in charge, and then only when absolutely 

necessary.    3. In talking with your foreman you are required to confine yourself       strictly to your 

shop duties. You will not be allowed to talk with       him upon matters pertaining to outside news. 

4. You will be required to approach your officer in a respectful       manner. Always salute him 

before addressing him and make your wants       known as briefly as possible.    5. You will be 

required to give your individual attention to your work.       Gazing about at visitors passing through 

the shop or at other       prisoners will not be allowed. You must respectfully listen to and 

faithfully carry out all instructions given you by your foreman       pertaining to your work.    6. You 

will not be allowed to leave your place of work except by       permission of the officer in charge. 

7. You will not be allowed to brush against a fellow convict in       passing, to get in each other's 

way or otherwise trespass upon the       rights of each other so as to provoke illfeeling.    8. 

Careless or wilful injury of your work or tools will be Hog's-Lard, and a little Wheat-Flower; then 

take them out and drain them, and put them again in a Stew-pan with Gravey, a bunch of Sweet-

Herbs, some Salt, Pepper, and Nutmeg grated; and when they have stewed a little in this, strain 

the Liquor, and dish them for the Table, garnished with Slices of Lemmon. Besides this way, they 

may be used in the same manner as Fowls are stewed or fricasseed, with brown or white Sauces, 

after they have been soften'd a little by boiling.  While I am speaking of the Truffle, I may well 

enough mention the Receipts for the management of the Morille. Altho' the Morille grows in 

_April_, which is the only time when it may be gather'd fresh, yet one may dress the dry'd ones 

now, by first softening them in warm Water and Salt for three or four Minutes; but, as observ'd 

before, they are best fresh gather'd. And again, I chuse to put the Receipts for their Management 



in this place, because they are so near a-kin to the Truffle. In the first place, I shall speak of drying 

them, which I have done in _England,_ after the following manner: Gather, and wash them, and 

when they are well drain'd, then lay them in a Dish, and dry them by degrees in a gentle Oven; 

and when they are throughly dry, keep them in a dry place, and in a cover'd earthen glazed Pot; 

but when they are fresh, order them according to the following Receipts. And I am the more ready 

to give these to the Publick, because all such who know the nicest way of eating, may nor be 

disappointed in their Travels thro' _England,_ and denied at the Inns such things as perhaps are 

as agreeable in that way, as any in the Country. Particularly I remember at _Newberry,_ or 

_Spinhamland,_ in the publick Road to _Bath,_ I was at the most publick and noted Inn in that 

Road, and had got some very good Mushrooms, and the People there were of opinion that they 

were poisonous, or else did not know how to dress them, and by no means they would send them 

to the Table. I say, if such mistakes can be made in a place where so many People of fashion 

travel continually, it is not likely that Morilles or Truffles will be received with more favour than my 

Mushrooms; and I believe that some of the greatest Niceties of our Country may ever remain 

unknown, without a Work of this nature, which I have pick'd up inch by inch, _viz._ in my Travels. 

And besides, considering the strange disagreeable Compositions which one meets with in some of 

our Travels, as Sugar with a pickled Trout, and many more as ridiculous; I think this little Piece of 

Work not unworthy my Time. Again, there are many Families in _England_ which have plenty 

about them, and do not know what to do with it; and therefore I think this the more necessary. But 

to come to my point, the Morille may be dress'd when it is either fresh or blanch'd in warm Water, 

according to the following Receipts, which I had from _France._    To make a Ragout of Morilles. 

The Morilles being fresh gather'd, take off the Roots, and wash them in many Waters, for the 

Wrinkles in their Tops harbour a great deal of Dirt and Sand; then slit them lengthways, and fry 

them a little in a Stew-pan, with Butter or Hogs-Lard, letting either be very hot when you put in the 

Morilles; then

reported.    9. You must always salute an officer on entering or retiring from your       shop. You will 

not be permitted to leave shop or place of work under       any circumstances without first obtaining 

special permission of the       officer in charge.   10. If you are sick or unable to work report the fact 

to your officer       and act as he may direct. If you desire to see the Physician give       your name 

to your officer immediately after entering the shop in the       morning.   11. All trading or bartering 

of whatsoever kind between prisoners or       between citizens and prisoners is strictly prohibited. 

You will not       be allowed to give or receive any present or gift from a foreman or       citizen 

under any condition.   12. If it becomes necesary to use a lead pencil about your work apply to 

your officer, who will supply you. Pencil must invariably be       returned to the officer every 

evening. You will not be allowed to       cut off or appropriate any part of pencil. 

DINING HALL RULES      1. On entering the dining hall take your seat promptly--position 

erect--arms folded, with eyes to the front until the signal is given       to commence eating.    2. 

Strict silence must be observed during the meal. Gravey, in which shred some Parsley and 

Cherville very small, with a young Onion, some Salt, and a little Nutmeg: let these stew gently, and 

send them to the Table garnish'd with slices of Lemmon, or they may be sent to the Table in 

Cream, as we have already mentioned concerning other things in the same manner.    To fry the 

Morilles.  Prepare your Morilles as directed in the former Receipt, and boil them in a little Gravey 

gently; when they begin to be tender, take them out of the Liquor, and flower them very well, then 

fry them in Hog's-Lard: when they are thus prepared, make a Sauce for them of the Liquor or 

Gravey the Morilles were stew'd in, season'd with Salt, Nutmeg and a little Juice of Lemmon.  The 

following Directions I had from a Gentleman in _Suffolk._ The Turkey is now in good Season, and 

may be either boiled or roasted; when it is boiled, it is most commonly served with Oyster-Sauce, 

and when it is designed for roasting, it may be larded with fine Fat of Bacon on the Breast, or else 

well strew'd with Crumbs of Bread, having first made a Farce to fill the Hollow of the Neck, where 

the Crop lay; this Farce may be made of grated Bread, Spice, Salt, butter'd Eggs, and some sweet 

Herbs powder'd, the whole well mix'd and bound with the Yolk of a raw Egg; or the Liver 


_
visitors, talking and laughing, fooling or gazing about the room is       strictly forbidden.    3. Eating 

or drinking before or after the gong sounds, using vinegar in       your drinking water, or putting 

meat on the table is prohibited.    4. Should you desire additional food make your wants known to 

the       waiters in the following manner:           1. If you want bread hold up your right hand.          2. 

Coffee or water, hold up your cup.          3. Meat, your fork.          4. Soup, hold up your spoon. 

5. Vegetables, hold up your knife.          6. If you desire be boiled and chop'd small and put into it. 

The Receipt as I receiv'd it directs Beef-Suet chop'd small instead of butter'd Eggs; but Mr. _John 

Hughs,_ a noted Cook in _London,_ tells me that Suet should be avoided in these Farces, 

because it is apt to cool too soon, and offend the Roof of the Mouth, and therefore directs butter'd 

Eggs in their stead. As for the Sauce for the roasted Turkey, it must be made with Gravey, a 

Bunch of sweet Herbs, some Lemmon-peel, a Shallot or two, and some whole Pepper and All-

spice boiled together and strained.  Concerning the Lark, which is now in Season,
