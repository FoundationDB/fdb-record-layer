Besides, after the scalp, and the elaborate lunch which was awaiting us in =
the middle of the room,=20

I felt myself bound to listen to the voice of the charmer. I was cheered, t=
oo, by Lord Spunyarn's=20

masterly defeat of Dabbler. _Poor_ Dabbler!"  "'Pon my word, I didn't know =
it. When we came in=20

there was a fat man messing with the things on the table. He was dressed li=
ke a waiter, and he=20

looked like one--a regular City waiter, you know. He held out his hand. Of =
course, I gave him my=20

hat and coat. He has no business to dress like a waiter and to hold out his=
 hand."  "Lord Spunyarn,=20

he is a common councilman, and he is going to dine with the Lord Mayor," cr=
ied Lucy.  "All the=20

same, he has no business to be dressed like a waiter in the morning, if eve=
n he be a common=20

councilman and going to dine with the Lord Mayor. Anyhow, he took the hat a=
nd coat, and then,=20

thank heaven, he bolted."  "What's Dabbler to him, or he to Dabbler, that h=
e should weep?"=20

misquoted Georgie's husband, who had enjoyed Dabbler's discomfiture.  "It's=
 all very well for you=20

all to laugh, but Mr. Sleek didn't seem to like it at all. What did he mean=
 by saying that Mr. Dabbler=20

was a warm man?" asked Lucy.  "Oh, piles of money of course; all the common=
 councilmen have=20

piles of money," said Spunyarn.  "And do they all dress like waiters in the=
 morning, and then dine=20

with the Lord Mayor?"  "Yes. I suppose it's an old City custom, you know. A=
nyhow they always=20

dine with the Lord Mayor. That's what they die of."  "And now I have someth=
ing to tell you, Lucy,"=20

said Mrs. Haggard. "It's all been decided. After the Christmas festivities =
at the Castle we are to go=20

to Rome, and we hope you will come too."  Lucy clapped her hands with girli=
sh glee. "Go with you,=20

Georgie dear? Of course I will. How good of you to ask me." the glass, and =
gave the last touch to=20

his consummate toilet, he offered his grateful thanks to Providence that hi=
s family was not=20

unworthy of him.  His grace was accustomed to say that he had only one misf=
ortune, and it was a=20

great one; he had no home. His family had married so many heiresses, and he=
, consequently,=20

possessed so many halls and castles, at all of which, periodically, he wish=
ed, from a right feeling,=20

to reside, that there was no sacred spot identified with his life in which =
his heart, in the bustle and=20

tumult of existence, could take refuge. Brentham was the original seat of h=
is family, and he was=20

even passionately fond of it; but it was remarkable how very short a period=
 of his yearly life was=20

passed under its stately roof. So it was his custom always to repair to Bre=
ntham the moment the=20

season was over, and he would exact from his children, that, however short =
might be the time,=20

they would be his companions under those circumstances. The daughters loved=
 Brentham, and=20

they loved to please their father; but the sons-in-law, though they were wh=
at is called devoted to=20

their wives, and, unusual as it may seem, scarcely less attached to their l=
egal parents, did not fall=20

very easily into this arrangement. The country in August without sport was =
unquestionably to them=20

a severe trial: nevertheless, they rarely omitted making their appearance, =
and, if they did=20

occasionally vanish, sometimes to Cowes, sometimes to Switzerland, sometime=
s to Norway, they=20

always wrote to their wives, and always alluded to their immediate or appro=
aching return; and their=20

letters gracefully contributed to the fund of domestic amusement.  And yet =
it would be difficult to=20

find a fairer scene than Brentham offered, especially in the lustrous efful=
gence of a glorious=20

English summer. It was=20


_
delighted.  "And have you the heart, Miss Warrender, to leave me, Mr. Sleek=
, and your other=20

countless admirers, here in England to 'dree our weary weirds alone?'"  And=
 so the idle talk ran=20

on. The Italian trip was discussed, and considerable ignorance of geography=
 was, as is usual,=20

manifested by all present. Lucy expressed her disappointment, on being info=
rmed that there were=20

now no brigands in Italy, save those behind the shop counters, or in the ch=
oruses of the opera.  A=20

trim maid then brought in the tea equipage, and Georgie did the honours wit=
h her usual unaffected=20

grace.  And now Parson Dodd and his sister were announced. The Dodds presen=
ted a rather=20

dishevelled appearance. They, too, had seen the Lord Mayor's scrupulous con=
dition; its spacious=20

and graceful chambers filled with treasures of art, and rising itself from =
statued and stately=20

terraces. At their foot spread a gardened domain of considerable extent, br=
ight with flowers, dim=20

with coverts of rare shrubs, and musical with fountains. Its limit reached =
a park, with timber such=20

as the midland counties only can produce. The fallow deer trooped among its=
 ferny solitudes and=20

gigantic oaks; but, beyond the waters of the broad and winding lake, the sc=
ene became more=20

savage, and the eye caught the dark forms of the red deer on some jutting m=
ount, shrinking with=20

scorn from communion with his gentler brethren.       CHAPTER 2 Lothair was=
 the little boy whom=20

Show. But the vicar, in a moment of weakness, had yielded to Anastatia's wi=
sh to see something=20

of the real Londoner, whom "dear Dickens has described so well," as she had=
 put it.  Great had=20

been her indignation at the want of respect shown to the Reverend John Dodd=
's cloth. With horror=20

she had heard her brother addressed by a disreputable costermonger in a man=
gy fur cap, as "Old=20

pal." And though the Reverend John stood all unmoved in the surging crowd, =
muscular pillar of the=20

Church that he was, it was only by clutching him very tightly that poor Ana=
statia preserved herself=20

from annihilation. She had seen the Lord Mayor's Show indeed, but at what a=
 price! The long grey=20

cloak which she wore, a sort of semi-religious garb a posthumous child, and=
 soon lost a devoted=20

mother. His only relation was one of his two guardians, a Scotch noble=E2=
=80=94a Presbyterian and a=20

Whig. This uncle was a widower with some children, but they were girls, and=
, though Lothair was=20

attached to them, too young to be his companions. Their father was a keen, =
hard man, honorable=20

and just but with no softness of heart or manner. He guarded with precise k=
nowledge and with=20

unceasing vigilance over Lothair=E2=80=99s vast inheritance, which was in m=
any counties and in more than=20

one kingdom; but he educated him in a Highland home, and when he had reache=
d boyhood=20

thought fit to send him to the High School of Edinburgh. Lothair passed a m=
onotonous, if not a=20

dull, life; but he found=20
