 looking at the swarthy-

skinned miners; examining new projected slopes; suggesting easier methods f=
or working out=20

different lumps of gold-bearing rock. While the former's knowledge of pract=
ical mining was=20

extended, the latter's was limited.  "I think thet thar ar' bigger prospect=
s yet, in further," the old=20

locater was saying. "I ain't much varsed on jeeological an' toppygraffical =
formation, myself, ye see;=20

but then, it kinder 'peers to me thet this quartz vein ar' a-goin' to hold =
out fer a consider'ble time=20

yet."  "Doubtless. More straight digging an' less slopes I should think wou=
ld be practicable,"=20

McKenzie observed.  "I don't see it!" said Redburn, joining them. "Sloping =
and transversing=20

discovers new veins, while line work soon plays out. I think things are wor=
king in excellent order at=20

present."  They all made a tour of the mine which had been dug a considerab=
le distance into the=20

mountain. The quartz was ordinarily productive, and being rather loosely th=
rown together was=20

blasted down magnate: "Use plenty of white space."  In conjunction with Mr.=
 Doubleday, Bok=20

prepared and issued this extra advertising, and for once, at least, the wis=
dom of using white space=20

was demonstrated.  But it was only a flash in the pan.  Publishers were unw=
illing to pay for=20

"unused space," as they termed it.  Each book was a separate unit, others a=
rgued: it was not like=20

advertising one article continuously in which money could be invested; and =
only a limited amount=20

could be spent on a book which ran its course, even at its best, in a very =
short time.  And, rightly or=20

wrongly, book advertising has continued much along the same lines until the=
 present day.  In fact,=20

in no department of manufacturing or selling activity has there been so lit=
tle progress during the=20

past fifty years as in bringing books to the notice of the public.  In all =
other lines, the producer has=20

brought his wares to the public, making it easier and still easier for it t=
o obtain his goods, while the=20

public, if it wants a book, must still seek the book instead of being sough=
t by it.  That there is a=20


_
extra trouble. After a short consultation, Redburn and the "General" conclu=
ded to place Frank over=20

the Utes as superintendent and mine-boss, as they saw that he was not used =
to digging, blasting=20

or any of the rough work connected with the mine, although he was clear-hea=
ded and inventive.=20

When tendered the position it was gratefully accepted by him, he expressing=
 it his intention to=20

work for the interest of his employers as long as he should stay in the gul=
ch.  Night at last fell over=20

the Flower Pocket gold-mines, and work ceased.  The Utes procured their own=
 food--mainly=20

consisting of fish from the little creek and deer and mountain birds that c=
ould be brought down at=20

almost any hour from the neighboring crags--and slept in the open air. Redb=
urn had McKenzie a=20

comfortable bed made in is no doubt: the wider distribution and easier acce=
ss given to periodicals=20

prove this point.  Now and then there has been tried an unsupported or not =
well-thought-out plan=20

for bringing books to a public not now reading them, but there seems little=
 or no understanding of=20

the fact that there lies an uncultivated field of tremendous promise to the=
 publisher who will strike=20

out on a new line and market his books, so that the public will not have to=
 ferret out a book-store=20

or wind through the maze of a department store.  The American reading publi=
c is not the book-

reading public that it should be or could be made to be; but the habit must=
 be made easy for it to=20

acquire.  Books must be placed where the public can readily get at them.  I=

arlet youth's identity;--

scarcely knew, in fact, that he was in the valley.  At the cabin, the eveni=
ng meal was dispatched=20

with a general expression of cheerfulness about the board. Anita seemed les=
s downcast than=20

usual, and the vivacious Alice made life and merriment for all. She was wit=
ty where wit was proper,=20

and sensible in an unusual degree.  Redburn was infatuated with her. He wat=
ched her with an=20

expression of fondness in his eyes; he admired her every gesture and action=
; he saw something=20

new to admire in her, each moment he was in her society.  When the evening =
meal was cleared=20

away, he took down the guitar, and sung several ballads, the old "General" =
accompanying him=20

with his rich deep bass, and Alice with her clear do so with books.  In the=
 meanwhile, Bok's literary=20

letter had prospered until it was now published in some forty-five newspape=
rs, One of these was=20

the _Philadelphia Times_.  In that paper, each week, the letter had been re=
ad by Mr. Cyrus H. K.=20

Curtis, the owner and publisher of _The Ladies' Home Journal_.  Mr. Curtis =
had decided that he=20

needed an editor for his magazine, in order to relieve his wife, who was th=
en editing it, and he=20

fixed upon the writer of _Literary Leaves_ as his man.  He came to New York=
, consulted Will=20

Carleton, the poet, and found that while the letter was signed by William J=
. Bok, it was actually=20

written by his brother who was with the Scribners.  So he sought Bok out th=
ere.  The publishing=20

house had been advertising in the Philadelphia magazine, so that the visit =
