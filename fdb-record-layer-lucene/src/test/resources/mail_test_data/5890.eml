all ready to tell you that story now."  "I've got to see these infants to b=

Ranger," and Socker sat down in a chair before the works based on the work =
as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we =

Sam, dodging behind Jack to be out of the musical student's reach.  "I'll p=
unch your head!"=20

exclaimed Fred.  "No, go on and play," said Jack. "It will liven things up =
a bit."  So Fred got out his=20

mouth-organ, and rendered a lively march, the boys parading around the tabl=

on the back the new member of the informal club.  "Now I guess we can eat,"=
 announced Jack.=20

and then, for a time, conversation languished, save for intermittent remark=
