(all of them provided for in the constitution); and the suppression of the =
Inquisition (February 22,=20

1813). The law of November 9, 1813, abolishing personal services for Indian=
s and regulating=20

public works, seems to have been intended only for America.  [157] February=
 20, 1812, was the=20

last meeting on the island of Len, the Cortes assembling on the twenty-four=
th at the church of San=20

Felipe Neri, at Cdiz.  [158] The method of election for the Cortes of 1813 =
(decree of May 23, 1812)=20

provided for a preliminary election board for each colonial province consis=
ting of the provincial=20

head, the archbishop, bishop, or acting archbishop, the intendant (if there=
 were one), the senior=20

alcalde, the senior regidor, the syndic procurator-general, and two commone=
rs (these last to be=20

chosen by the others). One representative was to be chosen for each 60,000 =
people. (See the=20

essential clauses of this decree in Montero y Vidal, Historia general, ii, =
pp. 406, 407.) On the same=20

day was also decreed the creation of provincial deputations, of which one w=
as specified for=20

Manila. In this session of Cortes also, the reorganization of the audiencia=
s was decreed, but the=20

Philippine representative seems to have taken no part in the debate.  [159]=
 Trouble had arisen=20

over the administration by the board of the obras pias which it was usual t=
o loan out to those=20

interested in the galleon trade.  [160] These ordinances were unconstitutio=
nal because control of=20

the hospice was vested in a board headed by the captain-general, while by t=
he constitution such=20

organizations were now to be controlled by the ayuntamientos and provincial=
 deputations. The=20

despatch regarding this matter was sent to the Cortes by the secretary of U=
ltramar, November 27,=20

1812.  [161] On July 7, 1810, the governor of the Philippines proposed the =
suppression of the=20

galleon, and requested permission for the inhabitants of the Philippines to=
 ship goods in Spanish=20

bottoms not in excess of 1,000,000 pesos. The suppression was resolved upon=
 by the Cortes by=20

article 3 of the decree of October 8, 1811, regarding commerce.  [162] This=
 decree (which is given=20

by Montero y Vidal, Historia general, li, pp. 412, 413) states that the inh=
abitants of the Philippines=20

may trade in Chinese and other Asiatic goods in private Spanish bottoms wit=
h the ports of=20

Acapulco and San Blas in Nueva Espaa, under the old terms of 500,000 pesos =
for the outgoing,=20

and 1,000,000 pesos for the return voyage. If the port of Acapulco be close=
d, they may trade at=20

Sonsonate. For four years the lower rates of duties granted by Crlos IV by =
decree of October,=20

1806, are continued. Boletas, or tickets granting lading space, are to be f=
urnished no longer.  [163]=20

In accordance with a royal order of June 17, commanding the representatives=
 of the colonies to=20

report the petitions pending, or which had not been moved, that had for the=
ir object the welfare of=20

the colonies, Reyes petitioned the suppression of the Acapulco galleon; per=
mission of 1,000,000=20

pesos for the outgoing, and 2,000,000 pesos for the return voyage; unlimite=
d extension of the=20

lower duties conceded October 4, 1806; one or two Peruvian ports open to th=
e commerce of the=20

islands; that natives of the islands be allowed to export goods in Spanish =
bottoms to any point of=20

the Spanish monarchy free of export and import duties; trade on the northwe=
st coast of America=20

with Spaniards; and that the permission be conceded to bring back all unsol=
d goods (in addition to=20

the amount of imports allowed), on payment to the treasury of a 6 per cent =
duty. The answers to=20

these requests were as follows: the Acapulco ship was suppressed by order o=
f April 23, 1815;=20

permission of export to the value of 750,000 pesos; the ports of Callao and=
 Guayaquil thrown open=20

to Philippine trade; traffic with the Spaniards on the northwest coast of A=
merica; permission to=20

bring back unsold goods to the extent of one-third the amount of imports al=
lowed, paying ten per=20

cent duty for such excess; and free trade for Philippine products at any po=
rt of the monarchy in=20



Spanish bottoms for ten years.  [164] On the seventh he took the oath to ob=
serve the Constitution=20

of 1812; and on the tenth, by a decree ordered the restablishment of the Se=
cretara del Despach=20

de la Gobernacin[, the first acts of which were the promulgation of the Con=
stitution of 1812, and=20

the restablishment of all the organisms created by the Cortes of 1810-1813.=
  [165] Apparently=20

appointed by the Secretary of Ultramar. Their credentials were approved at =
the third preliminary=20

meeting of July 5 or 6.  [166] A general decree of October 5, 1820, ordered=
 a uniform and general=20

schedule of duties for the Peninsula and Ultramar; but this law was modifie=
d by another law of=20

December 20, 1821, recognizing the impracticability of uniformity of duties=
 for Spain and the=20

colonies, and providing that the schedule be uniform except for the differe=
nces rendered=20

necessary in the provinces of Ultramar.  [167] The secretary of Hacienda co=
nsidered the privileges=20

of the company for the importation of cotton goods as unconstitutional and =
contrary to the=20

prosperity of national manufactures. At the meeting of August 18, it develo=
ped that the company=20

had transferred its monopoly to a foreign merchant of Cdiz. The company was=
 allowed to present=20

its argument, but the report of the committees on Commerce and Hacienda was=
 adopted. Later=20

the company presented a petition requesting the liquidation of the governme=
nt's indebtedness to=20

it, the privilege of selling its stock of cotton goods, and various other c=
oncessions incident to the=20

closing up of its affairs. This petition, sent to the Cortes by the secreta=
ry of Hacienda, was referred=20

to the committee on Commerce on November 2. On the fifth, a petition was pr=
esented by the=20

Philippine representatives and Gregorio Gonzales Azaolo, of Sevilla, asking=
 that the prohibition of=20

the importation of cotton goods should not affect the Philippines until the=
 industry was developed=20

or established in those islands. This petition having been referred to the =
committees on Commerce=20

and Hacienda, their report on November 8 recommended the opening of the Ori=
ental trade to all=20

Spaniards trading in Spanish bottoms. This recommendation was embodied in a=
rticle 3 of the=20

decree of November 9, specifying the kinds of goods which Spanish ships tra=
ding by the Cape of=20

Good Hope could introduce into Spain or Spanish America.  [168] The decrees=
 of the Diarios de=20

las Cortes show no decree of this date confirming a previous decree of Marc=
h 7, 1820, granting=20

exemption of duties for ten years on natural and industrial products of the=
 Philippines, when=20

imported in Spanish bottoms into the Peninsula, as declared by Montero y Vi=
dal. The decree of=20

December 21, 1820, providing for the abolition of the monopoly on tobacco a=
nd salt after March 1,=20

1821, and providing customs and consumption duties, seems not to have affec=
ted the Philippines.=20

[169] In October, 1820, the preliminary board for the election of represent=
atives was organized in=20

Manila, but inasmuch as the elections were not held until after the Constit=
ution had been sworn to=20

in Manila in May, 1821 (and later in the provinces), no regularly-elected r=
epresentatives were=20

present at the second session.  [170] Wrongly called a decree by Montero y =
Vidal. This order was=20

addressed to the Secretary of War in answer to a question raised by the Cou=
ncil of War.  [171]=20

The special discussion arose over the item of 50,000 reals for missions and=
 a note in the report=20

reflecting on the native clergy in the Philippines. Some of the Americans, =
who were quite fully=20

imbued with the free thought of the French philosophical school, declared f=
or the suppression of=20

the missionaries (meaning friars), inasmuch as they were useless and even h=
armful. The=20

committee answered this by asserting that the missionaries in the Philippin=
es were used by the=20

government as civil and political agents, and that they did do much good wo=
rk in their own=20

legitimate line. The passage concerning the incapacity of the native clergy=
 was meant to apply to=20



the Philippines alone, but if desired it could be removed as it was not ess=
ential to the report. An=20

American representative moved that the 50,000 reals be used in the establis=
hment of normal=20

schools in Ultramar. The Philippine representatives seem to have taken no p=
art in the debate=20

except that Camus y Herrera moved that the obnoxious clause concerning the =
Filipino clergy be=20

stricken out. The report was accepted as read.  [172] Each university was t=
o have a public library,=20

a drawing school, a chemical laboratory, cabinets of physics, natural histo=
ry, and industrial=20

products, another of models of machines, a botanical garden, and an experim=
ent farm. The=20

university to be established in Manila was to have theological and law cour=
ses for the doctorate.=20

Manila was also to have a medical school, a school for veterinary medicine,=
 a school of fine arts,=20

and commercial and nautical schools. Professorships were to be filled by co=
mpetition, and those=20

for the Philippines were to be examined by persons designated by the Subdir=
ection of Studies in=20

Mexico. Girls were to be taught to read, write, and cipher; while the older=
 female students were to=20

be taught the work suitable to their sex. This matter of education for girl=
s was left to the provincial=20

deputations.  [173] On the twenty-third there was a discussion as to the le=
gality of the substitutes=20

for the representatives of Ultramar being allowed to hold over; and it was =
finally declared that only=20

those for the Philippines and Peru could sit during this session.  [174] Th=
is exclusion was in=20

accordance with a decision of the committee on Credentials handed in Februa=
ry 11, 1822, to the=20

effect that government employes did not cease, to be such until their resig=
nations were accepted=20

by the government. Posada did not present his credentials at the meeting of=
 February 15,=20

declaring that they had been robbed with his baggage en route from Cdiz to =
Madrid. He did=20

present them, however, at the next meeting of February 20. At the third and=
 fourth preliminary=20

meetings (February 22 and 24) the matter was debated, and he was excluded o=
n the grounds of=20

being still a government employe.  [175] Foreman states wrongly (p. 362, ed=
. of 1906) that=20

seventeen deputies were elected and sat during the Cortes of 1820-23, and h=
e names eight of=20

them. He may have confused the names of electors with those of representati=
ves. The four=20

elected (of whom only three are known) were perhaps elected for the distric=
ts of the archiepiscopal=20

see and the three suffragan sees of the Philippines; although Montero y Vid=
al says that both Senz=20

de Vizmanos and Posada were elected from Nueva Cceres.  [176] Although a pr=
ovincial=20

deputation had been organized in Manila in 1822, almost its only act was to=
 petition (April 12,=20

1823) for more missionaries.  [177] Fernando's infant daughter, Isabel II, =
ascended the throne=20

under the regency of her mother Mara Cristina. Through the efforts of the l=
iberals, six important=20

decrees were passed March 24, 1834: suppression of the Consejo de Estado, d=
uring the minority=20

of the queen; suppression of the Consejos de Castilla and de Indias, in who=
se place was=20

established a Tribunal Superior de Espaa  Indias; suppression of the Consej=
o Supremo de=20

Guerra, and in its place the establishment of the Tribunal Supremo de Guerr=
a y Marina y de=20

Extranjera; suppression of the Consejo Supremo de Hacienda, replacing it by=
 a Tribunal Supremo=20

de Hacienda; an order to the Secretary of the Despacho de Gracia y Justicia=
 to propose the new=20

organization of the Consejo Real de las Ordenes; and the institution of a C=
onsejo Real de Espaa=20

Indias to have general supervision of American and Philippine matters.  [17=
8] The first news of=20

reform and the fact that the new Cortes were to be summoned was received un=
officially at Manila=20

by a United States ship sailing from Cdiz in June, 1834, and reaching Manil=
a toward the end of the=20

same year.  [179] No provision was made in the third Cortes for substitute =
representation for=20



Ultramar (except in the decree of August 21, 1836, calling a Cortes for Oct=
ober 24 under the rules=20

of the Constitution of 1812), which is in point with the ignorance manifest=
ed throughout this period=20

by the officials at Madrid with regard to the Philippines. This accounts fo=
r the islands having no=20

representation for some of the sessions of the Cortes.  [180] Andrs Garca C=
amba resided in=20

Manila during 1825-35, and became so popular that he was elected a deputy t=
o the Spanish=20

Cortes; he was afterward (August, 1837-December, 1838) governor of the Phil=
ippines, and wrote a=20

book (published at Cdiz, 1839) regarding his experiences while holding that=
 office. Himself liberally=20

inclined, he was constantly opposed by reactionary influences. Although his=
 name does not=20

appear in the pamphlet Filipinas y su representacin en Cortes, he is genera=
lly considered as its=20

author; and he alludes to it in the memoir above mentioned. (Vindel, Cat. b=
ib. filip., nos. 1881,=20

1886.)  [181] Foreman says that Lecaros was a mestizo; and Montero y Vidal =
that he was a=20

Filipino lawyer. The board of electors was mainly composed of peninsulars. =
 [182] Camba=20

proposed (Filipinas y su representacin en Cortes, 1836) a special mode of e=
lection to Cortes for=20

the Philippines, which was to be by the Manila Ayuntamiento, as that was th=
e only political=20

organization in the islands worth mentioning, and was in direct contact wit=
h affairs. The law to be=20

adopted for Ultramar, Camba argued, must take into account the condition of=
 the country and the=20

inhabitants. During this session, the Philippine representatives presented =
two petitions to the=20

Secretario, del Despacho de Hacienda, asking in one for a moderation of the=
 excessive duties on=20

the introduction of Spanish brandy into the Philippines, and in the other t=
he sending of few=20

pensioners and subaltern employes to the islands, as this was a prejudice t=
o the native Philippine=20

Spaniards. Lecaros presented a plan to Mendizbal, the provisional president=
 of the Consejo de=20

Ministros, for the suppression of the monopoly on tobacco in the Philippine=
s, but Mendizbal took=20

measures to make the monopoly more remunerative to the state. See Montero y=
 Vidal, Historia=20

general, ii. pp. 554, 555, note.  [183] He wrote Memoria sobre las Islas Fi=
lipinas (Valencia, 1842).=20

[184] July 31, 1837, the new commercial treaty made September 22, 1836, bet=
ween the governor=20

of the Philippines and the sultan of Jol was referred to the committees on =
State and Commerce,=20

was reported on favorably on October 4, and was accordingly approved on the=
 twelfth of October.=20

This treaty stipulated that every three-masted schooner porting at Jol with=
 Chinese passengers=20

from Manila was to pay 2,000 pesos fuertes, and lesser boats in proportion =
to their size. As the=20

most important cargo ever sent to Jol from Manila never exceeded 2,500 peso=
s in value, it is hard=20

to see the value of this treaty so greatly lauded in Madrid. No Joloan vess=
els went to Manila. In=20

this matter the officials showed a woful ignorance of the Philippines, the =
minister of the navy=20

stating that all vessels stopped at Jol on their way to the Philippines. Th=
is treaty, as well as the=20

one made by the governor of Zamboanga with the chief of Maluso near Basilan=
, only made the=20

Moros bolder in their piracy. See Montero y Vidal, Historia general, ii, pp=
. 557-560.  [185] On May=20

25, 1869, an amendment was presented by Julin Pelln y Rodriguez in the Span=
ish Cortes=20

demanding that parliamentary representation be granted to Filipinas. Among =
the signers to this=20

amendment were Victor Balaguer and Francisco Javier Moya. (Vindel, Cat. bib=
. filip., no. 1883.)=20

[186] The host was stolen at least three other times in the history of the =
Philippines: once in=20

Camarines; once in Malate; and in 1730 from the Franciscan convent and chur=
ch at Maycavayan.=20

See San Antonio, Chronicas, i, p. 181.  [187] In 1808, the Manila diocese c=
omprehended the=20

provinces and districts of Manila, Bulacan, Batangas, Cavite, La Infanta, L=
aguna, Mindoro,=20



Morong, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Principe, Tarlac and Zambales. It had 219 pa=
rishes, 24 parish=20

plans were completely upset by one of the troopers espying smoke issuing fr=
om the scrub on a=20

small creek, that entered the bay about half-way between the town and the M=
acalister.  "We had=20

better have a look in here," said Dunmore, "there is no knowing where we ma=
y stumble on some=20

information."  Accordingly, the helm was put up, and we ran into the mouth =
of the inlet, with the=20

wind right aft.  Beaching the boat on the soft sand, we sprang out, and adv=
anced cautiously in the=20

direction of the smoke, but, after several minutes of scrambling, we reache=
d the fire only to find it=20

deserted, its original proprietors having seen our sudden alteration of cou=
rse, and sought the=20

safety of the dense bush, where further search would have been useless.  "N=
ow that we are on=20

shore," said Dunmore, "let us make a billy full of tea; it won't take long.=
  Here, you boys, get 'em=20

like 'it waddy to make 'em fire."  The troopers and Lizzie dispersed in que=
st of fuel; Ferdinand=20

walking up the bank of the creek, where he was soon lost to sight.  A loud =
coo-eh from that=20

direction soon brought us to the spot from whence it issued, and we found t=
he boy staring at=20

several pieces of timber sticking out of the sand.  "Big fellow canoe been =
sit down here," he said,=20



on our approach, and examining the protruding stumps, we soon saw enough to=
 convince us that=20

the boy was right, and that we were in the presence of a vessel, wrecked, o=
r abandoned, Heaven=20

only knows how many years ago.  With our hands, with pint pots, with a spad=
e we had brought=20

with us--mindful of the difficulty we had experienced in finding a resting-=
place for poor Cato--with=20

every utensil, in fact, that ingenuity could devise, we set to work clearin=
g away the sand that had=20

accumulated round the old ribs. Suddenly, the tin rim of one of the pots ga=
ve back a ringing sound,=20

as if it had struck against metal, and in less than a minute, a much rusted=
 cannon-shot was=20

exposed to view, and passed round from hand to hand.  It was of small size,=
 weighing, perhaps,=20

five pounds, though its dimensions were evidently much decreased by the was=
ting action of damp.=20

"By Jove!" said Dunmore, "perhaps she was a Spanish galleon, and we shall c=
ome across her=20

treasure.  Won't that be a find, eh, old fellow?"  "She's more likely a pir=
ate," I answered, as visions=20

of the old buccaneers floated through my brain; and Edgar Poe's fanciful st=
ory of the "Gold Beetle"=20

occurring to me, I sung out, "Whatever you do, keep any parchment you stumb=
le across," and=20

abandoned myself to thoughts of untold wealth, whilst I wielded a quart pot=
 with the energy born of=20

mental excitement.  "My word! that been big fellow sit down like 'it here,"=
 cried Ferdinand, who,=20

lying on one side, had his bare arm buried at full length in the sand. "I f=
eel him, Marmy, plenty=20

cold."  We rushed to the boy's assistance, and speedily scraped away the sh=
ingle, until an old-

fashioned gun was exposed to view; it was coated and scaly with rust to suc=
h an extent, that we=20

were unable to form any idea as to its age or nationality.  It would most p=
robably have been a=20

twelve or eighteen-pounder howitzer, for it was about four feet in length, =
and disproportionately=20

large in girth; but one of the trunnions, and the button at the breech, wer=
e broken off, the portion=20

that had lain undermost had entirely disappeared, and the remainder was so =
honeycombed, that=20

beyond ascertaining that it was a piece of ordnance, we could elicit nothin=
g from this curious relic=20

of a bygone generation.  Further search brought to light several more round=
-shot, but in the same=20

state as the first, and we noticed that in several places the timbers were =
burnt, most probably by=20

the natives, or the crew themselves, for the sake of the copper bolts.  Wha=
t a number of=20

melancholy recollections are awakened by the discovery of a forgotten memor=
ial of the past, such=20

as this nameless wreck; and if those old timbers could have spoken, what a =
strange record of=20

hopes unfulfilled, and high adventure unachieved, would have been disinterr=
ed from the dark=20

storehouse of the past!  That the vessel came in her present position by ac=
cident, could hardly be=20

supposed.  More probably, having struck on the Barrier Reef, or on some of =
the hidden coral=20

shelves with which this sea abounds, she had been taken into this secluded =
creek for repairs.=20

Cook, the great circumnavigator, careened his ship at a spot not far distan=
t from this; but we were=20

unanimously of opinion that this vessel must have become embedded long prio=
r to his time.  Not=20

only was the framework some distance from the present bed of the creek, but=
 it was raised=20

considerably above the water level.  That the eastern coast of Australia is=
 slowly rising from the=20

waves is well known, for in the neighbourhood of Brisbane valuable reclamat=
ions have been made=20

within the memory of living men; but at least two centuries must have elaps=
ed to account for the=20

altitude attained by this old craft.  Our regret was great at getting no mo=
re certain information, but=20

although we persevered in digging until sundown, no casket of jewels, no ba=
gs of specie, and no=20

mysterious parchments rewarded us; and with the darkness we were compelled =
to abandon our=20

search, rather angry at having wasted several valuable hours to such little=
 purpose.  As it would=20



have been madness attempting to cross the bar before daylight, we hauled th=
e boat up on the=20

beach, and made ourselves comfortable for the night.  About one o'clock, th=
e trooper who was on=20

watch, awakened us with the news that there was a light out at sea.  We tho=
ught at first it could=20

only be some blacks in their canoes, spearing fish by torchlight, but it gr=
adually drew nearer and=20

nearer, until at last we could distinguish the distant sound of voices, and=
 the faint rattle of the iron=20

cable as it flew out through the hawse-hole.  "Some coasting craft, I suppo=
se," said Dunmore.=20

"Most probably, but we shall find out in the morning;" and we were soon aga=
in in the land of=20

dreams.  Before daylight we had finished breakfast, and by the time the sun=
 rose, were in the=20

whale-boat, pulling towards the new arrival.  She was a dirty, weather-beat=
en, nondescript-looking=20

little craft, half fore and aft schooner, half dandy-rigged cutter, and the=
 look-out on board was=20

evidently not very vigilant, for we had almost arrived alongside, before a =
black head showed over=20

the gunwale, and, frightened at seeing a boat-load of armed men in such an =
unexpected spot,=20

poured out a flood of shrieking jargon that would have aroused the Seven Sl=
eepers, and which=20

speedily awoke from their slumbers the remainder of the crew. There seemed =
to be only two white=20

men, one of whom introduced himself as the captain, and asked us, in French=
, to come on board.=20

The vessel was the 'Gabrielle d'Estonville', of New Caledonia, commanded by=
 Captain Jean=20

Labonne, and had put into Rockingham Bay for water, during a 'beche-de-mer'=
 expedition.=20

Anything to equal the filth of the fair 'Gabrielle', I never saw.  Her crew=
 consisted of another=20

Frenchman besides the captain, and of seven or eight Kanakas, two of whom h=
ad their wives on=20

board.  As perhaps this extraordinary trade is but little known to the read=
er who has not resided in=20

China, I will briefly narrate how it is carried out.  From the neighbourhoo=
d of Torres Straits to about=20

the Tropic of Capricorn, extends, at a distance of fifty to a hundred miles=
 from the shore, an=20

enormous bed of coral, named the Barrier Reef.  There, untold millions of m=
inute insects are still=20

noiselessly pursuing their toil, and raising fresh structures from the dept=
hs of the ocean.  Neither is=20

this jagged belt--though deadly to the rash mariner--without its uses. In t=
he first place, a clear=20

channel is always found between it and the mainland, in which no sea of any=
 formidable=20

dimensions can ever rise, and now that modern surveys have accurately indic=
ated where danger=20

is to be found, this quiet channel is of the greatest use to the vessels fr=
equenting that portion of=20

the ocean, for they avoid the whole swell of the broad Pacific, which now t=
hunders against and=20

breaks harmlessly on the huge coral wall, instead of wasting its fury on th=
e coast itself.  In the=20

second place on the Barrier Reef is found the 'Holothuria', from which the =
'beche-de-mer' is=20

prepared. It is a kind of sea-slug, averaging from one to over two feet in =
length, and four to ten=20

inches in girth.  In appearance, these sea-cucumbers are more repulsive, lo=
oking like flabby black=20

or green sausages, and squirting out a stream of salt water when pressed.  =
But despite their=20

disgusting appearance, they are a most valuable cargo, from the high price =
they fetch in the=20

Chinese market, where they are a much-esteemed delicacy. The vessel that go=
es in quest of=20

'beche-de-mer' takes several expert divers--usually Kanakas, or South Sea I=
slanders--and having=20

arrived at the ground they propose fishing, a sort of head-quarters is esta=
blished on some=20

convenient island, where vegetables are planted, to stave off the scurvy th=
at would otherwise soon=20

attack the adventurers.  This done the little vessel proceeds to the edge o=
f the reef, and begins=20

work in earnest.  The sea-slug is found buried amidst the triturated sand, =
worn away by the=20

constant play of the waves, and only the experienced and keen-eyed Kanakas =
can detect its=20



whereabouts, by the  fitful waving of the long feathery tentacles surroundi=
ng the mouth of the fish,=20

which immerses its body in the sand.  The vessel being anchored, her boat i=
s got out, and pulled=20

to the smooth water within the reef, the divers keeping a keen scrutiny on =
the milk-white floor for=20

any indication of their prey. Suddenly, the man in the bows holds up his ha=
nd, as a sign to desist=20

from pulling.  He drops quietly into the clear water, and the length of tim=
e that elapses before his=20

black head reappears, is enough to make a bystander nervous.  Often the div=
er has to encounter=20

his dread enemy the shark, and if cool and collected, generally comes off v=
ictorious in the contest.=20

The South Sea Islanders have a thorough knowledge of the habits of this sal=
t-water pirate, and=20

know that by keeping underneath him, they cannot be touched, and they will =
fearlessly stab the=20

intruder with their knives, and avail themselves of his momentary departure=
 to regain the boat.  I=20

have known one instance of a native jumping into the water to distract the =
attention of a shark that=20

was swimming guard over his friend, and both escaped unhurt; but still, des=
pite their utmost skill,=20

accidents do often occur.  In shallow water the 'beche-de-mer' is caught wi=
th a five-pronged=20

instrument, resembling an eel-spear.  The animals are split open, boiled, p=
ressed flat, and dried in=20

the sun, and after a sufficient number have been taken, they are carried to=
 the island rendezvous=20

and there smoked with dry wood, which last process converts the slug into g=
enuine 'beche-de-

mer', fit for the market, and for the palates of Celestial epicures.  I tri=
ed to cook some, but after=20

boiling it for a couple of hours in a quart pot, it came out like a dirty p=
iece of indian-rubber, and so=20

tough that no teeth could penetrate it.  Captain Labonne welcomed us very c=
ordially--the sight of a=20

strange face must have been a godsend--and most hospitably asked us to shar=
e his breakfast, but=20

as it consisted only of dried fish, which smelt most abominably, we decline=
d, and he was very=20

grateful for a couple of pots of sardines which we gave him out of our slen=
der stock.  The=20

'Gabrielle' was on her way to Cardwell for fresh provisions and water, and =
after the dangers to be=20

avoided had been pointed out by the pilot, we bade adieu to Jean Labonne an=
d his queer crew,=20

though not before one of our party had succeeded in jotting down the featur=
es of a Kanaka diver,=20

his wife and child.     AN AUSTRALIAN SEARCH PARTY--VI.  BY CHARLES H. EDEN=
.   WE now=20

pulled for the mouth of the Macalister River, and on sighting the bar short=
ly before eight o'clock,=20

were glad to find but little surf running.  On our way we passed several wa=
ter-snakes, one of which=20

seemed of large size, but we were too distant to form any accurate estimate=
 of its length.  It was=20

not altogether without misgivings that we encountered the ridge of sand tha=
t extended completely=20

across the entrance of the river. Only one of our party had ever crossed it=
 before, and it was=20

known to be very dangerous.  The calm water rolled itself up in smooth wall=
s, which sailed=20

majestically along until the upper portion broke into a line of white, and =
soon the entire mass=20

rushed onward in a sheet of foam.  The great danger in crossing a bar is, t=
hat the helmsman either=20

loses his head and permits the boat to present her broadside to the surf, o=
r that the steering power=20

is not sufficient to keep her head straight. Neither of these misfortunes b=
efell us in entering the=20

Macalister, for, from the hour we had selected, the sea was at its quietest=
, and we got over without=20

shipping a thimbleful of water.  We found a broad expanse studded with dens=
e mangrove flats,=20

and it was with difficulty we ascertained which was the main channel.  We p=
ulled on until about=20

noon, by which time the mud swamps had disappeared, and we were fairly in t=
he river, which=20

much resembled the Herbert, of which I have already given a description, ex=
cept that it was=20

smaller, and that the vegetation was more luxurious.  On landing, we lit a =
fire, and cooked our=20



dinner, consisting of ducks and moor-fowl that we had shot on our way up.  =
I never remember=20

seeing water-fowl in such profusion as here.  The ducks and geese were lite=
rally in tens of=20

thousands, and the beautifully-plumaged moor-fowl quite blackened the mangr=
ove bushes as we=20

passed.  The scenery was perfectly lovely.  Tall palms shot up in every dir=
ection; wild bananas=20

spread forth their broad leaves, amidst which were seen the bunches of frui=
t; and the larger trees--

fig, Leichhardt plum, etc.--threw their branches across the river, and ther=
e interlacing, formed a=20

leafy canopy such as we imagined was unknown in Australia.  Some of the you=
ng palms we cut=20

down for the sake of the head, which is very pleasant eating.  Stripping of=
f the leaves, you come to=20

a shoot twenty inches or two feet in length, the interior of which consists=
 of a white substance=20

resembling an office ruler in thickness, and which tastes something like a =
chestnut, but is much=20

more milky and sweet.  The fruit of the wild banana has a most delicious fl=
avour, but is so full of=20

small seeds that it is impossible to swallow it.  The huge fig trees, with =
which the banks of most of=20

the northern rivers abound, have the peculiarity that the fruit is found gr=
owing on the trunk, and not=20

at the extremity of the smaller boughs.  On an enormous stem, and at a dist=
ance of only a few feet=20

from its base, are seen bunches of figs, and these, though of smaller size =
than the European fruit,=20

are very palatable, if they can be selected free from insects. Usually, the=
 ants have been first=20

afield, and have taken up their abode in the very heart of the fig, forming=
 a most undesirable=20

mouthful for the unwary stranger.  The wild plums are very good, but to att=
ain perfection, should=20

be buried for some days previous to eating. I trust these details will not =
prove tedious to my=20

readers, but I know from experience the benefit arising from even a slight =
knowledge of wild fruits=20

and herbs, which have often quenched thirst and assuaged hunger when other =
food was wanting,=20

and rendered endurable what would otherwise have been a painful journey.  W=
e camped that=20

night where darkness overtook us, close to a thick scrub which lined the ba=
nk of the river, and we=20

paid for our stupidity in not selecting a more open spot, for myriads of mo=
squitoes put sleep out of=20

the question.  The truth was that this belt of scrub had lined the river fo=
r several miles past, and we=20

hoped at every turn to come to a break, but night set in whilst we were sti=
ll between the leafy=20

walls.  Daylight came at last, and we pushed onward.  An hour took us into =
a beautiful black-soil=20

plain of great extent, without a stick of timber, and well watered, not onl=
y by the Macalister, which=20

meandered through its centre, but by several large lagoons, overgrown with =
the lovely white lotus,=20

and crowded with waterfowl.  The existence of such a planter's paradise was=
 totally unsuspected,=20

and we all gazed spell-bound on this splendid tract of country, possessing =
every requisite for=20

successful cultivation, and a water road for the produce. Dunmore was a tru=
e prophet when he=20

exclaimed--  "Before a year is past this will be settled upon."  A fine sug=
ar plantation now stands=20

on "Bellenden Plains," with superb cane growing in unwonted luxuriance, and=
 horses and cattle=20

have taken the place of the kangaroos, that we on this first visit found gr=
azing there in troops.  In=20

the distance could be seen the coast range behind Cardwell, which seemed to=
 recede inland as it=20

trended towards our position, and sweeping round, approached the sea again =
farther north,=20

forming a natural boundary to a vast space of available country.  A silver =
line shone out on the=20

mountains, and with our glasses we could make out that it must be a waterfa=
ll of very large=20

dimensions.  We at once agreed that it must be the source of the very river=
 we were on, the=20

Macalister, but, as the sequel will show, we found so many streams, that mo=
st probably we were=20

mistaken in our judgment.  We resolved to make this charming spot our head-=
quarters for the=20



present, as we had everything to be desired--water, game, etc.--close at ha=
nd, and, from the=20

absence of timber, no blacks would be able to steal upon us unperceived.  L=
eaving the pilot and=20

one man in charge of the boat, we trudged along through the high grass, whi=
ch reached to our=20

middles, and was dripping with moisture from a shower that had fallen durin=
g the night; and, after=20

a tedious walk, reached the edge of the scrub.  It was thicker than anythin=
g we had encountered=20

before, the density of the foliage totally excluding the sun, and giving ri=
se to a dank humid odour=20

that struck a chill to the heart directly you entered.  We wound along the =
path, or rather track, that=20

the blacks had made, with the greatest difficulty.  It was all very well fo=
r the troopers, who had=20

stripped, but our clothes hitched up on a thorn at every other step.  One o=
f our most provoking=20

enemies was the lawyer vine, a kind of rattan enclosed in a rough husk, cov=
ered with thousands of=20

crooked prickles.  These, with their outer covering, are about an inch and =
a quarter in diameter,=20

and extend to an enormous distance, running up to the tops of lofty trees, =
and from thence either=20

descending or pushing onward, or festooning themselves from stem to stem in=
 graceful curves of=20

indescribable beauty.  From the joints of the parent shoot are thrown out l=
ittle slender tendrils, no=20

thicker than a wire, but of great length, and as dangerously armed as their=
 larger relation.  These=20

miserable little wretches seem always on the watch to claw hold of somethin=
g, and if you are=20

unhappy enough to be caught, and attempt to disengage yourself by strugglin=
g, fresh tendrils=20

appear always to lurk in ambush, ready to assist their companion, who alrea=
dy holds you in his=20

grasp.  I have measured the length of one of these canes, and found it over=
 250 paces; and this is=20

not the maximum to which they attain, for I have been assured by men employ=
ed in cutting a=20

telegraph road through the scrub that they had found some over 300 yards lo=
ng.  They seem to=20

retain the same circumference throughout their whole length, and, as the bu=
shman puts everything=20

to some use, the lawyer is divested of his husk, and takes the place of wir=
e in fencing, being rove=20

through the holes bored in the posts as though they were ropes. It is almos=
t needless to add that=20

this cane derives its 'soubriquet' of "lawyer" from the difficulty experien=
ced in getting free if once=20

caught in its toils.  Another of the torments to which the traveller is sub=
jected in the North=20

Australian scrubs, is the stinging-tree ('Urtica gigas'), which is very abu=
ndant, and ranges in size=20

from a large shrub of thirty feet in height to a small plant measuring only=
 a few inches.  Its leaf is=20

large and peculiar, from being covered with a short silvery hair, which, wh=
en shaken, emits a fine=20

pungent dust, most irritating to the skin and nostrils.  If touched, it cau=
ses most acute pain, which=20

is felt for months afterwards--a dull gnawing pain, accompanied by a burnin=
g sensation,=20

particularly in the shoulder, and under the arm, where small lumps often ar=
ise.  Even when the=20

sting has quite died away, the unwary bushman is forcibly reminded of his i=
ndiscretion each time=20

that the affected part is brought into contact with water.  The fruit is of=
 a pink, fleshy colour,=20

hanging in clusters, and looks so inviting that a stranger is irresistibly =
tempted to pluck it; but=20

seldom more than once, for though the raspberry-like berries are harmless i=
n themselves, some=20

contact with the leaves is almost unavoidable.  The blacks are said to eat =
the fruit; but for this I=20

cannot vouch, though I have tasted one or two at odd times, and found them =
very pleasant.  The=20

worst of this nettle is the tendency it exhibits to shoot up wherever a cle=
aring has been effected.=20

In passing through the dray tracks cut through the scrub, great caution was=
 necessary to avoid the=20

young plants that cropped up even in a few weeks.  I have never known a cas=
e of its being fatal to=20

human beings; but I have seen people subjected by it to great suffering, no=
tably a scientific=20



gentleman, who plucked off a branch and carried it some distance as a curio=
sity, wondering the=20

while what was causing the pain and numbness in his arm.  Horses I have bee=
n die in agony from=20

the sting, the wounded parts becoming paralysed; but strange to say, it doe=
s not seem to injure=20

cattle, who dash through scrubs full of it without receiving any damage.  T=
his curious anomaly is=20

well known to all bushmen.  For a couple of hours we followed the tortuous =
windings of the track,=20

without we white men having the faintest conception where we were going, th=
ough the troopers=20

and Lizzie declared that we were pushing straight through.  At length a ray=
 of sunlight became=20

visible, and in a few minutes we emerged from the sombre depths of the jung=
le, and found=20

ourselves on the banks of a splendid river, the Mackay.  Traces of blacks w=

and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from al=
l threatened them with=20

wholesale destruction if they gave warning of our approach to any other tri=
be, by either smoke=20

signals or messengers, we departed, much disgusted.  On arriving at the edg=
e of a small copse, at=20

a short distance from the camp, we found the arsenal of the male portion of=
 the tribe.  Why they=20

had stacked their arms so far away from the gungales we never could make ou=
t; but there they=20

were, consisting of the usual spears and shields, and, in addition, several=
 of the enormous swords=20

used by these natives, of which we had often heard, but that few of our par=
ty, except Dunmore,=20

had ever seen. These curious weapons are made of the heaviest iron-bark woo=
d, are about five=20

feet in length, by as many inches in breadth, and about an inch thick in th=
e centre--rather more=20

than less, and both edges scraped down to as sharp an edge as the material =
will receive.  They=20

are slightly curved; but the most wonderful part about them is the handle, =
which is so small that a=20

European can with difficulty squeeze three fingers into it.  The mystery is=
, how do they use them?=20

for Goliath of Gath could never have wielded an instrument as heavy as this=
 with one hand.  It is=20

supposed that the warrior raises the cumbrous weapon on his shield, and hav=
ing got within=20



sword's length of his enemy, lets it drop on his head.  This portion of a b=
lack's frame is undeniably=20

hard; but such a blow would crush it like an egg-shell; and as he may be cr=
edited with sufficient=20

sense to know this, it seems difficult to understand why he should stand st=
ill and allow such a=20

disagreeable operation to be performed.  Whether or not the use of these we=
apons has been=20

discovered since I left Australia, I am unable to say; but certainly up to =
that time we who lived in=20

their neighbourhood were unable to appreciate the varied excellencies they =
doubtless possess.=20

We pursued our way up the Mackay River in hopes of finding some termination=
 to the thick scrub=20

on the opposite bank, so that we might return to our boat without having to=
 thread its intricate=20

mazes again; and in this we were successful, finding a break in the jungle =
an hour before sunset,=20

which at once admitted us to the plain, through the centre of which ran the=
 Macalister, and in due=20

course we reached our camp, where, after having a glorious "bogey" (the Aus=
tralian term for=20

bathing) in the river, and overhauling each other well, to see that no tick=
s were adhering to our=20

skins, we had supper, and turned in, having done little good, except findin=
g a road to the Mackay=20

less tedious than the one we had taken in the morning.  The ticks that I me=
ntioned just now, are=20

little insects no bigger than a pin's head when they first fasten on to you=
, but soon become swollen=20

with blood until larger than a pea.  They do no harm to a man besides the u=
npleasant feeling they=20

occasion, but they almost invariably kill a dog. Nearly all our dogs fell v=
ictims sooner or later to=20

either the alligator or the tick.   HOW WE EXPLORED THE MACKAY RIVER.  We n=
ow determined=20

to carry with us enough tea, sugar, and flour to last for a week, and to wo=
rk up towards the=20

unknown country at the head of the Mackay, leaving the boat in its present =
position, under the=20

charge of two men.  We intended to push towards the range whence both the M=
acalister and the=20

Mackay rivers drew their supply; and as the former stream in its windings o=
ver the open plain=20

approached within a mile of its large neighbour, we resolved to move the bo=
at a little further up=20

before starting on our new expedition.  By occasionally lightening her, and=
 dragging her over the=20

shallows, this was accomplished in a couple of hours, and we finally halted=
 at a bend in the river=20

where the bank was high enough to shield the boat from all observation, whi=
lst the scrub bordering=20

the Mackay, standing at less than a quarter of a mile distant, the men left=
 behind could easily see=20

if any considerable body of blacks moved between the two streams, and could=
 take the bearings=20

of all smoke arising from fires in the direction of the coast, so that we m=
ight visit them hereafter, if=20

deemed necessary.  The fact of two rivers, each containing a constant suppl=
y of water, being=20

found in such close proximity to each other, caused much remark, for none o=
f us had ever=20

observed a similar instance in Australia, which is as a rule very deficient=
 in permanent rivers.  We=20

now turned our attention to getting sufficient provisions cooked to last th=
e exploring party for three=20

days, as we were determined to employ the utmost vigilance, and show as lit=
tle smoke as=20

possible, for nothing creates such suspicion amongst the aboriginals as see=
ing fresh fires=20

constantly lighted, unless accompanied by the smoke signals, which I have d=
escribed in a former=20

chapter.  As we were utterly ignorant of the code they employed, we resolve=
d only to light our fires=20

at night, and not even then unless we found some sequestered spot where the=
 flame would be=20

unseen.  Some of us at once started for a large lagoon that we had passed i=
n the morning, and=20

creeping up through the long grass, found its surface quite covered with wa=
ter-fowl of every=20

description, from the black swan to the beautiful pigmy goose.  A volley, f=
ired at a concerted=20

signal, strewed the surface of the lake with the dead and wounded, and we w=
ere compelled to=20



stand idly on the bank until the wind wafted the game ashore, for at the re=
port of the guns two or=20

three heavy splashes and as many dusky forms gliding into the water betoken=
ed that we had=20

disturbed alligators, either having a nap, or lying in wait for kangaroos a=
nd wallaby coming down to=20

drink. More than one house now stands on the margin of this lagoon, but the=
ir inhabitants are still=20

afraid to bathe in the broad sheet of water spread so invitingly before the=
m.  Having secured our=20

game, we returned to the boat, and after plucking and splitting open the bi=
rds, some were roasted=20

over the fire for immediate use, but by far the greater number were boiled =
in a pot, which was=20

portion of the boat's furniture when on an expedition.  One of the troopers=
 had with a tomahawk=20

stripped off a sheet of bark, and on this was manufactured a gigantic dampe=
r.  For the information=20

of such of my readers as may be unacquainted with Australia, I must explain=
 that damper is=20

unleavened bread, well kneaded and baked in the ashes.  But simple though s=
uch a rough form of=20

loaf may seem from the above description, it is in reality a very difficult=
 thing to turn out a=20

thoroughly good damper, and only practice will enable the new-comer to obta=
in the sleight of hand=20

Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non prof=
it 501(c)(3)=20

educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississipp=
i and granted tax=20

exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or fede=
ral tax identification=20

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archi=
ve Foundation are tax=20

deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state=
's laws.  The=20

Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the mailing add=
ress: PO Box 750175,=20

Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its volunteers and employees are scattered through=
out numerous=20

locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 or three inches=
 thick, and from one to=20

two feet in diameter. Great care and much practice are requisite to form th=
is shape so that no=20

cracks shall appear, and when this is done the work is by no means over, fo=
r the exact heat of the=20

fire must be judged by the cook, otherwise he will either burn up his dough=
, or it will come out a=20

crude, sodden, uneatable mass.  A good wood fire that has been burning seve=
ral days, and has=20

gained a quantity of ashes, is the best; but wood is plentiful enough in th=
e bush, and if you only=20

know the right kind to use, you find no difficulty in soon providing yourse=
lf with a glorious heap of=20

glowing embers.  Scraping away a hole in the centre of the fire a little la=
rger than the disc, you=20

gently drop it in with your hands, strew it over with enough powdery white =
ash to prevent the=20

embers coming into actual contact with the dough, and then cover the whole =
with the glowing=20

coals.  Only practice can enable the bushman to judge the exact depth of th=
is layer, which, of=20

course, differs in every case, according to the size of the damper.  It is =
left in this fiery bed until=20

small cracks appear on the covering caused by the steam forcing its way out=
.  This is a sign that it=20

is nearly done, confirmation of which is sought by introducing a knife-blad=
e through the ashes, and=20

sounding the crust.  If this gives back a hard sound, the damper may be con=
sidered cooked, and is=20

then withdrawn, stood carefully 'on its edge'--never forget this--and is re=
ady to eat when cool.  As=20

there was nothing very particular to do that afternoon, we watched the troo=
pers spearing fish, in=20

which they were most skilful.  There is in some of the Australian rivers a =
splendid fish, called the=20

'Barrimundi', which not only much resembles the salmon in appearance, but, =
like it, requires=20

running water and access to the sea.  Many a time I have vainly tried to lu=

THE PIT TOWN CORONET.       CHAPTER 1.    IN THE ROSE GARDEN.   Big Reginal=
d Haggard=20

had been exceedingly attentive to the elder of two very pretty girls of the=
 name of Warrender. Both=20

families came from the eastern counties. The Warrenders had inhabited The W=
arren, or at all=20

events the older portion of the house, for nearly four centuries. They were=
 harmless people. They=20

manfully stuck to their ancestral acres of fat Essex land. The present head=
 of the family farmed the=20

greater part of the estate himself, as his fathers had done before him. Man=
y a Warrender had held=20

the rich living of King's Warren, and the parson, whoever he might be, and =
the reigning Squire=20

Warrender were always the two greatest men in King's Warren village and par=
ish.  In the rather=20

old-fashioned garden at The Warren sat a young lady, an open book upon her =
lap; the book was=20

not a novel, it was an argumentative work, a book which dealt with the soci=
al problems of the day.=20

But, alas! the book which Georgina Warrender had brought out with the serio=
us intention of=20

reading, for the Warrenders of either sex, though always soft-hearted, were=
 a hard-headed race,=20

lay upside down upon her lap. The fact is that she was weighing a man in th=
e balance, an=20

interesting occupation for a lady, and, alas! finding him a little wanting.=
 Georgie Warrender had=20

received a great deal of attention during the London season. Her people wer=
e well-to-do, the=20

ancestral freeholds were unencumbered, her family was eminently respectable=
 and well known,=20

her connections unimpeachable; but Miss Warrender's principal attraction to=
 those who had the=20

privilege of her acquaintance outside the world of balls, dinner parties an=
d musical evenings, was=20

the sturdy open-heartedness of her character, which often distinguishes wel=
l brought-up young=20

ladies who have been reared in an atmosphere at once intelligent and health=
y, but not ultra-

intellectual. Miss Warrender had no craze. She played and sang sufficiently=
 well, but not well=20

enough to be a terror to the home circle. She drew and sketched, as a pasti=
me, but she had no=20

desire to compete with professional artists, nor was her conversation inter=
larded with the jargon of=20

the craft. Her reading had been carefully directed by her governess, Miss H=
ood, who had=20

remained to discharge the onerous duties of chaperon, guide, philosopher, a=
nd, above all, friend=20

to Georgie Warrender and her cousin Lucy.  Lucy Warrender was Georgie's cou=
sin on the father's=20

side. Colonel Warrender, as the younger brother, was naturally intended for=
 the family living of=20



King's Warren. But fiery young George Warrender declined the Church altoget=
her, so he was sent=20

to Hailybury, and then he became a soldier of John Company, and was soon kn=
own as Fighting=20

George Warrender, and by dint of following his own bent attained the colone=
lcy of a native=20

regiment. Then he had a good determined shake at the pagoda tree. And then =
he made a fool of=20

himself, for just as he had come down to Bombay, having made up his mind to=
 take two years'=20

leave, he was smitten by the blonde beauty of a newly-imported "spin," fres=
h from the boarding-

school; and being an impulsive man, Colonel George Warrender married the li=
ttle boarding-school=20

miss, and changed his mind about his furlough. Within a year his daughter L=
ucy was born. And=20

then the cholera came to Bebreabad, swept off Colonel Warrender and his pal=
e-faced child-wife;=20

and the little Lucy, his orphan daughter, came home at once in charge of an=
 ayah in the=20

Company's ship "Lord Clive." On her arrival Squire Warrender pitied the lit=
tle misery, as she was=20

called by everybody, and treated her as his own daughter. There was but two=
 years' difference=20

between the girls, and they looked upon each other as sisters. The squire's=
 wife had died within a=20

year of his daughter's birth, so that practically neither of the cousins ha=
d ever known a mother's=20

care. Squire Warrender's wife had been a local beauty, and her portrait, wh=
ich hung in Mr.=20

Warrender's study, represented a loveliness of no common type.  Both the gi=
rls rode well, but=20

neither was horsey nor doggy. One of the greatest attractions in everybody'=
s eyes about Georgie=20

Warrender was her openness; she never had a secret from Miss Hood, her fath=
er, or her cousin.=20

In fact, secrecy was foreign to her nature. As to her appearance, she was a=
 see them in the=20

Macalister, lying with their heads pointed up stream, and seemingly motionl=
ess but for the slight=20

waving of the tail that retained them in their places.  Having cut several =
slender switches, not=20

thicker than a tobacco-pipe stem, and sharpened one end with a knife, the t=
rooper Ferdinand, who=20

was by far the most expert among his brethren, grasped this apparently inof=
fensive little weapon=20

between the thumb and middle finger, whilst the blunt end rested against th=
e ball of the forefinger.=20

Stooping down, he approached to within four or five yards of the fish, whic=
h were only a few=20

inches from the surface, and suddenly jerking his switch forward, it entere=
d the water almost=20

horizontally, and rarely failed to transfix a 'Barri mundi', which, darting=
 forward, was soon=20

hampered by the weapon catching in the weeds, and became the prey of its sh=
arp-eyed captor,=20

who had never lost sight of it in its endeavour to escape.  This fish is ex=
cellent eating, and=20

averages from eight to thirty pounds in weight.  As Dunmore and I were stro=
lling along a small=20

lagoon overgrown with water-lilies, he pointed out to me a pretty graceful =
little bird, about the size=20

of a jack-snipe, but with longer legs, and most extraordinary claws. I am a=
shamed to say I shot this=20

poor little fellow, to examine him, and found that each toe measured at lea=
st three inches from the=20

leg to the extremity of the claw.  This is to enable the bird to run along =
safely over the floating=20

leaves of the lotus, on which plant it seems to get its living.  I had neve=
r seen one before; and the=20

simple manner in which Nature had adapted it to its peculiar line of life s=
truck me as both curious=20

and beautiful.  What this little bird's scientific name is I never heard, b=
ut we colonists call it the=20

"Lotus bird."  As there was a remote chance of the party left with the boat=
s coming in contact with=20

the blacks, it was deemed advisable to leave them a trooper, who would more=
 readily recognise=20

their whereabouts than the white men; therefore a boy known by the not euph=
onious sobriquet of=20

"Killjoy," was selected to remain with the pilot and his two boatmen, and a=
fter dividing the big meat=20

damper in five equal portions, the exploring party, consisting of Dunmore, =
Ferdinand, Larry, Lizzie=20



and myself, struck out for the opening in the scrub on the Mackay river. We=
 descended into the=20

sandy bed, and crossed to the opposite side, which was much more open count=
ry, consisting of=20

park-like land, lightly timbered, but the soil not nearly so rich as the fe=
rtile plain through which=20

wound the Macalister.  It would be tedious to weary my readers with a minut=
e account of our=20

doings each day; enough to say that we passed through new country of every =
description,=20

crossing from side to side of the Mackay, to cut off its many bends, and th=
at our progress was but=20

slow, the distant ranges seeming hardly nearer on the third day than they w=
ere at starting.  We=20

were disappointed in not meeting with any blacks, though their traces were =
plentiful; and we had=20

commenced to fear that the tribe we had surprised five days before had give=
n warning of our=20

approach, when Ferdinand reported smoke a couple of miles on our right.  It=
 was about mid-day=20

when this was seen; and having made a hurried meal off the damper, which I =
may here state=20

answered its purpose admirably, we crept towards the fire with the utmost c=
aution. Our route took=20

us away from the river, and on arriving at the edge of a small belt of scru=
b, we could make out that=20

the fire was by the side of a water-hole, but the two hundred yards between=
 it and ourselves was=20

so open, that surprising the camp seemed almost impossible.  The hour was i=
n our favour, for the=20

blacks were lying about listlessly, resting themselves after the fatigues o=
f procuring the food of=20

which they had just made a meal.  They numbered about twenty of both sexes,=
 and were evidently=20

quite unconscious of our proximity.  Detaching the two troopers to make a d=
etour, and cut them off=20

from the scrub in that direction, Dunmore, Lizzie, and I remained perfectly=
 motionless for above an=20

hour, and then, judging that the boys must have reached their position, we =
advanced towards the=20

camp swiftly but silently. We got over a third of the distance before the b=
lacks saw us, and then=20

ensured a general scrimmage.  The women and children jumped into the lagoon=
, and the men,=20

snatching up their weapons, threw a volley of spears with such force and pr=
ecision that, had we=20

been twenty yards closer, it would have gone hard with both my companions a=
nd myself.  As it=20

was, the missiles nearly all fell short, seeing which the warriors dropped =
their arms and took to=20

their heels, running directly for the spot where Ferdinand and Larry lay in=
 ambush.  Both Dunmore=20

and myself fired our carbines over the heads of the retreating Myalls (wild=
 blacks), which=20

completed their panic, and one of them, rushing recklessly forward, was cap=
tured by the troopers,=20

and brought by them in triumph to the camp, amidst the yells and jabbering =
of the gins and=20

piccaninnies.  After half an hour or so, seeing that no harm was intended t=
o them, the women=20

came out of the water, and we were very much pleased to find that they read=
ily understood Lizzie.=20

On being addressed by her, the warrior, who had hitherto maintained a sulle=
n and defiant attitude,=20

became conversational, and readily replied to all the questions put to him =
by Dunmore.  Unlike=20

most of the blacks, he appeared to be very little frightened at the situati=
on in which he found=20

himself, and seemed instinctively to know that all danger was past.  On bei=
ng questioned=20

regarding the shipwrecked crew, he denied all knowledge of any vessel havin=
g been lost, but said=20

at once that a white man had lived with this tribe for many moons, though h=
e was dead now.  This=20

rather astonished us, and we asked if any relics were still in the camp, up=
on which one of the gins=20

produced an old sheath-knife, worn down nearly to nothing by constant sharp=
ening; half a dozen=20

horn buttons, one of them still sewn to a fragment of moleskin; and an empt=
y tin match-box.  We=20

asked how long the white man had been dead, and were told that he died thre=
e moons before, of=20

fever, and that we could see his grave if we liked, for it was within a day=
's journey. There was an=20



openness about this tribe, and a frankness in their answers, that made us c=
ertain that all we heard=20

was the truth, and as they had evidently befriended this poor wanderer, we =
were anxious to repay=20

them in some measure, and strengthen the kindly feelings they felt for the =
white men, so we told=20

Lizzie to assure them that our visit was only to search for our lost brethr=
en; that we should like to=20

visit the grave, if one of them would guide us; and that in return for thei=
r services we would give=20

them a new knife and a tomahawk.  As they were profoundly ignorant of the u=
se of fire-arms, and=20

we wished to impress upon them the irresistible power of the white man, it =
was agreed that we=20

should ask them to guide us to the nearest place frequented by kangaroos, a=
nd pick off two or=20

three of these animals in their presence, if possible.  They were very curi=
ous to know the meaning=20

of our "lightning sticks," and we repaired, escorted by nearly the whole tr=
ibe, to a neighbouring=20

water-hole, where we could remain concealed, and get an easy shot at any ga=
me coming down to=20

drink.  We were not kept long waiting, for within half an hour a couple of =
wallabies came hopping=20

leisurely along, and were very cleverly dropped in their tracks, one by Dun=
more, the other by=20

Larry.  Our hosts were in ecstasies, and seemed very grateful that a simila=
r fate had not befallen=20

some of their number in the morning; but we made Lizzie explain to them cle=
arly that our object=20

was not to hurt our black friends, unless they were wicked--ill-treating wh=
ite men, or spearing=20

cattle.  A couple of noble emus now came stalking slowly towards the water,=
 and, passing within=20

forty yards of our hiding-place, both fell victims to the breechloaders of =
Dunmore and myself.  This=20

beautiful bird inhabits the open country throughout Australia, where at one=
 time it was very=20

common, but is now rarely seen in the settled districts.  However, in the n=
orth emus may be found=20

in plenty; and I do not think there is the slightest fear of their becoming=
 extinct, as some writers=20

suggest.  All my readers must have seen this bird at the Zoological Gardens=
, and remarked its=20

likeness to the ostrich, both in form and habits; but the prisoner portrays=
 but poorly the free=20

majestic gait of the wild inhabitant of the plains.  The colour of the adul=
t bird is a greyish brown,=20

the feathers are very loose and hairy, whilst the height of a fine male is =
often nearly seven feet.=20

The usual mode of capturing these birds is to ride them down, using dogs tr=
ained for the purpose=20

to pull them to the ground.  The dogs should be taught to reserve their att=
ack until the emu is=20

thoroughly tired out, and then to spring upon the neck; but an unwary puppy=
 will bitterly rue his=20

temerity should he come within reach of the powerful legs, which deal kicks=
 fiercely around, and of=20

sufficient power to disable any assailant.  The ostrich always kicks forwar=
d, in which he differs=20

from the emu, whose blow is delivered sideways and backwards, like a cow.  =
This bird is very=20

good eating, if you know the part to select; the legs proving tough and unp=
alatable, while the back=20

is nearly as tender as fowl.  But to the bushman the most valuable thing ab=
out the emu is its oil,=20

which is looked upon as a sovereign remedy for bruises or sprains when rubb=
ed into the affected=20

part either pure or mixed with turpentine.  This useful oil is of a light y=
ellow colour, and from=20


_
fully justifying the raptures and rhapsodies of her numerous admirers. But =
it is not with her=20

appearance that we are at present concerned, but with the subject of her me=
ditations.  That=20

subject was a serious one, for in her pocket was a formal proposal from Reg=
inald Haggard, whom=20

she had known as "Big Reginald Haggard" from her childhood. It is probably =
an axiom that every=20

English girl, under ordinary circumstances, accepts her first offer; the re=
ason of this is not very=20

manifest, but it is nevertheless a fact, and its being a fact is doubtless =
one of the causes of the=20

numerous ill-assorted matches that constantly take place. But Miss Warrende=
r, now twenty years=20

of age, had been an exception to the rule. During her first and successful =
London season, now just=20

over, she had refused three serious offers. The first was from an impecunio=
us young barrister,=20

who had attained some repute in the literary world, and had very nearly kil=
led himself in the=20

process. Mr. Baliol had admired Miss Warrender, had made careful inquiries =
as to her father's=20

position, had discovered that the two girls would probably be the old man's=
 heiresses, and had=20

promptly proposed to Georgie. He had been as promptly refused. Mr. Baliol w=
as in no wise=20

disconcerted. He immediately proceeded to dedicate his new novel, "A Woman'=
s Fickle Heart," "to=20

Miss G---- W----, in token of respectful admiration." Baliol scored another=
 success at is in much=20

request for cleaning the locks of fire-arms.  It chiefly resides in the ski=
n, but also collects in great=20

quantities near the rump.  The usual mode of obtaining it is to pluck out a=
ll the feathers, cut the=20

skin into small pieces, and boil them in a common pot; but a still simpler =
plan, though less=20

productive, is to hang the skin before a fire, and catch the oil as it drip=
s down.  A full-sized bird will=20

yield from six to seven quarts.  The food of the emu consists of grass and =
various fruits. It emits a=20

deep drumming sound from its throat, but no other cry, that I ever heard.  =
Its nest is only a shallow=20

hole scraped in the ground, and in this hollow the eggs, which vary in numb=
er, are laid.  Dr.=20

Bennett remarks that "There is always an odd number, some nests having been=
 discovered with=20

nine, others with eleven, and others again with thirteen."  When fresh they=
 are of a beautiful green=20

colour, and are in much request for mounting in silver as drinking cups; bu=
t after a little while the=20

colour changes to a dirty brownish green.  One peculiarity about the next i=
s, that the parent bird=20

never goes straight up to it, but walks round and round in a narrowing circ=
le, of which the nest is=20

the centre.  I once caught seven little emus, only just out of the shell; b=
ut shutting them up for the=20

night in an empty room, I was horrified the next morning to find that they =
had all been killed by=20

rats.  The=20


_
to trouble himself any more about Miss G---- W----.  Georgina's second prop=
osal was of a more=20

serious nature. Young Lord Spunyarn had made her an offer. Lord Spunyarn de=
sired an=20

ornamental wife. To him the ideal Lady Spunyarn was a young person respecta=
bly connected,=20

good-tempered, and of prepossessing appearance. Not one iota did Spunyarn c=
are for money,=20

birth or brains; of money he had plenty and to spare: as to birth, was he n=
ot Lord Spunyarn? as to=20

brains, clever women were considered bores by his lordship. The young noble=
man liked Georgie=20

Warrender, and he liked her people. Though rejected, rather to his astonish=
ment, it made no=20

difference in his friendship with the family. "It's an awful bore, you know=
. Unluckily they all know it=20

at the club--I mean that I was going to make you an offer--and I heard that=
 one of the society=20

journals had the announcement of our engagement already in type. You see, I=
 was to have dined=20

here to-morrow. If you don't mind, I'll come all the same." He did come, di=
d full justice to the=20

dinner, sat next to Georgie, whom he took down, and the pair, thoroughly he=
artwhole, had a great=20

deal to say to each other.  Georgina's next experience was of a more comic =
character; her=20

conquest was no longer a nobleman, but a "noble." Jones di Monte-Ferrato wa=
s a Maltese noble.=20

He possessed certain rights of nobility in the island, his income was deriv=
ed from the sale of=20

Maltese oranges; in fact he was the titular head of Jones and Co., the well=
-known fruit house of=20

Thames Street. In Thames Street, Jones di Monte-Ferrato said nothing about =
his nobility, he was=20

"our Mr. Jones." But on his visiting cards was a portentous crown, and Jone=
s di Monte-Ferrato=20

habitually wore a coloured _boutonniere_ in his frock coat; being red, this=
 decoration was=20

popularly supposed to be the Legion of Honour: it had been purchased howeve=
r, and purchased=20

cheaply, from the Pope. Jones' nobility carried him far in Maida Vale and B=
ayswater. Needless to=20

tell, Miss Warrender would have nothing to say to him.  To say that Georgie=
 Warrender=20

longitudinal stripes down the back, which disappear as they grow up. The em=
u is easily=20

domesticated, and on many cattle and sheep stations tame specimens are funn=
ing about the=20

paddocks.  To my mind they are an intolerable nuisance, always doing some m=
ischief--either=20

frightening the horses, or stealing things from the workmen.  I saw one cur=
ed of his thievish=20

propensities for a long time.  He always loafed about the kitchen when dinn=
er was being served,=20

and if the cook turned his back for a moment, his long neck was thrust thro=
ugh the window, and=20

anything within reach--from an onion to a salt-spoon--disappeared with marv=
ellous celerity.  But=20

my friend caught a tartar when he bolted two scalding potatoes, steaming fr=
om the pot.  He rushed=20

round and round the little paddock, and at last dropped down as if dead, fr=
om pain and fatigue.=20

Poor wretch, he must have suffered dreadfully; and I am sure we all pitied =
him, except the cook,=20

whose patience he had quite worn out.  Out sable allies were gratified beyo=
nd measure when we=20

presented them with the game, and a great feast took place that evening.  W=
e neglected no=20

opportunity of gaining information about both the shipwrecked crew and the =
unknown white man,=20

whose grave we were to visit on the following morning. Through Lizzie we qu=
estioned different=20

individuals separately, but they all agreed that such an event as the loss =
of a vessel and the arrival=20

of her crew amongst the blacks, could not possibly have happened without th=
eir hearing=20

something of it.  From their imperfect knowledge of time, and their difficu=
lty in expressing any=20

number higher than five, we could not form the slightest idea how long the =
white man had lived=20

among them; but they pointed to the ranges behind the township of Cardwell =
as indicating the=20

place where he first joined them.  We camped at the opposite end of the wat=
er-hole, not thinking it=20



judicious to remain too close to our allies, and kept a strict watch during=
 the night; but we might all=20

have enjoyed a good sleep in perfect safety, for the blacks were far=20


_
Haggard's letter, is nothing but the truth. Of course she liked young Hagga=
rd, but so did every one.=20

Haggard had enjoyed an extraordinary popularity. Related as he was to the E=
arl of Pit Town, he=20

was a welcome guest in the best houses. He had been a dancing man, and coul=
d dance well, was=20

exceedingly good-looking, and consequently a catch at the small and earlies=
 and also at more=20

elaborate entertainments. When a very young man he had been a detrimental, =
having rapidly=20

dissipated his little fortune. Penniless, he went to America; in eight year=
s he returned, well off, as=20

good-looking as ever, and with the possibility, the extremely unlikely poss=
ibility, of one day=20

succeeding to the earldom of Pit Town. There are some men who always fall o=
n their feet, some=20

men for whom fortune is never tired of turning up trumps; Haggard was one o=
f these men. When it=20

is said that Haggard was a man of the world in its broadest sense, nothing =
remains to tell. If he=20

had a religion at all it was the worship of his own dear self. Big Reginald=
 remembered Georgie=20

Warrender as a chit of twelve; he met her again one of the brightest orname=
nts of London society;=20

he heard her spoken of there as handsome Miss Warrender; and just as he wou=
ld have longed for=20

a very valuable hunter to carry his sixteen stone to hounds, so he desired =
to obtain Georgie's=20

hand; because without doubt she was the handsomest, healthiest, pleasantest=
 and most=20

unexceptionable girl it had ever been his good fortune to come across.  The=
 letter seemed honest=20

enough, it was short and to the point.      "DEAR MISS WARRENDER,      "You=
 will probably not=20

be surprised at my addressing you on a     subject important to us both. We=
 have known each=20

other since the     time when you were a little girl and I was a big bad bo=
y. I     don't trouble you=20

with business matters, but I have spoken to     Mr. Warrender and fully sat=
isfied him on that head.=20

It is with     his approbation that I ask you to become my wife. I know tha=
t     the very remote=20

possibility of a coronet will not weigh with     you, but I do think you ou=
ght to let it count against my=20

disadvantages. You will get this at breakfast time. I shall ride     over a=
bout eleven to urge my suit=20

in person; may I hope that     your good nature will spare me the negative =
I doubtless deserve,=20

and that you will give me a chance?                  "Yours very affectiona=
tely,=20

"REGINALD HAGGARD."  As Georgie replaced the letter in its envelope she blu=
shed; had=20

Haggard been indifferent to her she would not have hung out this signal of =
distress. It is impossible=20

to follow the course of reasoning of a woman's mind. Georgie Warrender was =
no raw girl to be=20

caught by the mere good looks of big Reginald. But first impressions go a g=
reat way; she=20

remembered the young fellow in the reckless daring of his first youth; she =
remembered, too, her=20

feeling of pity when she heard of the prodigal's banishment to a far countr=
y to feed the proverbial=20

swine. Georgie remembered, too, the triumphant return of that prodigal some=
 six months ago. She=20

had been pleased at the prodigal's attentions, and she knew that many girls=
, of far greater social=20

pretensions than her own, would willingly have accepted the addresses of th=
e bronzed, curly-

headed giant with the big moustache. Perhaps she would have been wiser had =
she taken counsel=20

with Miss Hood, or had she deliberated more calmly. But Georgie was a self-=
reliant girl. Even now=20

she heard the measured tread of her lover's hack as he trotted up to the ha=
ll door of The Warren.=20

She looked at her watch, it wanted five minutes of the hour. Miss Warrender=
 smiled at her lover's=20

excessive punctuality; his impatience boded well she thought.  Another inst=
ant and he is striding=20

down the path of the rose garden; a happy look is on his face, though it is=
 slightly pale with=20

suppressed excitement. Georgie Warrender's pink roses attain a damask hue a=
s she rises to greet=20

him.  Fortune, fickle goddess, still befriends her favourite. There was no =
outward sign of hesitation=20



or diffidence about Haggard, as he held out his hand to Miss Warrender.  "I=
t's very good of you to=20

see me; I'm afraid I don't deserve it," he said, seating himself beside her=
 on the rustic bench, and,=20

man-like, commencing to bore holes in the gravel with the stout ash-plant w=
hich he carried. Youth=20

and maid decorously continued to gaze upon the ground and to critically stu=
dy their own foot=20

coverings. Haggard was a man who looked well in any dress, but the grey twe=
ed suit which he=20

wore, the artistic bit of red of his loosely-tied sailor's knot, his big gr=
ey felt hat, his leggings also of=20

tweed, even his stout but well-made lace-up boots seem to give the young gi=
ant the needful halo=20

of romance. This, the usual morning dress of a young English gentleman in t=
he country, is what is=20

generally selected as the costume of the hero of an Adelphi drama, when tha=
t wonderful young=20

man is discovered in his virtuous home prior to the commencement of his num=
erous sufferings=20

and hair-breadth escapes. As for Georgie, the conventional French muslin se=
t off her faultless=20

figure, a large Leghorn hat protected her delicate complexion from the sun'=
s rays, her magnificent=20

hair was worn in the rather severe Grecian style, but then the big plait at=
 the back was all her own,=20

and the bronze chestnut locks, tightly strained as they were around her hea=
d, disclosed the small=20

shell-like ear, that sign of breeding which it is impossible to counterfeit=
. Probably Georgie=20

Warrender had been right when, as a girl, she had declined to have those pr=
etty ears pierced. If=20

we accept the hypothesis that beauty unadorned is adorned the most, then Ge=
orgie in her native=20

loveliness was, indeed, highly decorated. meat to think of treachery.  Befo=
re sunrise we started,=20

guided by our late captive and two of his companions.  After a tedious walk=
, we arrived at an open=20

plain, on which the grass was trodden down in every direction, in some plac=
es worn quite away by=20

the feet of the natives--for this was the great "bora ground" of the coast =
tribes, where the mystic=20

ceremonies mentioned in a former chapter took place. Traversing the sacred =
plain, our thoughts=20

busy in conjecturing the weird scenes that the posts had witnessed, we came=
 to a little creek=20

whose clear stream babbled cheerfully among the rocks, and soon saw a giant=
 fig-tree, which our=20

guides indicated as being the spot we sought. As we approached we perceived=
 a greyish-looking=20

form on a large limb about ten feet from the ground, and a closer inspectio=
n revealed to us that it=20

was unmistakably the body of a white man, rolled up in tea-tree bark, and k=
ept in its position by=20

fastenings of split cane.  We could not examine the corpse very minutely, f=
or it was too offensive;=20

but from the portions of the face that still remained, and the long blonde =
locks and red beard, we=20

satisfied ourselves that the poor wanderer was not one of the 'Eva's' crew;=
 indeed, we judged that=20

his death must have taken place some time before the loss of that vessel.  =
We were much pleased=20

to observe the respect with which the natives had treated the remains, and =
as they think that=20

exposure either on a platform or in a tree is the most honourable way in wh=
ich a corpse can be=20

disposed of, we left the body as we found it, and returned to the camp, whe=
re we passed the night.=20

Our damper was now at an end, and we had no flour with us, so made up our m=
inds to return to=20

the boat.  On talking the matter over, it seemed quite clear that the shipw=
recked men had never=20

been thrown on this part of the coast, and that any further exploration wou=
ld only be lost time. On=20

the following morning we presented the tribe with our knives, and some matc=
hes, and taking a=20

friendly leave of them, started for the Macalister, accompanied by two of t=
he warriors.  We reached=20

the boat on the sixth day, found the pilot and his party well, and having d=
ismissed the blacks, with=20

the present of a tomahawk and a blanket, we started at once for the place l=
ower down the river,=20

which had been agreed upon with Jack Clark as a rendezvous.  When we arrive=
d at this spot on=20



the following day, the horsemen had not turned up, so we amused ourselves a=
s best we could,=20

fishing, shooting, and eating damper thickly plastered over with honey, for=
 Larry had found a=20

"sugar bag."  The way the trooper performed this feat was not a little inge=
nious. Having noticed=20

several bees about, he caught one, and with a little gum, attached to it a =
piece of down from a=20

large owl that somebody had shot.  Releasing the insect, it flew directly t=
owards its nest, the=20

unaccustomed burden with which it was laden serving not only to make it eas=
ily visible, but also=20

impeding its flight sufficiently to admit of the boy following it.  The nex=
t was at the top of a large=20

blue gum tree, about three feet in diameter, and sending up a smooth column=
 for fifty feet without=20

a branch or twig. Most people would have given up all thoughts of a honey f=
eed for the day; not so=20

Mr. Larry, whose movements we followed with considerable curiosity. Divesti=
ng himself of his=20

clothing, he repaired to an adjoining scrub, and with his tomahawk cut out =
a piece of lawyer cane=20

twenty feet in length. Having stripped this of its husk, he wove it into a =
hoop round the tree of just=20

sufficient size to admit his body.  Slinging his tomahawk and a fishing-lin=
e round his neck, he got=20

inside the hoop, and allowing it to rest against the small of his back, he =
pressed hard against the=20

tree with his knees and feet.  This raised him several inches, when with a =
dexterous jerk he moved=20

the portion of the hoop furthest away from him a good foot up the stem, and=
 thus--somewhat on=20

the same principle that boys climb a chimney, for the hoop represented the =
chimney--he worked=20

himself upward, and in much less time than I have taken to describe it, was=
 astride on the lowest=20

branch, and chopping vigorously at the hollow which contained the golden st=
ore.  The use of the=20

fishing-line now became apparent, for we bent on to its end a small tin bil=
ly (round can), used for=20

making tea, and by hauling this up and filling it, Larry soon supplied us w=
ith honey enough to fill=20

our bucket and the boat's baler.  As perhaps my readers may be tempted to w=
onder why the bees=20

did not attack the naked hide of the robber who was thus rudely despoiling =
them, I must state that=20

the wild Australian bee is stingless.  It is a harmless little insect, not =
much larger than the common=20

house-fly, and though it produces abundance of honey and wax, it has not be=
en subjected to=20

domestication, and from its diminutive proportions and its habit of buildin=
g on very high trees,=20

probably never will be.  The English bee has been most successfully introdu=
ced into Queensland;=20

and many of the farms in the neighbourhood of Brisbane make a good thing ou=
t of their honey and=20

wax.  A meeting was held the next day, at which it was agreed that all furt=
her search would be=20

useless, and, indeed, I am certain that every possible measure had been att=
empted for the=20

discovery of the missing men.  There seems every reason to think that the i=
ll-fated 'Eva' was sunk=20

in the cyclone.  Most likely she went down in deep water, and all on board =
her were drowned.=20

Such was the supposition that received most favour at the time, and with it=
 we must rest content=20

until the great day when all secrets are revealed.          End of Project =
