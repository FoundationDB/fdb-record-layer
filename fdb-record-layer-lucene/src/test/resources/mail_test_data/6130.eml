The mineralogy and geology of the West-India islands has been, as yet, but little explored. The 

scientific world has, however, been favoured with some interesting articles from the pen of Dr. 

Nugent; and we are informed that he has described also the geology of the island of Antigua. We 

have recently become acquainted with one interesting production of this island, and without 

waiting for Dr. Nugent's account, (which we believe has not yet reached this country) we shall lay 

it before our readers.  We are under obligations to Mr. Pelatiah Perit, of New-York, for a collection 

of specimens of silicious petrifactions of wood from Antigua. Their characters are indubitable; the 

distinct ligneous layers corresponding with the annual growth, the medullary prolongations, the 

knots formed by branches, the cracks and the bark, are all distinctly visible. Some of the pieces 

are ponderous portions of large trees.  As to the mineralizing matter, it is evidently silicious, and 

the specimens are principally the holzstein of Werner; crystals of quartz are apparent in the 

cavities; some parts are agatized, and veins of chalcedony occasionally pervade the fissures: they 

are not impressible by steel, and give fire with it. According to the information of Mr. Perit, they are 

scattered over the surface of the Island of Antigua, with a profusion hardly less than that which 

Horneman observed of the same mineral during his travels over the eastern part of the great 

African desert.  It is much to be
