chronicles of Monstrelet are real history, wherein, notwithstanding its imp=

are found all the characteristics of historical writing. He traces events t=

the causes, and traces them with the minutest details; and what renders the=

precious is, his never-failing attention to report all edicts, declarations=

negotiations, treaties, &c. as justificatory proofs of the truth of the fac=
ts he relates.  =E2=80=98After the=20

example of Froissart, he does not confine himself to events that passed in =
France: he embraces,=20

with almost equal detail, the most remarkable circumstances which happened =
during his time in=20

Flanders, England, Scotland and Ireland. He relates, but more succinctly, w=
hatsoever he had been=20

informed of as having passed in Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland: in short, =
in the different=20

the king of Cyprus,=20
