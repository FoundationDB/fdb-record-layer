CONCLUDED AT COMPI=C3=88GNE.=E2=80=94AN ALLIANCE         BETWEEN THE DUKES =
OF ORLEANS=20

AND BURGUNDY.   This year, the quarrels were renewed between the dukes of B=
ar and Lorraine,=20

because the duke of Lorraine had straitly besieged, with a considerable for=
ce, a castle belonging=20

to the duke of Bar, which was partly in France, and had on this account bee=
n surrendered by the=20

marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, to the king of France. However, in=
 spite of this, the duke=20

of Lorraine took it; and as this conduct was highly displeasing to the king=
, a large army was=20

assembled in that part of France.  Sir Clugnet de Brabant, admiral of Franc=
e, was ordered to=20

march this army into Lorraine against the duke; but negotiations were enter=
ed into, so that the=20

army was dismissed, and all those preparations ended in nothing.  About thi=
s time, the queen of=20

France came to the town of Compi=C3=A8gne, accompanied by some of her child=
ren, namely, John=20

duke of Touraine, and Isabella, who had been queen of England. The dukes of=
 Orleans and=20

Burgundy came thither also, as did the duchess of Holland, wife to duke Wil=
liam count of Hainault,=20

with her daughter Jaqueline de Baviere, count Charles d=E2=80=99Angoul=C3=

to be seen any day in Washington. Two cases of the bluish-black discolorati=
on of the skin from=20

taking nitrate of silver have also come under my observation. Both occurred=
 in medical men, one=20

of whom lives in Florida, the other in the District of Columbia. Silver dis=
colorations of this kind are=20

indelible, but I learn from one of these gentlemen that large doses of iodi=
de of potassium cause=20

temporary fading of the discoloration, which returns on stopping the medici=
ne.[591]  The=20

_indelibility of tattoo-marks_ is such that their traces may be easily reco=
gnized in the cadaver,=20

though in a somewhat advanced stage of putrefaction. They have even been re=
cognized on a=20

gangrenous limb. Sometimes, however, it is impossible to recognize at first=
 sight whether there=20

has or has not been a tattoo. A strong light and a magnifying glass and a m=
icroscopic examination=20

of the neighboring ganglia to detect the presence of coloring matter may as=
sist in removing doubt.=20

It has been found on the bodies of tattooed cadavers that the ganglia are f=
illed with grains of=20

coloring matter of the same nature as that employed in making the tattoo. A=
ttempts to remove=20

tattoo-marks generally leave a vicious scar that is equally indelible. An e=
fficacious method is to=20

tattoo the mark with a solution of tannin, which is followed by brushing ov=
er with nitrate of silver. A=20

red cicatrix follows, and when the epidermis separates the tattoo disappear=
s. A better method,=20

however, is by means of the electric needle already mentioned in speaking o=
f the electrolysis of=20

great lords, by whom the above were attended in great state. The legate of =
the holy see at Rome,=20

with many bishops, doctors and churchmen, were likewise there,=E2=80=94when=
 marriages were=20

concluded between the duke of Touraine, second son to the king of France, a=
nd Jaqueline de=20

Baviere, and between Charles d=E2=80=99Orleans and Isabella, late queen of =
England.  Isabella was=20

cousin-german to Charles, who had been her godfather at her baptism; but no=
twithstanding this=20

difficulty, the marriage was accomplished by means of an apostolical dispen=
sation; and very great=20

feasts took place at Compi=C3=A8gne in consequence, consisting of dinners, =
dancings, justs and other=20

jollities.  A few days after, when every thing had been concluded, the duch=
ess of Holland and her=20

brother-in-law John of Bavaria, with the consent of the queen, the dukes be=
fore named, and the=20

royal council, took with them the new-married couple, John de Touraine and =
his bride, to Quesnoy=20

le remains of a cadaver, and the statistics of Caspar, Tardieu, and Hutin p=
lace it as high as nine in=20

the hundred. An officer of the United States Revenue Marine lately called m=
y attention to several=20

superficial tattooes on the back of his hand which had disappeared. The dee=
per ones, however,=20

remained. The _spontaneous disappearance of a tattoo_ seems to be possible =
when the operation=20

has been done in such a superficial way as not to have passed the rete Malp=
ighii, or when the=20

tattooing has been done with some substance not very tenacious, as vermilio=
n, which appears to=20

be easily eliminated. But when the particles of coloring matter penetrate i=
nto the fibro-elastic tissue=20

of the derma, the disappearance of the tattoo is rare.  In seventy-eight in=
dividuals tattooed with=20

vermilion alone, Hutin found eleven upon whom the tattoo had disappeared. O=
ut of one hundred=20

and four tattooes made with a single color, India-ink, writing ink, blue or=
=20


_
in Hainault, where duke William then resided, who received them most kindly=
, and entertained=20

them magnificently.  When these matters had been finished, and the dukes of=
 Orleans and=20

Burgundy had mutually promised love and friendship during their lives, the =
duke of Orleans=20

departed, and carried his daughter-in-law, Isabella, with his son to Ch=C3=
=A2teau-Thierry, which the=20

king, at the solicitation of the duke, had given him.  The queen and counci=
l returned to Paris to the=20

king, who had lately recovered from his illness; and the duke of Burgundy, =
with his attendants,=20

went to Artois and Flanders. He ordered about six hundred combatants from B=
urgundy to guard=20

the frontiers of the Boulonois, and make war on the English. They greatly d=
estroyed the country=20

round Bethune, because the count of Namur would not suffer his subjects to =
pay the duke of=20

Burgundy a tax which the king had lately allowed him to raise on the whole =
of Artois, for the=20

payment of these soldiers who were to guard the are identical if the tattoo=
es are made with two=20

colors. Thus in 153 tattooes with vermilion and India-ink, one instance sho=
wed a fading of the=20

black, in another it had completely disappeared, the red being well marked;=
 twenty times the red=20

was partly effaced, the black being well marked; and in sixteen cases the r=
ed had completely=20

disappeared, the black remaining visible.[592]  A tattoo-mark may sometimes=
 be altered, in which=20

case it proves deceptive as an index. A workman changing his trade seeks to=
 transform the=20

insignia of his first calling into those of the second, or a criminal in or=
der to avoid identity will make=20

a change. In the former instance the transformation is not difficult to det=
ect, but in the latter so=20

much care is required to recognize the change that penal science has relega=
ted the sign to a=20

secondary place.  As to the length of time since a tattoo-mark has been exe=
cuted, authorities are=20

that it is impossible to tell after two or three weeks. Whether a=20
