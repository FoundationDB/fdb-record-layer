d. This afternoon I sat and=20

listened while Socker, the janitor, told me one of his war stories."  "You =
must have had patience,"=20

interrupted Nat Anderson. "Bob cats and bombshells, but Socker is tiresome!=
"  "Well, I had an=20

object in it," explained Jack. "I wanted him to do me a favor, and he did i=
t--after I'd let him tell me=20

how, single-handed, he captured a lot of Confederates. I told him about thi=
s spread to-night, and=20

was lamenting the fact that my room was so small, and that we couldn't make=
 any noise, or have=20

any lights. And you know how awkward it is to eat in the dark."  "Sure," ad=
mitted Bony. "You can't=20

always find your mouth."  "And if there's anything I dislike," added Nat, "=
it's putting pie in my ear."=20

"Easy!" cautioned Jack at the laugh which followed. "Wait a few minutes and=
 we can make all the=20

noise we want to."  "How?" asked Bony.  "Because, as I'm trying to tell you=
, Socker did me a favor.=20

He's going to let us in the storeroom, back of where the boiler is, in the =
basement. It'll be nice and=20

 row we like, for=20

Martin can't hear us there."  "Good for you, Jack!" cried Nat.  "That's all=
 to the horse radish!"=20

observed Sam.  Jack's trip to town that afternoon had been most successful.=
 He had found at the=20

express office a big package from home, and from the note that accompanied =
it he knew it=20

contained good things to eat, made by his loving aunts. But, desiring to gi=
ve an unusually fine=20

spread to celebrate the occasion of having made the acquaintance of Will Wi=
lliams, Jack=20

purchased some other good things at the village stores.  He and Will carrie=
d them back to school,=20

and managed to smuggle them in. It was a new experience for Will to have a =
friend like Jack=20

Ranger, and to be taking part in this daring but harmless breach of the sch=
ool rules. Under this=20

stimulus Will was fast losing his melancholy mood, and he responded brightl=
y to Jack's jokes.=20

Will on parting after supper that night. Jack wanted to spring a sort of su=

introduce Will to them at the feast. In accordance with his instructions th=
e lads had gathered in his=20

room about ten o'clock that night, stealing softly in after Martin, the mon=
itor, had made his last=20

round to see that lights were out. Then Jack had announced his plan of havi=
ng the feast in the=20

basement.  "Grab up the grub and come on," said the leader a little later. =
"Softly now--no noise=20

until we're downstairs."  "Will Socker keep mum?" asked Bony.  "As an oyste=
r in a church sociable=20

stew," replied Jack. "I've promised to listen to another of his war tales."=
  "Jack's getting to be a=20

regular martyr," observed Sam.  "Silence in the ranks!" commanded Captain J=
ack.  The lads stole=20

softly along the corridors. Just as they got opposite the=20

"What's that?" whispered Jack softly.  "I--I dropped one of the pies," repl=
ied Bony, cracking his=20

knuckles at the double-quick in his excitement.  "Scoop it up and come on. =
You'll have to eat it,"=20

said Jack.  In fear and trembling they went on. Fortunately, Martin did not=
 hear the noise, and the=20

lads got safely past.  Jack, who was in the rear, paused at a door at the e=
nd of the hall, and=20

knocked softly.  "Yes," answered a voice from within.  "Come on," commanded=
 Jack, and he was=20

joined by a dark figure.  They reached the basement safely, no one having d=
isputed their night=20

march. Socker, the janitor, met them at the door of the boiler-room.  "Here=
 we are," said Jack.  "So=20

I see, Mr. Ranger. Why, it reminds me of the time when Captain Crawford and=
 me took a forced=20

night march of ten miles to get some rations. We were with Sherman, on his =
trip to the sea, and----

"Yes, Mr. Ranger. But I depend on you not to say anything about this to Dr.=
 Mead in case----"=20

"Oh, you can depend on us," Jack assured him.  "I thought I could. It remin=
