would leave by eight o'clock--for business appointments, he told her, at so=

He was putting through another big deal. At times, despite her efforts, ang=
ry suspicions would=20

arise. He was dealing with some men from the West. No doubt they had to be =
entertained. She=20

had heard a little of such entertaining from travelling men she had known a=
t home. "Oh, Ethel=20

Lanier, don't be so disgusting!" But after all, a man so tense all day in h=
is office needed some=20

gaiety at night.  She began to suggest going out in the evenings. They went=
 to "Butterfly" and=20

within a few days Fanny Carr called up and asked them to dinner and the pla=
y. Ethel made some=20

excuse and declined. She did not mention it to Joe, but that night he said =
gruffly, "Sorry you turned=20

Fanny down." And Ethel looked at him with a start. So Joe was seeing her th=
ese days!  "I haven't=20

been feeling very strong, Joe," she said in an unnatural tone.  "You've bee=
n to the opera twice this=20

week," was her husband's grim rejoinder.  And this was only one little inst=
ance of many that made=20

Ethel sure that Fanny Carr was still about. She was getting at Joe through =
his business side, going=20

to his office. She had asked him to sell her house on Long Island, and thro=
ugh this transaction she=20

had tangled him into her affairs. A lone woman, defenceless in business, ne=
eding the aid and=20

efore, having called and=20

noticed that a sofa and a rug were missing, had asked to what dealer Ethel =
had sold them. "Now,"=20

thought Ethel, "she'll buy them herself, and then she'll ask Joe to drop in=
 for tea at her hotel=20

apartment--'on business,' of course-but the rug and sofa will be there! Poo=

lone!" Ethel had some=20

lonely grapples with life. She was right, she angrily told herself, in want=
ing to go slowly until she=20

could discover real friends; but on the other hand she admitted that Joe ha=
d reason for being=20
