Several curious circumstances worked together to widen the breach between t=
he Calhoun and=20

Van Buren elements and at the same time to bring the President definitely i=
nto the ranks of the=20

New Yorker's supporters. One was the controversy over the social status of =
"Peggy" Eaton. Peggy=20

was the daughter of a tavern keeper, William O'Neil, at whose hostelry both=
 Jackson and Eaton=20

had lived when they were senators. Her first husband, a purser in the navy,=
 committed suicide at=20

sea; and Washington gossips said that he was driven to the act by chagrin c=
aused by his wife's=20

misconduct, both before and after her marriage. On the eve of Jackson's ina=
uguration the widow=20

became Mrs. Eaton, and certain disagreeable rumors connecting the names of =
the two were=20

confirmed in the public mind. When Eaton was made Secretary of War, society=
 shrugged its=20

shoulders and wondered what sort of figure "Peg O'Neil" would cut in Cabine=
t circles. The=20

question was soon answered. At the first official functions Mrs. Eaton was =
received with for you, in=20

all the ardor of youth, since love has harnessed me thus, I who am old and =
withered! I have=20

combined precept and example: it is for you to profit by them."  Sometimes =
the poet of the Fabliau=20

pauses to describe his heroine and her costume; now it is a lively country =
maiden, barefooted, with=20

her clothes all wet from the armful of water-cress she has gathered; now it=
 is a coquette finishing=20

her toilette before the mirror, which she makes a little page hold while sh=
e binds up her tresses=20

and flirts with him; and now it is a party of ladies seated in some castle =
bower, embroidering=20

heraldic devices on the banners of their knights. Then there is a jolly sto=
ry of three _commeres_ of=20

Paris, the wife of Adam de Gonesse, her niece Marie Clipe, and Dame Tifaign=
e, milliner, who tell=20

their husbands that they are going on a pilgrimage, oh! a pious pilgrimage,=
 on the feast of the=20

Three Kings of Cologne. They evade their watchful but too credulous spouses=
, and here they are=20

seated at an inn table, where one=20


_
Jackson was furious. It was enough for him that Mrs. Jackson had thought we=
ll of the suspected=20

woman, and all his gallantry rose in her defense. Professing to regard the =
attitude of the protesters=20

as nothing less than an affront to his Administration, he called upon the m=
en of the Cabinet, and=20

upon the Vice President, to remonstrate with their wives in Mrs. Eaton's be=
half. But sparkling,=20

strong, fine, fresh, soft to the tongue, and sweet and pleasant to swallow.=

with much eating of fat goose, fritters, onions, cheese, almonds, pears, an=

_
Brown, Andrew Jackson, p. 127.  Throughout the winter of 1829-30 the Calhou=
n and Van Buren=20

factions kept up a contest which daily became more acrimonious and open. Al=
ready the clique=20

around the President had secretly decided that in 1832 he must run again, w=
ith Van Buren as a=20

mate, and that the New Yorker should be the presidential candidate in 1836.=
 Though irritated by=20

the Vice President's conduct in the Eaton affair and in other matters, Jack=
son threw over the=20

understanding of 1828 with reluctance. Even when, on the last day of 1829, =
his friends, alarmed=20

by the state of his health, persuaded him to write a letter to a Tennessee =
judge warmly=20

commending Van Buren and expressing grave doubts about the South Carolinian=
--a statement=20

which, in the event of worst fears being realized, would be of the utmost v=
alue to the Van Buren=20

men--he was unwilling to go the full length of an open break.  But Lewis an=
d his coworkers were=20

craftily laying the train of powder that would lead to an explosion, and in=
 the spring of 1830 they=20

who has never put away wine will pay the score.) And then, the meal over, t=
hey come "out of the=20

tavern into the street," not a little exhilarated, one may fancy, by this f=
amous wine, and away they=20

go singing to the fair.  Not all the pictures of women are as innocently am=
using or mirthful as this=20

one; on the contrary, the general attitude of the authors of the _Fabliaux_=
 is distinctly unflattering,=20

not to say hostile. Sometimes it is merely one of the infinite variations o=
n the idea of the scarcity of=20

virtuous wives; it is Chicheface, the cow who feeds on virtuous wives, and =
who is all but starved to=20

death, while Bigorne, with less rigorous ideas as to the morals of her food=
, is choked, fit to burst.=20

But in general the notion prevails, as one writer himself puts it, that "wo=
man is of too feeble=20

intellect; she laughs at nothing, she cries at nothing; she will turn from =
love to hate in a moment.=20

The strong hand alone can control her; and yet, beating is useless, for her=
 faults are inherent;=20

nature made her captious,=20
