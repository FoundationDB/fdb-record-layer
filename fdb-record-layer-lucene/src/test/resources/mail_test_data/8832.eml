poets=E2=80=94speak of it constantly, and in the same way. In unsophisticat=

this kind of scandal furnishes material to Homer and to the old prophets in=
 the Bible, to Dante and=20

to Shakespeare, for sex is one of the permanent sides of our moral world. I=
f this treatment of it is=20

essential to a complete picture of life, the thinness of American literatur=
