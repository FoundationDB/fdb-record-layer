I am right it is a thing to be laid before Parliament, as a great argument =
in favour of something or=20

against something else. Every fact surely leads up to an inference. Every t=
ruth has a moral. This=20

fact I commend to all whom it doth concern, and I declare it. It is this: t=
he representation of N---- is=20

usually determined by the brothel-keepers of the town. All the men who ever=
 sat for that borough=20

since the Reform Bill passed have been returned by these despicable human c=
reatures, who=20

derive means of sustaining their own existence out of the most loathsome, a=
lthough we are told=20

incurable, evil. How do I prove my fact and moral? the reader asks. Thus: w=
hen all the really=20

honest electors have been polled, the operators or agents exhaust the compa=
ratively decent=20

section of the bribable part of the town, and the result of the whole gives=
 to the Conservative, it=20

may be, a majority of four, or it may be a majority to the Liberal of four,=
 or it may be five, six,=20

seven, eight, nine, ten, or eleven,--according to circumstances. We may sup=
pose this to be late in=20

the day. But there are still from twenty-three to twenty-five of the morall=
y unclean ten-pound=20

therefore, duly-qualified voters. Neither Liberal nor Conservative will los=
e an election if he can help=20

it. In the emergency of the time I speak of, the Liberal, finding himself i=
n a minority of four, goes=20

into Stew Street and buys up the twenty-three, four, or five occupiers of t=
hese leprosy-distilling=20

houses, and pays any price the occupiers think fit to demand. They are take=
n up to poll like free,=20

independent, honest, and moral electors. They turn the scale. They return t=
he member. All the rest=20

has been a farce. Printing the addresses of rival candidates, engaging comm=
ittee-rooms, every=20

thing in the way of machinery or principle, up to the visit of the operator=
 or agent in Stew Street,=20

has been useless. I hate shams. I detest mockeries. Why not leave Stew Stre=
et to return the=20

gentleman or blackguard who is to be called M.P. for N----?  Apropos to thi=
s, or by way of=20

postscript to my moralising, let me inform the reader that a cabinet minist=
er has been returned for=20

N----, and that, beyond all earthly doubt, Stew Street alone, or its voters=
, and the cabinet minister's=20

money, returned him to Parliament in the way I have pointed out.  Well, as =
I have told the reader=20

already, I saw the opportunity for getting an engagement, so I went to some=
body, who put himself=20

into communication with somebody else--this gentleman, who for the present =
may be called Mr.=20

Somebodyelse, having made a fortune in trade, and having a wife who had per=
suaded him that he=20

was a remarkably clever fellow, and that he ought to go into Parliament.  M=
r. Somebodyelse had=20

no political principles. He had himself always voted, as an elector, just i=
n the way that his largest=20

customer had recommended; which largest customer, as if events happened by =
chance, had=20

always been a Liberal. Somehow or other, Mrs. Somebodyelse got into her fem=
inine head that her=20

spouse had herein gone on the wrong tack; that it was "not respectable" to =
be a Liberal; that the=20

"highly genteel thing" was to stand by the Tories; and she therefore determ=
ined that, whenever her=20

spouse went into Parliament, he should be a stanch Conservative: to which h=
e, like a fond=20

husband, said, "I will." This did not much matter to me. Mr. Somebodyelse w=
ould do for N---- and=20

 candidate, whose=20

his gentleman as=20

Mr. Jollefat, a retired tallow-melter or chandler, then residing at Melpome=

supposed to be a sleeping partner of "the old house" in which he had skimme=

candidate. We started a personal canvass. We did all that was usual except =
bribe--and the time=20

had hardly come for that--but all that we did only served to discourage eve=
