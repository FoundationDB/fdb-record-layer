as big as Emporia and nearly half as big as Wichita, which is 70,000. But the thing that made the 

place seem like a village to us was the town crier. As we sat in the car he came down the street 

beating a snare drum and crying the official news of the sugar ration; he was telling the people 

where they could get sugar, how much they should pay for it and how much they should use for 

each member of a family a month.  "Why," asked Henry of an English speaking bystander, "don't 

you put that in your daily newspaper; why keep up the old custom?"  "We have no daily 

newspaper," answered the inhabitant.  "All right, then, is there any reason why the news won't wait 

for the weekly?" asked Henry.  "And we have no weekly and no monthly and no annual. We have 

no newspaper in this town."  That stumped us both. In America every town of five thousand has its 

daily newspaper, and frequently two dailies, and in the West every town of five hundred people 

has its weekly newspaper. With us the newspaper crystallizes public sentiment, promotes local 

pride, and tries to be the social and intellectual centre of the community. A community of twenty-

five thousand without a newspaper--and we found that this community never had supported a 

newspaper--was unthinkable to us in terms of any civilization that we knew. How do they know 

about the births, deaths, and marriages, we asked; and they told us that the churches recorded 

those things. How do they know about the scandal? And we remembered that scandal was older 

than the press; it was the father of the press, as the devil is the father of lies. How do they know 

how to vote? And they told us that newspapers hindered rather than helped that function. How did 

they record local history? And in our hearts, we knew who had recorded so much local history, that 

most of it man who went from the Rio Negro, consequently from the basin of the Amazon, without 

passing his boats over any portage, to the basin of the Lower Orinoco.  The tidings of this 

extraordinary passage spread with such rapidity that La Condamine was able to announce it* at a 

public sitting of the Academy, seven months after the return of Father Roman to Pararuma. (* The 

intelligence was communicated to him by Father John Ferreyro, rector of the college of Jesuits at 

Para. Voyage a l'Amazone page 120. Mem. de l'Acad. 1745 page 450. Caulin page 79. See also, 

in the work of Gili, the fifth chapter of the first book, published in 1780, with the title: Della scoperta 

delle communicazione dell' Orinoco col Maragnone.) "The communication between the Orinoco 

and the Amazon," said he, "recently averred, may pass so much the more for a discovery in 

geography, as, although the junction of these two rivers is marked on the old maps (according to 

the information given by Acunha), it had been suppressed by all the modern geographers in their 

new maps, as if in concert. This is not the first time that what is positive fact has been thought 

fabulous, that the spirit of criticism has been pushed too far, and that this communication has been 

treated as chimerical by those who ought to have been better informed." Since the voyage of 

Father Roman in 1774, no person in Spanish Guiana, or on the coasts of Cumana and Caracas, 

has admitted a doubt of the existence of the Cassiquiare and the bifurcation of the Orinoco. Father 

Gumilla himself; whom Bouguer met at Carthagena, confessed that he had been deceived; and he 

read to Father Gili, a short time before his death, a supplement to his history of the Orinoco, 

intended for a new edition, in which he recounts pleasantly the manner in which he had been 

undeceived. The 


_
that tradition takes care of what is left. But how did they manage to create a town spirit, to vote the 

bonds for the city waterworks, to establish the public library, to enforce the laws, to organize the 

Chamber of Commerce, to get up subscriptions for this, that or the other public benevolence? And 

men shook their heads and said: Water has run down hill many years; perhaps it will keep on 

running, even without a newspaper.  [Illustration: As we sat in the car he came down the street 

beating a snare drum and crying official news of the sugar ration]  It was a sad blow to Henry and 

me, who thought our calling was a torch-bearer of civilization. Indeed, one may digress and say 

that we found the whole estate of the press in France rather disenchanting. For advertising is not 

regarded as entirely "ethical" in France. The big stores sometimes do not advertise at all; because 

people look with the same suspicion on advertising drygoods and clothing merchants as we in 

America look upon advertising lawyers and doctors. So newspapers too often have to sell their 

editorial opinions, and the press has small influence in France, compared with the influence of the 

press in what we call the Anglo-Saxon countries.  But in that French village of twenty-five 

thousand people without a newspaper we found a civilization that compared favourably with the 

civilization in any American town. While the tire was going on it developed that a cog had slipped 

in the transgression of the car--or something of the sort, so we were laid up for an hour, and we 

piled out of our seats and took in the town. We found four good bookstores there--rather larger 

than our bookstores at home. We found two or three big co-operative stores largely patronized by 

industrial workers and farmers, and they were better stores by half than any cooperative stores we 

had seen in America. For with us the co-operative store is generally a sad failure. Our Solano, 

completed in detail the knowledge of the geography of the Upper Orinoco, and the intertwinings of 

this river with the Rio Negro. Solano established himself in 1756 at the confluence of the Atabapo; 

and from that time the Spanish and Portuguese commissioners often passed in their canoes, by 

the Cassiquiare, from the Lower Orinoco to the Rio Negro, to visit each other at their head-

quarters of Cabruta* and Mariva. (* General Iturriaga, confined by illness, first at Muitaco, or Real 

Corona, and afterward at Cabruta, received a visit in 1760 from the Portuguese colonel Don 

Gabriel de Souza y Figueira, who came from Grand Para, having made a voyage of nearly nine 

hundred leagues in his boat. The Swedish botanist, Loefling, who was chosen to accompany the 

expedition of the boundaries at the expense of the Spanish government, so greatly multiplied in 

his ardent imagination the branchings of the great rivers of South America, that he appeared well 

persuaded of being able to navigate, by the Rio Negro and the Amazon, to the Rio de la Plata. 

(Iter page 131.)) Since the year 1767, two or three canoes come annually from the fort of San 

Carlos, by the bifurcation of the Orinoco to Angostura, to fetch salt and the pay of the troops. 

These passages, from one basin of a river to another, by the natural canal of the Cassiquiare, 

excite no more attention in the colonists at present than the arrival of boats that descend the Loire 

by the canal of Orleans, awakens on the banks of the Seine.  Although, since the journey of Father 

Roman, in 1744, precise notions have been acquired in the Spanish possessions in America, both 

of the direction of the Upper Orinoco from east to west, and of the manner of its communication 

with the Rio Negro, this knowledge did not reach Europe till a much later period. In 1750, La 

Condamine and D'Anville* were still of opinion that the Orinoco was a branch of the Caqueta 

coming from the

talk big about cooperation, but they sneak around and patronize the stores that offer the best 

bargains, and our industrial workers haven't begun to realize how co-operative buying will help 

them. We found no big stores, in the American sense, but we found many bright, well-kept shops. 

In electrical supplies we found the show windows up to the American average, which is high 

indeed; but in plumbing there was a sag. We discovered that the town had from it. (* See the 

classical memoir of this great geographer in the Journal des Savans, March 1750 page 184. "One 

fact," says D'Anville, "which cannot be considered as equivocal, after the proofs with which we 

have been recently furnished, is the communication of the Rio Negro with the Orinoco; but we 

must not hesitate to admit, that we are not yet sufficiently informed of the manner in which this 

communication takes place." I was surprised to 


_
sewers. The big, white-tiled bathroom with its carload of modern fixtures which adorns the show 

window of at least one plumber's shop in every American town--we missed. The bathtub is not a 

household need in France. Yet some way we surmised that if our towns could have better 

bookstores and fewer bathtubs we might have felt easier in our minds for the palladiums of our 

liberties. And it can't be laid to the picture shows--this slump in the at Rome (Provincia Quitensis 

Soc. Jesu in America, auctore Carolo Brentano et Nicolao de la Torre; Romae 1745) that seven 

years after the discovery of Father Roman, the Jesuits of Quito were ignorant of the existence of 

the Cassiquiare. The Rio Negro is figured in this map as a branch of the Orinoco.) It was only in 

the second edition of his South America, that D'Anville (without renouncing that 

intercommunication of the Caqueta, by means of
