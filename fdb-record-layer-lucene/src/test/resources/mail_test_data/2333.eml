Dread tales of one that moved, an unseen shape,     'Mong chilling mists an=

That dwelt in lands beyond day's purple rift.     Phantom of presage ill to=

fast-sealed eyes ope not to earthly morn.     "We heard," they cried, "the =
Elf-babes shrilly scream,=20

And loud the Siren's song, when lightnings gleam."     Then they that by lo=

wake,     Prayed for the day, and feared to see it break.      When o'er th=

God's earliest sky,     Heard clear-voiced spheres chant Earth's first lull=
