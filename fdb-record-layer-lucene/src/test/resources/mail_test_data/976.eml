All rights reserved     INTRODUCTION   I  An examination of _A Lear of the =
Steppes_ is of=20

especial interest to authors, as the story is so exquisite in its structure=
, so overwhelming in its=20

effects, that it exposes the artificiality of the great majority of the cle=
ver works of art in fiction. _A=20

Lear of the Steppes_ is great in art because it is a living organic whole, =
springing from the deep=20

roots of life itself; and the innumerable works of art that are fabricated =
and pasted together from an=20

ingenious plan--works that do not grow from the inevitability of things--ap=
pear at once insignificant=20

or false in comparison.  In examining the art, the artist will note that Tu=
rgenev=E2=80=99s method of=20

introducing his story is a lesson in sincerity. Harlov, the Lear of the sto=
ry, is brought forward with=20

such force on the threshold that all eyes resting on his figure cannot but =
follow his after=20

movements. And absolute conviction gained, all the artist=E2=80=99s artful =
after-devices and subtle=20

presentations and side-lights on the story are not apparent under the outsi=
de, became deeply=20

interested in the progress of this most exciting game.  The ball was passed=
 and repassed skilfully=20

between the goals, as, seizing their opportunity, a number of squaws, with =
muskets and=20

tomahawks hidden under their blankets, stole unseen through the gates.  Soo=
n the ball bounced=20

against the pallisade, and instantly a swarm of players dashed after it.  I=
n the twinkling of an eye=20

they had darted through the open gates and snatched their weapons from the =
waiting squaws.=20

Before the garrison could realise what had happened, fifteen of them lay we=
ltering in their blood,=20

and the rest were {236} taken prisoners.  Thus in only six weeks from the d=
ay of the first attack of=20

Pontiac on Detroit, all the forts in the western country, except three, wer=
e seized and destroyed=20

and the garrisons massacred or made prisoners.  To Pontiac and his men Fort=
 Pitt bade defiance.=20

After some weeks' delay Colonel Bouquet was sent out to reinforce it.  Bouq=
uet met and defeated=20

the Delaware and Shawanoe tribes, and gave them so sound a beating that the=
=20


_
which the narrator describes his boyish memories. Then, Harlov=E2=80=99s ho=
usehold, his two daughters,=20

and a crowd of minor characters, are brought before us as persons in the tr=
agedy, and we see that=20

all these people are living each from the innate laws of his being, _appare=
ntly independently of the=20

author=E2=80=99s scheme_. This conviction, that the author has no pre-arran=
ged plan, convinces us that in=20

the story we are living a piece of life: here we are verily plunging into l=
ife itself.  And the story goes=20

on flowing easily and naturally till the people of the neighbourhood, the p=
easants, the woods and=20

fields around, are known by us as intimately as is any neighbourhood in lif=
e. Suddenly a break--the=20

tragedy is upon us. Suddenly the terrific forces that underlie human life, =
even the meanest of=20

human lives, burst on us astonished and breathless, precisely as a tragedy =
comes up to the=20

surface and bursts on us in real life: everybody runs about dazed, annoyed,=
 futile; we watch the=20

other people sustaining their own individuality inadequately in the face of=
 the misguided chiefs=20

slowly came to see that the power of England was greater than they had supp=
osed, and that of=20

France extinguished for ever.  In the following year several Indian tribes =
were defeated, and=20

Pontiac, now deserted by many of his allies, was obliged to fall back farth=
er into the west.  Two=20

years later the mighty chief's power was broken, and he was forced to submi=
t.  So ended the great=20

conspiracy. The hundreds of prisoners whom Pontiac and his Indians had capt=
ured in their raids=20

were at last restored to families which had, not without reason, supposed t=
hem to be dead.=20

Parties of rescuers found that some of the young English girls had actually=
 fallen in love with their=20

savage captors and had wedded them in Indian fashion.  Children had forgott=
en their parents.=20

One girl only remembered her childhood when the strains of a lullaby fell f=
rom the lips of her=20

rejoicing mother, whose face was strange to her.  Pontiac himself vanished =
with ignominy from=20

history.  Fallen from his high estate, defeated in his ambitious hopes, he =
engaged in a drunken=20


_
which go their fatal way logically, events which leave the people huddled a=
nd useless and=20

gasping. And destruction having burst out of life, life slowly returns to i=
ts old grooves--with a=20

difference to us, the difference in the relation of people one to another t=
hat a death or a tragedy=20

always leaves to the survivors. Marvellous in its truth is Turgenev=E2=80=
=99s analysis of the situation after=20

Harlov=E2=80=99s death, marvellous is the simple description of the neighbo=
urhood=E2=80=99s attitude to the Harlov=20

family, and marvellous is the lifting of the scene on the after-life of Har=
lov=E2=80=99s daughters. In the=20

pages (pages 140, 141, 146, 147) on these women, Turgenev flashes into the =
reader=E2=80=99s mind an=20

extraordinary sense of the inevitability of these women=E2=80=99s natures, =
of their innate growth fashioning=20

their after-lives as logically as a beech puts out beech-leaves and an oak =
oak-leaves. Through=20

Turgenev=E2=80=99s single glimpse at their fortunes one knows the whole int=
ervening fifteen years; he has=20

carried us into a new world: yet it is the old world; one needs to know no =
more. It is life arbitrary=20

but inevitable, life so clarified by art that it is absolutely interpreted;=
 but life with all the sense of=20

mystery that nature breathes around it in its ceaseless growth.   II  This =
sense of inevitability and=20

of the mystery of life which Turgenev gives us in _A Lear of the Steppes_ i=
s the highest demand=20

we can make from art. _Acia_, the last story in the present volume, though =
it gives us a sense of=20

mystery, is not inevitable: the bout with {237} a warrior of the Illinois n=
ation.  From words the pair=20

proceeded to blows, tomahawks flashed in the air, and the once powerful chi=
eftain was laid low.=20

Such was the ending to the career of a savage enemy whose name had caused t=
he people in the=20

English colonies to tremble for so long.  But Pontiac and his conspiracy ha=
d taught the new=20

conquerors a lesson.  Justice and forbearance not only towards the French C=
anadians but=20

towards the red-men was thenceforward the policy of English Canada.  All se=
emed now fair sailing=20

for all the colonies under the rule of King George.  But war-clouds were al=
ready mounting above=20

the horizon which would gather in size and intensity as the years ran on.  =
More blood would be=20

spilt in Canada and on the great continent of which Canada forms so importa=
nt a part.     {238}=20

CHAPTER XVI  THE COMING OF THE LOYALISTS  Fifteen years after Wolfe's victo=
rious battle=20

the restless American colonists were ready to revolt and cut themselves loo=
se from the empire=20

which had been won so painfully, so valiantly, and at such cost.  Glad enou=
gh had they been of=20

the protection of King George and King George's soldiers when the French me=
naced them from=20

the north and the unsubdued tribes of fierce savages were threatening to dr=
ive them into the sea.=20

But now that the power of both French and Indian had been crushed, when the=
 thousands of brave=20

English soldiers had been laid at rest amid the Canadian snows, the colonis=
ts felt a security they=20

had never known before.=20


_
the artist=E2=80=99s purpose, and thus, as in other ways, it is far inferio=
r to _Lear_. _Faust_, the second=20

story, has consummate charm in its strange atmosphere of the supernatural m=
ingling with things=20

earthly, but it is not, as is _Lear_, life seen from the surface to the rev=
ealed depths; it is a=20

revelation of the strange forces in life, presented beautifully; but it is =
rather an idea, a problem to=20

be worked out by certain threshold no foe to fear, and as men dislike all a=
uthority which is not of=20

their own choosing, demagogues and agitators quickly set to work to induce =
the Americans to=20

throw off with violence what was called "the British yoke."  The British yo=
ke consisted chiefly in a=20

demand that the colonies should help to pay something of the cost the recen=
t wars had entailed=20

upon the mother-country.  The mother-country asked to be=20


_
an artist creates in us the sense of inevitability, then his work is at its=
 highest, and is obeying=20

nature=E2=80=99s law of growth, unfolding from out itself as inevitably as =
a tree or a flower or a human being=20

unfolds from out itself. Turgenev at his highest never quits nature, yet he=
 always uses the surface,=20

and what is apparent, to disclose her most secret principles, her deepest p=
otentialities, her inmost=20

laws of being, and whatever bear her burden, and in reply her {239} daughte=
rland--America--flew=20

at her throat.  But this is not the place in which to tell the story of the=
 American Revolution.  It was=20

clear from the very first that Canada would be involved, and so certain wer=
e the American=20

agitators and traitors to the King that Canada would join them, that they s=
et up what was called=20

"The Continental Congress" at Philadelphia.  To their intense astonishment=
=20


_
This combination of powers marks only the few supreme artists. Even great m=
asters often fail in=20

perfect _naturalness_: Tolstoi=E2=80=99s _The Death of Ivan Ilytch_, for ex=
ample, one of the most powerful=20

stories ever written, has too little that is typical of the whole of life, =
too much that is strained=20

towards the general purpose of the story, to be really _natural_. Turgenev=
=E2=80=99s special feat in fiction is=20

that his characters reveal themselves by the most ordinary details of their=
 every-day life; and while=20

these details are always giving us the whole life of the people, and their =
inner life as well, the=20

novel=E2=80=99s significance is being built up simply out of these do with =
their designs.  "The Continental=20

Congress!" cried the loyal Governor, Sir Guy Carleton; "let me tell you tha=
t Canada on this=20

continent will have none of your disloyalty!"  So the Americans made up the=
ir minds to swoop=20

down upon Canada and capture it before further English troops could come to=
 its assistance.=20

Ticonderoga and Crown Point were surprised in rough-and-ready fashion by Et=
han Allen and his=20

"Green Mountain Boys."  Through the old war-path leading into Canada, Gener=
al Richard=20

Montgomery, an Irish officer who had turned against his King, was sent to M=
ontreal with an army=20

of 3000 men.  But as we have seen many times, to capture Montreal=20
