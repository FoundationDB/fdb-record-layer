M. le duc paused in his restless walk.  "You would ..." he stammered, then =
checked himself,=20

turning abruptly away. He had some difficulty in hiding the scorn wherewith=
 he regarded the=20

other's coolness. Bourgeois blood was not to be gainsaid. The tradesman--or=
 banker, whatever he=20

was--who hankered after an alliance with Mademoiselle de Kernogan, and was =
ready to lay down=20

a couple of millions for the privilege--was not to be deterred from his pur=
pose by any=20

considerations of pride or of honour. M. le duc was satisfied and re-assure=
d, but he despised the=20

man for his leniency for all that.  "The marriage is no marriage at all acc=
ording to the laws of=20

France," reiterated Martin-Roget calmly.  "No, it is not," assented the Duk=
e roughly.  For a while=20

there was silence: Martin-Roget seemed immersed in his own thoughts and not=
 to notice the=20

febrile comings and goings of the other man.  "What we have to do, M. le du=
c," he said after a=20

while, "is to induce Mlle. de Kernogan to return here immediately."  "How a=
re you going to=20

accomplish that?" sneered the Duke.  "Oh! I was not suggesting that I shoul=
d appear in the matter=20

at all," rejoined Martin-Roget with a shrug of the shoulders.  "Then how ca=
n I ...?"  "Surely ..."=20

argued the younger man tentatively.  "You mean ...?"  Martin-Roget nodded. =
Despite these=20

ambiguous half-spoken sentences the two men had understood one another.  "W=
e must get her=20

back, of course," assented the Duke, who had suddenly become as calm as the=
 other man.=20

"There is no harm done," reiterated Martin-Roget with slow and earnest emph=
asis.  Whereupon=20

the Duke, completely pacified, drew a chair close to the hearth and sat dow=
n, leaning his elbows=20

on his knees and holding his fine, aristocratic hands to the blaze.  Freder=
ick came in half an hour=20

later to ask if M. le duc would have his luncheon. He found the two gentlem=
en sitting quite close=20

together over the dying embers of a fire that had not been fed for close up=
on an hour: and that=20

prince of valets was glad to note that M. le duc's temper had quite cooled =
down and that he was=20

talking calmly and very affably to M. Martin-Roget.     CHAPTER V  THE NEST=
   I  There are=20

lovely days in England sometimes in November or December, days when the dep=
arting year=20

strives to make us forget that winter is nigh, and autumn smiles, gentle an=
d benignant, caressing=20

with a still tender kiss the last leaves of the scarlet oak which linger on=
 the boughs, and touching=20

up with a vivid was nearly ended, that Dechamp should rise and leave the fi=
re after giving him a=20

look which was a silent but obvious invitation to follow.  Dan obeyed at on=
ce, and his leader,=20

conducting him between the various camp-fires, led him outside the circle o=
f carts.  A clear moon=20

lit up the prairie all round, so that they could see its undulating sweep i=
n every direction.  "Anything=20

wrong, Antoine?" asked Dan in a low voice, when they were out of earshot of=
 the camp.  "Nothing=20

wrong, Dan."  "Surely," continued the other, while Dechamp paused as if in =
perplexity, "surely=20

there can be no chance of Red-skins troubling us on a clear night like this=
.  I can distinguish every=20

bush for miles around."  "There is no fear o' Red-skins.  No, I am not trou=
bled about them.  It is=20

matters concerning yourself that trouble me."  "How's that?  What do you me=
an, Antoine?"  "Is=20

your brother-in-law-to-be, Duncan McKay, coming to join us this spring?" as=
ked Dechamp.  "I=20

believe he is--after he has helped his father a bit longer wi' the farm.  W=
hy do you ask?"  "Well, to=20

say truth, I can't give you a very good reason for my bein' anxious.  Only =
I can't help havin' my=20

ears open, and I've heard some talk among the lads that makes me fear for t=
he young man.  They=20

say, or hint, that he knows more about the murder o' poor Perrin than he ch=
ooses to tell.  I've not=20

been quite able to find out what makes them suspect him, but they do suspec=
t him, an' it would be=20

well to warn him not to come here, for you know there are many opportunitie=
s to commit murder=20



on a buffalo-hunt!"  The incident of the knife, and of Duncan McKay's signi=
ficant glance, at once=20

flashed across Davidson's mind, and he felt a terrible sinking of the heart=
 when the suspicion,=20

once before roused within him, seemed now to be confirmed.  He resolved, ho=
wever, to reveal his=20

thoughts to no one--specially not to Elspie.  "I think it a shame," he said=
, "that men should allow=20

such rumours to circulate, when nothing certain has arisen to rouse suspici=
on.  That affair of the=20

knife was clearly explained when young McKay declared that it was not his, =
though it looked like it.=20

If he knew anything about the murder, would he not have been certain to hav=
e told us long ago?=20

And, surely, you cannot suppose that Duncan killed Perrin with his own hand=
? Speak, Dechamp!=20

Why do you shake your head?"  "I know nothing," returned the leader.  "What=
 right have I to=20

suppose anything?  I only know that men's deeds=20


_
ilex and of yew. The sky is of that pale, translucent blue which dwellers i=
n the South never see,=20

with the soft transparency of an aquamarine as it fades into the misty hori=
zon at midday. And at=20

dusk the thrushes sing: "Kiss me quick! kiss me quick! kiss me quick" in th=
e naked branches of old=20

acacias and chestnuts, and the robins don their crimson waistcoats and dart=
 in and out among the=20

coppice and through the feathery arms of larch and pine. And the sun which =
tips the prickly points=20

of holly leaves with gold, joins in this merry make-believe that winter is =
still a very, very long way=20

off, and that mayhap he has lost his way altogether, and is never coming to=
 this balmy beautiful=20

land again.  Just such a day was the penultimate one of November, 1793, whe=
n Lady Anthony=20

Dewhurst sat at a desk in the wide bay window of the drawing-room in Combwi=
ch Hall, trying to=20

put into a letter to Lady Blakeney all that her heart would have wished to =
express of love and=20

gratitude and happiness.  Three whole days had gone by since that exciting =
night, when before=20

break of day in the dimly-lighted old church, in the presence of two or thr=
ee faithful friends, she=20

had plighted her troth to Lord Anthony: even whilst other kind friends--inc=
luding His Royal=20

Highness--formed part of the little conspiracy which unaccountable, and tha=
t our men have strong=20

suspicion.  For myself, I have no opinion.  Duncan McKay is probably innoce=
nt, for he and Perrin=20

were not enemies.  I hope he is so, but I advise you to stop his coming to =
the camp just now if you=20

can.  His life may depend on it."  "I cannot stop him," returned Dan, with =
a perplexed look.  "He is=20

headstrong, as you know, and if he has made up his mind to come, nothing wi=
ll stop him."=20

"Perhaps if he knew his life would be in danger--that might stop him."  "I =
doubt it; but I will give him=20

the chance.  I will ride back to Red River without delay, and warn him."  "=
Good.  When will you=20

start?"  "To-night.  The moon is clear and will not set till morning.  I sh=
all be well on my way by that=20

time."  "Will you ride alone?"  "No, there may be bad Indians about.  I wil=
l ask Okematan or Fergus=20

McKay to ride with me.  Why did you not speak to Fergus instead of to me?" =
 "Because he has not=20

been spoken to by any one," answered Dechamp; "and I would not be the first=
 to put suspicion into=20

his head about his own brother.  Besides, your head is clearer; and your in=
terest in Duncan, for=20

Elspie's sake, is greater than his, no doubt."  "Well, you may be right, An=
toine.  At all events if I=20

take Fergus with me I shall send him back before reaching the Settlement, a=
nd=20


_
would have kept M. Martin-Roget out of the way. Since then her life had bee=
n one continuous=20

dream of perfect bliss. From the moment when after the second religious cer=
emony in the Roman=20

Catholic church she found herself alone in the carriage with milor, and fel=
t his arms--so strong and=20

yet so tender--closing round her and his lips pressed to hers in the first =
masterful kiss of complete=20

possession, until this hour whatever about my reason for going there.  `Pre=
ssing business,' you=20

know, will be sufficient."  "I'm not so sure of that," returned Dechamp wit=
h a laugh.  "Men are apt to=20

want to know the nature of `pressing business.'  However, it may be as well=
 to take Fergus.  At=20

any rate you cannot have Okematan, for he is not in camp, he left soon afte=
r we pitched, and I=20

know has not yet returned."  "It matters not.  Fergus=20


_
saw his tall, elegant figure hurrying across the garden toward the gate and=
 suddenly turning=20

toward the window whence he knew that she was watching him, every hour and =
every minute had=20

been nothing but unalloyed happiness.  Even there where she had looked for =
sorrow and difficulty=20

her path had been made smooth for her. Her father, who she had feared would=
 prove hard and=20

irreconcilable, had been tender and forgiving to such an extent that tears =
almost of shame would=20

gather in her eyes whenever she thought of him.  As soon as  Returning to c=
amp, Dan Davidson=20

made the proposal to Fergus McKay.  That worthy was, as he said, ready for =
anything, and the=20

two were soon mounted.  They were also well armed, for the risk of meeting =
a party of hostile=20

Indians was not altogether out of the question, though improbable.  Each ho=
rseman carried his=20

blanket and provision wallet, his gun, a long knife almost equal to an anci=
ent Roman sword, and a=20

cavalry pistol--revolvers not having been invented at that time: at least t=
hey had not come into=20

general use.  Thus=20
