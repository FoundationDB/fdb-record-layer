jurisdiction of States recognizing ample authority over them, a competent d=
iscipline cannot be=20

impracticable. The degree in which this discipline will enforce the needed =
labour, and in which a=20

voluntary industry will supply the defect of compulsory labour, are vital p=
oints, on which it may not=20

be safe to be very positive without some light from actual experiment.  "Co=
nsidering the probable=20

composition of the labourers, and the known fact that, where the labour is =
compulsory, the greater=20

the number of labourers brought together (unless, indeed, where co-operatio=
n of many hands is=20

rendered essential by a particular kind of work or of machinery) the less a=
re the proportional=20

profits, it may be doubted whether the surplus from that source merely, bey=
ond the support of the=20

establishment, would sufficiently accumulate in five, or even more years, f=
or the objects in view.=20

And candor obliges me to say that I am not satisfied either that the prospe=
ct of emancipation at a=20

future day will sufficiently overcome the natural and habitual repugnance t=
o labour, or that there is=20

such an advantage of united over individual labour as is taken for granted.=
  "In cases where=20

portions of time have been allotted to slaves, as among the Spaniards, with=
 a view to their working=20

out their freedom, it is believed that but few have availed themselves of t=
he opportunity by a=20

voluntary industry; and such a result could be less relied on in a case whe=
re each individual would=20

feel that the fruits of his exertions would be shared by others, whether eq=
ually or unequally making=20

them, and that the exertions of others would equally avail him, notwithstan=
ding a deficiency in his=20

own. Skilful arrangements might palliate this tendency, but it would be dif=
ficult to counteract it=20

effectually.  "The examples of the Moravians, the Harmonites, and the Shake=
rs, in which the=20

united labours of many for a common object have been successful, have, no d=
oubt, an imposing=20

character. But it must be recollected that he persevered in his study, and =
the shadows that=20

obscured his soul gradually and slowly passed away.  Notwithstanding the ge=
neral unbelief and=20

indifference of the higher classes, there were at that time in the Russian =
court a few =E2=80=9Cdevout and=20

honourable women,=E2=80=9D who were earnestly seeking light from above. To =
these the Czar was an=20

object of interest, as =E2=80=9Cnot far from the kingdom of heaven.=E2=80=
=9D When the French war was impending,=20

and the burden of anxiety from which few hearts were free was known to weig=
h most heavily upon=20

his, a message, which proved to be indeed from God, came to him through one=
 of them. It was the=20

night before he started for Vilna, and, according to his usual custom, he w=
as spending it in=20

transacting business, content to find what sleep he could in his open carri=
age while dashing at=20

headlong speed through the country. As he was diligently arranging his pape=
rs, a lady entered his=20

cabinet unannounced, and looking up in great surprise he recognized the wif=
e of his Grand=20

Marshal, the Countess Tolstoi. She apologized for her unseasonable visit, a=
nd put a paper into his=20

hand, which she entreated him to read, saying he would find true comfort th=
ere. His unfailing=20

courtesy led him to accept it and thank her; and she withdrew. He put the p=
aper in his pocket,=20

resumed his occupation, and thought no more of it until, after two days and=
 nights of rapid travel,=20

he changed his clothes for the first time. Upon removing his coat he found =
it, and saw that it was a=20

copy of the ninety-first psalm. He lay down; but, worn out with fatigue, wa=
s unable to sleep, so he=20

called his chaplain and requested him to read to him. Strangely enough, the=
 portion which the=20

priest selected was that very psalm, and the Czar was greatly impressed by =
the coincidence.[32]=20

The glorious words of promise, so exactly suited to his need, were received=
 with simple faith. From=20

that day forward he said of the Lord, =E2=80=9CHe is my refuge and my fortr=
ess: my God; in him will I trust.=E2=80=9D=20

His study of the=20


_
impulse in the members, and a religious authority in the head, for which th=
ere will be no=20

substitutes of equivalent efficacy in the emancipating establishment. The c=
ode of rules by which=20

Mr. Rapp manages his conscientious and devoted flock, and enriches a common=
 treasury, must=20

be little applicable to the dissimilar assemblage in question. His experien=
ce may afford valuable=20

aid in its general organization, and in the distribution of details of the =
work to be performed. But an=20

efficient administration must, as is judiciously proposed, be in hands prac=
tically acquainted with=20

the propensities and habits of the members of this period until the end of =
his life he read three=20

chapters daily, even under the most difficult circumstances, =E2=80=9Cwhen =
the cannon were thundering=20

about his tent.=E2=80=9D He prayed constantly, =E2=80=9Cusing no form,=E2=
=80=9D as he said himself, =E2=80=9Cbut the words which=20

God=E2=80=99s Spirit taught him, according to his needs.=E2=80=9D And he so=
ught to conform his conduct to the will=20

of God, so far as he understood it.  This was not done without a struggle. =
His life had not been=20

blameless, and much once dear had to be surrendered. But henceforward his c=
ourt became a=20

model of purity; and moreover his fear of God showed itself in an increase =

FROM FREDERICK DOUGLASS'S PAPER, 1853: "LEARN TRADES OR STARVE"  These are=
=20

the obvious alternatives sternly presented to the free colored people of th=
e United States. It is idle,=20

yea even ruinous, to disguise the matter for a single hour longer; every da=
y begins and ends with=20

the impressive lesson that free negroes must learn trades, or die.  The old=
 avocations, by which=20

colored men obtained a livelihood, are rapidly, unceasingly and inevitably =
passing into other=20

hands; every hour sees the black man elbowed out of employment by some newl=
y arrived=20

emigrant, whose hunger and whose color are thought to give him a better tit=
le to the place; and so=20

we believe it will continue to his naturally passionate temper; and if, aft=
er this period, he was=20

betrayed into a hasty expression, he would frankly apologize, not only to a=
 member of his suite,=20

but even to the humblest of his attendants.  He had always known that his e=
normous power was=20

intrusted to him for the good of others, not for his own happiness or glory=
. =E2=80=9CFifty millions of men are=20

worth more than one man,=E2=80=9D had been an axiom with him from the begin=
ning of his reign. But now=20

he knew himself the steward of God, responsible to _him_ for its exercise. =
=E2=80=9CYou should be in my=20

place,=E2=80=9D he said to a friend, =E2=80=9Cto understand what is the res=
ponsibility of a sovereign, and what I feel=20

when I reflect that one day I=20


_
until the last prop is levelled beneath us.  As a black man, we say if we c=
annot stand up, let us fall=20

down. We desire to be a man among men while we do live; and when we cannot,=
 we wish to die. It=20

is evident, painfully evident to every reflecting mind, that the means of a=
ccount of the life of every=20

one of my soldiers.=E2=80=9D  Amongst the commands of Christ which impresse=
d him most deeply were=20

these: =E2=80=9CLove your enemies: do good to them that hate you.=E2=80=9D =
He learned to forgive personal=20

injuries, =E2=80=9Cwhich in other reigns would have drawn down thunder.=E2=
