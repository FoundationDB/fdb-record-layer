head and horns back to camp, leaving the carcass to be brought in the next =
morning, having first=20

taken the precaution, however, of tying the choicest portions high in a tre=
e, out of the reach of=20

marauding animals.  As they were all gathered about the camp fire that nigh=
t, discussing the=20

events of the day, Jack suddenly held up his hand to insure silence.  "Hark=
!" he exclaimed.=20

"There's that queer sound again."  In the air over their heads was the rush=
ing of great wings, while=20

there was a throbbing as if some mighty beast was passing over the camp.  "=
Wow!" cried Long=20

Gun, and he made a dive for the tent.  "That's it!" said Nat softly. "I won=
der if we shall ever solve=20

the mystery?"  The boys looked at each other in alarm. Will sprang to his f=
eet.  "That sound!" he=20

cried. "I heard it one night when I was camping in the woods."  "Where?" as=
ked Jack.  "About ten=20

miles from here. It's the same noise."  "We must solve this mystery!" excla=
imed Jack. "I believe it=20

must be----"  But he did not finish the sentence, for from the air above th=
em says that with the=20

heart man believeth unto righteousness, but "whoredom and wine and new wine=
 take away the=20

heart." Lust will drive all natural affection out of a man's heart. For the=
 sake of some vile harlot he=20

will trample on the feelings and entreaties of a sainted mother and beautif=
ul wife and godly sister.=20

Young man, are you leading an impure life? Suppose God's scales should drop=
 down before you,=20

what would you do? Are you fit for the kingdom of heaven? You know very wel=
l that you are not.=20

You loathe yourself. When you look upon that pure wife or mother, you say, =
 "What a vile wretch I=20

am! The harlot is bringing me down to an untimely and dishonored grave."  M=
ay God show us=20

what a fearful sin it is! The idea of making light of it! I do not know of =
any sin that will make a man=20

run down to ruin more quickly. I am appalled when I think of what is going =
on in the world; of so=20

many young men living impure lives, and talking about the virtue of women a=
s if it didn't amount to=20

anything. This sin is coming in upon us like a flood=20


_
the call of a voice:  "To the left! To the left!" was the cry. "There's the=
 camp fire we saw before."=20

They all sprang to their feet and looked up into the dark sky. Surely that =
was some vast shape=20

hovering over them! And then the throbbing and the rush of wings died away.=

JACK GETS A BEAR   "Fellows," spoke Jack, and his voice trembled in spite o=
f his efforts to=20

render it steady, "we've got to get at the bottom of this."  "That's right,=
" agreed Bony.  "Maybe Bill=20

can tell us something," suggested Sam.  "Long Gun ought to know army of pro=
stitutes. Young men=20

by hundreds are being utterly ruined by this accursed sin.  THE PRODIGAL DA=
UGHTER.  I think=20

that the most infernal thing the sun shines on in America is the way woman =
is treated after she has=20

been ruined by a man, often under fair promises of marriage. Some one said =
that when the=20

prodigal son came home he had the best robe and the fatted calf, but what d=
oes the prodigal=20

daughter get? Although she may have been more sinned against than sinning, =
she is cast out and=20

ostracized by society. She is condemned to an almost=20

his life," said Budge, speaking plainly this time.  "Long Gun thinks it's s=
pirits or something like=20

that," remarked Jack. "He's so scared he can't speak. But what about you, B=
ill? Are you sure you=20

heard it before?"  "Yes," replied the newcomer. "I heard sinking step by st=
ep into a loathsome=20

grave, unless she hurries her doom by suicide. But the wretch who has ruine=
d her in body and=20

soul, holds his head as high as ever, and society attaches no stain to him.=

I was in a lumber camp, to which I had worked my way, and one night, just a=
bout this time, we all=20

heard that rushing sound in the air. Some of the men were frightened, but o=
thers said it was a=20

flight of eagles or other big birds."  "That's what we thought it was, firs=
t," came from Nat. "But I=20

don't believe it now."  "Why not?" asked Bony. "It's the same sound."  "But=
 did you hear some men=20

speaking?" demanded Nat. "We cards, he would promptly be dropped by society=
; but he may=20

boast of his impure life, and his companions will think nothing of it. Pare=

their daughters to become acquainted with a man who is rude in manners, som=
