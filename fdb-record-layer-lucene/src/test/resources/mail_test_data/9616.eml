threw a glance over his shoulder, saw her, and then began to run. It was a =
feeble attempt to=20

escape, for unless some accident happened to Ruth, she could easily overtak=
e him.  And she did=20

so, although he ran straight ahead, and ran so hard that finally he slipped=
 and fell, panting, to his=20

knees. Ruth was beside him before he could it. It is just a mistake that wi=

and see you, man, every day, and Lady Montgomery will send you books. I hop=
e they will not be=20

too good books, John. That's her foible, honest woman. You seem to be victu=
alled for a siege," Sir=20

James added, looking round the room. "That is Miss Barbara Erskine, I will =
be=20


_
"Don't you be such a ridiculous boy!" she commanded, seizing the lad by the=
 shoulder, as he=20

attempted to rise. "You mustn't run away. Mr. Cameron expects to find you a=
t the mill, and you=20

must stay. And they'll be here, ready to take the train from Cheslow, short=
ly."  "I--I don't want to=20

stay here," stammered the boy. "I--I don't want to see that man  "I felt di=
sposed to pitch them all=20

out of the window," said John.  "Nothing of the sort; though they're too go=

of the turnkeys. Keep up your heart, my fine lad. I'll see Monypenny to-nig=
ht before I dine, and if=20

we cannot bring you out with flying colours, between us, it will be a stran=
ge thing to me. Just you=20

keep up your heart,"=20


_
"But he expects to see you, and I could not let you go before he comes."  "=
You're just the meanest=20

girl I ever saw!" cried Hatfield, almost in tears. "I'd got away in the nig=
ht if it hadn't been for you."=20

Ruth fairly giggled at that--she couldn't help it.  "Well, don't you be nas=
ty about it," she said. "You=20

are a dreadfully foolish boy--"  "What do you know about me?" he gasped, tu=
rning to look at her=20

finally with frightened eyes.  "I know that running away isn't going to hel=
p you," Ruth Fielding said,=20

with returning gravity.  "You think that man--that Cameron man--will take m=
e back?"  "Back=20

where?"  "To--to Scarboro?"  "I don't know."  "I tell you I won't go," the =
boy cried. "I won't go."  "But=20

we're all going up there this very day," said Ruth, slowly. "Mr. Cameron, a=
nd Helen and Tom, and=20

some other girls and boys. I'm going, too--"  "_Going where_?" shrieked Fre=
d Hatfield, actually=20

shaking with terror, and as pale as a ghost.  "We're off for the backwoods-=
-up Scarboro way. Mr.=20

Cameron is going to take us for a fortnight to Snow Camp. And you--"  With =
another wild cry Fred=20

Hatfield crumpled down upon the ice and burst into a tempest of sobbing. He=
 beat his ungloved=20

hands upon the ice, and although Ruth could not help feeling contempt for a=
 boy who would so=20

give way to weakness she could not help but pity him, too.  For Ruth Fieldi=
ng had more than an=20

inkling of the trouble that so weighed Fred Hatfield down, and had made him=
 an outcast from his=20

home and friends.     CHAPTER VI  ON THE TRAIN   When the Cameron automobil=
e arrived at=20

the Red Mill that forenoon Fred Hatfield sat gloomily upon the porch steps.=
 Ruth kept an eye=20

away. "The sheriff will be round here again on the 25th, and we'll be prepa=
red for the examination,=20

and bring you clear off. It's not so very long to wait."  With this John wa=
s forced to be content. The=20

25th was four days off, and to remain in confinement for four days more was=
 an appalling=20

anticipation; but Sir James's visit gave him real cheer. Perhaps Mr Monypen=
ny, too, on thinking it=20

over, might turn to a conviction of his client's truth.  While Sir James ro=
de home, pleased with=20

himself that he had obeyed his own generous impulse, and pleased with John,=
 who had been so=20

unfeignedly consoled by it, Lord Lindores and his son were driving back fro=
m Tinto together in the=20

early twilight. There was not a word exchanged between them as they drove d=
own the long=20

avenue in the shadow of the woods; but as they turned into the lighter road=
, Lord Lindores=20

returned to the subjects which occupied his mind habitually. "That is a bus=
iness well over," he=20

said, with a sigh of satisfaction. "It is always a relief when the last cer=
emonies are accomplished;=20

and though Carry chose to meet me with heroics, it is very satisfactory to =
know that her position is=20

so good. One could never be sure with a man of Torrance's temper. He was as=
 likely as not to=20

have surrounded his widow with annoyances and restraints. He has erred just=
 a little on the other=20

side now, poor fellow! Still he meant it, no doubt, for the best." Lord Lin=
dores spoke to his son with=20

an ease and confidence which he could not feel with the other members of hi=
s family. Rintoul=20

himself, indeed, had been somewhat incomprehensible for a little time past;=
 but indigestion, or any=20

other=20


_
him from the doorway. Mr. Cameron seemed to understand their position when =
he came up the=20

walk, and asked Ruth:  "So, he wants to leave; does he?"  Ruth merely nodde=
d; but Fred Hatfield=20

scowled at the dry-goods merchant and turned away his head.  "Now, young ma=
n," said Mr.=20

Cameron, standing in front of the sullen boy, with must think of other matt=
ers," he continued. "This=20

business about Edith must be settled. Millefleurs must have his answer. He =
has been very patient;=20

but a young fellow like that knows his own importance, and Edith must hear =
reason. She will never=20

have another such chance."  Rintoul made a little movement in his corner, w=
hich=20


_
young man, let's get to the bottom of this. You confide in me, and I will n=
ot betray your confidence.=20

Why don't you want to live at home?"  "I don't want to--that's all," mutter=
ed Fred Hatfield, shortly.=20

"And I _won't_."  Mr. Cameron shook his head. "I hate to see one so young s=
o obstinate," he said.=20

"It may be that your mother and brothers and sisters find you a sore trial;=
 perhaps they are glad=20

you are not at home. But until I am sure of that I consider it my duty to k=
eep an eye on you. I want=20

you to come along with us to-day."  "I know where you are going. This girl =
has told me," said the=20

light-haired youth, nodding at Ruth. "You're going up to Scarboro."  "Yes. =
And I propose to take=20

you with us. We'll see whether your mother wants you or not."  "You don't k=
now what you're doing,=20

sir!" gasped Fred Hatfield, crouching down upon the step.  "I certainly do =
not know what I am=20

doing," for a reply on his part; and his father could not even see the expr=
ession of his face.  "I can=20

only hope that she will be more amenable to his influence than to mine," sa=
id Lord Lindores, with a=20

sigh. "It is strange that she, the youngest of my children, should be the o=
ne to give me the most=20

trouble. Rintoul, it is also time that I should speak to you about yourself=
. It would give your mother=20

and me great satisfaction to see you settled. I married early myself, and I=
 have never had any=20

reason to repent it. Provided that you make a wise choice. The two families=
 will no doubt see a=20

great deal of each other when things are settled between Edith and Millefle=
urs; and I hear on all=20

hands that his sister, Lady Reseda--you met her several times in town----" =
 "Yes,--I met her," said=20

Rintoul, reluctantly. He turned once more in his corner, as if he would fai=
n have worked his way=20

through and=20
