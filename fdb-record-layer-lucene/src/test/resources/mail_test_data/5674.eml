"I'm superstitious," affirmed the latter aloud. "One's for sorrow, two's for joy, and three's for luck! 

She's the third to-day and she may be a mascot."  "I'd rather have chocolates than mascots," said 

an injured voice from behind a coffee-cup.  The chance remark gave Irene the very opportunity 

she needed. She suddenly remembered the chocolates her father had handed her before she left 

the hotel, and, producing the package, she offered its contents. After a visible moment of 

hesitation the girl with the long pigtail accepted her hospitality, and passed the delicacies round. 

Instantly all were chumping almonds, and the icy atmosphere thawed into summer. Everybody 

began to talk at once.  "There's a spare cup here if you'd like some coffee. Yes, Rachel, I _shall_ 

offer it!"  "I suppose you're over fourteen?"  "We may make coffee after lunch if we're seniors, but 

the kids aren't allowed any."  "You've just one minute to drink it in before the bell rings."  "Hustle 

up if you want to finish it."  "I'll bet a cookie you're a real sport."  "There's the bell! Don't choke or 

you'll blight your young career."  "We've got to scoot quick!"  "Come along with me and I'll show 

you where."  Irene, taken in tow by a girl with a freckled nose, was hurried along the corridor and 

up the stairs to the classrooms. Although she had scarcely spoken a word she had undoubtedly 

gained a victory, and had established her welcome among at least a section of her schoolfellows. 

She did not yet know their names, but names are a detail compared with personalities, and with 

some members of the coffee-party she felt that she might ultimately become chums.  "Don't I bless 

Dad for those chocs!" she thought as she took her seat at a desk. "They worked the trick. If I'd had 

nothing to offer that crew I might have sat out in the cold forevermore. The dark pigtail is decent 

enough, but if it comes to a matter of chumming give me 'Freckles' for choice."  The Villa Camellia 

was a high-class boarding-school for English-speaking girls whose parents were residents, 

permanently or temporarily, in the neighborhood of Naples. It was generally described as an 

Anglo-American college, for the arrangements were accommodated to suit the customs  "Not very 

easily. It's something like being measured for a gown. I must know what you have to leave and to 

whom you wish to leave it."  "But I don't want anybody to know."  "I'm not anybody."  "I know. I 

don't think, though, that I quite care to tell you."  "Then I'm afraid there'll be some little difficulty 

about executing your wishes in the matter."  "How much do wills cost?" she asked irrelevantly.  "It 

depends on the length."  "How much a yard?"  "We mostly sell them by the folio, not by the yard." 

"How many feet are there in a folio?"  "You'll have to ask a law-stationer that."  "How much would 

a medium-sized will cost? Half-a-crown?"  "More than that," I said.  "Much more?" She turned over 

some coins in her purse.  "A good deal more."  "But I saw some in a chemist's for ninepence. 

Perhaps I'd better buy one of those."  "You might," I said doubtfully.  "You said that as though you 

didn't think that chemists sell very good wills."  "There's nothing really the matter with them. They 

consist of some printed words and spaces--mostly spaces. If you happen to execute them the right 

way the Judge afterwards decides what they mean."  "But how does he know?"  "He doesn't. 

That's what makes it so interesting. After a number of barristers have explained what they might 

mean, the Judge says what they ought to mean, and they mean that."  "So there would have to be 

a law-suit?"  "Almost inevitably."  "And you make good wills?"  "My wills are all of the very best 

quality."  "Then I suppose I must let you make me one. What sort of things do people leave?"  "All 

sorts of things. Anything they've got and quite often things they haven't got."  "Animals? Dogs? 

Can I will away Bobs, for instance?"  "Yes."  "Can I leave anything to anyone I like?"  "Yes, to 

anyone you like or don't like." I was thinking of Bobs. He is not a very amiable dog and no friend of 



mine.  "I think I'll leave Bobs to you." I had felt it coming.  "But I might die before Bobs. Bobs being 

a specific legacy would then lapse and fall into residue," I hurriedly explained.  "That doesn't 

sound nice."  "It isn't nice. Bobs would never be happy there. You had better leave him to some 

one younger."  After we had settled Bobs on a young cousin

teacher had been trained in Boston, and another at Oxford, while the British section of the 

community included girls from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Pupils belonging to other 

European races were not received, the object of the college being to preserve the left her old 

dance programmes and several unimportant things of doubtful ownership to her greatest rival; her
