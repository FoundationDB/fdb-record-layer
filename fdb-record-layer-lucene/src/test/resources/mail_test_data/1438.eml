philodendron monstera killed the Egyptian and their intention to kill him a=

 Louis was too active to be caught as the conspirators had planned. He summ=
oned Philip to appear before the court of peers of the duchy of France, and=
, on his refusal, seized upon the strongholds of his _
soul, _by killing him_; therefore forgive me. So He forgave him: for He is =
the Very Forgiving, the=20

Merciful.--He said, O my Lord, by the favours with which Thou hast favoured=
 me, _defend me_,=20

and I will by no means be an assistant to the sinners _after this_.--And th=
e next morning he was=20

afraid in the city, watching _for what might happen unto him on account of =
the slain man_; and lo,=20

he who had begged his assistance the day before was crying out to him for a=
id _against another=20

Egyptian_. Moses said unto him, Verily thou art a person manifestly in erro=
r, _because of that=20

which thou hast done yesterday and to-day_. But when he was about to lay vi=
olent hands upon=20

him who was an enemy unto them both, (_namely unto Moses and him who begged=
 his aid_,)=20

_the latter_ said, _imagining that he would lay violent hands upon him, bec=
ause of that which he=20

had said unto him_, O Moses, dost thou desire to kill me, as thou killedst =
a soul yesterday? Thou=20

desirest not [aught] but to be an oppressor in the land, and thou desirest =
not to be [one] of the=20

reconcilers.--_And the Egyptian heard that: so he knew that the killer was =
Moses; wherefore he=20

departed unto Pharaoh and acquainted him therewith, and Pharaoh commanded t=
he executioners=20

to slay Moses, and they betook themselves to seek him._ But a man _who was =
a believer of the=20

family of Pharaoh_[260] came from the furthest part of the city, running _b=
y a way that was nearer=20

than the way by which they had come_: he said, O Moses, verily the chiefs _=
of the people of=20

Pharaoh_ are consulting respecting thee, to slay thee; therefore go forth _=
from the city_: verily I=20

am unto thee [one] of the admonishers. So he went forth from it in fear, wa=
tching _in fear of=20

pursuer, or for the aid of God_. He said, O my Lord, deliver me from the un=
just people _of=20

Pharaoh_![261]  And when he was journeying towards Medyen, _which was the c=
ity of Sho'eyb,=20

eight days' journey from Beauclerc, in 1102, and was received with all the =
courtesy and honor due=20

his rank. Bertrade despatched after him letters, sealed with the royal seal=
 of Philip, instructing=20

Henry to seize Louis and confine him in prison for the rest of his days. Bu=
t Henry was either too=20

wise or too humane to perpetrate this outrage, and sent the young prince ba=
ck with every honor.=20

Louis was furious; Philip denied all knowledge of the infamous letters; and=
 Louis, guessing=20

whence they came, planned to kill Bertrade.  She, however, was not easily t=
o be caught, and=20

began devising means to procure the death of Louis. She first had resort to=
 three clerks, who=20

proposed to destroy the prince by means of sorcery, if they could conduct t=
heir incantations=20

unmolested for nine days. But one of them confessed the plot, and the black=
 art was abandoned=20

for some surer method. The queen had Louis poisoned. He languished for seve=
ral days, unable to=20

eat or to sleep, and given over by the best physicians in France. At length=
, one who had learned=20

some of the art of the Saracens volunteered his services; and under his car=
e Louis's life was=20

saved, though he bore traces of the poisoning all the rest of his days.  Qu=
een Bertrade, like an=20

affectionate mother, had hoped to see one of her own sons seated upon the t=
hrone, and was=20

much grieved at Louis's recovery. Philip, completely under her influence, a=
ctually implored his son=20

to forgive this second direct attempt upon his life; and Bertrade, in a gre=
at fright now that her crime=20

had failed and had been found out, cringed before Louis like a common serva=
nt, and at length won=20

his forgiveness.  Philip determined to be reconciled to the Church. At a co=
uncil held at the close of=20

1104 he appeared as a sincere penitent,--barefooted, with unkempt hair and =
beard,--and solemnly=20

swore never to live with Bertrade again. The curse of excommunication was r=
emoved; the council=20

discreetly went about=20


_
Abraham), and he knew not the way unto it_, he said, Peradventure my Lord w=
ill direct me unto=20

the right way, _or the middle way. And God sent unto him an angel, having i=
n his hand a short=20

spear; and he went with him thither._[262] And when he came unto the water =
(_or well_) of=20

Medyen, he found at it a and had his hair cut, and put on his crown, and ha=
d one ready for=20

Bertrade, too. But the Church was tired of contending with him, and took no=
 further notice of his=20

irregularities, though what happened soon afterward was, if possible, more =
scandalous than all=20

that had gone before.  Bertrade had the=20


_
he found besides them two women keeping away _their sheep from the water_. =
He said _unto=20

them_ (_namely the two women_), What is the matter with you _that ye water =
not_? They=20

answered, We shall not water until the pastors shall have driven away _thei=
r animals_; and our=20

father is a very old man, _who cannot water the sheep_. And he watered for =
them _from another=20

well near unto them, from which he lifted a stone that none could lift but =
ten persons._ Then he=20

retired to the shade _of an Egyptian thorn-tree on account of the violence =
of the heat of the sun;=20

and he was hungry_, and he said, O my Lord, verily I am in need of the good=
 _provision_ which=20

Thou shalt send down unto me. _And the two women returned unto their father=
 in less time than=20

they were accustomed to do: so he asked them the reason and Philip actually=
 went to visit=20

Foulques, in Angers, where all three hobnobbed most amicably, sitting at th=
e same table, or=20

occupying seats of honor in the church, with Philip seated by Bertrade's si=
de and Foulques on a=20

stool at her feet. One can hardly credit a statement like this, but there s=
eems to have been no limit=20

to Bertrade's effrontery, and the complete subjection of Foulques is record=
ed in the Latin life of=20

Louis the Fat: "Although he was banished outright from her bed, she so moll=
ified him that... often=20

sitting on a stool at her feet, he submitted in all things to her will."  F=
oulques, though he sat at the=20

feet of his wife and the king's paramour, and though he ceased to make acti=
ve claim to his share=20

of Bertrade, has recorded his and his wife's infamy for us. One of his char=
ters, for=20


_
informed him of the person who had watered for them; whereupon he said unto=
 one of them, Call=20

him unto me._  And one of them[263] came unto him, walking bashfully, _with=
 the sleeve of her=20

shift over her face, by reason of her abashment at him_: she said, My fathe=
r calleth thee, that he=20

may recompense thee with the reward of thy having watered for us. _And he a=
ssented to her call,=20

disliking in his mind the receiving of the reward: but it seemeth that she =
intended the=20

compensation if he were of such as desired it. And she walked before him; a=
nd the wind blew her=20

garment, and her legs were discovered: so he said unto her, Walk behind me =
and direct me in the=20

way. And she did so, until she came unto her father, who was Sho'eyb, on wh=
om be peace! and=20

with him was_ [prepared] _a supper. He said unto him, Sit and sup. But he r=
eplied, I fear lest it be=20

a compensation for my having watered for and ninety-five after the incarnat=
ion of Our Lord, Urban=20

being Pope, and France befouled by the adultery of the infamous King Philip=
." But this was in the=20

salad days of his wrath, before Bertrade had induced him to sit on a stool =
at her feet and submit to=20

her will in all things.  In the year 1108, Philip, feeling his sins and his=
 diseases lie heavy upon him,=20

determined to take an allopathic dose of repentance to purify himself from =
the first before the=20

second carried him off. He addressed special prayers to Saint Benedict, ord=
ered that his wicked=20

body should not be buried in the royal tombs at Saint-Denis, and clothed hi=
mself in the habit of a=20

Benedictine monk. Thus he expired, having existed--not reigned--as king for=
 forty-eight years, and=20

was succeeded immediately by Louis the Fat, who was crowned within five day=
s after the death of=20

his father.  This haste was not altogether without=20


_
seek not a compensation for doing good. He said, Nay, it is my custom and h=
ath been the custom=20

of my fathers to entertain the guest and to give food. So he ate; and acqua=
inted, him with his=20

case._ And when he had come unto him, and had related to him the story aliv=
e, and not wasting=20

her time in prayers to Saint Benedict. Taking advantage of the disturbed st=
ate of the kingdom, she=20

managed to form a coalition, headed by her brother, Amauri de Montfort, and=
 by the successor of=20

her Angevin husband, to dethrone Louis and=20
