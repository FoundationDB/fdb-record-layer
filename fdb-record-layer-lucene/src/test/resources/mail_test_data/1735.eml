and the bear's wicked claws waving above it, leaped to his feet and started to run to the barn-loft 

door, to scream for help.  At less than half the distance, his feet caught in the meshes of the 

unrolled net, and he measured his length on the floor.  As he quickly untangled a foot, the thought 

flashed into his mind, "Throw this net upon the bear's legs!" In a flash he was at the edge of the 

open floor and hauling the big seine in coils at his feet.  When he had a heap to the height of his 

knees he gathered it in his arms and dropped the coils upon Solomon's waving legs.  The bear's 

claws took instant hold of the stout meshes, and bruin, feeling his feet entangled, wrenched at 

their fastenings, rolling himself over on his side and off the body of the prostrate boy. Perry, well-

nigh smothered, had barely strength enough to crawl out of reach of the whirlwind fight which now 

took place.  Even the cow was awed to silence by the uproar of Solomon's rage as he fought with 

the entangling folds of the salmon net.  The seine needed no attendance. It did its own work once 

the grizzly's legs had been thrust through its meshes.  Coil after coil, the hundred and fifty feet of 

seine came down out of the loft as the bear rolled and pitched and tumbled. The more he tore and 

threshed, the more meshes there were to enwrap and entangle him.  In five minutes from the time 

its first meshes dropped upon him, the net had Solomon so wound and bound that his legs were 

immovable, and he could barely wriggle his neck.  Perry soon recovered his breath, and before 

they ran to the field to tell of Solomon's plight, the two boys had the presence of mind to pen the 

cow up where she could not, should she take a notion, gore the helpless grizzly.  Amid both 

laughter and commiseration, blended with comments on the pluck of the two youngsters, the 

ranchmen performed a surgical operation on the helpless Solomon, extracting the spear from his 

flesh. With much greater difficulty they freed him from the seine and got him back into his lair.    A 

DROLL  "Will you come in?" she said. And her morose face, under stringent commands from her 

brain, began an imitation of a smile which, as an imitation, was wonderful. It made you wonder 

how she had ever taught her face to do it.  Priam Farll found himself blushing on a Turkey carpet, 

and a sort of cathedral gloom around him. He was disconcerted, but the Turkey carpet assured 

him somewhat. As his eyes grew habituated to the light he saw that the cathedral was very 

narrow, and that instead of the choir was a staircase, also clothed in Turkey carpet. On the lowest 

step reposed an object whose nature he could not at first determine.  "Would it be for long?" the 

lips opposite him muttered cautiously.  His reply--the reply of an impulsive, shy nature--was to rush 

out of the palace. He had identified the object on the stairs. It was a slop-pail with a wrung cloth on 

its head.  He felt profoundly discouraged and pessimistic. All his energy had left him. London had 

become hard, hostile, cruel, impossible. He longed for Leek with a great longing.   _Tea_   An hour 

later, having at the kind suggestion of the cabman deposited Leek's goods at the cloak-room of 

South Kensington Station, he was wandering on foot out of old London into the central ring of new 

London, where people never do anything except take the air in parks, lounge in club-windows, roll 

to and fro in peculiar vehicles that have ventured out without horses and are making the best of it, 

buy flowers and Egyptian cigarettes, look at pictures, and eat and drink. Nearly all the buildings 

were higher than they used to be, and the street wider; and at intervals of a hundred yards or so 

cranes that rent the clouds and defied the law of gravity were continually swinging bricks and 

marble into the upper layers of the air. Violets were on sale at every corner, and the atmosphere 

was impregnated with an intoxicating perfume of methylated spirits. Presently he arrived at an 

immense arched facade bearing principally the legend 'Tea,' and he saw within hundreds of 



persons sipping

By C. A. Stephens  When I was a boy I lived in one of those rustic neighborhoods on the outskirts 

of the great "Maine woods." Foxes were plenty, for about all those sunny pioneer clearings birch-

partridges breed by thousands, as also field-mice and squirrels, making plenty of game for 

Reynard.  There were red foxes, "cross-grays," and "silver-grays;" even black foxes were reported. 

These animals were the pests of the farm-yards, and made havoc with the geese, cats, principally 

the word 'Tea,' and he saw within more hundreds sipping tea; and then another; and then another; 

and then suddenly he came to an open circular place that seemed vaguely familiar.  "By Jove!" he 

said. "This is Piccadilly Circus!"  And just at that moment, over a narrow doorway, he perceived 

the image of a green tree, and the words, 'The Elm Tree.' It was the entrance to the Elm Tree Tea 

Rooms, so well spoken of in the _Telegraph_. In certain ways he was a
