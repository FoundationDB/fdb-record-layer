philodendron monstera period of the Sauline persecution, and, as it would a=

(Psa. xxxvii. 1, 7.)  This section gives also a remarkable impression of th=
e irresistible growth of his=20

popularity and influence. The silent energy of the Divine purpose presses h=
is fortunes onward with=20

a motion slow and inevitable as that of a glacier. The steadfast flow circl=
es unchecked round, or=20

rises victorious over all hindrances. Efforts to ruin, to degrade, to kill-=
-one and all fail. Terror and=20

hate, suspicion and jealousy, only bring him nearer the goal. A clause whic=
h comes in thrice in the=20

course of one chapter, expresses this fated advance. In the first stage of =
his court life, we read,=20

"David prospered" (1 Sam. xviii. 5, margin), and again with increased empha=
sis it is told as the=20

result of the efforts to crush him, that, "He prospered in all his ways, an=
d the Lord was with him"=20

(verse 14), and yet again, in spite of Saul's having "become his enemy cont=
inually," he "prospered=20

more than all the servants of Saul" (verse 30). He moves onward as stars in=
 their courses move,=20

obeying the equable impulse of the calm and conquering will of God.  The fa=
miliar Scripture=20

antithesis, which naturally finds its clearest utterance in the words of th=
e last inspired writer--

namely, the eternal opposition of Light and Darkness, Love and Hate, Life a=
nd Death, is brought=20

into sharpest relief by the juxtaposition and contrast of David and Saul. T=
his is the key to the story.=20

The two men are not more unlike in person than in spirit. We think of the o=
ne with his ruddy beauty=20

and changeful eyes, and lithe slight form, and of the other gaunt and black=
, his giant strength=20

weakened, and his "goodly" face scarred with the lightnings of his passions=
--and as they look so=20

they are. The one full of joyous energy, the other devoured by gloom; the o=
ne going in and out=20

among the people and winning universal love, the other sitting moody and se=
lf-absorbed behind=20

his palace walls; the one bringing sweet clear tones of trustful praise fro=
m his harp, the other=20

shaking his huge spear in his madness; the one ready for action and prosper=
ous in it all, the other=20

paralyzed, shrinking from all work, and leaving the conduct of the war to t=
he servant whom he=20

feared; the one conscious of the Divine presence making him strong and calm=
, the other writhing=20

in the gripe of his evil spirit, and either foaming in fury, or stiffened i=
nto torpor; the one steadily=20

growing in power and favour with God and man, the other sinking in deeper m=
ire, and wrapped=20

about with thickening mists as he moves to his doom. The tragic pathos of t=
hese two lives in their=20

fateful antagonism is the embodiment of that awful alternative of life and =
death, blessing and=20

cursing, which it was the very aim of Judaism to stamp ineffaceably on the =
conscience.  David's=20

flight begins a period to which a large number of his psalms are referred. =
We may call them "The=20

Songs of the Outlaw." The titles in the psalter connect several with specif=
ic events during his=20

persecution by Saul, and besides these, there are others which have marked =
characteristics in=20

common, and may therefore be regarded as belonging to the same time. "It se=
ems to me," said I,=20

"that, considering what you owe to Lady Broadhem," and I looked round the c=
rowded room, "you=20

ought not to be too hard upon her."  "Ah, well, I must admit that her ladys=
hip and our friend Goldtip=20

here are doing their best to balance the account; but I have made it a prin=
ciple through life never=20

to be satisfied with anything short of my full money's worth; and I don't e=
ven feel now, if you make=20

my election a certainty, that we shall be more than square."  "What are you=
r other principles=20

besides that of getting your full money's worth?" said I, with a sneer, tha=
t was lost upon Bodwinkle.=20

"High Tory," he replied, promptly. "None of your Liberal Conservatives for =
me this time--that did=20

well enough last election."  "But Stepton is an absolute Radical," said I. =
 "Exactly: that is why he is=20

so important. You see the fact is--here, Goldtip, explain our little game; =
it is all his idea, and he can=20



put it better than me."  I knew from the bold defiant way in which Spiffy r=
aised his eyes to mine that=20

his original and unscrupulous genius had conceived a _coup d'etat_ of some =
kind, so I listened=20

curiously.  "I am going to stand for Shuffleborough, and it is I who want S=
ir John Stepton's vote=20

and influence," he announced, calmly.  "You!" said I, amazed; "what are you=
 going to stand as?=20

and who is going to pay your expenses?"  "I am going to stand as an extreme=
 Liberal, and=20

Bodwinkle as a regular old Tory. He is going to pay my expenses. We are goi=
ng to strike out an=20

entirely new line, and have convictions. He can't come the Liberal Conserva=
tive this time, as one=20

of the Liberals who is very popular has gone in rather extensively for the =
Moderate Conservatives.=20

So there is nothing for it but to come forward as an out-and-out Tory, and =
put me up as a Radical;=20

by these means we hope to floor both the fellows that are trying the trimmi=
ng game. Of course I=20

am not intended to come in--I only split the party."  "But if you stand, on=
e of the others will retire.=20

Look at what has just happened at Westminster."  "Then Bodwinkle starts his=
 wife's cousin Tom--

why, he is rich enough to keep all three Liberals in the field to fight him=
 if necessary; and you are=20

pluck to the backbone, aint you, old fellow?" and Spiffy slapped Bodwinkle =
on the back.  "Perhaps=20

you would like to see our addresses," he went on,--"here they are; I wrote =
them both. I shall issue=20

mine first, and Bodwinkle's a day or two after."  "May I take them home to =
read?" I asked.  "Oh,=20

certainly, and frame your own on their model if you like," said Spiffy, lau=
ghing; "they'll be the=20

neatest thing out in addresses, I assure you."  "Mr Goldtip, I wish you wou=
ld exert yourself, instead=20

of talking politics with Mr B.," said Mrs Bodwinkle, coming up; "there are =
all sorts of things to=20

arrange, and I am sure I don't know who is to take who down to supper;" and=
 Spiffy was carried=20

away upon special service.  "Good-night, Bodwinkle," said I; "your ball is =
a great success, but I am=20

an early man, and hot rooms don't suit me. I understand the political situa=
tion thoroughly now, and=20

without pledging myself to anything, will see what is to be done."  "Of cou=
rse, all in the most=20

perfect confidence;=20


_
of the psalter (Ps. xlii.-lxxii.), which has been arranged with some care. =
There are first eight=20

Korahite psalms, and one of Asaph's; then a group of fifteen Davidic (li.-l=
xv.), followed by two=20

anonymous; then three more of David's (lxviii.-lxx.), followed by one anony=
mous and the well-

known prayer "for Solomon." Now it is worth notice that the group of fiftee=
n psalms ascribed to=20

David is as nearly as possible divided in halves, eight having inscriptions=
 which give a specific=20

date of composition, and seven having no such detail. There has also been s=
ome attempt at=20

arranging the psalms of these two classes alternately, but that has not bee=
n accurately carried out.=20

These facts show that the titles are at all events as old as the compilatio=
n of the second book of=20

the psalter, and were regarded as accurate then. Several points Stepton to =
suspect what we were=20

at."  "Oh, it would be absolute ruin. There is just one question I should l=
ike to ask, Can you give=20

me your solemn word that in all this you have no other motive but the singl=
e one of being of use to=20

your country?"  "Eh!" said Bodwinkle, with his eyes rather wide open.  "I r=
epeat," said I, slowly, "Is=20

your only object in getting into Parliament that you may be of use to the c=
ountry? or is it that the=20

country may be of use to you?"  "I must ask you one in return," said Bodwin=
kle: "Will it depend=20

upon my answer whether or not you exert yourself in my favour?"  "Entirely,=
" said I.  "Then, my=20

dear Lord Frank," said Bodwinkle, affectionately grasping my hand, "believe=
 me, that so far as I=20

am concerned, and I can say the same for Goldtip, our only single desire is=
 to do that which=20

England expects of=20


_
the complete book of psalms as we have it, seem to indicate that these two =
first books were an=20

older nucleus, which was in existence long prior to the present collection-=
-and if so, the date of the=20

titles must be carried back a very long way indeed, and with a proportionat=
e increase of authority.=20

Of the eight psalms in the second book having titles with specific dates, f=
ive (Ps. lii., personal=20

considerations."  I wrung Bodwinkle's hand warmly (I could have crushed eve=
ry bone in it), and=20

threw an expression of tender interest into my glance as I said, "I wonder,=
 Bodwinkle, how many=20

candidates are actuated by these lofty views in the coming election; but yo=
u must not let yourself=20

be too much carried away by your Quixotic convictions. Remember, my friend,=
 what you owe to=20
