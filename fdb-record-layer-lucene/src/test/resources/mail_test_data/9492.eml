E TRIAL   [_Enter=20

a beadle._]  _Beadle._  The magistrates said to me "Come, beadle, go to the=
 court-room, and=20

make ready the seats." So now I am on my way to set the court-room in order=
. [_He walks about=20

and looks around him._] Here is the court-room, I will enter. [_He enters, =
sweeps, and puts a seat=20

in its place._] There! I have tidied up the court-room and put the seats in=
 readiness, and now I will=20

go and tell the magistrates. [_He walks about and looks around him._] But s=
ee! Here comes that=20

arrant knave, the king's brother-in-law. I will go away without attracting =
his attention. [_He stands=20

apart. Enter Sansthanaka, in gorgeous raiment._]  _Sansth._      I bathed w=
here water runs and=20

flows and purls;       I shat within a garden, park, and grove     With wom=
en, and with females, and=20

with girls,       Whose lovely limbs with grace angelic move.              =
  1      My hair is shometimes=20

done up tight, you shee;       In locks, or curls, it hangs my forehead o'e=
r;     Shometimes 't is=20

matted, shometimes hanging free;       And then again, I wear a pompadour. =
    I am a wonder, I'm=20

a wondrous thing.     And the husband of my shishter is the king.          =
        2  And beshides, I 've=20

found a big hole, like a worm that has crawled into the knot of a lotush-ro=
ot, and is looking for a=20

hole to creep out at. Now who was I going to accuse of thish wicked deed? [=
_He recalls=20

something._] Oh, yesh! I remember. I was going to accuse poor Charudatta of=
 thish wicked deed.=20

Beshides, he's poor. They 'll believe anything about him. Good! I 'll go to=
 the court-room and lodge=20

a public complaint against Charudatta, how he shtrangled Vasantasena and mu=
rdered her. Sho=20

now I 'm on my way to the court-room. [_He walks about and looks around him=
._] Here is the=20

court-room. I 'll go in. [_He enters and looks about._] Well, here are the =
sheats, all arranged. While=20

I 'm waiting for the magishtrates, I 'll jusht sit down a minute on the gra=
ss. [_He does so._]  P.=20

._] Here come the=20

magistrates. I will go to them. [_He does so._]  [_Enter the judge, accompa=
nied by a gild-warden,=20

a clerk, and others._]  _Judge._ Gild-warden and clerk!  _Gild-warden and C=
lerk._ We await your=20

bidding.  _Judge._ A trial depends to such an extent upon others that the t=
ask of the magistrates--

the reading of another's thoughts--is most difficult.      Men often speak =
of deeds that no man saw,=20

Matters beyond the province of the law;     Passion so rules the parties th=
at their lies,     Hide their=20

offenses from judicial eyes;     This side and that exaggerate a thing,    =
 Until at last it implicates=20

the king;     To sum it up: false blame is easy won,     A true judge littl=
e praised, or praised by=20

none.             3  And again:      Men often point to sins that no man sa=
w,     And in their anger=20

scorn the patient law;     In court-rooms even the righteous with their lie=
s     Hide their offenses=20

from judicial eyes;     And those who did the deed are lost to view,     Wh=
o sinned with plaintiff and=20

defendant too;     To sum it up: false blame is easy won,     A true judge =
little praised, or praised by=20

none.             4  For the judge must be      Learned, and skilled in tra=
cing fraud's sly path,     And=20

eloquent, insensible to wrath;     To friend, foe, kinsman showing equal gr=
ace,     Reserving=20

judgment till he know the case;     Untouched by avarice, in virtue sound. =
    The weak he must=20

defend, the knave confound;     An open door to truth, his heart must cling=
     To others' interests,=20

yet shun each thing     That might awake the anger of the king.            =

warden and Clerk._ And do men speak of defects in your virtue? If so, then =
they speak of=20

darkness in the moonlight.  _Judge._ My good beadle, conduct me to the cour=
t-room.  _Beadle._=20



Follow me, Your Honor. [_They walk about._] Here is the court-room. May the=
 magistrates be=20

pleased to enter. [_All enter._]  _Judge._ My good beadle, do you go outsid=
e and learn who=20

desires to present a case.  _Beadle._ Yes, sir. [_He goes out._] Gentlemen,=
 the magistrates ask if=20

there is any here who desires to present a specially to comedy, in _L'Espri=
t Follet_ (1641); once=20

opened, it became a common highway. Scarron added to his Spanish originals =
in _Jodelet_ and=20

_Don Japhet d'Armenie_ his own burlesque humour. The comedy of contemporary=
 manners=20

appears with grace and charm in Corneille's early plays; the comedy of char=
acter, in his admirable=20

_Le Menteur_. Saint-Evremond satirised literary affectations in _La Comedie=
 des Academistes_;=20

these and other follies of the time are presented with spirit in Desmaret's=
 remarkable comedy,=20

_Les Visionnaires_. If we add, for sake of its study of the peasant in the =
character of Mathieu=20

Gareau, the farcical _Pedant Joue_ of Cyrano, we have named the most notabl=
e comedies of the=20

years which preceded _Les Precieuses Ridicules_.  Their general character i=
s extravagance of=20

resources in the plot, extravagance of conception in the characters. Yet in=
 both intrigue and=20

characters there is a certain monotony. The same incidents, romantic and hu=
morous, are variously=20

mingled to produce the imbroglio; the same typical characters--the braggart=
, the parasite, the=20

pedant, the extravagant poet, the amorous old man, the designing woman, the=
 knavish valet, the=20

garrulous nurse--play their mirthful parts. If the types are studied from r=
eal life rather than adopted=20

from Italian or Spanish models, they are exaggerated to absurdity. Corneill=
e alone is distinguished=20

by delicacy of imagination and the finer touch of a dexterous artist.  JEAN=
-BAPTISTE POQUELIN,=20

who, when connected with the stage, named himself MOLIERE, was born in Janu=
ary 1622, in=20

Paris, the son of a prosperous upholsterer, Jean Poquelin, and Marie Cresse=
, his wife. Educated=20

at the College de Clermont, he had among his fellow-pupils the Prince de Co=
nti, Chapelle, the=20

future poet Hesnault, the future traveller Bernier. There seems to be no su=
fficient reason to doubt=20

that he and some of his friends afterwards received lessons in philosophy f=
rom Gassendi, whose=20

influence must have tended to loosen him from the traditional doctrines, an=
d to encourage=20

independence of thought. A translation by Moliere of the great poem of Lucr=
etius has been lost,=20

but a possible citation from it appears in the second act of the _Misanthro=
pe_. Legal studies=20

followed those of philosophy. But Moliere had other ends in view than eithe=
r those of an advocate=20

or of the hereditary office of upholsterer to the King. In 1643, at the age=
 of twenty-one, he decided=20

to throw in his lot with the theatrical company in which Madeleine Bejart a=
nd her brothers were=20

leading members. The _Illustre Theatre_ was constituted, but Paris looked a=
skance at the=20

illustrious actors; debt, imprisonment, and release through friendly aid, f=
ormed the net result of=20

Moliere's first experiment.  The troupe decided at the close of 1645 or in =
the early days of the=20

following year to try their fortune in the provinces. It is needless to fol=
low in detail their movements=20

during twelve years--twelve years fruitful in experience for one who observ=
ed life with keenest=20

eyes, years of toil, in which the foundations of his art were laid. At Lyon=
s, probably in 1655,=20

possibly in 1653, a comedy, founded on the Italian of Nicolo Barbieri, _L'E=
tourdi_, saw the light,=20

and Moliere revealed himself as a poet. Young Lelie, the _Etourdi_, is enam=
oured of the beautiful=20

Celie, whom the merchant Trufaldin, old and rich, has purchased from corsai=
rs. Lelie's valet=20

Mascarille, who is the life of the play, invents stratagem on stratagem to =
aid the lover, and is for=20

ever foiled by his master's indiscretions, until the inevitable happy denou=
ement arrives. The=20

romantic intrigue is conventional; the charm is in the vivacity and colour =
of the style. In 1656 _Le=20



Depit Amoureux_ was given with applause at Beziers; much is derived from th=
e Italian of Secchi,=20

something perhaps from Terence; the tender scenes of lovers' quarrels and l=
overs' reconciliation,=20

contrasting with the franker comedy of the loves of waiting-maid and valet,=
 still live, if the rest of=20

the play be little remembered.  The years of apprenticeship were over when,=
 in 1658, Moliere and=20

his company once more in Paris presented, by command, before the King, Corn=
eille's=20

_Nicomede_, and, leave being granted, gave his farce in the Italian style, =
the _Docteur=20

Amoureux_, before pleased spectators. The company was now the troupe of Mon=
sieur, the King's=20

brother, with the Petit-Bourbon as theatre, and there, in November 1659, wa=
s enacted Moliere's=20

once. [_He approaches=20

the magistrates._] Gentlemen, here is the king's brother-in-law who has com=
e to court, desiring to=20

 Beadle, the court will=20

doubtless be very busy to-day. Go forth, my good man, and say "Leave us Pre=

We do not need the legendary old man crying from the pit "Courage, Moliere!=
 voila la bonne=20

comedie" to assure us that the comic stage possessed at length a masterpiec=
e. The dramatist had=20

himself known the precieuses of the provinces; through them he might with l=

follies of the Hotel de Rambouillet and the _ruelles_ of the capital. The g=

cannot be considered.  P. 229.13]  _Sansthanaka._ [_Wrathfully._] Confound =

shuit be conshidered? If it is n't conshidered, then I 'll tell my brother-=
in-law, King Palaka, my=20

shishter's husband, and I 'll tell my shishter and my mother too, and I 'll=
 have thish judge removed,=20

and another judge appointed. [_He starts to go away._]  _Beadle._ Oh, sir! =
Brother-in-law of the=20

king! Wait a moment. I will inform the magistrates at once. [_He returns to=
 the Judge._] The=20

brother-in-law of the king is angry, and says--[_He repeats Sansthanaka's w=
ords._]  _Judge._ This=20

fool might do anything. My good man, tell him to come hither, that his suit=
 will be considered.=20

_Beadle._ [_Approaching Sansthanaka._] Sir, the magistrates send word that =
you are to come in,=20

that your suit will be considered. Pray enter, sir.  _Sansthanaka._ Firsht =
they shay it won't be=20

conshidered, then they shay it will be conshidered. The magishtrates are sh=
cared. Whatever I=20

shay, I 'll make 'em believe it. Good! I 'll enter. [_He enters and approac=
hes the magistrates._] I=20

am feeling very well, thank you. Whether you feel well or not--that depends=
 on me.  _Judge._=20

[_Aside._] Well, well! We seem to have a highly cultivated plaintiff. [_Alo=
ud._] Pray be seated.=20

_Sansthanaka._ Well! Thish floor belongs to me. I 'll sit down wherever I l=
ike. [_To the gild-

warden._] I'll sit here. [_To the beadle._] Why should n't I sit here? [_He=
 lays his hand on the=20

Judge's head._] I 'll sit here. [_He sits down on the floor._]  _Judge._ Yo=
u desire to present a=20

case?  _Sansthanaka._ Of courshe.  _Judge._ Then state the case.  _Sansthan=
aka._ I 'll whishper=20

 _Judge._ All this we know.=20

Why should you farce raised to the dignity of comedy. Moliere's triumph was=
 the triumph of good=20

sense.  After a success in _Sganarelle_ (1660), a broad comedy of vulgar je=
alousy, and a decided=20

check--the only one in his dramatic career--in the somewhat colourless trag=
i-comedy _Don Garcie=20

de Navarre_ (1661), Moliere found a theme, suggested by the Adelphi of Tere=
nce, which was=20

happily suited to his genius. _L'Ecole des Maris_ (1661) contrasts two meth=
ods of education--one=20

suspicious and severe, the other wisely indulgent. Two brothers, Ariste and=
 Sganarelle, seek the=20

hands of their wards, the orphan sisters Isabelle and Leonor; the amiable A=
riste, aided by the=20

good sense of a gay soubrette, is rewarded with happiness; the vexatious Sg=
anarelle is put to=20

confusion. The drama is a plea, expressing the writer's personal thoughts, =
for nature and for=20

freedom. The comedy of manners is here replaced by the comedy of character.=
 Its success=20

suggested to Fouquet that Moliere might contribute to the amusement of the =
King at the fetes of=20

the Chateau de Vaux; in fifteen days the dramatist had his bright improvisa=
tion _Les Facheux_=20

ready, a series of character sketches in scenes rather than a comedy. The K=
ing smiled approval,=20

and, it was whispered, hinted to Moliere that another bore might with advan=
tage be added to the=20

collection--the sportsman whose talk shall be of sport. At Fontainebleau he=
 duly appeared before=20

his Majesty, and unkind spectators recognised a portrait of the Marquis de =
Soyecourt.  Next=20

February (1662) Moliere, aged forty, was married to the actress Armande Bej=
art, whose age was=20

half his own--a disastrous union, which caused him inexpressible anxiety an=
d unhappiness. In=20

_L'Ecole des Femmes_ of the same year he is wiser than he had shown himself=
 in actual life.=20

Arnolphe would train a model wife from childhood by the method of jealous s=
eclusion and in=20



infantile ignorance; but love, in the person of young Horace, finds out a w=
ay. There is pathos in the=20

anguish of Arnolphe; yet it is not the order of nature that middle-aged fol=
ks should practise=20

perverting arts upon innocent affections. The charming Agnes belongs of rig=
ht to Horace, and=20


_
'T is character that makes the man of worth;     But thorns and weeds grow =
rank in fertile earth.=20

7  State your case.  _Sansthanaka._ I will, but even if I was guilty, he wo=
uldn't do anything to me.=20

Well, my shishter's husband liked me, and gave me the besht garden there is=
, the old garden=20

Pushpakaranda, to play in and look after. And there I go every day to look =
at it, to keep it dry, to=20

keep it clean, to keep it blosshoming, to keep it trimmed. But fate decreed=
 that I shaw--or rather, I=20

didn't _shee_--the proshtrate body of a woman.  _Judge._ Do you know who th=
e unfortunate=20

woman was?  _Sansthanaka._ Hello, magishtrates! Why shouldn't I know? A wom=
an like that! the=20

pearl of the city! adorned with a hundred golden ornaments! Shomebody's unw=
orthy shon enticed=20

her into the old garden Pushpakaranda when it was empty, and for a mere tri=
fle--for her money!--

shtrangled Vasantasena and killed her. But _I_ didn't--[_He breaks off, and=
 puts his hand over his=20

over-wise, and therefore foolish, Arnolphe must quit the scene with his des=
pairing cry. Some=20

matter of offence was found by the devout in Moliere's play; it was the ope=
ning of a long=20

campaign; the _precieuses_, the dainty gentle-folk, the critical disciples =
of Aristotle, the rival=20

comedians, were up in arms. Moliere for the occasion ignored the devout; up=
on the others he=20

made brilliant reprisals in _La Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes_ (1663) and =
_L'Impromptu de=20

Versailles_ (1663).  Among those who war against nature and human happiness=
, not the least=20

dangerous foe is the religious hypocrite. On May 12, 1664, Moliere presente=
d before the King the=20

first three acts of his great character-comedy _Tartufe_. Instantly Anne of=
 Austria and the King's=20

confessor, now Archbishop of Paris, set to work; the public performance of =
"The Hypocrite" was=20

inhibited; a savage pamphlet was directed against its author by the cure of=
 Saint-Barthelemy.=20

Private representations, however, were=20


_
_Judge._ What carelessness on the part of the city police! Gild-warden and =
clerk, write down the=20

words "I didn't," as the first article in the case.  _Clerk._ Yes, sir. [_H=
e does so._] Sir, it is written.=20

_Sansthanaka._ [_Aside._] Goodnessh! Now I've ruined myshelf, like a man th=
at shwallows a=20

cake of rice and milk in a hurry. Well, I'll get out of it thish way. [_Alo=

I was jusht remarking that I didn't shee it happen. What are you making thi=

de._] Thank=20

heaven! I breathe again. played in November in presence of the great Conde.=
 In 1665 Moliere's=20

company was named the servants of the King; two years later a verbal permis=
sion was granted for=20

the public performance of the play. It appeared under the title of _L'Impos=
teur_; the victory=20

seemed won, when again, and without delay, the blow fell; by order of the P=
resident, M. de=20

Lamoignon, the theatre was closed. Moliere bore up courageously. The King w=
as besieging Lille;=20

Moliere despatched two of his comrades to the camp, declaring that if the T=
artufes of France=20

should carry all before them he must cease to write. The King was friendly,=
 but the Archbishop=20

fulminated threats of excommunication against any one who should even read =
the play. At length=20

in 1669, when circumstances were more favourable, Louis XIV. granted the de=
sired permission; in=20

its proper name Moliere's play obtained complete freedom. Bourdaloue=20


_
_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Upon whom does the conduct of this case depend?  _=
Judge._ The case=20

has a twofold aspect.  _Gild-warden and Clerk._ How so?  _Judge._ We have t=
o consider the=20

allegations, then the facts. Now the investigation of the allegations depen=
ds upon plaintiff and=20

defendant. But the investigation of the facts must be carried out by the wi=
sdom of the judge.=20

_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Then the conduct of the case depends upon the pres=
ence of=20

Vasantasena's mother?  _Judge._ Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantase=

without, however, giving her cause for anxiety.  _Beadle._ Yes, Your Honor.=

returns with the mother of the courtezan._] Follow me, madam.  _Mother._ My=
 daughter went to=20

the house of a friend to enjoy her youth. But now comes this gentleman--lon=
g life to him!--and says=20

"Come! The judge summons you." I find myself quite bewildered. My heart is =
palpitating. Sir, will=20

you conduct me to the court-room?  _Beadle._ Follow me, madam. [_They walk =
about._] Here is=20

the court-room. Pray enter, madam. [_They enter._]  _Mother._ [_Approaching=
._] Happiness be=20

yours, most worthy gentlemen.  _Judge._ My good woman, you are very welcome=
. Pray be=20

seated.  [141.24. S.  _Mother._ Thank you. [_She seats herself._]  _Sanstha=

You 're here, are you, you old bawd?  _Judge._ Tell me. Are you Vasantasena=
's mother?=20

_Mother._ I am.  _Judge._ Whither has morals from the author's sudden death=
; an actor, armed=20

with the sword of the comic spirit, had proved victorious. And yet the theo=
logians were not wholly=20

wrong; the tendency of Moliere's teaching, like that of Rabelais and like t=
hat of Montaigne, is to=20

detach morals from religion, to vindicate whatever is natural, to regard go=
od sense and good=20

feeling as sufficient guides of conduct.  There is an accent of indignation=
 in the play; the follies of=20

men and women may be subjects of sport; base egoism assuming the garb of re=
ligion deserves a=20

lash that draws the blood. Is it no act of natural piety to defend the hous=
ehold against the designs=20

of greedy and sensual imposture; no service to society to quicken the penet=
ration of those who=20

may be made the dupes of selfish craft? While Organ and his mother are beso=
tted by the gross=20

pretensions of the hypocrite, while the young people contend for the honest=
 joy of life, the voice of=20

philosophic wisdom is heard through the sagacious Cleante, and that of fran=

the waiting-maid, Dorine. Suddenly a providence, not divine but human, inte=

representative of the monarch and the law, and the criminal at the moment o=

in his own snare.  When the affair of _Tartufe_ was in its first tangle, Mo=
