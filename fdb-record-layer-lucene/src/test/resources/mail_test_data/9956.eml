eans one of the most depraved of men, but when a man is devoid of principle=
 it only requires temptation strong enough, and opportunity convenient, to =
sink him suddenly to the _
to enfold the straw, to devour, to consume.  But Pierre did not wait to see=
 the consummation of his=20

work of destruction. Already with a few rapid strides he had reached his fa=
ther's second straw-rick,=20

and this too he set alight, and then another and another, until six blazing=
 furnaces sent their lurid=20

tongues of flames, twisting and twirling, writhing and hissing through the =
stormy night.  Within the=20

space of two minutes the whole summit of the hillock seemed to be ablaze, a=
nd Pierre, like a god=20

of fire, torch in hand, seemed to preside over and command a multitude of e=
ver-spreading flames=20

to his will. Excitement had overmastered him now, the lust to destroy was u=
pon "what you say is=20

ferry true.  The weather feels warmer, and the wind is down.  Perhaps they =
will find us in the=20

mornin'.  Goot-night, my tear."  It was one of the characteristics of this =
testy old man, that he=20

believed it quite possible for a human being to get on quite well enough in=
 this world without any=20

distinct recognition of his Maker.  Once, in conversation with his youngest=
 son and namesake=20

Duncan junior, he had somehow got upon this subject, not by any means in a =
reverential, but in an=20

argumentative, controversial spirit, and had expressed the opinion that as =
man knew nothing=20

whatever about God, and had no means of finding out anything about Him, the=
re was no=20


_
There was shouting and cursing, and laughter that sounded mirthless and for=
ced, and calls to=20

Pierre, and oaths of revenge. Memory, like an evil-intentioned witch, was r=
iding invisibly in the=20

darkness, and she touched each seething brain with her fever-giving wand. E=
very man had an=20

outrage to remember, an injustice to recall, and strong, brown fists were s=
haken aloft in the=20

direction of the chateau de Kernogan, whose lights glimmered feebly in the =
distance beyond the=20

Loire.  "Death to the tyrant! A la lanterne les aristos! The people's hour =
has come at last! No more=20

starvation! No more injustice! Equality! Liberty! A mort les aristos!"  The=
 shouts, the curses, the=20

crackling flames, the howling of the wind, the soughing of the trees, made =
up a confusion of=20

sounds which seemed hardly of this earth; the blazing ricks, the flickering=
, red light of the flames=20

had finally transformed the little hillock behind the mill into another Bro=
cken on whose summit=20

witches and devils do of a truth hold their revels.  "A moi!" shouted Pierr=
e again, and he threw his=20

torch down upon the ground and once more made for the barn. The others foll=
owed him. In the=20

barn were such weapons as these wretched, penniless peasants had managed to=
 collect--scythes,=20

poles, axes, saws, anything that would prove useful for the destruction of =
the chateau de=20

Kernogan and the proposed brow-beating of M. le duc and his family. All the=
 men trooped in in the=20

wake of Pierre. The entire hillock was now a blaze of about Him at all.  "I=
 just go about my work,=20

Tuncan," he said, "an' leave preachin' an' prayin' an' psalm-singin' to the=
m that likes it.  There's=20

Elspie, now. She believes in God, an' likes goin' to churches an' meetin's,=
 an' that seems to make=20

her happy.  Ferry goot--I don't pelieve in these things, an' I think I'm as=
 happy as hersel'."=20

"Humph!" grunted the son in a tone of unconcealed contempt; "if ye _are_ as=
 happy as hersel',=20

faither, yer looks give the lie to your condeetion, _whatever_.  An' there'=
s this great dufference=20

between you an' her, that she's not only happy hersel', but she does her be=
st to mak other folk=20

happy--but you, wi' your girnin' an' snappin', are always doin' the best ye=
 can to mak everybody=20

aboot ye meeserable."  "Tuncan," retorted the sire, with solemn candour, "i=
t iss the same=20

compliment I can return to yoursel' with interest, my boy--what_ever_."  Wi=
th such sentiments,=20

then, it is not remarkable that Duncan McKay senior turned over to sleep as=
 he best could without=20

looking to a higher source than earth afforded for help in his extremity.  =
Happily his daughter was=20

actuated by a better spirit, and when she at last lay down on her pile of b=
rushwood, with her feet=20

towards the fire, and her head on a buffalo robe, the fact of her having pr=
eviously committed=20

herself and her father to God made her sleep all the sounder.  In another c=
lump of wood not many=20

miles distant from the spot where the father and daughter lay, two hunters =
were encamped.  One=20

was=20


_
red and flickering--alternately teased and fanned and subdued by the gale, =
so that at times every=20

object stood out clearly cut, every blade of grass, every stone in bold rel=
ief, and in the ruts and=20

fissures, every tiny pool of muddy water shimmered like strings of fire-opa=
ls: whilst at others, a pall=20

of inky darkness, smoke-laden and impenetrable would lie over the ground an=
d erase the outline=20

of farm-buildings and distant mill and of the pushing and struggling mass o=
f McKay, to whom we=20

have just referred as being in discord with his father.  The other was a Ca=
nadian named Henri=20

Perrin.  Both men were gaunt and weakened by famine.  They had just returne=
d to camp from an=20

unsuccessful hunt, and the latter, being first to return, had kindled the f=
ire, and was about to put on=20

the kettle when McKay came in.  "I've seen nothing," remarked McKay as he f=
lung down his gun=20

and then flung himself beside it.  "Did you see anything?"  "No,=20


_
the barn.  But Pierre, heedless of light and darkness, of heat or of cold, =
proceeded quietly and=20

methodically to distribute the primitive implements of warfare to this crow=
d of ignorant men, who=20

were by now over ready for mischief: and with every weapon which he placed =
in willing hands, he=20

found the right words for willing ears--words which would kindle passion an=
d lust of vengeance=20

most readily where they lay dormant, or would fan them into greater vigour =
where they=20

smouldered.  "For thee this scythe, Hector Lebrun," he would say to a tall,=
 lanky youth whose=20

emaciated arms and bony hands were stretched with longing toward the bright=
 piece of steel;=20

"remember last year's harvest, the heavy tax thou wert forced to pay, so th=
at not one sou of profit=20

went into thy pocket, and thy mother starved whilst M. le duc and his brood=
 feasted and danced,=20

and shiploads of corn were sunk in the putting it into the pot.  "How much =
is left?" asked McKay.=20

"Hardly enough for two days--for the two of us; four days perhaps for one!"=
 answered the other.=20

McKay looked up quickly, but the Canadian was gazing abstractedly into the =
pot.  Apparently his=20

remark had no significance.  But McKay did not think so.  Since arriving in=
 the colony he had seen=20

and heard much about deception and crime among both Indians and half-breeds=
.  Being=20

suspicious by nature, he became alarmed, for it was evident enough, as Perr=
in had said, that food=20

to last two men for three days would last one man for six, and the one who =
should possess six=20

days' provisions might hope to reach the Settlement alive, even though weak=
ened by previous=20

starvation.  The dark expression which had procured for Duncan McKay junior=
 the _sobriquet_ of=20

Cloudbrow from La Certe and his wife, deepened visibly as these thoughts tr=
oubled=20
