rugs,--rag rugs, you know. That's what we had to cover ourselves with. We didn't had no quilts nor 

sheets not nothin like that."  [TR: The following portion of this interview is a near repeat of a 

portion of an earlier interview with this informant; however it is included here because the 

transcription varies.]  "I 'member well when the war was on. I used to turn the corn sheller and 

sack the shelled corn for the Confederate soldiers. They used to sell some of the corn, and I guess 

they gave some of it to the soldiers. Anyway the Yankees got some that they didn't intend them to 

get.  "It was this way:  "The Wheeler Boys were Confederates. They came down the road as 

happy as could be, a-singin':    'Hurrah! Hur rah! Hurrah!   Hurrah! for the Broke Brook boys. 

Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!   Hurrah for the Broke Brook boys of South Car-o-li-ne-ah.'  "So of course, 

we thought they were our soldiers singin' our songs. Well, they came and tol' our boss that the 

Yankees were coming and we had better hide our food and valuable things for they'd take 

everything they wanted.  "So they helped our Massy hide the things. They dug holes and buried 

the potatoes and covered them over with cotton seed. Then our Massy gave them food for their 

kindness and set out with two of the girls to take them to a place of safety, and before he could 

come back for the Missus The Yankees were upon us.  "But before they got there, our Missus had 

called us together and told us what to say.  "Now you beg for us! You can save our lives. If they 

ask you if we are good to you, you tell them, 'YES'!  "If they ask you, if we give your meat, you tell 

them 'YES'!  "Now the rest didn't get any meat, but I did 'cause I worked in the house, so I didn't 

tell a lie, for I did get meat, but the rest didn't get it.  "We saw the Yankees coming. They never 

stopped for nothing. Their horses would jump the worn rail fences and they'd come right across 

the fiel's an' everything.  "They came to the house first and bound our Missus up stairs so she 

couldn't get away, then they came out to the sheds and asked us all kind of questions.  "We 

begged for our Missus and we say:    'Our Missus is good. Don't kill her!   'Dont take our meat 

away from us!   'Dont hurt our Missus!   'Dont burn the house down!  [TR: The rest of the interview 

is new information.]  "We begged so hard that they unloosened her, but they took some of the 

others for refugees and some of the slaves volunteered and went off with them.  "They took 

potatoes and all the hams they wanted, but they left our Missus, 'cause me save her life.  "The 

Uncle what I libbed with, he was awful full of all kinds of devilment. He stole sweet taters out of the 

bank. He called them "pot" roots and sometimes he called them "blow horts". You know they wuld 

blow up big and fat when they were roasted in the ashes.  "My uncle, he liked those blow horts 

mighty well, and one day, when he had some baked in the fireplace, Ole Massy Hoover, he came 

along and peeked in through the "hold" in de chimley wall, where the stones didn't fit too good. 

"He stood there and peeked in an' saw my uncle eat in' those blow horts. He had a big long one 

shakin' the ashes off on it. He was blowing it to cool it off so he could eat it and he was a-sayin' 

"'Um! does blowhorts is mighty good eatin'. Then Massy, he come in wid his big whip, and caught 

him and tied him to a tree and paddled him until he blistered and then washed his sore back with 

strong salt water. You know they used to use salt for all of sores, but it sho' did line. He made little 

use of notes, trusting to his memory, which, naturally strong, was strengthened by habit. Dealing 

with hundreds of people, he kept their affairs in his head and at every halt in his journeys even for 

a quarter of an hour at a railway station he would sit down and write letters of the clearest kind. His 

biographer says that he was one of the greatest letter writers ever known.  If he ever got into 

serious difficulties it was not from miscalculation but from financial embarrassment which in 1866 



pressed upon him in such a manner and with such severity that his property of all kinds was 

largely committed and he weathered the storm only by the aid of the staunch friends whom his 

high qualities and honourable conduct had wedded to his person and his fortunes. In the midst of 

his difficulties he pushed on his works to their conclusion with his characteristic rapidity. His 

perseverance supported his reputation and turned the wavering balance in his favour. The daring 

and vigorous completion of the Lemberg and Czarnovitz works especially had this good effect and 

an incident in connection with them showed the zeal and devotion which Mr. Brassey's character 

inspired. The works were chiefly going on at Lemberg five hundred miles from Vienna and the 

difficulty was, how to get the money to pay the men from Vienna to Lemberg, the intervening 

country being occupied by the Austrian and Prussian armies. Mr. Brassey's coadjutor and devoted 

friend Mr. Ofenheim, Director General of the Company, undertook to do it. He was told there was 

no engine but he found an old engine in a shed. Next he wanted an engine driver and he found 

one but the man said that he had a wife and children and that he would not go. His reluctance was 

overcome by the promise of a high reward for himself and a provision in case of death for his wife 

and family. The two jumped on the old engine and got up steam. They then started and ran at the 

rate of forty or fifty miles an hour between the sentinels of the opposing armies who were so 

surprised, Mr. Ofenheim says, that they had not time to shoot him. His only fear was that there 

might be a rail up somewhere. But he got to Lemberg and paid the men who would otherwise have 

gone home, leaving the line unfinished for the winter. The Emperor of Austria might well ask, Who 

is this Mr. Brassey, the English contractor for whom men are to be found who work with such zeal 

and risk their lives? In recognition of a power which the Emperor had reason to envy he sent Mr. 

Brassey the Cross of the Iron Crown.  It was only in Spain, the land where two and two make five, 

that Mr. Brassey's powers of calculation failed him. He and his partners lost largely upon the 

Bilbao railway. It seems that there was a mistake as to the nature of the soil, and that the climate 

proved wetter than was expected. But the firm also forgot to allow for the ecclesiastical calendar, 

and the stoppage of work on the numberless fete days. There were, however, other difficulties 

peculiarly Spanish,--antediluvian finance, antediluvian currency, the necessity of sending pay 

under a guard of clerks armed with revolvers, and the strange nature of the people whom it was 

requisite to employ--one of them, a Carlist chief, living in defiance of the Government with a tail of 

ruffians like himself, who, when you would not transact business as he wished, "bivouacked" with 

his tail round your office and threatened to "kill you as he would a fly." Mr. Brassey managed 

notwithstanding to illustrate the civilizing power of

"My aunt, she was an Indian woman. She didn't want my uncle to steal, but he was just full of all 

kind of devilment.  "My Massy liked him, but one day he played a trick on him.  "My Uncle took 

sick, he was so sick that when my Massy came to see him, he asked him to pray that he should 

die. So Massy Hoover, he went paper money.  Minor misfortunes of course occurred, such as the 

fall of the Barentin Viaduct on the Rouen and Havre railway, a brick structure one hundred feet 

high and a third of a mile in length, which had just elicited the praise of the Minister of Public 

Works. Rapid execution in bad weather, and inferior

and wrapped himself up in a big long sheet and rapped on the door real hard.  "Uncle, he say, 

'who's out there? What you want?'  "Massy, he change his voice and say, 'I am Death. I hear that 

you want to die, so I've come after your soul. Com with me! Get ready. Quick I am in a hurry!' 

"'Oh, my sakes!' my uncle, he say, 'NO, no I aint ready yet. I aint ready to meet you. I don't want to 

die.'  "My Missus whipped me once, extraordinary effort the viaduct was built in less than six 

months, a display of energy and resource which the company acknowledged by an allowance of 

L1,000. On the Bilbao railway some of the works were destroyed by very heavy rains. The agent 

telegraphed to Mr. Brassey to come at once, as a bridge had been washed down. There hours 

afterwards came a telegraph announcing that a large bank was carried away, and next morning
