that she did not notice the lantern of the rear brakeman bobbing along besi=
de the ties. In a=20

moment he swung himself aboard the private car and his lantern described ha=

The engine answered with a loud cough and the heavy train began to move.  B=

Fred Hatfield, grown desperate because of Ruth's pursuit, leaped aboard the=
 timber wagon. He=20

was a backwoods boy himself; he knew how to handle mules. He gave a shout t=
o which the team=20

responded instantly. They leaped ahead just as Ruth came to the side of the=
 long reach that=20

connected the small pair of front wheels with the huge wheels in the rear. =
 "Get off of that wagon,=20

Fred!" she had just cried, when the mules started. She was directly in fron=
t of the large rear wheel.=20

If it struck her--knocked her down--ran over her! Fred knew that she little=
 on one foot as he spoke.=20

"It makes a fellow feel rather small--and, in my case, that isn't wanted," =
he added, cheerfully.=20

Nothing less like a despairing lover could be imagined; but though he resem=
bled a robin-

redbreast, he was a man quite conscious of the dignities of his position, a=
nd not to be played with.=20

A cold chill of alarm came over Lord Lindores.  "Edith will return to-morro=
w, or next day," he said;=20

"or if you choose to go to Tinto, her mother regards you so much as a frien=
d and favourite, that=20

she will receive you gladly, I am sure. Go, then----"  "No," said Millefleu=
rs, shaking his head, "no,=20

that would be too strong. I never saw the poor fellow but once or twice, an=
d the last time I had the=20

misfortune to disagree with him; no--I can't convey myself to his house to =
learn if I'm to be taken or=20
