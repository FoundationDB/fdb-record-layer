philodendron monstera parishioners on whom those labors have, I fear, made =
less impression than on him. Stone has not only heard thousands of sermons =
in church, but I have repeatedly conversed with him in private on the conce=
rns of his soul, and I have always left him with the discouraging convictio=
n that he is not so much as grounded in the first principles of our religio=
n; that he has always the same assurance of going to heaven, because such a=
n honest, respectable, sober man as he is must by a kind of along the Champ=
s Elysees, brilliant still with electric lights, and full of carriages and =
motor-cars bringing people home from theatres and dinner-parties, or taking=
 them to restaurants for supper.  Down there somewhere was Ivor, going fart=

been telling me how he loved me, how I was the One Girl in the world for hi=

night at about this time he had been telling me how he loved me, how I was =
the One Girl in the world for him, and always, always would be. Here was I,=
 remembering in spite of myself every word he had said, hearing _
vicar.  "I certainly should never go to see her but from a sense of duty," =
said the young man, who=20

had scarcely yet acquired the grace of patience, and to whom a violent-temp=
ered woman,=20

addicted to intoxication, was rather an object of disgust than of pity. "Ho=
w different was my next=20

visit to a sick-bed! How refreshing to the spirit it was to sit by that exc=
ellent man, Ben Stone, and=20

see how calmly and cheerfully a Christian can bear sickness, and look forwa=
rd to death!"  "Ah! so=20

you have been with our poor friend, the carpenter? How did you find him?" a=
sked the vicar, with=20

interest.  "Perfectly peaceful, perfectly happy; not a cloud over his soul!=
" replied Mr. Leyton.  The=20

curate's fair young face brightened as he spoke, but its brightness was not=
 reflected in the=20

countenance of the vicar. It Lord Bob; that it would be rather nice being a=
 Duchess some day; and=20

that besides, perhaps Ivor would be sorry when he heard that I was engaged =
to somebody else.=20

But then, as I said, quite suddenly it was as if a sharp knife had been stu=
ck into my heart and=20

turned round and round. I would have given anything to run after Ivor to te=
ll him that I loved him=20

dreadfully and would trust him in spite of all.  "You look as pale as if yo=
u were going to faint," said=20

Lisa, in her little high-keyed voice, which, though she doesn't speak loudl=
y, always reaches to the=20

farthest corners of the biggest rooms.  I did think it was unkind of her to=
 call everyone's attention to=20

me just then, for even strangers heard, and turned to throw a glance at me =
as they passed.  "It=20

must be the light," I said, "for I don't=20


_
rather anxious tone, that he inquired, "Is he resting on the Rock? Has he f=
ound true peace through=20

Christ?"  "Surely, I should have no hesitation in saying so," answered Clau=
dius Leyton. "His=20

manner, however, was not quite so decided as his words; it seemed rather to=
 convey an idea that=20

an unpleasant doubt had been unexpectedly suggested to his mind. Stone is e=
vidently glad to=20

receive spiritual comfort; he listens, he agrees to everything."  "Agrees! =
yes, he always listens,=20

always assents. How glad I should often have been to have heard a question =
from him,--I had=20

almost said a contradiction; that would have served to show, at least, that=
 some interest in spiritual=20

things had been aroused."  "You surprise me, my uncle," said the curate. "I=
 thought that Stone was=20

a very good man; everybody speaks well of him; everybody seems to like him.=
"  "_I_ like him,"=20

replied the vicar, emphatically; "but it is because I like him so much that=
 I am the more anxious=20

about him. If my only desire for my flock was to have them moral, respectab=
le, regular in church-

going, quiet citizens, kind neighbors, honest men, I should be well pleased=
 if all in the village were=20

like the carpenter Stone. And yet, That was a fib, because when you are as =
miserable as I was at=20

that minute your heart feels cold and heavy, as though it could hardly go o=
n beating. But I felt that=20

if ever a fib were excusable, that one was. "I'm a little tired, though," I=
 went on. "None of us got to=20

bed till after three last night; and this day, though very nice of course, =
has been rather long. I think,=20

if you don't mind, Aunt Lil, I'll go straight to my room when we get upstai=
rs."  We all went up=20

together in the lift, but I said good-night to the others at the door of th=
e pretty drawing-room at the=20

end of Uncle Eric's suite.  "Shan't I come with you?" asked Lisa, but I sai=
d "no." It was something=20

new for her to offer to help me, for she isn't very strong, and has always =
been the one to be petted=20

and watched over by me, though she's a few years older than I am.  Aunt Lil=
ian had brought her=20

maid, without whom she can't get on even for a single night, but Lisa and I=
 had left ours at home,=20

and Aunt Lil had offered to let Morton help us as much as we liked. I hadn'=
t been shut up in my=20

room for two minutes, therefore, when Morton knocked to ask if she could do=
 anything. But I=20

thanked her, and sent her away.  I had not=20
