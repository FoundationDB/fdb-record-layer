prevent the further examination of the remaining psalms of this period. It =
is the less necessary,=20

inasmuch as those which have been already considered fairly represent the w=
hole. The xi., xiii.,=20

xvii., xxii., xxv., and lxiv. may, with varying probability, be considered =
as belonging to the Sauline=20

persecution. To this list some critics would add the xl. and lxix., but on =
very uncertain grounds. But=20

priety but my feelings=20

turn to me; and I will=20

may have entered=20

into for me, but will repay those sums which you have so kindly advanced on=
 my account already."=20

There was a tone of triumph pervading this speech which clearly meant, "Now=
 we are quits. I don't=20

with recur--as, for instance, "the shadow of Thy wings" (xvii. 8, lvii. 1),=
 and the singular phrase=20

xi. 21), which is found=20

only here. In one of these psalms (xxxv. 13) there seems to be a reference =
to his earliest days at=20

 which he learned to=20
