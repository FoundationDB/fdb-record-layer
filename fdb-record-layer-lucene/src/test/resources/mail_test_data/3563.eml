ego Velasquez paid Quevedo to controvert the representations of Las Casas a=
nd to plead the cause of the colonists at Court.  As he was a man of consid=
erable weight and =E2=80=9CBut do tell me please about the Graysons.=E2=80=
=9D  So, as he did not like to refuse anything to that curly head now leani=
ng against his shoulder, her grandfather told her about the handsome _
going to hell on account of the tyrannies and destructions of peoples and k=
ings which are=20

perpetrated in the Indies, instead of being well received and thanked for h=
is service, is forced into=20

conflict with the Council." This ended the discussion, and the concession a=
lready granted to Las=20

Casas, was ratified.  Nothing, however, was ever really ended in Spain in t=
hose days and too=20

many passions had been aroused, too many interests compromised, for the ene=
mies of Las Casas=20

ever to acquiesce in his victory.  The Bishop of Burgos was the last man to=
 accept such a defeat,=20

and to his original stubborn and interested opposition was now added a desi=
re for vengeance on=20

his plain-spoken and successful opponent.  From the material contained in a=
ll the numberless=20

petitions from the colonies which he had received at various times, he drew=
 up a memorial to the=20

King, containing thirty reasons why the concession granted to Las Casas sho=
uld be refused.=20

When these thirty objections were ready the Bishop asked the Chancellor to =
summon a special=20

meeting of the Council, before which they were read.  Las Casas was not pre=
sent at this meeting,=20

but both Cardinal Adrian and the Chancellor notified him and advised him to=
 reply immediately.=20

The Chancellor's request to the secretary of the Council, Cobos, to furnish=
 him a copy of the=20

memorial meeting with no reply, he sent a formal demand for the memorial to=
 be delivered to him=20

without further delay; no denial was possible, but the Council only deliver=
ed him the document on=20

the sworn assurance that it should not leave his hands.  Gattinara gave the=
 required promise, but=20

invited Las Casas and M. de Laxao to supper at his house that evening, and,=
 laying the great=20

dossier on the table, said to Las Casas, "Now make your answer to these obj=
ections advanced=20

against you."  "How, my lord," answered Las Casas; "they were three months =
in forging and=20

drawing them up, and after reading them at your convenience, it took your l=
ordship two months to=20

get possession of them, and now I am to answer them in the space of a Credo=
! Give me five hours=20

and your lordship shall see what I answer."  As his promise prevented the d=
elivery of the memorial=20

to Las Casas, the Chancellor arranged a table for him in his own apartment =
where he could=20

compose his reply, advising him to make it in the form of answers to questi=
ons supposed to be=20

addressed to him by the King.  For four nights Las Casas laboured on his co=
mposition until eleven=20

o'clock, at which hour he supped with the Chancellor and afterwards returne=
d at midnight to his=20

lodging, not without fears for his personal safety, for his enemies were as=
 numerous as they were=20

powerful and sufficiently unscrupulous to use any means for silencing him. =
 No copy exists of=20

these thirty objections and the answers made to them, and Las Casas says th=
at the originals were=20

burned.  From the little that is known of the former, they seem to have bee=
n so frivolous and=20

strained that it is amazing the Council listened to them with patience or t=
hat the Chancellor=20

deemed them worthy of a reply.  The first, for example, stated that, as Las=
 Casas was a priest, the=20

King had no jurisdiction over him to restrain his actions in the territory =
conceded him; the second=20

asserted that by his together.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER IV  THE GRAYSON HOUSE  =
 On pleasant afternoons=20

the president and his little granddaughter were frequently to be seen walki=
ng down street together.=20

Aunt Charlotte found it very little trouble in these days to get her brothe=
r to take his constitutional.=20

The sight of Caro looking like an autumn sprite in her red jacket, was enou=
gh.  =E2=80=9CCome grandpa, it=20

is time for our walk,=E2=80=9D she would announce, and Dr. Barrows would ob=
ediently lay down his pen or=20

his book, and follow. And the sight of her happy, rosy face, as she frisked=
 about in the fallen=20

leaves, the sound of her merry voice as she asked innumerable questions, ma=
de him forget his=20

anxiety over seminary affairs, and before he knew it he was looking up at t=
he blue sky, breathing=20



deeply the delicious air, with something of the same joyousness.  =E2=80=9C=
Grandpa, don=E2=80=99t you think that is=20

a beautiful house?=E2=80=9D  They were walking out Grayson avenue, and as C=
aro spoke she pointed to a=20

large old-fashioned mansion of gray stone, with a row of stately pillars ac=
ross its front. It stood in=20

the midst of extensive grounds where were many fine trees and shrubs, in th=
e background hot-

houses were to be seen, and nearer the street a fountain was sending up a s=
ilvery shower.  A=20

cloud crossed the president=E2=80=99s face as he replied; =E2=80=9CYes, dea=
r, it is a beautiful place. That is where=20

Trolley once lived.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre there any children there?=E2=80=
=9D she asked.  =E2=80=9CNo; Miss Grayson and her invalid=20

brother live there alone.=E2=80=9D  It was a very large house for just two =
persons, Caro thought. =E2=80=9CDid Trolley=20

belong to the sick brother?=E2=80=9D she asked.  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t k=
now; perhaps so.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you suppose he was=20

sorry?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery likely, but it couldn=E2=80=99t be helped yo=
u know, Trolley was determined to live with us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

am glad he did,=E2=80=9D said Caro.  She couldn=E2=80=99t ask any more ques=
tions for Professor Rice joined them=20

and began to talk to her grandfather, but she could think, and it presently=
 occurred to her that this=20

must be the place that adjoined Marjorie=E2=80=99s orchard. She walked alon=
g very soberly, her mind full of=20

the sick man no one ever saw, and the gate that was never opened.  When she=
 and Marjorie went=20

over on the avenue to mail a letter not long after this, Caro asked, =E2=80=
=9CDid you know that your gate=20

opened into the garden of the Grayson house?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy yes, of=
 course. Look Caro! there=E2=80=99s Miss=20

Elizabeth now!=E2=80=9D  They were almost at the gate, and as Marjorie spok=
e a tall, handsome woman=20

crossed the sidewalk and entered the carriage that was waiting for her.  =
=E2=80=9CDoesn=E2=80=99t she look cross!=E2=80=9D=20

Marjorie exclaimed.  But Caro was too much impressed with her elegance to c=
onsider her=20

expression, which was not cross, by the way, only extremely sad.  =E2=80=9C=
Let=E2=80=99s play dressing up,=E2=80=9D she=20

proposed, =E2=80=9Cand I bid to be Miss Grayson.=E2=80=9D  Marjorie was wil=
ling and chose to be Mrs. Rice the=20

professor=E2=80=99s wife who had at present the distinction of being the se=
minary bride. As a coachman=20

was needed, little Tom Turner who sat on the curbstone longing for an invit=
ation, was offered the=20

position, and perched on a piano stool in front of a steamer chair he drove=
 his spirited horses--two=20

rocking chairs--with great skill.  Miss Grayson in an old silk gown of Aunt=
 Charlotte=E2=80=99s swept into her=20

carriage with astonishing dignity any number of times that morning, followe=
d by=20


_
pointed out the danger of his forming an alliance with the Venetians or Gen=
oese and delivering to=20

them the profits of his colony; another accused him of having deceived Card=
inal Ximenez, and the=20

thirtieth or last of all oracularly stated that there were some secret thin=
gs known about him of such=20

a damaging nature that they could only be confided to the King's private ea=
r, and hence were not=20

set down in writing.  This ancient method of Court intriguers everywhere, w=
hose mysterious=20

accusations can only be made in secrecy, without the accuser's identity bei=
ng disclosed, is always=20

new and is ever useful in cases where the condemnation of the accused is de=
termined=20

beforehand.  Fortunately the Chancellor loved the light, and Las Casas was =
furnished the=20

opportunity of seeing and refuting the accusations against him, which he di=
d with entire success,=20

not only clearing himself of every charge invented to discredit him, but, t=
urning the  When they=20

grew tired of this play they went to the orchard, and there Caro decided th=
at it would be quite easy=20

to climb the wall if you didn=E2=80=99t mind the currant bushes.  =E2=80=9C=
You=E2=80=99d better not,=E2=80=9D cried Marjorie, shocked=20

at such audacity, but when she was assured that it was just lovely up there=
, she could not resist=20

and she and Tom followed.  It was an old-fashioned garden into which the ch=
ildren looked, already=20

rather brown and bare except for a few chrysanthemums and asters, but still=
 with a beauty of its=20

own quite different from the smooth elegance of the grounds in front of the=
 house.  They sat there=20

full of delight over their adventure, craning their necks to see as far as =
possible into this unknown=20

land, when there came the sound of footsteps on the fallen leaves.  Marjori=
e was down in an=20

instant, and Tom after her, but Caro waited till an invalid=E2=80=99s chair=
 appeared, rolled by a tall colored=20

man. In the midst of the rugs and shawls a=20


_
threw a flood of light on the maladministration of the colonies and the pec=
ulations from the royal=20

revenues by the Spanish officials.  This crushing answer, which filled more=
 than twelve sheets of=20

paper, was read at a special meeting of the Council, which the Chancellor h=
ad summoned without=20

letting its object be known, and reduced his enemies to humiliated silence.=
  The only observation=20

which even the usually ready Bishop found to offer was that the answer had =
been prepared for Las=20

Casas by the Court preachers.  The feebleness of this must have struck all =
present, and the=20

Chancellor with fine irony asked: "You now hold that Micer Bartholomew is s=
o lacking in argument=20

and discretion that he has to find somebody else to answer for him? From wh=
at I have heard of=20

him he is equal to this and to more besides."  Gattinara presented a full r=
eport of the and Caro=20

who had expected--she didn=E2=80=99t know what--was so surprised that inste=
ad of slipping down after=20

Marjorie as she had intended she sat perfectly still.  =E2=80=9CStop just h=
ere Thompson, I must have that bit=20

of view through the trees,=E2=80=9D said the occupant of the chair, and Car=
o saw he had a camera.  She=20

watched with interest till the right position was found and the picture tak=
en.  =E2=80=9CNow turn me around,=20

so I can get that white birch against the stone wall.=E2=80=9D  Close to th=
e birch sat Caro. =E2=80=9CWait a minute=20

and I=E2=80=99ll get down,=E2=80=9D she called, remembering how provoked Br=
other Arthur was when she got in his=20

way.  =E2=80=9CStay just where you are,=E2=80=9D a decided voice commanded,=
 and Caro staid, feeling not unlike=20

the convicts at the prison who had to have their pictures taken whether the=
y liked it or not.  It was=20

over in a second and then down she scrambled and ran after the=20


_
result that the grant and privileges already conceded to Las Casas were ful=
ly confirmed.=20

Skirmishing between him and the Bishop went on as usual during the final se=
ttlement of the details=20

with the Council and on one occasion Las Casas exclaimed to him, "By my fai=
th, my lord, you=20

have fairly sold me the Gospel and since it is paid for, now deliver it!"  =

BISHOP OF DARIEN.  DEBATE WITH LAS CASAS. DISAGREEMENT WITH DIEGO=20

he opposition to his=20

projects relax; on the contrary, the arrival at Barcelona in  =E2=80=9CCaro=

maybe they are going to arrest you!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t beli=

know Marjorie he--the sick man I mean--is very nice looking.=E2=80=9D  As t=

she added, =E2=80=9CJust think how dreadful it must be not to be able to wa=

GOES VISITING   =E2=80=9CGrandpa tell me about the Graysons please.=E2=80=
=9D  Dr. Barrows hesitated, for it was=20

to him a sad story. He and Caro sat together on the wide hall sofa=20


_
brought a new combatant into the field against him.  On his way from Darien=
 to Spain, Quevedo=20

had stopped in Cuba, where he had heard the complaints of the enraged colon=
ists, who declared=20

that unless his mad campaign against his fellow-countrymen was stopped Las =
Casas would ruin=20

the island, impoverish them all, and destroy every started for the first ti=
me that afternoon. Close to=20

the hearth Trolley lay at full length washing one of his front paws with a =
professional air.  =E2=80=9CI am=20

dreadfully afraid it is going to rain,=E2=80=9D Caro said.  =E2=80=9CWhy my=
