dracaena marginata clean shaven face of the manufacturer near Dunstable was=

the straw-bonnet manufacturer had given place to the swell costume of the p=

an exceedingly cautious policy. I was still for taking bold steps. I recomm=
ended the arrest of Mr.=20

Keeling at once, suggesting, in support of that measure, that in all probab=
ility, if I did so, the other=20

members of his gang would fly, and that evidence of guilt sufficient, at al=
l events, to rebut any=20

claim at common law for the insurance money, would be thus obtained. Indeed=
, I thought, in all=20

probability, it would never be attempted to enforce the claim. This, I argu=
ed, would be the ultimate=20

consequence,  Louisville, though the principal sufferer by the storm, was n=
ot the first. The tornado=20

formed some distance to the southwest of the city, and on its devastating m=
arch toward Louisville=20

mowed clean a wide swath through the woods, and fell upon the beautiful sub=
urb of Parkland. The=20

Mayor=E2=80=99s two-story brick residence parted with its roof at the first=
 shock. The Mayor=E2=80=99s wife was up-

stairs in bed, ill of pneumonia. Her husband and another man seized the bed=
 and carried her into=20

the yard. Scarcely was this=20

oubt, if Mr. Cross, Mr.=20

Keeling, and the old man and woman, the tenants of the hovel, were all arre=
sted, I could get=20

evidence enough to convict the lot--if in no other way, partially by the co=
nfession of one of the set.=20

I added, for the instruction and enlightenment of my auditors and employers=
, and as the climax of=20

my reasoning, that I never yet knew a case in which a gang or a lot of conf=
ederates in crime were=20

seized, that there was not a perfect race between them in tendering Queen's=
 evidence. I=20

prostrated the building.  It may be noticed in this connection, that the mo=
st destructive wind is=20

never in the first shock, the parting gust being usually the most damaging.=
 Doubtless this is=20

because the expansion of the atmosphere within the house at the moment the =
center of calm=20

passes over it weakens the building to such an extent that the rear of the =
tornado, striking the=20

house from the opposite direction, readily overthrows it. No such peculiari=

to allow me a tolerably=20

wide discretion in my personal conversation with Mr. Keeling at the intervi=
