" Stew breathed. "If they're=20

white men they're friendly to us. Perhaps they'll take us off this island."=
  "We can't be too sure of=20

that." Jack pricked Stew's bubble of hope. "They might be Nazis. Don't forg=
et that there were a lot=20

of Germans in these islands before the war--promoters, prospectors, traders=
, spies--all sorts. Now=20

 raw materials.=20

Where did the cargo come from?"  "Right over there," Stew pointed to the we=
st. "We've got to be=20

careful."  "You bet your sweet life we have! We'll take turns keeping watch=
 tonight."  "We certainly=20

will," Stew agreed. "All the same, before I leave this island I'm going to =
have a look at that=20

squealer if it costs me a leg."   At that same moment back on the carrier, =
in the Commander's=20

cabin, Ted Armour was saying to the Commander:  "I think, sir, that somethi=
ng should be done=20

about those two boys, Jack and Stew. They did a magnificent job, sir, watch=
ing that Jap task force=20

up to the minute our bombers arrived."  "Magnificent!" the Commander agreed=
. "I shall=20

recommend that they be given a citation."  "But that's not what I mean, sir=
." Ted was in dead=20

earnest. "Their plane was damaged, but they were not on fire when I last sa=
w them. They couldn't=20

ore irregularity of=20

plications may also=20

occur from other sources; a single wound of entrance may give rise to two o=
r more wounds of exit=20

due to splitting of the bullet, or if the bullet have been divided and the =
larger part lodged in the=20

bone, only the smaller portion passing out, the wound of exit may in realit=
y be much smaller than=20

that of entrance. Again, a bullet may split into fragments before striking =
the body, and of these one=20

may enter the body, or one or more of them lodge. Multiple wounds are possi=
ble even from one=20

bullet, as when it passes through two different parts of the body. Again, w=
hen two wounds, for=20

instance, are discovered, one of them may be regarded as that of exit, when=
 in reality they may be=20

two wounds of entrance, neither bullet having left the body. So while it is=
 possible in some cases=20

to decide which is which, too much dependence should not be placed upon app=
earances of this=20

may not have taken a direct course between them, having been deflected by t=
issues of varying=20

ssues upon the course of=20

bullets, with which works on military surgery deal extensively.  The follow=

"But, sir, all the islands in this region are held by the Japs, are they no=
