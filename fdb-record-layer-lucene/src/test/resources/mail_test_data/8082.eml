"I can't do it, my little Chauvelin," rejoined Carrier, somewhat sobered by this reminder. "I can't do 

it ... you understand ... my Marats taking an aristo to a house of ill-fame where presently I have her 

arrested ... it won't do ... it won't do ... you don't know how I am spied upon just now.... It really

her own free will, or the whole plan falls to the ground.... That fool Martin-Roget must think of a

slightest apparent trace of a sneer, "your reputation shall be safeguarded in this matter. But 

supposing that in the interval of going from the one house to the other the English adventurer 

succeeds in kidnapping her...."  "Pah! is that likely?" quoth Carrier with a shrug of the can.  But 

you must on no account mention--"  He was going to have said, "You must on no account mention 

that I was blabbing to you about this, or that I wanted to find out such a thing," when the sudden 

appearance of Elise's lap-dog announced the fact that its mistress was approaching.  With a
