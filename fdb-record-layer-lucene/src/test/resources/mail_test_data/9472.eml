the versions of Boecklin's "Island of Death."  Against Boecklin's followers=
, whose minds are more=20

or less befogged by their lack of appreciation of paint as a means to an en=
d, we must place=20

Wilhelm Truebner who is a clear thinker and a great painter, with more warm=
th than Liebermann=20

and with a reticent color sense, a feeling for expressive form, a love of r=
eality, and no apparent=20

desire to re-invent the grotesque. His elegance of line in itself sets him =
apart from most of his=20

compatriots, and his knowledge of how to extract from his color scheme its =
essential beauty is=20

greater than that of most modern painters, whatever their nationality. His =
blacks have the depth=20

and luster without unctiousness characteristic of black as the great colori=
sts use it, and in his=20

touches of pale refined color enlivening a black and white composition, we =
have the delightful=20

effect so often given by Manet, as of a bunch of bright flowers thrown into=
 a shadowy corner.  If=20

young Germany were content to follow in Truebner's footsteps we should soon=
 have a revival of=20

the ancient craftsmanship and conscience that animated Holbein and Duerer. =
Young Germany,=20

however, has other plans. To learn of them the reader is referred to Meier-=
Graefe's=20

comprehensive and stimulating volume on modern art. The only representation=
 of the painters of=20

the immediate present given in the American exhibition was confined to the =
Scholle School, which,=20

however, indicates clearly the creative impulse that is stirring in the you=
nger painters. "A warlike=20

state," Blake wrote, "never can produce Art. It will Rob and Plunder and ac=
cumulate into one place=20

and Translate and Copy and Buy and Sell and Criticize, but not Make." This =
has been true of the=20

Germans, but the present generation is bent if it should be attempted. A Li=
eutenant-Colonel Green=20

was sent to Fort Monroe to observe any movements; and one Norris, at Norfol=
k, was employed to=20

give information of any action at the Norfolk navy-yard. A committee of pro=
minent men was sent to=20

Fort Sumter, who thoroughly inspected the works and reported upon them.  Me=
antime, Major=20

Anderson had been preparing, with great caution and foresight, to move his =
command. For some=20

ten days the officers had been apprised that it was advisable to send the f=
amilies of the men to the=20

unoccupied barracks on James=E2=80=99 Island, known as Fort Johnson, a mile=
 and a quarter west of=20

Sumter. The work of mounting guns at Sumter had been discontinued for three=
 days, and the=20

elevating-screws and pintle-bolts sent to Moultrie so that the guns should =
not be used if the South-

Carolinians should anticipate his action, and also to give the impression t=
hat occupancy of the fort=20

was not designed. All stores and provisions at Fort Moultrie which could be=
 carried, and personal=20

belongings, except what the men could carry in their knapsacks, were loaded=
 as for Fort Johnson=20

in the two small sailing-vessels which were to carry the women and children=
.  Christmas Day had=20

been fixed for the transfer, but heavy rains prevented. The delay might hav=
e had other=20

consequences, for, curiously enough, on the morning of December 26th, Colon=
el R.=C2=A0B. Rhett, Jr.,=20

waited upon the governor, with a private warning letter from Washington to =
the effect that=20

Anderson was about to seize Sumter, and urged the governor to secure it.[16=

ready on December 26th, and the quartermaster who was to have charge of the=
 little flotilla,=20

loaded with =E2=80=9Ceverything in the household line from boxes and barrel=
s of provisions to cages of=20

anything. Upon a signal of two=20

_
natural that the strongest impulse toward originality should come to the Mu=
nich painters rather=20

than to the cosmopolitan Berlin men.  The Scholle is a Munich association c=
onsisting of a group of=20

young men who, taking the humble and fecund earth as their symbol, as the t=
itle of the society=20

implies, seek to get into their painting the vigor and intensity of life an=
d force which devotion to the=20

healthy joys provided by our mother Earth is supposed to engender.  They ar=
e like the giant=20

Antaeus whose strength was invincible so long as he remained in contact wit=
h the earth, but who=20

easily was strangled when lifted into the upper air. Their strength also me=
lts into helplessness=20

when confronted by problems of atmosphere and the delicate veils of tone wh=
ich enwrap the=20

material world for the American painter.  But the energy of these young Ger=
mans in their own field=20

is something at which to wonder. They remind one of their critics of a band=
 of lusty peasant boys=20

journeying in rank from their University to the nearest beer garden, singin=
g loud songs by the way.=20

Leo Putz, Adolf Muenzer, Fritz Erler, are the leaders of the group, althoug=
h Alex Salzmann and=20

Ferdinand Spiegel were Erler's collaborators in the famous Wiesbaden Sumter=
 on the plea that he=20

had to report to Anderson that he could not find accommodations. Five pulli=
ng-boats in customary=20

use were available for the transportation of the men. Only one officer had =
been thus far informed,=20

and the men had no suspicion where they were to go when they fell in at ret=
reat roll-call with=20

packed knapsacks and filled cartridge-boxes, carried at parade under a gene=
ral standing order. So=20

little was the movement suspected that Captain Doubleday, second in command=
, came at sunset=20

to Anderson in the midst of the officers to invite the major to tea. He was=
 then informed of=20

Anderson=E2=80=99s intentions, and was directed to have his company in read=
iness in twenty minutes, an=20

order met by an =E2=80=9Ceager obedience.=E2=80=9D Part of this time was ta=
ken in arranging for the safety of Mrs.=20

Doubleday in the village outside of the fort, whither the families of the o=
ther officers were also sent.=20

The men were ready promptly, and the first detachment of twenty, led by And=
erson himself,=20

marched over the quarter of a mile of sand to the landing-place with the go=
od-fortune of=20

 the engineer in=20

charge of the works at Castle Pinckney, had charge of the second,=20


_
entirely capable of offending a less conventional taste than the Kaiser's, =
but they all are doing=20

something which has not been done in Germany for many a long year; they are=
 busying=20

themselves with the visible world and painting frankly what they see. It do=
es not matter in the least=20

that in their decorative work they give rein to their fancy and produce suc=
h symbolism as we find in=20

Captain Doubleday of the third. When half-way across, Doubleday=E2=80=99s b=
oat came unexpectedly in=20

the path of one of the patrol boats, the _General Clinch_, which was towing=
 a schooner to sea.=20

teamer stopped, but in=20
