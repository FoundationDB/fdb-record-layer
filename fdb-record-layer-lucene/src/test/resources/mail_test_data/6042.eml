philodendron monstera dreadfully slow day, then. Good-night!"  It began by =
being a gray day, too. The sun hidden and the wind sighed mournfully in the=
 pines. Long Jerry cocked his head knowingly and said:  "It's borne in on m=
e, youngsters, that you'll see a bit Rintoul started before any of us----" =
 "Rintoul!" said Nora--at least she thought she said it. Her lips moved, a =
warm suffusion of colour came over her, and she looked wistfully in Edith's=
 face.  "He thought he would get to Dunearn before philodendron monstera dr=
eadfully slow day, then. Good-night!"  It began by being a gray day, too. T=
he sun hidden and the wind sighed mournfully in the pines. Long Jerry cocke=
d his head knowingly and said:  "It's borne in on me, youngsters, that you'=
ll see a bit Rintoul started before any of us----"  "Rintoul!" said Nora--a=
t least she thought she said it. Her lips moved, a warm suffusion of colour=
 came over her, and she looked wistfully in Edith's face.  "He thought he w=
ould get to Dunearn before _
proposed to see the matter squared up before we left Snow Camp."  "I'd like=
 to know how we'll get=20

the best of them?" complained Lluella.  "That's so! Mrs. Murchiston won't l=
et us have any=20

freedom," said Belle. "She's on the watch."  "I expect she would object if =
we tried anything very=20

'brash,'" said Heavy. "We have got to be sly about it."  "I do not know how=
 much at fault Tom and=20

Mr. Steele are," said Ruth, quietly. "But so much has happened since they s=
poiled the candy, that I=20

had all but forgotten the trick."  "There now! Ruth will forgive, of course=
," said Helen, sharply. "But I=20

won't. They ought to be paid back."  "Wouldn't it be best to just cut them =
right out of our good=20

times?" suggested Belle.  "But won't that cut us out of their good times?" =
urged Heavy. "And boys=20

always do think up better fun than girls."  "I never would admit it!" cried=
 Madge.  "You always have=20

been a regular Tom-boy, Jennie," said Lluella.  "You ought to be ashamed to=
 say such a thing,=20

Miss Stone," added Belle.  "Well, don't they?" demanded the unabashed stout=
 girl.  "Then it's=20

because we girls don't put ourselves out to think up new and nice things to=
 do," proclaimed Madge=20

Steele.  "Perhaps girls are not as naturally inventive as boys," suggested =
Ruth, timidly.  "I won't=20

admit it!" cried Madge.  "At least," said the girl from the Red Mill,  "We =
don't want to do anything=20

mean to them just because they were mean to us."  "Why not?" demanded Belle=
, in wonder.  "That=20

wouldn't be nice--nor any fun," declared Ruth, firmly. "A joke--yes."  "Do =
you call it a joke on us--

spoiling our taffy and stealing the nutmeats?" wailed Heavy.  "What else wa=
s it? It was a joke to=20

them. There was a sting to it for us. We must pay them back in like manner,=
 but without being=20

mean bout it."  "Well now!" cried Helen. "I'd like to see you do it, Ruth."=
  "Perhaps we can think of a=20

plan," said Ruth, Miss Barbara liked to see her do. Anything in the world w=
ould have been easier;=20

but this and not anything else in the world was Nora's business. And the su=
nny silence of the=20

gentle feminine house, only disturbed by Miss Barbara's ceaseless talk abou=
t John, closed round=20

her. Janet came "ben" and had her orders. Agnes entered softly with her mis=
tress's cap and=20

indoor shawl. All went on as it had done for years.  This calm, however, wa=
s soon interrupted. The=20

Lindores' carriage drew up at the door, with all the dash and splendour whi=
ch distinguishes the=20

carriage of a countess when it stops at a humble house. Miss Barbara had a =
standing prejudice=20

against these fine half-foreign (as she supposed) people. She rose up with =
the dignity of an=20

archduchess to receive her visitors. Lady Lindores was full of anxiety and =
sympathy. "We are as=20

anxious as you can be," she said, kissing Miss Barbara warmly before the ol=
d lady could draw=20

back.  "'Deed I cannot say that I am anxious at all," said Miss Barbara, wi=
th her head high. "A thing=20

that never happened cannot be proved against any man. I am expecting my nep=
hew to his=20

luncheon at half-past one. As there's nothing against him, he can come to n=
o harm. I will be glad=20

to see your ladyship and Lady Edith to meet him--at half-past one," the old=
 lady said, with marked=20

emphasis. She had no inclination to allow herself to be intruded upon. But =
Edith attained what her=20

mother failed to achieve. She could not conceal her agitation and excitemen=
t. She grew red and=20

pale a dozen times in a minute. "Oh yes, Miss Barbara, I feel with you. I a=
m not anxious at all!" she=20

cried.  Why should she be anxious? what had she to do with John? Her flutte=
r of changing colour=20

touched Miss Barbara's heart in spite of herself. No, she would not be a su=
itable wife for John=20

Erskine; an earl's daughter was too grand for the house of Dalrulzian. But=
=20


_
not lose any sleep over it. But if you want to pay them off by showing how =
much we disapprove of=20

their actions, and have nothing to do with their schemes to-morrow, I will =
agree."  "We'll begin that=20

way," said Madge Steele, promptly. "Treat them in a dignified manner and re=
fuse to join in any=20

games with them. That is what we _can_ do."  "Oh, well," sighed the irrepre=
ssible not help being=20

mollified. She pushed an easy-chair towards the mother of this bonnie creat=
ure. "It will be a=20

pleasure to him to hear that there are kind hearts caring for what happens =
to him. If your ladyship=20

will do me the honour to sit down," she said, with punctilious yet suspicio=
us respect.  "Papa is=20

there now," said Edith, whispering to Nora; "and Lord Millefleurs=20
