VETERINARY   Impaction of the Paunch.  Impaction of the paunch (the first s=
tomach or rumen) in=20

cattle, sometimes also called grainsick or mawbound, differs from bloating =
or hoove, mainly=20

thereby that the distention is more solid than gaseous, it being either wit=
h food alone, or with food=20

and gas. Symptomatically it differs also from hoove by the absence of eruct=
ation, and by the=20

hardness of the flanks and the smaller volume of the swelling. It arises fr=
om gorging with almost=20

any kind of food, even with grain or with chaff, at a sudden change of diet=
; but it is particularly=20

liable to arise from a surfeit of turnips, fresh grass, or any other succul=
ent food at the=20

commencement of the season. The instrument called a probang ought to be int=
roduced, either to=20

decide whether the case be one of hoove or one of mawbound, or to ascertain=
 the degree in which=20

the latter disease exists. If the probang bring on a sudden rush of gas, th=
e disease is wholly or=20

chiefly hoove; and if it encounter a solid resistance, the disease mawbound=
, and exists in a degree=20

of aggravation proportioned to the nearness of the point at which the resis=
tance is felt.  In mild=20

cases of impaction of the paunch, when the animal does not seem to suffer m=
uch pain, and is not=20

materially fevered, but merely ceases rumination or chewing of the cud, ref=
uses to eat, and lies=20

long and indolently in one posture, a dose of oil, or a little forced walki=
ng, are frequently sufficient=20

to effect a cure. In cases which, though on the whole mild, are accompanied=
 with a kind of inertia,=20

or with an insuperable reluctance to rise or to move about, stimulants, suc=
h as ether diluted with=20

alcohol and water, may be required to rouse the paunch into renewed action;=
 but whenever such=20

remedies are necessary, they must be given in cautious doses, and always ac=
companied with=20

some gentle purgatives. In very bad cases, when the animal seems sinking th=
rough inertness into=20

death, or in which moans, swells at the sides, becomes almost as a board in=
 the flanks, appears to=20

suffer great and increasing pain, and seems eventually to be overwhelmed wi=
th anguish and to be=20

passing into unconsciousness, it must be promptly decided whether we have s=
ufficient time and=20

encouragement to try the effect of stimulants, purgatives, the stomach pump=
, and other=20

comparatively gentle measures; and if not, we should, without much delay, c=
ut through the left=20

flank into the paunch, and with the hands withdraw the contents. The cuttin=
g operation itself is=20

attended or followed with little danger; but in the extracting of the food,=
 no matter how carefully=20

performed, some small portion is liable to drop into the abdominal cavity; =
and this, in consequence=20

of its indigested condition, resists absorption or expulsion, undergoes an =
irritating decomposition,=20

and may very probably originate some serious inflammatory disorder. Any ani=
mal which has=20

suffered a very bad case of impaction of the paunch, ought, immediately aft=
er complete restoration=20

to health, to be sent to the shambles; for, independently of the lurking da=
nger consequent on the=20

artificial extraction of the food, or even upon the relaxation which follow=
s the administration of a=20

stimulant, the paunch is so much overstretched and injured by the mechanica=
l effects of the=20

distension as to be temporarily incapacitated for the proper discharge of i=
ts functions.   Queries=20

Answered.  PROBABLY RINGBONE.--W. B. S., Sciola, Iowa. In the absence of an=
y information to=20

the contrary, the lameness may be regarded as due to the development of rin=

certain cure for this disease. All that may be expected from treatment is t=
o retard or stay its=20

progress or development; but in all cases more or less stiffness or lamenes=
s will remain,=20



depending upon the extent of its development. Then, subsequent hard work, o=
r any cause of=20

renewed irritation, will be apt to further aggravate the case, and cause ad=

both combined, with subsequent long rest or a season's liberty on pasture. =

HORTICULTURAL  Horticulturists, Write for Your Paper.   Lessons of 1883.  B=
Y O. B. GALUSHA.=20

Progress in all arts and sciences is the one grand aim of all associations =
and of all agricultural and=20

horticultural societies and journals; and to study the results of each year=
's experiences and=20

observations, comparing them with those of previous years, and also with th=
e ideal of perfection=20

which each laborer in these several departments of industry has pictured in=
 his own mind, is the=20

best preparation for achieving desired results in the future.  In the prese=
nt paper we will take a=20

brief retrospect of the fruit crops of 1883, and inquire into the causes of=
 successes and failures.=20

STRAWBERRIES.  We begin with the strawberry, which, though small and unpret=
entious, has=20

been from year to year rising in importance until it has become second only=
 to the apple in the=20

estimation of a majority of consumers.  The past year's experience has taug=
ht, as does that of=20

each year, that great care should be taken in selecting varieties adapted t=
o each particular soil and=20

situation. This may be said to be the important thing in strawberry growing=
.  It is a difficult thing to=20

find such varieties by the ordinary means of selecting; namely, recourse to=
 the catalogues of=20

growers. Man has a wonderful amount of selfishness in his composition. I sa=
y wonderful, for it is a=20

wonder when we consider how much better he would enjoy life were all selfis=
hness eliminated=20

from it, and benevolence, coupled with true self love, were substituted. "E=
ach crow thinks its own=20

young the blackest," and each (almost) originator or "exclusive owner" of a=
 new variety of plant or=20

tree, labors hard to convince himself and others that he has the best of hi=
s kind; but, owing to the=20

weakness of human nature, even the sincere among these are liable to be bia=
sed, and thus=20

mislead others. The only safety, therefore, lies in planting such varieties=
 as you know to succeed=20

well near you in similar soil, while new varieties, commended as superior b=
y persons of known=20

integrity and experience, for similar soil and climatic condition, should b=
e tried only on a small=20

scale as an experiment. If they succeed, you can soon have plenty of plants=
 of your own growing--

if you prefer to grow them. This advice, though often before given will bea=
r frequent repetition--for=20

the desire for "something new" is as prevalent with us now as it was with t=
he Athenians in St.=20

Paul's time. We have seen Big Bobs, Great Americans, and other monstrositie=
s dwindle to=20

pigmies in the hands of ordinary cultivators, and the demand for Sharpless =
become less sharp=20

through its sensitiveness to the influence of Jack Frost; and hosts of othe=
r sorts, really good and=20

valuable somewhere, and under peculiarly favorable conditions to be compara=
tively valueless for=20

general cultivation. Therefore every person designing to plant should repea=
t to himself this=20

injunction--"Go slow on new varieties."  It is not desirable for persons wh=
o plant for their own use=20

solely to select the pistillate varieties; for these, although the most pro=
fusely productive when well=20

fertilized, are liable to overrun their staminate neighbors, and soon rende=
r the "strawberry patch"=20



unproductive, or productive only of small or imperfect fruit. The leading p=
istillates offered in the=20

catalogues now are Crescent, Col. Cheney, Windsor Chief, Jersey Queen, Big =
Bob, Manchester,=20

Green Prolific, Golden Defiance, Champion, Park Beauty, Gipsey, and some ot=
hers.  There are a=20

few sorts, having perfect blossoms, which give profitable returns on a vari=
ety of soils, and which=20

may be considered safe to plant. These are Charles Downing, Miner, Bidwell =
(kept in single rows=20

or single plants), Piper, Cumberland Triumph, Phelps ("Old Iron Clad"), Suc=
ker State, Finch, Capt.=20

Jack (acid), Longfellow (with good, rich culture), Mt. Vernon (late), and f=
or sandy soil, Kentucky=20

(late). This list may be said to constitute the cream of the thousand and o=
ne varieties offered which=20

have been well tested. Of course those who grow strawberries for market wil=
l plant largely of some=20

of the pistillate sorts, owing to their great productiveness.  The past yea=
r has taught the folly of too=20

great haste in removing the covering from strawberry plants; as those which=
 bloomed early were=20

badly damaged by the frost. Plantations, also, which were partially screene=
d by rows and belts of=20

evergreens produced twice to three times the quantity of fruit that was obt=
ained from the same=20

varieties fully exposed. Plants in orchards also escaped to a great degree,=
 for the trees were in=20

leaf when the destructive frost occurred, and thus gave partial protection.=
 Strawberries are at=20

home in a young orchard; the cultivation given the plants is good for the t=
rees, and the slight=20

shade of the young trees is no perceptible detriment to the plants or fruit=
.  The general crop was=20

about one-third an average--the chief damage being done by the frost--thoug=
h the tarnished plant-

bug was very destructive in Southern Illinois, and did some damage in other=
 localities. Prices were=20

from fifty to a hundred per cent higher than usual--supply and demand being=
 the factors, in the fruit=20

trade, as well as in all others, which regulate prices.  Spring is better t=
han summer or autumn for=20

planting strawberries. In thirty years' experience in strawberry culture I =
have never, except in two=20

instances, found any advantage in summer or fall planting, and in these pot=
-plants were used,=20

which are too expensive for general planting and not always preferable. Thr=
ee or four of the=20

varieties named, 100 of each, planted as early in spring as the ground is i=
n good condition, in rows=20

three to three and a half feet apart, and confined, as they run, to narrow =
strips, will give an=20

abundance of fruit for two or three years for a large family. Certainly suc=
h planting and care is as=20

good an investment as can be made upon any farm or in any garden.  RASPBERR=
IES AND=20

BLACKBERRIES  were more nearly a failure, generally, as a crop, in 1883, th=
an strawberries, but=20

owing to a different cause, namely, the severe cold of the previous winter.=
 None of the cultivated=20

varieties escaped unharmed wherever the mercury sank lower than 30 degrees =
below zero, and=20

32 degrees below was marked nearly everywhere north of the latitude of Peor=
ia and Bloomington,=20

in Illinois, and in many places 36 degrees below was recorded. Blackberries=
 also suffered; even=20

the hardy Snyder not escaping; and a similar disaster threatens the crops o=
f these species in=20

1884, for as I write, on a clear, sunny day, the mercury has not risen high=
er than 16 degrees below=20

zero, and this morning (January 5,) was 33 degrees below here in Peoria, an=
d 35 degrees below=20

in Bloomington. The canes went into the winter in good order, however, and,=
 if no intense cold=20

prevails hereafter, the damage may be less than last winter when they were =
not as well hardened.=20

Since we can not prevent the recurrence of these polar region down-pours, w=
e can prepare our=20

canes of raspberries and blackberries for enduring such extreme cold, by co=
mmencing cultivation=20

early in the spring and discontinuing by the middle of June, also by stoppi=
ng the growth of young=20

canes, by pinching or chopping off, when not more than two and a half feet =
high, and again, as=20



soon as another foot in length is made, stopping both uprights and laterals=
. If all weak canes are=20

kept cut out, and those shortened for fruiting the next year not allowed to=
 stand nearer than eight=20

or ten inches of each other, they will become "ripe" and firm in texture be=
fore cold weather=20

overtakes them. The hardiest of the red varieties are Turner, Thwack, and C=
uthbert; and of the=20

black-caps, the Soughegan (earliest), Tyler, and Gregg (latest). The black-=
caps named endured=20

the winter fully as well as the hardy red varieties.  Of blackberries the S=
nyder still heads the list for=20

hardiness and general value north of the latitude named, though Early Harve=
st bids fair to be of=20

value. Taylor was damaged a little more than Snyder, while Barnard, Ancient=
 Briton, and Stone's=20

Hardy rank with Snyder for hardiness.  Raspberries and blackberries should =
be planted early in=20

the spring, if not done in late autumn, in rows six to eight feet apart. Re=
d raspberries may be set=20

two feet apart in the rows, and black-caps and blackberries wider--two and =
one-half to four feet,=20

according to stock of plants or desire for quick returns; for all will bear=
 the next year after planting.=20

Give good cultivation the first year and mulch in the fall, along the rows =
of both raspberries and=20

blackberries, with manure free from grass seeds, and cover the entire surfa=
ce between the rows of=20

blackberries with old prairie hay, corncobs, or straw; or, if cultivation t=
he next year is intended, the=20

inter-row of mulch may be omitted.  The intense cold of these two consecuti=
ve winters should not=20

deter land owners from planting these fruits. These extremes come in cycles=
; and, though old=20

Jupiter is now, and was last winter, exerting an unusual disturbing influen=
ce upon our planet, he=20

will this year calm his temper and give us nine or ten years of respite fro=
m his powerful magnetic=20

sway.  CURRANTS, GOOSEBERRIES, AND GRAPES  were less affected by the severi=
ty of the=20

winter of '83-'84 than by the late frosts of spring, which destroyed the yo=
ung shoots of grapes and=20

the blossoms and young fruit of the berries. Currants are yearly growing in=
 favor and the price of=20

the fruit advancing; and now currant culture is profitable and likely to co=
ntinue so for a series of=20

years.  Ground can not well be made too rich for currants and gooseberries.=
 Plant in rows four feet=20

apart and plants three feet apart in the rows; give thorough culture or dee=
p mulch over the entire=20

surface, cut out all wood of three years' growth (or after first crop is of=
ten considered better), and a=20

good crop is almost certain. Red Dutch, White Grape, Victoria, and Versaill=
es are still the favorites;=20

and American Seedling (or Cluster) and Houghton are usually the most profit=
able gooseberries.=20

Every one who can raise corn and potatoes can as easily raise, with little =
trouble and expense,=20

grapes enough for a family's use. Plant such hardy sorts as Moore's Early, =
Worden, Concord, and=20

Martha, in rows seven or eight feet apart, and same distance in the row, gi=
ve good cultivation the=20

first year, cut back to two or three feet in autumn, lay the short canes on=
 the ground and hold down=20

with a spadeful of earth. Plant posts four feet high and stretch two No. 15=
 wires along them--the=20

upper one on top--and in the spring, as the vines grow, tie to the wires, k=
eeping one cane only for=20

fruit this year and two new ones for next year's fruiting; and a crop is as=
 certain as a crop of corn.=20

Cut out weak canes every year, and encourage those starting nearest the gro=
und, cutting back=20

each autumn one-half or two-thirds the growth; cut out old canes. It is not=
 necessary to lay the=20

canes down and hold them to the ground or cover in this latitude, though th=
is work will pay well.  In=20

two weeks orchards will be discussed.     ILLINOIS HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.  =
 The annual=20

meeting of the Executive Board of the State Horticultural Society was held =
in the agricultural=20

rooms at Springfield, January 9th. Present: John M. Pearson, Godfrey, Presi=
dent; A. C.=20

Hammond, Warsaw, Secretary; S. M. Slade, Elgin, Arthur Bryant, Princeton, D=
r. A. G. Humphrey,=20



Galesburg, H. M. Dunlap, Champaign, and E. A. Reihl, Alton.  A large amount=
 of routine business=20

was transacted, not of public interest, after which the board proceeded to =
arrange for a grand fruit=20

exhibition, to be made by the society at the next State Fair. This collecti=
on will not be entered for a=20

premium, but only to show the diversified horticultural products of the Sta=
te.  The public-spirited=20

citizens of Illinois, and particularly of Chicago, have decreed that the St=
ate Fair of 1884 shall=20

eclipse anything of the kind ever held in the Northwest, and the State Hort=
icultural Society,=20

desiring to keep abreast of the times, will make a display of fruit that th=
e State may well be proud=20

of.  It was also decided to offer liberal premiums for horticultural produc=
ts to be exhibited at the=20

next winter meeting, which will be held in the Industrial University, at Ch=
ampaign, the first or=20

second week in December.  After some discussion as to the best method of in=
teresting the=20

students in our work, it was decided to offer premiums, first and second, f=
or the best essays on=20

horticultural subjects. The board and members of the society hope that this=
 offer will be the means=20

of bringing out a number of papers from the young gentlemen and ladies of t=
he institution.  There=20

seems to be a determination evinced by the members of the board and society=

A. C. HAMMOND, Sec'y.     DIOGENES IN HIS TUB.   And first, Diogenes would =
discourse of that=20

remarkable polar wave that struck us on Saturday the 5th of the year, and i=
ts probable effect on=20

the fruit product. Great fear is manifested on all sides, and not without g=
rounds: yet the conditions,=20

it seems to me, have been so favorable that there is cause for hope. Rememb=
er that there was no=20

very sudden change, the temperature having been low for two or three weeks =
before, and no=20

sudden rise since. The sudden changes seem to be the ones--coming in the mi=
dst of winter--that=20



are the most destructive to our fruits. So I conclude there is ground yet f=
or hope; and unless some=20

future disaster should occur, Dio., if living, will expect to eat of severa=
l sorts of fruit this year grown=20

on his own grounds. Keep in good heart, brethren; Providence will send us a=
ll we deserve.  But=20

hasn't that man at Cape Girardeau a level head? Dio. himself could not have=
 given as many=20

sensible suggestions concerning farmers' libraries, as he did in No. 1. All=
 farmers and=20

horticulturists can not go as deeply into periodicals as he, but they can p=
rofitably go much deeper=20

than they do. Take a farmer's home provided on his plan, and then imagine, =
if you can, sensible=20

sons running off to breaking on freight trains, or selling soap and candies=
 behind counters!=20

Improbable.  And then, again, in No. 2, his thoughts on naming country hous=
es. How suggestive!=20

The Editor in No. 1, favors interdiction of French liquors, etc., as retali=
ation for their interdiction of=20

American pork. Dio. says interdict them as a matter of protection to oursel=
ves, without regard to=20

hog or hominy.  "Man of the Prairie" was looking out for a little colder we=
ather. Did he find it--and is=20

he satisfied?  An extremely suggestive paper that, of Prof. Budd's on the "=
Cherry Possibilities."=20

Further investigation in the wide field of European horticulture is demande=
d, not only in regard to=20

this but to most other fruits. Even unpromising sorts, not prized there, tr=
ansplanted here, may turn=20

out to be the most valuable of any. I fear the agricultural colleges are no=

feel thankful to Prof. B.,=20

for his presence and wise counsel at its late Bloomington meeting. His rema=

valuable reading in the forth-coming volume of Transactions.  Seedsmen's ca=
talogues will soon be=20

floating around thick as autumn leaves, and planters will be puzzled what t=
o buy. My experience=20

may be worth something: Of tomatoes, I know nothing better than Acme and Tr=
ophy, and I think=20

favorably of the Golden Trophy--though with some the color is objectionable=
. The Short-horn=20

carrot can't be beat for table use, nor the Egyptian beet. Of the former, p=
lanted pretty thick in good=20

soil, in rows two feet apart, 400 bushels per acre can easily be grown; and=
 besides being good for=20

stock, they are mighty good for men and women. In squashes the Hubbard and =
Boston Marrow=20

are standbys, and that little Perfect Gem is likely to prove A No. 1. And g=

Evergreen sweet corn and the Winningstadt cabbage yet all the time. But Dio=
. will not be fooled=20

with so many new sorts in 1884 as he has been in former years.  Yes--increa=

and his interests.  Next time Dio. proposes to call up a subject of much im=
portance to everybody,=20

and one that badly needs ventilating.      DIO.     POSSIBILITIES OF CHERRY=
 GROWING.   The=20

insertion of one little word gives too unfavorable an idea of the best vari=
eties of the Griotte=20

cherries, grown all over the interminable steppes north and east of the Car=
pathian mountains in=20

Europe.  As printed the paragraph reads: "Some of the thin-twigged Griottes=
, with dark skins and=20

colored juice, are as large as the Morello and nearly or quite as sweet."  =
The copy reads--or=20

should read--"as large as the English Morello and nearly or quid sweet."  A=
s you say my object in=20

talking the matter up is the hope of interesting some of the large nurserym=
en, like those at=20

Bloomington, in the desirable work of importing and propagating the Griotte=
s, Amarells, and the=20

Asiatic sweet cherries known as "Spanish," of the East plain, on a large sc=
ale.  Why should our=20

Western propagators permit our importing of fruits, ornamental trees and sh=
rubs, to be done by=20

the nurserymen of the Eastern States.  If we turn to a good map of Europe w=
e will see at a glance=20

that the importing of fruits so far has been from the west coast of France,=
 Belgium, and Holland, or=20



from the south of England. As with our west coast, this whole region has be=
en made a land of=20

verdure by the soft, humid air of the Gulf stream. Tracing on the map the l=
ine of the Carpathian=20

and Caucasus mountains, we find three-fourths of all Europe, north and east=
 of these ranges,=20

without a mountain or hill traced on the great expanse except the Valdai hi=
lls, and these are only=20

bluffs not as high or extensive as those of our rivers and dividing ridges.=
 It is the greatest plain=20

section of the world, and is the ancient home of the best fruits of the tem=
perate zones. Common=20

sense should lead us to give trial to the horticultural products of this pl=
ain. To find apples, pears,=20

cherries, and plums as hardy, and as well adapted to the hot summers and co=
ld winters of Illinois=20

and Iowa as the Fameuse apple, we need not enter the empire of Russia. Nort=
heastern Austria=20

has a variable summer and winter climate, which will not permit the growing=
 of apples of the grade=20

of hardiness of the Ben Davis, Stark, Jonathan, and Dominie; of pears of th=
e grade of Flemish=20

Beauty, or of cherries of the grade of Early Richmond as to foliage and abi=
lity to endure low=20

temperature. The commercial nursery-man who will visit the "King's Pomologi=
cal Institute," at=20

Proskau, in North Silesia, will see at a glance, as he wanders over the gro=
und, that the fruits,=20

forest trees, ornamental trees and shrubs of the nurseries of England, Fran=
ce, Belgium, etc.,=20

suddenly disappear with the Carpathians on the edge of the great steppes.  =

ame as for plant=20

culture in pots; the best is that formed by rotted sods with a little well =
decomposed stable manure=20

mixed with it.  Rhubarb requires deep, rich soil. A good dressing of well-r=
otted manure, put on the=20

ground this winter when it is not frozen, will start off the plants briskly=
 in the spring. The same is=20

true for asparagus.  Mr. Russel Heath, Carpenteria, Cal., has an "English w=
alnut orchard" of two=20

hundred acres of rich, level land, near the sea-shore. The trees are from t=
en to twenty-five years=20

planted. His crop in 1882 was 630 sacks of 70 pounds each; this season he e=
xpects the harvest=20

will aggregate about one-third more.  Gardener's Monthly: The writer found =
among the gardeners=20

in Canada, when in that country recently, that the English plan of preservi=
ng grapes in bottles of=20

water was in not uncommon use. The bunches are cut with pieces of stems, an=
d then so arranged=20

that the ends are in bottles of water. By this plan the grapes can be prese=
rved far into the spring=20

season.  The American Cultivator: "Can you tell we what kind of weather we =
may expect next=20

month?" wrote a farmer to the editor of his paper, and the editor replied: =
"It is my belief that the=20

weather next month will be like your subscription bill." The farmer wondere=
d for an hour what the=20

editor was driving at, when he happened to think of the word "unsettled," a=
nd he sent a postal note=20

forthwith.  The Farmer and Fruit Grower: Mr. Willis, Lamer, a prominent fru=
it grower of the Cobden=20

region, says he very distinctly remembers that the freeze of 1864 killed yo=
ung fruit trees to the=20

snow line, and that he cut his peach trees to that line, and saved that muc=
h. In 1864 the=20

temperature was about the same as it was on January 5, 1884--in the neighbo=
rhood of 21 degrees=20

below zero. Mr. Lamer thought no damage was done to strawberry plants.  A p=
omologist gives the=20

following excellent advice in regard to maintaining the fertility of fruit =
lands: "Encourage the utmost=20

variety of vegetable growth near and upon your orchard lands, and never rob=
 the soil of its honest=20

dues. Give judicious and thorough cultivation and pruning; and with our gen=
erous soils and=20

climate, I do not believe the child is yet born that will live to see our o=
rchards languish on account=20

of poverty of soil, or any necessity arise for the importation of fertilize=
rs."  The Country Gentleman=20

says two things are necessary for the growing of good asparagus, namely, pl=
enty of room for the=20



plant to grow, and copious manuring. The latter is best applied to thick be=
ds by covering the whole=20

surface with manure two or three inches thick, late in autumn, and forking =
it in very early in spring,=20

before the new shoots start. Thick beds, however, should not be planted, bu=
t the plants allowed=20

three or four feet each way to each. Three by five is a common and suitable=
 distance, and large=20

stalks may be obtained in this way.  Charles Merritt, of Battle Creek, has =
been very successful with=20

strawberries. His plan is to plant rows about two and one-half feet apart a=
nd plants nine inches in=20

the row; he prefers the spring time. He manures highly, cultivates thorough=
ly and mulches with=20

clean straw late in the autumn. The next season he gets a large crop, and, =
while he is taking it off,=20

another patch is being treated in a similar manner for the next year's crop=
. The second year with=20

any bed he simply pulls out the weeds, and after picking turns it under. Th=
is plan proves to be=20

satisfactory.  T. F. Leeper, of Warsaw Horticultural Society, says: I have =
been greatly interested in=20

the condition of orchards this season, and have examined quite a number. On=
e orchard in my=20

neighborhood died during the summer--I supposed it was winter-killed, but a=
n investigation=20

showed that the roots had been destroyed by mice. Last spring I reported a =
number of trees in my=20

orchard, winter-killed. These trees have been dug up and it appears that th=
ey too, were killed by=20

mice. In my orchard the greatest injury by winter-killing has occurred in t=
he draws or low places=20

and I would not plant another orchard without tile drawing such places.    =

_Description and Natural Classification of the Genus Floerkea, by_ C. S. RA=
FINESQUE.   This=20

genus was discovered in Pennsylvania, near Lancaster, by the Rev. Dr. Muhle=
nberg, who=20

communicated the same to Wildenow of Berlin. This celebrated botanist ascer=
tained that it was a=20

new genus, to which he gave the name of a German botanist, (Floerke) and pu=
blished it in the=20

third volume of the transactions of the society _des Curieux de la Nature_ =
of Berlin, for 1801,=20

under the name of _Floerkea proserpinacoides_, which long and uncouth speci=
fic name has been=20

changed by every subsequent author. Michaux has omitted it altogether, (wit=
h many more=20

American species) in his _Flora Boreali Americana_, published in 1803. Pers=
oon calls it _Floerkea=20

lacustris_, in Syn. plant. 1. p. 393. Muhlenberg _Floerkea uliginosa_, in C=
at. pl. Amer. Sept. p. 36.=20

and Pursh, in Flora Amer. Sept. 1. p. 239, unites it with the genus _Nectri=
s_, and calls it _Nectris=20

pinnata_, putting it therefore in the Hexandria digynia of Linn=C3=A6us, wh=
ile all the preceding authors=20

had classed it in the Hexandria monogynia. I will show presently which amon=
g them appear to be=20

wrong; but I must notice before, that no botanist had, I believe, endeavour=
ed to class it naturally,=20

until Mr. Correa de Serra, who in his _reduction of American genera to the =
natural families of=20

Jussieu_, attempted, without having had an opportunity to see the plant, to=
 place it in the family of=20

_Junci_, taking it therefore to be a monocotyle plant; being led into this =
error by a mistaken idea,=20

that all hexandrous plants must be monocotyle! But in the spring of 1816, I=
 found this plant in the=20

neighbourhood of Philadelphia, (near the falls of the Schuylkill) where it =
had escaped the attention=20

of all the botanists of that city, and in particular of Dr. William Barton,=
 who has therefore omitted it=20

in his Prodr. fl. Philad. and having communicated it to Mr. Correa, he ackn=
owledged that it was=20

dicotyle, of which fact I was aware, even before seeing the plant and disse=
cting its seed, by=20

attending to its habit.  The following exact description of this genus will=

ed, the superior pinnated,=20

quinate, pinnules linear-oblong obtuse, flowers axillar, solitary, and on l=
ong peduncles, swelled=20

under the flower.  Among the several specific names given to this plant, I =
prefer Muhlenberg's, as=20

it expresses exactly the kind of situations where it grows, say in moist gr=
ounds, occasionally=20

swampish or overflowed; those I found near Philadelphia, grew by thousands =
on the banks of a=20

small brook in a wood below the left side of the falls of Schuylkill. Perso=
on's name of _lacustris_,=20

being wrong, as it would seem to imply that it grows in lakes only; and Wil=
denow's name being too=20

long and illusive, its similarity of habit with the genus _Proserpinaca_ no=
t being very striking.=20

However, even the name of _uliginosa_ is liable to some slight objection; a=
nd did I think myself=20



permitted to coin a new name, while so many have been proposed already, I s=
hould have called it=20

either _F. tenella_, or _F. flaccida_, or _F. olitoria_, being a very delic=
ate and tender plant, and=20

very good to eat in sallad, as I have tried it myself, its taste is sweet a=
nd pleasant, the whole plant=20

may be eaten, (even the root) being all juicy and tender: it grows in such =
an abundance in some=20

spots, that it might occasionally afford a most precious and delightful sal=
lad, but if cultivated for=20

that purpose, it might be found an agreeable addition to our culinary herbs=
.  In addition to my=20

above definition, it will be proper to state that the stem of this plant ri=
ses from 4 to 8 inches, it is=20

cylindrical, smooth, and yellowish, the middle leaves are the largest, the =
lower peduncles are=20

longer than the leaves, and the upper ones shorter, the petals or interior =
sepals, and the stamens=20

are yellow. It blossoms in May, and is annual, it even lasts only three mon=
ths.  It will be perceived=20

that I do not agree with Mr. Pursh, in uniting this plant with the genus _N=
ectris_: he owns himself=20

that it deviates a _little_ from the generic character of _Nectris_, but th=
ese deviations appear to=20

me very material; they exist in the pistils and fruits, the most essential =
parts of the flowers, since=20

they agree in the perigone and stamens. The genus _Nectris_ (or _Calomba_ o=
f Aublet) has _two=20

ovaries_, _two styles_, and _two polispermous capsules_, or _achens_! and b=
elongs therefore to=20

the second order _Perimesia_, (class _Eltrogynia_) eighth family _Achenopsi=
a_ next to the genus=20

_Myriophyllum_: while the genus Floerkea which has a _bilobed ovary_, _one =
central style_, _two=20

stigmas_, and _one bilocular dispermous achen_, must belong to the eleventh=
 order of the same=20

class; _Isostimia_, which is characterized by having more than one stigma, =
the stamens in regular=20

number, and not central; it will form a connecting link between this order =
and the foregoing=20

_Polymesia_, by its affinity with many genera of the _Euphorbia's_ tribe, s=
uch as _Callitriche_,=20

_Tragia_, _Mercurialis_, &c. from which it differs merely by having hermaph=
rodite flowers, and=20

perispheric regular stamens. It will at present stand nearly isolated in th=
is order, where it may form=20

the small family _Galenidia_, along with the genus _Galenia_, &c. and which=
 shall have much=20

affinity with the family _Phytolacia_; but this differs by having a multilo=
cular berry, while the=20

_Galenia_ merely differs by having a 4 sided perigone, 8 stamens, and 2 sty=
les.  I admit, however,=20

that there is a strong affinity between the genera _Floerkea_ and _Nectris_=
, but stronger affinities=20

often exist in plants of different classes. If, however, it should happen t=
hat Aublet[54] might have=20

been mistaken in describing the ovaries and capsules of the _Nectris_ as do=
uble, if they should=20

prove to be simple but bilobed, then the _Nectris_ would belong to the same=
 family as the=20

_Floerkea_; but yet stand as a peculiar genus distinguished by having 2 sty=
les, and the achens=20

not monospermous!  It was insinuated to me by Mr. Correa, that the _Floerke=
a_ might have some=20

affinity with the tribe of _Ranunculaceous_, but I cannot discover any, sin=
ce that tribe is widely=20

different, by having many ovaries, stamens, and fruits, each ovary with 1 s=
tyle or stigma, a=20

deciduous perigone, the anthers adnate, &c. The analogy in the structure of=
 the seed and habit, is=20

too slight to be taken in consideration.     ART. IX. _Descriptions of Thre=

Esq. M.D., &c._  The following description of a new species of Gnaphalium, =
accompanied with a=20

drawing, has been in my possession for two years. If the subsequent observa=
tions will be of use to=20

correct error, or solve doubts which may have existed concerning some speci=
es of gnaphalium,=20

they are at your service.    E. IVES.   This plant was first observed by me=
, in company with Mr. C.=20

Whitlow, in July, 1817, by the margin of a brook, a few rods north of Mr. E=
. Whitney's gun=20

manufactory, near New-Haven. It is also found on the margin of the Housaton=
ick, about thirty=20

miles from Long Island sound, where it was observed by Dr. Alfred Monson, t=
he last summer.=20

Specimens of this plant were sent to Z. Collins, Esq. of Philadelphia, for =
the purpose of comparing=20

it with the species of gnaphalium in Muhlenberg's herbarium, more particula=
rly with the _luteo-

album_ and _Pennsylvanicum_, which I had not seen.  [Illustration: _Gnaphal=
ium decurrens._]  I=20

am indebted to the politeness of Mr. Collins, for the facts on this subject=
 relative to Muhlenberg's=20

herbarium. He observes, "your Gnaphalium is certainly not the _luteo-album_=
 of Muhlenberg,=20

which may not strictly be a native, but introduced. Yours most approaches G=
. polycephalum Mx.=20

Still, from the decurrent leaves and other differential marks, it appears t=
o me to be a new species.=20

Muhlenberg's collection has it not."  As the _luteo-album_ is said to grow =
in New-England, yet so=20

far as my observation has extended it has not been found by any of the bota=
nists, I am induced to=20

believe that this opinion has arisen from some erroneous description of the=
 plant which is the=20

subject of this paper.  As the decurrent leaves of this Gnaphalium distingu=
ish it so obviously from=20

all the other American species of Gnaphalium, I propose to give it the spec=
ific name of=20

_decurrens_.   _Specific description of Gnaphalium Decurrens (large life ev=

descriptions and notices of some of the animal productions of our country, =
chiefly fossil, and of=20

which some are but little known, should be found of sufficient interest to =
occupy a place in the=20

Journal of Science, they are very much at your service for that work.  The =
greater portion of them=20

are extracted, with some modification, from an essay which I read about thr=
ee years ago, to the=20

Academy of Natural Sciences, without any intention at the time of giving pu=
blicity to them. But the=20

rapid diffusion of a taste for geological research, seems to require corres=
ponding exertions on the=20

part of those who have attended to fossil remains, inasmuch as geology, in =
order to be eminently=20

furnished with every advantage that may tend to the developement of many im=
portant results,=20

must be in part founded on a knowledge of the different genera and species =
of reliqui=C3=A6, which the=20

various accessible strata of the earth present. The accessory value of this=
 species of knowledge,=20

is now duly estimated in Europe, as affording the most obvious means of est=
imating, with the=20

greatest approximation to truth, the comparative antiquity of formations, a=
nd of strata, as well as of=20

identifying those with each other which are in their nature similar.  Certa=
inly very little is yet known=20

about the fossils of North America, and very little can be known accurately=
, until we shall have it in=20

our power to compare them with approved detailed descriptions, plates, or s=
pecimens of those of=20

Europe; which have been made known to the world by the indefatigable indust=
ry, and scientific=20

research of Lamarck and other naturalists.  America is rich in fossils. In =
many districts of the=20

United States, vast beds of fossil shells, zoophytes, &c. are deposited, wh=
ich, for the most part,=20

are concealed from the inquiring eye, offering superficially a mere confuse=
d mass of mutilated=20

fragments. These rich repositories must finally be exposed to view, by the =
onward pace of=20

improvement, and the more interior strata will be unveiled by some fortunat=
e profound=20

excavations, the result of enterprise in the pursuit of gain. The very surf=
ace of the country in many=20

regions, is almost overspread with the abundance of casts, or redintigrate =
fossils, many of which=20

are apparently specifically anomalous, and some generically so. The correct=
, and only useful=20

mode in which the investigation of our fossils can be conducted, is attende=
d with some difficulty=20

and labour.  The task presumes the knowledge, not only of fossils in all th=
eir different states, from=20

the apparently unchanged specimen, to the fragment or section of a cast uni=
nsulably imbedded in=20

its rocky matrix, but it also requires an adequate acquaintance with recent=
 specimens, or those of=20

which the inhabitants are not yet struck from the list of animated beings, =
in other words those of=20

the present, as well as those of the former world.  Due advantage being tak=
en of the many=20

opportunities which are from time to time offered to us, of obtaining knowl=
edge in this department,=20

will probably be the means of producing a list of American animal reliqui=
=C3=A6, coextensive with that of=20

Europe at the present day. In the present state of the science, however, th=
e correct naturalist will=20

feel it a duty which he owes to his colaborators to proceed with the utmost=
 caution, that he may=20

not add unnecessarily to the already numerous species.   _Genus Alveolites,=
 Lam._  Coral=20

lapideous, covering extraneous bodies, or in a simple mass, formed of conce=
ntric strata; strata=20

composed each of a union of numerous alveoles, which are very short, contig=
uous, reticulate, and=20

generally parallel.   _Species._  _A. glomeratus_, alveoles vertical, subeq=
ual, oval, or obsoletely=20

hexagonal, much shorter than the diameter, parallel; paries simple; strata =
numerous, forming a=20

rounded mass. (_Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences._)  Found often =
on the coast of=20

rms masses of various=20

sizes and figures, generally more or less rounded or lobed, and composed of=
 a great number of=20

concentric layers. The number of these strata seems to be regulated in some=
 degree, by the=20

quantity of surface they have to cover. Thus if the nucleus happens to be a=
 small shell, such as=20

the _Natic=C3=A6_, _Nass=C3=A6_, &c. of our coast, or even the oyster, (_O.=
 virginica_,) clam, (_V.=20

mercenaria_,) &c. the strata are often very numerous; but on the thoracic p=
late of _Limulus=20

polyphemus_, having a considerable space over which to extend themselves, t=
he strata are but=20

few, not more than 2 or 3. I have seen the thoracic plate of this animal so=
 entirely covered by the=20

_Alveolite_, as to have the eyes and stemmata concealed so as to be perfect=
ly blind. When=20

composed of a single layer only, it much resembles a _Flustra_, or a _Cella=
pore_ of which the=20

convex surfaces have been removed by attrition. The animal I have not yet e=

be obtained only by seed annually, or a division of the old roots by cuttin=
gs. The latter is too much=20

trouble for most cultivators in the country, and named kinds are never thou=
ght of, while in the old=20

they used to be; perhaps it is still common for the pansy grower to name hi=
s pets, and reproduce=20

them each year by cuttings or division of the roots.  The seed that brings =
the largest and best=20

flowers generally come from Germany, although some of our own florists save=
 them themselves=20

for several consecutive years. I was a long time before any fixed character=
 was maintained in color=20

in this flower, but now seed from certain kinds will mainly reproduce its l=
ike, hence are often so=20

used for massing kinds of a color. The plant being a native of the cooler a=
nd moister parts of=20

Europe is better adapted to their climate than ours, and hence as our sprin=
g weather is more=20

nearly like their original climate than our other seasons, they luxuriate i=
n it; it is the only season in=20

which the florist finds much of a market for his goods, and even then he re=
ceives some round=20

abuse for selling very large noble flowers that quickly deteriorate after l=
eaving his hands. This,=20

however, is not his fault, the hot weather being one cause, the other that =
the plant refuses to=20

produce large flowers except in its young state.  There are two methods ado=
pted by a florist in the=20

preparation of his stock; one, by sowing the seed in the fall and wintering=
 the young plants in cold=20

frames, or even by means of a slight protection of brush. The other by sowi=
ng the seed on a bench=20

in the green-house in January. If sown in the fall early enough to get well=
 into rough leaf, if they do=20

not flower in the fall, which they usually will do, they are ready to do so=
 at the first peep of spring,=20

as they flower at a comparatively low temperature. If sown in January, they=
 are transplanted once=20

on other benches, from which they are lifted and transferred either to the =
outside borders or to=20

other cold frames as the case may be. It is not best to keep them in a gree=
n-house longer than=20

necessary, say the first of March, as the conditions of a green-house will =
bring about the small=20

flowers similar to the hot weather of the summer.  [Illustration: THE PANSY=
.]  By the different=20

systems the market florist can have his goods always at their best during t=
he selling season, which=20

ranges from the first of March up to the first of June. They are so easily =
grown he can afford to sell=20

cheap, even if his goods are of the very best, and will usually bring about=
 seventy-five cents by the=20

single dozen, down to as low as three dollars by the hundred. Enough sod sh=
ould hang to the=20

roots to keep them fresh, and they will, after planting, go on flowering ju=
st as though they had=20

never been disturbed. Nothing can be done with this plant, at least worthy =
of the name, in the=20

window, hence it should not be attempted. To enjoy the large flowers as lon=
g as possible during=20

summer, if there is any choice of position, give them the coolest and moist=
est place in the garden,=20

not forgetting plenty of watering in dry spells. A rich, loamy soil, inclin=
ed to be porous, will give the=20

best satisfaction, but almost any garden soil will grow them.  EDGAR SANDER=

alveoles alternating with each other throughout the layer in a quincunx man=

the paries is somewhat equal to one half of the conjugate diameter of the a=
lveole, the length of=20

which, or thickness of the layer, is scarcely more considerable; but these =
proportions vary.  The=20

species to which it seems allied, are _madreporacea_ and _incrustans_. The =
former is fossil, and=20

differs in being subramose; the latter forms but a single expansion.   _Gen=

ticulated.   _Species._=20

_F. striata_, more or less turbinate; _paries of the alveoles_ longitudinal=
ly striated within, and=20

fenestrate with minute osculi; _alveoles_ with very numerous sept=C3=A6. (_=
Cabinet Acad. Nat.=20

Sciences; and Peale's Museum--common._)  Found fossil in various parts of t=
he United States, at=20

the falls of the Ohio; Genessee, New-York; Pittsburg and Wilksbarre, Pennsy=
lvania; Missouri, &c.=20

&c. but not yet in the alluvial deposit of New-Jersey.  The tubes are gener=
ally, partially, or entirely=20

filled with silicious matter, sometimes so completely so, as to resemble in=
 miniature, basaltic=20

columns; when the alveoles are free on the surface, these fossils are known=
 by the name of=20

_petrified wasp-nests_, from the resemblance they bear to the nests of thos=
e insects. The silex is=20

usually only infiltrated into the cavities, leaving the substance of the co=
ral in its original calcareous=20

state, but the specimens which are found amongst the rolled pebbles of the =
Delaware River, near=20

Philadelphia, are completely silicified.  The size varies from one fourth o=
f an ounce, to two hundred=20

pounds or more, and the tubes occur of every intermediate diameter, from th=
e fortieth to one fourth=20

of an inch. It is not common to find any two specimens of like form, they a=
re, however, ordinarily=20

more or less turbinate, but are sometimes depressed or compressed, and the =
tubes rectilinear or=20

excurved, and of various lengths. The dilated summit is not so much the eff=
ect of a gradual=20

enlargement of the tubes, as of the frequent and adventitious interposition=
 of young ones, which of=20

course renders the openings of the tubes unequal. The tubes or alveoles, va=
ry in the same coral,=20

being 5 or 6, rarely seven sided, but the hexagonal form is most common; th=
e interior of a tube is=20

divided into a great number of apartments or cells, by approximate transver=
se sept=C3=A6, each of the=20

cells appears to be connected with the corresponding cells of the surroundi=
ng tubes, by lateral=20

orifices in the dividing paries; these orifices are minute, inequidistant, =
orbicular, their margins=20

slightly prominent, and forming from one to three longitudinal series on ea=
ch side of the tube; each=20

row is separated from the adjoining one by an impressed line. By means of t=
hese osculi it seems=20

probable that all the animals inhabiting a common coral, were connected tog=
ether, or had free=20

communication with each other, but whether by means of a common organ as in=
 _Pyrosoma_,=20

_Stephanomia_, &c. or simply by contact as in the aggregating _Salpa_, &c. =
we have no means of=20

determining.  The _striata_ differs from _Madrepora truncata_, Esper. (_F. =
alveolata_, Lam.) in not=20

being "ext=C3=B9s transvers=C3=A8 sulcata." It seems to be allied to _Coral=
lium Gothlandicum_, Am=C5=93n. Acad.=20

v. 1. p. 106, and it is possible it may prove synonymous, or very similar t=
o it, when that species=20

becomes better known; the latter has been taken for Basalt, and M. Lamarck =
when describing it,=20

inquires "Est-ce un polypier?" _Madrepora fascicularis_, of Volck. and Park=
in. in common with _F.=20

striata_ and _F. Gothlandicum_, is distinguished by the transverse septa, a=
 character which=20

induced me to refer the species here described to _Favosite_; they seem the=
refore to be=20



congeneric, as analogy indicates a participation in the character of oscula=
ted paries.  Amongst the=20

great variety exhibited by this species, we have to remark more particularl=
y the following, viz.:  1st.=20

Alveoles perfectly free, that is, destitute of aciculi or lamell=C3=A6, the=
 septa wanting, and sometimes=20

the osculi obsolete.  2d. Alveoles filled almost to the summit with the sep=
ta, and resembling those=20

combs of the bee-hive which are filled with honey and covered over.  3d. Pa=
ries beset with very=20

numerous, interrupted, alternating, transverse lamell=C3=A6, which are dent=
iculated at their tips, and=20

project towards the centre with various degrees of prominence and irregular=
ity.  The first variety=20

corresponds with the generic character, and the third approaches the genus =
_Porites_; yet so=20

unequivocally identical are they, that I have seen them all united in the s=
ame mass, and perforated=20

throughout by the osculi. The identity is further obvious by the perfect gr=
adation which renders=20

them inseparable.  With respect to the transverse septa, I think their pres=
ence may be accounted=20

for by supposing that as the animal elongates its tube in consequence of an=
 increase of growth, or=20

in order to maintain an equal elevation with the adjacent tubes, (rendered =
necessary by the origin=20

of young tubes in the interstices) it gradually vacates the basal portions =
of its tube, and sustains=20

itself at the different elevations, by successively uniting the parietal la=
mell=C3=A6 so as to exclude the=20

vacuity. That this is probable, we may infer from a similar procedure on th=
e part of several species=20

of testaceous mollusca. Thus some Linn=C3=A6an _Serpula_ become camerated, =
and a familiar=20

instance presents itself in the _Triton tritonis_, the animal of which adds=
 successive partitions to=20

the interior of the spire, as that part becomes too strait for the increasi=
ng volume of its body. If the=20

above supposition proves correct, the organs of communication which pass th=
rough the osculi,=20

can hardly be in common, but must rather connect the animals by simple cont=
act only, otherwise=20

these parts would be broken when the animal changes its place by vacating t=
he inferior part of the=20

tube.  The third variety is then the state of that portion of the tube whic=
h is inhabited by the body of=20

the animal, and not yet interrupted by the sept=C3=A6.  From the above obse=
rvations, it is evident that=20

this species, and probably the entire genus _Favosite_ under which I have p=
laced it, will not=20

arrange properly with the _Tubipores_, _Millepores_, &c. but must be transf=
erred to the _Polypiers=20

Lamellif=C3=A8res_ of Lamarck. And if the _Madrepora retepora_ of Solander =
and Ellis, is a true=20

_Porites_, as M. Lamarck supposes it to be from the appearance of its tubes=
, I should conclude=20

this genus to be very proximately allied to _Favosites_, by that species an=
d the _F. striata_ having=20

in common the remarkable character of fenestrated paries. But to this chara=
cter I should conceive=20

a generic importance ought to be attached, as indicating a differential org=
anization of the artificers.=20

I have no doubt that on close inspection of a perfect specimen, the same ch=
aracter will be found to=20

exist in _F. Gothlandicum_, and possibly also in _F. truncata_, if not in t=
he latter only, it may be=20

proper to separate the genus and to withdraw from _Porites_ the foremention=
ed species, retaining=20

to _striata_ as specifically essential, the second member of the differenti=
al description.  (_To be=20

he most popular the ocean, had=20

imbibed large quantities of salt water, which were afterward deposited upon=
 the land. In most=20

cases these depositions proved fatal to the plants and vegetables which rec=
eived them. So=20

extensive were the effects of this singular storm, that they were felt in t=
he vicinity of London, at a=20

distance of about seventy miles from the ocean, and in all the intermediate=
 country. In most=20

instances, the leaves of the plants, which suffered from it, appeared as if=
 they had been scorched,=20

and in some places even the tops of the branches mortified. A storm of the =
same kind took place=20

in England, in February, 1804; and the memoir states, that Sir Joseph Banks=
 had noticed another=20

some years before in Lincolnshire.[55]  A storm attended with similar effec=
ts occurred in this=20

country in 1815, and vented its fury upon the eastern states. It commenced =
on the 23d of=20

September, between eight and nine o'clock, A. M. with the wind from the eas=
t. In about two hours=20

the wind shifted to southeast, and blew a perfect hurricane. The extended d=
evastation which=20

ensued, is still in the recollection of every person. The tides rose from n=
ine to twelve feet higher=20

than ordinary, and in many of the principal cities and towns along the coas=
t of New England,=20

churches, houses, bridges, wharves, and in some instances valuable citizens=
, were buried in one=20

common ruin. In less than three hours the gale abated, and before sunset th=
ere was a perfect=20

calm. Such were the more striking features of this tremendous gale--but oth=
er effects were=20

observed more peculiarly interesting to the philosopher. At New-London, Sal=
em, and other places,=20

both on the coast, and several miles in the interior, the air was found to =
be loaded with salt; and=20

the leaves of many trees appeared, a few hours after the storm, as if they =
had been scorched.=20

Besides this effect upon vegetables, there were additional evidences of the=
 saline quality of the=20

wind. At Salem and some other places an incrustation of salt was perceived =
on the windows, and=20

the fruit in several gardens had a perceptible taste of salt on their surfa=
ce. At New-London it was=20

remarked that the air in the eddies was extremely hot and suffocating.  Oth=
er facts of a similar=20

nature might be collected, but these it is presumed are sufficient to chara=
cterize the state of the=20

atmosphere during that storm.  Several interesting inquiries arise from the=
 consideration of the=20

foregoing facts.  1. In what way does the salt exist in the atmosphere in t=
hese storms? On this=20

point there are two different opinions. The most prevalent is, that it is m=
erely the spray of the sea=20

driven onward by the force of the wind. This opinion has received the sanct=
ion of Sir Joseph=20



Banks,[56] and also of Sir Humphry Davy, if we may judge from an incidental=
 expression in his=20

Agricultural Chemistry.[57] Another opinion[58] is, that muriate of soda is=
 continually rising into the=20

atmosphere from the surface of the ocean, and that the air, in all maritime=
 situations, is thus=20

constantly more or less impregnated with salt. The most striking fact in su=
pport of this doctrine, (so=20

opposite to the commonly received views on the subject of the evaporation o=
f sea water) is the=20

actual existence of muriate of soda in the rain and snow which fall in the =
vicinity of the ocean.[59]=20

The experiments of Vogel and Bouillon Lagrange, on the distillation of sea =
water, are also in=20

favour of the position, that salt may be carried into the air in the ordina=
ry process of evaporation.=20

On distilling salt water they found a considerable quantity of muriate of s=
oda in the receiver.[60]=20

Admitting the correctness of these experiments, still it is not easy to con=
ceive, how they will=20

account satisfactorily for the _large_ quantities of salt found in the air =
during the storms under=20

consideration.  Whichever of these solutions may be adopted, it is unquesti=
onably a fact that salt=20

does, in some way or other, exist in the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of=
 the sea.  2. The next=20

object of inquiry is, the influence which this saline air has upon vegetabl=
e life. Independently of the=20

facts already stated, there are many others which prove its deleterious age=
ncy upon the vegetable=20

creation. Dr. Mitchill informs me, that in some parts of the south side of =
Long-Island fruit trees do=20

not thrive well, except at a distance of thirty miles from the sea, and eve=
n the sturdy oak does not=20

extend its branches towards the ocean.[61] If I am correctly informed, it w=
as with great difficulty,=20

that the trees on our Battery were made to accommodate themselves to a situ=
ation so near the=20

salt water. It is also well known, that when plants are taken to sea, they =
speedily perish, if exposed=20

but a short time to a wind, which is sufficiently strong to turn over the t=
ops of the waves into _white=20

caps_, as they are called by the sailors.  In order to ascertain positively=
, whether these effects=20

were to be attributed to the operation of salt, I made a solution of muriat=
e of soda in common rain=20

water; with this I watered for a couple of days the leaves of different pla=
nts. In a short time they=20

began to dry up, and in a few days were completely dead.  It appears from V=
olney, that the=20

Egyptian air is strongly charged with salts. The evidences of it are to be =
found even at Cairo.[62] It=20

is this property of the air, which this philosophical traveller considers, =
as one of the causes of the=20

rapid vegetation in that country. He mentions, however, that _exotic_ plant=
s will not thrive there. It=20

is found necessary to renew the seeds of them every year. May not this be o=
ccasioned by the=20

saline quality of the air? The _native_ plants are doubtless accustomed to =
its action, and do not so=20

sensibly feel its injurious effects. And if the Egyptian air is so very pen=
etrating from this very=20

cause, as to produce ophthalmia, may we not rationally conclude, that its i=
nfluence must be=20

equally injurious to plants not accustomed to it.  Another illustration of =
the influence of salt on=20

vegetation is to be found in the _Dead Sea_, or _Lake Asphaltites_. "In Lak=
e Asphaltites," says=20

Volney, "there is neither animal nor vegetable life. No verdure is to be se=
en on its banks, nor fish=20

to be found within its waters; but it is not true, that its exhalations are=
 pestiferous, so as to destroy=20

birds flying over it. It is not uncommon to see swallows skimming its surfa=
ce, and dipping for the=20

water necessary to build their nests. The _true_ cause which deprives it of=
 vegetables and animals=20

is the extreme saltness of the water, which is vastly stronger than that of=
 the sea. The soil around=20

it, equally impregnated with this salt, produces no plants, and the _air_ i=
tself, which becomes=20

loaded with it from evaporation, and which receives also the sulphureous an=
d bituminous vapours,=20

cannot be favourable to vegetation; hence the deadly aspect which reigns ar=
ound this lake."[63]=20



3. In what way does the salt operate in producing its deleterious effects o=
n the leaves of=20

vegetables? It is by no means easy to answer this question. It cannot be by=
 shutting up the pores=20

of the leaf, and thus obstructing its perspiration. It is well known that w=
hen the surfaces of leaves=20

are covered with oil, they will soon die.[64] But salt water is certainly n=
ot sufficiently viscid to act in=20

a similar way.  Nor can it be satisfactorily attributed to the difference o=
f structure between maritime=20

and land plants. There is some difference indeed between many of these, mar=
itime plants being=20

generally covered by a pubescence, of which most land plants are destitute.=
 It is idle however to=20

suppose that the object of this covering is to protect maritime plants from=
 the action of the salt air,=20

as there are many of them which do not possess it. Besides, is it not ratio=
nal to conclude, from the=20

large quantities of soda which are always found in sea plants, that this sa=
line atmosphere is rather=20

propitious than otherwise to their growth, and that it only proves injuriou=
s to plants accustomed to=20

the unadulterated air of the land.  Again, I do not think that it can be ex=
plained by supposing, that=20

the salt is absorbed into the plant, and thus acts as a poisonous substance=
. We know, that in land=20

plants which are cultivated in the neighbourhood of the sea, salt is absorb=
ed through their=20

roots.[65] It must of course circulate with the juices through the whole pl=
ant; and yet in these cases=20

the leaves are not destroyed by it.  The most plausible method of explainin=
g it appears to be this:=20

that the salt, by its irritating or corrosive power, destroys the small ves=
sels in the leaf which are=20

necessary for the circulation going on in it during health.  Dr. Darwin has=
 ingeniously shown the=20

analogy between the functions of the leaves of plants, and the lungs of ani=
mals. If this be=20

admitted, it will not be difficult to account for the action of salt upon l=
eaves. This substance, when=20

taken into the stomach, proves not merely innocuous, but wholesome; but whe=
n accidentally=20

introduced into the lungs, irritation, inflammation, and death are the cons=
equences. So with plants-

-when admitted into them in combination with their juices, it may be harmle=
ss; but when applied to=20

the lungs or leaves, death ensues.  4. I shall devote the remainder of this=
 paper to a few concise=20

observations on the effects of salt, and a saline atmosphere, upon _animal_=
 life.  Upon the more=20

imperfect animals, such as slugs, worms, toads,=20

oyance of farmers. If=20

the bill passes the Senate, and there appears no valid reason why it shall =

this species of robbery now so prevalent.         *       *       *       *=
       *  The only general advices we=20

have regarding winter wheat come through the extensive grain commission hou=
se of W. T. Baker=20

& Co., Chicago. They have private reports which indicate that the crop main=
tains a very high=20

average, and, with the exception of a few it is well known that salt proves=
 speedily destructive of=20

life. It is not my intention to attempt an explanation of this singular fac=
t. But it is remarkable that it=20

should not have been turned to better account in the treatment of those wor=
ms, which infest the=20

human body. Although used for that purpose by the common people in Ireland =
as well as in this=20

country, I believe it has not, until very lately, claimed the attention of =
the profession, as an=20

anthelmintick. A late English journal[66] contains a notice of some cases w=
hich satisfactorily prove=20

its efficacy, when administered with this intention. This fact, in addition=
 to numerous others,=20

strikingly illustrates the advantages which the healing art might derive fr=
om a careful observation=20

of the phenomena daily developed by the collateral sciences.  In cases of _=
h=C3=A6moptysis_ and=20

_h=C3=A6matemesis_, common salt has been used with decided success. The pub=
lic is indebted to Dr.=20

Rush, for the introduction of this remedy into general practice.  Dr. Hosac=
k informs me, that he has=20

found sea air extremely salutary in _remittent fever_, _cholera infantum_, =
and _dyspepsia_.=20

Among the deleterious effects caused by a _saline atmosphere_, may be menti=
oned the=20

_ophthalmia_ of Egypt. This disease is so common there, "that out of a hund=
red persons," says=20

Volney, "I have met while walking the streets of Cairo, twenty have been qu=
ite blind, ten wanting=20

an eye, and twenty others have had their eyes red, purulent, or blemished."=
[67] Throughout the=20

Delta, and at Cairo, this complaint is more prevalent than in any other par=
t of Egypt. In Syria it is=20

also common, although less so than in Egypt, but it is only met with on the=
 _sea-coast_. The=20

reasoning of Volney on this subject, is decisive of the position, that the =
prevalence of this=20

complaint, in these regions, is owing to their proximity to the ocean. In c=
onfirmation, he states that=20

he has himself experienced the=20


_
Kentucky, and Tennessee, is doing as well as could be expected at this seas=
on of the year. In=20

Kentucky and Tennessee the ground is quite bare of snow, but north of the O=
hio river, from=20

Kansas to Ohio, the wheat, as a general thing, is well covered. The crop, h=
owever, was generally=20

sown late, and in many quarters fears are entertained of the final outcome.=
         *       *       *       *=20

*  The Nebraska State Farmers' Alliance held a meeting at Kearney on Wednes=
day of last week. A=20

platform was adopted declaring in favor of national legislation to regulate=
 railway traffic,=20

demanding the abolition of national banks and the substitution of Governmen=
t currency,=20

demanding a tariff for revenue only, expressing sympathy with labor, organ =
of vision.[68]  In those=20

cases of _scurvy_ which occur in long voyages, the saline nature of the atm=
osphere co-operates=20

very powerfully with salt provisions and bad water, in producing that gener=
al vitiation of the system=20

which characterizes this disorder.  Of all diseases, however, those of the =
lungs appear to be most=20

affected by a saline air. I have known a lady of this city who had been aff=
licted for many years with=20

_asthma_, to be essentially benefited by a voyage across the Atlantic. Anot=
her case has fallen=20

under my observation, of a lady troubled with asthma, being much relieved b=
y removing from the=20

interior to this city. What proves beyond a doubt that her relief is owing =
to the air she breathes, is,=20

that whenever she takes=20
