are considered by the Arabs as impregnable. The walls are of solid mud and =
sun-baked bricks,=20

carefully loopholed for musketry, while a deep fosse, by which it is surrou=
nded, is a safeguard=20

against a sudden surprise.  These engineering precautions were rendered nec=
essary by the=20

ferocity of the Arabs, who fought the Egyptians with great determination fo=
r some years before=20

they were finally subdued. Although the weapons of all the Arab tribes are =
the simple sword and=20

lance, they defended their country against the regular troops of Egypt unti=
l they were completely=20

defeated by a scarcity of water, against which there could be no resistance=
. The Egyptians turned=20

the course of the river Gash, and entirely shut off the supply from one por=
tion of the country, while=20

they inundated another. This was effected by an immense dam, formed of the =
stems of the dome=20

palms, as a double row of piles, while the interior was rendered water-tigh=
t by a lining of matting=20

filled up with sand.  Cassala was built about twenty years before I visited=
 the country, after Taka=20

had been conquered and annexed to Egypt. The general annexation of the Soud=
an and the=20

submission of the numerous Arab tribes to the Viceroy have been the first s=
teps necessary to the=20

improvement of the country. Although the Egyptians are hard masters, and do=
 not trouble=20

themselves about the future well-being of the conquered races, it must be r=
emembered that, prior=20

to the annexation, all the tribes were at war among themselves. There was n=
either government nor=20

law; thus the whole country was closed to Europeans. At present, there is n=
o more danger in=20

travelling in Upper Egypt than in crossing Hyde Park after dark, provided t=
he traveller be just and=20

courteous. At the time of my visit to Cassala in 1861, the Arab tribes were=
 separately governed by=20

their own chiefs or sheiks, who were responsible to the Egyptian authoritie=
s for the taxes due from=20

their people: since that period, the entire tribes of all denominations hav=
e been placed under the=20

authority of that grand old Arab patriarch Achmet Abou Sinn, to be hereafte=
r mentioned. The Sheik=20

Moosa, of the Hadendowa tribe, was in prison during our stay in that countr=
y, for some breach of=20

discipline in his dealings with the Egyptian Government. The iron hand of d=
espotism has produced=20

a marvellous change among the Arabs, who are rendered utterly powerless by =
the system of=20

government adopted by the Egyptians; unfortunately, this harsh system has t=
he effect of=20

paralysing all industry.  The principal object of Turks and Egyptians in an=
nexation, is to increase=20

their power of taxation by gaining an additional number of subjects. Thus, =
although many=20

advantages have accrued to the Arab provinces of Nubia through Egyptian rul=
e, there exists an=20

amount of mistrust between the governed and the governing. Not only are the=
 camels, cattle, and=20

sheep subjected to a tax, but every attempt at cultivation is thwarted by t=
he authorities, who=20

impose a fine or tax upon the superficia1 area of the cultivated land. Thus=
, no one will cultivate=20

more than is absolutely necessary, as he dreads the difficulties that the b=
road acres of waving=20

crops would entail upon his family. The bona fide tax is a bagatelle to the=
 amounts squeezed from=20

him by the olive, and the vine. Sometimes the land was uncultivated, and wa=
s principally covered=20

with myrtles, of large size, and oleanders, and arbutus, and thorny brooms.=
 Here game abounded,=20

while from the mountain-forests the wolf sometimes descended, and spoiled a=
nd scared the=20

islanders.  On the sea-shore, yet not too near the wave, and on a sylvan de=
clivity, was along,=20

pavilion-looking building, painted in white and arabesque. It was backed by=
 the forest, which had a=20

park-like character from its partial clearance, and which, after a convenie=
nt slip of even land,=20

ascended the steeper country and took the form of wooded hills, backed in d=
ue time by still sylvan=20

yet loftier elevations, and sometimes a glittering peak.  =E2=80=9CWelcome,=
 my friend!=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus to=20



Lothair. =E2=80=9CWelcome to an Aryan clime, an Aryan landscape, and an Ary=
an race! It will do you good=20

after your Semitic hallucinations.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 73 Mr. Phoebus pu=
rsued a life in his island partly=20

feudal, partly Oriental, partly Venetian, and partly idiosyncratic. He had =
a grand studio, where he=20

could always find interesting occupation in drawing every fine face and for=
m in his dominions.=20

Then he hunted, and that was a remarkable scene. The ladies, looking like D=
iana or her nymphs,=20

were mounted on cream-colored Anatolian chargers, with golden bells; while =
Mr. Phoebus himself,=20

in green velvet and seven-leagued boots, sounded a wondrous twisted horn, r=
ife with all the=20

inspiring or directing notes of musical and learned venerie. His neighbors =
of condition came=20

mounted, but the field was by no means confined to cavaliers. A vast crowd =
of men, in small caps=20

and jackets and huge white breeches, and armed with all the weapons of Pali=
kari, handjars and=20

ataghans and silver-sheathed muskets of uncommon length and almost as old a=
s the battle of=20

Lepanto, always rallied round his standard. The equestrians caracoled about=
 the park, and the=20

horns sounded, and the hounds bayed, and the men shouted, till the deer had=
 all scudded away.=20

Then, by degrees, the hunters entered the forest, and the notes of venerie =
became more faint and=20

the shouts more distant. Then, for two or three hours, all was silent, save=
 the sound of an=20

occasional shot or the note of a stray hound, until the human stragglers be=
gan to reappear=20

emerging from the forest, and in due time the great body of the hunt, and a=
 gilded cart drawn by=20

mules and carrying the prostrate forms of fallow-deer and roebuck. None of =
the ceremonies of the=20

chase were omitted, and the crowd dispersed, refreshed by Samian wine, whic=
h Mr. Phoebus was=20

teaching them to make without resin, and which they quaffed with shrugging =
shoulders.  =E2=80=9CWe must=20

have a wolf-hunt for you,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne to Lothair. =E2=80=9CYou=
 like excitement, I believe?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I am=20

rather inclined for repose at present, and I came here with the hope of obt=
aining it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, we are=20

never idle here; in fact, that would be impossible with Gaston. He has esta=
blished here an=20

academy of the fine arts, and also revived the gymnasia; and my sister and =
myself have=20

schools=E2=80=94only music and dancing; Gaston does not approve of letters.=
 The poor people have, of=20

course, their primary schools, with their priests, and Gaston does not inte=
rfere with them, but he=20

regrets their=20


_
soldiery, who are the agents employed by the sheik; these must have their s=
hare of the plunder, in=20

excess of the amount to be delivered to their employer; he, also, must have=
 his plunder before he=20

parts with the bags of dollars to the governor of the province. Thus the un=
fortunate cultivator is=20

ground down; should he refuse to pay the necessary "baksheesh" or present t=
o the tax-collectors,=20

some false charge is trumped up against him, and he is thrown into prison. =
As a green field is an=20

attraction to a flight of locusts in their desolating voyage, so is a luxur=
iant farm in the Soudan a=20

point for the tax-collectors of Upper Egypt. I have frequently ridden sever=
al days' journey through a=20

succession of empty villages, deserted by the inhabitants upon the report o=
f the soldiers'=20

approach; the women and children, goats and reading and writing as very inj=
urious to education.=E2=80=9D=20

Sometimes reposing on divans, the sisters received the chief persons of the=
 isle, and regaled=20

them with fruits and sweetmeats, and coffee and sherbets, while Gaston=E2=
=80=99s chibouques and=20

tobacco of Salonica were a proverb. These meetings always ended with dance =
and song, replete,=20

according to Mr. Phoebus, with studies of Aryan life.  =E2=80=9CI believe t=
hese islanders to be an unmixed=20

race,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CThe same form and visage prevails=
 throughout; and very little changed=20

in any thing=E2=80=94even in their religion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CUnchanged i=
n their religion!=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with some=20

astonishment.  =E2=80=9CYes; you will find it so. Their existence is easy; =
their wants are not great, and their=20

means of subsistence plentiful. They pass much of their life in what is cal=
led amusement=E2=80=94and=20

what is it?=20


_
the wilderness for refuge, while their crops of corn have been left standin=
g for the plunderers, who=20

would be too idle to reap and thrash the grain.  Notwithstanding the misrul=
e that fetters the steps=20

of improvement, Nature has bestowed such great capabilities of production i=
n the fertile soil of this=20

country, that the yield of a small surface is more than sufficient for the =
requirements of the=20

population, and actual poverty is unknown. The average price of dhurra is f=
ifteen piastres per=20

"rachel," or about 3s. 2d. for 500 lbs. upon the spot where it is grown. Th=
e dhurra (Sorghum=20

andropogon) is the grain most commonly used throughout the Soudan; there ar=
e great varieties of=20

this plant, of which the most common are the white and the red. The land is=
 not only favoured by=20

Nature by its fertility, but the intense heat of the summer is the labourer=
's great assistant. As=20

before described, all vegetation entirely disappears in the glaring Sun, or=
 becomes so dry that it is=20

swept off by fire; thus the soil is perfectly clean and fit for immediate c=
ultivation upon the arrival of=20

the rains. The tool generally used is similar to the Dutch hoe. With this s=
imple implement the=20

surface is scratched to the depth of about two inches, and the seeds of the=
 dhurra are dibbled in=20

about three feet apart, in rows from four to five feet in width. Two seeds =
are dropped into each=20

hole. A few days after the first shower they rise above the ground, and whe=
n about six inches=20

pleasure; they go in procession to a fountain or a grove. They dance and ea=
t fruit, and they return=20

home singing songs. They have, in fact, been performing unconsciously the r=
eligious ceremonies=20

of their ancestors, and which they pursue, and will forever, though they ma=
y have forgotten the=20

name of the dryad or the nymph who presides over their waters.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CI should think their priests=20

would guard them from these errors,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThe Gr=
eek priests, particularly in these Asian=20

islands, are good sort of people,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CThey =
marry and have generally large=20

families, often very beautiful. They have no sacerdotal feelings, for they =
never can have any=20

preferment; all the high posts in the Greek Church being reserved for the m=
onks, who study what=20

is called theology. The Greek parish priest is not at all Semitic; there is=
 nothing to counteract his=20

Aryan tendencies. I have already raised the statue of a nymph at one of the=
ir favorite springs and=20

places of pleasant pilgrimage, and I have a statue now in the island, still=
 in its case, which I=20

contemplate installing in a famous grove of laurel not far off and very muc=
h resorted to.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd=20

what then?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, I have a conviction t=
hat among the great races the old creeds=20

will come back,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cand it will be acknowle=
dged that true religion is the worship of=20

the beautiful. For the beautiful cannot be attained without virtue, if virt=
ue consists, as I believe, in=20

the=20


_
day to weed the dhurra fields. Sown in July, it is harvested in February an=
d March. Eight months=20

are thus required for the cultivation of this cereal in the intense heat of=
 Nubia. For the first three=20

months the growth is extremely rapid, and the stem attains a height of six =
or seven feet. control of=20

the passions, in the sentiment of repose, and the avoidance in all things o=
f excess.=E2=80=9D  One night=20

Lothair was walking home with the sisters from a village festival where the=
y had been much=20

amused.  =E2=80=9CYou have had a great many adventures since we first met?=
