sipping tea with me at an embassy in the dim lit gorgeousness of a mediaeval room, "are of two 

kinds: Those who are being crucified by the war, and those who are abusing the new found 

liberties which war has brought them!"  "Liberties?" asked her colloquitor; not Henry. He had no 

patience with these theoretical excursions into speculative realms. "Liberties rather than 

privileges?"  "Yes, liberties. Privileges are temporary," purred the lady at the embassy. "They 

come and go, but the whole trouble with this new situation is that it is permanent. That also is part 

of the crucifixion of those who suffer under it. These women never again can return to the lives 

they have left, to the sheltering positions from which the awful needs of this war have driven them. 

The cultivated European woman, who I think on the whole was the highest product of our 

civilization, has gone. She has fallen to the American level."  "And the continental mistress 

system," prodded her American interviewer, ironically, "will it, too, disappear with the departed 

superiority of continental womanhood?"  "Yes, the mistress system too--if you want to call it a 

system--and I suppose it is an institution--it too will become degraded and Americanized." 

"Americanized?" the middle western eyebrows went up, and possibly the middle western voice 

flinched a little. But the wise dowager from Bridgeport, Connecticut, living in Paris on New York 

Central bonds, continued bitterly: "Yes, Americanized and vulgarized. The continental mistress 

system is not the nasty arrangement that you middle class Americans think it is. Of course there 

are European men who acquire one woman after another, live with her a few months or a few 

years and forget her. Such men are impossible."  She waved away the whole lady-chasing tribe 

with a contemptuous hand.  "But the mistress system as we know it in Europe is the by-product of 

a leisure class. Men and women marry for business reasons. The women have their children to 

love, the man finds his mistress, and clings to her for a lifetime. He cannot afford to marry her--

even if he could be divorced; for he would have to work to support her, and be declassed. But he 

can support her on his wife's money and a beautiful life-long friendship is thus cherished. It will 

disappear when men have to work, and when women may go into the world to work without losing 

their social positions. And this new order, this making the world safe for democracy, as you call it, 

will rob civilization of its most perfect flower--the cultivated woman who has developed under the 

shelter of our economic system. I might as well shock your bourgeois morals now as later. So 

listen to this. Here is one of the ways the women of Europe are suffering. I talked to a French 

mother this morning. Her income is gone--part of it taxed away, and the rest of it wiped away by 

the Germans in Northern France. Her son has only a second lieutenant's income. In this chaos 

she can find no suitable wife for him. One who is rich today, tomorrow may be poor, so the dear 

fellow may not marry. And he is looking for a mistress, and his mother fears he will pick up a fool; 

for only a fool would take him on a lieutenant's salary. And the weeping mother told me she would 

almost as soon that her son should have no mistress as to have a fool! For a man's mistress does 

make such a difference in his life! My friend is almost willing to let him marry some bright poor girl 

and go to work! The world never will know the suffering the women of Europe are enduring in this 

war!"  Now we may switch off that record with the snort of woe which Henry gave when he heard 

it. He was trying to tell a Duchess about prohibition in Kansas, who had never heard of either 

Kansas or prohibition and who was clearly scandalized at what she heard of both. But Henry's 

other ear was open to what the embassy ornament was saying to me. On the other side of this 

record of the swan song of the lady of the embassy is this record. It is a man's voice. The man has 



risen from an American farm, hustled his way into a place where as manager of the London 

factory of an American concern, he works several hundred employees.  "Say, let me tell you 

something--never again! Never again for mine do the men come back into our shop. We may let a 

dozen or so of 'em back to handle the big machines. But the next size, which we thought that only 

men could handle--never again. And when they come back these men will have to work under 

women foremen. We thought when the war took our men bosses away that we should have to 

close the shop. But say--never again, I tell you. And let me give you a pointer. You wouldn't know 

them girls. When the war broke out they were getting ten shillings--about $2.50 a week, the best of 

'em, and they were mean and slovenly and kind of skinny and dirty, and every once in awhile one 

would drop out, and the other girls had a great joke about her--you know. And they would soak the 

shop whenever they got a chance! The boss had to keep right after 'em, or they'd soldier on the 

job or break a machine, or slight the product, and they'd lie--why, man, the whole works would 

stand up and lie for each other against the shop. It took five men to boss them where we have one 

woman doing it now. And say, it ain't the woman boss that's done it. We pay 'em more. Them 

same girls is getting ten and twelve and fifteen bucks a week now--Lawsee, man--you ought to 

see 'em! Dressed up to kill; fat, cheerful, wide-awake! Goddlemighty, man, you wouldn't know 'em 

for that same measly bunch of grouches we had three years ago. And they work for the shop now, 

and not against it. They're different girls. I wouldn't-a believed ten dollars a week would-a turned 

the trick; but it's sure done it."  "Perhaps," suggested his acquaintance, "the girls are cheerful and 

competent because they aren't afraid of poverty. Maybe they are motived by hope of getting on in 

the world and not motived by the terror of slipping down. Does that not make them stand by the 

shop instead of working against it? Isn't it a developed middle class feeling that accepts the shop 

as 'their kind of people' now?"  "Search me, Cap--I give it up. I just only know what I know and see 

what I see. And never again--you hear me, man--never again does our shop go back to men. The 

ten or twelve dollar skirt has made a hit with me! Have a cigarette?"  The net gain of women in this 

war, all over the world is, of course, a gain in fellowship.  But after all fellowship will be futile if it 

does not bear fruit. And the first fruit of the fellowship between men and women in Europe surely 

will be a wider and deeper influence of women upon the destinies of the European world. And who 

can doubt who knows woman, that her influence will be thrown first and heaviest toward a just and 

lasting peace.  Often while we were in London, during the last days of our stay, when the meaning 

of the war gradually was forming in our minds we talked of these things. There are two Henrys--

one, the owner of a ten-story building in Wichita, the editor of a powerful and profitable newspaper; 

the other a protagonist, a sentimental idealist. To me this was his greatest charm--this infinite 

variety of Henrys that was forever turning up in our discourse. The owner of the Beacon building 

and the publisher of the newspaper had small use for my theories about the importance of the rise 

of woman into fellowship with men in the new democratization of the Manipiare into the great Rio 

Ventuari. I trace this road with precision not only because it was that by which the traffic of native 

slaves was carried on, but also to call the attention of those, who at some future day may rule the 

destiny of Guiana, to the high importance of this labyrinth of rivers.  It is by the four largest 

tributary streams, which the majestic river of the Orinoco receives on the right (the Carony, the 

Caura, the Padamo, and the Ventuari), that European civilization will one day penetrate into this 

region of forests and mountains, which has a surface of ten thousand six hundred square leagues, 



and which is bounded by the Orinoco on the north, the west, and the south. The Capuchins of 

Catalonia and the Observantins of Andalusia and Valencia, have already made settlements in the 

valleys of the Carony and the Caura. The tributary streams of the Lower Orinoco, being the 

nearest to the coast and to the cultivated region of Venezuela, were naturally the first to receive 

missionaries, and with them some germs of social life. Corresponding to the Carony and the 

Caura, which flow toward the north, are two great tributary streams of the Upper Orinoco, that 

send their waters toward the south; these are the Padamo and the Ventuari. No village has 

hitherto risen on their banks, though they offer advantages for agriculture and pasturage, which 

would be sought in vain in the valley of the immense river to which they are tributary. In the centre 

of these wild countries, where there will long be no other road than the rivers, every project of 

civilization should be founded on an intimate knowledge of the hydraulic features of the country, 

and the relative importance of the tributary streams.  In the morning of the 26th of May we left the 

little village of Santa Barbara, where we found several Indians of Esmeralda, who had come 

reluctantly, by order of the missionary, to construct for him a house of two stories. During the 

whole day we enjoyed the view of the fine mountains of Sipapo, which rise at a distance of more 

than eighteen leagues in the direction of north-north-west. The vegetation of the banks of the 

Orinoco is singularly varied in this part of the country; the aborescent ferns* descend from the 

mountains, and mingle with the palm-trees of the plain. (* The geographical distribution of these 

plants is extremely singular. Scarcely any are found on the eastern coast of Brazil. See the 

interesting work of Prince Maximilian of Neuwied, Reise nach Brasilien volume 1 page 274.) We 

rested that night on the island of Minisi; and, after having passed the mouths of the little rivers 

Quejanuma, Ubua, and Masao, we arrived, on the 27th of May, at San Fernando de Atabapo. We 

lodged in the same house which we had occupied a month previously, when going up the Rio 

Negro. We then directed our course towards the south, by the Atabapo and the Temi; we were 

now returning from the west, having made a long circuit by the Cassiquiare and the Upper 

Orinoco.  We remained only one day at San Fernando de Atabapo, although that village, adorned 

as it was by the pirijao palm-tree, with fruit like peaches, appeared to us a delicious abode. Tame 

pauxis* (* Not the ourax of Cuvier, Crax pauxi Linn., but the Crax alector.) surrounded the Indian 

huts; in one of which we saw a very rare monkey, which inhabits the banks of the Guaviare. This 

monkey is the caparro, which I have made known in my Observations on Zoology and 

comparative Anatomy; it forms, as Geoffroy believes, a new genus (Lagothrix) between the ateles 

and the alouates. The hair of this monkey is grey, like that of the marten, and extremely soft to the 

touch. The caparro is distinguished by a round head, and a mild and agreeable expression of 

countenance. I believe the missionary Gili is the only author who has made mention before me of 

this curious animal, around which zoologists begin to group other monkeys of Brazil. Having 

quitted San Fernando on the 27th of May, we arrived, by help of the rapid current of the Orinoco, 

in seven hours, at the mouth of the Rio Mataveni. We passed the night in the open air, under the 

granitic rock El Castillito, which rises in the middle of the river, and the form of which reminded us 

of the ruin called the Mouse-tower (Mausethurm), on the Rhine, opposite Bingen. Here, as on the 

banks of the Atabapo, we were struck by the sight of a small species of drosera, having exactly 

the appearance of the drosera of Europe.  The Orinoco had sensibly swelled during the night; and 

the current, strongly accelerated, bore us, in ten hours, from the mouth of the Mataveni to the 



Upper Great Cataract, that of Maypures, or Quituna. The distance which we passed over was 

thirteen leagues. We recalled to mind, with much satisfaction, the scenes where we had reposed 

in going up the river. We again found the Indians who had accompanied us in our herborizations; 

and we visited anew the fine spring that issues from a rock of stratified granite behind the house of 

the missionary: its temperature was not changed more than 0.3 degrees. From the mouth of the 

Atabapo as far as that of the Apure we seemed to be travelling as through a country which we had 

long inhabited. We were reduced to the same abstinence; we were stung by the same mosquitos; 

but the certainty of reaching in a few weeks the term of our physical sufferings kept up our spirits. 

The passage of the canoe through the Great Cataract obliged us to stop two days at Maypures. 

Father Bernardo Zea, missionary at the Raudales, who had accompanied us to the Rio Negro, 

though ill, insisted on conducting us with his Indians as far as Atures. One of these Indians, 

Zerepe, the interpreter, who had been so unmercifully punished at the beach of Pararuma, rivetted 

our attention by his appearance of deep sorrow. We learned that his grief was caused by the loss 

of a young girl to whom he was engaged, and that he had lost her in consequence of false 

intelligence which had been spread respecting the direction of our journey. Zerepe, who was a 

native of Maypures, had been brought up in the woods by his parents, who were of the tribe of the 

Macos. He had brought with him to the mission a girl of twelve years of age, whom he intended to 

marry at our return from the Cataracts. The Indian girl was little pleased with the life of the 

missions, and she was told that the whites would go to the country of the Portuguese (Brazil), and 

would take Zerepe with them. Disappointed in her hopes, she seized a boat, and with another girl 

of her own age, crossed the Great Cataract, and fled al monte. The recital of this courageous 

adventure was the great news of the place. The affliction of Zerepe, however, was not of long 

duration. Born among the Christians, having travelled as far as the foot of the Rio Negro, 

understanding Spanish and the language of the Macos, he thought himself superior to the people 

of his tribe, and he no doubt soon forgot his forest love.  On the 31st of May we passed the rapids 

of Guahibos and Garcita. The islands which rise in the middle of the waters of the river were 

overspread with the purest verdure. The rains of winter had unfolded the spathes of the vadgiai 

palm-tree, the leaves of which rise straight toward the sky. The eye is never wearied of the view of 

those scenes, where the trees and rocks give the landscape that grand and severe character 

which we admire in the background of the pictures of Salvator Rosa. We landed before 


_
the democratization of the world in the war. To him the war meant adjustment of boundaries, 

economic advantages, and realignments of political and commercial influence on the map of the 

world. But to the other Henry, to the crusader whom I had seen many times setting out on the 

quest for the grail in politics, throwing away his political fortunes for a cause and a creed as lightly 

as a man would toss aside a cigar stub, the war began to mean something more than its military 

expression.  And one night as we sat in our room waiting for dinner a letter came up from the 

Eager Soul, with some trinkets she had sent over to us by messenger to take to her mother in 

Denver. After telling us the news of the hospital, and of Auntie and of the wound in the Young 

Doctor's hand, she wrote:  "O how I hate war--hate it--hate it! And this war of all wars, I hate it 

worst. It is so ruthless, so inexorably cruel; so utterly meaningless, viewed at close range. 

Yesterday they brought me into Northern France, and I spent the twilight last night looking over the 

ruins of the local church. It is the most important small church in Northern France and contains 

one of the earliest ribbed vaults in France, they say. It was built about 1100, and now the thing is 

smashed. It is what our artillerymen call a one-shot church. O the waste of it--churches, men, 

homes, creeds! How many one-shot creeds have perished in this hell-fire! Still out of the old I 

suppose the new will come. But I have talked to women, to peasant Orinoco, at the Puerto de la 

Expedicion, in order to visit the cavern of Ataruipe, which is the place of sepulchre of a whole 

nation destroyed. I shall attempt to describe this cavern, so celebrated among the natives.  We 

climbed with difficulty, and not without some danger, a steep rock of granite, entirely bare. It would 

have been almost impossible to fix the foot on its smooth and sloping surface, if large crystals of 

feldspar, resisting decomposition, did not stand out from the rock, and furnish points of support. 

Scarcely had we attained the summit of the mountain when we beheld with astonishment the 

singular aspect of the surrounding country. The foamy bed of the waters is filled with an 

archipelago of islands covered with palm-trees. Westward, on the left bank of the Orinoco, the 

wide-stretching savannahs of the Meta and the Casanare resembled a sea of verdure. The setting 

sun seemed like a globe of fire suspended over the plain, and the solitary Peak of Uniana, which 

appeared more lofty from being wrapped in vapours which softened its outline, all contributed to 

augment the majesty of the scene. Immediately below us lay a deep valley, enclosed on every 

side. Birds of prey and goatsuckers winged their lonely flight in this inaccessible circus. We found 

a pleasure in following with the eye their fleeting shadows, as they glided slowly over the flanks of 

the rock.  A narrow ridge led us to a neighbouring mountain, the rounded summit of which 

supported immense blocks of granite. These 


_
in their shops and women on the farms, and I know that if the new world brings them as its 

heritage, only the enlarged comradeship they are taking with men in this time of suffering, then 

one thing is sure: We women will strike an awful blow at future wars! The womanhood of the past, 

someway, is like these sad, broken churches of France. It is shattered and gone, and in its ruins 

we see its exquisite beauty, its ineffable grace, its symbolism of a faith that once sufficed. But it 

will not be restored. We shall build new temples; we shall know new women. The old had to go, 

that the new might come. And our new women and our new temples shall be dedicated, not 

merely to than forty or fifty feet in diameter; and their form is so perfectly spherical, that, as they 

appear to touch the soil only by a small number of points, it might be supposed, at the least shock 

of an earthquake, they would roll into the abyss. I do not remember to have seen anywhere else a 

similar phenomenon, amid the decompositions of granitic soils. If the balls rested on a rock of a 

different nature, as in the blocks of Jura, we might suppose that they had been rounded by the 

action of water, or thrown out by the force of an elastic fluid; but their position on the summit of a 

hill alike granitic, makes it more probable that they owe their origin to the progressive
