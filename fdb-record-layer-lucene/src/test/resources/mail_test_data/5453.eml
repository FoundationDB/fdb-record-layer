e and then the other attempted to take the lead. Young Black Buck shot ahea=
d first, _
the hero, the master whom it was alike impossible to disobey and impossible=
 not to love.=20

Henceforward it is only a question of time. As the men of Medina come to kn=
ow Mohammad, they=20

too will devote themselves to him body and soul; and the enthusiasm will ca=
tch fire and spread=20

among the tribes till all Arabia is at the feet of the Prophet of the One G=
od. 'No emperor with his=20

tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of His own clouting.' He had the g=
ift of influencing men,=20

and he had the nobility only to influence them for good.  We have now to se=
e Mohammad as king.=20

Though he came as a fugitive, rejected as an impostor by his own citizens, =
yet it was not long=20

before his word was supreme in his adopted city. He had to rule over a mixe=
d and divided people,=20

and this must have helped him to the supreme voice. There were four distinc=
t parties at Medina.=20

First, the 'Refugees' (Muhajiroon), who had fled from Mekka; on these Moham=
mad could always=20

rely with implicit faith. But he attached equal importance to the early con=
verts of Medina, who had=20

invited him among them and given him a home when the future seemed very hop=
eless before him,=20

and who were thenceforward known by the honourable title of the 'Helpers' (=
Ansar). How devoted=20

was the affection of these men is shown by the well-known scene at El-Ji'ra=
neh, when the Helpers=20

were discontented with their share of the spoils, and Mohammad answered, 'W=
hy are ye disturbed=20

in mind because of the things of this life wherewith I have sought to incli=
ne the hearts of these men=20

of Mekka into Islam, whereas ye are already steadfast in the faith? Are ye =
not satisfied that others=20

should obtain the flocks and the camels, while ye carry back the Prophet of=
 the Lord unto your=20

homes? Nay, I will not leave you for ever. If all mankind went one way, and=
 the men of Medina=20

went another way, verily I would go the way of the men of Medina. The Lord =
be favourable unto=20

them, and bless them, and their sons, and their sons' sons, for ever!' And =
the 'Helpers' wept upon=20

their beards, and cried with one voice, 'Yea, we are well satisfied, O Prop=
het, with our lot.' To=20

retain the allegiance of the Refugees and the Helpers was never a trouble t=
o Mohammad; the only=20

difficulty was to rein in their zeal and hold them back from doing things o=
f blood and vengeance on=20

the enemies of Islam. To prevent the danger of ahead. While they were not a=
nxious to draw Puma=20

from his lair, they wanted to show to the fawns and does they were unafraid=
.  =E2=80=9CIf Puma comes for=20

me I=E2=80=99ll show him a clean pair of heels!=E2=80=9D boasted one.  =E2=
=80=9CAnd I,=E2=80=9D said another, =E2=80=9Cwill give him a race=20

that he=E2=80=99ll never forget.=E2=80=9D  Little did they know of what the=
y were boasting. Puma the Mountain Lion=20

never laid any great claim to swift, long distance running. He knew he was =
no match for the fleet=20

deer in this respect.  But he had ways and tricks of his own. His favorite =
method was to hide=20

among the thick foliage of the trees, and when a buck or doe passed underne=
ath to spring upon its=20

back. Once caught in this way no deer had a chance to escape. All the speed=
 in the world would=20

not avail the poor creature then.  Puma was a terrible hunter. At night tim=
e he roamed about the=20

dark woods and scented out his sleeping prey, and with one blow from his gr=
eat paw he could=20

break the back of a buck or crush the skull of a smaller animal. He could c=
limb a tree like a cat,=20

and crouch flat in the bushes out of sight to spring up as swiftly as a dee=
r leaping a chasm.  All the=20

older deer knew the ways of Puma, some from terrifying experiences, and oth=
ers only from=20

hearsay. Ever since Father Buck had been leader of the herd, they had avoid=
ed Puma, and not=20

one had fallen a prey to his voracious appetite. Perhaps they didn=E2=80=99=
t fully appreciate this, for=20

continued safety from danger often makes us think there is no real danger a=
fter all.  So when he=20

proposed leading the herd down to the succulent grass, bordering the woods =
where Puma hunted,=20

he took great precaution to avoid any risk. Several of the older bucks were=
 sent ahead scouting,=20



and they returned at intervals to report.  Father Buck led them down to the=
 broad, shallow stream=20

that he and White Tail had crossed that day on their return from Puma=E2=80=
=99s hunting ground. But=20

instead of wading down the river a short distance, the leader kept them wad=
ing until they had=20

skirted the hunting ground of Timber Wolf. He had almost as much fear of Ti=
mber as of Puma.=20

They kept to the left bank of the stream, and then crossed a shallow ford w=
here the grass and=20

reeds grew in such dense masses. They began feeding at once, but not until =
bucks had been sent=20

inland to scout for Puma. They returned to report that Puma was not abroad.=
 They had crossed=20

and re-crossed=20


_
Refugees and the Helpers, Mohammad assigned each Refugee to one of the Ansa=
r to be his=20

brother; and this tie of gossipry superseded all nearer ties, till Mohammad=
 saw the time was over=20

when it was needed. The third party in Medina was that of the 'Disaffected,=
' or in the language of=20

Islam the 'Hypocrites' (Munafikoon). This was composed of the large body of=
 men who gave in=20

their nominal allegiance to Mohammad and his religion when they saw they co=
uld not safely=20

withstand his power, but who were always ready to turn about if they though=
t there was a chance=20

of his overthrow. Mohammad treated these men and their leader 'Abdallah ibn=
 Ubayy (who himself=20

aspired to the sovranty of Medina) with patient courtesy and friendliness, =
and, though they actually=20

deserted him more than once at vitally critical moments, he never retaliate=
d, even when he was=20

strong enough to crush them, but rather sought to win them over heartily to=
 his cause by treating=20

them as though they were what he would have them be. The result was that th=
is party gradually=20

diminished and became absorbed in the general mass of earnest Muslims, and =
though up to its=20

leader's death it constantly called forth Mohammad's powers of conciliation=
, after that it vanished=20

from the history of parties.  The fourth party was the real thorn in the Pr=
ophet's side. It consisted of=20

the Jews, of whom three tribes were settled in the suburbs of Medina. They =
had  =E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99s probably=20

sleeping after a good night of hunting,=E2=80=9D Black Buck remarked. =E2=
=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=99s any danger.=E2=80=9D=20

But the leader was taking no chances. He posted scouts in the woods and on =
high rocks where=20

they could watch, listen and smell. Then the rest of the herd enjoyed their=
 feast of rich grass and=20

reeds. They munched greedily at them, their eyes filled with happiness, and=
 making as little noise=20

as possible.  Now Young Black Buck should have been satisfied to eat and en=
joy himself with the=20

rest but after he had filled his stomach he began to feel so much better th=
at he trotted around from=20

one group to another in the most restless manner. Seeing White Tail feeding=
 alone, a sudden=20

desire to get even with him for the morning=E2=80=99s work seized him.  =E2=
=80=9CHo, White Tail!=E2=80=9D he called. =E2=80=9CI=20

challenge you to a race. We=E2=80=99ll scare up Puma maybe, but that will g=
ive us a good chance to show=20

him how little we are afraid of him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs it wise to arous=
e him?=E2=80=9D asked White Tail.  =E2=80=9CWise!=E2=80=9D sniffed=20

Young Black Buck. =E2=80=9CMust you ask that question whenever you want to =
do something? But if you=E2=80=99re=20

afraid to race me through his hunting ground well and good. I=E2=80=99ll go=
 alone.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not afraid,=E2=80=9D replied=20

White Tail, =E2=80=9Cand I will accept your challenge if the older ones say=
 it is all right.=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck=20

reported the matter to the leaders, and after a consultation Father Buck an=
nounced: =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re ready=20

to go home, and if Puma is=20


_
coming. He could not indeed be the Messiah, because he was not of the linea=
ge of David; but he=20

would do very well to pass off upon their neighbours, the pagan Arabs, as, =
if not the Messiah, at=20

least a great prophet; and by his influence the Jews might regain their old=
 supremacy in Medina.=20

Mohammad's teaching was very nearly Jewish--they had taught him the fables =
of their Haggadah,=20

and he believed in their prophets--why should he not be one of them and hel=
p them to the=20

dominion? When Mohammad came, they found out their mistake; instead of a to=
ol they had a=20

master. He told the people, indeed, the stories of the Midrash, and he prof=
essed to revive the=20

religion of Abraham: but he added to this several damning articles; he taug=
ht that Jesus _was_ the=20

Messiah, and that no other Messiah was to be looked for; and, moreover, whi=
lst reverencing and=20

inculcating the doctrine of the Hebrew prophets and of Christ, as he knew i=
t, he yet insisted on his=20

own mission as in and White Tail a chance to see Puma. They will be on the =
lookout for him, and=20

when he appears they can run home. Yes, they must learn some day to meet hi=
m, and it is well=20

that it should be today.=E2=80=9D  With the consent of the leader of the he=
rd the two young bucks started off=20

into the lower woods to make a complete circuit of Puma=E2=80=99s hunting g=
round. It was a long, wild run,=20

and they would need all their strength and powers. Father Buck started them=
 off, and they=20

disappeared in the woods like two arrows shot from a bow. What happened to =
them in the race will=20

be told in the next story.                                     STORY VI    =

ge of Puma=E2=80=99s hunting=20

ground so they could circuit it and return to the starting point. Like two =
good long-distance runners,=20

neither made an effort to take=20
