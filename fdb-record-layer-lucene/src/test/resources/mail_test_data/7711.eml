poor dying boy in the hospital for whom you bought the flowers and there was the handsome New 

York woman coming over to start her hospital. There was the young doctor whom the German 

officer prisoner tried to kill. And there was the picture of the red-headed Red Cross nurse, and 

there were our dreams."  "And the ending--will you have a happy ending?" demanded Henry. 

"Aren't the visions of the young men, and the dreams of the old always happy? It is in passing 

through life from one to the other that our courage fails and our hearts sadden. And these 

phantoms are of such stuff as dreams are made of and they may not falter or grow weary, or grow 

old. Youth always has a happy ending--even in death. It is when youth fictile odoriferum). People 

are fond of drinking out of these vessels on account of the smell of the clay. The women of the 

province of Alentejo acquire a habit of masticating the bucaro earth; and feel a great privation 

when they cannot indulge this vitiated taste.) Brown relates in his History of Jamaica that the 

crocodiles of South America swallow small stones and pieces of very hard wood, when the lakes 

which they inhabit are dry, or when they are in want of food. M. Bonpland and I observed in a 

crocodile, eleven feet long, which we dissected at Batallez, on the banks of the Rio Magdalena, 

that the stomach of this reptile contained half-digested fish, and rounded fragments of granite 

three or four inches in diameter. It is difficult to admit that the crocodiles swallow these stony 

masses accidentally,

sunset, where home lay, home, and the things that were real, and dear, and worth while.  THE

hypothesis that these indolent animals like to augment their weight, that they may have less 

trouble in diving. I rather think that they load their stomach with large pebbles to excite an 

abundant secretion of the gastric juice. The experiments of Majendie render this explanation 

extremely probable. With respect to the habit of the granivorous birds,

this fond heart of mine,    Still, Love, Know well, that this heart is swallowing sand and small 

pebbles, it has been hitherto attributed to an instinctive desire of accelerating the trituration of the 

aliments in a muscular and thick stomach.  We have mentioned that tribes of Negroes on the 

Gambia mingle clay with their rice. Some families of Ottomacs were perhaps formerly accustomed 

to cause the maize and other farinaceous seeds to rot in their poya,
