 I should like to dracaena marginata I retreated from the spot a flock of r=

ave my weaknesses. I should like to _
granite, about two feet in length by fourteen inches in width. The face of =
this is roughened by=20

beating with a sharp-pointed piece of harder stone, such as quartz, or horn=
blende, and the grain is=20

reduced to flour by great labour and repeated grinding or rubbing with a st=
one rolling-pin. The flour=20

is mixed with water and allowed to ferment; it is then made into thin panca=
kes upon an=20

earthenware flat portable hearth. This species of leavened bread is known t=
o the Arabs as the=20

kisra. It is not very palatable, but it is extremely well suited to Arab co=
okery, as it can be rolled up=20

like a pancake and dipped in the general dish of meat and gravy very conven=
iently, in the absence=20

of spoons and forks. No man will condescend to grind the corn, and even the=
 Arab women have=20

such an objection to this labour, that one of the conditions of matrimony e=
nforced upon the=20

husband, if possible, provides the wife with a slave woman to prepare the f=
lour.  Hitherto we had a=20

large stock of biscuits, but as our dragoman Mahomet had, in a curious fit =
of amiability, dispensed=20

them among the camel-drivers, we were now reduced to the Arab kisras. Altho=
ugh not as=20

palatable as wheaten bread, the flour of dhurra is exceedingly nourishing, =
containing, according to=20

Professor Johnston's analysis, eleven and a half per cent. of gluten, or on=
e and a half per cent.=20

more than English wheaten flour. Thus men and beasts thrive, especially hor=
ses, which acquire an=20

excellent condition.  The neighbourhood of Cassala is well adapted for the =
presence of a large=20

town and military station, as the fertile soil produces the necessary suppl=
ies, while the river Gash=20

affords excellent water. In the rainy season this should be filtered, as it=
 brings down many=20

impurities from the torrents of Abyssinia, but in the heat of summer the ri=
ver is entirely dry, and=20

clear and wholesome water is procured from wells in the sandy bed. The sout=
h and south-east of=20

Cassala is wild and mountainous, affording excellent localities for hill st=
ations during the unhealthy=20

rainy season; but such sanitary arrangements for the preservation of troops=
 are about as much=20

heeded by the Egyptian Government as by our own, and regiments are left in =
unwholesome=20

climates to take their chance, although the means of safety are at hand.  T=
he Taka country being=20

the extreme frontier of Egypt, constant raids are made by the Egyptians upo=
n their neighbours--the=20

hostile Base, through which country the river Gash or Mareb descends. I was=
 anxious to procure=20

all the information possible concerning the Base, as it would be necessary =
to traverse the greater=20

portion in exploring the Settite river, which is the principal tributary of=
 the Atbara, and which is in=20

fact the main and parent stream, although bearing a different name. I heard=
 but one opinion of the=20

Base--it was a wild and independent country, inhabited by a ferocious race,=
 whose hand was=20

against every man, and who in return were the enemies of all by whom they w=
ere surrounded--

Egyptians, Abyssinians, Arabs, and Mek Nimmur; nevertheless, secure in thei=
r mountainous=20

stronghold, they defied all adversaries. The Base is a portion of Abyssinia=
, but the origin of the=20

tribe that occupies this ineradicable hornet's nest is unknown. Whether the=
y are the remnant of the=20

original Ethiopians, who possessed the country prior to the conquests of th=
e Abyssinians, or=20

whether they are descended from the woolly-haired tribes of the south banks=
 of the Blue Nile, is=20

equally a mystery; all we know is that they are of the same type as the inh=
abitants of Fazogle, of=20

the upper portion of the Blue River; they are exceedingly black, with wooll=
y hair, resembling in that=20

respect the negro, but without the flat nose or prognathous jaw. No quarter=
 is given on either side,=20

should the Base meet the Arabs, with whom war is to the knife. In spite of =
the overwhelming=20

superiority of their adversaries, the Base cannot be positively subdued; ar=
med with the lance as=20

their only weapon, but depending upon extreme agility and the natural diffi=
culties of their mountain=20



passes, the attack of the Base is always by stealth; their spies are ever p=
rowling about unseen like=20

the leopard, and their onset is invariably a surprise; success or defeat ar=
e alike followed by a rapid=20

retreat to their mountains.  As there is nothing to be obtained by the plun=
der of the Base but=20

women and children as slaves, the country is generally avoided, unless visi=
ted for the express=20

purpose of a slave razzia. Cultivation being extremely limited, the greater=
 portion of the country is=20

perfectly wild, and is never visited even by the Base themselves unless for=
 the purpose of hunting.=20

Several beautiful rivers descend from the mountain ranges, which ultimately=
 flow into the Atbara;=20

these, unlike the latter river, are never dry: thus, with a constant supply=
 of water, in a country of=20

forest and herbage, the Base abounds in elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotam=
i, giraffes,=20

buffaloes, lions, leopards, and great numbers of the antelope tribe.  Cassa=
la, thus situated on the=20

confines of the Taka country, is an important military point in the event o=
f war between Egypt and=20

Abyssinia, as the Base would be invaluable as allies to the Egyptians; thei=
r country commands the=20

very heart of Abyssinia, and their knowledge of the roads would be an incal=
culable advantage to=20

an invading force. On the 14th July I had concluded my arrangements for the=
 start; there had been=20

some difficulty in procuring camels, but the all-powerful firman was a neve=
r-failing talisman, and,=20

as the Arabs had declined to let their animals for hire, the Governor despa=
tched a number of=20

soldiers and seized the required number, including their owners. I engaged =
two wild young Arabs=20

of eighteen and twenty years of age, named Bacheet and Wat Gamma: the latte=
r being interpreted=20

signifies "Son of the Moon." This in no way suggests lunacy, but the young =
Arab had happened to=20

enter this world on the day of the new moon, which was considered to be a p=
articularly fortunate=20

and brilliant omen at his birth. Whether the climax of his good fortune had=
 arrived at the moment=20

he entered my service I know not,  =E2=80=9CHem!=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =
=E2=80=9CThat must have been a beautiful=20

procession at Rome,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CI was rather a spec=
tator of it than an actor in it,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, with some seriousness. =E2=80=9CIt is too long a tale to enter int=
o, but my part in those proceedings=20

was entirely misrepresented.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI believe that nothing in t=
he newspapers is ever true,=E2=80=9D said=20

Madame Phoebus.  =E2=80=9CAnd that is why they are so popular,=E2=80=9D add=
ed Euphrosyne; =E2=80=9Cthe taste of the=20

age being so decidedly for fiction.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs it true that you =
escaped from a convent to Malta?=E2=80=9D said=20

Madame Phoebus.  =E2=80=9CNot quite,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut tr=
ue enough for conversations.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAs confidential=20

as the present, I suppose?=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CYes, when we=
 are grave, as we are inclined to be=20

now,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThen, you have been fighting a good d=
eal,=E2=80=9D said Madame Phoebus.  =E2=80=9CYou are=20

putting me on a court-martial, Madame Phoebus,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=
=80=9CBut we do not know on which=20

side you were,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CThat is matter of histor=
y,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand that, you know, is=20

always doubtful.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I do not like fighting,=E2=80=9D =
said Madame Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cand for my part I never=20

could find out that it did an good.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd what do you like=
?=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CTell me how would you=20

pass your life?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, much as I do. I do not know that I=
 want any change, except I think I should=20

like it to be always summer.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd I would have perpetual =
spring,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CBut,=20

summer or spring, what would be your favorite pursuit?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CW=
ell, dancing is very nice,=E2=80=9D said=20

Madame Phoebus.  =E2=80=9CBut we cannot always, be dancing,=E2=80=9D said L=
othair.  =E2=80=9CThen we would sing,=E2=80=9D said=20

Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CBut the time comes when one can neither dance nor sin=
g,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9COh, then=20

we become part of the audience,=E2=80=9D said Madame Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cthe =
people for whose amusement=20

everybody labors.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd enjoy power without responsibility=
,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne, =E2=80=9Cdetect false notes=20

and mark awkward gestures. How can any one doubt of Providence with such a =
system of=20



constant compensation!=E2=80=9D  There was something in the society of thes=
e two sisters that Lothair=20

began to find highly attractive. Their extraordinary beauty, their genuine =
and unflagging gayety,=20

their thorough enjoyment of existence, and the variety of resources with wh=
ich they made life=20

amusing and graceful, all contributed to captivate him. They had, too, a gr=
eat love and knowledge=20

both of art and nature, and insensibly they weaned Lothair from that habit =
of introspection which,=20

though natural to him, he had too much indulged, and taught him to find sou=
rces of interest and=20

delight in external objects. He was beginning to feel happy in this islands=
 and wishing that his life=20

might never change, when one day Mr. Phoebus informed them that the Prince =
Agathonides, the=20

eldest son of the Prince of Samos, would arrive from Constantinople in a fe=
w days, and would pay=20

them a visit. =E2=80=9CHe will come with some retinue,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ph=
oebus, =E2=80=9Cbut I trust we shall be able by=20

our reception to show that the Cantacuzenes are not the only princely famil=
y in the world.=E2=80=9D  Mr.=20

Phoebus was confident in his resources in this respect, for his yacht=E2=80=
=99s crew in their Venetian=20

dresses could always furnish a guard of honor which no Grecian prince or Tu=
rkish pacha could=20

easily rival. When the eventful day arrived, he was quite equal to the occa=
sion. The yacht was=20

dressed in every part with the streaming colors of all nations, the banner =
of Gaston Phoebus=20

waved from his pavilion, the guard of honor kept the ground, but the popula=
tion of the isle were=20

present in numbers and in their most showy costume, and a battery of ancien=
t Turkish guns fired a=20

salute without an accident.  The Prince Agathonides was a youth, good looki=
ng and dressed in a=20

splendid Palikar costume, though his manners were quite European, being an =
attach to the=20

Turkish embassy at Vienna. He had with him a sort of governor, a secretary,=
 servants in Mamlouk=20

dresses, pipe-bearers, and grooms, there being some horses as presents from=
 his father to Mr.=20

Phoebus, and some rarely-embroidered kerchiefs and choice perfumes and Pers=
ian greyhounds=20

for the ladies.  =E2=80=98The arrival of the young prince was the signal fo=
r a series of entertainments on the=20

island. First of all, Mr. Phoebus resolved to give a dinner in the Frank st=
yle, to prove to=20

Agathonides that there were other members of the Cantacuzene family besides=
 himself who=20

comprehended a first-rate Frank dinner. The chief people of the island were=
 invited to this=20

banquet. They drank the choicest grapes of France and Germany, were stuffed=
 with truffles, and=20

sat on little cane chairs. But one might detect in their countenances how t=
hey sighed for their easy=20

divans, their simple dishes, and their resinous wine. Then there was a wolf=
-hunt, and other sport; a=20

great day of gymnasia, many dances and much music; in fact, there were chor=
uses all over the=20

island, and every night was a serenade.  Why such general joy? Because it w=
as understood that=20

the heir-apparent of the isle, their future sovereign, had in fact arrived =
to make his bow to the=20

beautiful Euphrosyne, as though he saw her for the first time.       CHAPTE=
R 74 Very shortly after=20

his arrival at Malta, Mr. Phoebus had spoken to Lothair about Theodora. It =
appeared that Lucien=20

Campian, though severely wounded, had escaped with Garibaldi after the batt=
le of Mentana into=20

the Italian territories. Here they were at once arrested, but not severely =
detained, and Colonel=20

Campian took the first opportunity of revisiting England, where, after sett=
ling his affairs, he had=20

returned to his native country, from which he had been separated for many y=
ears. Mr. Phoebus=20

during the interval had seen a great deal of him, and the colonel departed =
for America under the=20

impression that Lothair had been among the slain at the final struggle.  =
=E2=80=9CCampian is one of the=20

beat men I over knew,=E2=80=9D said Phoebus. =E2=80=9CHe was a remarkable i=
nstance of energy combined with=20

softness of disposition. In my opinion, however, he ought never to have vis=
ited Europe: he was=20



made to clear the backwoods, and govern man by the power of his hatchet and=
 the mildness of his=20

words. He was fighting for freedom all his life, yet slavery made=20


_
was a cloud over his happiness in his subjection to Mahomet the dragoman, w=
ho rejoiced in the=20

opportunity of bullying the two inferiors. Wat Gamma was a quiet, steady, w=
ell-conducted lad, who=20

bore oppression mildly; but the younger, Bacheet, was a fiery, wild young A=
rab, who, although an=20

excellent boy in his peculiar way, was almost incapable of being tamed and =
domesticated. I at=20

once perceived that Mahomet would have a determined rebel to control, which=
 I confess I did not=20

regret. Wages were not high in this part of the world,--the lads were engag=
ed at one and a half=20

dollar per month and their keep. Mahomet, who was a great man, suffered fro=
m the same=20

complaint to which great men are (in those countries) particularly subject:=
 wherever he went, he=20

was attacked with claimants of relationship; he was overwhelmed with profes=
sions of friendship=20

from people who claimed to be connexions of some of his family; in fact, if=
 all the ramifications of=20

his race were correctly represented by the claimants of relationship, Mahom=
et's family tree would=20

have shaded the Nubian desert.  We all have our foibles: the strongest fort=
 has its feeble point, as=20

the chain snaps at its weakest link;--family pride was Mahomet's weak link.=
 This was his tender=20

point; and Mahomet, the great and the imperious, yielded to the gentle scra=
tching of his ear if a=20

stranger claimed connexion with his ancient lineage. Of course he had no fa=
mily, with the=20

exception of his wife and two children, whom he had left in Cairo. The lady=
 whom he had=20

honoured by an admission to the domestic circle of the Mahomets was sufferi=
ng from a broken=20

arm when we started from Egypt, as she had cooked the dinner badly, and the=
 "gaddah," or large=20

wooden bowl, had been thrown at her by the naturally indignant husband, pre=
cisely as he had=20

thrown the axe at one man and the basin at another, while in our service: t=
hese were little=20

contretemps that could hardly disturb the dignity of so great a man. Mahome=
t met several relations=20

at Cassala: one borrowed money of him; another stole his pipe; the third, w=
ho declared that=20

nothing should separate them now that "by the blessing of God" they had met=
, determined to=20

accompany him through all the difficulties of our expedition, provided that=
 Mahomet would only=20

permit him to serve for love, without wages. I gave Mahomet some little adv=
ice upon this point,=20

reminding him that, although the clothes of the party were only worth a few=
 piastres, the spoons=20

and forks were silver, therefore I should hold him responsible for the hone=
sty of his friend. This=20

reflection upon the family gave great offence, and he assured me that Achme=
t, our quondam=20

acquaintance, was so near a relation that he was--I assisted him in the gen=
ealogical distinction:=20

"Mother's brother's cousin's sister's mother's son? Eh, Mahomet?" "Yes, sar=
, that's it!" "Very well,=20

Mahomet; mind he don't steal the spoons, and thrash him if he doesn't do hi=
s work!" "Yes, sar,"=20

replied Mahomet; "he all same like one brother, he one good man will do his=
 business quietly; if=20

not, master lick him." The new relation not understanding English, was perf=
ectly satisfied with the=20

success of his introduction, and from that moment he became one of the part=
y. One more addition,=20

and our arrangements were completed:-- the Governor of Cassala was determin=
ed that we should=20

not start without a representative of the Government, in the shape of a sol=
dier guide; he=20

accordingly gave us a black man, a corporal in one of the Nubian regiments,=
 who was so=20

renowned as a sportsman that he went by the name of "El Baggar" (the cow), =
on account of his=20

having killed several of the oryx antelope, known as "El Baggar et Wahash" =
(the cow of the=20

desert).  The rains had fairly commenced, as a heavy thunder-shower general=
ly fell at about 2=20

P.M. On the 15th, the entire day was passed in transporting our baggage acr=
oss the river Gash to=20

the point from which we had started upon our arrival at Cassala: this we ac=
complished with much=20



difficulty, with the assistance of about a hundred men supplied by the Gove=
rnor, from whom we=20

had received much attention and politeness. We camped for the night upon th=
e margin of the river,=20

and marched on the following morning at daybreak due west towards the Atbar=
a.  The country was=20

a great improvement upon that we had hitherto passed; the trees were larger=
, and vast plains of=20

young grass, interspersed with green bush, stretched to the horizon. The so=
il was an exceedingly=20

rich loam, most tenacious when wetted: far as the eye could reach to the no=
rth and west of=20

Cassala was the dead level plain, while to the south and east arose a broke=
n chain of mountains.=20

We had not proceeded many miles, when the numerous tracks of antelopes upon=
 the soil,=20

moistened by the shower of yesterday, proved that we had arrived in a sport=
ing country; shortly=20

after, we saw a herd of about fifty ariels (Gazelle Dama). To stalk these w=
ary antelopes I was=20

obliged to separate from my party, who continued on their direct route. Rid=
ing upon my camel, I=20

tried every conceivable dodge without success. I could not approach them no=
thing is more=20

surprising than that this Transatlantic planter should have been ordained t=
o be the husband of a=20

divine being=E2=80=94a true Hellenic goddess, who in the good days would ha=
ve been worshipped in this=20

country, and have inspired her race to actions of grace, wisdom, and beauty=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI greatly esteem=20

him,=E2=80=9D said Lothair =E2=80=9Cand I shall write to him directly.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CExcept by Campian, who spoke probably=20

about you to no one save myself,=E2=80=9D continued Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cyour =
name has never been mentioned=20

with reference to those strange transactions. Once there was a sort of rumo=
r that you had met with=20

some mishap, but these things were contradicted and explained, and then for=
gotten: and people=20

were all out of town. I believe that Cardinal Grandison communicated with y=
our man of business,=20

and between them every thing was kept quiet, until this portentous account =
of your doings at=20

Rome, which transpired after we left England and which met us at Malta.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have written to my=20

man of business about that,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut I think it =
will tax all his ingenuity to explain, or to=20

mystify it as successfully as he did the preceding adventures. At any rate,=
 he will not have the=20

assistance of my lord cardinal.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTheodora was a remarkabl=
e woman on many accounts,=E2=80=9D said Mr.=20

Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cbut particularly on this, that, although one of the most =
beautiful women that ever=20

existed, she was adored by beautiful women. My wife adored her; Euphrosyne,=
 who has no=20

enthusiasm, adored her; the Princess of Tivoli, the most capricious being p=
robably that ever=20

existed, adored; and always adored, Theodora. I think it must have been tha=
t there was on her=20

part a total absence of vanity, and this the more strange in one whose voca=
tion in her earlier life=20

had been to attract and live on popular applause; but I have seen her quit =
theatres ringing with=20

admiration and enter her carriage with the serenity of a Phidian muse.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI adored her,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut I never could quite solve her character. Perhaps it w=
as too rich and deep far rapid=20

comprehension.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe shall never perhaps see her like again=
,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CIt was a rare=20

combination, peculiar to the Tyrrhenian sea. I am satisfied that we must go=
 there to find the pure=20

Hellenic blood, and from thence it got to Rome.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe may n=
ot see her like again, but we may see=20

her again,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand sometimes I think she is alw=
ays hovering over me.=E2=80=9D  In this vein,=20

when they were alone, they were frequently speaking of the departed, and on=
e day=E2=80=94it was before=20

the arrival of Prince Agathonides=E2=80=94Mr. Phoebus said to Lothair: =E2=
=80=9CWe will ride this morning to what=20

we call the grove of Daphne. It is a real laurel-grove. Some of the trees m=
ust be immemorial, and=20

deserve to have been sacred, if once they were not so. In their huge, grote=
sque forms you would=20

not easily recognize your polished friends of Europe, so trim and glossy an=
d shrub-like. The=20



people are very fond of this grove, and make frequent processions there. On=
ce a year they must=20

be headed by their priest. No one knows why, nor has he the slightest idea =
of the reason of the=20

various ceremonies which he that day performs. But we know, and some day he=
 or his successors=20

will equally understand them. Yes, if I remain here long enough=E2=80=94and=
 I sometimes think I will=20

never again quit the isle=E2=80=94I shall expect some fine summer night, wh=
en there is that rich stillness=20

which the whispering waves only render more intense, to hear a voice of mus=
ic on the mountains=20

declaring that the god Pan has returned to earth.=E2=80=9D  It was a pictur=
esque ride, as every ride was on=20

this island, skirting the sylvan hills with the sea glimmering in the dista=
nce. Lothair was pleased=20

with the approaches to the sacred grove: now and then a single tree with gr=
ay branches and a=20

green head, then a great spread of underwood, all laurel, and then spontane=
ous plantations of=20

young trees.  =E2=80=9CThere was always a vacant space in the centre of the=
 grove,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus,=20

=E2=80=9Conce sadly overrun with wild shrubs, but I have cleared it and res=
tored the genius of the spot.=20

See!=E2=80=9D  They entered the sacred circle and beheld a statue raised on=
 a porphyry pedestal. The light=20

fell with magical effect on the face of the statue. It was the statue of Th=
eodora, the placing of=20

which in the pavilion of Belmont Mr. Phoebus was superintending when Lothai=
r first made his=20

acquaintance.       CHAPTER 75 The Prince Agathonides seemed quite to monop=
olize the=20

attention of Madame Phoebus and her sister. This was not very unreasonable,=
 considering that he=20

was their visitor, the future chief of their house, and had brought them so=
 many embroidered=20

pocket-handkerchiefs, choice scents, and fancy dogs. But Lothair thought it=
 quite disgusting, nor=20

could he conceive what they saw in him, what they were talking about or lau=
ghing about, for, so far=20

as he had been able to form any opinion on the subject, the prince was a sh=
allow-pated coxcomb=20

without a single quality to charm any woman of sense and spirit. Lothair be=
gan to consider how he=20

could pursue his travels, where he should go to, and, when that was settled=
, how he should get=20

there.  Just at=20


_
once, but made a rush for a few hundred paces, and then faced about to gaze=
 at the approaching=20

camel. After having exhausted my patience to no purpose, I tried another pl=
an: instead of=20

advancing against the wind as before, I made a great circuit and gave them =
the wind. No sooner=20

was I in good cover behind a mimosa bush than I dismounted from my camel, a=
nd, leading it until=20

within view of the shy herd, I tied it to a tree, keeping behind the animal=
 so as to be well=20

concealed. I succeeded in retreating through the bushes unobserved, leaving=
 the camel as a=20

gazing point to attract their attention. Running at my best speed to occurr=
ed which no one could=20

foresee, but which, like every event, removed some difficulties and introdu=
ced others.  There=20

arrived at the island a dispatch forwarded to Mr. Phoebus by the Russian am=
bassador at=20

Constantinople, who had received it from his colleague at London. This disp=
atch contained a=20

proposition to Mr. Phoebus to repair to the court of St. Petersburg, and ac=
cept appointments of=20

high distinction and emolument. Without in any way restricting the independ=
ent pursuit of his=20

profession, he was offered a large salary, the post of court painter, and t=
he presidency of the=20

Academy of Fine Arts. Of such moment did=20


_
same point from which I had commenced my circuit, and keeping under cover o=
f the scattered=20

bushes, I thus obtained the correct wind, and stalked up from bush to bush =
behind the herd, who=20

were curiously watching the tied camel, that was quietly gazing on a mimosa=
. In this way I had=20

succeeded in getting within 150 yards of the beautiful herd, when a sudden =
fright seized them, and=20

they rushed off in an opposite direction to the camel, so as to pass about =
120 yards on my left; as=20

they came by in full speed, I singled out a superb animal, and tried the fi=
rst barrel of the little=20

Fletcher rifle. I heard the crack of the ball, and almost immediately after=
wards the herd passed on,=20

leaving one lagging behind at a slow canter; this was my wounded ariel, who=
 shortly halted, and=20

laid down in an open glade. Having no dog, I took the greatest precaution i=
n stalking, as a=20

wounded antelope is almost certain to escape if once disturbed when it has =
lain down. There was=20

a small withered stem of a tree not thicker than a man's thigh; this grew w=
ithin thirty yards of the=20

antelope; my only chance of approach was to take a line direct for this sli=
ght object of cover. The=20

wind was favourable, and I crept along the ground. I had succeeded in arriv=
ing within a few yards=20

of the tree when up jumped the antelope, and bounded off as though unhurt; =
but there was no=20

chance for it at this distance, and I rolled it over with a shot through th=
e spine.  Having done the=20

needful with my beautiful prize, and extracted the official presence of thi=
s illustrious artist in their=20

country, that it was intimated, if the arrangement could be effected, its c=
onclusion might be=20

celebrated by conferring on Mr. Phoebus a patent of nobility and a decorati=
on of a high class. The=20

dispatch contained a private letter from an exalted member of the imperial =
family, who had had the=20

high and gratifying distinction of making Mr. Phoebus=E2=80=99s acquaintanc=
e in London, personally=20

pressing the acceptance by him of the general proposition, assuring him of =
cordial welcome and=20

support, and informing Mr. Phoebus that what was particularly desired at th=
is moment was a=20

series of paintings illustrative of some of the most memorable scenes in th=
e Holy Land and=20

especially the arrival of the pilgrims of the Greek rite at Jerusalem. As f=
or this purpose he would=20

probably like to visit Palestine, the whole of the autumn or even a longer =
period was placed at his=20

disposal; so that, enriched with all necessary drawings and studies, he mig=
ht achieve his more=20

elaborate performances in Russia at his leisure and with every advantage.  =
Considering that the=20

great objects in life with Mr. Phoebus were to live in an Aryan country, am=
id an Aryan race, and=20

produce works which should revive for the benefit of human nature Aryan cre=
eds, a proposition to=20

pass some of the prime years of his life among the Mongolian race, and at t=
he same time devote=20

his pencil to the celebration Semitic subjects, was startling.  =E2=80=9CI =
shall say nothing to Madame=20

Phoebus until the prince=20


_
the stalk. Hardly had I led the animal to the body of the ariel, when I hea=
rd a rushing sound like a=20

strong wind, and down came a vulture with its wings collapsed, falling from=
 an immense height=20

direct to its prey, in its eagerness to be the first in the race. By the ti=
me that I had fastened the ariel=20

across the back of the camel, many vultures were sitting upon the ground at=
 a few yards' distance,=20

while others were arriving every minute: before I had shot the ariel, not a=
 vulture had been in sight;=20

the remarked to Lothair; =E2=80=9Che will go the day after to-morrow. I do =
not know what they may offer to=20

make me=E2=80=94probably only a baron, perhaps a count. But you know in Rus=
sia a man may become a=20

prince, and I certainly should like those Cantacuzenes to feel that after a=
ll their daughter is a=20

princess with no thanks to them. The climate is detestable, but one owes mu=
ch to one=E2=80=99s=20

profession. Art would be honored at a great, perhaps the greatest, court. T=
here would not be a=20

fellow at his easel in the streets about Fitzroy=20
