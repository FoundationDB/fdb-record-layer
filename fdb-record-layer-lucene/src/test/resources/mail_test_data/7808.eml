imperious clash of the luncheon-bell. Old Mr. Warrender and Lucy appeared u=

day had been a=20

success. The lawn at The Warren was an ideal croquet-lawn, large, level, an=
d daisyless. It was an=20

old lawn, and was carefully watered. What better place, then, for the local=
 tournament to be fought=20

out upon, than the old lawn at The Warren.  At last the final game has been=
 played. The day had=20

been excessively warm. Everybody was sitting in the shade discussing the cl=
aret-cup, the=20

syllabubs, the strawberries and cream, and the home-made confectionery, tha=

pressed upon the large and rather miscellaneous assemblage which filled the=
 old-fashioned=20

grounds of Diggory Warrender. The owner of this archaic name we have met fo=
r an instant in the=20

preceding chapter. He was a hale old country gentleman, a J.P. for his coun=
ty, and universally=20

liked. Perhaps there was more of the yeoman than the squire about old Mr. W=
arrender. Though he=20

farmed many acres, yet he did so at a profit, strange to say. But perhaps t=
his is hardly to be=20

wondered at when it is remembered that the acres were his own, and that con=
sequently there was=20

no rent to pay.  Mr. Warrender, who rather scorned claret-cup, was about to=
 discuss the merits of=20

old Warrender said;=20

"It has made me the man I am," and certainly this statement was a flaming t=

oved that, at all events as=20

Spunyarn shook his=20

head as he signed to the butler to give him what he termed a B. and S.  "Be=
