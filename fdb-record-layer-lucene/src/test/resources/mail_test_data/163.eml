philodendron monstera trials was 37.5 knots an hour.  After we had seen eno=
ugh, we went back to the ship and tried to look as if we had been working w=
ith one of the fatigue parties on shore. It worked!  We marched off the shi=
p midday and then I had to go on guard again all night. That was the first =
time we were allowed ashore to see the town, and I was on guard, use of his=
 name as a patron. It was not till after this that the annunciation of this=
 work took place; and it is certain that had not all hope of the resumption=
 of Dr. Bruce's Journal been completely cut off, _this_ would not have appe=
ared.  [2] The efforts of Stephen Elliott, Esq. of South Carolina, in regar=

ready to disembark.  Near our ship's stern is a barge full of ventilators a=

which are taken away when ships are cleared for action. Some of the rifle r=

 cleared for action, all=20

inflammable fittings, such as wooden doors, ladders, racks, extra boats, an=

discarded. If the order to "clear the decks for action" comes at sea, overb=

not, however, permit Captain Cook to ascertain whether he could coast aroun=

was ultimately attached to land, or was a part of a vast field extending to=
 the south pole. This last=20

is however highly improbable, because being found about 23=C2=B0 from the p=
ole, it is hardly credible=20

that it would occupy so extensive a region as to embrace the pole, and, per=
haps extend as much=20

farther beyond; especially as in similar latitudes in the opposite hemisphe=

comparatively free, and has been pushed even to more than 80=C2=B0 of north=
 latitude.  The scientific,=20
