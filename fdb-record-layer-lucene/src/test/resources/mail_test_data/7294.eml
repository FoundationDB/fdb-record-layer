philodendron monstera see how they could help thinking that I did it--because Doctor Wells always talks things over with Mr. Stevens."  "Why didn't you tell them that you had seen me coming down that fire-escape?" demanded Snubby.  "You know why I didn't do that," Teeny-bits replied, "and you know that I philodendron monstera see how they could help thinking that I did it--because Doctor Wells always talks things over with Mr. Stevens."  "Why didn't you tell them that you had seen me coming down that fire-escape?" demanded Snubby.  "You know why I didn't do that," Teeny-bits replied, "and you know that I _
wanted to ask you a question that has been bothering me for nearly a week. You remember last 

Monday night when we had the mass meeting?"  A queer look came over Snubby's face. "Yes, I 

remember that night all right."  "Well," said Teeny-bits, "you know the fellows got me up on the 

platform and made me say something, and then, instead of sitting down, I went out and started to 

come back to the dormitory. That was about nine o'clock and no one was stirring on the campus 

because all the fellows had gone to the mass meeting."  Teeny-bits was silent for a moment as if 

waiting for Snubby to say something, but Snubby only continued to look at him with the same 

queer expression of expectation that had come into his face at first mention of the mass meeting. 

"Well," continued Teeny-bits, "you know, something happened. I was coming along pretty her 

attraction, would volatilize the matter of meteoric stones in a moment; hence they would not be 

projected from the Lunarian crater in solid masses, but in elastic vapour.  In conclusion, although 

the theory which I have endeavoured to elucidate and establish, be subject to some difficulties and 

objections which science may hereafter remove, it appears to me perfectly consonant with the 

relative dependence and harmony of our system, and by no means at variance with the infinite 

wisdom and power by which it was originated.     ART. XII. _Observations upon the prevailing 

Currents of Air in the State of Ohio and the Regions of the West, by_ CALEB ATWATER, _Esq. of

down a fire-escape rope and getting into Campbell's window. Of course, that made me think of the 

things that had been stolen from the fellows' rooms and so I stepped into the bushes out there 

behind the dormitory and waited until the fellow came out and I saw who it was."  "Yes," cried 

Snubby, whose face had suddenly become red, "and of course you've been thinking all this time 

that I was the one who got away with the money and things?"  "No!" said Teeny-bits. "There's 

where you're wrong; I haven't been thinking any such thing. I _know_ that there's some other 

explanation and I want you to give it to me, Snubby,--for more reasons than one. I'll tell you 

something that I'm sure you don't know. That same night, Doctor Wells called me over to his office 

and showed me a letter that some one had written, saying that _I_ was the one who had stolen the 

things."  "That _you_ were the one?" echoed Snubby with a look of amazement.  "Yes," declared 

Teeny-bits, "that I was the one, and of course I told Doctor Wells that it wasn't true and he 

believed me, but it said in that letter that the things were hidden under the floor of my closet and 

when Doctor Wells and I went up to my room after the lights were out in the dormitories, we found 

all that stuff, including Harper's sailing trophy, Ned's gold knife, your watch and all the other 

trinkets that anybody has missed ever since things  (Communicated for the American Journal of 

Science, &c.)     _Circleville, Ohio, July 23, 1818._    DEAR SIR,  With pleasure, I acknowledge the 

receipt of the circular letter bearing date the 5th instant, which you addressed to me, for which you 

will be pleased to accept my warmest acknowledgments for yourself personally, and the 

Philosophical Society of which you are the president. To answer all the questions which are put to 

me in that letter, is not at present within my limited means, either as it respects the leisure or the 

ability. I shall therefore, at this time, confine myself to "observations upon the prevailing currents of 

air in the state of Ohio."[41] These observations will be wholly founded on personal experience, 

during the four years in which I have traversed this state, from Lake Erie to the Ohio river, whilst 

attending on the several courts, in all seasons and in all the changes of weather.  The prevailing 

currents of air, one of which generally obtains in Ohio, are three.  The first comes from the 

Mexican Gulf, ascending the Mississippi and its larger tributary branches quite to their very 

sources.  The second proceeds from the back of mountains to the west, descends the Missouri to 

its mouth, and then spreads over a vast extent of country.  The third comes down the great 

northern and northwestern lakes to the south end of Lake Michigan and the southern

"But that didn't make Doctor Wells believe that you had stolen the stuff!" cried Snubby. "_He_ 

wouldn't think just because----"  "But something else happened, too," said Teeny-bits. "When I was 

crouching in the bushes behind the dormitory and just after you had crawled back into your room 

that night, Mr. Stevens came along and found me there, and I couldn't make any explanation, you 

where it spreads over the region of country lying to the south of them.  That current of air which 

comes from the Mexican Gulf, is warmer, and perhaps more moist, than any other which prevails 

here. After a few days prevalence, it uniformly brings rain along with it. That this current of air 

should be very warm may be readily conceived, when we reflect that it comes from a hot tropical
