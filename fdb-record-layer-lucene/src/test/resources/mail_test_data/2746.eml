They say that he had a carpet of green silk, on which his throne was placed=
, being of a prodigious=20

length and breadth, and sufficient for all his forces to stand on, the men =
placing themselves on his=20

right hand, and the spirits [or jinn] on his left; and that when all were i=
n order the wind at his=20

command took up the carpet and transported it with all that were upon it wh=
erever he pleased; the=20

army of birds at the same time flying over their heads and forming a kind o=

from the sun.--S.  [313] of food allotted to each person. Among the more we=
ll-to-do classes,=20

however, the table was a more ornamental piece of furniture. The benches or=
 stools still remained,=20

but the rest was more civilized. The food, consisting of vegetables, roast =
fowls, boiled meats, and=20

fish was served in large earthenware platters. There were no forks, but spo=
ons and fingers were=20

freely used as well as knives, each guest frequently using his own knife or=
 dagger. As the guests=20

had to help themselves, often with their fingers, out of the common serving=
 platters, there was=20

which was the time the image had been worshipped in his house, the devil [o=

and threw the signet into the sea: the signet was immediately swallowed by =
a fish, which being=20

taken and given to Solomon, he found the ring in its belly, and, having by =
this hands, for which the=20

trumpeter sounded a call. Every gentleman had the right to _faire corner l'=

that is, to have his trumpeter sound the call for washing hands. When this =
call sounded the pages=20

of the establishment bore the ewer to the ladies, and servants of less pret=
ension did likewise for=20

the gentlemen. Napkins were provided for drying one's=20
