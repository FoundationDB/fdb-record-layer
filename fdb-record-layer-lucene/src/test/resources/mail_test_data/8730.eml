small pieces of mutton in butter and garlic (very good); and No. 4 was an excellent dish of the 

usual melach, already described.  The wind had within the last few days changed to south, and we 

had been subjected to dust storms and sudden whirlwinds similar to those we had experienced at 

this season in the preceding year, when about to start from Berber. We left Rufaar, and continued 

our march along the banks of the Blue Nile, towards Khartoum. It was Brigade wanted a man for

at a depth of about three feet, which renders it unnavigable for large boats, which, laden with corn, 

supply Khartoum from the fertile provinces of the south. The river had now begun to rise, although 

it was still low, and the water was muddy, as the swelling torrents of Abyssinia brought impurities 

into the main thought to be almost equal to Ned--indeed, in personal activity he was superior; but 

there was nothing desperate in Joe's character.  He was ever ready to dare anything with a sort of 

jovial alacrity, but he did not appear, like Ned, to court martyrdom.  While Ned and David subdued 

the flames above, Joe descended the escape, and being by that time almost exhausted, sat down 

to rest with several comrades who had endured the first shock of battle, while fresh men were sent 

to continue the fight.  "Have a glass, Joe?" said one of the firemen, coming round with a bottle of 

brandy.  "No, thank 'ee," said Joe, "I
