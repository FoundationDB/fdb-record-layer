philodendron monstera half-hour."  "Then, I am glad we have found it," added Louis.  "What's the name of the bay, Captain?" inquired Felix, scratching his head.  "Khrysoko," repeated Scott.

clean fight you've forgotten the moves, and it's your own fault."  Once more the man with the fierce 

eyes and the dominating jaw took time to consider. Like others of his class, he was partisan only in 

the sense of one fighting hardily for the side upon which he had happened to be drawn in the great 

world battle. If he had not long ago parted with his convictions, the heat and smoke of the battle 

had obscured them, and he chose his weapons now with little regard for anything beyond their 

possible efficacy.  "You are sparring with me, Blount," he said finally. "You are talking to me as 

you might talk to a committee of the Good Government League--and possibly for the same reason. 

Let's get together. You control the political situation in your State, and we frankly recognize that 

fact. It's a matter of business, and we can settle it on a business basis. I have been outspoken and 

above-board with you and have told you what we want. Meet me halfway and tell me what you 

want."  "I want a square deal all around, Hardwick; that's all. You've got to take the same ground 

and make a clean fight if you want me with you. I can't make it any plainer than that, can I?"  "I 

don't know yet what you are driving at," frowned the vice-president, "nor just why you have taken 

this particular occasion to read me a kindergarten lecture on political methods. In times past I 

suppose we have both done some things that we would like to have decently buried and forgotten, 

but--"  "But right there we break apart, McVickar," cut in the other, setting his jaw with a peculiar 

hardening of the facial muscles that gave him the appearance of a fierce old viking attacking at the 

head of his squadrons. "I'm telling you over again that a new day has dawned in American politics; 

I and my kind recognize it, and you and your kind don't seem to be big enough to recognize it. 

That is the difference between us. In the obey. He would not do that, and I am here. If there is to 

be any row on my account I must be in it."  "You have a mind of your own, and you are in condition 

to have your own way. If your mother had been posted you would not have been here."  "We don't 

know; but I think I have as much influence with my mother as she has with me. I hardly believe 

she could or would make me act the part of a coward."  The subject was dropped there, for it 

seemed to be exhausted. The night wore away very slowly, and nothing more was seen of the 

Fatime's lights. The morning watch came on duty at four o'clock; but the captain did not leave the 

deck. It was evident to him that the sail had increased the speed of the Maud, and perhaps that 

was the reason she had run away from the chaser. An hour later, with the dawn of the day, the 

gale broke.  "Land, ho!" shouted Louis over the forward part of the upper deck, so that Morris 

could hear him at the wheel; and the captain rushed out of the pilot-house where he had lain down 

on the divan.  "Where away?" called the first officer.  "Broad on the starboard bow," replied Louis. 

"That must be the country south-west of Cape Arnauti," said Scott, after he had examined the 

shore with the glass. "Make the course north north-east, Morris," he shouted to the wheelman. 

"North north-east!" returned the helmsman.  "There are mountains on this island, some of them 

nearly seven thousand feet high; and there is a cluster of them close to the shore here," added the 

captain.  It was another hour before they could distinctly make out these mountains; and by that 

time the end of the cape could be seen on the beam. The speed of the Maud had been reduced 

one-half, and the course due east was given out. She followed the land around the cape, and was 

soon in smooth water. With the chart before him at the helm, and with Morris heaving the lead, 

Captain Scott piloted the Maud

to fight for a railroad majority in the legislature, and you want Reynolds for the head of the ticket 

because you know that you can depend upon his veto if you don't get your majority in the House 

and Senate. You are not going to get Reynolds, or the majority either, without the help of the party 

organization."  "We can put it much more elementally than that," supplemented the railroad man. 

"We get nothing without your say-so as the head of the party organization. That is precisely why I

we are!" shouted Captain Scott, as the cable slid out through the hawse-hole.  "That's so; but 

where are we?" asked Louis, who had been watching the bottom for the last hour. "There is a big 

ledge of rocks not twenty feet from the cutwater. Here we are; but where are we?"  "We are on the 

south-west shore of Khrysoko Bay," replied the captain. "That ledge of
