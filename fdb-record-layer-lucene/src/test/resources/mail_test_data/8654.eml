philodendron monstera this song of tumultuous and varied emotion with calm =
confidence and a vow of thanksgiving for a deliverance which is already as =
good as accomplished:    (17) I will give thanks to Jehovah according to Hi=
s righteousness,        And I will sing the name of Jehovah, Most High.  We=
 have still another psalm (lvii.) which is perhaps best referred to this pe=
riod. According to the title, it belongs to the time when then it contains =
within it a regenerating power hitherto undeveloped, whereby the world may =
be absolutely reformed. I will venture to assert that Christian nations wil=
l make no moral progress so long as they continue to cherish the pagan supe=
rstition that religion consists in trying to save themselves by virtue of a=
 creed, instead of in trying to save others by the virtues of a life."  "Bu=
t that's works," philodendron monstera this song of tumultuous and varied e=
motion with calm confidence and a vow of thanksgiving for a deliverance whi=
ch is already as good as accomplished:    (17) I will give thanks to Jehova=
h according to His righteousness,        And I will sing the name of Jehova=
h, Most High.  We have still another psalm (lvii.) which is perhaps best re=
ferred to this period. According to the title, it belongs to the time when =
then it contains within it a regenerating power hitherto undeveloped, where=
by the world may be absolutely reformed. I will venture to assert that Chri=
stian nations will make no moral progress so long as they continue to cheri=
sh the pagan superstition that religion consists in trying to save themselv=
es by virtue of a creed, instead of in trying to save others by the virtues=
 of a life."  "But that's works," _
(6) Awake for me--Thou hast commanded judgment.    (7) Let the assembly of =
the nations stand=20

round Thee,       And above it return Thou up on high.    (8) Jehovah will =
judge the nations.=20

Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and mine        integrit=
y in me!  Each smaller=20

act of God's judgment is connected with the final world-judgment, is a prop=
hecy of it, is one in=20

principle therewith; and He, who at the last will be known as the universal=
 Judge of all, certainly=20

cannot leave His servants' cause unredressed nor their cry unheard till the=
n. The psalmist is led by=20

his own history to realize more intensely that truth of a Divine manifestat=
ion for judicial purposes to=20

the whole world, and his prophetic lip paints its solemnities as the surest=
 pledge of his own=20

deliverance. He sees the gathered nations standing hushed before the Judge,=
 and the Victor God=20

at the close of the solemn act ascending up on high where He was before, ab=
ove the heads of the=20

mighty crowd (Psalm lxviii. 19). In the faith of this vision, and because G=
od will judge the nations,=20

he invokes for himself the anticipation of that final triumph of good over =
evil, and asks to be dealt=20

with according to his righteousness. Nothing but the most hopeless determin=
ation to find=20

difficulties could make a difficulty of such words. David is not speaking o=
f his whole character or=20

life, but of his conduct in one specific matter, namely, in his relation to=
 Saul. The righteous integrity=20

which he calls God to vindicate is not general sinlessness nor inward confo=
rmity with the law of=20

God, but his blamelessness in all his conduct to his gratuitous foe. His pr=
ayer that God would=20

judge him is distinctly equivalent to his often repeated cry for deliveranc=
e, which should, as by a=20

Divine arbitration, decide the debate between Saul and him. The whole passa=
ge in the psalm, with=20

all its lyrical abruptness and lofty imagery, is the expression of the very=
 same thought which we=20

find so prominent in his words to Saul, already quoted, concerning God's ju=
dging between them=20

and delivering David out of Saul's hand. The parallel is instructive, not o=
nly as the prose rendering=20

of the poetry in the psalm, explaining it beyond the possibility of misunde=
rstanding, but also as=20

strongly confirmatory of the date which we have assigned to the latter. It =
is so improbable as to be=20

almost inconceivable that the abrupt disconnected themes of the psalm shoul=
d echo so precisely=20

the _whole_ of the arguments used in the remonstrance of the historical boo=
ks, and should=20

besides present verbal resemblances and historical allusions to these, unle=
ss it be of the same=20

period, and therefore an inlet into the mind of the fugitive as he lurked a=
mong the rugged cliffs by=20

"the fountain of the wild goat."  In that aspect the remainder of the psalm=
 is very striking and=20

significant. We have two main thoughts in it--that of God as punishing evil=
 in this life, and that of=20

the self-destruction inherent in all sin; and these are expressed with such=
 extraordinary energy as=20

to attest at once the profound emotion of the psalmist, and his familiarity=
 with such ideas during his=20

days of persecution. It is noticeable, too, that the language is carefully =
divested of all personal=20

reference; he has risen to the contemplation of a great law of the Divine g=
overnment, and at that=20

elevation the enemies whose calumnies and cruelties had driven him to God f=
ade into=20

insignificance.  With what magnificent boldness he paints God the Judge arr=
aying Himself in His=20

armour of destruction!    (11) God is a righteous Judge,        And a God (=
who is) angry every day.=20

(12) If he (_i.e._, the evil-doer) turn not, He whets His sword,        His=
 bow He has bent, and made=20

it ready.    (13) And for him He has prepared weapons of death,        His =
arrows He has made=20

blazing darts.  Surely there is nothing grander in any poetry than this tre=
mendous image, smitten=20

out with so few strokes of the chisel, and as true as it is grand. The repr=
esentation applies to the=20

facts of life, of which as directed by a present Providence, and not of any=
 future retribution, David=20



is here thinking. Among these facts is chastisement falling upon obstinate =
antagonism to God.=20

Modern ways of thinking shrink from such representations; but the whole his=
tory of the world=20

teems with confirmation of their truth--only what David calls the flaming a=
rrows of God, men call=20

"the natural consequences of evil." The later revelation of God in Christ b=
rings into greater=20

prominence the disciplinary character of all punishment here, but bates no =
jot of the intensity with=20

which the earlier revelation grasped the truth of God as a righteous Judge =
in eternal opposition to,=20

and aversion from, evil.  With that solemn picture flaming before his inwar=
d eye, the prophet-

psalmist turns to gaze on the evil-doer who has to bear the brunt of these =
weapons of light.=20

Summoning us to look with him by a "Behold!" he tells his fate in an image =
of frequent occurrence=20

in the psalms of this period, and very natural in the lips of a man I came =
to work the thing out, I=20

found that there was a practical difficulty in the way, and that you could =
not be unselfish from a=20

selfish motive a bit more than you could look like a sane man while you wer=
e really still an idiot.=20

And so the fact is, I have talked the notion out to you as it has been sugg=
ested to me, though=20

Drippings nearly drove it out of my head. I think the reason I felt impelle=
d to do so was, that had it=20

not been for your sister I should never have thought upon such subjects as =
I do now. I know her=20

love for you, and the value of her influence over you. Even now she is devo=
ting herself to guarding=20

your interests in the most important step of a man's life, and I seem insti=
nctively to feel how I can=20

best please her. Don't you think she agrees in what I have said to-night, a=
nd would approve of the=20

conversation we have had?"  "Yes," said Broadhem. "Do you know you are quit=
e a different sort of=20

fellow from what I imagined. I always thought that you did not believe in a=
nything."  "That was=20

because I lived exactly like my neighbours, without adding to my daily life=
 the sin of professing=20

belief in a religion to which it was diametrically opposed. Most of the sce=
ptics of the present day=20

are driven to their opinions by their consciences, which revolt against the=
 current hypocrisy and=20

glaring inconsistencies that characterise the profession of the popular the=
ology. As a class I have=20

found them honester, and in every way better men than modern Christians."  =
"Do you know why?"=20

"No," said Broadhem.  "Because modern Christians don't really believe much =
more than sceptics--

a man's life is the result of his internal, not his external belief. There =
can be no life separate from=20

internal belief, and the lives of men are imperfect because their belief is=
 external. The right thing=20

believed the right way must inevitably produce the perfect life. Either, th=
en, the civilised world=20

believes the wrong thing, or it believes the right thing the wrong way. In =
other words, faith and=20

charity are inseparable, and when one is perfect the other is too. That is =
what I mean by 'living the=20

life.'"  "According to that, you would make out that nobody rightly believe=
s the Christian religion=20

who is not perfect; that, you know, is ridiculous," said Broadhem.  "That i=
s, nevertheless, exactly=20

what I do mean. To know the doctrine, it is necessary to do the will. Chris=
tians of the present day=20

adopt certain theological dogmas intellectually and call them their religio=
us belief. This has a=20

superficial and varying influence upon their lives, for it consists merely =
of opinions which are liable=20

to change. The only kind of faith which is inseparable from life is a divin=
e conviction of truth=20

imparted to the intellect through the heart, and which becomes as absolute =
to the internal=20

conscience as one's existence, and as impossible of proof. It may be added =
to, but what has once=20

been thus accepted can never be changed. Such a faith cannot be selfish, fo=
r it has been derived=20

from the affections, hence the life must be charitable. But the modern Chri=
stian belief, received by=20

an effort of pure reason directly through the intellect, is not a divine in=
tuition, which, if embodied,=20



would result in a perfect life and a united Church, but a theological probl=
em which professors of=20

religion, unlike professors of mathematics, are at liberty to solve for the=
ir own benefit, according to=20

their own taste, and to quarrel about incessantly, thereby giving occasion =
to the thoughtless to=20

scoff, and to the thoughtful to reject all revelation as 'foolishness'--sin=
ce it is incapable of=20

demonstration by the Baconian method,--the only one known to these 'wise an=
d prudent'=20

philosophers, but one by which, fortunately for them, 'babes' are not expec=
ted to prove their=20

relationship before believing in their mothers."  "Then," said Broadhem, "y=
ou actually mean to say=20

that the whole of Christendom is wanting in this faith?"  "I fear that almo=
st universally they mistake=20

a bare belief for faith. Their theology thus becomes an _act_ of memory ins=
tead of a rule of life,=20

and Christianity is reduced to a superstition. The only way of distinguishi=
ng superstition from true=20

religion is by an examination of results. But where are the fruits of moder=
n Christianity? If it be=20

absolutely true, and all-sufficient for purposes of regeneration, how am I =
to account for the singular=20

fact that there is as much wickedness in London in the year 1865 A.D., as t=
here was in Jerusalem=20

in the year 1 B.C.? If the object of the last revelation was to take the pl=
ace of the one before it, and=20

to reform the world, why are the best modern Christians of my acquaintance =
no holier than the=20

best modern Jews whom I have the honour to know?"  "But the object of the l=
ast revelation was=20

not to reform the world, but to save it," he replied.  "Thanks, Broadhem, f=
or having put in rather too=20

epigrammatic a form, perhaps, to please those who believe it, the most diab=
olical sophism that=20

was ever invented to beguile a Church--the doctrine that men can be saved b=
y opinion without=20


_
in the desert among wild creatures, and stumbling sometimes into the traps =
dug for them: "He has=20

dug a hole and hollowed it out, and he falls into the pitfall he is making.=
" The crumbling soil in=20

which he digs makes his footing on the edge more precarious with every spad=
eful that he throws=20

out, and at last, while he is hard at work, in he tumbles. It is the convic=
tion spoken in the proverbs=20

of all nations, expressed here by David in a figure drawn from life--the co=
nviction that yet because=20

his faith is good his salvation is sure--that he can, by such a miserable p=
hilosophy as would=20

disgrace the justice of the earth, escape the just sentence to be passed up=
on all his deeds. The=20

results of so fatal a dogma must be a Church that tends to atheism, and tha=
t loves corruption.=20

There is in every heart a something that speaks against this, and speaks wi=
th a burning language=20

that sweeps the invisible chords of the inmost consciousness, and awakens a=
 torrent of=20


_
its own grave and is self-destructive. The psalm does not proclaim the yet =
deeper truth that this=20

automatic action, by which sin sets in motion its own punishment, has a dis=
ciplinary purpose, so=20

that the arrows of God wound for healing, and His armour is really girded o=
n for, even while it=20

seems to be against, the sufferer. But it would not be difficult to show th=
at that truth underlies the=20

whole Old Testament doctrine of retribution, and is obvious in many of Davi=
d's psalms. In the=20

present one the deliverance of the hunted prey is contemplated as the end o=
f the baffled trapper's=20

fall into his own snare, and beyond that the psalmist's thoughts do not tra=
vel. His own safety, the=20

certainty that his appeal to God's judgment will not be in vain, fill his m=
ind; and without following=20

the fate of his enemy further, denial of the shallow sophistry that a man c=
an be saved if his=20

thoughts and life are bad. If he cherish self-love, and the love of ruling =
others, though he intrench=20

the intellect in the midst of all creeds, and span the reason with all fait=
hs, making a sacred public=20

profession before all men, he but adds to the heinousness of his crime, and=
 makes more terrible=20

the fast-coming and final judgment."  Broadhem stopped suddenly in the stre=
et as I finished in a=20

somewhat excited tone, and gasped rather than spoke, "Frank, you literally =
astound me. I could=20

never have believed it possible you would have come out in that line. Are t=
hose your own ideas or=20

another's?"  "Another's," I replied, coolly. "I believe they are rather uns=
ound, but I commend them=20

to your notice, because, if they are not correct, Christianity will=20
