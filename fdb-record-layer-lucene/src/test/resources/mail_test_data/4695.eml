at extra work should mean=20

extra pay or its equivalent in help. It is astonishing how inconsiderate ma=
ny women, otherwise=20

kindly, are in their relation to domestic servants.  As to the reason given=
 by the fourth=20

housekeeper, it is too contemptible to be considered by a sensible woman. O=

 of our manner of living.=20

The woman whose house is clean and furnished as her means permit, who sets =
her table with the=20

best that she can provide for her own dear ones, is always prepared for com=

times when the unlooked-for coming of a guest is an inconvenience. It shoul=

one is not, need cause a=20

which she has decided, giving the hour of the arrival of trains, and saying=
 that she or some=20

 "Except one day's gout,=20

which I cured with the _bootikins_, I have   been quite well since I saw yo=
u."  Eight years=20

afterwards his expectations of _cure_ from them were not so high. In a lett=
er to the Rev. Mr. Cole,=20

dated June 5, 1775, he remarks:    "I am perfectly well, and expect to be s=
o for a year and a half. I=20

desire no more of my _bootikins_ than to curtail my fits."  Dr. E. J. Seymo=
ur (_Thoughts on the=20

Nature and Treatment of several severe Diseases of the Human Body_, i. 107.=
: London, 1847),=20

says that--    "The _bootikins_ were simply a glove, with a partition for t=

There is no greater cruelty than that of allowing a guest in the home to fe=
el that matters would run=20

more smoothly were she absent. Only better breeding on the part of the visi=
tor than is possessed=20

by her hostess will prevent her leaving the house and returning to her home=
. Should sudden=20

illness in the family occur, the considerate person will leave. But this mu=
st be permitted only under=20

protest. To invite a friend to one=E2=80=99s house, and then seem to find h=
er presence unwelcome is only a=20

degree less cruel than confining a bird in a cage, where he can not forage =
for himself, and slowly=20

starving him. If one has not the hospitable instinct developed strongly eno=
ugh to feel the right=20

sentiment, let him feign it, or refuse to attempt to entertain friends. The=
 person under one=E2=80=99s roof=20

should be, for the time, sacred, and the host who does not feel this is alt=
