philodendron monstera it was--for it _still is_--a mystery word. The Baron =
further explains:       It appears to me that our PTR is literally the old =
Aramaic and     Hebrew "Patar," which occurs in the history of Joseph as th=
e     specific word for _interpreting_, whence also Pitrum is the term     =
for interpretation of a text, a dream.(230)   This word, PTR, was partially=
 interpreted owing to  5. Malpractice cases, involving the degree of care a=

 NOT AN=20

INITIATE.   As to Peter, biblical criticism has shown that in all probabili=
ty he had no more to do=20

with the foundation of the Latin Church at Rome than to furnish the pretext=
, so readily seized upon=20

by the cunning Irenaeus, of endowing the Church with a new name for the Apo=
stle--Petra or Kiffa--

a name which, by an easy the witness, and so be placed upon the record, pas=
sage by passage,=20

and the witness may be asked whether he agrees with that doctrine, not, how=
ever, as part of his=20

direct examination, but as part of his cross-examination.  A medical expert=
 is sometimes=20

confronted upon the witness-stand by long quotations from well known medica=
l text-books, and he=20

is asked whether the doctrines, opinions, etc., there laid down are sound. =
Especially is this done=20

when such doctrines and opinions are in apparent discord with his evidence =
as he gives it. In such=20

cases as this, however honest, however intelligent and non-partisan the wit=
ness may be (except=20

Petroma. The Petroma was a pair of stone tablets used by the Hierophants at=
 the Initiations,=20

during the final Mystery. In this lies concealed the secret of the Vatican =
claim to the seat of Peter.=20

As already quoted in _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 92:       In the Oriental countri=
es the designation Peter (in=20

Phoenician and     Chaldaic an interpreter), appears to have been the title=
 of this=20

personage.(227)   So far, and as the "interpreters" of _Neo_-Christianism, =
the Popes have most=20

undeniably the right to call themselves successors to the title of Peter, b=
ut hardly the successors=20

to, least of all the interpreters of, the doctrines of Jesus, the Christ; f=
or there considered partisan),=20

he is placed in a very difficult position. If the citations and questions a=
re from well-known authors,=20

and he is a modest man, as most men of learning are, it will be difficult f=
or him to deny that such=20

authorities as these have great weight, even more weight than his experienc=
e, skill, and=20

knowledge entitle him to claim. On the other hand, if he takes the bold cou=
rse and sticks to his=20

opinion, he is cried down the winds by counsel in summing him up, as a man =
of gall, boldness,=20

audacity and egotism. His course is difficult whichever way he turns, but m=
odesty as well as=20

honesty is usually the best policy. Perhaps the best thing for such a=20


_
and far purer than the Roman hierarchy, which, having ever faithfully held =
to the primitive=20

teachings of the Apostles, is known historically to have refused to follow =
the Latin seceders from=20

the original Apostolic Church, though, curiously enough, she is still refer=
red to by her Roman sister=20

as the "Schismatic" Church. It is useless to repeat the reasons for the sta=
tements above made, as=20

they may all be found in _Isis such circumstances is to do as once did the =
great mental alienist Dr.=20

John P. Gray, when, having given an opinion on a question of insanity, he w=

to the different theories from time to time prevalent as to what insanity w=
as, and having stated=20

what theories were then the accepted ones, he was confronted by counsel on =
his cross-

examination with the question: =E2=80=9CWhat do you think of Dr. John P. Gr=

where the words, Peter, Patar, and Pitar, are explained, and the origin of =
the "Seat of Pitah" is=20

shown. The reader will find upon referring to the above pages that an inscr=
iption was found on the=20

coffin of Queen Mentuhept of the Eleventh Dynasty (2250 B.C. according to B=
unsen), which in its=20

turn was shown to have been transcribed from the Seventeenth Chapter of the=
 _Book of the=20

Dead_, dating certainly not later than 4500 B.C. or 496 years before the Wo=
rld's Creation, in the=20

Genesiacal chronology. Nevertheless, Baron Bunsen shows the group of the qu=
ite extensive, of=20

many years before, in which he had advocated theories apparently different =
from those which he=20

had professed upon the witness-stand. Placed in this position, the distingu=
ished gentleman simply=20

replied: =E2=80=9CIt is true I cherished those theories at that time, but I=
 lived to learn better,=E2=80=9D thus=20

substantially disarming any criticism that could be made of him in his capa=
city as a witness in that=20

 saying that the record=20

(the true     interpretation) was at that time no longer intelligible.... W=

. Also causes of alleged=20
