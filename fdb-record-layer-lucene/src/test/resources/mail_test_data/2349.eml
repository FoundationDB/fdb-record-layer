reason of the relationship appears from another case in the same State, whe=

for a new trial the Court voluntarily refused to grant one for newly discov=

to it by a physician=E2=80=99s affidavit, on the ground that if the patient=
 should object in the new trial the=20

dow of the patient=20

cannot object to the disclosure, if his administrator with the will annexed=
 waives the privilege.[299]=20

In Michigan it has been said that the physician cannot avail himself of the=
 statute for his own=20

 one else can object to=20

the reception of the physician=E2=80=99s testimony.[302]  In New York it ha=

the law are to be dispensed alike to those familiar with and those ignorant=
 of its existence and=20

applicability, and it is therefore no reason to refuse its enforcement, tha=
