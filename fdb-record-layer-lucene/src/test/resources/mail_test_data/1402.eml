dracaena marginata nice cozy straw, I presently went to sleep, quite uninte=
ntionally. I must have slept some time, though it seemed to me but a very f=
ew minutes.  What woke me was a noise--a sharp suppressed yelp. It took me =
a moment to understand where I was, and why I was there. A sound of scuffli=
ng and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits, =
and I rushed out of wish you would not write with a typewriter. You don't k=
now how this affects a woman, or you wouldn't do it. However, I shall be so=
 glad to meet you now, as you suggest. Suppose we go to Maskelyne and Cook'=
s together to-morrow afternoon (Saturday). You know it isn't the Egyptian H=
all any more. It is in St. George's Hall, I think. But you will see it in t=

my head with a stone.=20

"D'ye see, now!" he demanded.  I saw.  "But a fox would bite you," I object=
ed.  "Let him bite," said=20

Tom. "I'll resk him when once I get these two bread-hooks on him. And he ca=
n't smell me through=20

the mouse-nests either."  That night we set ourselves to put the stratagem =
in operation. With the=20

dusk we stole out into the field where the stone-heaps were, and where we h=
ad oftenest heard=20

foxes bark. Selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars whi=
ch grew about a great=20

pine-stump, Tom lay down, and I covered him up hands openly, in the presenc=
e of Duncan Farll: a=20

flattering tribute to his personality. But the chief of Priam Farll's satis=
factions in that desolate hour=20

was that he had suppressed himself, that for the world he existed no more. =
I shall admit frankly=20

that this satisfaction nearly outweighed his grief. He sighed--and it was a=
 sigh of tremendous relief.=20

For now, by a miracle, he would be free from the menace of Lady Sophia Entw=
istle. Looking back=20

in calmness at the still recent Entwistle episode in Paris--the real origin=
ating cause of his sudden=20

flight to London--he was staggered by his latent capacity for downright, im=
pulsive=20


_
contents of the big basket. He then practiced squeaking and rustling severa=
l times to be sure that=20

all was in good trim. His squeaks were perfect successes--made by sucking t=
he air sharply betwixt=20

his teeth.  "Now be off," said Tom, "and don't come poking around, nor get =
in sight, till you hear me=20

holler."  Thus exhorted, I went into the barn and established myself at a c=
rack on the back side,=20

which looked out upon the field where Tom was ambushed.  Tom, meanwhile, as=
 he afterward told=20

me, waited till it had grown dark, then began his recklessness usually took=
 the form of making=20

himself agreeable to women whom he encountered in travel (he was much less =
shy with women=20

than with men). But to propose marriage to a weather-beaten haunter of hote=
ls like Lady Sophia=20

Entwistle, and to reveal his identity to her, and to allow her to accept hi=
s proposal--the thing had=20

been unimaginably inept!  And now he was free, for he was dead.  He was con=
scious of a chill in=20

the spine as he dwelt on the awful fate which he had escaped. He, a man of =
fifty, a man of set=20

habits, a man=20


_
attention of the fox when first he should come out into the clearing, for f=
oxes have ears so=20

wonderfully acute, that they are able to hear a mouse squeak twenty rods aw=
ay, it is said.  An hour=20

passed. Tom must have grown pretty tired of squeaking. It was a moonless ev=
ening, though not=20

very dark. I could see objects at a little distance through the crack, but =
could not see so far as the=20

stump. It got rather dull, watching there; and being the solid footwear of =
Lady Sophia Entwistle!=20

Yes, there was most decidedly a silver lining to the dark cloud of Leek's t=
ranslation to another=20

sphere of activity.  In replacing the pocket-book his hand encountered the =
letter which had arrived=20

for Leek in the morning. Arguing with himself whether he ought to open it, =
he opened it. It ran:=20

"Dear Mr. Leek, I am so glad to have your letter, and I think the photograp=
h is most gentlemanly.=20

But I do=20
