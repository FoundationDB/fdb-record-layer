dracaena marginata can thank me for getting him such a ducking," laughed Ruth.  "And who is he? Where does he come from?"  Ruth showed Mr. Cameron the stencil on the inside of the wallet.  "Isn't almost horror of the manner in which she regarded her own circumstances, to keep her silent. Even Edith, who would have dissolved the marriage arbitrarily, did not like to hear dracaena marginata can thank me for getting him such a ducking," laughed Ruth.  "And who is he?

Even Edith, who would have dissolved the marriage arbitrarily, did not like to hear _
when Ruth picked it up, for it was very flat. Certainly there was no money in it. Nor did there seem 

to be anything in it that would identify its owner. However, as Ruth carried it to the window she 

found a newspaper clipping tucked into one compartment, and, as it was damp, too, she took this 

out, unfolded it, and laid it carefully on the window sill to dry. But when she looked further, she saw 

inside the main compartment of the wallet a name and address stenciled, It was:  JONAS 

HATFIELD  SCARBORO, N. Y.  "Sec, Helen," she said to her chum. "Maybe this is his name--

Jonas Hatfield."  "And Scarboro, New York!" gasped Helen, suddenly. "Why, Ruthie!"  "What's the 

matter?" returned Ruth, in surprise.  "What a coincidence!"  "What is a coincidence?" demanded 

Ruth, still greatly amazed by her chum's excitement.  "Why this boy--if this is his wallet and that is 

his name and address--comes from right about where we are going to-morrow. Scarboro is the 

nearest railroad station to Snow Camp. What do you think of that?"  Before Ruth could reply, the 

sound of an automobile horn was heard outside, and both girls ran to the door. The Cameron 

automobile was just coming down the hill from the direction of Cheslow, and in a minute it stopped 

before the door of the Potter farmhouse.     CHAPTER III  THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING   The 

Red Mill was a grist mill, and Mr. Jabez Potter made wheat-flour, buckwheat, cornmeal, or ground 

any grist that was brought to him. Standing on a commanding knoll beside the Lumano River, it 

was very picturesquely situated, and the rambling old farmhouse connected with it was a very 

homey-looking place indeed.  The automobile had stopped at the roadside before the kitchen 

door, and Mr. Cameron alighted and started immediately up the straight path to the porch. He was 

a round, jolly, red-faced man, who was forever thinking of some surprise with which to please his 

boy and girl, and seldom refused any request they might make of him. This plan of taking a party 

of young folk into the backwoods for a couple of weeks was entirely to amuse Tom and Helen. 

Personally, the dry-goods merchant did not much care for such an outing.  He came stamping up 

the steps and burst into the kitchen in a jolly way, and Helen ran to him with a kiss.  "Hullo I what's 

all this?" he demanded, his black eyes taking in the grove of airing garments around the stove. 

"Tom been in the river? No! Those aren't Tom's duds, I'll be switched if they are!"  "No, no," cried 

Helen. "It's another boy."  And here Tom himself appeared from the have had hysterics; but that 

would be impossible to your daughter. When shall I be able to go away? I know: I will not go 

sooner than is right. I will do nothing I ought not to do;--but you could say my nerves are shattered, 

and that I want rest."  "And very truly, Carry," said Lady Lindores; "but we must know first what the 

will is. To be sure, your fortune is secured. You will be well off--better than any of us; but there 

may be regulations about the children--there may be conditions."  "Could the children be taken 

from me?" Carry said, but not with any active feeling; her powers of emotion were all concentrated 

on one thought. Lady Lindores, who was watching her with all a mother's anxious criticism, fearing 

to see any failure of right sentiment in her child, listened with a sensation of alarm. She had never 

been contented with herself in this particular. Carry's children had been too much the children of 

Pat Torrance to awaken the grandmother's worship, which she thought befitting, in her own heart. 

She felt a certain repulsion when she looked at these black-browed, light-eyed creatures, who 

were their father's in every feature--not Carry's at all. Was it possible that Carry, too, felt the 

same? But by-and-by Carry took up that little stolid girl on whom Lady Lindores could not place 

her tenderest affections, do what she would, and pressed her pale cheek against that undisturbed 

and solid little countenance. The child's face looked bigger than her mother's, Lady Lindores 



thought--the one all mind and feeling, the other all clay. She went and gave little Edith a kiss in her 

compunction and penitence for this involuntary dislike; but fortunately Carry herself was 

unconscious of it, and caressed her babies as if they were the most delicate and beautiful in the 

world.  Carry was not present at the reading of the will. She shrank from it, and no one insisted. 

There were father and brother to look after her interests. Rintoul was greatly shaken by the events 

of the day. He was ghastly pale, and very much excited and agitated. Whatever his sister might 

do, Rintoul certainly exhibited the truest sentiment. Nobody had given him credit for half so much 

feeling. He carried back his little nephew asleep after the long drive home, and thrust him into 

Carry's arms. "I am not much of a fellow," he said, stooping over her, with a voice full of emotion, 

"but I'll do a father's part to him, if I'm good enough for it, Carry." Carry by this time was quite calm, 

and wondered at this exhibition of feeling, at which Lady Lindores

"I thought Tom could keep out of the river when the ice was four inches thick--eh, son?" laughed 

Mr. Cameron.  His children began to tell him, both together, of the adventure with the bull and the 

mysterious appearance of the strange boy.  "Aye, aye!" he said. "And Ruth Fielding was in it, of 

course--and did her part in extricating you all from the mess, too, I'll be bound! Whatever would we 

do without Ruth?" and he smiled and shook hands with the miller's niece.  "I guess we were all 

equally scared. But it certainly was my fault that the old bull bunted the hollow stump into the 

creek. So this in her heart she wondered too, rejoicing that her inward rebellion against Torrance's 

children was not shared by her son. "Robin's heart was always in the right place," she said, with a 

warmth of motherly approval, which was not diminished by the fact that Rintoul's emotion made 

her still more conscious of the absence of "right feeling" in herself. There was not much 

conversation between the ladies in the small morning room to which they had withdrawn--a room 

which had never been used and had no associations. Carry, indeed, was very willing to talk; but 

her mother and sister did their best, with a
