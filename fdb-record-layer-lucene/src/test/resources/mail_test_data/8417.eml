There was plenty of the explosive on hand, for Mr. Swift had sent Tom a lar=
ge shipment. All this=20

while no word had come from Mr. Nestor, and Tom was beginning to think that=
 his prospective=20

father-in-law was very angry with him. Nor had Mary written.  Professor Bum=
per came and went as=20

he pleased, but his quest was regarded as hopeless now. Tom and his friends=
 had little time for=20

the bald-headed scientist, for they were too much interested in the success=
 of the big blast.  "Well,=20

we'll set her off to-morrow," Tom said one night, after a hard day's work. =
"The rocky wall is=20

honeycombed with explosive. If all goes well we ought to bring down enough =
rock to keep the=20

gangs busy night and day."  Everything was in readiness. What would the mor=
row bring--success=20

or failure?     Chapter XXIV  The Hidden City   Gathered beyond the mouth o=
f the tunnel, far=20

enough away so that the wind of the great blast would not bowl them over li=
ke ten pins, stood Tom=20

Swift and his friends. In his hand Tom held the battery box, the setting of=
 the switch in which would=20

complete the electrical circuit and set off the hundreds of pounds of explo=
sive buried deep in the=20

hard rock.  "Are all the men out?" asked the young inventor of Tim Sullivan=
, who had charge of this=20

important matter. Tim was in sole charge as foreman now, having picked up e=
nough of the Indian=20

language to get along without an interpreter.  "All out, sor," Tim responde=
d. "Yez kin fire whin=20

ready, Mr. Swift."  It was a portentous moment. No wonder Tom Swift hesitat=
ed.  In a sense he=20

and his friends, the contractors, had staked their all on a single throw. I=
f this blast failed it was not=20

likely that another would succeed, even if there should be time to prepare =
one.  The time limit had=20

almost expired, and there was still a half mile of hard rock between the la=
st heading and the=20

farther end of the big tunnel. If the blast succeeded enough rock might be =
brought down to enable=20

the work to go on, by using a night and day shift of men. Then, too, there =
was the chance that the=20

hard strata of rock would come to an end and softer stone, or easily-dug di=
rt, be encountered.=20

"Well, we may as well have it over with," said Tom in a low voice. Every on=
e was very quiet--

tensely quiet.  The young inventor looked up to see Professor Bumper observ=
ing him.  "Why,=20

Professor!" Tom exclaimed, "I thought you had gone off to the mountains aga=
in, looking for the lost=20

city."  "I am going, Tom, very soon. I thought I would stop and see the eff=
ect of your big blast. This=20

is my last trip. If I do not find the hidden city of Pelone this time, I am=
 going to give up."  "Give up!"=20

cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my fountain pen!"  "Oh, not altogether," went on th=
e bald-headed=20

scientist.  "I mean I will give up searching in this part of Peru, and go e=
lsewhere. But I will never=20

completely give up the search, for I am sure the hidden city exists somewhe=
re under these=20

mountains," and he looked off toward the snow-covered peaks of the Andes.  =
Tom looked at the=20

battery box. He drew a long breath, and said:  "Here she goes!"  There was =
a contraction of his=20

hand as he pressed the switch over, and then, for perhaps a half second, no=
thing happened. Just=20

for an instant Tom feared something had gone wrong that the electric curren=
t had failed, or that=20

the wires had become disconnected--perhaps through some action of the plott=
ing rivals.  And then,=20

gently at first, but with increasing intensity, the solid ground on which t=
hey were all standing=20

seemed to rock and sway, to heave itself up, and then sink down.  "Bless my=
--" began Mr. Damon,=20

but he got no further, for a mighty gust of wind swept out of the tunnel, a=
nd blew off his hat. That=20

gust was but a gentle breeze, though, compared to what followed. For there =
came such a rush of=20

air that it almost blew over those standing near the opening of the great s=
haft driven under the=20

mountain. There was a roar as of Niagara, a howling as in the Cave of the W=
inds, and they all=20

bent to the blast.  Then followed a dull, rumbling roar, not as loud as mig=
ht have been expected,=20



but awful in its intensity. Deep down under the very foundations of the ear=
th it seemed to rumble.=20

"Run! Run back!" cried Tom Swift. "There's a back-draft and the powder gas =
is poisonous. Stoop=20

down and run back!"  They understood what he meant. The vapor from the powd=
er was deadly if=20

breathed in a confined space. Even in the open it gave one a terrible heada=
che. And Tom could=20

see floating out of the tunnel the first wisps of smoke from the fired expl=
osive. It was lighter than=20

air, and would rise. Hence the necessity, as in a smoke-filled room, of kee=
ping low down where=20

the air is purer.  They all rushed back, stooping low. Mr. Damon stumbled a=
nd fell, but Koku picked=20

him up and, tucking him under one arm, as he might have done a child, the g=
iant followed Tom to=20

a place of safety.  "Well, Tom, it went off all right," said Mr. Job Titus,=
 as they stood among the=20

shacks of the workmen and watched the smoke pouring out of the tunnel mouth=
.  "Yes, it went off.=20

But did it do the work? That's what we've got to find out."  They waited im=
patiently for the deadly=20

vapor to clear out of the tunnel. It was more than an hour before they dare=
d venture in, and then it=20

was with smarting eyes and puckered throats. But the atmosphere was quickly=
 clearing.  "Switch=20

on the lights," cried Tom to Tim, for the illuminating current had been cut=
 off when the blast was=20

fired. "Let's see what we've brought down."  Following the eager young inve=
ntor came the=20

contractors, some of the white workers, Mr. Damon and Professor Bumper.  Th=
e little scientist said=20

he would like to see the effect of the big blast.  Along they stumbled over=
 pieces of rock, large and=20

small.  "Some force to it," observed Job Titus, as he observed pieces of ro=
ck close to the mouth of=20

the tunnel. "If it only exerted the force the other way, against the face o=
f the rock, as well as back=20

this way, we'll be all right."  "The greater force was in the opposite dire=
ction," Tom said.  A big=20

search-light had been got ready to flash on the place where the blast had b=
een set off. This was to=20

enable them to see how much rock had been torn away. And, as they reached t=
he place where the=20

flint-like wall had been, they saw a strange sight.  "Bless my strawberry s=
hort-cake!" gasped Mr.=20

Damon. "What a hole!"  "It is a hole," admitted Tom, in a low voice. "A big=
ger hole than I dared=20

hope for."  For a great cave, seemingly, had been blown in the face of the =
rock wall that had=20

hindered the progress of the tunnel.  A great black void confronted them.  =
"Shift the light over this=20

way," called Tom to Walter Titus, who was operating it. "I can't see anythi=
ng."  The great beam of=20

light flashed into the void, and then a murmur of awe came from every throa=
t.  For there, revealed=20

in the powerful electrical rays, was what seemed to be a long tunnel, high =
and wide, as smooth as=20

a paved street. And on either side of it were what appeared to be buildings=
, some low, others=20

taller. And, branching off from the main tunnel, or street, were other pass=
ages, also lined with=20

buildings, some of which had crumbled to ruins.  "Bless my dictionary!" cri=
ed Mr. Damon. "What is=20

it?"  Professor Bumper had crawled forward over the mass of broken rock. He=
 gazed as if=20

fascinated at what the searchlight showed, and then he cried:  "I have foun=
d it! I have found it! The=20

hidden city of Pelone!"     Chapter XXV  Success   Had it not been for Tom =
Swift, the excited=20

professor would have rushed pellmell over the jagged pile of rocks into the=
 great cave which had=20

been opened by the blast, the cave in which the scientist declared was the =
lost city for which he=20

had been searching. But the young inventor grasped Mr. Bumper by the arm.  =
"Better wait a bit,"=20

Tom suggested. "There may be powder gas in there. Some of it must have blow=
n forward."  "I=20

don't care!" excitedly cried the professor. "That is the hidden city! I'm s=
ure of it! I within whose=20

walls was a population of 4000 souls.  The garrison consisted of the braves=
t men the French could=20

furnish, veterans of many battlefields.  The Commandant was Drucour.  But i=
t was in vain now that=20



the French defended their splendid fortress.  After an heroic defence, Druc=
our was at last obliged=20

to surrender, and all the garrison were sent to England as prisoners of war=
.  Louisburg would give=20

the English trouble and anxiety no more.  As if it were but a tiny sandcast=
le built by children on the=20

seashore, these mighty stone bastions were swept away.  After the surrender=
 the English soldiers=20

were ordered to the duty of destroying the stronghold of France in Cape Bre=
ton, pulling it to pieces=20

with pickaxe and crowbar, filling the crevices with gunpowder, until at las=
t hardly a vestige=20

remained. If you ask to see Louisburg to-day, you will be shown only a roll=
ing meadow upon which=20

sheep graze peacefully.  Wolfe was now eager to push on to Quebec, but he h=
ad to wait nearly a=20

year.  In the meantime the French had triumphed on Lake Champlain. General =
Abercrombie had=20

tried to take Fort Ticonderoga with 15,000 men, but Abercrombie was no such=
 soldier as James=20

Wolfe.  He had, however, with him Lord Howe, a brave and able young officer=
, who was the=20

second in command.  Had not a stray bullet struck him down on his way to th=
e battlefield, the story=20

of Ticonderoga might have had a different ending.  He {210} was beloved and=
 trusted by his=20

soldiers, and when he died their courage seemed to die away also.  Abercrom=
bie foolishly thought=20

that by his superior numbers he could force Ticonderoga without cannon, but=
 Montcalm knew his=20

strength.  He was surprised when he saw the English general hurling his sol=
diers in four strong=20

columns upon the front of his fort.  It was a battle in which superior numb=
ers, bravery, and=20

perseverance were thrown away. Six times did the English doggedly come on, =
and six times did=20

the cannon of the French sow carnage amongst them.  There was a regiment of=
 Highlanders=20

fighting like tigers, some of them hacking the wooden stocks of the outpost=
s with their claymores=20

until a cannon-ball carried away their limbs.  When at last, at the close o=
f that long bloody day,=20

Abercrombie drew off his troops, he left 2000 English corpses in the glacis=
 outside the walls of the=20

French fort.  Was it strange that the hearts of the survivors turned agains=
t him? that they did not=20

conceal their rejoicing when the King, after this fearful defeat, relieved =
Abercrombie of his=20

command?  It was not, however, all a tale of repulses and humiliation for t=
he English.  Colonel=20

Bradstreet had crossed Lake Ontario and captured Fort Frontenac.  General F=
orbes had made the=20

French abandon Fort Duquesne.  On its site a new stronghold arose, to which=
 the name of Fort=20

Pitt was given.  Here in our day is the great and flourishing city of Pitts=
burg.  This was not all.  In=20

the spring of the fateful year 1759, Fort Niagara fell.  {211}  The news of=
 the capture of Louisburg,=20

which caused such rejoicings in America and England, cast a terrible gloom =
over French Canada.=20

Quebec, that splendid stronghold which had defied the English, was now thei=
r last hope.  The=20

town and citadel on the summit of Cape Diamond which Champlain had founded =
and Frontenac=20

guarded so well, seemed to laugh at cannon and bayonet.  Stern was the task=
 set before the man=20

who should presume to scale those heights and force the proud city to surre=
nder.  Behind its=20

confident aspect Quebec was the scene of despair and corruption.  Amongst t=
he officials reckless=20

extravagance reigned.  While Canada's fate was trembling in the balance, th=
e Intendant Bigot,=20

who should have been a pattern to the community, spent his nights in riot a=
nd gambling.  Although=20

the King had forbidden games of hazard, Bigot would often play amongst a pa=
rty of forty people,=20

losing many thousands of francs in a few hours.  The King sent out his gold=
 to help Canada, the=20

people crushed by taxation gave theirs, but all the money found its way int=
o the pocket of Bigot=20

and his accomplices.  Provisions and clothing that should have gone to the =
hungry, shivering=20

French soldiers were sold at La Friponne to reap a profit. Distant forts he=
ld bravely for the French=20



cried aloud for succour, but the scoundrelly Intendant put them off with ex=
cuses, and the money=20

intended for them was devoted to gaming and dissipation.  In two years alon=
e Bigot's robberies=20

amounted to nearly a million pounds sterling.  A time of retribution was at=
 hand.  Montcalm wept at=20

the vices and irregularities around him, but, {212} being only military com=
mander, he could do little=20

or nothing.  The Governor, De Vaudreuil, answered his warnings haughtily, f=
or he was jealous of=20

Montcalm.  So the end approached.  Never had England sent out an army so fu=
ll of zeal, courage,=20

and discipline as the army which sailed away from her shores under Wolfe to=
 take Quebec.  Their=20

commander well knew that he had to attack one of the strongest forts in the=
 world, defended by all=20

the soldiers that Montcalm could muster, fighting in defence of their count=
ry, their flag, and their=20

religion.  Wolfe had only 9000 men against the 18,000 French Canadians, but=
 he rejoiced in his=20

Englishmen.  "If valour could make amends for want of numbers," he wrote to=
 Pitt, "we shall=20

succeed."  On the first day of June 1759, the ships sailed out of the harbo=
ur of Halifax for the river=20

St. Lawrence.  The harbour rang with the cheers of the soldiers, and the ba=
nds struck up the old=20

melody "The Girl I left behind Me."  When they reached the mighty river the=
y ran great danger for=20

want of a pilot.  A French prisoner on board began wringing his hands, decl=
aring that they would=20

all go to the bottom. An old British captain of a transport laughed in his =
face: "I will show you," he=20

roared with an oath, "that an Englishman shall go where a Frenchman dare no=
t show his nose."=20

And he steered his ship through in safety.  The boast was no empty one.  Va=
udreuil wrote to=20

France to say "that the enemy have passed sixty ships of war where we dare =
not risk a vessel of=20

100 tons by night or day."  In Quebec, Montcalm during the long days of {21=
3} early summer=20

awaited the coming of the English.  Not a man was idle.  Drilling and build=
ing of earthworks filled=20

up nearly every hour of the day. Montcalm's 18,000 men were as strongly ent=
renched as Nature=20

and the art of war could make them.  On the 27th of June the French in Queb=
ec snatched their=20

first glimpse of the masts of the English battleships. A few hours later th=
e English fleet had halted=20

before the Isle of Orleans, and Wolfe and his red-coated infantry landed on=
 its shores. Mounting=20

the point of land to the west, the young general took out a telescope and t=
urned it towards the=20

heights of Quebec, four miles away.  As he scanned the mighty rock he felt =
that it was indeed a=20

hard task which England had sent him to accomplish.  Vaudreuil did not wait=
 for the English=20

commander to make the first move; he attempted to destroy the English fleet=
 with fire-ships.  One=20

dark night a number of old vessels, filled with pitch, gunpowder, bombs, an=
d antique cannon,=20

packed to the muzzle, were towed out into the channel and set on fire to fl=
oat to the English fleet.=20

The whole countryside seemed to burst in lurid flames, and a hail of grapes=
hot and bullets flew in=20

all directions.  But the English soldiers were not frightened; they rowed o=
ut in their boats, grappling=20

courageously with the flaming monsters, and towed them to shore.  Vaudreuil=
's explosive=20

experiments proved a total failure.  During that very night Wolfe was busy =
with pen and paper=20

writing his first manifesto to the Canadian people.  "We are sent by King G=
eorge," he said, "to=20

conquer this province, but not to make war upon women and {214} children, t=
he ministers of=20

religion, or industrious people.  We lament the sufferings which our invasi=
on may inflict upon you,=20

but if you remain neutral we proffer=20


_
it!"  "There'll be plenty of time," said Tom. "It isn't going to run away. =
Wait until I make a test Tim,=20

hand me one of those torches."  Some torches of a very inflammable wood wer=
e used to test for=20

the presence of the deadly smoke-gas. Lighting one of these, Tom tossed it =
into the big=20

excavation.  It fell to the stone floor--to the stone street to be more exa=
ct--and, flaring up brightly,=20

further revealed the rows of houses as they stood, silent and uninhabited. =
 "It's all right," Tom=20

announced. "There's no danger so long as the torch burns. You can go on, Pr=
ofessor."  And=20

Professor Bumper rushed forward, scrambling over the pile of blasted rock, =
followed by Tom and=20

the others. Some of the debris from the explosion had fallen into the cave,=
 and was scattered for=20

some distance along the main street of what had been Pelone. But beyond tha=
t the way was clear.=20

"Yes, it is Pelone," cried Professor Bumper. "See!"  He pointed to inscript=
ions in queer characters=20

over the doorway of some of the houses, but he alone could read them.  "I h=
ave found Pelone!" he=20

kept repeating over and over again.  And that is just what had happened. Th=
at last great blast Tom=20

Swift had set off had broken down the rock wall that hid the lost city from=
 view. There it was,=20

buried deep down under the mountain, where it had been covered from sight a=
ges ago by some=20

mighty earthquake or landslide; perhaps both. And the earth and rocks had f=
allen over the main=20

portion of the city of Pelone in such a way--in such an arch formation--tha=
t the greater part of it=20

was preserved from the pressure of the mountain above it.  The outlying por=
tions were crushed=20

into dust by the awful pressure of the mountain--millions of tons of stone-=
-but where the natural=20

arch had formed the weight was kept off the buildings, most of which religi=
on.  We are masters of=20

the river; no succour can reach you from France; General Amherst with a lar=
ge army has sailed to=20

the southern frontier.  Your cause is hopeless, your valour useless.  Your =
nation has been guilty of=20

great cruelties to our unprotected settlers, but we seek no revenge, we off=
er you the sweets of=20

peace with the honours of war.  England in her strength will befriend you; =
France in her weakness=20

leaves you to your fate."  But although the English commander spoke so conf=
idently, he had many=20

misgivings in his heart. If Amherst did not get through to Montreal and dow=
n the St. Lawrence by=20

the autumn, it meant the winter would be lost, and where was he to find foo=
d for his troops?  How=20

could he face amidst the snow and ice the 18,000 men of Montcalm, as brave =
and as hardy as his=20

own?  Victory was only to be won by quick and vigorous action.  Seizing the=
 heights of Point Lvis=20

opposite Quebec, Wolfe set up his batteries so as to bombard the city.  He =
planted a large force=20

on the north bank of the river St. Lawrence, near the Falls of Montmorency,=
 leaving some=20

regiments encamped on the Isle of Orleans.  Fleet and army now only waited =
a given signal to=20

attack the city.  On board the fleet were some, as yet unknown, officers, w=
ho were destined to rise=20

to great fame in the world.  A young midshipman there was, named Jervis, wh=
o became the great=20

English Admiral Earl St. Vincent.  Palliser {215} too, who figures in histo=
ry as Admiral Sir Hugh=20

Palliser, was on board the frigate _Mercury_.  On another vessel was Robiso=
n, destined to be a=20

noted Professor of Science in Edinburgh, and the partner of James Watt, inv=
entor of the steam-

engine.  The humble sailing master of the _Mercury_ was none other than Jam=
es Cook, who=20

became the most famous scientific navigator that ever=20


_
perfect as they had been before the cataclysm came.  The buildings were of =
stone block=20

construction, mostly only one story in height, though some were two. They w=
ere simply made,=20

somewhat after the fashion of the Aztecs. A look into some of them by the l=
ight of portable electric=20

lamps showed that the houses were furnished with some degree of taste and l=
uxury. There were=20

traces of an ancient civilization.  But of the inhabitants, there was not a=
 trace: either they had fled=20

before the earthquake or the volcanic eruption had engulfed the city, or th=
e countless centuries=20

had turned their very of England.  Quickly did the fire of the English ship=
s, joined to that of the=20

batteries, work destruction upon the outer walls of the grim fortress.  In =
the lower town the=20

buildings were soon reduced to ruins, and even in the upper town many dange=
rous fires broke out.=20

Indeed, before the siege was brought to a close, more than 500 buildings fe=
ll a prey to the flames,=20

including public and private structures, the Cathedral and other churches. =
 Yet while the summer=20

wore away, in spite of Wolfe's terrible bombardment, Montcalm played a wait=
ing game.  Wolfe was=20

in despair.  By the end of July=20


_
"Oh, what a find! What a find!" murmured Professor Bumper.  "I shall be fam=
ous! And so will you,=20

Tom Swift. For it was your blast that revealed the lost city of Pelone. You=
r name will be honored by=20

every archeological society in the world, and all will be eager to make you=
 an honorary member."=20

"That's all very nice," said Tom, "but what pleases me better is that this =
tunnel is a success."=20

"Success!" cried Mr. Damon. "I should call it a failure, Tom Swift. Why, yo=
u've run smack into an=20

old city, and you'll have either to curve the tunnel to one side, or start =
a new one."  "Nothing of the=20

sort!" laughed Tom. "Don't you see? The tunnel comes right up to the main s=
treet of Pelone. And=20

the street is as straight as a die, and just the width and height of the tu=
nnel. All we will have to do=20

will be to keep on blasting away, where the main street comes to an end, an=
d our tunnel will be=20

finished.  The street is over half a mile long, I should judge, and we'll s=
ave all that blasting. The=20

tunnel will be finished in time!"  "So it will!" cried Job Titus. Quebec wa=
s shattered away by his=20

cannon-balls, and still the French commander could not be drawn out to a ba=
ttle; so the=20

Englishman decided to attack the enemy at close quarters, just on the other=
 side of the river=20

Montmorency.  But a fierce repulse awaited him; 12,000 French soldiers pour=
ed a storm of bullets=20

against the brave grenadiers, who tried to get a footing on the river slope=
s.  They were beaten=20

back, 500 of Wolfe's best troops having fallen in the fatal charge.  Wolfe =
fretted with impatience;=20

he knew the time was precious.  If he could only draw Montcalm out to battl=
e!  But Montcalm was=20

wise; he refused to be drawn.  {216}  "You may destroy the town," came the =
French message=20

under the flag of truce, "but you will never get inside it."  "I will take =
Quebec," replied Wolfe, "if I=20

stay here until November."  One plan only now remained: it was to creep up =
in the night and scale=20

the heights.  It was a desperate move, but the only one that remained that =
offered a chance of=20

success.  In the midst of his plans the young English commander fell=20


_
hidden city as part of the tunnel."  "Use the street all you like," said Mr=
. Bumper, "but leave the=20

houses to me. They are a perfect mine of ancient lore and information. At l=
ast I have found it! The=20

ancient, hidden city of Pelone, spoken of on the Peruvian tablets, of gold.=
"  The story of the=20

discoveries the scientist made in Pelone is an enthralling one. But this is=
 a story of Tom Swift and=20

his big tunnel, and no place for telling of the archeological discoveries. =
 Suffice it to say that=20

Professor Bumper, though he found no gold, for which the contractors hoped,=
 made many curious=20

finds in the ancient houses. He came upon traces of a strange civilization,=
 though he could find no=20

record of what had caused the burial of Pelone beneath the mountains. He wr=
ote many books=20

about his discovery, giving Tom Swift due credit for uncovering the place w=
ith the mighty blast.=20

Other scientists came in flocks, and for a time Pelone was almost as busy a=
 place as it had been=20

originally.  Even when the tunnel was completed and trains ran through it, =
the scientists kept on=20

with their work of classifying what they found. An underground station was =
built on the main street=20

of the old city, and visitors often wandered through the ancient houses, wh=
erein was the bone-dust=20

of the dead and gone people.  But to go back to the story of Tom Swift. Tom=
's surmise was right.=20

He and the contractors were able to use the main street of Pelone as part o=
f their tunnel, and a=20

good half mile of blasting through solid rock was saved. The flint came to =
an end at the extremity=20

of Pelone, and the last part of the tunnel had only to be dug through sand-=
stone and soft dirt, an=20

easy undertaking.  So the big bore was finished on time--ahead of time in f=
act, and Titus Brothers=20

received from Senor Belasdo, the Peruvian representative, a large bonus of =
money, in which Tom=20

Swift shared.  "So our rivals didn't balk us after all," said Walter Titus,=
 "though they tried mighty=20

hard."  The big tunnel was finished--at least Tom Swift's work on it. All t=
hat remained to do was to=20

clear away the debris and lay the connecting rails. Tom and Mr. Damon prepa=
red to go back=20

home. The latter's work was done. As for Professor Bumper, nothing could ta=
ke him from Pelone.=20

He said he was going to live there, and, practically, he did.  Tom, Koku an=
d Mr. Damon returned to=20

Lima, thence to go to Callao to take the steamer for San Francisco. One day=
 the manager of the=20

hotel spoke to them.  "You are Americans, are you not?" he asked.  "Yes," a=
nswered Tom. "Why?"=20

constitution, ever struggling with sickness.  Days elapsed, but his heroic =
spirit conquered, and on=20

the 11th of September the English troops were directed to be ready to land =
and attack the enemy.=20

While a portion of the troops made a feint to the eastward to disguise Wolf=
e's intentions from the=20

enemy, Wolfe and his troops drifted up stream with the tide.  When the tide=
 began to ebb, boats=20

full of soldiers were cast off, reaching in safety a little cove three mile=
s above Quebec.  In the first=20

boat to land was the young general himself, who, as the oarsmen plied their=
 muffled oars,=20

murmured softly to his officers, the famous lines in Gray's _Elegy_:--    T=
he boast of heraldry, the=20

pomp of power,     And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,   Await =
alike the inevitable hour--=20

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.   "Gentlemen," said Wolfe, "I wou=
ld rather have written=20

those lines than take Quebec."  As the boat's prow touched the shore, the s=
entinel's {217}=20

challenge rang out in the darkness, "Qui vive."  To hesitate was to be lost=
. Instantly a Scotch=20

captain, who spoke French perfectly, answered, "La France!"  "A quel rgimen=
t?"  "De la Heine,"=20

replied the Highlander boldly.  His quickness averted a calamity.  The sent=
ry was satisfied; his=20

comrades had been expecting provision boats from Montreal, and he thought t=
hey had arrived.=20

Sentry after sentry was passed by Wolfe and his men with the same result.  =
Up the dread heights=20

the English soldiers clambered.  Day was just dawning when they reached the=
 top.  They could=20



see a cluster of French tents close at hand, and, dashing forward, they cap=
tured their occupants.=20

This was the first outpost.  The victors' huzzas rang out, and at this sign=
al all Wolfe's red-coated=20

battalions began climbing the cliffs, and soon joined their companions on t=
he top. Their eyes=20

beheld a great plain stretched out.  In the early days of the colony Master=
 Abraham Martin had=20

owned this tract of ground, which he had planted with corn.  The people cal=
led it the Plains of=20

Abraham, and Wolfe now chose it for his battlefield. On one side of him was=
 the garrison of=20

Quebec, startled by hearing of his mad adventure; on the opposite side was =
another French army=20

under Bougainville; behind was the edge of the steep cliff and the river.  =
Montcalm, deceived by=20

the firing of the English fleet, was far away. But at six o'clock he mounte=
d and galloped thither as=20

fast as his horse would carry {218} him.  Two miles away he could discern t=
he red ranks of the=20

British soldiers.=20


_
and he is dying. He has no friends, he says.  Perhaps--"  "Of course we'll =
do what we can for him,"=20

said Tom, impulsively. "Where is he?"  With Mr. Damon he entered the room w=
here the dying man=20

lay. He had caught a fever, the hotel manager said, and could not  "This is=
 a serious business," he=20

said coolly, riding over the bridge of the St. Charles to gather his troops=
 for the fray.  Fervently=20

they rallied at his command, never doubting but that they would sweep Wolfe=
 and his men wholly=20

from the heights.  The eyes of the=20
