philodendron monstera the help of my knowledge and my writings.  5. In my f=
irst book, I have said what I had to say about the functions of architectur=
e and the scope of the art, as well as about fortified towns and the apport=
ionment of building sites within the fortifications. Although it would next=
 be in order to explain the proper proportions and symmetry of temples and =
public buildings, as well as of private distance.  Reader, we re-echo the s=
entiment, and close our tale with the remark that there are many rescued me=
n and women in London who shall have cause, as long as life shall last, to =
pray for a blessing on the overwrought heroes who fill the ranks, and fight=
 the battles of the Red Brigade.       End of Project Gutenberg's Life in t=
