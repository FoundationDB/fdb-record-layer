philodendron monstera belongs to the Indians," "La tierra es de los Yndios,=
" is a common remark, even amongst the lower orders. Moral or political inj=
ustice seldom fails to recoil on the head of the oppressor; and when the go=
vernment of Manila allowed an indiscriminate massacre and pillage of Europe=
an foreigners by the mob, and by their shameful lenity gave a tacit sanctio=
n to it, they taught the Indian, that he might with equal impunity attack t=
hem. The plunder then obtained is a transit of Venus; but one swallow--nor =
a flock of them--cannot make a summer.  Barometric observations have been d=
ragged into the combat. The great Lisbon earthquake, and the convulsion in =
Calabria, were preceded by low barometer. Similar observations have been ma=
de in this century. The constantly recurring shocks of 1855-56 were in each=
 case preceded by fall of barometers. But Humboldt, in South America, and E=
