later there came a knock on their door, and the voice of Martin, the monito=
r, asked:  "Ranger, are=20

you in bed?"  "Yes," replied our hero.  "Anderson, are you in bed?"  "Yes, =
Martin."  "Humph! I=20

thought I heard voices in your room."  Jack replied with a snore, and the m=
onitor passed on.  "You=20

fellows had better take a sneak," whispered Jack, when Martin's footsteps h=
ad died away. "He's=20

watching this room, and he may catch you."  The outsiders thought this was =
good advice, and=20

soon Nat and Jack were left alone.  "Did you mean that about a gun club?" a=
sked Nat.  "Sure,"=20

replied his chum, "but we'll talk about it to-morrow. Better go to sleep. M=
artin will be sneaking=20

around."  Jack was up early the next morning, and went down to the lake for=

breakfast. As he approached the float, where he kept his boat, he saw a stu=
dent standing there.=20

"That looks like the new chap--Will Williams," he mused. "I'll ask him to g=
o for a row."  He=20

approached the new lad, and was again struck by a peculiar look of sadness =
on his face.  "Good-

morning," said Jack pleasantly. "My name is Ranger. Wouldn't you like to go=
 for a row?"  Will=20

Williams turned and looked at Jack for several seconds without speaking. He=
 did not seem to have=20

heard what was said.  "Perhaps he's a trifle deaf," thought Jack, and he as=
ked again more loudly:=20

"Wouldn't you like to go for a row?"  "I don't row," was the answer, rather=
 snappily given.  "Well, I=20

guess I can manage to row both of us," was our hero's reply.  "No, I'm not =
fond of the water."=20

"Perhaps you like football or baseball better," went on Jack, a little puzz=
led. "We have a good=20

eleven."  "I'm not allowed to play football."  "Maybe you'd like to go for =
a walk," persisted Jack, who=20

had the kindest heart in the world, and who felt sorry for the lonely new b=
oy. "I'll show you around.=20

I understand you just came."  "Yes; I arrived yesterday morning."  "Would y=
ou like to take a walk? I=20

don't know but what I'd just as soon do that as row."  "No, I--I don't care=
 for walking."  The lad=20

turned aside and started away from the lake, without even so much as thanki=
ng Jack for his effort=20

to make friends with him.  "Humph!" mused Jack as he got into his boat. "Yo=
u certainly are a=20

queer customer. Just like a snail, you go in your house and walk off with i=
t. There's something=20

wrong about you, and I'm going to find out what it is. Don't like rowing, d=
on't like walking, afraid of=20

 Dock, I'm glad to=20

 when his boating=20

rival was walking down the campus. "You had quite a time of it."  "Yes," ad=
mitted Snaith, "I got a=20

nasty bump on the head. Say, Ranger, I haven't had a chance to thank you fo=
r pulling me out. I'm=20

much obliged to you."  "Oh, that's all right. Don't mention it," answered J=
ack. "If I hadn't done it,=20

some one else would."  "Well, I'm glad you did. But say, I still think I ca=
n beat you rowing. Want to=20

try it again?"  "I won't mind, when you think you're well enough."  "Oh, I'=
