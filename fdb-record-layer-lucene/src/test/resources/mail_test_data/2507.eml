philodendron monstera the case reckoned without his host!  For two whole da=
ys Jackson waited in his office for Skinner to appear--waited in vain.  He =
dreaded going home to dinner, dreaded formula number two.  Each night he ha=

stion aside as petty, shirking.  However, nothing was said at dinner by the=
 good Mrs. Curmudgeon, and Jackson beckoned to Beaufort to come in. "I am g=

you will come with me. Mr Granger, this is my friend Mr Beaufort, an Englis=

Glibly the clerk recounted to Jackson all he knew about their guest, who ha=
d suddenly become=20

illustrious through the magic touch of the J. Matthews Wilkinsons.  "Point =
him out to me," said=20

Jackson.  "I always like to look over these Eastern guys that know so much =
that ain't so about us=20

Middle West people."  "The Skinners don't get down to breakfast before ten,=

hour later Jackson strolled in casually and took a chair opposite the desk.=
  Here was an=20

opportunity for the clerk, an opportunity which Jackson had arranged for hi=
m without his knowing=20

it.  He passed around from behind the desk and intercepted Skinner as he an=
d Honey were about=20

to step into the elevator.  "Mr. Skinner," he said, "I'd like you to meet o=
ne of our prominent=20

citizens."  He led Skinner over to where the curmudgeon was sitting. "Mr. S=
kinner, I want you to=20

shake hands with Mr. Willard Jackson."  "How do you do, Mr. Skinner?" said =
Jackson, rather=20

reservedly; for now that the game was going the way he had designed it shou=
ld go, he wanted to=20

make it appear that the clerk, and not he, had taken the initiative.  "I'm =
very glad to meet you, Mr.=20

Jackson," said Skinner, with his accustomed cordiality.  "I saw your little=
 squib in the paper," said=20

Jackson.  "You must belong to the Boost Club."  "It never does any harm to =
tell pleasant truths,"=20

said Skinner.  see how it could bear even such a verdict as that. There is =
no occasion for=20

unnecessary alarm. Anything more is impossible."  At this moment Rolls came=
 in; his countenance=20

was lightened, yet excited. "There is one--that would like to speak to you,=
 sir," he said.  There=20

could be no doubt as to what the summons was. Rolls lingered behind when hi=
s master, with=20

changing colour, but self-possession, left the room. He came up to Beaufort=
 stealthily. "Sir," he=20

said--"sir, will _yon_ be all true?"  "What? Neither Mr Erskine nor myself =
is in the habit of saying=20

what is not true."  "That's no doubt the case. I'm saying nothing of him; b=
ut you might have=20

smoothed it off a bit, just to soothe him. Will it be all exact yon you sai=
d about manslaughter?=20

Manslaughter is just culpable homicide, so far as I can see. And what's the=
 punishment for=20

manslaughter (as you call it), if you'll be so kind as say?"  "That depends=
 on the gravity of the=20

case, on the character of the judge, on many things. A year's, two years' i=
mprisonment--perhaps=20

only a month or two. I have known it but a day."  "And previous character w=
ould be taken into=20

account?" said Rolls; "and aggravation, and--many a thing more?"  "No doubt=
; it is a thing upon=20

which no certain rule can be observed. It may be next to no harm at all, or=
 it may be close upon=20

murder. In such a case as this, severity=20


_
see."  "You know them?"  "Why, yes.  I'm Willard Jackson."  "Oh, yes," laug=
hed Skinner, "how=20

stupid of me.  Of course I know. Certainly I know."  He caught Jackson's co=
at and drew him over=20

and added confidentially, "I'm a little bit abstracted.  You see, this is a=
 kind of junketing expedition.=20

Just what they said in the paper--a belated honeymoon.  I've never had a ch=
ance before, and I'm=20

devoting my whole time to giving the wife a good time."  He pulled out his =
watch. "Say, you'll=20

excuse me.  We've got a date."  "Of course," said Jackson.  Skinner grasped=
 Jackson's hand=20

cordially.   "But it will make a pairting," said Rolls, solemnly, "atween h=
im and all he maist cares=20

for. I'm no' of the young maister's mind myself. There are some would have =
set him far better, and=20

in every way more suitable; but what a man likes himself, it's that will pl=
ease him, and no' what=20

another man likes. It takes us a' a lang time," said Rolls, shaking his hea=
d, "to learn that. Many's=20

the one in my place would think here's just a grand opportunity to pairt hi=
m and--them; but you see=20

I take his ain wishes into consideration."  The old servant spoke less to B=
eaufort than to himself;=20

but=20


_
and have a chat?  I'm awfully glad to have met you."  "Well, I'll be jigger=
ed," said Jackson to=20

himself as he left The Hotel. Anyhow, he reflected, as he walked downtown t=
o his office, he'd=20

taken the first step, he'd broken the ice.  It had gone against the grain t=
o do it, but it was entirely=20

on the wife's account.  He'd let Skinner take the next step.  He'd be darne=
d if _he_ would.  But as=20

usual was not accustomed to hold such colloquies with a family butler. He s=
tared, then grew=20

impatient, and disposed to resent the old fellow's familiarity. The next mo=
ment the bell rang, and=20

Rolls hurried away. Beaufort followed him out into the hall, where a man wa=
s standing evidently on=20

guard. John was at the door of the drawing-room, pale, but perfectly compos=
ed. "The dogcart=20

immediately," he said to=20
