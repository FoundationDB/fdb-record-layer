dare raise a hand against, in single combat--Deadwood Dick, Road-Agent Prince, and the one 

person whose name is in everybody's mouth.  Straight on through the single northerly street of the 

infant village ride the dauntless band, making weirdly beautiful music with their rollicking song, 

some of the voices being cultivated, and clear as the clarion note.  A few miners, wakened from 

their repose, jump out of bed, come to the door, and stare at the receding cavalcade in a dazed 

sort of way. Others, thinking that the noise is all resulting from an Indian attack, seize rifles or 

revolvers, as the case may be, and blaze away out of windows and loopholes at whatever may be 

in the way to receive their bullets.  But the road-agents only pause a moment in their song to send 

back a wild, sarcastic laugh; then they resume it, and merrily dash along up the gulch, the ringing 

of explained his idea to Mr. Joseph P. Knapp, now the president of the American Lithograph 

Company.  "I'll give you ten dollars apiece if you will write me a one-hundred-word biography of 

one hundred famous Americans," was Mr. Knapp's instant reply.  "Send me a list, and group them, 

as, for instance: presidents and vice-presidents, famous soldiers, actors, authors, etc."  "And 

thus," says Mr. Knapp, as he tells the tale today, "I gave Edward Bok his first literary commission, 

and started him off on his literary career."  And it is true.  But Edward soon found the Lithograph 

Company calling for "copy," and, write as he might, he could not supply the biographies fast 

enough. He, at last, completed the first hundred, and so instantaneous was their success that Mr. 

Knapp called for a second hundred, and then for a third.  Finding that one hand was not equal to 

the task, Edward

the sound of the music.  Sleepily the miners crawl back to their respective couches; the moon 

smiles down on mother earth, and nature once more fans itself to sleep with the breath of a 

fragrant breeze.         *       *       *       *       *  Deadwood--magic city of the West!  Not dead, nor 

even sleeping, is this headquarters of the Black Hills population at midnight, twenty-four hours 

subsequent to the rush of the daring road-agents through Camp Crook.  Deadwood is just as lively 

and hilarious a place during the interval between sunset and sunrise as during the day. Saloons, 

dance-houses, and gambling dens keep open all night, and stores do not close until a late hour. At 

one, two and three o'clock in the morning the streets present as lively an appearance as at any 

period earlier in the evening. Fighting, shooting, stabbing and hideous swearing are features of the 

night; singing, drinking, dancing and gambling another.  Nightly the majority of the miners come in 

from such claims as are within a radius of from six to ten miles, and seldom is it that they go away 

without their "load." To be sure, there are some men in Deadwood who do not drink, but they are 

so few and scattering as to seem almost entirely a nonentity.  It was midnight, and Deadwood lay 

basking in a flood of mellow moonlight that cast long shadows from the pine forest on the peaks, 

and glinted upon the rapid, muddy waters of Whitewood creek, which rumbles noisily by the infant 

metropolis on its wild journey toward the south.  All the saloons and dance-houses are in full blast; 

shouts and maudlin yells rend the air. In front of one offer to one or two journalists whom he knew 

and whose accuracy he could trust; and he was speedily convinced that merely to edit biographies 

written by others, at one-half the price paid to him, was more profitable than to write himself.  So 

with five journalists working at top speed to supply the hungry lithograph presses, Mr. Knapp was 

likewise responsible for Edward Bok's first adventure as an editor.  It was commercial, if you will, 

but it was a commercial editing that had a distinct educational value to a large public.  The 

important point is that Edward Bok was being led more and more to writing and to editorship. 

CHAPTER IV  A PRESIDENTIAL FRIEND AND A BOSTON PILGRIMAGE  Edward Bok had not 

been office boy long before he realized that if he learned shorthand he would stand a better 

chance for advancement.  So he joined the Young Men's Christian Association in Brooklyn, and 

entered the class in stenography.  But as this class met only twice a week, Edward, impatient to 

learn the art of "pothooks" as quickly as possible, supplemented this instruction by a course given 

on two other evenings at moderate cost by a Brooklyn business college.  As the system taught in 

both classes was the same, more rapid progress was possible, and the two teachers were 

constantly surprised that he acquired the art so much more quickly than the other students. 

Before many weeks Edward could "stenograph" fairly well, and as the typewriter had not then 

come into its own, he was ready to put his knowledge to practical use.  An opportunity offered 

itself when the city editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_ asked him to report 


_
"ten-by-twenty," an old wretch is singing out lustily:  "Right this way ye cum, pilgrims, ter ther great 

Black Hills Thee'ter; only costs ye four bits ter go in an' see ther tender sex, already a-kickin' in 

their striped stockin's; only four bits, recollect, ter see ther greatest show on earth, so heer's yer 

straight chance!"  But, why the use of yelling? Already the shanty is packed, and judging from the 

thundering screeches and clapping of hands, the entertainment is such as suits the depraved 

tastes of the ruffianly "bums" who have paid their "four bits," and gone in.  But look!  Madly out of 

Deadwood gulch, the abode of thousands of lurking shadows, dashes a horseman.  Straight 

through the main street of the noisy metropolis he spurs, with hat off, and hair blowing backward in 

a jetty cloud.  On, on, followed by the eyes of scores curious to know dinner.  The speakers were 

to be President Hayes, General Grant, General Sherman, Mr. Evarts, and General Sheridan. 

Edward was to report what General Grant and the President said, and was instructed to give the 

President's speech verbatim.  At the close of the dinner, the reporters came in and Edward was 

seated directly in front of the President.  In those days when a public dinner included several kinds 

of wine, it was the custom to serve the reporters with wine, and as the glasses were placed before 

Edward's plate he realized that he had to make a decision then and there.  He had, of course, 

constantly seen wine on his father's table, as is the European custom, but the boy had never 

tasted it.  He decided he would not begin then, when he needed a clear head.  So, in order to get 

more room for his notebook, he asked the waiter to remove the glasses.

his haste--on, and at last he halts in front of a large board shanty, over whose doorway is the 

illuminated canvas sign: "Metropolitan Saloon, by Tom Young."  Evidently his approach is heard, 

for instantly out of the "Metropolitan" there swarms a crowd of miners, gamblers and bummers to 

see  It was the first time he bad ever attempted to report a public address. General Grant's 

remarks were few, as usual, and as he spoke slowly, he gave the young reporter no trouble.  But 

alas for his stenographic knowledge, when President Hayes began to speak!  Edward worked 

hard, but the
