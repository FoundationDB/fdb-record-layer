dracaena marginata north wind will shortly set in. September, as in England=
, is the autumn of this land; the wild fruits are ripe, some of which are n=
ot unpleasant, but they are generally too sweet,--they lack the acidity tha=
t would be agreeable in this burning climate. There is an orange-coloured b=
erry that has a pleasant flavour, but it is extremely oily; this has a pecu=
liarly disagreeable effect upon Oil, or butter, and fry in it a minced onio=

a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder and half a pint of rich gravy, =
salt, simmer, squeeze out the juice of one Florida orange, sweeten it a lit=

ll shortly set in. September, as in England, is the autumn of this land; th=
e wild fruits are ripe, some of which are not unpleasant, but they are gene=
rally too sweet,--they lack the acidity that would be agreeable in this bur=
ning climate. There is an orange-coloured berry that has a pleasant flavour=
, but it is extremely oily; this has a peculiarly disagreeable effect upon =
Oil, or butter, and fry in it a minced onion, stirring until brown; add the=
 beef and stir to prevent burning; now add a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's C=
urry Powder and half a pint of rich gravy, salt, simmer, squeeze out the ju=

y of Beef, _
yards without a halt. I now put so severe a strain upon him, that my strong=
 bamboo bent nearly=20

double, and the fish presently so far yielded to the pressure, that I could=
 enforce his running in half=20

circles instead of straight away. I kept gaining line, until I at length le=
d him into a shallow bay, and=20

after a great fight, Bacheet embraced him by falling upon him, and clutchin=
g the monster with=20

hands and knees; he then tugged to the shore a magnificent fish of upwards =
of sixty pounds. For=20

about twenty minutes he had fought against such a strain as I had never bef=
ore used upon a fish,=20

but I had now adopted hooks of such a large size and thickness that it was =
hardly possible for=20

them to break, unless snapped by a crocodile. My reel was so loosened from =
the rod, that had the=20

struggle lasted a few minutes longer I must have been vanquished. This fish=
 measured three feet=20

eight inches to the root of the tail, and two feet three inches in girth of=
 shoulders; the head=20

measured one foot ten inches in circumference--it was the same species as t=
hose I had already=20

caught.  "This closed the sport for the day. We called all hands to carry t=
he fish to camp, and=20

hoisted the flag, which was quickly followed by the arrival of a number of =
men from Sofi, to receive=20

all that we could spare. The largest fish we cut into thin strips,--these w=
e salted and dried; the=20

head made delicious soup, with a teaspoonful of curry-powder.  "September 2=
6.--The weather is=20

now intensely hot, and the short spear grass is drying so rapidly that in s=
ome stony places it can=20

be fired. The birds appear to build their nests at various seasons. Many th=
at built three months ago=20

are again at work; among others is a species of black Mina, that takes enti=
re possession of a tree,=20

which it completely covers with nests coarsely constructed of sticks. A few=
 days ago I found=20

several trees converted into colonies of many hundred dwellings.  "I never =
allow either the=20

monkeys or baboons to be disturbed: thus they have no fear of our party, bu=
t with perfect=20

confidence they approach within thirty or forty yards of the tents, sitting=
 upon the rocks and trees,=20

and curiously watching all that takes place in the camp. I have only seen o=
ne species of monkey in=20

this neighbourhood--a handsome dark grey animal with white whiskers. The ba=
boons are also of=20

one species, the great dog-faced ape (Cynocephalus); these grow to a very l=
arge size, and old=20

Masara fully pan two tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil, and when hot fry=
 the pieces of chicken in=20

it until they are partially cooked; remove the chicken, add another tablesp=
oonful of oil, and a=20

minced Bermuda onion; when brown add two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Cu=
rry Powder.=20

Return the chicken to the pan with half a pint of hot water, cover and set =
on back of range to=20

simmer half an hour. Add a pint of hot water to the pan, strain the sauce t=
o remove the onion, if=20

objectionable. Dissolve a tablespoonful of rice flour in a gill of cold wat=
er, stir it into the sauce with=20

half a teaspoonful of salt, or use a teaspoonful of Manioca instead of flou=
r. When the sauce=20

thickens, add the chicken (provided it had been removed to facilitate the s=
training of the sauce),=20

and allow it to stand an hour before serving. When ready for the table, put=
 the Curry on a hot=20

platter, and serve with hot boiled rice and a Chutney sauce.     Chicken Cu=
rry, No. 2.   Prepare the=20

Curry sauce as before described, and in it warm up slices of cold roast or =
boiled chicken, or=20

turkey.     Chicken Curry, No. 3.   Cut up a dry-picked roasting or spring =
chicken. Rub into the=20

pieces a liberal quantity of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, dry. Fry the piece=
s thoroughly in four=20

tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil; when done serve with a tomato sauce w=
ell flavored with a few=20

drops of Tobasco sauce. If for breakfast, serve with Manioca griddle cakes.=
     Curry of Duckling.=20

The spring duckling is delightful eating, but its peculiar flavor is not al=
ways relished at first; they=20

are best broiled. Split the bird down the back, rub Antonini Olive Oil over=
 it, sprinkle over it a small=20



quantity of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, then broil on both sides. When done=
 squeeze over the bird=20

the juice of a Florida orange.     Curry of Squab.   Squabs treated in the =
same manner as the=20

duckling are most appetizing. They are excellent for cold luncheon, for pic=
nics, collations, etc. The=20

wild squab partially fried, then allowed to stand in a Curry sauce half an =
hour before serving, is=20

good eating.     Curry of Venison.   Cold roast venison makes a very good b=
reakfast Curry, as the=20

meat is tender and digestible. Put in a frying pan, a tablespoonful of Anto=
nini Olive Oil, half a=20

teaspoonful of dry flour, brown it slightly. Add a clove of garlic and a ta=
blespoonful of minced=20

apple, a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, and half a pint of hot =
water, or venison gravy=20


_
baboon, if they are allowed to become so bold.  "This afternoon I took a st=
roll with the rifle, but saw=20

nothing except a young crocodile about six feet long; this was on the dry s=
ummit of a hill, far from=20

water. I shot it and took the skin. I can only conclude that the small stre=
am in which he had=20

wandered from the river-bed had become dry, and the creature had lost its w=
ay in searching for=20

other water.  "September 27.--I started from the tent at 6 A.M. and made a =
circuit of about=20

eighteen miles, seeing nothing but tetel and gazelles, but I had no luck. H=
ot and disgusted, I=20

returned home, and took the rod, hoping for better luck in the river. I hoo=
ked, but lost, a small fish,=20

and I began to think that the fates were against me by land and water, when=
 I suddenly had a=20

tremendous run, and about a the range. Cut the meat in neat pieces, add it =
to the sauce, and=20

when quite hot send to table. Before serving, add the juice of a Florida or=
ange.     Curry of=20

Venison, No. 2.   The pieces of venison which are not large enough for stea=
ks or for roasting=20

purposes may be thus prepared. Cut a pound of the meat into inch squares an=
d toss them about=20

in a frying pan, with an overflowing tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil; a=
fter cooking five minutes=20

add a tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder and a gill of hot water c=
ontaining a teaspoonful=20

of Maggi Bouillon; cover. While this is cooking, cut two medium sized raw p=
otatoes into small dice,=20

and add them to the meat with half a teaspoonful of salt. The steam will co=
ok the potatoes in ten=20

minutes. Mix the ingredients together and if too dry add a little=20


_
without the possibility of stopping the fish. The river was very low; thus =
I followed along the bank,=20

holding hard, and after about half an hour of difference of opinion, the fi=
sh began to show itself,=20

and I coaxed it into the shallows; here it was cleverly managed by Bacheet,=
 who lugged it out by=20

the tail. It was an ugly monster, of about fifty pounds, a species of silur=
us, known by the Arabs as=20

the 'coor;' it differed from the silurus of Europe by haviimg a dorsal     =
Curry of Rabbit.   Select two=20

fine rabbits, cut them into neat pieces; put into an earthen crock a thin s=
lice of bacon, add a few=20

slices of rabbit, sprinkle over it a little of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, =
salt, fresh grated cocoanut,=20

and a dozen raisins; put in another layer of rabbit meat, and season it as =
the first layer, repeat until=20

the rabbit is all used, and you have also used the juice and meat of one fr=
esh, or half a pound of=20

dry cocoanut; moisten the whole=20


_
along the back to the tail. This fish had lungs resembling delicate branche=
s of red coral, and, if=20

kept moist, it would exist upon the land for many hours like an eel. It sme=
lt strongly of musk, but it=20

was gladly accepted by the Sheik of Sofi, who immediately answered to the f=
lag.  "While shooting=20

this morning I came suddenly upon a small species of leopard that had just =
killed a snake about=20

five feet in length; the head was neatly bitten off and lay upon the ground=
 near the body; the=20

animal was commencing a meal off the snake when it was disturbed, and I los=
t sight of it=20

immediately in the high grass.  "September 28.--The heat is most oppressive=
: even the nights are=20

hot, until about 2 A.M., at which hour a cool breeze springs up. The wind n=
ow blows from the=20

south until about 1 P.M., when it changes suddenly to the north, and then v=
aries between these=20

two points during the rest of the day; this leads hours, then place the cro=
ck in a pot of water and=20

simmer three hours. While cooking, the crock must be tightly covered. Serve=
 with hot boiled rice=20

and over the meat squeeze the juice of a lime.     Curry of Hare.   Skin, c=
lean, and quarter the hare=20

and rub each piece well with J. P. Smith's Curry Powder. Put into a saucepa=
n a tablespoonful of=20

beef drippings, a sliced onion, the pieces of meat, half a teaspoonful of s=
alt, and a gill of claret.=20

Cover and simmer an hour; add another gill of claret, two heaping tablespoo=
nfuls of currant jelly,=20

two squares of sugar, and simmer two hours longer. Serve with boiled rice, =
over which sprinkle a=20

little orange juice.     Curry of Beef.   The best piece of meat for this d=
ish is the lean part of the=20

flank, which, being cross-grained, allows the Curry to thoroughly assimilat=
e with every particle of=20

the meat. Cut up one pound of the meat into neat square pieces. Put=20
