already he had observed that she deeply enjoyed recounting the histories of=
 her family and=20

friends, more especially what Gretchen unconsciously must have regarded as =
their weaknesses.=20

"But your brother, Captain Liedermann, is ill, perhaps it is natural that h=
e does not wish a little=20

chatterbox about him all the time. If I had been confined to my bed for as =
many months as he has,=20

why I should have turned into a great bear. One day you would have come in =
to speak to me,=20

Gretchen, and then you would have heard a low growl and two arms would have=
 gone around you=20

and hugged you like this," and Major Hersey suited his action to his words.=
  After a little squeak=20

half of delight and half of fear, Gretchen settled herself more comfortably=
 in her companion's lap.=20

However, she was not to be deterred from continuing her own line of convers=
ation.  In the years to=20

come, Major Jimmie had a vision of this same little German girl, grown olde=
r and stouter, her=20

yellow pigtails bound round her wide head, sitting beside just such a fires=
ide as his own and=20

talking on and on of her own little interests and concerns, forever content=
ed if her hearer would=20

only pretend to listen.  For the sake of the listener of the future Jimmie =
hoped that the small=20

Gretchen would continue to have the same soothing effect that she was at pr=
esent producing upon=20

him.  "My brother is not always in bed," Gretchen protested. "Now and then =
when he thinks he is=20

alone, and I am only peeping in at the door, he climbs out of bed and walks=
 about his room. One=20

day one of his friends was in the room with him and when he got up and stam=
ped about they both=20

laughed."  "Oh, well, any fellow would laugh if he was growing strong again=
 after a long illness,"=20

Major Hersey answered a little plays."  Fortunately, Doris and Melroy had g=
one to the theater after=20

dinner, the evening-before-last; they were able to join the conversation. Y=
oung Mr. Quillen wanted=20

Doris Rives' opinion, as a psychologist, of the mental processes of the her=
oine of the play they=20

had seen; as nearly as she could determine, Doris replied, the heroine in q=
uestion had exhibited=20

nothing even loosely describable as mental processes of any sort. They were=
 still on the subject=20

when the two labor negotiators, Mr. Cronnin and Mr. Fields, arrived. Cronni=
n was in his sixties,=20

with the nearsighted squint and compressed look of concentration of an old-=
time precision=20

machinist; Fields was much younger, and sported a Phi Beta Kappa key.  Lyon=
s, who seemed to=20

be the senior mediator, thereupon called the meeting to order and they took=
 their places at the=20

table.         *       *       *       *       *  "Now, gentlemen--and Dr. =
Rives--this will be simply an informal=20

discussion, so that everybody can see what everybody else's position in the=
 matter is. We won't=20

bother to make a sound recording. Then, if we have managed to reach some co=
mmon=20

understanding of the question this evening, we can start the regular hearin=
g say at thirteen=20

hundred tomorrow. Is that agreeable?"  It was. The younger mediator, Quille=
n, cleared his throat.=20

"It seems, from our information, that this entire dispute arises from the d=
ischarge, by Mr. Melroy, of=20

two of his employees, named Koffler and Burris. Is that correct?"  "Well, t=
here's also the question=20

of the Melroy Engineering Corporation's attempting to use strike-breakers, =
and the Long Island=20

Atomic Power Authority's having condoned this unfair employment practice," =
Cronnin said, acidly.=20

"And there's also the question of the I.F.A.W.'s=20


_
Gretchen really required no comment on his part.  "Besides, you must be mis=
taken, your mother=20

told me that Captain Liedermann had not been so well of late, nothing serio=
us, a little infection in a=20

wound he had believed healed. As for guests who come frequently to your bro=
ther's room, why I=20

never knew so quiet a household as your's, _kleines Madchen_! During the ma=
ny hours I am here=20

in this sitting-room, no one ever rings the front door bell or passes my do=
or."  As a matter of fact=20

Major Hersey's sitting-room was upon the first floor of the house and near =
its entrance. Formerly=20

his room must have been either a small study or reception room, as the larg=
e drawing-rooms were=20

across the hall. But these were never in use at the present time and kept a=
lways darkened, as a=20

household symbol that all gayety and pleasure had vanished from the homes o=
f Germany.  It=20

occurred to Jimmie Hersey at this instant to wonder if Hedwig Liedermann ha=
d no friends. She=20

was a handsome girl with light brown hair and eyes and a gentle manner. Sur=
ely there must be=20

some young German officer in Coblenz who regarded her with favor! But if th=
is were true he had=20

never appeared at her home at any hour strike on my company," Melroy added.=
  "We resent that=20

characterization!" Cronnin retorted.  "It's a term in common usage; it deno=
tes a strike called=20

without warning or declaration of intention, which this was," Melroy told h=
im.  "And there's also the=20

question of the I.F.A.W. calling a general strike, in illegal manner, at th=
e Long Island Reaction=20

Plant," Leighton spoke up. "On sixteen hours' notice."  "Well, that wasn't =
the fault of the I.F.A.W.=20

as an organization," Fields argued. "Mr. Cronnin and I are agreed that the =
walk-out date should be=20

postponed for two weeks, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal L=
abor Act."  "Well, how=20

about my company?" Melroy wanted to know. "Your I.F.A.W. members walked out=
 on me, without=20

any notice whatever, at twelve hundred today. Am I to consider that an act =
of your union, or will=20

you disavow it so that I can fire all of them for quitting without permissi=
on?"  "And how about the=20

action of members of your union, acting on instructions from Harry Crandall=
, in re-packing the=20

Number One Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactor at our plant, after the pluto=
nium and the U-238=20

and the neutron-source containers had been removed, in order to=20


_
sight of him. It would not be difficult to recognize a German officer, even=
 if he should be wearing=20

civilian clothes.  Besides why did Fraulein Liedermann not entertain her gi=
rl friends in the drawing-

rooms of her home? These rooms must have been used for social purposes befo=
re the war, as the=20

position of Colonel Liedermann's family in Coblenz was of almost equal impo=
rtance with the=20

German nobility.  "Oh, no one comes to call upon us at the front door any l=
onger," Gretchen added=20

amiably. "You see you are an American officer and use this door and our fri=
ends do not wish to=20

see you. They do not seem to like you."  "They--they don't," Major Hersey t=
hought other things to=20

himself, although naturally, in view of his audience, saying nothing unplea=
sant aloud.  How stupid=20

he was not to have guessed what the smallest daughter of the house had just=
 related! After all one=20

could understand, the German viewpoint since in spite of having been told t=
o love our enemies,=20

how few of us have accomplished it?  It could not be agreeable to the defea=
ted officers and=20

soldiers of the conquered German army to enter the homes of their friends a=
nd find them occupied=20

by the victors.  "Better run away now, Gretchen, it must be getting near yo=
ur tea-time," the=20

American officer suggested, the little girl having occasioned an unpleasant=
 train of thought by her=20

final chatter.  working on the reactor?" Leighton demanded. "Am I to unders=
tand that the union=20

sustains that action, too?"  "I hadn't known about that," Fields said, some=
what startled.  "Neither=20

had I," Cronnin added. "When did it happen?"  "About sixteen hundred today,=
" Melroy told him.=20

"We were on the plane from Oak Ridge, then," Fields declared. "We know noth=
ing about that."=20

"Well, are you going to take the responsibility for it, or aren't you?" Lei=
ghton insisted.  Lyons, who=20

had been toying with a small metal paperweight, rapped on the table with it=
.  "Gentlemen," he=20

interrupted. "We're trying to cover too many subjects at once. I suggest th=
at we confine ourselves,=20

at the beginning, to the question of the dismissal of these men, Burris and=
 Koffler. If we find that=20

the I.F.A.W. has a legitimate grievance in what we may call the Burris-Koff=
ler question, we can=20

settle that and then go on to these other questions."  "I'm agreeable to th=
at," Melroy said.  "So are=20

we," Cronnin nodded.  "All right, then. Since the I.F.A.W. is the complaini=
ng party in this question,=20

perhaps you gentlemen should state the grounds for your complaints."  Field=
s and Cronnin=20

exchanged glances: Cronnin nodded to Fields and the latter rose. The two em=
ployees in question,=20

he stated, had been the victims of discrimination and persecution because o=
f union activities.=20

Koffler was the union=20


_
But before Gretchen, who was not disposed to hurry, had departed, they were=
 both startled by the=20

sudden ringing of the front door bell, the bell whose silence they had been=
 discussing, then they=20

heard the noise of people outside.  A little later, one of the maids having=
 opened the door,=20

Gretchen and Major Hersey Engineering Corporation, and Burris had been acti=
ve in bringing=20

complaints about unfair employment practices. Furthermore, it was the opini=
on of the I.F.A.W. that=20

the psychological tests imposed on their members had been a fraudulent pret=
ext for dismissing=20

these two men, and, in any case, the practice of compelling=20


_
The same instant Gretchen escaped.  Then followed a cry from Frau Liederman=
n, and Sergeant=20

Hackett's voice and another voice replying.  Major Hersey, unable to guess =
what had taken place,=20

and anxious, joined the little group outside his door.  In his arms Sergean=
t Hackett was carrying=20

was insulting, degrading, and not a customary condition of employment.  Wit=
h that, he sat down.=20

Melroy was on his feet at once.  "I'll deny those statements, categorically=
 and seriatim," he replied.=20

"They are based entirely upon misrepresentations made by the two men who we=
