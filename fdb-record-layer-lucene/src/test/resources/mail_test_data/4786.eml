Slave women had no time for their children. These were cared for by an old =
woman who called=20

them twice a day and fed them "pot likker" (vegetable broth) and skimmed mi=
lk. Each child was=20

provided with a wooden laddle which he dipped into a wooden trough and fed =
himself. The older=20

children fed those who were too young to hold a laddle.  So exacting was "B=
ig Jim" that slaves=20

were forced to work even when sick. Expectant mothers toiled in the fields =
until they felt their labor=20

pains. It was not uncommon for babies to be born in the fields.  There was =
little time for play on his=20

plantation. Even the very small children were assigned tasks. They hunted h=
en's eggs, gathered=20

poke berries for dyeing, shelled corn and drove the cows home in the evenin=
g. Little girls knitted=20

stockings.  There was no church on this plantation and itinerant ministers =
avoided going there=20

because of the owner's cruelty. Very seldom were the slaves allowed to atte=
nd neighboring=20

churches and still rarer were the opportunities to hold meetings among them=
selves. Often when=20

they were in the middle of a song or prayer they would be forced to halt an=
d run to the "Big=20

House." Woe to any slave who ignored the ringing of the bell that summoned =
him to work and told=20

him when he might "knock off" from his labors.  Louisa and Sam last heard t=
he ringing of this bell=20

in the fall of 1865. All the slaves gathered in front of the "Big House" to=
 be told that they were free=20

for the time being. They had heard whisperings of the War but did not under=
stand the meaning of=20

it all. Now "Big Jim" stood weeping on the piazza and cursing the fate that=
 had been so cruel to=20

him by robbing him of all his "niggers." He inquired if any wanted to remai=
n until all the crops were=20

harvested and when no one consented to do so, he flew into a rage; seizing =
his pistol, he began=20

firing into the crowd of frightened Negroes. Some were _killed_ outright an=
d others were maimed=20

for life. Finally he was prevailed upon to stop. He then attempted to take =
his own life. A few=20

frightened slaves promised to remain with him another year; this placated h=
im. It was necessary=20

for Union soldiers to make another visit to the plantation before "Big Jim"=
 would allow his former=20

slaves to depart.  Sam and Louisa moved to Boston, Georgia, where they shar=

like its mysterious lord, so regal and so fantastic in its splendour, yet s=

guarded, so full of the spirit of dark ambition, so haunted by the shadow o=
f the dagger. There he=20

lay, watching the storm that gathered in the North, scanning the stars and =
waiting for his hour.=20

When the Swedes and Saxons, under Gustavus and the Elector of Saxony, drew =
near to the=20

Imperial army under Tilly, in the neighbourhood of Leipsic, there was a cri=
sis, a thrill of worldwide=20

expectation, as when the Armada approached the shores of England; as when t=
he allies met the=20

forces of Louis XIV. at Blenheim, as when, on those same plains of Leipsic,=
 the uprisen nations=20

advanced to battle against Napoleon. Count Tilly's military genius fell sho=
rt only of the highest. His=20

figure was one which showed that war had become a science, and that the day=
s of the Paladins=20

were past. He was a little old man, with a broad wrinkled forehead, hollow =
cheeks, a long nose=20

and projecting chin, grotesquely attired in a slashed doublet of green sati=
n, with a peaked hat and=20

a long red feather hanging down behind. His charger was a grey pony, his on=
ly weapon a pistol,=20

which it was his delight to say he had never fired in the thirty pitched fi=
elds which he had fought=20



and won. He was a Walloon by birth, a pupil of the Jesuits, a sincere devot=
ee, and could boast=20

that he had never yielded to the allurements of wine or women, as well as t=
hat he had never lost a=20

battle. His name was now one of horror, for he was the captor of Magdeburg,=
 and if he had not=20

commanded the massacre, or, as it was said, jested at it, he could not be a=
cquitted of cruel=20

connivance. That it was the death of his honour to survive the butchery whi=
ch he ought to have=20

died, if necessary, in resisting sword in hand, is a soldier's judgment on =
his case. At his side was=20

 with all the devotion, all=20

 of cavalry officers, the leader=20

of the storming column at Magdeburg.  In those armies the heavy cavalry was=

of all calibres and with a whole vocabulary of fantastic names, but none ca=

taking his lesson from the Roman legion, had introduced a more open order--=
he had lightened the=20

 wheeling, to charge=20
