while Elias peered down at them over the foot-board of his bed, and told th=

gestures.  "Tell us about the clock," said Philemon, on this occasion.  But=
 at this suggestion=20

Romeo Augustus--poor little Romeo Augustus!--quaked in his red flannel nigh=
t-gown.  Elias=20

haven't a sign of a head, nor feet, nor arms, nor legs. They just dangle. A=
nd the other THING"--

here Elias's voice was awful--"the other THING writhes in agony. It is neve=
r quiet; never, never,=20

nevermore; not when we're asleep, nor when we're eating our porridge. Forev=
er and forever it=20

writhes--_anon_."  That was a capital word to end with. No one knew what "a=
non" meant. It was=20

to him, for he was old,=20

and even the devil knows more because of years than because he is the devil=

that to kill a man was to Tio Cabrera as pleasant an exercise as for them t=

approached him, and inviting him to drink, said, not exactly knowing why, =
=E2=80=9CViva Urquiza,=E2=80=9D and then=20

the storm broke out.  His eyes flashed fire, and drawing his facon he shout=
