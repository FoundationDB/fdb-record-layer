from the     heroic ages.(544)   Such was the last city in Gaul wherein die=

Ragon explains.       A=20

few monuments of glorious antiquity are still there, such as the     temple=

Ragon goes on:       Arles, founded two thousand years before Christ, was s=

silence of his=20

subordinate, "if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness."  "Par=
dieu! you are right--a=20

mute from the East! I swear it was time for you to come back, La Ramee, and=
 I was eager to see=20

you again."  "Monseigneur is too good," said La Ramee, flattered by the com=
pliment.  "Yes,"=20

continued the duke, "really, I feel bored today beyond the power of descrip=
tion."  "Then let us have=20

a match in the tennis court," exclaimed La Ramee.  "If you wish it."  "I am=
 at your service, my lord."=20

"I protest, my dear La Ramee," said the duke, "that you are a charming fell=
ow and that I would=20

stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your society."  "My lord,=
" replied La Ramee, "I=20

think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled."  "Wha=

seen him lately?"  "He sent for me to-day."  "Really! to speak to you about=
 me?"  "Of what else do=20

you imagine he would speak to me? Really, my lord, you are his nightmare." =
 The duke smiled=20

with bitterness.  "Ah, La Ramee! if you would but accept my offers! I would=
 make your fortune."=20

"How? you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confisc=
ated."  "I shall no=20

sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of Paris."  "Pshaw! pshaw! I=
 cannot hear such things=20

said as that; this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king! I se=
e, my lord, I shall be obliged=20
