philodendron monstera flapped in the light breeze.  "You didn't build the shack?" Mr. Hatfield whispered to Jack. He had noted a tiny curl of smoke rising lazily from a tin pipe cut through the roof.  January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet.

and mean inside. And I'll tell you ahead that I'm going--I promise!"  "You're promising a heap, 

Jack," the widow returned dryly. "Only trouble is, you've made a lot of 'em before you never kept." 

"I never made any to you."  "Well, that's a fact. You have kept your word such as you've given." 

"Then let me have another chance. Just one more!"  "Not unless you tell the truth about that black 

dress of mine."  "I never took it!" Jack said desperately. "Believe me, I never did!"  "But you know 

how it came to be in the hollow log?"  "Not for sure," Jack hedged.  "You could make a pretty 

shrewd guess."  "Maybe."  "Then suppose you come clean and tell the Cubs everything you 

listened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well.  "My papa sad for the old 

country. He not look good. He never make music any more. At home he play violin all the time; for 

weddings and for dance. Here never. When I beg him for play, he shake his head no. Some days 

he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on the strings, like this, but never he 

make the music. He don't like this kawn-tree."  "People who don't like this country ought to stay at 

home," I said severely. "We don't make them come here."  "He not want to come, nev-er!" she 

burst out. "My mamenka make him come. All the time she say: 'America big country; much money,

"Help 'em after they turned me in?"  "Did they really do you such a bad turn seeing to it that you 

were sent out here to my place?"  "No'm," Jack murmured. "I'm all mixed up. I don't know what to 

do--"  "I want you to stay with me always, Jack. You're a fine boy."  "You mean that? You ain't just 

handing me a line so's I'll do what you want?"  "I really mean it, Jack. You should boys, much 

husband for my girls.' My papa, he cry for leave his old friends what make music with him. He love 

very much the man what play the long horn like this"--she indicated a slide trombone. "They go to 

school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with 

many cattle."  "Your mama," I said angrily, "wants other people's things."  "Your 


_
word I keep it."  Jack debated with himself only a moment longer. Then he arrived at his decision. 

"I want to stay here," he said earnestly. "I'll do whatever you tell me to--and I ain't crossin' my 

fingers when I say it, either! You can switch me whenever you want to and I won't try to take the 

switch away from you."  "Now that's right considerate of you, Jack," Mrs. Jones smiled. "We'll get 

along fine from now on. And we won't need that switch again."  "I'll fill the woodbox," Jack offered 

eagerly. "You're most out of kindling."  Mrs. Jones hauled him up short. "That job can wait, Jack. 

You got something else more important to do."  "Tell us everything you know about the tin box," 

Mr. Hatfield urged. "You'll be doing the Cubs a real service, Jack. You see, not only myself but the 

entire organization has been under a cloud since the money disappeared."  "I ain't sure what 

became of it, but I may know," Jack admitted.  "Then suppose you tell us," the Cub leader urged. 

"I'll show you instead," Jack offered. "Follow me to the woods, and you may see something kinda 

interesting!"                                    CHAPTER 17                            Through the Window   Skirting 

the marsh, Jack led the Cubs deep into the shadowy woods. Apparently he had gone that way 

often, for he seldom hesitated in choosing the trail.  "Where do you think he's taking us?" Dan 

speculated, bringing up the rear with Brad.  "It has me guessing, Dan. He seems to know where's 

he's going though. I have a hunch he may show us something that will have an important bearing." 

After a brisk five-minute hike through the woods, Jack abruptly halted.  "If you want to see 

anything, you got to be quiet from here on," he warned.  All conversation ceased. Still led by Jack, 

the Cubs moved on at a slower papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is 

very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here."  Ambrosch was considered the important 

person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often 

surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything 

their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did any one else, she stood in awe 

of her elder brother.  After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable 

horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and 

said I hoped that snooping old woman would n't come to see us any more.  Grandmother chuckled 

and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto's sock. "She's not old, Jim, though I expect she 

seems old to you. No, I would n't mourn if she never came again. But, you see, a body never 

knows what traits poverty might bring out in 'em. It makes a woman grasping to see her children 

want for things. Now read me a chapter in 'The Prince of the House of David.' Let's forget the 

Bohemians."  We had three weeks of this mild, open weather. The cattle in the corral ate corn 

almost as fast as the men could shell it for them, and we hoped they would be ready for an early 

market. One morning the two big bulls, Gladstone and Brigham Young, thought spring had come, 

and they began to tease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them. Soon 

they got angry. They bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with their hoofs, rolling their eyes and 

tossing their heads. Each withdrew to a far corner of his own corral, and then they made for each 

other at a gallop. Thud, thud, we could hear the impact of their great heads, and their bellowing 

shook the pans on the 


_
leaves.  Presently Jack again halted. This time he did not speak.  However, the Cubs, gathering 

close about, saw that they had neared their destination.  Directly ahead, in a tiny clearing close to 

the stream, stood a crude shack. Side walls were badly built from odd-shaped lumber which the 

Cubs guessed had been taken from near-by construction jobs.  dehorned, they would have torn 

each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat steers took it up and began butting and horning each 

other. Clearly, the affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while Fuchs 

rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again and again, finally driving them 

apart.  The big storm of the
