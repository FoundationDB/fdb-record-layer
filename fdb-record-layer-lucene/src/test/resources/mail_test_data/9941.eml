philodendron monstera to the development of agriculture, in the time of Enrile, by its reports, memoirs, and material support. We read with surprise, however, that in 1833 this Society, in an opinion requested from it by the home of most, and aluminum one-tenth. From fifteen to twenty per cent. is made of various others, magnesium, calcium, iron, sodium and potassium being most common. Hence, the compounds present are always of the philodendron monstera to the development of agriculture, in the time of Enrile, by its reports, memoirs, and material support.

abandoning the capital. He also decreed standards for weights and measures, which unfortunately 

soon fell into disuse; and he created a military commission with power to execute evildoers, which 

fulfilled the object of its creation."  Ricafort was succeeded (December 23, 1830) by Pascual Enrile 

y Alcedo, a most zealous and able governor. He personally visited the northern provinces of Luzn, 

accompanied by his relative and adjutant, Jos Mara Pearanda (afterward the governor of Albay), a 

military engineer, who afterward made journeys and surveys in a large part of the rest of that 

island; this resulted in carefully prepared itineraries, plans, and maps, which were utilized in the 

construction of matter from a great depth must needs be many tons to the square inch. Clearly 

these gentlemen would perch us on a sort of universal fire-box, and poise the lid on a hair trigger. 

But heavy rainfalls and terrific thunder storms are almost invariable accompaniments of explosive 

eruptions. That these are the result and not the cause of volcanic action is clear. An electrical 

machine was invented by Sir William Armstrong, in which electricity was generated by forcing 

steam at great speed through a narrow orifice. This same principle would produce volcanic 

thunder storms. The immense volumes of vapor, reaching the open air, must rapidly cool and be 

precipitated as rain. The Italians dread these torrents, 


_
and bridges, and the establishment of postal routes, which opened up communication between 

regions before destitute of such facilities, and sometimes in places heretofore deemed 

impassable. The navigable rivers and bayous of Pangasinn were explored and mapped; a 

highway was made in Pampanga which should be safe from the overflow of Lake Canarem; and 

explorations were made from east to west in Luzn for the sake of bringing the shores of the island 

into communication with the fertile plains of the interior. On May 14, 1834, Pearanda was made 

corregidor or governor of the province of Albay, "which experienced a complete quantities of mud, 

more than they do the streams of lava.  If an eruption causes an immediate fall of two inches of 

rain over an area seven miles square, it will be found that such a rainfall amounts to more than 

seven millions of tons of water. Yet the rainfall often is greater, and the area affected is larger; 

while it is not to be supposed that the entire volume of vapor cast forth is at once precipitated on 

the earth. This computation can not be assumed as anything more than a mere illustration of the 

tremendous forces brought into operation.  The solid substances emitted by volcanoes are 

popularly styled ashes,

rule. To him it owed its most important roads, bridges, and public edifices, and the promotion of its 

agriculture, on which account his name is venerated by the inhabitants of Albay; they perpetuated 

the memory of this illustrious but modest patriot by erecting, some years after his death, a 

monument to him in the plaza of the capital of the province." The appropriately named dust; for it 

is merely finely divided lava, and in no way resembles genuine ashes.  Lavas present a general 

resemblance to the slag and clinkers of smelters and brick-kilns, but vary considerably in 

appearance and chemical composition. We need not touch this question further than to state that 

oxygen forms nearly one-half the weight of all
