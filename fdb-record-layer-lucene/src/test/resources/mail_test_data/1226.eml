dracaena marginata coffin.  As a matter of fact, he had often regretted that he had broken with McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.  If it had n't been for that fresh salesman, Briggs, he never would have.  And after he _had_ broken  "I ask no better," said the young man; and he repeated the narrative which he had told to Sir James Montgomery. "Don't you disbelieve me. What I say to you is the whole truth," he said,--"everything that dracaena marginata coffin.  As a matter of fact, he had often regretted that he had broken with McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.

And after he _had_ broken  "I ask no better," said the young man; and he repeated the narrative which he had told to Sir James Montgomery. "Don't you disbelieve me. What I say to you is the whole truth," he said,--"everything that _
mean it literally."  "Your metaphors are fearfully mixed, Dearie."  "Does n't matter.  They're 

graphic."  "But they're not clear to me."  "They are to me, which is enough," said Skinner, with a 

suggestion of finality.  Honey pouted reproachfully at the snub, and Skinner's heart instantly smote 

him.  "Don't worry, Honey.  It's all right."  He paused.  "Now, I'm going to make a prophecy."  He 

pointed impressively at her with his forefinger. "And you mark my words!  Things will begin to 

happen right after the Wilkinson dinner."  "That's Sunday morning."  "Things have happened on 

Sunday," observed Skinner quietly.  "When do you expect to start for home?"  "I 'm not sure, but I 

'm counting strongly on Tuesday morning."  While the Skinners were talking, something pertaining 

to the same business was developing in another part of the city.  "Do I get another dress?" Mrs. 

Jackson asked as the famous curmudgeon entered the dining-room Thursday evening.  "You do," 

he growled.  "I'll be hanged if I understand it."  "It's too bad," Mrs. Jackson began.  The 

curmudgeon held up his finger.  "Stop right where you are.  I know what you're going to say."  He 

growled out the accustomed formula: "'You'd give me dresses all day long and diamonds and a 

magnificent house, but you don't give me what is dearest in the world.  I want to go with the people 

I 'm fit to go with!'  In the future, just to save time, cross your fingers and I'll know you mean 

formula number two."  "But Mr. Skinner," Mrs. Jackson persisted.  The curmudgeon cut her short. 

"What's _Skinner_ got to do with it?"  "Got to do with it?  Why, he's a regular missing link!" 

"Missing link?"  Jackson looked at her in surprise.  "Have you seen him?"  "I don't mean that--I 

mean connecting link."  "Some difference," Jackson grunted.  "If you hadn't gone and broken ever-

-that nothing could save him or his reputation. Perhaps in no case could anything save him: but if 

he fled, his ruin was certain. "What did it matter," he thought, with bitterness, "that he had no 

witnesses to produce, that nobody would believe him? And if he were condemned, what would any 

one care? His mother, indeed, would feel the shame, but more the shame than anything else; and 

her name was not Erskine, nor that of any of her family. There was no one who actually belonged 

to him in the wide world, to whom his living or dying could be of any consequence." As he stood 

alone with these bitter thoughts, on the terrace, looking out upon the night, feeling the wind blow 

upon him from the fields of sleep, but no other trace in the darkness of the great wide landscape 

which he knew lay stretched out like a map under cover of the clouds, something breathed another 

name in his ear. Ah! how did he know if she would care? Sometimes he had thought so, hoped so, 

vaguely, with a tremor of alarmed delight. But if this shadow of crime came over him, would Edith 

stoop under it to say a word of consolation?--would she? could she? He stood still for a long time 

on the terrace, with the lighted window and common life behind him, and all the secrets of the 

hidden night before, and asked himself what she would do. What would she do? That question, 

and not the other, was, after all, the great one in life.  Next morning John awoke with the sense of 

a coming trial, which made his heart jump in his breast the moment he opened his eyes, though it 

was some time before he recollected what it was. But he did so at last, and accepted the certainty 

with outward calm. He came down-stairs with a steady conviction of what was about to happen. To 

make up his mind to it was something. He sat down at the breakfast-table opposite 


_
"That's enough.  It's too late now.  I don't want to hear anything more about it."  Mrs. Jackson said 

nothing.  She knew that silence at such a time was her most effective weapon.  Jackson waited for 

her to speak, but as she did not speak he immediately felt sorry that he'd been short with her. She 

was the only person in the world he really cared for.  But he must show no outward sign of 

weakness, so he repeated, "It's too late now, I tell you!"  But, being a resourceful man, Jackson 

never considered anything too late.  He would never take defeat for granted Beaufort--who was 

restless and uncomfortable--with a calm which he felt to be fictitious, but which nevertheless was 

calm.  "You must remember," he said, "Beaufort, whatever happens, that Dalrulzian is altogether 

at your command."  "What can happen?" Beaufort asked.  "I scarcely know. I can be taken away, I 

suppose, and examined somewhere. You had better come with me. You are a barrister, and might 

help; and besides, it will always be for your advantage to get a little insight into Scotch law."  "I 

might be of use, perhaps; but in that case, you must tell me
