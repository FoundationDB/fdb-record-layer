philodendron monstera Initiates transmitted their knowledge to the human ki=

moral strength and power is association and solidarity of thought and purpo=
se. "The Sons of Will=20

and Yoga" united in the beginning to resist the terrible and ever-growing i=
niquities of the left-hand=20

Adepts, the Atlanteans. This led to the foundation of still more Secret Sch=
ools, temples of learning,=20

and of Mysteries inaccessible to all except after the most terrible trials =
and probations.  Anything=20

that might be said of the earliest Adepts and their divine Masters would be=
 regarded as fiction. It is=20

necessary, therefore, if we would know something of the primitive Initiates=
 to judge of the tree by=20

its fruits; to examine the bearing and the work of their successors in the =
Fifth Race as reflected in=20

the works of the classic writers and the great Philosophers. How were Initi=
ation and the Initiates=20

regarded during some 2,000 years by the Greek and Roman writers? Cicero inf=
orms his readers in=20

very clear terms. He says:       An Initiate must practise all the virtues =
in his power: justice,=20

fidelity, liberality, modesty, temperance; these virtues cause men     to f=
orget the talents that he=20

may lack.(491)   Ragon says:       When the Egyptian priests said: "All for=
 the people, nothing=20

through the people," they were right: in an ignorant nation truth     must =
be revealed only to=20

trustworthy persons.... We have seen in     our days, "all through the peop=
le, nothing for the=20

people," a     false and dangerous system. The real axiom ought to be: "All=
 for     the people and=20

_with_ the people."(492)   But in order to achieve this reform the masses h=
ave to pass through a=20

dual transformation: (_a_) to become divorced from every element of exoteri=
c superstition and=20

priestcraft, and (_b_) to become educated men, free from every danger of be=
ing enslaved whether=20

by a man or an idea.  This, in view of the preceding, may seem paradoxical.=
 The Initiates were=20

"priests," we may be told--at any rate, all the Hindu, Egyptian, Chaldaean,=
 Greek, Phoenician, and=20

other Hierophants and Adepts were priests in the temples, and it was they w=
ho invented their=20

respective exoteric creeds. To this the answer is possible: "The cowl does =
not make the friar." If=20

one may believe tradition and the unanimous opinion of ancient writers, add=
ed to the examples we=20

have in the "priests" of India, the most conservative  "Yes and no. We shal=
l serve in a campaign,=20

seek out all sorts of adventures--return, in short, to our former life."  T=
hese last words fell on=20

Mousqueton like a thunderbolt. It was those very terrible old days that mad=
e the present so=20

excessively delightful, and the blow was so great he rushed out, overcome, =
and forgot to shut the=20

door.  The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build c=
astles in the air. The=20

good wine which Mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing dro=
ps to D'Artagnan a=20

fine perspective, shining with quadruples and pistoles, and showed to Porth=
os a blue ribbon and a=20

ducal mantle; they were, in fact, asleep on the table when the servants cam=
e to light them to their=20

bed.  Mousqueton was, however, somewhat consoled by D'Artagnan, who the nex=
t day told him=20

that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of Pari=
s and within reach of the=20

Chateau du Vallon, which was near Corbeil, or Bracieux, which was near Melu=
n, and of=20

Pierrefonds, which was between Compiegne and Villars-Cotterets.  "But--form=
erly--it appears,"=20

began Mousqueton timidly.  "Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "we don't now make war as=
 we did formerly.=20

To-day it's a sort of diplomatic arrangement; ask Planchet."  Mousqueton in=
quired, therefore, the=20

state of the case of his old friend, who confirmed the statement of D'Artag=
nan. "But," he added, "in=20

this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung."  "The deuce they do!" sai=
d Mousqueton; "I think=20

I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war, then!"  Porthos, =
meantime, asked=20

D'Artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey.  "Fo=
ur days," replied his=20

friend, "are necessary to reach Blois; one day to rest there; three or four=
 days to return to Paris.=20



Set out, therefore, in a week, with your suite, and go to the Hotel de la C=
hevrette, Rue Tiquetonne,=20

and there await me."  "That's agreed," said Porthos.  "As to myself, I shal=
l go around to see Athos;=20

for though I don't think his aid worth much, one must with one's friends ob=
serve all due=20

politeness," said D'Artagnan.  The friends then took leave of each other on=
 the very border of the=20

estate of Pierrefonds, to which Porthos escorted his friend.  "At least," D=
'Artagnan said to himself,=20

as he took the road to Villars-Cotterets, "at least I=20


_
were no more priests in the sense we give to the word than are the temple B=
rahmans. They could=20

never be regarded as such if we take as our standard the European clergy. L=
aurens observes very=20

correctly that:       The priests of Egypt were not, strictly speaking, min=
isters of     religion. The=20

word "priest," which translation has been badly     interpreted, had an acc=
eptation very different=20

from the one that     is applied to it among us. In the language of antiqui=
ty, and     especially in the=20

sense of the initiation of the priests of     ancient Egypt, the word "prie=
st" is synonymous with that=20

of     "philosopher."... The institution of the Egyptian priests seems to  =
   have been really a That=20

devil, Porthos, is a man of prodigious strength; still, if Athos joins us, =
well, we shall be three of us=20

to laugh at Aramis, that little coxcomb with his too good luck."  At Villar=
s-Cotterets he wrote to the=20

cardinal:  "My Lord,--I have already one man to offer to your eminence, and=
 he is well worth twenty=20

men. I am just setting out for Blois. The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Cas=
tle of Bragelonne, in the=20

environs of that city."     13. Two Angelic Faces.   The road was long, but=
 the horses upon which=20

D'Artagnan and Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stable=
s of the Lord of=20

Bracieux; the master and servant rode side by side, conversing as they went=
, for D'Artagnan had=20

by degrees=20


_
art of ruling men, to centre the domain of truth, modulate its     propagat=
ion, and arrest its too=20

dangerous dispersion.(493)   The Egyptian Priests, like the Brahmans of old=
, held the reins of the=20

governing powers, a system that descended to them by direct inheritance fro=
m the Initiates of the=20

great Atlantis. The pure cult of Nature in the earliest patriarchal days--t=
he word "patriarch" applying=20

in its first original sense to the Progenitors of the human race,(494) the =
Fathers, Chiefs, and=20

Instructors of primitive men--became the heirloom of those alone who could =
discern the noumenon=20

had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant. He had been raised =
by circumstances to=20

the rank of a confidant to his master. It was many years since D'Artagnan h=
ad opened his heart to=20

any one; it happened, however, that these two men, on meeting again, assimi=
lated perfectly.=20

Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures; he was a=
 man of=20

uncommonly sound sense. Without courting danger he never shrank from an enc=
ounter; in short,=20

he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man; it was, therefore, on the foo=
ting of friends that=20

D'Artagnan and Planchet arrived in the=20
