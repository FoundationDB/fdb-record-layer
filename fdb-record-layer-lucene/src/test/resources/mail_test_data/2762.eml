urned here yesterday  It would be tedious to recount all that was said at t=
hat council of war. The next brave that rose to "address the house" very mu=

except that he had chosen sky-blue for his _
dozen miles from Bath, could not estimate. He had no suspicions even then. =
How could he have?=20

How could he guess? Nevertheless when he ultimately went to bed, it was wit=
h the firm resolve=20

that he would in any case go over to Bath in the morning and remain there u=
ntil Yvonne was able=20

to come back with him.  Combwich without her was anyhow unendurable.   VI  =
He started for Bath=20

at nine o'clock in the morning. It was still raining hard. It had rained al=
l night and the roads were=20

very muddy. He started out without a groom. A little after half-past ten, h=
e drew rein outside his=20

house in Chandos Buildings, and having changed his clothes he started to wa=
lk to Laura Place.=20

The rain had momentarily left off, and a pale wintry sun peeped out through=
 rolling banks of grey=20

clouds. He went round by way of Saw Close and the Upper Borough Walls, as h=
e wanted to avoid=20

the fashionable throng that crowded the neighbourhood of the Pump Room and =
the Baths. His=20

intention was to seek out the Blakeneys at their residence in the Circus af=
ter he had seen Yvonne=20

and obtained news of M. le duc.  He had no suspicions. Why should he have? =
 The Abbey clock=20

struck a quarter-past eleven when finally he knocked at the house in Laura =
Place. Long afterwards=20

he remembered how just at that moment a dense grey mist descended into the =
valley. He had not=20

noticed it before, now he saw that it had enveloped this part of the city s=
o that he could not even=20

see clearly across the Place.  A woman came to open the door. Lord Tony but=
 this brave had,=20

among other ornamental touches to his visage, painted his nose bright red. =
 The effect on his=20

brother braves was solemnising.  It was not so impressive to his white obse=
rvers, as it suggested=20

to them the civilised toper.  "The great white chief," began Rednose, with =
a slow deliberation that=20

was meant to convey a settled and unalterable conviction, "is a fool!"  "Wa=
ugh!" exclaimed the=20

audience with emphasis, for the language was strong, and uttered with inten=
se vigour, and that=20

quite accorded with their tastes, so they agreed with the sentiment without=
 regard to its=20

signification.  This species of rhetoric, and its effects, are sometimes ob=
served in connection with=20

civilised gatherings.  The great white chief thus irreverently referred to,=
 we regret to say, was Lord=20

Selkirk.  "The great white chief," continued Rednose, availing himself of t=
he force of emphatic=20

repetition, "is a fool!  He is a child!  He knows nothing!  He comes across=
 the great salt lake from=20

the rising sun, with the air and aspect of an owl, thinking to teach us--th=
e great Cree nation--

wisdom!"  "Waugh!" from the audience, one of whom, having a cold in his hea=
d, sneezed=20

inadvertently, and was scowled at by the orator for full two minutes in abs=
olute silence.  If that=20

Cree warrior--he was on his first war-path--possessed anything akin to the =
feelings of the Paleface=20

he must have suffered martyrdom.  "Every one knows," continued the orator, =
resuming, "that the=20

Crees are wise.  They can tell a fox from a=20


_
considering how particular M. le duc always was about everything pertaining=
 to the management=20

of his household: "The house of a poor exile," he was wont to say, "but nev=
ertheless that of a=20

gentleman."  "Can I go straight up?" he asked the woman, who he thought was=
 standing=20

ostentatiously in the hall as if to bar his way. "I desire to see M. le duc=
."  "Ye can walk upstairs,=20

zir," said the woman, speaking with a broad Somersetshire accent, "but I do=
ubt me if ye'll see 'is=20

Grace the Duke. 'Es been gone these two days."  Tony had paid no heed to he=
r at first; he had=20

walked across the difference between fire and water.  No Paleface sage need=
s to come from the=20

rising sun to tell them to eat when they are hungry--to drink when they are=
 dry.  But this Paleface=20

chief comes with the eyes of the great northern owl, and says he comes to d=
o us good.  And how=20

does he begin to do us good?"  Here there was a very decided "Waugh!" as th=
ough to say, "Ay,=20

that's the question," and then a solemn pause for more--during which the ma=
n with the cold drew=20

the reins very tight.  "How does he begin to do us good?" proceeded the ora=
tor.  "By entering into=20

an agreement with _us_ for=20


_
hall to the oak staircase, and was half-way up the first flight when her la=
st words struck upon his=20

ear ... quite without meaning for the moment ... but nevertheless he paused=
, one foot on one tread,=20

and the other two treads below ... and he turned round to look at the woman=
, a swift frown across=20

his smooth forehead.  "Gone these two days," he repeated mechanically; "wha=
t do you mean?"=20

"Well! 'Is Grace left the day afore yesterday--Thursday it was.... 'Is man =
went yesterday afternoon=20

with luggage and sich ... 'e went by coach 'e did.... Leave off," she cried=
 suddenly; "what are ye=20

doin'? Ye're 'urtin' me."  For Lord Tony had rushed down the stairs again a=
nd was across the hall,=20

gripping the unoffending woman by the wrist and glaring into her expression=
less face until she=20

screamed with fright.  "I beg your pardon," he said humbly as he released h=
er wrist: all the=20

instincts of the courteous gentleman arrayed against his loss of control. "=
I ... I forgot myself for the=20

moment," he stammered; "would you mind telling me again ... what ... what y=
ou said just now?"=20

The woman was prepared to put on the airs of outraged dignity, she even gla=
nced up at the=20

malapert with scorn expressed in her small beady eyes. But at enemies the S=
aulteaux to take part=20

in that agreement!"  The sounds of indignation and ferocity that followed t=
his statement are not=20

translatable.  After a gaze of unutterable meaning round the circle Rednose=
 went on--  "This,=20

_this_ is the way in which the owl-eyed chief of the Palefaces begins to do=
 us good!  If this is the=20

way he begins, in what way will he continue, and,"--here his voice deepened=
 to a whisper--"_how=20

will he end_?"  The ideas suggested by his question were so appalling that =
for some minutes the=20

orator appeared unable to find words to go on, and his audience glared at h=
im in dread=20

anticipation, as though they expected him to explode like a bomb-shell, but=
 were prepared to sit it=20

out and take the consequences.  And he did explode, after a fashion, for he=
 suddenly raised his=20

voice to a shout that startled even the sentinel on the distant knoll, and =
said--  "I counsel war to the=20

knife!  The great white chief--the owl-eyed fool!--will not blot from our a=
greement the names of the=20

Saulteaux chiefs--chiefs! there are no Saulteaux chiefs.  All their braves =
are cowards, on the same=20

dead level of stupidity, and their women are--are nothing, fit for nothing,=
 can do nothing, and must=20

soon come to nothing!=20


_
her. Lord Tony was white to the lips, his cheeks were the colour of dead as=
hes, his mouth=20

trembled, his eyes alone glowed with ill-repressed anxiety.  "'Is Grace," s=
he said with slow=20

emphasis, for of a truth she thought that the young gentleman was either si=
ck or daft, "'Is Grace=20

left this 'ouse the day afore yesterday in a hired barouche. 'Is man--Frede=
rick--went yesterday=20

afternoon with the What then?  The duty of Cree warriors lies before us.  W=
e will drive the=20

Saulteaux into Lake Winnipeg and the Palefaces off the face of the earth al=
together!  Waugh!"=20

Having thus given vent to the opinions and feelings that consumed him, Redn=
ose sat down, his=20

audience breathed freely, the distant sentinel recovered his composure, and=
 the young novitiate=20

brave with the cold in his head sneezed with=20
