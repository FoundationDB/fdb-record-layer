philodendron monstera One penn'orth of your most shining note, and two envelopes to match. Mind you, give me a paper with a good gloss on it, Mrs. Jones."  Mrs. Jones stared at Hannah Martin; but fetching down a box of note-paper, prepared to wrap some sheets in tissue paper.  "I shouldn't say Miss Primrose was ill," philodendron monstera One penn'orth of your most shining note, and two envelopes to match. Mind you, give me a paper with a good gloss on it, Mrs. Jones."

up, and tried to help them, after their mother's death; but who was the Prince?  Finding that the 

child continued slightly feverish, and most unnaturally weak--finding that the dainties she prepared 

were only just tasted by the little sufferer--Hannah looked well into her little store of hardly-earned 

money, and finding that she had sufficient to pay him, called in the village doctor.  Of were dark 

and out of the way, against your will. Do you expect me to believe that?"  Elizabeth came between 

the men as the minister took a step toward the Elder.  "I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I came 

here of my own accord, and you have no right to spy on me through those who are willing to do 

such vulgar things because you pay them. I came here to see Uncle Josiah. He wasn't in, and

understand Daisy's case. He ordered medicine for her, and plenty of cooling drinks, and said that 

he could not find anything very much the matter, only she was most unnaturally weak.  "It's my 

thinking, sir," said Hannah, "that this is the kind of weakness that ends in death. My little lady is all 

on the pine for something or some one, and unless she gets what she wants soon she  "That will 

do! You shall not add perjury to your sin. You knew perfectly well that Pott was not home. You 

knew he was in the city. Your stories don't hang together."  "Father, you must not talk to me like 

that. Uncle Josiah came home this morning, and I made arrangements to meet him here to-night." 

"And he was conveniently out, I suppose, so you might meet this fellow here

considered her from that day forward a very fanciful woman. He repeated his injunctions to give 

Daisy plenty of milk, and to see that she took her tonic three times a day; and then he took his 

leave.  When he was gone Hannah went to her next-door neighbor and asked her if she would be 

so very kind as to go and sit in the child's room for a couple of hours. Then she put on her bonnet 

and neat black cloak, and started off on foot to Rosebury. She had made up her mind to get Mrs. 

Ellsworthy's address from some one, and to write to her about Daisy. In due time she arrived at 

the lodge, saw the woman who kept the gates, obtained from her without much difficulty Mrs. 

Ellsworthy's address, and then prepared to return home. Just as she reached the  "If you refuse to 

listen to reason, you may think what you like. I love that man you've been maligning!" she cried, 

her eyes filling with angry tears.  "You love him? Are you brazen enough to stand there and say 

that to my face?" he shouted, losing his self-control. "Him! You! I've a mind----Why, you silly little 

sentimental fool. You go so far as to flaunt----"  "Mr. Fox, allow me to explain," interrupted the 

minister.  The Elder did not heed the note of warning in the steady voice, but clutching his walking-

stick with nervous fingers he started toward his daughter.  "Stand back!"  Mr. Fox stood back, 

almost falling against the wall. The minister's voice was as hard as his own.  "It seems that the 

time has come for a reckoning," said Mr. McGowan. "You have stood in my way long enough. 

Elizabeth, will you kindly step into my study?"  "I

thought struck her--she had no writing-paper in the house, and what could be bought at Teckford 

was almost too bad to use. Hannah made up her mind to go to Rosebury, which was a much more 

important village than Teckford, and get a few sheets of note-paper, and an envelope or  "What I 

say may be quite unpleasant."  "I may need to add to what you say. I'll stay."  "Very well. Mr. Fox, 

our strained relations must come to an end. If you can show any just cause why I'm at fault, I shall

wife knew Hannah, and greeted her with effusion.  "I'm truly pleased to see you, Mrs. Martin," she 

said. "Why you're quite a stranger in these parts, and I did not expect to see you round now, with 

one of your young ladies returned and all."  Hannah heaved a profound sigh.  "She's very, very ill, 

poor darling," she said. "Very dangerously weak and me, but----"  "You lie, sir!"  The minister's lips 

tightened. "Only your age protects you in the use of that word to me. I repeat what I have said,--

and it will be as well for you not to question my integrity again,--I do not know why you have 

treated me as you have. I now demand an explanation."  "If you will favor us with a little of your 

family history first," said the Elder with a sneering laugh, "there will be no need of any further
