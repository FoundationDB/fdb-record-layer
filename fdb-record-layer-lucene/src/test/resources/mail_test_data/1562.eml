Mrs. Haggard with a smile.  "If I were a vain man I should confess that the=
y rather gave themselves away."  "Much as Hanibal Peter Gray did for love o=

on the hearth.  There=20

was a silence.  Gradually Haggard raised his eyes; they rested on his wife,=
 they took her in from=20

head to foot, and seemed to appraise each of her numerous points. The husba=

was lighted up by a pleased expression.  "By Jove! Georgie," he said, "peop=

are an uncommonly fine woman."  He kissed her.  It was the kiss of propriet=

Yes, Georgie loved the man, and looked up at him with wistful, trusting eye=

Lucy Warrender, as she entered the room.  "I fear it was rather a tragedy t=

table.  "Oh, they were very confidential, you know," lisped Spunyarn; "I wa=
