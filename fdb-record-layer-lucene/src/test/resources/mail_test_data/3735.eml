hs _
where he excitedly gasped out his adventure to wide-eyed listeners, while B=
lack Bruin fled as far=20

as he could into the deep woods, to nurse his many wounds.  There was littl=
e, however, that he=20

could do.  The wounds were not dangerous, but they burned and smarted as th=
ough a whole=20

swarm of bees had penetrated his thick coat and found the skin beneath.  He=
 spent the better part=20

of the day lying in a cooling stream, waiting for the burning and smarting =
to cease.  He had now=20

added one more to the list of his sad experiences in the wild.  The man-sce=
nt was dangerous and=20

henceforth he must flee at the slightest suspicion of the proximity of man.=
  The rank sulphurous=20

smell of gunpowder, too, and the roar, like thunder, that echoed away throu=
gh the cavernous=20

woods, were things that he would remember.  Man, who he had thought was qui=
te harmless, was=20

a terrible enemy who could sting him in a thousand places at once, and shak=
e the forest with=20

thunder and lightning.  Even while Black Bruin lay wallowing in the stream,=
 trying to ease the=20

burning shotgun wounds, there was being planned in the near-by village a be=
ar-hunt that should=20

bring about his destruction, for the excited hunter had described a monster=
 as large as a cow.=20

CHAPTER X  THE GREAT BEAR-HUNT  The hair-raising story that the young squir=
rel-hunter told,=20

created quite an excitement among villagers near by, but on second consider=
ation the older and=20

wiser heads were inclined to discredit it. The imaginative Nimrod had proba=
bly seen a black stump=20

or dark moss-covered rock, which, in the excitement of the moment, he did n=
ot stop to investigate.=20

He had fired upon the instant and then fled without taking further inventor=
y of the place.  It was=20

doubtless one of those hallucinations that are so common in the woods.  Bea=
rs had not been=20

plentiful in the region for several years, so at first the story was discre=
dited.  About a week later=20

Grandpa Hezekiah Butterfield, one of the old men of the village, went about=
 a mile into the country=20

to a farmhouse to take supper with an old crony and to talk over old times.=
  As is usual when two=20

grandpas get to talking over old times, Grandpa Butterfield stayed much lat=
er than he intended,=20

starting for home at about eight o'clock.  But when he went, he felt well r=
epaid for his visit,=20

because he had completely out-talked his companion and moreover was carryin=
g back a present=20

of five pounds of honey, which, as the old man had a sweet tooth, the only =
tooth he had, was most=20

acceptable.  Just after leaving the farmhouse, the way led through a deep w=
oods which overhung=20

the road, making it quite dark in places.  It happened that on this same ev=
ening Black Bruin went=20

forth on one of his nightly prowls.  It was a moonlight night and the wood-=
mice were out in force,=20

scampering about and squeaking, having the finest kind of a play.  In the c=
ourse of his stalking this=20

small game, Black Bruin came to within a few rods of the road.  He was snif=
fing about an old log=20

which smelled strongly of mice when a fresh puff of the wind brought him a =
strong man-scent.  At=20

this dread odor the hair rose upon his neck and fear told him to slip quiet=
ly away in the opposite=20

direction from which the scent came.  He was about to obey this instinct wh=
en the wind again=20

freshened and a new odor filled his nostrils.  It was not as strong as the =
man-scent and it did not=20

fill him with fear, but with delight.  It made his mouth drip saliva and fi=
lled him with an insatiate=20

craving for something, he could not remember just what.  Then the old sweet=
 smell, that was to=20

him what whisky is to the drunkard, brought back a familiar picture.  It wa=
s of a farmhouse with=20

barns and many out-buildings.  There were hens, ducks and turkeys in the ya=
rd and back of the=20

house was a row of beehives that always emitted this ravishing odor.  It wa=
s honey, and at the=20

realization Black Bruin could almost hear the low droning of the hive, or t=
he angry zip, zip of the=20

bees about his ears as he robbed them.  Again the night-wind brought the ma=
n-scent and the=20



smell of honey.  The former filled him with fear and the latter with deligh=
t.  Again and again he=20

tested the wind, weighing the two odors, and at last the honey conquered.  =
The man might fill him=20

with thorns and prickers from his thunder and lightning stick, but he must =
have some of that honey.=20

Grandpa Butterfield was walking leisurely along humming a psalm tune, as wa=
s his wont when=20

well pleased with the world, when he thought he heard something behind him =
in the road.  He=20

stopped and listened, but all was still.  Only the usual night-sounds came =
to his ears.  But when he=20

moved on, he felt sure that the footsteps again followed.  At last he reach=
ed a point where the=20

moonlight fell across the road. He now felt quite sure that something was c=
oming after him but=20

what, he could not imagine.  Feeling curious, and a bit uneasy, for the roa=
d was a lonely one, he=20

turned and looked behind and there, in the full moonlight, not forty feet a=
way, he beheld a huge=20

black bear following surely in his footsteps.  There was no deceiving his e=
ye.  He had seen too=20

many bears in days gone by.  Grandpa Butterfield quickened his walk to a tr=
ot, which in a dozen=20

steps he increased to as lively a run as a man of seventy years could muste=
r.  Black Bruin, feeling,=20

now that the man was running, he was afraid of him, and seeing his precious=
 honey rapidly=20

moving away down the road, went in hot pursuit.  By the time the old man ha=
d covered a hundred=20

feet, his breath came in quick asthmatic gasps.  Craning his stiff neck to =
see if he had distanced=20

his pursuer, he saw to his horror that the bear was not twenty feet behind =
him.  Terror now lent=20

wings to his rheumatic old legs, and he sprinted another hundred feet in mu=
ch quicker time than=20

he had the first.  But Black Bruin now felt sure that the honey was his.  T=
he man creature was=20

clearly afraid of him, so he too increased his pace.  Poor Grandpa Butterfi=
eld could almost feel the=20

bear's hot breath upon his back as he ran.  Ten seconds more, he told himse=
lf, and he would be in=20

the clutches of this brute.  His obituary and the account of his tragic dea=
th would surely be in the=20

county paper next week.  Suddenly his half-paralyzed brain was electrified =
by a thought.  It was=20

the honey that the bear was after, and not him.  Who ever heard of a bear w=
anting to eat an old=20

dried-up man, who was as tough as leather?  Without a second's delay he pit=
ched the honey into=20

the road behind him, and continued his frantic flight.  A few rods farther =
on, feeling that he was no=20

longer pursued, he glanced back just long enough to see the bear tearing th=
e paper from the=20

package and licking out the honey.  That evening at the country grocery the=
 bear-story of the=20

squirrel-hunter was amply corroborated by Grandpa Butterfield, who was so w=
inded and spent=20

with running that he could barely gasp out his disconnected account of the =
chase through the=20

woods.  The next morning, with Grandpa Butterfield as a guide, several men =
went over the=20

ground, where there was plenty of evidence to substantiate the old man's st=
ory.  The empty=20

honey-frames were there, and the bear-tracks told as plainly as words that =
a bear, of unusual size,=20

had given the old man the run of his life through the woods.  Grandpa Butte=
rfield was the hero of=20

the village, both for that day and several following, and the long-talked-o=
f bear-hunt was at once=20

organized.  There was but one rifle in the village, and that was a 38-55 Wi=
nchester, the property of=20

the young hunter from the city, who had filled Black Bruin's coat with squi=
rrel-shot.  So old rusty=20

shotguns were got out and cleaned up in readiness for the fray.  Some of th=
em had not seen=20

service recently, with the exception of once or twice a year, when they wer=
e used to scare off the=20

crows or to frighten a woodchuck which was making too free with the beans. =
 Boys hunted up old=20

rusty bullet-moulds and ran bullets, and the shotguns were loaded with slug=
s and buckshot.=20

Those who were not fortunate enough even to possess a disreputable old gun,=
 armed themselves=20



with pitchforks, so that altogether it was a motley armed party that starte=
d out one early October=20

morning to annihilate Black Bruin.  The dogs comprising the pack were half-=
breed hounds and=20

beagles, with two or three pure-blood foxhounds.  By rare good fortune a fa=
rmer, coming into town=20

early, had seen the bear crossing the road ahead of his team, so that the d=
ogs could be shown the=20

trail at once.  But when the hunters pointed out the hand-shaped track in t=
he road and said "seek,"=20

the hair rose upon the dogs' backs and they stuck their tails between their=
 legs and interpreted=20

"seek," as meaning that they were to seek their own homes by the shortest p=
ath.  This new rank=20

animal scent had no attraction for them.  They had not lost any bear. In ot=
her words, they would=20

not follow.  Here was a difficulty that the hunters had not foreseen, and f=
or a time it looked as=20

though the hunt was doomed to end then and there.  Finally some one in the =
party said, "We=20

ought to have taken along Ben Holcome's Growler.  Growler ain't afraid of t=
he devil himself."=20

Growler was a mongrel, half-hound and half-bulldog.  He had not nose enough=
 to follow alone, but=20

as had been said, he wasn't afraid of anything.  So as there was nothing el=
se to do, a boy was=20

sent cross-lots after Growler, while the hunters waited impatiently.  Growl=
er and the boy at last put=20

in an appearance, and the mongrel was shown the bear-track in the road.  Gr=
owler's hair likewise=20

rose up on his neck, but his lips also parted in a snarl and he started off=
 on the fresh track, uttering=20

excited yelps.  Growler thought he scented a good fight ahead, and he would=
 rather chew on a=20

good adversary any day than upon a piece of beefsteak.  Seeing what was exp=
ected of them, and=20

made courageous by Growler's example, the under a week, but even then Mr. P=
hoebus or some=20

one else might be there. The world seemed dark. He wished he had never gone=
 to Oxford.=20

However a man may plan his life, he is the creature of circumstances. The u=
nforeseen happens=20

and upsets every thing. We are mere puppets.  He sat next to an agreeable w=
oman at dinner, who=20

gave him an interesting account of a new singer she had heard the night bef=
ore at the opera=E2=80=94a=20

fair Scandinavian, fresh as a lily and sweet as a nightingale.  =E2=80=9CI =
was resolved to go and hear her,=E2=80=9D=20

said the lady; =E2=80=9Cmy sister Feodore, at Paris, had written to me so m=
uch about her. Do you know, I=20

have never been to the opera for an age! That alone was quite a treat to me=
. I never go to the=20

opera, nor to the play, nor to any thing else. Society has become so large =
and so exacting, that I=20

have found out one never gets any amusement.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo you know=
, I never was at the opera?=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI am not at all surprised; and when you go=E2=80=94which=
 I suppose you will some day=E2=80=94what=20

will most strike you is, that you will not see a single person you ever saw=
 in your life.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CStrange!=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CYes; it shows what a mass of wealth and taste and refinement there=
 is in this wonderful=20

metropolis of ours, quite irrespective of the circles in which we move, and=
 which we once thought=20

entirely engrossed them.=E2=80=9D  After the ladies had retired, Bertram, w=
ho dined at the same house,=20

moved up to him; and Hugo Bohun came over and took the vacant seat on his o=
ther side.  =E2=80=9CWhat=20

have you been doing with yourself?=E2=80=9D said Hugo. =E2=80=9CWe have not=
 seen you for a week.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI went down=20

to Oxford about some horses,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CFancy going d=
own to Oxford about some horses in=20

the heart of the season,=E2=80=9D said Hugo. =E2=80=9CI believe you are sel=
ling us, and that, as the Scorpion=20

announces, you are going to be married.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo whom?=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CAh! that is the point. It is a=20

dark horse at present, and we want you to tell us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy d=
o not you marry, Hugo?=E2=80=9D said Bertram.=20

=E2=80=9CI respect the institution,=E2=80=9D said Hugo, =E2=80=9Cwhich is a=
dmitting something in these days; and I have=20

always thought that every woman should marry, and no man.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CIt makes a woman and it mars a=20

man, you think?=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CBut I do not exactly see h=
ow your view would work practically,=E2=80=9D=20



said Bertram.  =E2=80=9CWell my view is a social problem,=E2=80=9D said Hug=
o, =E2=80=9Cand social problems are the fashion=20

at present. It would be solved through the exceptions, which prove the prin=
ciple. In the first place,=20

there are your swells who cannot avoid the halter=E2=80=94you are booked wh=
en you are born; and then=20

there are moderate men like myself, who have their weak moments. I would no=
t answer for myself=20

if I could find an affectionate family with good shooting and first-rate cl=
aret.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere must be many=20

families with such conditions,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  Hugo shook his head.=
 =E2=80=9CYou try. Sometimes the wine is=20

good and the shooting bad; sometimes the reverse; sometimes both are excell=
ent, but then the=20

tempers and the manners are equally bad.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI vote we three=
 do something to-morrow,=E2=80=9D said=20

Bertram.  =E2=80=9CWhat shall it be?=E2=80=9D said Hugo.  =E2=80=9CI vote w=
e row down to Richmond at sunset and dine, and=20

then drive our teams up by moonlight. What say you, Lothair?=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI cannot, I am engaged. I am=20

engaged to go to the opera.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CFancy going to the opera in =
this sweltering weather!=E2=80=9D exclaimed=20

Bertram.  =E2=80=9CHe must be going to be married,=E2=80=9D said Hugo.  And=
 yet on the following evening, though=20

the weather was quite as sultry and he was not going to be married, to the =
opera Lothair went.=20

While the agreeable lady the day before was dilating at dinner on this once=
 famous entertainment,=20

Lothair remembered that a certain person went there every Saturday evening,=
 and he resolved=20

that he should at least have the satisfaction of seeing her.  It was altoge=
ther a new scene for=20

Lothair, and, being much affected by music, he found the general influence =
so fascinating that=20

some little time elapsed before he was sufficiently master of himself to re=
cur to the principal=20

purpose of his presence. His box was on the first tier, where he could obse=
rve very generally and=20

yet himself be sufficiently screened. As an astronomer surveys the starry h=
eavens until his=20

searching sight reaches the desired planet, so Lothair=E2=80=99s scrutinizi=
ng vision wandered till his eye at=20

length lighted on the wished-for orb. In the circle above his own, opposite=
 to him but nearer the=20

stage, he recognized the Campians. She had a star upon her forehead, as whe=
n he first met her=20

some six months ago; it seemed an age.  Now what should he do? He was quite=
 unlearned in the=20

social habits of an opera-house. He was not aware that he had the privilege=
 of paying the lady a=20

visit in her box, and, had he been so, he was really so shy in little thing=
s that he never could have=20

summoned resolution to open the door of his own box and request an attendan=
t to show him that=20

of Mrs. Campian. He had contrived to get to the opera for the first time in=
 his life, and the effort=20

seemed to have exhausted his social enterprise. So he remained still, with =
his glass fixed very=20

constantly on Mrs. Campian, and occasionally giving himself up to the scene=
. The performance did=20

not sustain the first impression. There were rival prima-donnas, and they i=
ndulged in competitive=20

screams; the choruses were coarse, and the orchestra much too noisy. But th=
e audience were=20

absorbed or enthusiastic. We may be a musical nation, but our taste would s=
eem to require some=20

refinement.  There was a stir in Mrs. Campian=E2=80=99s box: a gentleman en=
tered and seated himself.=20

Lothair concluded he was an invited guest, and envied him. In about a quart=
er of an hour the=20

gentleman bowed and retired, and another person came in, and one whom Lotha=
ir recognized as=20

a young man who had been sitting during the first act in a stall beneath hi=
m. The system of paying=20

visits at the opera then flashed upon his intelligence, as some discovery i=
n science upon a painful=20

observer. Why should he not pay a visit too? But how to do it? At last he w=
as bold enough to open=20

the door of his own box and go forth, but he could find no attendant, and s=
ome persons passing=20

his open door, and nearly appropriating his lodge, in a fit of that nervous=
 embarrassment which=20

attends inexperience in little things, he secured his rights by returning b=
affled to his post.  There=20



had been a change in Mrs. Campian=E2=80=99s box in the interval. Colonel Ca=
mpian had quitted it, and Mr.=20

Phoebus occupied his place. Whether it were disappointment at his own failu=
re or some other=20

cause, Lothair felt annoyed. He was hot and cold by turns; felt awkward and=
 blundering; fancied=20

people were looking at him; that in some inexplicable sense he was ridiculo=
us; wished he had=20

never gone to the opera.  As time, and considerable time, elapsed, he becam=
e even miserable.=20

Mr. Phoebus never moved, and Mrs. Campian frequently conversed with him. Mo=
re than one=20

visitor had in the interval paid their respects to the lady, but Mr. Phoebu=
s never moved. They did=20

not stay, perhaps because Mr. Phoebus never moved.  Lothair never liked tha=
t fellow from the=20

first. Sympathy and antipathy share our being as day and darkness share our=
 lives. Lothair had felt=20

an antipathy for Mr. Phoebus the moment he saw him. He had arrived at Belmo=
nt yesterday=20

before Lothair, and he had outstayed him. These might be Arian principles, =
but they were not the=20

principles of good-breeding.  Lothair determined to go home, and never to c=
ome to the opera=20

again. He opened the door of his box with firmness, and slammed it with cou=
rage; he had quite=20

lost his shyness, was indeed ready to run a muck with any one who crossed h=
im. The slamming of=20

the door summoned a scudding attendant from a distant post, who with breath=
less devotion=20

inquired whether Lothair wanted any thing.  =E2=80=9CYes, I want you to sho=
w me the way to Mrs.=20

Campian=E2=80=99s box.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTier above, No. 22,=E2=80=9D said=
 the box-keeper.  =E2=80=9CAy, ay; but conduct me to it,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, and he presented the man with an overpowering honorarium.  =E2=80=
=9CCertainly, my lord,=E2=80=9D said=20

the attendant.  =E2=80=9CHe knows me,=E2=80=9D thought Lothair; but it was =
not so. When the British nation is at=20

once grateful and enthusiastic, they always call you =E2=80=9Cmy lord.=E2=
=80=9D  But in his progress, to =E2=80=9CNo. 22, tier=20

above,=E2=80=9D all his valor evaporated, and when the box-door was opened =
he felt very much like a=20

convict on the verge of execution; he changed color, his legs tottered, his=
 heart beat, and he made=20

his bow with a confused vision. The serenity of Theodora somewhat reassured=
 him, and he seated=20

himself, and even saluted Mr. Phoebus.  The conversation was vapid and conv=
entional=E2=80=94remarks=20

about the opera and its performers=E2=80=94even the heat of the weather was=
 mentioned. Lothair had=20

come, and he had nothing to say. Mrs. Campian seemed much interested in the=
 performance; so,=20

if he had had any thing to say, there was no opportunity of expressing it. =
She had not appeared to=20

be so engrossed with the music before his arrival. In the mean time that Ph=
oebus would not move;=20

a quarter of an hour elapsed, and that Phoebus would not move. Lothair coul=
d not stand it any=20

longer; he rose and bowed.  =E2=80=9CAre you going?=E2=80=9D said Theodora.=
 =E2=80=9CColonel Campian will be here in a=20

moment; he will be quite grieved not to see you.=E2=80=9D  But Lothair was =
inflexible. =E2=80=9CPerhaps,=E2=80=9D she added,=20

=E2=80=9Cwe may see you to-morrow night?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNever,=E2=80=9D=
 said Lothair to himself, as he clinched his teeth; =E2=80=9Cmy=20

visit to Belmont was my first and my last. The dream is over.=E2=80=9D  He =
hurried to a club in which he had=20

been recently initiated, and of which the chief purpose is to prove to mank=
ind that night to a wise=20

man has its resources as well as gaudy day. Here striplings mature their mi=
nds in the mysteries of=20

whist, and stimulate their intelligence by playing at stakes which would ma=
ke their seniors look=20

pale; here matches are made; and odds are settled, and the cares or enterpr=
ises of life are=20

soothed or stimulated by fragrant cheroots or beakers of=20


_
in earnest.  Black Bruin heard them almost at the outset, where he was digg=
ing roots in the deep=20

woods, and for some reason the sounds annoyed him.  He knew they were made =
by dogs, for he=20

had often heard the old hound Hecla at the farmhouse running rabbits in the=
 near-by swamp.  But=20

here, there were half-a-dozen hounds instead of one, and their baying was f=
airly Here, in the=20

society of the listless and freakish St. Aldegonde, and Hugo Bohun, and Ber=
tram, and other=20

congenial spirits, Lothair consigned to oblivion the rival churches of Chri=
stendom, the Aryan race,=20

and the genius of Semitism.  It was an hour past dawn when he strolled home=
. London is often=20

beautiful in summer at that hour, the architectural lines clear and=20


_
Finally, the pack entered the woods not forty rods away, and Black Bruin be=
gan to get uneasy.  At=20

last it dawned upon him, as the pack drew still nearer and nearer, that; th=
ey were upon his track.=20

This thought filled him with both fear and rage.  What did these curs want =
of him?  Had he not=20

killed a dog that was worrying him, while with Pedro, with a single blow?  =
So he crouched in a=20

thicket and waited expectantly.  He had not long to wait, for in fifteen se=
conds the pack came up.=20

When they discovered the bear so near at hand, however, and saw what menaci=
ng game they had=20

been running, the hounds all slunk back to a safe distance, and sat on thei=
r tails.  But not so=20

Growler.  Here was the scrap of his life with an animal three times as larg=
e as the big=20

Newfoundland, whom he was in the habit of worrying.  So he rushed into the =
thicket and sprang at=20

Black Bruin's throat.  [Illustration: GROWLER SPRANG AT BLACK BRUIN'S THROA=
T]  But quick=20

as he was, he was not as quick as his adversary, who ripped open the side o=
f his head with a=20

lucky blow, and stretched him gasping upon the ground.  Black Bruin then re=
ached down and=20

biting the kicking dog through the neck, finished his troubles in short ord=
er.  Growler uttered one=20

agonized cry, and stretched out dead.  This was enough for the rest of the =
pack, all of whom stuck=20

their tails between their legs from gardened balconies wafted in the blue a=
ir. Nothing is stirring=20

except wagons of strawberries and asparagus, and no one visible except a po=
liceman or a=20

member of Parliament returning from a late division, where they have settle=
d some great question=20

that need never have been asked. Eve has its spell of calmness and consolat=
ion, but dawn brings=20

hope and joy.  But not to Lothair. Young, sanguine, and susceptible, he had=
, for a moment, yielded=20

to the excitement of the recent scene, but with his senses stilled by the m=
orning air, and free from=20

the influence of Bertram=E2=80=99s ready sympathy, and Hugo Bohun=E2=80=99s=
 gay comments on human life, and=20

all the wild and amusing caprice, and daring wilfulness, and grand affectat=
ion, that distinguish and=20

inspire a circle of patrician youth, there came over him the consciousness =
that to him something=20

dark had occurred, something bitter and disappointing and humiliating, and =
that the breaking morn=20

would not bring to him a day so bright and hopeful as his former ones.  At =
first he fell into profound=20

slumber: it was the inevitable result of the Badminton and the late hour. T=
here was a certain=20

degree of physical exhaustion which commanded repose. But the slumber was n=
ot long, and his=20

first feeling, for it could not be called thought, was that some great misf=
ortune had occurred to him;=20

and then the thought following the=20


_
Hearing the cries of men near at hand, Black Bruin slunk out of the thicket=
 and off into the deep=20

woods, but not soon enough to escape a fusillade of buckshot which whizzed =
about him as he ran,=20

a few of them biting deep into his flesh.  But he was soon lost to sight, a=
nd as the pack would not=20

follow, now that Growler was no more, the hunt was finally abandoned for th=
at day.  The next day=20

a bulldog and a bull terrier were procured to take the place of Growler, an=
d the hunt was resumed.=20

But being made wary by this experience, Black Bruin "laid low" and they cou=
ld not start him.  Each=20

morning for three days they scoured the country, beating the woods and loos=
ing the hounds at all=20

points where the bear had been recently seen, but without success.  The fou=
rth morning a farmer=20

came to town in great haste.  The bear had killed a calf the night before a=
nd he had discovered the=20

partly eaten carcass buried in the woods near by.  Here was the bait that w=
ould lure the thief into=20

their hands.  So hunters and hounds went at once to the carcass, where a ra=
ther fresh trail was=20

found.  Half an hour's pursuit again routed out the bear. Once he took to t=
he open, and the young=20

hunter from the city with the Winchester sent a bullet through his paw, lam=
ing him considerably.=20

This would never do, so he doubled back to the woods.  He did not fear this=
 yelping, baying pack=20

as he did the men that were also following him.  He now knew that the thund=
er and lightning that=20

they carried could bite and sting as nothing else could.  For half an hour =
Black Bruin ran hither and=20

thither, doubling in and out.  Finally he remembered his tree-climbing habi=
t and in an evil moment=20

clambered up a tall spruce.  In five minutes' time after he scratched up th=
e tree, men and dogs had=20

surrounded his foolish refuge, and his fate seemed sealed.  The last of the=
 party to arrive was the=20

young man with the Winchester, for whom all had been waiting.  One shot fro=
m him would end the=20

hunt.  They discovered Black Bruin about thirty feet from the ground in a t=
hick whorl of limbs.  The=20

young rifleman was much excited.  This would be his first bear. His name wo=
uld be in the local=20

paper, and he would have a great story to tell when he got back to the city=
.  Experience would=20

have taught him to draw his bead finer than he did, and also to have lowere=
d his rear sight, which=20

was set for two hundred yards; but taking careless aim, and thinking he cou=
ld not miss at such=20

short range, he pressed the trigger.  There was a sharp crack from the rifl=
e, and the bullet=20

ploughed a deep wound in Black Bruin's scalp, but glanced from his thick sk=
ull and went singing=20

through the tree-tops.  The blow of the bullet upon the skull dazed the bea=
r for a moment, and he=20

loosed his hold and came tumbling down through the interlaced limbs.  But t=
he hard bump that he=20

got at the foot of the tree, brought him to his senses with a jerk.  Right =
among the yelping, snarling=20

pack he had fallen, and in sheer desperation he struck out right and left. =
 Two of the hounds went=20

yelping to the rear.  Then an excited boy leveled a double-barreled shotgun=
 at the bear and=20

discharged both barrels.  At the same instant the best hound in the pack ju=
mped into range and=20

rolled over kicking upon the ground.  He had received the full charge.  Hal=
f-blinded and dazed by=20

the blow upon his head, and made frantic by the yelping of the pack, the sh=
outs of the men and=20

the roar of their thunder, Black Bruin put all his remaining strength into =
flight.  Not knowing or=20

seeing which way he went, he fled straight toward the hunter with the Winch=
ester with mouth wide=20

open.  Horrified at the sight, which the hunter interpreted as a desperate =
charge upon the part of=20

the bear, the city Nimrod delivered one wild shot and then fled for his lif=
e, as he thought.  This=20

stampeded feeling brought up the form of the hated Phoebus. After that he h=
ad no real sleep, but=20

a sort of occasional and feverish doze with intervals of infinite distress,=
 waking always to a=20

consciousness of inexpressible mortification and despair.  About one o=E2=
=80=99clock, relinquishing all=20



hope of real and refreshing slumber, he rang his bell, and his valet appear=
ing informed him that=20

Father Coleman had called, and the monsignore had called, and that now the =
cardinal=E2=80=99s secretary=20

had just called, but the valet had announced that his lord was indisposed. =
There was also a letter=20

from Lady St. Jerome. This news brought a new train of feeling. Lothair rem=
embered that this was=20

the day of the great ecclesiastical function, under the personal auspices o=
f the cardinal, at which=20

indeed Lothair hid never positively promised to assist, his presence at whi=
ch he had sometimes=20

thought they pressed unreasonably, not to say even indelicately, but at whi=
ch he had perhaps led=20

them, not without cause, to believe that he would be present. Of late the m=
onsignore had assumed=20

that Lothair had promised to attend it.  Why should he not? The world was a=
ll vanity. Never did he=20

feel more convinced than at this moment of the truth of his conclusion, tha=
t if religion were a real=20

thing, man should live for it alone; but then came the question of the Chur=
ches. He could not bring=20

himself without a pang to contemplate a secession from the Church of his fa=
thers. He took refuge=20

in the wild but beautiful thought of a reconciliation between Rome and Engl=
and. If the consecration=20

of the whole of his fortune to that end could assist in effecting the purpo=
se, he would cheerfully=20

make the sacrifice. He would then go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre,=
 and probably=20

conclude his days in a hermitage on Mount Athos.  In the mean time he rose,=
 and, invigorated by=20

his bath, his thoughts became in a slight degree more mundane. They recurre=
d to the events of=20

the last few days of his life, but in a spirit of self-reproach and of cons=
cious vanity and weakness.=20

Why, he had not known her a week! This was Sunday morning, and last Sunday =
he had attended=20

St. Mary=E2=80=99s and offered up his earnest supplications for the unity o=
f Christendom. That was then his=20

sovereign hope and thought. Singular that a casual acquaintance with a stra=
nger, a look, a glance,=20

a word, a nothing, should have so disturbed his spirit and distracted his m=
ind.  And yet=E2=80=94  And=20

then he fell into an easy-chair, with a hair-brush in either hand, and conj=
ured up in reverie all that=20

had passed since that wondrous morn when he addressed her by the road-side,=
 until the last dark=20

hour when they parted=E2=80=94and forever. There was not a word she had utt=
ered to him, or to any one=20

else, that he did not recall; not a glance, not a gesture=E2=80=94her dress=
, her countenance, her voice, her=20

hair. And what scenes had all this passed in! What refined and stately love=
liness! Blenheim, and=20

Oxford, and Belmont! They became her. Ah! why could not life consist of the=
 perpetual society of=20

such delightful people in such delightful places?  His valet entered and in=
formed him that the=20

monsignore had returned, and would not be denied. Lothair roused himself fr=
om his delicious=20

reverie, and his countenance became anxious and disquieted. He would have s=
truggled against=20

the intrusion, and was murmuring resistance to his hopeless attendant, who =
shook his head, when=20

the monsignore glided into the room without permission, as the valet disapp=
eared.  It was a=20

wonderful performance: the monsignore had at the same time to make a reconn=
oissance and to=20

take up a position=E2=80=94to find out what Lothair intended to do, and yet=
 to act and speak as if he was=20

acquainted with those intentions, and was not only aware of, but approved t=
hem. He seemed=20

hurried and yet tranquil, almost breathless with solicitude and=20


_
their legs could carry them until they left the spot far behind.  It was a =
question whether the frantic=20

beast tried harder to get away from the hunters, or they from him.  In the =
village grocery the stories=20

that were told that night made the small boy's hair stand up with fright an=
d his blood run cold with=20

fear.  As for Black Bruin, with his wounded paw upon which he limped painfu=
lly, and with his=20

bleeding scalp, he concluded that the part of the country in which he had m=
ade his home for=20

several months, was no place for him, so before another sunrise he put many=
 miles between=20

himself and the scene of his narrow escape from the hunters.  Nor did this =
one night's journey=20

calm his fear.  Night after night he fled, always going in the same directi=
on, which, as he fled=20

northward, carried him farther and farther into the wilderness.  At last in=
 a wild country of rugged=20

mountains and deep, thickly wooded valleys, where the habitat of man seemed=
 far distant, he=20

ceased his flight.  There in the times hushed, but to-day he spoke in a whi=
sper, though a whisper=20

of emphasis, and the dark eyes of his delicate aristocratic visage peered i=
nto Lothair, even when=20

he was making a remark which seemed to require no scrutiny.  =E2=80=9CIt is=
 one of the most important=20

days for England that have happened in our time,=E2=80=9D said the monsigno=
re. =E2=80=9CLady St. Jerome thinks=20

of nothing else. All our nobility will be there=E2=80=94the best blood in E=
ngland=E2=80=94and some others who=20

sympathize with the unity of the Church, the real question. Nothing has eve=
r gratified the cardinal=20

more than your intended presence. He sent to you this morning. He would hav=
e called himself, bat=20

he has much to go through today. His eminence said to me: =E2=80=98It is ex=
actly what I want. Whatever=20

way be our differences, and they are really slight, what I want is to show =
to the world that the sons=20

of the Church will unite for the cause of Divine truth. It is the only cour=
se that can save society.=E2=80=99=20

When Lady St. Jerome told him that you were coming this=20


_
denned up and slept away his fifth winter.  His bed was made deep under the=
 top of a fallen=20

hemlock, where the snow drifted above him and covered him with soft white b=
lankets.  The only=20

evidence that the outer world had that a bear was sleeping beneath was a sm=
all hole in the snow=20

kept open by the warm breath of the sleeper.   =E2=80=9CBut I never said I =
was coming this evening,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, rather dryly, and resolved to struggle, =E2=80=9Ceither to Lady St=
. Jerome or to any one else. I said=20

I would think of it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut for a Christian to think of dut=
y is to perform it,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore. =E2=80=9CTo=20

be ignorant of a duty is a sin, but to be aware of duty, and not to=20
