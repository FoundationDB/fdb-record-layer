only be used on or thought fit to reject. In the second volume of his work =
he however gainsays a=20

great part of what he advanced in the first; he no longer doubts that half =
at least (a lo menos) of=20

the bread of the Ottomacs and the Guamos is clay. He asserts, that children=
 and full grown=20

persons not only eat this bread without suffering in their health, but also=
 great pieces of pure clay=20

(muchos terrones de pura greda.) He adds that those who feel a weight on th=
e stomach physic=20

themselves with the fat of the crocodile which restores their appetite and =
enables them to continue=20

to eat pure earth.* (* Gumilla volume 2 page 260.) It is certain that the G=
uamos are very fond, if=20

not of the fat, at least of the flesh of the crocodile, which appeared to u=
s white, and without any=20

smell of musk. In Sennaar, according to Burckhardt, it is equally esteemed,=
 and sold in the=20

markets.  The little village of Uruana is more difficult to govern than mos=
t of the other missions.=20

The Ottomacs are a restless, turbulent people, with unbridled passions. The=
y are not only fond to=20

excess of the fermented liquors prepared from cassava and maize, and of pal=
m-wine, but they=20

throw themselves into a peculiar state of intoxication, we might say of mad=
ness, by the use of the=20

powder of niopo. They gather the long pods of a mimosacea which we have mad=
e known by the=20

name of Acacia niopo,* cut them into pieces, moisten them, and cause them t=
o ferment. (* It is an=20

acacia with very delicate leaves, and not an Inga. We brought home another =
species of=20

mimosacea (the chiga of the Ottomacs and the sepa of the Maypures) that yie=
lds seeds, the flour=20

of which is eaten at Uruana like cassava. From this flour the chiga bread i=
s prepared, which is so=20

common at Cunariche, and on the banks of the Lower Orinoco. The chiga is a =
species of Inga, and=20

I know of no other mimosacea that can supply the place of the cerealia.) Wh=
en the softened seeds=20



begin to grow black, they are kneaded like a paste; mixed with some flour o=
f cassava and lime=20

procured from the shell of a helix, and the whole mass is exposed to a very=
 brisk fire,=20

with Project=20

e of hard wood. The=20

hardened paste takes the form of small cakes. When it is to be used, it is =
reduced to a fine=20

powder, and placed on a dish five or six inches wide. The Ottomac holds thi=
s dish, which has a=20

handle, in his right hand, while he inhales the niopo by the nose, through =
the forked bone of a bird,=20

the two extremities of which are applied to the nostrils. This bone, withou=
t which the Ottomac=20

believes that he could not take this kind of snuff, is seven inches long: i=
t appeared to me to be the=20

leg-bone of a large sort of plover. The niopo is so stimulating that the sm=
allest portions of it=20

produce violent sneezing in those who are not accustomed to its use. Father=
 Gumilla says this=20

diabolical powder of the Ottomacs, furnished by an arborescent tobacco-plan=
t, intoxicates them=20

through the nostrils (emboracha por las narices), deprives them of reason f=
or some hours, and=20

renders them furious in battle. However varied may be the family of the leg=
