  _Eli, Eli, lamah azabvtha-

ni?_      No wit of man, however scholarly, can save this passage from     =
_falseness of rendering_=20

on its face; and as so, it becomes a most     terrible blow upon the proper=
 first-face sacredness of=20

the     recital.(258)   For ten years or more, sat the revisers (?) of the =
_Bible_, a most imposing and=20

solemn array of the learned of the land, the greatest Hebrew and Greek scho=
lars of England,=20

purporting to correct the mistakes and blunders, the sins of omission and o=
f commission of their=20

less learned predecessors, the translators of the Bible. Are we going to be=
 told that none of them=20

saw the glaring difference between the Hebrew words in _Psalm_ xxii., _azab=
vtha-ni_, and=20

_sabachthani_ in _Matthew_; that they were not aware of the deliberate fals=
ification?  For=20

"falsification" it was. And if we are asked the reason why the early Church=
 Fathers resorted to it,=20

the answer is plain: Because the _Sacramental_ words belonged in their true=
 rendering to Pagan=20

temple rites. They were pronounced after the terrible trials of Initiation,=
 and were still fresh in the=20

memory of some of the "Fathers" when the _Gospel of Matthew_ was edited int=
o the Greek=20

language. Because, finally, many of the Hierophants of the Mysteries, and m=
any more of the=20

Initiates were still living in those days, and the sentence rendered in its=
 true words would class=20

Jesus directly with the simple Initiates. The words "My God, my Sun, thou h=
ast poured thy=20

radiance upon me!" were the final words that concluded the thanksgiving pra=
yer of the Initiate, "the=20

Son and the glorified Elect of the Sun." In Egypt we find to this day carvi=
ngs and paintings that=20

represent the rite. The candidate is between two divine sponsors; one "Osir=
is-Sun" with the head=20

of a hawk, representing life, the other Mercury--the ibis-headed, psychopom=
pic genius, who=20

guides the Souls after death to their new abode, Hades--standing for the de=
ath of the physical=20

body, figuratively. Both are shown pouring the "stream of life," the water =
of purification, on the=20

head of the Initiate, the two streams of which, interlacing, form a cross. =
The better to conceal the=20

truth, this _basso-relievo_ has also been explained as a "Pagan presentment=
 of a Christian truth."=20

The Chevalier des Mousseaux calls this Mercury:       The assessor of Osiri=
s-Sol, as St. Michael is=20

the assessor,     Ferouer, of the Word.   The monogram of Chrestos and the =
Labarum, the=20

standard of Constantine--who, by the by, died a Pagan and was never baptise=
d--is a symbol=20

derived from the above rite and also denotes "life and death." Long before =
the sign of the Cross=20

was adopted as a Christian symbol, it was employed as a secret sign of reco=
gnition among=20

Neophytes and Adepts. Say Eliphas Levi:       The sign of the cross adopted=
 by the Christians=20

does not belong     exclusively to them. It is kabalistic, and represents t=
he     oppositions and=20

quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by     the occult verse of t=
he _Pater_, to which we=20

have called attention     in another work, that there were originally two w=
ays of making it,     or, at=20

least, two very different formulas to express its meaning:     one reserved=
 for priests and initiates;=20



the other given to     neophytes and the profane.(259)   One can understand=
 now why the _Gospel=20

of Matthew_, the Evangel of the Ebionites, has been for ever excluded in it=
s Hebrew form from the=20

world's curious gaze.       Jerome found the authentic and original Evangel=
 written in Hebrew,     by=20

Matthew the Publican, at the library collected at Caesarea by     the marty=
r Pamphilius. "_I=20

received permission from the     Nazaraeans_, who at Beroea of Syria used t=
his (gospel) to=20

translate     it," he writes toward the end of the fourth century.(260) "In=
 the     Evangel which the=20

_Nazarenes_ and _Ebionites_ use," said Jerome,     "which recently I transl=
ated from Hebrew into=20

Greek, and which is     called by most persons the _genuine_ gospel of Matt=
hew," etc.(261)=20

That the apostles had received a "secret doctrine" from Jesus, and     that=
 he himself taught one,=20

is evident from the following words of     Jerome, who confessed it in an u=
nguarded moment.=20

Writing and the inquest returned a separate finding in each case. It was _h=
eld_ that this was the=20

necessary and proper course to pursue under the circumstances, and that the=
 coroner was=20

entitled to the legal fees in each case. In Boislinieu _v._ Board of Co. Co=
mmissioners, 32 Mo.,=20

375, it was _held_ that the coroner is the sole judge as to the propriety o=
r necessity of holding the=20

inquest, and his action in that respect is not subject to revision by the c=
ounty commissioners, and=20

he is entitled to fees under the statute notwithstanding the verdict of the=
 coroner=E2=80=99s jury discloses=20

that the deceased died of a natural death, and not by casualty or violence.=

Allegany _v._ Shaw, 34 Pa. St., 301. It has been held that the authority of=

r of Chemung County,=20

N. Y., directed the exhumation of the body of a man, who died in California=

that provision of the Penal Code could not be sustained, and this, without =

affray which he had=20

with his nephew. A post-mortem examination was about to be made by two surg=

the coroner for that purpose. The plaintiff, who was also a physician and s=
urgeon, was in the room=20

when the examination was about to be entered upon and=20


_
Bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus, he complains that "a difficult     work =
is enjoined, since this=20

(translation) has been commanded me     by your Felicities, which _St. Matt=
hew himself_, the=20

Apostle and     Evangelist, _did not wish to be openly written_. For if thi=
s had     not been _secret_,=20

he (Matthew) would have added to the Evangel     that what he gave forth _w=
as his_; but he made=20

up this book     _sealed up in the Hebrew characters_, which he put forth _=
even in     such a way_=20

that the book, written in Hebrew letters and by the     hand of himself, mi=
ght be possessed _by the=20

men most religious_;     who also, in the course of time, received it from =
those who     preceded=20

them. But this very book they never gave to any one to be     transcribed, =
and _its text_ they=20

related some one way and some     another."(262) And he adds further on the=
 same page: "And it=20

happened that this book, having been published by a disciple of     Manicha=
eus, named Seleucus,=20

who also wrote falsely _The Acts of the     Apostles_, exhibited matter not=
 for edification, but for=20

destruction; and that this (book) was _approved in a synod_ which     the e=
ars of the Church=20

properly refused to listen to."(263)      Jerome admits, himself, that the =
book which he=20

authenticates as     being written "by the hand of Matthew," was neverthele=
ss a book     which,=20

notwithstanding that he translated it twice, was nearly     unintelligible =
to him, for it was arcane.=20

Nevertheless, Jerome     coolly sets down every commentary upon it but his =
own as     _heretical_.=20

More than that, Jerome knew that this Gospel was the     only _original_ on=
e, yet he becomes=20

more zealous than ever in his     persecution of the "Heretics." Why? Becau=
se to accept it was=20

equivalent to reading the death sentence of the established     Church. _Th=
e Gospel according to=20

the Hebrews_ was well known to     have been the only one accepted for four=
 centuries by the=20

Jewish     Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites. And neither of the =
    latter accepted the=20

_divinity of_ Christ.(264)   The Ebionites were the first, the earliest Chr=
istians, whose=20

representative was the Gnostic author of the _Clementine Homilies_, and as =
the author of=20

_Supernatural Religion_ shows,(265) Ebionitic Gnosticism had once been the =
purest form of=20

Christianity. They were the pupils and followers of the early Nazarenes--th=
e kabalistic Gnostics.=20

They believed in the AEons, as the Cerinthians did, and that "the world was=
 put together by=20

Angels" (Dhyan Chohans), as Epiphanius complains (_Contra Ebionitas_): "Ebi=
on had the opinion=20

of the Nazarenes, the form of Cerinthians." "They decided that Christ was o=
f the seed of a man,"=20

he laments.(266) Thus again:       The badge of Dan-Scorpio is _death-life_=
, in the symbol {~CHI=20

RHO~} as     _cross-bones and skull_, ... or _life-death_ ... the standard =
of     Constantine, the=20

Roman Emperor. Abel has been shown to be Jesus,     and Cain-Vulcain, or Ma=
rs, pierced him.=20

Constantine was the Roman     Emperor, whose warlike god was Mars, and a Ro=
man soldier=20

pierced     Jesus on the cross....      But the piercing of Abel was the co=
nsummation of his marriage=20

with     Cain, and this was proper under the form of Mars Generator; hence =
    the double glyph,=20

one of Mars-Generator [Osiris-Sun] and Mars-     Destroyer [Mercury the God=
 of Death in the=20

Egyptian _basso-     relievo_] in one; significant, again, of the primal id=
ea of the     living cosmos,=20

or of birth and death, as necessary to the     continuation of the stream o=
f life.(267)   To quote once=20

more from _Isis Unveiled_:       A Latin cross of a perfect Christian shape=
 was found hewn upon=20

the     granite slabs of the Adytum of the Serapeum; and the monks did not =
    fail to claim that the=20

cross had been hallowed by the Pagans in a     "spirit of prophecy." At lea=
st, Sozomen, with an air=20

of triumph,     records the fact.(268) But archaeology and symbolism, those=
     tireless and=20

implacable enemies of clerical false pretences, have     found in the hiero=
glyphics of the legend=20



running round the design     at least a partial interpretation of its meani=
ng.      According to King=20

and other numismatists and archaeologists, the     cross was placed there a=
s the symbol of eternal=20

life. Such a Tau,     or Egyptian cross, was used in the Bacchic and Eleusi=
nian     Mysteries.=20

Symbol of the dual generative power, it was laid upon     the breast of the=
 Initiate, after his "new=20

birth" was     accomplished, and the Mystae had returned from their baptism=
 in the     sea. It was a=20

mystic sign that his spiritual birth had regenerated     and united his ast=
ral soul with his divine=20

spirit, and that he was     ready to ascend in spirit to the blessed abodes=
 of light and     glory--the=20

Eleusinia. The Tau was a magic talisman at the same time     as a religious=
 emblem. It was=20

adopted by the Christians through     the Gnostics and Kabalists, who used =
it largely, as their=20

numerous     gems testify. These in turn had the Tau (or handled cross) fro=
m     the Egyptians, and=20

the Latin Cross from the Buddhist missionaries,     who brought it from Ind=
ia (where it can be found=20

even now) two or     three centuries B.C. The Assyrians, Egyptians, ancient=
 Americans,     Hindus=20

and Romans had it in various, but very slight modifications     of shape. T=
ill very late in the middle=20

ages, it was considered a     potent spell again at epilepsy and demoniacal=
 possession, and the=20

"signet of the living God" brought down in St. John's vision by     the ang=
el ascending from the east=20

to "seal the servants of our God     in the foreheads," was but the same my=
stic Tau--the Egyptian=20

Cross.     In the painted glass of St. Denis (France) this angel is     rep=
resented as stamping this=20

sign on the forehead of the elect;     the legend reads, SIGNUM TAY. In Kin=
g's _Gnostics_, the=20

author     reminds us that "this mark is commonly borne by St. Anthony, an =
    _Egyptian_=20

recluse."(269) What the real meaning of the Tau was, is     explained to us=
 by the Christian St.=20

John, the Egyptian Hermes,     and the Hindu Brahmans. It is but too eviden=
t that, with the=20

Apostle at least, it meant the "Ineffable Name," as he calls this     "sign=
et of the living God" a few=20

chapters further on(270) the     "_Father's name written in their foreheads=
_."      The Brahmatma,=20

the chief of the Hindu Initiates, had on his head-     gear two keys, symbo=
l of the revealed mystery=20

of life and death,     placed cross-like; and in some Buddhist pagodas of T=
artary and     Mongolia,=20

the entrance of a chamber within the temple, generally     containing the s=
taircase which leads to=20

the inner dagoba,(271) and     the porticos of some _Prachidas_(272) are or=
namented with a cross=20

formed of two fishes, as found on some of the zodiacs of the     Buddhists.=
 We should not wonder=20

at all at learning that the sacred     device in the tombs in the catacombs=
 at Rome, the "Vesica=20

Piscis,"     was derived from the said Buddhist zodiacal sign. How general =
must     have been that=20

geometrical figure in the world-symbols, may be     inferred from the fact =
that there is a Masonic=20

tradition that     Solomon's temple was built on three foundations, forming=
 the     "triple Tau" or=20

three crosses.      In its mystical sense, the Egyptian cross owes its orig=
in, as an     emblem, to the=20

realisation by the earliest philosophy of an     _androgynous dualism of ev=
ery manifestation in=20

nature_, which     proceeds from the abstract ideal of a likewise androgyno=
us deity,     while the=20

Christian emblem is simply due to chance. Had the Mosaic     law prevailed,=
 Jesus should have=20

been lapidated.(273) The crucifix     was an instrument of torture, and utt=
erly common among=20

Romans as     it was unknown among Semitic nations. It was called the "Tree=
 of     Infamy." It is=20

but later that it was adopted as a Christian     symbol; but during the fir=
st two decades the apostles=20

looked upon     it with horror.(274) It is certainly not the Christian Cros=
s that     John had in mind=20

when speaking of the "signet of the living God,"     but the _mystic_ Tau--=
the Tetragrammaton, or=20

mighty name, which, on     the most ancient Kabalistic talismans, was repre=
sented by the four=20



Hebrew letters composing the Holy Word.      The famous Lady Ellenborough, =
known among the=20

Arabs of Damascus,     and in the desert, after her last marriage, as _Hano=
um Medjouye_,     had=20

a talisman in her possession, presented to her by a Druse from     Mount Le=
banon. It was=20

recognised by a certain sign on its left     corner as belonging to that cl=
ass of gems which is known=20

in     Palestine as a "_Messianic_" amulet, of the second or third     cent=
ury B.C. It is a green stone=20

of a pentagonal form; at the     bottom is engraved a fish; higher, Solomon=
's Seal;(275) and still=20

higher, the four Chaldaic letters--Jod, He, Vau, He, IAHO, which     form t=
he name of the Deity.=20

These are arranged in quite an unusual     way, running from below upward, =
in reversed order, and=20

forming the     Egyptian Tau. Around these there is a legend which, as the =
gem is     not our=20

property, we are not at liberty to give. The Tau, in its     mystical sense=
, as well as the _Crux=20

ansata_, is the _Tree of     Life_.      It is well known that the earliest=
 Christian emblems--before it=20

was     ever attempted to represent the bodily appearance of Jesus--were   =
  the Lamb, the Good=20

Shepherd, and _The Fish_. The origin of the     latter emblem, which has so=
 puzzled the=20

archaeologists, thus     becomes comprehensible. The whole secret lies in t=
he easily=20

ascertained fact that, while in the _Kabalah_ the King Messiah is     calle=
d "Interpreter," or=20

Revealer of the Mystery, and shown to be     the _fifth_ emanation, in the =
_Talmud_--for reasons=20

we will now     explain--the Messiah is very often designated as "DAG," or =
the     Fish. This is an=20

inheritance from the Chaldees, and relates--as the     very name indicates-=
-to the Babylonian=20

Dagon, the man-fish, who was     the instructor and interpreter of the peop=
le, to whom he=20

appeared.     Abarbanel explains the name, by stating that the sign of his =
    (Messiah's) coming is=20

the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the     sign _Pisces_.(276) Theref=
ore, as the Christians=20

were intent upon     identifying their Christos with the Messiah of the _Ol=
d     Testament_, they=20

adopted it so readily as to forget that its true     origin might be traced=
 still further back than the=20

Babylonian     Dagon. How eagerly and closely the ideal of Jesus was united=
, by     the early=20

Christians, with every imaginable kabalistic and pagan     tenet, may be in=
ferred from the language=20

of Clemens, of     Alexandria, addressed to his co-religionists.      When =
they were debating upon=20

the choice of the most appropriate     symbol to remind them of Jesus, Clem=
ens advised them in=20

the     following words: "Let the engraving upon the gem of your ring be   =
  either _a dove_, or _a=20

ship running before the wind_ (the Argha),     or a _fish_." Was the good f=
ather, when writing this=20

sentence,     labouring under the recollection of Joshua, son of Nun (calle=
d     _Jesus_ in the=20

Greek and Slavonian versions); or had he forgotten     the real interpretat=
ion of these pagan=20

symbols?(277)   And now, with the help of all these passages scattered hith=
er and thither in _Isis_=20

and other works of this kind, the reader will see and judge for himself whi=
ch of the two=20

explanations--the Christian or that of the Occultist--is the nearer to trut=
h. If Jesus were not an=20

Initiate, why should all these _allegorical_ incidents of his life be given=
? Why should such extreme=20

trouble be taken, so much time wasted trying to make the above: (_a_) answe=
r and dovetail with=20

purposely picked out sentences in the _Old Testament_, to show them as _pro=
phecies_; and=20

(_b_) to preserve in them the initiatory symbols, the emblems so pregnant w=
ith Occult meaning=20

and all of these belonging to Pagan _mystic_ Philosophy? The author of the =
_Source of=20

Measures_ gives out that _mystical_ intent; but only once now and again, in=
 its one-sided,=20

numerical and kabalistic meaning, without paying any attention to, or havin=
g concern with, the=20

primeval and more spiritual origin, and he deals with it only so far as it =
relates to the _Old=20



Testament_. He attributes the _purposed_ change in the sentence "Eli, Eli, =
lama sabachthani" to=20

the principle already mentioned of the crossed bones and skull in the Labar=
um,       As an emblem=20

of death, being placed over the door of life and     signifying _birth_, or=
 of the intercontainment of=20

two opposite     principles in one, just as, mystically, the Saviour was he=
ld to be     man-

woman.(278)   The author's idea is to show the mystic blending by the Gospe=
l writers of Jehovah,=20

Cain, Abel, etc., with Jesus (in accordance with Jewish kabalistic numerati=
on); the better he=20

succeeds, the more clearly he shows that it was a _forced_ blending, and th=
at we have not a=20

record of the real events of the life of Jesus, narrated by eye-witnesses o=
r the Apostles. The=20

narrative is all based on the signs of the Zodiac:       Each a double sign=
 or male-female [in ancient=20

astrological     Magic]--viz: it was Taurus-Eve, and Scorpio was Mars-Lupa,=
 or Mars     with the=20

female wolf [in relation to Romulus]. So, as these signs     were opposites=
 of each other, yet _met=20

in the centre_, they were     connected; and so in fact it was, and in a do=
uble sense, the=20

conception of the year was in Taurus, as the conception of Eve by     Mars,=
 her opposite, in=20

Scorpio. The birth would be at the winter     solstice, or Christmas. On th=
e contrary, by conception=20

in     Scorpio--_viz._, of Lupa by Taurus--birth would be in Leo. Scorpio  =
   was Chrestos in=20

_humiliation_, while Leo was Christos in     _triumph_. While Taurus-Eve fu=
lfilled astronomical=20

functions,     Mars-Lupa fulfilled spiritual ones by type.(279)   The autho=
r bases all this on Egyptian=20

correlations and meanings of Gods and Goddesses, but ignores the Aryan, whi=
ch are far earlier.=20

_Mooth_ or _Mouth_, was the Egyptian cognomen of Venus, (Eve,     mother of=
 all living) [as=20

_Vach_, mother of all living, a     permutation of _Aditi_, as Eve was one =
of Sephira] _or the=20

moon_.     Plutarch (_Isis_, 374) hands it down that Isis was sometimes    =
 called _Muth_, which=20

word means _mother_ ... (Issa, {~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}{~HEBREW LETTER=20

SHIN~}{~HEBREW LETTER HE~}, woman).     (_Isis_, p. 372). Isis, he says is =
that part of Nature,=20

which, as     feminine, contains in herself, as (nutrix) nurse, all things =
to be     born.... "Certainly the=20

moon," speaking astronomically, "chiefly     exercises this function in Tau=
rus, Venus being the=20

house (in     opposition to Mars, _generator_, in Scorpio), because the sig=
n is     luna, hypsoma.=20

Since ... Isis Metheur differs from Isis _Muth_ and     that in the vocable=
 _Muth_ the _notion of=20

bringing forth_ may be     concealed, and since fructification must take pl=
ace, _Sol_ being     joined=20

with _Luna_ in _Libra_, it is not improbable that Muth     first indeed sig=
nifies Venus in Libra; hence=20

Luna in Libra."     (Beitraege zur Kenntniss, pars. 11, S. 9, under _Muth_.=
)(280)   Then Fuerst,=20

under _Bohu_, is quoted to show       The double play upon the word _Muth_ =
by help of which the=20

real     intent is produced in the occult way ... _sin_, _death_, and     _=
woman_ are one in the=20

glyph, and correlatively connected with     _intercourse_ and _death_.(281)=
   All this is applied by=20

the author _only_ to the exoteric and Jewish euhemerised symbols, whereas t=
hey were meant,=20

first of all, to conceal cosmogonical mysteries, and then, those of anthrop=
ological evolution with=20

reference to the Seven Races, already evoluted and to come, and especially =
as regards the last=20

branch races of the third Root-Race. However, the word _void_ (primeval Cha=
os) is shown to be=20

taken for Eve-Venus-Naamah, agreeably with Fuerst's definition; for as he s=
ays:       In this=20

repeatedly stated that the object of the     Great Pyramid construction was=
 to measure the=20

_heavens and the     earth_ ... [the objective spheres as evoluting from th=
e     subjective, purely=20

spiritual Kosmos, we beg leave to add];     therefore, its measuring contai=
nment would indicate all=20

the     substance of measure of _the heavens and the earth_, or agreeably  =
   to ancient=20

recognition, _Earth_, _Air_, _Water_ and _Fire_.(284)     (The base side of=
 this pyramid was=20

diameter to a circumference _in     feet_ of 2400. The characteristic of th=
is is 24 feet, or 6 x 4 =3D=20

24, or this very Cain-Adam square.) Now, by the restoration of the     enca=
mpment of the=20

Israelites, as initiated by Moses, by the great     scholar, Father Athanas=

priest, the above     is precisely, by Biblical record and traditionary sou=

off this encampment. The _four interior squares_     were devoted to (1) Mo=
ses and Aaron; (2)=20

Kohath; (3) Gershom; and     (4) Merari--the last three being the heads of =
the Levites. The=20

attributes of these squares were the _primal_ attributes of Adam-     Mars =
and were concreted of=20

INRI--the symbol usually translated as _I_esus     _N_azarenus _R_ex _I_uda=
eorum--"Jesus of=20

Nazareth, King of the     Jews." This square of INRI is the _Adam square_, =
which was     extended=20

from, as a foundation, into four others of 144 x 2 =3D 288,     to the side=
 of the large square of 288 x=20

4 =3D 1152, =3D the whole     circumference. But this square is the display=
 of also circular     elements=20

and 115.2 can denote this. Put _INRI_ into a circle, or     read it as the =
letters stand in the square,=20

as to its values of     1521, and we have [Symbol: circle with numbers insi=
de: 1, 1, 2, 5]     which=20

reads 115.2.      But as seen Cain denotes this as, or in, the 115 of his n=
ame:     which 115 was the=20

very complement to make up the 360 day year, to     agree with the balances=
 of the standard=20

circle, which were Cain.     The corner squares of the larger square are, A=
 =3D Leo, and B =3D Dan=20

Scorpio; and it is seen that Cain pierces Abel at the intersection     of t=
he equinoctial with the=20

solstice cross lines, referred to from     Dan-Scorpio on the celestial cir=
cle. But Dan-Scorpio=20

borders on     Libra, the scales, whose sign is {~LIBRA~} (which sign is th=
at of the     ancient=20

_pillow_ on which _the back of the head to the ears_(285)     rested, the p=
illow of Jacob), and is=20

represented for one symbol as     [Symbol: Letters X, P, and S, with Libra =
symbol atop them]....=20

Also the badge of Dan-Scorpio is death-life, in the symbol {~CHI RHO~}. Now=
     the cross is the=20

emblem of the _origin of measures_, in the     _Jehovah_ form of a _straigh=
t line one of a=20

denomination of 20612,     the perfect circumference_; hence Cain was this =
as Jehovah, for     the=20

text says that _he was_ Jehovah. But the attachment of a man     to this cr=
oss was that of 113:=20

355 to 6561: 5153 x 4 =3D 20612, as     shown. Now, over the _head_ of Jesu=
s crucified was placed=20

the     inscription, of which the initial letters of the words have always =
    been retained as symbolic,=20



and handed down and used as a monogram     of Jesus Chrestos--_viz._, INRI =
or _Jesus=20

Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum_;     but they are located on the _Cross_, or the c=
ubed _form_ of the=20

circular origin of measures which measure the substance of     _Earth_, _Ai=

_Water_, or INRI =3D 1152, as shown. Here     is the _man_ on the _cross_, =
or 113: 355 combined=20

with 6561: 5153     x 4 =3D 20612. These are the _pyramid-base_ numbers as =
coming from     113:=20

355 as the Hebrew source; whence the Adam-square, which is     the pyramid =
base, and the=20

centre one to the larger square of the     _encampment_. Bend INRI into a c=

1152, or the     circumference of the latter. But Jesus dying (or Abel marr=

some Christians. Every honest trusting believer who has shed tears of rever=

the events of the short period of the public life of Jesus of Nazareth, has=
 to choose one of the two=20

ways opening before him after reading the aforesaid: either his faith has t=
o render him quite=20

impervious to any light coming from human reasoning and evident fact; or he=
 must confess that he=20

has lost his Saviour. The One whom he had hitherto considered as the unique=
 incarnation on this=20

earth of the One Living God in heaven, fades into thin air, on the authorit=
y of the properly read and=20

correctly interpreted _Bible_ itself. Moreover, since on the authority of J=

"exhibits matter not=20

truth can be expected from his famous _Vulgate_? _Human_ mysteries, concoct=
ed by generations=20

of Church Fathers bent upon evolving a religion of their own invention, are=
 seen instead of a=20

_divine_ Revelation; and that this was so is corroborated by a prelate of t=
he Latin Church. Saint=20

Gregory Nazianzen wrote to his friend and confidant, Saint Jerome:       No=
thing can impose better=20

on a people than verbiage; the less they     understand the more they admir=
e.... Our fathers and=20

terrestrial Angels) are shutting out the divine light. Therefore, Christos,=
 the perfect,(287)=20

Uniting himself with Sophia [divine wisdom] descended through the     seven=
 planetary regions,=20

assuming in each an analogous form ...     [and] entered into the man Jesus=
 at the moment of his=20

baptism in     the Jordan. From this time forth Jesus began to work miracle=
s;     before that he had=20

been entirely ignorant of his own mission.   Ilda-Baoth, discovering that C=
hristos was bringing to=20

an end his kingdom of Matter, stirred up the Jews, his own people, against =
Him, and Jesus was=20

put to death. When Jesus was on the Cross Christos and Sophia left His body=
, and returned to=20

Their own sphere. The material body of Jesus was abandoned to the earth, bu=
t He Himself, the=20

Inner Man, was clothed with a body made up of _aether_.(288)       Thencefo=
rth he consisted=20

merely of soul and spirit.... During his     sojourn upon earth of _eightee=
n_ months after he had=20

risen, he     received from Sophia that perfect knowledge, that true Gnosis=
,     which he=20

communicated to the small portion of the Apostles who     were capable of r=
eceiving the=20

same.(289)   The above is transparently Eastern and Hindu; it is the Esoter=
ic Doctrine pure and=20

simple, save for the names and the allegory. It is, more or less, the histo=
ry of every Adept who=20

obtains Initiation. The Baptism in the Jordan is the Rite of Initiation, th=
e final purification; whether=20

in sacred pagoda, tank, river, or temple lake in Egypt or Mexico. The perfe=
ct Christos and Sophia--

divine Wisdom and Intelligence--enter the Initiate at the moment of the mys=
tic rite, by transference=20

from Guru to Chela, and leave the physical body, at the moment of the death=
 of the latter, to re-=20

enter the Nirmanakaya, or the astral Ego of the Adept.       The spirit of =
Buddha [collectively]=20

overshadows the Bodhisattvas     of his Church   says the Buddhist Ritual o=
f Aryasangha.  Says=20

the Gnostic teaching:       When he [the spirit of Christos] shall have col=
lected all the     Spiritual, all=20

the Light [that exists in matter], out of     Ilbadaoth's empire, Redemptio=
n is accomplished and the=20

end of the     world arrived.(290)   Say the Buddhists:       When Buddha [=
the Spirit of the Church]=20

hears the hour strike, he     will send Maitreya Buddha--after whom the old=
 world wall be=20

destroyed.   That which is said of Basilides by King may be applied as trut=
hfully to every innovator,=20



so called, whether of a Buddhist or of a Christian Church. In the eyes of C=
lemens Alexandrinus, he=20

says, the Gnostics taught very little that was blameable in their mystical =
transcendental views.=20

In his eyes the latter [Basilides], was not a _heretic_, that is     an inn=
ovator upon the accepted=20

doctrines of the Catholic Church,     but only a theosophic speculator who =
sought to express old=20

truths     by new formulae.(291)   There was a Secret Doctrine preached by =
Jesus; and "secresy"=20

in those days meant Secrets, or Mysteries of Initiation, all of which have =
been either rejected or=20

disfigured by the Church. In the Clementine _Homilies_ we read:       And P=
eter said: "We=20

remember that our Lord and Teacher, commanding     us, said 'Guard the myst=
eries for me and=20

the sons of my house.' "     Wherefore also he explained to His disciples p=
rivately the     Mysteries=20

of the Kingdom of the Heavens.(292)      SECTION XIX. ST. CYPRIAN OF ANTIOC=
H.   The=20

AEons (Stellar Spirits)--emanated from the Unknown of the Gnostics, and ide=
ntical with the Dhyan=20

Chohans of the Esoteric Doctrine--and their Pleroma, having been transforme=
d into Archangels=20

and the "Spirits of the Presence" by the Greek and Latin Churches, the prot=
otypes have lost caste.=20

The Pleroma(293) was now called the "Heavenly Host," and therefore the old =
name had to=20

become identified with Satan and his "Host." Might is right in every age, a=
nd History is full of=20

contrasts. Manes had been called the "Paraclete"(294) by his followers. He =
was an Occultist, but=20

passed to posterity, owing to the kind exertions of the Church, as a Sorcer=
er, so a match had to be=20

found for him by way of contrast. We recognise this match in St. Cyprianus =
of Antioch, a self-

confessed if not a real "Black Magician," it seems, whom the Church--as a r=
eward for his contrition=20

and humility--subsequently raised to the high rank of Saint and Bishop.  Wh=
at history knows of him=20

is not much, and it is mostly based on his own confession, the truthfulness=
 of which is warranted,=20

we are told, by St. Gregory, the Empress Eudoxia, Photius and the Holy Chur=
ch. This curious=20

document was ferreted out by the Marquis de Mirville,(295) in the Vatican, =
and by him translated=20

into French for the first time, as he assures the reader. We beg his permis=
sion to re-translate a few=20

pages, not for the sake of the penitent Sorcerer, but for that of some stud=
ents of Occultism, who=20

will thus have an opportunity of comparing the methods of ancient Magic (or=
 as the Church calls it,=20

Demonism) with those of modern Theurgy and Occultism.  The scenes described=
 took place at=20

Antioch about the middle of the third century, 252 A.D., says the translato=
r. This Confession was=20

written by the penitent Sorcerer after his conversion; therefore, we are no=
t surprised to find how=20

much room he gives in his lamentations to reviling his Initiator "Satan," o=
r the "Serpent Dragon,"=20

as he calls him. There are other and more modern instances of the same trai=
t in human nature.=20

Converted Hindus, Parsis and other "heathen" of India are apt to denounce t=
heir forefathers'=20

religions at every opportunity. Thus runs the Confession:       O all of yo=
u who reject the real=20

mysteries of Christ, see my     tears!... You who wallow in your demoniacal=
 practices, learn by my=20

sad example all the vanity of their [the demons'] baits ... I am     that C=
yprianus, who, vowed to=20

Apollo from his infancy, was early     initiated into all the arts of the d=
ragon.(296) Even before the=20

age of seven I had already been introduced into the temple of     Mithra: t=
hree years later, my=20

parents taking me to Athens to be     received as citizen, I was permitted =
likewise to penetrate the=20

mysteries of Ceres lamenting her daughter,(297) and I also became     the g=
uardian witness it, but=20

the coroner asked him to leave, and on his refusing caused him to be put ou=
t of the room. For this=20

act this suit was brought. It was _held_ that the suit could not be maintai=

Willett, 92 N. Y., 29. In this case upon the trial of an indictment for mur=
der, evidence was received=20

on the part of the prosecution, under objection and exception, to the effec=
t that upon the coroner=E2=80=99s=20

inquest a witness testified that shortly after the murder a stranger called=
 at her house and asked=20

the way to Sandy Hill, and also for a drink of water; that the prisoner wit=
h a number of others was=20

placed around a room, and the witness pointed out the prisoner as the one w=
ho so called; also=20

that a number of persons, including the prisoner passed behind her, each on=
e repeating the=20

question asked her by the stranger, and she identified the prisoner by his =
voice, and that the=20

prisoner on that occasion did not Footnote: deny that he was such stranger.=
 It was held that the=20

prisoner was not bound to speak and his silence could not be regarded as an=
 evidence of guilt,=20

and that the evidence was improperly received. The Court said: =E2=80=9CThe=
 question whether the=20

defendant was bound to speak, and understood that he was at liberty to spea=
k, if he chose, was=20

submitted to the jury by the Court in his charge, and an exception taken th=
ereto. The doctrine as to=20

silence being taken as an implied admission of the truth of allegations spo=
ken or uttered in the=20

presence of a person, does not apply to silence at a judicial proceeding or=
 hearing. And if the=20

proceedings before the coroner were of a judicial character the evidence wa=
s erroneously=20

received. It is very apparent that the examination before the coroner parto=
ok of a judicial=20

character, and what then transpired must be considered as a part of the pro=
ceedings; the coroner=20

was there, a jury had been empanelled, and witnesses were examined whose te=

Commonwealth, 29 Pa. St., 102. In this case the prosecution was permitted t=
o prove upon the trial=20



that a justice of the peace had held an inquest on the body of a dead perso=
n, and appointed=20

another person foreman of the inquest, and directed him to swear witnesses;=
 and while the inquest=20

was still sitting, the foreman called upon and requested the defendant to b=
e sworn and give=20

evidence as a witness, and he was duly sworn and was examined by the forema=
n, in presence of=20

the inquest. It was held on appeal that his evidence was admissible. On thi=
s point the Court said:=20

=E2=80=9CIf the defendant had been awakened out of sleep, charged with crim=
e, and then, in the necessary=20

confusion of his faculties sworn to testify, I should have steadfastly resi=
sted the subsequent=20

introduction of the testimony against him. The common law, which justifies =
an accused man in=20

entire silence, appears in beautiful contrast to the continental systems, w=
hich permit the criminal to=20

be racked by inquisitorial skill, until something be wrung from him which m=
ay be patched up into=20

proof of guilt. This case shows nothing of the kind. The phrase =E2=80=98ca=
lled up=E2=80=99 commented on by the=20

counsel, does not appear in the record, and if employed by the witnesses re=
lated doubtless to the=20

ordinary case of calling forth a witness, and not awakening him from slumbe=
r. When the defendant=20

was sworn before the inquest, he had neither been charged with nor suspecte=
d of crime. He might=20

have declined to testify, and this would have pointed suspicion directly to=
 him. He took the risk of a=20

statement, and cannot complain that he met the legitimate consequences of t=
he act. In the eye of=20

all the authorities, it was a voluntary statement.=E2=80=9D  [567] Clough _=

Ascending after that to the summit of Mount Olympus, the Seat of     the Go=
ds, as it is called, there=20

too I was initiated into the     sense, and the _real_ meaning of their [th=
e Gods'] speeches and=20

their clamorous manifestations (_strepituum_). It is there that I     was m=
ade to see in imagination=20

(_phantasia_) [or _maya_] those     trees and all those herbs that operate =
such prodigies with the=20

help of demons; ... and I saw their dances, their warfares, their     snare=
s, illusions and=20

promiscuities. I heard their singing.(298) I     saw finally, for forty con=
secutive days, the phalanx of=20

the Gods     and Goddesses, sending from Olympus, as though they were Kings=
,     spirits to=20

represent them on earth and act in their name among all     the nations.(29=
9)      At that time I lived=20

entirely on fruit, eaten only after sunset,     the virtues of which were e=
xplained to me by the seven=20

priests of     the sacrifices.(300)      When I was fifteen my parents desi=
red that I should be made=20

acquainted, not only with all the natural laws in connection with     the g=
eneration and corruption of=20

bodies on earth, in the air and     in the seas, but also with all the othe=
r forces _grafted_(301)=20

(_insitas_) on these by the Prince of the World in order to     counteract =
their primal and divine=20

constitution.(302) At twenty I     went to Memphis, where, penetrating into=
 the Sanctuaries, I was=20

taught to discern all that pertains to the communications of     demons [Da=
imones or Spirits] with=20

terrestrial matters, their     aversion for certain places, their sympathy =
and attraction for     others,=20

their expulsion from certain planets, certain objects and     laws, their p=
ersistence in preferring=20

darkness and their     resistance to light.(303) There I learned the number=
 of the fallen=20

Princes,(304) that which takes place in human souls and the bodies     they=
 enter into=20

communication with.      I learnt the analogy that exists between earthquak=
es and the     rains,=20

between the motion of the earth(305) and the motion of the     seas; I saw =
the spirits of the Giants=20

plunged in subterranean     darkness and seemingly supporting the earth lik=
e a man carrying a=20

burden on his shoulders.(306)      When thirty I travelled to Chaldaea to s=
tudy there the true power=20

of the air, placed by some in the fire and by the more learned in     light=
 [Akasha]. I was taught to=20

see that the planets were in their     variety as dissimilar as the plants =
on earth, and the stars were=20

like armies ranged in battle order. I knew the Chaldaean division     of Et=
her into 365 parts,(307)=20

and I perceived that every one of     the demons who divide it among themse=
lves(308) was=20

endowed with     that material force that permitted him to execute the orde=
rs of     the Prince and=20

guide all the movements therein [in the     Ether].(309) They [the Chaldees=
] explained to me how=20

those Princes     had become participants in the Council of Darkness, ever =
in     opposition to the=20

Council of Light.      I got acquainted with the Mediatores [surely not med=
iums as De     Mirville=20

explains!],(310) and upon seeing the covenants they were     mutually bound=
 by, I was struck with=20

wonder upon learning the     nature of their oaths and observances.(311)   =
   Believe me, I saw the=20

Devil; believe me I have embraced him(312)     [like the witches at the Sab=
bath (?)] when I was yet=20

quite young,     and he saluted me by the title of the new Jambres, declari=
ng me     worthy of my=20

ministry (initiation). He promised me continual help     during life and a =
principality after death.(313)=20

Having become in     great honour [an Adept] under his tuition, he placed u=
nder my     orders a=20

phalanx of demons, and when I bid him good-bye, "Courage,     good success,=
 excellent Cyprian,"=20

he exclaimed, rising up from his     seat to see me to the door, plunging t=
hereby those present into=20

a     profound admiration.(314)   Having bidden farewell to his Chaldaean I=
nitiator, the future=20

Sorcerer and Saint went to Antioch. His tale of "iniquity" and subsequent r=
epentance is long but=20

we will make it short. He became "an accomplished Magician," surrounded by =
a host of disciples=20



and "candidates to the perilous and sacrilegious art." He shows himself dis=
tributing love-philtres=20

and dealing in deathly charms "to rid young wives of old husbands, and to r=
uin Christian virgins."=20

Unfortunately Cyprianus was not above love himself. He fell in love with th=
e beautiful Justine, a=20

converted maiden, after having vainly tried to make her share the passion o=
ne named Aglaides, a=20

profligate, had for her. His "demons failed" he tells us, and he got disgus=
ted with them. This=20

disgust brings on a quarrel between him and his Hierophant, whom he insists=
 on identifying with=20

the Demon; and the dispute is followed by a tournament between the latter a=
nd some Christian=20

converts, in which the "Evil One" is, of course, worsted. The Sorcerer is f=
inally baptised and gets=20

rid of his enemy. Having laid at the feet of Anthimes, Bishop of Antioch, a=
ll his books on Magic, he=20

became a Saint in company with the beautiful Justine, who had converted him=
; both suffered=20

martyrdom under the Emperor Diocletian; and both are buried side by side in=
 Rome, in the Basilica=20

of St. John Lateran, near the Baptistery.      SECTION XX. THE obtain permi=

We now return to the consideration of the essential identity between the Ea=
stern Gupta Vidya and=20

the Kabalah as a system, while we must also show the dissimilarity in their=
 philosophical=20

interpretations since the Middle Ages.  It must be confessed that the views=
 of the Kabalists--

meaning by the word those students of Occultism who study the Jewish _Kabal=
ah_ and who know=20

little, if anything, of any other Esoteric literature or of its teachings--=
are as varied in their synthetic=20

conclusions upon the nature of the mysteries taught even in the _Zohar_ alo=
ne, and are as wide of=20

the true mark, as are the _dicta_ upon it of exact Science itself. Like the=
 mediaeval Rosicrucian=20

and the Alchemist--like the Abbot Trithemius, John Reuchlin, Agrippa, Parac=
elsus, Robert Fludd,=20

Philalethes, etc.--by whom they swear, the continental Occultists see in th=
e Jewish _Kabalah_=20

alone the universal well of wisdom; they find in it the secret lore of near=
ly all the mysteries of=20

Nature--metaphysical and divine--some of them including herein, as did Reuc=
hlin, those of the=20

Christian _Bible_. For them the _Zohar_ is an Esoteric Thesaurus of all the=
 mysteries of the=20

Christian Gospel; and the _Sepher Yetzirah_ is the light that shines in eve=
ry darkness, and the=20

container of the keys to open every secret in Nature. Whether many of our m=
odern followers of the=20

mediaeval Kabalists have an idea of the real meaning of the symbology of th=
eir chosen Masters is=20

another question. Most of them have probably never given even a passing LIA=

interpreted and checked only by the light which mediaeval Mystics have thro=
wn upon it, and they,=20

in their forced Christology, had to put a theological dogmatic mask on ever=
y ancient teaching, the=20

result being that each Mystic among our modern European and American Kabali=
sts interprets the=20

old symbols in his own way, and each refers his opponents to the Rosicrucia=
n and the Alchemist=20

of three and four hundred years ago. Mystic Christian dogma is the central =
maelstrom that engulfs=20

every old Pagan symbol, and Christianity--Anti-Gnostic Christianity, the mo=
dern retort that has=20

replaced the alembic of the Alchemists--has distilled out of all recognitio=
