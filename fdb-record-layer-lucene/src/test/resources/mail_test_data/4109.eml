ts, whose field of=20

action we have lately confined to the Black Hills country. I have the honor=
 of being the leader, and=20

you have doubtless heard of me--Deadwood Dick, the 'Road-Agent Prince,' as =
the _Pioneer_=20

persists in terming me. Just at present, things are rather sultry in the im=
mediate vicinity of=20

Deadwood, so far as we are concerned, and we sought this locality to escape=
 a small army of the=20

Deadwood military, who have been nosing around after us for the past week."=
  "Well--?"  "Well, we=20

happened to see a man and woman come this way, and believing that it must l=
ead to somewhere=20

or other, we followed, and here we are, out of the reach of the blue-coats,=
 but, I take it, _in_ the=20

way of a party of secret miners. Is it not so?"  "No, not necessarily so, u=
nless you put yourselves in=20

the way. You wish to remain quartered here for the present?"  "If not contr=
ary to your wishes, we=20

should like to, yes."  "I have no objections to offer, providing you will a=
gree to two points."  "And=20

what are they, may I ask?"  "These. That you will camp at the mouth of the =
passage, and thus=20

keep out any other intruders that may come; second, that you will keep your=
 men to this side or=20

the valley, and not interfere with any of our laborers."  "To which I eager=
ly agree. You shall=20

experience no inconvenience from our presence here; you furnish us a haven =
of safety from the=20

pursuing soldiers; we in return will extend you our aid in repelling a host=
 of fortune-seekers who=20

may any moment come down this way in swarms."  "Very well; that settles it,=
 then. You keep your=20

promise, and all will go well."  The two shook hands: then Redburn turned a=
nd strode back to=20

dismiss his forces, while Dick and his men took up their position at the pl=
ace where the fissure=20

opened into the gulch. Here they made preparations to camp. Redburn, while =
returning to his men,=20

heard a shout of joy, and looking up, saw, to his surprise, that the old "G=
eneral" and Alice Terry=20

were locked in each other's arms, in a loving embrace.  FOOTNOTES:  [Footno=
te D: This crusher=20

is said to have been the first introduced into the Black Hills]     CHAPTER=
 XIII.  AT THE CABIN.=20

What did it mean?  Had the old hump-backed, bow-legged mine-locater gone cr=
azy, or was he=20

purposely insulting the beautiful maiden? Fearless Frank stood aside, appar=
ently offering no=20

objections to the hugging, and the Indians did likewise.  At least Miss Ter=
ry made no serious=20

attempts to free herself from the "General's" bear-like embrace.  A few bou=
nds brought Redburn to=20

the spot, panting, breathless, perspiring. "What is the meaning of this dis=
graceful scene?" he=20

demanded, angrily.  "Disgraceful!" The old "General" set Miss Terry down on=
 her feet, after giving=20

her a resounding smack, and turned to stare at the young miner, in astonish=
ment. "Disgraceful!=20

Waal, young man, ter tell the solid Old Testament truth, more or less--cons=
ider'bly less o' more 'n=20

more o' less--I admire yer cheek, hard an' unblushin' as et ar'. Ye call my=
 givin' this pretty piece o'=20

feminine gander a dead--and pay him a dollar to break in the pipe for me.  =
I get him to smoke the=20

pipe for a couple of weeks, then put in a new stem, and continue operations=
 as long as the pipe=20

holds together."  Bok's newspaper syndicate work had brought him into conta=
ct with Fanny=20

Davenport, then at the zenith of her career as an actress.  Miss Davenport,=
 or Mrs. Melbourne=20

McDowell as she was in private life, had never written for print; but Bok, =
seeing that she had=20

something to say about her art and the ability to say it, induced her to wr=
ite for the newspapers=20

through his syndicate.  The actress was overjoyed to have revealed to her a=
 hitherto unsuspected=20

gift; Bok published her articles successfully, and gave her a publicity tha=
t her press agent had=20

never dreamed of.  Miss Davenport became interested in the young publisher,=
 and after watching=20

the methods which he employed in successfully publishing her writings, deci=
ded to try to obtain his=20



services as her assistant manager.  She broached the subject, offered him a=
 five years' contract=20

for forty weeks' service, with a minimum of fifteen weeks each year to spen=
d in or near New York,=20

at a salary, for the first year, of three thousand dollars, increasing annu=
ally until the fifth year,=20

when he was to receive sixty-four hundred dollars.  Bok was attracted to th=
e work: he had never=20

seen the United States, was anxious to do so, and looked upon the chance as=
 a good opportunity.=20

Miss Davenport had the contract made out, executed it, and then, in high gl=
ee, Bok took it home to=20

show it to his mother.  He had reckoned without question upon her approval,=
 only to meet with an=20

immediate and decided negative to the proposition as a whole, general and s=
pecific. She argued=20

that the theatrical business was not for him; and she saw ahead and pointed=
 out so strongly the=20

mistake he was making that he sought Miss Davenport the next day and told h=
er of his mother's=20

stand. The actress suggested that she see the mother; she did, that day, an=
d she came away from=20

the interview a wiser if a sadder woman.  Miss Davenport frankly told Bok t=
hat with such an=20

instinctive objection as his mother seemed to have, he was right to follow =
her advice and the=20

contract was not to be thought of.  It is difficult to say whether this was=
 or was not for Bok the=20

turning-point which comes in the life of every young man.  Where the ventur=
e into theatrical life=20

would have led him no one can, of course, say.  One thing is certain: Bok's=
 instinct and reason=20

both failed him in this instance.  He believes now that had his venture int=
o the theatrical field been=20

temporary or permanent, the experiment, either way, would have been disastr=
ous.  Looking back=20

and viewing the theatrical profession even as it was in that day (of a much=
 higher order than now),=20

he is convinced he would never have been happy in it.  He might have found =
this out in a year or=20

more, after the novelty of travelling had worn off, and asked release from =
his contract; in that case=20

he would have broken his line of progress in the publishing business.  From=
 whatever viewpoint he=20

has looked back upon this, which=20


_
sort o' a hug, _disgraceful_, do ye? Think et's all out o' ther bounds o' p=
ropriety, do ye?"  "I look at=20

it in that light, yes," Redburn replied.  "Haw! haw! haw!" and the General =
shook his fat sides with=20

immoderate laughter. "Why, pilgrim-tender-fut, this 'ere hundred an' twenty=
-six pounds o' feminine=20

gender b'longs to me--ter yours, truly, Walsingham Nix--an' I have a parfec=
' indervidual right ter=20

m you. Alice, dear, this=20

ar' Harry Redburn, ginerall sup'intendent o' ther Flower Pocket gold-mines,=
 an' 'bout as fair=20

specimen as they make, nowadays. Mr. Redburn, I'll formally present you to =
Miss Alice Terry, _my=20

darter!_"  Redburn colored, and was not a little disconcerted on account of=
 his blunder; but he=20

rallied in a moment, and acknowledged the introduction with becoming grace =
and dignity.  "You=20

must excuse my interference," he said, earnestly. "I saw the old 'General' =
here taking liberties that=20

no stranger should take, and knowing nothing of the relationship existing b=
etween you, I was=20

naturally inclined to think that he was either drunk or crazy; therefore I =
deemed it necessary to=20

investigate. No offense, I hope."  "Of course not." and Alice smiled one of=
 her sweetest smiles.=20

"You did perfectly right and are deserving of no censure, whatever."  After=
 a few moments of=20

desultory conversation, Redburn took the "General" to one side, and spoke o=
n the subject of=20

Fearless Frank and Anita Harris--of his action in the matter, and so forth.=
 Nix--or Terry, as the=20

latter was evidently his real name--heartily coincided with his views, and =
both agreed that it was=20

best not to let the Scarlet Boy come his life, he is convinced that his mot=
her's instinct saved him=20

from a grievous mistake.  The Scribner house, in its foreign-book departmen=
t, had imported some=20

copies of Bourrienne's _Life of Napoleon_, and a set had found its way to B=
ok's desk for=20

advertising purposes.  He took the books home to glance them ever, found hi=
mself interested, and=20

sat up half the night to read them.  Then he took the set to the editor of =
the New York Star, and=20

suggested that such a book warranted a special review, and offered to leave=
 the work for the=20

literary editor.  "You have read the books?" asked the editor.  "Every word=
," returned Bok.  "Then,=20

why don't you write the review?" suggested the editor.  This was a new thou=
ght to Bok.  "Never=20

wrote a review," he said.  "Try it," answered the editor.  "Write a column.=
"  "A column wouldn't=20

scratch the surface of this book," suggested the embryo reviewer.  "Well, g=
ive it what it is worth,"=20

returned the editor.  Bok did.  He wrote a page of the paper.  "Too much, t=
oo much," said the=20

editor.  "Heavens, man, we've got to get some news into this paper."  "Very=
 well," returned the=20

reviewer.  "Read it, and cut it where you like.  That's the way I see the b=
ook."  And next Sunday=20

the review appeared, word for word, as Bok had written it.  His first revie=
w had successfully=20

passed!  But Bok was really happiest in that part of his work which concern=
ed itself with the writing=20

of advertisements.  The science of advertisement writing, which meant to hi=
m the capacity to say=20

much in little space, appealed strongly.  He found himself more honestly at=
tracted to this than to=20

the writing of his literary letter, his editorials, or his book reviewing, =
of which=20


_
Harris should return, when he could do as he chose.  Accordingly it was dec=
ided that Fearless=20

Frank should be set to work in the quartz mine, that being the furthest fro=
m the cabin, and he=20

could eat and sleep either in the mine or in the crusher building, whicheve=
r he liked best.  After=20

settling this point the two men rejoined the others, and Frank was apprised=
 of their decision. He=20

made no remarks upon it, but it was plain to see that he was anything but s=
atisfied. His deal.  He=20

determined to follow where his bent led; he studied the mechanics of unusua=
l advertisements=20

wherever he saw them; he eagerly sought a knowledge of typography and its b=
est handling in an=20

advertisement, and of the value and relation of illustrations to text. He p=
erceived that his work=20

along these lines seemed to give satisfaction to his employers, since they =
placed more of it in his=20

hands to do; and he sought in every way to become proficient in the art.  T=
o=20

yearned for constant freedom.  The Utes were dismissed and sent back to the=
ir work; the=20

"General" strolled off with McKenzie toward the quartz mine; it devolved up=
on Redburn to escort=20

Alice to the cabin, which he did with pleasure, and gave her an introductio=

 for the improvement=20

of their announcements, and found his suggestions accepted.  He early saw t=

found, to convey successfully to others.  A white space in an advertisement=
