philodendron monstera Ned has not heard from Isaacs for months, and then ou=
r friend mentioned that he was about to leave his lodgings, without saying =
where the next one would be."  Ned Franks passed his hand through his thick=
 curly hair, as if, by so doing, he could draw out some bright idea. "I've =
half a mind," he said, "as it's holiday-time, to be off to London myself, s=
ee the lawyers, and find out have a right to set a high price on that docum=
ent. You are a brave girl."  "It's not much to be brave for a man you love,=
 is it? And now I'm going to give the thing to you, because I trust you, Ma=
demoiselle de Renzie. I know you'll pay. And I hope, oh, I _feel_, it won't=
 hurt you as you think it will."  Then, as if it had been some ordinary pap=
er, she whipped from a long pocket philodendron monstera Ned has not heard =

 And I hope, oh, I _feel_, it won't hurt you as you think it will."  Then, =
as if it had been some ordinary paper, she whipped from a long pocket _
"It is long, very long, since we have heard either from the Frankses, or fr=
om my dear friend Norah,"=20

said Sophy.  "They know not where a letter would find us, my daughter; I ha=
ve twice changed our=20

lodgings since last I wrote, which I did when returning money most kindly o=
ffered. Franks has his=20

own family to care for; I accept nothing but from those who are my relation=
s by you take=20

advantage of that?"  "You take advantage of me," I flung back at the girl, =
looking her up and down.=20

"You pretend that you came from Mr. Dundas with a pressing message for me. =
Do you want me to=20

believe _this_ his message? I think too well of him."  "I don't want you to=
 believe that," she=20

answered. "I haven't come to the message yet. I have earned a right to spea=
k=20


_
"Or by adoption," added Benoni, glancing kindly at Sophy, and then at her b=
asket of knitted goods.=20

"You and Sophy are alike my children," said Isaacs; "our purse shall always=
 be one; our good or=20

bad fortune we share together. So," he added more cheerfully, "take yon loa=
f, my boy, and divide it=20

between your sister, yourself, and me. 'Better the dinner of herbs where lo=
ve is, than the stalled ox=20

and hatred therewith.' We'll thank God for the bread which he gives to-day,=
 and trust him to send=20

more on the morrow."     XXVI.  A Scrap of News.   Heavy and joyless, Sophy=
 on the following=20

morning arose from her bed, which was little better than a heap of rags, in=
 a kind of cupboard off=20

the kitchen. Heavy and joyless she groped her way into the room where Isaac=
s and his son were=20

waiting for her coming to offer their daily morning sacrifice of prayer and=
 of praise. Sophy joined=20

them in the former, but when she attempted to sing      "Praise God, from w=
hom all blessings flow,"=20

her voice faltered, and she broke down; tears came instead of music.  The r=
emains of the loaf=20

were shared for breakfast, and taken with some almost colorless tea. Then I=
saacs and Benoni=20

quitted the kitchen, the one to seek again for work, the other,--with the b=
asket on his arm,--to try to=20

sell Sophy's knitting. When they had left her, the poor girl seated herself=
 on the box. She had no=20

account."  "In twelve minutes I must be on the stage," I said.  "The stage!=
" she echoed. "You can=20

go on acting just the same, though he is in prison--for you!"  "I must go o=
n acting. If I didn't, I=20

should do him more harm than good."  "I won't keep you beyond your time. Bu=
t I beg that you=20

_will_ do him good. If you care for him at all, you must want to save him."=
  "If I care for him?" I=20

repeated, in surprise. "You think--oh, but I understand now. You are the gi=
rl he spoke of."  She=20

blushed deeply, and then grew pale.  "I did not think he would speak of me,=
" she said. "I wish he=20

hadn't. But, if you know everything, the little there is to know, you must =
see that you have nothing=20

to fear from any rivalry of mine, Mademoiselle de Renzie."  "Why," I exclai=
med, "you speak as if=20

you thought Ivor Dundas my lover."  "I don't know what you are to each othe=
r," she faltered, all her=20

coolness deserting her. "That isn't my affair--"  "But I say it is. You sha=
ll not make such a mistake.=20

Mr. Dundas cares nothing for me, except as a friend. He never did, though w=
e flirted a little a year=20

ago, to amuse ourselves. Now, I am engaged to marry a man whom I worship. I=
 would gladly die=20

for him. Ivor Dundas knows that, and is glad. But the other man is jealous.=
 He wouldn't=20

understand--he would want to kill me and himself and Ivor Dundas, if he kne=
w that Ivor was in my=20

house last=20


_
had had the spirit to labor. She gave herself up to sad thought, with her e=
lbow on her knee, and=20

her brow on her hand. "I wonder where Norah is now, and whether she ever th=
inks of me! When=20

she and I were merry young girls together, singing, and laughing, and build=
ing all kinds of castles=20

in the air, how we used to promise each other that our friendship should la=
st as long as our lives!=20

She will have new friends now,--better friends than I ever was, who will no=
t fill her head with follies=20

and her spirit with pride. If she ever thinks of me, it will be with---- Bu=
t I do not believe that she=20

ever _does_ think of me," continued Sophy, in bitterness of soul; "she is h=
appy, earning her living=20

honestly and cheerfully; she is not dependent, despised, despairing,--a poo=
r, blind wretch, like=20

me!"  Surely the ice of mistrust was growing very thick around Sophy, makin=
g her doubt, not only=20

the care of her heavenly Father, but the love of her earthly friend!  And o=
n that very day, Norah=20

Peele was not only thinking of Sophy, but thinking of scarcely anything els=
e. One of those strange=20

little incidents which sometimes occur, small in themselves, but hinges on =
which great events may=20

turn, had brought poor Sophy on that morning forcibly before the mind of he=
r friend.  Norah was on=20

her knees, lighting the kitchen fire at the vicarage, with a bit of the adv=
ertisement sheet of the=20

_Times_, which was used as waste paper in her master's house, when her eye =
chanced to fall on=20

the following notice:--  "NEXT OF KIN. _If the nearest relative of the late=
 Tabitha Turtle apply to=20

Messrs. Grant, Bold, & Co., ---- Lincoln's Inn, he will hear of something t=
o his advantage._"=20

"Tabitha Turtle! surely I know that name!" exclaimed Norah, pausing with th=
e lighted match in her=20

hand. "Yes, to be sure, that is the name of poor Sophy's could I expect him=
 to believe the real truth=20

now? He is a man. But _you_ will believe, because you are a woman, like mys=
elf, and I think the=20

woman Ivor Dundas loves."  Her beautiful eyes brightened. "He told you--tha=
t?"  "He told me he=20

loved a girl, and was afraid that he would lose her because of the business=
 which brought him to=20

me. You seem to have been as unreasonable with him, as Ra--as the man I lov=
e could be with=20

me. Poor Ivor! Last night was not the first time that he sacrificed himself=
 for chivalry and honour.=20

Yet you blame me! Look to yourself, Miss Forrest."  "I--I don't blame you,"=
 she stammered, a sob=20

in her voice. "Only I beg you to save him, from gratitude, if not from love=
."  "It's true I owe him a=20

debt of gratitude, deeper than you know," I answered. "He is worth trusting=
--worth saving, at the=20

expense of almost any sacrifice. But I can't sacrifice the man I love for h=
im."  She looked=20

thoughtful. "You say the man you were engaged to was at your house while Iv=
or was there?"=20

"Yes. He came then. I hid Ivor, and I lied."  "He suspected that someone wa=
s with you? He stood=20

watching, outside your gate?"  "He confessed that, when I'd made him repent=
 his jealousy. Why do=20

you ask? You saw him?"  "I think so. Tell me, Mademoiselle de Renzie, did h=
e lose anything of=20

value near your house?"  "Great heavens, yes!" I cried. "What do you know o=
f that?"  "I know--

something. Enough, maybe, to help you to find the thing for him--if you wil=
l promise to help Ivor."=20

"Oh, shame," I cried violently, sick of bargains and promises. "You are try=
ing to bribe me!"  "Yes,=20

but I am not ashamed," the girl answered, holding her head high. "I have no=
t the thing which was=20

lost; but I can get it for you--this very night or to-morrow morning, if yo=
u will do what I ask."  "I tell=20

you I cannot," I said. "Not even to=20


_
I remember how we two silly young things used to laugh and joke at the name=
, and wonder=20

whether she who had it was like a turtle-dove or a tortoise! _Something to =
his advantage--nearest=20

of kin!_ Why, what if Sophy herself should be nearest of kin,--if there sho=
uld be money waiting for=20

her,--she who is living now upon the charity of the Jew who has adopted her=
, and who, I fear, has=20

but little for himself! Oh, that would be delightful, delightful!" and Nora=
h threw down the match, and=20

tore off the little scrap from the paper, as eagerly as if it had contained=
 the greatest piece of good=20

news for herself. She could hardly settle to her work, so impatient was she=
 to go and ask her=20

mistress's leave to run over to the school-house, to consult her uncle Ned =
Franks as to what could=20

be done for Sophy. However, it was clear that the harder Norah worked, the =
sooner her business=20

would be over. She therefore plied her fingers so diligently, that, before =
eleven o'clock had struck,=20

she received leave to go, "just for a quarter of an hour," to speak to her =
uncle on something of=20

great importance.  There was no time for Norah to change her working-dress,=
 scarcely time to=20

wash her hands. On ordinary days there would have been no use in going to N=
ed Franks before=20

school-hours were over; but this was hay-making time, and a week's holiday =
had been given to his=20

pupils. Carrying her precious little scrap of paper in her hand, Norah hurr=
ied along the path to the=20

school-house, where she found Ned Franks, with Persis carrying her baby, ju=
st starting to pay a=20

visit to Nancy Sands, who had, on the previous day, returned from the hospi=
tal to her home.=20

"Why, here comes Norah!" exclaimed Ned Franks, gayly, "scudding along like =
a yacht in a race!"=20

and as he spoke, his niece came up breathless alike in eagerness and the pa=
ce at which she had=20

been going, for her walk had quickened into a run.  "I've not more than fiv=
e minutes," she began,=20

and stopped to pant, her eyes sparkling and her cheeks glowing with excitem=
ent.  "Come in, then,=20

and take breath, and tell us what news you have to bring us. What's this?" =
as Norah thrust the=20

scrap of soiled paper into his hand,--"what have we to do with Tabitha Turt=
le? She was certainly=20

none of our kith or kin."  As they returned into the school-house, Norah ha=
stily informed her uncle=20

of her reasons for thinking that the notice might be of loss was the beginn=
ing of all my misery. Ivor=20

would not wish me to ruin myself and--another. Mr. Dundas must be saved wit=
hout me. Please go.=20

If we talked of this together all night, it could make no difference. And I=
'm in great trouble, great=20

trouble of my own."  "Has your trouble anything to do with a document?" Mis=
s Forrest slowly=20

asked.  I started, and stared at her, breathless.  "It has!" she answered f=
or me. "Your face tells me=20

so."  "Has Ivor's message--to do with that?" I almost gasped.  "Perhaps. Bu=
t he had no good news=20

of it to give you. If you want news--if you want the document, it must be t=
hrough me."  "Anything,=20

anything on earth you like to ask for the document, if you can get it for m=
e, I will do," I pleaded, all=20

my pride and anger gone.  "I ask you to tell the police that Ivor Dundas wa=
s in your house from a=20

little after midnight until after one. Will you do that?"  "I must," I said=
, "if you have the document to=20

sell, and are determined to sell it at no other price. But if I do what you=
 ask, it will spoil my life, for it=20

will kill my lover's love, when he knows I have lied to him. Still, it will=
 save him from--" I stopped,=20

and bit my lip. "Will you give me the diamonds, too?" I asked, humbly enoug=
h now.  "The=20

diamonds?" She looked bewildered.  "The diamonds in the brocade bag. Oh, su=
rely they _are_ still=20

in the bag?"  "Yes, they are--they will be in the bag," the girl answered, =
her charming mouth=20

suddenly resolute, though her eyes were troubled. "You shall have the diamo=
nds, and the=20

document, too, for that one promise."  "How is it possible that you can giv=
e me the document?" I=20

asked, half suspicious, for that it should come to me after all I had endur=
ed because of it seemed=20



too good to be true; that it should come through this girl seemed incredibl=
e.  "Ivor sent me to find=20

it, and I found it," she said simply. "That was why I couldn't come to you =
before. I had to get the=20

document. I didn't quite know how I was to do it at first, because I had no=
 one to help or advise=20

me; and Ivor said it was under some flower-pots in a box on the balcony of =
the room where the=20

man was murdered. I was sure I wouldn't be allowed to get into the room its=
elf, so it seemed=20

difficult. But I thought it all out, and hired a room for the evening in a =
house next door, pretending I=20

was a New York journalist. I had to wait until after dark, and then I climb=
ed=20


_
interest.  "Certainly Sophy should know of this," said Ned Franks; "but she=
's blind, and Isaacs is=20

scarcely likely to see the _Times_, and if he did, it's a thousand chances =
to one that he should=20

connect his adopted daughter with the name of an aunt whom she appears neve=
r to have seen,=20

and may never even have mentioned."  "We must write to Sophy at once!" crie=
d Norah.  "But how=20

can we write," as easy to do as it looked from the photograph I saw, becaus=
e it was so high up,=20

and the balconies were quite far apart, after all. But I couldn't fail Ivor=
; and I got across. The rest=20

was nothing--except the climbing back. I don't know how the document came i=
n the box, though I=20

suppose Ivor put it there to hide it from the police. It was wrapped up in =
a towel; and it's quite=20

clean."  "I think," I=20
