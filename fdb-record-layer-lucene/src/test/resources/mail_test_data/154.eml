stable, a full-grown lioness sleeping in the shade. I was greatly surprised=
 when the consul went up=20

to her, lifted up her head, opened her jaws so as to show the shining white=
 tusks, and finally sat=20

down upon her hack.  She accepted these familiarities so good-naturedly tha=
t I made bold to pat=20

her head also. In a day or two we were great friends; she would spring abou=
t with delight=20

whenever she saw me, and would purr like a cat whenever I sat upon her back=
. I spent an hour or=20

two every day among the animals, and found them all easy to tame except the=
 hyenas, which=20

would gladly have bitten me if I had allowed them a chance. The leopard, on=
e day, bit me slightly=20

on the hand; but I punished him by pouring several buckets of water over hi=
m, and he was always=20

very amiable after that. The beautiful little gazelles would cluster around=
 me, thrusting up their=20

noses into my hand, and saying "Wow! wow!" as plainly as I write it. But no=
ne of these animals=20

attracted me as much as the big lioness. She was always good-humored, thoug=
h occasionally so=20

lazy that she would not even open her eyes when I sat down on her shoulder.=
 She would=20

sometimes catch my foot in her paws as a kitten catches a ball, and try to =
make a plaything of it,--

yet always without thrusting out her claws. Once she opened Her mouth, and =
gently took one of=20

my legs in her jaws for a moment; and the very next instant she put out her=
 tongue and licked my=20

hand. There seemed to be almost as much of the dog as of the cat in her nat=

and my favorite probably belonged to a virtuous and respectable family of l=
ions.   The day after my=20

arrival I went with the consul to visit the pacha, who lived in a large mud=
 palace on the bank of the=20

Blue Nile. He received us very pleasantly, and invited us to take seats in =
the shady court-yard.=20

Here there was a huge panther tied to one of the pillars, while a little li=
on, about eight months old,=20

ran about perfectly loose. The pacha called the latter, which came springin=
g and frisking towards=20

him. "Now," said he, "we will have some fun." He then made the lion lie dow=
n behind one of the=20

pillars, and called to one of the black boys to go across the court-yard on=
 some errand. The lion=20

lay quite still until the boy came opposite to the pillar, when he sprang o=
ut after him. The boy ran,=20

terribly frightened; but the lion reached him in five or six leaps, sprang =
upon his back and threw=20

him down, and then went back to the pillar as if quite satisfied with his e=
xploit. Although the boy=20

was not hurt in the least, it seemed to me like a cruel piece of fun.  The =
pacha, nevertheless,=20

laughed very heartily, and told us that he had himself trained the lion to =
frighten the boys.=20

Presently the little lion went away, and when we came to look for him, we f=
ound him lying on one=20

of the tables in the kitchen of the palace, apparently very much interested=
 in watching the cook.=20
