philodendron monstera _Peacock_. He was promoted to Captain, and when the _=
Chesapeake_ returned to Boston, after a long cruise, in May, 1813, he was o=
ffered the command of her. He accepted it with reluctance, for she had the =
reputation of being an "unlucky" ship. In the cruise just ended she had acc=
omplished nothing, and as she entered Boston Harbor a gale carried away a t=
op-mast, and with it several men, who were drowned. This incident confirmed=
 the belief that she was "unlucky," and it was difficult to get a good land=
scape with their variegated colours like a herd of fallow deer.  A land of =
vegetation so intense as to bedwarf mankind almost as absolutely as we bedw=
arf ourselves with our machinery in a manufacturing town.  Air plants upon =
the trees; oven-birds=E2=80=99 earthen, gourd-like nests hanging from bough=
s; great wasp nests in the hollows of the trunks; scarlet and rose-pink fla=
mingoes fishing in the shallow pools; nutrias floating down the streams, th=
eir round and human-looking heads appearing just=20
