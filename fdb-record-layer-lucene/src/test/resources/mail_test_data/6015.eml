 Off for Peru   "Well, Tom Swift, you're on time I see," was Mr. Job Titus'=
 greeting, when our hero, and Koku, the giant, alighted from a taxicab in N=
ew York, in front of the hotel the contractor had appointed as a meeting pl=
ace.  "Yes, I'm here."  "Did you have a good trip?"  "Oh, all right, yes. N=
othing had come to an end.  King Charles was beheaded, and Oliver Cromwell =
ruled in his stead as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.  When war broke o=
ut with Holland, Cromwell despatched a fleet to capture the Dutch colonies =

 to be joined by 500 of the English colonists, the latter were chagrined to=
 hear that the war was over.  The New Englanders had, however, in the meant=
ime been petitioning _
"Am dat shorely so, Massa Tom?"  "Of course it is! You get the dictionary a=
nd read about the=20

condors of the Andes Mountains."  "Dat's what I'll do, Massa Tom. Birds as =
big as cows what kin=20

pick up a man in dere beaks, an' carry him off! Oh, my!  No, sah, Massa Tom=
! I don't want t' go. I'll=20

stay right yeah!"  Shortly before Tom and Koku departed for the railroad st=
ation, where they were=20

to take a train for New York, Mary Nestor returned home.  "Tom called you o=
n the telephone to say=20

good-bye," her mother informed her, "and said he was sorry he could not see=
 you. But he sent=20

some sort of gift."  "Oh, how sweet of him!" Mary exclaimed. "Where is it?"=
  "On the dining room=20

table. Eradicate brought it with a note."  Mary read the note first.  In it=
 Tom begged Mary to accept=20

the little token, and to think of him when she used it.  "Oh! I wonder what=
 it can be," she cried in=20

delight.  "Better open it and see," advised Mr. arrest {97} her, and reache=
d England in safety.=20

After many months, she took passage home in a small vessel.  She had many a=
dventures. Once=20

she hid in the hold of the vessel while her enemies searched for her.  The =
ship suffered delay after=20

delay ere, to her joy, Fort la Tour at length was reached.  Her husband rec=
eived her with raptures,=20

and at once set out to bribe the Boston folk once more to lend him a helpin=
g hand to avert the=20

danger which again threatened him.  Now was Charnisay's opportunity.  Hardl=
y was his rival gone=20

than he mustered all his ships and men and fell upon the fort.  What an eas=
y prey it seemed!=20

Charnisay forgot that a woman sometimes can play a man's part.  The fort re=
ceived him with so=20

hot a fire--so hot that thirty-three of his men were slain--that Charnisay,=
 with loud curses, withdrew=20

to his ships.  Long he lay in wait for De la Tour, who dared not now return=
, and after a second=20

onslaught=20


_
moment.  Mary cut the string of the outside paper, and folded back the wrap=
per. A wooden box=20

was exposed to view, a solid, oblong, wooden box, and on the top, in bold, =
red letters Mary, her=20

father and her mother read:  DYNAMITE! HANDLE WITH CARE!   "Oh! Oh!" murmur=
ed Mrs.=20

Nestor.  "Dynamite! Handle with care!" repeated Mr. Nestor, in a sort of da=
zed voice. "Quick! Get a=20

pail of water! Dump it in the bathtub!  Soak it good, and then telephone fo=
r the police. Dynamite!=20

What does this mean?"  He rushed toward the kitchen, evidently with the int=
ention of getting a pail=20

of water, but Mary clasped him by the arm.  "Father!" she exclaimed. "Don't=
 get so excited!"=20

"Excited!" he cried. "Who's excited? Dynamite! We'll all be blown up! This =
is some plot! I don't=20

believe Tom sent this at all! Look out! Call the police! Excited! Who's get=
ting excited?"  "You are,=20

Daddy dear!" said Mary calmly. "This is some mistake. Tom did send this--I =
know his writing. And=20

wasn't it Eradicate who brought this package, Mother?"  "Yes, my dear. But =
your father is right. Let=20

him put it in water, then it will be safe. Oh, we'll all be blown up. Get t=
he water!"  "No!" cried Mary.=20

"There is some mistake. Tom wouldn't send me dynamite. There must be a pres=
ent for me in=20

there.  Tom must have put it in the wrong box by mistake. I'm going to open=
 it."  Mary's calmness=20

had its effect on her parents. Mr. Nestor cooled down, as did his wife, and=
 a closer examination of=20

the outer box did not seem to show that it was an infernal machine of any k=
ind.  "It's all a mistake,=20

Daddy," Mary said. "I'll show you.  Get me a screw driver."  After some del=
ay one was found, and=20

Mr. Nestor himself opened the box. When the tissue paper wrappings of the m=
ahogany gift were=20

revealed he gave a sigh of relief, and when Mary undid the wrappings, and s=
aw what Tom had=20

sent her, she cried:  "Oh, how perfectly dear! Just what I wanted! I wonder=
 how he knew? Oh, I=20

just love it!" and she hugged the beautiful box in her arms.  "Humph!" excl=
aimed Mr. Nestor, a=20

slowly gathering light of anger showing in his eyes. "It is a nice present,=
 but that is a very poor sort=20

of joke to play, in my estimation."  "Joke! What joke?" asked Mary.  "Putti=
ng a present in a box=20

labeled Dynamite, and giving us such a scare," went on her father.  "Oh, Fa=
ther, I'm sure he didn't=20

mean to do it!" Mary said, earnestly.  "Well, maybe he didn't! He may have =
thought it a joke, and=20

he may not have! But, at any rate, it was a piece of gross carelessness on =
his part, and I don't=20

care to consider for a son-in-law a young man as careless as that!"  "Oh, D=
addy!" began in=20

earnest to despair of success.  At this critical junction a scoundrelly tra=
itor, bought by Charnisay's=20

gold, appeared in the fort.  In vain the heroic woman spurred on her valian=
t band to repel the=20

invaders.  The latter had been told that her food and powder were nearly sp=
ent, and finally, at a=20

signal, the traitor threw open the outer gates of the fort, and the host of=
 the enemy rushed in.  Yet=20

even then for three days Madame de la Tour kept them at bay, and Charnisay =
at last, weary of the=20

bloodshed, was fain to offer her fair terms if she would surrender and depa=
rt.  She hesitated a=20

moment, but, to spare the lives of her brave garrison, she {98} caused the =
gates of the inner fort to=20

be opened, and so yielded.  Then it was that Charnisay covered his name to =
the end of all time=20

with the blackest infamy.  His eyes dwelt on the smallness of the garrison,=
 and, ashamed of the=20

terms he had offered, he cried out, "I have been deceived!  I have been dec=
eived!  Take these=20

wretches out and hang them all one by one!"  He ordered a halter to be plac=
ed about the neck of=20

the splendid heroine, their intrepid mistress, Marie de la Tour.  He forced=
 her to witness the cold-

blooded murder of her men, so that she swooned with horror.  To Port Royal =
Charnisay then bore=20

her away, where she fell ill, and in three short weeks was dead.  Alas, poo=
r Marie de la Tour!  Her=20

husband was now an exile from Acadia.  By the capture of the fort he had lo=
st not only his wife,=20



but all his merchandise, jewels, plate, and furniture worth ten thousand po=
unds.  His debts to the=20

Bostonians being heavy, he became bankrupt.  So while Charnisay flourished =
and grew rich at=20

Port Royal, reigning supreme throughout Acadia, Charles de la Tour was a wa=
nderer on the face=20

of the earth.  As a _coureur de bois_ he hunted and bartered for furs in th=
e far north.  Years=20

passed, when, through a faithful follower, tidings reached him which filled=
 his breast anew with=20

hope.  His enemy was dead, drowned in an Acadian river in the very flush an=
d midsummer of his=20

success, which, however, by the wildest extravagance, he had grossly abused=
.  No sooner did De=20

la Tour learn of this event than he took ship {99} immediately for France a=
nd poured out the story=20

of his wrongs at the foot of the throne.  The King acknowledged the injusti=
ce with which his faithful=20

subject had been treated, and, to make amends, created him sole Governor of=
 Acadia, with a=20

monopoly of the fur trade.  Once again back in the colony he loved, his for=
tunes grew bright.  His=20

coffers soon filled with gold.  But the sight of the widow and children of =
his=20


_
"Now, now! Tut, tut!" exclaimed Mr. Nestor. "It isn't your fault, Mary, but=
 this Tom Swift must be=20

taught a lesson. He was careless, if nothing worse, and, for all he knew, t=
here might have been=20

some stray bits of dynamite in that packing box. It won't do! It won't do! =
I'll write him a letter, and=20

give him a piece of my mind!"  And in spite of all his wife and his daughte=
r could say, Mr. Nestor=20

did write Tom a scathing letter. He accused him of either perpetrating a jo=
ke, or of being careless,=20

or both, and he intimated that the less he saw of Tom at the Nestor home he=
reafter the better=20

pleased he would be.  "There! I guess that will make him wish he hadn't don=
e it!" exclaimed Mr.=20

Nestor, as he called a messenger and sent the letter to Tom's house.  Mary =
and her mother did=20

not know the contents of the note, but Mary tried to get Tom on the wire an=
d explain.  However,=20

she was unable to reach him, as Tom was on the point of leaving.  The messe=
nger, with Mr.=20

Nestor's letter, arrived just as our hero was receiving the late afternoon =
mail from the postman,=20

and just as Tom and Koku were getting in an automobile to leave for the dep=
ot.  "Good-bye, Dad!"=20

Tom called. "Good-bye, Mrs. Baggert!" He thrust Mr. Nestor's letter, unopen=
ed, together profiting=20

by their misfortunes.  To make what reparation he could, he presented himse=
lf before Madame=20

Charnisay.  She did not spurn his attentions, and so he courted, then wedde=
d her, and took her=20

children under his protection.  And now, you will think, this surely is the=
 end of the drama.  Nay,=20

there is more to come.  Charnisay in his day had had many dealings with a c=
ertain merchant of=20

Rochelle named Le Borgne.  This fellow now came forward with a trumped-up t=
ale for De la Tour's=20

undoing.  He swore that Charnisay had died owing him a quarter of a million=
 livres, and this story=20

he duly unfolded before Cardinal Mazarin, the great Richelieu's successor. =
 Mazarin, an intriguing=20

bigot, suspected De la Tour's loyalty and religion, and ended by giving Le =
Borgne power to seize=20

the dead Charnisay's estate.  On the strength of this authority a force was=
 got together, and Le=20

Borgne sailed away to oust De la Tour and make himself, if possible, master=
 of Acadia.  He fell=20

first upon Nicholas Denys, who commanded a fort under De la Tour, captured =
him, took Port=20

Royal, and made all in readiness to storm Fort la Tour.  Matters were {100}=
 in this posture when,=20

like a bombshell, burst a surprise for all parties.  At this time, far away=
 across the=20
