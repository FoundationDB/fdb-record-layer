An agreed consultative procedure with the crumbling NATO hardly qualifies as ample 

compensation. There are troubling rumblings of discontent in the army. A few weeks ago, a 

Russian general in Chechnya refused Putin's orders publicly - and with impunity. happening, while 

the future of the colony promised so well, a terrible blow had fallen upon it and the realm of 

France.  The brave and {24} humane Henry the Fourth had been stabbed to death by the dagger 

of the assassin Ravaillac.  The new King, Louis the

according to numerous opinion polls, the vast majority of Russians oppose an Iraqi campaign.  By

and good services. But Putin is not Boris Yeltsin, his inebriated predecessor who over-played his 

hand in opposing NATO's operation in Kosovo in 1999 - only to be sidelined, ignored and 

humiliated in the postwar arrangements.  Russia wants a free hand in Chechnya and to be heard 

on international issues. It aspires to secure its oil contracts in Iraq - worth tens of billions of dollars 

- and the repayment of $9 billion in old debts by the postbellum government. It seeks pledges that 

the oil market will not be flooded by a penurious Iraq. It desires a free hand in Ukraine, Armenia 

and Uzbekistan, among others. Russia wants to continue to converts of the Canadian savages. 

They wanted too, being very ambitious, to get the direction of the affairs of the New World into 

their own hands.  Yet ignorant of the royal tragedy, Poutraincourt sent his son, Biencourt, a fine 

youth of eighteen, back in the ship to France, to report to his Majesty the success at Port Royal in 

converting the natives.  Whereupon the Jesuits decided that the time had come to supplant 

Poutraincourt.  They announced that they would send back two of their priests with young 

Biencourt.  A number of rich and pious Catholic ladies of the Court, headed by Madame de 

Guercheville, interested themselves so far in

States, the sole superpower, can guarantee that these demands are met. Moreover, with a major 

oil producer such as Iraq as a US protectorate, Russia becomes a hostage to American goodwill. 

Yet, hitherto, all Russia received were expression of sympathy, claimed of Poutraincourt's friends 

and partners, including De Monts, as proprietors of Acadia.  Henceforward Poutraincourt was to 

be under the dependence of the Jesuits.  That was the unwelcome news his son sailed back to tell 

him.  The two priests whom he was obliged to receive--Biard and Ennemond Mass--were the very 

first members of their famous order to engage in the
