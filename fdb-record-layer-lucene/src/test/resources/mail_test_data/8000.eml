  "Killed!" exclaimed Jenkins, anxiously, as he turned his horse in the dir=

For a moment or two the guide remained standing on the threshold, watching =
Yvonne's progress.=20

She had already perceived an empty bench in the furthest angle of the room,=
 up against the door=20

opposite, where she hoped or believed that she could remain unmolested whil=
e she waited=20

patiently and in silence as she had been ordered to do. She skirted the gro=
ups of men in the=20

centre of the room as she went, but even so she felt more than she heard th=
at muttered insults=20

accompanied the furtive and glowering looks wherewith she was regarded. Mor=
e than one wretch=20

spat upon her skirts on the way.  But now she was in no sense frightened, o=
nly wildly excited;=20

even her feeling of horror she contrived to conquer. The knowledge that her=
 own attitude, and=20

above all her obedience, would help her gallant rescuers in their work gave=
 her enduring strength.=20

She felt quite confident that within an hour or two she would be in the arm=
s of her dear milor who=20

had risked his life in order to come to her. It was indeed well worth while=
 to have suffered as she=20

had done, to endure all that she might yet have to endure, for the sake of =
the happiness which=20

was in store for her.  She turned to give a last look at her guide--a look =
which was intended to  As=20

on a former occasion, they approached at a slow pace until the animals bega=
n to lift their heads=20

and throw inquiring glances in the direction from which the mounted host ca=
me.  Then the word=20

was given to trot, and, finally, to charge.  The rush on this occasion was =
even more tremendous=20

than on the former, for there were considerably more men, and a larger herd=
 of buffalo.  The=20

lumbering heavy gait of the latter at the first start did not suggest the r=
acing speed to which the=20

clumsy creatures attained when they were hard pressed.  Soon the dropping s=
hots of the fast=20

riders swelled into the rattling musketry of the real fight, and ere long t=
he plain became strewed=20

with dead and wounded animals, while smoke and dust obscured the air.  Ther=
e was no order=20

maintained after the first onset.  Every man seemed to fight for his own ha=
nd.  Crossing and re-

crossing and firing recklessly in all directions, it seemed a very miracle =
that no fatal accidents=20

occurred.  Minor ones there were.  Archie and his nautical comrade witnesse=
d a few of these.  "I=20

say, look at Bourassin!" exclaimed the former, pointing to the left with hi=
s nose--both hands being=20

fully engaged with gun and bridle.  The seaman's eye turned in the directio=
n indicated,=20
