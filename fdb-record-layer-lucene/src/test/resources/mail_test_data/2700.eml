n without it."  "Society," said I, becoming metaphorical, "is _
order to take care of the family.  "Take me with you," begged Little Bear. =
 But the older sisters=20

shook their heads.  "No," they answered; "you would be of no use to us. You=
 are too little. You=20

must stay at home."  The two sisters started upon their journey alone. But =
they had not gone far=20

when they heard the patter of feet behind them. They looked around, and the=
re was Little Bear=20

running after them as fast as she could go. The sisters were very angry. Th=
ey took Little Bear and=20

tied her to the posts of the wigwam, so that she should not follow them aga=
in. Then once more=20

they started upon their journey.  They had traveled but a short distance wh=
en again they heard a=20

noise behind them. And there was Little Bear running toward them with the p=
oles of the wigwam=20

upon her back.  The sisters were astonished and very angry indeed. They und=
id Little Bear from=20

the posts and tied her instead to a huge pine tree which grew close by. And=
 they said: "Now will=20

you stay where we leave you, bad Little Bear?"  Once more they went upon th=
eir way. But a third=20

time they had not gone far when they heard a great noise behind them. _Bump=
ety-bump!=20

Bumpety-bump!_ Along came Little Bear with the pine tree upon her shoulders=
!  The sisters were=20

now very, very angry. They untied Little Bear crossly, with many jerks, and=
 fastened her to a great=20

rock on the side of the hill. And they said: "Now we shall see whether you =
are anchored or not, you=20

obstinate Little Bear!" So they went upon their way.  Presently they came t=
o a wide river, and they=20

had no boat in which to cross. They sat down upon the shore and moped, seei=
ng no way to=20

continue their journey.  But suddenly they heard a terrible noise behind th=
em, and there once more=20

was Little Bear, running toward them with the great rock on her back.  This=
 time the sisters were=20

glad enough to see her. They unfastened the rock and threw it into the midd=
le of the river. Then=20

they laid the pine tree upon the rock, and so they had a bridge upon which =
to cross. Merrily they=20

passed over, all three. For this time Little Bear went with the other two. =
And they did not send her=20

away, because she was so strong and useful. Presently, on the other side of=
 the river, they came=20

to a wigwam, where lived an old witch-woman with her two daughters.  "Where=
 are you going?"=20

asked the old woman.  "Our parents are very old," said the three girls, "an=
d we are going to seek=20

our fortune."  "Come in," said the old woman kindly. "Come in and have supp=
er with us, and sleep=20

to-night in the wigwam with my daughters."  The travelers were glad to go i=
n, for it was growing=20

late. They had a nice supper in the tent, and when it was night the daughte=
rs of the old woman=20

and Little Bear's two sisters went to sleep in a huge bed. The sisters of L=
ittle Bear were on the=20

outside, with the two others between them.  Little Bear did not go to bed. =
She sat up with the old=20

woman beside the camp-fire, telling stories, until it was very late and the=
 old woman fell sound=20

asleep. She snored loudly; but to make sure, Little Bear reached out and pi=
nched her gently.=20

When she found that it was not shamming, she crept softly to the bed where =
the four girls slept=20

and changed their places. After this Little Bear's sisters were in the midd=
le, and the old woman's=20

daughters on the outside. When Little Bear had done this, she crept back to=
 the fire and lay down,=20

pretending to be asleep.  In a little while the old woman awoke and pinched=
 Little Bear to see=20

whether or not she was really asleep; and although it hurt dreadfully, Litt=
le Bear did not stir, or=20

make a sound, but seemed to be dreaming fast. Then the wicked old woman sha=
rpened her long,=20

bright knife and stole to the bed where the girls were sleeping, and before=
 they knew what was=20

happening she had cut off the heads of the two girls on the outer sides of =
the bed. But it was her=20

own two daughters whom the cruel creature had killed, though she did not kn=
ow it, in the dark! The=20

wicked old woman lay down to sleep, chuckling to herself. But when all was =
quiet, Little Bear=20



awoke her two sisters and they all three crept away from that cruel wigwam,=
 hurrying on their=20

journey.  Now, in the morning when the old woman awoke and found what a dre=
adful thing she=20

had done, she was annoyed. She screamed and cried and tore her hair, and th=
en she jumped up=20

into the sky and pulled down the sun from its place, hiding it away in her =
wigwam, so that Little=20

Bear and her sisters might be lost in the dark.  In the pitchy blackness, w=
orse than night, because=20

there were no stars, the three stumbled on and on, groping their way; and i=
t was very=20

uncomfortable indeed. At any moment they might run into some terrible dange=
r.  At last they saw=20

the flicker of a little light, and made their way toward it. They found tha=
t it was a man carrying a=20

torch and looking about for something.  "What are you looking for?" they as=
ked.  "I am looking for=20

the sun," answered the man. "The sun is lost, and we are in great trouble b=
ecause of it. Tell me,=20

have you seen the sun?"  They said "No," and asked him to lead them to his =
village, which he did.=20

And when they came near they saw the twinkle of many lights. All the men of=
 the town were=20

looking for the sun, and there was great distress among them because their =
Chief was ill, and he=20

could not get well until the sun should be put back into his place in the s=
ky, and the days be bright=20

again.  Little Bear asked to see the Chief, and they took her to where he l=
ay dying.  "Great Chief,"=20

said she, "I think that I can help you."  "Can you bring back the sun, Maid=
en?" asked the Chief=20

feebly. "That is the only thing that will help me."  "Yes, I can do so if y=
ou will give me two handsful=20

of maple sugar and your oldest son," said Little Bear.  The Chief agreed. L=
ittle Bear took the=20

maple sugar and went back to the wigwam of the wicked old woman. She climbe=
d up on the=20

outside and threw the sugar down through the chimney-hole into the kettle o=
f rice which the old=20

crone was cooking. Presently the hag tasted it and made a wry face.  "Bah!"=
 she cried; "it is too=20

sweet. I must go and get some more water to put in the kettle."  As soon as=
 the old woman left the=20

wigwam to get the water, Little Bear jumped down from the tent-roof, ran in=
side, and found the sun=20

where the witch had hidden it away. Up she tossed it into the sky; and lo! =
the world was bright and=20

beautiful once more.  Then she returned to the village, where the old Chief=
 received her gratefully.=20

As he had promised, he bestowed upon her his oldest son. But Little Bear di=
d not want him. So=20

she gave the young Chief to her eldest sister for a husband; and they were =
very happy.  Now,=20

when the old woman saw the sun shining once more in his usual place, she wa=
s very angry. She=20

screamed and she cried and she tore her hair. Once more she jumped up into =
the sky, and this=20

time she tore down the moon, hiding it away in her wigwam, just as she had =
hidden the sun.  Then=20

again the good old Chief fell sick, because now the nights were pitch dark;=
 and he asked Little=20

Bear if she could help him.  Little Bear said: "Yes, I will bring back the =
moon, if you will give me=20

two handsful of salt and your next oldest son."  The Chief agreed. Little B=
ear took the salt and=20

went again to the old woman's wigwam, doing as she had done before. She tos=
sed the salt into=20

the kettle of soup, and when the old woman tasted it she made a face and sa=
id: "Ugh! This soup is=20

too salt. I must get some more water to put in the kettle."  As soon as the=
 old woman was out of=20

the way, Little Bear ran in and seized the moon, which was hidden in a corn=
er. She tossed it up=20

into the night sky, where it hung like a lovely lantern, and every one grew=
 happy again.=20

Immediately the old Chief became well, and was glad enough to keep his prom=
ise and to give=20

Little Bear his second son. But she did not want him for herself. She marri=
ed the young man to her=20

younger sister; and they were very happy.  This time the old woman was very=
 angry indeed. She=20

came by night to the village and stole the Chief's beautiful horse, all cov=
ered with little tinkly bells.=20



At this misfortune the old Chief fell ill once more; for he was very sensit=
ive.  Once more Little Bear=20

offered to help him if he would give her two handsful of maple sugar and tw=
o handsful of salt, and=20

his youngest, handsomest son. Of course, the old Chief agreed.  A third tim=
e Little Bear went to=20

the old woman's wigwam and found her making soup. She did just as she had d=
one twice before;=20

only this time the sugar and the salt together made a horrid mess! When the=
 old woman went out=20

to get more water for a quite new soup, Little Bear slipped into the tent a=
nd found the horse. As a=20

precaution she first took off his little bells, so that he should not make =
a noise to bring back the=20

hag. She removed all the little bells but one, and that one she missed, it =
being hidden under a lock=20

of his mane.  Gently she led the horse away. But alas! The one little bell =
which she had overlooked=20

began to tinkle as they fled. _Tink! Tink! Tink!_ Through the wood the old =
woman heard it and=20

pricked up her ears. _Hop, hop, hop!_ Along she came, hobbling after them f=
aster than any horse=20

could gallop, and she caught Little Bear before she could escape.  "Now I w=
ill be even with you for=20

all that you have done!" cried the old woman.  She put Little Bear into a g=
reat bag and tied the bag=20

to the limb of a tree. Then she went away to get a big stick with which to =
beat her victim to death.=20

But Little Bear did not wait for this to happen. While the old woman was lo=
oking for the stick, Little=20

Bear bit a hole in the bag and crept out. She took the good horse, this tim=
e without any bells to=20

give the alarm, and hid him in the bushes ready for flight. Then she put in=
to the bag all the old=20

woman's choicest things--her dishes and food, and the breakable furnishings=
 of her wigwam--until=20

the bag was round and bulgy as if Little Bear herself were inside.  Chuckli=
ng to herself, Little Bear=20

hid in the bushes where she could see what happened upon the old woman's re=
turn; and merry=20

enough the sight was! Little Bear nearly died of laughing, and had to stuff=
 a corner of her blanket=20

into her mouth lest she should betray herself.  For the old woman came hurr=
ying up with her huge=20

club, and began to beat the bag fiercely. _Crack! Smash!_ went the pots and=
 pans. _Smash!=20

Crack!_ went the dishes and the other things. But the wicked old woman went=
 on beating harder=20

than ever, thinking that she was breaking the bones of poor Little Bear.  P=
resently Little Bear grew=20

tired of the smashing and crashing, and thought it was time to be off. She =
mounted the Chief's=20

good horse and galloped swiftly away to the village, where her sisters were=
 awaiting her anxiously,=20

because she had been gone a long time.  When the Chief saw his good horse o=
nce more, he was=20

greatly delighted and grew well immediately; he was so sensitive. As he had=
 promised, he gave to=20

Little Bear his youngest son, who was the handsomest of the three, though n=
ot wise. Little Bear=20

loved him dearly; so she married him herself and they went to live in a fin=
e wigwam which the=20

Chief gave them, near the other two brothers and sisters.  But the Little B=
ear's husband did not=20

love her. He was sulky and said: "I wish my wife were beautiful like the ot=
her maidens! Why must I=20

marry an ugly Little Bear? I wish I might have had one of her pretty sister=
s instead!" And he was=20

cruel to Little Bear and made her weep.  But after a while she dried her te=
ars, and was angry to=20

think how foolish she had been in choosing this youngest son for herself, j=
ust because he was so=20

handsome. She thought about it for a long time.  One day she said to her hu=
sband: "You do not=20

love me, because I am an ugly Little Bear. Take me and throw me into the fi=
re."  "I do not love=20

you," said her husband, "but I cannot kill you, for then the Chief would pu=
nish me."  "Do as I tell=20

you!" said Little Bear, and she stamped her foot.  The young man was afraid=
, for he knew that=20

Little Bear was very wise and powerful. So he did as she bade him, and thre=
w Little Bear into the=20

fire. This made a great noise in the wigwam, and presently up came running =
Little Bear's two=20



sisters.  "Wicked man! What have you done to our dear Little Bear?" they cr=
ied.  "I have done only=20

as she told me," said the young man sulkily. "Little Bear is not beautiful,=
 but she is wise. So I did=20

what she told me to do. I threw her into the fire."  "Oh, wicked man!" crie=
d the sisters again,=20

bursting into tears.  Just then they heard a strange sound in the fire, and=
 turning, they beheld a=20

most beautiful maiden with dark eyes and raven locks coming out of the flam=
es. She smiled at the=20

two sisters, and turning to the young man said:--  "Husband, do you know me=
? I am Little Bear,=20

who was wise but not beautiful. Now I have become beautiful, but I am still=
 wiser than before."  "O=20

my wife!" cried the husband eagerly. "I do not care whether you are wise or=
 not--that matters little=20

to me. But I love you with all my heart, you are so beautiful!"  Little Bea=
r laughed and said: "You=20

were unkind to the ugly Little Bear, though she loved you. You are like mos=
t men; you care more=20

for beauty gratitude I raised the bottle to my lips. I remember thinking at=
 the moment, "The smile is=20

very important--it shall play upon my lips to the end. Ursula, I die happy,=
 for my last thought is, that=20

in the spirit I shall soon revisit thee," and the liquid trickled slowly do=
wn my throat. It was not until I=20

had drained the last drop that I suddenly recognised the taste. It was the =
"pick-me-up" I always get=20

at Harris's, the apothecary in St James's Street, when my fit of nervous ex=
haustion come on, but=20

there seemed rather more of the spirituous ingredient in it than usual. The=
 life-stream began to=20

tingle back through all my fibres--my miseries took grotesque forms. "Ha! h=
a! Lady Broadhem! the=20

means you take to keep up your courage, which you so delicately alluded to =
just now, have come=20

in most opportunely. What a fool I was to make mountains out of molehills, =
and call the little ills of=20

life miseries! We will soon see what these little imprudences are the old l=
ady talks of." And I took=20

up the papers with a hand rapidly becoming steady, and glanced over them wi=
th an eye no longer=20

confused and dim. Oh the pleasure of the sensation of this gradual recovery=
 of vigour of mind and=20

force of body!  I was engaged in this task, and making the most singular an=
d startling discoveries,=20

the nature of which I shall shortly disclose, when I heard Lady Broadhem co=
ming down-stairs. I felt=20

so angry with her for having been the means of tempting me to commit a grea=
t sin, and for the=20

trouble she was causing me generally, that I followed the first impulse whi=
ch my imagination=20

suggested as the best means of revenging myself upon her. Accordingly, when=
 the door opened,=20

she found me stretched at full length on the sofa, my form rigid, my face f=
ixed, my eyes staring, my=20

hands clenched, and my whole attitude as nearly that of a person in a fit a=
s I had time to make it.=20

"Gracious, what is the matter?" said she.  My lips seemed with difficulty t=
o form the word "poison."=20

"Frank, speak to me!" and she seized my hand, which was not so cold as I co=
uld have wished it,=20

but which fell helplessly by my side as she let it drop.  "Poison!" I this =
time muttered audibly.=20

"Where did you get it?" said she, snappishly. For it began to dawn upon her=
 that I was not=20

poisoned at all, but had discovered her secret. I turned my thumb languidly=
 in the direction of=20

under the pillow. She hastily thrust in her hand and pulled out the empty b=
ottle. "You fool"--she=20

actually used this expression; I have heard other ladies do the same--"you =
fool," and she was=20

literally furious, "what did you go poking under the pillow for? You are no=
 more poisoned than I=20

am; it is a draught I am obliged to take for nervous depression, and your i=
magination has almost=20

frightened you into a fit. I put 'poison' on it to keep the servants from p=
rying. Come, get up, be a=20

man--do," and Lady Broadhem gave me her hand, in consideration for my weakn=
ess to help=20

myself up by.  "Dearest Lady Broadhem," said I, pressing it to my lips, "I =
cannot tell what comfort=20

you give me. I was just beginning to regret the world I thought I was about=
 to leave for ever, when=20



your assurance that I have not taken poison, but a tonic, makes me feel as =
grateful to you as if you=20

had saved my life. I confess that, when I found that you considered your af=
fairs to be so desperate=20

that you had provided the most effectual mode of escape from them, I envied=
 the superior=20

foresight which you had displayed, and determined to repair my error. If it=
 is worth dear Lady=20

Broadhem's while to poison herself, I thought, it is surely worth mine. But=
, after all, suicide is a=20

cowardly act either in a man or a woman; better far face the ills of life w=
ith the aid of stimulants,=20

than fly for refuge in the agony of a financial crisis to the shop of an ap=
othecary."  "You are an=20

incomprehensible creature, Frank," said Lady Broadhem; "I am sure I hope fo=
r her own sake that=20

Ursula will understand you better than I do; but as your humours are uncert=
ain, and you seem able=20

to go into these affairs now, I think we had better not waste any more time=
; only I do wish" (with a=20

wistful glance at the bottle) "you would provide yourself with your own dra=
ughts in future."  "How=20

lucky," thought I, as I put on a business-like air, and methodically began =
arranging the papers=20

according to their docquets. "Now, if it had been just the other way, and h=
er ladyship had taken the=20

draught instead of me, how completely I should have been at her mercy? Now =
I am master of the=20

situation."  "'Greek loan, thirty thousand,'" I read, going down the list; =
"I am afraid this is rather a=20

losing business. I see they have been already held over for some months. I =
suppose some of the=20

L27,000 is to be absorbed there."  "Yes," said Lady Broadhem; "because if I=
 can carry on for=20

another fortnight, I have got information which makes it certain I shall re=
cover on them."  "What is=20

this? five hundred pounds' worth of dollar bonds?" I went on.  "Oh, I only =
lost a few pounds on=20

them. I bought them at threepence apiece and sold them at twopence. Spiffy =
got me to take them=20

off his hands, and, in fact, made a great favour of it, as he says there is=
 nothing people make=20

money more surely out of than dollar bonds."  "Bubbs's Eating-house and Cig=
ar Divan Company,=20

Holborn. Well, there is a strong direction. How do you come by so many shar=
es?"  "Lord=20

Staggerton was one of the promoters, and had them allotted to me," said Lad=
y Broadhem. "He=20

also was kind enough to put me into two Turkish baths, a monster hotel, and=
 a music-hall. You will=20

see that I lost heavily in the Turkish baths and the hotel, but the music-h=
all is paying well. Spiffy=20

says I ought never to stay so long in anything as I do; in and out again, i=
f it is only half a per cent,=20

is his system; but Staggerton used to look after my interests, and managed =
them very=20

successfully. I am afraid that all my troubles commenced when I quarrelled =
with him. He is now=20

promoting two companies which I hear most highly spoken of, but he says I m=
ust take my chance=20

with others about shares, and he won't advise me in the matter. One is 'The=
 Metropolitan=20

Crossing-Sweeping Company,' of which he's to be chairman, and the other is =
the 'Seaside=20

Bathing-Machine Company.' Spiffy says they will both fail, because Staggert=
on has not the means=20

of having them properly brought out. Bodwinkle won't speak to him, and unle=
ss either he or the=20

Credit Foncier bring a thing out, there is not the least chance of its taki=
ng with the public. They=20

don't so much look at the merits of the speculation as at the way in which =
it is put before them; and=20

with this system of rigging the market, so many people go in like me only t=
o get out again, that it is=20

becoming more and more difficult every day to start anything new. Oh dear,"=
 said Lady Broadhem,=20

"how exhausted it always makes me to talk 'City!' I only want to show you t=
hat I understand what I=20

am about, and that if you can only help to tide me over this crisis, someth=
ing will surely turn up a=20

prize."  "I know you disapprove of cards, but perhaps you will allow me to =
suggest the word 'trump'=20

as being more expressive than 'prize,'" I said. "Well, now we have got thro=
ugh the companies,=20



what have we here? Why, Lady Broadhem, you have positively taken no less th=
an seven=20

unfurnished houses this year. What on earth do you intend to do with them a=
ll?"  "My dear Frank,=20

where have you been living for the last few years? Do with them? Exactly wh=
at dozens of smart=20

people, with very little to live on, do with houses--let them, to be sure. =
I made L1100 last year in=20

four houses, and all by adding it on to the premiums. I don't like furnishi=
ng and putting it in the=20

rent. In the first place, one is apt to have disagreeable squabbles about t=
he furniture, which,=20

however good you give people, they always say is shabby; and in the second,=
 you get much more=20

into the hands of the house-agents."  "Well, but," I said, "here is one of =
the largest houses in=20

London--rent, unfurnished, L1500 a-year. That is rather hazardous: who do y=
ou expect will take=20

that?"  "Oh, that is the safest speculation of them all," said Lady Broadhe=
m. "I had an infinity of=20

trouble to get it. Spiffy first suggested the plan to me, and we found it s=
ucceed admirably last year.=20

It was we who brought out Mrs Gorgon Tompkins and her daughters. She took t=
he house from me=20

at my own rent on condition that Spiffy managed her balls, and got all the =
best people in London to=20

go to them. This year we are going to bring out the Bodwinkles. It will be =
much easier, because=20

she is young, and has no family. He, you know, is a man of immense wealth i=
n the City--in fact, as=20

I said before, his name is almost essential to the success of any new compa=
ny. I told his wife I=20

could have nothing to do with them unless he came into Parliament, for they=
 are horridly vulgar,=20

and they were bound to do what they could for themselves before I could thi=
nk of taking them up.=20

Lady Mundane positively refused to have anything to do with them, and, in f=
act, I live so little in the=20

world, though I keep it up to some extent for the sake of my girls, that it=
 was quite an accident my=20

hearing of them. Now, however, he has got into the House of Commons, and it=
 is arranged that=20

she is to take the house, and Bodwinkle is to help Spiffy in City matters, =
on condition that he gets=20

all Lady Mundane's list to her first party. Poor Spiffy is a little nervous=
, as Bodwinkle actually=20

wanted to put it in writing on a stamped paper; but he is so immensely usef=
ul to society, that the=20

least people can do is to be good-natured on an occasion of this kind."  "N=
o fear of them," said I;=20

"if Bodwinkle is the only man who can launch a company in the City, no one =
can compete with=20

Spiffy in launching a snob in Mayfair. But I thought you never went to ball=
s."  "I never do; but=20

because I do not approve of dancing, there is no reason why I should not le=
t houses for the=20

purpose. You might as well say a religious banker ought not to open an acco=
unt with a theatre, or=20

a good brewer live by his beer, because some people drink too much of it. I=
f any one was to leave=20

a gin-palace to me in a legacy, I should not refuse the rent."  "Any more t=
han you do the interest of=20

your shares in the music-hall. And now," said I, coolly, gathering up all h=
er papers and putting=20

them in my pocket, "as it is past one o'clock, and I see you are tired, I w=
ill take these away with=20

me, and let you know to-morrow what I think had better be done under the ci=
rcumstances."  "What=20

are you doing, Frank? what an unheard-of proceeding! I insist upon your lea=
ving my papers here."=20

"If I do, you must look elsewhere for the money. No, Lady Broadhem"--I felt=
 that my moral=20

ascendancy was increasing every moment, and that I should never have such a=
nother opportunity=20

of establishing it--"we had better understand each other clearly. You regar=
d me at this moment in=20

the light of your future son-in-law, and in that capacity expect me to extr=
icate you and your family=20

from your financial difficulties. Now I am quite capable of 'behaving badly=
,' as the world calls it, at=20

the shortest notice. I told you at Dickiefield that I was totally without p=
rinciple, and we are both=20

trusting to Ursula to reform me. But I will relinquish the pleasure of payi=
ng your debts, and the=20



advantage of being reformed by your daughter, unless you agree to my terms.=
"  "And they are?"=20

said her ladyship, doggedly.  "First, that from this evening you put the en=
tire management of your=20

affairs into my hands, and, as a preliminary measure, allow me to take away=
 these papers, giving=20

me a note to your lawyer authorising him to follow my instructions in every=
thing; and, secondly,=20

that you never, under any pretence, enter into any company or speculation o=
f any kind except with=20

my permission."  A glance of very evil meaning shot across her ladyship's e=
yes as they met mine=20

after this speech, but I frightened it away by the savageness of my gaze, t=
ill she was literally=20

obliged to put her hand up to her forehead. The crisis was exciting me, for=
 Ursula was at stake,=20

and it was just possible my conditions might be refused; but I felt the mag=
netism of my will=20

concentrating itself in my eyes as if they were burning-glasses. It seemed =
to dash itself upon the=20

reefs and barriers of Lady Broadhem's rocky nature; the inner forces of our=
 organisms were=20

engaged in a decisive struggle for the mastery; but the field of battle was=
 in her, not in me. I had=20

invaded the enemy's country, and her frontier was as long and difficult to =
defend as ours is in=20

Canada. So I kept on pouring in mesmeric reinforcements, as she sat with he=
r head bent, and her=20

whole moral being in turmoil. Never before had any man ventured to dictate =
to this veteran=20

campaigner. The late Lord had been accustomed to regard her as infallible, =
and Broadhem has=20

not yet known the pleasures of independence. She never had friends who were=
 not servile, or=20

permitted herself to be contradicted, except by a few privileged ecclesiast=
ics, and then only in=20

unctuous and deprecatory tones. That I, of whom the world was accustomed to=
 speak in terms of=20

compassion, and whom she inwardly despised at this moment, should stand ove=
r her=20


_
and I do not care what you think."  And Little Bear, now the most beautiful=
 young woman in the=20

village and the pride of the tribe for wisdom, lived happy ever after.    X=
IX: THE RED KING'S VISIT=20

"That is a fine story!" cried Harold, clapping his hands after the Red King=
 had finished telling the=20

tale of the Little Bear. "I wish I could remember all the tales that I read=
, and tell them as well as=20

you do, Your Majesty!"  Red Rex looked pleased. "It is a tale that, when I =
am not at war, I tell often=20

to my little daughter," he said. "She likes all kinds of stories, but espec=
ially those of countries=20

different from our own."  "Then she ought to hear the Tales of Kisington!" =
cried Harold.  "So I=20

think," mused Red Rex. "I would that you could read them to her, even as yo=
u have read them to=20

me, Harold."  "Perhaps some day that may be," answered Harold. "But meantim=
e Your Majesty=20

may hear our tales and tell them to your little Princess when you return. S=
he will like your way of=20

telling them better than reading from a book, I know."  "Yes, I experience =
a sensation nearly allied=20

to suffocation. I seemed instinctively to follow the mental processes throu=
gh which she was=20

passing, and a certain consciousness that I did so demoralised her. Now, I =
felt, she is going to=20

take me to task in a "sweet Christian spirit" about the state of my soul, a=
nd I brought up "will"=20

reinforcements which I poured down upon her brain through the parting of he=
r front, till she backed=20

suddenly out of the position, and took up a hostile, I might almost say an =
abusive, attitude. Here=20

again I met her with such a shower of invective, "uttered not, yet comprehe=
nded," that after a silent=20

contest she gave this up too, and finally fell back on the flat rejection o=
f me and my money=20

altogether. This, I confess, was the critical moment. She took her hand dow=
n when she came to=20

this mental resolution, and she looked at me, I thought, but it might have =
been imagination,=20

demoniacally. What had I to oppose to it? My love for Ursula? No; that woul=
d soften me. My=20

aversion to Lady Broadhem? No; for it was not so=20


_
King. "I must study them well, so that I can tell them without losing the p=
oint of each, as I am prone=20

to do. My little Hope will be glad. Heretofore, I have never had time enoug=
h to read her as much=20

as she craved."  "The library will welcome you," said Harold. "I can answer=
 for that. It would rather=20

have you inside its doors reading than outside battering down the statues a=
nd the glass! Will Your=20

Majesty come with me now and visit the Town of Kisington under the flag of =
truce?"  "That will I,"=20

answered Red Rex.  Forth then went Harold and the Red King to the gates of =
Kisington. Side by=20

side they went, with the flag of truce between them, borne by a big man-at-=
arms. After them=20

followed a guard of the Red King's men; but these remained behind when the =
great gate swung=20

open to admit Harold and his royal guest.  There were no soldiers to be see=
n anywhere in the=20

streets of Kisington. It seemed a town wholly at peace. The Lord Mayor and =
the Librarian were=20

waiting to receive them, and crowds of people thronged the street to catch =
a glimpse of the War-

Lord, who for nearly a week had been besieging their city without firing a =
shot since that first day.=20

Harold recognized among the crowd the faces of many of his school-mates, an=
d presently, when=20

he found the opportunity he beckoned to his chums, Robert and Richard, who =
were in the front=20

ranks.  "Keep close to me," Harold whispered to them. "By and by I dare say=
 you will have a=20

chance to speak with Red Rex himself."  Robert and Richard needed no second=
 hint to keep close=20

at Harold's heels. Proudly they stepped along, one on either side of their =
friend, behind the Red=20

King and the Lord Mayor who followed the Librarian and the bearer of the fl=
ag of truce. To the=20

marketplace they went, the other school children trotting along in the rear=
 of the little procession,=20

and gazing with almost as much pride and awe at their lucky comrades as at =
the dreaded enemy,=20

Red Rex. Indeed, the whole Town of Kisington seemed moving in the wake of t=
hese six most=20

important personages.  What conversation took place between Red Rex and the=
 Lord Mayor was=20

never recorded. But it seemed to grow gradually pleasanter and pleasanter. =
By the time they had=20

reached the steps of the library, their faces were wreathed in smiles and t=
hey beamed at each=20

other like old friends.  At the door of the library the Librarian turned an=
d, with a wave of his hand,=20

said to Red Rex,--"Welcome, Your Majesty, to the treasure-house of Kisingto=
n."  "Glad am I to=20

enter these doors," replied the Red King courteously. "For here, I believe,=
 live the wonderful books=20

which during these past days have been giving me much pleasure." He laid hi=
s hand on the=20

shoulder of Harold and smiled. One would hardly have recognized the face of=
 the grim War-Lord=20

who had begun the siege so savagely. "I would fain see those friendly books=
 in their own home,"=20

he went on.  "That you shall do, Your Majesty," said the Librarian; "for Ki=
sington is so proud of her=20

treasures that she is ever glad to welcome a stranger to the enjoyment of t=
hem. Is it not fortunate,=20

Your Majesty, that the library is still standing to entertain you? Recently=
 it was in great danger of=20

being destroyed, as you may have heard." (The Librarian was an exceedingly =
polite gentlemen.)=20

At these words the Red King turned redder and bowed gravely. "The Books the=
mselves rose up=20

for the protection of books," he said. "They have proved in this case to be=
 the best weapons of=20

defense. I am beginning to think that they are better than any soldiers."  =
By this time they had=20

entered the main hall, where a delegation of Leading Citizens awaited them,=
--in holiday robes and=20

with expectant faces. They greeted Red Rex with profound bows, which he ack=
nowledged=20

graciously.  The Librarian then turned to the rows of patient, peaceful boo=
ks which lined the walls,=20

ready to be made useful. "Yes, Your Majesty. These are our bulwarks and bat=
teries and=20

bayonets," he said simply.  The air of the room was still and quiet, full o=
f peace and kindliness.=20



Beautiful pictures looked down from the walls. Noble statues stood in the n=
iches. Soft lights came=20

in at the windows and fell on the tables and desks, and on rows upon rows o=
f fair volumes, well-

dusted and cheerful. The shattered windows had been screened; the broken ma=
rbles removed; so=20

that there was nothing to reproach Red Rex or to speak of discord.  The War=
-Lord looked up and=20

down and around and along, and spoke no word. All the books seemed listenin=
g, waiting for him to=20

speak. They were indeed like soldiers, shoulder to shoulder, standing at "a=
ttention."  "It is a noble=20

army!" exclaimed Red Rex at last, and his voice was low and gentle. "It is =
the best kind of army for=20

the world, I see, as I have never seen before. I would it were mine!"  "It =
is yours, Your Majesty,"=20

said the Librarian. "You have but to make free use of it. These soldiers ar=
e free-lances, at the=20

service not of one master, but of any one who employs them intelligently. R=
ead them, Your=20

Majesty, and so make them yours, if you will." The Librarian spread out his=
 hands in a generous=20

gesture.  "By my Hope, you are hospitable and magnanimous!" cried Red Rex. =
"I am tempted to=20

take you at your word. Come, let there be no more war between us. Let us ma=
ke no brief truce,=20

but agree, instead, upon a true, lasting peace. Already I have promised thi=
s Harold of yours to=20

spare the city, east, west, and north,--which is the whole of it. But come;=
 promise me now to spare=20

me the scorn and hatred which you owe for my unfriendliness. Let us spare e=
ach other and be=20

friends. For I would know more of your books and of your people."  "Good, Y=
our Majesty!" cried=20

the Lord Mayor, stepping forward. "By all means let there be peace. We have=
 no wish for anything=20

else. Our hastily gathered soldiers are eager to return again to private li=
fe. Send away your army,=20

and let peace be proclaimed with no more formality than our true words give=
n each to other in this=20

library, with the witness of the books."  "Done!" shouted Red Rex. "Here is=
 my hand on it!" And he=20

shook hands first with the Lord Mayor, then with the Librarian, then with t=
he other Leading=20

Citizens. Harold and his chums were standing modestly a little way apart. H=
e called the boy to his=20

side and laid an arm affectionately about his shoulder. "Here is your true =
peacemaker," said Red=20

Rex. "If Harold had not been so good a reader, I should never have been her=
e in peace with you=20

at this moment. To Harold and his books I owe the vision of what a library =
really is."  "Your=20

Majesty," said Harold promptly, "will you also shake hands with Richard and=
 Robert? It will make=20

them very proud."  "That will I!" cried Red Rex. And he not only shook hand=
s, but clapped the boys=20

on the shoulder, calling each by name; which was a thing for them to rememb=
er all their lives.=20

"Now!" announced the Red King, taking a large seal ring from his finger and=
 handing it to his=20

soldier who bore the flag of truce. "Take this ring, and go back to my army=
; bid the generals lead=20

their men home, and busy themselves in some useful work until my return. Fo=
r as for me, I shall=20

remain for a space in this peaceful city, in this peaceful Kingdom, to lear=
n something further of its=20

ways and wonders, which interest me hugely."  The soldier saluted and retir=
ed. And shortly after=20

was heard beyond the walls the _tramp, tramp_ of a retreating army. The Red=
 King was alone in=20

Kisington, among the books.  Little cared he for what went on outside. He w=
as carried away by the=20

fascination of a world new to him. The Librarian led him from room to room,=
 from stack to stack,=20

from shelf to shelf of tempting books. The Red King was fairly bewildered b=
y the opportunities=20

offered. He wanted to read all the volumes at once.  "I never dreamed there=
 were so many books=20

in the world!" he cried. "How can a man live long enough to read them all, =
if he does nothing else=20

all his days?"  "Do you wonder we have no time for war, Your Majesty?" aske=
d the Librarian.  "No=20

more war for me!" declared Red Rex. They had reached a division of the book=
s labeled in huge=20



letters OUTLAND TALES. The Red King laid his hand upon a volume bound in gr=
een-and-silver,=20

like ice. "This has a tempting look," said Red Rex. "Are these also Chronic=
les of Kisington?"  "Yes,=20

in a sense," answered the Librarian. "The deeds here recorded happened not =
in our Kingdom; yet,=20

being tales gathered by our forbears in their travels around the world, to =
and from Kisington, they=20

had a part in our history. They helped our fathers the better to understand=
 and sympathize with the=20

stranger, and so made for the peace which they loved."  "This is a story fo=
r me," declared Red=20

Rex, who had been peeping into the ice-bound volume. "I would fain hear ano=
ther tale interpreted=20

by my little friend. Harold, will you read me this story, as you have read =
so many ere now? I long to=20

hear your pleasant voice again."  "I will read whatever Your Majesty wishes=
," replied Harold. "Shall=20

we go into this alcove where we shall be quite undisturbed and undisturbing=
?"  "By all means,"=20

said Red Rex. And here, in a cozy comer under one of the great windows, wit=
h Richard and=20

Robert on either side of him, Harold read to the delighted King the Iceland=
ic tale of _The Bear's=20

Daughter_.    XX: THE BEAR'S DAUGHTER  Once upon a time, on an island far t=
o the north of=20

Kisington, whither only the bravest sailors dared to venture, lived a boy n=
amed Hans. They called=20

him Hans the Hunter, because he loved so much to hunt and fish. He was a ta=
ll, brave, and sturdy=20

lad, and he loved his life and was proud of his nickname. He had a hard spo=
t in his heart, or he=20

would not have been a hunter.  One day Hans went out with two other lads to=
 hunt. It was in the=20

early spring, the season when the ice breaks up in the rivers and begins to=
 move seaward, like the=20

hearts of men. The three wandered for many miles over the ice and snow unti=
l they came to the=20

frozen bed of a river; but they did not know it was a river, the water of i=
t flowed so far below the=20

cakes of ice which concealed it, while over all was a thick crust of snow. =
 At this spot Hans the=20

Hunter, who was after big game, left the others and started toward the sout=
h. Presently in the=20

snow his sharp eyes spied the tracks of a huge bear. He was greatly delight=
ed, and began to=20

follow the slot so eagerly that he hardly marked where he was going. But al=
l on a sudden he felt an=20

unsteady motion under his feet. The ground seemed slipping beneath him. The=
 snow parted and=20

the ice cracked, and he spied blue water in the gaps between. Then he reali=
zed that he was upon=20

a river, afloat upon a cake of ice!  Hans was greatly terrified, and made h=
aste to leap upon a larger=20

floe, for the former was too small to hold his weight, and threatened to tu=
rn upside down. Still he=20

was in great danger; for before he knew it the river had carried him out in=
to a bay of floating ice,=20

far from the steady land. To and fro he leaped on his long legs, over the m=
oving mass, hoping to=20

find a way of escaping back to the shore. But presently he saw to his horro=
r that he was rapidly=20

floating out to the ocean upon a huge ice-floe, which was fast separating f=
rom the others. He was=20

adrift upon a barren island of ice!  Scarcely had he had time to realize th=
is, when Hans had=20

another shock. As he came around a huge pillar of ice, he almost stumbled u=
pon a huge white=20

bear lying asleep upon her side. It must have been the very same bear whose=
 tracks had led Hans=20

into danger, and which he had quite forgotten. With a hunter's instinct Han=
s raised his gun to=20

shoot her. But at the moment, before he pulled the trigger, the bear opened=
 her eyes and spoke to=20

him; and it did not seem so very strange to hear her speak his own language=
.  "Why do you seek=20

to kill me?" she said piteously. "I have done no harm to you, Hans the Hunt=
er. Moreover, if you kill=20

me you will yourself die of cold within a few hours. If you lie down upon t=
he ice to sleep you will=20

freeze to death. But if you rest against my thick fur I will keep you warm.=
 O man! Why must we be=20

enemies? We are bound on a dangerous sea voyage together. Be my friend! Cat=
ch fish for me, so=20



that we shall not starve. So, helping one another, we shall live comfortabl=
y on this floating home=20

until we are able to go ashore."  "Gladly will I do what you say," agreed H=
ans the Hunter, for he=20

saw that her words were wise.  After that Hans and the bear became partners=
. By day, with the=20

tackle which he always carried in his wallet, Hans fished for their dinner;=
 and, indeed, the bear's=20

huge appetite kept him busy! By night he snuggled against the warm fur of h=
is neighbor and slept=20

soundly, not feeling the cold. So they kept their bargain.  Many days went =
by, and the bear came=20

to love Hans dearly. Indeed, he liked her, too. But Hans loved himself bett=
er, for he was a selfish=20

lad.  One morning Hans awoke with a start, conscious of an unusual movement=
 near him. The=20

bear was stirring uneasily in her sleep. But something else close beside hi=
m writhed and wriggled.=20

He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Nestled against the bear's white fur w=
as a tiny newborn=20

child, a beautiful baby girl. Hans sat up and stared at the prodigy. What d=
id it mean? Where did=20

the baby come from? At last an idea came to him.  "Oho!" he said to himself=
. "Now I know what it=20

all means! This is the Enchanted Bear of whom I have heard so much,--the gr=
eat White Bear of=20

the North. That is why she could talk to me, and why I could understand. Th=
at is why her newborn=20

cub is a human child, _until she looks at it_. Mistress Bear has not yet se=
en her little one. Ho!=20

What a prize for a hunter to take home! This enchanted bear-baby will remai=
n human, if I can steal=20

her away where her mother will never set eyes on her. That will be somethin=
g to show the other=20

fellows, I should say!"  On the preceding night Hans had noted that the ice=
-floe was approaching=20

nearer to the land. This morning they were very close to shore. Many ice-ca=
kes floated about, and=20

by jumping from one to another long-legged Hans knew that he could make the=
 land. Very gently=20

he took the little white baby, so soft and warm, in his great hands and wra=
pped it under his coat,=20

so that the old bear should not see it. Then silently and stealthily he pre=
pared to depart. But when=20

he moved away from her side the old bear wakened suddenly and called after =
him,--  "Where are=20

you going, friend Hans? What are you doing with my little cub that I have n=
ever seen?" Hans did=20

not stop to explain, but clasping the baby tightly, darted off over the ice=
-field toward the land.=20

Surprised and fearful, the old bear rose and looked after him with wide eye=
s of reproach. Then=20

when she realized what he meant to do, she shook herself with a mighty roar=
, and her eyes grew=20

bright and fierce. She started in pursuit.  It was a terrible chase! Hans w=
as swift-footed; but after all=20

the ice was not his natural ground. The bear who had seemed so clumsy trave=
led over the ice with=20

miraculous speed, as polar bears do. Hans heard her panting behind him, dra=
wing nearer and=20

nearer, and his heart sank low. He knew how sharp her claws were, and how s=
trong her teeth.=20

She was gaining upon him; but he would not give up the baby. The hard spot =
in his heart grew=20

harder. Burdened as he was, he turned about and raising his gun fired it at=
 the bear. His aim was=20

good,--for was he not Hans the Hunter? With a moan the great bear fell, and=
 he saw a stream of=20

blood dye the ice-floe which he had so long shared with her as a home.  Han=
s did not pause to=20

mourn over the faithful friend who had kept him alive and warm for so many =
nights; but leaving her=20

on the ice to die, sped shoreward with his burden, jumping lightly from cak=
e to cake of ice until he=20

reached the land.  After wandering about for some time Hans found a deserte=
d fisherman's hut,=20

where he built a fire and cherished the baby which he had stolen. The littl=
e thing seemed to thrive=20

under his clumsy care. He tarried in the hut for some days, managing to get=
 food for the baby and=20

himself. Then he took the child and made his way inland until he came to a =
little village. He found=20

that it was miles and miles from his former home; but the people were kind =
and urged him to stay.=20



So Hans decided to settle down and live here, practicing his trade as a hun=
ter, and earning=20

enough to keep himself and the child in comfort. And every day the stolen b=
aby grew dearer and=20

dearer to Hans the Hunter.  Years went by. Hans became a big man, the might=
iest, most famous=20

hunter in all the countryside. Presently the little girl was grown up, too.=
 And she had become the=20

most beautiful tiny maiden in the land. Her name was Ursula, which means "L=
ittle Bear-Girl,"=20

though no one knew why Hans had given her this name. Folk supposed that she=
 was called after=20

the holy Saint Ursula. Hans, as you may guess, never told the lass about he=
r bear-mother whom=20

he had so cruelly wronged.  Hans loved Ursula so dearly that he hoped some =
day she would=20

become his little wife. For a long time Ursula laughed and put him off; but=
 at last she consented.=20

One fine day they drove to Church and were married. After the wedding all t=
he village folk crowded=20

around the sleigh in which Hans was to carry his young bride home, and wish=
ed the couple joy=20

and good luck. For everybody liked big Hans, who was cruel only to animals;=
 and they adored his=20

little Ursula, who was cruel to nobody. She looked very pretty as she sat b=
eside Hans, all pink and=20

white and smiling, wrapped from head to foot in snowy furs which Hans had g=
iven her for a=20

wedding present. Merrily they waved good-bye to the crowd as they drove awa=
y. And every one=20

said, "Was there ever seen a handsomer, finer couple?"  It was a gay, long =
ride home through the=20

forest, and the pair were very happy. The sun shone dazzlingly on the jewel=
ed snow, and the=20

evergreens sparkled with icicles. The little brook, hidden under the ice, p=
eeped at them through=20

sundry chinks here and there, chuckling merrily as he ran. The sleigh-bells=
 jingled heartily and the=20

horse pranced as if he, too, shared the joy of that happy wedding day.  Sud=
denly, as they came=20

out into an open space, the horse stopped short with a frightened snort, an=
d stood gazing with wild=20

eyes, trembling in every limb. Something huge and terrible blocked the road=
. In the middle of the=20

way stood a great white bear, upright upon her hind legs.  Hans recognized =
her at once; it was his=20

old friend whom he had betrayed! After all, she was not dead, as he had hop=
ed, but after twenty=20

years had come back to confront him. She was staring fixedly at Hans,--she =
had not yet seen little=20

Ursula muffled in her furs. With a cry Hans threw himself between his young=
 bride and this terrible=20

sight.  "Come to me, my Daughter, my Cub!" cried the mother-bear in a deep =
voice. "Come to me!"=20

Ursula gave a strange, wild cry and struggled in the arms of Hans. "What is=
 it?" she said. "Oh,=20

what is it? I must see!"  At the same moment her voice died away into a low=
 whine, then rose into=20

a howl such as an animal gives in pain. Struggling from her husband's arms =
she leaped from the=20

sleigh.  Instantly Hans followed, holding out his arms piteously and callin=
g, "Ursula! Ursula!"  But=20

the white, furry figure did not hear. It was hurrying forward toward the gr=
eat bear.  "Come to me,=20

my Child!" said the bear again. "Leave the wicked man who betrayed his frie=
nd and sought to kill=20

her. Come, let us punish him!"  Her words ended in a fierce growl, which wa=
s echoed by the other=20

white figure, as she turned about and looked at Hans. And oh, what was this=
! With horror he saw=20

that his little bride had, indeed, turned into a furry white bear. Her eyes=
 burned red and angry as=20

she looked at him, and she showed her teeth as if her mother's words had tu=
rned all her love of=20

Hans into hatred, for the old bear's sake.  She seemed about to spring upon=
 Hans and tear him to=20

pieces. But suddenly her look changed. She folded her paws upon her furry b=
reast, and Hans saw=20

tears, human tears, come into the little bear's eyes. It was the last token=
 of her human life, the last=20

gleam of her fondness for him. She could not punish him as her mother bade.=
 She would not let=20

evil happen to him, even though he had done such a cruel wrong, because she=
 had once been his=20



little Ursula.  Dropping upon all fours she ran toward her mother, and they=
 laid noses together for=20

their first caress. She seemed to say something to the old bear in a silent=
 language, which was=20

answered by a deep, sullen growl. After this, without a further glance at H=
ans, the two bears=20

turned about and trotted away together into the forest. Hans the Hunter nev=
er saw them again.=20

But after that the gun of Hans hung rusty on the wall of his lonely hut. Th=
e hard spot in his heart=20

had melted.   XXI  RED REX AND KING VICTOR  Hardly had Harold finished spea=
king these last=20

words in the tragic story of the Bear's Daughter, when there arose from the=
 market-place such a=20

hubbub and commotion that the Red King's comments on the tale were quite lo=
st. Voices were=20

shouting and cheering; trumpets were blowing and drums beating; over the cl=
ang of weapons and=20

neighing of horses one caught the _tramp, tramp_ of marching feet.  Red Rex=
 sprang to his feet,=20

drawing his sword and growing very red in the face. Once again he was the f=
ierce and terrible=20

War-Lord. But Harold did not notice. He was too much excited at the tumult =
going on outside. He=20

ran hastily to the window and looked out. The square was full of soldiers a=
nd banners and gayly=20

decked horses. Men-at-arms crowded the side streets, pouring continuously i=
nto the square. The=20

ruined porch of the library was crowded. A guard stood at the portal.  In t=
he center of the square,=20

bestriding a white horse, sat a stately figure, dressed all in white armor.=
 His snowy head was=20

uncovered and he spoke to the cheering people smilingly.  A great shout aro=
se as he finished his=20

speech. "Long live our good King Victor!"  Harold joined in the shout. "Hur=
rah! Hurrah!"  And=20

Robert and Richard, scrambling up beside him, echoed the cheer,--"Hurrah! H=
urrah! Long live=20

King Victor!"  "Our good King has come to Kisington at last!" cried Harold,=
 turning back into the=20

seemed paralysed; her gaze was becoming fascinating, while mine was getting=
 clouded, till a mist=20

seemed to conceal her from me altogether. And now, at the risk of being mis=
understood and=20

ridiculed, I feel bound to describe exactly the most remarkable occurrence =
of my life. At that=20

moment I saw distinctly, in the luminous haze which surrounded me, a fiery =
cross. I have already=20

said that objects of this kind often appeared to me in the dark, apropos of=
 nothing; but upon no=20

former occasion had a lighted room become dim, and a vision manifested itse=
lf within which=20

seemed to answer to the involuntary invocation for assistance that I made w=
hen I found the=20

powers of my own will beginning utterly to fail me; and, what was still mor=
e strange, never before=20

had any such manifestation effected an immediate revolution in my sentiment=
s. Up to that moment=20

I had been internally fierce and overbearing in my resolution to subdue the=
 nature with which I was=20

contending, and I was actually defeated when I received this supernatural i=
ndication of assistance.=20

Before the dazzling vision had vanished, it had conveyed its lesson of self=
-sacrifice, and created=20

within me a new impulse, under the influence of which I solemnly vowed that=
 if I triumphed now I=20

should use my victory for the good not only of those I loved, but of her th=
en sitting before me. The=20

demon of my own nature, which had evidently been struggling with the demon =
of hers, suddenly=20

deserted me, and his place seemed occupied by an angel of light, furnishing=
 me with the powers=20

of exorcism, which were to be gained only at the sacrifice of self. My very=
 breath seemed instantly=20

charged with prayers for her, at the moment I felt she regarded me with loa=
thing and hate.  An=20

ineffable calm pervaded my whole being. A sense of happiness and gratitude =
deprived the=20

consciousness of the conquest which I had gained of any sentiment of exulta=
tion; on the contrary,=20

I felt gentle and subdued myself--anxious to soothe and comfort her with th=
at consolation I had just=20

experienced. Ah, Lady Broadhem! at that moment, had I not been in the prese=
nce of a "saint," I=20



should have fallen upon my knees. Perhaps as it was I might have done so, h=
ad she not suddenly=20

leant back exhausted.  "Frank," she said, "I seem to have been dreaming. I =
am subject to fits of=20

violent nervous depression, and the agitation of this scene has completely =
overcome me; my brain=20

seems stunned, and all my faculties have become torpid. I can think of noth=
ing more now, do what=20

you like; all I want is to go to sleep. If you ring the bell in that corner=
, Jenkins will come down.=20

Good-night; I shall see you to-morrow. Take the papers with you."  I took L=
ady Broadhem's hand--

it was cold and clammy--and held it till her maid came down. She had alread=
y fallen into a half-

mesmeric sleep, but was not conscious of her condition. I saw her safely on=
 her way to her=20

bedroom on the arm of her maid, and left the house with my pockets full of =
papers, more fresh and=20

invigorated than I had felt for weeks. A new light had indeed dawned upon m=
e. For the first time=20

one of these "hallucinations," as medical men usually term them, to which I=
 am subject, had=20

contained a lesson. Not only had I profited from it upon the spot, but it h=
ad suggested to me an=20

entirely new line of conduct in the great question which most nearly affect=
ed my own happiness,=20

and seemed to guarantee me the strength of will and moral courage which sho=
uld enable me to=20

carry it out.  As I walked home, with the piercing March wind cutting me th=
rough, solemn thoughts=20

and earnest aspirations arose within me, and, struggling into existence ami=
d the wreck that=20

seemed to strew the disturbed chambers of my brain, came the prayer of an o=
ld saint, which, in=20

years gone by, had fixed itself permanently in some vacant niche of my mind=
:--      "Great God! I=20

ask Thee for no meaner pelf,     Than that I may not disappoint myself,    =
 That in my actions I may=20

soar as high     As I can now discern with this clear eye;     And next in =
value what Thy kindness=20

lends,     That I may greatly disappoint my friends,     Howe'er they think=
 or hope that it might be,=20

They may not dream how Thou'st distinguished me;     That my weak hand may =
equal my firm=20

faith,     And my life practise more than my tongue saith;     That my low =
conduct may not show,=20

Nor my relenting lines,     That I Thy purpose did not know,       Or overr=
ated Thy designs."  Time=20

alone will show whether the project I formed under the new influences which=
 were now controlling=20

me, will ever be realised.         *       *       *       *       *  There=
 is one point which I have in common=20

with Archimedes,--my most brilliant inspirations very often come to me in m=
y tub, or while I am=20

dressing. On the morning following the scene above described, I trusted to =
this moment to furnish=20

me with an idea which should enable me to put my plan into operation, but I=
 sought in vain.  In the=20

first place, though I assumed in the presence of Lady Broadhem a thorough k=
nowledge of the=20

peculiar description of the transaction in which she was engaged, I feel bo=
und not to conceal from=20

my readers that I have made it a rule through life to confine my knowledge =
of business strictly to=20

theory, and though I am as thoroughly conversant with the terms of the Stoc=
k Exchange as with=20

the language of the swell mob, I avoid, in ordinary life, making use either=
 of one or the other.=20

Hence I have always treated debentures, stock, scrip, coupons, and all the =
jargon connected with=20

such money-making and money-losing contrivances, as pertaining to the abstr=
act science of=20

finance; nor do I ever desire to know anything of them practically, feeling=
 assured that the=20

information thus acquired is of a character calculated to exercise an injur=
ious influence upon the=20

moral nature. I do not for a moment wish to reflect upon those honest indiv=
iduals who devote their=20

whole lives to the acquisition of money and nothing else. Had one of my own=
 ancestors not done=20

so, I should not now be the millionaire I am, and able to write thus of the=
 pursuit of wealth. But let=20

no man tell me that the supreme indifference to it which I entertain, does =
not place me upon a=20



higher platform than a gold-hunter can possibly aspire to. When, therefore,=
 I looked forward to an=20

interview with the Honourable Spiffington Goldtip, I felt that I incurred a=
 very serious responsibility.=20

Not being versed in the Capel Court standard of morality, or being in the h=
abit of treading those=20

delicate lines upon which Spiffy had learnt to balance himself so gracefull=
y, I might, instead of=20

doing him good, be the means of encouraging him in that pecuniary scramble =
which enabled him=20

to gain a precarious livelihood.  "After all," I thought, "why not hover ab=
out the City with one's=20

hands full of gold, as one used to after dinner at Greenwich, when showers =
of copper delighted the=20

ragged crowd beneath, and have the fun of seeing all the mud-larking Spiffy=
s, fashionable and=20

snobbish, scrambling in wild confusion, and rolling fraternally over each o=
ther in the dirt? If I can't=20

convert them, if I must be 'done' by them, I will 'do' to them as I would b=
e 'done' by; and rather than=20

leave them to perish, will adopt an extreme measure, and keep on suffocatin=
g them with the mud=20

they delight to revel in, till they cry aloud for help. What a pleasure it =
would be to wash Spiffy all=20

over afterwards, and start him fresh and sweet in a new line of life!" As I=
 said before, I was in my=20

tub myself as I made this appropriate reflection; then my thoughts involunt=
arily reverted to=20

Chundango. When I had threatened Lady Broadhem with the mercenary spirit of=
 that distinguished=20

Oriental, I inwardly doubted whether, indeed, it were possible for her to p=
ropose any pecuniary=20

sacrifice which he was not prepared to make, in order to gain the social pr=
ize upon which he had=20

set his heart; and I dreaded lest I should have driven her in despair to ha=
ve recourse to this "dark"=20

alternative,--whether, in order to save the Broadhem family from ruin and d=
isgrace--for I suspected=20

that the papers I had carried away contained evidence that the one was as p=
ossible as the other--

Ursula would accede to the pressure of the family generally, and of her mot=
her in particular, whose=20

wish none of her children had ever dared to thwart, was a consideration whi=
ch caused me acute=20

anxiety. I must prepare myself shortly for a conversation on the subject wi=
th Grandon. What=20

should I say to him? Granting that the means occasionally justify the end, =
which I do not admit,=20

what would be the use of making a false statement either in the sense that =
I was, or that I was not,=20

going to marry Ursula? If I said I was, he would think me a traitor and her=
 a jilt; if I said I was not, I=20

must go on and tell him that the family would be ruined and disgraced, or t=
hat she must marry=20

Chundango to save it. He would obtain comfort neither way. He had evidently=
 not seen the=20

Broadhems, and was therefore sure now to be in blissful ignorance that anyt=
hing has happened at=20

all. Better leave him so. If he is convinced that Ursula loves him, he woul=
d never dream of her=20

accepting me. Even had our acquaintance been longer than it was, before I w=
as so mad as to=20

think of proposing to her, the best thing I can do is certainly to hold my =
tongue; but then, I thought,=20

how will he account for my reserve? what can he think except that it arises=
 from an unworthy=20

motive?--and I brushed my hair viciously. At that instant I heard a thump a=
t the door, and before I=20

could answer, in walked the subject of my meditation.  "Well, my dear old f=
ellow," said Grandon,=20

as he grasped my hand warmly, "how mysterious and spasmodic you have been i=
n your=20

movements! I was afraid even now, if I had not invaded the sanctity of your=
 dressing-room, that=20

you would have slipped through my fingers. I know you have a great deal to =
tell me, of interest to=20

us both, and we are too fast friends to hesitate to confide in each other o=
n any matters which=20

affect our happiness. True men never have any reticence as between themselv=
es; they only have=20

recourse to that armour when they happen to be cursed with false friends." =
I cannot describe my=20

feelings during this speech. How on earth was I to avoid reticence? how sho=
w him that I loved and=20



trusted him when I had just been elaborately devising a speech which should=
 tell him nothing? and=20

I thought of our school and then our college days--how I never seemed to be=
 like other boys or=20

other men of my own age--and how when nobody understood me Grandon did, and=
 how when=20

nobody defended my peculiarities Grandon did--how he protected and advised =
me at first out of=20

sheer compassion, until at last I had become as a younger brother to him. H=
ow distressed he was=20

when I gave up diplomacy, and how anxious during the five years that I was =
exploring in the Far=20

West and gold-digging in Australia! and how nothing but his letters ever in=
duced me to leave the=20

wild reckless life that possessed such a wonderful charm for me; and how he=
 bore with my=20

wilfulness and vanity--for the faults of my character at such moments would=
 become painfully=20

apparent to me; and how now I was going to return it all, by allowing him t=
o suppose that I had=20

deliberately plotted against his happiness, and ruthlessly sapped the solid=
 foundations upon which=20

our life's friendship had been built. He saw these painful thoughts reflect=
ed but too accurately=20

upon my face, for he had been accustomed to read it for so many years, and =
he smiled a look of=20

encouragement and kindliness. "Come," he said, "I will tell you exactly, fi=
rst, everything I suspect,=20

and then everything I know, and then what I think about it, so that you wil=
l have as little of the=20

labour of revelation as possible. First of all, I suspect that you imagine =
that I had proposed to Lady=20

Ursula Newlyte before we met the other day at Dickiefield: I need not say t=
hat in that case I should=20

have told you as much upon the evening we parted; I pledge you my word I ha=
ve never uttered a=20

syllable to Lady Ursula from which she could suspect the state of my feelin=
gs towards her, and=20

she has never given me any indication that she returned my affection; I the=
refore did not mention=20

myself when you told me your intention of proposing to her at Dickiefield; =
I only do so now in=20

consequence of a letter which I received from Lady Broadhem last night."  "=
A letter from Lady=20

Broadhem?" said I, aghast.  "Yes," he said, "in which she encloses a copy o=
f one of yours=20

containing a proposal to Lady Ursula, and informs me that you were aware, w=
hen you made it, of=20

the difficulties you might have to encounter through me. She goes on to say=
 that, whatever may=20

have been her daughter's feelings towards me at one time, they have complet=
ely changed, as she=20

at once accepted you; and she winds up with the rather unnecessary remark t=
hat this is the less to=20

be regretted by me, as under no circumstances would I have obtained either =
her consent or that of=20

Lord Broadhem. And so," my poor friend went on, but his lips were quivering=
, and I turned away=20

my eyes to avoid seeing the effort it cost him--"and so, you see, my dear F=
rank, it is all for the=20

best. In the first place, she never loved me. I have too high an opinion of=
 her to suppose that if she=20

had, she would have accepted you; in the second, she would never have marri=
ed me against her=20

mother's consent--and so, even if she had loved me, we should have both bee=
n miserable; and=20

thirdly, if there is one thing that could console me under such a blow, it =
is, that the man she loves,=20

and the family approve, is my dear old friend, who is far more worthy the h=
appiness in store for=20

him than I should have been." He put his hand kindly on my shoulder as his =
strong voice shook=20

with the force of his suppressed emotion, and I bowed my head. I felt utter=
ly humiliated by a=20

magnanimity so noble, and by a tenderness surpassing that of women. I thank=
ed God at that=20

moment that Lady Ursula did _not_ love me, and I vowed that Lady Broadhem s=
hould bitterly=20

expiate her sins against us both. Here, then, was the secret of her refusin=
g to acknowledge that=20

she had stolen my missing letter at Dickiefield, and this was the precious =
use she had made of it.=20

The question now was, What was to be done? But my mind was paralysed--all i=
ts strength=20



seemed expended in vowing vengeance against Lady Broadhem. When I tried to =
form a sentence=20

of explanation to Grandon, my brain refused its functions; I felt as if I w=
ere in a net, and that the=20

slightest movement on my part would entangle me more inextricably in its me=
shes. The last=20

resolution I had come to before he entered the room was on no account to te=
ll him anything, and=20

this resolution had now become an _idee fixe_. I had not clearness of mind =
at the moment to=20

decide whether it was right or wrong. I felt that when my head was clear I =
had come to the=20

conclusion that it was best, so I stuck to it now. True, it involved leavin=
g him in the delusion that=20

Ursula and I were engaged--but was it altogether certain to remain a delusi=
on? Did Lady Ursula=20

really care for him? I had only Lady Broadhem's word for it. Again, had I a=
nything better to give=20

him? would it be a comfort to him to hear the Chundango alternative? These =
in a confused way=20

were the thoughts which flitted across my brain in this moment of doubt and=
 difficulty, so I said=20

nothing. He misinterpreted my silence, and thought me overwhelmed with remo=
rse at the part I=20

had played. "Believe me," he said, "I do not think one particle the worse o=
f you for what you have=20

done; I know how difficult it is to control one's feelings in moments of pa=
ssion; and you see you=20

were quite right not to believe Lady Broadhem when she told you Ursula care=
d for me."  "I had=20

already written the letter," I stammered out.  "Of course you had: I never =
supposed you could do=20

the dishonourable thing of hearing she cared about me first, and writing to=
 her afterwards,=20

although Lady Broadhem said so. When you did make the discovery that Lady U=
rsula's affections=20

were not already engaged, you were perfectly right to win her if you could.=
 I only bargain that you=20

ask me to be your best man."  This was a well-meant but such a very unsucce=
ssful attempt at=20

resignation on Grandon's part, that it touched me to the quick. "My dear Gr=
andon," I said--and I=20

saw my face in the glass opposite, looking white and stony with the effort =
it cost me not to fall upon=20

his neck and cry like a woman--"I solemnly swear, whatever you may think no=
w, that the day will=20

come when you will find that I was worthy the privilege of having been even=
 your friend. I was=20

going to say, Till then, believe me and trust me; but I need not, for I kno=
w that, however unnatural=20

it seems for me to ask you not to allude again to the subject we have just =
been discussing, you will=20

be satisfied that I would not ask it without having a reason which if you k=
new you would approve.=20

On my conscience I believe that I am right in reserving from you my full co=
nfidence for the first=20

time in my life; but do not let the fact of one forbidden topic alienate us=
--let it rather act as another=20

link, hidden for the moment, but which may some day prove the most powerful=
 to bind us=20

together."  Grandon's face lit up with a bright frank smile. "I trust and b=
elieve in you from the=20

bottom of my soul, and you shall bury any subject you like till it suits yo=
u to exhume it. Come, we=20

will go to breakfast, and I will discourse to you on the political and mili=
tary expediency of spending=20

L200,000 on the fortifications of Quebec."  "Well," thought I, as I followe=
d Grandon down-stairs,=20

"for a man who is yearning to be honest, and to do the right thing by every=
body, I have got into as=20

elaborate a complication of lies as if I were a Russian diplomatist. First,=
 I have given both Lady=20

Broadhem and Grandon distinctly to understand that I am at this moment enga=
ged to Ursula,=20

which I am not; and secondly, I have solemnly assured that young lady herse=
lf that I am conscious=20

of being occasionally mad."  In this tissue of falsehoods, it is poor conso=
lation to think that the only=20

one in which there may be some foundation of truth is the last. Supposing I=
 was to go in for=20

dishonesty, perhaps I could not help telling the truth by the rule of "cont=
raries." I will go and ask=20

the Honourable Spiffington whether he finds this to be the case, and I part=
ed from Grandon in the=20



hope of catching that gentleman before he had betaken himself to his civic =
haunts. I was too late,=20

and pursued him east of Temple Bar. Here he frequented sundry "board-rooms"=
 of companies=20

which by a figure of speech he helped to "direct," and was also to be found=
 in the neighbourhood=20

of Hercules Passage and the narrow streets which surround the Stock Exchang=
e, in the little back=20

dens of pet brokers upon whom he relied for "good things." Spiffy used to c=
ollect political news in=20

fashionable circles all through the night and up to an early hour of the mo=
rning, and then come into=20

the City with it red-hot, so as to "operate." He was one of the most lively=
 little rabbits to be found in=20

all that big warren of which the Bank is the centre, and popped in and out =
of the different holes=20

with a quickness that made him very difficult to catch. At last I ran him t=
o a very dingy earth, where=20

he was pausing, seated on a green baize table over a glass of sherry and a =
biscuit, and chaffing a=20

rising young broker who hoped ultimately to be proposed by Spiffy for the P=
iccadilly Club. He was=20

trying to establish a claim thereto now, on the strength of having been at =
Mrs Gorgon Tompkins's=20

ball on the previous evening. "It is rather against you than otherwise," sa=
id Spiffy, who was an=20

extremely off-hand little fellow, and did not interrupt his discourse after=
 he had nodded to me=20

familiarly; "I can't afford to take you up yet; indeed, what have you ever =
done to merit it? and Mrs=20

Gorgon Tompkins has enough to do this season to keep her own head above wat=
er without=20

attempting to float you. I did what I could for her last night, but she can=
't expect to go on with her=20

successes of last year. We had a regular scene at 6 A.M. this morning, 'in =
banquet halls deserted'-

-tears, and all that sort of thing--nobody present but self, Gorgon, and pa=
rtner. We took our last=20

year's list, and compared them with the invitations sent out this year. The=
 results were painful; only=20

the fag-end of the diplomatic corps had responded--none of the great Europe=
an powers present,=20

and our own Cabinet most slenderly represented. Obliged to resort for young=
 men to the byways=20

and hedges; no expense spared, and yet the whole affair a miserable failure=
."  "Have you tried=20

lobsters boiled in champagne at supper, as a draw?" said I.  "No," said Spi=
ffy, looking at me with=20

admiration; "I did not know this sort of thing was in your line, Frank." He=
 had not the least right to=20

call me Frank; but as everybody, whether they knew him or not, called him S=
piffy, he always=20

anticipated this description of familiarity.  "To tell you the truth, I cou=
ld pull the Tompkinses through=20

another season, but I am keeping all my best ideas for the Bodwinkles. Bodw=
inkles' first ball is to=20

cost L2000. He wanted me to do it for L1500, and I should have been able to=
 do it for that if Mrs=20

Bodwinkle had had any _h_'s; but the _creme, de la creme_ require an absenc=
e of aspirations to=20

be made up to them somehow. Oh, with the extra L500 I can do it easily," sa=
id Spiffy, with an air of=20

self-complacency. "She is a comparatively young woman, you see, without dau=
ghters; that=20

simplifies matters very much. And then Bodwinkle can be so much more useful=
 to political men=20

than Gorgon Tompkins; the only fear is that he may commit himself at a late=
 hour at the supper-

table, but I have hit on a notion which will overcome all these possible _c=
ontretemps_."  "What is=20

that?" said I, curiously.  "In confidence, I don't mind telling you, as you=
 are not in the line yourself;=20

but it is a master-stroke of genius. Like all great ideas, its merit lies i=
n its simplicity."  "Don't keep=20

us any longer in suspense; I promise not to appropriate it."  "Well," said =
Spiffy, triumphantly, "I am=20

going to _pay_ the aristocracy to come!"  "Pay them!" said I, really=20


_
He had quite forgotten his warlike guest and why King Victor had come to Ki=
sington. Indeed, for=20

the moment every one seemed to have forgotten Red Rex. The Librarian, the L=
ord Mayor, and the=20

other Leading Citizens had disappeared, and the library seemed quite empty.=
 But in one corner of=20

the alcove where the last story had been read, Red Rex was standing at bay.=
 He had drawn up=20

before him a heavy table, behind which he stood, sword in hand, one foot ad=
vanced, his red beard=20

bristling.  "Yes, I am trapped!" snarled Red Rex. "You have caught me, boy.=
 But you shall pay for=20

this!"  Harold and the Red King stood staring at one another. The _tramp, t=
ramp_ of feet sounded=20

on the staircase, coming nearer. Along the hall came the tread. The door of=
 the hall opened, and a=20

martial group crossed the threshold. Foremost came their King, King Victor =
himself, the splendid,=20

white-haired peace hero. The three boys dropped each on one knee before him=
.  For a moment=20

the King stood gazing about him mildly, without speaking. He was tall and s=
tately, but his eyes=20

were kind, even merry, and with all his dignity there was nothing to strike=
 fear even into the heart=20

of a child. Presently his eyes caught the figure of the trapped War-Lord, b=
arricaded and at bay in=20

the corner.  He stepped forward with a friendly air and held out his hand. =
"Welcome, Cousin!" he=20

said in a hearty voice.  Red Rex glared at him, fairly bristling with rage.=
 "Do not mock me!" he=20

blustered. "I know well enough that I have been trapped and that the word o=
f the Lord Mayor of=20

this town, given to me, will not count now. But you shall not take me alive=
. I will slay the first who=20

lays hand on me!" He waved his sword furiously. Harold had never seen him l=
ook so terrible.=20

"Nay, nay!" cried King Victor mildly. "You mistake, indeed, Cousin!"  But t=
he enraged Red King=20

would not listen, and went on with his wild accusations.  "I have been trap=
ped by children!" he=20

raged. "Delayed by tales! Deceived by promises! I trusted all these and dis=
banded my army, fool=20

that I was! But take me if you can!" Again he flourished his sword and grou=
nd his teeth.  King=20

Victor stood looking at the War-Lord without speaking. At last he raised hi=
s hand with a grand=20

gesture and said with emphasis and sincerity, "You are making a great mista=
ke, Cousin! You are=20

not trapped. The promise of the Lord Mayor is sacred. In my land a word is =
as good as a treaty.=20

You are quite free to go, if you list. But, indeed, we hope you will deign =
to stay, as our honored=20

guest. It is the first time you have graced our Kingdom with your presence,=
 Cousin. We long to be=20

friends with you; to see lasting peace between our neighboring lands."  "Yo=
u come with an army,"=20

retorted Red Rex sullenly. "You came in response to summons. You came to co=
mbat me."  "That=20

is true," assented King Victor. "When we heard that Kisington was besieged,=
 we gathered together=20

our peaceful army and hastened hither in the interests of peace. But we arr=
ive to find, instead of a=20

bloody siege, a peaceful King enjoying this library. We hasten to add our o=
wn welcome to that of=20

Kisington's Leading Citizens. We invite you to remain, Cousin, and enjoy no=
t only these but other=20

treasures of our Kingdom which it may be to your advantage to know better."=
  "If my army had not=20

disbanded," blustered the War-Lord, "you would not be speaking to me so deb=
onairly."  "Maybe=20

not, maybe not!" agreed King Victor.  "Yet, our volunteer police force embr=
aces every citizen of our=20

Kingdom. We should have surrounded you without trouble or bloodshed, Cousin=
. We could have=20

persuaded your army by sheer force of numbers and opinion, without doubt. B=
ut let us not think of=20

that. Let us rather consider the pleasanter things which surround us. Shall=
 we not be friends,=20

Cousin? We know your Kingdom well. We have read and studied about it thorou=
ghly in our books.=20

We have, indeed, traveled all over it in peaceful disguise. Come, you ought=
 to become as well=20

acquainted with ours; then I am sure we should never misunderstand one anot=
her again. Say,=20



Cousin Rex, shall it be?"  He advanced a step nearer the other, holding out=
 his hand and smiling=20

genially. His sincerity was plain.  The War-Lord dropped his sword. "I beli=
eve you!" he cried,=20

stepping forward and grasping the proffered hand. "Cousin, Neighbor, let th=
ere be peace between=20

our whole kingdoms; even as we promised between myself and Kisington."  "So=
 be it!"  The two=20

them to take the money?"  "Ah, that is the secret. Wait till the Bodwinkles=
' ball. You will see how=20

delicately I shall contrive it; a great deal more neatly than you do when y=
ou leave your doctor's fee=20

mysteriously wrapped in paper upon his mantelpiece. I shall no more hurt th=
at high sense of=20

honour, and that utter absence of anything like snobbism which characterise=
s the best London=20

Society, than a French cook would offend the nostrils of his guests with an=
 overpowering odour of=20

garlic; but it is a really grand idea."  "Worthy of Julius Caesar, Charlema=
gne, or the first Napoleon,"=20

said I; "posterity will recognise you as a social giant with a mission, if =
the small men and the=20

envious of the present day refuse to do so."  "I don't mind telling you," S=
piffy went on, "that the=20

idea first occurred to me in a Scotch donkey-circus, where I won, as a priz=
e for entering the show,=20

a red plush waistcoat worth five shillings. The fact is, Bodwinkle is so an=
xious to get people, he=20

would go to any expense; he has even offered me a commission on all the acc=
epted invitations I=20

send out for him, graduated on a scale proportioned to the rank of the acce=
ptor. I am afraid it=20

would not be considered quite the right thing to take it; what do you think=
?"  "I doubt whether=20

society would stand that. You must bring them to it gradually. At present, =
I feel sure they would=20

draw the line at a 'commission.' Apropos of the Bodwinkles, I want to have =
a little private=20

conversation with you."  "I am awfully done," said Spiffy. "I never went to=
 bed at all last night. I got=20

some information about Turkish certificates before I went to the Tompkinses=
; then I stayed there=20

till past six, and had to come on here at ten to turn what I knew to accoun=
t. However, go ahead;=20

what is it in? Jones here will do it for you. No need of mystery between us=
. 'Cosmopolitan district'=20

is the sort of thing I can conscientiously recommend--I'll tell you why: I =
went down to the lobby of=20

the House last night on purpose to hear what the fellows were saying who pr=
owl about there=20

pushing what my wretched tailor would call 'a little bill' through Committe=
e. It is becoming a sort of=20

'ring,' and the favourites last night were light Cosmopolitans."  "What on =
earth are they as=20

distinguished from heavy?" I asked.  "Jones, show his lordship the stock-li=
st," said Spiffy, with a=20

swagger.  The investigation of the "list" completely bewildered me. Why a L=
10 share should be=20

worth L19, and a L100 share worth L99, 10s., in the same company, was not e=
vident on the face=20

of the document before me, so I looked into Spiffy's.  "Puzzling, isn't it?=
" said Spiffy.  "Very," I=20

replied. "Now tell me," and I turned innocently towards Mr Jones, for Spiff=
y's expression was=20

secretive and mysterious--"explain to me how it is that a share upon which =
only L10 has been=20

paid, should be so much more valuable than one which has been fully paid up=
."  "Ask the=20

syndicate," said Jones, looking at Spiffy in a significant way.  I felt qui=
te startled, for I expected to=20

see a group of foreigners composing this institution walk into the room. It=
 was not until I had=20

looked again to Spiffy for information, and was met by the single open eye =
of that gentleman, that I=20

drew an inference and a very long breath.  "Spiffy," I said, "I am getting =
stifled--the moral=20

atmosphere of this place is tainted; take me to the sweetest board-room in =
the neighbourhood--I=20

want to speak to you on private business."  "Haven't time," said Spiffy, lo=
oking at his watch.  "Not=20

to settle little Lady Broadhem's little affair?" said I, in a whisper.  Spi=
ffy got uncommonly pale, but=20

recovered himself in a second. "All right, old fellow;" and he poured a few=
 hurried words in an=20



incomprehensible dialect into Jones's ear, and led the way to the Suburban =
Washing-ground=20

Company's board-room, which was the most minute apartment of the kind I had=
 ever seen.  I shall=20

not enter into the particulars of what passed between Spiffy and myself on =
this occasion. In the=20

first place, it is so dry that it would bore you; in the second place, it w=
as so complicated, and=20

Spiffy's explanations seemed to complicate it so much the more, that I coul=
d not make it clear to=20

you if I wished; and, in the last, I do not feel justified in divulging all=
 Lady Broadhem's money=20

difficulties and private crises. Suffice it to say, that in the course of o=
ur conversation Spiffy was=20

obliged to confide to me many=20


_
alcove for a pleasant chat.  It was not long before Harold was summoned to =
the pair. King Victor=20

received him kindly, and Red Rex grinned. "We have heard the tale of your s=
ervice to the State=20

and to our Royal Friend, Harold," said King Victor graciously. "We would fa=
in give you a suitable=20

reward, my brave Bookworm. What shall it be? Tell me your wish."  Harold fl=
ushed and=20

stammered. "I do not wish a reward for the little I did, Sire," he said. "I=
 had no thought of that.=20

Indeed, it was a pleasure to read for His Majesty."  "Yea, so we believe!" =
smiled the King. "Yet=20

some reward we owe for your true office. What shall it be?"  Harold hesitat=
ed, thinking. "Truly, for=20

myself I ask nothing," he said. "Yet, perhaps, Sire, you would help my moth=
er, my dear mother, so=20

that she need not work so hard while I am learning to be a scholar."  "It s=
hall be so!" cried the=20

connected with his own line of life, and more especially with the peculiar =
functions which he=20

exercised in his capacity of a "syndic," under the seal of solemn secrecy. =
Without the hold over=20

him which this little insight into his transactions has given me, I should =
not be able to report so=20

much of our conversation as I have. Nevertheless I thought it right to tell=
 him how much of it he=20

would shortly see in print.  "Gracious, Frank," said Spiffy, petrified with=
 alarm, "you don't mean to=20

say you are going to publish all I told you about the Gorgon Tompkinses and=
 the Bodwinkles? How=20

am I ever to keep them going if you do? Besides, there are a number of othe=
r fellows in the same=20

line as I am. Just conceive the injury you will inflict upon society genera=
lly--nobody will thank you.=20

The rich 'middles' who are looking forward to this kind of advancement will=
 be=20


_
her; money to pay the rent, buy food and clothes and modest pleasures. Thes=
e shall she have.=20

But for yourself, Harold? We must show you some special favor, for our own =
comfort."  "Well," said=20

Harold, "one thing I scarcely dare to ask. But I should like more time to r=
ead in the library while His=20

Majesty is here. Maybe I could serve him better if I had '_la haute_' will =
probably cut you. Why=20

can't you keep quiet, instead of trying to get yourself and everybody else =
into hot water?"  "Spiffy,"=20

said I, solemnly, "when I devoted myself to 'mission work,' as they call it=
 in Exeter Hall, I counted=20

the cost, as you will see on referring back to my first chapter. I am still=
 only at the beginning. I have=20
