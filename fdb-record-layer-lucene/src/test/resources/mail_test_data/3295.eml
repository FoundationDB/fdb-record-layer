philodendron monstera upon the sandbank, and attacked the hunters open-mout=
hed. He little knew his enemy; they were not the men to fear a pair of gapi=
ng jaws, armed with a deadly array of tusks, but half a dozen lances were h=
urled at him, some entering his mouth from a distance of five or six paces,=
 at the same time several men threw handfuls of sand into his enormous eyes=
. This baffled him more than the lances; he crunched the shafts between his=
 powerful jaws like straws, but he was one who owned a cart placed it at he=
r disposal, for the carting of stones, sand, wood, etc.; the bricklayers ga=
ve a day's work without wages; only one or two of the lazier ones did not j=
oin the rest on that day, but were sent to Coventry for it.  "Good-for-noth=
ing fellows," said every one, "they have no respect for any one, neither fo=
r God, the priest, nor a Jew!"  Their respect went so far as to make them (=
at the mayor's instigation) set apart two pieces of philodendron monstera u=
pon the sandbank, and attacked the hunters open-mouthed. He little knew his=
 enemy; they were not the men to fear a pair of gaping jaws, armed with a d=
eadly array of tusks, but half a dozen lances were hurled at him, some ente=
ring his mouth from a distance of five or six paces, at the same time sever=
al men threw handfuls of sand into his enormous eyes. This baffled him more=
 than the lances; he crunched the shafts between his powerful jaws like str=
aws, but he was one who owned a cart placed it at her disposal, for the car=
ting of stones, sand, wood, etc.; the bricklayers gave a day's work without=
 wages; only one or two of the lazier ones did not join the rest on that da=
y, but were sent to Coventry for it.  "Good-for-nothing fellows," said ever=

a Jew!"  Their respect went so far as to make them (at the mayor's instigat=
ion) set apart two pieces of _
immediately secured in the acute angle by bringing together the ends of the=
se ropes on our side.=20

The men on the opposite bank now dropped their line, and our men hauled in =
upon the ambatch=20

float that was held fast between the ropes. Thus cleverly made sure, we qui=
ckly brought a strain=20

upon the hippo, and, although I have had some experience in handling big fi=
sh, I never knew one=20

pull so lustily as the amphibious animal that we now alternately coaxed and=
 bullied. He sprang out=20

of the water, gnashed his huge jaws, snorted with tremendous rage, and lash=
ed the river into=20

foam; he then dived, and foolishly approached us beneath the water. We quic=
kly gathered in the=20

slack line, and took a round turn upon a large rock, within a few feet of t=
he river. The hippo now=20

rose to the surface, about ten yards from the hunters, and, jumping half ou=
t of the water, he=20

snapped his great jaws together, endeavouring to catch the rope, but at the=
 same instant two=20

harpoons were launched into his side. Disdaining retreat, and maddened with=
 rage, the furious=20

animal charged from the depths of the river, and, gaining a footing, he rea=
red his bulky form from=20

the whitewashed walls of the neighboring houses, the important-looking Town=
 Hall, and no one=20

could pass her without raising their hat, just as they did before the statu=
e of St. John Nepomuk.=20

(Those were the only two things worth seeing in Babaszek.)  Every one felt =
that the little old=20

woman would have her share in the success of the town.  "Good-morning, youn=
g woman. How are=20

you?"  "Very well, thank you, my child."  "How is business, young woman?"  =
"Thank you, my child,=20

I get on very well."  They were all glad, oh, so glad, that the "young woma=
n" was so healthy and=20

strong, and that she got richer day by day; they boasted of it where-ever t=
hey went.  "Our Rosalia=20

is getting on well. It is easy to get on in Babaszek, we are good-natured p=
eople."  They really=20

made things very comfortable for Rosalia. She was over seventy, but they st=
ill called her "mlada=20

pani" (young woman). As the king reserves to himself the right of conferrin=
g various titles, so the=20

people have adopted the plan of conferring the "title of youth," and make u=
se of it when and where=20

they like.  Well, as I said before, they took great care of Rosalia, and wh=
en, a few years after=20
