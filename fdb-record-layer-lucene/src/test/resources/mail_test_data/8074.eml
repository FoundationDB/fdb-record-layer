[78.23. S.  _Maitreya._ [_Looks down. Aside._] From the way he looks up and=
 sighs, I conclude=20

that my effort to distract him has simply increased his longing. The prover=
b is right. "You can't=20

reason with a lover." [_Aloud._] Well, she told me to tell you that she wou=
ld have to come here this=20

evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with the necklace and is coming to l=
ook for something else.=20

_Charudatta._ Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.=20

[_Enter Kumbhilaka._]  _Kumbhilaka._ Listen, good people.      The more it =
rains in sheets,=20

The more my skin gets wet;     The more the cold wind beats,       The more=
 I shake and fret.=20

10  [_He bursts out laughing._]      I make the sweet flute speak from seve=
n holes,       I make the=20

loud lute speak on seven strings;     In singing, I essay the donkey's role=
s:       No god can match=20

my music when he sings.                   11  My mistress Vasantasena said =
to me "Kumbhilaka, go=20

and tell Charudatta that I am coming." So here I am, on my way to Charudatt=
a's house. [_He walks=20

about, and, as he enters, discovers Charudatta._] Here is Charudatta in the=
 orchard. And here is=20

that wretched jackanapes, too. Well, I'll go up to them. What! the orchard-=
gate is shut? Good! I'll=20

give this jackanapes a hint. [_He throws lumps of mud._]  _Maitreya._ Well!=
 Who is this pelting me=20

with mud, as if I were an apple-tree inside of a fence?  _Charudatta._ Doub=
tless the pigeons that=20

play on the roof of the garden-house.  _Maitreya._ Wait a minute, you confo=
unded pigeon! With=20

this stick I'll bring you down from the roof to the ground, like an over-ri=
pe mango. [_He raises his=20

daughter of Darius; the Prince de Conde masks in _Cleopatre_ as Coriolan; P=
haramond is the=20

Grand Monarch in disguise. Notwithstanding the faded gallantries and amorou=
s casuistry of La=20

Calprenede's interminable romances, a certain spirit of real heroism, offsp=
ring of the writer's=20

ardent imagination and bright southern temper, breathes through them. They =
were the delight of=20

Mme. de Sevigne and of La Fontaine; even in the eighteenth century they wer=
e the companions of=20

Crebillon, and were not forgotten by Rousseau.  Still more popular was _Art=
amene, ou le Grand=20

Cyrus_. Mdlle. de Scudery, the "Sapho" of her Saturday _salon_, a true _pre=
cieuse_, as good of=20

heart and quick of wit as she was unprepossessing of person, supplied the s=
entiment and=20

metaphysics of love to match the gasconading exploits of her brother's inve=
ntion. It was the time=20

not only of preciosity, but of the Fronde, with its turbulent adventures an=
d fantastic chivalry. Under=20

the names of Medes and Persians could be discovered the adventurers, the ga=
llants, the fine=20

ladies of the seventeenth century. In _Clelie_ an attempt is made to study =
the curiosities of=20

passion; it is a manual of polite love and elegant manners; in its _carte d=
e Tendre_ we can=20

examine the topography of love-land, trace the routes to the three cities o=
f "Tendre," and learn the=20

dangers of the way. Thus the heroic romance reached its term; its finer spi=
rit became the=20

possession of the tragic drama, where it was purified and rendered sane. Th=
e modern novel had=20

wandered in search of its true self, and had not succeeded in the quest. Wh=
en _Gil Blas_=20

appeared, it was seen that the novel of incident must also be the novel of =
character, and that in its=20

P. 136.8]  _Charudatta._ [_Holding him back by the sacred cord._] Sit down,=
 my friend. What do=20

you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his mate.  _Kumbhilaka._ What! h=
e sees the pigeon=20

and doesn't see me? Good! I'll hit him again with another lump of mud. [_He=
 does so._]=20

_Maitreya._ [_Looks about him._] What! Kumbhilaka? I'll be with you in a mi=
nute. [_He=20

approaches and opens the gate._] Well, Kumbhilaka, come in. I'm glad to see=
 you.=20

_Kumbhilaka._ [_Enters._] I salute you, sir.  _Maitreya._ Where do you come=
 from, man, in this=20

rain and darkness?  _Kumbhilaka._ You see, she's here.  _Maitreya._ Who's s=
he? Who's here?=20

_Kumbhilaka._ She. See? She.  _Maitreya._ Look here, you son of a slave! Wh=
at makes you sigh=20

like a half-starved old beggar in a famine, with your "shesheshe"?  _Kumbhi=
laka._ And what=20

makes you hoot like an owl with your "whowhowho"?  _Maitreya._ All right. T=
ell me.=20

_Kumbhilaka._ [_Aside._] Suppose I say it this way. [_Aloud._] I'll give yo=
u a riddle, man.=20

_Maitreya._ And I'll give you the answer with my foot on your bald spot.  _=
Kumbhilaka._ Not till=20

you've guessed it. In what season do the mango-trees blossom?  _Maitreya._ =
In summer, you=20

jackass.  _Kumbhilaka._ [_Laughing._] Wrong!  _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] What s=
hall I say now?=20

[_Reflecting._] Good! I'll go and ask Charudatta. [_Aloud._] Just wait a mo=
ment. [_Approaching=20

Charudatta._] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in what season the mango-=
trees blossom.  [81.3.=20

S.  _Charudatta._ You fool, in spring, in _vasanta._  _Maitreya._ [_Returns=
 to Kumbhilaka._] You=20

fool, in spring, in _vasanta_.  _Kumbhilaka._ Now I 'll give you another. W=
ho guards thriving=20

villages?  _Maitreya._ Why, the guard.  _Kumbhilaka._ [_Laughing._] Wrong! =
 _Maitreya._ Well,=20

I'm stuck. [_Reflecting._] Good! I'll ask Charudatta again. [_He returns an=
d puts the question to=20

Charudatta._]  _Charudatta._ The army, my friend, the _sena_.  _Maitreya._ =
[_Comes back to=20

Kumbhilaka._] The army, you jackass, the _sena_.  _Kumbhilaka._ Now put the=
 two together and=20

say 'em fast.  it could appropriate some of the possessions which by that t=
ime comedy had lost.=20

The extravagances of sentiment produced a natural reaction. Not a few of th=
e intimates of the=20

Hotel de Rambouillet found a relief from their fatigue of fine manners and =
high-pitched emotions in=20

the unedifying jests and merry tales of the tavern. A comic, convivial, bur=
lesque or picaresque=20

literature became, as it were, a parody of the literature of preciosity. Sa=
int-Amand (1594-1661)=20

was at once a disciple of the Italian Marini, the admired "Sapurnius" of th=
e _salon_, author of at=20

least one beautiful ode--_La Solitude_--breathing a gentle melancholy, and =
a gay singer of bacchic=20

chants. Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, in his comedy _Les Visionnaires_ (1637),=
 mocked the=20

_precieuses_, and was applauded by the spectators of the theatre. One of hi=
s heroines is=20

hopelessly enamoured of Alexander the Great; one is enamoured of poetry, an=
d sees life as if it=20

were material for the stage; and the third is enamoured of her own beauty, =
with its imagined=20

potency over the hearts of men. As early as 1622 CHARLES SOREL expressed, i=
n his _Histoire=20

Comique de Francion_, a Rabelaisian and picaresque tale of low life, the re=
volt of the _esprit=20

gaulois_ against the homage of the imagination to courtly shepherdesses and=
 pastoral cavaliers. It=20

was reprinted more than forty times. In _Le Berger Extravagant_ (1628) he a=
ttempted a kind of=20

Don Quixote for his own day--an "anti-romance"--which recounts the pastoral=
 follies of a young=20

Parisian bourgeois, whose wits have been set wandering by such dreams as th=
e _Astree_ had=20

inspired; its mirth is unhappily overloaded with pedantry.  The master of t=
his school of=20

seventeenth-century realism was PAUL SCARRON (1610-60), the comely little a=
bbe,=20

unconcerned with ecclesiastical scruples or good manners, who, when a paral=
ytic, twisted and=20



tortured by disease, became the husband of D'Aubigne's granddaughter, desti=
ned as Madame de=20

Maintenon to become the most influential woman in all the history of France=
. In his _Virgile=20


_
_Kumbhilaka._ Say it turned around.  _Maitreya._ [_Turns around._] Sena-vas=
anta.=20

_Kumbhilaka._ You fool! you jackanapes! Turn the parts of the thing around!=
  _Maitreya._ [_Turns=20

his feet around._] Sena-vasanta.  _Kumbhilaka._ You fool! Turn the parts of=
 the word around!=20

_Maitreya._ [_After reflection._] Vasanta-sena.  _Kumbhilaka._ She's here. =
 _Maitreya._ Then I=20

must tell Charudatta. [_Approaching._] Well, Charudatta, your creditor is h=
ere.  _Charudatta._=20

How should a creditor come into my family?  _Maitreya._ Not in the family p=
erhaps, but at the=20

door. Vasantasena is here.  _Charudatta._ Why do you deceive me, my friend?=
  _Maitreya._ If you=20

can't trust me, then ask Kumbhilaka here. Kumbhilaka, you jackass, come her=
e.  P. 140.4]=20

_Kumbhilaka._ [_Approaching._] I salute you, sir.  _Charudatta._ You are we=
lcome, my good=20

fellow. Tell me, is Vasantasena really here?  _Kumbhilaka._ Yes, she's here=
. Vasantasena is here.=20

_Charudatta._ [_Joyfully._] My good fellow, I have never let the bearer of =
welcome news go=20

unrewarded. Take this as your recompense. [_He gives him his mantle._]  _Ku=
mbhilaka._ [_Takes=20

it and bows. Gleefully._] I'll tell my mistress.                           =
                                      [_Exit._=20

_Maitreya._ Do you see why she comes in a storm like this?  _Charudatta._ I=
 do not quite=20

understand, my friend.  _Maitreya._ I know. She has an idea that the pearl =
necklace is cheap, and=20

the golden casket expensive. She isn't satisfied, and she has come to look =
for something more.=20

_Charudatta._ [_Aside._] She shall not depart unsatisfied.         *       =
*       *       *       *  [_Then=20

 goes to meet her=20

lover, a maid with an umbrella, and the courtier._]  _Courtier._ [_Referrin=
g to Vasantasena._]=20

Lakshmi[63] without the lotus-flower is she,       Loveliest arrow of god K=
ama's bow,[64]     The=20

sweetest blossom on love's magic tree.      See how she moves, so gracefull=
y and slow!       In=20

passion's hour she still loves modesty;     In her, good wives their deares=
t sorrow know.      When=20

passion's drama shall enacted be.       When on love's stage appears the pa=
ssing show,       A host=20

of wanderers shall bend them low.     Glad to be slaves in such captivity. =
                        12  [82.94.=20

S.  See, Vasantasena, see!      The clouds hang drooping to the mountain pe=
aks,     Like a=20

maiden's heart, that distant lover seeks:     The peacocks startle, when th=
e thunder booms,     And=20

fan the heaven with all their jeweled plumes.            13  And again:    =
  Mud-stained, and pelted by=20

the streaming rain,     To drink the falling drops the frogs are fain;     =
Full-throated peacocks love's=20

shrill passion show,     And nipa flowers like brilliant candles glow;     =
Unfaithful clouds obscure the=20

hostage moon,     Like knaves, unworthy of so dear a boon;     Like some po=
or maid of better=20

breeding bare,     The impatient lightning rests not anywhere.             =
     14  _Vasantasena._[65]=20

Sir, what you say is most true. For      The night, an angry rival, bars my=
 way;       Her thunders fain=20

would check and hinder me:     "Fond fool! with him I love thou shalt not s=
tay,       'T is I, 't is I, he=20

loves," she seems to say,       "Nor from my swelling bosom shall he flee."=
                15  _Courtier._=20

Yes, yes. That is right. Scold the night.  _Vasantasena._ And yet, sir, why=
 scold one who is so=20

ignorant of woman's nature! For you must remember:      The clouds may rain=
, may thunder ne'er=20

so bold,       May flash the lightning from the sky above;     That woman l=
ittle recks of heat or cold,=20

their own dead-weight would have speedily enough borne downwards to oblivio=
n. His _Roman=20

Comique_ (1651), a short and lively narrative of the adventures of a troupe=
 of comedians strolling=20

in the provinces, contrasted with the exaltations, the heroisms, the delica=
te distresses of the ideal=20

romance. The _Roman Bourgeois_ (1666) of ANTOINE FURETIERE is a belated exa=
mple of the=20

group to which _Francion_ belongs. The great event of its author's life was=
 his exclusion from the=20



Academy, of which he was a member, on the ground that he had appropriated f=
or the advantage=20

of his Dictionary the results of his fellow-members' researches for the Dic=
tionary, then in progress,=20

of the learned company. His _Roman_ is a remarkable study of certain types =
of middle-class=20

Parisian life, often animated, exact, effective in its satire; but the anal=
ysis of a petty and=20

commonplace world needs some relief of beauty or generosity to make its tri=
viality acceptable, and=20

such relief Furetiere will not afford.  Somewhat apart from this group of s=
atiric tales, yet with a=20

certain kinship to them, lie the more fantastic satires of that fiery swash=
buckler--"demon des=20

braves"--CYRANO DE BERGERAC (1619-55), _Histoire Comique des Etats et Empir=
es de la=20

Lune_, and _Histoire Comique des Etats et Empires du Soleil_. Cyrano's tast=
e, caught by the=20

mannerisms of Italy and extravagances of Spain, was execrable. To his viole=
nces of temper he=20

added a reputation for irreligion. His comedy _Le Pedant Joue_ has the hono=
ur of having=20

furnished Moliere with the most laughable scene of the _Fourberies de Scapi=
n_. The voyages to=20

the moon and the sun, in which the inhabitants, their manners, governments,=
 and ideas, are=20

presented, mingle audacities and caprices of invention with a portion of sa=
tiric truth; they lived in=20

the memories of the creator of Gulliver and the creator of Micromegas.     =
CHAPTER II THE=20

FRENCH ACADEMY--PHILOSOPHY (DESCARTES)--RELIGION (PASCAL)   The French=20

Academy, an organised aristocracy of letters, expressed the growing sense t=
hat anarchy in=20

literature must end, and that discipline and law must be recognised in thin=
gs of the mind. It is one=20

of the glories of RICHELIEU that he perceived that literature has a public =
function, and may indeed=20

be regarded as an affair of the State. His own writings, or those composed =
under his direction--

memoirs; letters; the _Succincte Narration_, which sets forth his policy; t=
he _Testament_, which=20

embodies his counsel in statecraft--belong less to literature than to Frenc=
h history. But he=20

honoured the literary art; he enjoyed the drama; he devised plots for plays=
, and found docile=20

poets--his Society of five--to carry out his designs.  In 1629 Valentin Con=
rart, secretary to the King,=20

and one of the frequenters of the Hotel de Rambouillet, was accustomed to r=
eceive weekly a=20

group of distinguished men of letters and literary amateurs, who read their=
 manuscripts aloud,=20

discussed the merits of new works, and considered questions of criticism, g=
rammar, and=20

language. Tidings of these reunions having reached Richelieu, he proposed t=
hat the society=20

should receive an official status. By the influence of Chapelain the object=
ions of certain members=20

were overcome. The _Academie Francaise_ held its first sitting on March 13,=
 1634; three years=20

later the letters patent were registered; the number of members was fixed a=
t forty; when vacancies=20

occurred, new members were co-opted for life. Its history to the year 1652 =
was published in the=20

following year by Pellisson, and obtained him admission to a chair. The fun=
ctions of the learned=20

company were to ascertain, as far as possible, the French language,=20


_
_Courtier._ But see, Vasantasena! Another cloud,      Sped by the fickle fu=
ry of the air--       A flood=20

of arrows in his rushing streams,     His drum, the roaring thunder's might=
y blare,       His banner,=20

living lightning's awful gleams--      Rages within the sky, and shows him =
bold       'Mid beams that=20

to the moon allegiance owe,     Like a hero-king within the hostile hold   =
    Of his unwarlike foe.=20

17  P. 142.9]  _Vasantasena._ True, true. And more than this:      As dark =
as elephants, these=20

clouds alone       Fall like a cruel dart--     With streaks of lightning a=
nd with white birds strewn--=20

To wound my wretched heart.     But, oh, why should the heron, bird of doom=
,       With that=20

perfidious sound[66]     Of "Rain! Rain! Rain!"--grim summons to the tomb  =
   For her who spends=20

her lonely hours in tribunal if members consented to submit their works to =
its examination. There=20

were hopes that authoritative treatises on rhetoric and poetics might be is=
sued with its sanction;=20

but these hopes were not fulfilled. A dictionary, of which Chapelain presen=
ted the plan in 1638,=20

was, however, undertaken; progressing by slow degrees, the first edition ap=
peared in 1694. Its aim=20

was not to record every word of which an example could be found, but to sel=
ect those approved by=20

the usage of cultivated society and of the best contemporary or recent auth=
ors. Thus it tended to=20

establish for literary use an aristocracy of words; and while literary expr=
ession gained in dignity=20

and intellectual precision, gained as an instrument of reason and analysis,=
 such regulation created=20

a danger that it might lose in elements that have affinities with the popul=
ar mind--vivacity,=20


_
Strew salt upon the wound?                                 18  _Courtier._ =
Very true, Vasantasena. And yet=20

again:      It seems as if the sky would take the guise       Of some fierc=
e elephant to service bred;=20

The lightning like a waving streamer flies,       And white cranes serve to=
 deck his mighty head.=20

19  _Vasantasena._ But look, sir, look!      variety. At its commencement n=
o one was more deeply=20

interested in the dictionary than Vaugelas (1585-1650), a gentleman of Savo=
ie, whose concern for=20

the purity of the language, as determined by the best usage, led him to res=
ist innovations and the=20

invasion of foreign phraseology. His _Remarques sur la Langue Francaise_ se=
rved as a guide to=20

his fellow-members of the=20
