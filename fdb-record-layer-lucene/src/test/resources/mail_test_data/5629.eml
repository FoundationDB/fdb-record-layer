FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)  Viola B. Muse, Field 

Worker Palatka, Florida  RANDALL LEE   Randall Lee of 500 Branson Street, Palatka, Florida, 

was born at Camden, South Carolina about seventy-seven years ago, maybe longer.  He was the 

son of Robert and Delhia Lee, who during slavery were Robert and Delhia Miller, taking the name 

of their master, as was the custom.  His master was Doctor Miller and his mistress was Mrs. 

Camilla Miller. He does not know his master's given name as no other name was ever heard 

around the plantation except Doctor Miller.  Randall was a small boy when the war between the 

states broke out, but judging from what he remembers he must have been a boy around six or 

seven years of age.  During the few years he spent in slavery, Randall had many experiences 

which made such deep impressions upon his brain that the memory of them still remains clear. 

The one thing that causes one to believe that he must have been around seven years of age is the 

statement that he was not old enough to have tasks of any importance placed upon him, yet he 

was trusted along with another boy about his own age, to carry butter from the plantation dairy two 

miles to the 'big house.' No one would trust a child younger than six years of age to handle butter 

for fear of it being dropped into the dirt. He must have at least reached the age when he was paint. 

Certainly this age is not indifferent to beauty. The art movement is in every house; everywhere you 

see some proof of a desire to possess not mere ornament but something really rare and beautiful. 

The influence transmutes children's picture books and toys. I turned up the other day a child's 

picture book of the days of my childhood; probably it had been thought wonderfully good in its 

time; and what a thing it was. Some day our doubts may be cleared up; our beliefs may be settled; 



faith may come again; life may recover its singleness and certainty of aim; poetry may gush forth 

once more as fresh as Homer, and the art of the future may appear. What is most difficult to 

conceive, perhaps, is the sculpture of the future; because it is hardly possible that the moderns 

should ever have such facilities as the ancients had for studying the human form. In presence of 

the overwhelming magnificence of the sculpture in the museums of Rome and Naples, one 

wonders how Canova and Co. can have looked with any complacency on their own productions. 

There seems reason by the way to think that these artists worked not each by himself, but in 

schools and brotherhoods with mutual aid and sympathy; and this is an advantage equally within 

the reach of modern art. Meantime, though the Art of the future delays to come, modern life is not 

all hideous. There are many things, no doubt, such as the Black Country and the suburbs of our 

cities, on which the eye cannot rest with pleasure. But Paris is not hideous. There may be in the 

long lines of buildings too much of the autocratic monotony of the Empire, but the city, as a whole, 

is the perfect image of a brilliant civilization. From London beauty is almost banished by smoke 

and fog, which deny to the poor architect ornament, colour, light and shadow, leaving him nothing 

but outline. No doubt besides the smoke and fog there is a fatality. There is a fatality which darkly 

impels us to place on our finest site, and one of the finest in Europe, the niggard facade and 

inverted teacup dome of the National Gallery; to temper the grandeurs of Westminster by the 

introduction of the Aquarium, with Mr. Hankey's Tower of Babel in the near distance; to guard 

against any too-imposing effect which the outline of the Houses of Parliament might have by 

covering them with minute ornament, sure to be blackened and corroded into one vast blotch by 

smoke; to collect the art wonders of Pigtail Place; to make the lions in Trafalgar Square lie like 

cats on a hearth-rug, instead of supporting themselves on a slope by muscular action, like the 

lions at Genoa; to perch a colossal equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington, arrayed in his 

waterproof cape, and mounted on a low-shouldered hack instead of a charger, on the top of an 

arch, by way of perpetual atonement to France for Waterloo; and now to think of planting an 

obelisk of the Pharaohs on a cab-stand. An obelisk of the Pharaohs in ancient Rome was an 

august captive, symbolizing the university of the Roman Empire, but an obelisk of the Pharaohs in 

London symbolizes little more than did the Druidical ring of stones which an English squire of my 

acquaintance purchased in one of the Channel Islands and set up in his English park. As to 

London we must console ourselves with the thought that if life outside is less poetic than it was in 

the days of old, inwardly its poetry is much deeper. If the house is less beautiful the home is more 

so. Even a house in what Tennyson

with a package and was expected to deliver the package intact. He must have understood the 

necessity of not playing on the way. He stated that he knew not to stop on the two-mile journey 

and not to let the butter get dirty.  Randall had the pleasure of catching the pig for his father for 

Doctor Miller gave each of his best calls the long unlovely street is not utterly unlovely when within 

it dwell cultivated intellect, depth of character and tenderness of affection. However the beauty of 

English life is in the country and there it may challenge that of Italian palaces. America is 

supposed to be given over to ugliness. There are a good many ugly

family. He was allowed to build a pen for it and raise and fatten it for killing. When killing time 

came he was given time to butcher it and grind all the sausage he could make to feed his family. 

By that method it helped to solve the feeding problem and also satisfied the slaves.  It was more 

like so many families living around a big house with a boss looking over them, for they were 

allowed a privilege that very the ugliest are the most pretentious. As it is in society so it is in 

architecture. America is best when she is content to be herself. An American city with its spacious 

streets all planted with avenues of trees with its blocks of buildings far from unimpeachable 

probably in detail yet stately in the mass with its wide spreading suburbs where each artizan has 

his neat looking house in his own plot of ground and

masters gave their slaves.  On the Miller plantation there was a cotton gin. Doctor Miller owned the 

gin and it was operated by his slaves. He grew the cotton, picked it, ginned it and wove it right 

there. He also had a baler and made the bagging to bale it with. He only had to buy the iron bands 

that held the bales intact.  Doctor Miller was a rich man and had a far reaching sight into how to 

work slaves to the best advantage. He was kind to them and knew that the best way to get the 

best out of men was to keep them well and happy. His arrangement was very much the general 

way in that he allowed the young men and women to work in the fields and the old women and a 

few old men to work around the house, in the gin and at far from faultless yet varying the outline 

might not please a painters eye but it fills your mind with a sense of well rewarded industry of 

comfort and even opulence shared by the toiling man of a prosperous, law-loving, cheerful, and 

pious life. I cannot help fancying that Turner, whose genius got to the soul of everything, would 

have made something of even in American city. The cities of the Middle Ages were picturesquely 

huddled within walls for protection from the violence of the feudal era, the cities of the New World 

spread wide in the security of an age of law and a continent of peace. At Cleveland in Ohio there 

is a great street called Euclid Avenue, lined with villas each standing in its own grounds and

mostly did the spinning of thread and weaving of cloth although in some instances Doctor Miller 

found a man who was better adapted to weaving than any of his women slaves.  Everyone kept 

his plantation under fence and men who were old but strong and who had some knowledge of 

carpentry were sent out to keep the fence in repair and often to build new ones. The fences by a 

light iron fencing instead of the high brick wall with which the Briton shuts out his detested kind. 

The villas are not vast or suggestive of over-grown plutocracy, they are suggestive of moderate 

wealth, pleasant summers, cheerful winters and domestic happiness. I hardly think you would call 

Euclid Avenue revolting. I say it with the diffidence of conscious
