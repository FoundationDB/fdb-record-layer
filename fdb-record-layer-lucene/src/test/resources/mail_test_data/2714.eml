had to talk to somebody, so I talked to her; told her where I had landed."  "And she advised you to 

throw up your hands?"  "You don't know Patricia. She put a heart into my body and blood into my 

veins. What she said to me that night is what has kept me going, dad--what has made me drive 

this fight for a clean election on the part of the railroad company home to the hilt. I have driven it 

home. There will be no crooked deals on the part of the railroad company this time."  The senator 

looked up quickly. "That's a mighty good stout thing to say," he remarked, adding: "I reckon you're 

not saying it without having the right and proper club hid out somewhere where you can lay hands 

on it?"  Blount tapped his coat-pocket. "I have the club right here--documentary evidence that will 

rip this State wide open and send a lot of people to the penitentiary. I've told Gantry to pass the 

word: a clean sheet, or I go over to the other side and tell what I know. And that brings me to the 

thing that I've got to say to you, dad--the thing that made me hope I'd find you here to-night. After 

I'd got my battle-word from Patricia, I had a jolt that was worse than the other. When I pulled the 

gun on Gantry, he told me that I couldn't shoot without killing you; that you were just as deeply 

involved as any one of the railroad officials. Is that the truth?"  The senator had pushed his chair 

back and was burying his hands in his pockets.  "You've come to try to haul me out of the fire?" he 

inquired, ignoring the direct question.  "I've come to ask you, first, if it is possible for you to stand 

from under. Can you?"  "Oh, yes; I reckon I could dodge, if I had to."  "Then do it, and do it quickly, 

dad! As there is a God above us, I'm going to push this thing through to the bitter end. To-morrow 

morning I shall give Gantry his time limit. If the time goes by, leaving the house-cleaning still 

undone, I shall keep my promise to the letter. You know, and I know, what will happen after that." 

"Yes; I reckon I know," was the half-absent reply.  Blount threw his napkin aside and glanced at 

his watch.  "I've got to go back to the office and work a while," he said. And then: "I feel better for 

having had this talk with you, dad. I'm sorry you are finding it necessary to fight me, and a 

thousand times sorrier that I've got to fight you. But I can't give ground now, and still be a man and 

your son. Think it over and dodge. It'll break my heart a second time if I have to pull the other 

fellow's house down and bury you in the wreck."  For some little time after his son had left the 

table and the private dining-room, the Honorable Senator Sage-Brush sat absently toying with his 

dessert-spoon. When he rose to go out, the battle light in the gray eyes was the signal which not 

even his most faithful henchmen could always interpret; but it was a signal which all of them knew 

by sight, and one which many of them feared.     XVI  THE SAFE-BLOWER   About the time that 

Evan Blount was finishing the fourth week of the campaign of education, the senator's wife began 

to detect signs of country weariness in the eyes of Miss Patricia Anners.  "When you are tired of 

the out-door bignesses, you have only to say the word," she told the professor's daughter one 

morning after they had driven to Lost River Canyon and back in the small car. "As you have 

doubtless discovered, the senator and I live either here or at the capital indifferently during the 

season, and we shall be only too glad to entertain you in town whenever near the shore is a 

mosque; and there are several others. We will walk along the shore to the little steamer."  The 

travellers were occasionally assailed by a mob of donkey-boys; but no notice of them was taken, 

and they reached the Hotel Suez near the landing-place. The guide pointed out an island near the 

shore on which was located the English Cemetery. There are at the west of the town an English 

and a French hospital. The party embarked, and the guide went to the pilot house. In a few 

minutes more they were on board of the ship.  It was not yet dinner time, and the arrangements for 



the trip to the Springs of Moses were made. In the evening, attended by the pilot, Felix and 

Captain Scott went over to the town again, instructed to visit the hotels and ascertain, if they could, 

whether the veiled Arab was lodging at any of them. While they were absent the company in the 

cabin reviewed the pilgrimage of the Israelites, and the events which led to the receiving of the 

Law by Moses on Mount Sinai, in which the commander conducted the inquiry, and read many 

passages from Exodus and Numbers.  About ten o'clock in the evening Captain Scott and Felix 

reported the result of their mission. The pilot was well acquainted with the keeper of the Hotel 

Suez, and the information desired had been readily obtained. A person answering to the 

description, though he wore no veil, had come to the hotel. He was suffering much pain from a 

lame shoulder, and had gone to the French hospital for treatment. They had inquired about 

"Monsieur Abdelkhalik," as he had given his name at the hotel, and were informed that he was 

"comfortable," which was all the attendants would say.  The commander sent for Dr. Hawkes, and 

told him about his former patient. Mazagan had been very imprudent and even reckless, and his 

present condition was simply what might have been expected, was the doctor's reply. He might be 

out again in a week, not sooner, and might not for a month. The captain was satisfied there would 

be no further movement on the part of the pirate while he remained at Suez.  After breakfast the 

party embarked again in the Maud. Four sailors in charge of Knott were sent on board, and the 

first cutter of the ship was taken in tow, to be used in making the landing. The men remained on 

the forecastle, and the pilot and Knott were already good friends. But the "Big Four" were 

requested to stay with the party at the stern. The little steamer went out of the basin and down the 

canal to the bay. As soon as she came into the open water, the commander took the floor.  "On 

your right is Africa; on your left is Asia. You have probably had enough of Egypt, and now we will 

confine our attention to Asia; and we have pleasant Asiatic breezes from the east this morning. 

The country on your left is Arabia, and nearest to you is the Peninsula of Sinai. It has the Gulf of 

Suez on its west shore, and the Gulf of Akaba on its east coast. I spoke to you of Brugsch's theory 

that the Israelites journeyed east, with some diversions by divine command, till they came to the 

Sarbonic Lake, in which he said that Pharaoh and his host perished.  "Now you are on that portion 

of the Red Sea where it is more generally believed that the fugitives crossed and Pharaoh's army 

was ingulfed. The king heard that the wanderers had not passed the fortifications on the isthmus, 

and he believed they were 'entangled in the land.' Then he began the pursuit, with 'the six hundred 

chosen chariots.' The Israelites fled before him, and 


_
To similar proposals made earlier Miss Anners had always returned prompt refusals. But for a 

week or more some impulse which she had not taken the trouble to analyze seemed to be drawing 

her toward the city. The mesa roads were just as inviting, and the free pleasures of motoring, in a 

country where speed restrictions were conspicuous only by their absence, were just as keen. But 

now Patricia confessed to a restless longing for the sight of city streets and the brabble of city 

noises.  "Only you mustn't consider us, or me, so much as you do, Mrs. Blount," she protested. "I 

have a dreadful suspicion that we have already interfered shamefully with your autumn plans. You 

are simply too kind and too hospitable to admit it."  "You have interfered with nothing," was the 

ready assurance. "We were not going anywhere, or thinking of going anywhere. No inducement 

that was ever invented would take the senator away from his own State in a political year, and 

your coming has been a blessing. But for the good excuse to bring your father out here to the 

fossil-beds, we should have been mewed up in the Inter-Mountain Hotel from the firing of the 

opening gun to the day after election. But that isn't what I meant to say. You are tired of so much 

country; I can read the call of the city in your eyes--and they are very pretty eyes, my dear. Shall I 

telephone the senator that we are coming in this afternoon to stay a while?"  "I shall be delighted," 

said Patricia, and the eyes, which were not only pretty but exceedingly apt to tell tales, confirmed 

the eager assent. Then she added: "Now that daddy has his box of books from the university 

library, I doubt if he will know that we are gone."  On their first day in the capital Evan was away, 

but he returned the following morning and Mrs. Blount promptly captured him for a theatre box-

party which she was inviting for the same evening. In Mrs. Honoria's orderly scheme Blount was 

predestined to go, though he was allowed to believe that his acceptance was of free will. 

Notwithstanding the lapse of time and Mrs. Honoria's uniform kindness, he was still unreasonably 

prejudiced, and with the prejudice he was now admitting a feeling akin to jealousy. It was evident 

that Patricia's admiration for his father described in the Scriptures.  "Setting aside the miracle of 

the parted waves, there are still doubting critics who affirm that they crossed the gulf at low tide on 

these sands where the pier is built, as was frequently done by caravans before the canal was built. 

The Egyptians continued the pursuit, reaching the gulf before the tide turned, and attempted to 

follow them; but a strong south-west gale sprang up, driving the waters furiously before it, to the 

utter destruction of the whole army and its chariots.  "But I accept the narrative as it is written 

(Exodus xiv.); and I should like to argue the case with any one who takes the view of Brugsch, or 

other critics who try to explain the miracle on natural grounds."  The pilot anchored the Maud as 

near the shore as the depth would permit, and the party were taken ashore by the sailors in the 

cutter. The springs are about a mile from the landing, and the walk through the sand of the desert 

was trying to the ladies and to the fat gentlemen. The pilot acted as guide.  "Ain Musa, as it is 

called, is an oasis a mile and a quarter in circumference. As you see, it is covered with date-

palms, tamarisks, and acacias, and everything grows luxuriantly," the Frenchman began. "The 

Arabs who live in the mud hovels you see, raise fine vegetables here; and, like all Arabs, they will 

expect a bakshish."  The springs were found to consist of several pools of rather muddy water. 

The largest of them, shut in by an old wall, is said to be the one called forth by the rod of Moses 

from the rock; but the tradition is accommodating, and, if you choose, it is the one whose bitter 

waters were sweetened by the casting in of the tree.  The party had brought a luncheon with them, 

and it was served by Sparks at the usual hour. They had a delightful time under the trees, and 



listened to an explanation by the professor of the natural formation of the springs. In the middle of 

the afternoon they embarked, and returned to the ship in the canal basin.     CHAPTER XXVI  THE 

VARIOUS ROUTES TO MOUNT SINAI   The next day was Sunday; and, in accordance with the 

custom from the beginning of the voyage, no unnecessary work was required to be done by any 

person, and the business of sight-seeing was discontinued. But all were 


_
Mrs. Honoria, he was irrational enough to want Patricia to dislike her, too.  The box-party proved to 

be a more formal affair than he had anticipated, since it was large enough to fill two of the open 

dress-circle boxes. Gantry was included, and so were the Weatherfords--father, mother, 

daughters, and son. These, with the Gordons and a Denver man whose name of Critchett Blount 

was not quite sure that he caught in the introduction, filled Mrs. Honoria's list. In the seating Blount 

meant to make sure of having a measurably undisturbed evening with Patricia. But fate, or a 

designing hostess, intervened, and he found himself cornered between Mrs. Weatherford and her 

younger daughter, with the square-shouldered "Paramounter" candidate for governor 

strengthening the barrier which separated him from Miss Anners.  Blount had met Gordon socially 

a number of times, and in the intervals allowed him by Mrs. Weatherford he was silently studying 

the face of the big man who, singularly enough, as the student thought, was thus identifying 

himself publicly as a friend of the boss. True, Blount did not forget his father's warm 

commendation of Gordon in that earliest political talk on the were conducted by the commander on 

the deck or in the cabin, which were usually attended by all. Most of them went to church on shore 

when it was convenient; but going to see the edifice or the pictures they did not regard as a 

devotional exercise.  It was a warm and pleasant day for the seventeenth of January, in latitude 30 

deg., about the same as New Orleans or the northern part of Florida; and the service was held in 

Conference Hall, as the carpeted section of the promenade deck had come to be called. The 

captain began the exercises by reading selections from Exodus xv.:--  "Then sang Moses and the 

children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath 

triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength 

and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my 

father's God, and I will exalt him.... Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his 

chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into 

the bottom as a stone."  Several "Gospel Hymns" were sung, and the sermon read by the 


_
lines had been drawn and the gage of battle thrown down by the allied forces of the machine and 

the railroad. Now, with the battle drawing to its close, Blount thought that nothing could be more 

certain than the fact that his father and his father's was as nearly fitted to the surroundings as any 

he could find in his collection. After the service Mrs. Blossom struck up "Turn back Pharaoh's 

Army, Hallelu!" in which those who knew this Jubilee Singers' melody joined. The conversation 

that followed 


_
with the railroad oligarchy to slaughter Gordon at the polls.  Putting aside the wonder that Gordon 

should be accepting Mrs. Honoria's hospitality, Blount fell to contrasting the strong, large-featured 

face of the Mission Hills ranchman with that of Reynolds, the opposition candidate. Though he was 

himself on the corporation campaigning staff, Blount could not help admitting that the comparison 

was not favorable to Reynolds. His first impression of the round-faced, portly gentleman who was 

standing firmly upon what he was pleased to call a direction of the Peninsula of Sinai, which they 

could see from the deck.  "Are we going to Mount Sinai, Captain Ringgold?" asked Mrs. Belgrave, 

in a rather decided tone for her, as though she intended to have the question settled this time.  A 

great deal had been said by the ladies from Von Blonk Park in relation to this proposed excursion; 

but for some reason of his own the commander had not yet given a definite answer. They all 

attended the same church at home, and the captain and the two ladies were members of it. While 

the others of the party 


_
and order--a man who was Gordon's opposite in every feature and characteristic--had been 

unfavorable. He had been saying to himself, since, that Reynolds's face, in spite of its heavy jaw 

and prominent eyes, was the face of a time-server.  Another point of difference between the two 

men counted for much. Reynolds wanted the office, and was spending money liberally to get it, 

while Gordon had accepted the nomination reluctantly. Throughout the hot campaign he had 

refused to stump the State for himself or his party, and was said to be holding steadfastly they 

were not so enthusiastic as the two ladies mentioned.  "Are we going to Mount Sinai?" replied the 

commander, repeating the question of the owner's mother, "No!"  It was a decided "no" this time, 

and the jaws of the two Von Blonk Parkites suddenly dropped. Everybody in the company knew 

that the commander would do anything, even to swimming across the gulf where the children of 

Israel had walked over, to oblige her, and they were very much surprised at the emphatic 

negative.  "I shall not finally decide this interesting question without giving my
