I lived, fettered me,=20

suppressed or reduced the chorus--in a word, the drama in his hands ceased =
to be oratorical or=20

lyrical, and became at length dramatic. The advance was great; and it was a=
chieved by a hack=20

playwright scrambling for his crusts of bread.  [Footnote 1: Or thirty-four=
 pieces, if _Theagene et=20

Cariclee_ be reckoned as only one.]  But to dramatic life and movement it w=
as necessary that=20

order, discipline, regulation should be added. The rules of the unities wer=
e not observed by Hardy-

-were perhaps unknown to him. But they were known to others. Jean de Schela=
ndre (the=20

pseudonym formed from the letters of his name being Daniel d'Ancheres), in =
his vast drama in two=20

parts, _Tyr et Sidon_, claimed all the freedom of the mysteries in varying =
the scene, in mingling=20

heroic matter with buffoonery. In the edition of 1628 a preface appears by =
Francois Ogier, a=20

learned churchman, maintaining that the modern stage, in accordance with al=
tered circumstances,=20

should maintain its rights to complete imaginative liberty against the auth=
ority of the Greeks, who=20

presented their works before different spectators under different condition=
s. Ogier's protest was=20

without effect. Almost immediately after its appearance the _Sophonisbe_ of=
 Jean de Mairet was=20

given, and the classical tragedy of France was inaugurated on a popular sta=
ge. In the preface to=20

his pastoral tragi-comedy _Sylvanire_, Mairet in 1631 formulated the doctri=
ne of the unities. The=20



adhesion of Richelieu and the advocacy of Chapelain insured their triumph. =
The "rules" came to=20

be regarded as the laws of a literary species.  The influence of the Spanis=
h drama, seen in the=20

writings of Rotrou and others, might be supposed to make for freedom. It en=
couraged romantic=20

inventions and ambitious extravagances of style. Much that is rude and unfo=
rmed is united with a=20

curiosity for points and laboured ingenuity in the dramatic work of Scudery=
, Du Ryer, Tristan=20

l'Hermite. A greater dramatist than these showed how Spanish romance could =
coalesce with=20

French tragedy in a drama which marks an epoch--the _Cid_; and the _Cid_, c=
alling forth the=20

judgment of the Academy, served to establish the supremacy of the so-called=
 rules of Aristotle.=20

PIERRE CORNEILLE, son of a legal official, was born at Rouen in 1606. His h=
igh promise as a=20

pupil of the Jesuits was not confirmed when he attempted to practise at the=
 bar; he was retiring,=20

and spoke with difficulty. At twenty-three his first dramatic piece, _Melit=
e_, a comedy, suggested, it=20

is told, by an adventure of his youth, was given with applause in Paris; it=
 glitters with points, and is=20

of a complicated intrigue, but to contemporaries the plot appeared less ent=
angled=20

the herdsman,=20

slipping his tether,     Breaks jail and the heart of the king together?   =

the east gate of the main street, you at the west, you at the south, you at=
 the north. I'll climb up the=20

broken wall here with Chandanaka and take a look. Come on, Chandanaka, come=

ou meet             The=20

tragi-comedy, _Clitandre_, which followed (1632), was a romantic drama, cro=
wded with=20

extravagant incidents, after the manner of Hardy. In _La Veuve_ he returned=
 to the style of=20

_Melite_, but with less artificial brilliance and more real vivacity; it wa=
s published with laudatory=20

verses prefixed, in one of which Scudery bids the stars retire for the sun =
has risen. The scene is=20

laid in Paris, and some presentation of contemporary manners is made in _La=
 Galerie du Palais_=20

and _La Place Royale_. It was something to replace the nurse of elder comed=
y by the soubrette.=20

The attention of Richelieu was attracted to the new dramatic author; he was=
 numbered among the=20

five _garcons poetes_ who worked upon the dramatic plans of the Cardinal; b=
ut he displeased his=20

patron by his imaginative independence. Providing himself with a convenient=
 excuse, Corneille=20
