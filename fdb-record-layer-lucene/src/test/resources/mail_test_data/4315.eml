philodendron monstera  The village is a small thing, but it looms large in =

es brightened with anticipation; there was _
of man. Manaton itself, with its own tor rising behind the church, is a bea=
utiful little village,=20

rendered more lovely by the River Bovey.  It is the fall of the Becka brook=
 into the Bovey that=20

provides the popular Becky Falls; but in summer, as Mr. Baring-Gould says, =
this is rather a water=20

trickle than a waterfall; in autumn and winter, when fewer visitors see it,=
 the stream is a turbulent=20

torrent. Not far distant is the beautiful Lustleigh Cleave, which though no=
t on the moor is=20

thoroughly moorland in its character and its antiquities. So hugely piled a=
re the boulders at its foot=20

that the river is generally quite out of sight, to be heard but not seen.  =
But to get to a typical=20

moorland parish we must not linger at Lustleigh; we must go out to Widecomb=
e, and by whatever=20

road we reach it we shall understand the sad fate of Tom Pearce's old mare.=
 Widecombe is in a=20

hollow surrounded by heights and tors (it must be understood that the word =
tor is only used where=20

the granite actually protrudes from the soil). Bel, Rippon, and Hey Tors ar=
e on one side, Hamildon=20

Down on the other. The valley, which is only low in comparison with the sur=
rounding hills, was=20

much worked in days out of date by the tin-streamers, and there is a plenti=
ful growth of pines and=20

sycamores above the traces they left.     And aye since whene'er we meet, s=
ing, for the sound is=20

sweet,     "I was a-sleep but ye've wak-en'd me.'  [Illustration: Music fra=
gment]  So clear and=20

penetrating and careless and joyous was this singing!--her heart was stirre=
d with pride as she=20

listened; this was not the voice of a man who would trouble himself with an=
y whipper-snapper=20

criticism;--nay, she began to wonder that she had wasted so much indignatio=
n on so trivial a thing.=20

Then there was a sudden silence, except for his footfall; and presently the=
 dark figure appeared=20

out there on the white road--his shadow a sharp black in front of him, the =
little terrier trotting=20

behind him--and in a minute or so the long swinging stride had carried him =
past their ambush on=20

his homeward way to the cottage.  'What a splendid voice that fellow has go=
t!' her father said, as=20

they also now went out on to the white highway, and took the opposite direc=
tion.  'He seems to be=20

very well contented with himself,' she said, rather absently.              =

was about to get into the coble--her father having started a few minutes be=
fore.  'I hear you have=20
