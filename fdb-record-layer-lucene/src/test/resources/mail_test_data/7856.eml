_Op. cit._, V. vii.    128 _The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia_, under "Gnostici=
sm."    129 In the=20

Ferouers and Devs of Jacobi (Letters F. and D.) the word       "ferouer" is=
 explained in the following=20

manner: The Ferouer is a       part of the creature (whether man or animal)=
 of which it is the type=20

and which it survives. It is the Nous of the Greeks, therefore       divine=
 and immortal, and thus can=20

hardly be the Devil or the satanic       copy De Mirville would represent i=
t (see _Memoires de=20

l'Academie des       Inscriptions_, Vol. XXXVII. p. 623, and chap. xxxix. p=
. 749).       Foucher=20

contradicts him entirely. The Ferouer was never the       "principle of sen=
sations," but always=20

referred to the most divine       and pure portion of Man's Ego--the spirit=
ual principle. Anquetil says=20

that the Ferouer is the purest portion of man's soul. The Persian       Dev=
 is the antithesis of the=20

Ferouer, for the Dev has been       transformed by Zoroaster into the Geniu=
s of Evil (whence the=20

Christian Devil), but even the Dev is only finite; for having become       =
possessed of the soul of=20

man by _usurpation_, it will have to leave       it at the great day of Ret=
ribution. The Dev obsesses=20

the soul of the       defunct for three days, during which the soul wanders=
 about the spot       at=20

which it was forcibly separated from its body; the Ferouer       ascends to=
 the region of eternal=20



Light. It was an unfortunate idea       that made the noble Marquis de Mirv=
ille imagine the Ferouer=20

to be a       "satanic copy" of a _divine_ original. By calling all the God=
s of       the Pagans--Apollo,=20

Osiris, Brahma, Ormazd, Bel, etc., the "Ferouers       of Christ and of the=
 chief Angels," he merely=20

exhibits the God and       the Angels he would honour as inferior to the Pa=
gan Gods, as man is=20

inferior to his Soul and Spirit; since the Ferouer is the immortal       pa=
rt of the mortal being of=20

which it is the type and which it       survives. Perchance the poor author=
 is unconsciously=20

prophetic; and       Apollo, Brahma, Ormazd, Osiris, etc., are destined to =
survive and       replace--

as eternal cosmic verities--the evanescent fictions about the       God, Ch=
rist and Angels of the=20

Latin Church!    130 See George Smith's _Babylon_ and other works.    131 T=
his is as fanciful as it=20

is arbitrary. Where is the Hindu or       Buddhist who would speak of his "=
Crucified"?    132 _Op.=20

between the priest-       initiators and the candidates for initiation duri=

It originated with the=20

nded with Buddha, and is=20

called the Kurukshetra rite, being enacted       as a memorial of the great=
 battle and death of the=20

-as these are all made=20

(by the Christians) to relate       to the numbers of Apostles, and Tribes,=
 and Patriarchs. The=20

translator of the Ethiopic text--Archbishop Laurence--attributes them      =
 generally to "mistakes of=20

no mistake,       in most cases.    158 _Op. cit._, lxxxviii. 99, 100.    1=
59 _Loc. cit._, 94. This=20

passage, as will be presently shown, has led       to a very curious discov=
ery.    160 In the profane=20

history of Gautama Buddha he dies at the good old age       of eighty, and =
passes off from life to=20

death peacefully with all the       serenity of a great saint, as Barthelem=
y St. Hilaire has it. Not so=20



in the Esoteric and true interpretation which reveals the real sense       =
of the profane and=20

allegorical statement that makes Gautama, the       Buddha, die very unpoet=
ically from the effects=20

of too much pork,       prepared for him by Tsonda. How one who preached th=
at the killing of=20

animals was the greatest sin, and who was a perfect vegetarian,       could=
 die from eating pork, is=20

a question that is never asked by our       Orientalists, some of whom made=
 (as now do many=20

charitable       missionaries in Ceylon) great fun at the alleged occurrenc=
e. The       simple truth is=20

that the said rice and pork are purely allegorical.       Rice stands for "=
forbidden fruit," like Eve's=20

"apple," and means       Occult knowledge with the Chinese and Tibetans; an=
d "pork" for=20

Brahmanical teachings--Vishnu having assumed in his first Avatara the      =
 form of a boar, in order=20

to raise the earth on the surface of the       waters of space. It is not, =
therefore, from "pork" that=20

Buddha died,       but for having divulged some of the Brahmanical mysterie=
s, after       which,=20

seeing the bad effects brought on some unworthy people by the       revelat=
ion, he preferred,=20

instead of availing himself of Nirvana, to       leave his earthly form, re=
maining still in the sphere of=20

the living,       in order to help humanity to progress. Hence his constant=
       reincarnations in the=20

hierarchy of the Dalai and Teshu Lamas, among       other bounties. Such is=
 the Esoteric=20

explanation. The life of       Gautama will be more fully discussed later o=
n.    161 _Op. cit._, cv. 21.=20

162 In the _Bible_ (_Genesis_, iv and v) there are three distinct Enochs   =
    (Kanoch or Chanoch)-

-the son of Cain, the son of Seth, and the son of       Jared; but they are=
 all identical, and two of=20

them are mentioned for       purposes of misleading. The years of only the =
last two are given,=20

the first one being left without further notice.    163 The eternal and inc=

Those who are aware that the term Christos was applied by the       Gnostic=
s to the Higher Ego=20

(the ancient Pagan Greek Initiates doing       the same), will readily unde=
rstand the allusion.=20

Christos was said       to be cut off from the lower Ego, Chrestos, after t=
he final and       supreme=20

Initiation, when the two became blended in one; Chrestos       being conque=

I. xiii.    169 _Op. cit._, II. viii.    170 Many are the marvels recorded =
as having taken place at his=20

death, or       we should rather say his translation; for he did not die as=
 others       do, but having=20

suddenly disappeared, while a dazzling light filled       the cavern with g=
lory, his body was again=20

seen upon its subsidence.       When this heavenly light gave place to the =
habitual semi-darkness=20

of       the gloomy cave--then only, says Ginsburg, "the disciples of Israe=
l       perceived that the=20

lamp of Israel was extinguished." His biographers       tell us that there =
were voices heard from=20

Heaven during the       preparation for his funeral, and at his interment, =
when the coffin       was=20

lowered into the deep cave prepared for it, a flame broke forth       and a=
 voice mighty and majestic=20

pronounced these words: "This is he       who caused the earth to quake, an=
d the kingdoms to=20

shake!"    171 Pockocke, maybe, was not altogether wrong in deriving the Ge=
rman       Heaven,=20

Himmel, from Himalaya; nor can it be denied that it is the       Hindu Kail=
asa (Heaven) that is the=20

father of the Greek Heaven       (Koilon), and of the Latin Coelum.    172 =
See Pockocke's _India in=20

Greece_, and his derivation of Mount       Parnassus from Parnasa, the leaf=
 and branch huts of the=20

Hindu       ascetics, half shrine and half habitation. "Part of the Par-o- =
      Pamisus (the hill of=20

Bamian),  The king, too, who had listened in the greatest agony, now breath=
ed again.  "Hang it,"=20



said Groslow, "I thought I had succeeded better. If it were not so far from=
 here to the house I=20

would return and finish him."  "And you would do well, if you are afraid of=
 his recovering; for you=20

know, if a wound in the head does not kill at once, it is cured in a week."=
  And D'Artagnan threw a=20

second glance toward Parry, on whose face such an expression of joy was man=
ifested that=20

Charles stretched out his hand to him, smiling.  Parry bent over his master=
's hand and kissed it=20

respectfully.  "I've a great desire to drink the king's health," said Athos=
.  "Let me propose it, then,"=20

said D'Artagnan.  "Do," said Aramis.  Porthos looked at D'Artagnan, quite a=
mazed at the resources=20

with which his companion's Gascon sharpness continually supplied him. D'Art=
agnan took up his=20

camp tin cup, filled it with wine and arose.  "Gentlemen," said he, "let us=
 drink to him who presides=20

at the repast. Here's to our colonel, and let him know that we are always a=
t his commands as far=20

as London and farther."  And as D'Artagnan, as he spoke, looked at Harrison=
, the colonel=20

imagined the toast was for himself. He arose and bowed to the four friends,=
 whose eyes were=20

fixed on Charles, while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest mi=
sgiving.  The king, in=20

return, looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobilit=
y and gratitude.  "Come,=20

gentlemen," cried Harrison, regardless of his illustrious captive, "let us =
be off."  "Where do we=20

sleep, colonel?"  "At Thirsk," replied Harrison.  "Parry," said the king, r=
ising too, "my horse; I desire=20

to go to Thirsk."  "Egad!" said D'Artagnan to Athos, "your king has thoroug=
hly taken me, and I am=20

quite at his service."  "If what you say is sincere," replied Athos, "he wi=
ll never reach London."=20

"How so?"  "Because before then we shall have carried him off."  "Well, thi=
s time, Athos," said=20

D'Artagnan, "upon my word, you are mad."  "Have you some plan in your head =
then?" asked=20

Aramis.  "Ay!" said Porthos, "the thing would not be impossible with a good=
 plan."  "I have none,"=20

said Athos; "but D'Artagnan will discover one."  D'Artagnan shrugged his sh=
oulders and they=20

proceeded.     61. D'Artagnan hits on a Plan.   As night closed in they arr=
ived at Thirsk. The four=20

friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to t=
he precautions taken for=20

guarding the king. They withdrew to a private house, and as they had reason=
 every moment to=20

fear for their safety, they occupied but one room and provided an exit, whi=
ch might be useful in=20

case of an attack. The lackeys were sent to their several posts, except tha=
t Grimaud lay on a truss=20

of straw across the doorway.  D'Artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the =
moment to have lost=20

his usual loquacity. Porthos, who could never see anything that was not sel=
f-evident, talked to him=20

as usual. He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significa=
ntly at one another.=20

Next morning D'Artagnan was the first to rise. He had been down to the stab=
les, already taken a=20

look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day, whilst Athos=
 and Aramis were still in=20

bed and Porthos snoring.  At eight o'clock the march was resumed in the sam=
e order as the night=20

before, except that D'Artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acqu=
aintance which he had=20

already struck up with Monsieur Groslow.  Groslow, whom D'Artagnan's praise=
s had greatly=20

pleased, welcomed him with a gracious smile.  "Really, sir," D'Artagnan sai=
d to him, "I am pleased=20

to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue. My friend, Monsieur du=
 Vallon, is of a very=20

melancholy disposition, so much so, that one can scarcely get three words o=
ut of him all day. As=20

for our two prisoners, you can imagine that they are but little in the vein=
 for conversation."  "They=20

are hot royalists," said Groslow.  "The more reason they should be sulky wi=
th us for having=20

captured the Stuart, for whom, I hope, you're preparing a pretty trial."  "=
Why," said Groslow, "that is=20

just what we are taking him to London for."  "And you never by any chance l=
ose sight of him, I=20



presume?"  "I should think not, indeed. You see he has a truly royal escort=
."  "Ay, there's no fear in=20

the daytime; but at night?"  "We redouble our precautions."  "And what meth=
od of surveillance do=20

you employ?"  "Eight men remain constantly in his room."  "The deuce, he is=
 well guarded, then.=20

But besides these eight men, you doubtless place some guard outside?"  "Oh,=
 no! Just think. What=20

would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men?"  "Two men-=
-how do you=20

mean?"  "Yes, the king and his lackey."  "Oh! then they allow the lackey to=
 remain with him?"=20

"Yes; Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented. Under pretense that =
he's a king it appears=20

he cannot dress or undress without assistance."  "Really, captain," said D'=
Artagnan, determined to=20

continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced, "the more I liste=
n to you the more=20

surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak French. Yo=
u have lived three=20

years in Paris? May I ask what you were doing there?"  "My father, who is a=
 merchant, placed me=20

with his correspondent, who in turn sent his son to join our house in Londo=
n."  "Were you pleased=20

with Paris, sir?"  "Yes, but you are much in want of a revolution like our =
own--not against your king,=20

who is a mere child, but against that lazar of an Italian, the queen's favo=
rite."  "Ah! I am quite of=20

your opinion, sir, and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only=
 a dozen officers like=20

yourself, without prejudices, vigilant and incorruptible."  "But," said the=
 officer, "I thought you were=20

in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell."  "That=
 is to say I am in the=20

king's service, and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England, I s=
olicited the=20

appointment, so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now gover=
ns the three=20

kingdoms. So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old=
 England you see=20

how we snapped up the proposition."  "Yes, I know that you charged by the s=
ide of Mordaunt."=20

"On his right and left, sir. Ah! there's another brave and excellent young =
man."  "Do you know=20

him?" asked the officer.  "Yes, very well. Monsieur du Vallon and myself ca=
me from France with=20

him."  "It appears, too, you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne."  "W=
hat would you have? I=20

was like you, and had a king in keeping."  "Aha!" said Groslow; "what king?=
"  "Our own, to be sure,=20

the little one--Louis XIV."  "And how long had you to take care of him?"  "=
Three nights; and, by my=20

troth, I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure."=
  "How do you mean?"  "I=20

mean that my friends, officers in the guards and mousquetaires, came to kee=
p me company and=20

we passed the night in feasting, drinking, dicing."  "Ah true," said the En=
glishman, with a sigh; "you=20

Frenchmen are born boon companions."  "And don't you play, too, when you ar=
e on guard?"=20

"Never," said the Englishman.  "In that case you must be horribly bored, an=
d have my sympathy."=20

"The fact is, I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror. It's tiresom=
e work to keep awake a=20

whole night."  "Yes, but with a jovial partner and dice, and guineas clinki=
ng on the cloth, the night=20

passes like a dream. You don't like playing, then?"  "On the contrary, I do=
."  "Lansquenet, for=20

instance?"  "Devoted to it. I used to play almost every night in France."  =
"And since your return to=20

England?"  "I have not handled a card or dice-box."  "I sincerely pity you,=
" said D'Artagnan, with an=20

air of profound compassion.  "Look here," said the Englishman.  "Well?"  "T=
o-morrow I am on=20

guard."  "In Stuart's room?"  "Yes; come and pass the night with me."  "Imp=
ossible!"  "Impossible!=20

why so?"  "I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night. Sometimes we don't g=
o to bed at all!"  "Well,=20

what of that?"  "Why, he would be annoyed if I did not play with him."  "Do=
es he play well?"  "I=20

have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles, laughing all the while=
 till the tears rolled=20

down."  "Bring him with you, then."  "But how about our prisoners?"  "Let y=
our servants guard=20



them."  "Yes, and give them a chance of escaping," said D'Artagnan. "Why, o=
ne of them is a rich=20

lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta, of noble family. We hav=
e arranged the ransom=20

of each of them--2,000 on arriving in France. We are reluctant to leave for=
 a single moment men=20

whom our lackeys know to be millionaires. It is true we plundered them a li=
ttle when we took them,=20

and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and =
I draw on in our nightly=20

play. Still, they may have concealed some precious stone, some valuable dia=
mond; so that we are=20

like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures.=
 We have made=20

ourselves the constant guardians of our men, and while I sleep Monsieur du =
Vallon watches."  "Ah!=20

ah!" said Groslow.  "You see, then, why I must decline your polite invitati=
on, which is especially=20

attractive to me, because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after ni=
ght with the same=20

person; the chances always balance and at the month's end nothing is gained=
 or lost."  "Ah!" said=20

Groslow, sighing; "there is something still more wearisome, and that is not=
 to play at all."  "I can=20

understand that," said D'Artagnan.  "But, come," resumed the Englishman, "a=
re these men of=20

yours dangerous?"  "In what respect?"  "Are they capable of attempting viol=
ence?"  D'Artagnan=20

burst out laughing at the idea.  "Jesus Dieu!" he cried; "one of them is tr=
embling with fever, having=20

failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours, and the other is=
 a knight of Malta, as timid=20

as a young girl; and for greater security we have taken from them even thei=
r penknives and pocket=20

scissors."  "Well, then," said Groslow, "bring them with you."  "But really=
----" said D'Artagnan.  "I=20

have eight men on guard, you know. Four of them can guard the king and the =
other four your=20

prisoners. I'll manage it somehow, you will see."  "But," said D'Artagnan, =
"now I think of it--what is=20

to prevent our beginning to-night?"  "Nothing at all," said Groslow.  "Just=
 so. Come to us this=20

evening and to-morrow we'll return your visit."  "Capital! This evening wit=
h you, to-morrow at=20

Stuart's, the next day with me."  "You see, that with a little forethought =
one can lead a merry life=20

anywhere and everywhere," said D'Artagnan.  "Yes, with Frenchmen, and Frenc=
hmen like you."=20

"And Monsieur du Vallon," added the other. "You will see what a fellow he i=
s; a man who nearly=20

killed Mazarin between two doors. They employ him because they are afraid o=
f him. Ah, there he=20

is calling me now. You'll excuse me, I know."  They exchanged bows and D'Ar=
tagnan returned to=20

his companions.  "What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog?" =
exclaimed Porthos.=20

"My dear fellow, don't speak like that of Monsieur Groslow. He's one of my =
most intimate friends."=20

"One of your friends!" cried Porthos, "this butcher of unarmed farmers!"  "=
Hush! my dear Porthos.=20

Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty, it's true, but at bottom I have d=
iscovered two good=20

qualities in him--he is conceited and stupid."  Porthos opened his eyes in =
amazement; Athos and=20

Aramis looked at one another and smiled; they knew D'Artagnan, and knew tha=
t he did nothing=20

without a purpose.  "But," continued D'Artagnan, "you shall judge of him fo=
r yourself. He is coming=20

to play with us this evening."  "Oho!" said Porthos, his eyes glistening at=
 the news. "Is he rich?"=20

"He's the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London."  "And knows la=
nsquenet?"  "Adores=20

it."  "Basset?"  "His mania."  "Biribi?"  "Revels in it."  "Good," said Por=
thos; "we shall pass an=20

agreeable evening."  "The more so, as it will be the prelude to a better." =
 "How so?"  "We invite=20

him to play to-night; he has invited us in return to-morrow. But wait. To-n=
ight we stop at Derby; and=20

if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy it. It will be =
well to prepare a light supper,=20

of which you, Athos and Aramis, are not to partake--Athos, because I told h=
im you had a fever;=20

ly very confident of an=20

This is a Secret Doctrine affirmation, and may or may not be       accepted=
. Only Abrahm, Isaac=20

and Judah resemble terribly the Hindu       Brahma Ikshvaku and Yadu.    17=
5 It is said in _The=20

Gnostics and their Remains_, by C. W. King (p.       13), with regard to th=
e names of Brahma and=20

Abram; "This figure of       the _man_, Seir Aupin, consists of 243 numbers=
, being the numerical=20

value of the letters in the name 'Abram' signifying the different       ord=
ers in the celestial=20

Hierarchies. In fact the names Abram and       Brahma are equivalent in num=
erical value." Thus to=20

one acquainted       with Esoteric Symbolism, it does not seem at all stran=
ge to find in       the=20

Loka-palas (the four cardinal and intermediate points of the       compass =
personified by eight=20

Hindu Gods) Indra's elephant, named       Abhra--(matanga) and his wife Abh=
ramu. Abhra is in a=20

way a Wisdom       Deity, since it is this elephant's head that replaced th=
at of       Ganesha=20

(Ganapati) the God of Wisdom, cut off by Shiva. Now Abhra       means "clou=
d," and it is also the=20

name of the city where Abram is       supposed to have resided--when read b=
ackwards--"Arba=20

(Kirjath) the       city of four ... Abram is Abra with an appended _m_ fin=
al, and Abra       read=20

backward is Arba" (_Key to the Hebrew Egyptian Mystery_). The       author =
might have added that=20

Abra meaning in Sanskrit "in, or of,       the clouds," the cosmo-astronomi=
cal symbol of Abram=20

becomes still       plainer. All of these ought to be read in their origina=
ls, in       Sanskrit.    176=20

Before these theories and speculations--we are willing to admit they       =
are such--are rejected,=20

the following few points ought to be       explained, (1) Why, after leavin=
g Egypt, was the=20

patriarch's name       changed by Jehovah from Abram to Abraham. (2) Why Sa=
rai becomes on=20

the same principle Sarah (_Gen._, xvii.). (3) Whence the strange       coin=
cidence of names? (4)=20

Why should Alexander Polyhistor say that       Abraham was born at Kamarina=
 or Uria, a city of=20

soothsayers, and       invented Astronomy? (5) "The Abrahamic recollections=
 go back at       least=20

188 Ragon mentions the curious fact that the first four numbers in       Ge=
rman are named after the=20

elements.        "Ein, or one, means the air, the element which, ever in mo=
tion,       penetrates=20

matter throughout, and whose continual ebb and tide is       the universal =
vehicle of life.        "Zwei,=20

two, is derived from the old German Zweig, signifying germ,       fecundity=
; it stands for earth the=20

fecund mother of all.        "Drei, three, is the _trienos_ of the Greeks, =
standing for water,=20

whence the Sea-gods, Tritons; and trident, the emblem of Neptune--the      =
 water, or sea, in=20

general being called Amphitrite (surrounding       water).        "Vier, fo=
ur, a number meaning in=20

Belgian fire.... It is in the       quaternary that the first solid figure =
is found, the universal       symbol=20

of immortality, the Pyramid, 'whose first syllable means       fire.' Lysis=
 and Timaeus of Locris=20

claimed that there was not a thing       one could name that had not the qu=
aternary for its root....=20

The       ingenious and mystical idea which led to the veneration of the   =
    ternary and the triangle=20

was applied to number four and its figure:       it was said to express a l=
iving being, 1, the vehicle of=20

the       triangle 4, vehicle of God, or man carrying in him the divine    =
   principle."        Finally, "the=20

Ancients represented the world by the number five.       Diodorus explains =
it by saying that this=20

number represents earth,       fire, water, air and ether or spiritus. Henc=
e, the origin of Pente=20

(five) and of Pan (the God) meaning in Greek all." (Compare Ragon,       _o=
p. cit._, pp. 428-430.) It=20

is left with the Hindu Occultists to       explain the relation this Sanskr=
it word Pancha (five) has to=20

the       elements, the Greek Pente having for its root the Sanskrit term. =

"That's no doubt very fine," said Porthos; "but deuce take me if I understa=
nd at all."  "Porthos, my=20

friend, you know I am descended on the father's side from the Prophets and =
on the mother's from=20

the Sybils, and that I only speak in parables and riddles. Let those who ha=
ve ears hear and those=20

who have eyes see; I can tell you nothing more at present."  "Go ahead, my =
friend," said Athos; "I=20

am sure that whatever you do is well done."  "And you, Aramis, are you of t=
hat opinion?"  "Entirely=20

so, my dear D'Artagnan."  "Very good," said D'Artagnan; "here indeed are tr=
ue believers; it is a=20

pleasure to work miracles before them; they are not like that unbelieving P=
orthos, who must see=20

and touch before he will believe."  "The fact is," said Porthos, with an ai=
r of finesse, "I am rather=20

incredulous."  D'Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder, and as t=
hey had reached the=20

station where they were to breakfast, the conversation ended there.  At fiv=
e in the evening they=20

sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon. Blaisois went with him.  In cross=
ing the principal=20

street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway=
 of a handsome house.=20

It was there a lodging was prepared for them.  At the hour agreed upon Gros=
low came.=20

D'Artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years' sta=
nding. Porthos=20

scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite o=
f the blow he had=20

administered to Parry's brother, he was not nearly so strong as himself. At=
hos and Aramis=20

suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of s=
uch coarseness and=20

brutality.  In short, Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception.  Ath=
os and Aramis kept=20

themselves to their role. At midnight they withdrew to their chamber, the d=
oor of which was left=20

open on the pretext of kindly consideration. Furthermore, D'Artagnan went w=
ith them, leaving=20

Porthos at play with Groslow.  Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow, =
and found him a more=20

agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be.  As to Groslow=
, he promised himself=20



that on the following evening he would recover from D'Artagnan what he had =
lost to Porthos, and=20

on leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment.  The next day was spent =
as usual.=20

D'Artagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel H=
arrison to his=20

friends. To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal c=
ondition; but to his=20

friends--to Athos and Aramis--was apparent a certain feverishness in his ga=
yety.  "What is he=20

contriving?" asked Aramis.  "Wait," said Athos.  Porthos said nothing, but =
he handled in his pocket=20

the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction=
 which betrayed itself in=20

his whole bearing.  Arrived at Ryston, D'Artagnan assembled his friends. Hi=
s face had lost the=20

expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day. Athos =
pinched Aramis's=20

hand.  "The moment is at hand," he said.  "Yes," returned D'Artagnan, who h=
ad overheard him,=20

"to-night, gentlemen, we rescue the king."  "D'Artagnan," said Athos, "this=
 is no joke, I trust? It=20

would quite cut me up."  "You are a very odd man, Athos," he replied, "to d=
oubt me thus. Where=20

and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life? I=
 have told you, and I=20

repeat it, that to-night we rescue Charles I. You left it to me to discover=
 the means and I have done=20

so."  Porthos looked at D'Artagnan with an expression of profound admiratio=
n. Aramis smiled as=20

one who hopes. Athos was pale, and trembled in every limb.  "Speak," said A=
thos.  "We are=20

invited," replied D'Artagnan, "to pass the night with M. Groslow. But do yo=
u know where?"  "No."=20

"In the king's room."  "The king's room?" cried Athos.  "Yes, gentlemen, in=
 the king's room.=20

Groslow is on guard there this evening, and to pass the time away he has in=
vited us to keep him=20

company."  "All four of us?" asked Athos.  "Pardieu! certainly, all four; w=
e couldn't leave our=20

prisoners, could we?"  "Ah! ah!" said Aramis.  "Tell us about it," said Ath=
os, palpitating.  "We are=20

going, then, we two with our swords, you with daggers. We four have got to =
master these eight=20

fools and their stupid captain. Monsieur Porthos, what do you say to that?"=
  "I say it is easy=20

enough," answered Porthos.  "We dress the king in Groslow's clothes. Mousqu=
eton, Grimaud and=20

Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street. We mount t=
hem and before daylight=20

are twenty leagues distant."  Athos placed his two hands on D'Artagnan's sh=
oulders, and gazed at=20

him with his calm, sad smile.  "I declare, my friend," said he, "that there=
 is not a creature under the=20

sky who equals you in prowess and in courage. Whilst we thought you indiffe=
rent to our sorrows,=20

which you couldn't share without crime, you alone among us have discovered =
what we were=20

searching for in vain. I repeat it, D'Artagnan, you are the best one among =
us; I bless and love you,=20

my dear son."  "And to think that I couldn't find that out," said Porthos, =
scratching his head; "it is so=20

simple."  "But," said Aramis, "if I understand rightly we are to kill them =
all, eh?"  Athos shuddered=20

and turned pale.  "Mordioux!" answered D'Artagnan, "I believe we must. I co=
nfess I can discover=20

no other safe and satisfactory way."  "Let us see," said Aramis, "how are w=
e to act?"  "I have=20

arranged two plans. Firstly, at a given signal, which shall be the words 'A=
t last,' you each plunge a=20

dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you. We, on our side, do th=
e same. That will be four=20

killed. We shall then be matched, four against the remaining five. If these=
 five men give=20

themselves up we gag them; if they resist, we kill them. If by chance our A=
mphitryon changes his=20

mind and receives only Porthos and myself, why, then, we must resort to her=
oic measures and=20

each give two strokes instead of one. It will take a little longer time and=
 may make a greater=20

disturbance, but you will=20

too clumsy and awkward. Besides, you will strike at the throat, Porthos; it=
