On the 11th June, having slept at the village of Abou Dome, we started at s=
unrise, and at 9 A.M.=20

we reached the bank of the river, opposite to Khartoum. We were delighted w=
ith the view, as the=20

morning sun shone upon the capital of the Soudan provinces; the grove of da=
te trees shaded the=20

numerous buildings, their dark green foliage contrasting exquisitely with t=
he many coloured=20

houses on the extreme margin of the beautiful river; long lines of vessels =
and masts gave life to=20

the scene, and we felt that once more, after twelve months of utterly wild =
life, we had arrived in=20

civilization. We had outridden our camels, therefore we rode through a shal=
low arm of the river,=20

and arrived upon an extensive sandbank that had been converted into a garde=
n of melons; from=20

this point a large ferry-boat plied regularly to the town on the south bank=
. In a few minutes we=20

found ourselves on board, with our sole remaining horse, Tetel, also the do=
nkeys that we had=20

purchased in Berber before our expedition, and our attendants. As we gained=
 the centre of the=20

river, that was about 800 yards broad, we were greeted by the snort of thre=
e of our old friends, the=20

hippopotami, who had been attracted to the neighbourhood by the garden of w=
ater-melons. We=20

landed at Khartoum, and, having climbed up the steep bank, we inquired the =
way to the British=20

Consulate.  The difference between the view of Khartoum at the distance of =
a mile, with the sun=20

shining upon the bright river Nile in the foreground, to the appearance of =
the town upon close=20

inspection, was about equal to the scenery of a theatre as regarded from th=
e boxes or from the=20

stage; even that painful exposure of an optical illusion would be trifling =
compared with the=20

imposture of Khartoum; the sense of sight had been deceived by distance, bu=
t the sense of smell=20

was outraged by innumerable nuisances, when we set foot within the filthy a=
nd miserable town.=20

After winding through some narrow dusty lanes, hemmed in by high walls of s=
un-baked bricks, that=20

had fallen in gaps in several places, exposing gardens of prickly pears and=
 date palms, we at=20

length arrived at a large open place, that, if possible, smelt more strongl=
y than the landing spot.=20

Around this square, which was full of holes where the mud had been excavate=
d for brickmaking,=20

were the better class of houses; this was the Belgravia of Khartoum. In the=
 centre of a long mud=20

wall, ventilated by certain attempts at frameless windows, guarded by good-=
looking wife, and a=20

babby, and health to boot, without bein' exactly safe from an attack of the=
 blues now and then,=20

d'ye see?  `It ain't all gold that glitters.'  You've heard o' that proverb=
, no doubt?"  "Well, yes,"=20

replied Clazie.  "Ah.  Then there's another sayin' which mayhap you've hear=
d of too: `every man's=20

got a skeleton in the cupboard.'"  "I've heard o' that likewise," said Claz=
ie, "but it ain't true;=20

leastways, _I_ have got no skeleton in none o' my cupboards, an', wot's mor=
e, if I 'ad, I'd pitch him=20

overboard."  "But what if he was too strong for you?" suggested Ned.  "Why,=
 then--I don't know,"=20

said Clazie, shaking his head.  Before this knotty point could be settled i=
n a satisfactory manner,=20

the comrades were interrupted by the entrance of a man.  He was a thick-set=
, ill-favoured fellow,=20

with garments of a disreputable appearance, and had a slouch that induced h=
onest men to avoid=20

his company.  Nevertheless, Ned Crashington gave him a hearty "good afterno=
on," and shook=20

hands.  "My brother-in-law, Clazie," said Ned, turning and introducing him,=
 "Mr Sparks."  Clazie=20

was about to say he "was 'appy to," etcetera, but thought better of it, and=
 merely nodded as he=20

turned to the grate and shook the ashes out of his pipe.  "You'll come and =
have a cup of tea, Phil?=20

Maggie and I usually have it about this time."  Phil Sparks said he had no =
objection to tea, and left=20

the station with Ned, leaving David Clazie shaking his head with a look of =
profound wisdom.=20

"You're a bad lot, you are," growled David, after the man was gone, "a werr=
y bad lot, indeed!"=20



Having expressed his opinion to the clock, for there was no one else presen=
t, David thrust both=20

hands into his pockets, and went out to take an observation of the weather.=
  Meanwhile Ned=20

Crashington led his brother-in-law to his residence, which, like the abodes=
 of the other firemen,=20

was close at hand. Entering it he found his "skeleton" waiting for him in t=
he shape of his wife.  She=20

was anything but a skeleton in aspect, being a stout, handsome woman, with =
a fine figure, an=20

aquiline nose, and glittering black eyes.  "Oh, you've come at last," she s=
aid in a sharp, querulous=20

tone, almost before her husband had entered the room.  "Full ten minutes la=
te, and I expected you=20

sooner than usual to-night."  "I didn't know you expected me sooner, Maggie=
.  Here's Phil come to=20

have tea with us."  "Oh, Phil, how are you?" said Mrs Crashington, greeting=
 her brother with a=20


_
perceived a large archway with closed doors; above this entrance was a shie=
ld, with a device that=20

gladdened my English eyes: there was the British lion and the unicorn! Not =
such a lion as I had=20

been accustomed to meet in his native jungles, a yellow cowardly fellow,  "=
Ah, if you'd only receive=20

_me_ with a smile like that, _how_ different it might be," thought Ned; but=
 he _said_ nothing.=20

"Now, then, stoopid," cried Mrs Crashington, turning quickly round on her h=
usband, as if to=20

counteract the little touch of amiability into which=20
