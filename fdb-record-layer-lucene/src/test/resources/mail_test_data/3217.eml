 defense of friends=20

who based their arguments not on facts but on certain admitted principles. =
Believing in the=20

mechanical genius of the Negroes he hoped that in the establishment of this=
 institution they would=20

have an opportunity for development. In it he saw a benefit not only to the=
 free colored people of=20

the North, but also to the slaves. The strongest argument used by the slave=
holder in defense of=20

his precious institution was the low condition of the free people of color =
of the North. Remove this=20

excuse by elevating them and you will hasten the liberation of the slaves. =
The best refutation of=20

the proslavery argument is the "presentation of an industrious, enterprisin=
g, thrifty, and intelligent=20

free black population."[1] An element of this kind, he believed, would rise=
 under the fostering care=20

of vocational teachers.  [Footnote 1: Douglass, _The Life and Times of_, p.=
 251.]  With Douglass=20

this proposition did not descend to the plane of mere suggestion. Audiences=
 which he addressed=20

from time to time were informed as to the necessity of providing for the co=
lored people facilities of=20

practical education.[1] The columns of his paper rendered the cause noble s=
ervice. He entered=20

upon the advocacy of it with all the zeal of an educational reformer, endea=
voring to show how this=20

policy would please all concerned. Anxious fathers whose minds had been exe=
rcised by the=20

inquiry as to what to do with their sons would welcome the opportunity to h=
ave them taught trades.=20

It would be in line with the "eminently practical philanthropy of the Negro=
es' trans-Atlantic friends."=20

America would scarcely object to it as an attempt to agitate the mind on sl=
avery or to destroy the=20

Union. "It could not be tortured into a cause for hard words by the America=
n people," but the noble=20

and good of all classes would see in the effort "an excellent motive, a ben=
evolent object,=20

temperately, wisely, and practically manifested."[2] The leading free peopl=
e of color heeded this=20

message. Appealing to them through their delegates assembled in Rochester i=
n 1853, Douglass=20

secured a warm endorsement of his plan in eloquent speeches and resolutions=
 passed by the=20

convention.  [Footnote 1: _African Repository_, vol. xxix., p. 136.]  [Foot=
note 2: Douglass, _Life=20

and Times of_, p. 252.]  This great enterprise, like all others, was soon t=
o encounter opposition.=20

Mrs. Stowe was attacked as soliciting money abroad for her own private use.=
 So bitter were these=20

proslavery diatribes that Henry Ward Beecher and Frederick Douglass had som=
e difficulty in=20

convincing the world that her maligners had no grounds for this vicious acc=
usation. Furthermore,=20

on taking up the matter with Mrs. Stowe after her return to the United Stat=
es, Douglass was=20

disappointed to learn that she had abandoned thanksgiving. It is called a M=
ol=C3=A9ben; and it would be=20

a beautiful and touching ceremony, but for the baneful influence of that su=
perstition which too=20

often leads its votaries to worship and serve the creature more than the Cr=
eator. Usually, most of=20

the prayers are addressed to the guardian angel, or to the saint with whose=
 picture the votary is=20

blessed--the picture being then given to him as a kind of talisman.  The be=
nediction was to take=20

place on the 27th of July, and early in the morning Ivan entered the Church=
 of the Assumption, the=20

sacred spot where the holy anointing oil had been poured upon the head of t=
he Czar. Pope Yefim=20

had found for him a quiet niche, from whence he could witness the whole of =
the ceremony. He had=20

room to stand or kneel: in Russian churches the worshippers never sit, howe=
ver protracted the=20

services may be. From his place of waiting he heard the tumult, the shouts =
and cheering, which=20

welcomed the Czar as he approached. He knew that now he was ascending the =
=E2=80=9CRed=E2=80=9D or=20

=E2=80=9CBeautiful=E2=80=9D Staircase, by which, upon state occasions, the =
Czars were wont to enter the cathedral;=20

but he could not know that he was =E2=80=9Cfollowed by an immense crowd, wh=
o wept, and blessed him,=20



and swore to defend his empire with their lives.=E2=80=9D[17] He knew that =
now this Czar would take his=20

stand, as other Czars had done, upon the summit of the staircase, to allow =
the people beneath =E2=80=9Cto=20

see the light of his eyes;=E2=80=9D but he could not know as yet how profou=
ndly the mighty heart of that=20

people was moved, =E2=80=9Cas the trees of the wood are shaken with the win=
d.=E2=80=9D  Clear and sweet as the=20

song of angels rose the ringing treble of the boyish choristers, who welcom=
ed the Czar as he=20

entered--=E2=80=9CBlessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!=E2=80=
=9D The violet robes of the bishop and=20

the assistant priests--the flash of innumerable jewels upon mitre, pall, an=
d crozier--the faint=20

perfume of incense--the sparkling drops of holy water flung from vessels wo=
rth the ransom of a=20

king,--all these held the senses of Ivan, and wholly filled for a time his =
imaginative and impressible=20

heart.  Meanwhile, the man who was the centre of all this pomp, and whose m=
anhood for Russia=20

in that solemn hour was more than worth it all, stood reverently in his pla=
ce while the officiating=20

bishop sprinkled him with holy water, or touched his forehead, his lips, hi=
s breast with the sacred=20

picture. As the eyes of Ivan rested on that stately figure, peerless in its=
 grace and majesty, a kind=20

of awe stole over him. All the old superstitious reverence of the Russian f=
or the Czar, who is =E2=80=9CGod=20

upon earth,=E2=80=9D came upon him. It seemed almost an irreverence to rais=
e his eyes to the face of the=20

monarch; he could scarcely dare to do it.  But a =E2=80=9CGospodin Pomilvi=
=E2=80=9D of exquisite sweetness from=20

the choir drew away his thoughts for a moment, and involuntarily he glanced=
 towards the spot=20


_
He was never able to see any force in the reasons for the change of policy;=
 but believed that Mrs.=20

Stowe acted conscientiously, although her action was decidedly embarrassing=
 to him both at=20

home and abroad.[1]  [Footnote 1: _Ibid_., p. 252.]     CHAPTER XIII  EDUCA=
TION AT PUBLIC=20

EXPENSE   The persistent struggle of the colored people to have their child=
ren educated at public=20

expense shows how resolved they were to be enlightened. In the beginning Ne=
groes had no=20

aspiration to secure such assistance. Because the free public schools were =
first regarded as a=20

system all else were looking; and suddenly a strange thing happened to him.=
 As in a dream, he=20

saw--instead of the gorgeous, dimly-lighted church, the gleaming vestments,=
 the drooping=20

banners--a green bank beside a river, a group of peasants, a cold and rigid=
 form, a noble,=20

compassionate face bending over it. He heard a voice that said, in tones of=
 courageous hope, =E2=80=9CMy=20

children, this is not death. We will save him yet.=E2=80=9D For he knew tha=
t his boyar and the Czar=20

Alexander Paulovitch were the same. Only, it seemed to him that now it was =
holy Russia that was=20

lying numb and=20


_
them away from these institutions lest men might reproach them with becomin=
g a public charge.=20

Moreover, philanthropists deemed it wise to provide separate schools for Ne=
groes to bring them=20

into contact with sympathetic persons, who knew their peculiar needs. In th=
e course of time,=20

however, when the stigma of charity was removed as a result of the developm=
ent of the free=20

schools at public expense, Negroes concluded that it was not dishonorable t=
o share the benefits of=20

institutions which they were taxed to support.[1] Unable then to cope with =
systems thus maintained=20

for the education of the white youth, the directors of colored schools requ=
ested that something be=20

appropriated for the education of Negroes. Complying with these petitions b=
oards of education=20

provided for colored schools which were to be partly or wholly supported at=
 public expense. But it=20

was not long before the abolitionists saw that they had made a mistake in c=
arrying out this policy.=20

The amount appropriated to the support of the special schools was generally=
 inadequate to supply=20

them with the necessary equipment and competent teachers, and in most commu=
nities the white=20

people had begun to regard the do it. From that moment Ivan never doubted i=
t.  Besides the great=20

ceremony of which the world was talking,[18] another, known to one only, to=
ok place in the church=20

that day. Ivan drew out the piece of gold his boyar=E2=80=99s hand had give=
n him, and which, ever since,=20

had hung round his neck. He kissed it, and made a solemn vow upon it, =E2=
=80=9CFaithfully to serve my=20

Czar; to live for him all my days; and, if God will, to die for him.=E2=80=
=9D  Yet once more his eyes sought=20

the face of his sovereign, and never wandered from it until the service was=
 concluded. But little=20

could he guess what was passing in the soul of which that expressive counte=
nance was=20

sometimes the too faithful index.  Alexander=E2=80=99s own hand has sketche=
d for us in a few slight=20

touches the conflicts of that period. Not then, nor ever, so far as we know=
, did the thought of St.=20

Sergius, or of any other human mediator, interpose itself between his soul =
and the Divine=20

Presence. But for some time past he had been wrestling hard in secret with =
questions which go=20

down to the very roots of a man=E2=80=99s being. Was there a God in heaven =
whose ear could be reached=20

by that cry from human lips, =E2=80=9CGospodin Pomilvi=E2=80=9D? And, if so=
, was he the=20
