actice may vary=20

with the kind of malpractice. In the case of wilful malpractice, the elemen=
t of gross negligence=20

justifies punitive or retaliatory damages, in those States where any such d=
amages are allowed.=20

That is, damages which will not only compensate for the injuries inflicted,=
 but which will, by=20

punishing the wrong done, tend to repress similar acts in the future. The t=
endency of the courts=20

and of legal authority of the present time is, however, to limit as often a=
s possible the cases in=20

which punitive damages are allowed, upon the theory that if a grossly negli=
gent act is committed it=20

will require criminal prosecution, and that the strong arm of the State sho=
uld be invoked to punish=20

the wrong, rather than to line the pocket of the injured person.  On the ot=
her hand, in cases of=20

malpractice, damages for want of ordinary care and skill are recompensed as=
 in any other cases=20

of negligence. They may include loss of time of the patient, inability to e=
arn his living, such sum as=20

the jury thinks is reasonable to be given as a compensation for the extra p=
ain and suffering, and,=20

where the injury is permanent, such further sum as will indemnify the patie=
