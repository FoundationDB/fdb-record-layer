she's here! Who is this Sally anyhow? What has she done that you won't do w=
hen you're as old as=20

she is? . . . Yes, but don't you strike that note! No woman likes to be rem=
inded that she is ten=20

years older than any other woman on earth. She'll put me down as a cute you=
ng thing who has a=20

dangerous way with men. Dwight has praised me to her, of course--but she'll=
 put his liking down to=20

that--the--the--the sex side! I must show her it isn't, that I've got more,=
 that I don't want men but=20

women now! But not too hard or eager, you know. Oh, I must watch her all th=
e time, to see if I'm=20

getting any hold. And then, the minute I see my chance, I must tell her my =
trouble--no, my big=20

chance--all I was just on the point of doing with Joe, and could do now--if=
 only I had her for a=20

friend!"  Such thinking was spasmodic and often disconnected. Thoughts of J=
oe kept breaking in,=20

and of what she should do if she failed with him. And again, putting down w=
ith an effort all such=20

thoughts and fancies, she took Susette and the baby and went out for a walk=
 in the Park. It was=20

one of those balmy days that come in winter now and then, and Ethel sat dow=
n on a bench for a=20

while.  But then she looked around with a start. Who was that on a bench ne=
arby? A fat man with=20

a black moustache, his derby hat tipped over his forehead, and his two smal=
l piggish eyes=20

morosely and narrowly watching her. A detective--working for Fanny Carr! Et=
hel angrily rose and=20

called to Susette and wheeled the baby carriage away. But just as she passe=
d the fat man, a small=20

fat boy ran up to him.  "Say, Pa," whined the urchin. "Buy me a bag of pean=
uts."  "Like hell I will,"=20

the fat man growled.  And Ethel blushed. How absurd she had been!    CHAPTE=
R XXIII  In reply to=20

her note, Dwight had telephoned that Sally would be there at five. Mrs. Cro=
thers arrived at a=20

quarter past. She was a small alert looking woman of thirty-five, slender, =
almost wiry, dark, with=20

black hair worn over her temples. Her practice of his profession before the=
 board of examiners=20

mentioned in sec. 28, and upon passing the examination required and proving=
 to the satisfaction=20

of the board of examiners that he has complied with the rules and regulatio=
ns of the council, and=20

on payment of such fees as the council may establish, he shall be entitled =
to register and in virtue=20

of his registration to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery (_ib._, s.=
 25).  When it appears that=20

there has been established a central examining board similar to that consti=
tuted by this act, or an=20

institution duly recognized by the legislature of any of the provinces of t=
he Dominion of Canada as=20

the sole examining body for the purpose of granting certificates of qualifi=
cation, and wherein the=20

curriculum is equal to that established in Ontario, the holder of such cert=
ificate shall, upon due=20

proof, be entitled to registration by the council of Ontario if the same pr=
ivilege is accorded by such=20

examining board or institution to those holding certificates of Ontario (_i=
b._, s. 26).  BOARD OF=20

EXAMINERS.=E2=80=94The council is required at its annual meeting to elect a=
 board of examiners whose=20

duty it is to examine at least once in each year all candidates for registr=
ation in accordance with=20

the by-laws, rules, and regulations of the council; such examinations are t=
o be held at Toronto or=20

Kingston at such times and in such manner as the council may by by-laws dir=
ect (_ib._, s. 28).=20

The board of examiners is composed of one member from each existing teachin=
g body=20

enumerated in sec. 6 and one from every other school of medicine organized =
in connection with=20

any university or college empowered by law to grant medical or surgical dip=
lomas and not less=20

than six members chosen from the members of the College of Physicians and S=
urgeons of Ontario=20

unconnected with any such teaching body (_ib._, s. 29, as amended Act 1893,=
 c. 27, s. 5).=20

HOM=C5=92PATHISTS.=E2=80=94Every candidate who, at the time of the examinat=
ion,=20


_
she had nice pleasant eyes. She was wearing a pretty tan hat and grey furs =
that she put back on=20

her shoulders as she smiled and held out her hand.  "I'm so glad to meet yo=
u at last, my dear."=20

"Oh, thank you," said Ethel quickly. And then, because that sounded too gra=
teful, she added,=20

"Won't you sit down?" in rather a stilted little voice. This woman made her=
 feel so young. "Now=20

don't act like a school-girl!" With an appearance of lazy ease she turned a=
nd poked the small logs=20

in the fire. "I do so love wood fires. Don't you?" she said, in carefully e=
asy tones, but she did not=20

shall not be required to pass an examination in materia medica or therapeut=
ics, or the theory or=20

practice of physic or surgery or midwifery except the operative parts there=
of, before any examiners=20

other than those approved of by the representatives in the council of the h=
om=C5=93opathic system=20

(_ib._, s. 30).  DUTIES OF COUNCIL.=E2=80=94The council is required to make=
 orders, regulations, or by-

laws for regulating the register and fees for registration and for the guid=
ance of the board of=20

examiners, and may prescribe the subjects and modes of examination and the =
time and place of=20

holding the=20


_
Mrs. Crothers was wearing a trim street suit of brown and dark green. "She =
dresses as I do, so=20

_that's_ all right," thought Ethel. "She's taking me in. So much the better=
. I'll do the same." And as=20

they talked, she kept throwing glances at the dark face, rather narrow, the=
 small and rather=20

mischievous mouth, amid the grey eyes which looked as though they could be =
so very good-

humoured and friendly. But with a little pang of dismay Ethel saw that thes=
e eyes were=20

preoccupied and only half attending. "She has a hundred things on her mind,=
 and she's asking,=20

'Now let's try to see if there's really anything here worth while.'" The pr=
eliminaries were already=20

over. That part at least had gone smoothly enough. "We're off!" thought Eth=
el excitedly.  "How will=20

you have your tea?" she asked.  "Clear with lemon."  "One lump or two?"  "T=
hree or four."  "Oh,=20

how funny," Ethel laughed. And then she reddened. "You little goose," she e=
xclaimed to herself,=20

"why did you say, 'how funny'?" She poured the tea for examination not cont=
rary to the act as they=20

deem expedient and necessary (_ib._, s. 31).  ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION.=E2=
=80=94Every person=20

registered who obtains a higher degree or other qualification is, on the pa=
yment of the fee, entitled=20

to have it inscribed in the register in substitution for or in addition to =
the qualifications previously=20

registered (_ib._, s. 32).  POWERS OF REGISTRAR.=E2=80=94No qualification i=
s to be entered on the=20

register unless the registrar be satisfied by proper evidence that the pers=
on claiming it is entitled to=20

it. Appeal from the decision of the registrar may be decided by the council=
; any entry proved to the=20

satisfaction of the council to have been fraudulently or incorrectly made m=
ay be erased from the=20

register by order of the council in writing (_ib._, s. 33 [1]).  If the reg=
istrar be dissatisfied with the=20

evidence adduced by a person claiming to be registered, he has power, subje=
ct to appeal to the=20

council, to refuse registration until such evidence is furnished, duly=20
