India, Egypt, and Greece, to China and Chaldaea, and thus spread all over t=
he world. All that is=20

good, noble, and grand in human nature, every divine faculty and aspiration=
, were cultured by the=20

Priest-Philosophers who sought to develop them in their Initiates. Their co=
de of ethics, based on=20

altruism, has become universal. It is found in Confucius, the "atheist," wh=
o taught that "he who=20

loves not his brother has no virtue in him," and in the _Old Testament_ pre=
cept, "Thou shalt love=20

thy neighbour as thyself."(501) The greater Initiates became like unto Gods=
, and Socrates, in=20

Plato's _Phaedo_, is represented as saying:       The Initiates are sure to=
 come into the company=20

of the Gods.   In the same work the great Athenian Sage is made to say:    =
   It is quite apparent=20

that those who have established the     Mysteries, or the secret assemblies=
 of the Initiates, were=20

no mean     persons, but powerful genii, who from the first ages had     en=
deavoured to make us=20

understand under those enigmas that he who     will reach the invisible reg=
ions unpurified will be=20

hurled into     the abyss [the Eighth Sphere of the Occult Doctrine; that i=
s, he     will lose his=20

personality for ever], while he who will attain them     purged of the macu=
lations of this world, and=20

accomplished in     virtues, will be received in the abode of the Gods.   S=
aid Clemens=20

Alexandrinus, referring to the Mysteries:       Here ends all teaching. One=
 sees Nature and all=20

things.   A Christian Father of the Church speaks then as did the Pagan Pre=
textatus, the pro-

consul of Achaia (fourth century A.D.), "a man of eminent virtues," who rem=
arked that to deprive=20

the Greeks of "the sacred Mysteries which bind in one the whole of mankind,=
" was to render their=20

very lives worthless to them. Would the Mysteries have ever obtained the hi=
ghest praise from the=20

noblest men of antiquity had they not been of more than human origin? Read =
all that is said=20

belongs to some one who bears his name. Alight, Planchet, and inquire, for =
I confess that I have=20

scarcely courage so to do."  Planchet alighted.  "Thou must add," said D'Ar=
tagnan, "that a=20

gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects=
 to the Comte de la=20

Fere, and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest, then mention my nam=
e!"  Planchet, leading=20

his horse by the bridle, drew near to the gate and rang the bell, and immed=
iately a servant-man=20

with white hair and of erect stature, notwithstanding his age, presented hi=
mself.  "Does Monsieur=20

le Comte de la Fere live here?" asked Planchet.  "Yes, monsieur, it is here=
 he lives," the servant=20

replied to Planchet, who was not in livery.  "A nobleman retired from servi=
ce, is he not?"  "Yes."=20

"And who had a lackey named Grimaud?" persisted Planchet, who had prudently=
 considered that=20

he couldn't have too much information.  "Monsieur Grimaud is absent from th=
e chateau for the=20

time being," said the servitor, who, little used as he was to such inquirie=
s, began to examine=20

Planchet from head to foot.  "Then," cried Planchet joyously, "I see well t=
hat it is the same Comte=20

de la Fere whom we seek. Be good enough to open to me, for I wish to announ=
ce to monsieur le=20

comte that my master, one of his friends, is here, and wishes to greet him.=
"  "Why didn't you say=20

so?" said the servitor, opening the gate. "But where is your master?"  "He =
is following me."  The=20

servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet, who made a sign to D'A=
rtagnan. The latter,=20

his heart palpitating more than ever, entered the courtyard without dismoun=
ting.  Whilst Planchet=20

was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say:  "Well, wh=
ere is this gentleman=20

and why do they not bring him here?"  This voice, the sound of which reache=
d D'Artagnan,=20

reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments, a thousand recollections tha=
t he had forgotten.=20

He vaulted=20


_
much by those who had never been initiated, as by the Initiates themselves.=
 Consult Plato,=20

Euripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Pindar, Plutarch, Isocrates, Diodorus, C=
icero, Epictetus,=20

Marcus Aurelius, not to name dozens of other famous Sages and writers. That=
 which the Gods=20

and Angels had _revealed_, exoteric religions, beginning with that of Moses=
, _reveiled_ and hid=20

for ages from the sight of the world. Joseph, the son of Jacob, was an Init=
iate, otherwise he would=20

not have married Aseneth, the daughter of Petephre ("Potiphar"--"he who bel=
ongs to Phre," the=20

Sun- God), priest of Heliopolis and governor of On.(502) Every truth _revea=
led_ by Jesus, and=20

which even the Jews and early Christians understood, was _reveiled_ by the =
Church that pretends=20

to serve Him. Read what Seneca says, as quoted by Dr. Kenealy:       "The w=
orld being melted=20

and smile on his lips, advanced toward the master of the house.  "But I kno=
w you, my lad," said=20

Athos, appearing on the threshold.  "Oh, yes, monsieur le comte, you know m=
e and I know you. I=20

am Planchet--Planchet, whom you know well." But the honest servant could sa=
y no more, so much=20

was he overcome by this unexpected interview.  "What, Planchet, is Monsieur=
 d'Artagnan here?"=20

"Here I am, my friend, dear Athos!" cried D'Artagnan, in a faltering voice =
and almost staggering=20

from agitation.  At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beau=
tiful countenance and=20

calm features of Athos. He rushed toward D'Artagnan with eyes fixed upon hi=
m and clasped him in=20

his arms. D'Artagnan, equally moved, pressed him also closely to him, whils=
t tears stood in his=20

eyes. Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room, wh=
ere there were=20


_
[or Parabrahman], this God continues for some time totally     concentred i=
n himself and remains=20

concealed, as it were, wholly     immersed in the contemplation of his own =
ideas. Afterwards we=20

see     a new world spring from him.... An innocent race of men is     form=
ed." And again, speaking=20

of a mundane dissolution as involving     the destruction or death of all, =
he [Seneca] teaches us=20

that when     the laws of Nature shall be buried in ruin and the last day o=
f the     world  "I present to=20

you," he said, "Monsieur le Chevalier D'Artagnan, lieutenant of his majesty=
's musketeers, a=20

devoted friend and one of the most excellent, brave gentlemen that I have e=
ver known."=20

D'Artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own wa=
y, and whilst the=20

conversation became general he looked earnestly at Athos.  Strange! Athos w=
as scarcely aged at=20

all! His fine eyes, no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of =
dissipation pencil too=20
