many other freaks of nature all seem to strengthen the evidence on which th=

Throughout the mountainous region are wonderful examples of Nature's divers=
e skill. Among the=20

most striking are Castle Rock, or Wehatpolitan's gravestone, a great basalt=
ic rock 900 feet high;=20

St. Peter's Dome, a sublime elevation of 2,000 feet, considered one of the =
wonders of the=20

American continent; Oneonta Gorge, almost concealed behind towering rocks; =
Multnomah Falls, a=20

matchless waterfall with a sheer drop of 800 feet; Cape Horn, a long palisa=
de of basalt; Rooster=20

Rock, unsurpassed for beauty of form and variety of color; and Cape Eternit=
y, a massive precipice=20

1,000 feet in height.  Thorough appreciation of the surrounding charms nece=
ssitates climbing=20

some of the neighboring hills, or traveling over the wooded river banks and=
 visiting the rustic towns=20

that lie at the foot of the mountains and guard the gateway to the alluring=
 valleys. Near Stevenson,=20

county seat of Skamania county, overlooking the cascade locks, and Carson, =
are several hot=20

springs where accommodations for the most particular are boyish. His face w=
as broad though=20

lean, the features rather blunt, the eyes set wide apart; clear, trustworth=
y, light-blue eyes. He=20

looked just what he was--a healthy, happy, prosperous young Englishman with=
out a real care in=20

the world. After all, Jan reflected, there was plenty of room at Wren's End=
, and it was good for the=20

children to grow up with animals.  "I had thought of an Airedale," she said=
 thoughtfully, "but----"=20

"They're good dogs, but quarrelsome--fight all the other dogs round about. =
Now William isn't a=20

fighter unless he's unbearably provoked, then, of course, he fights to kill=
."  "Oh dear!" sighed Jan,=20

"that's an awful prospect. Think of the trouble with one's neighbours----" =
 "But I assure you, it=20

doesn't happen once in a blue moon. I've never known him fight yet."  "I'll=
 tell you what, Captain=20

Middleton; let me keep him for the present, till you know where you're goin=
g to be stationed, and=20

then, if you find you can have him, he's there for you to take. I'll do my =
best for him, but I want you=20

to feel he's still your dog...."  "It's simply no end good of you, Miss Ros=

ies are maintained. A=20

few miles further are the Government Hot Springs, near which many low peaks=
, easy for climbing,=20

offer expansive views of the surrounding country.  [Illustration: THE SNAKE=

e famous White=20

Salmon Valley takes one to Trout Lake, not far from the ice and lava caves =
in the foothills of Mount=20

Adams, and near Huckleberry Mountain, a pow-wow place for the Indians. On t=
he way, hundreds=20

of scientifically developed orchards, and oat fields yielding over 100 bush=
els to the acre, are=20

passed; also the Northwest Electric Company's power plant, which, generatin=
g 20,000 horse=20

power, supplies power to cities seventy-five miles away. From the massive b=
luffs of White Salmon=20

a panorama of perfectly blending color may be seen, formed by the unusual c=
ombination of the=20

Columbia River and the mountains to the east and the west, while the entire=
 Hood River Valley,=20

with Mount Hood beyond, is visible on the Oregon side.  The trip from Lyle =
to Goldendale along=20

the Klickitat River is a journey of surprises. The railroad follows the win=
ding canyon past pretty=20

waterfalls, crosses hurrying brooks, and emerges finally into a wide, ferti=
le plain overlooking the=20

Columbia basin. Fields of waving grain and other products exhibit the richn=
ess of the Klickitat=20

valley. Those desiring can motor from Goldendale into the Yakima valley or =
return to the Columbia=20

via Maryhill, where Hon. Samuel Hill has built a $100,000 road across his 6=
,000-acre farm.  Nor do=20

all the wonders belong to the lower Columbia. Before being joined by the Sn=
ake River, it has=20

drained a region noted for agricultural superiority and contributed liberal=
ly to the needs of=20

irrigation. The "Big Bend" on the left, and the valleys watered by its trib=
utaries from the right, are=20

described under the chapter entitled "The Inland Empire."  Following its ch=
annel still farther=20

towards the source, wilder scenes are met with, the gorges are deeper, the =
cascades noisier,=20

native trees more plentiful, waterfalls higher, and the course of the strea=
m more winding. Startling=20

phenomena appear in rapid succession, and scenes unimagined will astonish t=
he tourist who=20

spends a little time in re-exploring this great river, for ages a prize eag=
erly sought by the searchers=20

for the unknown.  [Illustration: ROCK LAKE, 25 MILES SOUTHWEST OF SPOKANE. =

years ago, scientists tell us, there existed between the Rocky Mountains an=

any special treatment?"  "Oh dear, no. William's as strong as a young calf.=

easy dogs in that way--they don't need you to be racing about all day like =
some."  The present fate=20

of William Bloomsbury with the lengthy and exalted pedigree being settled, =
Jan asked politely for=20

her tenants, Colonel and Mrs. Walcote, heard that it had been an excellent =
and open season, and=20

enjoyed her guest's real enthusiasm about Wren's End.  After a few minutes =
of general=20

conversation he got up to go. She saw him out and rang up the lift, but no =
lift came. She rang=20



again and again. Nothing happened. Evidently something had gone wrong, and =
she saw people=20

walking upstairs to the flats below. Just as she was explaining the mishap =
to her guest, the=20

telephone bell sounded loudly and persistently.  "Oh dear!" she cried. "Wou=
ld you mind very much=20

stopping a young lady with two little children, if you meet them at the bot=
tom of the stairs, and tell=20

her she is on no account to carry up little Fay. It's my friend, Miss Morto=
n; she's out with them, and=20

she's not at all strong; tell her to wait for me. I'll come the minute I've=
 answered this wretched=20

'phone."  "Don't you worry, Miss Ross, I'll stop 'em and carry up the kiddi=
es myself," Captain=20

Middleton called as he started to run down, and Jan went back to answer the=
 telephone.  He ran=20

fast, for Jan's voice had been anxious and distressed. Five long flights di=
d he descend, and at the=20

bottom he met Meg and the children just arrived to hear the melancholy news=
 from the hall porter.=20

Meg always wheeled little Fay to and from the gardens in the funny little f=
olding "pram" they had=20

brought from India. The plump baby was a tight fit, but the queer little ca=
rriage was light and easily=20

managed. The big policeman outside the gate often held up the traffic to le=
t Meg and her charges=20

get across the road safely, and she would sail serenely through the avenue =
of fiercely panting=20

monsters with Tony holding on to her coat, while little Fay waved delighted=
ly to the drivers. That=20

afternoon she was very tired, for it had started to rain, cold, gusty March=
 rain. She had hurried=20

home in dread lest Tony should take cold. It seemed the last straw, somehow=
, that the lift should=20

have gone wrong. She left the pram with the porter and was just bracing her=
self to carry heavy=20

little Fay when this very tall young man came dashing down the staircase, s=
aw them and raised=20

his hat. "Miss Morton? Miss Ross has just entrusted me with a message ... t=
hat I'm to carry her=20

niece upstairs," and he took little Fay out of Meg's arms.  Meg looked up a=
t him. She had to look=20

up a long way--and he looked down into a very small white face.  The=20


_
plain, now known as the Inland Empire.  What was once a desolate waste, how=
ever, has been=20

transformed into a "Land of Canaan." Its plateaus unite to form one of the =
bountiful "bread baskets=20

of the world" while its valleys yield generously of nearly all the products=
 of husbandry. Near its=20

borders the mountains, with their Tony a very pink nose, only left Meg pall=
id with fatigue; but she=20

smiled at Captain Middleton, and it was a smile of such radiant happiness a=
s wholly transfigured=20

her face. It came from the exquisite knowledge that Jan had thought of her,=
 had known she would=20

be tired.  To be loved, to be remembered, to be taken care of was=20

beyond the boundaries of our own state spreads this wonderful wonderful thi=
ng in the world. It=20

went to her head like wine.  Therefore did she smile at Captain Middleton i=
n this distracting=20

fashion. It started tremblingly at the corners of her mouth, and then--quit=

face became dimpled and beseeching=20
