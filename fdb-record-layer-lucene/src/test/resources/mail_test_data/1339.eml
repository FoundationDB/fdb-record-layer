 never agree with you. Where are you going?"  "I am going West, Monday."  "=
How odd!" she commented. "We are going West, too--father and I--though not =
quite so soon as Monday."  "You are?" he queried. "Whereabout in the West?"=
  She did not tell him where. The car motor was whirring smoothly long, but=
 short and violent. But this was not the kind of a sea she had through the =
night.  In a heavy sea of any kind she made a good deal of fuss; and being =
only forty feet long it could not be otherwise. She pitched tremendously, a=
nd mixed in a considerable roll every time she rose and fell; and it was no=
t an easy thing for even a sailor to philodendron monstera fireside. I don'=

don't care anything about dancing."  The chauffeur had placed his other pas=
sengers in the=20

tonneau, and was trying to crank the motor. Blount was thankful that the ne=
w Italian engine was=20

refusing to take the spark. The delay was giving him an added moment or two=
.  "No, I don't care=20

much for dancing; and you know very well why I couldn't, or wouldn't, be an=

Maud was off the cape mentioned.  [Illustration: "IT HAD BEEN A STORMY NIGH=

It is the only thing=20

to do."  "I am sorry you are taking it this way, Evan," she deprecated, in =
the sisterly tone that=20

always made him hotly resentful. "It hurts my sense of proportion."  "Somet=
imes I think you haven't=20

any sense of proportion, Patricia," he retorted half-morosely. "If you have=
, I am sure it is frightfully=20

 and a white-haired old=20

gentleman in the little steamer ought to be off Cape Arnauti; but all the l=

nor shoals. There was=20

nothing less than twenty fathoms of water a couple of miles from the shore.=
  The gale had come=20

from the south; and the course of the Maud was only a couple of points from=

refusing to quarrel with you now. It pleases you to believe that a woman's =
place in this twentieth-

century world is inevitably at first dog-watch, and she had carried it all =
