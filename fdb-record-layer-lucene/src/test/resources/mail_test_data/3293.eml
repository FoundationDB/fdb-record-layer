Happy thoughts, not fears, hold his eyes waking. "I remember Thee upon my b=
ed."  The fruition=20

heartens for renewed exercise of confidence, in which David feels himself u=
pheld by God, and=20

foresees his enemies' defeat and his own triumph. "My soul cleaveth after T=
hee"--a remarkable=20

phrase, in which the two metaphors of tenacious adherence and eager followi=
ng are mingled to=20

express the two "phases of faith," which are  "We earn enough for our wants=
.  That is not our=20

distress.  My husband is very, very ill of a lingering disorder.  He will n=
ever recover--"  "You check=20

yourself.  If it is for want of the encouraging word you spoke of, take it =
from me.  I cannot forget the=20

old time, Beatrice."  "God bless you!" she replied, with a burst of tears, =
and gave him her trembling=20

hand.  "Compose yourself.  I cannot be composed if you are not, for to see =
you weep distresses=20

me beyond expression.  Speak freely to me.  Trust me."  She shaded her=20


_
union with and quest after God, the possession which pursues, the pursuit w=
hich possesses Him=20

who is at once grasped and felt after by the finite creature whose straites=
t narrowness is not too=20

narrow to be blessed by some indwelling of God, but whose widest expansion =
of capacity and=20

desire can but contain a fragment of His fulness. From such elevation of hi=
gh communion he looks=20

down and onward into the dim future, his enemies sunken, like Korah and his=
 rebels, into the=20

gaping earth, or scattered in fight, and the jackals that were snuffing hun=
grily about his camp in the=20

wilderness gorging themselves on corpses, while he himself, once more "king=
," shall rejoice in=20

God, and with his faithful companions, whose lips and hearts were true to G=
od and His anointed,=20

shall glory in the deliverance that by the arbitrament of victory has flung=
 back Her voice had the=20

ring of Polly's.  "It is not that my husband's mind is at all impaired by h=
is bodily suffering, for I=20

assure you that is not the case.  But in his weakness, and in his knowledge=
 that he is incurably ill,=20

he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one idea.  It preys upon him, embitter=
s every moment of=20

his painful life, and will shorten it."  She stopping, he said again: "Spea=
k freely to me.  Trust me."=20

"We have had five children before this darling, and they all lie in their l=
ittle graves.  He believes=20

that they have withered away under a curse, and that it will blight this ch=
ild like the rest."  "Under=20

what curse?"  "Both I and he have it on our conscience that we tried you ve=
ry heavily, and I do not=20

know but that, if I were as ill as he, I might suffer in my mind as he does=
.  This is the constant=20

burden:--'I believe,=20

ence to psalm lxii.,=20

which seems also to belong to this time. It has several points of contact w=
ith those already=20

considered, _e.g._, the phrase, "sons of men," in the sense of "nobles" (ve=
r. 9); "my soul," as=20

equivalent to "myself," and yet as a was the only friend that Mr. Jackson e=
ver cared to make,=20

though I was so much his junior.  The more influence he acquired in the bus=
iness, the higher he=20

advanced me, and I was alone in his private confidence.  I came between him=
 and you, and I took=20

you from him.  We were both secret, and the blow fell when he was wholly=20

exhort; the significant use of the term "people," and the double exhortatio=
ns to his own devout=20

followers and to the arrogant enemy. The whole tone is that of patient resi=
gnation, which we have=20

found characterising David now. The first words are the key-note of the who=
le, "Truly unto God my=20

soul is silence"--is all one so compressed, must have been terrible; the wr=
ath it awakened,=20

inappeasable.  So, a curse came to be invoked on our poor pretty little flo=
wers, and they fall.'"=20

"And you, Beatrice," he asked, when she had ceased to speak, and there had =
been a silence=20

afterwards: "how say you?"  "Until within these few weeks I was afraid=20


_
submissive waiting upon Him. It was in the very crisis of his fate, in the =
suspense of the uncertain=20

issue of the rebellion, that these words, the very sound of which has calme=
d many a heart since,=20

welled to his lips. The expression of unwavering faith and unbroken peace i=
s much heightened by=20

the frequent recurrence of the word which is you would never, never, forgiv=
e."  "Until within these=20

few weeks," he repeated.  "Have you changed your opinion of me within these=
 few weeks?"=20

"Yes."  "For what reason?"  "I was getting some pieces of music in a shop i=

my terror, you came in.  As I veiled my face and stood in the dark end of t=

 affirmation, like the "verily" of=20

the New Testament, and is here most significantly prefixed to the assertion=

resignation (ver. 1); of God's defence (ver. 2); of bedridden girl.  Your v=
