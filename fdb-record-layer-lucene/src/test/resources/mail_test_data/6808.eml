t. Passing through the=20

territory of Saul's tribe--dangerous ground for him to tread--the rank hatr=
ed of Shimei's heart=20

blossoms into speech. With Eastern vehemence, he curses and flings stones a=
nd dust in the=20

transports of his fury, stumbling along among the rocks high up on the side=
 of the glen, as he=20

keeps abreast of the little band below. Did David remember how the husband =
from whom he had=20

torn Michal had followed her to this very place, and there had turned back =
weeping to his lonely=20

home? The remembrance, at any rate, of later and more evil deeds prompted h=
is meek answer,=20

"Let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him."  The first force of the disa=
ster spent itself, and by the=20

time he was safe across Jordan, on the free uplands of Bashan, his spirit r=
ises. He makes a stand=20

at Mahanaim, the place where his great ancestor, in circumstances somewhat =
analogous to his=20

own, had seen the vision of "bright-harnessed angels" ranked in battle arra=
y for the defence of=20

himself and his own little band, and called the name of the place the "two =
camps." Perhaps that=20

old story helped to hearten him, as the defection of Ahithophel from the co=
nspiracy certainly would=20

do. As the time went on, too, it became increasingly obvious that the leade=
rs of the rebellion were=20

"infirm of purpose," and that every day of respite from actual fighting dim=
inished their chances of=20

success, as that politic adviser saw so plainly. Whatever may have been the=
 reason, it is clear that=20

by the time David had reached Mahanaim he had resolved not to yield without=
 a struggle. He girds=20

on his sword once more with some of the animation of early days, and the li=
ght of trustful valour=20

blazes again in his old eyes.     XV. THE SONGS OF THE FUGITIVE.   The psal=
ms which=20

probably belong to the period of Absalom's rebellion correspond well with t=
he impression of his=20

spirit gathered from the historical books. Confidence in God, submission to=
 His will, are strongly=20

expressed in them, and we may almost discern a progress in the former respe=
ct as the rebellion=20

grows. They flame brighter and brighter in the deepening darkness. From the=
 lowest abyss the=20

stars are seen most clearly. He is far more buoyant when he is an exile onc=
e more in the=20

wilderness, and when the masks of plot and trickery are fallen, and the dan=
ger stands clear before=20

him. Like some good ship issuing from the shelter of the pier heads, the fi=
rst blow of the waves=20

throws her over on her side and makes her quiver like a living thing recoil=
ing from a terror, but she=20

rises above the tossing surges and keeps her course. We may allocate with a=
 fair amount of=20

likelihood the following psalms to this period--iii.; iv.; xxv. (?); xxviii=
. (?); lviii. (?); lxi.; lxii.; lxiii.; cix.=20

(?); cxliii.  The first two of these form a pair; they are a morning and an=
 evening hymn. The little=20

band are encamped on their road to Mahanaim, with no roof but the stars, an=
d no walls but the=20

arm of God. In the former the discrowned king sings, as he rises from his n=
ightly bivouac. He=20

pours out first his plaint of the foes, who are described as "many," and as=
 saying that, "There is no=20

help for him in God," words which fully correspond to the formidable dimens=
ions of the revolt, and=20

to the belief which actuated the conspirators, and had appeared as possible=
 even to himself, that=20

his sin had turned away the aid of heaven from his cause. To such utterance=
s of malice and=20

confident hatred he opposes the conviction which had again filled his soul,=
 that even in the midst=20

of real peril and the shock of battle Jehovah is his "shield." With bowed a=
nd covered head he had=20

fled from Jerusalem, but "Thou art the lifter up of mine head." He was an e=
xile from the tabernacle=20

on Zion, and he had sent back the ark to its rest; but though he has to cry=
 to God from beyond=20

Jordan, He answers "from His holy hill." He and his men camped amidst dange=
rs, but one=20

unslumbering Helper mounted guard over their undefended slumbers. "I laid m=
e down and slept"=20



there among the echoes of the hills. "I awaked, for Jehovah sustained me;" =
and another night has=20

passed without the sudden shout of the rebels breaking the silence, or the =
gleam of their swords in=20

the starlight. The experience of protection thus far heartens him to front =
even the threatening circle=20

of his foes around him, whom it is his pain to think of as "the people" of =
God, and yet as his foes.=20

And then he betakes himself in renewed energy of faith to his one weapon of=
 prayer, and even=20

before the battle sees the victory, and the Divine power fracturing the jaw=
s and breaking the teeth=20

of the wild beasts who hunt him. But his last thought is not of retribution=
 nor of fear; for himself he=20

rises to the height of serene trust, "Salvation is of the Lord;" and  "Ah! =
I think," said Barbox=20

Brothers, with a desperate air of resignation, "that we had better give it =
up."  "But I am lost," said=20

the child, nestling her little hand more closely in his, "and you'll take c=
are of me, won't you?"  If=20

ever a man were disconcerted by division between compassion on the one hand=
, and the very=20

imbecility of irresolution on the other, here the man was.  "Lost!" he repe=
ated, looking down at the=20

child.  "I am sure _I_ am. What is to be done!"  "Where do _you_ live?" ask=
ed the child, looking up=20

at him, wistfully.  "Over there," he answered, pointing vaguely in the dire=
ction of his hotel.  "Hadn't=20

we better go there?" said the child.  "Really," he replied, "I don't know b=
ut what we had."  So they=20

set off, hand in hand.  He, through comparison of himself against his littl=
e companion, with a=20

clumsy feeling on him as if he had just developed into a foolish giant.  Sh=
e, clearly elevated in her=20

own tiny opinion by having got him so neatly out of his embarrassment.  "We=
 are going to have=20

dinner when we get there, I suppose?" said Polly.  "Well," he rejoined, "I-=
-yes, I suppose we are."=20

"Do you like your dinner?" asked the child.  "Why, on the whole," said Barb=
ox Brothers, "yes, I=20

think I do."  "I do mine," said Polly.  "Have you any brothers and sisters?=
"  "No.  Have you?"  "Mine=20

are dead."  "Oh!" said Barbox Brothers.  With that absurd sense of unwieldi=
ness of mind and body=20

weighing him down, he would have not known how to pursue the conversation b=
eyond this curt=20

rejoinder, but that the child was always ready for him.  "What," she asked,=
 turning her soft hand=20

coaxingly in his, "are you going to do to amuse me, after dinner?"  "Upon m=
y soul, Polly,"=20

exclaimed Barbox Brothers, very much at a loss, "I have not the slightest i=
dea!"  "Then I tell you=20

what," said Polly.  "Have you got any cards at your house?"  "Plenty," said=
 Barbox Brothers, in a=20

boastful vein.  "Very well.  Then I'll build houses, and you shall look at =
me.  You mustn't blow, you=20

know."  "O no!" said Barbox Brothers.  "No, no, no.  No blowing.  Blowing's=
 not fair."  He flattered=20

himself that he had said this pretty well for an idiotic Monster; but the c=
hild, instantly perceiving the=20

awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level, utterly destroyed=
 his hopeful opinion of=20

himself by saying, compassionately: "What a funny man you are!"  Feeling, a=
fter this melancholy=20

failure, as if he every minute grew bigger and heavier in person, and weake=
r in mind, Barbox gave=20

himself up for a bad job.  No giant ever submitted more meekly to be led in=
 triumph by all-

conquering Jack, than he to be bound in slavery to Polly.  "Do you know any=
 stories?" she asked=20

him.  He was reduced to the humiliating confession: "No."  "What a dunce yo=
u must be, mustn't=20

you?" said Polly.  He was reduced to the humiliating confession: "Yes."  "W=
ould you like me to=20

teach you a story?  But you must remember it, you know, and be able to tell=
 it right to somebody=20

else afterwards."  He professed that it would afford him the highest mental=
 gratification to be=20

taught a story, and that he would humbly endeavour to retain it in his mind=
.  Whereupon Polly,=20

giving her hand a new little turn in his, expressive of settling down for e=
njoyment, commenced a=20

long romance, of which every relishing clause began with the words: "So thi=
s" or "And so this."=20



As, "So this boy;" or, "So this fairy;" or, "And so this pie was four yards=
 round, and two yards and a=20

quarter deep."  The interest of the romance was derived from the interventi=
on of this fairy to punish=20

this boy for having a greedy appetite.  To achieve which purpose, this fair=
y made this pie, and this=20

boy ate and ate and ate, and his cheeks swelled and swelled and swelled.  T=
here were many=20

tributary circumstances, but the forcible interest culminated in the total =
consumption of this pie,=20

and the bursting of this boy.  Truly he was a fine sight, Barbox Brothers, =
with serious attentive=20

face, and ear bent down, much jostled on the pavements of the busy town, bu=
t afraid of losing a=20

single incident of the epic, lest he should be examined in it by-and-by and=
 found deficient.  Thus=20

they arrived at the hotel.  And there he had to say at the bar, and said aw=
kwardly enough: "I have=20

found a little girl!"  The whole establishment turned out to look at the li=
ttle girl.  Nobody knew her;=20

nobody could make out her name, as she set it forth--except one chambermaid=
, who said it was=20

Constantinople--which it wasn't.  "I will dine with my young friend in a pr=
ivate room," said Barbox=20

Brothers to the hotel authorities, "and perhaps you will be so good as let =
the police know that the=20

pretty baby is here.  I suppose she is sure to be inquired for, soon, if sh=
e has not been already.=20

Come along, Polly."  Perfectly at ease and peace, Polly came along, but, fi=
nding the=20


_
nation that had risen against him his thoughts are worthy of a true king, f=
reed from all personal=20

animosity, and his words are a prayer conceived in the spirit of Him whose =
dying breath was=20

intercession for His rebellious subjects who crucified their King, "Thy ble=
ssing be upon Thy=20

people."  The fourth psalm is the companion evening hymn. Its former portio=
n (vers. 2-4) seems to=20

be a remonstrance addressed as if to the leaders of the revolt ("sons of me=
n" being equivalent to=20

"persons of rank and dignity"). It is the expression in vivid form, most na=
tural to such a nature, of=20

his painful feeling under their slanders; and also of his hopes and desires=
 for them, that calm=20

thought in these still evening hours which are falling on the world may lea=
d them to purer service=20

and to reliance on God. So forgivingly, so lovingly does he think of them, =
ere he lays himself down=20

to rest, rather stiff work, was carried up by Barbox Brothers.  The dinner =
was a most transcendent=20

success, and the Barbox sheepishness, under Polly's directions how to mince=
 her meat for her,=20

and how to diffuse gravy over the plate with a liberal and equal hand, was =
another fine sight.  "And=20

now," said Polly, "while we are at dinner, you be good, and tell me that st=
ory I taught you."  With=20

the tremors of a civil service examination on him, and very uncertain indee=
d, not only as to the=20

epoch at which the pie appeared in history, but also as to the measurements=
 of that indispensable=20

fact, Barbox Brothers made a shaky beginning, but under encouragement did v=
ery fairly.  There=20

was a want of breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks, as well as=
 the appetite, of the=20

boy; and there was a certain tameness in his fairy, referable to an under-c=
urrent of desire to=20

account for her.=20


_
his, the peace of meditative contemplation may rest, and the day of war's a=
larms be shut in by=20

holy "communion with their own hearts" and with God.  The second portion tu=
rns to himself and his=20

followers, among whom we may suppose some faint hearts monster, it passed m=
uster.  "I told you=20

to be good," said Polly, "and you are good, ain't you?"  "I hope so," repli=
ed Barbox Brothers.  Such=20

was his deference that Polly, elevated on a platform of sofa-cushions in a =
chair at his right hand,=20

encouraged=20
