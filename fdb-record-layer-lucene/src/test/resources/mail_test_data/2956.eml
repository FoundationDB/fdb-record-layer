and skill. If more than this is expected it must be expressly stipulated fo=

therefore, is, that a medical man, who attends for a fee, is liable for suc=
h want of ordinary care,=20

diligence or skill on his part as leads to the injury of his patient. To re=
nder him liable, it is not=20

enough that there has been a less degree of skill than some other medical m=

shown, or a less degree of care than even himself might have bestowed; nor =
is it enough that he=20

himself acknowledged some degree of want of care; there must have been a wa=
nt of competent=20

and ordinary care and skill, and to such a degree as to have led to a bad r=
esult.... But a professed=20

physician or surgeon is bound to use not only such skill as he has, but to =
have a reasonable=20

degree of skill. The law will not countenance quackery; and although the la=
w does not require the=20

most thorough education or the largest experience, it does require that an =
uneducated, ignorant=20

man shall not, under the pretence of being a well-qualified physician, atte=

titioner, however, frankly=20
