wine now, a whole glass of it, and tried to be very boisterous with the man=

smiling back as though he could barely hear her voice. "He has had too much=

relief that she could do this rather well. Thank Heaven she had taken those=
 dancing lessons a=20

year ago; and she was younger than most of these creatures, and more lithe =
and supple. The men=20

were noticing, crowding around her. She caught a glare from one of their wi=
ves. And that glare=20

helped tremendously, it came like a gleam of light in the dark. She caught =
Joe's admiring glances.=20

She danced with him, then turned him down for somebody else, kept turning h=
im down. She threw=20

into her dancing an angry vim; but joy was coming into it, too. This was no=
t so bad, after all. "You=20

may even grow to like all this!" But most of her thinking was a whirl.  She=
 went home in a taxi, in=20

Joe's arms. She thought, "This is how he and Amy came home. Never mind, I'm=
 not half so weak=20

as I thought. I can play this game--"  And play it she did.  The next morni=
ng they slept very late.=20

They had breakfast in bed, and when Joe had gone she lay thinking. Her mind=
 was marvellously=20

clear. It went swiftly over the night before. Yes, most of it had been simp=
ly disgusting, the eating=20

and drinking, those warm moist eyes. "The way the men looked at you, held y=
ou! This is no life for=20

you, Ethel Lanier!" The dancing was all she cared about. She wanted that, b=
ut with other men=20

whom she would like to be friends with--"men who would treat you as somethi=
ng more than a, than=20

a--I don't know what!" Yes, she must get away from these creatures, and get=
 Joe away, too; but to=20

do it she must show him first that she was really willing to do her best to=
 like them all. The next=20

thing was to ask them here. "It's the only way to break their hold. Show hi=
m you're no jealous cat.=20

And how do I know that among them all, as I go about, I won't find a few th=
at aren't so tough? And=20

through them I'll find others."   But she put off entertaining Joe's friend=
s, for she had her hands full=20

now in managing just Joe alone. Amy's husband was coming to life in him. Of=
 that there could be=20

no mistake. Under the spell of his success, and still more perhaps through =
his pride and delight in=20

his handsome young wife, Joe was showing his love for her as Amy had taught=
 him long ago. He=20

showered gifts upon her. He delighted in surprises. One was a smart little =
town car, and this was a=20

very pleasant surprise. But in it he insisted upon her shopping busily. No =
more wearing last year's=20

clothes! And when she was a bit slow to move, to her dismay he went himself=
 with Fanny Carr,=20

and bought for Ethel's birthday a costly set of furs and a brooch. He nearl=
y bought pearl earrings,=20

too, but Ethel took them back at once. "Fanny knows as well as I do myself =
that I can't wear=20

pearls!" she thought angrily. She exchanged them for opal pendants. And the=
n, in order to put a=20

stop to Fanny's detestable attempts "to make me look like a perfect fright,=
" Ethel did start in and=20

shop. And as soon as she got well into it, what a fever it became! Sternly =
eyeing herself in the=20

mirrors of shops, she studied and made mistakes by the score, and corrected=
 and went on and on.=20

"I'll look right if kills me!"  One night she learned what Fanny Carr had h=
ad in mind when she came=20

"poking into our lives!" For Fanny was poor--she had long guessed that; and=
 Fanny had a house=20

on Long Island, and only by a hair's--breadth now did Ethel keep her from s=
elling it to Joe as a=20

surprise for his wife.  "Well, Fanny, what next?" thought Ethel that night.=
 She had been awake for=20

hours, perfectly still and motionless, not to disturb her husband. "For you=
 are not through yet, Mrs.=20

Carr. So long as we're rich and you are poor and have no immediate husband,=
 you're going to act=20

like a ravening wolf--aren't you, my own precious. You mean to break my hol=
d on him by keeping=20

him thinking of her, of her! Now what am I to do about it?" She frowned. Sh=
e knew that she ought=20

to talk frankly to Joe, and get over this silly habit of never mentioning A=
my's name! She grew=20

determined, but then weak. For what could she say to him about Amy? What di=
d she really want to=20

say? "Do I know poor Amy was anything bad? Wasn't she good to me? Would I c=
are to try to talk=20



against her? advertisement offers his services to the public as a practitio=

or midwifery, or who by such sign or advertisement assumes the title of doc=
tor, shall obtain a=20

certificate from one of such medical societies, either from a county, distr=
ict, or State society (_ib._,=20

s. 3,909).  A person not a resident of the State who has not received a dip=
loma from a chartered=20

medical college must obtain a certificate from a board of censors before he=
 shall be permitted to=20

practise the medical art in the State (_ib._, s. 3,910).  Each board of cen=
sors must issue=20

certificates without fee to physicians and surgeons who furnish evidence by=
 diploma from a=20

medical college or university, or by a certificate of examination by an aut=
horized board, which=20

satisfies said censors that the person presenting such credentials has been=
, after due=20

examination, deemed qualified to practise the branch mentioned in such dipl=
oma or certificate=20

(_ib._, s. 3,911).  The censors in their discretion shall notify the practi=

within thirty days after=20

notification or such further time as is allowed by the censors not exceedin=
g ninety days (_ib._, s.=20

3,912).  The certificate must set forth the branches of the medical art in =
which the person is=20

qualified to practise (_ib._, s. 3,913).  The certificate must be recorded =
in the clerk=E2=80=99s office of the=20

county in which the holder resides, or, if not a resident of the State, in =
the county in which he=20

obtained his certificate (_ib._, s. 3,914).  A certificate issued by a boar=
d of censors is valid=20

throughout the State after being duly recorded. The censors may revoke or a=
nnul a certificate if in=20

their judgment the holder has obtained it fraudulently or has forfeited his=
 right to public confidence=20

by the conviction of crime (_ib._, s. 3,915).  PENALTY.=E2=80=94To practise=
 medicine, surgery, or=20

certificate issued and recorded, is punishable with a fine of from $50 to $=
200 for the first offence,=20

and for subsequent offences with a fine of from $200 to $500, recoverable b=
y an action of debt for=20

the use of any person who sues or by indictment (_ib._, s. 3,916).  No pers=
on practising either of=20

the branches of medicine, surgery, or midwifery is permitted to enforce in =
the courts the collection=20

of a fee or compensation for services rendered or medicine or material furn=
ished in the practice of=20

any of the branches for which he has not a certificate (_ib._, s. 3,917).  =
EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94The law=20

does not apply to the practice of dentistry, nor to the practice of midwife=
ry by women in the town or=20

locality in which they reside, nor to practitioners of medicine who resided=
 and practised medicine=20

in the State for five years previous to November 28th, 1876 (_ib._, s. 3,91=
8).   VIRGINIA.  BOARD=20

OF EXAMINERS.=E2=80=94There is a State board of medical examiners consistin=
g of three members from=20

each congressional district and two from the State at large, and five hom=
=C5=93opathic physicians from=20

the State at large (Code 1887, s. 1,744).  The board is composed of men lea=
rned in medicine and=20

surgery appointed by the governor from a list of names recommended by the M=
edical Society of=20

Virginia, together with five hom=C5=93opathic physicians nominated to him b=
y the Hahnemann Medical=20

Society of the Old Dominion. The recommendations are required to be by vote=
s of a majority=20

present at some meeting of such society; but if the governor considers any =
person so=20

recommended unsuitable he may decline to appoint him, in which case such so=
ciety shall within=20

ninety days after notification make another recommendation, and if the soci=
ety fail to make a=20

recommendation the governor is required to appoint such board in whole or i=
n part without regard=20

to such recommendation. If any examiner cease to reside in the district for=
 which he was=20

appointed his office is deemed vacant (_ib._, s. 1,745).  The regular meeti=
ngs of the board are=20



required to be held at least once a year, and at such=20


_
And even if I did, you see, it would only hurt me with Joe--as it should." =
 So she went on in=20

different moods. And now she saw her sister's face smiling out of clear vio=
let eyes, and again she=20

felt a small gloved hand on her husband drawing him gently back--back and b=
ack into the past.=20

Why was Amy so much stronger now? "Because Fanny Carr has been clever enoug=
h to take me=20

out of the life I was making and pitch me into Amy's life, where her hold o=
n Joe was strongest. I'm=20

in her setting. That's the trouble!"  But she had Amy's friends to dine one=
 night, as in her calmer=20

moods she knew was the only sensible course. And as they began arriving, by=
 swift degrees amid=20

the buzz of talk which rose, Ethel could feel the room each moment change a=
nd become Amy's=20

home. And it was Amy's dinner, too. No cooking of Emily's that night, for J=
oe had suggested a=20

caterer. "The one we've always used," he had said. And so the cocktails and=
 the wines and the=20

food in many courses, the two waiters in evening clothes, and the talk and =
the shrieks of mirth,=20

were just as they must have been before so many, many times in this room. E=
thel sat affably rigid=20

there.  And later at the piano Joe was not Ethel's husband. Nor was it her =
room when they stripped=20

up the rugs and began to dance, nor her photograph their eyes kept seeking =
from time to time!=20

She even thought she could hear them whisper about the hostess who was dead=
!  And when very=20

late they had departed, and last of all Joe had gone with Fanny downstairs =
to put her in her taxi,=20

Ethel, left alone in the room, turned to her sister's photograph.  "I won't=
 be like you," she tensely=20

declared. "I won't live in your home--with your husband--"  The picture smi=
led good-naturedly back=20

"All right," it seemed to answer, "then what do you expect to do?"    CHAPT=
ER XIV  By the next=20

day she had made up her mind to look for another apartment. The move had se=
veral points in its=20

favour. It would not only take her away from this place where she felt the =
spell so strong; it would=20

also give her something to do. "And I need it, heaven knows!" she thought. =
And besides it would=20

provide an excuse for special meetings may be held on the call of the presi=
dent and any five=20

members (_ib._, s. 1,746).  QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94The board at any of its =
meetings must examine all=20

persons making application to them who desire to practise medicine or surge=
ry; when an applicant=20

shall have passed an examination satisfactory as to proficiency before the =
board in session the=20

president must grant a certificate to that effect. If any applicant fail to=
 pass a satisfactory=20

examination before the board he shall not be permitted to stand a further e=
xamination within the=20

next three months, nor shall he be required again to pay the fees prescribe=
d, but no applicant shall=20

be rejected on his examination on account of his adherence to any particula=
r school of medicine or=20

system of practice, nor on account of his views as to the method of treatme=
nt and the cure of=20

disease.  When, in the opinion of the president of the board, the applicant=
 has been prevented by=20

good cause from appearing before the board, he shall appoint a committee of=
 three members who=20

shall examine the applicant and may grant a certificate having the same eff=
ect as though granted=20

by a full board, until the applicant have an opportunity to appear before t=
he board, when, if he fail=20

to appear for examination, the president shall have the authority to revoke=
 said certificate; or in=20

any case the president shall have authority, at his discretion, to grant a =
special permit to any=20

applicant to practise medicine until he shall have an opportunity to appear=
 before the board in=20

session for examination, revokable at the discretion of the president. The =
board has in its=20

discretion authority to accept in lieu of examination a certificate from a =
medical board of any other=20

State, showing that the applicant has passed a satisfactory examination as =
to his proficiency, and=20

obtained a license from said board to practise medicine and surgery in said=
 State (_ib._, s. 1,747,=20



as amended Act 1892, c. 70).  A person obtaining a certificate from the pre=
sident of the board=20

must cause it to be recorded in the clerk=E2=80=99s office of the county or=
 the corporation court, of the=20

county or corporation in=20


_
"I'll be worn out every evening," she decided with grim satisfaction.  She =
found Joe more than=20

ready for the change. He himself had suggested it, some weeks before, and E=
thel made the most=20

of that. "I've been thinking over your idea of moving," she began one night=
. And in the talk which=20

followed, the intent little glances she threw at him made her sure that in =
her husband's mind was a=20

half conscious deep relief at the idea of getting away from or, if he resid=
es in the city of Richmond,=20

in the clerk=E2=80=99s office of the chancery court of the said city (_ib._=
, s. 1,749).  No person who shall=20

have commenced the practice of medicine or surgery since January 1st, 1885,=
 or who shall=20

hereafter commence the practice of the same, shall practise as a physician =
or surgeon for=20

compensation without having obtained a certificate and caused it to be reco=
rded.=20
