acquainted him with the affair, he told them that they should inform themselves whether the rod of 

which they spoke became a serpent while its masters slept, or only when they were awake; for, 

said he, enchantments have no effect while the enchanter is asleep, and therefore if it be 

otherwise in this case, you may be assured that they act by a divine power. These two magicians 

then, arriving at the capital of Egypt, on inquiry found to their great astonishment that when Moses 

and Aaron went to rest their rod became a serpent and guarded them while they slept. And this 

was When the hosts of Peter the Hermit, crazed with religious fanaticism such as the world sees 

but once in a great while, straggled back from their crusade it might have been thought that they 

brought with them nothing but the memory of their sufferings, or the precious memory of those 

holy places they had journeyed so far and endured so much to see. But their crusade had been a 

success; they had won the holy places from the infidel, and after they had achieved their success

feeling, and crusade follows crusade, till we find one that does not even pretend to go to Palestine, 

but devotes itself to the conquest of Constantinople, full of riches and luxuries undreamed of in 

France. When Geoffrey Villehardouin gives a glowing description of the magnificence of 

Constantinople we see that already there is appreciation of things that the first

sent by Pharaoh to seize the true believer, his kinsman, are the persons peace at home, for
