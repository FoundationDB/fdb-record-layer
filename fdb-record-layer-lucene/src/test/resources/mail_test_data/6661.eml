"Don't do it, Ruthie! You'll be lost," cried Helen. "Then whatever should we do?"  "I won't get lost--

not if you girls continue to shout," returned her chum.  She had buttoned her coat about her and 

pulled the skating cap she wore down over her ears, yet not too low to muffle them. Again the cry 

came wandering through the storm. Ruth started down the bank of the gully; the cry came from the 

other side of the hollow, she was sure--almost directly opposite the ledge on which they had taken 

shelter.  When she plunged off the ledge she at once entered the wall of driving, smothering snow. 

It almost took her breath, it was so deep under her feet and shrouded her about so much like a "I 

should like to speak to you on--on the whole subject--some time or other," said the young man. He 

was like a man eager to give a blow, yet so frightened that he ran away in the very act of 

delivering it. Lord Lindores looked at him with suspicious eyes.  "I don't know any reason why you 

shouldn't speak now. It would be well that we should understand each other," he said.  But this 

took away all power from Rintoul. He almost trembled as he stood before his father's too keen--too 

penetrating eyes.  "Oh, don't let me trouble you now," he said, nervously; "and besides, I have 

something to do. Dear me, it is three o'clock!" he cried, looking at his watch and hurrying away. 

But he

ventured this way when first she and her friends had descended to the ledge, Ruth must have 

actually sunk out of sight in the soft drifts.  But the sifting snow had packed harder and harder as 

the storm increased. After all, she sank only to her knees and soon found that she was plunging 

over rather than through the great drifts that filled the gully. How broad this gully was--or how deep 

when the snow was out of it--she could not imagine. Nor did she give a thought to these things 

now.  Again she heard the muffled cry for help; but it sounded louder. She had made no mistake in 

the direction she had taken. The person needing succor was directly in front of the ledge, but 

could not get over to the fire.  She glanced back over her shoulder. The leaping flames she could 

not see; but their glow made a round spot of rosy light against the screen of the falling snow. The 

mystery of the sight terrified her for a moment. Would she ever be able to fight three o'clock. It was 

the time when Nora, escaping from her old lady, came out for a walk; and they had met on several 

occasions, though never by appointment. Nora, for her part, would not have consented to make 

any appointment. Already she began to feel herself in a false position. She was willing to accept 

and keep inviolable the secret with which he had trusted her; but that she herself, a girl full of high-

mindedness and honour, should be his secret too, and carry on a clandestine intercourse which 

nobody knew anything of, was to Nora the last humiliation. She had not written home since it 

happened; for to write home and not to tell her mother of what had happened, would have seemed 

to the girl falsehood. She felt false with Miss Barbara; she had an intolerable sense at once of 

being wronged, and wrong, in the presence of Lady Lindores and Edith. She would no more have 

made an appointment to meet him than she would have told a lie. But poor 


_
ledge?  "Our Father, help me!" was her unspoken prayer, and then she plunged on.  She heard 

the shrill cries of her friends behind; ahead the lost one shouted out once more.  "Here! here! This 

way! Help!"  "I'm coming!" responded Ruth Fielding and, beaten as she was by the gale behind, 

kept steadily on.  The way began to rise before her. She was ascending the other bank of the 

gully. Suddenly through the after all, notwithstanding these high principles of hers, took her walk 

daily along the Lindores road. It was the quietest, the prettiest. She had always liked it better than 

any other--so she said to herself; and naturally Rintoul, who could not go to Dunearn save by that 

way, met her there. She received him, not with any rosy flush of pleasure, but with a blush that 

was hot and angry, resolving that 


_
she saw something waving. She sprang forward with renewed courage, crying again:  "I'm 

coming!"  The next moment she seized somebody's gloved hand. "Oh, oh!" cried a shrill, terrified 

voice. "Who are you? Help me! I am freezing. can't walk--"  "Fred Hatfield!" gasped the amazed 

girl. "Is it you? What is the matter?"  "Take me to that house. I see the light, but I cannot reach it 

Help me, for God's sake!" cried the boy.  She could see his white, pinched face as he lay there 

more than half buried in the snow. His eyes were feverish and wild and he certainly did not know 

Ruth.  "Help me out! help me out!" he continued to beg. "My leg is caught."  But it was more 

weakness and exhaustion than aught else that held the boy in the drift, as Ruth very soon found 

out when she laid hold of his shoulders and exerted her strength. In a few moments, what with her 

pulling and his scrambling, the boy was out of the her steps in a different direction, and that this 

should not occur again; and she did not even give him her hand when they met, as she would 

have done to the doctor or the minister, or any one of the ordinary passers-by.  "You are angry 

with me, Nora," he said.  "I don't know that I have any right to be angry. We have very little to do 

with each other, Lord Rintoul."  "Nora!" he cried; "Nora! do you want to break my heart. What is 

this? It is not so very long since!----"  "It is long enough," she said, "to let me see----It is better that 

we should not say anything more about that. One is a fool--one is taken by surprise--one does not 

think what it means----"  "Do you imagine I will let myself be thrown off like this?" he cried, with 

great agitation. "Nora, why should you despise me so--all for the sake of old Rolls?"  "It is not all 

for the sake of old Rolls."  "I will go and see him, if you like,

He had clung to the rifle--Tom Cameron's weapon, of course--and into his belt was stuck a knife 

and a camp hatchet.  "Why, how did you get here in this storm?" demanded Ruth, as he lay 

panting at her feet.  "I got lost--from my--my camp," he what he means. It is his own doing, it is not 

my doing. You know I was more surprised than any one. Nora, think! If you only think, you will see 

that you are unreasonable. How could I stand up and contradict a man who had accused himself?" 

"I was not 


_
feel my feet at all--"  "Come across to the fire," urged Ruth. "We girls are lost from Snow Camp. 

But we're all right so far. My! how the snow blows."  Facing the storm they could hardly make 

headway at all. Indeed, the youth fell within a few yards and Ruth was obliged to drag him through 

the drifts.  Her friends continued to shout, and occasionally she stood this flood of eloquence in 

vain. "I was thinking of----Lord Rintoul, I am not a person of rank like you--I don't know what lords 

and ladies think it right to do--but I will not have clandestine meetings with any one. If a man wants 

me, if he were a prince, he must ask my father,--he must do it in the eye of day, not as if he were 

ashamed. Good-bye! do not expect me
