Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of _
geometrical length of the fork (_i. e._, from the pallet center to the beginning of the horn), and 

which at the moment is a resistance lever, to be utilized in unlocking the pallets. After the pallets 

are unlocked the conditions are reversed, and we now find the lever fork, through the pallets, 

transmitting power to the balance by means of the impulse radius. In the first part of the action we 

have a short lever engaging a longer one, which is an advantage. See Fig. 14, where we have 

purposely somewhat exaggerated the conditions. A'X represents the impulse radius at present 

under discussion, and AW the acting length of the fork. It will be seen that the shorter the impulse 

radius, or in other words, the closer the ruby pin is to the balance staff and the longer the fork, the 

easier will the unlocking of the pallets be performed, but this entails a great impulse angle, for the 

law applicable to the case is, that the angles are in the inverse ratio to the radii. In other words, the 

shorter the radius, the greater is the angle, and the smaller the angle the greater is the radius. We 

know, though, that we must have as small an impulse angle as possible in order that the balance 

should be highly detached. Here is one point in favor of a short impulse radius, and one against it. 

Now, let us turn to the impulse action. Here we have the long lever AW acting on a short one, A'X, 

which is a disadvantage. Here, then, we ought to try and have a short lever acting on a long one, 

which would point to a short fork and a great impulse radius. Suppose AP, Fig. 14, is the length of 

fork, and A'P is the impulse radius; here, then, we favor the impulse, and it is directly in 

accordance with the theory of the free vibration of the balance, for, as before stated, the longer the 

radius the smaller the angle. The action at P is also closer to the line of centers than it is at W, 

which is another advantage.  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]  We will notice that by employing a large 

impulse angle, and consequently a short radius, the intersection _m_ of the two circles _ii_ and 

_cc_ is very _safe_, whereas, with the conditions reversed in favor of the impulse action, the 

intersection at _k_ is more delicate. We have now seen enough to appreciate the fact that we 

favor one action at the expense of another.  By having a lifting angle on pallet and tooth of 8 

1/2deg., a locking angle of 1 1/2deg., and a run of 1/2deg., we will have an angular movement of 

the fork of 8 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1/2 = 10 1/2deg.  [Illustration: Fig. 15.]  Writers generally only consider 

the movement of the fork from drop to drop on the pallets, but we will be thoroughly practical in the 

matter. With a total motion of the fork of 10 1/2deg. (JAW, Fig. 15), one-half, or 5 1/4deg. will be 

performed on each side of the line of centers. We are at liberty to choose any impulse angle which 

we may prefer; 3 to 1 is a good proportion for an ordinary well-made watch. By employing it, the 

angle XA'Y would be equal to 31 1/2deg. The radius A'X Fig. 16, is also of the same proportion, 

but the angle AA'X is greater because the fork angle WAA' is greater than the same angle in Fig. 

15. We will notice that the intersection _k_ is much smaller in Fig. 15 than in Fig. 16. The action in 

the latter begins much further from the line of centers than in the former and outlines an action 

which should not be made.  [Illustration: Fig. 16.]  To come back to the impulse angle, some might 

use a proportion of 3.5, 4 or even 5 to 1, while others for the finest of watches would only use 2.75 

to 1. By having a total vibration of the balance of 1 1/2 turns, which is equal to 540deg. a fork 

angle of 10deg. and a proportion of 2.75 for mietiskellyt, selvi hnelle nyt, kun maantienpolveke on 

jnyt. Hn oli kysynyt itseltn uudelleen ja yh uudelleen: oliko hn saavuttava onnen etelss? Nyt hn 

saattoi siihen vastata ja vastaus oli kieltv. Etsijn ikv jatkuisi. Nuo skeiset pikkupojat olivat auttaneet 

hnt selvyyteen.  Mutta -- samalla kuin tm hnelle selvisi, selvisi hnelle toinenkin asia suurena ja 

vapauttavana. Se oli hivhdellyt hnen mielessn hnen palatessaan kerran Huomenjrvelt Horstan 



kanssa. Se oli soinut sydmess kuin outo kello lytmtt oikeaa kaikupohjaa: -- hn oli viel silloin liian 

kiihkesti kaivannut eteln. Hn oli aavistellut sit hyvstijttsunnuntaina kirkosta palatessaan. Nyt hn sen 

ksitti tydellisesti.  Hnen kaipauksensa eteln oli vain osa siit ikuisesta kaipauksesta, jonka Jumala 

kerran istutti ihmislapsen poveen pakottaakseen hnt etsimn ja pyrkimn eteenpin, siit huolimatta ett 

pmr usein nytti saavuttamattomalta. Ja tm kaipaus oli kaikkialla sama. Siit johtui, ett ihmiselo 

pohjaltaan muodostui samanlaiseksi niin Lapissa kuin etelsskin: alituiseksi pyrkimiseksi, etsinnksi 

ja ikvksi. Mutta siin juuri oli ihmiselon kauneus ja onni. Onnellinen oli vain se, joka tyytyi etsimn ja 

kaipaamaan, vaikk'ei sitten koskaan saavuttaisikaan ikuista valoa. Mutta -- ehk kuolemassa kaikki 

selviisi? Ehk silloin avautuisi etsineen silmlle ikuinen kirkkaus?  Kuin vastaukseksi nihin Jonatan 

Starkin mietteisiin levisi samassa seudun yli omituinen, kullanhohtoinen valo. Taivaankansi iknkuin 

aukeni ja aukeamasta steili alas ihmeellinen, salaperinen kirkkaus leviten hangille maantien 

molemmin puolin. Se oli kuin avattu tie, hohtava, vlkhtelev pohjoisesta eteln. Sit kesti vain tuokion. 

Taivaankansi sulkeutui jlleen. Mutta edesspin hmittvn metsnreunan ylpuolella tuikki iltathti kuin 

kehoittaen jatkuvaan etsintn ja ponnisteluun.  "Kaukainen onni", ajatteli Jonatan Stark, mutta hn 

ajatteli sen kohtaloonsa alistuen, joskin hiukan surumielisen, niin kuitenkin tyynen ja lujana.

impulse angle which would be equal to 10 x 2.75 = 27.5deg. The _free_ vibration of the balance, 

or as this is called, "the supplemental arc," is equal to 540deg. - 27.5deg. = 512.50deg., while with 

a proportion of 5 to 1, making an impulse angle of 50deg., it would be equal to 490deg. To sum 

up, the finer the watch the lower the proportion, the closer the action to the line of centers, the 

smaller the friction. On account of leverage the more difficult the unlocking but the more energetic 

the impulse when it does occur. The velocity of the ruby pin at P; Fig. 14, is much greater than at 

W, consequently it will not be overtaken as soon by the fork as at W. The velocity of the fork at the

greater than at P; the intersection of _ii_ and _cc_ is also not as great; therefore the lower the 

proportion the finer and more exact must the workmanship be.  We will notice that the unlocking 

action has been overruled by the impulse. The only point so far in which the former has been 

favored is in the diminished action before the line of centers, as previously pointed out at P, Fig.

into the question, we will study Fig. 17. A is the pallet center, A' the balance center, the line AA' 

being the line of centers; the angle WAA equals half the total motion of the fork, the other half, of 

course, taking place on the opposite side of the center line. WA is the _center_ of the fork when it 

rests against the bank. The angle AA'X represents half the impulse angle; the other half, the same 

as with the fork, is struck on the other side of the center line. At the point of intersection of these 

angles we will draw _cc_ from the pallet center A, which equals the acting length of the fork, and 

from the balance center we will draw _ii_, which equals the _theoretical_ impulse radius; some 

writers use it as the _real_ radius. The wider the ruby things that you can do with most Project

will the latter be, which we will explain presently.  The ruby pin in entering the fork must have a 

certain amount of freedom for action, from 1 to 1 1/4deg. Should the watch receive a jar at the 

moment the guard point enters the crescent or passing hollow in the roller, the fork would fly 

against the ruby pin. It is important that the angular freedom between the fork and ruby pin at the 

moment it enters into the slot be _less_ than the total locking angle on the pallets. If we employ a 

locking angle of 1 1/2deg. and 1/2deg. run, we would have a total lock on the pallets of 2deg. By 

allowing 1 1/4deg. of freedom for the ruby pin at the moment the claim a right to prevent you from
