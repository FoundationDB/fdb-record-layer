_Ibid_., p. 66.]  [Footnote 7: _Niles Register_, vol. xvi., pp. 165-166.]  Bishop Meade was a 

representative of certain of his fellow-churchmen who were passing through the transitory stage 

from the position of advocating the thorough education of Negroes to that of recommending mere 

verbal instruction. Agreeing at first with Rev. Thomas Bacon, Bishop Meade favored the literary 

training of Negroes, and advocated the extermination of slavery.[1] Later in life he failed to urge 

his followers to emancipate their slaves, and did not entreat his congregation to teach them to 

read. He was then committed to the policy of only lessening their burden as much as possible 

without doing anything to destroy the institution. Thereafter he advocated the education and 

emancipation of the slaves only in connection with the scheme of colonization, to which he looked 

for a solution of these problems.[2]  [Footnote 1: Meade,_Sermons of Rev. Thos. Bacon_, p. 2; 

and Goodell, _The Southern Platform_, pp. 64, 65.]  [Footnote 2:_Ibid_., p. 65.]  Wishing to give 

his views on the religious instruction of Negroes, the Bishop found in Rev. Thomas Bacon's 

sermons that "every argument which was likely to convince and persuade was so forcibly exerted, 

and that every objection that could possibly be made, so fully answered, and in fine everything that 

ought to be said so well said, and the same things so happily confirmed ..." that it was deemed 

"best to refer the reader for the true nature and    A terrible nightmare on throat and brain--   A 

body and soul in bewilder'd strife--   Shall I never be quite alive again?--   I'll make a desperate 

struggle for life!    I catch at his arm as he passes by,   As a drowning creature clutches at life; 

And I whisper low as a lullaby--   'Give him me _instantly_--I am his wife!'    He stares in my face 

with nothing to say--   A tremor comes over his brow and lip--   He flings up his arms in a helpless 

way,   And stammers--'Alas! he's on board the ship!'       I am not fainting--I am not appall'd--   I am 

not beat down--I feel no despair:   It seems all expected and all forestall'd,   As I utter my three 

words, 'When and where?'    'Two hours ago at the Northern quay'--   He offers me food, and to 

rest and sit--   I have left the house--I am on my way--   I have hail'd a cab and jump'd into it.    O 

faster! O faster! O yet more fast!   There's nothing on earth but driving like this:   I _know_ it will all 

come right at the last,   But I am not certain what the right is.    There is a river and there is a boat 

(I read it all in a far-away tale)--   O faster! O faster! you do but float;   Pull away with your oars, 

shake out your sail!    A woman, I know, must sail in a skiff,   And reach a ship ere it reaches the 

sea;   But it _is_ a wonderful matter if   The woman who sits here is really me!    O faster! O faster! 

you scarcely stir--   The ship has grown large that was but a speck!   We have reached the ship--

we have boarded her--   And I SEE who is standing on her deck!    I see who stands there, I hear 

and see   His incredulous joy and startled cry,   His beautiful wonder at sight of me;   I feel his 

embraces, and then--I die!     PART IV.     I know not how long I was lying dead;   I know not

itself."[1] Bishop Meade had uppermost in his mind Bacon's logical arraignment of those who 

neglected to teach their Negroes the Christian religion. Looking beyond the narrow circle of his 

own sect, the bishop invited the attention of all denominations to this subject in which they were 

"equally concerned." He especially besought "the   But I know whose breast supported my head; 

I know in whose arms I passively lay.    I know whose voice I was hearing again;   With no vivid 

emotion through me sent,   But only with that sweet absence of pain   The young call repose, and 

the old, content.    I know of the presence that o'er me shed   Through all that I suffer'd a

matter for which they also will have to give an account. Did not Christ," said he, "die for these poor 

creatures as well as for any other, and is it not given in charge of the minister to gather his sheep 

into the fold?"[2]  [Footnote 1: Meade, _Sermons of Rev. Thos. Bacon_, pp. 31,32, 81, 90, 93, 95, 

104, and 105.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 104.]  Another worker in this field was Bishop William 

Capers of the Methodist Episcopal Church of South Carolina. A southerner to the manner born, he 

did not share the zeal of the antislavery men who would educate Negroes as a preparation for 

manumission.[1] Regarding the subject of abolition as one belonging to the State and entirely 

inappropriate to the Church, he denounced the principles of the religious abolitionists as 

originating in false philosophy. Capers endeavored to prove that the relation of slave and master is 

authorized by the Holy Scriptures. He was of the opinion, however, that certain abuses which 

might ensue, were immoralities to be prevented or punished by all proper means, both by the 

Church discipline and the civil law.[2] Believing that the neglect of the spiritual needs of the slaves 

was a reflection on the slaveholders, he set out early in the thirties to stir up South Carolina to the 

duty of removing this stigma.  [Footnote 1: Wightman, _Life of William Capers_, p. 295.]  [Footnote 

2: Wightman, _Life of William Capers_, p. 296.]  His plan of enlightening the blacks   I know all this 

because I am dead--   I suppose the dead can know what they please!    Can I be dead? It is 

foolish to die,   Earth shining brighter than any bright star.   Death, do you _know_ it is Harry and 

I?   Heaven is here--must I seek it afar?    Death, seize thy prey from the world-weary track;   Let 

not the happy by thee be remov'd;   Slowly and softly and sweetly come back,   Life that she loves 

to a girl that is lov'd!           *       *       *       *       *    Cut through the waves, happy ship 'neath my 

feet;   Scatter thy prow with beneficent spray!   Never an admiral leading a fleet   Felt as 

triumphant as I do to-day!    Ocean around us, and Heaven above;   Hands clasp'd together in 

innocent bliss;   Heart meeting heart with the fulness of love--   Can there be anything sweeter 

than this?    Seeking a home on a far-distant shore,   Mid gigantic forests and splendid flow'rs, 

Where sorrow cannot bewilder us more,   Or fear reach a solitude perfect as ours.    Crossing blue 

oceans 'neath heavens as blue,   Seeking new worlds with new winters and springs;   Even the old 

stars are changing to new,   Lovely confusion of wonderful things!    Almost forgetting to feel a 

regret--   Almost forgotten the world whence we came--   Only our hearts, Harry, cannot forget; 

Only our love will be ever the same!    Talking together through nights and through days;   Talking 

together through days and through nights;

instruction. His aim was to adapt the teaching of Christian truth to the condition of persons having 

a "humble intellect and a limited range of knowledge by means of constant and patient 

reiteration."[1] The old Negroes were to look to preachers for the exposition of these principles 

while the children were to be turned over to catechists who would avail themselves of the 

opportunity of imparting these fundamentals to the young at the time their minds were in the 

plastic state. Yet all instructors and preachers to Negroes had to be careful to inculcate the 

performance of the duty of obedience to their masters as southerners found them stated in the 

Holy Scriptures. Any one who would hesitate to teach these principles of southern religion should 

not be employed to instruct slaves. The bishop was certain that such a one could not then be 

found among the preachers of the Methodist Episcopal Church of South Carolina.[2]  [Footnote 1: 

_Ibid._, p. 298.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid._, p. 296.]  Bishop Capers was the leading spirit in the 

movement instituted in that commonwealth about 1829 to establish missions to the slaves. So 

generally did he arouse the people to the performance of this duty that they not only allowed 

preachers access to their Negroes but requested that missionaries be sent to their plantations. 

Such petitions came from C.C. Pinckney, Charles Boring, and Lewis Morris.[1] Two stations were 

established in 1829 and two additional ones in 1833. Thereafter the Church founded one or two 

others every year until 1847 when there were seventeen missions conducted by twenty-five 

preachers. At the death of Bishop   Piercing its shadows with delicate lights.    Forward our 

glances immutably cast   (Pillars of salt will not garnish our way!)   Just for the present forgetting 

the past,   Planning the future in all that we say.    Where neither sorrow nor sin has beguil'd, 

Deep in a forest, a home will be made;   Nature contrasting with hand undefil'd   Novel creations of 

sunlight and shade.    Softness and grandeur enchantingly blent,   Deep in a forest two lives pass 

away;   Wrapp'd in each other, supremely content,   Lighted by love's irrefrangible ray.       So the 

ship flew on that contain'd us two,   With ocean around and heaven above;   It seem'd there was 

nothing for us to do   But to love and live, and to live and love.    So the ship flew on to the sinless 

shore,   Where a younger world from the deep sea starts;   Where sorrow cannot bewilder us 

more,   Or fear lay her cold hand over our hearts.       It is just as lovely as what we plann'd,   With 

its exquisite air of bright repose;   And 'tis Harry himself must till the land,   And 'tis I must sweep 

and cook, I suppose!    Is it playing at life, this life of ours?   Has childhood come back with its 

pleasant plays?   Mid gigantic trees and delicious flow'rs   We are passing our happy nights and 

days.    But the little cloud--O the little cloud--   So little at first it might almost please--   That 

covers us up like a dead man's shroud,   Growing bigger and bigger by degrees.    Alas! is it only 

in some bright past   That love can be perfect and bliss secure?   O days of delight that flew by too 

fast,   Leaving the present too empty and poor!    I had

Methodists of South Carolina had twenty-six such establishments, which employed thirty-two 

preachers, ministering to 11,546 communicants of color. The missionary revenue raised by the 

local conference had increased from $300 to $25,000 a year.[2]  [Footnote 1: Wightman, _Life of 

William Capers_, p. 296.]  [Footnote 2; _African Repository_, vol. xxiv., p. 157.]  The most striking 

example of this class of workers was the   From a passing tone, or a look in his face;   But the 

meeting was such unclouded bliss,   And the days that follow'd it full of grace.    In the sweet 

content of finding a home,   There was not leisure for joy to grow dim;   But the cloud was there, 

and ready to come,   And the cloud was the fear of change in _him_!       Harry is changed--he is 

graver,--I think   Never I'll see the old Harry again:   There's a look in

Jones, a minister of the Presbyterian Church. Educated at Princeton with men actually interested 

in the cause of the Negroes, and located in Georgia where he could study the situation as it was, 

Jones became not a theorist but a worker. He did not share the discussion of the question as to 

how to get rid of slavery. Accepting the institution as a fact, he endeavored to alleviate the 

sufferings of the unfortunates by the spiritual cultivation of their minds. He aimed, too, not to   For 

it is a look of a hopeless pain.    Sometimes I hardly can keep down my cries--   I could wring my 

hands--I could tear my hair--   When an expression comes into his eyes,   Which is the expression 

of a despair.    He never alludes to the dreadful past;   But when his lips tremble and brow is knit, 

I cannot bear it, and cry out at last,   'O talk of it, Harry--O talk of _it_!'    His eyes are full of a 

helpless regret   (And I almost wish I was lying dead);   Will he not talk

to a special class of slaves, those of the plantations who were left in the depths of ignorance as to 

the benefits of right living. In this respect he was like two of his contemporaries, Rev. Josiah 

Law[1] of Georgia and Bishop Polk of Louisiana.[2] Denouncing the policy of getting all one could 

out of the slaves and of giving back as little as possible, Jones   He speaks in a whisper, and 

shakes his head.    'I cannot--I dare not.' 'You can--you dare--   You must do it, Harry--just for my 

sake;   For this burthen, which it is _not_ to bear,   Is crushing my heart, and my heart will break.' 

He kisses my lips--he presses my hand--   Looking straight in my face without surprise;   But it 

seems that he _cannot_ understand,
