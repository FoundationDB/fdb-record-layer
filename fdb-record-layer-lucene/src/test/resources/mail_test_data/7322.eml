put forth that on our slackest evening in the week, and at our slackest time of that evening betwixt 

trains, Our Missis would give her views of foreign Refreshmenting, in the Bandolining Room.  It 

was arranged tasteful for the purpose.  The Bandolining table and glass was hid in a corner, a 

arm-chair was elevated on a packing-case for Our Missis's ockypation, a table and a tumbler of 

water (no sherry in it, thankee) was placed beside it.  Two of the pupils,

those flowers.  On one might be read, "MAY ALBION NEVER LEARN;" on another, "KEEP THE 

PUBLIC DOWN;" on another, "OUR REFRESHMENTING CHARTER."  The whole had a beautiful 

appearance, with which the beauty of the sentiments corresponded.  On Our Missis's brow was 

wrote Severity, as she ascended the fatal platform.  (Not that that was anythink new.)  Miss Whiff 

and Miss Piff sat at her feet.  Three chairs from the Waiting Room might have been perceived by a 

average eye, in front of her, on which the pupils was accommodated.  Behind them, a very close 

observer might have discerned a Boy.  Myself.  "Where," said Our Missis, glancing gloomily 

around, "is Sniff?"  "I thought it better," answered Mrs. Sniff, "that he should not be let to come in. 

He is such an Ass."  "No doubt," assented Our Missis.  "But for that reason is it not desirable to 

improve his mind?"  "O!  Nothing will ever improve _him_," said Mrs. Sniff.  "However," pursued 

Our Missis, "call him in, Ezekiel."  I called him in.  The appearance of the low-minded cove was 

hailed with disapprobation from all sides, on account of his having brought his corkscrew with him. 

He pleaded "the force of habit."

"Don't let us have you talking about force, for Gracious sake.  There!  Do stand still where you are, 

with your back against the wall."  He is a smiling piece of vacancy, and he smiled in the mean way 

in which he will even smile at the public if he gets a chance (language can say no meaner of him), 

and he stood upright near the door with the back of his head agin the wall, as if he was a waiting 

for somebody to come and measure his heighth for the Army.  "I should not enter, ladies," says 

Our Missis, "on the revolting disclosures I am about to make, if it was not in the hope that they will
