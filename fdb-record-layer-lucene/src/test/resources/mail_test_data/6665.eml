dracaena marginata uniformly united. Its component parts, we are told, are =
almost identical with those of the Pineal Gland; yet not the slightest conn=
ection can be traced between the two centres. To this, however, Occultists =
take exception; they _know_ that there is a connection, and this even anato=
mically and physically. Dissectors, on so strange a commission!"  The irony=
 with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal.  "Pardon,=
 madame," he said, "I am not a lawyer, I am a mere soldier, and probably, t=
herefore, I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words; I ought to =

Physicians, Physiologists, Anatomists, etc., will understand me better than=

may, you may, sir," said the queen with a bitter smile; "you were not so ti=

chancellor reddened and stammered some words.  "It is not a question of the=
 past, but of the=20

present," said the queen; "you said you could give me advice--what is it?" =

_
Now, as to the functions of the Pineal Gland, or Conarium, and of the Pitui=
tary Body, we find no=20

explanations vouchsafed by the standard authorities. Indeed, on looking thr=
ough the works of the=20

greatest specialists, it is curious to observe how much confused ignorance =
on the human vital=20

economy, physiological as well as psychological, is openly confessed. The f=
ollowing is all that can=20

be gleaned from the authorities upon these two important organs.  (1) The P=
ineal Gland, or=20

Conarium, is a rounded, oblong body, from three to four lines long, of a de=
ep reddish grey,=20

connected with the posterior part of the third ventricle of the brain. It i=
s attached at its base by two=20

thin medullary cords, which diverge forward to the Optic Thalami. Remember =
that the Broussel."=20

The queen, although already pale, became visibly paler and her face was con=
tracted.  "Release=20

Broussel!" she cried, "never!"  At this moment steps were heard in the ante=
-room and without any=20

announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door.  "Ah, ther=
e you are, marechal,"=20

cried Anne of Austria joyfully. "I trust you have brought this rabble to re=
ason."  "Madame," replied=20

the marechal, "I have left three men on the Pont Neuf, four at the Halle, s=
ix at the corner of the=20

Rue de l'Arbre-Sec and two at the door of your palace--fifteen in all. I ha=
ve brought away ten or=20

twelve wounded. I know not where I have left my hat, and in all probability=
 I should have been left=20

with my hat, had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me."=20


_
organs of reception and condensation of the most sensitive and sensorial in=
citations from the=20

periphery of the body (according to Occultism, from the periphery of the Au=
ric Egg, which is our=20

point of communication with the higher, universal planes). We are further t=
old that the two bands of=20

the Optic Thalami, which are inflected to meet each other, unite on the med=
ian line, where they=20

become the two peduncles of the Pineal Gland.  (2) The Pituitary Body, or H=
ypophysis Cerebri, is=20

a small and hard organ, about six lines broad, three long and three high. I=
t is formed of an anterior=20

bean-shaped, and of a posterior and low cur, with his distorted legs, had n=
ot been mixed up with=20

all this."  "Madame," said La Meilleraie, "do not say too much against him =
before me, for the=20

service he rendered me is still fresh."  "Very good," said the queen, "be a=
s grateful as you like, it=20

does not implicate me; you are here safe and sound, that is all I wished fo=
r; you are not only=20

welcome, but welcome back."  "Yes, madame; but I only came back on one cond=
ition--that I would=20

transmit to your majesty the will of the people."  "The will!" exclaimed th=
e queen, frowning. "Oh!=20

oh! monsieur marechal, you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peri=
