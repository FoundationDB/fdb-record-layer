philodendron monstera year, 1917, a course of lectures on Legal Ethics, which he continues.  I now go back to my own time at the Law School. There was a small Jersey group there. Nehemiah Perry, Henry Young, Job H. Plum, and is so called by the Gardeners. These two have a Flesh and Juice much like one another, and make a fine Shew in a Dish by way of Desert; but are in my Opinion only fit for stewing. philodendron monstera year, 1917, a course of lectures on Legal Ethics, which he continues.

examinations, so that it was possible for a student to receive his degree after a year and a half of 

residence without learning any law. Such a system might do for very zealous and ambitious 

students, but not for a large class. That the School held up its head as long as it did was due to 

two things: the _genius loci_, which counted for a good deal, and the personal influence and 

example of the professors, who were superior men.  I write with the reserve proper to one who is 

fill them with the above-mention'd Marmalade of Peaches, and serve them.    _Apricots_ preserv'd 

for Tarts. From the same.  Take Apricots of the largest kind, When they begin to turn to Ripeness, 

pare them and discharge them from the Stones. Cut them in Halves, and stew them with a little 

Water, and their weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Boil these gently over a clear Charcoal Fire, till the 

Liquor becomes of the Consistence of a Jelly, and the Apricots are clear. Then when they are

policy of which he has had no personal experience, but it seems to me that, in the last analysis, 

Professor Langdell's new idea was this: to rouse, develop, discipline and cultivate the judgment, 

and so, as far as possible, to equip each student with that valuable attribute, easily recognized but 

hard to define or describe, which is called a legal mind. It is judgment that does it. A mechanic of 

good judgment is already half a lawyer; an attorney of poor judgment will always remain in the 

apprentice class.  I am reminded how I first saw Langdell's name. After I left the Law School I was 

for a time a member of the New York Bar. As I went upstairs to my Tarts, put them in Coffins of 

sweet Paste, and cover them, and put them in the Oven, till they are hot through. Then serve them 

with double-refined Sugar grated over them. These may be either serv'd hot or cold. The Jelly of 

this kind, in the Glasses, may be serv'd as a Sweetmeat in a Desert.  _Memorandum,_ If, when 

these Fruits are ripe, you can have any Apples near ripe, pare them, and slice them free from the 

Core, and stew them in as much Water as will cover them, and their weight in fine Sugar, till by 

boiling and stirring, the whole becomes of a Jelly; then in this, when it is clear, stew your Apricots, 

or Peaches, till they are what you desire.

the next flight, the sign of a law firm, Pierrepont, Stanley & Langdell. I knew about Pierrepont, who 

was a Yale man of the class of 1837, and I somehow got the idea, perhaps unjust to Mr. 

Pierrepont, that one of the junior partners was an erudite man who acted as purveyor of legal 

ideas to the head of the firm, somewhat as Sydney Carton did for Mr. Stryver in "A Tale of Two 

Cities." The selection of Mr. Langdell as a professor was due to the sagacity of President Eliot.  An 

interesting and valuable part of the History is a biographical list of the ninety-one men who were 

teachers in the School during the century covered by the book. One of the names is that of Justice 

Francis J. Swayze, of additional Taste.    Plums to make _Marmalade _of. From the same.  There 

are several sorts of Plums, which are fit for this use. And though they differ in colour, that is, some 

red and some white, yet the Marmalade made of any of them will be white, for the Colour is only in 

the Skin; and that if it was to be used, could give no Tincture; but in our Case, we do not want it. 

The Sorts are either the _Bonum Magnum_, as it is call'd, which is a large, long, red Plum, with a 

Pulp very tender, but sour, when it is raw from the Tree. Another is a large Plum, rather yellowish 

than white, when it is ripe, and of the former Shape, like an Egg, which is called by some the Egg-

Plum; but more
