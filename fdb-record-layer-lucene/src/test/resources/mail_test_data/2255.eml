OSWALD. Well, you may take their word for it. They know what they are talki=

should be defiled in such a=20

 OSWALD. Yes;=20

you're quite right, mother. It's bad for me, I know. You see, I'm wretchedl=

Pastor Manders. But I have never dared to say anything. Well! now my boy sh=
all speak for me.=20

MANDERS. You are greatly to be pitied, Mrs. Alving. But now I must speak se=
riously to you. And=20

now it is no longer your business manager and adviser, your own and your hu=
sband's early friend,=20

who stands before you. It is the priest--the priest who stood before you in=
 the moment of your life=20

when you had gone farthest astray.  MRS. ALVING. And what has the priest to=
 say to me?=20

MANDERS. I will first stir up your memory a little. The moment is well chos=
en. To-morrow will be=20

the tenth anniversary of your husband's death. To-morrow the memorial in hi=
s honour will be=20

unveiled. To-morrow I shall have to speak to the whole assembled multitude.=
 But to-day I will=20

speak to you alone.  MRS. ALVING. Very well, Pastor Manders. Speak.  MANDER=
S. Do you=20

remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge=
 of an abyss? That you=20

forsook your house and home? That you fled from your husband? Yes, Mrs. Alv=
ing--fled, fled, and=20

refused to return to him, however much he begged and prayed you?  MRS. ALVI=
NG. Have you=20

forgotten how infinitely miserable I was in that first year?  MANDERS. It i=
s the very mark of the=20

spirit of rebellion to crave for happiness in this life. What right have we=
 human beings to=20

happiness? We have simply to do our duty, Mrs. Alving! And your duty was to=
 hold firmly to the=20

man you had once chosen, and to whom you were bound by the holiest ties.  M=
RS. ALVING. You=20

know very well what sort of life Alving was leading--what excesses he was g=
uilty of.  MANDERS. I=20

know very well what rumours there were about him; and I am the last to appr=
ove the life he led in=20

his young days, if report did not wrong him. But a wife is not appointed to=
 be her husband's judge.=20

It was your duty to bear with humility the cross which a Higher Power had, =
in its wisdom, laid upon=20

you. But column had been nearing the Potomac, A.=C2=A0P. Hill, who had rema=
ined at Fredericksburg to=20

watch Hooker, as yet inactive on Stafford Heights, broke camp and followed =
northwestward. Ewell=20

seized Chambersburg a few days later, then appeared at Carlisle, and even s=
hook Harrisburg with=20

his cannon. The North had, indeed, cause for alarm; the farmers of the inva=
ded region were in a=20

panic. =E2=80=9CEmergency men,=E2=80=9D enlisted for three months, gathered=
 from New York, Ohio, West Virginia,=20

and Pennsylvania to the threatened points. The great coast cities were face=
 to face with a menace=20

hitherto unexperienced. Were they really about to be sacked? What was to be=
 done?  There was=20

no indecision either at Washington or in the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln=
=E2=80=99s horse-sense,=20

sometimes tripping, but oftener adequate to deal with unparalleled burdens,=
 homely, terse, and=20

unerring in its expression, was at its best in these days. To Hooker, medit=
ating movements along=20

and across the Rappahannock, he wrote: =E2=80=9CI would not take any risk o=
f being entangled upon the=20



river like an ox jumped half over a fence, and liable to be torn by dogs in=
 front and rear without a=20

fair chance to gore one way or kick the other.=E2=80=9D[245] And again: =E2=
=80=9CIf the head of Lee=E2=80=99s army is at=20

Martinsburg (near the Potomac), and the tail of it on the plank-road betwee=
n Fredericksburg and=20

Chancellorsville, the animal must be very slim somewhere. Could you not bre=
ak him?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CFret him=20

and fret him,=E2=80=9D was the President=E2=80=99s injunction to Hooker, re=
garding the advance of Lee. Well-poised,=20

good-humored, constant, Lincoln gave no counsel to Hooker in these days tha=
t was not sound.=20

Indeed, at this time, Hooker needed little admonition. Alert and resourcefu=
l, he no sooner detected=20

the movement of Lee than he suggested an advance upon Richmond, which was t=
hus left=20

unguarded. Lee, of course, had contemplated the possibility of such a move,=
 and, with a nod=20

toward Washington, had joked about =E2=80=9Cswapping queens.=E2=80=9D The i=
dea, which Hooker did not press,=20

being disapproved, Hooker, turning toward Lee, proceeded to =E2=80=9Cfret h=
im and fret him,=E2=80=9D his conduct=20

comparing well with his brilliant management at the opening of the campaign=
 of Chancellorsville.=20

The cavalry, greatly improved by him, under Pleasonton, with divisions comm=
anded by Buford,=20

Duffie, and Gregg, was serviceable as never before, matching well the troop=
ers of Stuart at=20

Brandy Station, Aldie, and Middleburg. Screened on his left flank by his ca=
valry, as, on the other=20

hand, Lee was screened by a similar body on his right, Hooker marched in co=
lumns parallel to=20

those of his foe and farther east, yet always interposing between the enemy=
 and Washington. As=20

June drew to its end the Confederate advance was near Harrisburg, but the F=
ederals were not=20

caught napping. Hooker stood at Frederick, in Maryland, his corps stretched=
 on either hand to=20

cover Washington and Baltimore, touching hands one with the other, and all =
confronting the foe.=20

*       *=20


_
away the cross, desert the backslider whom you should have supported, go an=
d risk your good=20

name and reputation, and--nearly succeed in ruining other people's reputati=
on into the bargain.=20

MRS. ALVING. Other people's? One other person's, you mean.  MANDERS. It was=
 incredibly=20

reckless of you to seek refuge with me.  MRS. ALVING. With our clergyman? W=
ith our intimate=20

friend?  MANDERS. Just on that account. Yes, you may thank God that I posse=
ssed the=20

necessary firmness; that I succeeded in dissuading you from your wild desig=
ns; and that it was=20

vouchsafed me to lead you back to the path of duty, and home to your lawful=
 husband.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Yes, Pastor Manders, that was certainly your work.  MANDERS. I was =
but a poor=20

instrument in a Higher Hand. And what a blessing has it not proved to you, =
all the days of your life,=20

that I induced you to resume the yoke of duty and obedience! Did not everyt=
hing happen as I=20

foretold? Did not Alving turn his back on his errors, as a man should? Did =
he not live with you from=20

that time, lovingly and blamelessly, all his days? Did he not become a bene=
factor to the whole=20

district? And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you, li=
ttle by little, became his=20

assistant in all his undertakings? And a capital assistant, too--oh, I know=
, Mrs. Alving, that praise is=20

due to you.--But now I come to the next great error in your life.  MRS. ALV=
ING. What do you=20

mean?  MANDERS. Just as you once disowned a wife's duty, so you have since =
disowned a=20

mother's.  MRS. ALVING. Ah--!  MANDERS. You have been all your life under t=
he dominion of a=20

pestilent spirit of self-will. The whole bias of your mind has been towards=
 insubordination and=20

lawlessness. You have never known how to endure any bond. Everything that h=
as weighed upon=20

you in life you have cast away without care or conscience, like a burden yo=
u were free to throw off=20

at will. It did not please you to be a wife any longer, and you left your h=
usband. You found it=20

troublesome to be a mother, and you sent your child forth among strangers. =
 MRS. ALVING. Yes,=20

that is true. I did so.  MANDERS. And thus you have become a stranger to hi=
m.  MRS. ALVING.=20

No! no! I am not.  MANDERS. Yes, you are; you must be. And in what state of=
 mind has he=20

returned to you? Bethink yourself well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly aga=
inst your husband;--that=20

you recognise by raising yonder memorial to him. Recognise now, also, how y=
ou have sinned=20

against your son--there may yet be time to lead him back from the paths of =
error. Turn back=20

yourself, and save what may yet be saved in him. For [With uplifted forefin=
ger] verily, Mrs. Alving,=20

you are a guilt-laden mother! This I have thought it my duty to say to you.=
  [Silence.]  MRS.=20

ALVING. [Slowly and with self-control.] You have now spoken out, Pastor Man=
ders; and to-morrow=20

you are to speak publicly in memory of my husband. I shall not speak to-mor=
row. But now I will=20

speak frankly to you, as you have spoken to me.  MANDERS. To be sure; you w=
ill plead excuses=20

for your conduct--  MRS. ALVING. No. I will only tell you a story.  MANDERS=
. Well--?  MRS.=20

ALVING. All that you have just said about my husband and me, and our life a=
fter you had brought=20

me back to the path of duty--as you called it--about all that you know noth=
ing from personal=20

observation. From that moment you, who had been our intimate friend, never =
set foot in our house=20

gain.  MANDERS. You and your husband left the town immediately after.  MRS.=
 ALVING. Yes;=20

and in my husband's lifetime you never came to see us. It was business that=
 forced you to visit me=20

when you undertook the affairs of the Orphanage.  MANDERS. [Softly and hesi=
tatingly.] Helen--if=20

that is meant as a reproach, I would beg you to bear in mind--  MRS. ALVING=
.--the regard you=20

owed to your position, yes; and that I was a runaway wife. One can never be=
 too cautious with=20

such unprincipled creatures.  MANDERS. My dear--Mrs. Alving, you know that =
is an absurd=20



exaggeration--  MRS. ALVING. Well well, suppose it is. My point is that you=
r judgment as to my=20

married life is founded upon nothing but common knowledge and report.  MAND=
ERS. I admit that.=20

What then?  MRS. ALVING. Well, then, Pastor Manders--I will tell you the tr=
uth. I have sworn to=20

myself that one day you should know it--you alone!  MANDERS. What is the tr=
uth, then?  MRS.=20

ALVING. The truth is that my husband died just as dissolute as he had lived=
 all his days.=20

MANDERS. [Feeling after a chair.] What do you say?  MRS. ALVING. After nine=
teen years of=20

marriage, as dissolute--in his desires at any rate--as he was before you ma=
rried us.  MANDERS.=20

And those-those wild oats--those irregularities--those excesses, if you lik=
e--you call "a dissolute=20

life"?  MRS. ALVING. Our doctor used the expression.  MANDERS. I do not und=
erstand you.=20

MRS. ALVING. You need not.  MANDERS.  Lee=E2=80=99s previous campaign had s=
hown with what=20

disregard of military rules he could act, a recklessness up to this time ju=
stified by good luck and=20

the ineptitude of his adversaries. Still contemptuous of risks, he made jus=
t here an audacious=20

move which was to result unfortunately.[246] He ordered, or perhaps suffere=
d, Stuart, whom as he=20

drew toward the Potomac he had held close on his right flank, to undertake =
with the cavalry a raid=20

around the Federal army, after the precedents of the Peninsular and Second =
Bull Run campaigns.=20

Casting loose from his chief, June 25th, Stuart sallied out eastward and pe=
netrated close to the=20

neighborhood of Washington. He did no harm beyond making a few small captur=
es and causing a=20

useless scare; on the other hand, he suffered terrible fatigue, his exhaust=
ed men falling asleep=20

almost by squadrons in their saddles. He could get no news from his friends=
, nor could he find=20

Ewell=E2=80=99s corps, which he had hoped to meet. Quite worn out with hard=
ship, he did not become=20

available to Lee until the late afternoon of July 2d. A critical battle mig=
ht have had a different=20

issue[247] had the Confederate cavalry been in its proper place. It was alm=
ost a chance, through a=20

scout of Longstreet=E2=80=99s, that Lee, at Chambersburg, all uncertain of =
the Federal movement, heard at=20

last that his enemy was close at hand and threatening his communications. A=
t once he withdrew=20

Ewell southward, so that he might face the danger with his three divisions =
together.  Meantime a=20

most critical change came about in the camp of his foes. Hooker, on ill ter=
ms with Halleck, and=20

engaged in controversy with him over Halleck=E2=80=99s refusal to authorize=
 the withdrawal of the garrison=20

of Harper=E2=80=99s Ferry, rather petulantly asked to be relieved of comman=
d, and the President complied=20

at once. Such promptness was to be expected. Hooker had been doing well; bu=
t he had done just=20

as well before Chancellorsville; he was generally distrusted; his best subo=
rdinates were outspoken=20

as to his lamentable record. The unsparing critic of Burnside had now to ta=
ke his own medicine. A=20

battle with Lee could not be ventured upon under a commander who could not =
keep on good=20

terms with the administration, had there been nothing else. It was perilous=
 swapping of horses in=20

the midst of the stream, but Lincoln was forced to do it. Some cried out fo=
r the restoration of=20

McClellan, and others for that of Fr=C3=A9mont. The appointment fell to Geo=
rge Gordon Meade,=20

commander of the Fifth Corps, who, with soldierly dignity, obeyed orders, a=
ssuming the burden=20

June 28th, with a pledge to do his best.  Meade, a West-Pointer of 1835,[24=
8] was a man of ripe=20

experience, thoroughly trained in war. He had first risen leading a brigade=
 of the Pennsylvania=20

reserves at Mechanicsville, just a year earlier. The good name then won he =
confirmed at Antietam,=20

and still more at Fredericksburg. He was tall and spare, with an eagle face=
 which no one that saw=20

it can forget, a perfect horseman, and, though irascible, possessed of stro=
ng and manly character.=20

In that momentous hour the best men were doubtful on what footing they stoo=
d. When Lincoln=E2=80=99s=20



messenger, with a solemn countenance, handed to Meade the appointment, he t=
ook it to be an=20

order for his arrest. Placed in command, he hesitated not a moment, buildin=
g his strategy upon the=20

foundation laid by his predecessor.  Meade had with him in the field seven =
corps of infantry: the=20

First, commanded temporarily by Doubleday; the Second, by Hancock, recently=
 promoted; the=20

Third, by Sickles; the Fifth, his own corps, now turned over to Sykes; the =
Sixth, Sedgwick,=20

fortunately not displaced, though so unjustly censured for his noble work o=
n May 3d; the Eleventh,=20

Howard; and the Twelfth, Slocum. The excellent cavalry divisions were under=
 Buford, Kilpatrick,=20

and Gregg; and in the lower places capable young officers--Custer, Merritt,=
 Farnsworth, Devin,=20

Gamble--were pushing into notice. Of field-guns there were three hundred an=
d forty. It was a fault=20

of the Union organization that corps, divisions, and brigades were too smal=
l, bringing about,=20

among other evils, too large a number of general and staff officers.[249] T=
he Confederates here=20

were wiser. Lee faced Meade=E2=80=99s seven corps with but three, and two h=
undred and ninety-three=20

guns; but each Confederate corps was nearly or quite twice as large as a Un=
ion corps; divisions=20

and brigades were in the same relative proportion. The Army of the Potomac =
numbered 88,289=20

effectives; the Army of Northern Virginia, 75,000.[250]  [Illustration: POS=
ITION OF FEDERAL AND=20

CONFEDERATE ARMIES, JUNE 30, 1863  (Federal: hollow bars, Confederate: soli=
d bars)]=20

Meade at once chose and caused to be surveyed a position on Pipe Creek, jus=
t south of the=20

Maryland line, as a field suitable to be held should the enemy come that wa=
y. He marched,=20

however,=20


_
union of all these years, was nothing more than a hidden abyss!  MRS. ALVIN=
G. Neither more nor=20

less. Now you know it.  MANDERS. This is--this is inconceivable to me. I ca=
nnot grasp it! I cannot=20

realise it! But how was it possible to--? How could such a state of things =
be kept secret?  MRS.=20

ALVING. That has been my ceaseless struggle, day after day. After Oswald's =
birth, I thought=20

Alving seemed to be a little better. But it did not last long. And then I h=
ad to struggle twice as hard,=20

fighting as though for life or death, so that nobody should know what sort =
of man my child's father=20

was. And you know what power Alving had of winning people's hearts. Nobody =
seemed able to=20

believe anything but good of him. He was one of those people whose life doe=
s not bite upon their=20

reputation. But at last, Mr. Manders--for you must know the whole story--th=
e most repulsive thing=20

of all happened.  MANDERS. More repulsive than what you have told me?  MRS.=
 ALVING. I had=20

gone on bearing with him, although I knew very well the secrets of his life=
 out of doors. But when=20

he brought the scandal within our own walls--  MANDERS. Impossible! Here!  =
MRS. ALVING. Yes;=20

here in our own home. It was there [Pointing towards the first door on the =
right], in the dining-room,=20

that I first came to know of it. I was busy with something in there, and th=
e door was standing ajar. I=20

heard our housemaid come up from the garden, with water for those flowers. =
 MANDERS. Well--?=20

MRS. ALVING. Soon after, I heard Alving come in too. I heard him say someth=
ing softly to her.=20

And then I heard--[With a short laugh]--oh! it still sounds in my ears, so =
hateful and yet so=20

ludicrous--I heard my own servant-maid whisper, "Let me go, Mr. Alving! Let=
 me be!"  MANDERS.=20

What unseemly levity on his part! But it cannot have been more than levity,=
 Mrs. Alving; believe=20

me, it cannot.  MRS. ALVING. I soon knew what to believe. Mr. Alving had hi=
s way with the girl;=20

and that connection had consequences, Mr. Manders.  MANDERS. [As though pet=
rified.] Such=20

things in this house--in this house!  MRS. ALVING. I had borne a great deal=
 in this house. To keep=20

him at home in the evenings, and at night, I had to make myself his boon co=
mpanion in his secret=20

orgies up in his room. There I have had to sit alone with him, to clink gla=
sses and drink with him,=20

and to listen to his ribald, silly talk. I have had to fight with him to ge=
t him dragged to cautiously, his=20

corps in touch but spread wide apart, ready for battle and protecting as ev=
er the capital and cities=20

of the coast.[251] His especial reliance in this hour of need was John F. R=
eynolds, hand in hand=20

with whom he had proceeded in his career from the day when, as fellow-briga=
diers, they repulsed=20

A.=C2=A0P. Hill at Beaver Dam Creek. This man he trusted completely and lov=
ed much. He warmly=20

approved Hooker=E2=80=99s action in committing to Reynolds the left wing ne=
arest the enemy, made up of=20

the First, Third, and Eleventh corps. This made Reynolds second in command.=
 Meade,=20

commander-in-chief, retained the centre and right. So the armies hovered, e=
ach uncertain of the=20

other=E2=80=99s exact whereabouts, during the last days of June.  [Illustra=
tion: OPENING OF BATTLE OF=20

GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 8 A.M.]  On July 1st, though Stuart for the moment was =
out of the=20

campaign, the Federal cavalry was on hand. Buford=E2=80=99s division, throw=
n out from the Federal left,=20

moved well forward north of the town of Gettysburg, and were met by Heth=E2=
=80=99s division of Hill=E2=80=99s=20

corps, marching forward, it is said, with no more hostile purpose at the ti=
me than that of getting=20

shoes.[252] Buford held his line valiantly, being presently joined by Reyno=
lds. The two, from the=20

cupola of the seminary near by, studied the prospect hurriedly. A stand mus=
t be made then and=20

there, and the First Corps, close at hand, was presently in support of the =
bold horsemen, who,=20

dismounted, were with their carbines blocking the advance of the hostile in=

irreparable and lamentable loss of the entire battle now occurred at the ve=

dead at the front, leaving the left divisions without a leader in the most =
critical hour. Heth=E2=80=99s=20

advance was roughly handled; one brigade was mostly captured, Doubleday nod=

Archer, as the latter was passed to the rear among the prisoners.[253] Ther=
e were still other=20

captures and much fighting; but Ewell was fast arriving by the roads from t=

Howard, with the Eleventh Corps, came up from the south at the same time, t=

Confederate battalions could not be held. Barlow, thrown out far forward in=
to Ewell=E2=80=99s path, was at=20

MANDERS. [Moved.] And you were able to bear all this!  MRS. ALVING. I had t=
o bear it for my=20

little boy's sake. But when the last insult was added; when my own servant-=
maid--; then I swore to=20

myself: This shall come to an end! And so I took the reins into my own hand=
--the whole control--

over him and everything else. For now I had a weapon against him, you see; =
he dared not oppose=20

me. It was then I sent Oswald away from home. He was nearly seven years old=
, and was=20

beginning to observe and ask questions, as children do. That I could not be=

child must be poisoned by merely breathing the air of this polluted home. T=
hat was why I sent him=20

away. And now you can see, too, why he was never allowed to set foot inside=
 his home so long as=20

his father lived. No one knows what that cost me.  MANDERS. You have indeed=
 had a life of trial.=20

MRS. ALVING. I could never have borne it if I had not had my work. For I ma=

worked! All the additions to the estate--all the improvements--all the labo=

Alving was so much praised for having introduced--do you suppose he had ene=

 but I may tell you this=20

too: when he had his better intervals, it was I who urged him on; it was I =
who had to drag the=20

chedness.=20

MANDERS. And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?  MRS. ALVING. The=
re you see the=20

power of an evil conscience.  MANDERS. Evil--? What do you mean? the town, =
where large=20

numbers were captured. Fortunately, on the high crest of Cemetery Hill, How=
ard had stationed in=20

reserve the division of Steinwehr. What broken brigades and regiments, flee=
ing through the town,=20

could reach this point were forthwith rallied and reorganized. Thus, at mid=
-day of July 1st, things=20

were hopeful for Lee. The First Corps, its flank exposed by the retirement =
of the Eleventh Corps,=20

fell back fighting through Gettysburg to Cemetery Hill during the afternoon=
. Lee swept the Federals=20

from the town and the fields and ridges beyond. Had Ewell stormed Cemetery =
Hill at once, Lee=20

might have won a great success.  One of the first marks of a capacity for l=
eadership is the power=20

to choose men, and Meade now showed this conspicuously. He had lost Reynold=
s, his main=20

dependence, a loss that no doubt affected greatly the fortunes of the first=
 day=E2=80=99s battle; he replaced=20

Reynolds with a young officer whom it was necessary to push over the heads =
of several seniors;=20

but a better selection could not have been made. Of the splendid captains w=

from each grade to the next higher through faithful and able service. He co=
