dracaena marginata to the consequences, the Frenchman rushed forward with a=
 short sharp cry, his sword passed across Haggard's chest without touching =
him, but poor Barbiche had literally impaled himself on his adversary's ext=
ended weapon. His sabre dropped from his hand. He flung both his arms high =
in air, giving one bitter shriek. His face assumed the expression of one en=
during intense torture, and then was calm again. The body, for he was dead,=
 _slipped off_ Haggard's sword in a heap at his elegant existence. All, too=
, was enhanced by the historic character of the roof and by the recollectio=
n that their mutual ancestors, as Clare Arundel more than once intimated to=
 him, had created England. Having had so many pleasant dinners in St. James=
=E2=80=99s Square, and spent there so many evening hours, it was not wonder=
ful that Lothair had accepted an invitation from Lord St. Jerome to pass Ea=
ster at his country-seat.       CHAPTER 13 Vauxe, the seat of the St. Jerom=
es, was dracaena marginata to the consequences, the Frenchman rushed forwar=

ouching him, but poor Barbiche had literally impaled himself on his adversa=
ry's extended weapon. His sabre dropped from his hand. He flung both his ar=

All, too, was enhanced by the historic character of the roof and by the rec=
ollection that their mutual ancestors, as Clare Arundel more than once inti=
mated to him, had created England. Having had so many pleasant dinners in S=
t. James=E2=80=99s Square, and spent there so many evening hours, it was no=
t wonderful that Lothair had accepted an invitation from Lord St. Jerome to=
 pass Easter at his country-seat.       CHAPTER 13 Vauxe, the seat of the S=
t. Jeromes, was _
position of the French fencing schools--the right foot well forward, both k=
nees considerably bent,=20

the left arm high in air, the elbow at a right angle. He kept his sword poi=
nted at the eyes of his=20

adversary; but he never rested for an instant. He evidently meant business.=
 Haggard, on the=20

contrary, assumed a totally different posture. His left arm was behind his =
back, the hand clenched,=20

the right leg perfectly straight. He held the sabre lower, but the point wa=
s kept unwaveringly at the=20

chest of his enemy; his teeth were set. On his face was that quasi-good-hum=
oured smile, which is=20

alike assumed by the British boxer and the British ballet-girl when exhibit=
ing their arts.  The=20

Frenchman's blade scintillated in the setting sun around Haggard's more sti=
ffly held weapon. As it=20

grated against it, first on one side then on the other, Barbiche made pass =
after pass, feint after=20

feint at his impassive adversary. Suddenly he sprang forward with cat-like =
agility, his left hand=20

touching the ground, and he made a rapid pass from below upwards at the Eng=
lishman; his point=20

passed dangerously near his ribs. It was the well-known extension _en secon=
de_; a favourite trick=20

among Parisian swordsmen of the Romantic school. The attempt failed, and wa=
s followed by a=20

rapid succession of miscellaneous thrusts and passes in bewildering variety=
. The Frenchman=20

never withdrew his blade; but his very anxiety to make a hit was defeating =
itself. Such tactics with=20

the light rapier or small-sword are doubtless correct; but Barbiche forgot =
the weight of his weapon,=20

and the muscles of his arm were already beginning to tire.  As that experie=
nced swordsman,=20

General Pepper, standing with stick extended, viewed the fight, it seemed t=
o him that Haggard, by=20

remaining purely on the defensive, ran a considerable risk, but that was Ha=
ggard's business.=20

Perhaps after all his principal meant to take a flesh wound, and so end the=
 matter. "But," thought=20

the general to himself, "he'll find out his mistake, if that dancing devil =
gets in one of his vicious=20

develop the highest qualities and the most sublime conduct. If he were equa=
l to the occasion, and=20

could control and even subdue these sons of Korah, he would rank with Micha=
el the Archangel.=20

This was the text on which frequent discourses were delivered to Lothair, a=
nd to which he listened=20

at first with eager, and soon with enraptured attention. The priestess was =
worthy of the shrine.=20

Few persons were ever gifted with more natural eloquence: a command of lang=
uage, choice=20

without being pedantic; beautiful hands that fluttered with irresistible gr=
ace; flashing eyes and a=20

voice of melody.  Lothair began to examine himself, and to ascertain whethe=
r he possessed the=20

necessary qualities, and was capable of sublime conduct. His natural modest=
y and his strong=20

religious feeling struggled together. He feared he was not an archangel, an=
d yet he longed to=20

struggle with the powers of darkness.  One day he ventured to express to Mi=
ss Arundel a=20

somewhat hopeful view of the future, but Miss Arundel shook her head.  =E2=
=80=9CI do not agree with my=20

aunt, at least as regards this country,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel; =E2=80=
=9CI think our sins are too great. We left His=20

Church, and God is now leaving us.=E2=80=9D  Lothair looked grave, but was =
silent.  Weeks had passed=20

since his introduction to the family of Lord St. Jerome, and it was remarka=
ble how large a portion=20

of his subsequent time had passed under that roof. At first there were few =
persons in town, and=20

really of these Lothair knew none; and then the house in St. James=E2=80=99=
s Square was not only an=20

interesting but it was an agreeable house. All Lady St. Jerome=E2=80=99s fa=
mily connections were persons=20

of much fashion, so there was more variety and entertainment than sometimes=
 are to be found=20

under a Roman Catholic roof. Lady St. Jerome was at home every evening befo=
re Easter. Few=20

dames can venture successfully on so decided a step; but her saloons were a=
lways attended, and=20

by =E2=80=9Cnice people.=E2=80=9D Occasionally the cardinal stepped in, and=
, to a certain degree, the saloon was=20



the rendezvous of the Catholic party; but it was=20


_
face. De Kerguel was no less excited, but he preserved a calm exterior.  Mo=
re than two minutes=20

had now elapsed since the combat had first commenced. These things take lon=
ger to tell than to=20

do. Suddenly, in an instant, Barbiche made a furious lunge at his opponent;=
 the Englishman=20

parried it with distinguished. Many bright dames and damsels, and many infl=
uential men, were=20

there, who little deemed that deep and daring thoughts were there masked by=
 many a gracious=20

countenance. The social atmosphere infinitely pleased Lothair. The mixture =
of solemn duty and=20

graceful diversion, high purposes=20
