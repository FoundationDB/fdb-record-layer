dracaena marginata monotonous, but to handle such material otherwise than s=
atirically, we must master the art of comedy, and comedy is an art too diff=
icult. What Bret Harte and Riley and Eugene Field did in such circumstances=
 was to obscure the meanness of the subject by sentimentality, instead of i=
lluminating it by the comic spirit. Spoon River has been celebrated before,=
 though we may not have recognized the subject with the old sentimental sur=
face removed; much of our contemporary satire has been the kind the minorit=

; Anne de Beaujeu had no such right, and the difficulties with which she ha=

, than those domestic intrigues and rebellions which Blanche could face wit=
hout having to guard her frontiers from powerful and hostile neighbors. By =
her political achievements Madame la Grande merits comparison with the moth=
er of Saint Louis. And yet it is dracaena marginata monotonous, but to hand=
