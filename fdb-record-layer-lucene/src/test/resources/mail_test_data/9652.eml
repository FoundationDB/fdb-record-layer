philodendron monstera woodwork was of oak, age-darkened to a brown-black, a=

ibbons and scrolls and shields and griffin's heads cut out of the wood; and=
 deep shelves on which were arranged queerly shaped and colored china vases=

don't like him and I never shall. He's bullied me all the voyage and now he=
 thinks he has only to=20

ask me and I'll make up. I wish he'd let me alone!"  "How unforgiving you a=
re, Ned," said Nora,=20

"don't you ever do wrong things yourself?"  "I never do mean things. And it=
's no use talking; I shall=20

always despise him."  She said no more, thinking, "I will leave it to time.=
 They will be so much=20

together that they will have to like each other to be comfortable. If only =
Oscar doesn't lose his=20

temper and take to tormenting him again!"  Happily Oscar kept his temper. H=
e had a great notion=20

of clerks or with solicitors, and thus Crepitude knew not what pitfalls for=
 him her evidence might=20

contain. He drew from her an expression of opinion that her husband was the=
 real Priam Farll, but=20

she could give no reasons in support--did not seem to conceive that reasons=
 in support were=20

necessary.  "Has your husband any moles?" asked Crepitude suddenly.  "Any w=
hat?" demanded=20

Alice, leaning forward.  Vodrey, K.C., sprang up.  "I submit to your lordsh=
ip that my learned friend=20

and, once convinced that he had done wrong, he took his punishment unflinch=
ingly, angry for the=20

moment, sometimes, but bearing no malice.  By this time the voyage had ende=
d and they were in=20

Warwickshire, visiting an English friend of Mrs. Morris. It was while there=
 that they went one=20

afternoon to drink tea with Lady Margaret Vincent. Lady Margaret was a Scot=
chwoman. She had=20

married an Englishman (long since dead), and for many differently?"  "Has y=
our husband any=20

birthmarks--er--on his body?" Crepitude tried again.  "Oh! _Moles_, you sai=
d? You needn't be=20

afraid. Yes, he's got two moles, close together on his neck, here." And she=
 pointed amid silence to=20

the exact spot. Then, noticing the silence, she added, "That's all that I _=
know_ of."  Crepitude=20

resolved to end his examination upon this impressive note, and he sat down.=
 And Alice had=20

Vodrey, K.C.,=20


_
travelled far and often, having even been to America, which is considered a=
 prodigious journey in=20

England.  Edmund was charmed with Lady Margaret's home. He could not look e=
nough at the=20

quaint old garden with its formal flower-beds and primly cut yew-trees, or =
the wonderful old house,=20

the front of which had not been changed since Henry and Elizabeth. As they =
went through the hall,=20

he gazed in an awe-stricken way at the great carved staircase and the walls=
  "You met your=20

husband through a matrimonial agency?" he asked.  "Yes."  "Who first had re=
course to the=20

agency?"  "I did."  "And what was your object?"  "I wanted to find a husban=
d, of course," she=20

smiled. "What _do_ people go to matrimonial agencies for?"  "You aren't her=
e to put questions to=20

me," said Vodrey severely.  "Well," she said, "I should have thought you wo=
uld have known what=20

people went to matrimonial agencies for. Still, you live and learn." She=20

strangely fashioned weapons. He felt as though he were stepping into the Mi=
ddle Ages.=20

Meanwhile, Oscar, oblivious of the Middle Ages and every other improving su=
bject, was getting=20

acquainted with the page. Oscar had seen pages, for the first time, in New =
York. He pitied them;=20

they couldn't like it, rigged out in those ridiculous clothes and never abl=
e to laugh or play. Always=20

willing to talk, he did his best to amuse them. Now he was busy questioning=
 James: Did his high=20

collar hurt him? Did he have to rub up his buttons to keep them bright? Did=
--here his aunt saw him=20

and jerked him away.  From the hall they passed into a  "Do you think a mat=
rimonial agency is=20

quite the nicest way of----"  "It depends what you mean by 'nice,'" said Al=
ice.  "Womanly."  "Yes,"=20

said Alice shortly, "I do. If you're going to stand there and tell me I'm u=
nwomanly, all I have to say=20

is that you're unmanly."  "You say you first met your husband outside St Ge=
orge's Hall?"  "Yes."=20

"Never seen him before?"  "No."  "How did you recognize him?"  "By his phot=
ograph."  "Oh, he'd=20

sent you his photograph?"  "Yes."  "With a letter?"  "Yes."  "In what name =
was the letter signed?"=20

"Henry Leek."  "Was that before or after the death of the man who was burie=
