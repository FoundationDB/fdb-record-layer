finest bulls in the West. The cows are all Breeders, and will have calves b=

having determined the existence and limit of species, which mineralogists h=

 of science, and it is=20

his praise, that he has preserved the meekness of religion amidst the most =
flattering success. Our=20

scientific countrymen, who have visited Paris, have been particularly indeb=
ted to him; and this=20

notice is, in their behalf, both the tribute of justice and gratitude.  [51=

for retaining _my own specific name_. His knowledge of this plant was deriv=

Herbarium, where he found it under the name of _tripsacum cylindricum, Mich=
_? Although it can=20

hardly be the plant of _Michaux_, it was so considered by the late _Dr. Muh=
lenberg_, when=20

specimens were first communicated to him. It remains under this name in his=
 Herbarium, but is not=20

included in his _work on the grasses_. He left it for me to describe along =
with other new and=20

doubtful plants from the south.  [52] This is the specific name found in my=

t my request upon=20

the last snow which fell. "A pint and a half of snow water was reduced by e=
vaporation to a few=20

drops. On testing this with vegetable blue infusions no alteration of colou=
r took place. It was=20

afterward evaporated to dryness, and about a quarter of a grain of a solid =
residuum was obtained.=20

This was redissolved in a small quantity of pure rain water, and prussiate =
of potash added to it,=20

without occasioning any precipitate. Nitrate of silver produced a white pre=
cipitate so copious, that=20

the solution was thick with it. Carbonate of soda produced no effect. The t=
ransparency of a=20

solution of muriate of barytes was not disturbed by it. These experiments p=
rove, that a _free acid_=20

does not exist in snow water, but that the muriate exists in it combined wi=
th an alkali, which is most=20

probably soda."  [60] Mr. J. Murray, of London, considers this to be a mist=
ake. _Free muriatic=20

acid_, and not muriate of soda, he says, will be found in the recipient.--_=
