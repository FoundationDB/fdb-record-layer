    CHAPTER XVII. - RECEPTION OF LAS CASAS IN HIS DIOCESE.  EVENTS IN CIUDA=
D REAL.  THE INDIANS OF CHIAPA   Although the Bishop of Chiapa, upon landin=
g in his diocese, determined to follow the dictates of prudence rather than=
 the promptings of zeal in bringing his spiritual subjects into wonderful v=
ision.  Paaker would not listen to me, and I went back into my room full of=
 sorrow; and when at last, after the sun had risen, I fell asleep for a few=
 minutes, I dreamed I saw before me the poet Pentaur, who is wonderfully li=
ke my dead husband in appearance and in voice.  Paaker went up to him, and =
abused him violently, and threatened him with his fist; the priest raised h=
is arms in prayer, just as I saw him yesterday at the festival--but not _
themselves and the only result of the action of Las Casas was, that they se=
nt their representatives=20

to Spain to procure some reform in the more obnoxious articles of the code.=
  The presence of Las=20

Casas in Hispaniola infused new courage into the Dominicans, who had been d=
iscouraged in=20

recent years by the difficulty and hopelessness of contending against publi=
c opinion on the subject=20

of the Indians and had consequently ceased to preach and agitate in their f=
avour: some members=20

of the community had even been affected by the prevalent opinion that the I=
ndians were really a=20

race of a different order, servile by nature, and destined by Providence to=
 a life of subjection to=20

their superiors.  Learned arguments were found to sustain garden in the cit=
y.  On the Nile they met=20

Paaker's boat, and Ani caused it and his own to be stopped, while he reques=
ted Paaker to visit=20

him shortly at the palace.  The high-priest's garden was in no respect infe=
rior in beauty and extent=20

to that of the Mohar.  The ground had belonged to his family from the remot=
est generations, and=20

his house was large and magnificent.  He seated himself in a shady arbor, t=
o take a repast with his=20

still handsome wife and his young and pretty daughters.  He consoled his wi=
fe for the various=20

damage done by the hurricane, promised the girls to build a new and handsom=
er clove-cot in the=20

place of the one which had been blown down, and laughed and joked with them=
 all; for here the=20

severe head of the=20


_
well-known chapters of Aristotle's _Politics_ were quoted, the Scriptures w=
ere drawn upon, and,=20

as not infrequently happens, many good men adopted the easier line of not c=
ontending with the=20

views of the rich and powerful.  There now ensued a sort of revival of the =
old enthusiasm in the=20

defence of the natives; sermons were preached which stirred up great wrath =
and provoked protest=20

from the authorities. It was easy to adopt reprisals on the friars, and the=
 colonists did not hesitate=20

to do so, refusing alms and supplies to the convents.  Threats of violence,=
 even of shooting Fray=20

Tomas Casillas, whose sermons had been particularly offensive, were not wan=
ting, though=20

fortunately they were not executed.  The friars were reduced to the last ex=
tremity and, but for the=20

charity of some few sympathisers and the generous aid of the Franciscan mon=
ks who fed=20

Necropolis, became a simple man, an affectionate husband, a tender father, =
a judicious friend,=20

among his children, his flowers, and his birds.  His youngest daughter clun=
g to his right arm, and=20

an older one to his left, when he rose from table to go with them to the po=
ultry-yard.  On the way=20

thither a servant announced to him that the Lady Setchem wished to see him.=
  "Take her to your=20

mistress," he said.  But the slave--who held in his hand a handsome gift in=
 money--explained that=20

the widow wished to speak with him alone.  "Can I never enjoy an hour's pea=
ce like other men?"=20

exclaimed Ameni annoyed.  "Your mistress can receive her, and she can wait =
with her till I come.=20

It is true, girls--is it not?--that I belong to you just now, and to the fo=
wls, and ducks, and pigeons?"=20

His youngest daughter kissed him, the second patted him affectionately,=20


_
they would have found themselves in want of the absolute necessaries of lif=
e in the midst of a=20

hostile populace.  At this juncture a notable conversion was effected by th=
eir preaching; a widow=20

named Solano, who was reputed the richest person in the colony, came one da=
y to the convent=20

and declared that she was convinced of the truth of all the preachers had e=
xpounded concerning=20

the iniquity of slavery and that she had in consequence resolved, not only =
to liberate her two=20

hundred and more slaves, but to make restitution of her tainted wealth in a=
s far as she could, by=20

transferring her plantations to the Order, as her awakened conscience forba=
de her enjoyment of it.=20

This event stirred the entire colony profoundly, and as the action of the f=
riars was so clearly=20

contrary to their own temporal interests as to place the sincerity of their=
 convictions and the purity=20

of their motive beyond question, a certain revulsion in public sentiment be=
gan to manifest itself. It=20

is not recorded that anybody else followed the widow's example, but such a =
change was operated=20

in the disposition of the better class of people that when the time for Las=
 Casas and his friars to=20

leave arrived, regret for their departure was expressed on all sides.  On D=
ecember 14th they=20

embarked on what proved to be a long and tempestuous voyage, attended by ma=
ny and Lady=20

Setchem to accompany him into the garden.  The poor, anxious, and frightene=
d woman had=20

resolved on this step with much difficulty; tears filled her kind eyes, as =
she communicated her=20

troubles to the high-priest.  "Thou art a wise counsellor," she said, "and =
thou knowest well how my=20

son honors the Gods of the temple of Seti with gifts and offerings.  He wil=
l not listen to his mother,=20

but thou hast influence with him.  He meditates frightful things, and if he=
 cannot be terrified by=20

threats of punishment from the Immortals, he will raise his hand against Me=
na, and perhaps--"=20

"Against the king," interrupted Ameni gravely.  "I know it, and I will spea=
k to him."  "Thanks, oh a=20

thousand thanks!"  cried the widow, and she seized the high-priests robe to=
 kiss it.  "It was thou=20

who soon after his birth didst tell my husband that he was born under a luc=
ky star, and would grow=20

to be an honor and an ornament to his house and to his country.  And now --=
now he will ruin=20

himself in this world, and the next."  "What I foretold of your son," said =
Ameni, "shall assuredly be=20

fulfilled, for the ways of the Gods are not as the ways of men."  "Thy word=
s do me good!"  cried=20

Setchem.  "None can tell what fearful terror weighed upon my heart, when I =
made up my mind to=20

come here.  But thou dost not yet know all.  The great masts of cedar,=20


_
great dangers; owing to the ignorance of the pilot, the Bishop himself had =
to take the wheel.=20

Christmas was celebrated at sea, and it was not until the fifth of January =
that they finally landed at=20

the port of Lazaro on the coast of Campeche.  The first episcopal function =
performed by the=20

Bishop in his new diocese was the pontifical celebration of the vigil and m=
ass of the Epiphany,=20

during which he delivered an earnest discourse on the one theme that furnis=
hed material for all his=20

sermons and writings--the injustice and sin of slavery and the obligation r=
esting on all from=20

Lebanon to Thebes to bear our banners, and ornament our gateway, were throw=
n to the ground at=20

sunrise by the frightful wind."  "Thus shall your son's defiant spirit be b=
roken," said Ameni; "But for=20

you, if you have patience, new joys shall arise."  "I thank thee again," sa=
id Setchem.  But=20

something yet remains to be said.  I know that I am wasting the time that t=
hou dost devote to thy=20

family, and I remember thy saying once that here in Thebes thou wert like a=
 pack-Horse with his=20

load taken off, and free to wander over a green meadow.  I will not disturb=
 thee much=20
