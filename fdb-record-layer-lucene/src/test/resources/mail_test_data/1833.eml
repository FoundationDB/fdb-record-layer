idea, even though it meant hard work.  Chips gave consent by silence. Never=
 as enthusiastic a=20

worker as the other Cubs, he wasn't too keen over the thought of ringing do=
orbells.  Mr. Hatfield=20

gave the boys instructions and handed out pledge cards.  "Our program this =
month isn't entirely=20

one of hard work," the Cub leader then said cheerfully. "How many of you ha=
ve read the story of=20

King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table?"  Three hands waved in the breeze=
, and all faces=20

brightened.  "We're using the King Arthur theme to dramatize important poin=
ts in a Cub crusade to=20

"Strengthen the Arm of Liberty," Mr. Hatfield went on. "We'll make our own =
Round Table, armor,=20

spears and maybe horses for the knights to ride. How does the idea strike y=
ou fellows?"  "Swell!"=20

shouted three of the Cubs.  The other boys were equally excited. Eagerly th=
ey plied the Cub Scout=20

leader with questions. How would the Round Table be made? What would they  =

paused beside this selfsame rill,   And as she ceased, a daffodil   Held up=
 reproachfully his head=20

And fluttered into speech, and said:    _"Chide not the flowers!  You littl=

urs!       Yet, victor here=20

_
"One question at a time," laughed Mr. Hatfield. "It would be great if we co=
uld build a huge oak=20

table such as King Arthur and his knights used in the old days. I'm afraid =
it would be an ambitious=20

attempt."  "Can't we use an old dining-room table--one that's circular?" Br=
ad suggested.  "That's=20

what I had in mind. By the way, who knows why King Arthur used a round tabl=
e?"  Dan, who had=20

read the book, had an answer. "Wasn't it so he could provide a place of equ=
al importance for=20

every knight?"  "That's right, Dan. A round table has no foot or head. Each=
 knight was the equal of=20

every other knight. It's the same way here in America. One person has the s=
ame rights as=20

another."  "When will we start making armor and spears?" asked Midge impati=
ently.  "We'll gather=20

together the articles we need and maybe start in at our meeting next week. =
Mrs. Holloway, the=20

Den Mother, has promised to help." Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs they would ne=
ed cardboard, silver=20

or gold paint, burlap and several other items.  "We'll make banners and tur=
n this room into a=20

regular King Arthur's Court," he declared. "The place right now is as cold =
as an ancient castle!=20

Wonder what happened to that fire I built?"  Mr. Hatfield had noticed that =
despite jackets, several=20

of the Cubs were shivering.  A little heat was rising from the registers. B=
ut not much.  "Want me to=20

take a look at the furnace?" Brad offered.  "It might be a good idea," agre=
ed the Cub leader. "Toss=20

in three or four shovels of coal."  "I'll go with you, Brad," Dan offered. =
 The two boys descended a=20

narrow, dimly lighted stairway to the church basement.  Walls were damp to =
the touch. In several=20

places water oozed in through cracks in the decaying masonry.  Cobwebs hung=
 from the overhead=20

beams. In the semi-darkness, Dan ran into one, cringing as it wrapped silke=
n threads about his=20

throat.  "Glug, glug," he entoned, making a strangling sound. "I'm being ch=
oked to death!"  "Cut it=20

out!" Brad ordered. He reached for a switch and the basement room became fl=
ooded with light.=20

"What you trying to do? Work up a case of nerves?"  Dan laughed and opened =
the iron door of the=20

cavernous furnace.  Mr. Hatfield had built his fire well, but it needed mor=
e fuel.  "I'll heave some=20

in," he offered.  While Brad poked at the coals, Dan went to the bin.  The =
shovel had disappeared.=20

But after hunting a while, he found it behind the bin door.  Selecting smal=
ler lumps, Dan fed the=20

furnace two large shovelfuls. The coals leaped into fiery flame.  "Better g=
ive 'er a couple more for=20

good measure," Brad advised.  Dan trotted back to the bin. As his shovel bi=
t deep into the coal=20

pile, it struck an object which gave off a metallic sound.  Curious as to w=
hat it might be, the boy=20

dug deeper. His shovel brought to view a square metal box approximately a f=
oot square.  "Jeepers=20

creepers!" he whispered in awe. "How'd this get here?"                     =
               CHAPTER 2=20

The Metal Box   Stooping low, Dan lifted the metal box from the shovel. It =
was surprisingly heavy.=20

The boy tugged at the lid, but it stubbornly resisted his efforts.  From th=
e furnace room, the waiting=20

Brad now called impatiently:  "Hey, slow poke! Hurry up with that coal, wil=
l you? You've been in=20

that bin a couple of hours!"  Dan emerged into the light. His hands were sm=
eared with coal dust.=20

So was his blue Cub Scout uniform. A long black smudge lay across his cheek=
.  "Say, what you=20

been doing in there?" Brad demanded, staring at him. "If you aren't a sight=
!"  Dan ignored the gibe.=20

Grinning triumphantly, he thrust the metal box into the astonished Brad's h=
and.  "Look at this," he=20

directed. "What d'you say? Did I waste my time in that coal bin?"  Brad sta=
red at the box and then=20

shook it hard.  "You found this under the coal?" he demanded almost in disb=
elief.  "You catch on=20

fast," Dan grinned. "I found it under the coal."  "Well, what are we waitin=
g for? Why don't we open=20

it?"  "Go ahead," Dan encouraged.  Brad pried at the lid but could not rais=
e it.  "Stuck," he=20

observed. "At least the box doesn't seem to be locked."  Determined to open=
 it, Brad rapped one=20



corner of the lid against the hard cement floor.  The cover flew back so su=
ddenly that an object=20

tumbled out.  Brad and Dan stared. At their feet lay a package of bank note=
s, neatly held together=20

with a rubber band.  "Money!" Dan exclaimed. "Twenty dollar notes! Must be =
counterfeit."  "Gosh,=20

it looks genuine enough," Brad muttered, equally dumbfounded. "And look at =
the rest of 'em here=20

in the box!"  The boys counted ten stacks of paper money. Some were in five=
s and tens, but a=20

larger portion was in twenty dollar bills with at least a few fifties.  "Sa=
y, there must be a couple=20

thousand here," Brad said, making a rough estimate. "Maybe more. Where'd yo=
u say you found=20

it?"  Dan showed him the place in the coal bin. "How d'you suppose it got h=
ere?" he demanded.=20

"That's what I'd like to know. Someone must have hidden it here."  "Sure, b=
ut who would leave a=20

pile of money kicking around loose? Anyone who would risk it must be crazy.=
"  "I'll bet a cookie=20

someone hid it here in the empty bin--"  "The bin isn't empty."  "Of course=
 it isn't now," Brad said=20

impatiently. "But you remember the church has been closed. Coal probably wa=
s loaded in here=20

only a day or so ago. It was heaved in through the chute and no one saw the=
 box."  "Your theory is=20

as good as any," Dan admitted. "Anyway, we're rich."  Brad gave a snort of =
disgust. "Rich, my eye!=20

You're not such a dum bunny as to think we can keep this money?"  "But if n=
o one should claim it--

"  "It will be claimed fast enough. In any case, we're not getting ourselve=
s mixed up in anything.=20

We turn this box over to Mr. Hatfield--right now."  "Sure, I guess you're r=
ight," Dan admitted. "I=20

intended to show it to him. Only I thought if no one claimed the box, the m=
oney might go into the=20

Cub's treasury or maybe the church building fund."  "That's an idea," nodde=
d Brad. "But let's not=20

count any chickens--or rather, cash! I have a hunch whoever planted this mo=
ney here won't forget=20

about it!"  Excited over their discovery, the two boys hastily tossed anoth=
er shovelful of coal on the=20

fire.  Then, carrying the precious metal box, they took the stairway two st=
eps at a time.  As they=20

burst into the Cub meeting, Mr. Hatfield was explaining the different types=
 of armor used by=20

knights in early days.  "One type was made of steel mesh"--the Cub leader s=
aid, and his voice=20

trailed off.  "Excuse us, sir," Brad apologized. "Dan found this box in the=
 basement. It's full of=20

money!"  The Cubs would have suspected the two boys of playing a practical =
joke. However, Brad=20

floored them by plumping the box itself on the table.  He jerked back the l=
id, revealing the=20

packages of money.  "Ye gads!" shrieked Red. "Is it real?"  "Where'd you fi=
nd it?" demanded=20

Midge, fingering one of the fat packages. "Inside the furnace?"  "Would tha=
t be likely with a fire=20

going?" Brad demanded. "Dan dug it out of the coal pile. Must be a couple t=
housand dollars here=20

at least."  "Let's count it," proposed Fred Hatfield.  Sam, who was Fred's =
father, had not spoken.=20

However, very soberly he had been examining not only the metal box, but man=
y of the packages=20

of money.  "Do you think it's genuine, sir?" Dan asked eagerly.  "I'm not a=
n expert on money," the=20

Cub leader replied. "But this looks like straight goods to me."  "How do yo=
u suppose the box came=20

to be here in the church?" Brad asked.  "I haven't the slightest idea. It b=
others me though. I must=20

notify the pastor and the church trustees at once. Also, the discovery shou=
ld be reported to the=20

police."  The Cubs wanted to see the exact spot where Dan had found the mon=
ey box. For that=20

matter, so did Mr. Hatfield.  They all trooped down into the basement to re=
-examine the coal bin.=20

The Cub leader could find no clue as to the person who might have hidden th=
e box.  True, he=20

pointed out several large-size shoeprints visible on the dusty basement flo=
or. But he agreed with=20

Dan and Brad that they likely had been made by workmen who had repaired the=
 furnace.  "Say,=20

maybe one of the workmen hid the box!" Red exclaimed.  Mr. Hatfield said he=
 considered the=20



possibility an unlikely one. However, he would not venture even a guess as =
to who might have left=20

the box in the coal bin.  "For all we know, it might even be stolen money,"=
 he commented.  Dan,=20

who had stood near the foot of the basement stairs, had heard an unusual so=
und overhead.=20

"Listen!" he commanded.  The Cubs became quiet. Distinctly, they could hear=
 a rattling noise.=20

"Sounds like someone trying to raise a window," Brad said. "That box of mon=
ey on the table--"  Mr.=20

Hatfield started up the stairs, but without undue haste.  "Take it easy, bo=
ys," he said. "It's only the=20

wind rattling a window. The money's safe enough."  Despite reassurance, the=
 Cubs were uneasy=20

as they followed their leader up the creaking stairs.  If the box were gone=
--  Mr. Hatfield opened=20

the door of the study. Every eye focused upon the table.  The box of money =
was exactly where it=20

had been left.  "Well, that's a relief," Mr. Hatfield admitted, chuckling a=
t his own uneasiness. "I'll=20

acknowledge that hearing the window rattle gave me a most uncomfortable fee=
ling."  "How much=20

do you suppose is here?" Dan speculated, fingering one of the packages. "Sh=
all we count it?"=20

"Well--" the Cub leader hesitated. "I'm not too eager to stay here in an em=
pty church with so much=20

money. But then, go ahead. The job shouldn't take long."  The Cubs seated t=
hemselves at the=20

table. Mr. Hatfield began to count, while the Cubs checked his work.  Since=
 the onset of colder=20

weather, Den 2 had made use of the church as a meeting place for both Den a=
nd Pack gatherings.=20

In warmer weather they usually assembled at The Cave, overlooking the river=
. As its name=20

implied, the chamber had been carved by water action, and was reached by a =
flight of stairs built=20

by the Cubs and their fathers.  During the previous summer, the boys had en=
joyed many an=20

adventure along the waterfront. The story of their difficulties with river =
pirates has been told in the=20

Cub book entitled: "Dan Carter and the River Camp."  In the first Cub Scout=
 book, "Dan Carter,=20

Cub Scout," the boys tried a little back yard camping. Even so, they found =
themselves battling a=20

flood at a pheasant farm, and incidentally, meeting several unpleasant pers=
ons.  Now, as the Cubs=20

watched Mr. Hatfield count the money found in the tin box, they sensed that=
 once again they were=20

on the verge of adventure.  The Cub leader tallied eight hundred and forty =
dollars in twenty dollar=20

denominations. Brad carefully set this amount down.  Next the Cub leader st=
arted to count the ten=20

dollar bills. He was well into the third package, when Dan, a little weary =
of watching, raised his=20

eyes to the window.  What he saw nearly caused him to rise off his chair.  =
A face was pressed=20

against the windowpane.  In the fleeting instant that he saw it, Dan gained=
 only a vague=20

impression of a flattened nose and intent eyes.  Too startled to cry out, h=
e kicked Brad's foot under=20

the table.  "Hey, cut it out!" the older boy exclaimed. "Be   I greet the l=
ight that I have found,       A=20

Daffodil!"_    And when the Daffodil was done   A boastful Marigold spake o=
n:    _"Oh, chide the=20

white frost, if you choose,   The heavy clod, so hard to loose,     The pre=
ying powers   Of worm and=20

insect underground.     Chide not the flowers!   For spite of scathe and cr=
uel wound,=20

Unconquered by the sunless hours,       I rise in regal pride, a bold   And=
 golden-hearted, golden-

crowned       Marsh Marigold!"_    And when she came no more, her creek   W=
ould not believe, but=20

bade us seek    Hither, yon, and to and fro--   Everywhere that children go=
     When the Spring     Is=20

on the wing   And the winds of April blow--   "I will never think her dead;=
   "She will come again!" it=20

said;   And then the birds that use the vale,   Broken-hearted, turned the =
tale   Into syllables of=20

song   And chirped it half a summer long:    _"Silvia, Silvia,     Be our S=
ong once more,   Our vale=20

revisit, Silvia,     And be our Song once more:   For joy lies sleeping in =
the lute;   The merry pipe,=20

the woodland flute,   And all the pleading reeds are mute     That breathed=
 to thee of yore._=20



_"Silvia, Silvia,     Be our Moon again,_    _Shine on our valley, Silvia, =
  And be our Moon again:=20

The fluffy owl and nightingale   Flit silent through the darkling vale,   O=
r utter only words of wail=20

From throats all harsh with pain.    "Silvia, Silvia,     Be Springtime, as=
 of old;   Come clad in=20

laughter, Silvia,     Our Springtime, as of old:   The waiting lowlands and=
 the hills   Are tremulous=20

with daffodils   Unblown, until thy footstep thrills     Their promise into=
 gold."_    And, musing on her=20

here, I too   Must wonder if it can be true   She died, as other mortals do=
.   The thought would fit=20

her more, to feign     That, full of life and unaware   That earth holds au=
ght of grief or stain,     The=20

fairies stole and hold her where   Death enters not, nor strife nor pain;--=
    That, drowsing on some=20

bed of pansies,   By Titania's necromancies   Her senses were to slumber lu=
lled,   Deeply sunken,=20

steeped and dulled,     And by wafture of swift pinions   She was borne out=
 through earth's portals=20

To the fairy queen's dominions,   To some land of the immortals.     THE EX=
PLORERS    AND=20

encircle the visible world,   With a glimmer of light on their pinions,   T=

they vanish,   Leaving me stirred with a dream of the ultimate       beauty=
,   A sense of the ultimate=20

music,   I never shall capture;--    They are Beauty,   Formless and tremul=
ous Beauty,    Beauty=20

unborn;   Beauty as yet unappareled   In thought;   Beauty that hesitates, =
  Falters,   Withdraws=20

from the verge of birth,   Flutters,   Retreats from the portals of life;--=
   O Beauty for ever=20

uncaptured!   O songs that I never shall sing!     THE PARTING    WE have c=

flung to the heedless swine?--    Idle days and nights of mirth,   Were the=

worth?   Well, there's no gainsaying we   Squandered youth right merrily!  =
 But now, Folly, we must=20

with dream are rife,=20

For all their golden Summers and green Springs   Through leaf and root they=
 sucked the forest's=20

life,     Drank in its secret, deep, essential things,   Its midwood moods,=
 its mystic runes,     Its=20

breathing hushes stirred of faery wings,   Its August nights and April noon=
s;   The garnered fervors=20

of forgotten Junes   Flare forth again and waste away;     And in the sap t=
hat leaps and sings=20

We hear again the chant the cricket flings   Across the hawthorn-scented du=
sks of May.=20

REALITIES       REALITIES    WE are deceived by the shadow, we see not the =
      substance of=20

things.   For the hills are less solid than thought; and       deeds are bu=
t vapors; and flesh   Is a=20

mist thrown off and resumed by the soul, as       a world by a god.   Back =
of the transient=20

appearance dwells in       ineffable calm   The utter reality, ultimate tru=
th; this seems and       that=20

is.     THE STRUGGLE    I HAVE been down in a dark valley;   I have been gr=
oping through a=20

deep gorge;   Far above, the lips of it were rimmed with moonlight,   And h=
ere and there the light=20

lay on the dripping       rocks   So that it seemed they dripped with moonl=
ight,       not with water;=20

So deep it was, that narrow gash among the hills,   That those great pines =
which fringed its edge=20

Seemed to me no larger than upthrust fingers   Silhouetted against the sky;=
   And at its top the=20

vale was strait,   And the rays were slant   And reached but part way down =
the sides;   I could not=20

see the moon itself;   I walked through darkness, and the valley's edge   S=
eemed almost level with=20

the stars,   The stars that were like fireflies in the little trees.    It =
was the midnight of defeat;   I felt=20



that I had failed;   I was mocked of the gods;   There was no way out of th=
at gorge;   The paths led=20

no whither   And I could not remember their beginnings;   I was doomed to w=
ander evermore,=20

Thirsty, with the sound of mocking waters in       mine ears,   Groping, wi=
th gleams of useless light=20

Splashed in ironic beauty on the rocks above.   And so I whined.    And the=
n despair flashed into=20

rage;   I leapt erect, and cried:   _"Could I but grasp my life as sculptor=
s grasp the clay   And knead=20

and thrust it into shape again!--   If all the scorn of Heaven were but thr=
own   Into the focus of=20

some creature I could clutch!--   If something tangible were but vouchsafed=
 me   By the cold, far=20

gods!--   If they but sent a Reason for the failure of my life   I'd answer=
 it;   If they but sent a Fiend,=20

I'd conquer it!--_    _But I reach out, and grasp the air,   I rage, and th=
e brute rock echoes my=20

words in       mockery--   How can one fight the sliding moonlight on the c=
liffs?   You gods, coward=20

gods,   Come down, I challenge you!--   You who set snares with roses and w=
ith passion,   You=20

who make flesh beautiful and damn men through       the flesh,   You who pl=
ump the purple grape=20

and then put poison       in the cup,   You who put serpents in your Edens,=
   You who gave me=20

delight of my senses and broke me       for it,   You who have mingled deat=
h with beauty,   You=20

who have put into my blood the impulses for       which you cursed me,   Yo=
u who permitted my=20

brain the doubts wherefore       you damn me,   Behold, I doubt you, gods, =
no longer, but defy!--   I=20

perish here?   Then I will be slain=20

"The window!" Dan muttered. "Look!"  Not only Brad, but Mr. Hatfield and al=
l the Cubs turned to=20

see what had attracted Dan's attention.  But the face had vanished.  "What'=
s eating you, Dan?"=20

Brad demanded. "Now you've mixed up the count. Has finding this money got y=
ou jittery?"  "It sure=20

has," Dan admitted. "But I know I didn't dream up that face. I saw it plain=
 as day!"  "What face?"=20

asked Mr. Hatfield.  "I saw it only a minute ago at the window. Someone was=
 looking in here--

watching us count the money!"  "Dan has got a bad case of the jitters," Mid=
ge chuckled.  "No, he=20

hasn't either!"  Dan's unexpected defender was none other than Babe Bunning=
. The youngest=20

member of Den 2 made his announcement in a shrill voice which quavered with=
 excitement.  "I=20

saw the f-face too," he chattered. "Only I was so--so scared I couldn't say=
 anything."  "You saw it=20

too!" Brad echoed. "Say, this may add up to something!"  Mr. Hatfield alrea=
dy had darted to the=20

window.  The rain had nearly ceased. Gazing out into the drenched churchyar=
d, he could see no=20

one.  "Turn off the light a minute," he instructed.  Brad found the switch.=
  With the study dark, it=20

was easier to distinguish objects in the church yard. The Cubs clustered at=
 Mr. Hatfield's shoulder,=20

tense and uneasy.  "I don't see anyone--" Mr. Hatfield began.  He broke off=
 and Dan finished the=20

sentence. "Over there by the bushes, to the right of the walk! See!"  "Some=
one sneaking off=20

toward the street!" Brad added. "Let's nab him!"  "The dirty old peeping To=
m!" yelled Chips. "Come=20

on! We'll get him!"  "Wait, boys!" Mr. Hatfield advised. "We don't know--" =
 Usually obedient, the=20

Cubs now were too excited to listen.  Before Mr. Hatfield could stop them, =
they darted through the=20

empty church and out into the yard.  "Surround the bushes and close in," Br=
ad instructed.  The=20

Cubs circled the area where they last had seen the mysterious prowler. Soon=
 it was apparent,=20

however, that the man had eluded them.  He had slipped away in the brief ti=
me it had taken them=20

to reach the church yard. Although they looked up and down the street, the =
man was nowhere to=20

be seen.  "We've lost him!" Brad declared in deep disgust.  "Perhaps it's j=
ust as well," said Mr.=20

Hatfield. The Cub leader, a little short of breath, had followed the Cubs i=
nto the yard.  "Just as=20

well?" Brad echoed. "I don't get it."  "It's no crime to look into the wind=
ow of a church, Brad. Didn't=20

you act rather hastily?"  "I guess I did," Brad admitted. "I was so anxious=
 to catch that fellow I=20

didn't stop to think what the outcome might be if we did nail him."  "Dan, =
did you recognize the=20

person?" the Cub leader asked him.  "No, Mr. Hatfield, I didn't. All I saw =
was a face flattened=20

against the windowpane."  "You think, though, that he was watching us count=
 the money?"  "I'm=20

sure of it."  "It's possible that the person--whoever he was--may have been=
 the one who hid the=20

money in the basement," Mr. Hatfield said, thinking aloud. "On the other ha=
nd, it may have been a=20

curious passerby attracted by our light in the study."  "In any case, we we=
re seen counting the=20

money," Brad pointed out.  "And that's not good," Mr. Hatfield completed, h=
is face troubled. "I'd=20

hate to have it noised around Webster City that we've found a box of money.=
 It might make=20

trouble."  "What do you think we should do?" Brad asked anxiously.  Mr. Hat=
field already had=20

made up his mind. He spoke decisively:  "The most important thing now is to=
 get the money box to=20

a safe place. I'll take it home for tonight."  Well satisfied with the deci=
sion, the Cubs trooped back=20

into the church to gather together their belongings.  With the exception of=
 Brad and Dan, the other=20

Cubs lived close by. The two boys were to ride with Mr. Hatfield and his so=
n Fred.  "The storm has=20

let up now, so I'll trust the rest of you to shift for yourselves," the Cub=
 leader said. "Go straight to=20

your homes and don't stop along the way to pick any daisies. I'll report to=
 you in   You who have=20

wrapped me in the scorn of your silence,   The divinity in this same dust y=
ou flout_    _Flames=20



through the dust,   And dares,   And flings you back your scorn,--   Come, =
face to face, and slay=20

me if you will,   But not until you've felt the weight   Of all betricked h=
umanity's contempt   In one=20

bold blow!--   Speak forth a Reason, and I will answer it,   Yes, to your f=
aces I will answer it;=20

Come garmented in flesh and I will fight with you,   Yes, in your faces wil=
l I smite you, gods;=20

Coward gods and tricksters that set traps   In paradise!--   Far gods that =
hedge yourselves about=20

with silence   And with distance;   That mock men from the unscalable escar=
pments of       your=20

Heavens."_    Thus I raved, being mad.   I had no sooner finished speaking =
than I felt   The=20

darkness fluttered by approaching feet,   And the silence was burned throug=
h by trembling=20

flames of sound,   And I was 'ware that Something stood by me.    And with =
a shout I leapt and=20

grasped that Being,   And the Thing grasped me.   We came to wrestling grip=
s,   And back and=20

forth we swayed,   Hand seeking throat, and crook'd knee seeking   To encro=
ok unwary leg,   And=20

spread toes grasping the uneven ground;   The strained breast muscles crack=
ed and creaked,=20

The sweat ran in my eyes,   The plagued breath sobbed and whistled through =
      my throat,   I=20

tasted blood, and strangled, but still struggled       on--   The stars abo=
ve me danced in swarms=20

like yellow       bees,   The shaken moonlight writhed upon the rocks;--   =
But at the last I felt his=20

breathing weaker grow,   The tense limbs grow less tense,   And with a burs=
ting cry I bent his head=20

right       back,   Back, back, until   I heard his neck bones snap;   His =
spine crunched in my grip;   I=20

flung him to the earth and knelt upon his breast    And listened till the f=
luttering pulse was stilled.=20

Man, god, or devil, I had wrenched the life from       him!    And lo!--eve=
n as he died   The=20

moonlight failed above the vale,--   And somehow, sure, I know now how!--  =
 Between the rifted=20

rocks the great Sun struck   A finger down the cliff, and that red beam   L=
ay sharp across the face=20

of him that I had slain;   And in that light I read the answer of the silen=
t       gods   Unto my cursed-

out prayer,   For he that lay upon the ground was--I!   I understood the le=
sson then;   It was myself=20

that lay there dead;   Yes, I had slain my Self.     THE REBEL    No doubt =

leaps up to greet     The headlong, rebel flight,   Whenas some reckless me=

Midge. "It's only a couple of steps. Just take good care of that money box.=
"  "Dan, Brad and Fred=20

will help me guard it," Mr. Hatfield said. "I don't mind admitting I'll be =
relieved to turn it over to=20

someone else for safe keeping."  Before taking the box to his parked car, t=
he Cub leader carefully=20

wrapped it in his coat. Everyone breathed a bit easier when they were out o=
f the church.  Mr.=20

Hatfield locked the money box into the rear compartment of his car.  "Oh, b=
