Every reader knows=20

the story of the spread of Islam. The tribes of every part of the peninsula=
 sent embassies to do=20

homage to the Prophet. Arabia was not enough: the Prophet had written in hi=
s bold=20

uncompromising way to the great kings of the East, to the Persian Khusru, a=
nd the Greek=20

Emperor; and these little knew how soon his invitation to the faith would b=
e repeated, and how=20

quickly Islam would be knocking at their doors with no faltering hand.  The=
 Prophet's career was=20

near its end. In the tenth year of the Flight, twenty years after he had fi=
rst felt the Spirit move him=20

to preach to his people, he resolved once more to leave his adopted city an=
d go to Mekka to=20

perform a farewell pilgrimage. And when the rites were done in the valley o=
f Mina, the Prophet=20

spoke unto the multitude--the forty thousand pilgrims--with solemn last wor=
ds.[16]  'YE PEOPLE!=20

Hearken to my words; for I know not whether after this year I shall ever be=
 amongst you here=20

again.  'Your Lives and your Property are sacred and inviolable amongst one=
 another until the end=20

of time.  'The Lord hath ordained to every man the share of his inheritance=
: a Testament is not=20

flight. Washer, being much slower, decided not to follow. He knew another h=

hide until the danger was over.  =E2=80=9CHere they come!=E2=80=9D screamed=
 Downy suddenly. =E2=80=9CNow run for your=20

lives! There=E2=80=99s Black Ravine ahead!=E2=80=9D  At the same instant Ti=
mber and his pack broke cover, and=20

started for the fleeing bucks in the open. Close on their right was Puma an=
d his mate. They set up=20

a yelping and howling that made the blood of the deer curdle. It had to be =
a short race, for other=20

wolves ahead threatened to cut them off.  But there was Black Ravine. Neith=

Young Black Buck knew how wide it was, or whether they could cross it, but =
when they reached=20

Could Puma follow? In=20

 Young Black=20

Buck away from the yapping jaws of Timber Wolf and his pack. Not one of the=
m dared to follow.=20

They could no more do it than fly. They stopped at the edge and howled woef=
ully as they saw their=20

prey escape.  But not Puma the Mountain Lion. He was a wonderful jumper him=
self and the sight=20

of the escaping bucks made him wild with rage.=20

'And your Slaves, see that you feed them with such food as ye eat yourselve=
s, and clothe them=20

with the stuff ye wear. And if they commit a fault which ye are not willing=
 to forgive, then sell them,=20

for they are the servants of the Lord, and are not to be tormented.  'Ye pe=
ople! Hearken unto my=20

speech and comprehend it. Know that every Muslim is the brother of every ot=
her Muslim. All of you=20

are on the same equality: ye are one Brotherhood.'  Then, looking up to hea=
ven, he cried, 'O Lord!=20

I have delivered my message and fulfilled my mission.' And all the multitud=
e answered, 'Yea, verily=20

hast thou'!--'O Lord! I beseech Thee, bear Thou witness to it'! and, like M=
oses, he lifted up his=20

hands and blessed the people.   Three months more and Mohammad was dead.  t=
erribly hungry,=20

and he was disappointed in not catching at least one of the bucks.  When he=
 came to the edge of=20

the ravine he hesitated a minute, snarling, spitting and whisking his long =
tail. He was so angry that=20

he knocked one of the wolves over when he got in his way. For a moment ther=

outcry, and Timber threatened to pounce upon Puma=E2=80=99s back; but the f=

dissuaded him.  =E2=80=9CGet away from the edge, you snarling, sniveling so=

A.H. 11. June, 632.   It is a hard thing to form a calm estimate of the Dre=

finding the judgment unconsciously blinded by the feeling of reverence and =
growls. Puma walked=20

back a few paces, and turned to face the cliff. Then with a sudden run and =
spring he took the long=20

leap.  Ordinarily Puma would have hesitated a long time before attempting t=

Ravine, but he was wild with anger and disappointment.=20
