boarding house; Mary's mother did the cooking, her father "tended" the farm, and Mary, her 

brother and sister, did chores about the place. There was a large one-room house built in the yard 

in which the family lived. Her father had a separate garden in which he raised his produce, also a 

smokehouse where the family meats were kept. Meats were smoked in order to preserve them. 

During the day Mary's father was kept so busy attending his master's farm that there was no time

citizen soldiers, of drawing the line between civil and military life. The turbulent democracy of the 

former, led into the field, doffed the citizen, donned the soldier; and obeyed the orders of a 

commander whom as citizens they detested, and whom when they were led back to the

Mary was very active with the plow, she could handle it with the agility of a man. This prowess 

gained her the title of "plow girl."   COOKING.  Stoves were unknown and cooking was done in a 

fireplace that was built of clay, a large iron rod was built in across the opening of the fireplace on 

which were hung pots that had special handles again to oppose and to impeach. No doubt all this 

part of the history has been immensely embellished by the patriotic imagination, the heroic 

features have been exaggerated, the harsher features softened though not suppressed. Still it is 

impossible to question the general fact. The result attests the process. The Roman legions were
