eviction it has lasted to the present hour; and eviction in Ireland is not =
like eviction in England,=20

where great manufacturing cities receive and employ the evicted; it is star=
vation or exile. Into exile=20

the Irish people have gone by millions, and thus, though neither maritime n=
or by nature colonists,=20

they have had a great share in the peopling of the New World. The cities an=

United States are to a great extent the monuments of their labour. In the p=

retained the weakness produced by ages of political serfage, and are still =

slave boat docked in the slip at Maryland and Jeff Davis and his henchmen w=

their victims. Unfortunately, his mother Anna and his father were caught on=

and gagged and taken to Jeff Davis' boat which was waiting in the harbor, a=
nd there they were put=20

into stocks. The boat stayed in port until it was loaded with Negroes, then=
 sailed for Florida where=20

Davis disposed of his human cargo.  Douglas Dorsey's parents were sold to C=
olonel Louis Matair,=20

who had a large plantation that was cultivated by 85 slaves. Colonel Matair=
's house was of the=20

pretentious southern colonial type which was quite prevalent during that pe=
riod. The colonel had=20

won his title because of his participation in the Indian War in Florida. He=
 was the typical wealthy=20

southern gentleman, and was very kind to his slaves. His wife, however was =
just the opposite. She=20

was exceedingly mean and could easily be termed a tyrant.  There were sever=

rliament took up the=20

question of the land, and effected a compromise which may perhaps have to b=
e again revised=20

before complete pacification is attained.  In another way geography has exe=
rcised a sinister=20

influence on the fortunes of Ireland. Closely approaching Scotland, the nor=
thern coast of Ireland in=20

terian Pale. If the=20

antagonism between the English Episcopalian and the Irish Catholic was stro=

Scotch Presbyterian and the Irish Catholic was stronger. To the English Epi=
scopalian the Irish=20

Catholic was a barbarian and a Romanist; to the Scotch Presbyterian he was =
a Canaanite and an=20
