boardin' schools."  "It's great to see you," said Teeny-bits. "The fellows =
here have been wonderful,=20

but of course it isn't home, you know, and I've missed you folks a lot. I w=
ish Ma _had_ come; you=20

tell her not to be so bashful next time."  Old Daniel Holbrook smiled benig=
nly. It pleased him to=20

have Teeny-bits so obviously glad to see him and so sincerely speaking of M=
a and his wish to see=20

her.  "I suppose wimmin folks _are_ a trifle more timid than men folks abou=
t putting themselves=20

forred," he remarked, "but when it comes to thoughtfulness you can't get 'e=
m beat. Now take this=20

box that she put into my hands--I don't know but what I'm entering into a c=
onspiracy to break some=20

of the rules of this school, but Ma just plain insisted that I bring it alo=
ng and I have a _faint_=20

suspicion that it contains somethin' to eat. I seen her fussin' round the k=
itchen with choc'late=20

frosted cake and some other contraptions, and from the size of the package =
I'd say she'd put most=20

of 'em in. The question is: am I breakin' any regalations if I leave it? Ju=
st say the word, and I'll take=20

it back home."  "Not on your life!" said Teeny-bits fervently. "You're not =
breaking any rules, and=20

believe me, whatever it is, it won't last very long. I've some friends arou=
nd here who would climb=20

right through the transom if they knew that there was anything like that in=
 this room."  "That being=20

the case," said the station master, "here she remains. I'll put it on the t=
able. Now tell me, how's=20

things going?"  77 as in the complete scale, but 1261 - 77 sharp, since its=
 upper termination has=20

become F, instead of E. With these variations let the same theorem be appli=
ed as before, till no=20

value of _x_ can be obtained, and the temperaments for that scale will be t=
he best adjusted=20

possible.  But as the scale which contains but 13 degrees, or 12 intervals,=
 to the octave, is in much=20

more general use than every other, we shall content ourselves with stating =
_how_ the problem=20

may be solved for scales containing any intermediate number of degrees, and=
 proceed directly to=20

the consideration of that which is so much the most practically important. =
  LEMMA.    No=20

arrangement of the intervals in the common scale of 12   degrees, which ren=
ders none of the Vths=20

or 3ds sharp, and none of   the IIIds flat, can make any change in the aggr=
egate temperaments   of=20

all the concords of the same name.  We will conceive the 12 Vths of the Dou=
zeave scale to be=20

arranged in succession, as CG, GD, DA, &c. embracing 7 octaves. Let them at=
 first be all equal:=20

they will each be flattened 49. I say that no change in these Vths which pr=
eserves the two extreme=20

octaves perfect, and renders none of them sharp, can alter the sum of their=
 temperaments. Let=20

_a_, _b_, _c_, &c. be any quantities, positive or negative, by which the po=
ints C, G, D, &c. may be=20

conceived to be raised above the corresponding points, belonging to the sch=
eme of equal Vths.=20

Then as the mean temperament Vth =3D V - 49, the first Vth in the supposed =
arrangement will be V -=20

49 + _a_. The distance from C to D will be, in like manner, 2 =C2=B7 (V - 4=
9) + _b_; and consequently the=20

Vth GD will be V - 49 + _b_ - _a_. In the same manner the third Vth=20


_
it hardly seems real. I want to tell you that there are some of the finest =
fellows in the world in this=20

dormitory, and the whole school is just O. K."  While Daniel Holbrook, sitt=
ing back comfortably in=20

Teeny-bits' spare chair, listened to the newcomer's impressions of Ridgley =
School, a bit of action=20

was beginning to develop outside on the campus. Tracey Campbell, strolling =
across to Gannett=20

Hall with Bassett and three or four other members of the school, who for on=
e reason or another=20

seemed to find pleasure in the company of the two, came in sight of the sor=
rel horse. There was=20

no question that the station master's steed was ungainly and that harnessed=
 to the old-fashioned=20

buggy he presented to persons who were straining their eyes for the ludicro=
us a more or less=20

amusing spectacle. The evening was warm and Tracey Campbell had pulled off =
his sweater. As=20

he went by the sorrel horse he gave the garment a snap which sent one of th=
e sleeves flying=20

against the animal's neck. With a snort of surprise the horse lifted his he=
ad and danced backward=20

a step or two in a manner that called forth laughter from the group of Ridg=
leyites.  "Whoa,=20

Ebeneezer!" said Campbell. "Calm yourself," And then an idea came to his mi=
nd. "Here's a chance=20

for a little moonlight ride," he said. "Who'll come along? We'll borrow thi=
s old nag for a few minutes=20

and tour the campus."  Bassett, who was ready for any excitement that offer=
ed itself, climbed into=20

the buggy after Campbell, while one of the other fellows untied the hitch-r=
ope.  "All right, we're off,"=20

said Tracey, lifting the whip from the socket and snapping it vigorously.  =
Old Jed apparently wasn't=20

accustomed to the sound or the feel of the whip, for when Campbell touched =
his flank smartly he=20

plunged forward temperament of CG =3D -49 + _a_, of GD =3D -49 + _b_ - _a_,=
 of DA =3D -49 + _c_ -=20

_b_, &c. Adding the 12 temperaments together, we find their sum    =3D -12 =
=C3=97 49 + a + b + &c. - a - b=20

- &c.  in which all the terms except the first destroy each other, and leav=
e their sum =3D -12 =C3=97 49=20

which is the aggregate temperament of the twelve equal Vths in the scheme o=
f equal semitones.=20

The same reasoning holds good if we bring these Vths within the compass of =
an octave; since, if=20

the octave be kept perfect, all the Vths on the same letter, in whatever oc=
tave they are situated,=20

must have the same temperament.  The reasoning is precisely the same for th=
e IIIds and 3ds,=20

considering the former as forming 4 distinct series of an octave each, begi=
nning with C, C, D and=20

E; and the latter as forming 3 distinct series of an octave each, beginning=
 with C, C and D. If the=20

former be made all equal, each will be sharpened 343; if the latter be made=
 equal, each will be=20

flattened 392. In every system which renders none of the former flat, and n=
one of the latter sharp,=20

the sum of their temperaments will be 12 =C3=97 343, and 12 =C3=97 392, res=
pectively.  _Cor._ The=20

demonstration holds equally true, whatever be the magnitude of _a_, _b_, _c=
_, &c.: only if they be=20

such that the difference -_a_ + _b_, -_b_ + _c_, &c. of any two successive =
ones be greater than=20

the temperament of the corresponding concord in the system of equal semiton=
es, the=20

temperament of that chord must be reckoned negative, and the _sum_, in the =
enunciation of the=20

proposition, must be considered as the excess of those temperaments which h=
ave the same sign=20

with those of the same concords in the system of equal semitones, above tho=
se which have the=20

contrary sign. Hence it is universally true that the excess of the=20


_
began to trot around the driveway that circled the campus.  "Some racer!" s=
aid Bassett. "Can't you=20

get any more speed out of him than that? I'll show you how to drive him."  =
"No, you won't," said=20

Campbell. "I can get as much speed out of him as anybody can. I'll bet you =
that if you'll get out and=20

run, I can beat you round the campus."  "How much'll you bet?" asked Basset=
t.  "Oh, I'll bet you a=20

good dinner," said Tracey.  "All right," said Bassett, and jumped over the =
side of the above the=20

sharp temperaments of the Vths is equal to 12 =C3=97 49; that the excess of=
 the sharp above the flat=20

temperaments of the IIIds is equal to 12 =C3=97 343; and that the excess of=
 the flat above the sharp=20

temperaments of the 3ds is 12 =C3=97 392. Hence likewise we have a very eas=
y method of _proving_=20

whether the temperaments of any given system have been correctly calculated=
. It is only to add=20

those which have the same sign; and if the differences of the sums be equal=
 to the products just=20


_
By this time several members of the school who were passing through the cam=
pus had paused=20

and were watching the performance. Some one called out: "Ready, get set, go=
!" and Bassett, who=20

had never been much of a runner, started out at a lumbering pace around the=
 drive. Campbell=20

immediately brought the whip down heavily upon the sorrel's back, which so =
surprised the horse=20

that instead of dashing forward in pursuit of Bassett, he did   PROPOSITION=
 IX.    If all the=20

concords of the same name, in a scale of twelve   intervals to the octave, =
were of equally frequent=20

occurrence, the   best system of temperament would be that of equal semiton=
es.  It is evidently=20

best, so far as the concords of the same name are concerned, that if of equ=
al frequency, they=20

should be equally tempered, unless by rendering them unequal, their medium =
temperament could=20

be diminished; but=20
