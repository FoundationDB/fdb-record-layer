I thought best to postpone this until after I had treated the practical merits of the materials out of 

which, when they are brought together, buildings are constructed with due regard to the proper 

kind of material for each part, and until I had shown of what natural elements those materials are 

composed. But before beginning to explain their natural properties, I will prefix the motives which 

originally gave rise to buildings and the development of inventions in this field, following in the 

steps of early nature and of those writers who have devoted treatises to the origins of civilization 

and the investigation of inventions. My exposition will, therefore, follow the instruction which I have 

received from them.     CHAPTER I  THE ORIGIN OF THE DWELLING HOUSE   1. The men of 

old were born like the wild beasts, in woods, caves, and groves, and lived on savage fare. As time 

went on, the thickly crowded trees in a certain place, tossed by storms and winds, and rubbing 

their branches against one another, caught fire, and so the inhabitants of the place were put to 

flight, being terrified by the furious flame. After it subsided, they drew near, and observing that they 

were very comfortable standing before the warm fire, they put on logs and, while thus keeping it 

alive, brought up other people to it, showing them by signs how much comfort they got from it. In 

that gathering of men, at a time when utterance of sound was purely individual, from daily habits 

they fixed upon articulate words just as these had happened to come; then, from indicating by 

name things in common use, the result was that in this chance way they began to talk, and thus 

originated conversation with one another.  2. Therefore it was the discovery of fire that This and all

the coming together of men, to the deliberative assembly, and to social intercourse. And so, as 

they kept coming together in greater numbers into one place, finding themselves naturally gifted 

beyond the other animals in not being obliged to walk with faces to the ground, but upright and 

gazing upon the splendour of the starry firmament, and also in being able to do with ease 

whatever they chose with their hands and fingers, they began in that first assembly to construct 

shelters. Some made them of green boughs, others dug caves on mountain sides, and some, in 

imitation of electronic works  1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

places of refuge out of mud and twigs. Next, by observing the shelters of others and adding new 

details to their own inceptions, they constructed better and better kinds of huts as time went on.  3. 

And since they were of an imitative and teachable nature, they would daily point out to each other 

the results of their building, boasting of the novelties in it; and thus, with their natural gifts 

sharpened by emulation, their standards improved daily. At first they set up forked stakes 

connected by twigs and covered these walls with mud. Others made walls of lumps of dried mud, 

covering them with reeds and leaves to keep out the rain and the heat. Finding that such roofs 

could not stand the rain during the storms of winter, they built them with peaks daubed with mud, 

the roofs sloping and projecting so as to carry off the rain water.  4. That houses originated as I 

have written above, we can see for ourselves from the buildings that are to this day constructed of 

like materials by foreign tribes: for instance, in Gaul, Spain, Portugal, and Aquitaine, roofed with 

oak shingles or thatched. Among the Colchians in Pontus, where there are forests in entity to

flat on the ground to the right and the left, leaving between them a space to suit the length of the 

trees, and then place above these another pair of trees, resting on the ends of the former and at 

right angles with them. These four trees enclose the space for the dwelling. Then upon these they 

place sticks of timber, one after the other on the four sides, crossing each other at the angles, and 

so, proceeding with their walls of trees laid perpendicularly above the are removed.  Of course, we
