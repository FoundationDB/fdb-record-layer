philodendron monstera reached the last limit, and that turning point where its spiritual nature had to make room for mere physical organisation--had to "fall into matter" and generation. But man's evolution and  Grimaud did not answer, but bowed a second time.  "Art thou dumb?" cried the duke.  Grimaud made a sign that he was not.  "What art thou, then? Answer! I command thee!" said the duke.

Have the gates of Death been opened to thee,     Hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of 

death?   Thus asks the "Lord," the Hierophant, the Al-om-jah, the Initiator of Job, alluding to this 

third degree of Initiation. For the _Book of Job_ is the poem of Initiation _par excellence_.  When 

the neophyte had conquered the terrors of this trial, he was conducted to the "Hall of Spirits," to be 

judged by them. Among the rules in which he was instructed, he was commanded:       Never to 

either desire or seek revenge; to be always ready to help     a brother in danger, even unto the risk 

of his own life; to bury     every dead body; to honour his parents above all; to respect old     age, 

and protect those weaker than himself; and, finally, to ever     bear in mind the hour of death, and 

that of resurrection in a new     and imperishable body.   Purity and chastity were highly 

recommended, and adultery was threatened with death. Thus the Egyptian donjon of Vincennes. 

Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration; for that which almost 

proved that he was the son of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension; he examined attentively 

the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows, thin lips, 

hooked nose, and prominent cheek-bones of Grimaud were favorable signs. He addressed about 

twelve words to him; Grimaud answered in four.  "Here's a promising fellow and it is I who have 

found out his merits," said Monsieur de Chavigny. "Go," he added, "and make yourself agreeable 

to Monsieur la Ramee, and tell him that you suit me in all respects."  Grimaud had every quality 

that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy. So, after a thousand questions 

which met with only a word in reply, La Ramee, fascinated by this sobriety in speech, rubbed his 

hands and engaged Grimaud.  "My orders?" asked Grimaud.  "They are these; never to leave

degree the mystery-name of IAO was communicated to him.  Let the reader compare the above 

sublime precepts with the precepts of Buddha, and the noble commandments in the "Rule of Life" 

for the ascetics of India, and he will understand the unity of the Secret Doctrine everywhere.  It is 

impossible to deny the presence of a sexual him every pointed or cutting instrument, and to 

prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers."  "Those are all?" asked Grimaud.  "All 

now," replied La Ramee.  "Good," answered Grimaud; and he went right to the prisoner.  The duke 

was in the act of combing his beard, which he had allowed to grow, as well as his hair,

religious symbols, but this fact is not in the least open to censure, once it becomes generally 

known that--in the religious traditions of every country--man was not born in the first "human" race 

from father and mother. From the bright "mind-born Sons of Brahma," the Rishis, and from Adam 

Kadmon with his Emanations, the Sephiroth, down to the "parentless," the Anupadaka, or the 

Dhyani-Buddhas, from whom sprang the Bodhisattvas and Manushi-Buddhas, the earthly Initiates-

-men--the first race of men was with every nation held as being born without father or mother. 

Man, the "Manushi-Buddha," the Manu, the "Enosh," son of Seth, or the "Son of Man" as he is 

called--is born in the present way only as the consequence, the unavoidable wretched appearance 

and condition. But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de 

Montbazon pass in her carriage, and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman, he did 

not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin, and in the hope of seeing her again, had 

asked for a leaden comb, which was allowed him. The comb was to be a leaden one, because his 

beard, like that of most fair people, was rather red; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it.  As 

Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea-table; he took it up, and as he took it he made a low 

bow.  The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise. The figure put the comb in its pocket. 

"Ho! hey! what's that?" cried the duke.
