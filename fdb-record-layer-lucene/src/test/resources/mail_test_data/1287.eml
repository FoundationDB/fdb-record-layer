contentment, while a blast from the bleak nor'-west shook every blackened r=
after in his little hut.=20

"Heel hee!" responded his wife, whose Indian name--translated--was Slowfoot=
, and might have=20

been Slowtongue with equal propriety, for she was quite an adept at the art=
 of silence.  She=20

frequently caused a giggle to do duty for speech.  This suited her husband =
admirably, for he was=20

fond of talking--could tell a good story, sing a good song, and express his=
 feelings in a good hearty=20

laugh.  "Yes, it will be hard for the poor boys who have gone to the plains=
, the weather is so awful,=20

to say nothing of the women."  "Ho," replied Slowfoot--though what she mean=
t to express by this=20

no mortal knows--nor, perhaps, cares.  It meant nothing bad, however, for s=
he smiled seraphically=20

and sent forth a stream of smoke, which, mingling with that just emitted by=
 her husband, rose in a=20

curling harmony to the roof.  Slowfoot was not a bad-looking woman as North=
 American Indians=20

go.  She was brown unquestionably, and dirty without doubt, but she had a p=
leasant expression,=20

suggestive of general good-will, and in the budding period of life must hav=

was evidently older than her husband, who might, perhaps, have been a littl=
e over thirty.  "I should=20
