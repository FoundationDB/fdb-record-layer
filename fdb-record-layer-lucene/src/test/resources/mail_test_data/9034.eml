For it is only in a figure of speech that art declines or prospers=E2=80=94=
it is the artists who are less proceed to the assault in person. As she wat=
ched the battle from afar, saw the French carry and burn one fort, and then=
 saw them repulsed from before another, her impatience could no longer be r=
estrained. Crossing the river with a few followers, she rallied her people,=
 who followed her charmed standard and captured the fort, which Jeanne fire=
d with her own hand.  Once more the wisdom or the expediency of her _
remains to be told of each eternal theme, and when a book comes which tells=
 the whole, which=20

satisfies some hitherto unexpressed yearnings or defines more sharply somet=
hing hitherto half-

seen, then that portrait of human nature serves our purposes until we have =
a still finer, and other=20

versions meanwhile are neglected and forgotten. We remember how many shrewd=
 use of it; but=20

they had no intention of trusting the whole campaign to spiritual direction=
, whether of saints or=20

devils; and some of them were not a little inclined to view Jeanne as hardl=
y better than a witch. It=20

might have been better for France had they trusted to the guidance of the h=
eroine. She would=20

have marched up to Orleans on the side of the=20


_
to suit us, and how many records of the journey to hell before Dante told u=
s the whole truth of that=20

pilgrimage; perhaps we know the many desperate attempts, long since mercifu=
lly swallowed up in=20

oblivion, to portray the American Indian before Fenimore Cooper made the pi=
cture the world=20

wanted. The achievements of literature are all, as in these instances, a gr=
adual reworking of=20

traditional or popular or folk material, and in the process it is precisely=
 because the subject is not=20

original that the audience can decide how well it has been portrayed. A seq=
uence of writers=20

interpreting Life are therefore like a succession of virtuosos playing the =
classics, each trying to=20

give us the true Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann. Their renderings will b=
e different enough,=20

but the music is the same, and we know it by heart. The player who calls ou=
r attention to most=20

beauty in it, will be original or unique in the only way that art permits. =
 The example of the musician=20

may not seem to all writers a fair parallel; they may protest that the writ=
er creates, as the=20

composer does, but the player only interprets what is already created. But =
they are wrong, and the=20

parallel is correct. The writer does not create as the composer does. Music=
 is an ultimate pleasure=20

in itself, like the taste of sugar; so long as it delights us, we do not as=
k what it means. Moreover,=20

since there is no question of its meaning, we may not need a previous exper=
ience to find some=20

enjoyment in it; it may be satisfactory at first contact. Of course every t=
hem, be the risk what it=20

might. By a deception she was led to cross the Loire, and was indignant whe=
n, on reaching=20

Orleans, she discovered that the river lay between her and the town.  Dunoi=
s, commander-in-chief=20

in Orleans, seeing her from the ramparts, crossed the river at once and cam=
e to give her reverent=20

and joyful greeting. After reproaching him and the other captains for placi=
ng more reliance upon=20

human prudence than upon Divine behests, she said: "I bring you the best su=
ccor that ever knight=20

or city had; it is the succor of the King of Heaven, and comes not from me,=
 but from God." It was=20

the 29th of April, and that same evening, at eight o'clock, Jeanne entered =
Orleans with provisions=20

and an escort, the main body of the army retiring to Blois to cross the Loi=
re.  Orleans went mad=20

with joy at the advent of its heaven-sent deliverer. As she rode through th=
e streets the crowds=20

blocked her way, and eager admirers rudely jostled each other in the strugg=
le but to touch the=20

horse that bore her. With sweet kindliness, she thanked them, losing none o=
f her humility, and=20

exhorting them to thank not her, but God and the dauphin. For that night an=
d the rest of her stay in=20

Orleans she was lodged with the wife of the treasurer of Charles d'Orleans,=
 and slept with one of=20

the daughters of the house. Sturdy and healthy as she was, the unaccustomed=
 rough life of the=20

camp, sleeping with her armor on and none but men about her, had occasioned=
 her great fatigue.=20

The operations of the siege had been suspended by the=20


_
appreciating it, yet the contrast between music and literature remains a re=
al one, since without any=20

knowledge of life at all men and even children often penetrate deeply into =
the heart of music, but=20

without some knowledge of life they are stopped at the very threshold of li=
terature. The key to that=20

door is some first-hand acquaintance with life. Music has no other subject-=
matter than itself, but=20

literature has life for its content, and to find one=E2=80=99s way about in=
 it, we must recognize what it is=20

dealing with. Life is a music already composed. It has been here a long tim=
e, and had become=20

already an ancient history when the first poets began to play upon it. They=
 merely said for us the=20

things we had been vainly feeling after, sullenly kept to their _bastilles_=
. Jeanne insisted upon an=20

immediate attack, and during the week that followed she was with difficulty=
 restrained from rash=20

enterprises. Indeed, she could not always be restrained, and her rashness w=
as not infrequently=20

rewarded with unexpected success. Warned of the approach of English reinfor=
cements under Sir=20

John Fastolf, she conjured Dunois to let her know without delay of his comi=
ng. She suspected=20

Dunois of intending to engage Fastolf without her, and in her nervous eager=
ness to be up and=20

doing for France she precipitated a successful attack upon the bastilles. S=
he had retired to rest for=20

a few hours in the middle of the day when the noise of a tumult in the stre=
ets aroused her; the cry=20

was=20


_
almost missed, they defined sharply the flavors and the half tastes that ha=
d haunted us. The=20

amateurs in the audience listen spellbound when the master plays to perfect=
ion a piece they have=20

struggled with; this is more to them than the loveliest of new sonatas, for=
 it is their own world in a=20

better light. So mankind will listen to the authentic poet who completes th=
eir half-realized selves;=20

and will say of him, somewhat with the woman of Samaria, =E2=80=9CHe told m=
e all the things that ever I=20

did.=E2=80=9D  If the audience enjoy the music best when they have tried to=
 play it themselves, they love it=20

next best when they have heard it often, and they like it least, sometimes =
not at all, when they=20

hear it for the first time. The reader likes poetry best when he has lived =
what it interprets; next best=20

when he has heard often of the adventures it renders; least, even to the po=
int of detestation, when=20

he never entered that region of life at all, not even by hearsay. In such a=
 predicament the real=20

ground of his objection to the art is that it is original, at being slaught=
ered at one of the gates.=20

Leaping from her couch, and hardly taking time to have half of her armor bu=
ckled on, she mounted=20

her horse and, seizing her banner as it was reached to her from a window, g=
alloped toward the=20

gates. On the way, she met the wounded and her heart was moved at the sight=
 of blood. Without=20

the authority of Dunois the garrison had undertaken an assault upon the _ba=
stille_ of Saint-Loup,=20

which stood most directly across the path of those who would bring supplies=
 into Orleans. The=20

French had been beaten back, but with the arrival of Jeanne hope and courag=
e returned. Jeanne=20

in person led a fresh assault, while Talbot, the English commander, vainly =
strove to rally his men=20

and dissipate their fears of "the witch." The English were forced to retire=
, and the fort fell into the=20

hands of Jeanne, who, lapsing at once from warrior into woman after this fi=
rst experience of an=20

actual battle, wept over the slain, cared for the wounded, and did her best=
 to protect the English=20

prisoners from her own savage followers.  The=20


_
is concerned, but the experience of his discomfort will hide the cause of i=
t from him; not himself but=20

the art will seem to him inadequate=E2=80=94is he not as much alive as any =
one ever was? The book, he=20

will say, portrays a world that is dead. Let us start fresh and be original=
; let us portray my world.   II=20

In the slow fermentation of human societies, as fresh elements work their w=
ay to the top and for a=20

time give their flavor to history, the new first active enterprise enhanced=
 Jeanne's credit in the=20

eyes of her own party. Nevertheless, the military chiefs hesitated to trust=
 her, perhaps because=20

they were jealous of her; and while she was spending Ascension day in fasti=
ng and prayer they=20

held a council at which it was determined to attack the principal English f=
ort under cover of a feint=20

upon one on the other side of Orleans. She was told only of the feigned att=
ack, but Dunois later=20
