overwhelming climax to what had already been a surfeit of misery.  This! she, Yvonne, cowering 

beside her dead father, with no one to stand between her and any insult, any outrage which might 

be put upon her, with nothing now but a few laths between her and that yelling, screeching mob 

outside.  Oh! the loneliness! the utter, utter loneliness!  She kissed the inert hand, the pale 

forehead: with gentle, reverent fingers she tried to smooth out those lines of horror and of fear 

which gave such a pitiful expression to the face. Of all the wrongs which her father had done her 

she never thought for a moment. It was he who had brought her to this terrible pass: he who had 

betrayed her into the hands of her deadliest enemy: he who had torn her from the protecting arms 

of her dear milor and flung her and himself at the mercy of a set of inhuman wretches who knew 

neither compunction nor pity.  But all this she forgot, as she knelt beside the lifeless form--the last 

thing on earth that belonged to her--the last protection to which she might have clung.   II  Out of 

the confusion of sounds which came--deadened by the intervening partition--to her ear, it was 

impossible to distinguish anything very clearly. All that Yvonne could do, as soon as she had in a 

measure collected her scattered senses, was to try and piece together the events of the last few 

minutes--minutes which indeed seemed like days and even years to her.  Instinctively she gave to 

the inert hand which she held an additional tender touch. At any rate her father was out of it all. He 

was at rest and at peace. As for the rest, it was in God's hands. Having only herself to think of 

now, she ceased to care what became of her. He was out of it all: and those wretches after all 

could not do more than kill her. A complete numbness of senses and of mind had succeeded the 

feverish excitement of the past few hours: whether hope still survived at this moment in Yvonne its 

occupants, but reflected the golden glory of the sun, and mirrored every fleecy cloudlet in the 

bright blue sky.  A mere dip of the paddles now and then served to give impulse to the light, and 

literal, bark. Genial warmth pervaded the atmosphere, and little white gulls floated almost 

motionless on outspread wings, or sloped hither and thither with lazy flap, while ever and anon the 

whistling wings of passing wild-fowl gave promise of occupation to their guns, to say nothing of 

their kettles.  On their third day out, towards evening, they went ashore on the lee-side of a rocky 

point where some bushes and trees seemed to offer firewood and shelter.  "This will do," said 

Dan, as he stepped lightly out on a shelving rock and held the canoe while his companion took out 

the lading.  "Plenty dry sticks and lots of moss for bedding."  "Truly, that is so," returned La Certe. 

"It is a place in which Slowfoot would rejoice to repose, and the little one to smoke its pipe."  "You 

forget," said Dan.  "The little one is no longer allowed that luxury."  "No, I forgot not.  But I reflect 

that it is possible to give her many a draw on the sly."  The fire was soon kindled, ducks were 

roasting in front of it, and the kettle boiling above it.  The tea had been infused, and La Certe, 

while filling his pipe, was blinking good-will at all around, when the notes of a voyageur-song were 

heard like an echo in the far distance.  Gradually the song grew louder, and soon a canoe rounded 

the point, and came in sight of the camp-fire.  It was what used to be called a north-canoe, of the 

largest size, made of birch-bark, and contained a crew of ten men.  The song and the paddling 

stopped simultaneously when the camp was observed, and the men appeared to hold a 

consultation.  Their hesitation, however, was very brief.  Suddenly, breaking again into song, they 

ran the canoe to shore, and landed.  "We are bound for Red River," said their 


_
Certain it is that it lay dormant--buried beneath the overwhelming misery of her loneliness.  She 

took the fichu from her shoulders and laid it reverently over the dead man's face: she folded the 

hands across the breast. She could not cry: she could only pray, and that quite mechanically.  The 

thought of her dear milor, of his clever friend, of the message which she had received in prison, of 

the guide who had led her to this awful place, was relegated--almost as a memory--in the 

furthermost cell of her brain.   III  But after awhile outraged nature, still full of vitality and of youth, 

re-asserted itself. She felt numb and cold and struggled to her feet. From somewhere close to her 

a continuous current of air indicated the presence of some sort of window. Yvonne, faint with the 

close and sickly smell, which even that current failed to disperse, felt her way all round the walls of 

the narrow landing.  The window was in the wall between the partition and the staircase, it was 

small and quite low down. It was crossed with heavy iron bars. Yvonne leaned up against it, 

grateful for the breath of pure Canada.  We suppose you don't object to our camping beside you. 

It is a convenient spot."  Of course the two hunters had no objection whatever to fraternise with the 

strangers from Canada, and in a short time another large fire was sending its myriad sparks up 

into the darkening sky like a gigantic roman-candle.  During supper the strangers made 

themselves very agreeable.  After supper, two of the stoutest of them arose, as if to go into the 

bush for more firewood.  Suddenly these threw themselves upon and seized Dan and his 

comrade, who were reclining quietly on the ground.  Before either could make even an attempt at 

self-defence they were overpowered by the Canadians, and held forcibly down, while their arms 

were securely bound to their sides with strips of deerskin.  "It is useless to struggle, Dan 

Davidson," said the chief, when this was being accomplished.  "We know you as a bitter opponent 

of the Nor'-westers, and we intend to carry you where your power to do mischief will be ended." 

"Who are you? and under whose authority do you act?" demanded Dan, angrily.  "Who I am is a 

matter of no 


_
For awhile yet she remained unconscious of everything save the confused din which still went on 

inside the tavern, and at first the sounds which came through the grated window mingled with 

those on the other side of the partition. But gradually as she contrived to fill her lungs with the cold 

breath of heaven, it seemed as if a curtain was being slowly drawn away from her authority, and I 

may just as well tell you, at the beginning, that if you and your comrade choose to submit 

peaceably, we will treat you reasonably well;--if not, we will find means to quiet you, even though 

we should be driven to do it wi' that."  The man pointed significantly to a gun which leant against a 

neighbouring tree.  His meaning could not be misunderstood.  That night,
