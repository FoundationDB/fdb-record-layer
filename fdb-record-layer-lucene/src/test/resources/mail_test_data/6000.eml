philodendron monstera breath, counting "One--two--three--four--five--six--s=
even--"  He had reached twenty when there came a roar. "Oh! Too bad! That o=
ne missed!" Hardly were the words out of his mouth when there came a second=
 roar. "Right on the beam! Boy! Oh an indeterminate, because variable, numb=
er of feet we get such marks as individual shot may make. This distance is =
indeterminate because it is predicated on the size of the gun, the dimensio=
ns of shot, and the weight of the charge of philodendron monstera breath, c=

 Oh an indeterminate, because variable, number of feet we get such marks as=
 individual shot may make. This distance is indeterminate because it is pre=
dicated on the size of the gun, the dimensions of shot, and the weight of t=
he charge of _
from it for a space of seconds, then rocketed downward.  "Shot off his moto=
r!" Jack exulted.  Stew=20

did not hear. His mind was still on the task before him. The rain squall wa=
s over. He spotted the=20

two groups of enemy ships, also some small islands off to the east. With a =
strange sense of finality=20

coursing through his being, he reported all this to the _Black Bee's_ radio=
man. As he listened after=20

that, he thought he heard the low rumble of many distant planes. He could n=
ot be sure; too much=20

was going on directly beneath them.  Continuing his magnificent circles, Te=
d came up behind the=20

very Zero that seconds before had been following him. He let out a burst of=
 fire. Smoking badly,=20

the Zero limped into a cloud.  "Now! Now we've got to get down there!" Jack=
 tilted his plane for a=20

steep dive, then set his motor at top speed.  The two remaining Zeros were =
closing in on Ted. At=20

the same time three others were swinging in on him from the left. The three=
 were flying in=20

formation, rather far apart.  "Get ready with your twinflex," Jack ordered.=
 "We'll go right into that=20

trio and break it up."  Did the Japs see them coming? No matter. They came =
in too fast for the=20

Japs to dodge. At just the right instant Jack pulled up short, then let out=
 a burst of fire that cut=20

squarely across the lead plane of the Japs.  At the same time Stew swung hi=
s twinflex gun on the=20

second plane and let him have it for all he was worth.  What happened after=
 that came so quickly=20

that it remained a blur in Jack's memory. Afterward he seemed to recall see=
ing two Jap planes=20

falling, and Ted, with a damaged plane, disappearing into a cloud. At the s=
ame time something=20

had creased his the skull. The rifle when tested at the Government Arsenal =
showed a mean=20

velocity of 999 feet per second. Had it been as high as was supposed by the=
 defence, namely,=20

1,300 or 1,400 feet, the argument that a bullet driven with this force woul=
d always go through the=20

skull would have more weight, but with the velocity found by actual test th=
e energy of the ball was=20

lessened to nearly one-half of that supposed. The bullet which killed Mrs. =
Billings did not pass=20

entirely through the skull. It ploughed into the opposite side and broke be=
fore it a triangular piece=20

of bone which broke the skin externally. This shows the resistance of exter=
nal fascia against=20

perforation. A study of the lines of fracture in this particular case prove=
d very interesting, but=20

perhaps would be somewhat irrelevant here. A measurement of the skull and o=
f the bullet-track=20

through it shows the former to have been of more than ordinary thickness an=
d density, and the=20

channel ploughed in the bone by the bullet along the base of it to have bee=
n nearly two inches in=20

length. Dr. Balch gives the following conclusions to his very interesting e=
vidence: 1st. A leaden ball=20

passing through bone loses lead in proportion to the amount of bone travers=
ed. 2d. If the petrous=20

portion of the temporal bone be the part struck by the ball and struck squa=
rely at the base, that=20

portion of the bone is crumbled or broken in such exceedingly fine pieces a=
s to defy restoration.=20

3d. That if the ball struck any part of the skull the petrous portion will =
be broken, but can be usually=20

recognized and generally put together again. 4th. That a ball of given cali=
bre fired through glass=20

may make a hole enough smaller=20


_
instant, then he was all right again.  "They got our radio!" Stew reported.=
  "She doesn't steer right!"=20

Jack headed her into a cloud.  "Well, that's that," Stew sighed. "No radio.=
 No more work for us."=20

Jack scarcely listened. He was hearing a rumble. It came from the west. "Bo=
mbers! Our bombers!"=20

he exclaimed.  "Our work is finished!" Stew exulted.  "All but getting back=
. And that we can't do."=20

There was an air of finality in Jack's voice. "That Jap did plenty to this =
plane. Nearly got me too.=20

Take a look at my right temple."  Stew leaned forward, then whistled. "Burn=
ed you, all right.=20

Bleeding a little. Wait. I'll fix you up."  They circled slowly in their cl=
oud while first aid was applied.=20

"There are some islands off to the east," Stew suggested.  "How far?"  "'Bo=
ut fifty miles."  "Good!=20

That's our best bet."  "Then what are we waiting for?"  "Nothing." Jack an =
unfired ball of like calibre=20

passing.  In all this kind of experimentation upon cadavers for the purpose=
 of eliciting evidence by=20

reproducing as nearly as possible ante-mortem injuries, we must not forget =
that Casper has=20

strongly insisted that =E2=80=9Cit is extremely difficult to break up the o=
rganic cohesion of dead organs.... If=20

we endeavor to fracture the skull of a dead adult we shall find that an amo=
unt of force which if=20

applied in life would indubitably produce fissures if not fracture, or comp=
lete crushing of the skull,=20

leaves the dead skull quite uninjured.... The most powerful blows struck do=
wn upon the body, laid=20

down horizontally, were without result, and only after repeated violent blo=
ws were we able to=20

produce perhaps one or a few fissures in the occipital or parietal bone, or=
 in the temporal bone=20

(squamous portion), and usually in the latter. We were=20


_
"What about the Zeros?" Stew asked.  "It's a chance we have to take," Jack =
replied soberly. "This=20

old kite won't stay up too long. Be prepared to give them the works if they=
 show up."  "The works it=20

shall be," Stew replied grimly as he reloaded his powerful weapon.=20

CHAPTER V                               A GOOD SHOW   The Zeros, it seemed,=
 were engaged=20

elsewhere. When Jack and Stew emerged from their cloud none were in sight, =
nor were the=20

islands that Stew had seen.  "A rain squall has hidden the islands. They're=
 there, all the same,"=20

Stew insisted.  "It's our only chance." In vain Jack tried to get more powe=
r from his disabled motor.=20

It coughed, sputtered--all but died--then carried on.  Heading due east, he=
 started to climb. He had=20

gained a thousand feet or more when he began losing again.  "Look over your=
 parachute," he said=20

to Stew. "Be sure you can get hold of our complete smashing of the skull or=
 fissures of its base,=20

even in one single instance. The dead skull seems to have considerably more=
 power of resistance,=20

and after its removal fissures of the bone were more easily produced by sim=
ilar blows=E2=80=9D (Vol. I., p.=20

245). And again: =E2=80=9CThe result of my experiments on the dead body in =
regard to gunshot wounds=20

could only be to make more complete the proof of the resistance of the dead=
 corporeal tissues, in=20

contradistinction to the tissues when alive. After I had already learned th=
is peculiarity from my=20

experiments with contused wounds, this peculiar resistent property was foun=
d to be confirmed in a=20

most remarkable manner=E2=80=9D (=E2=80=9CForensic Medicine,=E2=80=9D Vol. =
I., p. 271).  If the number of bullets known to=20

have been fired, or, more important still, which have been found exceeds th=
e number which could=20

have been discharged from the weapon in question, a very large element of d=
oubt and=20


_
moment."  "It's all done," said Stew. "All in order. Let's have a look at y=
our chute." He worked over=20

Jack's chute and harness. "It's okay. Be sure to pull the cord," he joked. =
"That's always a=20

necessity, you know."  "Sure I know," Jack's voice was cheerful. "I'm glad =
we got our job done=20

before this thing happened."  "The sea's fairly smooth. We'll get on. Some =
kind of a bird will light=20

on us. They always do--booby, gull--something."  "Sure, they light on anyth=
ing that stands out=20

above the water." Jack set his ship climbing again. They were inside the ra=
in squall. From not too=20

far away came the sound of sudden battle.  "Zeros and our fighters have tan=
gled." Stew became=20

tremendously excited. "Boy! This is going to be terrific! Wish we could see=
 it!"  "Like taking in a=20

world-series game from behind a high board fence," Jack agreed. "But leave =
it to our bombers!"=20

"They're sure good! They took that other carrier we discovered a week ago."=
  "They're tops, those=20

bombers!" Jack had a great love for his circumstantial evidence. Should two=
 different weapons be=20

in question, it is very necessary to establish from which of them the bulle=
ts have been discharged.=20

This can be done mainly by weight and evident calibre of the bullets, or so=
me other peculiarity;=20

possibly in disputed cases even by analysis of the metal.  =3DWounds by Sho=
t-Guns.=3D=E2=80=94In most of=20

what has been said it has been supposed that the injury has been inflicted =
by an arm of the kind=20

commonly described under the terms pistol, revolver, or rifle. Gunshot woun=
ds are, however,=20

occasionally inflicted with shot-guns and a charge of shot varying in size =
from small bird-shot up to=20

that generally known as buck-shot. It is characteristic of such missiles th=
at they separate after their=20

discharge from the gun, and a determination of the degree of their separati=
on is approximately a=20

determination of the distance of the mark from the muzzle of the weapon. In=
 suicide or accidental=20

discharges of a shot-gun the muzzle is so near the body that the charge of=
=20


_
her men. "There never was a carrier like the _Black Bee_!"  The roar of bom=
bers coming on in=20

formation filled the air.  "They're climbing! I can tell by the sound!" Ste=
w exclaimed. "Boy! Just you=20

wait!"  Stew all but stood up in his place while Jack divided his attention=
 between the bombers and=20

his disabled motor.  "Now!" Stew exclaimed at last. "Now bore of the gun, a=
nd near wounds thus=20

inflicted, while necessarily large, have about them a minimum laceration an=
d disturbance of tissue,=20

so that perhaps only by their size could one say, viewing the wound alone, =
that the weapon used=20

had been a shot-gun. On the other hand, at a distance of a few feet the sho=
t begin to separate to=20

such an extent that=20
