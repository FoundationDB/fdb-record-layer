  Late studies as to the cause and mechanism of _asphyxia by submersion_ or=
 drowning warrant our _
religion, including the Kabalistically instructed Jews. To understand its f=
ull meaning, however,=20

necessitates, first of all, belief in Reincarnation and all its mysteries; =
not as laid down in the=20

doctrine of the French Reincarnationists of the Allan Kardec school, but as=
 they are expounded=20

and taught by Esoteric Philosophy. Man must, in short, know who he was, bef=
ore he arrives at=20

knowing what he is. And how many are there among Europeans who are capable =
of developing=20

within themselves an absolute belief in their past and future reincarnation=
s, in general, even as a=20

law, let alone mystic knowledge of one's immediately precedent life? Early =
education, tradition and=20

training of thought, everything is opposing itself during their whole lives=
 to such a belief. Cultured=20

people have been brought up in that most pernicious idea that the wide diff=
erence found between=20

the units of one and the same mankind, or even race, is the result of chanc=
e; that the gulf between=20

man and man in their respective social positions, birth, intellect, physica=
l and mental capacities--

every one of which qualifications has a direct influence on every human lif=
e--that all this is simply=20

due to blind hazard, only the most pious among them finding equivocal conso=
lation in the idea that=20

it is "the will of God." They have never analysed, never stopped to think o=
f the depth of the=20

opprobrium that is thrown upon their God, once the grand and most equitable=
 law of the manifold=20

re-births of man upon this earth is foolishly rejected. Men and women anxio=
us to be regarded as=20

Christians, often truly and sincerely trying to lead a Christ-like life, ha=
ve never paused to reflect=20

over the words of their own _Bible_. "Art thou Elias?" the Jewish priests a=
nd Levites asked the=20

Baptist.(109) Their Saviour taught His disciples this grand truth of the Es=
oteric Philosophy, but=20

verily, if His Apostles comprehended it, no one else seems to have realised=
 its true meaning. No;=20

not even Nicodemus, who, to the assertion: "Except a man be born again(110)=
 he cannot see the=20

Kingdom of God," answers: "How can a man be born when he is old?" and is fo=
rthwith reproved by=20

the remark: "Art thou a master in Israel and contained some of the grain; s=

periods that mark the sequence of ideas touching the subject.  Mooted quest=
ions relative to=20

drowning have been debated since the fourteenth century; and modern statist=
ics show the great=20

development of this class of emergency, than which none is of more startlin=
g character. In France=20

between four and five thousand cases of this kind of accident are officiall=
y recognized each year,=20

which is about one-third of all the accidental deaths, and the number appea=
rs to increase yearly.=20

Nearly the same figures apply to the inland waters of England and Wales, no=
t including the coast.=20

The Board of Trade Return shows that out of 86,695 seamen who died in Engli=
sh ships abroad,=20

53,673 were drowned, and a late report of the Fisherman=E2=80=99s Federatio=
n places the number=20

drowned in the inland waters and upon the immediate coasts of the United Ki=
ngdom and its=20



adjacent islands as 6,268 annually. The many hundreds drowned in the late _=
Victoria_ disaster=20

and in the great storm that swept the British Isles are matters of current =
knowledge. In our own=20

manifold re-births than the answer given by Jesus to the Sadducees, "who de=
ny that there is any=20

 the flesh is now regarded=20
