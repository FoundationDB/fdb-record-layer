Sidenote: THE VALUE OF MODESTY]  I have said that it is not your fault that=
 you were not born in the purple. Neither is it of your merit and to your h=
onor that you now walk in silk attire, and may freely _
happiness. Therefore the Silence when properly used re-harmonizes our bodie=
s and minds=20

through the simple agency of right thinking.  "There are steps of approach =
to the Silence. Stillness=20

is one thing and the Silence is another. One may quiet himself physically a=
nd not be still, and he=20

may be still without entering the Silence. When one becomes physically and =
mentally at rest, he is=20

apt to become receptive to psychic influences; and when these are not desir=
ed it is advisable to=20

protect oneself while mentally negative. One may affirm his Oneness with Go=
d, his being=20

surrounded and protected by the divine Goodness, and may symbolize this by =
enveloping himself=20

in thought with the white light of love or the mellowed tints of sunshine. =

and unresponsive to the slower vibrations, but responsive to the quicker on=

[Sidenote: HELP FROM BOOKS]  There are manuals of etiquette which will keep=
 you from open=20

solecisms in social usages. Follow their rules obediently, curbing all disp=
osition to originality=E2=80=94for a=20

while, at least. If possible, keep the greedy society reporter at a distanc=
e, without angering her. Do=20

not give away the list of those invited, much less the menu. As Dick Fansha=
we=E2=80=99s eulogist said of=20

men who =E2=80=9Cjump upon their mothers,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CSome do=
es, you know!=E2=80=9D Some even send in to the=20

newspapers unsolicited descriptions of their entertainments with lists of g=
uests, to the amusement=20

of the editorial office.  These mistakes give occasion to the aforementione=
d cartoonists and joke-

venders to deride the name of hospitality dispensed by the Newlyrich=20

greater ones, which are always seeking avenues of expression. With the grea=
ter influx of the One=20

Life, a sense of power steals over one and he becomes conscious of increase=

"In relinquishing specific thoughts, one opens inwardly rather than outward=
ly, and becomes=20

receptive to subconscious impressions that are directed by his conscious af=
firmation of=20

fundamental Truth. The subconscious responds by returning to the conscious =
the logical=20

sequences of the Truths that have been consciously impressed upon it. The s=
ubconscious follows=20

the lead given to it by the conscious affirmations of Truth, and it brings =
back the consciousness of=20

those Truths in their various ramifications."     Health Silence  Select on=
e or more of the=20

affirmations or formulas below to hold in thought while in the Silence. You=
 may change or vary=20

these as you choose:       Soul is health, spirit is health, God is health,=
 I am      health. Since there=20

is but one mind, there is but one      mentality. This mind and mentality i=
s God; God is health. I=20

am health.       "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious=
      and happy and what I=20

am myself I desire for everyone else."       "I am filled with the abundant=
, intelligent, ever-present=20

life of      Spirit. It flows through me freely, cleansing, healing, purify=
ing      and vitalizing every part.=20

I am one with this life and in it I am      every whit whole."       "The a=
ll-powerful Christ Mind in me=20

dissolves and dissipates      every adverse thought. My body is the pure an=
d Holy Temple of=20

the Living God, and every organ and every function is now      in Divine Or=
der and Harmony."=20

All the organs of my body are functioning normally and I am      well, whol=
e and complete.       All is=20

mind, all is God, all is universal energy. I am part      of creative force=
 and I am health, abundance,=20

joy and peace.       I am filled, I am thrilled with Life Eternal and I rad=
iate      that life within to me=20

and without to all.       Every experience of my life has been for my good =
and I am      happy in=20

living.       God is Spirit. I (use your own name) am life. Life Spirit is =
     now flowing through me=20

freely and I am well, whole and      complete.       "Be still and know tha=
t I am God."  USE THE=20

FOLLOWING AS A BASIS FOR YOUR MEDITATION AS YOU DEMONSTRATE HEALTH. OF=20

COURSE, YOU MAY USE OTHER THOUGHTS PROVIDED THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIVE=20

HEALTH THOUGHTS.  You may practice the Silence sitting, reclining, or in be=
d.  There is no=20

better way to learn how to relax than by going into the Silence. Are you te=
nse? Let go. Relax.=20

Then direct the mind to go from one part of the body to another. Take a dee=
p breath between each=20

change of your consciousness. Be sure to use the diaphragmatic or abdominal=
 breathing--

breathing through the nostrils, mouth closed until the muscles of the abdom=
en expand.  The best=20

time to hold the Silence is as you retire at night, and just as you awaken =
in the morning.[2] But you=20

should hold your thought at least three times a day, without stress or stra=
in, without doubt or=20

worry, passive in mind and body--perfectly relaxed.  Hold the Silence or th=
ought upon retiring at=20

night, awakening in the morning, and at noon day. Of course, with obedience=
, but not with servile=20

and unthinking obedience. Unfortunately, it is true that the person unaccus=
tomed to precise social=20

regulations and to a formal manner of living, is inclined to consider the r=
ules governing such life as=20

arbitrary, inexplicable and mysterious. If the uninitiated woman will disab=
use herself of this idea,=20

she has taken a long step in the right direction. Once you accept the fact =
that there is reason=20

behind the forms employed by society, it will not be long before you will b=
e searching for the=20

reason itself. The laws governing the conventional world will then acquire =
for you a meaning that=20

will make adherence to them simple and natural, instead of stiff and mechan=
ical.         *       *       *=20

properly in questions=20



of taste is a thing much more difficult to learn than the set and definite =
rules governing definite=20

exigencies of social life. Yet taste,=E2=80=94taste in clothes, taste in th=
e objects surrounding one, taste in=20

all matters with which expenditure is concerned,=E2=80=94this is a necessit=
y in the attainment of any social=20

position worthy of the name. In this direction something may be gained by o=
bservation, though not=20

until the eye is sufficiently trained to make it a trustworthy guide. The s=
ense of beauty is somewhat=20

a matter of cultivation, and its application to every-day life is the resul=
t of experience and=20

judgment. Do not imagine that a color is becoming to you merely because you=
 happen to like it. Do=20

not buy a chair or a couch simply because the one or the other may happen t=
o please your fancy.=20

The color you wear, the furniture you buy must have reference, the one to y=
our appearance, the=20

other to its surroundings.  [Sidenote: CONSULTING AUTHORITIES]  When one is=
 unversed in=20

these matters it is best to submit problems to an authority. It is wiser to=
 allow a clever modiste to=20

select the color, style and material of one=E2=80=99s gown than to do it on=
e=E2=80=99s self. It is better to put the=20

scheme of decoration for your house into the hands of some accomplished per=
son, educated to=20

that end, than to attempt it yourself. In large cities persons competent in=
 this matter of household=20

decoration may easily be found, people whose business it is to act as paid =
agents of the more=20

beautiful and esthetic way. Many architects have in their employ persons wh=
o are capable of=20

advising as to interior decoration and of superintending the work. If one i=
s resident in a small=20

place, the difficulty is obviated by the intelligent aid offered to the que=
stioner through the columns=20

of the better magazines devoted to esthetics as applied to every-day living=
. The advice given in=20

the best of these publications is conscientious, careful, expert advice.   =
      *       *       *       *       *=20

One especial point in house-furnishing is worth noting. Do not crowd your b=
eautiful Oriental rugs=20

together, but leave a surface of polished floor about each. Rugs are floor =
pictures and should have=20

frames as well as wall pictures do. The effect of putting them close upon o=
ne another, though seen=20

in many houses otherwise well ordered, is inartistic.  [Sidenote: AS TO LIO=
N-HUNTING]  Mrs.=20

Newlyrich is frequently criticized for her=20


_
is convenient. You may concentrate on the roadway, street car, home or offi=
ce, but it is well, if=20

possible, to have one room for your Silence. Most people in that way will b=
uild up stronger=20

vibrations. At noon now there are all over the world thousands of others ho=
lding Silence so that=20

there is a great combined mental force working lion-hunting. This is not al=
ways fair. If she hunt=20

because of the glory she hopes to heap on herself, she deserves ridicule, b=
ut if she do it in the=20

spirit of genuine appreciation and a desire to give rare pleasure to her fr=
iends she performs a real=20

service to art and to society and merits praise for her courage and kindnes=
s, not=20

e benefit of this great=20

vibration.  The more often you hold the Silence without stress or strain, a=
s a rule, the quicker may=20

be the demonstration.  The real part of me is Spirit, not matter. I believe=
 that this body of mine is a=20

*       *       *       *       *  If the woman who is now wealthy was once=
 a trained nurse or a=20

matter, sensible people will respect her for having been honorably employed=
. If she tries to hide=20

the truth,=20


_
therefore Spirit. The real "me" is Spirit.  This Spirit is the God Spirit. =
This is what Jesus meant=20

when in the fourteenth chapter of John and again in the seventeenth chapter=
 of the same Gospel,=20

speaking to His Disciples He referred to "I in you, you in Me and We in God=
."  My Spirit is a part of=20
