pale and languid,=20

made no effort to silence her, and her father seemed rather to encourage he=

remarks for the entertainment of several gentlemen friends.  A little bored=
 by the evident self-

advertisement of these rival belles, Irene moved away with Vincent to a qui=
eter corner of the deck.=20

She was to see more of them soon, however. They both disembarked when the s=
teamer reached=20

Fossato, their luggage was piled upon the carriages, and she watched them d=
rive away up the=20

steep, narrow road that led into the town.  The Beverleys had decided to ha=
ve an early lunch at=20

the hotel by the quay before taking Irene to school. It was their last meal=
 together, so she was=20

allowed to choose the menu, and regaled the family on hitherto unknown Ital=
ian dishes, winding up=20

with coffee, ices, and chocolates.  "I'm glad you don't cater for us every =
day, Renie, or I should=20

soon be ruined," said Father, as the waiter brought him the bill. "Now are =
you ready? If we don't=20

hurry and get you up quickly to school we shall miss the boat back to Naple=
s. Another package of=20

chocolates! You unconscionable child! Well, put it in your pocket and conso=
le yourself with it at=20

bedtime. The concierge says our _vetturino_ is waiting--not that any Italia=
n coachman minds doing=20

that! All the same, time is short and we had better make a start."  In that=
 first drive through the=20

narrow, steep, stone-paved streets of Fossato Irene was too excited to take=
 in any details except a=20

general impression of rich, foreign color and high, white walls. Afterwards=
, when she little canvas,=20

artist as Van Ruiter,=20

mills' and is, I hope,=20

known to most of you by reputation. What shall we say for this, ladies and =
gentlemen?"=20

"Sevenpence," said a humourist.  "Mr. Archer is pleased to be amusing," sai=
d Ginger with more=20

than his usual asperity. "Mr. Archer says seven-pence. Well, I'll say five =
guineas. Any advance on=20

five guineas, ladies and gentlemen? Going, going--"  Now I shouldn't have t=
hought there were=20

sixteen shillings left in the bazaar grounds outside the stall boxes. But b=
efore the hammer showed=20

nds."  It was Mrs.=20

Newman. She is worth anything between five and six figures, and hunts the a=
ntique=20

indiscriminately.  Ginger bowed comprehendingly and began talking again.  "=
Ladies and=20

gentlemen, six pounds offered for a _signed_ Van Ruiter. Look, you can see =
the signature. Is this=20

to go at six pounds? There's no reserve. Van Ruiter's 'Two Windmills' going=
 at six pounds. Any=20

king on waveringly. He=20

is a man of no taste at all except it be in the matter of old brandy; but h=
e hates Mrs. Newman and=20

he wavered no longer.  "Six guineas," he said.  "Seven pounds," said Mrs. N=
ewman.  "Guineas,"=20

growled Sir Robert.  "Eight pounds," said Mrs. Newman.  "Guineas," from Sir=
 Robert.  "Ten=20

pounds," said Mrs. Newman more shrilly.  "Guineas." Sir Robert was now well=
 set and looked=20

good for a century.  Mrs.=20


_
She felt as one in a dream when the carriage turned through a great gate, a=
nd passed along an=20

avenue of orange trees to a large, square house, color-washed pink, and app=
roached by a flight of=20

marble steps. What happened next she could never clearly recall. She rememb=
ered the agony of a=20

short wait in the drawing-room until Miss Rodgers arrived, how the whole pa=
rty, was to break the=20

spell. She set her teeth.  "Fifteen pounds," she said through them.  "Guine=
as," said Sir Robert with=20

his unfailing originality.  Amid furious but suppressed excitement the stru=
ggle went on. It was only=20

at seventy-five pounds that Sir Robert began to feel silly and the prize fe=
ll to Mrs. Newman.  "I=20

 departing wheels,=20

and a sudden overwhelming sensation that, for the first time in her life, s=
he was alone in a foreign=20

land. Foreign and yet familiar, for the Villa Camellia was a skillful combi=
nation of the best out of=20

several countries. Its setting was Italian, its decorations were French, an=

rwards I approached=20

Ginger.  "_Was_ that a genuine Van Ruiter, really?" I asked.  "Sure," said =
Ginger carelessly.  "But-

-er--" I asked, "who is Van Ruiter? What's his school? I don't know much ab=
out these Dutchmen."=20

"Van Ruiter," said Ginger severely, "is a painter in oils. His work has bee=
n known to fetch as much=20

as seventy-five pounds. As for his school,=20
