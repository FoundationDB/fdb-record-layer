will be wasted; and in August we'll suspend Standing Orders, and ram throug=

water nearest to the fire is first heated, and (being heated) rises to the =
top. Its place is supplied by=20

colder portions, which are heated in turn, and this interchange takes place=
 till all the water is=20

boiling hot. That is how we shall get through the Session. The Report of th=
e Parnell Commission,=20

being most heated, will rise to the top first. Then the Tithes Bill, Land P=
urchase, the Education=20

question, and one or two other little matters will follow, till we're all i=

opened.         *       *       *       *       *  KILLING FOR A SHILLING.-=
-Lord WOLSELEY (who seems=20

to have read the regulations governing communications from soldiers to the =
Press in a very liberal=20

spirit) has published an article on the British Army in the pages of an Ame=
rican Twelvepenny=20

Magazine. The contribution is embellished with sketches of the costumes of =
TOMMY ATKINS and=20

his predecessors. For the rest, some of the letterpress is sufficiently ala=
rming to warrant "Our Only=20

General" in assuming a title which he apparently appears to covet--that of =
a "Shilling Shocker!"=20

*       *       *       *       *  SOMETHING LIKE A DINNER.  [Illustration:=
 Vol au Vent.]  Now that the=20

Parliamentary Session has opened, and the Season threatens to set in with i=
ts usual severity, the=20

dinner question comes prominently to the front. Even in the best-regulated =
households there is a=20

sameness about dinner which, towards the end of the week, palls upon the ap=
petite. Some=20

ambitious young men have attempted to deal with the matter and surprise the=
ir guests by=20

introducing cheese immediately after the soup (_souffle au parmesan_), and =
after a cut of beef=20

comes the fish (_turbot a la Russe_). That is well meant, but it is crude. =
_Mr. Punch_ has given his=20

great mind to the subject, and presents to the consideration of the dining =
world the following hints=20

for a meal:--    Half-om-half.   Blauwe Landtongsche Oesters.   Hoog-Sauter=
neswijn.   Soepen.=20

Dikke Rivierkreeften Soep.     Volmaakte Soep in Van Dijk Stijl.   Amontill=
ado.   Zuschotelles.=20

Selderij.  Olijven.  Radijs.  Haringen.  Poukenvorm gebakken   in Berg-op-Z=
oomsche Stijl.=20

Liebfraumilch.   Gekruide Gerechten.   Gestreepte Baars, Piet Hein Stijl.  =
Lambasteien met=20

Zeeuwsche Saus.   Chateau Danzac.   Voorgerechten.   Hoenden Vleugels, met =
Haagsche Saus.=20

Heetkoudegemakten Ganzenlevers in Zwolsche Stijl.   Ruinart, wrang wijn, Bi=
jzonder Perrier=20

Jouet, Louis Roederer, wrang,   Giesler & Co., G. H. Mumm, buitengewoondroo=
g.   Groenten.=20

Aardappelen in Sneeksche Stijl.   Doperwten, Fransche Queen of England, and=
, in failure of heirs=20

of her body, upon her husband, Henry V. of England. The two nations were to=
 be merged, each=20

retaining its distinctive laws, but both were to be under the rule of Engli=
sh sovereigns, and Henry=20

was to aid in restoring peace and in destroying "the rebels" under Charles,=
 "called the Dauphin."=20

One of the bribes paid to Isabeau for selling the kingdom of her son was a =
pension; for we find an=20

ordinance of Henry, "heir and regent of France," granting to the queen the =
sum of two thousand=20

francs per month.  Isabeau's enjoyment of her pension was not destined to b=
e of long=20

continuance. The brilliant Henry V. died on August 31, 1422; and less than =
two months later died=20

Charles VI., _le bien aime_. During thirty of the forty-two years of his re=
ign he had been=20

incapacitated by madness or by idiocy, and in the intervals France had been=
 worse misgoverned=20

than ever before in her history; so that, with wars foreign and domestic an=
d with the shameless=20



extravagance of the court, the kingdom had been reduced to a deplorable sta=
te, scores dying in=20

the streets of Paris of sheer hunger while the English king was spending hi=
s first triumphant winter=20

in that city. For all these evils and miseries the people placed the blame =
where, in good truth, it=20

belonged, on the queen and the royal princes. For the mad king there was no=
thing but a=20

compassionate love, a tender sympathy; the people pitied this kindly unfort=
unate, abandoned by=20

his wife, used as a tool by first one set of princes and then another.  At =
the funeral of Charles VI.=20

not a single prince of France was present; the English Bedford conducted th=
e whole sad affair. "As=20

the body of the King was put in the sepulchre beside his predecessors, the =
heralds broke their=20

rods and cast them into the grave... And then the Berri king-at-arms, accom=
panied by several=20

heralds and pursuivants, cried out over the grave: 'May God have mercy upon=
 the very noble and=20

very excellent Prince Charles, sixth of the name, our lawful and sovereign =
lord!' And after this the=20

aforesaid king-at-arms cried out: 'May God grant long life and prosperity t=
o Henry, by the grace of=20

God King of France and of England, our sovereign lord!' And then the herald=
s raised aloft their=20

truncheons with the fleur-de-lis, crying: _'Vive le roi! Vive le roi!'_ And=
 some of those present=20

answered _Noel_ (the ancient salutation to the King); but there were some w=
ho wept."  Thus the=20

wretched Isabeau's work was, it seemed, complete, her son being a fugitive =
before the arms of the=20

foreigner, while her infant grandson was King of France. From this time she=
 disappears completely=20

from the scene of action, drawing her meagre pension from the hands of the =
English, who treated=20

her with deserved contempt, and cursed by all France for the memory of her =
evil deeds. We catch=20

but a fleeting glimpse of her, living in obscurity at the royal palace of S=
aint-Pol. When on=20

December 2, 1431, the young King Henry VI. made his solemn entry into his c=
apital of Paris, the=20

royal procession passed by the=20

objected that half-and-half, even when badly spelt, is a cold preparation f=
or dinner; and others may=20

take exception to _Poukenvorm_, as likely to have an earthy taste. But did =
they ever try it=20

_gebakken in Berg-op-Zoomsche Stijl_? It is no use mincing matters. Let any=
one in search of a=20

good dinner enter any well-appointed _restaurant_, and order this _menu_ ri=
ght through down to=20

_Pupen en Tabak_ (which is not a preparation of dog's meat), and if they ar=
e not satisfied, _Mr.=20

Punch_ is a Dutchman.         *       *       *       *       *  "RICHARDSO=

rounded by a bevy of=20

women attendants. They, told him it was his grand-mother, the frivolous and=
 once beautiful=20

Isabeau de Baviere, and he doffed his cap, while Isabeau bowed to him and t=
urned aside to weep.=20

Did she weep from sincere contrition, or merely from regret of the departed=
 luxury and=20

extravagance of her life? She was not to live many years longer; but it was=
 long enough to know=20

that France had survived even her treachery and that her son was at peace w=
ith the Duke of=20

Burgundy. So far from rejoicing, it is said that she died of regret that th=
e treaty of Troyes had come=20

to naught, her death occurring on September 24, 1435. She died with outward=
 show of piety, and=20

was buried as meanly, says a contemporary, as if she had been a humble _bou=
rgeoise_, but four=20

persons=20

The Vaudeville, when it was opened, was devoted to all that was light and c=
heerful. Comedy and=20

Burlesque went hand-in-hand, and the audience, if ever asked to weep, were =
begged to cry with=20

laughter. But Mr. ROBERT BUCHANAN (with the assistance of the late Mr. RICH=
ARDSON) "has=20

changed all that." _Clarissa_, the present attraction at the little theatre=
 on the North-side of the=20

Strand, is a piece of the most doleful character. The First Act is devoted =
to a very  The very=20

portraits of Isabeau de Baviere, and of other women of her court, suggest s=

and of the earth, earthy, suggesting lives led in indolence and the pursuit=
 of pleasures not of the=20

highest. As Michelet says, "Obesity is a characteristic of the figures of t=
