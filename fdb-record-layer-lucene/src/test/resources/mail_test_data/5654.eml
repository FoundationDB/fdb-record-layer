Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distributi=
on of electronic=20

works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obso=
lete, old, middle-aged=20

and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of voluntee=

people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide v=

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK=

and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will =
remain freely=20

available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary =

created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg{~TRA=

or the Dunes* as soon as=20

possible."      _* Sandy hills about Dunkirk, from which it derives its nam=
e._  The party followed=20

him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved. H=
ere, after a short=20

conference, they proposed to separate.  "And why separate?" asked Athos.  "=
Because," answered=20

the Gascon, "we were sent, Porthos and I, by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for =
Cromwell; instead of=20

fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I.--not the same thing by any =
means. In returning=20

with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur d'Herblay our crime would be confirm=
ed. We have=20

circumvented Cromwell, Mordaunt, and the sea, but we shall find a certain d=
ifficulty in=20

circumventing Mazarin."  "You forget," replied Athos, "that we consider our=
selves your prisoners=20

and not free from the engagement we entered into."  "Truly, Athos," interru=
pted D'Artagnan, "I am=20

vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys woul=
d be ashamed of.=20

Chevalier," he continued, addressing Aramis, who, leaning proudly on his sw=
ord, seemed to agree=20

with his companion, "Chevalier, Porthos and I run no risk; besides, should =
any ill-luck happen to=20

two of us, will it not be much better that the other two should be spared t=
o assist those who may=20

be apprehended? Besides, who knows whether, divided, we may not obtain a pa=
rdon--you from=20

the queen, we from Mazarin--which, were we all four together, would never b=
e granted. Come,=20

Athos and Aramis, go to the right; Porthos, come with me to the left; these=
 gentlemen should file=20

off into Normandy, whilst we, by the nearest road, reach Paris."  He then g=
ave his friends minute=20

directions as to their route.  "Ah! my dear friend," exclaimed Athos, "how =
I should admire the=20

resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart."  And h=
e gave him his hand.=20

"Isn't this fox a genius, Athos?" asked the Gascon. "No! he knows how to cr=
unch fowls, to dodge=20

the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night, that's all. Well,=
 is all said?"  "All."=20

"Then let's count our money and divide it. Ah! hurrah! there's the sun! A m=
erry morning to you,=20

Sunshine. 'Tis a long time since I saw thee!"  "Come, come, D'Artagnan," sa=
id Athos, "do not=20

affect to be strong-minded; there are tears in your eyes. Let us be open wi=
th each other and=20

sincere."  "What!" cried the Gascon, "do you think, Athos, we can take leav=
e, calmly, of two friends=20

at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis?"  "No," answered Athos; "=
embrace me, my son."=20

"Zounds!" said Porthos, sobbing, "I believe I'm crying; but how foolish all=
 this is!"  Then they=20

embraced. At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever=
, and when they=20

parted, each to take the route agreed on, they turned back to utter affecti=
onate expressions, which=20

the echoes of the Dunes repeated. At last they lost sight of each other.  "=
Sacrebleu! D'Artagnan,"=20

said Porthos, "I must out with it at once, for I can't keep to myself anyth=
ing I have against you; I=20

haven't been able to recognize you in this matter."  "Why not?" said D'Arta=
gnan, with his wise=20

smile.  "Because if, as you say, Athos and Aramis are in real danger, this =
is not the time to=20

abandon them. For my part, I confess to you that I was all ready to follow =
them and am still ready=20

to rejoin them, in spite of all the Mazarins in the world."  "You would be =
right, Porthos, but for one=20

thing, which may change the current of your ideas; and that is, that it is =
not those gentlemen who=20

are in the greatest danger, it is ourselves; it is not to abandon them that=
 we have separated, but to=20

avoid compromising them."  "Really?" said Porthos, opening his eyes in asto=
nishment.  "Yes, no=20

doubt. If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile; if we are=
 arrested it is a matter of the=20

Porthos; you know the proverb, 'All roads lead to Rome.'"  "But how is it t=
hat we are incurring=20

greater risks than Athos and Aramis?" asked Porthos.  "Because they have bu=
t fulfilled the mission=20

confided to them by Queen Henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to u=
s by Mazarin;=20

because, going hence as emissaries to Cromwell, we became partisans of King=
 Charles; because,=20

instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called=
 Mazarin, Cromwell,=20

Joyce, Bridge, Fairfax, etc., we very nearly succeeded in saving it."  "Upo=
n my word that is true,"=20

said Porthos; "but how can you suppose, my dear friend, that in the midst o=
f his great=20

preoccupations General Cromwell has had time to think----"  "Cromwell think=
s of everything;=20

Cromwell has time for everything; and believe me, dear friend, we ought not=
 to lose our time--it is=20

precious. We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin, and then----"  "T=
