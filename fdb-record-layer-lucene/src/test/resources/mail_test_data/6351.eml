n--a man, who was=20

there patiently waiting to receive the cash from Mr. Wilson, was disappoint=
ed. An old acquaintance=20

caught a glimpse of the cash-clerk as the train slackened speed.  After a m=
oment's shaking of=20

hands Wilson offered the station-clerk the money.  "Here it is," said Wilso=
n.  "What?" inquired the=20

other.  "The screw."  "It's only Thursday."  "Yes; I'm off to-morrow for my=
 holiday."  "Oh! very well.=20

It's just as welcome to-day as to-morrow, I dare say; but why didn't you sa=
y you were coming to-

day? 'Pon my word, I wasn't looking out for you; and what an awful lark it =
would have been if you=20

had had to take the money back to London!"  "I did telegraph on Monday."  "=
The d--l you did! The=20

gaffer never told me any thing about it. It's just like him; but never mind=
, I'm mum about his=20

carelessness. He's a good sort."  The train moved on again, and the expecta=
nt thief went empty=20

away.  From another station the money was lost. That is to say, it reached =
neither the hands for=20

before or after a thunder storm: and has hardly ever been observed during o=
ne. To this same=20

cause must be attributed the occasional showers of luminous rain and dust. =
 But no amount of=20

science can rob such appearances of their terrors for the uninitiated. Of s=
cores of instances we=20

might name, a single one will suffice. Prof. Siemens tells of an unusual el=
ectric disturbance during=20

a Khamsin, while his party and his Arab guides were upon the summit of the =
great pyramid.=20

Hearing a hissing noise as the wind rose, he at length concluded it must be=
 due to electricity: and=20

=E2=80=9Cholding up a full wine-bottle, the head of which was coated with t=
in foil,=E2=80=9D the same hissing was=20

increased. The bottle was then wrapped with moist paper, to increase its ca=
pacity. Even before=20

this, a severe shock could be obtained from the head of the bottle.  =E2=80=
=9CThe Arabs, who for some time=20

had been looking on with astonishment at our proceedings, came to the concl=
usion that we were=20

practicing magic, and insisted upon our leaving the pyramid. Their remonstr=
ances being of no=20

avail, they now wanted to use the right of the stronger, and to make us des=
cend by force. I=20

retreated to the highest stone block and loaded my bottle as strongly as po=
ssible, while the leader=20

of the Arabs seized me by the other hand and was endeavoring to drag me dow=
n. At this critical=20


_
direction that neither party contemplated.  The train did not stop at this =
station, and a man was=20

there to receive the money, but his movements had, he thought, been noticed=
. He was cautious--

perhaps needlessly timid. He thought that as the train approached two faces=
 were peering at him=20

from the station-master's office. So he turned, went into the station, aske=
d when the next down-

train which stopped at that station would arrive, and sneaked away.  Wilson=
 arrived at this station=20

in due effects of the shock it produced were such as to surpass my keenest =
expectations. The son=20

of the desert, whose nerves had never before felt a similar commotion, fell=
 flat down upon the=20

ground, as if struck by lightning; and then springing up with a dreadful ho=
wl, soon vanished out of=20

sight, followed by all his comrades.=E2=80=9D  These cases of halos and ele=

ils, owing to the damp=20

and their slipperyness, so that he had not sufficient time for observation,=
 although the condition of=20

the atmosphere rendered careful notice doubly requisite. Into the hands, as=
 he supposed, of the=20

official in waiting, the incautious (and I think I must, after all fair all=
owances, say very negligent)=20

clerk dropped his packet, which lay there unnoticed until morning.  An old =
man and woman,=20

ech and aureole of=20

Marcius, and who can say how different the face of the earth might be?  Mor=

and because of its frequency, comparatively unheeded in northern climes, is=

the temperate zone has frequently inspired terror equal to the earthquake, =
though absolutely=20

abruptly, without his knowing a word about any previous correspondence with=
 lawyers; but the=20

parson was not a suspicious man, and he made no of fire in which the Lord w=

States to Siberia, from the Cape of Good Hope and Australia to the north of=
 Europe. It was the=20
