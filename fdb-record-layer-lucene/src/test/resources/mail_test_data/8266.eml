dracaena marginata throat. Chauvelin's earnestness seemed to vouch for the =
truth of his assertion, and if this were so--if those English spies were in=
deed in Nantes--then his own life was in deadly danger. He--like every one =
of those bloodthirsty tyrants who had misused the sacred names of Fraternit=

s Englishmen and of their unconquerable leader. Popular superstition made f=

be contemplated, though there was not much to be apprehended on that score,=
 for the Sioux were believed to be among the bravest as well as the most po=

achery or cruelty than most other tribes.  Two days later the Sioux made th=

 a small _
prying eyes.  On the whole--since time was so precious--he decided on retur=
ning to Le Bouffay.=20

The concierge and the clerk fortunately let him through without those offic=
ial delays which he--

Chauvelin--was wont to find so galling ever since his disgrace had put a ba=
r against the opening of=20

every door at the bare mention of his name or the display of his tricolour =
scarf.  He strode rapidly=20

across the hall: the men on guard eyed him with lazy indifference as he pas=
sed. Once inside his=20

own sanctum he looked carefully around him; he drew the curtain closer acro=
ss the window and=20

dragged the table and a chair well away from the range which might be cover=
ed by an eye at the=20

keyhole. It was only when he had thoroughly assured himself that no searchi=
ng eye or inquisitive=20

ear could possibly be watching over him that he at last drew the precious p=
acket of papers from=20

his pocket. He undid the red ribbon which held it together and spread the p=
apers out on the table=20

before him. Then he examined them carefully one by one.  As he did so an ex=
clamation of wrath=20

or of impatience escaped him from time to time, once he laughed--involuntar=
ily--aloud.  The=20

examination of the papers took him some time. When he had finished he gathe=
red them all=20

together again, retied the bit of ribbon round them and slipped the packet =
back into the pocket of=20

his coat. There was a look of grim determination on his face, even though a=
 bitter sigh escaped his=20

set lips.  "Oh! for the power," he muttered to himself, "which I had a year=
 ago! for the power to deal=20

with mine enemy myself. So you have come to Nantes, my valiant Sir Percy Bl=
akeney?" he added=20

while a short, sardonic laugh escaped his thin, set lips: "and you are dete=
rmined that I shall know=20

how and why you came! Do you reckon, I wonder, that I have no longer the po=
wer to deal with=20

you? Well!..."  He sighed again but with more satisfaction this time.  "Wel=
l!..." he reiterated with=20

obvious complacency. "Unless that oaf Carrier is a bigger fool than I imagi=
ne him to be I think I=20

have you this time, my elusive Scarlet Pimpernel."     CHAPTER IV  THE NET =
  I  It was not an=20

easy thing to obtain an audience of the great proconsul at this hour of the=
 night, nor was=20

Chauvelin, the disgraced servant of the Committee of Public Safety, a man t=
o be considered.=20

Carrier, with his love of ostentation and of tyranny, found great delight i=
n keeping his colleagues=20

waiting upon his pleasure, and he knew that he could trust young Jacques La=
louet to be as=20

insolent as any tyrant's flunkey of yore.  "I must speak with the proconsul=
 at once," had been=20

Chauvelin's urgent request of Fleury, the commandant of the great man's bod=
yguard.  "The=20

proconsul dines at this hour," had been Fleury's curt reply.  "'Tis a matte=
r which concerns the=20

welfare and the safety of the State!"  "The proconsul's health is the conce=
rn of the State too, and=20

he dines at this hour and must not be disturbed."  "Commandant Fleury!" urg=
ed Chauvelin, "you=20

risk being implicated in a disaster. Danger and disgrace threaten the proco=
nsul and all his=20

adherents. I must speak with citizen Carrier at once."  Fortunately for Cha=
uvelin there were two=20

keys which, when all else failed, were apt to open the doors of Carrier's s=
tronghold: the key of fear=20

and that of cupidity. He tried both and succeeded. He bribed and he threate=
ned: he endured=20

Fleury's brutality and Lalouet's impertinence but he got his way. After an =
hour's weary waiting and=20

ceaseless parleyings he was once more ushered into the antechamber where he=
 had sat earlier in=20

the day. The doors leading to the inner sanctuary were open. Young Jacques =
Lalouet stood by=20

them on guard. Carrier, fuming and raging at having been disturbed, vented =
his spleen and ill-

temper on Chauvelin.  "If the news that you bring me is not worth my consid=
eration," he cried=20

savagely, "I'll send you to moulder in Le Bouffay or to drink the waters of=
 the Loire."  Chauvelin=20

silent, self-effaced, allowed the flood of the great man's wrath to spend i=
tself in threats. Then he=20



said quietly:  "Citizen proconsul I have come to tell you that the English =
spy, who is called the=20

Scarlet Pimpernel, is now in Nantes. There is a reward of twenty thousand f=
rancs for his capture=20

and I want your help to lay him by the heels."  Carrier suddenly paused in =
his ravings. He at that=20

time.  The half-breed, besides asserting himself to be a "Catholic," (by wh=
ich he meant a Roman=20

Catholic), and, therefore, in no way amenable to Sutherland's jurisdiction,=
 received his=20

remonstrances with philosophical arguments tending to prove that men were m=
eant to make the=20

best of circumstances as they found them, without any regard to principles-=
-which, after all, were=20

not very seriously held or practised by any one, he thought--especially in =
Red River.  As for=20

Slowfoot, she listened with evident interest and curiosity to the strange t=
eaching and exhortations=20

of the Elder, but when appealed to for some sort of opinion on the various =
points touched, she=20

replied with an imbecile "Hee! hee!" which was not encouraging.  However, t=
he good man had=20

sown the seed faithfully and kindly.  The watering thereof and the sproutin=
g were, he knew, in the=20

hands of the Master.  Rising to take leave, the Elder put his hand in his p=
ocket and pulled out a=20

large clasp-knife.  "Why, that's my knife that I lost!" exclaimed La Certe =
in surprise; "where did you=20

find it?"  "I found it on my table at home, where you left it that time you=
 came to ask for some=20

tobacco.  Now, observe, if I did not seriously hold and practise the princi=
ple of honesty, I would=20

have made the best of circumstances as I found them, and would have put the=
 knife in my pocket=20

instead of returning it to you."  La Certe laughed, and Slowfoot said, "Hee=
! hee!" while the juvenile=20

La Certe availed itself of the opportunity to draw the pipe gently from its=
 father's hand and have a=20

whiff.  "I have a message to you from the Governor," continued the Elder, t=
aking a piece of paper=20

out of his pocket.  "For me!" exclaimed La Certe, in surprise.  "Yes.  He h=
eard that you are hard up=20

just now, and that you are going up the river a considerable distance to hu=
nt--is not that so?"=20

"Yes, that is true.  We start off to-morrow."  "Well, then, he gave me this=
 order for some supplies of=20

powder and shot, twine and hooks, with some cloth, beads, and such like for=
 Slowfoot."  "That is=20

very good of the Governor--very considerate," said La Certe with a pleased =
look.  "Very good,"=20

said Sutherland.  "Now, La Certe, suppose it true that men are meant to mak=
e the best of=20

circumstances as they find them, and that I was a man without any regard to=
 principle, I might=20

have drawn these supplies from the store for you, and used them myself, and=
 you would not have=20

been a bit the wiser."  Again the half-breed laughed, and admitted the trut=
h of the proposition,=20

while Slowfoot expressed her belief, (whatever it was), in a more than usua=
lly emphatic "Hee!=20

hee!"  Returning home from his apparently useless errand, Sutherland met Fr=
ed Jenkins with a=20

gun on his shoulder.  The seaman was accompanied by Archie Sinclair.  "Well=
, Jenkins," he said,=20

heartily, "you must be like a fish out o' water in these regions.  Don't yo=
u feel a longing,=20

sometimes, for the roar of the gale and the smell o' the salt sea?"  "Can't=
 say as I does, Mr=20

Sutherland.  I've bin used to accommodate myself to circumstances, dee see,=
 ever since I was a=20

small shaver; so nothin' comes exactly amiss to me--"  "O Fred! how can you=
 tell thumpers like=20

that?" interrupted the forward Archie.  "Isn't Elise Morel a miss to you? a=
nd Elspie, and Jessie=20

Davidson?"  "Clap a stopper on your mug, you young scape grace!" retorted t=
he seaman, who had=20

some doubt as to whether the boy's putting Elise Morel's name first was int=
entional or an accident.=20

"As I was a-going to say, sir, I was always fond o' changes, an' the rollin=
' plains come to me as=20

pleasant, though not quite so familiar, as the rollin' sea."  "That's a sat=
isfactory state o' mind,=20

anyhow," returned the Elder.  "But where away now?--to cater for the pot, I=
 dare say."  "Well, no,=20



not exactly--though I've no objection to do that too in the by-goin'.  But =
we've heard a report that a=20

band o' Sioux are goin' to visit the Settlement, and as there's a lot o' th=
eir enemies, the Saulteaux,=20

knocking about, I've bin sent to the fort by old McKay to see if they've he=
ard about the Sioux=20

comin', an' if there's likely to be a scrimmage, so as we may clear for act=
ion, d'ee see?"  "I see;=20

and I hope there will be no need to clear for action.  I'm glad to see Arch=
ie with you too," said=20

Sutherland, "but surprised; for I=20


_
hue spread over his face.  "It's not true!" he murmured hoarsely.  "I saw h=
im--not an hour ago...."=20

"What proof have you?"  "I'll show them to you--but not across this thresho=
ld. Let me enter, citizen=20

proconsul, and close your sanctuary doors behind me rather than before. Wha=
t I have come hither=20

to tell you, can only be said between four walls."  "I'll make you tell me,=
" broke in Carrier in a=20

raucous voice, which excitement and fear caused almost to choke in his thro=
at. "I'll make you ...=20

curse you for the traitor that you are.... Curse you!" he cried more vigoro=
usly, "I'll make you speak.=20

Will you shield a spy by your silence, you miserable traitor? If you do I'l=
l send you to rot in the mud=20

of the Loire with other traitors less accursed than yourself."  "If you onl=
y knew," was Chauvelin's=20

calm rejoinder to the other's ravings, "how little I care for life. I only =
live to be even one day with an=20

enemy whom I hate. That enemy is now in Nantes, but I am like a bird of pre=
y whose wings have=20

been clipped. If you do not help me mine enemy will again go free--and deat=
h in that case matters=20

little or nothing to me."  For a moment longer Carrier hesitated. Fear had =
side."  "O, as to that,=20

Little Bill has forsaken me," said Archie, "or I have forsaken him--I'm not=
 sure which--since Dan=20

Davidson's accident, for he does little else but sit at Dan's bedside, read=
in' to him or talking with=20

him."  "The dear little fellow could not be better employed," remarked the =
Elder.  "The dear little=20

fellow could be _much_ better employed," retorted the boy, with unexpected =
decision.  "He could=20

be rambling about the plains or in the bush with me, getting strength to hi=
s muscles and fresh air=20

to his lungs, an' health to his body--to say nothing of his soul."  "Why, y=
ou are becoming jealous,=20

lad," said Sutherland, with a laugh.  "No, I'm not _becoming_ jealous; I'm =
jealous already,"=20

returned the boy, with an air that was half jocular, half serious.  "Howeve=
r, I'll exercise patience a=20

little longer, but I'm determined not to let Little Bill be sacrificed for =
the sake of sick-nursing."  With=20

this announcement of his unalterable resolve to stand to his guns, and a "B=
rayvo, youngster!" from=20

Jenkins, they parted and went on their several ways.  It was found, when Fo=
rt Garry was reached,=20

that the rumour of a visit from the Sioux Indians was correct,=20
