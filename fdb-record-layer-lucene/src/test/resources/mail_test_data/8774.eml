squadrons of ships, millions upon millions of cruisers, large and small, crossing each other, 

whirling and gyrating in every direction; and Science teaches us, that though they be without 

rudder or compass or any beacon to guide them, they are nevertheless secure from collision--

almost secure, at any rate, save in chance accidents--as the whole celestial machine is built upon 

and guided by an immutable, albeit blind, law, and by constant and accelerating force or forces. 

"Built upon" by whom? "By self-evolution," is the answer. Moreover, as dynamics teach that       A 

body in motion tends to continue in the same state of relative     rest or motion unless acted upon 

by some external force,   this force has to be regarded as self-generated--even if not eternal, since 

this would amount to the recognition of perpetual motion--and so well self- calculated and self-

adjusted as to last from the beginning to the end of Kosmos. But "self-generation" has still to 

generate from something, generation _ex-nihilo_ being as contrary to reason as it is to Science. 

Thus we are placed once more between the horns of a dilemma: are we to believe in perpetual 

motion or in self-generation _ex-nihilo_? And if in neither, who or what is that something, which 

first produced that force or those forces?  There are such things in mechanics as superior levers, 

which give the impulse and act upon secondary or inferior levers. The former, however, need an 

impulse and occasional renovation, otherwise they would themselves very soon stop and fall back 

into their original status. What is the external force which puts and retains them in motion? Another 

dilemma!  As to the law of cosmical _non-intervention_, it could be justified only in one case, 

namely, if the celestial mechanism were perfect; but it is not. The so-called unalterable motions of 

celestial bodies alter and change incessantly; they are very often disturbed, and the wheels of 

even the sidereal locomotive itself occasionally jump off their invisible rails, as may be easily 

proved. Otherwise why should Laplace speak of the probable occurrence at some future time of 

an out-and-out reform in the arrangement of the planets;(409) or Lagrange maintain the gradual 

narrowing of the  And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the 

Rue des Fossoyeurs, whilst D'Artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of 

Planchet under present circumstances. While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best 

to make up for lost time at table. At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused, as if he had 

partially appeased his hunger.  "Come," said D'Artagnan, who thought that it was now a 

convenient time to begin his interrogations, "dost thou know where Athos is?"  "No, sir," replied 

Planchet.  "The devil thou dost not! Dost know where Porthos is?"  "No--not at all."  "And Aramis?" 

"Not in the least."  "The devil! the devil! the devil!"  "But, sir," said Planchet, with a look of 

shrewdness, "I know where Bazin is."  "Where is he?"  "At Notre Dame."  "What has he to do at 

Notre Dame?"  "He is beadle."  "Bazin beadle at Notre Dame! He must know where his master is!" 

"Without a doubt he must."  D'Artagnan thought for a moment, then took his sword and put on his 

cloak to go out.  "Sir," said Planchet, in a mournful tone, "do you abandon me thus to my fate? 

Think, if I am found out here, the people of the house, who have not seen me enter it, will take me 

for a thief."  "True," said D'Artagnan. "Let's see. Canst thou speak any patois?"  "I can do 

something better than that, sir, I can speak Flemish."  "Where the devil didst thou learn it?"  "In 

Artois, where I fought for years. Listen, sir. Goeden morgen, mynheer, eth teen begeeray le 

weeten the ge sond heets omstand."  "Which means?"  "Good-day, sir! I am anxious to know the 

state of your health."  "He calls that a language! But never mind, that will do capitally."  D'Artagnan 

opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come upstairs.  When the 



landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planchet.  "My dear 

landlady," said D'Artagnan, "I beg to introduce to you your brother, who is arrived from Flanders 

and whom I am going to take into my service."  "My brother?"  "Wish your sister good-morning, 

Master Peter."  "Wilkom, suster," said Planchet.  "Goeden day, broder," replied the astonished 

landlady.  "This is the case," said D'Artagnan; "this is

the fuel in the sun is slowly disappearing? If the laws and forces which govern the behaviour of the 

celestial bodies are immutable, such modifications and wearing-out of substance or fuel, of force 

and fluids, would be impossible; yet they are not denied. Therefore one has to suppose that such 

modifications will have to rely upon the laws of forces, which will have to self-regenerate 

themselves once more on such occasions, thus producing an astral antinomy, and a kind of 

physical palinomy, since, as Laplace says, one would then see fluids disobeying themselves and 

reaecting in a way contrary to all their attributes and properties.  Newton felt very uncomfortable 

about the moon. Her behaviour in progressively narrowing the circumference of her orbit around 

the earth made him nervous, lest it should end one day in our satellite falling upon the earth. The 

world, he confessed, needed repairing, and that very often.(410) In this he was corroborated by 

Herschel.(411) He speaks of real and quite considerable deviations, besides those which are only 

apparent, but gets some consolation from his conviction that somebody or something will probably 

see to things.  We may be answered that the personal beliefs of some pious Astronomers, 

however great they may be as scientific characters, are no proofs of the actual existence and 

presence in space of intelligent supramundane Beings, of either Gods or Angels. It is the 

behaviour of the stars and planets themselves that has to be you don't know him perhaps, but I 

know him; he has arrived from Amsterdam. You must dress him up during my absence. When I 

return, which will be in about an hour, you must offer him to me as a servant, and upon your 

recommendation, though he doesn't speak a word of French, I take him into my service. You 

understand?"  "That is to say, I guess your wishes, and that is all that's necessary," said 

Madeleine.  "You are a precious creature, my pretty hostess, and I am much obliged to you."  The 

next moment D'Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame.     7. Touches upon the Strange Effects 

a Half-pistole may have.   D'Artagnan, as he crossed the Pont Neuf, congratulated himself on 

having found Planchet again, for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him; nor was 

he sorry that through Planchet and the situation which he held in Rue des Lombards, a connection 

with the bourgeoisie might be commenced, at that critical period when that class were preparing to 

make war with the court party. It was like having a spy in the enemy's camp. In this frame of mind, 

grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet, pleased with himself, D'Artagnan reached Notre 

Dame. He ran up the steps, entered the church, and addressing a verger who was sweeping the 

chapel, asked him if he knew Monsieur Bazin.  "Monsieur Bazin, the beadle?" said the verger. 

"Yes. There he is, attending mass, in the chapel of the Virgin."  D'Artagnan nearly jumped for joy; 

he had despaired of finding Bazin, 


_
Renan asserts that nothing that we know of the sidereal bodies warrants the idea of the presence 

of any Intelligence, whether internal or external to them.  Let us see, says Reynaud, if this is a fact, 

or only one more empty scientific assumption.       The orbits traversed by the planets are far from 

being immutable.     They are, on the contrary, subject to perpetual mutation in     position, as in 

form. Elongations, now, he thought, since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to 

reach the other end.  He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man; 

and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him, he made use 

of his time in gazing at Bazin.  Bazin wore his dress, it may be observed, with equal dignity and 

saintly propriety. It was not difficult to understand that he

widenings, oscillations from right to left, slackening and     quickening of speed ... and all this on a 

plane which seems to     vacillate.(412)   As is very pertinently observed by des Mousseux: 

Here is a path having little of the mathematical and mechanical     precision crown of his ambition 

and that the silver-mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the 

marshal's baton which Conde threw, or did not throw, into the enemy's line of battle at Fribourg. 

His person had undergone a change, analogous to the change in his dress;

gone slow for several minutes should catch up the right time _of     itself_ and _without a turn of

the sight of Science--of a stone raised in the air against the law of gravitation, this is what Babinet-

-the deadliest enemy and opponent striking points of his face were effaced; he had still a nose, but 

his cheeks, fattened out, each took a portion of it unto themselves; his chin had joined his throat; 

his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks; his hair, cut straight in holy guise, 

covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows.  The officiating priest was
