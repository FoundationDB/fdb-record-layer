philodendron monstera to Peru."  "Oh, you'll go all right!" declared Mr. Ti=
tus with a smile. "I can see that you are eager for the adventures I am sur=

making captives of others.  Five only succeeded in escaping to carry the ta=

can see that you are eager for the adventures I am sure you'll find there, =
and, besides, your friend here, Mr. Damon, needs you."  "That's what I do, =

suppose he wants to find out my plans so as to be ready to jump in the brea=
ch in case we fail."=20

"Do you think your rivals had anything to do with the difficulties you are =
now meeting with in=20

digging the tunnel?" asked Mr. Damon. Mr. Titus shook his head.  "The prese=
nt difficulties are all=20

of Nature's doing," he tongue of fire; so faultless was the aim that nearly=
 every time a musket rang=20

out an Iroquois fell dead.  Fortunately Dollard had brought plenty of ammun=
ition.  Some=20

musketoons of large calibre, from whose throats scraps of lead and iron bel=
ched forth, slew and=20

wounded several of the enemy at a single discharge.=20


_
just the abnormally hard rock that is bothering us. Only for that we'd be a=
ll right, though we might=20

have petty difficulties because of the mean acts of Blakeson & Grinder. But=
 I don't fear them."=20

"How do you think this Waddington, if it was he, knew you were coming here?=
" asked Tom.  "I can=20

only guess. My brother and I have had some correspondence regarding you, To=
m Swift. That is, I=20

announced my intention of coming to see you, and my brother wrote me to use=
 away and still the=20

terrible struggle came to no end.  In the intervals, by day and night, Doll=
ard and his men offered up=20

prayers to Heaven on their knees in the melting snow.  Their food was now g=
one, and, worse still,=20

they had no water.  No hope now remained save to keep the Iroquois a few ho=
urs longer at bay;=20

they were certain only of a martyr's reward.  On the part of the besiegers =
so many men had they=20

lost that they sickened of the fight, and some amongst=20


_
that I would consult you.  "Our main office is in New York, where we employ=
 a large clerical and=20

expert force. There is nothing to prevent one of our stenographers, for ins=
tance, turning traitor and=20

giving copies of the letters of my brother and myself to our rivals.  "Mind=
 you, I don't say this was=20

done, and I don't suspect any of our employees, but it would be an easy mat=
ter for any one to=20

know my plans. I never thought of making a secret of them, or of my trip he=
re. In some way=20

Waddington found out about the last, and he must have followed me here. The=
n he sneaked up=20

under the window, and tried to hear what we said."  "Do you think he did?" =
asked Tom.  "I wouldn't=20

be surprised. We took no pains to lower our voices. But, after all, he hasn=
't learned much that he=20

didn't know before, if he knew I was coming here. He even counselled going =
home.  But other=20

chiefs shrank from such a disgrace.  "Shall we," they cried, "confess ourse=
lves beaten by so paltry=20

an enemy?  Our squaws would laugh in our faces!  Let us now rather band our=
selves together and=20

storm the fort of the white men, at whatever cost."  A general assault was =
made.  So high by this=20

time was piled the bodies of the Iroquois, that their fellows could now lea=
p over the stockade.=20

Dollard fell, and one after another of the exhausted defenders was slain, a=
lthough each fought like=20

a madman, a sword or hatchet in one hand and a knife in the other.  Amongst=
 the heap of corpses=20

one Frenchman still breathed, and he was dragged out and {83} tortured.  Th=
is was the end; thus=20

perished Dollard and his valiant sixteen, whose names are imperishably writ=
ten in the annals of=20

Montreal.  Nor=20


_
that must be used, and that is the vital thing. For I defy him, or any othe=
r contractor, to blast that=20

hard rock with any known explosive. We've tried every kind on the market an=
d we've failed. We'll=20

have to depend on you, Tom Swift, to help us out with some of your giant ca=
nnon powder."  "And=20

I'm not sure that will work," said the young inventor. "I think I'll have t=
o experiment and make vain.=20

The Iroquois had been taught a lesson, and to their lodges the tribe slunk =
back like whipped curs.=20

"If," said they, "seventeen Frenchmen, four Algonquins, and one Huron can, =
behind a picket fence,=20

hold seven hundred of our best warriors at bay, what defence would their hu=
ndreds do behind=20

yonder ramparts of stone?"  And so the colony of New France was saved.  The=
 cowardly native=20
