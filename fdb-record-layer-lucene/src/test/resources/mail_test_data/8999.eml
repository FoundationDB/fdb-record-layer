philodendron monstera shoulder when Doctor Emmons...."  "Look!" Neil Durant=
 suddenly broke in. "I know _now_ where I've seen the person that resembles=
 this picture--it's _you_, Teeny-bits! Her eyes and mouth--just look!"  Tee=
ny-bits gazed at the philodendron monstera shoulder when Doctor Emmons...."=
  "Look!" Neil Durant suddenly broke in. "I know _now_ where I've seen the =
person that resembles this picture--it's _you_, Teeny-bits! Her eyes and mo=
uth--just look!"  Teeny-bits gazed at the _
wanted me to know.  "'Foreign devil,' he said, 'what is worth more than you=
r life to you? Ai, I know.=20

This child is worth to you more than your life, therefore will I take him a=
way.' And then he=20

uncovered the baby's back and showed me a livid mark on the little chap's s=
houlder. 'See,' he=20

said, 'he belongs to Red Knife now; he wears Red Knife's mark. My women wil=
l be _very_ good to=20

this little son of the foreigner. We will bring him up in our band; he will=
 be clever like the white man.=20

Who knows, perhaps he will be as good a thief as Red Knife himself!'  "I tr=
ied to think of something=20

that I could say or do that would move this wretch's heart, but it was of n=
o use. Poor Ho Sen was=20

frightened to death, and when I begged him to try to escape and bring help =
from the village I little=20

thought that he could do anything.  "'Take the boy back to the village,' I =
said to Red Knife through=20

the interpreter, 'and do with me as you will.'  "'Yes, I will do with you a=
s I will,' was his answer. 'I=20

think I will put you in a hole in the ground and perhaps I will give you a =
toad and a lizard to keep=20

you company. Red Knife wants no one to be lonely.'  "Red Knife--I've always=
 supposed--did intend=20

to put me out of the way by some diabolical method of his own. And then the=
 idea of holding me=20

for ransom apparently occurred to him, for he kept me in the stone house ba=
ck in the hills day after=20

day. Two or three times when I saw Ho Sen I begged him to run away from the=
 bandits and take=20

the little boy with him and tell my friends in the village where we were, b=
ut Ho Sen only looked at=20

me and trembled. I couldn't much blame him for being terrified.  "One night=
 there was a jabbering=20

and yelling round the stone house and I thought Red Knife had killed Ho Sen=
, for I saw him no=20

more. Two days later there was more commotion and the whole band began to p=
repare to depart.=20

I hoped that an expedition had come from the town--and that in fact was act=
ually what happened.=20

Some of the Imperial Government troops led by the white men were on Red Kni=
fe's trail, but Red=20

Knife knew those hills too well. He and his gang went farther back and took=
 me along, helpless.=20

The horrible part of it all can exist on this head, if the position of Bert=
hollet be true, that permanent=20

blacks are formed only by the combination of iron and tannin.  To prepare t=
he chesnut wood for=20

the purposes of tanning, a mode has been devised for reducing it to a suita=
ble degree of fineness.=20

This method consists in the application of knives, either in the direction =
of, or transversely to the=20

grain, by a rotatory motion. This mode obviously involves the greatest poss=
ible economy of=20

moving power. Messrs. B. and M. Stebbins, of West-Springfield, who are maki=
ng arrangements for=20

going largely into the exportation of the article, have in construction a m=
achine upon this plan.  As=20

might be expected, the inspissated aqueous extract of the chesnut, bears a =
near resemblance in=20

many particulars, to catechu. Professor Dewey, of William's College, who at=
 my request, has gone=20

through an extensive and elaborate course of experiments, informed me that =
he obtained a=20

quarter more of the gelatinous precipitate from the former, than from the l=
atter. By the taste, the=20

two substances are not to be distinguished, except that the former is more =
pungent. It leaves upon=20

the tongue, the same permanent and refreshing sweetness, for which the othe=
r is so much prized=20

in the east; where it is used as an article of luxury, with betel nut. Migh=
t not the extract be=20

advantageously substituted for catechu, in the celebrated life preserving c=
omposition of Dr.=20

Pearson; the object being to concentrate the greatest possible quantity of =
nutritious and tonic=20

substances in the smallest weight.  The colouring properties of the two sub=
stances, are entirely=20

different. After the discovery, twelve or fifteen years since, of the compo=
sition of the _terra=20

japonica_, attempts were made in England to introduce it into the materia t=
ingentia, as a substitute=20

for galls; but unfortunately, like the extract of quercitron, it affords wi=
th iron nothing but a meagre=20



olive; and Dr. Bancroft states, that in a great number of trials, he was un=
able, by the greatest=20

accumulation, to produce any thing like a black, even upon wool, much less =
upon cotton and silk.=20

A singular fact, which I observed in the course of my experiments, is=20


_
have disappeared, and when I asked what had become of him these yellow men =
only jabbered at=20

me in their outlandish tongue. We traveled all day and all night and finall=
y camped in some=20

limestone caves. There I became very sick and I hoped that I should die bec=
ause the future didn't=20

seem to hold anything at all for me. I know I was delirious for a long time=
; things seemed very=20

hazy--a confused coming and going of the natives and the jabbering of their=
 singsong voices.=20

Perhaps that sickness was what saved my life, for when I came to the end of=
 my delirium I was=20

lying there deserted in the limestone cave. I suppose Red Knife thought tha=
t the 'foreign devil' was=20

dying and that I was only an encumbrance in his retreat. I don't know how l=
ong I had remained in=20

the cave and I can't tell you how I managed to make my way out of that wild=
erness of hills and dry=20

river beds, but Providence must have guided me, for I finally stumbled down=
 into the village of=20

Tung-sha and found Hartley, the surgeon, and three or four of the Europeans=
 still there.  "I was=20

delirious again for a time and didn't know what went on around me. But Hart=
ley pulled me through=20

and I found myself asking what had happened. They told me that the native t=
roops of the Imperial=20

Government had come up and that the foreign colony had led an expedition ba=
ck into the hills.=20

They hadn't been able, however, to overtake Red Knife and had finally aband=
oned the expedition=20

partly because of the doubtful loyalty of the Chinese troops, who weren't o=
ver eager to chase Red=20

Knife. That whole region in those days needed only a spark to set it aflame=
 against all foreigners.=20

"There was one surprising bit of news, something that gave me a great desir=
e to live. Ho Sen,=20

poor, faithful Ho Sen, had escaped from Red Knife. He had come crawling to =
Hartley's bungalow=20

at midnight several days after the raid, carrying in his arms the boy, and =
had fallen unconscious at=20

the doorsteps. Hartley took them in and found the boy little the worse for =
his experiences, but Ho=20

Sen died that same night and had been in his grave more than two weeks when=
 Hartley told me=20

the story. Meanwhile they had given up hope of ever seeing me alive again, =
and when the colony=20

decided that it was unsafe for the women to stay at Tung-sha any longer the=
y sent the boy down=20

to Shanghai with an American missionary by the name of Singleton, who was g=
oing back to the=20

United States. She had become deaf during her service in China and was retu=
rning to the States=20

for treatment.  "Of course I started for Shanghai as soon as I was able to =
get about, going down=20

the Yangtse in a river boat. But again I was too late. When I arrived I dis=
covered that this Miss=20

Singleton had gone to the office of the company and on solutions from the w=
ood of the trunk of a=20

tree, about three feet, and from that of a limb about three inches in diame=
ter. The same quantity of=20

wood and of the solvent was employed in both cases. On adding to each the s=
ame quantity of the=20

solution of gelatine, abundant precipitates immediately appeared, as usual,=
 apparently much the=20

same in quantity; but to my astonishment, the size of the several congeries=
 in each, bore a near=20

proportion to that of the sticks from which they were obtained, not differi=
ng much from that of=20

middling and of very small flakes of snow. Is not this an extraordinary fac=
t, evincive of a=20

complication in the arrangement of these bodies hitherto unsuspected. May i=
t not at some future=20

period, lead to a _nomenclature of precipitates_; affording, like the cryst=
allography of Ha=C3=BCy, a new=20

and accurate mode of determining the compositions of substances; and perhap=
s throwing light=20

upon the obscure subject of chemical, or if you please, electro-chemical af=
finities. The _size_ of a=20

stick might probably be ascertained with almost as much precision, as by ac=
tual admeasurement.=20

The solutions in this experiment, were formed by maceration in cold water. =
When hot water was=20

employed, and the process was completed in two or three hours, the appearan=
ce of the precipitate=20



was very different, the congeries being smaller, irregular, and not well de=
fined.  I have only to add,=20

that having taken measures to secure the discovery, both in this country an=
d Europe, it is my wish=20

to bring it into general use as speedily as possible.    I am, Sir, very re=
spectfully,    Your obedient=20

servant,    WILLIAM SHELDON.  P. S. In a short article for some future numb=
er, I may send you=20

an account of the operation of the machine, and of some other particulars. =
  23. _Additional note=20

concerning the Tungsten and Tellurium._  We have not room to insert in the =
present number, a=20

description and a chemical examination of the ores of tungsten and telluriu=
m recently discovered=20

in Connecticut; they will appear in our next.  In the mean time it may be s=
tated, that the tungsten=20

and tellurium are found blended in the same pieces, but whether in mere mix=
ture, or in chemical=20

combination, is not yet quite determined. Many specimens of the tungsten ex=
ist without the=20

tellurium, but every piece which has afforded tellurium has also afforded t=
ungsten, and in greater=20

abundance. Even in well defined crystals, both metals have been found in th=
e same crystal, and=20

where the external appearance was homogeneous. In other specimens a differe=
nce seems to be=20

apparent, and a proper ore of tellurium appears to be blended with a proper=
 ore of tungsten. This=20

latter ore is the wolfram, composed of oxid of tungsten, or as some choose =
to say, tungstic=20


_
taken the baby with her when she sailed for San Francisco. She had the addr=
ess of my brother--

Ted's father--and said that she would deliver the child to them in New York=
. That's about the end=20

of the story, except that I was never able to trace Miss Singleton beyond a=
re octahedral, a fact=20

which we believe is not mentioned of this species by authors, although this=
 form is found in the=20

calcareous tungsten.         *       *       *       *       *  The Bismuth=
 mine in which these ores are found=20

is the property of Mr. Ephraim Lane.=20


_
Shanghai I came down with typhoid and was delayed three months in getting b=
ack to America.=20

Then I discovered that my little son never arrived in New York--as far as a=
ny one knew--and the=20

result of the investigations that I carried on through the police and priva=
te detective agencies=20

established only the fact that the young missionary was on the steamer when=
 it arrived at San=20

Francisco and that she and the baby disembarked with the other passengers. =
 "I said that was=20

pretty nearly the end Stratford, town of Huntington, Connecticut, will find=
 him through the Post=20

Office; and he will, for a reasonable compensation, pack boxes more or less=
 extensive, for=20

mineralogists and others. As Mr. Lane is by occupation a farmer, and is obl=
iged to blast a quartz=20

gangue in order to obtain his specimens, he cannot be expected to transmit =
them gratis. His mine,=20

which has been sunk only ten feet, affords native bismuth, native silver, m=
agnetical and common=20

iron pyrites, and copper pyrites,=20


_
never quite given up hope of sometime finding that boy of mine."  "Will you=
 let me look at that=20

picture again?" asked Neil Durant.  As the mining engineer took the photogr=
aph from his pocket=20

and handed it to Neil, Teeny-bits asked a question:  "That mark," he said i=
n a voice that was=20

peculiarly tense, "what was it like--was it--?"  "Yes," said Wolcott Norris=
, "it _was_ like the mark=20

that I saw on blende, tungsten, tellurium, &c.  It is expected that the sha=
ft will soon be sunk=20

deeper, when probably a more abundant supply of good specimens will be obta=
ined.  N. B. The=20

silver and galena are the least abundant.    _March 8th, 1819._   FOOTNOTES=
