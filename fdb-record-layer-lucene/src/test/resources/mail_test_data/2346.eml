for his great work of giving voice and form to all the phases of devout fee=

life deeply influenced his character, and has left its traces on many a lin=
e of his psalms.    "Love=20

had he found in huts where poor men lie;    His daily teachers had been woo=

silence that is in the starry sky,    The sleep that is among the lonely hi=

vicissitudes of the tempestuous concentration of nervous energy. I am not q=

tremor of the knees. That was what I suffered from at the moment, together =
with a very=20

considerable palpitation of the heart. Now the difficulty at such a moment =
is to know how to begin.=20

I have often heard men say that when they have obtained an interview with a=
 great statesman for=20

the purpose of asking a favour, and he waits for them to begin without help=

word, they have experienced this difficulty. That arises from the conscious=

d in his sudden=20

elevation keeping the gracious sweetness of his lowlier, and perhaps happie=
r days. The scene=20

changes with startling suddenness to the desert. He is "hunted like a partr=
idge upon the=20

mountains," a fugitive and half a freebooter, taking service at foreign cou=
rts, and lurking on the=20

frontiers with a band of outlaws "career." If they would never go near a st=

they wanted to confer a favour upon him, they would have no difficulty in f=

Fortunately the great majority of our public _employes_ are not yet hardene=

 learn the weariness=20

 courtesies of aliens,=20

how unslumbering the suspicions which watch the refugee who fights on the s=
ide of his "natural=20

enemies." One more swift transition and he is on the throne, for long years=
 victorious, prosperous,=20
