in the criminal dock first and on the way to Cayenne or the guillotine afterwards. This place is 

surrounded with Marats, and orders have been issued to them to make a descent on this place, as 

soon as papa Lemoine's customers are assembled. There are two members of the accursed 

company amongst us at the present moment...."  He was standing right in the middle of the room, 

way: "will you hev the presumption to teach a man that knew how to scull a boat before you wass 

born?  But, Taniel," he added, in a more serious tone, "we must hev one like this made for poor 

Tuncan."  As this was the first reference which McKay had made to his younger son since his 

illness--with the exception of the daily inquiry as to his health--it was hailed as an 


_
hanging lamp. At his words--spoken with such firm confidence, as one who knows and is therefore 

empowered to speak--a sudden change came over the spirit of the whole assembly. Everything 

was forgotten in the face of this new danger--two Marats, the sleuth-hounds of the proconsul--here 

present, as spies and as informants! Every face became more haggard--every cheek more livid. 

There was a quick and furtive scurrying toward the front door.  "Two Marats here?" shouted one 

man, who was bolder than the rest. "Where are they?"  Paul Friche, who towered above his 

friends, stood at this moment quite close to a small man, dressed like the others in taking place in 

the old man's mind.  For up to that period no one had received any encouragement to speak of, or 

enter into conversation about, Duncan junior.  "You are right," returned Dan.  "I have been thinking 

of that, and have even laid in the wood to make a similar chair for him.  But I fear he won't be able 

to use it for some time to come.  Elspie was thinking, if you don't object, to have your bedroom 

changed to one of the rooms on the ground floor, so that you could be wheeled into the garden 

when so inclined."  "Yes, daddy," said Elspie, taking up the discourse; "we can put you into the 

room that corresponds with Duncan's room at

shirt, and wearing the broad-brimmed hat usually affected by the Breton peasantry.  "Two Marats? 

Two spies?" screeched a woman. "Where are they?"  "Here is one," replied Paul Friche with a 

loud laugh: and with his large grimy hand he lifted the hat from his neighbour's head and threw it 

on the ground; "and there," he added as with long, bony finger he pointed to the house, so that 

you and he will be able to meet after your long illness. But there is another contrivance which Dan 

has been making for us--not for you, but for Old Peg.  Tell daddy about it, Dan."  "Like the chair," 

said Dan, "it is no novelty, except in this out-o'-the-way place.  You see, I have noticed that Old 

Peg is rather deaf--"  "Well, Tan," interrupted old McKay
