must have been found competent by an examination. The number of physicians =
in each town was=20

limited. They were divided into classes, and were subject to the government=
 of the Archiatri.=20

Penalties were imposed upon those guilty of malpractice or of poisoning. Th=
e Justinian=20

enactments contain abundant internal evidence of having been framed in the =
light of medical=20

knowledge. They contain provisions relating to sterility and impotence, rap=
e, disputed pregnancy,=20

legitimacy, diseased mental conditions, presumption of survivorship, poison=
ing, etc., which=20

indicate that the medical knowledge of the time was fully utilized in their=
 construction.[24]  The=20

Germanic peoples at about the same period possessed codes in which traces o=
f a rudimentary=20

medical jurisprudence existed. The most ancient of these was the Salic law =
(A.D. 422), in which=20

the penalties to be paid for wounds of different kinds are fixed. The Ripua=
rian law, of somewhat=20

later date, takes cognizance of the crime of poisoning. The laws of the Bav=
arians, Burgundians,=20

Frisians, Thuringians, and Visigoths contain practically nothing of medico-=
legal interest. The Lex=20

Alamannorum has numerous provisions relating to wounds, and expressly provi=
des that the=20

gravity of the injury shall be determined by a physician.[25]  During the p=
eriod of about a thousand=20

years, intervening between the Justinian and Caroline (_vide infra_) codes,=
 the advancement of=20

medicine and jurisprudence suffered almost complete arrest. The guilt or in=
nocence of an accused=20

person was determined rather by his own confession under torture, or by =E2=
=80=9Cthe judgment of God=E2=80=9D as=20

shown by ordeal or by judicial combat, than by testimony either expert or o=
