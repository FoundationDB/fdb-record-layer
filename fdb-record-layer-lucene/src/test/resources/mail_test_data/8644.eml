Now philodendron monstera examining the different gaps in the wall, he fixed on one which seemed to be the most frequented, and laid himself down close to it, in the attitude of a cat watching a mouse-hole.

against him, licked his hands, and fawned on him as a cat would have done. The sailor remained 

in the den for a couple of hours or more, during which time the tiger kept so close to him, that it 

was evident he would have some difficulty in getting out again, without the animal making his 

escape at the same time. The den consisted of two compartments. At last the keeper contrived to 

entice the tiger to the inner one, when he closed the slide, and the seaman was liberated.   Even a 

wolf, savage as that animal is, may, if caught young, and treated kindly, become tame.  A story is 

told of a wolf which showed a considerable amount of affection for its master. He had brought it up 

from a puppy, and it became as tame as the best-trained dog, obeying him in everything. Having 

frequently to leave home, and not being able to take the wolf with him, he sent it to a menagerie, 

where he knew it would be carefully looked after. At first the wolf was very unhappy, and evidently 

pined for its absent master. At length, resigning itself to its fate, it made friends with its keepers, 

and recovered its spirits.  Fully eighteen months had passed by, when its old master, returning 

home, paid a visit to the menagerie. Immediately he spoke, the wolf recognized his voice, and 

made strenuous efforts to get free. On being set at liberty it sprang forward, and leaped up and 

caressed him like a dog. Its master, however, left it with its keepers, and three years passed away 

before he paid another visit to the menagerie. Notwithstanding this lapse of time, the wolf again 

recognized him, and exhibited the same marks of affection.  On its master again going away, the 

wolf became gloomy and desponding, and refused its food, so that fears were entertained for its 

life.  It recovered its health, however, and though it suffered its keepers to approach, exhibited the 

savage disposition of its tribe towards all strangers.  The history of this wolf shows you that the 

fiercest tempers may be calmed by gentleness.   Arrant thieves as foxes are, with regard to their 

domestic virtues they eminently shine. Both parents take the greatest interest in rearing and 

educating their offspring. They provide, in their burrow, a comfortable nest, lined with feathers, for 

their new-born cubs. Should either parent perceive in the neighbourhood of their abode the 

slightest sign of human approach, they immediately carry their young to a spot of greater safety, 

sometimes many miles away. They usually set off in the twilight of a fine evening. The papa fox 

having taken a survey all round, marches first, the young ones march singly, and mamma brings 

up the rear. On reaching a wall or bank, papa always mounts first, and looks carefully around, 

rearing himself on his haunches to command a wider view. He then utters a short cry, which the 

young ones, understanding as "Come along!" instantly obey. All being safely over, mamma 

follows, pausing in her turn on the top of the fence, when she makes a careful survey, especially 

rearward. She then gives a responsive cry, answering to "All right!" and follows the track of the 

others. Thus the party proceed on their march, repeating the same fell as if I had been smitten 

with an axe.                                  * * * * *  I am prepared for the objections that may be made to my 

story.  I expect, as a matter of course, to be told that this was an optical illusion, or that I was 

suffering from pressure on the brain, or even that I laboured under an attack of temporary insanity. 

I have heard all these arguments before, and, if I may be forgiven for saying so, I have no desire 

to hear them again.  My own mind has been made up upon this subject for many a year.  All that I 

can say--all that I _know_ is--that Matthew Price came back from the dead to save my soul and 

the lives of those whom I, in my guilty rage, would have hurried to destruction.  I believe this as I 

believe in the mercy of Heaven and the forgiveness of repentant sinners.

fresh barrier.  When peril approaches, the wary old fox instructs his young ones to escape with 

turns and doublings on their path, while he himself will stand still on some brow or knoll, where he 

can both see and be seen. Having thus drawn attention to himself, he will take to flight in a 

different direction. Occasionally, while the young family are disporting themselves near their home, 

if peril approach, the parents utter a quick, peculiar cry, commanding the young ones to hurry to 

earth; knowing that, in case of pursuit, they have neither strength nor speed to secure their 

escape. They themselves will then take to flight, and seek some distant place of security.  The 

instruction they afford their young is varied. Sometimes the parents toss bones into the air for the 

young foxes to catch. If the little one fails to seize it before it falls to the ground, the parent will 

snap at him in reproof. If he catches it cleverly, papa growls his approval, and tosses it up again. 

This sport continues for a considerable time.   As I have said, no other animals so carefully 

educate their young in the way they should go, as does the fox. He is a good husband, an 

excellent father, capable of friendship, and a very intelligent member of society; but all the while, it 

must be confessed, an incorrigible rogue and thief.  A gentleman was lying one summer's day 

under the shelter of some shrubs on the banks of the Tweed, when his attention was attracted by 

the cries of wild-fowl, accompanied by a great deal of fluttering and splashing. On looking round,

brood of ducks, which had been disturbed by the drifting of a fir branch among them. After circling 

in the air for a little time, they again settled down on their feeding-ground.  Two or three minutes 

elapsed, when the same event again occurred. A branch drifted down with the stream into the 

midst of the ducks, and startled them from their repast. Once more they rose upon the wing, 

clamouring loudly, but when the harmless bough had drifted by, settled themselves down upon the 

water as before. This occurred so frequently, that at last they scarcely troubled themselves to 

flutter out of the way, even when about to be touched by the drifting bough.  The gentleman, 

meantime, marking the regular intervals at which the fir branches succeeded each other in the 

same track, looked for a cause, and perceived, at length, higher up the this agreement for keeping

a fox, which, having evidently sent them adrift, was eagerly watching their progress and the effect 

they produced. Satisfied with the result, cunning Reynard at last selected a larger branch of 

spruce-fir than usual, and couching himself down on it, set it adrift as he had done the others. The 

birds, now well trained to indifference, scarcely moved till he was in the midst of them, when, 

making rapid snaps right and left, he secured two fine young ducks as his prey, and floated 

forward triumphantly on his raft; while the surviving fowls, clamouring in terror, took to flight, and 

returned no more to the spot.   A labourer going to his work one morning sight of a fox stretched 

out at full length under a bush. Believing it to be dead, the man drew it out by the tail, and swung it 

about to assure himself of the fact. Perceiving no symptoms of life, he then threw it over his 

shoulder, intending to make a cap of the skin, and ornament his cottage wall with the brush. While 

the fox hung over one shoulder, his mattock balanced it on the other. The point of the instrument, 

as he walked along, every now and then struck against the ribs of the fox, which, not so dead as 

the man supposed, objected to this proceeding, though he did not mind being carried along with 

his head downward. Losing patience, he gave a sharp snap at that portion of the labourer's body 

near which his head hung. The man, startled by this sudden attack, threw fox and mattock to the 

ground, when, turning round, he espied the live animal making off at full speed.   I have still States.
