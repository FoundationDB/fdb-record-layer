Falling in with the gipsies, he traveled with them for six or eight weeks, =
receiving impressions of a=20

flexible, wanton, vagabond life that were never entirely to lose their infl=
uence upon his talent,=20

although his most temperate and scholarly biographer, M. Meaume, finds litt=
le of Bohemianism in=20

his subsequent manner of living. Felibien records that according to Callot'=
s own account, when he=20

found himself in such wicked company, "he lifted his heart to God and praye=
d for grace not to join=20

in the disgusting debauchery that went on under his eyes." He added also th=
at he always asked=20

God to guide him and to give him grace to be a good man, beseeching Him tha=
t he might excel in=20

whatever profession he should embrace, and that he "might live to be forty-=
three years old."=20

Strangely enough this most explicit administration was much hampered by the=
 character and=20

conduct of the generals on whom the detailed development and execution of t=
he plan devolved.=20

The friction thus arising was increased by mutual suspicions of political m=
otives between President=20

Polk, certain members of his cabinet, and the generals themselves.         =
*       *       *       *       *  In=20

this war the United States troops, though always outnumbered--in some cases=
 heavily--and=20

usually with the advantage of position against them, enjoyed such superiori=
ty both in _morale_=20

and in _mat=C3=A9riel_ that they were almost uniformly victorious. Their vi=
ctories, however, were by no=20

means easy; on the contrary, they were obtained only at the cost of no litt=
le bloody fighting and of=20

great loss of men. And, as is not unusual in like emergencies,=20


_
prophecy in outline of his future.  Arriving in Florence with his friends t=
he Bohemians, fortune=20

seemed about to be gracious to him. His delicate face with its indefinable =
suggestions of good=20

breeding attracted the attention of an officer of the Duke, who took the fi=
rst step toward fulfilling his=20

ambition by placing him with the painter and engraver, Canta Gallina, who t=
aught him design and=20

gave him lessons in the use of the burin. His taste was already for oddly f=
ormed or grotesque=20

figures, and to counteract this tendency Gallina had him copy the most beau=
tiful works of the great=20

masters.  Possibly this conventional beginning palled upon his boyish spiri=
t, or he may merely=20

have been impatient to reach Israel and behold with his own eyes the golden=
 city described in his=20

friend's letters. At all events, he shortly informed his master that he mus=
t leave him and push on to=20

Rome. Gallina was not lacking in sympathy, for he gave his pupil a mule and=
 a purse and plenty of=20

good advice, and started him on his journey.  Stopping at Siena, Callot gai=
ned his first notion of=20

the style, later to become so indisputably his own, from Duccio's mosaics, =
the pure unshadowed=20

outline of which he bore in mind when he dismissed shading and cross-hatchi=
ng from the=20

marvelously expressive little figures that throng his prints. He had hardly=
 entered Rome, however,=20

when some merchants from the town of Nancy, his birthplace, recognized him =
and bore him,=20

protesting, back to his home.  Once more he ran away, this time taking the =
route to Italy through=20

Savoy and leading adventurous days. In Turin he was met by his elder brothe=
r and again=20

ignominiously returned to his parents. But his persistence was not to go un=
rewarded. The third=20

time that he undertook to seek the light burning for him in the city of art=
, he went with his father's=20

blessing, in the suite of the ambassador dispatched to the Pope by the new =
duke, Henry II.  It is=20

said that a portrait of Charles the Bold, engraved by Jacques from a painti=
ng, was what finally=20

turned the scale in favor of his studying seriously with the purpose of mak=
ing art his profession. He=20

had gained smatterings of knowledge, so far as the use of his tools went, f=
rom Dumange Crocq,=20

an engraver and Master of the Mint to the Duke of Lorraine, and from his fr=
iend Israel's father,=20

chief painter to Charles III. He had the habit also of sketching on the spo=
t whatever happened to=20

attract his attention.  In truth he had lost but little time. At the age of=
 seventeen he was at work,=20

and very hard at work, in Rome under Tempesta. Money failing him, he became=
 apprenticed to=20

Philippe Thomassin, a French engraver, who turned out large numbers of rubb=
ishy prints upon=20

which his apprentices were employed at so much a day. Some three years spen=
t in this fashion=20

taught Callot less art than skill in the manipulation of his instruments. M=
uch of his early work is=20

buried in the mass of Thomassin's production, and such of it as can be iden=
tified is poor and=20

trivial. His precocity was not the indication of rapid progress. His drawin=
g was feeble and was=20

almost entirely confined to copying until 1616, when, at the age of twenty-=
four, he began regularly=20

to engrave his own designs, and to show the individuality of treatment and =
the abundant fancy that=20

promptly won for him the respect of his extravagance and inefficiency of th=
e quartermaster=E2=80=99s=20

department.[122]  The attack on Mexico began with the advance of Taylor=E2=
=80=99s army. Two battles,=20

Palo Alto, on May 8, 1846, and Resaca de la Palma, on the following day, we=
re required to drive=20

the Mexicans across the Rio Grande. Taylor then advanced from Matamoras thr=
ough Tamaulipas=20

into Nuevo Le=C3=B3n, and, after defeating the Mexicans in a three days=E2=
=80=99 battle, September 21=E2=80=9323, at=20

Monterey, the capital of Nuevo Le=C3=B3n, he captured that city. Saltillo, =
the capital of Coahuila, was=20

occupied by the United States troops on November 16th, and Victoria, the ca=
pital of Tamaulipas,=20

December 29th.  [Illustration: TAYLOR=E2=80=99S MARCH 1846=E2=80=931847]  I=
t had long before this become a=20



most important question whether the campaign should be confined to the occu=
pation and cutting-

off of northern Mexico, or whether the army should be pushed on toward the =
city of Mexico. Taylor=20

recommended the first of these two plans; but when asked his advice as to w=
hat should be done=20

further, and especially whether an expedition should be aimed at the city o=
f Mexico from near Vera=20

Cruz, he had been hesitating and non-committal in his answer.[123] Orders i=
ssued direct from=20

Washington, September 22, 1846, in connection with the scheme before it was=
 fully developed, to=20

General Patterson, one of Taylor=E2=80=99s subordinates, drew from Taylor h=
imself a resentful protest.[124]=20

Finally the plan of capturing Vera Cruz and marching thence upon the city o=
f Mexico was adopted=20

by Polk and his cabinet, with a little objection from Buchanan as to advanc=
ing beyond Vera=20

Cruz,[125] and Scott was elected to lead the expedition. Soon after his app=
ointment, he left=20

Washington, and about the end of December he reached Matamoras and began to=
 make=20

preparations for the attack on Vera Cruz. Part of Taylor=E2=80=99s men were=
 drawn away for the southern=20

campaign, and renewed complaints from him were added to the general chorus =
of discord and=20

dissatisfaction.[126]  Information of the shifting of the attack to the sou=
th reached Santa Anna=20

through intercepted despatches, and he at once conceived the project of a c=
ounter-stroke.=20

Advancing northward with an army of more than twenty thousand men, he came =
upon Taylor=20

February 23, 1847, with only about one-fourth that number at Buena Vista, a=
 few miles south of=20

Saltillo. The American troops gained a brilliant victory,[127] and with thi=
s the serious work of the=20

=E2=80=9Carmy of occupation=E2=80=9D was at an end.  [Illustration: GENERAL=
 SCOTT=E2=80=99S ENTRY INTO THE CITY=20

OF MEXICO  (From a print of the time)]  Attention was now centred on the so=
uthern campaign.=20

During the month of February, 1847, Scott=E2=80=99s troops were conveyed by=
 sea from Brazos Santiago=20

and concentrated on the island of Lobos, about sixty miles south of Tampico=
. On March 9th a=20

landing was made without opposition near Vera Cruz. With the co-operation o=
f the naval forces=20

under Commodore Conner the city was invested, and, after a brief siege culm=
inating in a sharp=20

bombardment, was captured, March 29, 1847.[128]  [Illustration: SCOTT=E2=80=
=99S MARCH to the City of=20

MEXICO]  Next in order was the advance upon the city of Mexico, which began=
 April 8th. The first=20

resistance was met at Cerro Gordo, where, on April 17th and 18th, Scott=E2=
=80=99s army of not more than=20

nine thousand drove thirteen thousand Mexicans, in disastrous defeat, from =
a=20


_
While he was in Thomassin's studio, it is reported that his bright charm of=
 face and manner gained=20

him the liking of Thomassin's young wife--much nearer in age to Callot than=
 to her husband--and=20

the jealousy of his master. He presently left the studio and Rome as well, =
never to return to either.=20

It is the one misadventure suggestive of erratic tendencies admitted to Cal=
lot's story by M.=20

Meaume, although other biographers have thrown over his life in Italy a suf=
ficiently lurid light,=20

hinting at revelries and vagaries and lawless impulses unrestrained. If, in=
deed, the brilliant frivolity=20

of Italian society at that time tempted him during his early manhood, it co=
uld only have been for a=20

brief space of years. After he was thirty all unquestionably was labor and =
quietness.  From Rome=20

he went to Florence, taking with him some of the plates he recently had eng=
raved. These at once=20

found favor in the eyes of Cosimo II, of the Medici then ruling over Tuscan=
y, and Callot was=20

attached to his person and given a pension and quarters in what was called,=
 "the artist's gallery."=20

At the same time he began to study under the then famous Jules Parigi, and =
renewed his=20

acquaintance with his old friend Canta Gallina, meeting in their studios th=
e most eminent artists of=20

the day--the bright day not yet entirely faded of the later Renaissance.  [=
Illustration: PORTRAIT OF=20

JACQUES CALLOT  _Engraved by Vosterman after the painting of Van Dyck_]  St=
ill his work was=20

copying and engraving from the drawings of others. Had he been under a mast=
er less interested=20

and sympathetic than the good Parigi, it is possible that his peculiar tale=
nt would never have=20

declared itself. At all events, Parigi urged him, and the urging seems to h=
ave been strong and well-

fortified position. Finally there was a series of battles near the city of =
Mexico, which culminated in=20

its capture, and which will be referred to further on.  Meanwhile another e=
ffort was made by Polk to=20

negotiate, an idea which even after the failure of the Slidell mission had =
been kept steadily in view.=20

*       *       *       *       *  In answer to the proposition to negotiat=
e which came through Trist, the=20

American commissioner, Santa Anna contrived to intimate that, if he were pa=
id ten thousand=20

dollars down and one million on the conclusion of peace, negotiations shoul=
d begin at once. After=20

consulting with several of his officers, in a conference held late in July =
or early in August, Scott=20

paid the ten thousand dollars.[129] Still no step was taken by the Mexicans=
 toward negotiation=20

until they were beaten in the engagements at Contreras, August 19th and 20t=
h, and Churubusco,=20

August 20, 1847. Then Scott himself proposed an armistice, which was accept=
ed August 24th.=20

Commissioners were appointed to meet Trist, and the effort to conclude a tr=
eaty began. Whether it=20

could have been accomplished at that stage of the =E2=80=9Cconquering=E2=80=
=9D on the basis of his instructions is=20

uncertain; but Trist=E2=80=99s wavering attitude undoubtedly served to make=
 the possibility much less. The=20

Mexican commissioners still refused to come to terms, and submitted counter=
-propositions which=20

were in conflict with those instructions, but which Trist referred to the a=
uthorities at=20

Washington.[130] As soon as unofficial news of what Trist had done was rece=
ived there, President=20

Polk, without waiting to hear from him directly, ordered his recall.[131]  =
In the mean time the=20

armistice had been terminated and the advance of the=20

precious talent for=20

designing on a very small scale the varied and complicated compositions wit=
h which his=20

imagination teemed. His taste for whatever was fantastic and irregular in a=
spect had not been=20

destroyed by his study of the beautiful. The Bohemian side of human nature,=
 the only nature for=20

which he cared, still fascinated his mind, whether it had or had not any in=
fluence upon his=20

activities, and Parigi's remonstrances were silenced by his appreciation of=
 the comic wit sparkling=20

in his pupil's sketches.  We see little of Callot among his friends of this=
 period, but the glimpses we=20

get reveal a lovable and merry youth in whose nature is a strain of sturdy =
loyalty, ardent in work=20

and patient in seeking perfectness in each individual task undertaken, but =
with a curious=20

contrasting impatience as well, leading him frequently to drop one thing fo=
r another, craving the=20

relaxation of change. An September 8th, and Chapultepec, September 13th, op=

the city of Mexico, which was occupied on September 14th.[132] Santa Anna a=
bdicated, and on=20

November 22d the new government announced to Trist that it had appointed co=
mmissioners to=20

negotiate. Trist had already received the letter recalling him; but, in spi=
te of this fact, he listened to=20

the suggestion of the Mexicans that they were not officially notified of hi=
s recall, and were anxious=20

to negotiate on the terms of his original instructions.  The negotiations t=
erminated with the treaty of=20

Guadalupe-Hidalgo, signed February 2, 1848. The boundary agreed upon was to=
 follow the Rio=20

Grande from its mouth to the line of New Mexico; that line westward and nor=
thward to the first=20

branch of the Gila it should cross; that branch and the Gila to the Colorad=
