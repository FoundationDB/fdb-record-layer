of the heather-burning: when on the other moors the shepherds and keepers were growling and 

quarrelling like rival leashes of collies, on Lord Ailine's ground everything was peace and 

quietness and good humour.  And then she had a vague impression that the next keeper would be 

merely a keeper; whereas Ronald was--Ronald.  'I'm sure I was half ashamed,' said he, 'when I 

got his lordship's letter.  It was as fair an offer as one man could make to another; or rather, half a 

dozen offers; for he said he would raise my wage, if that was what was wrong; or he would let me 

have another lad to help me in the kennels; or, if I was tired of the Highlands he would get me a 

place at his shooting in the south.  Well, I was sweirt to trouble his lordship

how I may be situated,' said he. 'And there's the railway expense--though I would not mind that
