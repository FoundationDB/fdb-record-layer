difficulties our former nursing did not have. Perhaps because the soldiers =
will probably not be=20

seriously ill and are likely to be a great deal more bored," Mildred Thornt=
on urged.  Sonya shook=20

her head.  "Mildred, it is a little embarrassing to have to speak of it, bu=
t please remember my=20

husband is something of a martinet in matters of Red Cross discipline. I am=
 afraid he will not think=20

we have the right to add a little girl to our responsibilities. However, th=
e child is with us now not by=20

our choice, and we must make her as comfortable as possible until we have s=
ome inspiration=20

concerning her. Miss Jamison, you will look after her, won't you, since she=
 seems to prefer you?"=20

But already Nora Jamison had assumed that the care of the little French gir=
l had been entrusted to=20

her as a matter of course.  Later, the journey through France and into Belg=
ium and thence into=20

Luxemburg became, not only for the American army but for the Red Cross unit=
s which=20

accompanied it, a triumphant procession.  In every little village along the=
ir route bells were rung,=20

schools closed while the children and the citizens gathered in the streets =
to shout their welcome.=20

Through the country at each crossroads groups of men, women and young peopl=
e were found=20

waiting to express their thankfulness either with smiles or tears.  Thirty-=
six hours after leaving their=20

hospital near Chateau-Thierry, Mrs. Clark and her Red Cross workers crossed=
 the frontier of=20

Belgium and entered the little town of Virton.  In Virton, at the Red Cross=
 headquarters, awaiting=20

them they found orders from Dr. David Clark. As promptly as possible they w=
ere to proceed to the=20

capital of Luxemburg and there establish a temporary Red Cross hospital. Dr=
. Hugh Raymond was=20

to take charge with Miss Blackstone as superintendent, the Red Cross nurses=
 assuming their=20

usual duties. Before their arrival arrangements for their reception would h=
ave been made and a=20

house secured for their temporary hospital.  This was necessary since along=
 the route of march=20

numbers of soldiers were being attacked by influenza and must be cared for.=
 Ordinary hospitals=20

were already overcrowded with wounded American soldiers who had been prison=
ers in Germany.=20

Therefore, obeying orders, this particular Red Cross unit entered Luxemburg=
 a few hours before=20

the arrival of General Pershing at the head of his victorious troops.  It w=
as early morning when the=20

Red Cross girls drove into the little duchy, which has occasioned Europe tr=
ouble out of all=20

proportion to its size. Actually the duchy of Luxemburg is only nine hundre=
d and ninety-nine=20

square miles and has a population of three hundred thousand persons.  Just =
as surely as=20

Germany tore up her treaty with Belgium as a "scrap of paper," when at the =
outbreak of the war it=20

suited her convenience, as surely had she marched her army across Luxemburg=
 in spite of the=20

protest of its young Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide.  However, when Germany c=
ontinued to use=20

Luxemburg as an occupied province, the Grand Duchess was supposed to have c=
hanged her=20

policy and to have become a German ally.  On the morning when the American =
Red Cross=20

entered her capital, the grey swarm of German soldiers was hurrying rapidly=
 homeward, broken=20

and defeated, while the American army under General Pershing was hourly exp=
ected.  To make=20

way for the more important reception and to give as little trouble as possi=
ble, the American Red=20

Cross drove directly to the house which had been set apart for their use. T=
he house proved to be a=20

large, old fashioned place with wide windows and a broad veranda, and on th=
e principal street of=20

the city not far from the Grand Ducal Palace.  After a few hours of intensi=
ve work toward=20

transforming a one-time private residence into a temporary hospital, the en=
tire staff deserted their=20

labors to gather on the broad veranda.  The news had reached them that Gene=
ral Pershing had=20

entered the capital city of Luxemburg and would pass their headquarters on =
his way to the Grand=20



Ducal Palace for his formal reception by the Grand Duchess.  Later a portio=
n of the American=20

army itself marched by.  From their balcony the American girls could see th=
e stars and stripes=20

mingling with the red, white and blue of the small principality.  Never in =
their past experience had=20

they seen a welcome to equal the welcome given by the citizens of Luxemburg=
 to the troops which=20

General Pershing had led to victory. If the Grand Ducal family had been won=
 over to the German=20

cause, how deeply the people of Luxemburg had sympathized with the allies w=
as proved by this=20

single day's greeting.  Together with the people in the streets the Red Cro=
ss workers found they=20

were shouting themselves hoarse. Yet the shouts were barely heard amid the =
blowing of whistles,=20

the ringing of bells.  In the hearts of the inhabitants of the tiny duchy a=
pparently there was a great=20

love for the soldiers of the greatest democracy in the world.  From every w=
indow along their route=20

of march flowers rained down upon the soldiers, children crowding close pre=
sented each American=20

doughboy with a bunch of chrysanthemums; one of them carried a banner on wh=
ich was inscribed,=20

"The Day of Glory has Arrived."  Turning to speak to Mildred Thornton who s=
tood beside her, Nona=20

Davis found to her surprise that her cheeks were wet with tears. She had no=
t been conscious of=20

them until this instant.  "It pays almost, doesn't it, Mildred, for all the=
 suffering we have witnessed=20

in Europe in the past four years to see the rejoicing of the little nations=
 of Europe over the victory=20

of democracy? Even if the little Grand Duchess is pro-German in sentiment, =
it is plain enough that=20

her people must have loathed the German occupation of their country. I woul=
d not be surprised if=20

the passing of our soldiers may not mean a change of government in Luxembur=
g. Under the=20

circumstances I wonder how long our Red Cross unit may remain?"  Mildred Th=
ornton shook her=20

head.  "Impossible to guess of course, Nona. And yet I am glad of the oppor=
tunity. We shall have=20

nursed in one more country in Europe and perhaps even little Luxemburg will=
 offer us new=20

experiences and new friends."     CHAPTER V  _Shoals_   DURING the thirty o=
dd years of her life,=20

Sonya Valesky, now Mrs. David Clark, had been through many and varied adven=
tures; some of=20

them, in her young womanhood in Russia, had been tragic, others merely diff=
icult. But after a few=20

days in Luxemburg, amid the effort to establish the temporary Red Cross hos=
pital, Sonya believed=20

that she had rarely suffered a more trying interlude.  It was not the actua=
l work of the hospital=20

arrangements or the care of the sick. Of the first Miss Blackstone took cha=
rge and she was=20

eminently capable; for the second Dr. Hugh Raymond was responsible. Both of=
 them had able=20

assistants. The upper part of the house was set apart for the care of the o=
fficers and soldiers=20

suffering from influenza, and there were about twenty cases; the second flo=
or was reserved as=20

sleeping quarters for the staff with a few extra rooms for patients who wer=
e ill and in need of=20

attention from other causes so they should not be exposed to contagion. On =
the lower floor was a=20

reception room, dining room and kitchen, with the drawing room for convales=
cents.  But as usual=20

Sonya Clark's task was looking after the Red Cross nurses, seeing not only =
that they were in good=20

health, but as happy and contented as possible, giving their best service a=
nd in little danger of=20

breakers ahead.  Nevertheless, within forty-eight hours after the passing o=
f the American troops=20

through Luxemburg, it appeared to Sonya that some unexpected change had tak=
en place in her=20

group of Red Cross nurses.  What they were actually ordered to do they did =
in a fairly dutiful=20

fashion, but the old enthusiasm, the old passionate desire for service had =
vanished. Among the=20

entire group of nurses a relaxation of discipline had taken place. The exci=
tement of their journey,=20

the knowledge that the war had ended in the allied victory, a natural desir=
e for pleasure after so=20



long a strain, apparently possessed them alike, except Nora Jamison who was=
 comparatively new=20

to the work, and seemed in every way an unusual girl.  Frankly Bianca Zoli =
confessed to Sonya,=20

not long after their arrival in Luxemburg, that she was weary of the endles=
s waiting upon the=20

nurses and patients and needed a short rest. And Sonya agreed that this was=
 true. Bianca was=20

younger than any member of their Red Cross unit and had been faithful and u=
ntiring in her=20

devotion for many months during the final allied struggle for victory. More=
over, Bianca also=20

appeared slightly depressed and Sonya wisely guessed this was partly due to=
 the long separation=20

from Carlo Navara, which Bianca must see was inevitable. With his regiment =
Carlo was moving=20

toward the Rhine and nothing was apt to be less in his mind for the time be=
ing than his friendship=20

for the young girl whom he undoubtedly regarded only in a semi-brotherly sp=
irit composed of=20

indifference and affection.  Since the greater part of the nursing at the t=
emporary hospital in=20

Luxemburg was the care of the soldiers who were ill with influenza, and fee=
ling that Bianca was=20

not altogether in the right state of health to battle with the contagion, S=
onya requested Miss=20

Blackstone to permit her to have a half holiday, doing no work that was not=
 voluntary.  But with=20

Nona Davis and Mildred Thornton, the two Red Cross nurses who had given the=
 most valuable=20

personal service, since the outbreak of the war, the situation was more ser=
ious and far more=20

difficult to meet.  They did not neglect their duties, this would have been=
 impossible to either of=20

them, and yet in a way it was plain that they were no longer wholly absorbe=
d by them and to use=20

an old expression, their hearts were no longer in what they were doing.  Ye=
t Sonya understood;=20

both girls were engaged to be married to young American officers who were a=
t present in the=20

United States. With the signing of the armistice they had hoped to return h=
ome. It was possible=20

they had made a mistake in agreeing to Dr. Clark's request that they remain=
 for a time longer in=20

Europe, forming a part of his Red Cross unit, who were to care for the sold=
iers of the American=20

Army of Occupation.  With Mildred Thornton the engagement was comparatively=
 recent. During=20

the latter part of July she had nursed through a dangerous illness, followi=
ng a wound, an American=20

lieutenant[A] who, together with Carlo Navara, had crossed into the German =
lines, securing=20

important secret information, afterwards invaluable to Marshal Foch.  Of lo=
nger standing was Nona=20

Davis's romance, which had not been of such plain sailing. In the early mon=
ths after the entry of=20

the United States into the world war, in an American camp in France, she ha=
d met and renewed=20

an acquaintance with Lieutenant John Martin which had begun as children yea=
rs before in the old=20

city of Charleston, South Carolina. Soon after Lieutenant Martin had declar=
ed his affection, but=20

believing him arrogant and domineering, Nona had not at that time returned =
his love.  Later,=20

meeting again upon a United States hospital ship, coming back from France, =
Nona had discovered=20

Lieutenant Martin, now Captain Martin, blinded through a gallant action on =
the battlefields of=20

France.  It was then that their former positions were reversed, for Captain=
 Martin would not accept=20

a devotion which he believed born of pity and declined marrying Nona unless=
 his sight were=20

restored. A short time before a letter from New York announced that after a=
n operation, Captain=20

Martin had the right to believe his sight would be fully regained. Therefor=
e would Nona marry him=20

as soon as it could be arranged? And Nona's answer had been to cable, "Yes.=
"[B]  However, both=20

Mildred Thornton and Nona Davis having already sacrificed so much to their =
four years of Red=20

Cross service in Europe, had decided to make this ultimate sacrifice in the=
 postponing of their=20

happiness. Yet here during the temporary pause of their Red Cross unit in L=
uxemburg, Sonya was=20



able to see that the two girls were finding their self-surrender harder to =
accept bravely than they=20

had anticipated. Whenever it was possible without neglecting their duties t=

_
herself often ignored or forgotten. Sometimes she feared that they might ha=
rbor a slight=20

resentment, because it was her husband, Dr. David Clark, who had asked the =
personal sacrifice.=20

With two other of her Red Cross nurses Sonya had neither much sympathy nor =
understanding.=20

Ruth Carroll had never interested her particularly; she was a large, quiet =
girl, ordinarily a dutiful=20

and fairly reliable nurse, but without special gifts, although as a matter =
of fact, Dr. Clark had not=20

shared in his wife's disparaging opinion.  However, Sonya knew herself to b=
e prejudiced and not=20

so much by Ruth herself as by reason of her close friendship with Theodosia=
 Thompson and the=20

younger girl's undoubted influence upon her.  Thea had been right in her su=
pposition that Mrs.=20

Clark neither liked nor trusted her particularly, although Sonya herself ha=
d scarcely been aware of=20

her own point of view until after the beginning of the journey of her Red C=
ross unit toward=20

Germany. Since then Sonya was not at all sure that Thea might not prove an =
uncomfortable if not=20

an actually mischievous influence.  One of Dr. Clark's old students at a pr=
ominent New York=20

Medical University and afterwards his assistant, Dr. Hugh Raymond, was a yo=
ung physician in=20

whom the older man had extraordinary confidence and for whom he hoped great=
 things. In the=20

Red Cross hospital near Chateau-Thierry he had done splendid and untiring w=
ork. But both Sonya=20

and her husband had often smiled over the young doctor's apparent dislike o=
f women and girls.=20

Not even with Sonya herself had he been willing to be more than coldly frie=
ndly.  Yet since the=20

movement of their unit toward the Rhine, Sonya had noticed an odd change in=
 him. At first it had=20

appeared as if Thea's attempts to make him show an interest in her had simp=
ly annoyed him.=20

Later she seemed to provoke him. Recently Sonya believed Thea was having a =
marked effect=20

upon him, sometimes aggravating and at other times pleasing him. And althou=
gh Sonya believed=20

she understood human nature, she also realized that nothing would irritate =
her husband more=20

profoundly than to discover any kind of personal feeling existing between h=
is nurses and=20

physicians. During all the Red Cross work in Europe from this complication =
they had been=20

singularly free.  Moreover, Sonya did not consider that Theodosia Thompson =
was seriously=20

interested in Dr. Raymond. It was her personal opinion that Thea simply des=
ired admiration and=20

attention, because her nature was restless and dissatisfied.  And it was wi=
th the two nurses, Ruth=20

Carroll and Theodosia Thompson, that Sonya had her first real grievance sin=
ce the beginning of=20

her Red Cross work.  Among the patients who had been brought to the tempora=
ry Luxemburg=20

hospital was Major James Hersey, who had been in command of a battalion nea=
r Chateau-Thierry=20

and had been taken ill with influenza along the route of the march toward G=
ermany.  Perhaps=20

Major Jimmie had been longing too ardently to accompany his picked troops t=
o the left bank of the=20

Rhine; however, he was at present pretty seriously ill.  All day Sonya had =
been caring for him and=20

at about four o'clock in the afternoon she was beginning to feel that she w=
as growing too tired to=20

be left alone. Major Hersey was delirious and already it was long past the =
hour when Theodosia=20

Thompson had been expected to relieve her. Yet she continued to wait patien=
tly, not daring to=20

leave her charge even for a moment.  Four o'clock passed and then five and =
no one entered the=20

sick room, not even one of the Red Cross physicians, and Sonya had been exp=
ecting a call from=20

Dr. Raymond some time during the afternoon.  At a little after five, Miss B=
lackstone stepped in=20

unannounced. She was the superintendent of the hospital and Sonya discovere=
d her looking both=20

worried and worn. She was a large, plain, middle-aged woman who had worked =
with Dr. Clark for=20

a number of years before his marriage to Sonya, and although she and Sonya =
had not liked each=20



other in the early days of their acquaintance, they had become far more fri=
endly since.  "I am more=20

sorry than I can say, Mrs. Clark, not to have sent some one in to help you,=
 but the most amazing=20

thing has happened. Just after lunch Miss Thompson and Miss Carroll asked p=
ermission to take a=20

short motor ride with Dr. Raymond and Dr. Mendel. Dr. Raymond assured me hi=
mself that they=20

would not be gone over an hour. It has been much nearer three hours and I h=
ardly know what to=20

do. Some accident must have occurred. What do you think we should do?"  Son=
ya shrugged her=20

shoulders.  "Do? Why nothing but wait. I have an idea nothing has happened =
beyond the fact that=20

they have forgotten their responsibilities."  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote A: See =
Red Cross Girls with=20

United States Marines.]  [Footnote B: See Red Cross Girls Afloat with the F=
lag.]     CHAPTER VI=20

_The Ride_   IT was true, as Miss Blackstone had said, that the little part=
y of four, the two Red=20

Cross nurses and two physicians, had started out with the intention of taki=
ng only a short drive and=20

returning to the hospital in plenty of time for their duties.  And in spite=
 of the fact that Sonya might=20

be cherishing an unreasonable prejudice, the drive had been proposed by Dr.=
 Raymond first to=20

Theodosia Thompson with the suggestion that she ask Ruth Carroll to accompa=
ny them and that=20

he invite Dr. Leon Mendel who was also one of the Red Cross staff.  Early i=
n the morning of the=20

same day a note had been sent to the hospital and a motor car offered to th=
e American Red Cross=20

unit during their stay in Luxemburg. As the note had been delivered to Dr. =
Raymond he had=20

considered it only courtesy to accept the kindness. He had also been quite =
selfishly interested in=20

seeing the capital city of Luxemburg and the neighboring country and in enj=
oying a short respite=20

from his continuous work of establishing the temporary hospital.  If Sonya =
was annoyed by the=20

young doctor's attitude toward Thea Thompson, assuredly he was more so. Cer=
tainly he was not=20

at present under the impression that he actually liked her, only that she h=
ad somehow made him=20

realize that he must have always appeared too self-centered and too serious=
, and that he needed=20

waking up. And certainly Thea was stimulating and now and then amusing.  Th=
is afternoon as he=20

was feeling tired he proposed that she occupy the front seat of the little =
motor car with him, Ruth=20

and Dr. Mendel sitting in the rear.  Following no guide except their own im=
pressions they drove=20

through the city, first past the Grand Ducal Palace then the handsome resid=
ences of the nobility=20

and finally to the open country on the outskirts of the city.  To all four =
of the occupants of the car it=20

seemed to have had wings, so short a time did their drive absorb.  Neverthe=
less Thea and Dr.=20

Raymond had not enjoyed each other particularly.  They were both tired and =
Thea was having one=20

of the attacks of depression from which she often suffered. She looked both=
 homely and pale, and=20

even her eyes were less blue beneath their straight, red-brown lashes. Only=
 her red hair breaking=20

into irrepressible little waves under her small hat was full of life and ch=
arm.  Reaching the end of=20

the main road from which two country lanes branched off into less inhabited=
 portions of the=20

countryside, Dr. Raymond turned to speak to Ruth Carroll and Dr. Mendel.  "=
I am sorry, it seems=20

to me our ride has scarcely begun, and yet I feel we had best turn back her=
e. We might allow=20

ourselves a little more time but I am afraid if we try one of these unexplo=
red roads we may lose=20

ourselves somewhere."  Ruth made a little nod of agreement even though her =
expression revealed=20

disappointment. Dr. Mendel made no reply.  But unexpectedly Dr. Raymond fel=
t a hand laid lightly=20

on his coat sleeve.  "Please do go a little further," Thea begged. "I wonde=
r if you know that=20

although I am a country girl I have ridden in automobiles only a few times =
in my life before coming=20

to France."  Hesitating the young doctor slowed down his car as if expectin=
g to turn around.  "I am=20



not in the habit of neglecting my duty for any reason whatsoever, Miss Thom=
pson. I have just=20

explained that I dared not attempt a strange country road for fear we might=
 go astray and our=20

return to the hospital be seriously delayed."  Undoubtedly the young Red Cr=
oss doctor's manner=20

was self-righteous and precise, but in answer Thea laughed.  It was an odd =
laugh which made him=20

flush uncomfortably.  "Oh, please do go back then at once!" she said. "Noth=
ing would make me=20

ask you to disregard your duty. Really Dr. Raymond, it is a wonderful exper=
ience to know any one=20

who so perfectly answers all the requirements of a model character. Besides=
 I know you would=20

never do anything because I asked you, although as a matter of fact, we all=
 have the right to our=20

usual two hours off duty this afternoon and less than half of that time has=
 gone by."  There was a=20

little sting of bad temper in Thea Thompson's manner and words which undoub=
tedly were her=20

heritage along with her brilliant red-gold hair.  Instead of replying Dr. R=
aymond drove his car, not=20

backward toward the hospital as he had announced his intention of doing, bu=
t into one of the=20

country roads leading into an entirely unknown locality.  It would have bee=
n difficult for him to have=20

explained his impetuous action.  Half an hour later, at the end of a road w=
hich led apparently=20

nowhere, Dr. Raymond stopped his car.  "I think I have already managed to l=
ose the way, thanks=20

to you, Miss Thompson," he announced irritably, "However, I suppose we can =
simply turn around=20

and go back. Certainly this part of the country is entirely uninteresting w=
ithout a house or an=20

individual in sight. I was very foolish to agree to your request and shall =
certainly reproach myself if=20

any one has been in special need of me at the hospital. I only trust we may=
 be able to return as=20

quickly as we have made the trip."  However, Thea made no reply to this rep=
roachful speech=20

except to jump to her feet.  "Look!" she cried dramatically. "What a perfec=
tly charming picture in=20

that field over there! I told you I was from Kentucky and yet I never saw a=
ny one ride so=20

beautifully!"  Naturally Thea's companions followed her suggestion.  Just b=
eyond the end of their=20

road was a wide open field thick with winter stubble. In the centre was a t=
all hurdle intended for=20

jumping.  Riding toward this hurdle at a swift pace was a young girl; she w=
as wearing a close=20

fitting, scarlet riding habit, a little dark hat of some kind and high ridi=
ng boots.  Her horse was=20

almost equally slim and beautiful, and horse and rider had the suggestion o=
f oneness which is the=20

attribute of perfect riding.  There was no other human being in sight.  The=
 girl was making straight=20

for the hurdle. Evidently she and her horse were both in the habit of jumpi=
ng for neither showed=20

the least sign of nervousness.  Breathless with admiration and interest the=
 two American girls and=20

their companions watched.  The horse rose in the air, his head a little for=
ward, the rider holding the=20

bridle with just the right degree of freedom and firmness.  She was sitting=
 perfectly still, her body in=20

entire accord with the movement of her horse. No one beholding her would ha=
ve dreamed of an=20

accident. Yet when the horse had actually cleared the hurdle without diffic=
ulty and had reached the=20

ground on the further side, the girl must have released her hold. In any ev=
ent she fell forward over=20

the horse's head, one of the front hoofs striking her.  First out of the ca=
r was Thea Thompson=20

followed by Dr. Raymond, then Ruth and the other Red Cross physician.  The =
girl they found to be=20

unconscious from a wound in her forehead.  "I don't see why we seem to be i=
n the habit of=20

rescuing people nearly every time I go out in a motor car," said Thea. "Cer=
tainly I never saw so=20

pretty a girl as this one, I hope she is not seriously hurt."  Dr. Raymond =
wore his most professional=20

air.  "It is impossible to say at present," he returned severely.     CHAPT=
ER VII  _An Unexpected=20

Situation_   "BUT I don't wish to leave the hospital, I am comfortable here=
 and Mrs. Clark says=20



they are pleased to have me. Besides I could not possibly be moved just now=
, I am sure I could=20

not endure it."  The young girl who was talking lay surrounded by pillows i=
n a wide, old-fashioned=20

bed in the American Red Cross hospital in Luxemburg.  Partly from excitemen=
t and also because=20

it was characteristic, a brilliant color flamed the girl's cheeks. At prese=
nt there was a little frown=20

between her dark, finely lined brows.  "You must be glad not to have me at =
home for a time,=20

knowing how we disagree on every important question. And, as for my absence=
 from the palace, I=20

am sure it can only be a relief. You know just how popular I am there at pr=
esent in the midst of--"=20

The woman who was standing beside the bed, leaning over at this instant pla=
ced her fingers on=20

the girl's lips.  "Don't talk nonsense and under no circumstances speak of =
so serious a matter=20

where we may be overheard by strangers, my dear child. Please realize that =
the Americans are=20

unknown people to us and if there are reasons why it is best we should be c=
ordial, there is an=20

even more important reason why, at present, we should keep our own council.=
 A girl's opinions on=20

matters of state are really not vital, unless the girl chances to be the Gr=
and Duchess Marie=20

Adelaide. As her cousin you perhaps take yourself too seriously. But I am n=
ot offering you advice,=20

merely telling you that your father desires that you be moved to your own h=
ome as soon as your=20

physicians think it advisable. The court physician will call on you at the =
hospital this afternoon.=20

Both your father and I are at a loss to understand how you managed to fall =
from your horse when=20

ordinarily you are so skilful a rider."  The speaker was a severe, elderly =
person, rather massive,=20

and dressed in a heavy black silk gown, with her white hair piled high unde=
r an imposing bonnet=20

and her thin lips drawn into an annoyed line.  Nevertheless, she managed to=
 keep the tones of her=20

voice fairly even.  "Naturally enough I realize, Charlotta, that you would =
refuse to be influenced by=20

me, although for that matter you have never been influenced by any one from=
 the time you were a=20

child."  The girl bit her lips.  "I am afraid I am not well enough to argue=
 at present and my=20

unfortunate disposition, Tante, is rather a time-worn subject between us. I=

of the girl on the bed and going closer heard her whisper:  "Do please come=

een minutes later, it was=20

then after five o'clock and dusk was gathering in the fine, old-fashioned c=
hamber, so Bianca Zoli=20

quietly sat down without speaking in the chair which had just been vacated =
by the elderly=20

countess.  The girl upon the bed appeared to be asleep at the moment, but a=
s Bianca had no=20

other duty to occupy her it struck her that it might be entertaining to sit=
 in the big, strange room=20

watching her companion and thinking of her story, or at least of its brief =
outline which was all she=20

knew at present.  Having witnessed the girl's accident and finding her unco=
nscious and therefore=20

unable to explain her name or identity, it had appeared to both the young A=
merican physicians and=20

nurses that the best solution would be to bring her as swiftly as possible =
to their own hospital. After=20

she had received the necessary attention there would be time and opportunit=
y to discover her=20

family and friends.  A few hours afterwards, when the girl herself returned=
 to consciousness, she=20

explained that she was the young Countess Charlotta Scherin and lived with =
her father and aunt=20

on their estate at a short distance from the city. The greater part of her =
time, however, she spent at=20

the Grand Palace with her cousins, the Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide and her=
 five younger=20

sisters.  She seemed to be in a great deal of pain and yet not particularly=
 unhappy over her=20

accident, only asking that her father be informed that she was in safe hand=
s. And if it were=20

possible and not too much trouble could she remain at the American Red Cros=
s hospital until her=20

recovery?  Yet Bianca had only considered her companion for a few moments w=
hen she became=20

aware that the other girl had opened her eyes and was looking with the deep=
est interest at her.  "I=20

am so glad to have the chance to know American girls," she began. "It may s=
trike you as odd but I=20

have wanted to know them all my life and now through my accident I am to ha=
ve the opportunity.=20

But you look very young and fragile to have undertaken Red Cross work durin=
g the war. I believe it=20

is the courage, the way in which you go ahead and do what you wish and face=
 the consequences=20

afterwards, that I so much admire."  Bianca shook her head.  "It is odd you=
r saying this to me of all=20

persons, because I used to feel a good deal as you do. You see I am not alt=
ogether an American=20

girl; my mother was an Italian and my father an American, but I have been l=
iving in the United=20

States and I confess I have tried to make myself as like one as possible. B=
ut do you think you=20

ought to talk? I'll talk to you if you like, although I am not very interes=
ting; I'm afraid you must be=20

suffering a great deal."  Bianca made this final remark because her compani=
on was evidently=20

struggling to keep back the tears which had suddenly filled her eyes.  "Yes=
, do please talk to me, I=20

am suffering, but I think it is more because I am worried and unhappy than =
because I am in such=20

pain that I lose my self-control. I have always prided myself on being able=
 to endure physical pain.=20

What are you thinking about?"  Bianca's large dark eyes which were her only=
 southern inheritance=20

had unexpectedly assumed a questioning expression, although her lips had fr=
amed no question.=20

"Why, I was merely thinking of how odd life is and how few persons, even yo=
ung girls are=20

particularly happy. A moment ago I was sitting here envying you because you=
r life seemed so=20

wonderful to me. You have been brought up amid wealth and have a title of y=
our own and live a=20

part of the time in a palace with real duchesses. I suppose my speech does =
not sound very=20

democratic, yet I think you might find a good many American girls who would=
 envy you for these=20

same reasons."  "Then they would be extremely stupid," the other girl answe=
red, "because=20

freedom is sometimes the most important thing in the world to an individual=
 as it may be to a state.=20

aunt both of whom=20

were twice the age of the girl's own mother. Then remember her mother was F=
rench and the girl=20

always loved only the things which concerned her mother, had learned to spe=
ak her language and=20

had written letters to all her family, but had never been allowed to visit =
them because the girl's=20

father and aunt believed only in German ideals and in German customs and wi=
shed to separate=20

her wholly from her mother's country and people. Moreover, they had neither=
 of them ever been=20

able to forgive her because she had not been a boy and so been trained for =
the army, the German=20

army if possible. Then suppose the girl had loved only the outdoors and hor=
ses and dogs as if she=20

had been a boy, but because she was a girl had to be trained in all the Ger=
man ways. As for living=20

in a palace, it is hard sometimes to do and say the proper thing all the ti=
me, when you feel they=20

don't believe in the things you believe. Oh, I am not saying the fault is n=
ot mine--"  The girl stopped=20

an instant.  "But I was not supposed to be talking about myself, still you =
must have guessed."  "I=20

should not have guessed unless you wished me to guess," Bianca replied in t=
he prim little fashion=20

of her childhood which she had never lost from her manner and which amused =
and pleased her=20

friends.  "No, you would not have guessed, you are a dear," the Countess Ch=
arlotta answered with=20

an impulsiveness which was an entire contrast to Bianca's nature.  "But wha=
t I wanted to explain=20

to you is that you were envying what you thought were my circumstances. You=
 were not really=20

thinking of me at all. You see one might be a princess and be very unhappy =
and one might be a=20

very humble person and just the opposite. Then I think we ought to realize =
that a princess may be=20

very horrid and a beggar maid most wonderful."  The young countess hesitate=
d.  "I thought that=20

what I have just said is what Americans believed. Don't they think that hum=
an beings are equal=20

and that it all depends on what they do with their own lives, what they are=
 able to make of=20

themselves?"  Bianca shook her head.  "I don't know, you had better talk to=
 some one else on this=20

question instead of to me. I am not at all clever, even my best friends, So=
nya Clark and Carlo=20

Navara, do not think I am clever. But there is one thing I understand at pr=
esent. You have told me=20

a great many interesting facts about yourself, but there is something else =
on your mind which you=20

have not confided to me. It is something which makes you wish you were an A=
merican girl=20

because you believe in that case you could do what you like. I think you wi=
sh to confide in some=20

one, but can't quite decide. If I were in your place I would try not to wor=
ry until you are better, then=20

if you want some one to talk to, don't choose me. I should never be able to=

worthwhile advice. But talk to Mrs. Clark, Sonya Clark. She has had a very =
unusual life and is one=20

of the most wonderful friends in the world!"  The older girl was by this ti=
me lying back on her=20

ly, "I would not be=20

CHAPTER VIII  _The Countess's Story_   A FEW days later it had become unnec=
essary for the=20

little Countess Charlotta to confide her secret to Bianca Zoli, or Sonya, o=
r to any one else at the=20

temporary Red Cross hospital in the capital city of Luxemburg. Already her =
history had been=20

openly discussed by visitors to the hospital, even by the servants who were=
 assisting with the=20

household work.  It was a well-known fact, apparently, that marriage was be=
ing arranged for the=20

youthful countess by her father and aunt to an elderly German nobleman.  No=
r was the little=20

countess's opposition to the match, her refusal to consider it as a possibi=
lity any more of a secret=20

than the knowledge that no attention was being paid her protests.  Inquirin=
g the name of the girl=20

who might be regarded as the prettiest and the most wilful among the daught=
ers of the noble=20

families of Luxemburg, one undoubtedly would have been told, Charlotta Sche=
rin. During the past=20

four years perhaps her mixture of German and French blood had been a distur=
bing inheritance.=20

Shortly after the passing of a portion of the American Army of Occupation t=
hrough the little=20

country, many were the rumors and talks of political changes and readjustme=
nts which would=20

probably take place, but to these the small American Red Cross unit decided=
 to give little heed.=20

One thing they were obliged to hear, the Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide had n=
ot pleased all her=20

subjects by her surrender to German ideas and designs during the recent yea=
rs when the German=20

army had used her kingdom as a passageway to France.  In spite of her verba=
l protest against the=20

breaking of the treaty which declared her country neutral, once the Germans=
 had entered her=20

duchy the Grand Duchess had appeared to sympathize with the invaders.  Now,=
 whether it was=20

the world talk of democracy, the victory of the allies, or the old love of =
the little duchy of=20

Luxemburg for France, the people of the small kingdom were assuredly consid=
ering a change of=20

government.  Yet this problem did not trouble or affect the affairs of the =
Red Cross hospital. Nor=20

did the little Countess Charlotta appear deeply interested, insisting that =
her family would make the=20

same effort to compel her marriage without regard to political reforms.  Ce=
rtainly the young=20

Luxemburg countess, whatever her upbringing, was not a reserved character. =
Instead she seemed=20

to love nothing so well as to discuss her own past, present and future with=
 the group of American=20

girls and to have them tell her as much as they would of their own historie=
s.  One way or another=20

apparently the Countess Charlotta was in the habit of managing to do what s=
he liked.  The thing=20
