Jack and Stew were off.  The fog was gone, and the moon bright. Jack was as=
tonished as he=20

climbed into the sky. As far as he could see  lungs were pale, reddish, not=
 much distended; there=20

were a few  dilated air-cells toward the anterior border; hemorrhages irreg=
ularly  dispersed over=20

the surface of the lung, varying in number and size.  The right cavities of=
 the heart contained dark=20

 even the smallest=20

branches, were gorged with dark blood. Page adds that when the great  vesse=

We're going back to the Philippines, boy! And we're going back to stay."  A=

again. With oxygen masks in place they climbed to the substratosphere, then=
 headed for=20

Mindanao at incredible speed.  "Wonderful!" Jack breathed. "No Zero will ev=
er catch up with us=20

now."  "And we'd better not let them," Stew warned. "You remember the order=
s--no dogfights with=20

those cookies today."  The first faint streaks of dawn were showing when a =
gray bulk close to the=20

surface of the sea loomed up ahead of them.  "There!" Jack exclaimed. "Take=
 a good look! It's the=20

as the north entrance to=20

a deep bay.  "We follow the shore line until we are at the center of the ba=

there."  They dropped to ten thousand feet, then slowed down their plane an=
d zoomed along over=20

the shore line.  They arrived at the target too soon for a clear view. For =
all that, they found=20

something to do.  "There's a nasty little Zero on our tail," Stew exclaimed=

"Put on your oxygen mask," Jack commanded with a grin. "We'll go up into th=

 Jack, as if by some=20

The SECOND STAGE begins with the demand for air and lasts till unconsciousn=

It is characterized by frantic efforts to breathe, efforts in which the ent=

added in the next breath, "we'll just go down and see what ships there are =
