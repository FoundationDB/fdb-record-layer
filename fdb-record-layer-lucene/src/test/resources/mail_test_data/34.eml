mixed in a chamber with explosive gas from kerosene. This mixture is ignite=
d under terrific=20

pressure, then carried round a right-angle bend and blown through fans that=
 somehow give it a lot=20

more power."  The girl was silent. Did she understand? He wondered.  But no=
w the man in the=20

cockpit was ready for one more move. Once again he set the motor howling. T=
his time however he=20

released the brakes, dropped his lantern into the cockpit, touched the acce=
lerator, and went=20

gliding away into the night.  Jack had watched his every move. "That," he w=
hispered, "is about the=20

easiest flying plane in the world. I could fly it right now."  "So could--"=
 The girl stopped, then added,=20

"Yes, yes, I am sure you could."  "I will, too," Jack told himself, but did=
 not say it aloud. No use=20

telling too much.  They listened to the plane until its strange wail faded =
into nothing.  "He's gone,"=20

the girl said, half rising.  "I think he will be back," Jack said, remainin=
g in his place. "I want to find=20

out all I can," he added. The girl settled back in her place.  "That's the =
fastest plane in the world,"=20

Jack whispered. "I have seen it take off in daylight. In the air close to e=
arth, it takes lots of fuel, but=20

in the stratosphere, where other planes can't travel because there's no air=
 for the propeller to bite=20

into, this jet plane goes like the wind on just about no fuel at all."  "O-=
o-o!" the girl murmured=20

excitedly.  "They left a scrapbook telling all about it down there on the r=
ocks," he explained. "I got=20

a look at it. Wish I'd taken it with me, but you see, I thought those first=
 two men might be our=20

friends. You don't take books from friends."  "No, you don't," she agreed. =
 "Say!" he exclaimed in a=20

hoarse whisper. "Who are you? Where did you come from? Those natives are no=
t your people."=20

"They are not my people," she agreed. "My home is far away. When you need t=
o know more you=20

shall be told. Is that fair?"  "Fair enough," said the boy.  The jet plane =
came screaming back. Jack=20

watched intently while the pilot put the ship to bed for the night. Then he=
 said:  "We'd better go."=20

When they reached the well-beaten trail he said, "Thanks a lot. I'll be see=
ing you."  "I'll be seeing=20

you," she repeated. He went one way, she the other, into the night.  As he =
approached his own=20

camp Jack saw no sign of life there. The fire had burned out. Nothing moved=
. All was silence and=20

darkness.  "It's like returning to an empty house at midnight," he told him=
self.  Dark forebodings=20

took possession of his mind. Had those original pilots of the jet plane tol=
d the others of their camp=20

here on the island, and had the three Japs put an end to Stew's carefree li=
fe?  "Stew!" he called=20

softly. "Stew! Where are you?"  "Can't have those fellows hearing me," he m=
urmured. "What's=20

happened to Stew?"  All of a sudden there came the clatter of boots on the =
rocks. Instantly he=20

snapped out his light.  "That you, Stew?" he asked.  "Sure is," came in a f=
amiliar voice. "I thought=20

they got you for sure."  "Who? Those jet plane fellows?"  "No. The cannibal=
s."  "Forget that=20

cannibal stuff," Jack laughed. "Those people are our friends. But we've got=
 trouble, all the same."=20

"Why? What's up?" Stew dropped to a place beside Jack on the rock.  "Plenty=
. There are five men=20

over at the jet plane now, two Germans--"  "Ger--"  "Two Germans and three =
Japs, and they've got=20

machine guns."  Stew whistled, then he exclaimed: "It's a good thing Ted's =
going to look us up."=20

"Ted? Look us up? Where'd you get that idea?" Jack demanded in sudden surpr=
ise.  "I got that=20

Jap radio to work. There's been some sort of fight. Ted was down in the muc=
h effect on the=20

resistance. As the current continues the resistance diminishes. Thus in the=
 case of McElvaine the=20

resistance between the immersed hands was at the beginning 800 ohms and at =
the end of the=20

contact of fifty seconds had decreased to 516 ohms. In this case, when the =
current of 1,500 volts=20

was applied from the forehead to the leg, the resistance was practically st=
eady at only 214 ohms.=20



Of course the small resistance in these cases (electrocutions) depends larg=
ely on the perfect=20

contact secured.  According to the amount of resistance offered do the effe=
cts of severe shocks of=20

electricity differ. This is shown especially well in the action of lightnin=
g, but is also true of powerful=20

currents produced mechanically. If the resistance of the skin be slight at =
the moment of entering=20

the circuit of a strong current, the current will pass through it with comp=
arative ease and without=20

causing much injury; but if on the other hand the resistance is great, the =
current will be, as it were,=20

momentarily retarded or stored, heat will be developed, and there will ensu=
e a burning and=20

charring of the tissue of a special kind. These burns occur principally at =
the places where the=20

current is specially resisted, that is, at the point of entrance of the cur=
rent to the body and at its=20

point of exit. This is the cause of the frequent burns in the heel or sole =
of the foot in the case of=20

those struck by lightning while standing, as the electricity passes away fr=
om the body into the=20

ground and finds a strong resistance at the point of leaving the body. This=
 is also the cause of the=20

burns where the current leaves the body from any other cause, as from the c=
ontact or proximity of=20

a metallic object. The greater the resistance so long as the current passes=
, other things being=20

equal, the more severe is the burn. It is for this reason that in medical e=
lectricity we usually use=20

wet sponges on the skin or electrodes moistened with salt and water or with=
 other fluids which will=20

assist in rendering the passage of the electricity through the skin more ea=
sy. Solutions of chlorid of=20

sodium and of certain other salts do this.  =3DThe mechanical effects=3D of=
 currents vary thus=20

according to the resistance encountered. They also vary according to the in=
tensity or=20

concentration of the current. If a current of moderate force be applied thr=
ough a small metallic=20

point, it will burn, pain, and produce active irritative symptoms, while if=
 the same amount be=20

applied over a large surface simultaneously, it may have little or no irrit=
ating effect. We have,=20

therefore, three factors in determining the mechanical effect of any electr=
ic current on the body: (1)=20

the condition of the body, that is, the amount of resistance which the curr=
ent will encounter at its=20

entrance and exit; (2) the amount and intensity of the current; and (3) the=
 character of the current.=20

For practical purposes of the more severe currents we have only to deal wit=
h the continuous and=20

alternating.   SYMPTOMS.   DIRECT SYMPTOMS.  The direct symptoms produced b=
y powerful=20

mechanical currents of electricity may be divided into three classes: I. Th=
e mechanical; II. The=20

essential or internal; III. The mental or psychical.  These classes are fai=
rly distinct, but they are not=20

absolute, and certain symptoms are on the borders.  The most important mech=
anical symptoms=20

produced by these currents are =3Dburns=3D. These occur at all points of st=
rong resistance externally,=20

hence especially at the points of entrance and departure of the current. Th=
ey vary from all grades,=20

from the lightest possible, where only the fine hairs on the skin are singe=
d, to those of=20

extraordinary depth and severity. The characteristic burn from powerful cur=
rents is,=20

back and forth, Kentucky and Red were, so I butted in. I fixed up a sort of=
 code and told them=20

where to find us."  "But I still don't see where Ted comes in."  "Kentucky =
located Ted and took him=20

in his plane. He left his mike open, so when Ted was in the plane I heard h=
im say, 'Now that I'm=20

rescued I'm going to find Jack and Stew.'  "Kentucky said, 'That may requir=
e a lot of looking,' but=20

Ted will find us, never fear." Stew drew in a long deep breath of relief.  =
"Boy!" he sighed. "It will be=20

great to get off this island and onto the deck of the old _Black Bee_!"  "G=
ood old Ted! He's a real=20

pal," Jack murmured. "But whether he finds us or not, I've picked my manner=
 of leaving this=20

island."  "How's that?" Stew sat up.  "I'm going in that jet plane," Jack d=
eclared stoutly.  "Sure. As=20

a prisoner of the Germans and Japs." Stew laughed.  "On my own," Jack insis=
ted.  "Sure! On your=20

own." Stew did not laugh this time. "Two Nazis and three Japs with machine =
guns! On your own!=20

In the jet plane! No sir! Me? I'm going to wear out my eyes looking for Ted=
."=20

CHAPTER XX                       A SHIP FROM SOME OTHER WORLD   Realizing t=

 several days, and=20

causes a wound which, though not very painful, heals very slowly. The sever=
ity of electric burns is=20

often at first sight underrated, and their duration, when severe, is unexpe=
ctedly long. It=20

occasionally happens that after a burn of this character appears nearly hea=
led, the surrounding=20

and, in appearance, healthy tissue breaks down, perhaps under a healthy ski=
n, and a destructive=20

process occurs which much retards recovery. This is evidently due to tissue=
 destruction from a=20

strong electric current of such a character as to produce necrobiosis witho=
ut the external=20

appearances of a burn. These burns are, perhaps, oftenest seen on the hands=
, but this is only=20

because these parts are more likely to come into contact with the current. =
They may occur in any=20

portion of the body.  =3DEyes.=3D=E2=80=94The injurious effect of electric =

Before him on the wall were maps and blown-up air photographs.  "I need not=

him, "what our next great objective is to be."  There came a mingled murmur=
 of words,=20

The symptoms are those usual in acute conjunctivitis=E2=80=94photophobia, l=
achrymation, sensation of a=20
