philodendron monstera being knocked down into the mud just as our wives and daughters are if they happen to be in the way when your coach is passing. Isn't that it, mes amis?"

it seemed to Yvonne de Kernogan that out of the darkness faces distorted with fury were peering 

at her through the window-panes. But through all the confusion, the coach kept moving on. Jean-

Marie stuck to his post, as did also the postilion and the four outriders, and with whip and tongue 

they urged their horses to break through the crowd regardless of human lives, knocking and 

trampling down men and lads heedless of curses and blasphemies which were hurled on them 

and on the occupants of the coach, whoever they might be.  The next moment, however, the 

coach came to a sudden halt, and a wild cry of triumph drowned the groans of the injured and the 

dying.  "Kernogan! Kernogan!" was shouted from every side.  "Adet! Adet!"  "You limbs of Satan," 

cried Jean-Marie, "you'll rue this night's work and weep tears of blood for the rest of your lives. Let 

me tell you that! Mademoiselle is in the coach. When M. le duc hears of this, there will be work for 

the hangman...."  "Mademoiselle in the coach," broke in a hoarse voice with a rough tone of 

command. "Let's look at her...."  "Aye! Aye! let's have a look at Mademoiselle," came with a volley 

of objurgations and curses from the crowd.  "You devils--you would dare?" protested Jean-Marie. 

Within the coach Yvonne de Kernogan hardly dared to breathe. She sat bolt upright, her cape held 

tightly round her shoulders: her eyes dilated now with excitement, if not with fear, were fixed upon 

the darkness beyond the window-panes. She could see nothing, but she _felt_ the presence of 

that hostile crowd who had succeeded in over-powering Jean-Marie and were intent on doing her 

harm.  But she belonged to a caste which never reckoned cowardice amongst its many faults. 

During these few moments when she knew that her life hung on the merest thread of chance, she 

neither screamed nor fainted but sat rigidly still, her heart beating in unison with the agonising 

seconds which went so fatefully by. And even now, when the carriage door was torn violently open 

and even through the darkness she discerned vaguely the forms of these avowed  Francois 

wanted many things--things almost too numerous to mention; but, first, he would pay his debts to 

Cloudbrow.  "Come, that's something new," said McKay with a cynical laugh.  "You must have 

come by a fortune, or committed a robbery before ye would be so honest.  How much are you 

goin' to pay?"  "The sledge that you lent me, I have brought back," said the half-breed with a 

deprecatory air.  "So, you call returning a loan paying your debts?" said Duncan.  La Certe did not 

quite say that, but he thought it bore some resemblance to a payment to account, and at all events 

was proof of his good intentions.  "And on the strength of that you'll want plenty more credit, I hev 

no doubt."  "No--not plenty," said La Certe, with the earnest air of a man who is exposing his 

whole soul to inspection, and who means to act this time with the strictest sincerity, to say nothing 

of honesty.  "It is only a little that I want.  Not much.  Just enough to keep body and soul from 

sayin' good-bye."  "But you have not paid a fraction of your old debt.  How will you be expectin' to 

meet the new one?"  Oh!  La Certe could easily explain that.  He was going off immediately to hunt 

and trap, and would soon return with a heavy load, for there were plenty of animals about.  Then in 

the spring, which was near at hand, he meant to fish, or go to the plains with the hunters, and 

return laden with bags of pemmican, bales of dried meat, and buffalo-robes enough to pay off all 

his debts, and leave something over to enable him to spend the winter in luxurious idleness.  "And 

you expect me to believe all that nonsense?" said McKay, sternly.  La Certe was hurt.  Of course 

he expected to be believed!  His feelings were injured, but he was of a forgiving disposition and 

would say no more about it.  He had expected better treatment, however, from one who had 

known him so long.  "A trip to the plains requires more than powder and shot," said the store-



keeper; "where will you be goin' to get a horse an' cart? for you can hev mine no longer." 

"Dechamp, he promise to sole me a horse, an' Mrs

rough hand seize her wrist, she did not move, but said quite calmly, with hardly a tremor in her 

voice:  "Who are you? and what do you want?"  An outburst of harsh and ironical laughter came in 

response.  "Who are we, my fine lady?" said the foremost man in the crowd, he who had seized 

her wrist and was half in and half out of the coach at this moment, "we are the men who 

throughout our lives have toiled and starved whilst you and such as you travel in fine coaches and 

eat your fill. What we want? Why, just the spectacle of such a fine lady as you cart," returned the 

half-breed, with lofty independence.  "Hm! an' you will be returnin' the cart an' payin' for the horse 

when the hunt is over, I suppose?"  Yes, that was exactly the idea that was in La Certe's brain, 

and which, he hoped and fully expected, to reduce to practice in course of time--if Duncan McKay 

would only assist him by making him a few advances at that present time.  "Well, what do you 

want?" asked McKay, getting off the bath.  The half-breed wanted a good many things.  As he was 

going off in the course of a few days, and
