his armies--license for which he made himself responsible, which indeed he =
forced upon them, by=20

neglecting to provide them with the necessaries of life. This cruel neglect=
 recoiled upon his own=20

head: even before the severities of a northern winter set in[41] the hosts =
of Napoleon were=20

_perishing with hunger_. =E2=80=9CIf he expected us to fight for him, he ou=

mournful accusation that fell from the dying lips of many a gallant soldier=
, who, faithful to the end,=20

would allow himself to utter no other reproach. What famine and pestilence-=
-the result of=20

insufficient and unwholesome food--had begun, was completed by the arrows o=
f the winter in the=20

hand of God himself. As, on the occasion of another memorable national deli=

with his wind,=E2=80=9D and the foes of his people were scattered; so now h=

hy snowy breezes     Pour=20

on yonder tented shores,   Where the Rhine=E2=80=99s broad billow freezes, =

roars.   Oh, winds of winter, list ye there     To many a deep and dying gr=

of the midnight air,     At shrieks and thunders louder than your own!   Al=
as! even your unhallowed=20

 death,     No bounds to=20

human woe.=E2=80=9D   Rougeard and his companions succeeded in reaching Smo=
lensko, but only to find it=20

a scene of intolerable wretchedness and unutterable confusion. The Emperor =
and the Old Guard=20

had left some days previously, and for the disorganized troops pouring ever=
y hour into the=20

miserable, ruined city, there was neither food nor shelter, neither order n=
or discipline. So our little=20



coterie still kept together, and hoping against hope determined to continue=
 their march towards the=20

frontier.  Ten or twelve weary days of marching followed. Always hungry, al=
ways cold, always=20

tired, Henri would have given up the struggle once and again, but for the t=
hought which kept for=20

ever    =E2=80=9CBeating in upon his weary brain,   As though it were the b=
urden of a song=E2=80=9D--  =E2=80=9CI must see=20

my mother and my sister again; I cannot die without my mother=E2=80=99s for=
giveness.=E2=80=9D  Usually their only=20

food was a little horse-flesh, but even that failed them frequently; nor co=
uld fuel be always found=20

for the fire of their bivouac. From the bodies of their comrades that strew=
ed the way they=20

sometimes obtained articles of clothing--a sad resource, but all, even the =
gentle Henri, were now=20

becoming inured to sights of horror. Sometimes they would meet with other c=
oteries whose=20

condition was as pitiable as their own, or they would be alarmed by a few s=
tray shots from the=20

=E2=80=9Cclouds of Cossacks=E2=80=9D that hovered about them. Rougeard info=
rmed them that the enemy was=20

_beside_, not _behind_ them; the Russians having very prudently chosen thei=
r lines of march=20

parallel to that of the retreating French armies, which were thus kept from=
 straying to the right or to=20

the left, and sternly restricted to the track their own cruelty had already=
 rendered a desert.  At last=20

a serious misfortune happened to the little band. A long day=E2=80=99s marc=
h, absolutely without food and=20

in piercing cold, had exhausted them all. Rougeard, who was by far the stro=
ngest of the party, said=20

to his companions, =E2=80=9CRest in the shelter of this wall, while I go a =
little further towards the lights I see=20

yonder. I daresay some of our people are there; perhaps they will respect m=
y uniform, and spare=20

us a little food.=E2=80=9D He moved away, but turned back for a moment to a=
dd, =E2=80=9CKeep up your hearts, my=20

lads. If your strength is good for one day=E2=80=99s marching more, I think=
 you may see the Beresina=20

before to-morrow night.=E2=80=9D  That was the last time they looked upon t=
he face or heard the voice of=20

Pierre Rougeard. Whether he was buried in the snow, was murdered or made pr=
isoner by the=20

Russians, they could not tell. His loss dissolved the coterie which his inf=
luence had held together.=20

Its members went their several ways, and far too sad a task would it be for=
 us to follow them. Each=20

in his own measure fulfilled the awful doom that had fallen upon the host t=
o which he belonged.=20

For the word had gone forth: =E2=80=9CThus saith the Lord, Such as are for =
death, to death; such as are for=20

the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and=
 such as are for the=20

captivity, to the captivity.=E2=80=9D  We may, however, follow for a little=
 way the fortunes of Rougeard. The=20

bivouac fires he saw at a distance proved to be those of a Russian regiment=
 of volunteers. He fell=20

into the hands of the sentries, and in spite of a resistance as desperate a=
s his exhausted condition=20

permitted him to make, was secured, and brought at once to the colonel, a R=
ussian nobleman=20

named Demidoff. To his questions Rougeard replied with proud fearlessness; =
but he owned, upon=20

being asked, that he was famishing with hunger. Demidoff, who perhaps had b=
een reading the=20

Book his sovereign loved so well, led the prisoner to his own tent, where a=
n elegant and abundant=20

dinner had just been served. =E2=80=9CSit down, my friend,=E2=80=9D he said=
 to him, =E2=80=9Ceat and drink; you are=20

welcome.=E2=80=9D  But the veteran did not obey. His brave, proud heart, wh=
ich no peril of field or flood or=20

wilderness had ever daunted, was melted, was crushed by the unexpected kind=
ness. A great=20

shudder passed over his frame. Trembling =E2=80=9Cas certainly he never wou=
ld have trembled before the=20

enemy,=E2=80=9D he said with uncontrollable emotion, =E2=80=9CCan it be tha=
t a Russian, an officer, bids me sit=20

down to eat and drink with him, after all the horrors we have committed in =
his country, and against=20

his Emperor?=E2=80=9D[42]  But it could not be expected that all Russians w=
ould take their revenge after the=20

manner of Demidoff. Many of the mujiks, who had been insulted and plundered=
, or had seen their=20



relatives murdered by the French, put the prisoners that fell into their ha=
nds to a cruel death.=20

Fortunately, reports of these outrages soon reached St. Petersburg, and a u=
kase was despatched=20

immediately by the hand of a special courier, forbidding all such practices=
 on pain of the Czar=E2=80=99s=20

highest displeasure; and, as the most effectual mode of preventing them, of=
fering the reward of a=20

ducat of gold for every prisoner brought safely to head-quarters.  Henri de=
 Talmont bore in mind=20

Rougeard=E2=80=99s parting words, and determined at all hazards to try to r=
each the Beresina. He was=20

strengthened in his belief that he was drawing near some point of general r=
endezvous by the=20

constantly increasing crowds. At length, instead of a vast and solitary pla=
in, he found himself=20

traversing a broad high-road, frozen hard, and thronged with a disorderly r=
abble of soldiers and=20

camp-followers, amongst whom vehicles of all kinds were moving with difficu=
lty. Some of these=20

were baggage-waggons, but the great majority contained women and children c=
onnected in=20

various ways with the French army, and endeavouring with it to make their e=
scape from a hostile=20

country. Most pitiable was the fate of those unhappy fugitives.  As Henri s=
tumbled wearily along,=20

the velvet cap of a little child dropped from one of the carriages and fell=
 at his feet. He picked it up=20

and restored it to its owner, a pretty fair-haired boy about four years old=
.  =E2=80=9CThank you, poor=20

soldier,=E2=80=9D lisped the child in soft Italian, a language of which Hen=
ri had learned a little from his=20

mother.  =E2=80=9CI think, Guido, we could make room for the poor soldier h=
ere,=E2=80=9D said the child=E2=80=99s mother, a=20

gentle-looking lady with an infant in her arms; =E2=80=9Che seems very tire=
d.=E2=80=9D  Most thankfully did Henri=20

accept the proffered help. He soon ascertained that the lady was an Italian=
 singer who had come=20

to Russia, with the band of professional artists to which she belonged, in =
the train of the fantastic=20

and pomp-loving King of Naples. These poor children of pleasure, dragged un=
awares into the=20

midst of a horrible tragedy, seemed like butterflies caught in a thundersto=
rm. Madame Leone told=20

Henri, with many tears, that her husband had been made prisoner by the Coss=
acks, and that she=20

knew not whether he was alive or dead. Henri tried to console her, helped h=
er to take care of the=20

children, and defended her as well as he could from the rude assaults of th=
e famishing soldiers=20

who surrounded the carriage, begging for food, or rather demanding it.  At =
last they reached the=20

bank of the Beresina, but it was to find themselves in the midst of untold =
confusion and unutterable=20

horror. The frozen marsh beside the river was thronged with an innumerable =
crowd, increasing in=20

density as it neared the heads of the two bridges which had been thrown acr=
oss the current.=20

Hundreds of vehicles were there, vainly attempting to force a passage throu=
gh the living mass.=20

Oaths and shrieks, cries, groans, and entreaties resounded upon every side.=

this bewildering, maddening confusion, Henri found himself thinking dreamil=

stories of the terrible passage of the Loire by the defeated Vend=C3=A9ans.=
 =E2=80=9CIt was like the day of=20

judgment,=E2=80=9D she used to say. =E2=80=9CAnd what,=E2=80=9D asked Henri=
, =E2=80=9Cwould she have thought of _this_?=E2=80=9D  He was=20

startled by a voice near him. =E2=80=9CMonsieur Henri, is it you? Is it rea=
lly you?=E2=80=9D cried some one in the=20

crowd, seizing his hand and grasping it. =E2=80=9CThis is indeed a miracle.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CF=C3=A9ron! dear F=C3=A9ron!=E2=80=9D exclaimed=20

Henri, springing from his seat in the carriage and throwing himself into th=
e arms of his comrade.=20

Questions and explanations followed, and each told the other his adventures=
 since they parted.=20

=E2=80=9CWhere is our regiment?=E2=80=9D asked Henri.  =E2=80=9CIt has ceas=
ed to exist,=E2=80=9D returned F=C3=A9ron. =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Sauve qui peut=
=E2=80=99=20

is our only marching order now.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh, friend,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Henri, =E2=80=9CI see you have suffered. Your hand--=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CFrost-bitten one bitter night. I could not help thinking when I lo=
st it of that poor Russian whom we=20

branded in the hand before we came to Moscow. Do you remember him, Monsieur=
 Henri?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

ought to remember him. I saw him again in the city, and he did me a good tu=
rn.--Now, F=C3=A9ron, I=20

want you, if you can, to help me to protect this lady and these two helples=
s little children.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_If_ I=20

can. But we must be patient. Those who are rushing madly forward to try and=
 reach the bridge=20

only increase their own danger. Already they are trampling one another down=
 by dozens.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy,=E2=80=9D=20

said Henri, =E2=80=9Cbecause they are afraid the bridges will be burned or =
broken as soon as the effective=20

troops have passed over them, to protect the retreat of the Emperor.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CFools! Do they think the=20

Emperor will let the bridges be touched so long as one Frenchman or Frenchw=
oman remains upon=20

this side? They do not know him,=E2=80=9D returned F=C3=A9ron.  =E2=80=9CPe=
rhaps not,=E2=80=9D said Henri sadly. =E2=80=9CAh, what is=20

this?=E2=80=9D he cried the next moment, as a bullet whizzed close by them =
through the air.  =E2=80=9CI believe our=20

rear-guard and the Russians are fighting it out, and we are near enough to =
come in for a stray shot=20

or two.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen help me to turn this carriage over, that we=
 may make a shelter for the lady.=E2=80=9D  This=20

was accomplished, not without some difficulty. Anxious hours of suspense an=
d forced inactivity=20

followed. Night fell, but an awful light still illumined the landscape. Wha=
t looked like a semicircle of=20

flame environed half the sky. It was the fiery breath of the Russian cannon=
.  Suddenly there came=20

a sound of fearful shrieks, and a frantic swaying and tossing of the crowd.=
 One of the bridges--that=20

constructed for the artillery--had broken down, precipitating its living fr=
eight into the freezing waters=20

beneath; and the miserable multitude on the bank, who were suffering more a=
nd more from the=20

cannonade of the enemy, now rushed forward in blind terror to gain the only=
 remaining bridge.=20

Henri lost sight of Madame Leone and the baby in the press, and it was with=
 difficulty that he=20

saved little Guido from being trodden under foot, by holding him continuall=
y in his arms.  F=C3=A9ron=20

kept by his side throughout. At last, however, he cried aloud suddenly, =E2=
=80=9CComrade, I am done for!=20

That bullet--=E2=80=9D  Henri saw it was too true. In great distress he kne=
lt down beside him and tried to=20

stanch the blood that was flowing from his breast.  Almost at the same mome=
nt a company of the=20

rear-guard came thundering by, forcing their way through the living mass, a=
nd cutting down=20

without remorse or pity all who obstructed their retreat.  =E2=80=9CTime to=
 go _now_,=E2=80=9D said F=C3=A9ron with an=20

effort. =E2=80=9CMonsieur Henri, don=E2=80=99t stay for me. I thought _I_ w=
ould have brought home news of you;=20

now _you_--but go, I entreat of you, go at once. No time to lose.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CNever, while _you_ breathe.=20

Besides, as you said, the Emperor will not leave a Frenchman behind him.=E2=
=80=9D Recollecting that=20



Madame Leone had filled with wine the flask F=C3=A9ron himself had left wit=
h him, he mixed some of its=20

contents with snow-water, and put the reviving draught to the lips of his c=
omrade.  =E2=80=9CMonsieur=20

Henri,=E2=80=9D murmured F=C3=A9ron, =E2=80=9Ccan you say a prayer for me? =
You used to pray, though we laughed at=20

you for it in the regiment.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is one prayer I have o=

  =E2=80=9CGod be merciful to me a sinner, for Jesus=20

Christ=E2=80=99s sake,=E2=80=9D F=C3=A9ron repeated earnestly; and during t=
he hour that followed--an hour that seemed=20

like a year to Henri--the cry was often on his lips.  But he grew weaker an=
d weaker, until at last he=20



fell into a kind of stupor, while Henri watched silently beside him.  Just =
about the dawning of the=20

day, a cry, great and terrible, thrilled every heart, and reached even the =
dulled ear of the dying=20

man. He roused himself, and murmured faintly, =E2=80=9CWhat is it, Monsieur=
 Henri?=E2=80=9D  Henri knew too well.=20

All around him were repeating, in tones that expressed every variation of a=
nguish and despair--

=E2=80=9CThe bridge is on fire! the bridge is burning!=E2=80=9D So, after a=
ll, Napoleon had _not_ waited until every=20

Frenchman was safe on the other side!  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98The hireling fleet=
h, because he is an hireling, and careth=20

not for the sheep,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D thought Henri bitterly. =E2=80=9CBut _=
thou_ shalt never know, F=C3=A9ron. This pang at least=20

shall be spared thy dying hour.=E2=80=9D  He bent once more over his friend=
, who was feebly repeating the=20

question--=E2=80=9CMonsieur Henri, what is it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNothing t=
hat concerns you or me,=E2=80=9D Henri answered firmly.=20

=E2=80=9CDo you suffer, comrade?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo--no pain. Only I am =
sinking--sinking. I want to say that prayer=20

again. God be merciful--for Christ=E2=80=99s sake.=E2=80=9D  With these wor=
ds on his lips, F=C3=A9ron passed away.=20

Henri had scarcely time to close his eyes before he was forced by the stron=
g current of the crowd=20

from the spot where he had been standing. He kept fast hold of Guido: just =
now he cared but little=20

what became of himself; his only thought was to save the child. He was at l=
ast pushed into a=20

position from which he could see the river; but he turned shuddering from t=
he sight, which indeed=20

was horrible beyond description. Men, women, and children were struggling i=
n the icy waters, or=20

sinking for the last time beneath them. Here and there a strong swimmer gai=
ned the opposite bank=20

in safety; but the weak, the famished, the wounded perished by hundreds. Pi=
eces of the broken=20

bridge, to which drowning wretches were clinging, floated about amidst _d=
=C3=A9bris_ of every=20

conceivable kind; and those on board the few sorely overcrowded boats were =
violently thrusting=20

away their despairing comrades who tried to enter.  One of these boats was =
just putting off from=20

the bank when Henri called aloud, =E2=80=9CTake this child with you, for Go=
d=E2=80=99s sake!=E2=80=9D  A tall man stood=20

upright in the boat. =E2=80=9CHold him up, man,=E2=80=9D he cried; =E2=80=
=9Cgive us a sight of him.=E2=80=9D  Henri did so.  =E2=80=9CThe very=20

child we are seeking--eh, comrades?=E2=80=9D said the man, turning to his c=
ompanions. =E2=80=9CAbout three or=20

four years old, fair-haired, with a crimson velvet cap. Well worth our whil=
e--a thousand ducats=20

reward.=E2=80=9D Then to Henri: =E2=80=9CThrow him in, my lad.=E2=80=9D  Th=
is was much more easily said than done. Little=20

Guido clung to his protector with all his might, absolutely refusing to be =
separated from him. Henri=20

found it impossible to unclasp those soft arms from about his neck, though =
he tried hard to do it.=20

Meanwhile the men in the boat were disputing with one another. Some were wi=
lling to take Henri=20

as well as the child; others objected, afraid of losing the reward or of ha=
ving to share it with him.=20

But the tall man who had spoken first decided the question. =E2=80=9CLet th=
e lad come with us,=E2=80=9D he said.=20

=E2=80=9CAnything to save time.=E2=80=9D  So Henri stepped into the boat wi=
th his little companion still in his arms. It=20

did not occur to him until afterwards that Madame Leone would have been by =
no means able to=20

offer a reward so large as a thousand ducats for the recovery of her child.=
 Happily during the=20

crossing Guido engrossed all his attention.=20

finger ache   For such as these?                     But I would _die_, sai=
d he.=E2=80=9D   The miserable fugitives=20

who succeeded, at the cost of so much suffering, in crossing the icy waters=
 of the Beresina, found=20

no =E2=80=9Cpromised land=E2=80=9D on the other side. Better had it been if=
 with one accord they had laid down their=20

arms on the banks of that fatal river, and surrendered to the mercy of the =
enemy. The horrors that=20

awaited them well-nigh cast into oblivion those they had already passed thr=
ough, and filled to=20

absolute overflowing the cup of trembling put into their hands. Until then =
the cold had not=20

exceeded that of the ordinary winter of those regions; but during that terr=
ible month of December it=20

grew ever more and more intense, until it reached a pitch of severity almos=
t beyond precedent. A=20

silent, invisible, invincible enemy, it mowed down the ranks of strong men =
with a pitiless scythe,=20

sparing neither the young recruit nor the hardened veteran who had passed u=
nscathed through all=20

the sufferings of the preceding campaign.  Henri de Talmont was at first on=
ly conscious of one=20

definite purpose, that of keeping his little charge from perishing with col=
d. If he could but bring him=20

alive to Vilna, perhaps he might find Madame Leone there and restore him to=
 her. Seeing that a=20

crowd had gathered about a carriage which had been overturned, and which th=
ey were plundering=20

of its contents, he joined it in the hope of obtaining some provisions for =
the way. With more=20

consideration for Guido=E2=80=99s tastes than for his own, he seized eagerl=
y upon a small bag of sugar and=20



a box of chocolate bonbons. He afterwards made use of the chocolate as a br=
ibe to induce the=20

little one to run along by his side, for he was scarcely strong enough to c=
arry him. But the poor=20

little fellow was unable to endure the piercing cold, and cried piteously t=
o be taken up again in his=20

arms. Weak though he was himself, Henri could not resist the appeal; but it=
 hastened the=20

inevitable moment when, utterly overcome with fatigue, he was fain to lie d=
own and rest, even at=20

the risk of rising again no more.  So many broken and abandoned properties =
of all kinds strewed=20

the way that it was not difficult to contrive a sort of shelter for the nig=
ht. A disabled gun-carriage=20

and a couple of cloaks served Henri as a tent for himself and Guido, whom h=
e folded to his breast=20

as warmly as he could, and both were soon fast asleep.  The intense, biting=
 chill that preceded the=20

dawn awakened Henri. =E2=80=9CMy poor little Guido is very cold,=E2=80=9D h=
e thought; =E2=80=9CI must wrap him up better;=E2=80=9D=20

and he took the coverings from himself to fold them more closely about his =
charge. The child did=20

not waken, nor even stir; nor did any increase of external warmth remove th=
e icy chill from those=20

little limbs. Henri grew alarmed, and thought at last that he ought to awak=
en him and give him=20

some nourishment. But all his efforts were in vain. That wintry night Chris=
t had called a little child=20

to come to him from the frozen plain. Gentle was the call and silent the re=
sponse,--the young spirit=20

passed away in sleep, without struggle and without suffering.  Black despai=
r fell upon Henri then.=20

There seemed no use in making any further struggle for life. All around him=
 were dead or dying; all=20

whom he had known during the long agony of the retreat from Moscow had yiel=
ded to their doom.=20

F=C3=A9ron was dead--Rougeard was dead, as he believed--the dying face of m=
any another comrade=20

rose before him--and now, this child. How was he better than they?  Before =
he lay down to sleep=20

he had prayed for himself and for Guido. The little one also had clasped hi=
s baby hands and lisped=20

in his soft Italian a prayer that they might find his mother on the morrow.=
 But beside that still, fair=20

form--almost as white as the snow around it, and consecrated with the twofo=
ld beauty of childhood=20

and of death--Henri breathed no prayer. Not then, nor for many days afterwa=
rds. It was no use, he=20

said in his heart.  Still he wandered on--in cold, in hunger, in weariness.=
 Hope was gone, memory=20

had almost left him; nothing remained but that desperate clinging to life, =
which is scarcely more=20

than the instinct of an animal. The path he had to follow was strewn with t=
he dead bodies of his=20

comrades; and upon these he sometimes found a little bread, or a small quan=
tity of wine or spirits.=20

On more than one occasion he warmed his freezing limbs by crouching beneath=
 the corpse of a=20

fellow-sufferer in whom the vital spark was only just extinct. He could not=
 have survived at all but=20

for the sugar and the chocolate that he had obtained for Guido. These, thou=
gh he knew it not,=20

afforded precisely the kind of nutriment best adapted to sustain life under=
 intense cold.[43]  He=20

was seldom conscious of any sensations but those of the body. He was always=
 cold, always=20

hungry, always in pain; only sometimes this never-ceasing, never-ending sen=
se of=20
