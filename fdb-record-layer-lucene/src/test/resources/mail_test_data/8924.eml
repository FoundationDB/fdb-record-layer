instant the smoke in the high grass obscured the effect, but almost immediately after, I heard a 

tremendous rush, and, instead of falling, as I had expected, I saw the elephant crash headlong 

through the thorny jungle. No one was behind me, as Florian had misunderstood the arrangement 

that he was to endeavour to obtain a quick shot should I fail. I began to believe in what I had 

frequently heard asserted, that the forehead shot so fatal to the Indian elephant had no effect 

upon the African species, except by mere chance. I had taken so steady an aim at the convexity at 

the root of the trunk, that every advantage had been given to the bullet; but the rifle that The 

child's eyes were open now; they were a lovely blue, and gazed wonderingly into the priest's face. 

"It is really a blessing," he murmured, "that the child did not get wet through; she might have

bends: our course was due east. After the first three hours' ride through a beautiful country 

bordering the Settite valley, which we several times descended, we came turn to stone that minute 

if it were not true, and she was sure the Virgin Mary had sent it down from Heaven herself to the 

poor orphan child.  Widow Adamecz was a regular old gossip; she was fond of a drop of brandy 

now and then, so it was no wonder she sometimes saw more than she ought to have done. The 

summer before, on the eve of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, she had seen the skies open, and 

Heaven was before her; she had heard the angels sing, as they passed in procession before God, 

sitting on a throne of precious stones. And
