 that Antoine Dechamp, the leader of the expedition, was unusually silent a=

"What? What?" stammered the other vaguely. "I don't understand. What do you=
 mean?" he added,=20

bewildered at the duc's violence, tired after his night's adventure and the=
 long ride in the early=20

morning, irritable with want of sleep and decent food. He stared, uncompreh=
ending, at the duc,=20

who had once more started pacing up and down the room, like a caged beast, =
with hands tightly=20

clenched behind his back, his eyes glowering both at the new-comer and at t=
he imaginary=20

presence of his most bitter enemy--the man who had dared to come between hi=
m and his projects=20

for his daughter.  Martin-Roget passed his hand across his brow like a man =
who is not yet fully=20

awake.  "What do you mean?" he reiterated hazily.  "Just what I like the se=
aman, was out on his=20

first buffalo-hunt.  "I never heard such a roar as it gave that time you br=
ought down ten out of one=20

flock of ducks on the way up here."  "Ay, Peter, she barked well that time,=
" remarked the sailor,=20

with a grin, "but, then there was a reason.  I had double-shotted her by mi=
stake."  "An' ye did it too=20

without an aim, for you had both eyes tight shut at the time," remarked Fer=
gus.  "Iss that the way=20

they teach ye to shoot at sea?"  "In course it is," replied Jenkins, gravel=
y.  "That's the beauty o' the=20

blunderbuss.  There's no chance o' missin', so what 'ud be the use o' keepi=
n' yer eyes open,=20

excep' to get 'em filled wi' smoke.  You've on'y got to point straight, an'=
 blaze away."  "I did=20


_
that nincompoop Lord Anthony Dewhurst. They have gone through some sort of =
marriage=20

ceremony together. And she writes me a letter this morning to tell me that =
she is quite happy and=20

contented and spending her honeymoon at a place called Combwich Hall. Honey=
moon!" he=20

repeated savagely, as if to lash his fury up anew, "Tsha!"  Martin-Roget on=
 the other hand was not=20

the man to allow himself to fall into a state of frenzy, which would necess=
arily interfere with calm=20

consideration.  He had taken the fact in now. Yvonne's elopement with his E=
nglish rival, the=20

clandestine marriage, everything. But he was not going to allow his inward =
rage to obscure his=20

vision of the future. He did not spend the next precious seconds--as men of=
 his race are wont to=20

do--in smashing things around him, in raving and fuming and gesticulating. =
No. That was not the=20

temper M. Martin-Roget was in at this moment when Fate and a girl's folly w=
ere ranging=20

themselves against his plans. His friend, citizen Chauvelin, would have env=
ied him his calm in the=20

face of this disaster.  Whilst M. le duc still stormed and raved, Martin-Ro=
get sat down quietly in=20

front of the fire, rested his chin in his hand and waited for a lull in the=
 other man's paroxysm ere he=20

spoke.  "From your attitude, M. le duc," he then said quietly, Dechamp, wit=
h a look of assumed=20

simplicity.  "Ho yes, they do," said Jenkins, squinting down the bell-mouth=
ed barrel, as if to see=20

that the touch-hole was clear.  "Aboard o' one man-o'-war that I sailed in =
after pirates in the China=20

seas, we had a blunderbuss company.  The first-leftenant, who was thought t=
o be queer in his=20

head, he got it up.  "The first time the company was ranged along the deck =
he gave the order to=20

load with ball cartridges.  There was twenty-six of us, all told.  "`We've =
got no cartridges for 'em,=20

sir,' whispered the man nearest him.  "`If you don't obey orders,' growled =
the leftenant 'tween his=20

teeth, `I'll have ye strung up for mutiny every man Jack of you--_load_!' h=
e repeated in a kind of a=20

yell.  "We had our or'nary belts and pouches on, so we out wi' the or'nary =
cartridges--some three,=20

some four,--an', biting off the ends, poured in the powder somehow, shoved =
in the balls anyhow,=20

an' rammed the whole consarn down.  "`Present--fire!' roared the leftenant.=
  "Bang! went the six=20

an' twenty blunderbusses, an' when the smoke cleared away there was fourtee=
n out o' the twenty-

six men flat on their backs. The rest o' us was raither stunned, but hearty=
.  "`Take these men=20

below,' cried the leftenant, `an' send fourteen strong men here.  We don't =
want weaklings for=20


_
sarcasm behind a veil of studied deference, "from your attitude I gather th=
at your wishes with=20

regard to Mlle. de Kernogan have undergone no modification. You would still=
 honour me by=20

desiring that she should become my wife?"  "I am not in the habit of changi=
ng my mind," said M. le=20

duc gruffly. He desired the marriage, he coveted Martin-Roget's millions fo=
r the royalist cause, but=20

he had no love for the man. All the pride of the Kernogans, their long line=
 of ancestry, rebelled=20

against the thought of a fair descendant of this glorious race being allied=
 to  "After that we loaded=20

in moderation, an' got on better."  "And the pirates--what did _they_ think=
 o' the new weapon?"=20

asked Peter Davidson, with an amused expression.  "O! they couldn't stand i=
t at all," answered the=20

sailor, looking up from his work, with a solemnity that was quite impressiv=
e.  "They stood fire only=20

once.  After that they sheered off like wild-cats.  I say, Mistress La Cert=
e, how long is that=20

lobscouse--or whatever you call it,--goin' to be in cookin'?"  Slowfoot gav=
e vent to a sweet, low=20

giggle, as she lifted the kettle off the hook,=20
