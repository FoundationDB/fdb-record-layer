over the range on=20

snowshoes to-night if it's clear and I didn't know but what we'd join them.=
"  "That sounds good to=20

me," declared Neil. "Teeny-bits and I have been leading the social life dow=
n in Dellsport and we're=20

all fed up with parties and so on."  "Sounds good to me, too," said Teeny-b=
its, although he had to=20

admit to himself that he wasn't exactly "fed up" with the good time in Dell=
sport.  The Norris place=20

was a cabin built of spruce logs with an immense stone fireplace at one end=
 of a long living room,-

-a comfortable backwoods place where one felt very close to the out-of-door=
s. Here the new=20

arrivals found awaiting them Phillips, another member of the Jefferson elev=
en, and an athletic=20

looking middle-aged man whom Norris introduced as his uncle, Wolcott Norris=
. There was no one=20

else at the cabin except Peter Kearns, the cook and helper.  "It's all fixe=
d up for to-night," said the=20

older Norris; "we're going up the gulf and over the shoulder of Whiteface a=
nd then down to the Cliff=20

House, where a sleigh will meet us and bring us back."  That evening tramp =
over the slopes of=20

Whiteface Mountain was the beginning of a wonderful series of winter sports=
 at Pocassett. The=20

party that made the climb consisted of the six from the Norris place and tw=
ice as many more from=20

other cabins and cottages that nestled in the snow at the foot of the mount=
ains. While the growing=20

moon hung overhead and shed its silver radiance over the white world, the s=
nowshoers climbed=20

the gulf by way of a trail that led among spruces and hemlocks, then up and=
 out to the great, bare=20

shoulder of the mountain. Gaining the ridge, they crossed and went plunging=
, sliding and leaping=20

down in the soft snow that clothed the farther slope. It was a night to mak=
e one's blood run fast,=20

and the whole crowd came back to the settlement at Pocassett in high spirit=
s. The days that=20

followed were filled with similar sports,--skating where the snow had been =
cleared from the surface=20

of the Pocassett River, snowshoeing in all directions over the hills, fishi=
ng through the ice at=20

Lonesome Lake and Wolf Pond and, on one or two nights, get-togethers with t=
he crowd of young=20

people who were occupying other camps near by.  Teeny-bits soon discovered =
that the vigorous,=20

middle-aged man who had been introduced to him that first day as Ted Norris=
' uncle was in reality=20

taking the place of the Jefferson football captain's father, who had died s=
everal years before. It=20

seemed to him that here was the most intensely interesting man he had ever =
met. He was a=20

mining engineer, and from little things that were said now and then it was =
evident that there was=20

scarcely a quarter of the world into which he had not penetrated. A casual =
remark about India=20

aided by a question or two from Phillips and Neil Durant brought forth a st=
ory of a trip into the=20

jungles of that distant country; at another time the sight of a bare mounta=
in-side called forth=20

reference to a snow-covered range in China and led to interesting details o=
f life in the Far East.=20

"Sometime you will have to take us on a trip to Japan or China or India or =
somewhere," said Ted=20

Norris one night when the six of them were at supper.  "Well," said the min=
ing engineer, "I'd like to=20

do it. Who knows, perhaps sometime I can."  Teeny-bits Holbrook would have =
liked nothing better=20

than to "pump" this man who had traveled so much, for he found stories of f=
ar lands intensely=20

interesting, and when the first mishap of the vacation occurred he was some=
what envious of the=20

victim, to whom it opened up an opportunity for closer acquaintance. On Thu=
rsday Neil Durant, in=20

trying out a pair of skis on a steep slope behind the camp, crashed into a =
thicket of young pine=20

trees and, although he came through with a grin on his face, he discovered =
that he had sprained=20

his ankle and would not be able to join the crowd on the ski party that had=
 been planned for=20

Thursday evening. Wolcott Norris announced at supper that he also would sta=
y behind; and thus it=20



happened that the former captain of the Ridgley team sat with his bandaged =
ankle propped up on=20

a chair in front of the fireplace while Wolcott Norris settled back comfort=
ably to enjoy an evening of=20

conversation. They talked about many things--travel, business, college and =
sports--before the=20

subject got around to the Ridgley-Jefferson game.  "You know I was there," =
said the mining=20

engineer, "and I don't think I ever spent a more interesting two hours. You=
 fellows certainly had the=20

game developed to a fine point and though of course I, as an old Jefferson =
boy, was yelling hard=20

for the purple, I couldn't help handing you chaps a bit when you came throu=
gh. And your friend=20

Teeny-bits--now that I know him--measures up to the idea of what he was lik=
e, which I got from=20

watching him play."  "Yes," said Neil, "he comes through--you can always co=
unt on him. Every one=20

down at school fell for him from the start, partly, I suppose, because he w=
as different from most of=20

the fellows and then, of course, because he made good. Certain things about=
 him attracted=20

attention before he'd been in school very long."  "What things?"  "Well," s=
aid Neil, "a lot of things--

one is the knife mark on his back."  "The what?" asked Wolcott Norris.  "Wh=
y a sort of birthmark=20

that looks like a knife."  The mining engineer had been looking into the em=
bers of the fire rather=20

dreamily and talking in a low tone to Neil. He now half turned round and sa=
id in a voice that=20

showed more than casual interest, "Tell me about it. It sounds interesting.=
"  "Well," said Neil, "it's a=20

mark, sort of brick colored, on his shoulder, that looks exactly like a kni=
fe or a dagger. I noticed it=20

one day in the shower-bath room when Teeny-bits first came out for the foot=
ball team."  "Has he=20

always had it?"  "Yes, I guess so. I suppose it's just chance--the shape of=
 it, but it is such an=20

unusual looking thing that the fellows got interested in him and then of co=
urse there was the story=20

about his mother being killed in a railroad wreck. That got around school s=
ome way; Teeny-bits=20

himself told it, I think; so there isn't any harm in my repeating it. Some =
mighty nice people in=20

Hamilton picked him up after a train accident which killed his mother and t=
ook him home. They=20

finally adopted him, and gave him their name when they weren't able to find=
 any of his relatives,=20

and of course the mystery of that made the fellows all the more interested =
in him."  While the=20

former captain of the Ridgley team had been saying these words the mining e=
ngineer had looked=20

at him with an intentness that Neil had attributed to the fact that Teeny-b=
its' story was as=20

interesting to him as it had been to the sons of Ridgley.  "You said that i=
t was his mother who was=20

killed in the railroad accident?"  "Yes," replied Neil, "I guess they never=
 found out what her name=20

was. That seems pretty horrible, but the Holbrooks, who adopted Teeny-bits,=
 are mighty fine=20

people. Daniel Holbrook is the station agent at Hamilton."  The mining engi=
neer settled back in his=20

chair, sighed rather heavily and gazed once more into the embers of the fir=
e. "Well, Teeny-bits is a=20

fine chap," he said finally, "and I don't wonder that the fellows fell for =
him."  "He nearly caused me=20

nervous prostration," said Neil, "when he didn't show up at the game until =
the last minute, and the=20

story about what happened to him and how the Chinese who had kidnaped him a=
cted when they=20

saw the knife mark on his shoulder is one of the strangest things I ever he=
ard."  Wolcott Norris got=20

out of his chair so quickly that Neil looked up in surprise. "What happened=
 about these Chinese?"=20

asked the mining engineer. "When did they come into it and _how_ did they a=
ct?"  "That's another=20

bit of mystery," said Neil. "There were a couple of fellows at school who d=
idn't like Teeny-bits for=20

one reason or another--jealousy, I guess--and according to general belief t=
hey patched up some=20

kind of ridiculous plot to get Teeny-bits away from the school while the bi=
g game was being=20

played. One of them was Teeny-bits' substitute sufficient to scratch glass.=
  One hundred parts=20



reduced to fine powder were mixed with four times the weight of soda, and e=
xposed to heat,=20

gradually increased for three quarters of an hour; at the expiration of whi=
ch time, the whole had=20

acquired a pasty consistence. The crucible was now removed from the fire, i=
ts outer surface=20

carefully wiped. Muriatic acid was poured on till all effervescence ceased.=
 The solution obtained=20

was evaporated to dryness, gradually assuming an orange red colour. Water w=
as now poured=20

upon the mass, after which it was filtered, and the powder remaining carefu=
lly dried; after ignition,=20

and while warm, it weighed 28 parts. This powder was insoluble in muriatic =
acid, and of a white=20

colour.  To the filtered solution, reduced by evaporation, carbonate of pot=
ash was added, the=20

precipitate was collected on a filter, washed and dried; it weighed 23 part=
s. This powder was=20

redissolved in sulphuric acid, sulphate of potash added, and crystals of al=
um finally obtained;=20

hence this powder was alumine. To the liquor from which the silex and alumi=
ne had thus been=20

separated, acetic acid was added; the whole evaporated to dryness; the exce=
ss of acid being=20

removed, a small quantity of water was poured on, and after strong ignition=
, the precipitate=20

weighed 4.5.  Into a very small tubulated retort I introduced a portion fro=
m the same mass, whence=20

the piece submitted to analysis was broken, and obtained over mercury the c=
arbonic acid in the=20

usual manner. This was equal to 2.32; by deducting this from 18.5 the loss =
during exposure to red=20

heat, we shall have 16.18, the proportion of water. The oxide of iron was s=
eparated from the=20

solutions after the addition of acetic acid, by ammonia, and weighed 26 par=

Quantity of Nutritious Matter which may be obtained from an Acre of Land wh=

Potatoes or Wheat, by Dr._ ELI IVES, _Professor of Materia Medica and Botan=
y in Yale College_.=20

In a good season an acre of suitable land well cultivated will produce 400 =
bushels of potatoes. In=20

Woodbridge, a town adjoining New-Haven, a crop of 600 bushels of potatoes h=
as been obtained=20

from a single acre. A bushel of potatoes weighs 56 pounds. Multiply 400, th=
e number of bushels,=20

by 56, the weight of a single bushel, gives 22400, the number of pounds of =
potatoes produced=20

upon one acre.  Thirty bushels of wheat are considered a good crop as the p=
roduct of one acre of=20

land. About  of wheat may be considered as nutritious matter.  According to=
 the experiments of Dr.=20

Pearson and Einhoff, about one-third of the potato is nutritious matter. Fr=
om the analysis of=20

Einhoff, 7680 parts of potatoes afforded 1153 parts of starch--fibrous matt=
er analogous to starch=20

540 parts--albumen 107 parts--mucilage 312 parts. The sum of these products=
 amounts to about=20

one-third of the potatoes subject to the experiment.  Sir Humphry Davy obse=
rves, that one-fourth=20

of the weight of potatoes at least may be considered nutritious matter.  On=
e-fourth of 22400, the=20

product of an acre of ground, cultivated with potatoes, is 5600. The whole =
weight of a crop of=20

wheat calculated at 30 bushels to the acre, and at 60 pounds to the bushel,=
 gives 1800. Deducting=20

one-sixth from the wheat as matter not nutritious, and the weight is reduce=
d to 1500.  The=20

nutritious matter of the crop of potatoes to that of wheat is as 5600 to 15=
00, or as 56 to 15.  The=20

starch might be obtained by a very simple machine, recommended by Parmentie=
r; and in seasons=20

when potatoes are abundant, the potatoes might be converted to starch, and =
the starch preserved=20

for any length of time, and used as a substitute for wheaten flour.  The ma=
chine alluded to is a=20

cylinder of wood about three feet long and six inches in diameter, covered =
with sheet tin, punched=20

outward so as to form a coarse grater, and turned by a crank. This cylinder=
 is placed in a box of=20



boards whose sides slope a little inward upon the principle of a hopper, an=
d a tub of water is=20

placed beneath: The potatoes are thrown into this box, and as the crank is =
turned they are=20

crushed, and the starch or fecula subsides to the bottom of the water. It i=
s well known, that=20

potatoes are largely used in England mixed with flour to form a very good b=
read; the _starch_ of=20

the potato would of course answer much better.     MISCELLANEOUS     ART. X=

_Biographical Notice of the late_ ARCHIBALD BRUCE, M. D. _Professor of Mate=
ria Medica, and=20

Mineralogy in the Medical Institution of the State of New-York, and Queen's=
 College, New-Jersey;=20

and Member of various Learned Societies in America and Europe._ With a Port=
rait.=20

(Communicated.)   Doctor Archibald Bruce, (the subject of this Memoir) was =
a native of the city of=20

New-York, in North America. He was born in the month of February, in the ye=
ar seventeen=20

hundred and seventy-seven. His father was, at that time, at the head of the=
 medical department of=20

the British army, (then stationed at New-York) to which he had been attache=
d from his youth,=20

having been many years previously resident at New-York, as surgeon to the a=
rtillery department;=20

where he was married, in or about the year seventeen hundred and sixty-seve=
n, to Judith, a=20

daughter of Nicholas Bayard, formerly of the same city, at that time the wi=
dow of Jeremiah Van=20

Rensselaer of Greenbush; by whom he had another son, (who died an officer i=
n the British army in=20

Ireland) and a daughter, who died while a child.  William Bruce, (the fathe=
r above-mentioned,) and=20

his brother Archibald, together with a sister, were natives of the town of =
Dumfries in Scotland,=20

where their father was many years resident as the parochial clergyman; and =
so continued until his=20

decease, much respected.  Both sons applied themselves to the science of me=
dicine and surgery.=20

William, as above stated, became a physician in the British army, and died,=
 in that station, of the=20

yellow fever, in the island of Barbadoes. And Archibald received a commissi=
on of surgeon in the=20

British navy, in which he continued until disqualified by old age, when he =
retired from business,=20

and died a few years since in London. For many years he acted as surgeon to=
 the several ships=20

commanded by Sir Peter Parker, captain, and afterward admiral.  Doctor Will=
iam Bruce, before his=20

final separation from his family, on the occasion of his being ordered to t=
he West-India station, had=20

always declared that his son Archibald should never be educated for the med=
ical profession; and=20

finally enjoined such instruction upon his wife and friends, to whom the ch=
arge of the boy was=20

committed. After his decease, the same injunction was repeated by the uncle=
, then in Europe, who=20

was ever averse to his nephew's making choice of this profession: much pain=
s were therefore=20

early exerted to divert him from such inclination.  The momentous state of =
political affairs, induced=20

his mother to send him to Halifax, under the care of William Almon, M. D. a=
 particular friend of her=20

husband, with whom, however, remaining but a short time, he returned to New=
-York; and was=20

placed at a boarding-school at Flatbush, Long Island, under the direction o=
f Peter Wilson, LL.D.=20

who was in high standing as a teacher of the languages.  [Illustration: ARC=
HIBALD BRUCE M. D.]=20

In 1791, he was admitted a student of the arts in Columbia college. Nichola=
s Romayne, M.D. was=20

at this time among the physicians of highest consideration in New-York, and=
 was engaged in=20

delivering lectures on different subjects of medical science in Columbia Co=
llege. Having pursued=20

the early part of his medical studies with Dr. William Bruce, he felt a gen=
erous gratitude for the=20

instruction and attention which he had received from him, and endeavoured t=
o requite them by=20

advising with his son, and promoting his views, as far as lay in his power.=
 Here commenced a=20

friendship which increased with advancing years, and terminated but with li=
fe. At this period,=20


_
you read in the papers about the accident in which a fellow named Bassett w=
as killed and another=20

named Campbell got pretty badly hurt. Those were the two fellows--they wrec=
ked a big machine=20

running away after Teeny-bits showed up at the game. At least every one sup=
posed they were=20

trying to make a get-away. All Teeny-bits knows about the thing is that som=
e one sent him a fake=20

telephone message that his father--that is, old Daniel Holbrook--had been h=
urt, and when Teeny-

bits was on the way home some men pounced on him and carried him over to Gr=
eensboro and=20

shut him up in some sort of Chinese place. They had him all tied up and fix=
ed so that he couldn't=20

get away, they thought; but Teeny-bits squirmed around and tore his sweater=
 half off and finally=20

got almost loose, when back came two of these Chinamen and were tying him u=
p again when they=20

saw this mark on his back and they began to act as if they'd been mesmerize=
d or something. They=20

jabbered away and pointed at the thing, and while they were going through t=
hese tantrums Teeny-

bits just walked out of the place and came home."  "That _is_ strange," sai=
d the mining engineer,=20

"_mighty_ strange. Didn't he find out why they were frightened or what was =
behind it all?"  "No,"=20

said Neil, "I think the matter was sort of hushed up. They did a little inv=
estigating and it didn't seem=20

to get them anywhere, and I guess the people at the school thought it wasn'=
t worth while to follow=20

it up any more. No one doubts that this Campbell fellow and Bassett were be=
hind the business,=20

and as far as the Chinese go I guess they were just superstitious or someth=
ing. You must know=20

them pretty well--you've traveled over there so much. Don't you?"  Apparent=
ly the mining engineer=20

did not hear Neil's question, for he had turned again to the fireplace and =
was gazing into the=20

embers in an abstracted manner. Neil did not feel like interrupting. For se=
veral minutes the room=20

was silent, then Wolcott Norris suddenly turned and asked:  "When was that =
crowd coming back?"=20

The ski party on that night consisted of the three Jefferson football playe=
rs, Teeny-bits and two=20

brothers by the name of Williams who were from a camp a quarter of a mile d=
own the valley. They=20

planned to go up over the shoulder of Whiteface in the brilliant moonlight =
and shoot down a long,=20

bare slope which was known as The Slide, where years before an avalanche ha=
d torn its way=20

downward leaving bare earth in its wake. This V-shaped scar on the face of =
the mountain was now=20

covered with a smooth expanse of snow--an ideal avenue for a swift and thri=
lling descent of the=20

mountain. Teeny-bits had done more skiing in the last few days than he had =
done before in all the=20

years of his life and had become enthusiastic over the sport. The sensation=
 of sweeping down a=20

slope and of speeding on with increasing swiftness until it seemed as if on=
e were actually flying=20

filled him with exhilaration and the real joy of living. He had never tried=
 anything as steep as The=20

Slide, but he had no fear of the place, and when, after a somewhat laboriou=
s climb, they had=20

reached the peak and stood gazing down on the white way that stretched befo=
re them, he was=20

eager to be off for the descent.  "Don't take it too fast," said Norris, "t=
he slope is steeper than it=20

looks. If you should want to slow up you can shoot over to the side and wor=
k against the slope a=20

little."  The moon, now almost at the full, was shedding its ghostly light =
over the snow-covered=20

mountains; by its brilliance the ski runners could see the surface of the s=
lide, unbroken save for an=20

occasional spruce which, having taken root in the scarred soil, was now thr=
usting up its dark=20

branches through the blanket of white. Norris was the first to take off. He=
 shot downward and as=20

he gained momentum sent back a cry that floated up eerily. Teeny-bits poise=
d at the edge and=20

took a deep breath. This was living. Down there, growing smaller and smalle=
r, a moving speck that=20

seemed a mere shadow on the snow, was a new friend of his. It seemed strang=
e that this was one=20



of the outcomes of the Jefferson-Ridgley game: that from so desperate a str=
uggle had arisen this=20

opportunity to know the leader of the purple for whom he held a growing adm=
iration. A fellow who=20

fought so hard and so cleanly, who took defeat so wonderfully and who made =
such a good pal was=20

only a little less to be admired than Neil Durant. Perhaps there was not an=
y real difference in=20

Teeny-bits' feeling for the two.  "I'm off," cried Teeny-bits; "see you at =
the bottom," and giving a=20

strong thrust with his pole sent himself out upon the smooth surface.  With=
 body bent slightly=20

forward he took the first gentle slope and felt the exhilarating sensation =
of gathering speed as his=20

skis carried him away from his friends. It was something between flying thr=
ough the air and riding=20

on the top of an undulating wave of water. Following Ted Norris' example he=
 sent a shout back to=20

the group on the crest and then gave himself completely to the joy of meeti=
ng each surprise of the=20

snow with the inclination of his father and friends by studying medicine; t=
his study, without their=20

knowledge, and while a student of the arts in the senior class, he commence=
d by attending Dr.=20

Romayne's lectures. Such was the strong bent of his mind towards the study =
of medicine, and its=20

collateral physical pursuits, that the persuasion and remonstrances of his =
friends proved alike=20

ineffectual, and he soon gave free scope to the prevailing inclination.  Th=
e collection and=20

examination of minerals, a pursuit not then at all attended to in this coun=
try, was his particular=20

relief from other studies; for even during his recreation, he was ever on t=
he look-out for something=20

new or instructing in mineralogy.  Dr. Romayne being about visiting Europe,=
 young Bruce pursued=20

his studies with Samuel Bard, M.D.; and having attended the usual courses i=
n Columbia College,=20

he left the United States for Europe in 1798, and in 1800 he obtained the d=
egree of doctor in=20

medicine from the University of Edinburgh, after defending a Thesis, De Var=
iola Vaccina.  Having=20

now finished his medical studies, he was prepared to visit the continent of=
 Europe with peculiar=20

advantage; for his continued attachment to mineralogy, a liberal distributi=
on of American=20

specimens then comparatively new in Europe, and his social habits and dispo=
sitions, which were=20

very conciliating, secured him the best introductions from Edinburgh, and l=
aid the foundation of=20

permanent friendships.  During a tour of two years, he visited France, Swit=
zerland, and Italy; and=20

collected a mineralogical cabinet of great value and extent. After his retu=
rn to England, he married=20

in London, and came out to New-York in the autumn of 1803, to enter on the =
active duties of a=20

practitioner of medicine.  Previous to the year 1805, the practice of physi=
c in the state of New-York=20

was regulated by no public authority, and of course was not in the happiest=
 condition to promote=20

the respectability and usefulness of the profession. To remove, as far as p=
ossible, the existing=20

inconveniences, Dr. Bruce became an active agent, and in conjunction with D=
r. Romayne and=20

other medical gentlemen of New-York, succeeded in establishing the state an=
d county medical=20

societies, under the sanction of the state legislature. This act "may be co=
nsidered among the first=20

efforts made in this country to reduce medicine to a regular science, by in=
vesting the privileges of=20

medical men in the body of the members of the profession."  In the organiza=
tion of the College of=20

Physicians and Surgeons of the state of New-York, Dr. Bruce and Dr. Romayne=
 were eminently=20

active, and by their united exertion and perseverance, (opposed by much pro=
fessional talent) they=20

obtained a charter from the regents. In this new institution, as professor =
of the materia medica,=20

and of his favourite pursuit, mineralogy, he exhibited the fruits of arduou=
s study, with a dignity of=20

character, and urbanity of manner, which commanded the respect of the profe=
ssion, and the=20

regard of the students.  The ruling passion in Dr. Bruce's mind, was a love=
 of natural science, and=20



especially of mineralogy. Towards the study of this science, he produced in=
 his own country a=20

strong impulse, and he gave it no small degree of eclat. His cabinet, compo=
sed of very select and=20

well characterized specimens; purchased by himself, or collected in his own=
 pedestrian and other=20

tours in Europe, or, in many instances, presented to him by distinguished m=
ineralogists abroad;=20

and both in its extent, and in relation to the then state of this country, =
very valuable, soon became=20

an object of much attention. That of the late B. D. Perkins, which, at abou=
t the same time, had=20

been formed by Mr. Perkins in Europe, and imported by him into this country=
, was also placed in=20

New-York, and both cabinets (for both were freely shown to the curious, by =
their liberal and=20

courteous proprietors) contributed more than any causes had ever done befor=
e, to excite in the=20

public mind an active interest in the science of mineralogy.[43]  Dr. Bruce=
, while abroad, had been=20

personally and intimately conversant with the Hon. Mr. Greville, of Padding=
ton Green, near=20

London, a descendant of the noble house of Warwick, the possessor of one of=
 the finest private=20

cabinets in Europe, and a zealous cultivator of mineralogy. Count Bournon, =
one of those loyal=20

French exiles, who found a home in England, during the storm of the French =
revolution, was=20

almost domesticated at Mr. Greville's, and was hardly second to any man in =
mineralogical, and=20

particularly in crystallographical knowledge. His connexions with men of sc=
ience on the continent,=20

were of the first order, and to be familiar at Mr. Greville's, and with Cou=
nt Bournon, was to have=20

access to every thing connected with science in England and France. Dr. Bru=
ce was also at home=20

at Sir Joseph Banks's, the common resort of learned and illustrious men. Th=
us he enjoyed every=20

advantage in England, and when he went to the continent, the abundant means=
 of introduction=20

which he possessed, brought him into contact=20


_
make the descent in one unbroken slide. He had never taken so swift a fligh=
t,--it was as if he were=20

rushing through space with scarcely any realization of the landscape round =
him.  Midway in The=20

Slide, Teeny-bits suddenly found himself dodging a thicket of small spruce =
trees. He escaped=20

them by swerving quickly, but he went too far to the left. Other small tree=
s confronted him; his=20

body brushed sharply against the branches, and then looming before him was =
an old monarch of=20

the forest that somehow had escaped when the slide had scarred the mountain=
-side. Its gnarled=20

branches, standing out vaguely in the half-light of the moon and stars like=
 the arms of an octopus,=20

seemed to Teeny-bits to rise up and seize him. He had the feeling that some=
thing was lifting him=20

into the air, that he was going up and up into the silver face of the moon.=
 It seemed also that at the=20

same time there was a flash of light followed immediately by darkness.  One=
 after another the ski=20

runners at the top of The Slide took off and shot swiftly down the slope. N=
one of them saw the=20

huddled form at the foot of the ancient oak and it was only when the four h=
ad joined Ted Norris at=20

the bottom of The Slide that they realized that something must have happene=
d to Teeny-bits.=20

"Didn't any of you see him on the way down?" asked Ted Norris. "Maybe he br=
oke his skis."  "He=20

would have yelled at us, wouldn't he?" said one of the Williams brothers; "=
we'd better go back and=20

look around."  It was not a difficult matter even in the indistinct night l=
ight to follow the marks of the=20

skis. From the foot of the slide they mounted slowly, tracing backward the =
five double tracks and=20

finally coming to the sixth, halfway down from the crest.  [Illustration: F=
ROM THE FOOT OF THE=20

SLIDE THEY MOUNTED SLOWLY, TRACING BACKWARD THE FIVE DOUBLE TRACKS.]=20

"Here they are," said Norris. "Here's where Teeny-bits swerved over toward =
the left."  Almost=20

before the words were out of his mouth he gave a startled exclamation that =
brought the other four=20

quickly to the foot of the oak tree, where, with arms stretched out in fron=
t of him, lay Teeny-bits. He=20

had fallen in such an apparently comfortable position that it seemed to the=
 five ski runners that he=20

could not be badly injured, but when they turned him over they saw the dark=
 mark of blood on the=20

snow and became assailed with a great fear that the worst thing they could =
imagine had=20

happened. Ted Norris' voice trembled a little as he said to the others, "We=
 must get him down to=20

the house as quickly as we can. Here, help me pick him up."  It was a disti=
nguished men of Paris,=20

and of other cities which he visited. The learned and estimable Abb=C3=A9 H=
a=C3=BCy was among his=20

personal friends and correspondents; and many others might be mentioned in =
the same character,=20

whose names are among the first in the ranks of science, in various countri=
es of Europe.=20

Returned to his own country, after being so long familiar with the fine col=
lections in natural history,=20

and especially in mineralogy, in various countries in Europe, Dr. Bruce man=
ifested a strong desire=20

to aid in bringing to light the neglected mineral treasures of the United S=
tates. He soon became a=20

focus of information on these subjects. Specimens were sent to him from man=
y and distant parts=20

of the country, both as donations and for his opinion respecting their natu=
re. In relation to=20

mineralogy he conversed, he corresponded extensively, both with Europe and =
America; he=20

performed mineralogical tours; he kindly sought out and encouraged the youn=
g mineralogists of=20

his own country, and often expressed a wish to see a journal of American mi=
neralogy upon the=20

plan of that of the School of Mines at Paris. This object, it is well known=
, he accomplished, and in=20

1810, published the first number of this work. Owing to extraneous causes, =
it was never carried=20

beyond one volume; but it demonstrated the possibility of sustaining such a=
 work in the United=20

States, and will always be mentioned in the history of American science, as=
 the earliest original=20



purely scientific journal of America.  Dr. Bruce had, in a high degree, the=
 feelings of a man of=20

science. He was ever forward to promote its interests, and both at home and=
 abroad, was=20

considered as one of its most distinguished American friends.  Many strange=
rs of distinction came=20

introduced to him, and his urbanity and hospitality rarely left him without=
 guests at his board.=20

During the latter part of his life, he seems to have been less interested i=
n science. His journal had=20

been so long suspended, that it was considered as virtually relinquished; h=
is health was=20

undermined by repeated attacks of illness, and science and society had to l=
ament his sudden=20

departure, when he had scarcely attained the meridian of life.  He died in =
his native place on the=20

22d of February, 1818, of an apoplexy, in the 41st year of his age.     INT=
ELLIGENCE.     ART.=20

XIX. 1. _Dr._ J. W. WEBSTER'S _Lectures_.   Dr. J. W. Webster, some months =
since,=20

commenced a course of Lectures in the town of Boston, on Geology and Minera=
logy. Having=20

finished his first course, he is now occupied with a second on the same sub=
jects, and we=20


_
Mountain on that winter night,--an awkward looking group that made progress=
 slowly because of=20

the burden which it bore.  "You'd better go ahead to the Emmons place and g=
et Doctor Emmons to=20

come up to our camp quickly," said Norris to the older of the Williams boys=
. "You ought to get=20

there about the time we do, and tell him to bring stimulants and everything=
 that he may need."=20

Back in the Norris cabin Neil Durant had found that conversation between hi=
mself and the mining=20

engineer lagged. For half an hour the elder Norris had sat apparently absor=
bed in his thoughts,=20

and twice when Neil had made remarks he had answered in a manner that showe=
d his mind to be=20

far away. Neil himself was indulging in reveries when the sudden interrupti=
on came,--a sound of=20

voices outside the cabin, an exclamation, a quick thrusting in of the door,=
 and then the noise of=20

persons talking awkwardly, as those who carry a heavy burden. The two at th=
e fireplace turned in=20

their chairs and saw immediately that something serious had happened.  "He =
crashed into a tree=20

on the big Slide," said Ted Norris. "His body seems warm but we're afraid t=
hat--well, just look at=20

his neck; it moves so queerly. Doctor Emmons ought to be here any minute. B=
ert Williams went=20

down ahead to get him."  Within the space of a second, it seemed, Wolcott N=
orris had taken=20

charge of the situation. Teeny-bits Holbrook was laid out on a cot which th=
ey brought in from one=20

of the sleeping rooms and placed in front of the fire, and here a quarter o=
f an hour later Doctor=20

Emmons made his diagnosis.  "No, his neck isn't broken," said the surgeon, =
"so you needn't worry=20

about that, and you can see from the color of his face that he isn't in imm=
ediate danger. He has a=20

concussion, which isn't necessarily serious,--though that's a pretty bad bl=
ow he received on his=20

head. Now with your help, Mr. Norris, we'll look him over for further injur=
ies. There may be some=20

broken bones to contend with also."  Without loss of time the surgeon, aide=
d by the mining=20

engineer, removed, most of Teeny-bits' clothing and began the process of ex=
amination by which=20

he quickly established the fact that no bones had been broken and that the =
only injury from which=20

Teeny-bits was suffering was the one to his head. During this examination o=
ne slight incident=20

attracted the attention of Neil Durant and his friends who stood about spea=
king to each other in=20

whispers. It occurred when Wolcott Norris, following instructions from the =
surgeon, with trembling=20

hands uncovered Teeny-bits' back and revealed the dagger-like, terra-cotta =
mark upon his bare=20

shoulder. For an instant the mining engineer had seemed about to faint; he =
wavered on his feet=20

and groped suddenly for the support of a chair-back. To the watchers it had=
 appeared that he had=20

become momentarily unnerved by the unexpected accident, or that perhaps he =
had seen=20

something in Teeny-bits' condition that was unfavorable. The surgeon, howev=
er, had quickly=20

reassured them as they pressed forward a little closer by saying:  "He's so=
und from top-knot to toe=20

except for that ugly smash on the head. Now we'll put these blankets over h=
im and keep him quiet.=20

If the concussion isn't bad he'll become conscious before very long."  But =
hour after hour passed=20

and Teeny-bits did not regain his senses. He lay in a stupor, occasionally =
muttering thick and=20

unintelligible words.  "There's no need of you fellows staying up," said Wo=
lcott Norris at midnight.=20

"The doctor and I will be here with Teeny-bits and the best thing you can d=
o is go to bed."  After a=20

time the Williams brothers went home and Whipple and Phillips followed the =
mining engineer's=20

advice. Neil Durant and Ted Norris, however, refused to leave the room wher=
e Teeny-bits lay.=20

They sat together by the fireplace and waited for an encouraging word from =
the surgeon.  "I know=20

he'll pull through," said Neil. "He's as tough as a wildcat."  "Some boy!" =
said the big son of=20

Jefferson. "He's the real goods. Oh, he's got to come out of it."  Finally =
these two friends, who had=20



fought each other so valiantly only a few weeks before, dozed off sitting t=
here side by side, with=20

the ruddy light of the fireplace on their faces.  They awoke simultaneously=
. The gray light of=20

morning had begun to penetrate the camp windows, and Teeny-bits was sitting=
 up on the couch,=20

looking about him as if he had been awakened from a puzzling dream.  "What =
did I do with the=20

skis?" he asked and, raising his hands to his bandaged head, gazed at his f=
riends in=20

bewilderment.  The doctor and Wolcott Norris, Neil and Ted were beside the =
cot in an instant.  "It's=20

all right, old man!" said Neil. "You got a thump on your head coming down t=
he slide."  "It feels----"=20

Teeny-bits began. But his head was too heavy; the shadow of a smile crossed=
 his face and lying=20

back on the pillow he closed his eyes.  "We must keep very quiet," said the=
 surgeon. "He'll sleep=20

now and be the better for it."     CHAPTER XIV  A TALE OF THE FAR EAST   It=
 was as Doctor=20

Emmons predicted: Teeny-bits slept half the morning through and awoke with =
a clear look in his=20

eyes that indicated at once to his friends that his dazed condition had pas=
sed.  "What did the most=20

_Dr. Webster's Cabinet._  Dr. Webster, having spent two or three years in E=
urope, in professional=20

studies, during which time he devoted much attention to mineralogy and geol=
ogy, with the ample=20

aids afforded by the cabinets and distinguished teachers in Scotland, Franc=
e, and England, has=20

recently returned to his own country, and has brought with him a very selec=
t and considerably=20

extensive cabinet of minerals, with which, and with American specimens, he =
illustrates his=20

lectures. We understand that the collection contains some thousand specimen=
s, and is good in the=20

English and Scotch minerals; also in the Siberian coppers; it contains a su=
ite of three hundred=20

geological specimens from Freyberg, from granite to gravel. The geological =
part is extensive, and=20

was increased by numerous pedestrian tours in England and Scotland; most of=
 the geological=20

specimens have been examined, in company with Professor Jameson. The volcan=
ic part is good,=20

from the extensive opportunities which Dr. Webster enjoyed in the Azores, i=
n which, on his return=20

to this country, he spent some time, and found much to interest him. His ob=
servations will soon be=20

given to the public, in a work entitled _Remarks on the Azores or Western I=
slands_.  It is well=20

known that they are volcanic, and of course afford the usual volcanic subst=
ances. The most=20

interesting part is that occupied by the boiling fountains, in many respect=
s similar to the Geysers of=20

Iceland, excepting that the water is not ejected to any considerable height=
; but the incrustations,=20

the sinter, and sulphur, are every way equal to any specimens which Dr. Web=
ster saw in Sir G.=20

Mackenzie's collection.  We are much gratified in noticing both what Dr. We=
bster has done and is=20

still doing. We are persuaded that he will do much towards promoting the cu=
ltivation of American=20

mineralogy and geology, and especially in the enlightened community in whic=
h he resides.  We=20

cordially wish him success, and trust that it will be ensured by the patron=
age of the citizens of=20

Boston.   3. _Supposed identity of Copal and Amber._  A correspondent, whos=
e paper is withheld=20



from publication till some additional experiments can be made, conceives th=
at copal and amber=20

are originally the same substance, and the product of the same tree.   4. T=
HE NECRONITE.--(_A=20

supposed new mineral._)  _Extract of a letter from Dr. H. H. Hayden of Balt=
imore, to the Editor,=20

dated January 5, 1819._  "It (the necronite) occurs in a primitive marble, =
or limestone, which is=20

obtained 21 miles from Baltimore, and a small distance from the York and La=
ncaster road. It was=20

first noticed by myself at Washington's monument, in which this marble is p=
rincipally employed.  "It=20

occurs, for the most part, in isolated masses in the blocks, or slabs, both=
 in an amorphous and=20

crystallized state. It is most commonly associated with a beautiful brown m=
ica, of the colour of=20

titanium; small but regular crystals of sulphuret of iron, tremolite, and s=
mall prismatic crystals of=20

titanium, which are rare. The form of the crystals is a rhomboid, approxima=
ting very much to that of=20

the felspar, and which has inclined some to consider it as such. Also, the =
hexaedral prism,=20

resembling that of the beryl. This form is rare, and has not, as yet, I bel=
ieve, been found complete.=20

Its colour is a bluish white, and clear white. Its structure much resembles=
 felspar, being lamellar;=20

sometimes opaque, semi-transparent and transparent, at least in moderately =
thin pieces. It=20

scratches glass, carbonat of lime, and even felspar, in a _slight_ degree. =
In all our efforts, it has=20

been found infusible, per se, or with borate of soda, and even from all the=
 force of heat that could=20

be excited in a smith's furnace, it came out unchanged in any degree. The a=
cids seem to have no=20

sensible effect upon it, either cold or hot. This is all that I can say of =
it at present, except that it=20

possesses a most _horrid_ smell.[44] I have since found in a marble of the =
same kind, but from a=20

different quarry, and a few miles distant from the first, a quartz almost a=
s fetid as the necronite,=20

and likewise associated with _small_ prisms of titanium.  "These substances=
 carry with them a=20

degree of interest in another point of view. They seem to invalidate the op=
inion that the fetid smell=20

of secondary limestone, slate, &c. is derived from the decomposition of ani=
mal matter. As their=20


_
"A big oak tree," said Ted Norris.  "I knocked it down, didn't I?" asked Te=
eny-bits. "My head feels=20

as if I did."  His friends laughed with a happy abandon in which there was =
a quality that expressed=20

release from a great fear.  Under the doctor's orders Teeny-bits remained i=
n bed the rest of the=20

week, though he declared on the second day that he was feeling fit and want=
ed to get up.=20

Meanwhile the holidays came to an end. Phillips and Whipple departed for Je=
fferson School and at=20

the same time most of the other vacationers in the Pocassett settlement wen=
t their various ways.=20

Neil Durant and Ted Norris, however, insisted on staying until Teeny-bits w=
as entirely recovered. A=20

part of each day they sat about the cabin talking over school and college l=
ife.  "If you fellows would=20

only wait a year I might go to college with you," Teeny-bits said one day, =
half jokingly.  "I might do=20

it at that," said Neil Durant. "Father has been talking to me about staying=
 out a year and working=20

before I start in."  "That's not a bad idea," said Wolcott Norris. "Most of=
 the fellows to-day enter=20

college with a pretty vague notion of what they're going to do and it might=
 help a lot to get out and=20

work for a year or so before you continue your education. I think it would =
be time well spent."  The=20

conversation was brief, but it began something which was destined to come t=
o pass.  During these=20

days while he was recovering, Teeny-bits rock of primitive formation."   _A=
nother new mineral=20

observed by Dr. Hayden._  "Exclusive of the interest which the necronite ha=
s excited with me and=20

several others, I have besides stumbled upon another substance, if possible=
 still more interesting.=20

I discovered it in an imperfect state, about 4 years since, but not until r=
ecently have I been able to=20

find it perfect, in beautiful garnet coloured cubic crystals =C2=BC of an i=
nch square or nearly. These=20

crystals are very liable or subject to decomposition, in which state they p=
resent a perfect but=20

spongy cube. Although they resemble the cubic zeolite, yet they have nothin=
g of its character with=20

them besides."   _Remark._  Dr. Hayden without doubt alludes to the _chabas=
ie_ of the Abb=C3=A9=20

Ha=C3=BCy, formerly but inaccurately called the cubic zeolite; for it is re=
ally a rhomboid very nearly=20

approaching a cube--its angles being 93=C2=B0 48, and 86=C2=B0 12.   5. PRE=

This salt gradually combines with the flesh, gives it firmness, renders it =

_
opportunity to accomplish the thing for which he had envied Neil Durant on =
the night of the=20

accident,--to become better acquainted with Wolcott Norris. While Ted and N=
eil, who had=20

recovered from his sprained ankle, were out on snowshoes and skis, the mini=
ng engineer and the=20

new captain of the Ridgley team spent many hours together. The admiration t=
hat Teeny-bits had=20

felt for this man with the straight figure and the keen eyes steadily incre=
ased. Here, he said to=20

himself, was a man whose character showed in his face and whose life any on=
e would do well to=20

imitate. There was something about Wolcott Norris that inspired Teeny-bits =
with a feeling of=20

confidence, and somewhat to his surprise he found himself telling the minin=
g engineer things that=20

he had never told even to such good friends as Neil Durant or Snubby Turner=
,--confidences about=20

his own feeling toward the other members of the school, hopes for the futur=
e and something of the=20

ambitions for the attainment of which he meant to strive. For some reason w=
hich he could not=20

analyze it seemed entirely natural to be conversing intimately--even after =
such a short=20

acquaintance--with Wolcott Norris.  "You two fellows seem to be getting pre=
tty chummy," said Ted=20

Norris one afternoon when he and Neil came in and found Teeny-bits and the =
 "I have seen, (adds=20

the author) a head thus prepared, which had been exposed alternately to the=
 sun and rain during=20

several years, without having suffered the slightest change. It was very li=
ttle deformed, and easily=20

recognized, although the flesh had become as hard as wood."   6. MATCHES KI=
NDLING=20

WITHOUT FIRE.  (_From Thenard's Chemistry, Vol._ ii. _p._ 525.)  This match=
 is prepared by=20

mingling two parts of the oxymuriate of potash and one of sulphur, which by=
 means of a little gum=20

is attached to a common sulphur match. This match on being dipped into, or =
rather slightly wet=20

with, strong sulphuric acid, (oil of vitriol) immediately catches fire.  Th=
e author has not added the=20

caution that the sulphur and salt should be pulverized separately; if rubbe=
d together in a mortar,=20

they will explode with some danger to the operator, provided the quantity b=
e over a few grains.=20

Matches made upon this principle, have been for some time made and sold in =
this country. They=20

are sometimes put up in little japanned cases with a small phial, from whic=
h when inverted with the=20

mouth open, nothing will drop, and yet the match kindles on being thrust in=
 quite to the bottom.=20

The truth is, these bottles contain a little amianthus moistened with sulph=
uric acid, which thus=20

kindles the match, but as the=20
