 the south, we fired the grass in all directions; we thus had a line of fir=

carried the blaze rapidly in the other direction. We rode along the bottom =
of a watercourse and reached an old wild pear-tree, which had been struck b=

the high grass, leaving me rather confused from the fall upon my head. The =
herd, instead of=20

crushing me as they ought to have done, took fright, and bolted off at thei=

were dancing with the fall; the mounted gun-bearers were nowhere, as Gazell=

elephants, and Tetel was far behind. My English saddle had vanished with Ag=
