"No, it's not that," I said with a shake of the head. "It's only that I'm--=
I'm a trifle too chilly to be=20

comfortable."  And the foolish youth, at that, straightway fell to stoking =
the fire. I had to laugh a=20

little. And that made him study me with solemn eyes.  "Just think, Gershom,=
" I said as I gathered=20

up my sewing, "my heart is perishing of cold in a province which is estimat=
ed to contain almost=20

seventeen per cent. of the world's known coal supply!"  And that, apparentl=
y, left him with=20

something to think about as I made my way off to bed ... It's hard to write=
 coherently, I find, when=20

you're not living coherently ...  Syd Woodward, of Buckhorn, having learned=
 that I can drive a=20

tractor, has asked me if I'll take part in the plowing-match to-morrow. And=
 I've given my promise to=20

show Mere Man what a woman can do in the matter of turning a mile-long furr=
ow. I feel rather=20

audacious over it all. And I'm glad to inject a little excitement into life=
 ... I'm saving up for a new=20

sewing-machine ... Tarzanette has got rather badly cut up in some of our ba=
rb-wire fencing.=20

_Friday the Fifteenth_   The plowing-match was good fun, and I enjoyed it e=
ven more than I had=20

expected. The men "kidded" me a good deal, and gave me a cheer at the end (=
I don't quite know=20

whether it was for my work or my costume) and I had to pose for photographs=
, and a moving-

picture man even followed me about for a round, shooting me as I turned my =
prairie stubble upside=20

down. But the excitement of the plowing-match has been eclipsed by a bit of=
 news which has=20

rather taken my breath away. _It is Peter Ketley who has bought the Harris =
Ranch._     _Saturday=20

the Twenty-Third_   The rains have brought mushrooms, slathers of mushrooms=
, and I joy in=20

gathering them.  Yesterday afternoon I rode past the Harris Ranch. The old =
place brought back a=20

confusion of memories. But I was most disturbed by the signs of building go=
ing on there. It seems=20

to mean a new shack on Alabama Ranch. And a new shack of very considerable =
dimensions. I've=20

been wondering what this implies. I don't know whether to be elated or depr=
essed. And what=20

business is it, after all, of mine?  My Dinkie--I have altogether given up =
trying to call my Dinkie=20

anything but Dinkie--came home two evenings ago with a discolored eye and a=
 distinct air of=20

silence. Gershom, too, seemed equally reticent. So I set about discreetly t=
hird-degreeing Poppsy,=20

who finally acknowledged, with awe in her voice, that Dinkie had been in a =
fight.  It was, according=20

to my petticoated Herodotus, a truly terrible fight. Noses got bloodied, an=
d no one could make the=20

fighters stop. But Dinkie was unquestionably the conqueror. Yet, oddly enou=
gh, I am informed that=20

he cried all through the combat. He was a crying fighter. And he had his fi=
ght with Climmie=20

O'Lone--trust the Irish to look for trouble!--who seems to have been accept=
ed as the ring-master of=20

his younger clan. Their differences arose out of the accusation that Dinkie=
, my bashful little Dinkie,=20

had been forcing his unwelcomed attention on one Doreen O'Lone, Climmie's y=
ounger sister.=20

That's absurd, of course. And Dinkie must have realized it. He didn't want =
to fight, acknowledged=20

Poppsy, from the first. He even cried over it. And Doreen also cried. And P=
oppsy herself joined in.=20

I fancy it was a truly Homeric struggle, for it seems to have lasted for ro=
und after round. and the=20

disadvantages of Lincoln's political education are manifest at a glance. He=
 was sure to produce=20

something strong, genuine, practical, and entirely in unison with the thoug=
hts and feelings of a=20

people which, like the Athenians in the days of Pericles, was to be led, no=
t governed. On the other=20

hand, it necessarily left the statesman without the special knowledge neces=
sary for certain=20

portions of his work, such as finance, which was detestably managed during =
Lincoln's Presidency,=20

without the wisdom which flows from a knowledge of the political world and =
of the past, without=20

elevation, and comprehensiveness of view. It was fortunate for Lincoln that=
 the questions with=20



which he had to deal, and with which his country and the world proclaim him=
 to have dealt, on the=20

whole, admirably well, though not in their magnitude and importance, were c=
ompletely within his=20

ken, and had been always present to his mind. Reconstruction would have mad=
e a heavier=20

demand on the political science of Clary's Grove. But that task was reserve=
d for other hands.=20

ALFREDUS REX FUNDATOR   A few weeks ago an Oxford College celebrated the th=
ousandth=20

anniversary of its foundation by King Alfred. [Footnote: We keep the common=
 spelling, though=20

AElfred is more correct. It is impossible, in deference to antiquarian prec=
iseness, to change the=20

spelling of all these names, which are now imbedded in the English classics=
.]  The college which=20

claims this honour is commonly called University College, though its legal =
name is _Magna Aula=20

Universitatis_. The name "University College" causes much perplexity to vis=
itors. They are with=20

difficulty taught by the friend who is lionizing them to distinguish it fro=
m the University. But the=20

University of Oxford is a federation of colleges, of which University Colle=
ge is one, resembling in=20

all respects the rest of the sisterhood, being, like them, under the federa=
l authority of the=20

University, retaining the same measure of college right, conducting the dom=
estic instruction and=20

discipline of its students through its own officers, but sending them to th=
e lecture rooms of the=20

University Professors for the higher teaching, and to the University examin=
ation rooms to be=20

examined for their degrees. The college is an ample and venerable pile, wit=
h two towered=20

gateways, each opening into a quadrangle, its front stretching along the Hi=
gh Street, on the side=20

opposite St. Mary's Church. The darkness of the stone seems to bespeak imme=
morial antiquity,=20

but the style, which is the later Gothic characteristic of Oxford, and symb=
olical of its history, shows=20

that the buildings really belong to the time of the Stuarts. "That building=
 must be very old, Sir," said=20

an American visitor to the master of the college, pointing to its dark fron=
t. "Oh, no," was the=20

master's reply, "the colour deceives you; that building is not more than tw=
o hundred years old." In=20

invidious contrast to this mass, debased but imposing in its style, the ped=
antic mania for pure=20

Gothic which marks the Neo-catholic reaction in Oxford, and which will perh=
aps hereafter be=20

derided as we deride the classic mania of the last century, has led Mr. Gil=
bert Scott to erect a pure=20

Gothic library. This building, moreover, has nothing in its form to bespeak=
 its purpose, but=20

resembles a chapel. Over the gateway of the larger quadrangle is a statue, =
in Roman costume, of=20

James=20


_
Climmie was worsted and down on his back crying "Enough!" Which Poppsy repo=
rts Dinkie made=20

him say three times, until Doreen nodded and said she'd heard. But my young=
 son, apparently, is=20

one of those crying fighters, who are reckoned, if I remember right, as the=
 worst breed of=20

belligerents!  I have decided not to tell Dinkie what I know. But I'm rathe=
r anxious to get a glimpse=20

of this young Mistress Doreen, for whom lances are already being shattered =
in the lists of youth.=20

The O'Lones regard themselves as the career of reaction visited the college=
 and had two rooms=20

on the east side of the quadrangle fitted up for the performance of mass. O=
badiah Walker, the=20

master of the college, had turned Papist, and became one of the leaders of =
the reaction, in the=20

overthrow of which he was involved, the fall of his master and the ruin of =
his party being=20

announced to him by the boys singing at his window--"Ave Maria, old Obadiah=
." In the same=20

quadrangle are the chambers of Shelley, and the room to which he was summon=
ed by the=20


_
Doreen O'Lone impresses me as a very musical appellative. Yet I prefer to k=
eep my kin free from=20

all entangling alliances, even though they have to do with a cattle-king's =
offspring....  I had a short=20

letter from Dinky-Dunk to-day, asking me to send on a package of papers whi=
ch he had left in a=20

pigeon-hole of his desk here. It was a depressingly non-committal little no=
te, without a glimmer of=20

warmth friend Hogg, sentence of expulsion for having circulated an atheisti=
cal treatise. In the ante-

chapel is the florid monument of Sir William Jones. But the modern diviniti=
es of the college are the=20

two great legal brothers, Lord Eldon and Lord Stowell, whose colossal statu=
es fraternally united=20

are conspicuous in the library, whose portraits hang side by side in the ha=
ll, whose medallion=20

busts greet you=20
