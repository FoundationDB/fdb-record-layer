IN CANADA WITH A LYNX  By Roe L. Hendrick   This adventure came about throu=
gh an invitation=20

which Ray Churchill received from his friend, Jacques Pourbiere of Two Rive=
rs, New Brunswick.=20

Ray had half-promised to visit his New Brunswick acquaintance during the de=
er-hunting season,=20

and late in August was reminded of the fact. A second letter came in Septem=
ber, the carefully=20

worded school English of the writer not being able to conceal the warmth an=
d urgency of the=20

invitation.  So Ray telegraphed his acceptance, and four days later arrived=
 at Fredericton, where=20

he secured a hunting license. The next morning he reached Two Rivers, and J=
acques met him=20

with a span of ponies, attached to a queer spring vehicle, mounted on wheel=
s that seemed out of=20

all proportion to the body of the carriage. Ray wondered if it was a relic =
of Acadia, but did not like=20

to ask. They drove for a dozen miles through a wooded and hilly country, an=
d arrived at their=20

destination shortly before nightfall.  Jacques was quite alone at the time,=
 as his parents had gone=20

to visit their older children along the St. John River. He promised Ray at =
carry on daily life without=20

him. It really was unpleasant and disturbing in the highest degree, this il=
lness of Leek's. The fellow=20

had apparently caught cold on the night-boat. He had fought the approaches =
of insidious disease=20

for several hours, going forth to make purchases and incidentally consultin=
g a doctor; and then,=20

without warning, in the very act of making up Farll's couch, he had abandon=
ed the struggle, and,=20

since his own bed was not ready, he had taken to his master's. He always di=
d the natural thing=20

naturally. And Farll had been forced to help him to undress!  From this poi=
nt onwards Priam Farll,=20

opulent though he was and illustrious, had sunk to a tragic impotence. He c=
ould do nothing for=20

himself; and he could do nothing for Leek, because Leek refused both brandy=
 and sandwiches,=20

and the larder consisted solely of brandy and sandwiches. The man lay upsta=
irs there, comatose,=20

still, silent, waiting for the doctor who had promised to pay an evening vi=
sit. And the summer day=20

had darkened into the summer night.  The notion of issuing out into the wor=
ld and personally=20

obtaining food for himself or aid for=20

week.  The Pourbiere home resembled those of the better class of _habitants=
_, but with a=20

difference due to the greater prosperity of the family in preceding generat=
ions. The main room had=20

a huge fireplace, used only occasionally, for there was an air-tight stove =
connected with the=20

chimney just above it, to afford greater warmth in winter. The other rooms =
Were chiefly impossible=20

notion; he had never done such things. For him a shop was an impregnable fo=
rt garrisoned by=20

ogres. Besides, it would have been necessary to 'ask,' and 'asking' was the=
 torture of tortures. So=20

he had wandered, solicitous and helpless, up and down the stairs, until at =
length Leek, ceasing to=20

be a valet and deteriorating into a mere human organism, had feebly yet=20
