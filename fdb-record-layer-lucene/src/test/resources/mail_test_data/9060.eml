dracaena marginata householders themselves, and those which are to be shared in common with outsiders. The private rooms are those into which nobody has the right to enter without an invitation, such as bedrooms, dining rooms, bathrooms,  "Excuse me, professor," he laughs, "but that would be odd of me, to say the least of it. After studying for five years, all at once to give it up."  "Oh, well!

exposure, for the reason that they need the evening light, and also because the setting sun, facing 

them in all its splendour but with abated heat, lends a gentler warmth to that quarter in the 

evening. Bedrooms and libraries ought to have an eastern exposure, because their purposes 

require the morning light, and also because books in such libraries will not decay. In libraries with 

southern exposures the books are ruined by worms and dampness, because damp winds come 

up, which breed and nourish the worms, and destroy the books with mould, by spreading their 

damp breath over them.  2. Dining rooms for Spring and Autumn to the east; for when the windows 

face that quarter, the sun, as he goes on his career from over against them to the west, leaves 

such rooms at the proper temperature at the time when it is customary to use them. Summer 

dining rooms to the north, because that quarter is not, like the others, burning with heat during the 

solstice, for the reason that it is unexposed to the sun's course, and hence broad natures, whose 

failure at examinations spoils their appetites and hinders them from visiting the opera with their 

usual regularity. I let the first class off easily, but the second I chivy through a whole year.  "Sit 

down," I say to my visitor; "what have you to tell me?"  "Excuse me, professor, for troubling you," 

he begins, hesitating, and not looking me in the face. "I would not have ventured to trouble you if it 

had not been... I have been up for your examination five times, and have been ploughed.... I beg 

you, be so good as to mark me for a pass, because..."  The argument which all the sluggards 

bring forward on their own behalf is always the same; they have passed well in all their subjects 

and have only come to grief in mine, and that is the more surprising because they have always 

been particularly interested in my subject and knew it so well; their failure has always been entirely 

owing to some incomprehensible misunderstanding.  "Excuse me, my friend," I say to the visitor; "I 

cannot mark you

healthy and agreeable. Similarly with picture galleries, embroiderers' work rooms, and painters' 

studios, in order that the fixed light may permit the colours used in their work to last with qualities 

unchanged.     CHAPTER V  HOW THE ROOMS SHOULD BE SUITED TO THE STATION OF 

THE OWNER   1. After settling the positions of the rooms with regard to the quarters of the sky, 

we must next consider the principles on which should be constructed those apartments in private 

houses pass. Go and read up the lectures and come to me again. Then we shall see."  A pause. I 

feel an impulse to torment the student a little for liking beer and the opera better than science, and 

I say, with a sigh:  "To my mind, the best thing you can do now is to give up medicine altogether. 

If, with your abilities, you cannot succeed in passing the examination, it's evident that you have 

neither the desire nor the vocation for a doctor's calling."  The sanguine youth's face
