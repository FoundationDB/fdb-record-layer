philodendron monstera the goods all along the line, Perk.  Besides that, it=
 was Skinner that got us to put in that new machinery over in Newark.  Why,=
 it's already saved a quarter of its cost in fuel.  Also, Perk, he's a grea=

of quiet to think over his plan again, and he did think it over, and recove=

ls requested permission to sit down and wait. He had a long time of quiet t=
o think over his plan again, and he did think it over, and recovered his co=
urage. After a time Mrs Monypenny, hearing who it was, _
"Better?"  "Yes.  I want to be put in charge of the sales department.  You =
see, I not only know the=20

business from beginning to end, but I want to show our salesmen that sellin=
g goods means=20

something more than rattling off a list of what you've got, dilating like a=
 parrot.  I want to teach=20

them the value of knowledge of the personal equation and how to apply that =
knowledge effectively.=20

Does n't that telegram from Jackson show that I know something about it?"  =
"What do you think of=20

Skinner's proposition?" McLaughlin said to the junior partner.  Perkins tur=
ned and came back to=20

the table.  "Skinner seems to have the goods."  "Mr. McLaughlin," Skinner u=
rged, "it is n't that I feel=20

big about what I've done, it is n't that I think I know more than anybody e=
lse, but I've had ideas=20

about things I've always wanted to put into practice. When you sent me out =
to St. Paul, I=20

formulated a little scheme of attack on Jackson, and you saw how it worked.=
  I think that entitles=20

my opinion to some respect.  I've got the good of this concern at heart and=
 I want to show what=20

can be done along original lines."  McLaughlin looked at Perkins and Perkin=
s nodded affirmatively.=20

"Skinner, I 'm going to let you see what you can do," said the senior partn=
er; then paused.  He=20

turned to Perkins.  "The devil of it is, what to do with Hobson."  "Let him=
 take charge of the San=20

Francisco office," Perkins suggested.  "I don't like to hurt the old chap's=
 feelings."  "Hurt his=20

feelings?  Why, he's always wanted to go back to the Coast--where he belong=
s."  All that day,=20

while Skinner was instructing the young man who was to succeed him as "cage=
 man," he was very=20

happy.  He was happy that the field of his activities was broadening, that =
he'd have a chance to=20

show what was in him.  But he was particularly happy that now he would neve=
r have to tell Honey=20

that he'd deceived her.  This, saw Rolls standing by, and waved his hand to=
 him. "What! have you=20

walked all this way," he said, "old Truepenny,"--with something of the same=
 levity of despair which=20

dictated the same words to Hamlet,--"to see the last of me?"  "It's not com=
e to that, sir, I hope,"=20

said Rolls, with a seriousness which was as solemn as if what John had said=
 was real. The young=20

man laughed.  "You will pack my portmanteau and send it after me: I suppose=
 I may be allowed=20

that?" he said. The officer who was in attendance bowed his head. The peopl=
e about gathered=20

round, staring at John with too much surprise to express any other emotion;=
 and by-and-by the=20

party drove off again, nobody apparently divining exactly what it all meant=
. There were a number=20

of petty cases to be tried by the sheriff, who was in the Town-house, as it=
 was called, and as many=20

different interests as there were loungers about. Rolls went in with hesita=
ting steps after his master=20

had disappeared. The old man had come, in full expectation of the event whi=
ch had happened; but=20

fact is always different from anticipation. When he saw what he had only lo=
oked for, the effect=20

upon him was something overwhelming. He stood staring and gaping in the lit=
tle crowd which=20

gradually drew together, realising only after it was over what had taken pl=
ace before their eyes.=20

"What's wrang with the young maister, Mr Rolls?" said one of the bystanders=
. "Let me be!" cried=20

the old man, shaking himself free; and he went into the Town-house with tot=
tering steps. He had=20

intended taking certain bold and immediate steps, carrying out the project =
he had been framing in=20

his mind; but his nerves were shaken when the moment came. The law terrifie=
d him. If his master,=20

in all the strength and confidence of his youth, was thus peremptorily deal=
t with, what aggravations=20

might not he, an old and humble individual--nothing but a=20


_
mused, for he would not be able to tell her about the twenty-five dollars a=
dvance he'd just got.  He=20

would go right along as he had been doing, each week giving Honey ten dolla=
rs to deposit in the=20

Meadeville National.  Then he, himself, would deposit ten dollars a week un=
til he'd made up for the=20

number of weeks that had elapsed since he'd promoted himself.  Thus their l=
ittle bank account=20

would remain intact, and Honey would not know unless--his heart slowed down=
--McLaughlin=20

should take to bragging about him and how they'd shown their appreciation o=
f what he'd done in=20

St. Paul, and Mrs. McLaughlin should get hold of it and pass it along to Ho=
ney--which would have=20

the effect of perpetuating his original, devilish raise.  But he was n't go=
ing to cross that bridge yet!=20

And so it came about that eight months later, one beautiful morning in Dece=
mber, McLaughlin said=20

to the junior stole up to an attendant and made faltering inquiries. "What =
will they have settled=20

about yon case?" he said. "About what case?--the sheep-lifting, or the unla=
wfu' wounding, or the=20

robbery at Willyam Tamson's----" "Nane o' thae things--nane o' thae things,=
" said old Rolls. "It's=20

about young Mr Erskine of Dalrulzian." "Oh, ay, ay," said the attendant, sh=
aking his head; "that's=20

very serious. The circumstances a' point to some agent mair than accident--=
that's what the sherra=20

says, and he canna see his way to discharging the panel." "The panel![1]--h=
e's nae panel!--mind=20

what you're saying," cried Rolls. "Well, maybe that's going owre fast. I wo=
uld say the gentleman=20

under suspicion. He maun just bide the result of a mair formal examination-=
-that's a' I can tell ye; I=20

have nae time to enter into particulars," the official said.  [Footnote 1: =
_Scottic_, accused.]  Rolls,=20

who had=20


_
has come upon us!"  "What's the matter?  Has Skinner asked for another rais=
e?"  "Worse'n that.=20

The Starr-Bacon people have made him an offer!"  "I see!  That's because he=
 pried Willard=20

Jackson and others loose from that concern.  Probably they want him to use =
the same method to=20

get those people away from us and back in to the S.-B. fold."  "It's clear =
what _they_ want.  It is n't=20

so clear what we've got to do."  "Raise his pay again," Perkins suggested. =
 "That went out again,=20

scarcely knowing where he was going, into the streets of Dunearn. There eve=
rybody looked at him=20

with curious eyes. The town had at last become conscious of what had happen=
ed: from a public-

house in the environs a stone had been thrown at John Erskine as he went pa=
st, and hootings had=20

risen on his path. This roused the population fully, and now the streets we=
re full of groups=20

discussing the matter. Torrance, as has been said, was popular in his=20


_
opportunity."  "I hope he's willing to let you and me run things a while lo=
nger."  "I don't know what=20

to do.  You see, Skinner proved to be an awfully good man, just so soon as =
we gave him his head.=20

He's an all-round man. When he was cashier, he not only of pity and charity=
 which follows a=20

sudden and unexpected death; and John Erskine was comparatively unknown. Th=
e tide was=20

strongly against him, as a semi-foreigner--a man who had come from "abroad.=
" "He'll find here that=20

gentle and simple must keep the laws=20


_
had a cent, and without losing business either, but he steered us away from=
 some very bad risks=20

that those two enterprising young salesmen, Briggs and Henderson, tried to =
'put over' on us."=20

"That was his business.  He was cashier."  "But see what he's done since we=
 made him manager=20

of the sales department," urged McLaughlin.  "He has not only opened up new=
 territory and got in=20

new customers, but he's reclaimed old, abandoned fields of operation and go=
t back a lot of old=20

fellows.  daurna ride roughshod over his fellows here."  Old Rolls heard th=
e growl of popular=20

excitement, and it alarmed him still more. "If it was me they would tear me=
 in bits," he said to=20

himself. His alarm on this point, as much as his original intention, drove =
him in at Mr Monypenny's=20

door, which was in his way. He was afraid of being recognised as the butler=
 at Dalrulzian ("for=20

everybody kens me," he said to himself, with mingled pride and panic), and =
he was anxious to=20

consult the "man=20
