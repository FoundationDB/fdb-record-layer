dracaena marginata beyond them you are on the Manasic Plane.  Try to imagine something which transcends your power of thought, say, the nature of the Dhyan Chohans. Then make the brain passive, and pass beyond; you the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent."  The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant:  "You will follow these men and not lose sight of them; when you have discovered dracaena marginata beyond them you are on the Manasic Plane.

Thus both the bad and the good of such thoughts and actions are impressed on the Auric 

Envelope and the Karma of the bad is taken up by the Higher Ego, though it is perfectly guiltless of 

it. Thus both sets of impressions, after death, scatter in the Universal Mind, and at reincarnation 

the Ego sends out a Ray which is itself, into a new personality, and there suffers. It suffers in the 

Self-consciousness that it has created by its own accumulated experiences.  Every one of our 

Egos has the Karma of past Manvantaras behind. There are seven Hierarchies of Egos, some of 

which, _e.g._, in inferior tribes, may be said to be only just beginning the present cycle. The Ego 

starts with Divine Consciousness; no past, no future, no separation. It is long before realizing that 

it is itself. Only after many births does it begin to discern, by this collectivity of experience, that it is 

individual. At the end of its cycle of reincarnation it is still the same Divine Consciousness, but it 

has now become individualized Self-consciousness.  The feeling of responsibility is inspired by the 

presence of the Light of the Higher Ego. As the Ego in its cycle of re-birth becomes more and 

more individualized, it learns more and more by suffering to recognize its own responsibility, by 

which it finally gains Self-consciousness, the consciousness of all the Egos of the whole Universe. 

Absolute Being, to have the idea or sensation of all this, must pass through all experience 

individually, not universally, so that when it returns it should be of the same omniscience as the 

Universal Mind _plus_ the memory of all that it has passed through.  At the Day "Be with us" every 

Ego has to remember all the cycles of its past reincarnations for Manvantaras. The Ego comes in 

contact with this earth, all seven Principles become one, it sees all that it has done therein. It sees 

the stream of its past reincarnations by a certain divine light. It sees all humanity at once, but still 

there is ever, as it were, a stream which is always the "I."  We should therefore always endeavour 

to accentuate our responsibility.  The Higher Ego is, as it were, a globe of pure divine light, a Unit 

from a higher plane, on which is no differentiation. Descending to a plane of differentiation it 

emanates a Ray,  "I am," replied the latter, gravely.  "Very well, my dear sir, you are the prisoner of 

a fellow countryman."  "But the king--where is the king?" exclaimed Athos, anxiously.  D'Artagnan 

vigorously seized his prisoner's hand, saying:  "Eh! the king? We have secured him."  "Yes," said 

Aramis, "through an infamous act of treason."  Porthos pressed his friend's hand and said to him: 

"Yes, sir, all is fair in war, stratagem as well as force; look yonder!"  At this instant the squadron, 

that ought to have protected Charles's retreat, was advancing to meet the English regiments. The 

king, who was entirely surrounded, walked alone in a great empty space. He appeared calm, but it 

was evidently not without a mighty effort. Drops of perspiration trickled down his face, and from 

time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it.  "Behold 

Nebuchadnezzar!" exclaimed an old Puritan soldier, whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man 

they called the tyrant.  "Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar?" said Mordaunt, with a terrible smile; 

"no, it is Charles the First, the king, the good King Charles, who despoils his subjects to enrich 

himself."  Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this, but did not 

recognize him. Nevertheless, the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mordaunt. 

"Bon jour, messieurs!" said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by D'Artagnan and 

Porthos. "The day has been unfortunate, but it is not your fault, thank God! But where is my old 

friend Winter?"  The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence.  "In Strafford's company," 

said Mordaunt, tauntingly.  Charles shuddered. The demon had known how to wound him. The 

remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him, the shadow that haunted him by 



day and night. The king looked around him. He saw a corpse at his feet. It was Winter's. He 

uttered not a word, nor shed a tear, but a deadly pallor spread over his face; he knelt down on the 

ground, raised Winter's head, and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit, placed it on his own 

breast.  "Lord Winter is killed, then?" inquired D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes on the corpse.  "Yes," 

said Athos, "by his own nephew."  "Come, he was the first of us to go; peace be

personality which is already differentiated. A portion of this Ray, the Lower Manas, during life, may 

so crystallize itself and become one with Kama that it will remain assimilated with Matter. That 

portion which retains its purity forms Antahkarana. The whole fate of an incarnation depends on 

whether Antahkarana will be able to restrain the Kama-Manas or not. After death the higher light 

(Antahkarana) which bears the impressions and memory of all good and noble aspirations, 

assimilates itself with the Higher Ego, the bad is dissociated in space, and comes back as bad 

Karma awaiting the personality.  The feeling of responsibility is the beginning of Wisdom, a proof 

that Ahankara is beginning to fade out, the beginning of losing the sense of separateness.    Kama 

Rupa.   The Kama Rupa eventually breaks up and goes into animals. All red-blooded animals 

come from man. The cold-blooded are from the matter of the past. The blood is the Kama Rupa. 

The white corpuscles are the scavengers, "devourers"; man," said D'Artagnan.  "Charles Stuart," 

said the colonel of the English regiment, approaching the king, who had just put on the insignia of 

royalty, "do you yield yourself a prisoner?"  "Colonel Tomlison," said Charles, "kings cannot yield; 

the man alone submits to force."  "Your sword."  The king drew his sword and broke it on his knee. 

At this moment a horse without a rider, covered with foam, his nostrils extended and eyes all fire, 

galloped up, and recognizing his master, stopped and neighed with pleasure; it was Arthur.  The 

king smiled, patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle.  "Now, gentlemen," said he, 

"conduct me where you will."  Turning back again, he said, "I thought I saw Winter move; if he still 

lives, by all you hold most sacred, do not abandon him."  "Never fear, King Charles," said 

Mordaunt, "the bullet pierced his heart."  "Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or 

Porthos," said D'Artagnan to Athos and Aramis, "that you recognize this man, for

of the Astral through the spleen, and are of the same essence as the Astral. They are the sweat-

born of the Chhaya. Kama is everywhere in the body. The red cells are drops of electrical fluid, the 

perspiration of all the organs oozed out from every cell. They are the progeny of the Fohatic 

Principle.    Heart.   There are seven brains in the heart, the Upadhis and symbols of the seven 

Hierarchies.    The Fires.   The fires are always playing round the pineal gland, but when Kundalini 

illuminates them for a brief instant the whole universe is seen. Even in deep sleep the Third Eye 

opens. This is good for Manas, who profits by it, though we ourselves do not remember. 

Perception.   In answer to a question on the seven stages of perception, H. P. B. said that thought 

should be centred on the highest, the seventh, and then an attempt to transcend this will prove 

that it is is not dead; her soul lives in the body of this demon."  The detachment now moved toward 

the town with the royal captive; but on the road an aide-de-camp, from Cromwell, sent orders that 

Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle.  At the same time couriers started in 

every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of 

Oliver Cromwell.     57. Oliver Cromwell.   Have you been to the general?" said Mordaunt to 

D'Artagnan and Porthos; "you know he sent for you after the action."  "We want first to put our 

prisoners in a place of safety," replied D'Artagnan. "Do you know, sir, these gentlemen are each of 

them worth fifteen hundred pounds?"  "Oh, be assured," said Mordaunt, looking at them with an 

expression he vainly endeavoured to soften, "my soldiers will guard them, and guard them well, I 

promise you."  "I shall take better

on this plane. There is nothing in the brain to carry the thinker on, and if thought is to rise yet 

further it must be thought without a brain. Let the eyes be closed, the will set not to let the brain 

work, and then the point may be transcended and the student will pass to the next plane. All the 

seven stages of perception come before "besides, all they require is a good room, with sentinels, 

or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape. I will go and see about that, and then we 

shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his 

eminence."  "You think of starting at once, then?" inquired Mordaunt.  "Our mission is
