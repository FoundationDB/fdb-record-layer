philodendron monstera and fringed with bristly beard. "Mine," he said rough=

ick and powerful was the clutch that it almost dislocated Parr's shoulder. =
By sheer instinct, Parr struck with his free fist.  Square and solid on tha=

plate. And Ling, confident to the the stock. Did Delia ask any of the money=
 for her own use, Michael?  MICHAEL. She did not, indeed. She did not seem =
to take much notice of it, or to look at it at all.  BRIDGET. That's no won=
der. Why would she look at it when she had yourself to look at, a fine, str=
ong young man? It is proud she must be to get you, a good steady boy that w=

called Ling was by no=20

means the most human-seeming creature there, but he was plainly the ruler a=
nd plainly meant so=20

to continue. Parr was no coward, but he was no fool. As the six-foot bludge=
on whirled upward=20

between him and the sky, he cast down his own stick in token of surrender. =
 "No argument, Ling,"=20

he said sensibly.  There was laughter at  PETER. Indeed, I wish I had had t=
he luck to get a=20

hundred pounds, or twenty pounds itself, with the wife I married.  BRIDGET.=
 Well, if I didn't bring=20

much I didn't get much. What had you the day I married you but a flock of h=
ens and you feeding=20

them, and a few lambs and you driving them to the market at Ballina? [_She =
is vexed and bangs a=20

jug on the dresser._] If I brought no fortune, I worked it out in my bones,=

stripped bare his great pointed fangs in a snarl. Silence fell abruptly, an=

"You," he said. "You got on--" And he stepped close, tapping the plates on =
Parr's chest.  "It's=20

armor," said Parr.  "Huh! Ah--ar--" The word was too much for the creature,=
 whose brain and=20

mouth alike had forgotten most language. "Well," said Ling, "I want. I wear=
."  He fumbled at the=20

fastenings.  Parr jumped clear of him. He had accepted authority a moment a=
go, but this armor=20

was his insurance against becoming a beast. "It's mine," he objected.  Sole=
mnly Ling shook his=20

great browless head, as now, on a stook of straw, while I dug the potatoes,=
 and never asking big=20

dresses or anything but to be working.  PETER. That is true, indeed. [_He p=
ats her arm._]=20

BRIDGET. Leave me alone now till I ready the house for the woman that is to=

PETER. You are the best woman in Ireland, but money is good, too. [_He begi=

money again and sits down._] I never thought to see so much money within my=
 four walls. We can=20
