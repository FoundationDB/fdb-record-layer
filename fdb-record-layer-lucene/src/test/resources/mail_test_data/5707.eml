but in doing so must have lost the man. Her arrest would have given him not=
ice of his peril; and, in=20

truth, I was almost careless about the female's escape if I could catch her=
 companion.  Lord H----=20

was more exasperated than ever when he ascertained who the criminal was; al=
though he assured=20

his solicitors, as they informed me, that he had not the slightest knowledg=
e of the man, nor did he=20

suppose the delinquent had any knowledge of him beyond that which all thiev=
es of London might=20

have in common of a nobleman.  I suspected that some mysterious cause inspi=
red this desire for=20

vengeance in his lordship, besides the natural influence of his loss upon h=
is mind. That was=20

sufficient to account for much revengefulness, but it did not appear to me =
an adequate motive for=20

the sudden increase of such an emotion since the disclosure of the identity=
 of the criminal. I do=20

not, however, know that my suspicions were correct. It is possible that the=
y were incorrect.  The=20

offender was brought before the magistrate, in the usual course, and remand=
 upon remand was=20

applied for and obtained. The prisoner's attorney resisted the application =
with all his argumentative=20

power and force of advocacy, but in vain. The prosecution was thought by th=
e bench to be entitled=20

to every opportunity for discovering their property, and so involving the p=
risoner in the evidence of=20

his guilt as to render his escape through the meshes of the law impossible.=
  At length the case=20

was brought home with sufficient clearness to the prisoner, not only to war=
rant his committal for=20

trial, but to secure his conviction when that trial took place. He was acco=
rdingly committed.  Next=20

sessions a true bill was found against the prisoner by the grand jury of th=
e Central Criminal Court,=20

and in due course the prisoner was placed in the dock, to go through the gr=
eat ordeal in connexion=20

with this case.  The court was somewhat crowded. The incidents of this robb=
ery had attracted=20

public attention. The value of the plate, the rareness of the gems, the nea=
tness and completeness=20

of the exploit, had all combined to invest the case with an air of public i=
mportance.  In the court,=20

awaiting the trial with greedy anxiousness, were Lord and Lady H----.  In t=
he gallery was a female,=20

attired in costly raiment, enriched by here and there a jewel of considerab=
le value. She was,=20

perhaps, one of the handsomest women in London; and her beauty was of that =
order usually=20

denominated "sweet." There was an apparent gentleness and amiability of exp=
ression underlying=20

the traces of deep and painful emotion which something then transpiring, or=
 anticipated, had=20

aroused.  The eyes of this elegantly attired and beautiful female rested en=
tirely upon Lord and=20

Lady H----, who together occupied seats upon the bench on the right hand, a=
 short distance from=20

the judge, and who were prominent marks of observation for other persons be=
side this interesting=20

female.  The case then before the court was a tedious trial for perjury, in=
 which there was a mass=20

of conflicting evidence. The tasks of judge and jury were rendered peculiar=
ly difficult by the tangled=20

mass of fact and fiction which the skill of the prosecution and the dexteri=
ty of the defence had laid=20

before the court. To the parties interested in the next case--that of the p=
late robbery--no doubt this=20

protracted evidence was very irksome, as well as to the man in the dock, wh=
ose liberty trembled in=20

the balance of this conflicting testimony, or the discrimination of his fel=
lows the jurymen.=20

Simultaneously with the latter portion of this trial for perjury, the couns=
el for the defence, Mr.=20

Sergeant Ponderous and Mr. Anthony Stuffgown, were engaged in a consultatio=
n with Mr.=20

Wheedle, the prisoner's attorney.  A      And the woodpile looked like a mo=
nstrous drift,            As it=20

lay by the farmer=E2=80=99s door.=E2=80=9D  The chief damage in all snow st=
orms results from the temporary=20

obstruction of roads and cessation of business. No very great destruction o=
f human life has ever=20

resulted, save in case of armies overtaken by the storm. Napoleon lost four=
 hundred and fifty=20



thousand men on his Russian expedition. Both armies suffered terribly in th=
e recent Russo-Turkish=20

war, as they lay facing each other at Shipka Pass.  The constant accumulati=
ons of snow in the=20

colder regions of the earth produce those immense rivers of ice known as gl=
aciers, the fragments=20

breaking from which as they enter the sea are known as icebergs. These, bor=
ne by currents to the=20

southward, have no small influence in modifying the climate. In mountainous=
 regions the=20

accumulations of snow and ice produce snow-slides and avalanches; but owing=
 to their entirely=20

local character, the damage wrought by them is comparatively insignificant,=
 not even approaching=20

the lightning in the total.  Hail has been far more destructive. As stated =
elsewhere, the cause of=20

hail is hitherto unexplained. The storm usually travels in narrow belts. Ma=
ny are the wonderful=20

tales told of it. It is said that May 8, 1802, a mass of ice weighing eleve=
n hundred pounds fell in=20

Hungary. Again, we hear of an ice-block the size of an elephant, which fell=
 near Seringapatam, in=20

the reign of Tippoo Sahib. The good father Huc, in his travels in Tartary, =
reported the fall of an ice-

block the size of a millstone, which, in very warm weather, required three =
days to melt. And we are=20

told that in the time of Charlemagne, there fell hailstones fifteen feet lo=
ng, eleven feet wide and six=20

feet thick. All these we steadfastly do not believe.  Yet, there are well a=
uthenticated records of=20

many disastrous hail storms and enormous hailstones. A storm in France, in =
1788, traveled in two=20

bands: one, four hundred and twenty by ten miles; the other, five hundred b=
y five miles. Five=20

million dollars worth of property was destroyed. In 1865 a severe storm swe=
pt a wide path from=20

Bordeaux to Belgium, accumulating in such masses that it was not all melted=
 in one or two=20

localities for four days. One bed was one and one-fourth miles long and two=
-fifths of a mile wide,=20

containing twenty-one million cubic feet. Doubtless similar accumulations i=
n depressions, adhering=20

together, gave rise to the tales of enormous blocks mentioned above.  An en=
ormous hail storm in=20

India, in 1853, is said to have killed eighty-four persons and three thousa=
nd cattle. During a storm=20

at Naini Tal, in 1855, hailstones weighing one and one-half pounds fell. Ou=
r own land has had a=20

number of severe hail storms within the past ten years, that have done imme=
nse damage to crops,=20

and occasionally killed cattle, while smaller animals have perished by hund=
reds. Frequent are the=20

records of hailstones as large as oranges, goose-eggs, and occasionally as =
large as a fist, with=20

gathered drifts two or three feet deep. Europe has also had several of her =
smaller towns nearly=20

destroyed by combined flood and hail. Yet, none of these equal in fatality =
the great hail storm of=20

two years since at Moradabad, India.  It smashed in windows, glass doors an=
d the lighter roofs,=20

=E2=80=9CThe verandas were blown away by the wind. A great part of the roof=
 fell in, and the massive=20

pucca portico was blown down. The walls shook. It was nearly dark outside, =
and hailstones of=20

enormous size were dashed down with a force which I have never seen anythin=
g to equal. * * *=20

There were long ridges of hail one or two feet in depth. * * * Not a house =
in the civil station that did=20

not receive the most serious injury.  =E2=80=9CTwo hundred and thirty death=

of Parliament," the night before. It was a letter written by the fair spect=
ator in the gallery of the=20

court, who had also had an interview with Mr. Wheedle that morning.  The po=
sition she then=20

occupied in court had been selected for her by the prisoner's legal adviser=
. He had calculated with=20

tolerable precision where his lordship would sit, and he wished her to be w=
ithin the range of his=20

vision, without being too prominent to the disinterested spectator.  The pr=
isoner's attorney had, in=20

this consultation, explained to the counsel his stratagem, or intended _cou=
p de theatre_. The=20

learned sergeant and his learned junior considered the idea a good one, and=
 may be said to have=20

approved it; although, as they explained, it was no part of their professio=
nal duty to offer an=20

opinion upon it. When the consultation was ended, the counsel returned into=
 court, one taking his=20

seat and the other hanging listlessly on the railing of the counsels' boxes=
.  Mr. Wheedle was on=20

the staircase of the court, watching its two modes of egress, and awaiting =
the effect of present=20

time. The total number may be safely put as under two hundred and fifty. Me=
n caught in the open=20

and without shelter, were simply pounded to death by the hail.=E2=80=9D  Sp=
ain and southern France have=20

on record some showers of extremely large hailstones. In 1829, masses of ic=
e weighing four and=20

one-half pounds fell at Cazorta, Spain. Houses were stove-in by them. Durin=
g a hurricane in the=20

south of France, in 1844, there fell ice-masses weighing eleven pounds.  My=
sterious and ominous=20

to those ignorant of their cause have been the many showers of =E2=80=9Cink=
, blood, sulphur,=E2=80=9D falls of red or=20

green snow, and similar phenomena. Such things were believed to betoken the=
 wrath of God, and=20

to forebode war, famine, pestilence, flood, and other dire calamities. Of c=
ourse, the good people=20

knew exactly what any shower meant--after the calamity occurred. When it di=
dn=E2=80=99t occur, the=20

shower was simply a warning.  That such phenomena are readily explained goe=
s without saying;=20

and not a few of the wise of days past have refused to be seriously alarmed=

An usher received a three-cornered note from the hands of somebody, address=
ed to Lord H----,=20

with a small gold coin, and a request that he would put the half-sovereign =
in his own pocket, and=20

hand the note to his lordship unseen by her ladyship.  The note ran thus:  =
"_Gallery of the Old=20

Bailey_,  "_July 19th, 185-_.       "MY LORD,--For Heaven's sake, don't pro=
secute my brother, and=20

kill      your faithful                  CLARA!"    the philosophic minds o=
f other days endeavored to=20

explain these occurrences by supposing blood vaporized from battle-fields w=
as mingled with rain,=20

not knowing that the red portion of the blood can not evaporate.  The micro=
scope has solved these=20

mysteries. The rains of blood are merely stained by earthy matter: sometime=
s organic, gathered=20

by the wind; sometimes volcanic dust, thrown out by eruptions; and in one c=
ase, where numerous=20


_
His lordship cast his eyes to the gallery, and for the first time in that p=
lace he beheld the form and=20

features of a lady not unknown to him, but one he had very frequently met e=
lsewhere. Those eyes,=20

and the recognition of the writer, were too much for the nobleman's delicat=
e sensibilities. His face=20

became as pale as chalk. He and the priests asserted it was the work of the=
 devil, the spots at=20

length proved to be the excrement of butterflies. Rains of melted sulphur h=
ave been found to owe=20

their color to the yellow pollen of pine trees. Ink is merely sooty rain-wa=
ter. Showers of this=20

character are more frequent than might be supposed. More than a score=20


_

ter he had thrust the=20

missive unseen into one of his pockets.  This event caused what the reporte=
rs for the daily=20

journals described as "a painful sensation" in court. His lordship was remo=
ved in his carriage to his=20

residence in ---- Square, Belgravia, without uttering more than one sentenc=
e.  That sentence he so=20

uttered was an instruction to his solicitor to get the trial postponed.  Th=
e trial for perjury, after a=20

short interval, was proceeded with, and ended in the prisoner's acquittal. =
 Whereupon Mr.=20

Keeneye, as one of the counsel for the prosecution, rose after a conference=
 with his learned=20

brother retained for the defence, and, addressing his lordship, begged that=
, owing to the sudden=20

illness of the prosecutor, the trial of the prisoner might be postponed. Th=
e prisoner's counsel felt,=20

they said, some difficulty in resisting the application after what they had=
 seen, but added, that they=20

thought the prisoner, who had done nothing to Europe in the present century=
; and a number in this=20

country. Red and green snow owe their color to microscopic vegetable life, =
and are quite=20

commonly met with in the Arctic world. One bold headland has long been know=
n as Crimson Cliff,=20

from the extensive deposits of red snow there.     CHAPTER XIV.  FLOODS IN =

entitled to be liberated on bail. The judge, after glancing at the depositi=
ons, said he did not see=20

that the accused had any such claim, and declined to attach that condition =
to the adjournment of=20

the case, as prayed for by the prosecution.  Clara, who from the gallery be=
held all that had gone=20

on, and who devoured every word that had been uttered by the lawyers and th=
e bench with greedy=20

ears, maintained a wonderful show of self-possession, but was stirred by th=
e intensest and most=20

anxious thought. She left the court when this decision had been arrived at =
in her brother's case; he=20

being, indeed, quite unconscious up to this moment as to what had taken pla=
ce in his absence,=20

and, when it was explained to him, being left ignorant for the time of its =
cause.  Next session the=20

prisoner was again brought up for trial. His lordship attended--but not her=
 ladyship. She was=20

induced to remain at home by the solicitude of her husband, who apprehended=
 the effect upon her=20

of the fetid atmosphere of        Flowers its lean hands never snatched bef=
ore,      Will it snatch=20

these human flowers also,        Where they cling, sad creatures of the sho=
re?=E2=80=9D   Every country is=20

confronted with a serious problem in its great rivers. In some lands the on=
ly problem is, how to get=20

rid of flood-water as quickly as possible: in others, comes the additional =
question of securing=20

sufficient water for irrigation during the dry season. Egypt occupies an an=
omalous position, the=20

latter question being the only one of any practical interest. Without rains=
, she depends on the rise=20

of the Nile for her existence, and no one dreams of such a thing as endeavo=
ring to check the=20

overflow. During seed-time the fellaheen may be seen sometimes in mud knee-=
deep, busily=20

planting their fields; and in summer they may be seen hoisting water from t=
he stream and=20

emptying it into their irrigating ditches.  In our own land, we have hither=
to had no need of irrigation,=20

except in those districts where there is no fear of a=20


_
appointed for the trial resolutely bent upon securing to the prisoner the w=
eightiest punishment he=20

could get inflicted, he was now prepared to recommend the prisoner to mercy=
.  The evidence,=20

which in the briefs as originally delivered to counsel disclosed a complete=
 chain of proof, was=20

remodelled. They now contained a narrative which set forth the difficulties=
 of the theory for the=20

prosecution, and went far towards explaining away the points against the ac=
cused. The briefs for=20

the defence, which as originally delivered set forth no possible answer to =
the charge, now=20

contained a theory which reconciled the evidence as it stood, or was expect=
ed to stand, with a=20

possibility of the innocence of the accused.  A witness for the prosecution=
 did not answer to his=20

name when called; and the reader may be regions of our southwestern states.=
 In China, the=20

people are contending with both sides of the problem; and their success in =
the second feature has=20

not greatly surpassed their achievements in the first. In most other lands,=
 the flood problem is the=20

chief one. The Amazon at flood time rises from sixty to one hundred feet, a=
nd its volume is almost=20

inconceivable. But since the larger part of its course lies in an almost un=
inhabited region, the high=20

water gives no concern to the people. The Orinoco rises so high, and is in =
such a level region, that=20

during part of the year one of its upper tributaries flows backward and rea=
ches the Amazon.  The=20

great length of the Mississippi and Missouri present the gravest difficulti=
es. The sources of each lie=20

in regions where heavy snows fall during a considerable=20


_
jurisdiction of any English tribunal. The result was, that the prosecution =
broke down, and the culprit=20

was liberated.  The explanation of this miscarriage of justice is simple. P=
retty Clara was the=20

mistress of the noble lord. He had indeed seduced her some years before, an=
d she had been=20

living since then (unknown to his wife) under his lordship's protection. Sh=
e was the central portion=20

of the country--from western Pennsylvania to Colorado, Montana and central =
Dakota--must find=20

their way to the sea by way of the single stream. By reason of the differen=
ce in latitude and=20

altitude, the melted snows of the head-waters usually swell the lower river=
 in May and early in=20

June, after the spring rains are over. But it quite often happens=20


_
innocent of all participation in or knowledge of the robbery. For many year=
s she had not seen that=20

brother. They were orphans. They had both been thrown upon the world at a v=
ery early age to=20

earn their own bread. She, when not more than fourteen years of age, had be=
en placed in one of=20

the West-End millinery houses, and had won a promotion to weather sets in i=
n the mountains very=20

early: so that the great floods of the upper valleys reach the lower river =
just when extremely heavy=20

rains are prevalent in the central and southern regions. This forms a combi=
nation that is terrible to=20

combat, and is the cause of all the trouble. The present system is effectiv=
e in ordinary cases; but=20
