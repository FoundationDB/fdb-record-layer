truth, and it made her free, so she cried, "Wee wee!" And oratory had again=
 risen to its proper=20

place in our midst! At two o'clock she returned with the pumpkin pie slice =
from the tail of the brown=20

shirt, neatly, but hardly gaudily inserted into the rear waist line of the =
riding trousers, and we lay=20

down to pleasant dreams; for we found that by standing stiffly erect, by ke=
eping one's tunic pulled=20

down, and by carefully avoiding a stooping posture, it was possible to conc=
eal the facts of one's=20

double life. So we went forth with Major Murphy the next morning as care-fr=
ee as "Eden's garden=20

birds." We looked like birds, too--scarecrows!  [Illustration: Eight inches=
 short in one waistband is a=20

catastrophe]  Our business took us to the American Ambulance men who were w=
ith the French=20

army. Generally when they were at work they were quartered near a big base =
hospital; and their=20

work took them from the large hospital to the first aid stations near the f=
ront line trenches. Our way=20

from Paris to these men led across the devastated area of France. As the ch=
ief activity of the=20

French at the time of our visit was in the Verdun sector, we spent most of =
our first week at the front=20

near Verdun. And one evening at twilight we walked through the ruined city.=
 The Germans had just=20

finished their evening strafe; two hundred big shells had been thrown over =
from their field guns=20

into the ruins. After the two hundredth shell had dropped it was as safe in=
 Verdun as in Emporia=20

until the next day. For the Germans are methodical in all things, and they =
spend just so many=20

shells on each enemy point, and no more. The German work of destruction is =
thorough in Verdun.=20

Not a roof remains intact upon its walls; not a wall remains uncracked; not=
 a soul lives in the town;=20

now and then a sentinel may be met patrolling the wagon road that winds thr=
ough the streets. This=20

wagon road, by the way, is the object of the German artillery's attention. =
Upon this road they there=20

is to the west, in the Sonoro, at Choco, and at Barbacoas? I am far from wi=
shing to exaggerate the=20

riches of this soil; but I do not think myself authorized to deny the exist=
ence of precious metals in=20

the primitive mountains of Guiana, merely because in our journey through th=
at country we saw no=20

metallic veins. It is somewhat remarkable that the natives of the Orinoco h=
ave a name in their=20

languages for gold (carucuru in Caribbee, caricuri in Tamanac, cavitta in M=
aypure), while the word=20

they use to denote silver, prata, is manifestly borrowed from the Spanish.*=
 (* The Parecas say,=20

instead of prata, rata. It is the Castilian word plata ill-pronounced. Near=
 the Yurubesh there is=20

another inconsiderable tributary stream of the Rio Negro, the Curicur-iari.=
 It is easy to recognize in=20

this name the Caribbee word carucur, gold. The Caribs extended their incurs=
ions from the mouth=20

of the Orinoco south-west toward the Rio Negro; and it was this restless pe=
ople who carried the=20

fable of El Dorado, by the same way, but in an opposite direction (from sou=
th-west to north-east),=20

from the Mesopotamia between the Rio Negro and the Jupura to the sources of=
 the Rio Branco.)=20

The notions collected by Acunha, Father Fritz, and La Condamine, on the gol=
d-washings south=20

and north of the river Uaupe, agree with what I learnt of the auriferous so=
il of those countries.=20

However great we may suppose the communications that took place between the=
 nations of the=20

Orinoco before the arrival of Europeans, they certainly did not draw their =
gold from the eastern=20

declivity of the Cordilleras. This declivity is poor in mines, particularly=
 in mines anciently worked; it=20

is almost entirely composed of volcanic rocks in the provinces of Popayan, =
Pasto, and Quito. The=20

gold of Guiana probably came from the country east of the Andes. In our day=
s a lump of gold has=20

been found in a ravine near the mission of Encaramada, and we must not be s=
urprised if, since=20

Europeans=20


_
sentinels come and go. The only living inhabitants we saw in the place were=
 two black cats. It=20

must have been a beautiful city before the war--a town of sixty thousand an=
d more. It contained=20

some old and interesting Gothic ecclesiastical buildings--a cloister, a bis=
hop's residence, a school-

-or what not--that, even crumbled and shattered by the shells, still show i=
n ruins grace and charm=20

and dignity. And battered as these mute stones were, it seemed marvellous t=
hat mere stone could=20

translate so delicately the highest groping of men's hearts toward God, the=
ir most unutterable=20

longing. And the broken stones of the Gothic ruin, in the freshness and raw=
ness of their ruin,=20

seemed to be bleeding out human aspiration, spilling it footlessly upon the=
 dead earth. And of=20

course all about these ecclesiastical ruins were the ruins of homes, and sh=
ops and stores--places=20

just as pitifully appealing in their appalling wreck--where men had lived a=
nd loved and striven and=20

failed and risen again and gone on slowly climbing through in these wild sp=
ots, we hear less of the=20

plates of gold, gold-dust, and amulets of jade-stone, which could heretofor=
e be obtained from the=20

Caribs and other wandering nations by barter. The precious metals, never ve=
ry abundant on the=20

banks of the Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and the Amazon, disappeared almost ent=
irely when the=20

system of the missions caused the distant communications between the native=
s to cease.  The=20

banks of the Upper Guainia in general abound much less in fishing-birds tha=
n those of=20

Cassiquiare, the Meta, and the Arauca, where ornithologists would find suff=
icient to enrich=20

immensely the collections of Europe. This scarcity of animals arises, no do=
ubt, from the want of=20

shoals and flat shores, as well as from the quality of the black waters, wh=
ich (on account of their=20

very purity) furnish less aliment to aquatic insects and fish. However, the=
 Indians of these=20

countries, during two periods of the year, feed on birds of passage, which =
repose in their long=20

migrations on the waters of the Rio Negro. When the=20
