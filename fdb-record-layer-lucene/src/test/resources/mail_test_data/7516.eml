for opportunity, benevolent southerners, who saw themselves hindered in car=
rying out their plan=20

for educating the blacks for citizenship, disposed of their holdings and fo=
rmed free colonies of their=20

slaves in the same section. White men of this type thus made possible a new=
 era of uplift for the=20

colored race by coming north in time to aid the abolitionists, who had for =
years constituted a small=20

minority advocating a seemingly hopeless cause.  A detailed description of =
these settlements has=20

no place in this dissertation save as it has a bearing on the development o=
f education among the=20

colored people. These settlements, however, are important here in that they=
 furnish the key to the=20

location of many of the early colored churches and schools of the North and=
 West. Philanthropists=20

established a number of Negroes near Sandy Lake in Northwestern Pennsylvani=
a.[1] There was a=20

colored settlement near Berlin Crossroads, Ohio.[2] Another group of pionee=
ring Negroes=20

emigrating to this State found homes in the Van Buren township of Shelby Co=
unty. Edward Coles,=20

a Virginian, who in 1818 emigrated to Illinois, of which he later became Go=
vernor, made a=20

settlement on a larger scale. He brought his slaves to Edwardsville, where =
they constituted a=20

community known as "Coles' Negroes."[3] The settlement made by Samuel Gist,=
 an Englishman=20

possessing extensive plantations in Hanover, Amherst, and Henrico Counties,=
 Virginia, was still=20

more significant. He provided in his will that his slaves should be freed a=
nd sent to the North. It=20

was further directed "that the revenue from his plantation the last year of=
 his life be applied in=20

building schoolhouses and churches for their accommodation," and "that all =
money coming to him=20

in Virginia be set aside for the employment of ministers and teachers to in=
struct them."[4] In 1818,=20

of the noblest of Russian names, no answering chord resounded in his heart.=
 The revelation, that=20

ought to have moved him so deeply, failed of its due effect, because his ig=
norance did not supply=20

the background that was needed to throw it into relief. He had always known=
 that he was=20

something other, something greater than those around him; but beyond that h=
e had no power of=20

measuring social distances. Princes, boyars, all who were not mujiks, were =
alike to him; just as it=20

seemed to him nearly the same thing to go to the Moscow road, to Moscow its=
elf, or even to St.=20

Petersburg. Therefore, after spending a little vague, half-comprehending wo=
nder upon the=20

starost=E2=80=99s story, his mind reverted, as days went on, to what was at=
 this period his ruling idea--the=20

hope of rivalling and surpassing Michael in some deed of daring, and conseq=
uently in the regard=20

of Anna Popovna.  It was not for his advantage that his kindly foster-paren=
ts never exacted from=20

him any of the labours that fell to the lot of the little mujiks, his playf=
ellows. =E2=80=9CPrepare to die, mujik,=20

but till the soil,=E2=80=9D says the Russian proverb; and certainly where t=
here is no other education an early=20

apprenticeship to manual toil is rather a blessing than otherwise. Ivan=E2=
=80=99s idle hands and restless=20

feet were left quite at liberty to obey all the suggestions of his active, =
untaught mind; while his=20

naturally brave disposition was rendered still more fearless from the fact =
of his never having been,=20

upon any occasion, punished or even thwarted or reproved.  One summer morni=
ng, just as the first=20

faint streaks of dawn began to brighten the cottage window, he rose softly =
from his sleeping-place=20

on the shelf above the stove. All the rest had worked hard the day before, =
and were slumbering=20

soundly now; so he dressed himself quietly, and going to the great carved c=

Augustus Wattles, a native of Connecticut, made a settlement of Negroes in =
Mercer County early=20

in the nineteenth century.[1] About the year 1834 many of the freedmen, the=
n and took out and put=20

on his rough sheep-skin coat, or shuba; then he drew on his warm boots of R=
ussia leather lined=20

with fur; next, he cut for himself with a hatchet a great piece of sour bla=
ck bread, and tied it in a=20

cloth as provision for the way; lastly, he went to a secret hiding-place of=
 his own and transferred to=20

his pocket his greatest treasure--a silver rouble mativshka had given him. =
Having done all this, he=20

was hurrying forth with quick noiseless footsteps, when he remembered an om=
itted duty.=20

Returning a step or two, he took his stand before the picture in the corner=
, made a reverence, and=20

repeated a hasty prayer; then, with a brave heart and a quiet conscience, h=
e went forth in search=20

of what fate might bring=20


_
induced to take up 30,000 acres of land in the same vicinity.[2] John Harpe=
r of North Carolina=20

manumitted his slaves in 1850 and had them sent to this community.[3] John =
Randolph of=20

Roanoke freed his slaves at his death, and provided for the purchase of far=
ms for them in Mercer=20

County.[4] The Germans, however, would not allow them to take possession of=
 these lands.=20

Driven later from Shelby County[5] also, these freedmen finally found homes=
 in Miami County.[7]=20

Then there was one Saunders, a slaveholder of Cabell County, now West Virgi=
nia, who liberated=20

his slaves and furnished them homes in free territory. They finally made th=
eir way to Cass County,=20

Michigan, where philanthropists had established a prosperous colored settle=
ment and supplied it=20

with missionaries and teachers. The slaves of Theodoric H. Gregg of Dinwidd=
ie County, Virginia,=20

were liberated in going to look for adventures.  He passed through the slee=
ping village, with the=20

familiar brown cottages on either side of him looking peaceful and homelike=
 in the morning twilight.=20

The church-bell in the tall elm-tree seemed to beckon him near; he could sc=
arcely resist the=20

temptation of climbing the tree, seizing the rope, and astonishing the vill=
age with an untimely peal.=20

Only the reflection that this would inevitably bring his own adventure to a=
n abrupt conclusion=20

stayed his hand. Leaving the houses behind him, he passed through fields ri=
ch with waving corn,=20

then through pasture-lands, from which he emerged at length upon a bare, mo=
notonous, sandy=20

plain. Now, for the first time, he ventured to beguile his way with a song;=
 and his clear, ringing,=20

childish voice sounded far and wide, yet failed to reach any human ear. Nor=
 would it have fared=20

otherwise=20
