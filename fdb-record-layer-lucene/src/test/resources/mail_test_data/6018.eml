, and _
"Yes. And beyond the Andes (which in Peru consist of great chains of mounta=
ins, some very high,=20

interspersed with table lands, rich plains and valleys) there is the montan=
a region of tropical=20

forests, running down to the valley of the Amazon.  "That sounds interestin=
g," commented Mr.=20

Damon.  "It is interesting," declared Mr. Titus. "For it is from this tropi=
cal region that your quinine=20

comes, Mr. Damon, though you may not have to go there to straighten out you=
r affairs. I think you=20

can do better bargaining with the officials in Lima, or near there."  "Are =
there any wild animals in=20

Peru?" Tom inquired.  "Well, not many. Of course there are the llamas and a=
lpacas, which are the=20

beasts of burden--almost like little camels you might say, though much more=
 gentle. Then there is=20

the wild vicuna, the fleece of which is made into a sort of wool, after whi=
ch a certain kind of cloth is=20

named.  "Then there is the taruco, a both emigrants from France.  At an ear=
ly age they had been=20

thrilled by the tales of life and adventure in the distant wilderness acros=
s the sea.  They were=20

hardy and enterprising, well fitted for the arduous life-work which was bef=
ore them.  From a=20

western tribe of Indians called the Assiniboines, Radisson and Groseilliers=
 first heard of the=20

character and extent of the great inland sea to the north, which had long b=
efore been named by=20

the English marine explorers Hudson's Bay.  Not only did they glean a descr=
iption of the inland=20

sea, but they also succeeded, while on their wanderings, in obtaining infor=
mation how they might=20

reach it, not as the English might do by sea, but overland.  In August 1660=
 the two adventurers=20

found their way back to Montreal after over a year's absence.  They were ac=
companied by 300=20

Indians and 60 canoes, laden with furs, out of which they made a handsome p=
rofit.  But they had=20

to reckon=20


_
rat, the otoc, a sort of wild dog, or fox, and the ucumari, a black bear wi=
th a white nose. This bear=20

is often found on lofty mountain tops, but only when driven there in search=
 of food.  "The condors,=20

of course, are big birds of prey in the Andes. You must have read about the=
m; how they seem to=20

lie in the upper regions of the air, motionless, until suddenly they catch =
sight of some dead animal=20

far down below when they sweep toward it with the swiftness of the wink. Th=
ere is another bird of=20

the vulture variety, with wings of black and white feathers. The ancient In=
cas used to decorate=20

their head dresses with these wing feathers."  "Well, I'm glad I'm going to=
 Peru," said Tom. "I never=20

knew it was such an interesting country. But I don't suppose we'll have tim=
e to see much of it."=20

"Oh, I think you will," commented Mr. Titus. "We don't always have to work =
on the proprietors of=20

Quebec, who sought to restrict them from adventuring into any new fields, a=
nd so many obstacles=20

did the pair meet with, that in order to carry out their scheme and establi=
sh trading posts on=20

Hudson's Bay they gave up their overland scheme and decided to throw in the=
ir lot with the=20

English.  They crossed over the ocean and had an interview with King Charle=
s's cousin, the=20

gallant {105} Prince Rupert, and the result was all their hearts could wish=
 for.  Money for the=20

enterprise was found, and an English association founded under charter from=
 the King, which took=20

the title of the Merchants and Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's=
 Bay, but better known=20

to us as the Hudson's Bay Company.  On a June morning 1668 the _Nonsuch_, a=
 ketch of only=20

fifty tons' burden, left the Thames for Hudson's Bay.  At the end of Septem=
ber it passed safely=20

through=20


_
our Indian workers take off, and we can do nothing without them. I'll see t=
hat you have a chance to=20

do some exploring if you wish."  "Good!" exclaimed Tom. "I brought my elect=
ric rifle with me, and I=20

may get a chance to pop over one of those bears with a white nose. Are they=
 good to eat?"  "The=20

Indians eat them, I believe, when they can get them, but I wouldn't fancy t=
he meat," said the=20

contractor.  Luncheon over, the three travelers departed with their baggage=
 for the Chicago=20

Limited, which left from the Pennsylvania Station at Twenty-third Street. A=
s usual, Koku attracted=20

much attention because of his size.  The trip to San Francisco was without =
incident worth narrating=20

and in due time our friends reached the Golden Gate ashore in Rupert's Rive=
r to begin the=20

construction of a fort and dwellings, called after King Charles.  It was ma=
de of logs, in the fashion=20

of those made by the Jesuits and traders in Canada.  As some protection fro=
m sudden attack it=20

was enclosed by a stockade.  This, at Rupert's River, was the first of the =
forts and stations of the=20

Hudson's Bay Company.  After a time other forts and "factories," as they we=
re called, began to dot=20

the shores of the bay.  Radisson and Groseilliers did not continue very con=
stant in their allegiance;=20

sometimes they were English, sometimes they were French. They were rough-an=
d-ready=20

adventurers both; and it all depended whose purse was largest to command th=
eir services.=20

Radisson, however, ended=20
