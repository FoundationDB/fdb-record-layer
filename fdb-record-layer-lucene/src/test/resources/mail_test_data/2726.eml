"No."  "Thank God!"    CHAPTER XVIII  The next morning at eleven o'clock sh=
e met Dwight in his=20

studio, and in a brisk pleasant businesslike way she began to tell him of h=
er voice--what singing=20

she had done at home and how she had always meant to take lessons when she =
should come to=20

New York to live.  "To find out how much of a voice I really have, you know=
," she said. Her manner=20

was more affable now. "But my husband and my baby have kept me rather busy,=
 you see, and so=20

I've composed of representatives selected as provided in the act, each of w=
hom must be a=20

arned of you--from my=20

husband's partner."  "You're Joe Lanier's wife, aren't you?" he asked.  "Hi=
s second," she said with=20

emphasis. And a moment later she told herself, "Yes, his eyes do twinkle, a=
nd he seems to be=20

quite nice. He isn't so excessively fat, and he has a big wide generous mou=
th, and I like his eyes.=20

But he thinks my coming like this a bit queer, and he's wondering what's be=
hind it." She downed=20

her excitement and went on in the same resolute tone she had used with such=
 success on Nourse.=20

No personal conversation just yet, she would show him she meant business. A=
nd so she stuck to=20

the lessons.  "If you'll take me as a pupil," she said, "I'd like to begin =
immediately."  "Let me try=20

your voice," he proposed. He went to the piano, and there his manner had so=
on changed. From=20

genial and curious it grew interested. He spoke rather sharply, asking her =
to do this and that, and=20

terests me a lot." She=20

beamed on him.  "You'll take me, then?"  "Assuredly."  "Oh, that's so nice.=
" They decided on the=20

time for her lessons. Then she glanced at her wrist watch. "Will you see if=
 my car is waiting!" she=20

asked. "I had him take the nurse and baby up to the Park--and he ought to b=

think." But as Dwight went to the telephone, she added excitedly to herself=
, "Now if that idiot of a=20

chauffeur is as late as I told him to be, you and I will have quite a talk,=
 Mr. Dwight."  "It isn't here=20

"If you like," he replied good-humouredly. "But I'd much rather you'd wait =
