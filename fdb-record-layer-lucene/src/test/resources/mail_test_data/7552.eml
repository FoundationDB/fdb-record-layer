philodendron monstera  "So could I," volunteered Fred. "How about you, Midge?"  "Count me in. While we're clearing away the trash, we might find some things we could use for knight's armor.

"Maybe that place has a ghost!" Midge suggested with a laugh. "Let's go over and find out!"  "I 

thought we came out here for roofing discs," Brad reminded him. "If we start off on a wild goose 

chase--"  "A ghost chase," Midge corrected. "Oh, the house can wait. But it does look interesting. 

After we get the discs, let's find out if anyone lives there."  "Fair enough," Brad agreed. "If we don't 

start moving, we won't even get our discs for armor. It will be turning dark before long."  Made 

aware that the sun fast was lowering, the Cubs walked briskly on to the cleared area where four 

new houses had been built. All were boarded up for their interiors had not been completed. None 

were occupied.  "Now you're certain it's all right to take the discs?" Mr. Hatfield asked Brad 

doubtfully. "We don't want to get into any trouble."  "The contractor said I could have them all. I 

only took enough for my own suit of armor."  "In that case, go to it, boys," Mr. Hatfield said. "While 

you're gathering discs, I'll look at the houses."  The discs were scattered over a large area, half 

buried in the moist earth.  Brad helped Babe, who was less agile than his companions. With six 

boys and a scarcity of metal discs it became a race to see who would get enough for a suit of 

armor.  "If we come out short, maybe we can buy a few at a roofing supply place," Dan 

commented. "Here's another!"  In reaching to pick it up from amid a pile of boards and broken 

brick, he noticed that the cellar door of one of the houses stood slightly ajar.  "Say, fellows!" he 

exclaimed. "This house is unlocked!"  "Then we can go through it!" shouted Chips, hurrying over. 

"Hold on!" Brad stopped him. "These houses are supposed to be locked. I had permission to take 

discs--not to lead a mob through any of the buildings."  "Oh, it won't hurt just to peek inside," Chips 

protested.  Before Brad could stop him, the boy shoved open the door.  "Chips!" Brad shouted 

furiously.  But the boy needed no additional warning. Already he had been effectively halted.  As 

the door swung outward, a figure loomed up before him.  Chips was so astonished at seeing 

anyone in the house, he could only stare. The man was stoutish and wore soiled, wrinkled clothes. 

A stubble of beard gave his face a shadowy appearance.  More than anything else, Chips was 

made aware of the dark eyes which seemed to bore directly into him.  "I--I beg your pardon," he 

mumbled, gathering his wits. "I--I didn't know anyone was in the house."  "Who are you?" the man 

demanded harshly.  "A Cub Scout. We're all Cubs." Chips was grateful that the other boys were 

behind him, gathering closer. "We're here picking up roof discs."  "Well, beat it!" the man said 

curtly. "You have no business on the property. Get moving!"  Before Chips or the other Cubs could 

make any reply, he slammed the basement door in their faces.                                    CHAPTER 9 

A "Deserted" House   "Well, how do you like that?" Dan muttered as the Cubs gathered in a group 

near the newly constructed house.  "Who was he, Brad?" Midge asked the Den Chief. "Not the 

contractor?"  "No, I never saw this fellow before--although his voice sounded sort of familiar." 

"Maybe he's one of the workmen," Red said uneasily. "After all, we are on private property."  "I had 

permission to come here for those discs," Brad insisted. "Furthermore, I don't believe that fellow 

was a workman. He didn't talk like one."  "Or look like it either," added Chips. Of all the Cubs, he 

was the only one who had obtained a clear view of the man.  "You didn't know him, did you?" Dan 

inquired.  Chips shook his head. "Never set eyes on him before. You know what I think? He's a 

tramp!"  "Say, he did look like one!" Babe cried, although he had been too far back to catch more 

than a glimpse of the shadowy figure.  "And I bet a cookie he has no business being in this 

house!" Chips went on excitedly. "The nerve of him ordering us away! Why, he may have broken 

and brown ones won't hurt you; they're bull-snakes and help to keep the gophers down. Don't be 



scared if you see anything look out of that hole in the bank over there. That's a badger hole. He's 

about as big as a big 'possum, and his face is striped, black and white. He takes a chicken once in 

a while, but I won't let the men harm him. In a new country a body feels friendly to the animals. I 

like to have him come out and watch me when I'm at work."  Grandmother swung the bag of 

potatoes over her shoulder and went down the path, leaning forward a little. The road followed the 

windings of the draw; when she came to the first bend she waved at me and disappeared. I was 

left alone with this new feeling of lightness and content.  I sat down in the middle of the garden, 

where snakes could scarcely approach unseen, and leaned my back against a warm yellow 

pumpkin. There were some ground-cherry bushes growing along the furrows, full of fruit. I turned 

back the papery triangular sheaths that protected the berries and ate a few. All about me giant 

grasshoppers, twice as big as any I had ever seen, were doing acrobatic feats among the dried 

vines. The gophers scurried up and down the ploughed ground. There in the sheltered draw-

bottom the wind did not blow very hard, but I could hear it singing its humming tune up on the 

level, and I could see the tall grasses wave. The earth was warm under me, and warm as I 

crumbled it through my fingers. Queer little red bugs came out and moved in slow squadrons 

around me. Their backs were polished vermilion, with black spots. I kept as still as I could. Nothing 

happened. I did not expect anything to happen. I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, 

like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel 

like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or 

goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete 

and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.     III   ON Sunday morning Otto 

Fuchs was to drive us over to make the acquaintance of our new Bohemian neighbors. We were 

taking them some provisions, as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no garden 

or chicken-house, and very little broken land. Fuchs brought up a sack of potatoes and a piece of 

cured pork from the cellar, and grandmother packed some loaves of Saturday's bread, a jar of 

butter, and several pumpkin pies in the straw of the wagon-box. We clambered up to the front seat 

and jolted off past the little pond and along the road that climbed to the big cornfield.  I could 

hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield; but there was only red grass like ours, and 

nothing else, though from the high wagon-seat one could look off a long way. The road ran about 

like a wild thing, avoiding the deep draws, crossing them where they were wide and shallow. And 

all along it, wherever it looped or ran, the sunflowers grew; some of them were as big as little 

trees, with great rough leaves and many branches which bore dozens of blossoms. They made a 

gold ribbon across the prairie. Occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant 

full of blossoms, and walk along munching it, the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate 

down toward them.  The Bohemian family, grandmother told me as we drove along, had bought 

the homestead of a fellow-countryman, Peter Krajiek, and had paid him more than it was worth. 

Their agreement with him was made before they left the old country, through a cousin of his, who 

was also a relative of Mrs. Shimerda. The Shimerdas were the first Bohemian family to come to 

this part of the county. Krajiek was their only interpreter, and could tell them anything he chose. 

They could not speak enough English to ask for advice, or even to make their most pressing wants 

known. One son, Fuchs said, was well-grown, and strong enough to work the land; 


_
in and be living there!"  "Without the contractor or the owner knowing anything about it," agreed 

Dan soberly. "Say, we ought to tell Mr. Hatfield about this."  At that moment, the Cub leader joined 

the group. He had been too far away to see the stranger or to hear any of the conversation. 

However, from the excited comment of the boys, he knew something was amiss.  "What goes on?" 

he asked, hurrying up.  Brad told him what had happened.  "I'm certain the man isn't a workman," 

he added. "We think he must be a tramp who broke into the house and is camping there."  Mr. 

Hatfield noted a nearby sign which bore the name and telephone number of the contractor who 

had built the dwellings.  "I'll telephone him as soon as we get back to Webster City," he 

announced. "These houses are supposed to be boarded up. We have no authority to order 

anyone away, so we'll just clear out."  The Cubs knew that their leader's advice was sound. 

However, they disliked to be driven away from the premises.  "Gather up your discs, fellows, and 

let's move," Brad told the Cubs. "It's getting late anyhow."  In the act of tying his plunder into a 

knapsack made from his sweater, Dan glanced toward the basement window of the new house. 

"Look, Brad!" he commanded. "That guy's standing there watching us!"  "I don't like it," the older 

boy muttered. "Mr. Hatfield's right. This is no place for us."  "We ought to be a match for him." 

"That's not the point," Brad argued. "For all we may know, he might be a criminal--armed. He looks 

like a tough customer."  "Face is sort of familiar too," Dan said thoughtfully. "Where have I seen 

him before?"  "Nowhere that I recall."  "I've seen him some place," Dan insisted, "or at least he's 

someone that reminds me of--I got it!"  "You've got what?" Brad demanded.  "I know where we 

saw that fellow!"  "We?"  "Sure! Don't you recall that night of the rain storm--on our way to the 

church?"  "The stranger who asked us what was going on there!"  "That's the guy!"  Brad glanced 

quickly toward the window. The man however, had stepped back beyond view.  "He reminds me a 

little of that fellow, Dan," the Den Chief said thoughtfully. "All the same, I wouldn't say it's the same 

person."  "Well, they look alike," Dan insisted. "I didn't care much for the fellow's appearance when 

we met him in the rain."  "Coming boys?" called Mr. Hatfield.  Dismissing the stranger from their 

minds, Brad and Dan hastened to catch up with the other Cubs.  As they hiked toward the main 

road, Mr. Hatfield mentioned again that he would call the contractor as soon as he arrived at 

home.  "I want to tell him that we picked up the roofing discs," he said. "I'm sure it's all right, but 

we'll double check. Then I'll tell him about that tramp in the house."  "He could do considerable 

damage," Red remarked. "Why, he might even start a fire that would destroy the house."  "Say! 

We haven't forgotten about exploring the haunted house, have we?" Chips suddenly demanded. 

From the main road a weed-choked, narrow lane led toward the unpainted house which stood on a 

curving rise of land. Shutters hung at rakish angles and the place had every appearance of being 

deserted.  "Do we have time?" Mr. Hatfield asked, looking at his watch.  "Oh, it won't take more 

than a minute!" Chips insisted.  "Sometimes your minutes are pretty long, Chips," the Cub leader 

laughed.  The other boys also were eager to inspect the old house, so finally Mr. Hatfield 

consented.  "This would be a spooky place at night," Midge declared as they started up the lane. 

"I'd hate to live so near the marsh. Imagine building new houses out here."  "Land is cheap in this 

area," Mr. Hatfield explained. "Then, Webster City is growing to the south. In a few years, this 

section may be built up solidly."  The land near the old house was ragged with frosted stubble 

growth. Some distance away ran a tiny creek, screened by reeds and rushes.  "Must be good 

hunting and fishing around here," Brad remarked.  Walking over broken, uneven ground the Cubs 



approached the dilapidated house. Its windows, streaked with dirt from the recent rain, seem to 

stare at them.  "Wonder how long this place has been deserted?" Dan speculated.  "Not long, 

that's certain," replied Mr. Hatfield, glancing about the untidy yard. "In fact, I wonder--"  "Oh, look 

at the old fashioned iron kettle!" Chips broke in without giving the Cub leader an opportunity to 

complete his remark. "And the old well that turns on a crank."  "It's not the well that turns on a 

crank, bright boy!" Red laughed.  "Well, you know what I mean," Chips growled. "That's how the 

bucket is lifted. Let's have a drink."  "Better not," advised Mr. Hatfield. "This water may be safe 

enough, but we have no way of being sure."  The Cubs raised and lowered the well bucket several 

times, but did not drink. Dan went over to look at the big iron kettle which in days past evidently 

had been used for the boiling of apple sauce or maple sirup.  To his surprise, he noted that the 

ashes beneath the blackened container were faintly warm.  "Say, maybe this place isn't deserted 

after all!" he exclaimed in alarm. "Someone's been using this kettle recently."  Babe Bunning, 

unmindful of Dan's discovery, had pulled a box to a position beneath the kitchen window. 

Flattening his nose against the pane, he peered inside.  "And someone's been using this house!" 

the boy entoned. "In fact, she's right here NOW!"                                    CHAPTER 10 

Widow Jones   In confusion, Babe backed away from the kitchen window.  The other Cubs also 

were embarrassed, for they had not intended to investigate an occupied dwelling.  "Gee whiz!" 

Babe muttered. "Here she comes! I'll bet she's sore!"  The kitchen door creaked open and the 

mysterious "she" stood on the threshold regarding the boys with curiosity rather than anger.  Tall 

and wiry, the woman appeared to be about fifty years of age. Her iron-gray hair was combed 

severely back from her ears. The gingham dress she wore was old fashioned and faded from 

repeated washing.  "I--I'm sorry," Babe stammered, doffing his cap. "I--I didn't know anyone lived 

here. The house looked so old and--"  "We were just passing and stopped to look at the deep 

well," Brad interposed hastily. "One doesn't see one like it very often."  "Or a house as run down 

as this," said the woman.  Plainly she had not taken offense at Babe's remark, for she smiled and 

said: "You boys must be on a hike."  Mr. Hatfield told her about the organization and introduced 

the boys by name. In turn, the woman said she was Mrs. Jones, a widow, and that she lived alone. 

"If you're Mrs. Jones, you must be the one Mr. Wentworth mentioned!" Dan exclaimed, recalling 

the name. "Do you board wards of the court?"  "I was supposed to take one--a harum-scarum lad 

who has a tendency to run away," Mrs. Jones replied. "The Court promised me eight dollars a 

week to look after him. I need the money. But he never showed up."  "That's because he ran away 

again," Dan informed the widow. "Police still are looking for him."  "Like as not he wouldn't want to 

stay here anyway," Mrs. Jones said, her gaze sweeping the untidy yard. "There's so much to be 

done, and no one to do it except me."  "I should think a sturdy boy would be a help to you here," 

remarked Mr. Hatfield. "And an outdoor life might be just what Jack needs. With a woods was old 

and frail and knew nothing about farming. He was a weaver by trade; had been a skilled workman 

on tapestries and upholstery materials. He had brought his fiddle with him, which would n't be of 

much use here, though he used to pick up money by it at home.  "If they're nice people, I hate to 

think of them spending the winter in that cave of Krajiek's," said grandmother. "It's no better than a 

badger hole; no proper dugout at all. And I hear he's made them pay twenty dollars for his old 

cookstove that ain't worth ten."  "Yes'm," said Otto; "and he's sold 'em his oxen and his two bony 

old horses for the price of good work-teams. I'd have interfered about the horses--the old man can 



understand some German--if I'd 'a' thought it would do any good. But Bohemians has a natural 

distrust of Austrians."  Grandmother looked interested. "Now, why is that, Otto?"  Fuchs wrinkled 

his brow and nose. "Well, ma'm, it's politics. It would take me a long while to explain."  The land 

was growing rougher; I was told that we were approaching Squaw Creek, which cut up the west 

half of the Shimerdas' place and made the land of little value for farming. Soon we could see the 

broken, grassy clay cliffs which indicated the windings of the stream, and the glittering tops of the 

cottonwoods and ash trees that grew down in the ravine. Some of the cottonwoods had already 

turned, and the yellow leaves and shining white bark made them look like the gold and silver trees 

in fairy tales.  As we approached the Shimerdas' dwelling, I could still see nothing but rough red 

hillocks, and draws with shelving banks and long roots hanging out where the earth had crumbled 

away. Presently, against one of those banks, I saw a sort of shed, thatched with the same wine-

colored grass that grew everywhere. Near it tilted a shattered windmill-frame, that had no wheel. 

We drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses, and then I saw a door and window sunk deep in the 

draw-bank. The door stood open, and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us 

hopefully. A little girl trailed along behind them. The woman had on her head the same 

embroidered shawl with silk fringes that she wore when she had alighted from the train at Black 

Hawk. She was not old, but she was certainly not young. Her face was alert and lively, with a 

sharp chin and shrewd little eyes. She shook grandmother's hand energetically.  "Very glad, very 

glad!" she ejaculated. Immediately she pointed to the bank out of which she had emerged and 

said, "House no good, house no good!"  Grandmother nodded consolingly. "You'll get fixed up 

comfortable after while, Mrs. Shimerda; make good house."  My grandmother always spoke in a 

very loud tone to foreigners, as if they were deaf. She made Mrs. Shimerda understand the 

friendly intention of our visit, and the Bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even 

smelled them, and examined the pies with lively curiosity, exclaiming, "Much good, much thank!"--

and again she wrung grandmother's hand.  The oldest son, Ambroz,--they called it Ambrosch,--

came out of the cave and stood beside his mother. He was nineteen years old, short and broad-

backed, with a close-cropped, flat head, and a wide, flat face. His hazel eyes were little and 

shrewd, like his mother's, but more sly and suspicious; they fairly snapped at the food. The family 

had been living on corncakes and sorghum molasses for three days.  The little girl was pretty, but 

An-tonia-- they accented the name thus, strongly, when they spoke to her--was still prettier. I 

remembered what the conductor had said about her eyes. They were big and warm and full of 

light, like the sun shining on brown pools in the wood. Her skin was brown, too, and in her cheeks 

she had a glow of rich, dark color. Her brown hair was curly and wild-looking. The little sister, 

whom they called Yulka (Julka), was fair, and seemed mild and obedient. While I stood awkwardly 

confronting the two girls, Krajiek came up from the barn to see what was going on. With him was 

another Shimerda son. Even from a distance one could see that there was something strange 

about this boy. As he approached us, he began to make uncouth noises, and held up his hands to 

show us his fingers, which were webbed to the first knuckle, like a duck's foot. When he saw me 

draw back, he began to crow delightedly, "Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo!" like a rooster. His mother 

scowled and said sternly, "Marek!" then spoke rapidly to Krajiek in Bohemian.  "She wants me to 

tell you he won't hurt nobody, Mrs. Burden. He was born like that. The others are smart. 

Ambrosch, he make good farmer." He struck Ambrosch on the back, and the boy smiled 



knowingly.  At that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank. He wore no hat, and his 

thick, iron-gray hair was brushed straight back from his forehead. It was so long that it bushed out 

behind his ears, and made him look like the old portraits I remembered in Virginia. He was tall and 

slender, and his thin shoulders stooped. He looked at us understandingly, then took grandmother's 

hand and bent over it. I noticed how white and well-shaped his own hands were. They looked 

calm, somehow, and skilled. His eyes were melancholy, and were set back deep under his brow. 

His face was ruggedly formed, but it looked like ashes--like something from which all the warmth 

and light had died out. Everything about this old man was in keeping with his dignified manner. He 

was neatly dressed. Under his coat he wore a knitted gray vest, and, instead of a collar, a silk 

scarf of a dark bronze-green, carefully crossed and held together by a red coral pin. While Krajiek 

was translating for Mr. Shimerda, Antonia came up to me and held out her hand coaxingly. In a 

moment we were running up the steep drawside together, Yulka trotting after us.  When we 

reached the level and could see the gold tree-tops, I pointed toward them, and Antonia laughed 

and squeezed my hand as if to tell me how glad she was I had come. We raced off toward Squaw 

Creek and did not stop until the ground itself stopped--fell away before us so abruptly that the next 

step would have been out into the tree-tops. We stood panting on the edge of the ravine, looking 

down at the trees and bushes that grew below us. The wind was so strong that I had to hold my 

hat on, and the girls' skirts were blown out before them. Antonia seemed to like it; she held her 

little sister by the hand and chattered away in that language which seemed to me spoken so much 

more rapidly than mine. She looked at me, her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say. 

"Name? What name?" she asked, touching me on the shoulder. I told her my name, and she 

repeated it after me and made Yulka say it. She pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind 

whose top we stood and said again, "What name?"  We sat down and made a nest in the long red 

grass. Yulka curled up like a baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper. Antonia pointed up to the 

sky and questioned me with her glance. I gave her the word, but she was not satisfied and pointed 

to my eyes. I told her, and she repeated the word, making it sound like "ice." She pointed up to the 

sky, then to my eyes, then back to the sky, with movements so quick and impulsive that she 

distracted me, and I had no idea what she wanted. She got up on her knees and wrung her hands. 

She pointed to her own eyes and shook her

seems to enjoy."  "That's what Mr. Wentworth thought," nodded the widow. "He said several city 

boarding places have been tried, and each time Jack runs away."  "The boy needs strict discipline 

but from someone who has an interest in his welfare."  "I've always liked boys--even so-called bad 

ones," Mrs. Jones declared. "Jack would have good food here and a comfortable bed. The house 

isn't much, but after all, it's what's in it that counts."  The widow, who wore no wrap, was shivering 

from cold. Aware that they were keeping her, the Cubs started away.  But as they started off, Mr. 

Hatfield thought to speak of the tramp who had been seen at the group of new houses.  "Since 

you live here alone, it might be well to lock your doors at night," the Cub leader advised. "While the 

fellow probably is harmless, one never knows."  Mrs. Jones thanked him for the warning. "I'll do as 

you advise," she said, "but I've never been afraid. It's not in my blood to be afeared of anyone or 

anything."  The Cubs apologized again for having trespassed upon her property.  "Now you boys 

just come here whenever you like," she invited cordially. "Next time maybe I'll have some cookies 

handy in my jar. Growing boys always are hungry. I know, because I had three of 'em. They're 

grown men now."  A lonely soul, Mrs. Jones would have chatted on and on. The Cubs, however, 

already were late. So they edged away, waved a final goodbye, and trudged back to the main 

road.  "That should cure us of peeking into windows," Brad to mine and to the sky, nodding 

violently.  "Oh," I exclaimed, "blue; blue sky."  She clapped her hands and murmured, "Blue sky, 

blue eyes," as if it amused her. While we snuggled down there out of the wind she learned a score 

of words. She was quick, and very eager. We were so deep in the grass that we could see nothing 

but the blue sky over us and the gold tree in front of us. It was wonderfully pleasant. After Antonia 

had said the new words over and over, she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring she wore 

on her middle finger. When she coaxed and insisted, I repulsed her quite sternly. I did n't want her 

ring, and I felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to 

a boy she had never seen before. No wonder Krajiek got the better of these people, if this was 

how they behaved.  While we were disputing about the ring, I heard a mournful voice calling, "An-

tonia, An-tonia!" She sprang up like a hare. "Tatinek, Tatinek!" she shouted, and we ran to meet 

the old man who was coming toward us. Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it. 

When I came up, he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my face for several 

seconds. I became somewhat embarrassed, for I was used to being taken for granted by my 

elders.  We went with Mr. Shimerda back to the dugout, where grandmother was waiting for me. 

Before I got into the wagon, he took a book out of his pocket, opened it, and showed me a page 

with two alphabets, one English and

was mighty nice about it, but she could have jumped all over us."  "How was I to know anyone 

lived there?" Babe defended himself. "You thought yourself the house was empty."  "That's so," 

Brad admitted honestly. "Mrs. Jones must be as poor as a church mouse. She needs that board 

money badly."  "And Jack needs someone like Mrs. Jones to take an interest in him," added Mr. 

Hatfield. "She is firm but kind."  "Imagine living in a place like that!" Chips commented with 

distaste. "It's a dump."  "The inside is clean looked at her entreatingly, and said with an 

earnestness which I shall never forget, "Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my An-tonia!"     IV   ON the afternoon 

of that same Sunday I took my first long ride on my pony, under Otto's direction. After that Dude 

and I went twice a week to the post-office, six miles east of us, and I saved the men a good deal of 

time by riding on errands to our neighbors. When we had to borrow anything, or to send about 

word that there would be preaching at the sod schoolhouse, I was always the

"I noticed when she had the door open. As for the outside, the windows could be washed and the 

rubbish cleaned up in a few hours."  "Say, maybe that's a job for the Cubs!" proposed Brad. "We're 

supposed to give neighborhood good will. What better way?"  "That yard has a lot of rubbish," 

Chips said quickly. "It would take more than a few hours--maybe half a day."  "And we're pretty 

busy soliciting for the church campaign," added Red. "Not to mention our plans for the Round 

Table jamboree."  "It was just a suggestion," Brad shrugged. "Only I thought the widow seems to 

need help."  "I'd like to do it," offered Dan. "I could spare working hours.  All the years that have 

passed have not dimmed my memory of that first glorious autumn. The new country lay open 

before me: there were no fences in those days, and I could choose my own way over the grass 

uplands, trusting the pony to get me home again. Sometimes I followed the sunflower-bordered 

roads. Fuchs told me that the sunflowers were introduced into that country by the Mormons; that at 

the time of the persecution, when they left Missouri and struck out into the wilderness to find a 

place where they could worship God in their own way, the members of the first exploring party, 

crossing the plains to Utah,
