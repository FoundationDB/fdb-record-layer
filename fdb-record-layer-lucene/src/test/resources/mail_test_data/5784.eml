nd, before taking up their positions in the line parallel to _
these cycles he delights in following a development not unlike that of a mu=
sical theme, beginning=20

with a prelude and carrying the idea through manifold variations to its fin=
al expression. His curious=20

history of the finding of a glove which passes through different symbolic f=
orms of individuality in=20

the dreams of a lover, is a fair example of his eccentric and somewhat lumb=
ering humor in the use=20

of a symbol in his earlier years. His etchings for Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ s=
how the same violent=20

grasp of the lighter side of his subject, but in his landscape etchings of =
1881 we have ample=20

opportunity to see what he could do with a conventionally charming subject =
treated with=20

conventional sentiment and without symbolic intention. The moonlight scene =
which he calls=20

_Mondnacht_, has all the subtle exquisite feeling for harmony and tone to b=
e gained from a=20

Whistler nocturne. The dim light on the buildings, the soft sweep of the cl=
ouds across the dark sky,=20

the impalpable rendering, the grave and deep beauty of the scene combine to=
 express the=20

essence of night and its mystery. The oil-painting _Abend_, of 1882, also b=
ears eloquent=20

testimony to Klinger's power to evoke purely pictorial images of great love=
liness.  In 1882, after=20

about a year of study in Munich, he painted the important frescoes for the =
Steglitz Villa, in which=20

the influence of Boecklin played freely. It was in Paris, however, where he=
 studied between 1883=20

and 1885, that Klinger received his strongest and most definite impulse tow=
ard painting. His=20

_Judgment of Paris_ revealed the fact that the young painter had come into =
possession of himself,=20

and could be depended upon for qualities demanding constraint and a measure=
 of severity. In=20

choosing a legend of antiquity for the subject of his picture, he may have =
felt a psychological=20

obligation to obey the greater influences of the antique tradition. At all =
events he rather suddenly=20

developed a style of great maturity and firmness. From Paris he went back t=
o Berlin, but in 1889=20

he started for Rome, where he spent four profitable years. The fruit of thi=
s Roman period has=20

continued to ripen up to the present time, although since 1893 Klinger has =
made his home in=20

Leipzig, his _wanderjahre_ apparently over and done with. He not only paint=
ed in Rome a _Pieta_,=20

a _Crucifixion_, and a number of pictures in which problems of open-air pai=
nting are attacked, but=20

he conceived there the powerful series of etchings on the subject of death,=
 and there he made his=20

first attempts in colored sculpture. From his earliest years, the image of =
death had often solicited=20

him, and some of his interpretations are filled with dignity and pathos. In=
 the slender, rigid figure on=20

a white draped bed, from the etching cycle entitled _Eine fleet in the shor=
ter space of time.  In the=20

fall of the year 1814 the English had one fairly sized frigate, the _Confia=
nce_, mounting thirty-nine=20

guns; a brig, the _Linnet_; a sloop, _Chubb_, and the sloop _Finch_; beside=
s which they=20

possessed thirteen large galleys, aggregating eighteen guns. In all, theref=
ore, the English fleet=20

mounted ninety-five guns. The Americans had the _Saratoga_, sloop of war, t=
wenty-six guns; the=20

_Eagle_, twenty; the _Ticonderoga_, seventeen; the _Preble_, seven; and ten=
 galleys carrying=20

sixteen; their total armament was nine guns less than the British.  By the =
first week in September=20

Sir George Prevost had organized his forces and started at the head of four=
teen thousand men to=20

the southward. It was his intention to dislodge General Macomb, who was sta=
tioned at Plattsburg,=20

where considerable fortifications had been erected. A great deal of the mil=
itia force had been=20

drawn down the State to the city of New York, owing to the fears then enter=
tained that the British=20

intended making an attack upon the city from their fleet. It was Sir George=
=E2=80=99s plan to destroy forever=20

the power of the Americans upon the lake, and for that reason it was necess=
ary to capture the=20

naval force which had been for some time under the command of Macdonough. T=
he English=20



leader arranged a plan with Captain Downie, who was at the head of the squa=
dron, that=20

simultaneous attacks should be made by water and land. At eight o=E2=80=99c=
lock on the morning of=20

September 11th news was brought to Lieutenant Macdonough that the enemy was=
 approaching.=20

As his own vessels were in a good position to repel an attack, he decided t=
o remain at anchor and=20

await the onslaught in a line formation. In about an hour the enemy had com=
e within gunshot=20

distance, and formed a line of his own parallel with that of the Americans.=
 There was little or no=20

breeze, and consequently small chance for man=C5=93uvring. The _Confiance_ =
evidently claimed the=20

honor of exchanging broadsides with the _Saratoga_. The _Linnet_ stopped op=
posite the _Eagle_,=20

and the galleys rowed in and began to fire at the _Ticonderoga_ and the _Pr=
eble_.  [Illustration:=20

PLAN OF THE NAVAL ACTION ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN]  Macdonough wrote such a clear =
and=20

concise account of the action that it is best to quote from it:  =E2=80=9C.=
.. The whole force on both sides=20

became engaged, the _Saratoga_ suffering much from the heavy fire of the _C=
onfiance_. I could=20

perceive at the same time, however, that our fire was very destructive to h=
er. The _Ticonderoga_,=20

Lieutenant-Commandant Cassin, gallantly sustained her full share of the act=
ion. At half-past ten=20

the _Eagle_, not being able to bring her guns to bear, cut her cable, and a=
nchored in a more=20

eligible position, between my ship and the _Ticonderoga_, where=20


_
the suggestion of a classic tomb, severe and impressive in outline, while n=
othing could be more=20

poignant than the emotional appeal of the _Mutter und Kind_ in the second d=
eath series. To turn=20

from these to the two religious paintings executed in Rome, is to realize t=
hat eccentric as Klinger=20

often is, both in choice of subject and treatment, his attitude toward the =
mysteries and problems of=20

man's existence is that of a serious thinker with a strong artistic talent,=
 but a still stronger=20

intelligence. It is not, however, until we reach the period which he devote=
s to sculpture, that we=20

find in his art the quality of nobility, a certain breadth, which in spite =
of innovations in execution=20

and almost trivial symbolic detail, impresses upon his conceptions the clas=
sic mark.  He began his=20

studies for his great polychromatic statue of Beethoven as early as 1886, f=
ifteen years before its=20

completion. In 1892 it was reported in Rome that he had turned to sculpture=
 as a new field in=20

which to prove himself a master, and his first exhibited figure placed him =
above the rank of the=20

amateur. He threw himself into his new work with his usual energy, making h=
imself familiar with=20

the technicalities of marble cutting in order to follow the execution with =
intelligence at every stage.=20

He sought for his material with unwearying zest, taking long journeys into =
Italy, Greece and the=20

Pyrenees to procure marble with the soft, worn, rich quality produced by ex=
posure to the weather;=20

with this he combined onyx very much annoyed the enemy, but unfortunately l=
eaving me exposed=20

to a galling fire from the enemy=E2=80=99s brig.  =E2=80=9COur guns on the =
starboard side being nearly all=20

dismounted or unmanageable, a stern-anchor was let go, the bower-cable cut,=
 and the ship=20

winded with a fresh broadside on the enemy=E2=80=99s ship, which soon after=
 surrendered. Our broadside=20

was then sprung to bear on the brig, which struck about fifteen minutes aft=
erward. The sloop which=20

was opposed to the _Eagle_ had struck some time before, and drifted down th=
e line. The sloop=20

which was with their galleys had also struck. Three of their galleys are sa=
id to be sunk; the others=20

pulled off. Our galleys were about obeying with alacrity the signal to foll=
ow them, when all the=20

vessels were reported to me to be in a sinking state. It then became necess=
ary to annul the signal=20

to the galleys and order their men to the pumps. I could only look at the e=
nemy=E2=80=99s galleys going off=20

in a shattered condition, for there was not a mast in either squadron that =
could stand to make sail=20

on. The lower rigging, being nearly all shot away, hung down as though it h=
ad just been placed=20

over the mast-heads.  =E2=80=9CThe _Saratoga_ had fifty-nine round shot in =
her hull; the _Confiance_ one=20

hundred and five. The enemy=E2=80=99s shot passed principally just over our=
 heads, as there were not=20

twenty whole hammocks in the nettings at the close of the action, which las=
ted, without=20

intermission, two hours and twenty minutes.  =E2=80=9CThe absence and sickn=
ess of Lieutenant Raymond=20

Perry=20
