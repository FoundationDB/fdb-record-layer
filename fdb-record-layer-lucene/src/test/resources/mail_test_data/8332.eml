lord in person, or his seneschal or baillie, held his court to administer justice. It was the common 

room of the house, and usually contained all there was in the way of decoration. Comfort even 

here was hardly to be found; one can fancy that the fire on the open hearth gave out more smoke

even less pretentious in the way of comfort. Opening out of the hall, or arranged around the court, 

were little cubby-holes of places to serve as sleeping apartments. The furniture in them was of the
