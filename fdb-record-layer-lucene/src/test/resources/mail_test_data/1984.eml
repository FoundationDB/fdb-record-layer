aid in attaining verisimilitude.  The most eminent name in the history of French tragedy of the 

sixteenth century is that of ROBERT GARNIER (1534-90). His discipleship to Seneca was at first 

that of a pupil who reproduces with exaggeration his master's errors. Sensible of the want of

to accumulate action upon action without reducing the action to unity. At length, in _Les Juives_ 

(1583), which exhibits the revolt of the Jewish King and his punishment by Nabuchodonosor, he 

attained something of true pity and terror, beauty of characterisation, beauty of lyrical utterance in 

the plaintive songs of the chorus. Garnier was assuredly a poet; but even in _Les Juives_, the best 

tragedy of his century, he was not a master of dramatic art. If anywhere he is in a true sense 

dramatic, it is in his example of the new form of tragi-comedy. _Bradamante_, derived from the 

_Orlando Furioso_ of Ariosto, shows not only poetic imagination, but a certain feeling for the 

requirements of the theatre.  Comedy in the sixteenth century, dating from Jodelle's _Eugene_,
