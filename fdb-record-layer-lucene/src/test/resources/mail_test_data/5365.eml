"That's right," assented Mr. Titus.  "Well, we're off for Peru!" exclaimed =
Mr. Damon, as the vessel=20

moved down the bay.     Chapter VIII  The Bearded Man   Travel to Tom and M=
r. Damon=20

presented no novelties. They had been on too many voyages over the sea, und=
er the sea and=20

even in the air above the sea to find anything unusual in merely taking a t=
rip on a steamer.  Mr.=20

Titus, though he admitted he had never been in a submarine or airship, had =
done considerable=20

traveling about the world in his time, and had had it been purposely founde=
d as the expected=20

capital of a great Empire."  Soon after lie arrived, Talon retired from his=
 post of Intendant, fearing a=20

conflict with the indomitable spirit of the new Governor.  For Frontenac, w=
ith all his excellent=20

qualities, could endure no opposition.  He chafed at any criticism of his a=
uthority. And opposition=20

and criticism were to be his lot for years.  He soon became engaged in {107=
} bitter disputes with=20

the officials of the colony, with Bishop Laval, who was as stern and=20


_
was an old hand at it.  But to Koku, who, since he had been brought from th=
e land where Tom=20

Swift had been made captive, had gone about but little, everything was nove=
l, and he did not know=20

at what to look first.  The giant was interested in the ship, in the water,=
 in the passengers, in the=20

crew and in the sights to be seen as they progressed down the harbor.  And =
the big man himself=20

was a source of wonder to all save his own party. Everywhere he went about =
the decks, or below,=20

he was followed by a staring but respectful crowd.  Koku took it all good-n=
aturedly, however, and=20

even consented to show his great strength by lifting heavy weights. Once wh=
en several sailors=20

were shifting one of the smaller anchors (a sufficiently heavy one for all =
that) Koku pushed them=20

aside with a sweep of his big arm, and, picking up the big "hook," turned t=
o the second mate and=20

asked:  "Where you want him?"  "Good land, man!" cried the astonished offic=
er. "You'll kill=20

yourself!"  But Koku carried the anchor where it ought to go, and from then=
 on he was looked up to=20

with awe and admiration by the sailors.  From San Francisco to Callao, Peru=
 (the latter city being=20

the seaport of Lima, which is situated inland), is approximately nine hundr=
ed miles. But as the=20

Bellaconda was a coasting steamer, and would make several stops on her trip=
, it would be more=20

than a week before our friends would land at Callao, then to proceed to Lim=
a, where they=20

expected to remain a day or so before striking into the interior to where t=
he tunnel was being bored=20

through the mountain.  The first day was spent in getting settled, becoming=
 used to their new=20

surroundings, finding their places and neighbors at table, and in making ac=
quaintances. There=20

were some interesting men and women aboard the Bellaconda, and Tom Swift, M=
r. Damon and=20

Mr. Titus soon made friends with them. This usually came about through the =
medium of Koku, the=20

giant. Persons seeing him would inquire about him, and when they learned he=
 was Tom Swift's=20

helper it was an easy topic with which to open conversation.  Tom told, mod=
estly enough, how he=20

had come to get Koku in his escape from captivity, but Mr. Damon was not so=
 simple in describing=20

Tom's feats, so that before many days had passed our hero found himself reg=
arded as a=20

personage of considerable importance, which was not at all to his liking.  =
"But bless my fountain=20

pen!" cried Mr. Damon, when Tom objected to so much notoriety. "You did it =
all; didn't you?"  "Yes,=20

I know. But these people won't believe it."  "Oh, yes they will!" said the =
odd man. "I'll take good=20

care that they believe it."  "If any one say it not so, you tell me!" broke=
 Koku, shaking his huge fist.=20

"No, I guess I'd better keep still," said Tom, with a laugh.  The weather w=
as pleasant, if we except=20

a shower or two, and as the vessel proceeded south, tropical clothing becam=
e the order of the=20

day, while all who could, spent most of their time on deck under the with t=
he new Intendant,=20

Duchesneau, and with the Governor of Montreal.  Frontenac disliked the Jesu=
its; he was=20

constantly seeking to curb their influence.  This unhappy three-cornered co=
nflict lasted all through=20

Frontenac's first governorship of ten years.  He became more and more despo=
tic, banishing=20

members of the Council who offended him, and finally sending Governor Perro=
t of Montreal, as=20

well as a hostile priest named Fenelon, back to France, where the former wa=
s imprisoned in the=20

Bastille.  He had many enemies, but Frontenac had also many friends.  These=
 idolised him, and to=20

one, the brilliant and adventurous La Salle, he stood firm as a rock.  We h=
ave seen how=20

Frontenac's predecessor, Courcelle, had planned a fort on Lake Ontario.  Th=
is plan Frontenac=20

warmly approved, and believing the post ought to be a strong one, he sent 4=
00 men to construct=20

the works and to serve as garrison.  He also established another fort at Ni=
agara.  The project of=20

discovering the vast stream which the Indians called the Mississippi also g=
reatly interested the=20



Governor, and a strong and able priest, Father Marquette, and a fur-trading=
 explorer named Jolliet=20

left the St. Lawrence in its quest.  Frontenac, La Salle, and the others st=
ill cherished in their hearts=20

a vision of a short route to China.  At that time no one knew how far away =
the Pacific Ocean lay--

no one dreamt that thousands of miles of mountain range and prairie separat=
ed Quebec and New=20

York from its shores.  Marquette and Jolliet, with a few {108} followers, p=
ushed on to the north-

west of Lake Michigan.  After much paddling and many portages their canoes =
brought them at last=20

into the swelling flood of the greatest river in the world.  What emotions =
they felt!  In wonder and=20

triumph they descended the Mississippi, and during the month which followed=
, passed the mouths=20

of three other great rivers, the Illinois, the Missouri, and the Ohio.  The=
y had many talks with=20

friendly Indians on the banks; they saw much beautiful scenery and many str=
ange sights. At last=20

they drew near to the mouth of the river of Arkansas, where savages who had=
 never so much as=20

looked on the face of a white man were not so friendly.  Jolliet and his co=
mpanion deemed that=20

they had gone far enough.  By this time they had made up their minds that t=
he great river emptied=20

not into the Pacific ocean but into the Gulf of Mexico.  Reluctantly they t=
urned back, and not till the=20

following summer did the two explorers reach Canada again.  All through thi=
s memorable journey=20

Jolliet had noted down in a book a description of all that had attracted hi=
s attention, besides=20

sketching carefully a map of the course.  This book he guarded jealously, i=
ntending it for the eyes=20

of the Governor, of King Louis, and the people of France. Alas, just as he =
had run Lachine rapids=20

and was in sight of home, his canoe capsized and the precious volume floate=
d away on the=20

rushing waters!  It was a cruel disappointment for=20


_
of awnings.  "Did you ever hear anything more of that fellow, Waddington?" =
asked Tom of Mr.=20

Titus one day.  "Not a thing. He seems to have dropped out of sight."  "And=
 are your rivals,=20

Blakeson & Grinder, making any trouble?"  "Not that I've heard of. Though j=
ust what the situation=20

may be down in Peru I don't know. I fancy everything isn't going just right=
 or my brother would not=20

be so anxious for me to come on in such a hurry."  "Do you anticipate any r=
eal trouble?"  Mr. Titus=20

paused a moment before answering.  "Well, yes," he said, finally, "I do!"  =
"What sort?" asked Tom.=20

"That I can't say. I'll be perfectly frank with you, Tom.  You know I told =
you at the time that we were=20

in for received him graciously, heard his story, and reported what he had h=
eard to his royal master.=20

As for Jolliet's companion, Father Marquette was wholly worn out by {109} h=
is exertions.  Less=20

than two years later he lay down and died by a little river pouring into La=
ke Michigan, baffled in his=20

dream of converting whole tribes of Indians in what was then the Far West. =
 Neither he nor the=20

Canadian-born Jolliet have been forgotten in this region.  To many towns an=
d counties have their=20

names been given, and their statues in bronze and marble are to be seen in =
several places in=20

America to-day.  Jolliet and Marquette had begun the work; it now remained =
for another strong,=20

ardent, adventurous spirit to=20
