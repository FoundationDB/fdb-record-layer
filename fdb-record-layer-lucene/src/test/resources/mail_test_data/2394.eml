A pet grizzly bear had been for a number of years a feature at Hartranft's.=
 As a puny infant, barely=20

able to crawl, Solomon, as he was solemnly dubbed, was brought in off the T=
eton Mountains, and=20

as milk was scarcer than money at the horse-ranch, he was aristocratically =
fed on malted milk.  On=20

this expensive diet the cub throve amazingly. Good feeding was continued af=
ter his weaning from=20

the rubber nipple, and at the end of three years Solomon had grown to be a =
fat wooly monster. He=20

was kept chained to a post in the warm season, and had an enclosed stall in=
 a big barn for his=20

winter quarters. Ordinarily he was good-natured, but he was a rough and not=
 altogether safe=20

playfellow. The near-by bawling of cattle always aroused in him ebullitions=
 of rage.  "Solomon's got=20

an awful grouch agin any noise bigger than what he can make hisself," was t=
he saying of the=20

ranch hands.  When Joe Hartranft's sister, Mrs. Murray, and her two boys, R=
ufe and Perry, came=20

to the ranch to spend the month of June, Solomon was promptly hustled into =
his stall in the barn. It=20

was thought best to have no consider the position which he had so rashly cr=
eated for himself; but=20

he did fall asleep--and in the hard chair! He was awakened by a tremendous =
clatter, as if the=20

house was being bombarded and there were bricks falling about his ears. Whe=
n he regained all=20

his senses this bombardment resolved itself into nothing but a loud and con=
tinued assault on the=20

front door. He rose, and saw a frowsy, dishevelled, puce-coloured figure in=
 the dirty mirror over the=20

fireplace. And then, with stiff limbs, he directed his sleepy feet towards =
the door.  Dr. Cashmore=20

was at the door, and still another man of fifty, a stern-set, blue-chinned,=
 stoutish person in deep=20

and perfect mourning, including black gloves.  This person gazed coldly at =
Priam Farll.  "Ah!"=20

ejaculated the mourner.  And stepped in, followed by Dr. Cashmore.  In achi=
eving the inner mat=20

the mourner perceived a white square on the floor. He picked it up and care=
fully examined it, and=20

then handed it to Priam Farll.  "I suppose this is for you," said he.  Pria=
m, accepting the envelope,=20

saw that it was addressed to "Henry Leek, Esq., 91=20
