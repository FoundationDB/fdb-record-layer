moral heartlessness and skepticism, which is fatal to the higher virtues, and not more so to religion 

and true friendship, than to a disinterested patriotism.  Besides, in well informed and well disposed 

communities, nothing is more common than to overrate the talents, and real efficiency of bad men. 

We see it every where; for even in a number of brothers, if there is one of them who gives himself 

up to vicious and profligate courses, he almost always passes for the genius of the family. We 

judge a man's power to do good by what we see of his power to do evil; not reflecting that the 

latter is a very vulgar accomplishment, which seldom implies even so much as the perversion of a 

great mind. There is the more occasion that topics like these should be pressed in a government 

like ours, as it is essentially popular, and on this account more likely to be carried away by 

qualities that are merely striking and popular, in contradistinction to such as are solid and useful. If

as he wants it no longer," cried Lady Lindores.  "My dear, you are always violent; you are always a 

partisan," said her husband, drawing back his chair a little, with the air of having ended the 

discussion; and there was a pause--one of those breathless pauses of helplessness, yet rebellion, 

which make sick the hearts of women. Lady Lindores clasped her hands together with a 

despairing movement. "This is the curse of our life," she cried. "I can do nothing; I cannot go 

against your father, Edith, and yet I am neither a fool nor a child. God help us women! we have to 

stand by, whatever wrong is done, and submit--submit. That is all that is left for us to do----" 

"Submit!" Edith said. She was young and strong, and had not learned her lesson. It galled her 

beyond endurance. She stood and looked round her, seeing the whiteness of the faces, but little 

else in the evening gloom. Was it true that there was nothing--nothing in her power? In poetry,

mind, it is originality; nor do we object to this criterion when properly applied. But it unfortunately 

happens, that unprincipled men, not having the least particle of real originality, may easily gain a 

reputation for in the popular mind merely by being, or affecting to be singular in their ways of 

thinking and acting. Let a man of nothing more than ordinary powers strike away from the common 

track, advance a few startling paradoxes, and defend them with as much plausibility as he can, 

and straightway he becomes, in the eyes of the million at least, a wonderful genius.  Such were

her knees, can weep and plead--but only weep and plead; and she, who had not been trained to 

that, who was conscious of her individuality, her independent mind and judgment in every nerve--

heaven above! was she as helpless still? She stood breathless for a moment, with wondering eyes 

fixed on the darkness, with a gasp of proud resistance to fate. Submit to injustice, to cruel 

heartlessness of those who could aid, to still more cruel helplessness--impotence, on her own 

part? She stood for a moment gazing at the blank wall that seemed to rise before her, as the poor,
