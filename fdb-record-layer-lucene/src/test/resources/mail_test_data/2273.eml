matter to him who had been associated with Hargrave in publishing Sir Edwar=

BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.  The sculptures which have been preserved wi=
th=20

comparatively little injury for upwards of six centuries on the western fro=
nt of the venerable=20

cathedral of Wells have long excited the wonder and curiosity, as well as a=
dmiration, of all who=20

looked upon them. All have been ready to recognise in them the expression o=
f some grand design;=20

but it has been reserved for Professor Cockerell to penetrate, through the =
quaintness of the style=20

and the dilapidations of centuries, into their noble aim and purpose, and t=
o describe at length this=20

"extensive but hitherto unedited commentary in living sculpture of the thir=
teenth century, upon our=20

earliest dynasties, our churchmen, and religious creed." This he has done i=
n a handsome and=20

richly illustrated volume, lately published by Mr. Parker under the title o=
f _Iconography of the West=20

Front of Wells Cathedral, with an Appendix on the Sculptures of other Media=
eval Churches in=20

England_: and the work will be found of the highest interest, not only for =
its valuable illustration of=20

this "kalender for unlearned men," which we owe to the piety and love of ar=
t of Bishop Trotman,=20

and which Flaxman speaks of as "_the earliest specimen_ of such magnificent=
 and varied=20

sculpture united in a series of sacred history that is to be found in weste=
rn Europe," but also for=20

the light it throws upon the history of art in this country. For not only h=
ave we in these pages the=20

results of Professor Cockerell's studies of the extensive and important ser=
ies of sculptures which=20

form the immediate subject of them; but also his criticisms and remarks upo=
n the cognate objects=20

to be found at Exeter, Norwich, Malmesbury, Canterbury, Rochester, York, Be=
verley, Lichfield,=20

Worcester, Lincoln, Gloucester, Salisbury, Peterborough, Croyland, and Bath=
. And who can speak=20

with greater authority upon such points? whose opinion would be received wi=
th greater respect?=20



Surely Rome must have been styled the _Eternal City_ because there is no en=
d to the books=20

which are published respecting it:    "For every year and month sends forth=
 a new one;"  yet the=20

subject never seems exhausted. Now it is a high churchman who gives a pictu=
re of this "Niobe of=20

nations," tinted _couleur de rose_; now a low churchman, who talks of nothi=
ng but abominations of=20

a deeper dye; now some classical student tells how--        "The Goth, the =
Christian, time, war,=20

flood, and fire       Have dealt upon the seven hill'd city's pride;"  now =
some worshipper of art, who=20

unfolds the treasures garnered within its walls; now a politician loud in h=
is praises of Young Italy,=20

or his condemnation of foreign interference. The Chevalier de Chatelaine is=
 none of these, or=20

rather, he is almost all of them by turns; and consequently his _Rambles th=
ough Rome, descriptive=20

of the Social, Political, and Ecclesiastical Condition of the City and its =
Inhabitants_, is a volume of=20

pleasant gossip, more amusing to the reader than flattering to the characte=
r of the Roman people=20

*  [Sidenote: CHILDREN IN A HOTEL]  The matter of children in a hotel is on=
e on which so much=20

has been said and written that there is little left to say. At the first gl=
ance one is tempted to resent=20

the fact that many hotel proprietors object to having children accompany th=
eir parents to the public=20

table, and that some even demur at their presence in the house. Child-lover=
s have said bitterly=20

that the celestial =E2=80=9Cmany mansions=E2=80=9D seem to be the only abod=
es in which the little ones are=20

welcome,=E2=80=94and all these opinions have a great deal of truth on their=
 side. But it is not until one has=20



undergone the annoyance of ill-governed children in a house where there are=
 no restrictions=20

enforced on them that one sees the other side of the shield. One large boar=
ding-house at a=20

fashionable summer resort is popular to mothers of large families because t=
he proprietor does not=20

object to children. A guest there last season decided that if that were the=
 case said proprietor had=20

no nerves. She soon learned that childless guests declined to stay at the p=
lace. Children raced up=20

and down the long corridors, screaming as they went; they played noisily ou=
tside of bedroom=20

doors; they ate like little pigs at the hotel tables. In short, they made t=
he house a purgatory for all=20

except other children and their mothers.  [Sidenote: TWO TYPES OF MOTHERS] =
 There are two=20

types of mothers in this land of ours that are greatly at fault. One is the=
 mother who hands the=20

management of the children over to a nurse or several nurses, and she is, o=
f course, the rich=20

woman whose children see her seldom, and that not often enough to bother he=
r. The other type is=20

the woman who has nerves toward all things except her own children=E2=80=99=
s noise. She is such a doting=20

parent that she is, to all appearances, blind and deaf to the fact that her=
 own offspring drive to the=20

verge of insanity other =E2=80=9Cgrown-ups=E2=80=9D with whom they come in =
contact. Verily the American=20

youngster is having everything his own way in private and public nowadays! =
Dwellers in hotels are=20

to be pardoned if they beg that he be kept in private until his parents lea=
rn to govern him, and by=20

thus doing, show mercy to other people.  While the rules that govern propri=
ety should be adhered=20

to everywhere, there is no other place where they should be more strictly o=
bserved than at the=20

summer hotel, or the boarding-house of a fashionable watering-place. It may=
 not be an=20

exaggeration to state that there are few decent places where they are more =
openly disregarded.=20

With the trammels of city life one seems to lay down an appreciation of the=
 fitness of things=20

generally. The free intercourse, the rapidly-made acquaintances, the mingli=
ng of many sorts of=20

peoples in the huge caravansary=E2=80=94tend to make us cast aside conventi=
onalities. Husbands,=20

running down from the city for a Sunday with their wives, find them absorbe=
d and happy in the gay=20

life about them, and quite sufficient unto themselves when the husbands ret=
urn to counting-room=20

and office on Monday morning. There is always a class of men who, having no=
thing else to do, are=20

habitu=C3=A9s of the summer hotel, where they flirt with the wives of other=
 men and make themselves=20

generally useful and talked about.  [Sidenote: AVOIDING GOSSIP]  There may =
be no harm in all=20

this sort of thing, but it is well for the discreet maiden and matron to av=
oid giving any cause for the=20

enemy to blaspheme,=E2=80=94in other words, for the gossip to make herself =
busy and dangerous. To this=20

end, late hours in shaded corners of verandas, moonlight sails and walks, a=
nd beach-promenades=20

well on toward midnight, are to be shunned. While these may be innocent per=
 se, they give rise to=20

scandal. The young girl may always have a chaperon to whom to refer as to t=
he proprieties, but it=20

is not the young girl who is most talked about. The married woman whose hus=
band lets her have=20

her own way is a law unto herself, and she must be careful not to make that=
 law too lax. It takes=20

very little to set silly tongues wagging; it takes months and years to chec=
k the commotion they=20

have made.         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: PROMISCUOU=
S FRIENDSHIPS]=20

Promiscuous intimacies at summer resorts are a great mistake. Unless a woma=
n knows all about=20

a fellow guest, she should not get into the habit of running into her room,=
 or of talking with her as=20

with a lifelong friend. She may be pleasant toward all, and intimate with n=
one.  It is a well-known=20

fact that there is no other hotbed of gossip equal to a hotel or a boarding=
-house. Women, released=20

from the cares and anxieties of housekeeping and home-making, turn their ti=
me and thoughts to=20



fancy work and scandal. Each arrival runs the gantlet of criticism and comm=
ent, and afterward=20

becomes the subject of =E2=80=9Cconfidential=E2=80=9D conversations upon ve=
randa and in parlors. Here, as=20

everywhere else, work that will occupy the mind is a sovereign cure for thi=
s habit. One can usually=20

sit in one=E2=80=99s own room, but if one does not, there is always a book =
to be read in parlors or on the=20

veranda, which will show the would-be gossip or retailer of scandal that on=
e is too much occupied=20

to engage in conversation.  [Sidenote: TWO GOOD RULES]  Certainly in a hote=
l no one lives unto=20

himself, but each must consider the comfort of his neighbor. Such a semi-pu=
blic life is at the best a=20

poor substitute for a home existence. Two rules to be observed will make ot=
her rules of hotel or=20

boarding-house etiquette sink into insignificance compared with their impor=
tance.  First: Do=20

nothing that will make others uncomfortable.  Second: Pay attention to your=
 own business, and=20

pay no=20

 RESTAURANT   THE=20

woman who, for the first time, is taken to dinner in a large restaurant is =
naturally slightly confused=20

by the experience. She needs, however, to know only a few essential points =
in order to be able to=20

conduct herself with propriety and to enjoy her evening. She and the man wh=
o has taken her will=20

leave their wraps in charge of the maid or hat man at the door. If she has =
worn a hat, she will=20

retain this, but if she has gone in a carriage or a car with only a light s=
carf about her head, she=20

need not be embarrassed, for many of the women in the room will be without =
head-gear. In this=20

country, it is not customary for women dining in public places to wear gown=
s cut more than slightly=20

low.  When the two are shown to their table, the woman should remove her gl=
oves, keeping them=20



in her lap or perhaps putting them on an empty chair that is near. Neither =
the gloves nor a hand-

bag should ever be placed on the table. The man should do the ordering, but=
 as he will consult his=20

guest=E2=80=99s wishes, she should be prepared to express these definitely =
and with sufficient promptness=20

not to keep the waiter standing too long. Unless something very elaborate i=
