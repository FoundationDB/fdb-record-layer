Square that night. The morning after their births, a woman was sent from th=

plantation to take care of the three mothers; this nurse proved to be "Pars=
on's" grandmother. His=20

mother told him afterwards that the meeting of mother and daughter was very=
 jubilant, but silent=20

and pathetic, because neither could with safety show her pleasure in findin=
g the other. At the=20

auction which was held a few days later, his mother, Rachel, and her two so=
ns, Solomon Augustus=20

and her infant who was later to be known as "Parson," were purchased by A.J=

previously bought "Parson's" father, Willis, from a man named Dolphus of Al=
bany, Georgia; thus=20

were husband and wife re-united. They were taken to Lane's plantation three=
 miles out of Sparta,=20

Georgia, in Hancock County. Mr. Lane owned 85 slaves and was known to be ve=
ry kind and=20

considerate.  "Parson" lived on the Lane plantation until he was eight year=
s old, when he was sold=20

to Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, with whom he lived for two yea=

a year and until he was=20

purchased by John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama--the richest slave-holder =
in Union Springs,=20

Alabama; he remained with him until Emancipation. He recalls that during on=
e of these sales=20

about $800.00 was paid for him.  He describes A.J. Lane as being a kind sla=
ve-holder who fed his=20

slaves well and whipped them but little. All of his other masters, he state=
s, were nice to children,=20

but lashed and whipped the grown-ups.  Mr. Lane's family was comprised of h=

 to those that he=20

customs, among which are the following: That the master's children and thos=
e of the slaves on the=20

plantation played together; the farm crops consisted of corn, cotton, peas,=
