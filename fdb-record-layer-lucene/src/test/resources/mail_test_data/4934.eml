 some skin scraped from his=20

he was still so tangled that he could do nothing except await whatever fate=

Two persons came into the room; he heard them speak sharply and knew then t=

exclamation, a startled cry in syllables that, though wild and meaningless =

an unmistakable effect,--discovery and the highest degree of astonishment. =
This strange cry was=20

SIR,  In examining some masses of the anthracite from Rhode Island, one pie=
ce attracted my=20

attention, from the waved structure of the lamell=C3=A6 into which it separ=
ated. The fragments of this=20

were wedge-shaped, and I found the space between some of the lamin=C3=A6 fi=
lled up by a fibrous,=20

silky substance, which induced me to break up other masses, in one of which=
 I discovered an=20

abundance of amianthus; the filaments are of a light-green colour in some p=
arts of the mass--in=20

the folds over his=20

mouth and eyes.  In a few moments Teeny-bits sat up and looked about him; h=
e had the same=20

sensation that a person sometimes experiences on waking at night in a room =
away from home and=20

finding the walls too near or too far and windows where they should a micro=

w far the presence of this=20

mineral may influence the ignition or combustion of the coal, is a question=
, perhaps, worth=20

determining. Should my engagements permit, I shall make further examination=
