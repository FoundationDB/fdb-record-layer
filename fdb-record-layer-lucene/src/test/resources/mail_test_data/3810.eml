th joy at his narrow escape. "Your Majesty," he said, "I ask no amend. The =
lady had a  Bobby was all eagerness now. He wanted to catch a fish too.  "O=
h, father," he cried. "I've got a bite. Look at me--"  But he didn't finish=
 his sentence, for something heavy on his line gave a jerk. He lost his bal=
ance and fell off the rock _
knew that, being a hero, he must accept the responsibilities of that positi=
on and marry the=20

Princess. He felt nervously in his wallet for the magic glass, for he said =
to himself:  "Since I must=20

marry this giantess, between whom and me is little love, let me be sure tha=
t I can make her small=20

like myself; else there will be no happiness in my family. As soon as we ar=
e wed I will stare at the=20

big girl until she shrinks into the proper size, as did Oscar and the Drago=
n."  Arthur felt into the=20

corners of his wallet for the magic glass--but it was not there! Hurriedly =
he searched again. It was=20

gone! What was to be done? Must he, then, marry the giant girl and be a sla=
ve to her cruel temper=20

all his life? Horrible thought! What had become of the glass? Suddenly he r=
emembered Oscar,=20

who had also been put into the wallet. Oscar likewise was gone!  Arthur saw=
 what had happened.=20

With his little dagger Oscar had cut the threads which bound him and had es=
caped, taking the=20

magic glass with him.  "What makes your face so pale, brave Arthur?" asked =
the King jokingly. "Is=20

it the thought of your dainty little bride?"  Even as Arthur opened his lip=
s to answer, there came a=20

shrill cry from beneath his very nose. Looking down he saw Oscar standing o=
n the table and=20

peering over his beaker of wine. In both arms he held the magic glass, and =
he was turning its=20

shining eye upon Arthur himself.  "Revenge!" cried the little fellow, fierc=
ely. "Revenge! I have=20

learned his secret. I will gaze him smaller and smaller, until he goes out.=
 Nothing can save him!"=20

Before Arthur could move, Oscar pressed his face to the glass and began to =
stare as through a=20

window, his malicious eyes fixed upon Arthur's face. With horror Arthur wai=
ted to feel himself=20

shrink. He looked about fearfully at the other guests, expecting to see the=
m appear to swell into=20

giants as he himself grew tiny. He stared at Oscar again, who should now se=
em larger than=20

himself.  But what was this? Nothing happened. The guests were staring open=
-mouthed with=20

surprise, but they were of the usual size, Oscar was still a tiny dwarf. Ar=
thur rubbed his eyes and=20

looked again. Still nothing happened. The glass seemed to have lost its mag=
ic!  Suddenly, Arthur=20

saw what it meant. The magic of the glass was to last only for three trials=
. Once, before he knew=20

its worth, he had wasted it upon the spider, the rat, and the singing bird.=
 Once the Dragon had felt=20

its power. Its third and last spell had turned Oscar into a midget. Now its=
 virtue was gone. It was=20

but a piece of ordinary crystal, and Oscar's wicked plan was foiled!  With =
a squeal of rage Oscar=20

threw the glass crashing upon the floor, and stamped his foot, which made e=
verybody laugh. It=20

was as if a tiny mouse had stamped.  The King stretched out his hand and to=
ok up the little fellow=20

curiously. "What is this strange insect?" he asked. "Your Majesty," said Ar=
thur, "he is Oscar, a=20

villain who he bothered by their angry attack.  "Are you there, my boy?" he=
 called, looking down.=20

"Yes, father, I'm here," cheerily answered little Bobby.  "All right then, =
I'm coming down and I have=20

such a feast of honey in this jar that it will make your mouth water."  In =
a moment or two he=20

reached the ground and Bobby saw such a sight as he looked into the jar tha=
t his eyes opened=20

wide as saucers.  "My goodness, what a lot of honey! I don't know how you m=
anaged to carry it.=20

Why, even the empty jar was too much for me."  "Yes, my boy," his father an=
swered, "but you=20

must remember you are only a little fellow. Nobody expects little Bobby Bea=
rs to do the things that=20

big bears can do."  "May I eat a little of the honey, or must I wait till I=
 get home?" asked Bobby.=20

"No, go ahead and dip your hand in the jar. There's plenty of it."  Bobby d=
id so and began to eat.=20

"Yum, yum, this is ever so much better honey than what uncle brought. This =
is fine and sweet."=20

Just at this moment his father uttered a cry of warning.  "Run, my boy, as =
fast as you can. Here=20

come the bees! I'll look after the honey."  Father Bear knew he could not k=
eep the bees from=20



stinging Bobby whose skin was soft and tender. They couldn't hurt an old be=
ar like himself, as his=20

skin was tough. That's why he told Bobby to run on ahead. He thought he wou=
ld fool the bees.=20

They would all stop and buzz around him and forget to follow Bobby.  Little=
 Bobby ran as fast as=20

he could. Most of the bees stopped near Father Bear, but a few caught up wi=
th Bobby and gave=20

him a sting or two.  Soon, however, Father Bear drove the bees away with a =
great branch of a=20

tree. Then he hurried and caught up with Bobby and together they ran as fas=
t as the wind. Soon=20

they reached home safely with their great jar of delicious honey.  When Fat=
her Bear told of their=20

adventure, Mother Bear was anxious.  "Didn't my little boy get stung by the=
 bees?" she asked=20

Bobby.  "Oh," he replied, "one or two did bite me in the face. But it doesn=
't hurt much." Bobby was=20

brave, you see, and had been taught not to complain about trifles.  "Still,=
 you had better let me put=20

something on the stings," said his mother, "or else they might grow worse."=
 So she brought some=20

bear-liniment and rubbed it on the bites.     BOBBY CATCHES A FISH AS BIG A=
S HIMSELF   A=20

few mornings later, Father Bear said: "Let's go fishing. We haven't tasted =
nice, fresh fish for a long=20

time."  "That's a good idea," said Mother Bear. "The fish you get in cans a=
ren't anything like the=20

fish you catch yourself."  Bobby Bear didn't say anything at first. He was =
wondering whether the=20

fish would sting, as the bees did.  "How about it, my boy?" his father aske=
d. "Shall we go fishing?"=20

"Surely, father. Let us go now. What do we have to take along?"  "Well," re=
plied Father Bear, "first,=20

we must have lines and floats, and hooks. We can cut a pole when we get to =
the river. But we=20

must have worms."  "I=20


_
him as I punished the Dragon, because he tried to rob me of my most preciou=
s treasure. He can=20

do no more harm, I think."  "Oscar!" said the King. "Indeed, I know him wel=
l. More than once has=20

he done evil in my city, and I have long meant to punish him. You are a cle=
ver fellow to handle him=20

so tactfully. And now, we will dub him 'Companion of the Dragon.' He, too, =
shall have a little cage=20

of gold and shall live with the Dragon for his neighbor. A quaint pair they=
, Arthur! I thank you for=20

them. But where is my daughter, and why does she delay?"  With horror Arthu=
r heard these=20

words. He had forgotten the Princess. Alas! The glass had lost its power. H=
ow then was he to=20

magic her and make her small, as he had hoped to do? How was he to tame thi=
s terrible big girl=20

and make her a nice little wife? Arthur wished that he had never set out to=
 be a hero; he awaited=20

the approach of his bride with terror far greater than he had felt in the D=
ragon's glen.  Presently=20

the heralds came back to the King, and their faces were very grave. "Your M=
ajesty," they said, "we=20

cannot bring the Princess. She has gone; she has fled from the Kingdom with=
 the first royal=20

coachman, who was a handsome young giant after her own heart. Even now they=
 must be=20

Spring," said Bobby.  "You did, eh? That's fine. Let us go and dig some up.=
 Ask your mother for an=20

old tin can to put them in."  It was a lovely day when, about an hour later=
, they started out fishing.=20

Father Bear had the lines, all fixed, in his trouser pocket. He had been ca=
reful to push all the=20

hooks into the cork floats so no harm could be done.  Bobby Bear was very p=
roud to be carrying=20

the worms. After they had gotten almost a hundred they had put some soft, m=
oist earth on top, so=20

you could see no worms. If you hadn't known they were there, you'd have tho=
ught the can had=20

nothing but dirt.  It wasn't nearly as far to the river as it had been to t=
he cornfield. Bobby was glad=20

of this.  They found a nice, mossy bank to sit on. Bobby Bear rested while =
his father got two poles.=20

Taking the lines from his pocket, he tied one to each of the fish poles and=
 there they were, all=20

ready to fish.  "What do you do, father?" asked the boy-bear. "How do you k=
now when you have a=20

fish on the line?"  His father answered, "First, we bait the hooks; that is=
, we put a worm on each of=20

our hooks, so when it hangs dangling in the water the fish jump at it.  "Th=
ey, of course, don't know=20

there's a hook inside. They think it's a regular worm.=20


_
far beyond the border of the neighboring Kingdom. She was heard to say that=
 she would have no=20

dwarf for a husband, however great a hero he might be. And when she knew wh=
at had happened=20

to the Dragon of Hushby, she was afraid."  There was silence in the banquet=
 hall. Then the King=20

struck a blow on the table with his fist that made the Dragon hop and hiss =
nervously, while Oscar=20

fell over and bumped his head on a salt cellar. "Well," said the King, "so =
be it! She was an ill-

tempered jade, and I could do nothing ever so little. This is so you will c=
atch the hook in the fish's=20

mouth. He struggles to get away, and you pull him in.  "There's one thing I=
 want to be sure of, that=20

is, that you don't let the pole fly out of your hand. So, I'll tie it to yo=
ur wrist."  They started fishing.=20

Father Bear got a bite. He pulled his pole up quickly. No fish--but a clean=
 hook. So he put another=20

worm on, threw the line in, and waited.  This time when the fish bit Father=
 Bear was too quick for it,=20

and in a moment he had it up on the=20
