To preserve _Orange-Flowers_ in Jelly.  Gather your Orange-Flowers, in the Morning early, when 

they are just open, and take the Leaves of them. Boil these gently in two or three Waters, passing

don't boil them too soft, nor to lose their Whiteness. When this is done, make a strong jelly'd Syrup

Leaves of the Orange-Flowers; and when it is cold, cover your Glasses with Paper. _N.B._ You 

may thicken your Syrup with the Pulp of Pippins.    _Lemon-_Cakes. From Mrs. _Anne Shepperd_
