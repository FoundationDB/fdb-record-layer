philodendron monstera proslambanomenos, and the concord of the fifth to the diatonic hypaton.  6.

semitones away; and in the diatonic it is at an interval of three semitones from hypate. Hence the 

ten notes produce three different kinds of modes on account of their changes of position in the 

classes.  7. There are five tetrachords: first, the lowest, termed in Greek [Greek: hypaton]; second, 

the middle, called [Greek: meson]; third, the conjunct, termed [Greek: synemmenon]; fourth, the 

disjunct, named [Greek: diezeugmenon]; the fifth, which is the highest, is termed in Greek [Greek: 

hyperbolaion]. The concords, termed in Greek [Greek: symphoniai], of which human modulation 

will naturally admit, are six in number: the fourth, the fifth, the octave, the octave and fourth, the 

octave and fifth, and the double octave.  8. Their names are therefore due to numerical value; for 

as though nature had removed now from the Volga the sumptuous green covers from the banks, 

the brilliant reflections of the sunbeams, the transparent blue distance, and all its smart gala array, 

and had packed it away in boxes till the coming spring, and the crows were flying above the Volga 

and crying tauntingly, "Bare, bare!"  Ryabovsky heard their cawing, and thought he had already 

gone off and lost his talent, that everything in this world was relative, conditional, and stupid, and 

that he ought not to have taken up with this woman.... In short, he was out of humour and 

depressed.  Olga Ivanovna sat behind the screen on the bed, and, passing her fingers through her 

lovely flaxen hair, pictured herself first in the drawing-room, then in the bedroom, then in her 

husband's

becomes stationary on some one note, and then, shifting its pitch, changes its position and passes 

to the limit of the fourth note from that one, we use the term "fourth"; when it passes to the fifth, the 

term is "fifth."[7]  [Note 7: The remainder of this section is omitted from the translation as being an 

obvious interpolation.]  9. For there can be no consonances either in the case of the notes of 

stringed instruments or of the singing voice, between two intervals or between three or six or 

seven; but, as written above, it is only the harmonies of the fourth, the fifth, and so on up to the 

double octave, that have boundaries naturally corresponding to those of the voice: and these 

concords are produced by the union of the notes.     CHAPTER V  SOUNDING VESSELS IN THE 

THEATRE   1. In accordance with the foregoing investigations on mathematical principles, let 

bronze vessels be made, proportionate to the size of the theatre, and let them be so fashioned 

that, when touched, they may produce with one another the notes of the fourth, the fifth, and so on 

up to the double octave. Then, having constructed niches in between the seats of the theatre, let 

the vessels be arranged in them, in accordance with musical laws, in such a way that they 

nowhere touch the wall, but have a clear space all round them and room over their tops. They 

should be set upside down, and be supported on the side facing the stage by wedges not less 

than half a foot high. Opposite each niche, apertures should be left in the surface of the seat next 

below, two feet long and half a foot deep.  2. The arrangement of these vessels, with reference to 

the situations in which they should be placed, may be described as follows. If the theatre be of no 

great size, mark out a horizontal range halfway up, and in it construct thirteen arched niches with 

twelve equal spaces between them, so that of the above mentioned "echea" those which give the 

note nete hyperbolaeon may be placed first on each side, in the niches which are at the extreme 

ends; next to the ends and a fourth below in pitch, the note nete diezeugmenon; third, paramese, 

a fourth below; fourth, nete synhemmenon; fifth, mese, a fourth below; sixth, hypate meson, a 

fourth below; and in the middle and another fourth below, one vessel giving the note hypate 

hypaton.  3. On this principle of arrangement, the voice, uttered from the stage as from a centre, 

and spreading and striking against the cavities of the different vessels, as it comes in contact with 

them, will be increased in clearness of sound, and will wake an harmonious note in unison with 

itself. imagination carried her to the theatre, to the dress-maker, to her distinguished friends. Were 

they getting something up now? Did they think of her? The season had begun by now, and it 

would be time to think about her "At Homes." And Dymov? Dear Dymov! with what gentleness and 

childlike pathos he kept begging her in his letters to make haste and come home! Every month he 

sent her seventy-five roubles, and when she wrote him that she had lent the artists a hundred 

roubles, he sent that hundred too. What a kind, generous-hearted man! The travelling wearied 

Olga Ivanovna; she was bored; and she longed to get away from the peasants, from the damp 

smell of the river, and to cast off the feeling of physical uncleanliness of which she was conscious 

all the time, living in the peasants' huts and wandering from village to village. If Ryabovsky had not 

given his word to the artists that he would stay with them till the twentieth of September, they 

might have gone away that very day. And how nice that would have been!  "My God!" moaned 

Ryabovsky. "Will the sun ever come out? I can't go on with a sunny landscape without the sun...." 

"But you have a sketch with a cloudy sky," said Olga Ivanovna, coming from behind the screen. 

"Do you remember, in the right foreground forest trees, on the left a herd of cows and geese? You 

might finish it now."  "Aie!" the artist scowled. "Finish it! Can you imagine I am such a fool that I 



don't know what I want to do?"  "How you have changed to me!" sighed Olga Ivanovna.  "Well, a 

good thing too!"  Olga Ivanovna's face quivered; she moved away to the stove and began to cry. 

"Well, that's the last straw--crying! Give over! I have a thousand reasons for tears, but I am not 

crying."  "A thousand reasons!" cried Olga Ivanovna. "The chief one is that you are weary of me. 

Yes!" she said, and broke into sobs. "If one is to tell the truth, you are ashamed of our love. You 

keep trying to prevent the artists from noticing it, though it is impossible to conceal it, and they 

have known all about it for ever so long."  "Olga, one thing I beg you," said the artist in an 

imploring voice, laying his hand on his heart--"one thing; don't worry me! I want nothing else from 

you!"  "But swear that you love me still!"  "This is agony!" the artist hissed through his teeth, and 

he jumped up. "It will end by my throwing myself in the Volga or going out of my mind! Let me 

alone!"  "Come, kill me, kill me!" cried Olga Ivanovna. "Kill me!"  She sobbed again, and went 

behind the screen. There was a swish of rain on the straw thatch of the hut. Ryabovsky clutched 

his head and

But if the theatre be rather large, let its height be divided into four parts, so that three horizontal 

ranges of niches may be marked out and constructed: one for the enharmonic, another for the 

chromatic, and the third for the diatonic system. Beginning with the bottom range, let the 

arrangement be as described above in the case of a smaller theatre, but on the enharmonic 

system.  [Illustration]  4. In the middle range, place first at the extreme ends the vessels which give 

the note of the chromatic hyperbolaeon; next to up and down the hut; then with a resolute face, as 

though bent on proving something to somebody, put on his cap, slung his gun over his shoulder, 

and went out of the hut.  After he had gone, Olga Ivanovna lay a long time on the bed, crying. At 

first she thought it would be a good thing to poison herself, so that when Ryabovsky came back he 

would find her dead; then her imagination carried her to her drawing-room, to her husband's study, 

and she imagined herself sitting motionless beside Dymov and enjoying the physical peace

which give the chromatic diezeugmenon, a fourth below; third, the chromatic synhemmenon; 

fourth, the chromatic meson, a fourth below; fifth, the chromatic hypaton, a fourth below; sixth, the 

paramese, for this is both the concord of the fifth to the chromatic hyperbolaeon, and the 

concord[8] of the chromatic synhemmenon.  [Note 8: Codd. _diatessaron_, which is impossible, 

paramese being the concord of the fourth to the chromatic meson, and identical with the chromatic 

synhemmenon.]  5. No vessel is to be placed in the middle, for the reason that there is no other 

note in the chromatic system that forms a natural concord of sound.  In the highest division and 

range of niches, place at the extreme theatre, listening to Mazini. And a yearning for civilization, 

for the noise and bustle of the town, for celebrated people sent a pang to her heart. A peasant 

woman came into the hut and began in a leisurely way lighting the stove to get the dinner. There 

was a smell of charcoal fumes, and the air was filled with bluish smoke. The artists came in, in 

muddy high boots and with faces wet with rain, examined their sketches, and comforted 

themselves by saying that the Volga had its charms even in bad weather. On the wall the cheap 

clock went "tic-tic-tic."... The flies, feeling chilled, crowded round the ikon in the corner, buzzing, 

and one could hear the cockroaches scurrying about among the thick

vessels fashioned so as to give the note of the diatonic hyperbolaeon; next, the diatonic 

diezeugmenon, a fourth below; third, the diatonic synhemmenon; fourth, the diatonic meson, a 

fourth below; fifth, the diatonic hypaton, a fourth below; sixth, the proslambanomenos, a fourth 

below; in the middle, the note mese, for this is both the  Ryabovsky came home as the sun was 

setting. He flung his cap on the table, and, without removing his muddy boots, sank pale and 

exhausted on the bench and closed his eyes.  "I am tired..." he said, and twitched his eyebrows, 

trying to raise his eyelids.  To be nice to him and to show she was not cross, Olga Ivanovna went 

up to him,
