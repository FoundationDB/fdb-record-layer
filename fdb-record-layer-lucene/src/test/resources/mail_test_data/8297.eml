dracaena marginata companies had been sent in; but only a fraction of the n=

 companies had been sent in; but only a fraction of the need. There was no =

interested in industrial conditions--wages, old age pensions, employment in=
surance, and the like; a=20

group much like the Progressive party in the United States of 1912. We saw =
the works and ways=20

of these Socialists in every Italian town that we visited. Either they or t=
he times have done=20

wonders. And at any rate this is the first time in Italian history when ind=
ustrial prosperity has so=20

generally reached the workers that they are lifted almost bodily into the m=
iddle classes. Then there=20

are the Socialists who emphasize the land question, and they have had small=
er success than their=20

industrial brethren. We went one fine day to Frascatti by automobile. Our r=
oad took us out south of=20

Rome over the New Appian way, through fertile acres lying in a wide beautif=
ul plain. We passed=20

through half a dozen little agricultural villages, mean but picturesque. No=
ne of the splendid=20

prosperity of the cities has penetrated here. The people in these towns are=
 peasants--and look it.=20

They are the peasant people who live in the canvasses of the artists of the=
 Renaissance. Half a=20

thousand years has not changed them. Along the dusty roads we passed huge w=
ine-carts. Two=20

bell-bearing mules tandem gave warning to other passing carts of a cart's a=
pproach. The driver of=20

the cart was curled up in his shaded seat asleep. The mules took their way.=
 Carts passed and=20

repassed each other on the road. Sodomoni, Guapo, Caurimoni, and Simirimoni=
; and on the south=20

the Cuca, situate between the rock of Guaraco, which is said to throw out f=
lames, and the Cerro=20

Canclilla. Throughout this course the Orinoco continues to be three or four=
 hundred toises broad.=20

The tributary streams are most frequent on the right bank, because on that =
side the river is=20

bounded by the lofty cloud-capped mountains of Duida and Maraguaca, while t=
he left bank on the=20

contrary is low and contiguous to a plain, the general slope of which incli=
nes to the south-west.=20

The northern Cordilleras are covered with fine timber. The growth of plants=
 is so enormous in this=20

hot and constantly humid climate, that the trunks of the Bombax ceiba are s=
ixteen feet in diameter.=20

From the mouth of the Rio Padamo, which is of considerable breadth, the Ind=
ians arrive, in a day=20

and a half, at the Rio Mavaca. The latter takes its rise in the lofty mount=
ains of Unturan, and=20

communicates with a lake, on the banks of which the Portuguese* of the Rio =
Negro gather the=20

aromatic seeds of the Laurus pucheri, known in trade by the names of the pi=
churim bean, and toda=20

specie. (* The pichurim bean is the puchiri of La Condamine, which abounds =
at the Rio Xingu, a=20

tributary stream of the Amazon, and on the banks of the Hyurubaxy, or Yurub=
esh, which runs into=20

the Rio Negro. The puchery, or pichurim, which is grated like nutmeg,=20


_
frowsy, stupid looking. They all wore colour, one a crimson belt, another a=
 blue shirt, a third a red=20

handkerchief about his head. They would make better pictures than citizens,=
 we thought. In Rome=20

and Genoa the people would make better citizens than pictures. All day goin=
g to Frascatti and=20

coming home we passed these beggarly looking peasant farmers. At Frascatti,=
 which stands=20

proudly upon a great hill overlooking the Roman plain, we saw the rich acre=
s stretching away for=20

miles toward Rome and beyond it. Villages flashed in the sun, white and iri=
descent, and the=20

squares of vineyards and the tall Lombardy poplars made a landscape that re=
sted the eye and=20

soothed the soul. We stood looking at it for a long time. With us were some=
 high officials of the=20

Italian government.  "A wonderful landscape," said Henry to our hosts.  "In=
 all the world there is no=20

match for it," said Medill.  "It has lain this way for three thousand years=
, bearing crops year after=20

year!" explained our host.  "Signor," said a friend of our host, "they tell=
 me that this land yields=20

seven per cent net."  "Yes," replied our host. "I was talking to a man in t=
he agricultural department=20

about it the other day; it really nets seven per cent."  "What's this land =
worth an acre?" This=20

question came from me, who has the Kansas man's seven devil lust to put a p=
rice on land.  "Well--

I don't--" Our host looked at his Italian friends. They gazed, puzzled and =
bewildered, and consulted=20

one another. The discussion developed a curious situation. No one knew the =
price of that land.=20

With us, out in the Middle West, a boy learns the probable price of the lan=
d in his neighborhood,=20

as soon as he learns the points of the compass. Finally our host explained:=
 "The truth of the=20

matter is that this land never has been sold in the memory of living men. P=
robably most of it has=20

remained in its present ownership for from three hundred to five hundred ye=
ars. No one sells land=20

in Italy."  And that revealed much; there was the whole program of the agra=
rian Socialist. The man=20

on the wine-cart asleep, the peasant villages, the rags and the poverty, th=
e hovels that we saw on=20

the rich land and the crumbling aristocracy of Rome, living meanly, strivin=
g vainly, bewildered, and=20

bedevilled, trying to make profits out of a dormant tenantry, grinding seve=
n per cent out of the land=20

and yet losing money by it--all these things were the meat of the answer, w=
hich recounted the long=20

unbroken line of feudal ownership of the land. Wooden ploughs and oxen, wom=
en yoked with=20

beasts of burden, vines and vines planted and replanted through the centuri=
es; no capital to=20

develop the land; insufficient profits to wake up the tenants, master and s=
ervant going gradually=20

down in a world where labour and capital, sharing known in trade at Grand P=
ara by the names of=20

cucheri, cuchiri, or cravo (clavus) do Maranhao, and which, on account of i=
ts odour, is compared=20

with cloves.) Between the confluence of the Padamo and that of the Mavaca, =
the Orinoco receives=20

on the north the Ocamo, into which the Rio Matacona falls. At the sources o=
f the latter live the=20

Guainares, who are much less copper-coloured, or tawny, than the other inha=
bitants of those=20

countries. This is one of the tribes called by the missionaries fair Indian=
s (Indios blancos). Near the=20

mouth of the Ocamo, travellers are shown a rock, which is the wonder of the=
 country. It is a granite=20

passing into gneiss, and remarkable for the peculiar distribution of the bl=
ack mica, which forms=20

little ramified veins. The Spaniards call this rock Piedra Mapaya (the map-=
stone). The little=20

fragment which I procured indicated a stratified rock, rich in white feldsp=
ar, and containing,=20

together with spangles of mica, grouped in streaks, and variously twisted, =
some crystals of=20

hornblende. It is not a syenite, but probably a granite of new formation, a=
nalogous to those to=20

which the stanniferous granites (hyalomictes) and the pegmatites, or graphi=
c granites, belong.=20

Beyond the confluence of the Macava, the Orinoco suddenly diminishes in bre=
adth and depth,=20



becoming extremely sinuous, like an Alpine torrent. Its banks are surrounde=
d by mountains, and=20

the number of its tributary streams on the south augments considerably, yet=
 the Cordillera on the=20

north remains the most elevated. It requires two days to go from the mouth =
of the Macava, to the=20

Rio Gehette, the navigation being very difficult, and the boats, on account=
 of the want of water,=20

being often dragged along the shore. The tributary streams along this dista=
nce are, on the south,=20

the Daracapo and the Amaguaca; which skirt on the west and east the mountai=
ns of Guanaya and=20

Yumariquin, where the bertholletias are gathered. The Rio Manaviche flows d=
own from the=20

mountains on the north, the elevation of which diminishes progressively fro=
m the Cerro=20

Maraguaca. As we advance further up the Orinoco, the whirlpools and little =
rapids (chorros y=20

remolinos) become more and more frequent; on the north lies the Cano Chiqui=
re, inhabited by the=20

Guaicas, another tribe of white Indians; and two leagues distant is the mou=
th of the Gehette,=20

where there is a great cataract. A dyke of granitic rocks crosses the Orino=
co these rocks are, as it=20

were, the columns of Hercules, beyond which no white man has been able to p=
enetrate. It appears=20

that this point, known by the name of the great Raudal de Guaharibos, is th=
ree-quarters of a=20

degree west of Esmeralda, consequently in longitude 67 degrees 38 minutes. =
A military=20

expedition, undertaken by the commander of the fort of San Carlos, Don=20


_
a disheartening problem.  Then in due course we left Rome and went to the I=
talian army on the=20

front, and there we saw another side of the shield. From Udine in Northern =
Italy we journeyed into=20

the mountains where the Italian army at that time was holding the mountain =
tops against the=20

Austrians. Wherever we ascended we saw white ribbons of roads twining up th=
e green soft=20

mountain sides that face Italy. These roads have been made since the war. N=
early four thousand=20

miles of them furnish approaches to the Alpine heights. They are hard-surfa=
ced, low-graded, wide=20

highways gouged into the mountain side. Two automobiles may pass at full sp=
eed anywhere on=20

these roads. And all night they were alive with wagon trains bearing suppli=
es to the front. Women=20

help the men mend the roads. We saw few Austrian prisoners at work on the I=
talian roads;=20

possibly because we were too near the front line trenches to see prisoners =
who are kept thirty=20

kilos back of the line, and possibly because they have better work for the =
Austrians--work that old=20

men and women cannot do. Whenever we threaded our way up a mountain side an=
d came to a=20

top, we found its flanks tunnelled with deep wicker-walled, broad-floored, =
well-drained trenches,=20

and of the Orinoco, led to some information respecting the cataracts of the=
 Guaharibos. Bovadilla=20

had heard that some fugitive negroes from Dutch Guiana, proceeding towards =
the west (beyond=20

the isthmus between the sources of the Rio Carony and the Rio Branco) had j=
oined the=20

independent Indians. He attempted an entrada (hostile incursion) without ha=
ving obtained the=20

permission of the governor; the desire of procuring African slaves, better =
fitted for labour than the=20

copper-coloured race, was a far more powerful motive than that of zeal for =
the progress of=20

geography. Bovadilla arrived without difficulty as far as the little Raudal=
* opposite the Gehette (* It=20

is called Raudal de abaxo (Low Cataract) in opposition to the great Raudal =
de Guaharibos, which=20

is situated higher up toward the east.); but having advanced to the foot of=
 the rocky dike that forms=20

the great cataract, he was suddenly attacked, while he was breakfasting, by=
 the Guaharibos and=20

Guaycas, two warlike tribes, celebrated for the virulence of the curare wit=
h which their arrows are=20

empoisoned. The Indians occupied the rocks that rise in the middle of the r=
iver, and seeing the=20

Spaniards without bows, and having no knowledge of firearms, they provoked=
=20


_
rooms for soldiers and holes for gun barrels. Mountain top after mountain t=
op has been made into=20

a Gibraltar by the Italians. That Gibraltar was 300 miles long, before they=
 lost it to the Germans.=20

But they had few guns in their fortress. They showed us emplacement after e=
mplacement without=20

a stick of artillery in it. They had told the French and the of the latter =
were dangerously wounded,=20

and Bovadilla found himself forced to give the signal for battle. A fearful=
 carnage ensued among=20

the natives, but none of the Dutch negroes, who, as was believed, had taken=
 refuge in those parts,=20

were found. Notwithstanding a victory so easily won, the Spaniards did not =
dare to advance=20

eastward in a mountainous=20
