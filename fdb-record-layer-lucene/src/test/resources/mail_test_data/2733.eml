for themselves some of=20

the most ponderous passages in "Paradise Lost" to learn by heart, and as a =
severe punishment=20

they selected little bits of a very incomprehensible book, called Butler's =
"Analogy." When they had=20

carefully made these selections a rather feeble bell was heard to tinkle in=

Mrs. Flint. be right down."  The minister's emotions played leap-frog with =
his heart, and he=20

stumbled awkwardly on the upper step. He made some stupidly obvious observa=
tion concerning=20

the condition of the weather as he followed his hostess into the library. H=
e realized that he was=20

acting strangely for one who had reached the supposedly practical view of l=
ife where all sentiment=20

is barred from social intercourse with the fair sex, but he also realized t=
hat he was powerless to=20

check the surge of what he=20

"And I trust you have recovered from the fatigues of your long journey?" qu=
estioned Mrs. Dredge.=20

"It is a weary way from Devonshire--a long and weary way."  "You speak of i=
t as though it were a=20

kind of disappointment to come from Devonshire to London," remarked Miss Sl=
owcum, "whereas=20

London is _the_ place for aspiring souls."  "Oh, I'm so delighted to hear y=
ou say that!" With=20

kaleidoscopic rapidity there flashed through his mind every occasion when h=
e had been with Miss=20

Fox, from the first meeting beneath the elm-tree in the Captain's yard to t=
he present time, and he=20

recognized what it was that had sent scurrying his practical views of life.=
 He was in love, not with=20

the beauty of this girl, but with her. That love had come like the opening=

."  "The young=20

country servant," responded Miss Slowcum, "Sarah Jane, I think her name is-=
-oh, well, her=20

judgment need scarcely be depended on. Yes, London is the place of places. =
I have lived here for=20

years, and I ought to know."  "We quite believe you," said Jasmine--"don't =
we, Primrose?--we have=20

come up here because we quite feel with you; we are going out after lunch t=
o see the beauties of=20

the city."  "May I ask, young ladies, if this is your first visit to the me=
tropolis?" suddenly inquired=20

Mrs. Mortlock.  Primrose answered her "Yes; we have never been here before.=
"  "Then, Mrs. Flint,=20

I put it to you, is it safe to allow these young unfledged birds out into t=
his vast and bewildering=20

place? ought not some one to chaperon them?"  "We thought of asking for Pop=
py," answered=20

Jasmine.  Here Mrs. Flint frowned at her.  "Allow me to make one request, M=
iss Jasmine=20

Mainwaring; the young person you speak of is not known here by a name which=
 signifies a tare or=20

a weed. Yes, I shall be pleased to allow Sarah to go out with you this afte=
rnoon for a short time,=20

but she knows as little of London as you do. I cannot go myself, as Friday =
is a busy afternoon. I=20

can, however, give you a map, and if you all keep close together and don't =
wander too far, and are=20

careful only to inquire of policemen your destination you may get back safe=
ly. Don't forget, tea at=20

six."  Here Miss Slowcum, turning her eyes slowly, looked carefully all ove=
r the and gently=20

disturbing his emotional equilibrium, but with accumulative effect the tran=
sitions had come with the=20

passing weeks, till now every interest in his life seemed to be pouring out=
 into the one emotion he=20

felt.  Elizabeth had preceded him into the library, and was standing motion=
less before the mantel.=20

She became suddenly aware of what was going on within the mind of Mr. McGow=
an, and a shy=20

embarrassment crept into her eyes.  Simultaneously, an unreasoning determin=
ation took=20

possession of the minister. Unconsciously, he began to move in her directio=
n, unmindful of the=20

sound of footfalls on the stair. Only one step remained between Mr. McGowan=
 and Elizabeth when=20

Elder Fox entered the room.  "I trust I'm not intruding----"  The Elder beg=
an nervously to stroke his=20

chops. His breath came heavily, shutting off his words. A hunted look leape=
d into his eyes as he=20

studied the tense face of the eager young man. Could it be possible that th=
e fears of the Reverend=20

Mr. Means--privately made known to the Elder after the installation service=
--had foundation in=20

fact? Or had the suggestion of Mr. Means lodged in the Elder's mind, playin=
g havoc with his=20

imagination?  Mr. McGowan drew off to the far end of the mantel, and began,=
 figuratively, to kick=20

himself. He had often declared that a man in love was the biggest mule on e=
arth, and now here he=20

was, the king of them all, a genuine descendant of Balaam's mount with all =
his asinine qualities,=20

but lacking his common mule sense.  "I--I beg your pardon," he=20
