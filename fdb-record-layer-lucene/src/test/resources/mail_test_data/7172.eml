NG. [Rushing to the=20

window.] On fire!  MANDERS. On fire! Impossible! I've just come from there.=
  OSWALD. Where's=20

my hat? Oh, never mind it--Father's Orphanage--! [He rushes out through the=
 garden door.]  MRS.=20

ALVING. My shawl, Regina! The whole place is in a blaze!  MANDERS. Terrible=
! Mrs. Alving, it is=20

a judgment upon this abode of lawlessness.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, of course. Co=
me, Regina. [She=20

and REGINA hasten out through the hall.]  MANDERS. [Clasps his hands togeth=
er.] And we left it=20

uninsured! [He goes out the same way.]     ACT THIRD.  [The room as before.=
 All the doors stand=20

open. The lamp is still burning on the table. It is dark out of doors; ther=
e is only a faint glow from=20

the conflagration in the background to the left.]  [MRS. ALVING, with a sha=
wl over her head,=20

stands in the conservatory, looking out. REGINA, also with a shawl on, stan=
ds a little behind her.]=20

MRS. ALVING. The whole thing burnt!--burnt to the ground!  REGINA. The base=
ment is still=20

burning.  MRS. ALVING. How is it Oswald doesn't come home? There's nothing =
to be saved.=20

REGINA. Should you like me to take down his hat to him?  MRS. ALVING. Has h=
e not even got=20

his hat on?  REGINA. [Pointing to the hall.] No; there it hangs.  MRS. ALVI=
NG. Let it be. He must=20

come up now. I shall go and look for him myself. [She goes out through the =
garden door.]=20

MANDERS. [Comes in from the hall.] Is not Mrs. Alving here?  REGINA. She ha=
s just gone down=20

the garden.  MANDERS. This is the most terrible night I ever went through. =
 REGINA. Yes; isn't it=20

a dreadful misfortune, sir?  MANDERS. Oh, don't talk about it! I can hardly=
 bear to think of it.=20

REGINA. How can it have happened--?  MANDERS. Don't ask me, Miss Engstrand!=
 How should=20

_I_ know? Do you, too--? Is it not enough that your father--?  REGINA. What=
 about him?=20

MANDERS. Oh, he has driven me distracted--  ENGSTRAND. [Enters through the =
hall.] Your=20

Reverence--  MANDERS. [Turns round in terror.] Are you after me here, too? =
 ENGSTRAND. Yes,=20

strike me dead, but I must--! Oh, Lord! what am I saying? But this is a ter=
rible ugly business, your=20

Reverence.  MANDERS. [Walks to and fro.] Alas! alas!  REGINA. What's the ma=
tter?=20

ENGSTRAND. Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see. [Softly.]=
 The bird's limed, my=20

girl. [Aloud.] And to think it should be my doing that such a thing should =
be his Reverence's doing!=20

MANDERS. But I assure you, Engstrand--  ENGSTRAND. There wasn't another sou=
l except your=20

Reverence as ever laid a finger on the candles down there.  MANDERS. [Stops=
.] So you declare.=20

But I certainly cannot recollect that I ever had a candle in my hand.  ENGS=
TRAND. And I saw as=20

clear as daylight how your Reverence took the candle and snuffed it with yo=
ur fingers, and threw=20

away the snuff among the shavings.  MANDERS. And you stood and looked on?  =
ENGSTRAND.=20

Yes; I saw it as plain as a pike-staff, I did.  MANDERS. It's quite beyond =
my comprehension.=20

Besides, it has never been my habit to snuff candles with my fingers.  ENGS=
TRAND. And terrible=20

risky it looked, too, that it did! But is there such a deal of harm done af=
ter all, your Reverence?=20

MANDERS. [Walks restlessly to and fro.] Oh, don't ask me!  ENGSTRAND. [Walk=
s with him.] And=20

your Reverence hadn't insured it, neither?  MANDERS. [Continuing to walk up=
 and down.] No, no,=20

no; I have told you so.  ENGSTRAND. [Following him.] Not insured! And then =
to go straight away=20

down and set light to the whole thing! Lord, Lord, what a misfortune!  MAND=
ERS. [Wipes the=20

sweat from his forehead.] Ay, you may well say that, Engstrand.  ENGSTRAND.=
 And to think that=20

such a thing should happen to a benevolent Institution, that was to have be=
en a blessing both to=20

town and country, as the saying goes! The newspapers won't be for handling =
your Reverence very=20

gently, I expect.  MANDERS. No; that is just what I am thinking of. That is=
 almost the worst of the=20



whole matter. All the malignant attacks and imputations--! Oh, it makes me =
shudder to think of it!=20

MRS. ALVING. [Comes in from the garden.] He is not to be persuaded to leave=
 the fire.=20

MANDERS. Ah, there you are, Mrs. Alving.  MRS. ALVING. So you have escaped =
your Inaugural=20

Address, Pastor Manders.  MANDERS. Oh, I should so gladly--  MRS. ALVING. [=
In an undertone.]=20

It is all for the best. That Orphanage would have done no one any good.  MA=
NDERS. Do you think=20

not?  MRS. ALVING. Do you think it would?  MANDERS. It is a terrible misfor=
tune, all the same.=20

MRS. ALVING. Let us speak of it plainly, as a matter of business.--Are you =
waiting for Mr.=20

Manders, Engstrand?  ENGSTRAND. [At the hall door.] That's just what I'm a-=
doing of, ma'am.=20

MRS. ALVING. Then sit down meanwhile.  ENGSTRAND. Thank you, ma'am; I'd as =
soon stand.=20

MRS. ALVING. [To MANDERS.] I suppose you are going by the steamer?  MANDERS=
. Yes; it=20

starts in an hour.  MRS. ALVING. Then be so good as to take all the papers =
with you. I won't hear=20

another word about this affair. I have other things to think of--  MANDERS.=
 Mrs. Alving--  MRS.=20

ALVING. Later on I shall send you a Power of Attorney to settle everything =
as you please.=20

MANDERS. That I will very readily undertake. The original destination of th=
e endowment must now=20

be completely changed, alas!  MRS. ALVING. Of course it must.  MANDERS. I t=
hink, first of all, I=20

shall arrange that the Solvik property shall pass to the parish. The land i=
s by no means without=20

value. It can always be turned to account for some purpose or other. And th=
e interest of the money=20

in the Bank I could, perhaps, best apply for the benefit of some undertakin=
g of acknowledged=20

value to the town.  MRS. ALVING. Do just as you please. The whole matter is=
 now completely=20

indifferent to me.  ENGSTRAND. Give a thought to my Sailors' Home, your Rev=
erence.=20

MANDERS. Upon my word, that is not a bad suggestion. That must be considere=
d.=20

ENGSTRAND. Oh, devil take considering--Lord forgive me!  MANDERS. [With a s=
igh.] And=20

unfortunately I cannot tell how long I shall be able to retain control of t=
hese things--whether public=20

opinion may not compel me to retire. It entirely depends upon the result of=
 the official inquiry into=20

the fire--  MRS. ALVING. What are you talking about?  MANDERS. And the resu=
lt can by no=20

means be foretold.  ENGSTRAND. [Comes close to him.] Ay, but it can though.=
 For here stands=20

old Jacob Engstrand.  MANDERS. Well well, but--?  ENGSTRAND. [More softy.] =
And Jacob=20

Engstrand isn't the man to desert a noble benefactor in the hour of need, a=
s the saying goes.=20

MANDERS. Yes, but my good fellow--how--?  ENGSTRAND. Jacob Engstrand may be=
 likened to=20

a sort of a guardian angel, he may, your Reverence.  MANDERS. No, no; I rea=
lly cannot accept=20

that.  ENGSTRAND. Oh, that'll be the way of it, all the same. I know a man =
as has taken others'=20

sins upon himself before now, I do.  MANDERS. Jacob! [Wrings his hand.] You=
rs is a rare nature.=20

Well, you shall be helped with your Sailors' Home. That you may rely upon. =
[ENGSTRAND tries to=20

thank him, but cannot for emotion.]  MANDERS. [Hangs his travelling-bag ove=
r his shoulder.] And=20

now let us set out. We two will go together.  ENGSTRAND. [At the dining-roo=
m door, softly to=20

REGINA.] You come along too, my lass. You shall live as snug as the yolk in=
 an egg.  REGINA.=20

[Tosses her head.] _Merci_! [She goes out into the hall and fetches MANDERS=
' overcoat.]=20

MANDERS. Good-bye, Mrs. Alving! and may the spirit of Law and Order descend=
 upon this house,=20

and that quickly.  MRS. ALVING. Good-bye, Pastor Manders. [She goes up towa=
rds the=20

conservatory, as she sees OSWALD coming in through the garden door.]  ENGST=
RAND. [While=20

he and REGINA help MANDERS to get his coat on.] Good-bye, my child. And if =
any trouble should=20

come to you, you know where Jacob Engstrand is to be found. [Softly.] Littl=
e Harbour Street, h'm--!=20



[To MRS. ALVING and OSWALD.] And the refuge for wandering mariners shall be=
 called=20

"Chamberlain Alving's Home," that it shall! And if so be as I'm spared to c=
arry on that house in my=20

own way, I make so bold as to promise that it shall be worthy of the Chambe=
rlain's memory.=20

MANDERS. [In the doorway.] H'm--h'm!--Come along, my dear Engstrand. Good-b=
ye! Good-bye!=20

[He and ENGSTRAND go out through the hall.]  OSWALD. [Goes towards the tabl=
e.] What house=20

was he talking about?  MRS. ALVING. Oh, a kind of Home that he and Pastor M=
anders want to set=20

up.  OSWALD. It will burn down like the other.  MRS. ALVING. What makes you=
 think so?=20

OSWALD. Everything will burn. All that recalls father's memory is doomed. H=
ere am I, too, burning=20

down. [REGINA starts and looks at him.]  MRS. ALVING. Oswald! You oughtn't =
to have remained=20

so long down communicate. Good-day.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGood-day, General,=
=E2=80=9D was the response, and with a=20

military salute General Grant turned and rode away.  As he rode forward and=
 halted at the porch to=20

make this inquiry, I had my wished-for opportunity, but my eyes sought his =
face in vain for any=20

indication of what was passing in his mind. Whatever may have been there, a=
s Colonel Newhall=20

has well written, =E2=80=9Cnot a muscle of his face told tales on his thoug=
hts=E2=80=9D; and if he felt any elation,=20

neither his voice, features, nor his eyes betrayed it. Once out of the gate=
, General Grant, followed=20

by his staff, turned to the left and moved off at a rapid trot.  General Le=
e continued on his way=20

toward his army at a walk, to be received by his devoted troops with cheers=
 and tears, and to sit=20

down and pen a farewell order that, to this day, no old soldier of the Army=
 of Northern Virginia can=20

read without moistening eyes and swelling throat.  General Grant, on his wa=
y to his field=20

headquarters on this eventful Sunday evening, dismounted, sat quietly down =
by the roadside, and=20

wrote a short and simple despatch, which a galloping aide bore at full spee=
d to the nearest=20

telegraph station. On its reception in the nation=E2=80=99s capital this de=
spatch was flashed over the wires=20

to every hamlet in the country, causing every steeple in the North to rock =
to its foundation, and=20

sending one tall, gaunt, sad-eyed, weary-hearted man in Washington to his k=
nees, thanking God=20

that he had lived to see the beginning of the end, and that he had at last =
been vouchsafed the=20

assurance that he had led his people aright.   SYNOPSIS OF THE PRINCIPAL EV=

re than a century=20

the island of Cuba had been an object of peculiar interest and concern to t=
he United States.[272]=20

During the first part of the nineteenth century the fear was that Cuba migh=
t be acquired by Great=20

Britain or France, and thus a strong European power would be established at=
 the very gate of the=20

American republic. Manifestly, it was then the policy of the United States =
to guarantee the=20

possession of the island to Spain. But after the Mexican War the idea of ex=
territorial expansion=20

entered more and more largely into American statesmanship. The South looked=
 upon Cuba as a=20

desirable addition to slave-holding territory, and it was apparent to every=
 eye that the island=20

occupied an all-important strategic position in relation to the proposed ca=
nal routes across the=20

Isthmus of Panama.  In 1822 propositions for annexation came from Cuba to t=
he United States,=20

and Monroe sent an agent to investigate. Later, annexation was a recurrent =
subject favored by the=20

South, which saw a field for the extension of slavery. In 1848 the American=
 minister at Madrid was=20

instructed by President Polk to sound the Spanish government upon the quest=
ion of sale or=20

cession. But Spain declined even to consider such a proposition. In 1854 th=
e so-called =E2=80=9COstend=20

Manifesto,=E2=80=9D drawn up by James Buchanan,=20

my poor boy.  OSWALD. [Sits down by the table.] I almost think you are righ=

OSWALD. [Stares indifferently in front of him.] Thanks, mother.  MRS. ALVIN=

Oswald? Should you like to sleep?  OSWALD. [Nervously.] No, no--not to slee=

only pretend to. [Sadly.] That will come soon enough.  MRS. ALVING. [Lookin=

Yes, you really are ill, my blessed boy.  REGINA. [Eagerly.] Is Mr. Alving =

hen he was a=20

young lieutenant. He was brimming over with the joy of life!  OSWALD. Yes, =
I know he was.  MRS.=20

ALVING. It was like a breezy day only to look at him. And what exuberant st=
rength and vitality=20

there was in him!  OSWALD. Well--?  MRS. ALVING. Well then, child of joy as=
 he was--for he was=20

like a child in those days--he had to live at home here in a half-grown tow=
n, which had no joys to=20

offer him--only dissipations. He had no object in life--only an official po=
sition. He had no work into=20

which he could throw himself heart and soul; he had only business. He had n=
ot a single comrade=20

that could realise what the joy of life meant--only loungers and boon-compa=
nions--  OSWALD.=20

Mother--!  MRS. ALVING. So the inevitable happened.  OSWALD. The inevitable=
?  MRS. ALVING.=20

You told me yourself, this evening, what would become of you if you stayed =
at home.  OSWALD.=20

Do you mean to say that father--?  MRS. ALVING. Your poor father found no o=
utlet for the=20

overpowering joy of life that was in him. And I brought no brightness into =
his home.  OSWALD. Not=20

even you?  MRS. ALVING. They had taught me a great deal about duties and so=
 forth, which I=20

went on obstinately believing in. Everything was marked out into duties--in=
to my duties, and his=20

duties, and--I am afraid I made his home intolerable for your poor father, =
Oswald.  OSWALD. Why=20

have you never spoken of this in writing to me?  MRS. ALVING. I have never =
before seen it in=20

such a light that I could speak of it to you, his son.  OSWALD. In what lig=
ht did you see it, then?=20

MRS. ALVING. [Slowly.] I saw only this one thing: that your father was a br=
oken-down man before=20

you were born.  OSWALD. [Softly.] Ah--! [He rises and walks away to the win=
dow.]  MRS.=20



ALVING. And then; day after day, I dwelt on the one thought that by rights =
Regina should be at=20

home in this house--just like my own boy.  OSWALD. [Turning round quickly.]=
 Regina--!  REGINA.=20

[Springs up and asks, with bated breath.] I--?  MRS. ALVING. Yes, now you k=
now it, both of you.=20

OSWALD. Regina!  REGINA. [To herself.] So mother was that kind of woman.  M=
RS. ALVING.=20

Your mother had many good qualities, Regina.  REGINA. Yes, but she was one =
of that sort, all the=20

same. Oh, I've often suspected it; but--And now, if you please, ma'am, may =
I be allowed to go=20

away at once?  MRS. ALVING. Do you really wish it, Regina?  REGINA. Yes, in=
deed I do.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Of course you can do as you like; but--  OSWALD. [Goes towards REGI=
NA.] Go away=20

now? Your place is here.  REGINA. _Merci_, Mr. Alving!--or now, I suppose, =
I may say Oswald.=20

But I can tell you this wasn't at all what I expected.  MRS. ALVING. Regina=
, I have not been frank=20

with you--  REGINA. No, that you haven't indeed. If I'd known that Oswald w=
as an invalid, why--

And now, too, that it can never come to anything serious between us--I real=
ly can't stop out here in=20

the country and wear myself out nursing sick people.  OSWALD. Not even one =
who is so near to=20

you?  REGINA. No, that I can't. A poor girl must make the best of her young=
 days, or she'll be left=20

out in the cold before she knows where she is. And I, too, have the joy of =
life in me, Mrs. Alving!=20

MRS. ALVING. Unfortunately, you leave. But don't throw yourself away, Regin=
a.  REGINA. Oh,=20

what must be, must be. If Oswald takes after his father, I take after my mo=
ther, I daresay.--May I=20

ask, ma'am, if Pastor Manders knows all this about me?  MRS. ALVING. Pastor=
 Manders knows=20

all about it.  REGINA. [Busied in putting on her shawl.] Well then, I'd bet=
ter make haste and get=20

away by this steamer. The Pastor is such a nice man to deal with; and I cer=
tainly think I've as=20

much right to a little of that money as he has--that brute of a carpenter. =
 MRS. ALVING. You are=20

heartily welcome to it, Regina.  REGINA. [Looks hard at her.] I think you m=
ight have brought me=20

up as a gentleman's daughter, ma'am; it would have suited me better. [Tosse=
s her head.] But=20

pooh--what does it matter! [With a bitter side glance at the corked bottle.=
] I may come to drink=20

champagne with gentlefolks yet.  MRS. ALVING. And if you ever need a home, =
Regina, come to=20

me.  REGINA. No, thank you, ma'am. Pastor Manders will look after me, I kno=
w. And if the worst=20

comes to the worst, I know of one house where I've every right to a place. =
 MRS. ALVING. Where=20

is that?  REGINA. "Chamberlain Alving's Home."  MRS. ALVING. Regina--now I =
see it--you are=20

going to your ruin.  REGINA. Oh, stuff! Good-bye. [She nods and goes out th=
rough the hall.]=20

OSWALD. [Stands at the window and looks out.] Is she gone?  MRS. ALVING. Ye=
s.  OSWALD.=20

[Murmuring aside to himself.] I think it was a mistake, this.  MRS. ALVING.=
 [Goes up behind him=20

and lays her hands on his shoulders.] Oswald, my dear boy--has it shaken yo=
u very much?=20

OSWALD. [Turns his face towards her.] All that about father, do you mean?  =
MRS. ALVING. Yes,=20

about your unhappy father. I am so afraid it may have been too much for you=
.  OSWALD. Why=20

should you fancy that? Of course it came upon me as a great surprise; but i=
t can make no real=20

difference to me.  MRS. ALVING. [Draws her hands away.] No difference! That=
 your father was so=20

infinitely unhappy!  OSWALD. Of course I can pity him, as I would anybody e=
lse; but--  MRS.=20

ALVING. Nothing more! Your own father!  OSWALD. [Impatiently.]Oh, "father,"=
--"father"! I never=20

knew anything of father. I remember nothing about him, except that he once =
made me sick.  MRS.=20

ALVING. This is terrible to think of! Ought not a son to love his father, w=
hatever happens?=20

OSWALD. When a son has nothing to thank his father for? has never known him=
? Do you really=20

cling to that old superstition?--you who are so enlightened in other ways? =
 MRS. ALVING. Can it=20



be only a superstition--?  OSWALD. Yes; surely you can see that, mother. It=
's one of those notions=20

that are current in the world, and so--  MRS. ALVING. [Deeply moved.] Ghost=
s!  OSWALD.=20

[Crossing the room.] Yes; you may call them ghosts.  MRS. ALVING. [Wildly.]=
 Oswald--then you=20

don't love me, either!  OSWALD. You I know, at any rate--  MRS. ALVING. Yes=
, you know me; but=20

is that all!  OSWALD. And, of course, I know how fond you are of me, and I =
can't but be grateful to=20

you. And then you can be so useful to me, now that I am ill.  MRS. ALVING. =
Yes, cannot I,=20

Oswald? Oh, I could almost bless the illness that has driven you home to me=
. For I see very=20

plainly that you are not mine: I have to win you.  OSWALD. [Impatiently.] Y=
es yes yes; all these=20

are just so many phrases. You must remember that I am a sick man, mother. I=
 can't be much=20

taken up with other people; I have enough to do thinking about myself.  MRS=
. ALVING. [In a low=20

voice.] I shall be patient and easily satisfied.  OSWALD. And cheerful too,=
 mother!  MRS. ALVING.=20

Yes, my dear boy, you are quite right. [Goes towards him.] Have I relieved =
you of all remorse and=20

self-reproach now?  OSWALD. Yes, you have. But now who will relieve me of t=
he dread?  MRS.=20

ALVING. The dread?  OSWALD. [Walks across the room.] Regina could have been=
 got to do it.=20

MRS. ALVING. I don't understand you. What is this about dread--and Regina? =
 OSWALD. Is it=20

very late, mother?  MRS. ALVING. It is early morning. [She looks out throug=
h the conservatory.]=20

The day is dawning over the mountains. And the weather is clearing, Oswald.=
 In a little while you=20

shall see the sun.  OSWALD. I'm glad of that. Oh, I may still have much to =
rejoice in and live for--=20

MRS. ALVING. I should think so, indeed!  OSWALD. Even if I can't work--  MR=
S. ALVING. Oh,=20

you'll soon be able to work again, my dear boy--now that you haven't got al=
l those gnawing and=20

depressing thoughts to brood over any longer.  OSWALD. Yes, I'm glad you we=
re able to rid me of=20

all those fancies. And when I've got over this one thing more--[Sits on the=
 sofa.] Now we will have=20

a little talk, mother--  MRS. ALVING. Yes, let us. [She pushes an arm-chair=
 towards the sofa, and=20

sits down close to him.]  OSWALD. And meantime the sun will be rising. And =
then you will know=20

all. And then I shall not feel this dread any longer.  MRS. ALVING. What is=
 it that I am to know?=20

OSWALD. [Not listening to her.] Mother, did you not say a little while ago,=
 that there was nothing in=20

the world you would not do for me, if I asked you?  MRS. ALVING. Yes, indee=
d I said so!=20

OSWALD. And you'll stick to it, mother?  MRS. ALVING. You may rely on that,=
 my dear and only=20

boy! I have nothing in the world to live for but you alone.  OSWALD. Very w=
ell, then; now you shall=20

hear--Mother, you have a strong, steadfast mind, I know. Now you're to sit =
quite still when you=20

hear it.  MRS. ALVING. What dreadful thing can it be--?  OSWALD. You're not=
 to scream out. Do=20

you hear? Do you promise me that? We will sit and talk about it quietly. Do=
 you promise me,=20

mother?  MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes; I promise. Only speak!  OSWALD. Well, you m=
ust know that all=20

this fatigue--and my inability to think of work--all that is not the illnes=
s itself--  MRS. ALVING. Then=20

what is the illness itself?  OSWALD. The disease I have as my birthright--[=
He points to his=20

forehead and adds very softly]--is seated here.  MRS. ALVING. [Almost voice=
less.] Oswald! No--

no!  OSWALD. Don't scream. I can't bear it. Yes, mother, it is seated here =
waiting. And it may=20

break out any day--at any moment.  MRS. ALVING. Oh, what horror--!  OSWALD.=
 Now, quiet,=20

quiet. That is how it stands with me--  MRS. ALVING. [Springs up.] It's not=
 true, Oswald! It's=20

impossible! It cannot be so!  OSWALD. I have had one attack down there alre=
ady. It was soon=20

over. But when I came to know the state I had been in, then the dread desce=
nded upon me, raging=20

and ravening; and so I set off home to you as fast as I could.  MRS. ALVING=
. Then this is the=20



dread--!  OSWALD. Yes--it's so indescribably loathsome, you know. Oh, if it=
 had only been an=20

ordinary mortal disease--! For I'm not so afraid of death--though I should =
like to live as long as I=20

can.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, yes, Oswald, you must!  OSWALD. But this is so unut=
terably loathsome.=20

To become a little baby again! To have to be fed! To have to--Oh, it's not =
to be spoken of!  MRS.=20

ALVING. The child has his mother to nurse him.  OSWALD. [Springs up.] No, n=
ever that! That is=20

just what I will not have. I can't endure to think that perhaps I should li=
e in that state for many=20

years--and get old and grey. And in the meantime you might die and leave me=
. [Sits in MRS.=20

ALVING'S chair.] For the doctor said it wouldn't necessarily prove fatal at=
 once. He called it a sort=20

of softening of the brain--or something like that. [Smiles sadly.] I think =
that expression sounds so=20

nice. It States ministers to England, France, and Spain), declared in plain=
 language that the =E2=80=9CUnion=20

can never enjoy repose nor possess reliable security as long as Cuba is not=
 embraced within its=20

boundaries.=E2=80=9D It went on to advise the seizing of the coveted territ=
ory in case Spain refused to sell.=20

The administration of President Pierce never directly sanctioned the propos=
ition advanced in such=20

extraordinary terms, and Marcy, the Secretary of State, repudiated it unqua=
lifiedly. So the matter=20

fell again into abeyance until in 1873 the _Virginius_, an American schoone=
r suspected of=20

conveying arms and ammunition to the Cuban insurgents, was captured by a Sp=
anish gunboat=20

and taken to Havana. As a result of the trial, many insurgents, together wi=
th six British subjects=20

and thirty American citizens, were executed. For a time international compl=
ications seemed=20

certain, but finally Spain made proper apologies and surrendered the _Virgi=
nius_ and the survivors=20

of her crew.  The Cuban =E2=80=9CTen Years=E2=80=99 War,=E2=80=9D from 1868=
 to 1878, was characterized by great cruelty=20

and destructive losses of life and property in which American interests wer=
e now deeply involved.=20

President Grant seriously considered and even threatened intervention, whic=
h would have meant=20

annexation; but Spain promised definite reforms, and the old conditions wer=
e continued.  When=20

the insurrection of 1895 began, American citizens owned at least fifty mill=
ions of property in the=20

island, and American commerce amounted to a hundred millions annually. Both=
 on the Spanish=20

and Cuban side outrages were of daily occurrence, and the situation quickly=
 became intolerable.=20

The McKinley administration ventured upon a mild remonstrance against the i=
nhumanities of=20

Captain-General Weyler, and the Spanish authorities replied evasively. Fina=
lly the United States=20

formally offered its good offices for the adjustment of Cuban affairs, pres=
umably on a basis of=20

independence. Spain declared that it was her intention to grant autonomy to=
 the island, and the=20

decree was actually published on November 27, 1897. But it was now too late=
, and the unhappy=20

conditions grew worse day by day.  There had been riots at Havana itself, a=
nd it was thought=20

advisable to send the United States cruiser _Maine_ on a friendly visit to =
that port. The _Maine_=20

arrived at Havana on January 25, 1898. On the night of February 15th the _M=
aine_ was blown up=20

while lying at her harbor moorings, with a ghastly loss of life. The Americ=
an Court of Inquiry found=20

that the ship was destroyed from the outside; the Spanish inquiry resulted =
in a verdict that the ship=20

was destroyed from causes within herself. At the time there was an outburst=
 of passion throughout=20

the United States, and Spain was held guilty of an atrocious crime. While t=
he exact cause of the=20

disaster has never been finally determined, it is the verdict of calmer and=
 more distant=20

consideration that official Spain must be acquitted, although the belief re=
mains on the part of the=20

American naval authorities that the _Maine_ was blown up from outside. At t=
he time, however, this=20

tragedy powerfully reinforced the efforts of Cubans and the pressure of fin=
ancial interests to=20



secure American support. When Senator Redfield Proctor, of Vermont, a man o=
f peculiarly=20

dispassionate temperament, made public his account of the suffering which h=
e had witnessed=20

among the _reconcentrados_ (collections of native Cubans, particularly wome=
n and children,=20

herded together by Spanish troops), the sympathies of Americans were stirre=
d even more deeply.=20

Ministers preached intervention from their pulpits. Many newspapers demande=
d intervention.=20

Yellow journals clamored for an ultimatum backed by arms. Congress was carr=
ied away by the=20

wave of intense feeling, although President McKinley thought that a solutio=
n could be reached=20

without an appeal to arms--a belief in which the final verdict of history w=
ill probably agree, although=20

it was inevitable that Spain should resign control of Cuba. But the Preside=
nt was powerless=20

against the popular sentiment.  On April 25th war with Spain was formally d=
eclared, and for the=20

first time in over three-quarters of a century the republic of the West fou=
nd itself arrayed in arms=20

against a European nation.  The situation had its peculiar features. It had=
 been assumed that the=20

principal theatre of conflict would be the island of Cuba, and consequently=
 the American campaign=20

must be one of invasion. But the Spaniards, owing to the civil war in the c=
olony, were in virtually=20

the same position--fighting at a distance from their base of supplies.  In =
material resources the=20

United States ranked immeasurably superior. True, the numerical strength of=
 the regular army was=20

small, but behind it stood thousands of State militia and millions of avail=
able reserves. Moreover,=20

the United States was classed among the richest of nations and Spain among =
the poorest. So far=20

as the land operations were concerned, the final issue could not be doubtfu=
l.  In naval strength,=20

however, there was less disparity. On paper the United States ranked sixth =
among the world=20

powers, while Spain occupied eighth place. But the United States, with its =
thousands of miles of=20

coast on both the Atlantic and the Pacific seaboards, was unquestionably vu=
lnerable. Coast=20

defences were admittedly inadequate, and it was conceivable that one swift =
dash by a Spanish=20

squadron might endanger millions of property at Boston, New York, and Balti=
more; at San=20

Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.  The situation on the Pacific coast seeme=
d even more delicate=20

than that on the Eastern seaboard. There was a formidable Spanish squadron =
at Manila in the=20

Philippine Islands, and all depended upon the fighting ability of the Ameri=
can Pacific fleet; if Dewey=20

failed, the Western States of America were absolutely at the mercy of the e=
nemy.  For more than a=20

month Commodore Dewey had lain with his fleet in the harbor of Hong-Kong, w=
aiting for events to=20

shape themselves. In anticipation of the coming strife, and the consequent =
declaration of neutrality=20

on the part of Great Britain, the American commander had purchased two tran=
sport steamers,=20

together with ten thousand tons of coal. He was thus prepared for prompt an=
d decisive action.=20

War had been declared on April 25th, and the American squadron immediately =
left Hong-Kong for=20

Mirs Bay, some thirty miles away. On April 26th Commodore Dewey received th=
e following=20

despatch:                      =E2=80=9CWASHINGTON, _April 26_.    =E2=80=
=9CDEWEY, ASIATIC SQUADRON,--

Commence operations at once,   particularly against the Spanish fleet. You =
must capture or=20

destroy   them.                                    MCKINLEY.=E2=80=9D  On A=
pril 27th the American fleet sailed for=20

Manila, six hundred and twenty-eight miles away, and on the morning of Satu=
rday, April 30th,=20

Luzon was sighted, and the ships were ordered to clear for action.  Under C=
ommodore George=20

Dewey were the _Olympia_, the _Boston_, the _Petrel_, the _Concord_, the _R=
aleigh_, and the=20

_Baltimore_. The only armored vessel in the squadron was the _Olympia_, the=
 protecting belting,=20

four inches thick, being around the turret guns. The auxiliary force was ma=
de up of the revenue-



cutter _McCulloch_ and two transports, the _Vaughan_ and the _Zafiro_. Alto=
gether, the American=20

fighting force included four cruisers, two gunboats, fifty-seven classified=
 big guns, seventy-four=20

rapid-fire and machine guns, and 1808 men. On the other side, Rear-Admiral =
Montojo=20

commanded seven cruisers, five gunboats, two torpedo-boats, fifty-two class=
ified big guns, eighty-

three rapid-fire and machine guns, and 1948 men. It will thus be seen that =
the Americans mounted=20

a few more heavy guns, but the Spanish had several more ships and over a hu=
ndred more men.=20

Moreover, the Spanish ships were assisted by the fort and land batteries at=
 Manila, and they also=20

possessed the great advantage of range-marks. Finally, the ship-channels we=
re supposed to be=20

amply protected by mines and submarine batteries. After satisfying himself =
that the ships of the=20

enemy were not in Subig Bay, Commodore Dewey resolved to enter Manila Bay t=
he same night. It=20

was known that the channel had been mined, but that risk must be taken. Wit=
h all lights except the=20

stern ones extinguished, the American vessels steamed steadily onward; fina=
lly, Corregidor Island,=20

with its lofty light-house, came into view, and the fleet swept into the ma=
in ship-channel known as=20

the Boca Grande.  Up to this point no sign had been made by the enemy that =
the approach of the=20

American ships had been discovered, although the night was moonlit and it w=
as only a little after=20

eleven o=E2=80=99clock. Then a fireman on the _McCulloch_ threw some soft c=
oal in the furnace and a=20

shower of sparks flew from the cutter=E2=80=99s funnel. A solitary rocket a=
scended from Corregidor, and=20

there was an answering light from the mainland. At a quarter-past eleven a =
bugle sounded, and=20

from the shore batteries came a blinding glare, followed by the boom of a h=
eavy gun--the first shot=20

of the Spanish-American War.  The _Raleigh_ had the honor of replying for t=
he American side,=20

and the _Boston_ followed quickly. A well-aimed six-inch shell from the _Co=
ncord_ plumped into=20

the Spanish fort; there was a crash and a cry, and all was still. The forts=
 had been silenced.  At=20

slow speed the squadron moved onward, for Commodore Dewey did not wish to a=
rrive at Manila=20

before dawn. Some of the men managed to get a little sleep, but the ever-pr=
esent danger of=20

torpedoes and the excitement of the approaching battle were not conducive t=
o peaceful slumbers.=20

The morning of Sunday, May 1st, dawned clear and beautiful, although the da=
y promised to be=20

hot. The squadron found itself directly across the bay from the city of Man=
ila; and there, under the=20

guns of Cavit=C3=A9, lay the Spanish fleet.  [Illustration: BATTLE OF MANIL=
A BAY]  According to=20

Commodore Dewey=E2=80=99s report, the shore batteries began firing at a qua=
rter-past five. The=20

_Olympia_, flying the signal =E2=80=9CRemember the Maine,=E2=80=9D led the =
American column, followed closely by=20

the _Baltimore_, _Raleigh_, _Petrel_, _Concord_, and _Boston_ in the order =
named. The ships=20

came on in a line approximately parallel to that of the enemy, reserving th=
eir fire until within=20

effective range. As the fleet advanced two submarine mines were exploded, b=
ut neither did any=20

damage. At twenty minutes to six Commodore Dewey shouted to Captain Gridley=
 in the conning-

tower of the flag-ship: =E2=80=9CFire as soon as you get ready, Gridley.=E2=
=80=9D Instantly the _Olympia_ discharged=20

her broadside, the _Baltimore_ followed the lead, and each successive ship =
in turn discharged=20

every gun that could be brought to bear. The Spanish returned the fire with=
 great energy, but with=20

inconclusive results. Several of the American ships were struck, but no cas=
ualties followed.=20

Lieutenant Brumby, of the flag-ship, had the signal halliards shot out of h=
is hands; a shot passed=20

clean through the _Baltimore_, and another smashed into the foremast of the=
 _Boston_.=20

Incessantly firing, the battle-line steamed past the whole length of the st=
ationary Spanish fleet,=20

then swung slowly around and began the countermarch. Once Montojo=E2=80=99s=
 flag-ship, the _Reina=20



Cristina_, made a desperate attempt to leave the line and engage at close q=
uarters, but she was=20

quickly driven back.  A little after half-past seven the American commander=
 ordered the firing to be=20

stopped, and the fleet headed for the eastern side of the bay for breakfast=
 and a redistribution of=20

ammunition for the big guns. The Spaniards, seeing the withdrawal of the Am=
erican vessels,=20

rashly concluded that the enemy had been repulsed and raised a feeble cheer=
. In reality they were=20

hopelessly beaten: several of their ships were on fire, the decks of all we=
re covered with dead and=20

dying men, and ammunition was running low.  At a quarter-past eleven the ba=
ttle was renewed.=20

Several of the Spanish ships were now disabled and on fire, and Admiral Mon=
tojo had been forced=20

to transfer his flag to the _Isla de Cuba_.  A few minutes later the _Reina=
 Cristina_, his former=20

flag-ship, was blazing from end to end, and the explosion of her magazine c=
ompleted the=20

destruction of the vessel. One after another the Spanish ships succumbed un=
der the storm of shot=20

and shell, and either surrendered or were cut to pieces. The _Don Antonio d=
e Ulloa_, riddled like a=20

sieve and on fire in a dozen places, refused to acknowledge defeat, and wen=
t down with colors=20

flying. Finally, Admiral Montojo hauled down his flag, and, leaving the _Is=
la de Cuba_, escaped to=20

the shore. The arsenal building at Cavit=C3=A9 ran up the white flag, and a=
t half-past one Commodore=20

Dewey signalled to his ships that they might anchor at discretion.  [Illust=
ration: BATTLE OF=20

mean by that, my darling boy? Is there any help in the world that I would n=
ot give you?  OSWALD.=20

When I got over my attack in Paris, the doctor told me that when it comes a=
gain--and it will come--

there will be no more hope.  MRS. ALVING. He was heartless enough to--  OSW=

it of him. I told him I had preparations to make--[He smiles cunningly.] An=

What is it?  OSWALD. Morphia.  MRS. ALVING. [Looks at him horror-struck.] O=

MRS. ALVING. I shall=20

her how things stood with me--and begged her to come to the rescue at the l=
ast. She would have=20

done it. I know she would.  MRS. ALVING. Never!  OSWALD. When the horror ha=

me, and she saw me lying there helpless, like a little new-born baby, impot=

all saving--  MRS. ALVING. Never in all the world would Regina have done th=
is!  OSWALD.=20

Regina would have done it. Regina was so splendidly light-hearted. And she =
would soon have=20

wearied of nursing an invalid like me.  MRS. ALVING. Then heaven be praised=
 that Regina is not=20

MRS. ALVING.=20

[Shrieks aloud.] I!  OSWALD. Who should do it if not you?  MRS. ALVING. I! =
your mother!=20

OSWALD. For that very reason.  MRS. ALVING. I, who gave you life!  OSWALD. =
I never asked=20

you for life. And what sort of a life have you given me? I will not have it=
! You shall take it back=20

OSWALD. [Follows=20

her.] Have you a mother's heart for me--and yet can see me suffer from this=
 unutterable dread?=20

MRS. ALVING. [After a moment's silence, commands herself, and says:] Here i=
s my hand upon it.=20

OSWALD. Will you--?  MRS. ALVING. If it should ever be necessary. But it wi=
ll never be=20

necessary. No, no; it is impossible.  OSWALD. Well, let us hope so. And let=
 us live together as=20

long as we can. Thank you, mother. [He seats himself in the arm-chair which=
 MRS. ALVING has=20

moved to the sofa. Day is breaking. The lamp is still burning on the table.=

[Drawing near cautiously.] Do you feel calm now?  OSWALD. Yes.  MRS. ALVING=

Oswald, what a lovely day we are going to have? Brilliant sunshine! Now you=
 can really see your=20

 MRS. ALVING. [By=20

the table, starts and looks at him.] What do you say?  OSWALD. [Repeats, in=
 a dull, toneless=20

OSWALD. [Seems to shrink together to the chair; all his muscles relax; his =
face is expressionless,=20

Oswald! what is the matter with you? [Falls on her knees beside him and sha=

downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or explosion of =
a Spanish shell on the=20

_Baltimore_. None of the American ships received any material damage. On th=
e other hand, the=20

following Spanish ships were completely destroyed: _Reina Cristina_ (flag-s=
hip), _Castilla_, _Don=20

Antonio de Ulloa_, _Don Juan de Austria_, _Isla de Luzon_, _Isla de Cuba_, =
_Marquiz del=20

Duero_, _General Lezo_, _Correo_, _Velasco_, and _Isla de Mandanao_. The ca=
sualties on the=20

Spanish side amounted to about four hundred men. Moreover, the water-batter=
ies of Cavit=C3=A9 had=20

been demolished, the arsenal had been captured, and the city of Manila lay =
defenceless under the=20

guns of the American fleet.  But Commodore Dewey=E2=80=99s difficulties wer=
e by no means at an end. He=20

had immediately proclaimed a blockade of the port. The German Pacific squad=
ron, under Vice-

Admiral von Diederich, had arrived at Manila shortly after the battle, and =
were, of course, in the=20

position of neutrals, having access to the harbor merely on the ground of i=
nternational courtesy.=20

This privilege the Germans quickly began to abuse, disregarding Commodore D=
ewey=E2=80=99s regulations=20

at will, and committing various acts inconsistent with the neutrality laws.=
 Their attitude was both=20

annoying and insolent, and it was evident that it must be promptly and effe=
ctually checked if the=20

American supremacy were to be maintained.  At last the opportunity came. Co=
mmodore Dewey=20

learned, on unquestionable authority, that one of the German vessels had be=
en landing provisions=20

at Manila, thereby violating neutrality. He immediately sent a vigorous pro=
test to Admiral von=20

Diederich--a message that ended with these significant words: =E2=80=9CAnd,=
 Brumby, tell Admiral von=20

Diederich that if he wants a fight he can have it right now.=E2=80=9D  That=
 was enough. The German=20

admiral was not quite ready to involve his country in a war with the United=
 States; he made an=20

apology, and the incident was closed.  On June 30th the first army expediti=
on from the United=20

States arrived at Manila, and Commodore Dewey=E2=80=99s long vigil was at a=
n end, the succeeding=20

operations in the Philippines being almost exclusively military, and consis=
ting of the capture of the=20

city of Manila by the Americans and subsequent warfare with Aguinaldo and i=
nsurgent Filipinos.=20

Such, in large outline, was the battle of Manila Bay. Foreign critics have =
derided American=20



enthusiasm on the ground that the American fleet was far superior, that the=
 Spanish vessels,=20

many of them mere gunboats, lacked armor and adequate guns, and that they w=
ere imperfectly=20

manned. Yet the same critics ranked the naval forces of Spain as quite equa=
l to the American at=20

the outset of the war. Furthermore, the action of Dewey, without a single b=
attle-ship or torpedo-

boat under his command, in entering a mined harbor without waiting to count=
ermine, and in=20

attacking a fleet whose strength was not accurately known, under the guns o=
f land batteries, must=20

be classed among the distinctive achievements of naval history. The battle =
was decisive in its=20

immediate outcome, far-reaching in its ultimate consequences. Dewey=E2=80=
=99s victory but presaged the=20

final triumph of American arms. The Battle of Manila Bay meant the expulsio=
n of Spain from the=20

Pacific and the succession of the United States to Spain=E2=80=99s heritage=
 of Asiatic power. Politically,=20

therefore, in its establishment of the United States as a power in the Orie=
nt, Manila Bay is to be=20

placed among the decisive battles of history.[273]     XXII  THE BATTLES OF=
 SANTIAGO, 1898   I=20

THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR IN THE WEST INDIES  Ex-Preside=
nt=20

Roosevelt once said that the most striking thing about the war with Spain w=
as the preparedness of=20

the navy and the unpreparedness of the army. For fifteen years the United S=
tates had been=20

building up a navy, and for months preceding the war every effort was made,=
 with the resources at=20

the command of the Navy Department, to put it in a state of first-class eff=
iciency. As early as=20

January 11, 1898, instructions were sent to the commanders of the several s=
quadrons to retain in=20

the service men whose terms of enlistment were about to expire. As the Cuba=
n situation grew=20

more threatening, the North Atlantic Squadron and a torpedo-boat flotilla w=
ere rapidly assembled=20

in Florida waters; and immediately after the destruction of the _Maine_ the=
 ships on the European=20

and South Atlantic stations were ordered to Key West....  Both from a polit=
ical and a military point=20

of view the blockade of Cuba was the first step for the American government=
 to take, and the=20

surest and quickest means of bringing things to an issue. Cuba was the poin=
t in dispute between=20

the United States and Spain, and a blockade would result in one of two thin=
gs--the surrender of=20

the island or the despatch of a Spanish naval force to its relief. The Navy=
 Department had very=20

little apprehension of an attack on our coast, as no squadron could hope to=
 be in condition after=20

crossing the Atlantic for offensive operations without coaling, and the onl=
y places where Spain=20

could coal were in the West Indies. The public, however, took a different v=
iew of the situation, and=20

no little alarm was felt in the Eastern cities. A few coast-defence guns of=
 modern pattern would=20

have relieved the department of the necessity of protecting the coast, and =
enabled it to=20

concentrate the whole fighting force around Cuba. To meet popular demands, =
however, a=20

Northern Patrol Squadron was organized April 20th, under command of Commodo=
re Howell, to=20

cover the New England coast; and a more formidable Flying Squadron, under C=
ommodore Schley,=20

was assembled at Hampton Roads, and kept there until the appearance of the =
Spanish fleet in the=20

West Indies. The main squadron was stationed at Key West under Rear-Admiral=
 William T.=20

Sampson, who had just been promoted to that grade, and given command of the=
 entire naval force=20

in North Atlantic waters. His appointment over the heads of Schley and othe=
r officers of superior=20

rank and longer service created a great deal of criticism, although he was =
everywhere conceded to=20

be one of the most efficient and progressive officers of the new navy.[274]=
  One hundred and=20

twenty-eight ships [steam merchantmen, revenue-cutters, light-house tenders=
, yachts, and ocean=20

liners] were added to the navy, and the government yards were kept busy tra=
nsforming them. To=20



man these ships the number of enlisted men was raised from 12,500 to 24,123=
, and a number of=20

new officers appointed.[275] The heavy fighting force consisted of four fir=
st-class battle-ships, the=20

_Indiana_, _Iowa_, _Massachusetts_, and _Oregon_; one second-class battle-s=
hip, the _Texas_;=20

and two armored cruisers, the _Brooklyn_ and the _New York_. As against the=
se seven armored=20

ships Spain had five armored cruisers of modern construction and of greater=
 reputed speed than=20

any of ours except the _Brooklyn_ and the _New York_, and one battle-ship o=
f the _Indiana_ type.=20

Spain had further a type of vessel unknown to our navy and greatly feared b=
y us--namely, torpedo-

boat destroyers, such as the _Furor_, _Pluton_, and _Terror_. It was popula=
rly supposed that the=20

Spanish navy was somewhat superior to the American.  As soon as the Spanish=
 minister withdrew=20

from Washington, a despatch was sent to Sampson at Key West directing him t=
o blockade the=20

coast of Cuba immediately from Cardenas to Bahia Honda, and to blockade Cie=
nfuegos if it was=20

considered advisable. On April 29th, Admiral Cervera=E2=80=99s division of =
the Spanish fleet left the Cape=20

de Verde Islands for an unknown destination, and disappeared for two weeks =
from the knowledge=20

of the American authorities. This fleet was composed of four armored cruise=
rs, the _Infanta Maria=20

Teresa_, _Cristobal Colon_, _Oquendo_, and _Vizcaya_, and three torpedo-boa=
t destroyers. Its=20

appearance in American waters was eagerly looked for, and interest in the w=
ar became intense....=20

[In the next two weeks Sampson=E2=80=99s patrol of the Windward Islands and=
 adjacent waters, and his=20

visit to San Juan, Porto Rico, produced no discoveries, and he started to r=
eturn to the blockade of=20

Havana. At midnight, May 12th=E2=80=9313th, thirty-six hours after the even=
t, the Navy Department learned=20

that Cervera had appeared off Martinique. Sampson, with his fleet, and Schl=
ey, with the Flying=20

Squadron, were ordered to Key West, which they reached on May 18th.]  The d=
epartment had=20

heard that Cervera had munitions of war essential to the defence of Havana,=
 and that his orders=20

were to reach Havana, Cienfuegos, or a port connected with Havana by rail. =
As Cienfuegos=20

seemed the only place he would be likely to choose, Schley was ordered ther=
e with the=20

_Brooklyn_, _Massachusetts_, and _Texas_, May 19th. He was joined later by =
the _Iowa_, under=20

Captain Evans, and by several cruisers. The Spanish squadron slipped into S=
antiago, unobserved=20

by the cruisers on scouting duty, May 19th, two days before Schley arrived =
at Cienfuegos, so that=20

had Cervera known the conditions he could easily have made the latter port.=
 On the same day the=20

department received from spies in Havana probable information, conveyed by =
the cable which had=20

been allowed to remain in operation, that Cervera had entered Santiago. As =
we now know, he had=20

entered early that morning. Several auxiliary cruisers were immediately ord=
ered to assemble=20

before Santiago in order to watch Cervera and follow him in case he should =
leave.  At the same=20

time the department =E2=80=9Cstrongly advised=E2=80=9D Sampson to send Schl=
ey to Santiago at once with his=20

whole command. Sampson replied that he had decided to hold Schley at Cienfu=
egos until it was=20

certain that the Spanish fleet was in Santiago. Later he sent a despatch to=
 Schley, received May=20

23d, ordering=20

scouting duty. Captain Sigsbee, of the _St. Paul_, informed him that the sc=
outs knew nothing=20

positively about the Spanish fleet. The collier _Merrimac_ had been disable=
d, which increased the=20

difficulty of coaling. At 7.45 P.M., a little over two hours after his arri=
val, Schley without explanation=20

signalled to the squadron: =E2=80=9CDestination, Key West, _via_ south side=
 of Cuba and Yucatan=20

Channel, as soon as collier is ready; speed, nine knots.=E2=80=9D Thus bega=
n the much-discussed=20

retrograde movement which occupied two days. Admiral Schley states in his b=
ook that. Sigsbee=E2=80=99s=20

report and other evidence led him to conclude that the Spanish squadron was=
 not in Santiago;=20

hence the retrograde movement to protect the passage west of Cuba.[278] But=
 he has never yet=20

given any satisfactory explanation why he did not definitely ascertain the =
facts before turning back.=20

Fortunately the squadron did not proceed very far; the lines towing the col=
lier parted and other=20

delays occurred. The next morning Schley received a despatch from the depar=
tment stating that=20

all the information at hand indicated that Cervera was in Santiago, but he =
continued on his=20

westward course slowly and at times drifting while some of the ships coaled=
. The next day, May=20

28th, Schley returned to Santiago, arriving before that port about dusk, an=
d established a=20

blockade.[279]  Admiral Sampson arrived off Santiago June 1st, and assumed =
direct command of=20

the squadron. The blockade, which lasted for over a month, was eagerly watc=

American people. The most thrilling incident was the daring but unsuccessfu=

employees entrance to Santiago harbor, undertaken by direction of Admiral S=
ampson. Electric=20

torpedoes were attached to the hull of the ship, sea-valves were cut, and a=
nchor chains arranged=20

on deck so that she could be brought to a sudden stop. Early on the morning=
 of June 3d, Hobson,=20

assisted by a crew of seven seamen, took the collier into the entrance of t=
he harbor under heavy=20

fire and sunk her. The unfortunate shooting away of her steering-gear and t=
he failure of some of=20

the torpedoes to explode kept the ship from sinking at the place selected, =
so that the plan=20



miscarried. Hobson and his men escaped death as by a miracle, but fell into=
 the hands of the=20

Spaniards.[280]   II  THE LAND CAMPAIGN  As soon as Cervera was blockaded i=
n Santiago and=20

the government was satisfied that all his ships were with him, it was decid=
ed to send an army to=20

co-operate with the navy. Hitherto the war had been a naval war exclusively=
, and the two hundred=20

thousand volunteers who had responded to the calls of the President in May =
had been kept in=20

camp in different parts of the country. Most of the regular infantry and ca=
valry, together with=20

several volunteer regiments, had been assembled at Tampa and organized as t=
he Fifth Army=20

Corps, in readiness to land in Cuba as soon as the navy had cleared the way=
. Conspicuous=20

among these troops was the First Volunteer Cavalry, popularly known as Roos=
evelt=E2=80=99s Rough=20

Riders, a regiment which through the energetic efforts of Dr. Leonard Wood,=
 an army surgeon,=20

who became its colonel, and Theodore Roosevelt, who resigned the position o=
f assistant secretary=20

of the navy to become its lieutenant-colonel, had been enlisted, officered,=
 and equipped in fifty=20

days. It was recruited largely from Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, and =
had in its ranks=20

cowboys, hunters, ranchmen, and more than one hundred and sixty full-bloode=
d Indians, together=20

with a few graduates of Harvard, Yale, and other Eastern colleges.  Tampa w=
as ill-suited for an=20

instruction camp, and the preparations made by the department for the accom=
modation and=20

provisioning of such large bodies of men were wholly inadequate. One of the=
 main difficulties was=20

the inability of the Commissary and Quartermaster departments, hampered by =
red tape, senseless=20

regulations, and political appointees, to distribute the train-loads of sup=
plies which blocked the=20

tracks leading to Tampa; so great was the congestion that the soldiers coul=
d not even get their=20

mail. This condition continued for weeks. The great majority of the troops =
were finally sent to=20

Santiago to fight under a tropical sun in heavy woollen clothes; lighter cl=
othing was not supplied to=20

them until they were ready to return to Montauk Point, where they needed th=
e woollen. The=20

sanitation of the camp was poor and the water-supply bad; dysentery, malari=
a, and typhoid soon=20

made their appearance. Similar conditions prevailed at the other camps. The=
 administrative=20

inefficiency of the War Department was everywhere revealed in striking cont=
rast with the fine=20

record of the Navy Department. Secretary Alger had been too much occupied w=
ith questions of=20

patronage to look after the real needs of the service. Although war had bee=
n regarded for months=20

as inevitable, when it finally came the department was found to be utterly =
unprepared to equip=20

troops for service in Cuba. As the result of this neglect, for which it sho=
uld be said Congress was=20

partly responsible, it was necessary to improvise an army--a rather serious=
 undertaking!  It had=20
