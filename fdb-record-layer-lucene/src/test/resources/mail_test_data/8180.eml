dracaena marginata stream which instead of flowing healthfully upon the Negro is polluted and poisoned by the abolitionists and rendered the source of discontent and excitement."[2] He believed that education thus perverted would become   Bursting the bulwarks that kept the flood in;   Is love only madness?

education of Negroes for service in the United States. The colored people, as we shall see 

elsewhere, were not allowed to locate their manual labor college at New Haven[1] and the 

principal of the Noyes Academy at Canaan, New Hampshire, saw his institution destroyed 

because he decided to admit colored students.[2] These fastidious persons, however, raised no 

objection to the establishment of schools to prepare Negroes to expatriate themselves under the 

direction of the American Colonization Society.[3]  [Footnote 1: _Proceedings of the Third Annual 

Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color_, p. 14.]  [Footnote 2: _Fourth Annual 

Report of the American Antislavery Society_, p. 34.]  [Footnote 3: Alexander, _A History of 

Colonization on the Western Continent_, p. 348.]  Observing these conditions the friends of the 

colored people could not be silent. The abolitionists led by Caruthers, May, and Garrison hurled 

their weapons at the reactionaries, branding them as inconsistent schemers. After having 

advanced the argument of the mental inferiority of the colored race they had adopted the policy of 

educating Negroes on the condition that they be removed from the country.[1] Considering 

education one of the rights of man, the abolitionists persistently rebuked the North and South for 

their inhuman policy. On every opportune occasion they appealed to the world in behalf of the 

oppressed race, which the hostile laws had removed from humanizing influences, reduced to the 

plane of beasts, and made to die in heathenism.  [Footnote 1: Jay,_An Inquiry_, etc., p. 26; Johns 

Hopkins University Studies, Series xvi., p. 319; and _Proceedings of the New York State 

Colonization Society_, 1831, p. 6.]    For I cannot tell, and I feel afraid.    The sweetest poem that 

ever was writ--   Do you not know it?--is 'We are seven;'   For the dear little girl who talks in it,   Will 

not give up her brothers in Heaven.    What the stupid sense of the grown-up man   Urges, she 

cannot perceive; but prefers   The simple faith of her own sweet plan,   And the brothers in Heaven 

still are hers.    The very last day that Harry was here   I read him those verses, and Harry smil'd; 

And we held some converse, divinely dear,   Which was all about that dear little child.    Is it for this 

that I think of it now?   Is it for this he let seven words fall?   O pulses are beating behind my brow, 

And I think my heart is not beating at all!   And my brain, it keeps whirling round and round,   Like a 

sing-song wheel through a ship at night;   And the seven words that constantly sound   Are 'you 

shall follow me, sweet,' and 'I'll write.'       I wonder if I have been going mad,   In the strange wild 

world I am living in?   I think that I have--I hop'd that I had--   For I weary with wondering, what is 

sin?    There's blood on your hand--there's blood on your soul--   O lily-white hand--soul noble and 

true!   You murder'd him where the blue waters roll,   And he set the seal of his death on you.    I 

have sat so happily by your side,   I have lain so tranquilly on your breast;   But I think that you 

died, and I think that I died--   And death is the end of all, and the best.    It was God who created 

men and time;   And a better than you He could not need;   So if you did it, it was not a crime, 

And if 'twas a crime, you did not the deed.    I am fighting with life, with death I strive;   Ready for 

neither; both crush

said that but for the "intrusive and intriguing interference of pragmatical fanatics"[1] such 

precautionary enactments would never have been necessary. There was some truth in this 

statement; for in certain districts these measures operated not to prevent the aristocratic people of 

the South from enlightening the Negroes, but to keep away from them what they considered 

undesirable instructors. The southerners regarded the abolitionists as foes in the field, 

industriously scattering the seeds of insurrection which could then be prevented only by blocking 

every avenue through which they could operate upon the minds of the slaves. A writer of this 

period expressed it thus: "It   Only those seven words keep me alive--   You said 'you shall follow 

me,' and 'I'll write.'       They stealthily talk; I hear what they say--   Sharply she hears who each 

syllable dreads--   Glancing at me in significant way,   Touching their foreheads and shaking their 

heads.    'Mad?'--'not exactly--bewilder'd--confus'd;   Thoughts turn'd astray by grief's terrible force; 

Not even by love is murder excus'd;   She cannot believe that he did it, of course.   She thinks him 

a hero, and so loves on;   Reason enthron'd would annihilate this;   Love would have nothing to 

nestle upon,   Did she perceive him the sinner he is.'           *       *       *       *       *    Words
