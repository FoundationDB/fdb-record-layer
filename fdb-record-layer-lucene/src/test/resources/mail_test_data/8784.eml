to bolster up the faltering spirits of Honey.  He would not for a moment admit to her that they had 

acted unwisely.  Even so, he was protesting against the conviction that was gradually deepening 

within him that he'd made something of a fool of himself!  Invariably, it was during these fits of 

abstraction, superinduced by the doubt that was broadening in Skinner's consciousness as to the 

wisdom of his scheme of self-promotion, that either McLaughlin or Perkins encountered him--so 

curiously does fate direct our affairs with a view to promoting dramatic ends.  Once, in the depths 

of abstraction, Skinner actually passed Perkins in the passageway without so much as a nod of

little thing Skinner did took on an artificial significance--was given undue weight.     CHAPTER V 

THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE DRESS SUIT  Skinner's feelings were not of the most 

amiable when on Saturday he drew his first check on his own private bank account to pay himself 

his first week's raise.  And he swore dark that they could scarcely see a dozen yards before them. 

"You must take care and not catch cold," said Garden. "Was Miss Lethbridge well when you left 

her?"  Fred replied for Aunt Leth. "Yes, Dick; and she sent you the kindest of messages."  "It was 

very good of her to think of me. But you don't mean to say you saw her, Fred? She ought to have 

been asleep hours before."  "She is not going to bed
