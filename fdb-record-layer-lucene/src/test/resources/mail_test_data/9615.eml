philodendron monstera    Our souls stream forth in a flood from the edge of the whetted swords:      no otherwise than so does our spirit leave its mansion.    Pure is our stock, unsullied: fair is it kept and bright      by mothers whose bed bears well, and fathers mighty.    To the best of the uplands we wend, and when the season comes      we travel adown to the best of fruitful valleys.    Like rain of the heaven are we: there is not in all our       Nor moan or murmur make;     But O! how deep the dreamless sleep!       Would God she might awake.      Asleep? awake! the Shepherd takes       His little lamb above;     And where she wakes the morning breaks       In everlasting love.          *       *       *       *       *      But I cannot feel that she is gone       So far, so far away;     For her little heart close to my own       Keeps beating day by day.
