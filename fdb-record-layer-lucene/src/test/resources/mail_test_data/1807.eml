JAMES PIERCE, ESQ. _of New-York, in a Letter to the Editor_.     NEW-YORK, =
October 19, 1818.=20

DEAR SIR,  I forward you a few mineral specimens characteristic of Staten-I=
sland, including native=20

carbonate of magnesia, in acicular crystals. I discovered this new form and=
 locality of magnesia in=20

examining the strata exhibited in an excavation now making, under the delus=
ive expectation of=20

finding gold, about three miles from the Quarantine. In descending the shaf=
t, sunk perpendicularly=20

in steatite, magnesite, veins of talc, and green translucent asbestus were =
observed at depths=20


_
since, and a mighty stiff proposition it is. The O.C. to-day told me that h=
e had not slept for fifty-six=20

hours. The Germans in one place are only twenty-five yards away--so close t=
hat conversation is=20

carried on in a whisper.  In one place they had stuck up a board with "Wars=
aw Captured" on it.  My=20

section worked until two o'clock and then the sandbags gave out, so we had =
to come home. This=20

was a disappointment to me. I wanted to get the job finished. My men went o=
n filling sandbags=20

from the same place last night and discovered the remains of the late owner=
 of the sword bayonet.=20

He has now been decently buried, with a little wooden cross marked--       =
TO AN UNKNOWN=20

FRENCH SOLDIER     R.I.P.   When you read in the newspapers, that a trench =
was lost or taken,=20

just think what it means. Think what happens to the men in the trenches; th=
at's the part of it we=20

see. Stretchers pass by all day. Since I have been here the cemetery has gr=
own--a new mound--a=20

simple wooden cross. Nobody talks about it, but everybody wonders who's nex=
t. The men here=20

are splendid, the best in the world, and the officers are gentlemen.       =
                         was found=20

to embrace veins and cavities containing native carbonate of magnesia, in v=
ery white acicular=20

crystals, grouped in minute fibres radiating from the sides, but not always=
 filling the veins and=20

cavities. The crystals were, in some instances, suspended, assuming a stala=
ctical form. This=20

carbonate of magnesia dissolves entirely in diluted sulphuric acid, with co=
nsiderable effervescence=20

and chemical action, producing a bitter compound, from which salts of easy =
solution are formed by=20

evaporation. The magnesite in which these crystals are found, appears to be=
 composed of=20

carbonate of magnesia, steatite, and talc, disintegrating readily upon expo=
sure to air and moisture:=20

it effervesces considerably in sulphuric acid, forming a very bitter fluid =
that soon exhibits crystals,=20

indicating that magnesia enters in large proportion into its constitution. =
Magnesite may perhaps be=20

found at this place in quantity sufficient for a successful manufacture of =
Epsom salts. Small regular=20

hexaedral crystals of mica, were noticed in steatite. Chromate of iron was =
sparingly diffused=20

through the different minerals raised from various depths.  A few remarks a=
nd=20

A French Soldier.                     -------------------------------------=
  We have moved to the famous=20

Langhof Chateau on the Lille road. This is supposed to have belonged to Hen=
nessey of "Three=20

Star" fame, but the Germans had been through the wine cellars. We looked ve=
ry, very carefully,=20

but only found empties. My batman has made me comfortable. I'm writing this=
 on a washstand; in=20

front of me I have a bunch of roses in a broken vase. My trench coat is han=
ging on a nail from a=20

coat-hanger. A large piece of Staten-Island, may, perhaps, give some additi=
onal interest to the=20

specimens presented.  Staten-Island (which constitutes Richmond county) is =
situated about seven=20

miles southwest of the city of New-York, extends from northeast to southwes=
t about fifteen miles,=20

in a straight line, with an average width of six. It exhibits a considerabl=
e diversity of surface. The=20

eastern part is composed principally of elevated ground: a mountain chain i=
s observed to take its=20

rise in the vicinity of a narrow sound called the Kills, and sweep, in a=20


_
One of the men just came in to ask if a trousers press would be of any use.=
 We have a fine little=20

bureau cupboard of carved oak; we use this for the rations. A pump, repaire=
d with the leather from=20

a German helmet, has been persuaded to work and has been busy ever since. T=
he roof of my=20

cellar is arched brick and has a few tons of fallen debris on the floor ups=
tairs. That strengthens it. It=20

is shored up from southwest, parallel with, and distant from Amboy Bay, abo=
ut two miles,=20

terminating near the centre of the island, and forming, with the exception =
of some passages, a=20

continued chain, which, on the eastern and southern sides, is very steep, b=
ut not precipitous; it=20

gradually declines to the west and north, and, in some places, it presents =
on its summit table land=20

of considerable extent. A prominent ridge=20
