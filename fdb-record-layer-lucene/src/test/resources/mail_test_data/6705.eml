he saw Socker fleeing from the room, and as he reflected that it would be dangerous to remain, he 

turned and fled, carrying the apparatus with him.  "Everybody out!" cried Socker. "Get 'em all out! 

The boiler will blow up!"  The lads, lightly clad, fled through the basement door out into the night. 

The snow, which had ceased that evening, had started in again, and the storm was howling as if in 

glee at the plight of the students of Washington Hall, who were driven from their beds by fire. 

CHAPTER X  SAVING THE FLAGS   "Telephone for the town fire department!" cried Dr. Mead, 

who had been apprised of the fire. He, like all the others, was out in the storm, with a few clothes 

he had hastily donned.  "They can't get in the boiler-room to fight the fire!" cried Socker.  "Why 

not?"  "Because the boiler will blow up. Something is wrong with the safety valve, and there are 

two hundred pounds of steam on. The boiler is only meant for one hundred."  "How did the fire 

start? What made the safety valve get out of order?" asked the principal.  The group of students 

and teachers, standing in the storm, could now see the bright flicker of flames in the boiler-room. "I 

don't know," replied Socker. "I was asleep in front of the boiler, waiting to put some more coal on, 

when all of a sudden I smelled smoke."  "How long before the boiler will go up?" asked Dr. Mead 

anxiously. "I have some valuable books I must save."  He started to re-enter the school.  "Don't go 

back!" cried form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as

Dr. Mead returned to the waiting group, his face betraying intense excitement.  "We must get the 

fire out!" he cried. "Can't some one send word to the village?"  "There's a telephone in Mr. 

Raspen's house, about half a mile away," volunteered Sam. "I'll run there."  He started off, and just 

as he did so a series of alarming cries broke out at one of the upper corridor windows of the 

school.  "Fire! Fire!" cried a voice. "Der school ist being gonsumed by der fierce elements! Safe 

me, somebodies! I must get out my German flag! I must out get quvick, alretty yet!"  The anxious 

face of Professor Garlach appeared at one of the windows.  "Don't jump!" cried Jack, as the 

teacher seemed about to do so. "You've got time enough to come down the stairs."  "B-r-r-r-r! It's 

cold!" cried Nat Anderson, as some snow got inside the slippers he had put on, and some flakes 

sifted down his back.  "It will soon be warm enough," observed Jack. "The fire is gaining. Poor 

Washington Hall! It deserved a better fate than being burned down."  "Look!" cried Sam, who had 

paused in his run to go to the telephone. "There's Socrat."  The French professor had joined his 

German colleague at the window, and both were struggling to climb out of it.  "Stand aside, 

German brute zat you aire!" exclaimed the Frenchman. "I must save ze glorious flag of la belle 

France! Let me toss it out of ze window!"  "I vill nottings of der kind do alretty      destroy all copies

Garlach. "I vos here firstest!"  "Zen you are no gentlemans!" was Professor Socrat's reply. "Bah! 

Sacre! Let me out, I demand of you! I am insult zat you should flout zat rag in my eyes!"  The wind 

had blown the German flag, which Professor Garlach held, into the face of the Frenchman.  "Rag!
