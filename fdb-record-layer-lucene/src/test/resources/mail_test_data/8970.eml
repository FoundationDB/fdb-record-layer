such as a fever, a=20

fractured leg or skull, or raving mania apparent to all;[359] but this view=
 was disapproved=20

expressly in the later case of _Renihan v. Dennin_.[360]  The privileged in=
formation has been said=20

to include knowledge acquired through the statements of others surrounding =
the patient.[361] But=20

it would seem that the fact that a third person was present during a physic=
ian=E2=80=99s visit may be shown=20

by the physician, as well as what passed between the patient and the third =
person, if it was such=20

information as a layman would have gathered.[362] The information from the =
third person=20

regarding the patient is protected even though the patient be absent;[363] =
but not if the third=20

person does not employ the physician, and the information thus acquired is =
not necessary to=20

enable the physician to act in a professional capacity.[364] It is suggeste=
d in one case, but not=20

determined, that it would be improper for a physician to state the value of=
 the services of a nurse=20

in attendance upon his patient, as that would involve a consideration of th=
e condition of his=20

patient;[365] but it has been held that a physician can testify to the fact=
 of a nurse=E2=80=99s services.[366]=20

But it is information regarding the patient that is privileged, and therefo=
re a physician may disclose=20

what his patient told him about another, even though the subject of inquiry=
 be the attitude of the=20

patient toward the other;[367] and likewise the physician may disclose what=
 he told his patient=20

about a third person;[368] so also the physician may testify as to family e=
vents in no way=20



connected with physical complaints.[369] It has been held, too, that admiss=
ions made by a patient=20

to his physician, tending to show contributory negligence on the part of th=
e patient, at a time when=20

the communication could not well have been made to enable the physician to =
prescribe, namely,=20

on the physician=E2=80=99s third and last visit, may be proven by the physi=
cian.[370]  The physician may=20

properly testify that he did attend as physician,[371] and that the patient=
 was sick, and he can=20

state when and how often he attended him,[372] and whether his knowledge wa=
s acquired while in=20

professional attendance,[373] but it is open to the Court to determine from=
 the evidence whether it=20

was so acquired.[374]  =E2=80=9C_Matter Committed._=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94In Ind=
iana the protection covers _matter=20

committed_. It would seem that the use of the word _committed_ implies conf=

protected matter is only confidential communications; but an earlier statut=

and is not privileged;[377] but where the advice is sought for a purpose wh=
ich may or may not be=20

said that whether or not a physician treated a person for a particular dise=
ase, is not a confidential=20

communication.[379]  The word confidential is not narrowly construed, for a=
 physician has been=20

prevented from disclosing whether his patient said that a car was in motion=

because the injury would be more severe if in motion;[380] and the fact tha=
