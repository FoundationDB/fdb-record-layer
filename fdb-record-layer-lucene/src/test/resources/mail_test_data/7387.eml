gubernatorial office, nineteen having been thus commemorated, and Cabell Co=
unty formed in=20

1809 carried on the tradition. It honored William H. Cabell, who served fro=
m 1805 until 1808 when=20

he was chosen judge of the General Court. It later fell into West Virginia,=
 and lies along the Ohio=20

River.   1810-1820, DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES, FIVE NEW COUNTIES  In 1814, a Vi=
rginia=20

county was formed from parts of Lee, Russell and Washington and named Scott=
. This name was=20

selected because of General Winfield Scott, a native of Virginia who achiev=
ed fame because of his=20

successes in the War of 1812. Later in the Mexican War he decisively defeat=
ed the Mexicans at=20

Chapultepec, entering Mexico City as conqueror. As a result of this war som=
e 850,000 square=20

miles became United States territory.  The bounds of Scott County are as fo=
llows: "Beginning at=20

the head of Reedy creek where the wagon road crosses the same in the county=
 of Washington=20

thence down the Tennessee line to the south fork of Clinch river thence nor=
thward passing the=20

Flag Pond to the top of Powell's mountain in Lee County and along it to the=
 county of Russell and=20

with it to the Kentucky line, thence along Cumberland mountain to the head =
of Guese's river=20

thence down the Clinch mountain thence to the western end of Samuel Hensley=
's plantation and=20

thence to the beginning."  "The wagon road" mentioned in the above descript=
ion is most likely the=20

so-called "Wilderness Road" over which many west bound settlers laboriously=
 toiled. The other=20

route west that was often used was north to the present Pittsburgh and down=
 the Ohio river.=20

Powell's Mountain and the river of that name commemorate Ambrose Powell of =
Culpeper County,=20

one of the earliest explorers of Kentucky who accompanied Doctor Thomas Wal=
ker there in 1749.=20

In Scott County is the Natural Tunnel, a rare formation through which the t=
rains of the Southern=20

Railway Company pass regularly en route to Tennessee.  Tyler, the next coun=
ty established, lies=20

now in the northwestern part of West Virginia along the Ohio River but comm=
emorates a=20

Tidewater Virginian, John Tyler, Sr. He was born at "Greenway" Charles City=
 County and served=20

as Governor 1808-1811. His fame has been somewhat obscured by that of his s=
on, John Tyler,=20

junior, President of the United States.  The next county formed, Lewis, whi=
ch was cut from=20

Harrison, also lay later in West Virginia in the north central area. It der=
ived its name from a heroic=20

soldier, Colonel Charles Lewis who was killed at the Battle of Point Pleasa=
nt in 1774. Point=20

Pleasant, situated near the confluence of the Great Kanawha with the Ohio R=
iver was the scene of=20

a day-long bloody battle between the Virginia troops and Indian warriors le=
d by Cornstalk and=20

Logan. General Andrew Lewis, brother of Colonel Charles, was the commanding=
 officer. The=20

battle was hardly decisive and General Lewis wished to follow and annihilat=
e the fleeing enemy.=20

Lord Dunmore, in command of another detachment which arrived later, forbade=
 this and allowed=20

the Indians to escape. This may have been one of the reasons that influence=
d the Indians=20

throughout the Revolution to espouse the British cause.  The establishment =
of Lewis County in=20

1816 was followed two years later by that of another county, Preston, forme=
d from Monongalia,=20

lying in the northeast corner of West Virginia, and adjoining Pennsylvania =
and Maryland. Preston=20

subjoined, to make the list complete:    8 5ths on C, and 1 on D.   5 5/4th=
s on D, 2 on E, and 1 on=20

ses of the several=20

chords. When any number is annexed to the letter denoting the fundamental, =
it denotes the quality=20

of some other note belonging to the chord. E III, for example, denotes that=
 the various chords on=20

E, which stand against it, have their third sharped; G 3, that the third, w=
hich is naturally major, is to=20

be taken minor, &c. Of the two columns in each of the four remaining pairs,=
 the left contains the=20

number of chords belonging to each root, of the kind specified at the top, =
which were found in 150=20

scores in the major mode; and the right, the corresponding results of the e=
xamination of 50 scores=20

in the minor mode. The diminished triad, which is used in harmonical progre=
ssion like the other=20

triads, has its lowest note considered as its fundamental. The diminished 7=
th, in the few instances=20

in which it occurred, was considered as the first inversion of the 9/7th, a=
greeably to the French=20

classification, and was accordingly reduced to that head.  From this table,=
 the number of times that=20

ed, is easily=20

computed. We will suppose three notes, besides octaves, to be played to eac=
h chord. The octaves=20

played it is unnecessary to take into the computation, as it would only mul=
tiply the number of=20

consonances whose temperament is the same, in the same ratio, and would hav=
e no effect on the=20

_ratio_ of the numbers expressing the frequency of the different consonance=
s. In the chord of the=20

7th, which naturally consists of four notes, we will suppose, for the sake =
of uniformity, that one is=20

omitted; and as the 7th=20
