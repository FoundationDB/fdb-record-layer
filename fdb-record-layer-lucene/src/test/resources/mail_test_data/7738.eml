even at this day, and more to-day perhaps than ever before, in the great conceit of our age. The 

allegory means simply that Nagarjuna having been initiated by the "Serpents"--the Adepts, "the 

wise ones"--and driven out from India by the Brahmans, who dreaded to have their Mysteries and 

sacerdotal Science divulged (the real cause of their hatred of Buddhism), went away to China and 

Tibet, where he initiated many into the truths of the hidden Mysteries taught by Gautama Buddha. 

(2) The hidden symbolism of Narada--the great Rishi and the author of some of the Rig-Vaidic 

hymns, who incarnated again later on during Krishna's time--has never been understood. Yet, in 

connection with the Occult Sciences, Narada, the son of Brahma, is one of the most prominent 

characters; he is directly connected in his first incarnation with the "Builders"--hence with the 

seven "Rectors" of the  "Now, Pistache, my good dog, jump the height of this cane for Madame de 

Montbazon."  "But," interposed Monsieur de Chavigny, "it seems to me that Pistache is only doing 

what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de Pons."  "Stop," said the duke, 

"Pistache, jump for the queen." And he raised his cane six inches higher.  The dog sprang, and in 

spite of the height jumped lightly over it.  "And now," said the duke, raising it still six inches higher, 

"jump for the king."  The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane.  "Now, then," said the 

duke, and as he spoke, lowered the cane almost level with the ground; "Pistache, my friend, jump 

for the 'Illustrious Coxcomb, Mazarin de Piscina.'"  The dog turned his back to the cane.  "What," 

asked the duke, "what do you mean?" and he gave him the cane again, first making a semicircle 

from the head to the tail of

"helped God in the work of creation." This grand personification is hardly noticed by our 

Orientalists, who refer only to that which he is alleged to have said of Patala, namely, "that it is a 

place of sexual and sensual gratifications." This is thought to be amusing, and the reflection is 

suggested that Narada, no doubt, "found the place delightful." Yet this sentence simply shows him 

to have been an Initiate, connected directly with the Mysteries, and walking, as all the other 

neophytes, before and after him, had to walk, in "the pit among the thorns" in the "Jump then, 

Monsieur Pistache."  But Pistache, as at first, turned round on his legs and stood with his back to 

the cane.  Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time, but by this time Pistache's 

patience was exhausted; he threw himself furiously upon the cane, wrested it from the hands of 

the prince and broke it with his teeth.  Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and 

presented them with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny, saying that for that evening the 

entertainment was ended, but in three months it should be repeated, when

_Chrest_ condition," as the suffering victim made to descend thereinto--a mystery, truly!  Narada 

is one of the seven Rishis, the "mind-born sons" of Brahma. The fact of his having been during his 

incarnation a high Initiate--he, like Orpheus, being the founder of the Mysteries--is corroborated, 

and made evident by his history. The _Mahabharata_ states that Narada, having  Three days 

afterward Pistache was found dead--poisoned.  Then the duke said openly that his dog had been 

killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him; and one day after dinner he went to bed, 

calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned him.  This fresh 

impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly. The donjon of
