silent. He moved on a pace or two; listened again; and the wind brought him=
 something like a=20

repetition of the moan. Could he be mistaken? he asked himself. No; that wa=
s a human voice;=20

perhaps some drunken wretch. If so, the first thought which suggested itsel=
f was, that he should=20

turn back and see that the man was not lying in the track of the iron horse=
 or its carriages. Second=20

thoughts are said to be the best,--and, if selfishness be better than disin=
terestedness, Mr.=20

Freeling's second thoughts were better than his first. What did it matter t=
o him, he argued with=20

himself, if people got drunk? They must suffer for it, was the second thoug=
ht of the half-drunken=20

man. So he trudged along again; but the sound, louder this time, overtook h=
im once more. He was=20

not essentially an unkind man; and although home had peculiar attractions f=
or him in his then=20

condition, he was obliged by the force of his human nature to pause.  Anoth=
er groan. There could=20

be no mistake about it. A poor wretch was lying somewhere near him in evide=
nt pain. He shouted:=20

"Holloa! what is the matter?"  A feeble groan responded.  "Where are you?" =
he cried.  Again a=20

moan.  It was more than decent, although half-drunken, humanity could resis=
t. He turned back in=20

the direction of the railway a few steps. Then he paused, and once more a d=
ismal sound greeted=20

his ear.  "Some poor fellow," the traveller said to himself, "must be lying=
 on the railway in a dying=20

state. What can I do? The nearest station, B----, is _two_ miles away; the =
nearest house is two=20

miles. Still, I must find where he is lying, and what is the matter with hi=
m, and do what I can to help=20

him."  This resolution taken, he walked back, ever and anon pausing to list=
en, and now and then=20

guided by the plaintive cry of agony.  At length, after reaching the gate w=
hich abutted on the=20

railway, he paused and listened for another cry to guide him in turning rig=
ht or left. A moment=20

supplied the indication he required. He turned to the left, and proceeded r=
apidly a distance of three=20

hundred described as one of =E2=80=9Cextreme desolation.=E2=80=9D Four or f=
ive persons, at least, were killed, and=20

as many injured. Twenty-seven dwelling-houses were completely demolished, a=
nd a great many=20

others unroofed, or otherwise damaged.  At Murphysboro, Illinois, many wind=
ows were broken by=20

the great hail; while there came an unverified report of fifteen or more pe=
rsons killed about Shiloh,=20

and to the north of Campbell Hill. South of Murphysboro, several houses wer=
e blown down; two=20

children were killed.  At Centralia, two and one-fourth inches of rain fell=
 in twenty minutes,=20

changing later into snow. Farm buildings west of town suffered considerable=
 damage.  At=20

Carbondale, the dreaded funnel appeared, and two blocks of houses were unro=
ofed.  Five miles=20

southwest of Xenia, many out-buildings were blown down and several houses d=
estroyed. A=20

school-house on the prairie was blown away, and one of the sills carried ne=
arly a quarter of a mile.=20

In the southern part of Union county, seven miles southwest of Anna, a torn=
ado swept a track=20

about half a mile wide and four miles long, over the richest farms, destroy=
ing stock, orchards,=20

forests and houses. One or two persons were fatally hurt. At Mt. Pleasant, =
twelve miles east of=20

Anna, there was extensive destruction of property.  At Braidwood, a number =
of houses and out-

buildings were blown away; trees were torn up, several persons severely inj=
ured, and two or three=20

children are said to have =E2=80=9Cdisappeared.=E2=80=9D The writer remembe=
rs an instance that occurred some=20

years ago, when a fourteen-year-old boy was carried five miles and dropped =
into a stream: but=20

such a case does not occur in this country once in many years. One of the f=
reaks told of the wind=20

at Braidwood is, that it rolled a man in the road and whisked a watch out o=
f his pocket. It does not=20

appear that any funnel-shaped cloud was seen here.  At Cairo, out of a flee=
t of shanty-boats,=20

thirteen were destroyed, and an old cripple was drowned.  The storm struck =
Nashville (Ill.) at 4=20



P.M. The rain,  [Illustration: RUINED DWELLINGS.]=20


_
met an obstruction to his course, against which he stumbled. A shriek, or s=
omething like it,=20

followed. It was that of a prostrate man whose voice he had so frequently h=
eard.  Mr. Freeling bent=20

over the poor sufferer, and learnt enough to satisfy himself that an accide=
nt had happened to this=20

man on the railway, and that medical assistance and attention were required=
.  The situation and its=20

incidents had a beneficial effect upon the intoxicated man,--they roused hi=
s senses. In five minutes=20

he was as sober as he had ever been in his life. Carefully removing the lim=
bs of the prostrate body=20

out of the way of further immediate danger, he ran along the course of the =
railway until he reached=20

a station, where he learnt the particulars of a collision; but was informed=
 that all the passengers=20

had been removed, most of them, if not all, being well enough to proceed on=
 their feet. The wind=20

blew with terrific force. The Prohibition Tabernacle and a two-story brick =
cooper shop went down.=20

Beginning six miles southeast on Little Prairie, the damage was fearful, an=
d ranged through a=20

sweep, to the northeast, of twenty miles. Not less than thirty houses were =
destroyed, and twice=20

that number badly damaged. Of numerous casualties, one or two will illustra=
te the force of the=20

wind at this place: One family of seven were sitting in their house as the =
storm drew near. Two of=20

the little girls becoming frightened, ran out, when the wind caught them up=
, carried them across a=20

field a quarter of a mile wide, and dropped them uninjured, save from viole=
nt pelting of the hail. As=20

the remaining members of the family were in the act of forsaking the house,=
 it fell, and all were=20

more or less hurt.  This case would seem to indicate a lack of uniformity i=
n the=20


_
there must have been at least one exception to this rule, which the officia=
ls at the station had not=20

observed; and they did not require any further proof of their oversight tha=
n that he supplied.  With=20

lanterns, and with the means of removing the wounded passenger, two porters=
, and two other men=20

who were pressed into the service, walked with our friend to the spot where=
 he had found the=20

injured man.  He was the wind; it being powerful enough at one point to car=
ry away children, while=20

the house, only a few feet away at most, was still standing. One or two oth=
er cases of persons=20

being carried a considerable distance were reported from Nashville.  All su=
ch instances show the=20

powerful upward current of the tornado; for wind of greater horizontal velo=
city is often observed,=20

which produces no such effects. To the=20
