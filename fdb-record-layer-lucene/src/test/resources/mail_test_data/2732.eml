Shakspere holds in the English drama. It is true that Kalidasa's dramatic m=
asterpiece, the=20

Shakuntala, is the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that t=
he tender and elegant=20

Kalidasa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate enthusiasm, the "Shak=
spere of India." But=20

this rather exclusive admiration of the Shakuntala results from lack of inf=
ormation about the other=20

great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due to the accident that only the=
 Shakuntala became=20

known in translation at a time when romantic Europe was in full sympathy wi=
th the literature of=20

India.  Bhavabhuti, too, is far less widely known than Kalidasa; and for th=
is the reason is deeper-

seated. The austerity of Bhavabhuti's style, his lack of humor, his insiste=
nt grandeur, are qualities=20

which prevent his being a truly popular poet. With reference to Kalidasa, h=
e holds a position such=20

as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will always seem to mind=
s that sympathize=20

with his grandeur[3] the greatest of Indian poets; while by other equally d=
iscerning minds of=20

another order he will be admired, but not passionately loved.  Yet however =
great the difference=20

between Kalidasa, "the grace of poetry,"[4] and Bhavabhuti, "the master of =
eloquence,"[5] these=20

two authors are far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of them=
 with the author of The Little=20

Clay Cart. Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti are Hindus of the Hindus; the Shakuntala=
 and the Latter Acts=20

of Rama could have been written nowhere save in India: but Shudraka, alone =
in the long line of=20

Indian dramatists, has a cosmopolitan character. Shakuntala is a Hindu maid=
, Madhava is a Hindu=20

hero; but Sansthanaka and Maitreya and Madanika are citizens of the world. =
In some of the more=20

striking characteristics of Sanskrit literature--in its fondness for system=
, its elaboration of style, its=20

love of epigram--Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti are far truer to their native land=
 than is Shudraka. In=20

Shudraka we find few of those splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese[6] =
say, "it is only the=20

words which stop, the sense goes on,"--phrases like Kalidasa's[7] "there ar=
e doors of the=20

inevitable everywhere," or Bhavabhuti's[8] "for causeless love there is no =
remedy." As regards the=20

predominance of swift-moving action over the poetical expression of great t=
ruths, The Little Clay=20

Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of Rama as Macbeth does to Hamlet. A=
gain, Shudraka's=20

style is simple and direct, a rare quality in a Hindu; and although this st=
yle, in the passages of=20

higher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Shudraka cannot infuse i=
nto mere language the=20

charm which we find in Kalidasa or the majesty which we find in Bhavabhuti.=
  Yet Shudraka's=20

limitations in regard to stylistic power are not without their compensation=
. For love of style slowly=20

strangled originality and enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved=
 the death of Sanskrit=20

literature. Now just at this point, where other Hindu writers are weak, Shu=
draka stands forth=20

preeminent. Nowhere else in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such=
 variety, and such=20

drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart; and nowhere else, in the =
drama at least, is there=20

such humor. Let us consider, a little more in detail, these three character=
istics of our author; his=20

variety, his skill in the drawing of character, his humor.  To gain a rough=
 idea of Shudraka's=20

variety, we have only to recall the names of the acts of the play. Here The=
 Shampooer who=20

Gambled and The Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The Storm; and The=
 Swapping of the=20

Bullock-carts is closely succeeded by The Strangling of Vasantasena. From f=
arce to tragedy, from=20

satire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian. Here we=
 have philosophy:=20

_The lack of money is the root of all evil._                 (_i. 14_)  And=
 pathos:      _My body wet by=20

tear-drops falling, falling;       My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;  =
   Flowers from the graveyard=20



torn, my wreath appalling;     For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,=
       And for the fragrant=20

incense of my blood._                 (_x. 3_)  And nature description:    =
  _But mistress, do not scold=20

the lightning. She is your friend,                   This golden cord that =
trembles on the breast=20

Of great Airavata; upon the crest                     Of rocky hills this b=
anner all ablaze;                   This=20

lamp tn Indra's palace; but most blest                     As telling where=
 _De Civitate Dei_, and Denis=20

Foulechat, with very scanty scholarship, set himself to render the _Polycra=
ticus_ of John of=20

Salisbury. The dukes of Bourbon, of Berry, of Burgundy, were also patrons o=
f letters and=20

encouraged their translators. We cannot say how far this movement of schola=
rship might have=20

progressed, if external conditions had favoured its development. In Jean de=
 Montreuil, secretary of=20

Charles VI., the devoted student of Cicero, Virgil, and Terence, we have an=
 example of the true=20

humanist before the Renaissance. But the seeming dawn was a deceptive auror=
a; the early=20

humanism of France was clouded and lost in the tempests of the Hundred Year=
s' War.   III=20

HISTORY  While the mediaeval historians, compilers, and abbreviators from r=
ecords of the past=20

laboured under all the disadvantages of an age deficient in the critical sp=
irit, and produced works=20

of little value either for their substance or their literary style, the chr=
oniclers, who told the story of=20

their own times, Villehardouin, Joinville, Froissart, Commines, and others,=
 have bequeathed to us,=20

in living pictures or sagacious studies of events and their causes, some of=
 the chief treasures of=20

the past. History at first, as composed for readers who knew no Latin, was =
comprised in those=20

_chansons de geste_ which happened to deal with matter that was not wholly-=
-or almost wholly--

the creation of fancy. Narrative poems treating of contemporary events came=
 into existence with=20

the Crusades, but of these the earliest have not survived, and we possess o=
nly rehandlings of=20

their matter in the style of romance. What happened in France might be supp=
osed to be known to=20

persons of intelligence; what happened in the East was new and strange. But=
 England, like the=20

East, was foreign soil, and the Anglo-Norman trouveres of the eleventh and =
twelfth centuries=20

busied themselves with copious narratives in rhyme, such as Gaimar's _Estor=
ie des Engles_=20

(1151), Wace's _Brut_ (1155) and his _Roman de Rou_, which, if of small lit=
erary importance,=20

remain as monuments in the history of the language. The murder of Becket ca=
lled forth the=20

admirable life of the saint by Garnier de Pont-Sainte-Maxence, founded upon=
 original=20

investigations; Henry II.'s conquest of Ireland was related by an anonymous=
 writer; his victories=20

over the Scotch (1173-1174) were strikingly described by Jordan Fantosme. B=
ut by far the most=20

remarkable piece of versified history of this period, remarkable alike for =
its historical interest and=20

its literary merit, is the _Vie de Guillaume le Marechal_--William, Earl of=
 Pembroke, guardian of=20

Henry III.--a poem of nearly twenty thousand octosyllabic lines by an unkno=
wn writer, discovered=20

by M. Paul Meyer in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps. "The masterpiece o=
f Anglo-Norman=20

historiography," writes M. Langlois, "is assuredly this anonymous poem, so =
long forgotten, and=20

henceforth classic."  Prose, however, in due time proved itself to be the f=
itting medium for=20

historical narrative, and verse was given over to the extravagances of fant=
asy. Compilations from=20

the Latin, translations from the pseudo-Turpin, from Geoffrey of Monmouth, =
from Sallust,=20

Suetonius, and Caesar were succeeded by original record and testimony. GEOF=
FROY DE=20

VILLEHARDOUIN, born between 1150 and 1164, Marshal of Champagne in 1191, wa=
s appointed=20

eight years later to negotiate with the Venetians for the transport of the =
Crusaders to the East. He=20

was probably a chief agent in the intrigue which diverted the fourth Crusad=
e from its original=20



destination--the Holy Land--to the assault upon Constantinople. In the even=
ts which followed he=20

had a prominent part; before the close of 1213 Villehardouin was dead. Duri=
ng his last years he=20

dictated the unfinished Memoirs known as the _Conquete de Constantinople_, =
which relate the=20

story of his life from 1198 to 1207. Villehardouin is the first chronicler =
who impresses his own=20

personality on what he wrote: a brave leader, skilful in resource, he was b=
y no means an=20

enthusiast possessed by the more extravagant ideas of chivalry; much more w=
as he a politician=20

and diplomatist, with material interests well in view; not, indeed, devoid =
of a certain imaginative=20

wonder at the marvels of the East; not without his moments of ardour and ex=
citement; deeply=20

impressed with the feeling of feudal loyalty, the sense of the bond between=
 the suzerain and his=20

vassal; deeply conscious of the need of discipline in great adventures; kee=
ping in general a cool=20

head, which could calculate the sum of profit and loss.  It is probable tha=
t Villehardouin knew too=20

much of affairs, and=20


_
And genuine bitterness:      _Pride and tricks and lies and fraud       Are=
 in your face;     False=20

playground of the lustful god,       Such is your face;     The wench's sto=
ck in trade, in fine,=20

Epitome of joys divine,       I mean your face--     For sale! the price is=
 courtesy.     I trust you'll find=20

a man to buy       Your face._                                             =
   (_v. 36_)  It is natural that Shudraka=20

should choose for the expression of matters so diverse that type of drama w=
hich gives the greatest=20

scope to the author's creative power. This type is the so-called "drama of =
invention,"[9] a category=20

curiously subordinated in India to the heroic drama, the plot of which is d=
rawn from history or=20

mythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama which fulf=
ils the spirit of the drama=20

of invention, as defined by the Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of =
the "Malati and=20

Madhava," or of the "Mallika and Maruta," is in no true sense the invention=
 of the author; and The=20

Little Clay Cart is the only drama of invention which is "full of rascals."=
[10]  But a spirit so powerful=20

as that of King Shudraka could not be confined within the strait-jacket of =
the minute, and=20

sometimes puerile, rules of the technical works. In the very title of the d=
rama, he has disregarded=20

the rule[11] that the name of a drama of invention should be formed by comp=
ounding the names of=20

heroine and hero.[12] Again, the books prescribe[13] that the hero shall ap=
pear in every act; yet=20

Charudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And further, to=
o experienced a man of the=20

world to be quite frank as a historian: we can hardly believe, as he would =
have us, that the=20

diversion of the crusading host from its professed objects was unpremeditat=
ed; we can perceive=20

that he composes his narrative so as to form an apology; his recital has be=
en justly described as,=20

in part at least, "un memoire justificatif." Nevertheless, there are passag=
es, such as that which=20

describes the first view of Constantinople, where Villehardouin's feelings =
seize upon his=20

imagination, and, as it were, overpower him. In general he writes with a gr=
ave simplicity,=20

sometimes with baldness, disdaining ornament, little sensible to colour or =
grace of style; but by=20

virtue of his clear intelligence and his real grasp of facts his chronicle =
acquires a certain literary=20

dignity, and when his words become vivid we know that it is because he had =
seen with inquisitive=20

eyes and felt with genuine ardour. Happily for students of history, while V=
illehardouin presents the=20

views of an aristocrat and a diplomatist, the incidents of the same extraor=
dinary adventure can be=20

seen, as they struck a simple soldier, in the record of Robert de Clari, wh=
ich may serve as a=20

complement and a counterpoise to the chronicle of his more illustrious cont=
emporary. The=20

unfinished _Histoire de l'Empereur Henri_, which carries on the narrative o=
f events for some years=20

subsequent to those related by Villehardouin, the work of Henri de Valencie=
nnes, is a prose=20

redaction of what had originally formed a _chanson de geste_.  The versifie=
d chronicle or history in=20

the thirteenth=20


_
and others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too closely to t=
he technical=20

definitions.  The characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and wom=
en. Even when the type=20

makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case of Charudatta, the =
character lives, in a=20

sense in which Dushyanta[14] or even Rama[15] can among Anglo-Norman writer=
s, but was=20

continued in Flanders and in France. Prose translations and adaptations of =
Latin chronicles,=20

ancient and modern, were numerous, but the literary value of many of these =
is slight. In the Abbey=20

of Saint-Denis a corpus of national history in Latin had for a long while b=
een in process of=20

formation.=20


_
individualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates him sharply f=
rom other Indian=20

dramatists. He draws on every class of society, from the high-souled Brahma=
n to the executioner=20

and the housemaid.  His greatest character is unquestionably Sansthanaka, t=
his one of the monks=20

of the Abbey--perhaps a certain Primat--compiled, in the second half of the=
 century, a History of=20

France in the vernacular--the _Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denis_--with whi=
ch later additions=20

were from time to time incorporated, until under Charles V.=20
