[Illustration: HE DISCOVERED ANOTHER BEAR WATCHING THE STREAM]  He did not =
have=20

long to wait, for a gust of wind soon dropped a bit of bark upon the stream=
 near the crouching=20

bear.  There was a spray of water, and a flash of the silver sides of the s=
almon as it darted to the=20

surface.  Then the bear on the rock reached down with her paw and, with a l=
ightning-like motion,=20

batted the fish out of the water and well up on the bank.  Black Bruin, dur=
ing his year of wild life,=20

had found several dead fish, which he had eaten with great relish.  So, wit=
hout waiting to consider=20

that the prize did not belong to him, he started out of the bushes for it. =
 But the real fisherman=20

rushed at him with such ferocity that he quickly retreated to cover and sat=
 watching while she killed=20

the fish.  When it had been dispatched, the lucky fisherman took it in her =
mouth and went away=20

into the woods with the prize.  Black Bruin followed at a distance, smellin=
g of the bushes, where=20

the fish brushed in passing, leaving a tantalizing scent.  favor the union =

=E2=80=9CI am rather indisposed today, my dear monsignore, which is unusual=
 with me, and scarcely equal=20

to such a theme, doubtless of the deepest interest to me and to all. I myse=

know, that all mankind were praying under the same roof. I shall continue i=

morning. Perhaps you will permit me to think over what you have said with s=
o much beauty and=20

force.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI had forgotten that I had a letter to deliver to=
 you,=E2=80=9D said Catesby; and he drew from his=20

breast-pocket a note which he handed to Lothair, who opened it quite uncons=
cious of the piercing=20

and even excited observation of his companion.  Lothair read the letter wit=
h a changing=20

countenance, and then he read it again and blushed deeply. The letter was f=
rom Miss Arundel.=20

After a slight pause, without looking up, he said, =E2=80=9CNine o=E2=80=99=
