philodendron monstera     II.  The Falling Almshouses.   "I'm afraid, Ned, =
that there were but poor collections in church to-day," observed Persis to =
her husband, as they sat together by the fire on the evening of the followi=
ng Sunday.  "I'm not afraid, but I'm certain of it," replied Ned Franks. "S=
ands told me this afternoon that the whole collections after the two sermon=
s only came up to four pound three, and when our poor vicar's boldly; but t=
he man's knowledge of my name was ominous. If the Paris police had contrive=

thing for Maxine, it looked as if they knew enough to play the game in thei=
r own way--whatever that might be.  "Perhaps I should say, the thing which =
Mademoiselle lent--to a friend in England, and Monsieur has now kindly retu=

d Monsieur has now kindly returned," amended the Commissary _
a baby three weeks old; and Persis, who, despite her confidence in her husb=
and, feels a little=20

nervous on account of her fragile treasure, is not sorry when the infant is=
 once more resting upon=20

her own gentle breast.  But the buoyant mirth of the young father is calmed=
 down, and his=20

sunburnt face, though still bright with happiness, wears a graver and more =
earnest expression=20

when he stands up to address a few words to his guests. As he raises his ri=
ght hand a little, all the=20

murmur of merry voices is hushed at once, and for some seconds there is no =
sound heard but the=20

soft breeze stirring the young leaves budding on the elms. Then Franks spea=
ks a few earnest=20

words; for, whether in sorrow or in joy, the teacher at Colme never forgets=
 the office to which he=20

has been appointed by his heavenly Master,--that of feeding, as far as he h=
as power to do so, the=20

lambs committed to his charge.  "My children," thus the sailor began, "this=
 is a very joyful, a very=20

thankful, and also a very solemn day to me and my wife. We have seen, as it=
 were, a little boat=20

freighted with an immortal soul, launched on the wide sea, bound for the po=
rt of Heaven. If I did=20

not trust that He who gave it will guide it, I should have many fears when =
I think of all the storms=20

that it may meet on its course, the rocks and the shoals on which many a po=
or bark has been=20

wrecked. But I have given my boy to God, and whether the voyage be a long o=
r a short one, a=20

rough or a smooth one, I trust that the little boat will drop anchor in the=
 harbor of glory at last!" Ned=20

paused a little, and Persis, as she bent down and pressed a long, fond kiss=
 on her sleeping infant,=20

left a tear on his soft cheek, but not a tear of sorrow; no feeling of misg=
iving dimmed the bright=20

hope of the mother's heart.  "And now," continued Franks to his pupils, "le=
t me just add a few=20

words to yourselves. You also have all been launched on the great voyage, a=
nd I trust that you all=20

have Faith for your compass, the Bible for your chart, and heaven for your =
port; but I must remind=20

you that you have need to keep a good lookout for breakers ahead, that you =
must steer warily, and=20

mind your soundings. There's danger of running on the sandbank of the love =
of money, or of being=20

drawn into the whirlpool of intemperance; there's the iceberg of falsehood =
on the one hand, the=20

sunken rock of self-righteousness on the other. When temptation would, like=
 a strong current, draw=20

you near any dangerous place, don't trust your own seamanship, boys, to sai=
l close under a rock=20

and yet not strike it; give it as wide a berth as you can; sheer off, I wou=
ld say, sheer off! And,=20

above all, look straight up to Him whose wind alone can fill your sails, an=
d bear you onwards in=20

your course; look to him in storm and in calm, in gloom and in sunshine, pr=
aying is Ivor Dundas."=20

"No other," said I. "Didn't the--weren't you warned who would be the man to=
 come?"  "No," she=20

replied. "Only the assumed name of the messenger and place of meeting were =
wired. It was safer=20

so, even though the telegram was in a cypher which I trust nobody knows--ex=
cept myself and one=20

other. But I'm glad--glad it's you. It was clever of--him, to have sent you=
. No one would dream that-

-no one would think it strange if they knew--as I hope they won't--that you=
 came to Paris to see=20

me. Oh, the relief that you've got through safely! Nothing has happened? Yo=
u have--the paper?"=20

"Nothing has happened, and I have the paper," I reassured her. "No adventur=
es, to speak of, on=20

the way, and no reason to think I've been spotted. Anyway, here I am; and h=
ere is something=20

which will put an end to your anxiety." And I tapped the breast of my coat,=
 meaningly.  "Thank=20

God!" breathed Maxine, with a thrilling note in her voice which would have =
done her great credit on=20

the stage, though I am sure she was never further in her life from the thou=
ght of acting. "After all=20

I've suffered, it seems too good to be true. Give it to me, quick, Ivor, an=
d let me go."  "I will," I said.=20

"But you might seem to take just a little more interest in me, even if you =
don't really feel it, you=20



know. You might just say, 'How have you been for the last twelve months?'" =
 "Oh, I do take an=20

interest, and I'm grateful to you--I can't tell you how grateful. But I hav=
e no time to think either of=20

you or myself now," she said, eagerly. "If you knew everything, you'd under=
stand."  "I know=20

practically nothing," I confessed; "still, I do understand. I was only teas=
ing you. Forgive me. I=20

oughtn't to have done it, even for a minute. Here is the letter-case which =
the Foreign--which was=20

given to me to bring to you."  "Wait!" she exclaimed, still in the half whi=
sper from which she had=20

never departed. "Wait! It will he better to lock the door." But even as she=
 spoke, there came a=20

knock, loud and insistent. With a spring, she flung herself on me, her hand=
 fumbling for the pocket=20

I had tapped suggestively a moment ago. I let her draw out the long case wh=
ich I had been=20

guarding--the case I had not once touched since leaving London, except to f=
eel anxiously for its=20

outline through my buttoned coat. At least, whatever might be about to happ=
en, she had it in her=20

own hands now.  Neither of us spoke nor made a sound during the instant tha=
t she clung to me,=20

the faint, well-remembered perfume of her hair, her dress, in my nostrils. =
But as she started away,=20

and I knew that she had the letter-case, the knock came again. Then, before=
 I could be sure=20

whether she wished for time to hide, or whether she would have me cry "come=
 in," without=20

seeming to hesitate, the door opened. For a second or two Maxine and I, and=
 a=20


_
you here by his grace, and afterwards receive you to glory!"  The address o=
f Ned Franks was=20

simple and homely, characteristic of the speaker, and suited to the hearers=
, who were well=20

accustomed to his sea-phrases. Franks had once compared himself to a buoy a=
nchored down to=20

warn vessels where navigation is dangerous; and not only his pupils, but ma=
ny a tempted one who=20

came in his wandering course nigh to the school-master of Colme, had cause =
to thank God for the=20

buoy. If the account of such a life of lowly usefulness as that of Ned Fran=
ks have any attraction for=20

the reader; if, in his own voyage over life's perilous sea, while he blesse=
s the beacon, he despises=20

not the buoy; while honoring God's gifted ministers, if he feels that there=
 is spiritual work also for=20

those who have little eloquence but that of a consistent Christian life,--h=
e may find in these pages=20

something to interest him, and possibly, if God bless my humble labors, to =
help him to "sheer off"=20

from some of the dangerous points where hopes have too often been wrecked, =
and promising=20

barks have deepening pink dusk: but I could scarcely have counted ten befor=
e the long expected=20

light sprang up. I had turned it on in more than one place: and a sudden, b=
rilliant illumination=20

showed me a tall Commissary of Police, with two little gendarmes looking ov=
er his shoulder.  I=20

threw a glance at Maxine, who was still veiled, and was relieved to see tha=
t she had found some=20

means of putting the letter-case out of sight. Having ascertained this, I s=
harply enquired in French=20

what in the devil's name the Commissary of Police meant by walking into an =
Englishman's room=20

without being invited; and not only that, but what under heaven he wanted a=
nyway.  He was far=20

more polite than I was.  "Ten thousand pardons, Monsieur," he apologised. "=
I knocked twice, but=20

hearing no answer, entered, thinking that perhaps, after all, the salon was=
 unoccupied. Important=20

business must be my excuse. I have to request that Monsieur Dundas will fir=
st place in my hands=20

the gift he has brought from London to Mademoiselle de Renzie."  "I have br=
ought no gift for=20

Mademoiselle de Renzie," I=20
