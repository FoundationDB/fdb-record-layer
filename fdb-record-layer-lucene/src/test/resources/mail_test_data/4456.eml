Bony and I were going after you."  "Say, what about our deer, that you shot, Jack?" asked Nat a 

little later. "Can't we go get it?"  "Not to-night," replied Jack. "I wouldn't venture in among those 

peaks in the dark for ten deer. We'll get it in the morning."  "Hu! Mebby none left," grunted the 

Indian.  "None left? What do you mean?"  "Plenty things eat um. Bears, rats, foxes, mebby." 

"Well, we'll have to shoot another, that's all," said Jack. "But did you fellows have any luck?" 

"Bony shot a jack-rabbit," replied Sam, "but the rest of us didn't get anything, though I fired at a big

in a few weeks. How many young ladies have married against their parents' wishes, and have

invariably bring ruin upon themselves, unless they repent.  BEGIN IN THE HOME.  The first four 

commandments deal with our relations to God. They tell us how to worship and when to worship; 

they forbid irreverence and impiety in word and act. Now God turns to our relations with each 

other, and isn't it significant that He deals first with family life? "God is going to show us our duty to 

our neighbor. How does He begin? Not by telling us how kings ought to reign, or how soldiers 

ought to fight, or how merchants ought to conduct their business, but how boys and girls ought

fuel could easily be thrown on.  The whole party, with Long Gun included, left after breakfast to

right, they are almost sure to fulfil the law both in regard to God and man. Parents stand in the 

place of God to their children in a great many ways until the children arrive at years of discretion. If 

the children are true to their parents, it will be easier for them to be true to God. He used the
