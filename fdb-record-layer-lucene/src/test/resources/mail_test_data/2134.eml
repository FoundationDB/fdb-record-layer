philodendron monstera diminutions or additions in such a manner that these =
diminutions or additions in the symmetrical relations may be seen to be mad=
e on correct principles, and without detracting at all from the effect.  2.=
 The look of a building when seen close at hand is one thing, on a height i=
t is another, not the same in an enclosed place, still different in the ope=
n, and in all these cases it takes much judgment to decide what is to be do=
ne. The fact is that the life he will prepare many hundreds of chemicals of=
 exceptional purity; he will write a number of dry and very accurate memora=
nda, will make some dozen conscientious translations, but he won't do anyth=
ing striking. To do that one must have imagination, inventiveness, the gift=
 of insight, and Pyotr Ignatyevitch has nothing of the kind. In short, he i=
s not a master in science, but a journeyman.  Pyotr Ignatyevitch, Nikolay, =
and I, talk in subdued philodendron monstera diminutions or additions in su=
