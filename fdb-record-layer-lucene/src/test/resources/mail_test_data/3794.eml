Publishers        under my hat. Well, what's the news?"  "That if we want any coal we shall have to 

fetch it ourselves. And we can get it in small amounts from greengrocers. Why greengrocers, I 

don't know."  "I suppose they have to have fires to force the cabbages. But what about the striking 

coal-porters? If you do their job, won't they picket you or pick-axe you or something?"  "Oh, of 

course, I should hate to go alone. But I shall be all right if you come with me."  Celia's faith in me is 

very touching. I am not quite so confident about myself. No doubt I could protect her easily against 



five or six great brawny hulking porters ... armed with coal-hammers ... but I am seriously doubtful 

whether a dozen or so, aided with a little luck, mightn't get the better of me.  "Don't let us be rash," 

I said thoughtfully. "Don't let us infuriate them."  "You aren't afraid of a striker?" asked Celia in 

amazement.  "Of an ordinary striker, no. In a strike of bank-clerks, or--or chess-players, or 

professional skeletons, I should be a lion among the blacklegs; but there is something about the 

very word coal-porter which----You know, I really think this is a case where the British Army might 

help us. We have been very good to it."  The British Army, I should explain, has been walking out 

with Jane lately. When we go away for week-ends we let the British Army drop in to supper. 

Luckily it neither smokes nor drinks nor takes any great interest in books. It is a great relief, on 

your week-ends in the country, to _know_ that the British Army is dropping in to supper, when 

otherwise you might only have suspected it. I may say that we are rather hoping to get a position 

in the Army Recruiting film on the strength of this hospitality.  "Let the British Army go," I said. 

"We've been very kind to him."  "I fancy Jane has left the service. I don't know why."  "Probably 

they quarrelled because she gave him caviare two nights running," I said. "Well, I suppose I shall 

have to go. But it will be no place for women. To-morrow after-noon I will sally forth alone to do it. 

But," I added, "I shall probably return with two coal-porters clinging round my neck. Order tea for 

three."  Next evening, after a warm and busy day at the office, I put on my top-hat and tail coat 

and went out. If there was any accident I was determined to be described in the papers as "the 

body of a well-dressed man." To go down to history as "the body of a shabbily-dressed individual" 

would be too depressing. Beautifully clothed, I jumped into a taxi and drove to Celia's greengrocer. 

Celia herself was keeping warm by paying still more calls.  "I want," I said nervously, "a 

hundredweight of coal and a cauliflower." This was my own idea. I intended to place the 

cauliflower on the top of a sack, and so to deceive any too-inquisitive coal-porter. "No, no," I 

should say, "not coal; nice cauliflowers for Sunday's dinner."  "Can't deliver the coal," said the 

greengrocer.  "I'm going to take it with me," I explained.  He went round to a yard at the back. I 

motioned my taxi along and followed him at the head of three small boys who had never seen a 

top-hat and a cauliflower so close together. We got the sack into position.  "Come, come," I said to 

the driver, "haven't you ever seen a dressing-case before? Give us a hand with it or I shall miss 

my train and be late for dinner."  He grinned and gave a hand. I paid the greengrocer, pressed

Off to Italy   In a top-story bedroom in an old-fashioned house in a northern suburb of London, a 

girl of fourteen was kneeling on the floor, turning out the contents of the bottom cupboards of a big 

bookcase. Her method of doing so was hardly tidy; she just tossed the miscellaneous assortment 

of articles down anywhere, till presently she was surrounded by a mixed-up jumble of books, 

papers, paint-boxes, music, chalks, pencils, foreign stamps, picture post-cards, crests, balls of 

knitting wool, skeins of embroidery silk, and odds and ends of all kinds. She groaned as the circle 

grew wider, yet the apparently inexhaustible cupboards were still uncleared.  "Couldn't have ever 

believed I'd have stowed so many things away here. And, of course, the one book I want isn't to 

be found. That's what always happens. It's just my bad luck. Hello! Who's calling 'Renie'? I'm here! 

_Here! In my bedroom!_ Don't yell the house down. Really, Vin, you've got a voice like a 

megaphone! You might think I was on the top of the roof. What d'you want now? _I'm busy!_"  "So 

it seems," commented the fair-haired boy of seventeen, sauntering into his sister's room and 

taking a somewhat insecure seat upon a fancy table, where, with hands in pockets, he regarded 

her quizzically. "Great Scott, what a turn out! You look like a magician in the midst of a magic 

circle. Are you going to witch the lot into newts and toads? Whence this thusness? You won't 

persuade me that it's a fit of neatness and you're actually tidying. Doesn't exactly seem _you_, 

somehow!"  "Hardly," replied Irene, with her head inside a cupboard. "Fact is, I'm looking for my 

history book. I can't think where the wretched thing has gone to. School begins to-morrow, and I 

haven't touched my holiday tasks yet; and what Miss Gordon will say if I come without those 

exercises I can't imagine. I'm sure I flung all my books into this cupboard, and, of course, here's 

the chemistry, which I don't want, but never so much as a single leaf of the history. Don't grin! You 

aggravate me. I believe you've taken it away to tease me. Have you? Confess now! It's in your 

pocket all the time?"  Irene looked eagerly at the bulging outline of her brother's coat, but her 

newly formed hopes were doomed to disappointment.  "Never seen it! What should _I_ want with 

your old history book? I've finished for good with such vanities, thank the Fates!"  "Don't rub it in. 

It's a beastly shame _you_ should be allowed to leave school while _I_ must go slaving on at Miss 

Gordon's. Ugh! How I hate the place! The idea of going back there to-morrow! It's simply appalling. 



A whole term of dreary grind, and only a fortnight's holiday at the end of it. Miss Gordon gives the 

_stingiest_ holidays. If my fairy godmother could appear and grant me a wish I should choose 

never, never, _never_ to see St. Osmund's College in all my life again. I'd ask her to wave her 

magic wand and transport me over the sea."  Irene spoke hotly, flinging books about with scant 

regard for their covers. Her slim hands were dusty, and her short, yellow hair as ruffled as her 

temper. There was even a suspicion of moisture about the corners of her gray eyes. She rubbed 

them surreptitiously with a ball of a handkerchief when her head happened to be inside the 

cupboard. She did not wish Vincent to witness this phase of her emotions.  "Every girl ought to be 

provided with a decent fairy godmother," she gulped. "If mine did her duty she'd come to rescue 

me now. Yes, she would, and be quick about it too!"  How very seldom in the course of an ordinary 

life such wishes are granted! Not once surely in a million times! Yet at that identical moment, 

almost as if in direct answer to her daughter's vigorous tirade, Mrs. Beverley entered the room. 

There was a sparkle of excitement in her eyes, and her whole atmosphere seemed to radiate 

news. She ran in as joyously as a girl, clapping her hands and evidently brimming over with 

something she was about to communicate.  "Why, Mums! Mums--darling! What's the matter?" 

asked Irene. "You look as if you'd had a fortune left you. Tell us at once."  "Not quite a fortune, but 

next best to it," said Mrs. Beverley, sitting down on the end of the sofa. "Daddy says I may tell you 

now, bairns. It has all happened so suddenly, and has been arranged in a rush. You remember 

Dad mentioning a few weeks ago that Mr. Southern, the firm's representative in Naples, was very 

ill? Well, Mr. Fenton has decided to send Dad to Italy to take his place, for a year at any rate, and 

perhaps longer. We're to start in a fortnight."  Such a stupendous announcement required a little 

realizing. Vincent removed his hands from his pockets.  "You don't mean to say we're _all_ 

going?" he inquired. "Jemima! Leaving London fogs and toddling off to Italy? Materkins, you take 

my breath away! How's the whole business to be fixed up so soon?"  "Quite easily. We shall let 

this house, just as it is, to Mr. Atherton, who will come from the Norfolk branch to fill Father's post 

in London. We are to rent Mr. Southern's flat in Naples, while he takes a voyage round the world 

to try to regain his health. Dad means to put you into his office in Naples, Vin. Don't look so 

aghast! It's high time you started, and it will be a splendid opening for you. And as for Renie--of 

course she's too young to leave school yet----"  "Mums! Mums!" interrupted an agonized voice, as 

Irene took a flying leap over her circle of books and, plumping herself on the sofa, clutched tightly 

at her mother's sleeve. "You're not going to leave me behind at Miss Gordon's? You _couldn't_! 

Oh, I'd die! Mums darling, please! If the family's going to jaunt abroad I've got to jaunt too! Say 

yes, quick, quick!"  "What a little tempest you are! Cheer up! We'd never any intention of deserting 

you. We'll stick together for a while at any rate, though when we arrive in Naples you'll be packed 

off to a boarding-school, Madam, so I give you fair warning."  "An Italian school?"  Irene's gray 

eyes were round with horror.  "No, an Anglo-American school for English-speaking girls. Do you 

remember that charming Mr. Proctor who stayed with us last year on his way from New York to 

Naples? His daughter is at this school, and he strongly recommended it. It seems just exactly the 

place for you, Renie. It will solve a great problem if we can educate you out there. It would have 

complicated matters very much if we had been obliged to leave you in England. As it is you'll be 

quite near to Naples, and can come home for all your holidays."  "Hooray! Then I'm not to go to 

Miss Gordon's again?"  "As we start in a fortnight it's not worth while your beginning a fresh term 



at St. Osmund's."  "Then I needn't bother to cauliflower into the hand of the smallest boy, and 

drove off....  It was absurdly easy.  There was no gore at all.  "There!" I said to Celia when she 

came back. "And when that's done I'll get you some more."  "Hooray! And yet," she went on, "I'm 

almost sorry. You see, I was working off my calls so nicely, and you'd been having some quite 

busy days at the office, hadn't you?"  A. A. M.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: This is not

OLYMPIC TALENT.  (A topical fantasy suggested by the decay of our athletic prowess and the 

apparent apathy of the nation as to the fate that may befall it in the international contest of 1916.) 

My England, so the chance has fled!     Olympian years to come shall knot not   The athlete's 

guerdon for thy head     But crown the wigs of Serbs and what not.    There were who sought thy 

shame to shield     From men that mocked the sea-kings' fibres   By opening funds, but these 

appealed     To singularly few subscribers.    "A trifling hundred thou.," they wrote,     "To ease the 

joints and stiffening sockets."   The public acted like a goat,     They kept the cash inside their 

pockets.    So mused I sadly; and since new     Sensations oft from grief can jerk us   I went to see 

the "Wonder Zoo,"     Herr HAGENBECK's surprising circus.    There where the Model Homes 

were built     That left some while ago the bard bored   I watched the Nubian lions wilt     In 

imitation lairs of cardboard.    And sudden, whilst I saw them roll--     Those monster cats--beyond 

their ha-ha,   A solace came into my soul,     I murmured _sotto voce_, "Aha!    "If but yon sunken 

fence were filled,     So that these grim-faced brutes might cross it,   Are there no athletes here 

undrilled,     Veiled by their adipose deposit?    "In slothful ease Britannia shirks;     But haply, near

old tales are wrong     And lions climb--from that asylum   I should come out extremely, strong, 

Using my brolly for a pilum."  Evoe.         *       *       *       *       *  THE INDOMITABLES.  There is 

trouble ahead for some of our Peers.  I have just come across three fore-warnings of it.  The first 

was in the train. A fat man was telling his grievance to a thin man.  "I'll stick at nothing," he said. "I 

mean to see this through. The idea! Why, we've only been in the house seven weeks. Remember 

that. Remember also that gas is half-a-crown a thousand. And understand that we're most 

economical; we're always turning the lights down, my wife and I. Now then; in spite of this the 

rascals want me to pay on sixty thousand feet! It's preposterous. We couldn't have got through so 

much if we had never let a burner or a stove go out day or night. And we're economical! What do 

you say to that?"  The thin man said that he had never heard anything so infamous in his life.  "But 

I'm going to fight it, I can tell you," said the fat man. "Oh yes. If necessary I'll take it to the House of 

Lords."  "Quite right," said the thin man, picking up his paper.  The second case was late at night, 

in the corner of a restaurant. Two men were talking near me and I heard most of it.  "It was like 

this," said one, who might have been a journalist from the look of him, to the other, whom I could 

not exactly place, but fancied he was perhaps remotely connected with music. He yawned rather 

more than I should have liked had I been the narrator. "It was like this. There were eight of us to 



dinner and five of us had old brandy at two bob a go. Only five. The first lot was poured out by the 

waiter, so there can be no trouble over that; that's ten bob. Then three or four of us had another 

go. Do you see?"  The musician came back to earth and said that he saw.  "Very well. Even 

supposing that we did overpour a little, we didn't have more than ten portions altogether. That I 

can swear to. Yet what do you think the bill said? 'Liqueurs, two pounds.' Think of it!"  The 

musician woke up and made the motions of a man thinking of it and finding it the limit.  "Of course 

I refused to pay," the journalist went on.  "Of course," said the musician.  "And now we're fighting 

it. But I don't care if it breaks me, I'll resist it. If necessary I'll take it to the House of Lords."  The 

third case happened only this morning. I met in the street an artist friend.  "Hullo," I said, "I don't 

often see you out and about at this hour when there's so little decent daylight."  "No," he said, "it's 

an awful bore, but I've got to see a lawyer. The fact is I'm in for litigation."  "You?" I cried.  "Yes, 

me. It's dead against my nature, I know, but this is serious. In the public interest a fellow must do 

something unpleasant now and then."  "What is it?" I asked, drawing him towards a comfortable 

resort where cordials against this appalling weather were obtainable.  "The fact is," he said, "my 

wife's been poisoned."  "Poisoned!"  "I don't mean in the BORGIA way. Not any CATHERINE DE 

MEDICI tricks. No, merely in a London restaurant. Out shopping the other day she had lunch in 

one of those West End places and she's been ill ever since. A dish of curry. Well, I'm going to 

have those people's blood, and incidentally some money too, I hope."  "I wish you joy of the 

experience," I said.  "I know all about that," he replied dismally; "but it's got to be done. And I'm 

going through with it."  "You'll stick at nothing?" I said.  "Nothing," he replied. "If necessary--"  "I 

know," I said.  "What?"  "If necessary you'll take it to the House of Lords."  "Yes; but how did you 

know?"  "I guessed it," I replied; "but you'll be horribly congested there."  And so, I repeat, there is 

a busy time ahead for some of our Peers.         *       *       *       *       *  UNCLE STEVE'S FAIRY. 

You've 'eard 'em tell o' fairy folk     An' all the luck they bring?   Now don't you 'eed the lies that's 

spoke;     _They don't do no such thing_;   You see my thumb, Sir, 'ow it's tore?   You'll say, 

may'ap, a badger boar     'As done it? By your leave,   An' that's a bloomin' fairy, Sir, that bit old 

Uncle Steve!    'Twas me an' Ebenezer Mogg     An' little Essex Jim,   The chap that's got the 

lurcher dog     That's cleverer than 'im,   As met to 'ave a bit o' sport   Among the covers at the 

Court,     Upon the strict q.t.--   That's Ebenezer, then, an' Jim, an' Toby-dog an' me.    At 'alf-past 

ten or so that night     We left "The Chequers'" bar;   'Twas dark, an' down the velvet 'eight     Of 

'eaven fell a star;   The moon was settin' through the trees   As big an' white as 'alf a cheese, 

The very best she could,   Since we 'ad got the long-net out to try the 'Ome Park wood.    We laid it 

'long the cover side,     A furlong "mesh an'-pin";   We sent the lurcher rangin' wide     To drive the 

rabbits in;   A soft, sweet night in late July   We lay among the bracken 'igh     That 'eld the mid-day 

sun,   While mute an' wise ole Toby ranged enjoyin' of the fun.    But soon we 'ears the rabbits 

squeak,     A-kickin' in the cords,   An' gets among 'em, so to speak,     Like gentlemen an' lords; 

We slips along their necks to wring,   When Mogg 'e 'oilers out, "By Jing!     Look, lads, 'ere's 

summut fresh--   A bloomin' fairy-airy 's got 'isself into the mesh!"    We flashed the lanthorn on to 

'im;     I tell you, Sir, 'e lay   A nasty, ugly little limb,     An' yallerer than clay;   An' wicious--

Ebenezer Mogg   Wanted to back 'im 'gainst the dog;     But Jim 'e says, "No go;   This 'ere'll fetch 

a mort o' brass for Mr. BARNUM's show!"    I grabs the little jumpin'-jack;     Says I, "It's gettin' late; 

We'll shove the beggar in the sack     An' see, at any rate." 


_
glad I didn't do those wretched holiday tasks--they'd just have been sheer waste. Mums, I'm so 

excited! May I begin and pack for Italy now? I can't wait."  For the next two weeks great confusion 

reigned in the Beverley household. It is no light matter to decide what you need to take abroad, 

what you wish to lock up at home, and to leave your establishment in apple-pie order for the use of 

strangers. Inventories of furniture, linen, blankets, and china had to be written and checked, a 

rigorous selection made of the things to be packed, and the luggage cut down to the limits 

prescribed by the railway companies. Poor Mrs. Beverley was nearly worn out when at last the 

overflowing boxes were fastened, the bags and hold-alls were strapped, and the taxis, which were 

to take them to the station, arrived at the door. Tears stood in her eyes as she crossed the 

threshold of her own house.  "It's a tremendous wrench!" she fluttered.  "Never mind, Mums!" 

consoled Irene, linking her arm in her mother's. "It's an adventure, and we all want to go. You'll 

love it when we're once off. No, don't look back: it's unlucky! Your bag's in the cab; I saw Jessie 

put it in. Hooray for Italy, say I, and a good riddance to smoky old London! In another couple of 

days we shall be down south and turning into Romeos and Juliets as fast as we can. You'll see 

Dad learning a guitar and strumming it under your balcony, and serenading you no end."  "Hardly 

at his time of life!" said Mrs. Beverley; but the joke amused her, she wiped her eyes, and, as Irene 

had hoped and intended, stepped smiling into the waiting taxi, and left her old home with laughter 

instead of with tears.  In her fourteen years of experience Irene had traveled very little, so the 

migration to Italy was a fairy journey so far as she was concerned. To catch the   'Twas then ole

LA GOLF.  "I want a billiard cue," I said; "one I can travel with comfortably--that folds up, or 

telescopes, or does something of that kind, you know."  "Yes, Sir," said the salesman. "This style 

of cue with a secret joint would probably suit you. It unscrews in the middle, is handy to carry, and 

absolutely reliable when fitted together."  "And now about a case?"  "Yes, Sir. Do you want a case 

for the secret-jointed cue only, or a case for your whole kit?"  "My whole kit?"  "Your complete set 

of cues, Sir."  "Never heard of such a thing."  "I assure you, Sir, that all the best people go in for 

sets--just as with golf, Sir. This is a complete set; the whole, including the case, for ten guineas." 

And he showed me a long green-lined mahogany box containing foreign-looking cues 


_
breakfasted in the train between London and Dover. It was fun to sit in comfortable padded 

armchairs, eating fish or ham and eggs, and watching the landscape whirling past; fun to see the 

deft-handed waiters nipping about with trays or teacups; and fun to observe the occupants of the 

other tables in the car. There was a fat, good-natured Frenchman who amused Irene, a languid 

English lady who annoyed her, an elderly gourmand who excited her disgust, and a neighboring 

party, one member of which at least aroused her interest and caused her to cast cautious side 

glances in the direction of the next table. This center of attraction was a small girl about eight or 

nine years of age, a dainty elfin little person with bewitching blue eyes and a mop of short, flaxen 

curls. She was evidently well used to traveling, for she would lift a tiny finger to summon the 

waiter, and gave him her orders with all the _savoir-faire_ of an experienced diner-out. Perhaps 

her clear-toned treble voice was a trifle too high-pitched for the occasion, and would have been 

better had it been duly modulated, but her parents seemed proud of her conversational powers 

and allowed her to talk for the benefit of anybody within ear-shot. That she excited comment was 

manifest, for many looks were turned to her corner. The criticisms on her were complimentary or 

the reverse. "Isn't she perfectly _sweet_?" gushed a young lady at Irene's left. "Sweet? She ought 

to be in the nursery instead of showing off here!" came a tart voice in reply, from some one whose 

face was invisible but whose back and shoulders expressed an attitude of strong disapproval. 

"Hope we shan't be boxed up with her in the same carriage to Paris! I vote we give her a wide 

berth at Calais."  Irene packed as carefully as a set of drawing instruments.  "Would you mind 

explaining this mystery box to me?" I asked.  "Certainly, Sir," said the obliging young man. "This 

set of cues has been designed for the billiard player who spends his summer on the golf links and 

comes back in the autumn to billiards with the golf-habit highly developed. That is, the habit 

acquired on the links of using different clubs for the various shots. Now this cue--"  "Oh, that, of 

course, is an ordinary cue," I interrupted. "Never mind that one; introduce me to the others." 

"Pardon me, Sir, it only _looks_ like an ordinary cue. A steel tube has been inserted down its 

interior--"  "Do I understand that billiard cues have also taken to hunger-striking?"  The shopman 

forced a polite but cheerless smile and continued, "This makes the cue perfectly rigid and 

inflexible--"  "It has the same effect on the hunger-strikers, I am told."  "--and eminently suitable for 

its special purpose. We call it the 'Driver' cue--for driving off from baulk and for follow-throughs, 

forcing strokes and all-round cannons."  "Ah, and what is the hammer-headed instrument for? It 

looks more like a club than a cue."  "Yes, Sir. There is nothing in the rules to prevent the use of a 

club. If I may point it out to you, Sir, there is here a special appeal to the ladies, who are now 

coming into the game in ever increasing numbers. Up to the present time most lady players have 

failed completely to bring off a successful masse shot; but with the 'Hammer' cue used as a club--

over the shoulder (_so_)--"  "I see! You play it with a downward smashing blow, eh? An appeal to 

the militant billiardette?"  "Precisely, Sir."  "And what is this for?" I pulled out of the case a cue with 

the point

felt she would have gravitated towards her compartment rather than have avoided her. But 

traveling companions were evidently more a matter of chance than choice, for the crowd that 

turned out of the train at Dover became mixed and mingled like the colored bits of glass in a 

kaleidoscope. Irene realized that for the moment the one supreme and breathless object in life 

was to cling to the rest of her family, and not to get separated from them or lost, as they pushed 

through narrow barriers, showed tickets and passports, traversed gangways, and finally found 

themselves on board the Channel steamer bound for France. Father, who had made the crossing 

many times, scrambled instantly for deck-chairs, and installed his party comfortably in the lee of a 

flattened on one side, as if some one had begun to sharpen it like a pencil and left off after the first 

big slash.  "That is called the 'Jumper,'" explained the young man, "and may be roughly likened to 

the niblick in golf. Playing it with the flat side of the point lying on the table (_so_) you can lift or 

jump a ball over any obstacle, such as a cut in the cloth, or ash accidentally dropped from your 

opponent's cigar. In Snooker it is a _sine qua non_.  "Here, again, is what we call the 'Potter'; it is 

telescopic. One hand only is required when using the 'Potter.' You take aim as with a pistol, the 

inner tube or cue being projected against the ball by means of concealed springs which are 

worked by this trigger in the butt. The sights are 


_
where they would be sheltered from the wind. Mrs. Beverley, who had inspected the ladies' saloon 

below, sank on her seat, and tucked a rug round her knees with a sigh of relief.  "It will be the 

'Black Hole of Calcutta' downstairs," she remarked. "I'd rather stay on deck however cold it is. The 

mother of the wee yellow-haired lassie is lying down already, evidently prepared to be ill. The 

stewardess says we shall have a choppy passage. She earns her tips, poor woman! Thanks, 

Vincent! Yes, I'd like the air-cushion, please, and that plaid out of the hold-all. No, I won't have a 

biscuit now; I prefer to wait till we get on terra firma again."  Irene, sitting warmly wrapped up on 

her deck-chair, watched the white cliffs of Dover recede from her gaze as the vessel left the port 

and steamed out into the Channel. It was the last of "Old England," and she knew that much time 

must elapse before she would see the shores of her birthplace again. What would greet her  "And 

this fellow with the open nozzle?"  "That is our 'Patent Vacuum' cue, Sir, for screw-back shots. By 

means of this miniature bellows in the butt a jet of air is pumped upon the ball, through the open 

nozzle or tip, at whatever velocity is desired. When the striking ball has made contact with the 

object ball, suction is immediately produced by releasing this fan, which you may see just inside 

the nozzle."  "By Jove!" I said, "I must have one of those. No, I won't take the whole set; I can't 

afford a caddie to go round a billiard room with me."  "Thank you, Sir," returned the shopman. 

"Perhaps you might consider our latest marking-board for your own room--our Cinema-Board. For 

the slate in the centre we have substituted revolving illuminated films showing the leading players 

at work. Information and instruction hand-in-hand with pleasure. When you go to the board to 

register the score you often get a hint from the moving picture.... No, Sir? Have you

she was going? New sights, new sounds, new interests--perhaps new friends? The thought of it all 

was an exhilaration. Others might seem sad at a break with former associations, but as for herself 

she was starting a fresh life, and she meant to get every scrap of enjoyment out of it that was 

practically possible.  The stewardess had prophesied correctly when musical pockets? Quite the 

latest New Year billiard novelty. When the ball drops into the net the weight presses on this stop, 

which releases a musical phrase from a musical-box under the table. We have some delightful 

rag-time effects for Pool.... Not to-day, Sir? Thank you, Sir. The 'Vacuum Patent' and the secret-

jointed cue shall be delivered this
