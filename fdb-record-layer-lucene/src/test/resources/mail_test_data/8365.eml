out, Joe came along--

and with one quick angry look he hurried into the building. Quite furious a=

Ethel turned to her companion--but Mrs. Grewe smiled queerly and held out h=

with an angry frown, but to her indignant reproaches he replied by a quizzi=

Ethel." He took her arm, in a kind protecting sort of way which made her fa=
