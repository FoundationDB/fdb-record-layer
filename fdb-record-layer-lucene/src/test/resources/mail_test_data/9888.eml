ct character of which at=20



this hour it was difficult to recognize, for, even as Theodora mentioned to=
 Lothair that they now=20

beheld the object of their journey, the twilight seemed to vanish and the s=
tars glistened in the dark=20

heavens.  Though the building seemed so near, it was yet a considerable tim=
e before they=20

reached the wooded hill, and, though its ascent was easy, it was night befo=
re they halted in face of=20

a huge gate flanked by high stone walls. A single light in one of the windo=
ws of the vast pile which=20

it enclosed was the only evidence of human habitation.  The corporal sounde=
d a bugle, and=20

immediately the light moved and noises were heard=E2=80=94the opening of th=
e hall-doors, and then the=20

sudden flame of torches, and the advent of many feet. The great gate slowly=
 opened, and a=20

steward and several serving-men appeared. The steward addressed Theodora an=
d Lothair, and=20

invited them to dismount and enter what now appeared to be a garden with st=
atues and terraces=20

and fountains and rows of cypress, its infinite dilapidation not being reco=
gnizable in the deceptive=20

hour; and he informed the escort that their quarters were prepared for them=
, to which they were at=20

once attended. Guiding their captain and his charge, they soon approached a=
 double flight of=20

steps, and, ascending, reached the main terrace from which the building imm=
ediately rose. It was,=20

in truth, a castle of the middle ages, on which a Roman prince, at the comm=
encement of the last=20

century, had engrafted the character of one of those vast and ornate villas=
 then the mode, but its=20

original character still asserted itself, and, notwithstanding its Tuscan b=
asement and its Ionic=20

pilasters, its rich pediments and delicate volutes, in the distant landscap=
e it still seemed a fortress=20

in the commanding position which became the residence of a feudal chief.  T=
hey entered, through=20

a Palladian vestibule, a hall which they felt must be of huge dimensions, t=
hough with the aid of a=20

single torch it was impossible to trace its limits, either of extent or of =
elevation. Then bowing before=20

them, and lighting as it were their immediate steps, the steward guided the=
m down a long and lofty=20

corridor, which led to the entrance of several chambers, all vast, with lit=
tle furniture, but their wells=20

covered with pictures. At length he opened a door and ushered them into a s=
aloon, which was in=20

itself bright and glowing, but of which the lively air was heightened by it=
s contrast with the=20

preceding scene. It was lofty, and hung with faded satin in gilded panels s=
till bright. An ancient=20

chandelier of Venetian crystal hung illumined from the painted ceiling, and=
 on the silver dogs of the=20

marble hearth a fresh block of cedar had just been thrown and blazed with a=
romatic light.  A lady=20

came forward and embraced Theodora, and then greeted Lothair with cordialit=

neglect and time, and sustained by columns of precious marbles, were sudden=
ly opened and=20

revealed another saloon, in which was a round table brightly lighted, and t=
o which the princess=20

invited her friends.  Their conversation at dinner was lively and sustained=
; the travels of the last=20

two days formed a natural part and were apposite to commence with, but they=
 were soon=20

engrossed in the great subject of their lives; and Colonna, who had left Ro=
me only four-and-twenty=20

hours, gave them interesting details of the critical condition of that capi=
tal. When the repast was=20

concluded the princess rose, and, accompanied by Lothair, reentered the sal=
oon, but Theodora=20

and Colonna lingered behind, and, finally seating themselves at the farthes=
t end of the apartment=20

in which they had dined, became engaged in earnest conversation.  =E2=80=9C=

 And indeed there are moments=20



when I sometimes think she is one of those beautiful divinities that we onc=
e worshipped in this=20

land, and who, when they listened to our prayers, at least vouchsafed that =
our country should not=20

be the terrible wilderness that you crossed this day.=E2=80=9D  In the mean=
 time Colonna, with folded arms=20

and eyes fixed on the ground, was listening to Theodora.  =E2=80=9CThus you=
 see,=E2=80=9D she continued, =E2=80=9Cit=20

comes to this=E2=80=94Rome can only be freed by the Romans. He looks upon t=
he secret societies of his=20

own country as he does upon universal suffrage=E2=80=94a wild beast, and da=
ngerous, but which may be=20

watched and tamed and managed by the police. He listens, but he plays with =
them. He=20

temporizes. At the bottom of his heart, his Italian blood despises the Gaul=
s. It must be something=20

deeper and more touching than this. Rome must appeal to him, and in the ine=
ffable name.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt has=20

been uttered before,=E2=80=9D said Colonna, looking up at his companion, =
=E2=80=9Cand=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D And he hesitated.  =E2=80=9CAnd=20

in vain you would say,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CNot so. There was a=
 martyrdom, but the blood of Felice=20

baptized the new birth of Italian life. But I am not thinking of bloodshed.=
 Had it not been for the=20

double intrigues of the Savoyards it need not then have been shed. We bear =
him no ill-will=E2=80=94at=20

least not now=E2=80=94and we can make great offers. Make them. The revoluti=
on in Gaul is ever a=20

mimicry of Italian thought and life. Their great affair of the last century=
, which they have so marred=20

and muddied, would never have occurred had it not been for Tuscan reform; 1=
848 was the echo of=20

our societies; and the Seine will never be disturbed if the Tiber flows unr=
uffled. Let him consent to=20

Roman freedom, and =E2=80=98Madre Natura=E2=80=99 will guarantee him agains=
t Lutetian barricades.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is only=20

the offer of Mary-Anne in another form,=E2=80=9D said Colonna.  =E2=80=9CGu=
arantee the dynasty,=E2=80=9D said Theodora.=20

=E2=80=9CThere is the point. He can trust us. Emperors and kings break trea=
ties without remorse, but he=20

knows that what is registered by the most ancient power in the world is sac=
red.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCan republicans=20

guarantee dynasties?=E2=80=9D said Colonna, shaking his head.  =E2=80=9CWhy=
, what is a dynasty, when we are=20

dealing with eternal things? The casualties of life compared with infinite =
space? Rome is eternal.=20

Centuries of the most degrading and foreign priestcraft=E2=80=94enervating =
rites brought in by=20

Helliogabalus and the Syrian emperors=E2=80=94have failed to destroy her. D=
ynasties! Why, even in our=20

dark servitude we have seen Merovingian and Carlovingian kings, and Capets,=
 and Valois, and=20

Bourbons, and now Bonapartes. They have disappeared, and will disappear lik=
e Orgetorix and the=20

dynasties of the time of Caesar. What we want is Rome free. Do not you see =
that everything has=20

been preparing for that event? This monstrous masquerade of United Italy=E2=
=80=94what is it but an=20

initiatory ceremony, to prove that Italy without Rome is a series of provin=
ces? Establish the Roman=20

republic, and the Roman race will, as before, conquer them in detail. And, =
when the Italians are=20

thus really united, what will become of the Gauls? Why, the first Bonaparte=
 said that if Italy were=20

really united the Gauls would have no chance. And he was a good judge of su=
ch things.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat=20

would you have me do, then?=E2=80=9D said Colonna.  =E2=80=9CSee him=E2=80=
=94see him at once. Say every thing that I=20

have said, and say it better. His disposition is with us. Convenience, all =
political propriety, counsel=20

and would justify his abstinence. A return to Rome would seem weak, fitful,=
 capricious, and would=20

prove that his previous retirement was ill-considered and ill-informed. It =
would disturb and alarm=20

Europe. But you have, nevertheless, to fight against great odds. It is =E2=
=80=98Madre Natura=E2=80=99 against St.=20

Peter=E2=80=99s. Never was the abomination of the world so active as at pre=
sent. It is in the very throes of=20

its fell despair. To save itself it would poison in the Eucharist.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CAnd if I fail?=E2=80=9D said Colonna.  =E2=80=9CYou=20

will not fail. On the whole, his interest lies on our side.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThe sacerdotal influences are very strong=20

there. When the calculation of interest is fine, a word, a glance, sometime=

have a fatal effect.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll depends upon him,=E2=80=9D said=

CHAPTER 57 When Captain Muriel and his detachment returned to the camp, the=
y found that the=20

force had been not inconsiderably increased in their absence, while the tid=
ings of the disposition of=20

the Italian army brought by the recruits and the deserters from the royal s=
tandard, cherished the=20

hopes of the troops, and stimulated their desire for action. Theodora had b=
een far more=20

communicative during their journey back than in that of her departure. She =
was less absorbed,=20

and had resumed that serene yet even sympathizing character which was one o=
f her charms.=20

Without going into detail, she mentioned more than once to Lothair how reli=
eved she felt by=20

Colonna accepting the mission to Paris. He was a person of so much influenc=
e, she said, and of=20

such great judgment and resource. She augured the most satisfactory results=
 from his presence=20

on the main scene of action.  Time passed rapidly at the camp. When a life =
of constant activity is=20

combined with routine, the hours fly. Neither letter nor telegram arrived f=
rom Colonna, and neither=20

was expected; and yet. Theodora heard from him, and even favorably. One day=
, as she was going=20

the rounds with her husband, a young soldier, a new recruit, approached her=
, and, pressing to his=20

lips a branch of the olive-tree, presented it to her. On another occasion w=
hen she returned to her=20

tent, she found a bunch of fruit from the same tree, though not quite ripe,=
 which showed that the=20

cause of peace had not only progressed but had almost matured. All these co=
mmunications=20



sustained her sanguine disposition, and, full of happy confidence, she labo=
red with unceasing and=20

inspiring energy, so that when the looked-for signal came they might be pre=
pared to obey it; and=20

rapidly gather the rich fruition of their glorious hopes.  While she was in=
 this mood of mind, a scout=20

arrived from Nerola, bringing news that a brigade of the French army had po=
sitively embarked at=20

Marseilles, and might be hourly expected at Civita Vecchia. The news was ab=
solute. The Italian=20

consul at Marseilles had telegraphed to his government both when the first =
regiment was on board=20

and when the last had embarked. Copies of these telegrams had been forwarde=
d instantly by a=20

secret friend to the volunteers on the southern frontier.  When Theodora he=
ard this news she said=20

nothing, but, turning pale, she quitted the group round the general and has=
tened to her own tent.=20

She told her attendant, the daughter of the=20

's goals and ensuring=20

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for g=

side and a revolver in=20

her hand, and she would have used both weapons sooner than that her mistres=
s should be=20
