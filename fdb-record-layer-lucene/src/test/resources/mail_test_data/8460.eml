and from warm quarters; for oil ought not to be chilled, but should be kept=
 thin by gentle heat. In=20

dimensions, oil rooms should be built to accommodate the crop and the prope=
r number of jars,=20

each of which, holding about one hundred and twenty gallons, must take up a=
 space four feet in=20

diameter. The pressing room itself, if the pressure is exerted by means of =
levers and a beam, and=20

not worked by turning screws, should be not less than forty feet long, whic=
h will give the lever man=20

a convenient amount of space. It should be not less than sixteen feet wide,=
 which will give the men=20

who are at work plenty of free space to do the turning conveniently. If two=
 presses are required in=20

the place, allow twenty-four feet for the width.  4. Folds for sheep and go=
ats must be made large=20

enough to allow each animal a space of not less than four and a half, nor m=
ore than six feet.=20

Rooms for grain should be set in an elevated position and with a northern o=
r north-eastern=20

exposure. Thus the grain will not be able to heat quickly, but, being coole=
d by the wind, keeps a=20

long time. Other exposures produce the corn weevil and the other little cre=
atures that are wont to=20

The rings at the bell may follow one another endlessly, but I will confine =
my description here to=20

four of them. The bell rings for the fourth time, and I hear familiar foots=
teps, the rustle of a dress, a=20

dear voice....  Eighteen years ago a colleague of mine, an oculist, died le=
aving a little daughter=20

Katya, a child of seven, and sixty thousand roubles. In his will he made me=
 the child's guardian.=20

Till she was ten years old Katya lived with us as one of the family, then s=
he was sent to a=20

boarding-school, and only spent the summer holidays with us. I never had ti=
me to look after her=20

education. I only superintended it at leisure moments, and so I can say ver=
y little about her=20

childhood.  The first thing I remember, and like so much in remembrance, is=
 the extraordinary=20

trustfulness with which she came into our house and let herself be treated =
by the doctors, a=20

trustfulness which was always shining in her little face. She would sit som=
ewhere out of the way,=20

with her face tied up, invariably watching something with attention; whethe=
r she watched me=20

writing or turning over the pages of a book, or watched my wife bustling ab=
out, or the cook=20

scrubbing a=20

warmest place in the farmhouse, provided that it is not exposed to the kitc=
hen fire; for when=20

draught animals are stabled very near a fire, their coats get rough.  5. Fu=
rthermore, there are=20

advantages in building cribs apart from the kitchen and in the open, facing=
 the east; for when the=20

oxen are taken over or the dog playing, her eyes invariably expressed the s=
ame thought--that is,=20

"Everything that is done in this world is nice and sensible." She was curio=
us, and very fond of=20

talking to me. Sometimes she would sit at the table opposite me, watching m=
y movements and=20

asking questions. It interested her to know=20


_
sleeker as they take their fodder in the sunlight. Barns for grain, hay, an=
d spelt, as well as=20

bakeries, should be built apart from the farmhouse, so that farmhouses may =
be better protected=20

against danger from fire. If something more refined is required in farmhous=
es, they may be=20

constructed on the principles of symmetry which have been given above in th=
e case of town=20

houses, provided that there is nothing in such buildings to interfere with =
their usefulness on a farm.=20

6. We must take care that all buildings are well lighted, but this is obvio=
usly an easier matter with=20

those which are on country estates, because there can be no neighbour's wal=
l to interfere,=20

whereas in town high party walls or limited space obstruct the light and ma=
ke them dark. Hence=20

we must apply the following whether I was not afraid of the dead bodies, wh=
at I did with my salary.=20

"Do the students fight at the University?" she would ask.  "They do, dear."=
  "And do you make=20

them go down on their knees?"  "Yes, I do."  And she thought it funny that =
the students fought and=20

I made them go down on their knees, and she laughed. She was a gentle, pati=
ent, good child. It=20

happened not infrequently that I saw something taken away from her, saw her=
 punished without=20

reason, or her curiosity repressed; at such times a look of sadness was mix=
ed with the invariable=20

expression of trustfulness on her face--that was all. I did not know how to=
 take her part; only when=20

I saw her sad I had an inclination to draw her to me and to commiserate her=
 like some old nurse:=20

the wall that seems to=20

obstruct the light to the point at which it ought to be introduced, and if =
a considerable space of=20

struction to the light in=20

that situation.  7. But if there are timbers in the way, or lintels, or upp=
er stories, then, make the=20

In that respect she was=20

like me. I, too, am fond of pretty clothes and nice scent.  I regret that I=
 had not time nor inclination=20

to watch over the rise and development of the passion which took complete p=
ossession of Katya=20

when she was fourteen or fifteen. I mean her passionate love for the theatr=
e. When she used to=20
