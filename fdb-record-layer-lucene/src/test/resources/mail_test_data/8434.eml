dracaena marginata   17. _Collections of American Minerals._  We are inform=
ed that under the auspices of Col. Gibbs, a collection of American minerals=
 by states, according to the arrangement of the minerals of the departments=
 of France, in the cabinet of the school of mines at Paris, was begun some =
time dracaena marginata   17. _Collections of American Minerals._  We are i=
nformed that under the auspices of Col. Gibbs, a collection of American min=
erals by states, according to the arrangement of the minerals of the depart=
ments of France, in the cabinet of the school of mines at Paris, was begun =
some time _
"Now," said Ted, looking at Wolcott Norris, "is the time for you to spin us=
 a yarn."  "Yes," replied=20

the mining engineer gazing at the three of them with an expression that the=
y later remembered, "I=20

guess this _is_ the time to spin you a yarn."  To their surprise he got up =
abruptly from his splint-

backed chair and went out to his bedroom. As he returned he was thrusting s=
omething into his=20

coat pocket.  "After I got through Jefferson," he said, when he was sitting=
 in front of the fireplace=20

once more, "I went to technical school to study engineering--mining enginee=
ring--which meant that=20

when I started out to work I traveled round the country from one place to a=
nother, and within a=20

short time I had a commission to go to China. When I went I took some one w=
ith me."  Wolcott=20

Norris paused and for a minute or two gazed straight before him. None of th=
e three listeners=20

interrupted the silence; there had been a quality in the mining engineer's =
voice which had made=20

them feel that they were about to hear something unusual.  "Here's her pict=
ure," he said, and took=20

from his pocket the object he had placed there on entering the room a few m=
oments before. He=20

handed it to Teeny-bits, who bent forward a little so that the glow from th=
e firelight fell on the=20

photograph. Neil Durant and Ted Norris leaned toward him and the three of t=
hem saw the likeness=20

of a young woman with smiling eyes and fine, clear features.  "Mighty nice =
looking," said Neil=20

Durant. "She reminds me of some one I've seen before, I can't think where."=
  There was a slight=20

unsteadiness in Wolcott Norris' voice when he spoke again, but he overcame =
it and went on with=20

his story rapidly.  "We were married just after I got my new job, went out =
to San Francisco and=20

sailed for China on the Japanese steamer _Tenyo Maru_. It was a wonderful w=
orld to us then--

more wonderful than I can describe to you. Rain or shine, every day was a p=
erfect day, and we=20

sailed on and on in that little old steamer out across the Pacific until we=
 came at last to Asia. For=20

several months we were in Shanghai at the headquarters of the company, then=
 they sent me up=20

into the province of Honan to a little place called Tung-sha on a tributary=
 of the Yangtse in a=20

country that was pretty wild.  "There was gold and copper back in the hills=
 and the company=20

intended to carry on extensive operations if the ground proved worth while.=
 How strange it seemed=20

to us to find a bit of a foreign colony--a handful of Americans and British=
 and French, missionaries=20

and representatives of the company--set down in a region that for no one kn=
ows how many=20

thousand years had belonged to the yellow men. You go about in China and yo=
u see single=20

sentence. After commending the condensed and _honest_ manner in which the w=
ork is printed,=20

(for they say, that the same matter which here fills one volume would in En=
gland have been=20

spread over three,) the reviewer adds, "We should be glad to see it reprint=
ed exactly upon the plan=20

of the original; and we have no doubt that it would be found _the most usef=
ul work on mineralogy=20

in our language_." More need not be--more scarcely could be said.   8. _A n=
ew Alkali._  A new=20

alkali has recently been discovered in Sweden, by M. Arfwedson. It is found=
 in the petalite, a=20

mineral from Utoen, in Sweden, in a proportion not over 5 pr. ct.; also in =
the triphane or=20

spodumene, in the proportion of 8 per cent. and in what is called crystalli=
zed lepidolite, in the=20

proportion of 4 per cent. In its general properties it very nearly resemble=
s the other alkalies. When=20

heated in contact with platinum it acts on it. In the galvanic circuit it w=
as decomposed "with bright=20

scintillations, and the reduced metal being separated, afterward burnt." Th=
is metal resembles=20

sodium. The new alkali has been called lithia. (_Jour. of Science of the Ro=
y. Inst._)   9. _Ignited=20

Platinum Wire._  In our last we mentioned the lamp without flame, the ignit=
ion of platinum wire=20

being sustained by means of the vapour of alcohol.  Sir H. Davy has discove=
red that the vapour of=20



camphor answers the same purpose: "If a piece of camphor, or a few small fr=
agments in a heap,=20

be placed in any convenient situation, as on a shilling, the bottom of a gl=
ass, &c. and a piece of=20

platinum wire, either coiled or pressed up together, be heated and laid upo=
n it, the platinum will=20

glow as long as any camphor remains, and will frequently light it up into a=
 flame."    _Jour. Roy.=20

Inst._   10. _Red Rain._  A red rain fell in Naples, (March 14, 1818,) the =
common people were=20

much alarmed, and called it _blood_ or _fire_.  An earthy powder was collec=
ted, which when dry=20

was yellow, unctuous, and of an earthy taste; its specific gravity 2.07.  I=
ts analysis presented silex=20

33--alumine 15.5--chrome 1.-- iron 14.5--carbonic acid 9., and a combustibl=
e substance of a=20

carbonaceous nature.  It is thought that this powder had not a volcanic ori=
gin, and that the=20

presence of chrome assimilates it with meteoric stones. _Ibid._   11. _Gnep=
halium._  Professor=20

Ives has discovered a new species of gnephalium with decurrent leaves, of w=
hich a plate and=20

description will appear in our next number.   12. _Augite._  M. Ha=C3=BCy h=
as united the fassalite and=20

the bakalite with the sahlite, a sub-species of augite. (See Mem. of the Mu=
seum of Nat. Hist. vol.=20

3.)   13. _A New Vegetable Alkali_,  Has been found by Messrs.=20


_
ancient hills, bald and bare, and you feel as if antiquity were casting a s=
pell over you. A person=20

who hasn't lived among the Chinese can't imagine what a strange, superstiti=
ous people they are;=20

more than any other race on the face of the earth they are bound to the pas=
t--and I suppose when=20

we came up there to Tung-sha and began to dig tunnels in their hills we wer=
e breaking the=20

precedent of the past. Still we didn't really expect any trouble--and for m=
any months all went=20

smoothly. Some wonderful things happened up there in that Ignace and the Nu=
x Vomica. It has=20

been named the vaucquelin, in honour of M. Vaucquelin. (Journal de Physique=
, for Aug. 1818.)=20

14. _New Minerals._  Two new mineral species have been discovered, the scor=
rodite from=20

Schnuburg in Saxony, and the tungstate of lead from Zinnwald in Bohemia. _I=
bid._   15. _New=20

Metal._  A new metal has been discovered by Berzilius, in the mines of Fahl=
un in Sweden, to=20

which he has given the name of Selenium. _Ibid._   16. _Pure Alumine._  A l=
arge bed of this=20

substance, perfectly pure, has been found at=20
