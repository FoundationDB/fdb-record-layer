The public business, the excitements of the day, and all the circumstances =
in which we are=20

assembled, make it imperative on me to be brief, and almost entirely occasi=
onal. You have not=20

come here prepared to sit down and listen to a learned discussion, fearfull=
y long, and fearfully dull;=20

and I do not mean you shall be troubled with one. I only ask your attention=
, while I throw out a few=20

hints on the responsibility the people of this country are under, to take c=
are that the men whom=20

they raise to authority, are honest and capable.  In those countries where =
the accident of birth=20

determines who shall rule over them, the people are not responsible for the=
 character and=20

capacities of the men in power. It is true, a corrupt administration is a n=
ational calamity in all=20

governments; but in ours it is at the same time a national calamity, and a =
national sin. From the=20

freedom and frequency of our elections, our public men exist but in the bre=
ath of the people; and if=20

power is put into unworthy hands, or suffered to remain there an hour after=
 it is abused, the people=20

are responsible. It is a fair inference that the whole people have degenera=
ted. It would not be fair=20

to judge the morals of the people of England, or of France, by the morals o=
f the court; but it is=20

perfectly fair to judge the morals of the people of this country by the mor=
als of the men, whom they=20

elevate by their voluntary suffrages to represent the majesty of the nation=
. It is of unspeakable=20

importance, that we should feel that we are implicated, in a manner in whic=
h no other people are in=20

the character of our rulers and the duties resulting from this peculiarity =
of our constitution are=20

weighty and solemn.  Consider too, the effect, which the political observat=
ion of a bad man will=20

have on public opinion, and through public opinion on the public morals. We=
 preach about=20

conscience, the dignity of human nature, the power of religion and divine i=
nfluences; and all this is=20

well. Experience teaches us, however, that all this is nothing, or next to =
nothing, unless=20

countenanced and sustained by public opinion; which fixes the practical sta=
ndard in every place,=20

and few rise much above it, or sink much below it. The history of legislati=
on on such subjects as=20

dueling, lotteries, and the Lord's day, shows us also, that laws, human law=
s, are an absolute=20

nullity, are no better than so much blotted parchment, unless countenanced =
and sustained by=20

public opinion. God forbid that I should speak of that we were to believe i=
n him--you and I,=20

mamma."  "Of course we believe in him," cried Lady Lindores; "but something=
 else must be done,=20

something more. Come this way, Mr Beaufort; Lord Lindores is here."  She ca=
lled him Mr Beaufort=20

without any hesitation now--not pausing, as she had done before, with the m=
ore familiar name on=20

her lips. It was John who was in the foreground now--John who, perhaps, for=
 anything they knew,=20

had caused the event which had put them in mourning. With a whimsical morti=
fication and envy,=20

Beaufort exaggerated in his own mind the distress caused by this event. For=
 the moment he=20

looked upon it as a matter of real loss and pain to this unthinking family =
who showed such interest=20

in the person who perhaps----But the sentiment did not go so far as to be p=
ut into words; it=20

resolved itself into a half-indignant wonder at the interest taken in John,=
 and sense of injured=20

superiority on his own account--he, of whom no man could say that he had be=
en instrumental in=20

causing the death even of a dog.  Lady Lindores led the way hastily into th=
e library, where three=20

figures were visible against the dim light in the window as the others came=
 in. Lord Lindores,=20

seated in his chair; little Millefleurs, leaning against the window, half t=
urned towards the landscape;=20

and in front of the light, with his back to it, Rintoul, who was speaking. =
"With you as bail," he was=20

saying, "he may be set free to-night. Don't let him be a night in that plac=
e."  "Are you speaking of=20

John Erskine, Robin, my dear boy? Oh, not a night, not an hour! Don't lose =
any time. It is too=20



dreadful, too preposterous. Your father will go directly. Take the carriage=
, which is at the door. If=20

we are a little late, what does it matter?" said Lady Lindores, coming forw=
ard, another shadow in=20

the dim light. Millefleurs turned half round, but did not come away from th=
e window on which he=20

was leaning. He was somewhat surprised too, very curious, perhaps a trifle =
indignant, to see all=20

this fuss made about Erskine. He drew up his plump little person, altogethe=
r indifferent to the=20

pronounced manifestation of all its curves against the light, and looked be=
yond Lady Lindores to=20

Edith,--Edith, who hurried after her mother, swift and silent, as if they w=
ere one being, moved by=20

the same unnecessary excitement. Millefleurs had not been in a comfortable =
state of mind during=20

these last days. The delay irritated him; though Lord Lindores assured him =
that all was well, he=20

could not=20


_
human nature; still I cannot but think, that this is a subject on which we =
may be a little too refined,=20

a little too enthusiastic, a little too eloquent for practical purposes. Ge=
nerally and practically=20

speaking, I believe that men are just as good, as they think public opinion=
 requires; and no better.=20

Let it be understood, therefore, that notorious vices will not lose a man t=
he confidence of the=20

people; let it be understood, that the vicious are not only tolerated, but =
trusted and honored, and=20

the great practical restraint on the bad passions is compromised, and all o=
thers will be eluded, or=20

defied.  A mischievous prejudice prevails, that a man's private character h=
as but little to do with his=20

public character. Undoubtedly a man may want some of the qualities necessar=
y to a good father,=20

or a good son, or a good neighbor, and yet make an excellent magistrate or =
judge. Even these=20

defects however, though they may not operate directly, must operate indirec=
tly to injure him in his=20

public capacity; because, by lessening Edith see him, and give him his answ=
er? She was not so=20

overwhelmed with grief for that brute. What did it mean? And now, though sh=
e could not see him=20

on such urgent cause, she was able to interest herself in this eager way on=
 behalf of John Erskine!=20

Millefleurs was very tolerant, and when the circumstances demanded it, coul=
d be magnanimous,=20

but he thought he had reason of offence here.  There was a momentary pause-=
-enough to show=20

that Lord Lindores did not share the feeling so warmly expressed. "I am sur=
prised that you should=20

all be so inconsiderate," he said; "you, at least, Rintoul, who generally s=
how more understanding. I=20

have understood that Erskine had laid himself under suspicion. Can you imag=
ine that I, so near a=20

connection of poor Torrance, am the right person to interfere on behalf per=
haps of his--murd--that=20

is to say, of the cause--of the instrument----"  "It is impossible," cried =
Edith, with such decision that=20

her soft voice seemed hard--"impossible! Can any one suppose for a moment--=
--"  "Be silent,=20


_
least, to lessen the regard felt for him as a public officer. And this, in =
a government like ours, is no=20

trifling consideration; where official dignity depends in so small a measur=
e on the pomp and=20

circumstance of office, but almost entirely on the personal qualities of th=
e incumbent. Besides, the=20

reasons why some defects in a man's private character do not unfit him for =
a public station is, that=20

though criminal in themselves, they do not imply him to be, nor make him to=
 be, absolutely=20

unprincipled. A man may have a very bad temper, for example, and be addicte=
d to many bad=20

habits, without being absolutely unprincipled. Let a man become absolutely =
unprincipled as a=20

private  "Why should she be silent?" said Lady Lindores. "Robert, think wha=
t you are saying. We=20

have all known John Erskine for years. He is as incapable as I am--as unlik=
ely as any one of us=20

here. Because you are so near a connection, is not that the very reason why=
 you should interfere?=20

For God's sake, think of that poor boy in prison--in prison! and lose no ti=
me."  "I will do it, mother,"=20

said Rintoul.  "Oh, God bless you, my boy! I knew you were always right at =
heart."  "Rintoul," said=20

his father, "enthusiasm of this sort is new in you. Let us take a little co=
mmon-sense into the=20

question. In the first place, nothing can be done to-night--that is evident=
. Then consider a moment:=20
