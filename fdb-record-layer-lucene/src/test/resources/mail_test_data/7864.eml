else the one which faces the south has higher columns than the others. A peristyle that has one 

such higher colonnade is called a Rhodian peristyle. Such apartments have fine entrance courts 

with imposing front doors of their own; the colonnades of the peristyles are decorated with 

polished stucco in relief and plain, and with coffered ceilings of woodwork; off the colonnades that 

face the north they have Cyzicene dining rooms and picture galleries; to the east, libraries; 

exedrae to the west; and to the south, large square rooms of such generous dimensions that four 

sets of dining couches can easily be arranged in them, with plenty of room for serving and for the 

amusements.  4. Men's dinner parties are held in these large rooms; for it was not the practice, 

according to Greek custom, for the mistress of the house to be present. On the contrary, such 

peristyles are called the men's apartments, since in them the men can stay without interruption 

from the women. Furthermore, small sets of apartments are built to the right and left, with front 

doors of their own and suitable dining rooms and chambers, so that guests from abroad need not 

be shown into the peristyles, but rather into such guests' apartments. For when the Greeks 

became more luxurious, and their circumstances more opulent, they began to provide dining 

rooms, chambers, and store-rooms of provisions for their guests from abroad, and on the first day 

they would invite them to dinner, sending them on the next chickens, eggs, vegetables, fruits, and 

other country produce. This is why artists called pictures representing the things which were sent 

to guests "xenia." Thus, too, the heads of families, while being entertained abroad, had the feeling 

that they were not away from home, since they enjoyed privacy and freedom in such guests' 

apartments.  [Illustration: _From Bull. de. Corr. Hell. 1895_  GREEK HOUSE AT DELOS]  5. 

Between the two peristyles and the guests' apartments are the passage-ways called "mesauloe," 

because they are situated midway between two courts; but our people called them "andrones." 

This, however, is a very strange fact, for the term does not fit either the Greek or the Latin use of 

it. The Greeks call the large rooms in which men's dinner parties are usually held [Greek: 

andrones], because women do not go there. There are other similar instances as in the case of 

"xystus," "prothyrum," "telamones," and some others of the sort. As a Greek term, [Greek: xystos] 

means a colonnade of large dimensions in which athletes exercise in the winter time. But our 

people apply the term "xysta" to uncovered walks, which the Greeks call [Greek: paradromides]. 

Again, [Greek: prothyra] means in Greek the entrance courts before the front doors; we, however, 

use the term "prothyra" in the sense of the Greek [Greek: diathyra].  [Illustration: _From Mitt. d. 

Deutsch. Arch. Inst_.  GREEK HOUSE DISCOVERED AT PERGAMUM IN 1903  13. Prothyron. 7. 

Tablinum.]  6. Again, figures in the form of men supporting mutules or coronae, we term 

"telamones"--the reasons why or wherefore they are so called are not found in any story--but the 

Greeks name them [Greek: atlantes]. For Atlas is described in story as hissing and convulsive 

movements all over his body, or when he tries to convince me at all costs that Tchatsky, who talks 

so much with fools and is so fond of folly, is a very clever man, and that "Woe from Wit" is not a 

dull play, the stage gives me the same feeling of conventionality which bored me so much forty 

years ago when I was regaled with the classical howling and beating on the breast. And every time 

I come out of the theatre more conservative than I go in.  The sentimental and confiding public 

may be persuaded that the stage, even in its present form, is a school; but any one who is familiar 

with a school in its true sense will not be caught with that bait. I cannot say what will happen in fifty 

or a hundred years, but in its actual condition the theatre can serve only as an entertainment. But 



this entertainment is too costly to be frequently enjoyed. It robs the state of thousands of healthy 

and talented young men and women, who, if they had not devoted themselves to the theatre, 

might have been good doctors, farmers, schoolmistresses, officers; it robs the public of the 

evening hours--the best time for intellectual work and social intercourse. I say nothing of the waste 

of money and the moral damage to the spectator when he sees murder, fornication, or false 

witness unsuitably treated on the stage.  Katya was of an entirely different opinion. She assured 

me that the theatre, even in its present condition, was superior to the lecture-hall, to books, or to 

anything in the world. The stage was a power that united in itself all the arts, and actors were 

missionaries. No art nor science was capable of producing so strong and so certain an effect on 

the soul of man as the stage, and it was with good reason that an actor of medium quality enjoys 

greater popularity than the greatest savant or artist. And no sort of public service could provide 

such enjoyment and gratification as the theatre.  And one fine day Katya joined a troupe of actors, 

and went off, I believe to Ufa, taking away with her a good supply of money, a store of rainbow 

hopes, and the most aristocratic views of her work.  Her first letters on the journey were 

marvellous. I read them, and was simply amazed that those small sheets of paper could contain 

so much youth, purity of spirit, holy innocence, and at the same time subtle and apt judgments 

which would have done credit to a fine masculine intellect. It was more like a rapturous paean of 

praise she sent me than a mere description of the Volga, the country, the towns she visited, her 

companions, her failures and successes; every sentence was fragrant with that confiding 

trustfulness I was accustomed to read in her face--and at the same time there were a great many 

grammatical mistakes, and there was scarcely any punctuation at all.  Before six months had 

passed I received a highly poetical and enthusiastic letter beginning with the words, "I have come 

to love..." This letter was accompanied by a photograph representing a young man with a shaven 

face, a wide-brimmed hat, and a plaid flung over his shoulder. The letters that followed were as 

splendid as before, but now commas and stops made their appearance in them, the grammatical

his vigorous intelligence and ingenuity, he was the first to cause men to be taught about the 

courses of the sun and moon, and the laws governing the revolutions of all the constellations. 

Consequently, in recognition of this benefaction, painters and sculptors represent him as holding 

up the firmament, and the Atlantides, his daughters, whom we call "Vergiliae" and the Greeks 

[Greek: Pleiades], are consecrated in the firmament among the constellations.  7. disappeared, 

and there was a distinctly masculine flavour about them. Katya began writing to me how splendid it 

would be to build a great theatre somewhere on the Volga, on a cooperative system, and to attract 

to the enterprise the rich merchants and the steamer owners; there would be a great deal of 

money in it; there would be vast audiences; the actors would play on co-operative terms.... 

Possibly all this was really excellent, but it seemed to me that

the usual terminology or language, but I have thought that it should be explained so that it may be 

known to scholars.  I have now explained the usual ways of planning houses both in the Italian 

fashion and according to the practices of the Greeks, and have described, with regard to their 

symmetry, the proportions of the different classes. Having, therefore, already written of their 

beauty and propriety, I shall next explain, with reference to durability, how they may be built to last 

to a great age without defects.     CHAPTER VIII  ON FOUNDATIONS AND SUBSTRUCTURES 

1. Houses which are set level with the ground will no doubt last to a great age, if their foundations 

are laid in the manner which we have explained in the earlier books, with from a man's mind. 

However that may have been, for a year and a half everything seemed to go well: Katya was in 

love, believed in her work, and was happy; but then I began to notice in her letters unmistakable 

signs of falling off. It began with Katya's complaining of her companions--this was the first and 

most ominous symptom; if a young scientific or literary man begins his career with bitter 

complaints of scientific and literary men, it is a sure sign that he is worn out and not fit for his work. 

Katya wrote to me that her companions did not attend the rehearsals and never knew their parts; 

that one could see in every one of them an utter disrespect for the public in the production of 

absurd plays, and in their behaviour on the stage; that 


_
But if underground rooms and vaults are intended, their foundations ought to be thicker than the 

walls which are to be constructed in the upper part of the house, and the walls, piers, and columns 

of the latter should be set perpendicularly over the middle of the foundation walls below, so that 

they may have solid bearing; for if the load of the walls or columns rests on the middle of spans, 

they can have no permanent durability.  talked about, actresses of the serious drama demeaned 

themselves by singing chansonettes, while tragic actors sang comic songs making fun of deceived 

husbands and the pregnant condition of unfaithful wives, and so on. In fact, it was amazing that all 

this had not yet ruined the provincial stage, and that it could still maintain itself on such a rotten 

and unsubstantial footing.  In answer I wrote Katya a long and, I must confess, a
