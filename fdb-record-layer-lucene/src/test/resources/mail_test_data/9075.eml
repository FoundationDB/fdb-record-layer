philodendron monstera method has but recently been inaugurated at the Minnesota State Prison. All prisoners are at first compelled to have "photos" taken of the balls of their fingers, the procedure being very simple. The recording officer has an inking-stone and brayer similar to those used in a philodendron monstera method has but recently been inaugurated at the Minnesota State Prison. All prisoners are at first compelled to have "photos" taken of the balls of their fingers, the procedure being very simple. The recording officer has an inking-stone and brayer similar to those used in a _
Museum, says there is such a thing as a "criminal ear." Anthropologists have been giving a great 

deal of study to this matter of late, and their data points to the conclusion that the term "ear-mark" 

is something more than a mere figure of speech. No one has two ears just alike; all ears are faulty 

in one way or another, that is, as to size, shape or position, and these organs do not stop growing 

when the body pauses in its development. At all events, chronic malefactors are apt to be 

disfigured by certain malformations of that organ. It has been proven that abnormalities in the ear 

structure are characteristic features of degenerates. Such abnormalities are commonly found in 

idiots, imbeciles and epileptics, and the prisons contain quite a number of inmates with such ears. 

The sloping ear is bad; it shows a tendency to reversion to the primitive animal ear which slopes. 

The great Napoleon, Lord Byron, Henry Clay and Alexander Hamilton had sloping ears. Another 

objectionable type is the "wing ear," which projects wing-like from the head. This type of ear is said 

to indicate a tendency towards degeneracy; are found in one individual out of every five among 

sane persons, in two out of five among the insane and in three out of every five in criminals, 

occurring twice as often among men as among women.                               [Criminal Ear.] 

Criminal Ear.                      [Right Ear and Trunk Measurements.]                      Right Ear and 

Trunk Measurements.   Considering all available data, it appears that ape-like traits, monkey- 

ancestry being commonly exhibited, are found far less frequently in the ears of women than in 

men. This fact would seem to prove that our female race has progressed the farthest from the 

ancestral type. By carefully feeling with the thumb inside of the edge of the ear and a little behind 

the top a very small lump of cartilage will be found, as if a foreign body had become imbedded in 

the tissue. This is a remnant of what was originally the tip of the ear, when hundreds of thousands 

of years ago that organ in our remote ancestors had a point on it. Among men of note,--statesmen, 

scientists, politicians, etc., it occurs less frequently by about ten per cent. The so-called "Darwinian 

tubercle" appears, as stated, less frequently in women than in men, and is unmistakably a which I 

shall say more in a Treatise by it self. What I mention here, is only with regard to the infusing of 

Herbs in the Tea manner; but there are Infusions of Herbs in Spirits: here the Spirit that the Herbs 

are put into, must be cold, or used without any Fire at all, and the Herbs in this case may be used 

either green or dry; here they may stand several days before the Spirit that they are infus'd in be 

drawn off, as the following Cordial, call'd Surfeit Water, may serve to instance.    To make red 

Surfeit-Water. From Mrs. _B._  To three Gallons of Brandy, put the Flower Leaves of a Bushel of 

red Poppies, one Pound of Raisins of the Sun stoned, a large Stick of Liquorice sliced, a quarter 

Pound of Caraway-Seeds bruised, a large Handful of Angelica, Sweet Marjoram, red Sage, 

Dragon's Mint, and Baulm, of each a handful; let all these be cover'd close in a Glass, or glaz'd 

Earthen Vessel, and stand to infuse or steep in the Brandy for nine Days, keeping it, during that 

time, in a Cellar; then strain it off upon a Pound and half of Loaf-Sugar, and put it into Bottles. This 

is a good Cordial, if used only when occasion requires.  In this Month, Orange-Flowers are in the 

greatest plenty; about half a Pound of them put into a Gallon of Brandy, with a quarter Pound of 

Orange-Peel, and half a Pound of double refin'd Loaf-Sugar, makes a very agreeable Cordial: We 

may let these Ingredients infuse in the Brandy nine or ten days before we pour the Brandy from 

them. Some chuse rather to put the Sugar to the Brandy after it is pour'd from the Orange-

Flowers.  As for the distilling part, we have already several Books which treat largely of that 

Business, both with respect to the management of what is call'd the cold Still, and the Alembick, to 



which I shall refer: but in this place I shall only take notice, that whereas several kinds of distill'd 

Waters are drawn from many Herbs, which do not appear all the Year about; so if one has not an 

opportunity of collecting all our Herbs together, just when we want them, we may yet distil those 

we can get at one time, and make another Distillation of those we collect at another time, and so 

mix both Spirits or Waters together: For Example, in those Cordial Waters where the Ros Solis, or 

Rosa Solis is used, which is an Herb not always to be found, and will not keep above a day or two 

after 'tis gather'd, this I

reverting to the ape. Certain it is that no part of the body can be identified with greater accuracy 

than by the ears. Your own, for example, are not matched exactly by any other pair in the world; 

there are differences which are shown beyond the possibility of mistake, by careful 

measurements, as applied in the Bertillon system. In nine out of every ten persons the ear-lobe 

runs into the flesh of the cheek without any perceptible division between. Experts term this the 

"confluent lobule," and it also is found more often in women than in men. It is said to occur in 92 

per cent of the sane and in 47 per cent of the insane. The most remarkable feature in regard to the 

criminal ear, if it can be so called, is the prominence of the raised area just inside the outer edge, 

the outer edge being termed the "helix" and the part referred to the "anti-helix." It appears that the 

overdevelopment of this portion of the aural structure is particularly characteristic of criminals.  A 

student of this subject can tell a person's age more Waters at pleasure; putting of this such a 

proportion as would have been produced from the quantity directed, of the Plant, in the Receipt, if 

it had been distill'd with the other Herbs: and so of any other Herb that is hard to come by.  This 

Herb, however, I may inform my Reader, grows in Bogs, and when we find it we may preserve it 

artificially, by either planting it immediately in other boggy places, or else in artificial Bogs, made of 

Earth and Water in Tubs, or Earthen Pots, made without holes at the bottom.  This Season affords 

us great variety of Necessaries for Food, in the Farm and Garden; the Pond Fish, as Pike or Jack, 

Carp, Tench, and Perch, as well as Eels are in Season, and may be prepared for the Table, as 

directed in _March;_ there are likewise green Geese, young Ducks, Chickens, Pigeons, and 

Rabbits in the artificial Warren; and in the Garden, Spinage and Cabbage-Lettuce to boil, some 

forward Pease and Beans, Asparagus, Artichokes, the first Cabbages, and Caulyflowers, 

Cucumbers for stewing and in raw Sallads:

observation of the ears than by any other way. Even women, who, in other respects, preserve the 

youthfulness of their appearance to an advanced period are apt to betray their maturity through 

this organ, which acquires a sharp definition of contour, a tiny wrinkle appearing just in front of it. 

Some people are able to of some warm Herbs, as I have directed in my _New Improvement of 

Planting and Gardening._ The Method which I most approve of for dressing a Sallad, is, after we 

have duly proportion'd the Herbs, to take two thirds Oil Olive, one third true Vinegar, some hard 

Eggs cut small, both the Whites and Yolks, a little Salt and 


_
primeval animal traits: Our remote ancestors unquestionably wagged their ears, and every human 

being today is provided with ear-wagging muscles. In most individuals, however, these muscles 

have become so far rudimentary that they are useless for wagging purposes. 

THE FINGER PRINT SYSTEM   Our new arrival is still in the hands of the record officer; his next 

introduction is to what pour'd over the Sallad, having first cut the large Herbs, such as Sallery, 

Endive, or Cabbage-Lettuce, but none of the small ones: then mix all these well together, that it 

may be ready just when you want to use it, for the Oil will make it presently soften, and lose its 

briskness. Onions should always be kept in reserve, because it is not every one that like their 

relish, nor is Oil agreeable to every one;
