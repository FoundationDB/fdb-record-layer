burning for four or five hours with a continual supply of wood, so that the walls become red-hot. At 

the expiration of the blaze, the foot should be laid upon the glowing embers, and the hole covered 

closely with thick pieces of green wood laid parallel together to form a ceiling; this should be 

covered with wet grass, and the whole plastered with mud, and stamped tightly down to retain the 

heat. Upon the mud, a quantity of earth should be heaped, and the oven should not be opened for 

thirty hours, or more. At the expiration of that time, the foot will be perfectly baked, and the sole 

will separate like a shoe, and expose a delicate substance that, with a little oil and vinegar, 

together with an allowance of pepper and salt, is a delicious dish that will feed about fifty men. 

The fiery dragon!  Mrs Dashwood heard them go, and turned with a little sigh to her washing-tub. 

She was very proud of Joe, and she had good reason to be, for he was one of the best men in the 

Red Brigade, and, what was of more importance to her, he was one of the best husbands in the 

world. Perhaps this was largely owing to the fact that she was one of the best of wives!  His career 

as a fireman had been short, but he had already become known as one of the daring men, to 

whom their Chief looked when some desperate service had to be performed.  On several 

occasions he had, while in charge of the fire-escape, been the means of saving life. Upon the 

whole, therefore, it is not surprising that Mary was proud of her husband--almost as proud of him 

as she was of the little rosebud; but in

generally fat and juicy. I have frequently used the fat of the animal for cooking, but it should be 

taken from the body without delay; as, if left for a few hours, it partakes of the peculiar smell of the 

elephant, which no amount of boiling will overcome. The boiling of fat for preservation requires 

much care, as it should attain so great a heat that a few drops of water thrown upon the surface 

will hiss and evaporate as though cast upon mind.  Meditating on Joe, and giving an occasional 

glance at May, whose sweet upturned face seemed nothing short of angelic, Mrs Dashwood 

continued energetically to scrub the fairy-like habiliments, and make the soapsuds fly.  Meanwhile, 

the red engine whirled along its fiery course at full gallop, like a horrible meteor, clattering loudly in 

the deserted streets of the great city.  So it would have sped in its wild career even if it had
