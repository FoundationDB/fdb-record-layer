his own part, he did not think it much mattered, if the candidate was "a re=
gular gentleman," which=20

house he put up at. This shrewd policeman thought it would be all the same,=
 if the candidate had=20

about him friends who knew their business.  The policeman's advice was take=
n in the selection of=20

a central committee-room,--the Green Swan with Two Tails, which, let me con=
fess and regret, was=20

a comparatively humble place for head-quarters. I should have very much pre=
ferred the first hotel=20

in the town; and if that had been possible, I would have yielded up the pla=
ce in week. Easter=20

preserves the name of =C5=92stara, Teuton goddess of springtime, of new lif=
e, new light. So the names=20

of the winds remain. Auster, the south wind, has his memorial in Australia.=
 Zephyr, the gentle west=20

wind, is still a theme for poet=E2=80=99s song. Rude Boreas, =E2=80=9Cblust=

the north. Civilization has not driven him from his domain. =C3=86olus, the=
 master spirit, most powerful=20

because most delicate and beautiful, still stirs our wind-harps with his br=
eath. The spirits of the air=20

are as boisterous and untamed as in the days of=20


_
Jollefat was enthroned. However, as the sequel will show, this matter did n=
ot influence the=20

success of the _coup_.  Without further loss of time--that is to say, early=
 next morning--my man=20

went to work. The first person to whom, as the agent of the independent can=
didate, he paid his=20

addresses, was not the mayor of the town, nor the town-clerk, nor an alderm=
an, nor a town-

councillor, but he was--a bill-sticker.  There consequently appeared upon t=
he walls an address,=20

which ran as follows:               "_To the Free and Independent Electors =
of the=20

Borough of N----._       "GENTLEMEN,--Your borough has too often been the a=
rena of faction=20

fights. You have been regarded as the supporters of Whig and Tory.      You=

traditions and your eminent public virtues      have not been respected, ca=
red for, understood, or=20

who have      hitherto=20

aspired to the most honourable distinction of representing      you in  And=
 what figures would=20

appeal more strongly to the imagination than these simple personifications?=
 How can too great=20

importance be attached to the part the winds perform in the economy of natu=

land would become a Sahara; the seas would be covered with a London fog. In=
 the rustle of the=20

breeze, as well as in the roar of hurricane, there is purpose and energy. T=

controls the other. =E2=80=9CHe holdeth the wind in his fists.=E2=80=9D  In=
 every age man=E2=80=99s imagination has been=20

strongly influenced by the mysterious or unknown. There is little play for =
poetic sentiment in the=20

cold practicality of science. That which is clearly comprehended, loses hal=
f its charm. The botanist=20

carefully plucks to pieces a flower; it is analyzed, and all its mechanism =
understood--but it is no=20

longer a flower. The alchemist has produced the wonderful science of chemis=
try; but the=20

America,      and seen them in practical operation; and having, moreover, r=
