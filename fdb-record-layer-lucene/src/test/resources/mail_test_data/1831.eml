and I don't think the rooms do look like the rooms of a palace to-day. Plea=
se, Poppy, look round=20

you, and see if you can see any goodness shining on the walls, and if you c=
an see through Love's=20

glass into the street."  "Oh lor! no, Miss Daisy; I'm not so fanciful. The =
walls is just fairly neat, and=20

the windows, they're just like any other attic windows. Now, missy, you're =
just fairly worn out, and=20

you shall shut your eyes and go to sleep."  Poor little Daisy was so weary =
and weak that she=20

absolutely did close her eyes, and comforted and soothed by Poppy's presenc=
e, she fell into a=20

short and uneasy doze. She awoke in about an hour, and lay quite still, wit=
h her eyes wide open.=20

Poppy said something to her, but she replied, in an imploring tone.  "Pleas=
e let me think. I had a=20

dream when I was asleep. I did something in the dream, and I think I'll do =
it now really--only you=20

must let me think Poppy."  "Think, away, pretty little miss," said Poppy: "=
and while you are=20

worriting your poor little brain over thoughts I'll take it upon me to prep=
are a bit of dinner for you."=20

Poppy made some tea, and boiled an egg, and toasted some bread to a light a=
nd tempting brown.=20

When the meal was prepared she brought it to Daisy, who said wistfully--  "=
If I do what I want I=20

must be strong, so I'll eat up that egg, and I'll take some toast, and you =
must take something too,=20

Poppy."  "Seeing as I can't get no meal till to-morrow morning I'm not incl=
ined to refuse a good=20

offer," said Poppy. "You don't know, missy, as I'm going back to my native =
'ome to-night."=20

"Poppy," said Daisy, suddenly, taking no notice of this remark, "do you kno=
w if Mrs. Ellsworthy is a=20

very rich woman?"  "Mrs. Ellsworthy of Shortlands?" said Poppy; "why, in co=
urse; ever since I can=20

remember, my mother has said to me, 'Poppy, child, them there Ellsworthys i=
s made of money.'"=20

"Made of money," repeated Daisy, a little shadowy smile coming to her face;=
 "then they must be=20

really rich. Do you think, Poppy, that Mrs. Ellsworthy is rich enough to gi=
ve away L17 10_s._ to=20

buy the daily bread, and to help a little girl who could not help being sel=
fish out of a dreadful dark=20

dungeon? Mrs. Ellsworthy has always been very kind, and I used to love her =
when I lived at home,=20

but if I thought she was not really very, very rich, I would not ask her, f=
or that might be putting=20

_her_ to great trouble. Losing money makes one's heart ache terrible, Poppy=
, and I would rather=20

bear my own heartache than give it to another person."  "Mrs. Ellsworthy is=
 made of money,"=20

repeated Poppy, "and L17 10_s._ would be no more than a feather's weight to=
 her. All the same, I=20

can't make out what you're driving at, Miss Daisy."  "I wonder if Mrs. Ells=
worthy is at Shortlands=20

now," continued Daisy.  "To be sure she is, Miss Daisy; shall I take her an=
y message when I goes=20

back home?"  "Oh, no, Poppy, thank you very much. Poppy, I wish you had not=
 lent all that money=20

to Jasmine two days ago--you have not any money in your pocket now, have yo=
u, Poppy?"  Poppy=20

gave a slight sigh.  "Just the price of a third single to Rosebury, and no =
more, Miss Daisy, nothing=20

more than that! There are reverses far harder to bear than financial ones."=
  Her father appeared=20

older than she had ever seen him. Dejection showed through every line of hi=
s haggard face. The=20

side-whiskers, which to his daughter's mind he had worn with great distinct=
ion, now gave to his=20

worn features a grotesque expression.  "I feel pretty well worn out to-nigh=
t, my dear,"--weariness=20

was in every word he uttered,--"and as if I need some one to lean on. If I =
did not need you to help=20

me, I should not be bothering you at this hour of the night."  The girl dre=
w before her father's chair=20

the footstool which earlier in the evening she had kicked into a far corner=
. She sat at his knee,=20

and, taking his hand in hers, pressed it against her cheek. For some time t=
hey sat thus in silence.=20

Her father broke in on the quietness of the room with a peculiar question. =
 "The Bible tells us that=20

we should love our enemies, doesn't it, Beth?"  "But, Father, you have no e=
nemies worth worrying=20



about! Why should you ask such a question?"  "They may not be worth worryin=
g about, but as I=20

said before I don't seem able to fight off worry as I once could."  "Nonsen=
se! When all this blows=20

over you will see where you have been very foolish to have worried in the l=
east bit. You are not=20

strong, and everything appears worse than it really is."  "I don't know abo=
ut that, my dear. I'm not=20

so certain, either, that my enemies are not worth worrying about."  "Of cou=
rse they're not. Just=20

think how all the people have honored you for what you have done for Little=
 River. Your gifts will=20

not be so quickly forgotten that a total stranger can change the feeling of=
 respect for you among=20

your lifelong friends."  "I'm aware of all that, and I appreciate it."  "Wh=
at has all this to do about=20

Uncle Josiah's leaving town?"  "I'm coming to that. Suppose one of those yo=
u called my lifelong=20

friends proved to be just the opposite?"  "That can't be true about Uncle J=
osiah!"  "Public=20

expressions of gratitude can never atone for the knife which a supposedly c=
lose friend drives into=20

one's heart."  Elizabeth unconsciously drew away. The movement was slight, =
but her father=20

noticed it.  "Beth, Josiah has gone to the city to-night for no good purpos=
e."  "Do you think he went=20

alone?" With a savage leap the question got beyond the bounds of her lips. =
 "I doubt it. Just what=20

part the other will play, I don't know. But of one thing I'm certain, Josia=
h is bent on ill."  Elizabeth=20

felt that her old friend was being weighed in the balances. She could not t=
rust her words to the=20

emotion she felt.  "Do you think you are in a position to understand what I=
'm trying to tell you?"=20

"Father," she said, speaking slowly that she might not lose control of hers=
elf, "if you were not so=20

serious about this, I should be tempted to laugh at your little melodramati=
c farce. It is the most=20

ridiculous thing in all the world for you to imagine that Uncle Josiah woul=
d play double with us! He=20

is too good-hearted for even one evil suggestion to get into his mind."  "I=
 did not want to tell you=20

the fact, but I fear I must. Of late he has been=20


_
"Oh, dear me," said Daisy, "it's just exactly that much money which would m=
ake me perfectly=20

happy. Must you go to Rosebury to-night, Poppy?"  "Well, missy, I'd do some=
thing to make you=20

'appy, but I don't know where to go if I don't go to my home--to be sure, A=
unt Flint would give her=20

eyes to get me back again, but I fears that even for you, Miss Daisy, I can=
't bear no more of that=20

Sarah game."  "But don't you think you might be able to bear it just for a =
week, Poppy? If I loved=20

you always and always all the rest of my life, do you think you could bear =
it just for one little week=20

longer? I'd be sure to let you have the money back again then, dear Poppy."=
  Poppy gazed hard at=20

the child, who was sitting upright on her sofa, with her cheeks flushed and=
 her eyes shining, and a=20

fitful quiver about her pretty lips.  "What does it all mean?" I should hav=
e secured a boat for him.=20

That may account for his action."  "What dreadful thing has he done? I can'=
t imagine----"=20

"Crookedness comes from the most unexpected sources," cut in her father, cu=
rtly.  "But such a=20

thing would not be unexpected from Uncle Josiah, it would be impossible."  =
The Elder lowered his=20

eyes to meet those peering at him from the tangle of fair hair. "As I have =
already suggested, you=20

might not understand me. It seems that you are determined not to understand=
. It would be very=20

hard for me to have another falling out with my little girl. Maybe I should=
 say nothing further."  "If=20

you are intending to say something against Uncle Josiah, perhaps you had be=
tter not say it. I'm=20

afraid I wouldn't understand."  She turned from her father and tried to gaz=
e through the window.=20

The beating storm, and the light from=20


_
common worries ails the little dear. I'm sure I'd bear Sarah to my dying da=
y to help her, the sweet=20

lamb! I wonder, now, has she lost some of Miss Primrose's money. I know the=
y're short enough of=20

means, the darling ladies, and maybe the child has mislaid some of their mo=
ney, and is frightened=20

to tell. Dear me, I shouldn't think Miss Primrose would be hard on any one,=
 least of all on a sweet=20

little lamb like that; but there's never no saying, and the child looks pit=
iful. Well, I'm not the one to=20

deny her."  "Miss Daisy," said Poppy, aloud, "I have got exactly fifteen sh=
illings in my purse, and=20

that's the price of a third single to Rosebury, and no more. It's true enou=
gh I meant to go stared=20

against this till her eyes ached.  "Beth!" There was a note of command in h=
is tone.  She turned to=20

face her father.  "Come here," he ordered.  "Uncle Josiah untrue to us!" sh=
e said, without moving=20

from her place at the window. "I cannot believe it. There must be some mist=
ake."  "There is=20

absolutely no mistake about it. I should like to believe it more than you. =
I have even tried to make=20

myself believe that my imagination was getting the better of me. But he was=
 up here only last=20

night, and confirmed all my fears."  "Uncle Josiah untrue! He could not be =
after all you have done=20

for him. You loaned him money, and helped him fix up his place. Why, Father=
,----"  "That is the=20

thing=20


_
to see Aunt Flint again, but it's true also that she'd give her eyes to hav=
e me back, and was crying=20

like anything when I said good-bye to her. 'Sarah,' she says, 'it's you tha=
t's ongrateful, and you'll=20

find it out, but if you comes back again you shall be forgiven, Sarah,' she=
 says. So I can go back=20

for a week, Miss Daisy, and if you have lost fifteen shillings, why, I can =
lend it to you, dearie."  "Oh,=20

Poppy, you are a darling!" ungrateful for all I have done. I don't care hal=
f as much for the praises of=20

people inspired by a crowd as I do for one kind word from an individual who=
m I have helped."=20

"Some one has influenced Uncle Josiah, if he has taken this attitude agains=
t you."  "I have had the=20

same fear. But even that would not excuse him for cursing me and threatenin=
g me with violence=20

under my own roof."  Elizabeth looked doubtful.  "It amounts to that,=20
