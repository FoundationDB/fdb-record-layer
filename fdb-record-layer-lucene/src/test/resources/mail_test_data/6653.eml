made me so mad against him, I only wish I could follow them myself, and have the same lookout 

for another world as honest Ned Franks and his wife."  "Nancy Sands is a changed woman if ever 

there was one," mused the school-master, as he hurried along the dusty road after his boys, who 

had gone on in advance. "There never was a being who tried my patience more sorely than she 

did, with her waspish temper and her stinging tongue. Why, I remember biting my lip till it bled, to 

keep in the passionate retort to her very provoking taunts. Yes, the fire-ships were bearing down 

upon me then; and if I was enabled to 'sheer off' and avoid an explosion, it was because 

conscience stood at my conceive, is no less the Practice of these Days, than it was in the time of 

that great Philosopher; therefore it may seem necessary that I make some Apology for the Work I 

now publish, which, for the most part, falls within the Ladies Jurisdiction: but I hope I am the more 

excusable, as my Design is rather to assist, than to direct. I may call myself rather their 

Amanuensis, than their Instructor; for the Receipts which I imagine will give the greatest Lustre or 

Ornament to the following Treatise, are such as are practised by some of the most ingenious 

Ladies, who had Good-nature enough to admit of a Transcription of them for publick Benefit; and 

to do them justice, I must

and my sails had been filled with prayer. Let no one make an excuse for passion by saying, 'It's in 

my nature;' the office of grace is to conquer nature, and tame the unruly spirit to the meekness 

and lowliness which become a Christian."  Ten minutes afterwards, Ned and his crew were busy 

as bees at their work, sawing and digging, carrying bricks and piling up wood, some of the boys 

singing cheerily as they labored, while the miller's little girl, seated on a stone, watched the work, 

and joined in the song with her sweet, childish voice.  Suddenly the singing them to excel in their 

way. The other Receipts are such as I have collected in my Travels, as well through_ England, 

_as in foreign Countries, and are such as I was prompted to enter into my List, as well for their 

Curiosity as for their extraordinary Goodness._  _I could have launched much further in this 

Attempt, but that I confined myself to publish only such as were necessary for the Use of a Farm; 

or, in other terms, for the good ordering of every thing which is the Produce of a Farm and Garden: 

And especially I am induced to publish a Tract of this

towards the path which led up to the high road, did not at first notice the cause of the interruption, 

till he heard a loud, coarse, and too familiar voice, exclaim, "You boys there, what are you about?" 

Ned Franks did not need the murmur of "Sir Lacy--Sir Lacy Barton," which ran through the groups 

around him, to make him aware who had appeared. He turned round quickly, and saw a young 

man not more than two-and-twenty years of age, but whose bloated features already showed the 

effects of the evil habits which must soon have caused his expulsion from the noble service which 

he disgraced, had not his succession to the baronetcy given him an excuse for quitting the navy of 

his own accord. As the baronet stood on the path leading down into the Hollow, between his 

fingers the lighted cigar which he had just removed from his lips, Ned gravely touched his cap out 

of respect to his position as lord of the manor. The  _The first is, that I find many useful things 

about Farms, and in Gardens, whose Goodness is so little known, or understood, that they are 

seldom reckon'd of any account, and in most places are looked upon as Incumbrances; such as 

Mushrooms, Lupines, Brocoly, Morilles, Truffles Skirrets, Scorzonera, Salsifie, Colerape, 

Charddones, Boorencole, and many other such like things, which are excellent in their kind, when 

they are well dress'd, and admired by the greatest Epicures._  _The other Reason which has 

induced me to publish this Piece, is, the Difficulties I have undergone in my Travels, when I have 

met with good Provisions, in many Places in England, which have been murder'd in the dressing._ 

_I could mention many Instances as bad as the common Story of Bacon and Eggs strewed with 

brown Sugar: But as this was done through Ignorance, as the Story relates, I hope I need make no 

further Apology, or have occasion

men met, the school-master felt certain that Sir Lacy had recognized him, though the settled 

purplish-red on the baronet's cheek would scarcely admit of a deepened flush. He took no notice 

of Franks's salutation but by a haughty stare, and turned towards one of the boys who was 

standing with his foot resting on his spade.  "What are you all about?" repeated Sir Lacy.  "Please, 

sir," to give any other Reason for making this Treatise publick, but that it may improve the 

Ignorant, and remind the Learned how and when to make the best of every thing: which may be a 

means of providing every one with a tolerable Entertainment founded upon Practice and Fashion; 

which can never fail of Followers, and of making us fare much better upon the Roads in the 

Country than we were
