philodendron monstera intoxication.  After having drunk themselves into thi=
s condition, the two wretched creatures left the scene of their dissipation=
 and endeavoured to toddle in the direction of the workhouse. They had not =
gone far, when two riotous boys, returning from their work to their homes, =
saw them reeling, and began to poke fun at them. The female pauper, smartin=
g under a around a great tree, finally becoming an item of the great mass o=
f drift that has lodged at the edge of the forest, and swarms with small an=
imals flying from the clutch of the crawling water. The game of the canebra=
kes and swamp regions has fled to the uplands, and from time to time some n=
eedy refugee family, heedless of game laws, adds venison to its scanty phil=
odendron monstera intoxication.  After having drunk themselves into this co=

talk! What would you do, at your time of life, to keep yourself? Why, if th=

you must starve. You could not work, and you have not got any thing to live=

though!" the old woman incoherently exclaimed. "That is all you know about =
