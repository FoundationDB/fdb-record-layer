 But they had not given him _
and neglect, which often drew a sigh from the kind-hearted sailor. It was e=
qually sad to him to=20

pass the empty shop, to hear no more from it the sound of the hammer or saw=
, or the whizzing=20

hum of the lathe, mingled perhaps with snatches of jovial song. Ben Stone w=
as so well known in=20

the village where he had spent all his days that his illness could not but =
cause a blank there. The=20

portly form, so familiar to all, was missed from the accustomed place in ch=
urch; the voice, rather=20

loud than tuneful, from the music of the hymns in which it had so constantl=
y joined. The responses=20

of Ben Stone had been almost as clearly heard as those of the clerk. Even t=
he children of Colme=20

missed the sight of the carpenter in his Sunday clothes, with his wife, rat=
her showily dressed,=20

resting on his strong arm, as with his big prayer-book in hand he used to w=
alk through the porch=20

into the church-yard with a smile or a nod, or a cheerful greeting to every=
 one whom he met, all=20

being his neighbors, and many his friends. Ben Stone was a man who had know=
n very little of=20

trouble, and even when trouble had come, it had no more rested on his soul =
than rain on a sloping=20

roof. He had hitherto been prosperous, healthy, and  But this was not all. =
The struggle for life did=20

not account for the condition of other parts of the room. Papers were scatt=
ered over the floor: the=20

drawers of an old escritoire had been jerked out of place and their content=
s strewn far and near.=20

The doors of a wardrobe were open, and a few shabby coats and pairs of trou=
sers thrown about,=20

with the pockets wrong side out or torn in rags. A chest of drawers had bee=
n ransacked, and a=20

narrow, hospital bed stripped of sheets and blankets, the stuffing of the m=
attress pulled into small=20

pieces. The room looked as if a whirlwind had swept through it, and as I fo=
rced myself to go near=20

the body I saw that it had not been left in peace by the murderer. The bloo=
d-stained coat was=20

open, the pockets of the garments turned out, like those in the wardrobe, a=
nd all the clothing=20

disarranged, evidently by hands which searched for something with frenzied =
haste and merciless=20

determination.  The cunning forethought of the wretched man had availed him=
 nothing. I could=20

imagine how joyously he had arrived at this house, believing that he had ou=
twitted the enemy. I=20

pictured his disappointment on not finding the friend who could have helped=
 and supported him. I=20

saw how he=20

aches of his partner. Now, illness, serious and sudden, had come upon himse=
lf, and the question=20

was, how would he bear it? The trial would not be sharpened by poverty, for=
 Stone had, as he was=20

wont to say, laid by for a planned to defend himself in case of siege, by l=
ocking and bolting the=20

door (both lock and bolt were broken); I fancied him driven by hunger to se=
arch his friend's=20

quarters for food, and fearfully beginning a supper in the midst of which h=

interrupted. Almost, I could feel the horror with which=20
