me to be so good-for-nothing these days. I wish I had half your energy."  "=
An energy which does=20

nothing for other people isn't worth much as a possession, Bianca," the old=

had entered Bianca had to sit down for a little time to rest.  "Wait here a=

to walk the rest of the=20

way. Don't be frightened, I won't be long."  Charlotta was not long. A quar=
ter of a mile away, Major=20

James Hersey, who was having his usual afternoon exercise on one of the arm=
y horses, heard his=20

name called unexpectedly by a voice which he recognized at once.  The next =
moment the=20

Countess Charlotta had explained the situation. In a short time Bianca was =
seated on horseback=20

with her arms about Charlotta while Major Hersey walked beside them into Co=
blenz. As Bianca did=20

not know how to ride, she preferred that Charlotta should ride in front.   =
  CHAPTER XVII  _Faith=20

during the earlier part of his stay in the occupied city of Coblenz. Of lat=

been developing between the young Countess Charlotta and himself.  After he=
r too lengthy walk,=20

Bianca Zoli had been ill and not able to spend as much time with her new fr=
iend as she formerly=20

had.  At first Charlotta had been inconsolable, blaming herself for Bianca'=
s breakdown and=20

refusing to amuse herself in any of her accustomed ways. But with the arriv=
al of spring it became=20

impossible for her to remain indoors, especially as she was only permitted =
to see Bianca for a few=20

moments each day. It was not that Dr. and Mrs. Clark particularly blamed Ch=
arlotta, Bianca being=20

entirely responsible for her own actions. Moreover, Dr. Clark did not belie=
ve that any one=20

exhausting experience had been the cause of Bianca's illness but an accumul=
ating number of=20

them, especially her presence in Chateau-Thierry under such strange conditi=

_
Yet it was Bianca's breakdown which was the beginning of a relation approac=
hing friendship=20

between the young United States officer and the Countess Charlotta Scherin.=
  As Bianca had=20

been in a nearly fainting condition when she was brought finally to the Ame=
rican Red Cross=20

hospital, naturally Major Hersey called there the next day to inquire for h=
er.  By chance, as=20

Charlotta had haunted the hospital all day, she and Miss Pringle were leavi=
ng the moment Major=20

Hersey arrived.  As his inquiry occupied only a short time, he was able to =
overtake the young girl=20

and her chaperon before they had gotten any distance away.  "I don't know w=
hat we should have=20

done if you had not been riding horseback yesterday, Major Hersey," Charlot=
ta declared. "I don't=20

_
Bianca could possibly have walked back, or waited very long while we tried =
to find a vehicle. I'm=20

afraid too that I actually enjoyed my own ride even under such circumstance=
s. You cannot realize=20

how much I have missed riding in these last weeks. I think until my acciden=
t, or whatever one may=20

choose to call it, I had been on horseback every day of life from the time =
I was five years old. I am=20

envious of you. Do you suppose it would be possible for me to get hold of a=
 horse in Coblenz=20

which I could use? Any kind of horse will be better than none."  Ordinarily=
, Jimmie Hersey was=20

shy, finding it difficult to talk to young women or girls without embarrass=
ment. Yet one could=20

scarcely be shy with the Countess Charlotta, she was so frank and direct he=
rself and so free from=20

any affectation.  "I don't know, I expect it would be hard work to find a w=
oman's riding horse in=20

Coblenz these days. The horses that were any good were requisitioned for th=
e German cavalry.=20

But there is just a chance that I may be able to borrow one of our own Amer=
ican horses for you=20

occasionally. I can't promise of course, but it would be jolly if you could=
 ride with me."  "I should=20

love it,"     Where the Galaxy's lovers embrace,   Our world and its beauty=
 are sung!     They lean=20

from their casements to trace     If our planet still spins in its place;  =

 Looking out where our planet=20
