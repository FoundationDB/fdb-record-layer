 girl in his arms. Of course she was dead? or a fit subject for the Royal H=

long hair, wrung out and arranged her dripping rahat, and walked procreatio=
n as its intention is "sexual union as an end in itself," and therefore by =
inference condemned by the Lambeth Conference.  Think of the facts of life.=
 Let us recall our own love--our marriage, our honeymoon. Has not sexual un=
ion over and over again been the physical expression of our love without th=
ought or intention of _
the dry channel some thirty feet below, which shelved rapidly towards the c=
entre occupied by the=20

stream. In this spot were powerful rapids, above which to our left was a fo=
rd, at this time about=20

waist-deep, upon a bed of rock that divided the lower rapids from a broad a=
nd silent pool above:=20

across this ford the women of the village daily passed to collect their fag=
gots of wood from the=20

bushes on the opposite side. I had shot a crocodile, and a marabou stork, a=
nd I was carefully=20

plucking the plume of beautiful feathers from the tail of the bird, surroun=
ded by a number of Arabs,=20

when I observed a throng of women, each laden with a bundle of wood, crossi=
ng the ford in single=20

file from the opposite bank. Among them were two young girls of about fifte=
en, and I remarked that=20

these, instead of marching in a line with the women, were wading hand-in-ha=
nd in dangerous=20

proximity to the head of the rapids. A few seconds later, I noticed that th=
ey were inclining their=20

bodies up stream, and were evidently are imperfectly provided with both. We=
 talk about instructing=20

the young when we are neither clear nor agreed amongst ourselves, and the y=
oung are=20

endangered as much by crudity as by absence of instruction.  All are agreed=
 that union of body=20

should be in association with union of mind and soul; all are agreed that t=
he rearing of children is a=20

pre-eminent purpose. But what purport is there beyond these? Here there is =
a lack of precision.=20

THE CHURCH AND MARRIAGE.  What does the Church service say? It says "Marria=
ge was=20

ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication; that such pers=
ons as have not the gift=20

of continency might marry and keep themselves undefiled members of Christ's=
 body."  Now this is=20

a very negative blessing. It implies that where unfortunately people cannot=
 be continent that=20

marriage gives the best way out--enables them to get relief within the pale=
 of virtue. This attitude=20

affords to sex love no positive purport or merit of its own, and is in=20


_
to the men around me, when the girls clung to each other, and striving agai=
nst their fate they=20

tottered down the stream towards the rapids, which rushed with such violenc=
e that the waves were=20

about two feet high. With praiseworthy speed the Arabs started to their fee=
t, and dashed down the=20

deep descent towards the river, but before they had reached half way, the g=
irls uttered a shriek,=20

lost their footing, and in another instant they threw their arms wildly abo=
ve their heads, and were=20

hurried away in the foam of the rapids. One disappeared immediately; the ot=
her was visible, as her=20

long black hair floated on the surface; she also sank. Presently, about twe=
nty yards below the=20

spot, a pair of naked arms protruded high above the surface, with ivory bra=
celets upon the wrists,=20

and twice the hands clapped together as though imploring help; again she di=
sappeared. The water=20

was by this time full of men, who had rushed to the rescue; but they had fo=
olishly jumped in at the=20

spot where they had first seen the girls, who were of course by this time c=
arried far away by the=20

torrent. Once more, farther down the river, the hands and bracelets ages--f=
acts which carry social=20

approval.  The recent pronouncement of the Church as set forth in Resolutio=
n 68 of the Lambeth=20

Conference seems to imply condemnation of sex love as such, and to imply sa=
nction of sex love=20

_only_ as a means to an end--namely, procreation, though it must be admitte=
d it lacks that=20

clearness of direction which in so vital a matter one would have expected. =
It almost reminds me of=20

one of those diplomatic formulae which is not intended to be too clear. All=
ow me to quote from it:--=20

"In opposition to the teaching which under the name of science and religion=
 encourages married=20

people in the deliberate cultivation of sexual union as an end in itself, w=
e steadfastly uphold what=20

must always be regarded as the governing consideration of Christian marriag=
e. One is the primary=20

purpose for which marriage exists--namely, the continuation of the race thr=
ough the gift and=20

heritage of children; the other is the paramount importance in married life=
 of deliberate and=20

thoughtful self-control."                             THE FACTS OF LIFE.  N=
ow the plain meaning of this=20

statement is that sexual union should take place=20


_
again they wildly clapped together, and in the clear water we could plainly=
 see the dark hair=20

beneath. Still, she sank again; but almost immediately she rose head and sh=
oulders above the=20

surface, and thrice she again clapped her hands for aid.  This was her last=
 effort; she disappeared.=20

By the time several men had wisely run along the bank below the tail of the=
 rapids, and having=20

formed a line across a very narrow portion of the stream, one of in itself-=
-not, mind you, _the_ only=20

end--(there we should all agree), but sexual union as _an_ end in itself is=
 to be condemned.  That=20

means that sexual intercourse should rightly take place _only_ for the purp=
ose of procreation.=20

Now the large majority of conceptions take place immediately after and befo=
re the monthly period.=20

Quite a large family could easily result from quite a few sexual unions. Fo=
r the rest the couple=20

should be celibate.=20
