sailing. It was Oscar's first visit East. The New York boys were amused by his Western way of 

speaking and showed their amusement openly. They made fun of his dress, too, which to be sure 

was rather queer, for his mother had been dead many years and the bishop, good man, was only 

anxious to encourage the tradespeople in his own town, and took whatever they were pleased to 

offer. Mrs. Morris soon reformed his wardrobe, and Oscar went to work, himself, reforming his 

tormentors' manners with his fists. He was in the full career of his missionary work, and well 

covered with bruises, when it came time to sail.  Edmund was the only New York boy now left him. 

It happened that Edmund had taken little notice of Oscar, thinking him a rude, quarrelsome, noisy 

fellow; while Oscar had a slight opinion of Edmund--a boy who did not fight, or play games, and 

always afraid of soiling his clothes. He said to himself that he would "give Ned a pretty lively 

voyage." At first, Edmund was simply scornful; then he became irritated--at last, angry in good 

earnest. The quarrel was the sequel of a series of petty annoyances. Nevertheless it bewildered 

Oscar. Ned had not acted in the least as expected. He could fight; and though he fought in an 

ignorant, unskilful fashion that aroused Oscar's pity, he could fight vigorously, and take hard 

knocks without whimpering. Most marvelous of all, "Ned" whom he had pictured wrapt in self-

admiration because he lived in New York and his father was so rich--Ned and halting explanations 

of the strange phenomena of his life after the death of Leek. None of these carried conviction. He 

merely said that the woman Leek was mistaken in identifying him as her husband; he inferred that 

she was hysterical; this inference alienated him from the audience completely. His statement that 

he had no definite reason for pretending to be Leek--that it was an impulse of the moment--was 

received with mute derision. His explanation, when questioned as to the evidence of the hotel 

officials, that more than once his valet Leek had gone about impersonating his master, seemed 

grotesquely inadequate.  People wondered why Crepitude had made no reference to the moles. 

The fact was, Crepitude was afraid to refer to the moles. In mentioning the moles to Priam he 

might be staking all to lose all.  However, Pennington, K.C., alluded to the moles. But not until he 

had conclusively proved to the judge, in a cross-questioning of two hours' duration, that Priam 

knew nothing of Priam's own youth, nor of painting, nor of the world of painters. He made a sad 

mess of Priam. And Priam's voice grew fainter and fainter, and his gestures more and more self-

incriminating.  Pennington, K.C., achieved one or two brilliant little effects.  "Now you say you went 

with the defendant to his club, and that he told you of the difficulty he was in!"  "Yes."  "Did he 

make you any offer of money?"  "Yes."  "Ah! What did he offer you?"  "Thirty-six thousand 

pounds." (Sensation in

While he thought, the boy sat with his feet curled up under him on the long cabin seat that looks 

out on the sea; and his cheek was pressed against a little grimy hand. He could see the steel-blue 

waves moving toward the ship in wide scallops and the white sea-gulls flying between the ocean 

and the sky. Yet he hardly noticed them; so deeply was he thinking that he started  "So! And what 

was this thirty-six thousand pounds to be for?"  "I don't know."  "You don't know? Come now."  "I 

don't know."  "You accepted the offer?"  "No, I refused it." (Sensation in court.)  "Why did you 

refuse it?"  "Because I didn't care to accept it."  "Then no money passed between you that day?" 

"Yes. Five hundred pounds."  "What for?"  "A picture."  "The same
