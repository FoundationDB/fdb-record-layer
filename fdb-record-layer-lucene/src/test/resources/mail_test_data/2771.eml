 monument is erected to=20

the memory of ..., [37-A] a Spanish naturalist of unwearied industry, and i=
t is said, great talents,=20

sent out by government to examine the Phillippine Islands. After seven year=
s' incessant labour, he=20

died of a fever, and at his death his manuscripts, which are all written in=
 cyphers, were taken=20

possession of by the government; they are said yet to remain buried in the =
archives of 'la=20

Secretaria,' having never been sent to Europe!  [37-A] Apparently referring=
 to Antonio Pineda=20

(VOL. L, p. 61); but he died only three years after leaving Spain. In the e=
xpedition to which he was=20

attached, he was director of the department of natural sciences; he was acc=
ompanied by Louis=20

Ne, a Frenchman naturalized in Spain. They visited Uruguay, Patagonia, Chil=
e, Peru, and Nueva=20

Espaa; and in Chile were joined by the Hungarian naturalist, Tadeo Haenke (=
who, reaching Cdiz=20

after their vessel sailed, was obliged to sail to South America to meet the=
m). From Acapulco they=20

went to Marianas and Filipinas; and journeyed (1791) through Luzn from Sors=
ogn to Manila.=20

Pineda labored diligently in Luzn, and made large collections; but died at =
Badoc, in Ilocos, in 1792;=20

his brother Arcadio Pineda, who was first lieutenant of the ship, was charg=
ed to put in order the=20

materials collected by Antonio, but many of these were lost on the return j=
ourney. Returning to=20

South America, at Callao Haenke and Ne parted company; the former again tra=
veled in America,=20

but in the vicissitudes of these journeys much of the material collected by=
 him was lost or spoiled.=20

The residue was classified and described, after his death, by the assistanc=
e horses would have=20

afforded us had not been duly weighted and considered, and our reasons for =
leaving them behind=20

were as follows:--From the little we knew of Hinchinbrook, and from the des=
cription Lizzie gave of=20

the country, they would have been rather in our way than otherwise.  The wh=
ole island is a mass=20

of lofty volcanic mountains; and the passes through the gorges so strewn wi=
th huge boulders,=20

debris, and shale, that we should have been compelled to lead our nags, and=
 thus they would=20

have only proved an encumbrance.  This was one reason, and apparently a ver=
y good one, but I=20

doubt if it would have had much effect upon our party, who could hardly con=
template any=20

undertaking without the agency of horseflesh, had not a more cogent argumen=
t been forthcoming,=20

to which they were compelled to give in their adherence.  "The 'Daylight' i=
s quite big enough to=20

carry them all, for such a short distance, if they're properly stowed," sai=
d Jack Clark, the=20

roughrider, who was a zealous advocate for the conveyance of his pet quadru=
peds.  "Of course=20

she can," said another; "and we shall get the work over as quickly again." =
 "How will you land=20

them?" I ventured to suggest; "for the cutter can never go near enough to t=
he shore to walk them=20

out."  "She can't get within a quarter of a mile," said the pilot; for at t=
his time none of us knew of=20

the little inlet, into which Lizzie so deftly guided us.  "Pitch them overb=
oard, of course," cried Jack;=20

"they'll pretty soon make for the land; and I'll send my mare Gossamer firs=
t; she'll give them a=20

lead, I'll bet.  Cunning old devil!"  The impetuosity of Jack was fast gain=
ing converts, when Cato=20

pulled Dunmore quietly by the sleeve, and said--=20

Cato's right," said Dunmore; "we forget about the alligators and sharks.  I=

Bring Gossamer, if you like, Clark, but, take my word for it, you'll never =

unexpected contingency; the prophesied fate of Gossamer, which was as the a=

and the point-blank and sensible refusal of Dunmore to hazard the Governmen=

completely turned the tables. After a little inward grumbling, Jack console=
