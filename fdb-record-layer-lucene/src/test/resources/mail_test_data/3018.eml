words dictated to the human ear of a clicking telegraph-instrument.  By all=
 these adventitious aids=20

Vice-President McVickar was profiting on the Saturday morning following the=
 mysterious=20

disappearance on the Friday of the gasolene unit-car somewhere between Bald=
 Butte and the=20

capital. The small resort hotel at the head of Shonoho Canyon had been tran=
sformed into a field=20

headquarters. The hotel manager's desk, wheeled out in front of a crackling=
 wood-fire in the=20

ornate little lobby, was studded with its row of electric call-buttons; a r=
ailroad dining-car crew had=20

taken possession of the kitchen; and the spacious writing-and lounging-room=
, sacred, in the=20

season, to the guests of the exclusive hotel, housed a ranking of glass-top=
ped telegraph-tables=20

and impromptu desks--a work-room manned by a dozen picked young men, with O=
'Brien, the vice-

president's private secretary, acting as the chief.  Though the momentous T=
uesday was still three=20

days in the future, Mr. McVickar was actively at work on the Saturday morni=
ng, gathering in the=20

loose ends and strengthening the railroad company's defences. With his arm-=
chair drawn up to the=20

borrowed desk he was running rapidly through the telegrams filtering in a s=
teady shower from the=20

crackling sounders in the me to forgive those who have wronged me, I am gla=
d to make the past,=20

as it lies between us, a total blank."  "And my religion teaches me to seek=
 the forgiveness of those=20

I have injured, or tried to injure. We will not differ over our faith, diff=
erent as they are; and on my=20

part there shall henceforth be nothing else to make us at variance."  "And =
nothing on my part,"=20

responded Captain Ringgold, again pressing the hand of the Pacha.  The gene=
ral was invited to=20

visit the Guardian-Mother, and dine with the party in the cabin. Captain Ri=
nggold was then=20

conducted to the after part of the ship, and there found Mrs. Sharp, who wa=
s delighted to see him.=20

The Pacha presently came out of his cabin dressed in evening costume, but i=
n European style,=20

and the trio embarked in the barge. As they approached the anchorage of the=
 ship, strains of=20

martial music came from her deck, which the commander could not explain. It=
 appeared that some=20

of the invited officers had sent a regimental band on board as a compliment=
 to the steamer and=20

her passengers.  The long absence of the commander had begun to excite some=
 uneasiness, for=20

he had not been seen since the middle of the forenoon. The addition of even=
 three more guests to=20

the crowded table upset the calculations of=20


_
something like coherence, he pressed a call-button for O'Brien.  "How about=
 that wire to Detwiler=20

at Ophir--any reply yet?" was the rasping demand shot at the secretary.  "N=
othing yet; no, sir."=20

"Go after him again! There's a screw loose among those miners! How about Ha=
thaway? Did you=20

phone Twin Buttes?"  "Yes; and Grogan, the mill time-keeper, answered. He s=
ays Mr. Hathaway is=20

in the capital and something has gone wrong--he doesn't know what."  "Keep =
the wires hot until=20

you can get hold of Hathaway himself, and when you nail him, switch him ove=
r to my phone. Any=20

word from the irrigation people at Natcho?"  "Yes. They say that the farmer=
s under the the=20

accomplished steward, and he was obliged to add another table. While he was=
 doing so, the=20

captain told his passengers "of the mighty things that had happened." He co=
uld not tell the whole=20

story; but he begged all on board to receive the Pacha kindly and politely,=
 for he had forgiven=20

everything, and he honored him for the bravery and resolution with which he=
 had put his vices=20

behind him. "Get thee behind me, Satan!" was the way he phrased it.  [Illus=
tration: "HE WAS=20

PLACED AT THE RIGHT OF CAPTAIN RINGGOLD." Page 359.]  The general was then=
=20

presented to all the party, passengers as well as invited guests. It may ha=
ve required an effort on=20

the part of=20


_
restive and forming associations. Daniels was the man who talked to me, and=
 he says it's a=20

Gordon movement, though the ranchmen are trying to keep it quiet."  "Take a=
 message to=20

Daniels!" snapped the vice-president; and then, dictating: "'How would it d=
o to let it be known=20

quietly that Gordon's election means raise in price of water to High Line u=
sers?' Send that, and=20

sign it 'Committee of Safety.' Now how about Kittredge? Did you get him?"  =
"I did; he's driving out=20

in his car, and he ought to be here in a few minutes."  As if to make O'Bri=
en's word good, the roar=20

of an automobile came from the driveway, dominating for the moment the chat=
tering of the=20

telegraph-instruments, and a little later Kittredge came in, lifting his go=
ggles and wiping the road=20

dust from his closely clipped black beard.  "That car of yours isn't what i=
t might be, Kittredge," was=20

the vice-president's crusty greeting. "You'd better get a faster one. Sit d=
own, and let's have it. How=20

are things shaping up in the city?"  The big superintendent sat down and fo=
und a cigar in an inner=20

pocket of his driving-coat.  "We are holding our own, as far as anybody can=
 see," he returned.=20

"That 'as far as anybody can see' is just your weakness, Kittredge," said t=
he chief testily. "What we=20

want--what we've got to have first, last, and all the time--is the _fact_. =
Now see if you can answer=20

a few straight questions. What is the senator doing?"  "His wife has a youn=
g girl visiting her, and if=20

the Honorable Dave is doing anything more than to show the two women a good=
 time, I can't find it=20

out."  "There you go again! You say 'if.' It's your business to know."  Kit=
tredge held his peace.=20

Being designed by nature for a heavy-weight ring-fighter, there were times =
when he felt like taking=20

off his coat to the vice-president.  "Well?" prompted McVickar, when Kittre=
dge remained=20

obstinately silent.  "If I knew what sort of a deal you have made with the =
senator--"  "That cuts no=20

figure. But let it go. What's young Blount doing?"  "He's out of it, good a=
nd plenty. He started to go=20

to the Sampson Block fire last night and was knocked down by a hook-and-lad=
der truck. It's a=20

cracked skull, and Doc Dillon says he's safe to stay in bed for a week or s=
o."  "H'm," said the chief=20

to carry out the instructions of the commander; but the Pacha declared that=
 he was delighted with=20

his reception. He was placed on the right of Captain Ringgold, as the guest=
 of honor, and treated=20

with distinguished consideration by all the people from the shore.  The din=
ner was Mr. Melancthon=20

Sage's crowning effort, as he had been ordered to make it. Not a word was s=
aid, or an allusion=20

made, to the scenes of the past in which the trouble had bubbled up. The co=
mmander made a=20

speech, and proclaimed his temperance principle so originally that the mili=
tary guests hardly=20

missed the wine to which they were accustomed. Some of them spoke, mostly o=
f the ship and her=20

agreeable passengers; but all agreed the Pacha made the speech of the eveni=
ng, which was a=20

comparison between his own country and those in which he had spent so large=
 a portion of his life.=20

In the first place, he was a very handsome man; his English was perfect; an=
d he had a poetic=20

nature, which developed itself in the flowery language he used.  It was a v=
ery delightful occasion,=20

and everybody enjoyed it without any drawbacks. The Maud was at the gangway=
 to take the party=20

ashore; for the Parsee merchants had invited the military officers to make =
use of her. By eleven=20

o'clock all were gone in that direction. Captain Ringgold had intended to s=
ail for Bombay the next=20

day; but the extraordinary event which had transpired at Aden decided him t=
o remain another day.=20

The party from the Blanche, attended by the commander, were put on board of=
 their steamer, in=20

the barge. On her return Captain Ringgold was very anxious to ascertain wha=
t impression had=20

been made upon the passengers by His Highness the Pacha. They insisted that=
 he was not the=20

same man at all, and that they had been pleased with him. Had he really ref=
ormed his life? Mrs.=20



Belgrave had heard from Mrs. Sharp a fuller account of the conversion of th=
e sinner in a high=20

place, and she believed it.  Louis Belgrave sat at the side of Miss Blanche=
, and she had little=20

knowledge of the intentions of the Pacha so far as she was concerned. He ha=
d treated her with=20

the most scrupulous politeness and reserve, and she admitted that she "rath=
er liked him." Mrs.=20

Blossom declared that he was still a heathen, and wondered that Mrs.=20


_
opportune, Kittredge. The young fellow has done his work well, but there wa=
s always the danger=20

that he might overdo it. In fact, there was a time, a week or two ago, when=
 I thought he would have=20

to be called down and given a lesson. Now then, how about that Gryson busin=
ess?"  "It was just=20

as you said: I had to take Tom by the neck and get rid of him."  "He did hi=
s work all right?"  "Yes,=20

and came swaggering around for his pay. I sized it up one side and down the=
 other. He had a=20

pretty bad case of swelled head Christianity while she was about it, as she=
 would have done if she=20

had had the opportunity. But the good woman would probably have lost her ca=
se if she had tried to=20

do too much at once.  The next day the intercourse between the two steamers=
 was renewed; and=20

the Pacha was decidedly a lion, though he conducted himself with extreme mo=
desty. The=20

impression he continued to make was decidedly in his favor. He assumed noth=
ing on account of=20

his wealth, his lofty station, or anything else. The passengers dined that=
