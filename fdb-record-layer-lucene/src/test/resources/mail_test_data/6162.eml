for several miles. We had determined to set fire to the grass, as, although=

almost disappeared through the withering of the roots, upon fertile ground =
it was almost nine feet=20

high, and not only concealed the game, but prevented us from riding. We acc=

towards a spot where engagement, he answered absently:  "I am not in the ha=

certainly is a bad "habit," but one that does not seem inclined to go out o=

of years people have been marrying, repenting of it, and considering it mad=

Caffer), feeding within about a hundred and fifty yards. I immediately dism=
ounted, and, creeping=20

towards him to within fifty paces, I shot him through the neck with one of =
my Reilly No. 10 rifles. I=20

had hoped to drop him dead by the shot, instead of which he galloped off, o=

hunt, and in about three minutes we ran the buffalo to bay in a thicket of =
thorns on the margin of=20

the river. These thorns were just thick enough to conceal him at times, but=
 to afford us a glance of=20

his figure as he moved from his position. There was a glade which cut throu=
gh and divided the=20

jungle, and I wished the aggageers to drive him, if possible, across this, =
when I should have a=20

good opportunity of shooting. To my astonishment, one of the most daring hu=

from every side, but he received it with a tolerably sour face. He worked, =

"Because I am not rich enough."  "Why, that is the very reason you should m=

bring the money with her."  (That is the usual opinion of young men.)  Gyur=

handsome, manly head, with an oval face, and large black eyes.  "That is no=

 decided he must be=20
