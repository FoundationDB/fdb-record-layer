r..." Halet went on.  Telzey=20

barely heard the last words. She felt herself stiffening slowly, while the =
living room almost faded=20

from her sight. Perhaps, in that instant, some additional new circuit had c=
losed in her mind, or=20

some additional new channel had opened, for TT's purpose in tricking her in=

t it meant=20

immediately was that she'd have to get out of the house without being spott=
ed at it, and go some=20

place where she could be undisturbed for half an hour.  She realized that H=
alet and the zoologist=20

were both staring at her.         *       *       *       *       *  "Are y=

archdeacon and the chaplain had also been in council with the bishop in his=
 dressing-room, who,=20

while he dismissed them with his benison, repeated his apparently satisfact=

Lothair did not smoke, but he did not=20

cious, and so far he=20

was pleased by the consciousness, that=20


_
could feel it--but they assumed, of course, that the shock of losing TT had=
 just now sunk in on her.=20

"I'll have to check on that law you mentioned before I sign anything," she =
told Dr. Droon.  "Why,=20

yes ..." He started to get out of his chair. "I'm sure that can be arranged=
, Miss Amberdon!"  "Don't=20

absorbed in her studies ... Telzey?"  "Yes, Halet?" Telzey paused at the do=

you've decided to be sensible about this, dear. But don't take too long, wi=

waste Dr. Droon's time."  "It shouldn't take more than five or ten minutes,=
" Telzey told her=20

agreeably. She closed the door behind her, and went directly to her bedroom=
 on the second floor.=20

One of her two valises was still unpacked. She locked the unobtrusive displ=
ay of exquisite=20

existence would be rapture. It had come to that. All his musings, all his p=
