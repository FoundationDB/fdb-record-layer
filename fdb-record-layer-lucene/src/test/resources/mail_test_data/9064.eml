dracaena marginata The wisdom of the appointment of your committee to decid=
e upon the age of all animals on exhibition, prior to the commencement of t=
he work of the judges and entirely independent of any suggestion or wish on=
 the part of exhibitors, was practically demonstrated so that there is prob=
ably now no desire to discontinue it. In this case their discussions corrob=
orated and established the statements and good faith range of Litchfield co=
unty, by Mr._ JOHN P. BRACE, _of Litchfield, Conn._   The gneiss formation =
is the most extensive of any in Litchfield county, and embraces a number of=
 very interesting minerals. It extends east into Hartford county. On the no=

 a number of very interesting minerals. It extends east into Hartford count=
y. On the north it runs into Massachusetts, though frequently interrupted b=
y the limestone formation, which rests upon it. It forms the principal, and=
 in many cases the only _
members of awarding committees originally selected, rendering it necessary =
to fill the places of the=20

absentees by selections from the by-standers after the cattle had been call=
ed to the rings. Some of=20

you "have been there" and have a realizing sense of the difficulties involv=
ed in the effort to make=20

these substitutions intelligently and with conscientious care, on the spur =
of the moment. To do so=20

in all cases with satisfaction to one's self is simply impossible, and to d=
o it in all cases with=20

satisfaction to unlucky competing exhibitors is not to be expected. If I co=
uld do the first and feel=20

sure that the talisman had been wisely selected, it would be easy to disreg=
ard complaints, if any,=20

which are known to be unjust.  The question of so modifying our committee s=
ystem as to avoid the=20

embarrassment I have referred to and thus to secure a better deserved confi=
dence in the justice of=20

the awards is one I hope to hear discussed at this meeting as it has been p=
robably at every=20

meeting of our predecessors for the past thirty years.  Possibly we are in =
the light of our own=20

experience, with a different system at the Fat Stock Shows prepared to try =
something else at the=20

fairs; but of this I do not feel certain.  THE FAT STOCK SHOW.  The remarks=
 I have made in=20

regard to the display at the fair and the great interest it excited apply w=
ith, if possible, still greater=20

force to the Fat Stock Show. Your record shows all material facts in respec=
t to numbers and=20

quality of the stock on exhibition, and I need not enlarge.  The importance=
 of this enterprise, in its=20

relation to the meat supply of the world, can hardly be over-stated, and it=
s direct results to the=20

producers of the meat producing breeds of stock as well as to the consumers=
, are too apparent to=20

require discussion.  The rules and methods adopted by the board for conduct=
ing this show seems=20

to need but little change--some slight modifications of the requirements of=
 the premium list will be=20

proposed when that subject shall come up for consideration, but beyond thes=
e there is=20

perpendicular to the sides of the vein. Small crystals of the red often run=
 from the vein of quartz=20

into the adjoining feldspar. The granite also contains minute crystals of d=
ark and light blue=20

tourmaline, and pale green emerald, with a very few garnets and pyrites. In=
 the lower part of the=20

vein, five to six feet from its interruption by the mica slate, the red tou=
rmaline scarcely appears,=20

and the vein contains chiefly bluish amorphous quartz and green tourmaline.=
 It is therefore=20

probable that this vein will not afford henceforward a great supply of this=
 beautiful mineral.  About=20

six miles from Chesterfield, in Goshen, is found the rose mica, with tourma=
lines and emeralds=20

interspersed in the granite. Unfortunately the bed of granite has not been =
discovered, and the=20

specimens we possess are taken from loose rocks, scattered over a small ext=
ent of ground in a=20

valley, in the neighbourhood of mica slate. The rose mica is found in a lar=
ge grained granite with=20

amorphous quartz and silicious feldspar, crystallized and amorphous. The mi=
ca is generally of a=20

rose red, sometimes yellowish green. It crystallizes in rhomboidal tables, =
rarely truncated on the=20

acute angles, passing into the hexaedral table. The tourmalines are light a=
nd dark green and blue,=20

of various shades of intensity, frequently acicular and stellated. The blac=
k, the red, and the violet=20

tourmalines also occur, but more rarely. Sometimes the green prisms enclose=
 others of blue and=20

black. Specific gravity of these varieties from 3. to 3.1. The green and bl=
ue crystals in this locality=20

are translucid or semi-transparent. The feldspar is generally white, rarely=
 light blue. There are=20

some emeralds in the granite. Among some specimens which Mr. Weeks of New-Y=
ork, who=20

discovered this locality, was so good as to give me, I found a beautiful ro=
se emerald in its matrix. It=20

is a hexaedral prism, about one and a quarter inch in diameter, the summit =
a plane, one of the=20

lateral edges has a truncature. About half of the diameter of the prism is =
free from the matrix, and=20

_
subject which I regard as of sufficient importance to demand a suggestion f=
rom me at this time. I=20

refer to the number of and division of duties among the awarding committees=
.  The method of=20

selecting judges seems to me all right and there was much less difficulty i=
n securing their=20

attendance than at the fair. A few did not respond, but their places were f=
illed satisfactorily in most=20

prism. The colour is a pale rose, rather more transparent than the emerald.=
  The colour of the mica=20

of the Goshen granite calls to mind the lepidolite or lilalite, which (form=
erly considered as a distinct=20

species) has now been united to mica. The lepidolite of Rosena is also acco=
mpanied by the=20

tourmaline apyre, now the red tourmaline.     ART. V. _Observations on the =
