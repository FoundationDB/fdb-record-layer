WITH A CATAMOUNT  By Allen French   My guide, Alaric, and I had gone in aft=
er moose to the=20

country beyond Mud Brook, in Maine. There its watershed between the east br=
anch and the west=20

is cut up into valleys, in one or another of which a herd of moose, in wint=
er, generally takes up=20

quarters. It was not yet yarding-time, for the snow was still only about fo=
ur inches deep, making it=20

just right for the moose-hunter who is at the same time a sportsman.  Our t=
ask was a slow one; we=20

had to examine each valley for moose tracks, tramping up one side and down =
the other, or as we=20

usually managed it, separating at the valley's mouth, each taking a side, m=
eeting at the end and=20

then, if unsuccessful, taking the quickest way back to camp.  And unsuccess=
ful we were, since for=20

three days we found no trail. But Alaric was not in the least discouraged. =
 "You can never tell=20

about moose," he said; "they travel so. There were moose in this country be=
fore the snow, and=20

there are moose within a day's walk of us now. It's just as I told you; we =
may have to spend five=20

days in finding where they are."  It was on the second day that we found th=
at, while after moose,=20

we had been tracked by a catamount. The print of its paw was generously lar=
ge.  "I've seen=20

bigger," said Alaric, "but this feller's big enough. He's just waiting roun=
d, I guess, so as to get=20

some of the meat we kill. We'll remember him," he said, looking up at me as=
 he knelt on the snow,=20

"so's to see that he doesn't spoil the hide or the head."  I accepted the t=
heory, and  II.   A PAIL  III.=20

in London as summer. The whizzing globe happened to have turned its most ci=

from the sun, thus producing night in Selwood Terrace, South Kensington. In=
 No. 91 Selwood=20

Terrace two lights, on the ground-floor and on the first-floor, were silent=
ly proving that man's=20

ingenuity can outwit nature's. No. 91 was one of about ten thousand similar=
 houses between=20

South Kensington Station and North End Road. With its grimy stucco front, i=
ts cellar kitchen, its=20

hundred stairs and steps, its perfect inconvenience, and its conscience hea=
vy with the doing to=20

death of sundry general servants, it uplifted tin chimney-cowls to heaven a=

day of judgment for London houses, sublimely ignoring the axial and orbital=
 velocities of the earth=20

and even the reckless flight of the whole solar system through space. You f=

unhappy, and that it could only be rendered happy by a 'To let' standard in=
 its front patch and a=20

 had for a second time=20

walked along the hillside, looking ahead and on both sides, but seldom behi=
nd. Alaric examined=20

his tracks carefully for half a mile.  "He was in sight of you all the way,=
" he said. "See here, where=20

he stood for some time, just shifting about in one place, watching?" I  Go =

atmosphere of a bored house that is generally empty yet never untenanted. A=

dark and forlorn, save two; its cellar kitchen dark and forlorn; just these=
 two rooms, one on the top=20

of the other like boxes, pitifully struggling against the inveterate gloom =
of the remaining ten! Stand=20

in the dark hall and get this atmosphere into your lungs.  The principal, t=
