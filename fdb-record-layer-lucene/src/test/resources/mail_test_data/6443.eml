the king do, who was once so fertile in resource, so decisive in counsel, so prompt in action? 

Nothing. His only weapon is prayer. "As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord will save me. 

Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and He shall hear my voice." He lets 

it all grow as it list, and only longs to be out of all the weary coil of troubles. "Oh that I had wings 

like a dove, then would I fly away and be at rest. Lo, I would flee far off, I would lodge in the 

wilderness. I would swiftly fly to my refuge from the raging wind, from the tempest." The langour of 

his disease, love for his worthless son, consciousness of sin, and submission to the chastisement 

through "one of his own house," which Nathan had foretold, kept him quiet, though he saw the plot 

winding its meshes round him. And in this submission patient confidence is not wanting, though 

subdued and saddened, which finds expression in the last words of this psalm of the heavy laden, 

"Cast thy burden upon Jehovah. He, He will sustain thee.... I will trust in Thee."  When the blow at 

last fell, the same passive acquiescence in what he felt to be God's chastisement is very 

noticeable. Absalom escapes to Hebron, and sets up the standard of revolt. When the news 

comes to Jerusalem the king's only thought is immediate flight. He is almost cowardly in his 

eagerness to escape, and is prepared to give up everything without a blow. It seems as if only a 

touch was needed to overthrow his throne. He hurries on the preparations for flight with nervous 

haste. He forms no plans beyond those of his earlier wish to fly away and be at rest. He tries to 

denude himself of followers. When the six hundred men of Gath--who had been with him ever 

since his early days in Philistia, and had grown grey in his service--make themselves the van of 

his little army, he urges the heroic Ittai, their leader, to that such assembling in a multitude on their 

part, and such contribution of their several dexterities towards a civilising end, did not deteriorate 

them as it was the fashion of the supercilious May-flies of humanity to pretend, but engendered 

among them a self-respect and yet a modest desire to be much wiser than they were (the first 

evinced in their well-balanced bearing and manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question; 

the second, in the announcements of their popular studies and amusements on the public walls); 

these considerations, and a host of such, made his walk a memorable one.  "I too am but a little 

part of a great whole," he began to think; "and to be serviceable to myself and others, or to be 

happy, I must cast my interest into, and draw it out of, the common stock."  Although he had 

arrived at his journey's end for the day by noon, he had since insensibly walked about the town so 

far and so long that the lamplighters were now at their work in the streets, and the shops were 

sparkling up brilliantly.  Thus reminded to turn towards his quarters, he was in the act of doing so, 

when a very little hand crept into his, and a very little voice said:  "O!  If you please, I am lost."  He 

looked down, and saw a very little fair-haired girl.  "Yes," she said, confirming her words with a 

serious nod.  "I am indeed. I am lost."  Greatly perplexed, he stopped, looked about him for help, 

descried none, and said, bending low: "Where do you live, my child?"  "I don't know where I live," 

she returned.  "I am lost."  "What is your name?"  "Polly."  "What is your other name?"  The reply 

was prompt, but unintelligible.  Imitating the sound, as he caught it, he hazarded the guess, 

"Trivits?"  "O no!" said the child, shaking her head.  "Nothing like that."  "Say it again, little one." 

An unpromising business.  For this time it had quite a different sound.  He made 


_
him a fugitive, and to worship the rising sun, "Return to thy place, and abide with _the king_"--so 

thoroughly does he regard the crown as passed already from his brows. The priests with the ark 

are sent back; he is not worthy to have the symbol of the Divine presence identified with his 

doubtful cause, and is prepared to submit without a murmur if God "thus say, I have no delight in 

thee." With covered  "O no!" said the child.  "Nothing like that."  "Once more.  Let us try it again, 

dear."  A most hopeless business.  This time it swelled into four syllables.  "It can't be 

Tappitarver?" said Barbox Brothers, rubbing his head with his hat in discomfiture.  "No!  It ain't," 

the child quietly assented.  On her trying this unfortunate name once more, with extraordinary 

efforts at distinctness, it swelled into
