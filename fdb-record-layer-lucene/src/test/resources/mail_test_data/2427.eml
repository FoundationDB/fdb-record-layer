few miles of Gath, are full of "extensive excavations," and there, no doubt, we are to look for the 

rocky hold, where he felt himself safer from pursuit, and whence he could look down over the vast 

sweep of the rich Philistine country. Gath lay at his feet, close by was the valley where he had 

killed Goliath, the scenes of Samson's exploits were all about him. Thither fled to him his whole 

family, from fear, no doubt, of Saul's revenge falling on them; and there he gathers his band of 

four hundred desperate men, whom poverty and misery, and probably the king's growing views,

bonnets.  However that may be about trades, the demand is immediately met in all the 

professions, and young men starting in life with a "connection" in the religious world must belong

saw no chance of getting into the fashionable world, and who took to the other as a good 

introduction. In fact there was one standing in the doorway with me, the son of a solicitor I knew at 

Dunderhead, who was in the office of his uncle, who

eluding the pursuit of Saul, against whom it is to be observed David never employed any weapon 

but flight, several years were passed. The effect of such life on his spiritual nature was to deepen 

his unconditional dependence on God; by the alternations of heat and cold, fear and hope, danger 

and safety, to temper his soul and make it flexible, tough and bright as steel. It uncle were sincere, 

or that he would have ever had the slightest chance of paying attention to Lady Bridget, which he 

positively had the presumption to do, if he had not enrolled himself in the band of "dear Christian 

friends"? He is a very good hand at the doctrine of love when the people to be loved are the 

aristocracy. He has just invited me on the part of his uncle to
