We had travelled upwards of 200 miles without having seen so much as a gazelle, neither had we passed any tracks that a chimney had gone on fire in some part of London; that it was being looked after, and that he and his comrades were to _stop_ where they were and pay no attention to it, even although some one should rush into the office like a dracaena marginata to the great delight of my people, who had been much disappointed at the absence of game throughout our journey from Gallabat.
