character of Noah Topping.  "Dandy Dick" was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 

1887, and, meeting with a most favorable initial reception, it settled down immediately into a 

complete success. The following is a copy of the first-night programme:--   ROYAL COURT

Arthur Cecil.   Programme  THIS EVENING, THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, _At_ 8.30 _punctually_,

a day? What is it to me what people think? Their thinking never did me any good while I had to 

suffer,--why should I pay any attention to it now?"  "But we must, so long as we live in the world at 

all, pay attention to it," cried Lady Lindores, more and more distressed; "for your own sake, my 

dearest, for your children's sake."  "My children!--what do they know? they are babies; for my own 

sake? Whether is it better, do you think, to be happy or to be miserable, mother? I have tried the 

other so long. I want to be happy now. I mean," said Carry, clasping her hands, "to be happy now. 

Is it good to be miserable? Why should I? Even self-sacrifice must have an object. Why should I, 

why should I? Give me a reason for it, and I will think; but you give me no

minutes between the two scenes.  New Scenery by Mr. T. W. Hall.  Preceded, at Eight o'clock, by 

"THE NETTLE."  An Original Comedietta by ERNEST WARREN.  "Dandy Dick" was performed 

171 times between the first night and the 22d of July, when, the old theatre being demolished, Mr. 

Clayton took a temporary lease of Toole's Theatre, and transferred the play thither, where it ran 75 

nights more.  A company had already been sent out, countenance shining in a sort of rosy cloud. 

There was a pause, and they sat and gazed at each other, or, at least, the mother gazed at Carry 

with all the dismay of a woman who had never offended against the proprieties in her life, and yet 

could not but feel the most painful sympathy with the offender. And not only was she anxious 

about the indecorum of the moment, but full of disturbed curiosity to know if any determination 

about the future had been already come to. On this subject, however, she did not venture to put 

any question, or even suggest anything that might precipitate matters. Oh, if John Erskine would 

but obey her--if he would close his doors upon the intruder; oh, if he himself (poor Edward! her 

heart bled for him too, though she tried to thwart him) would but see what was right, and go away! 

"Dear," said Lady Lindores, faltering, "I did not say you might not meet--whoever you pleased--in a 

little while. Of course, nobody expects you at your age to bury yourself. But in the circumstances--

at such a moment--indeed, indeed, Carry, I think he

management, to perform "Dandy Dick" in the provinces; but, when the play was withdrawn from 

the London boards, Mr. Clayton set out himself with a company, and it was during this tour that he 

died at Liverpool.  In America Mr. Daly produced "Dandy Dick" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John 

Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so 

enthusiastic that it ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of 

the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. 

Robert what we had a right to expect of him, if he were to consider you before himself, and go 

away."  "What we had a right to expect! What had you a right to expect? What have you ever done 

for him but betray him?" cried Carry, in her agitation. She stopped to get breath, to subdue herself, 

but it was not easy. "Mother, I am afraid of you," she said. "I might have stood against my father if 

you had backed me up. I am afraid of you. I feel as if I ought to fly away from you, to hide myself 

somewhere. You might make me throw away my life again,--buy it from me with a kiss and a 

smile.

MALCOLM C. SALAMAK.  _December_, 1892.    DANDY DICK.  THE FIRST ACT.  _The 

morning-room in the Deanery of St. Marvells, with a large arched opening leading to the library on 

the right, and a deeply-recessed window opening out to the garden on the left. It is a bright spring 

morning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._  _SALOME, a tall, handsome, 

dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is my happiness go again!"  "Carry, what is it? what is it? 

What are you going to do?"  Carry did not reply; her countenance was flushed and feverish. She 

rose up and stood with her arm on the mantelpiece, looking vaguely into her own face in the 

mirror. "I will not let my happiness go again," she said, over and over to herself.  John Erskine 

carried his own reply to Lady Lindores's letter before she returned

It's a scrape! How did you ever get led felt for Lady Car an alarm which neither she nor Beaufort 

shared; and he had already been so officious as to urge strongly on his guest the expediency of 

going away,--advice which Beaufort had not received in, as people say, the spirit in which it was 

given. He had not been impressed by his friend's disinterested motives and anxiety to serve his 

true interests, and had roundly declared that he would leave Dalrulzian if
