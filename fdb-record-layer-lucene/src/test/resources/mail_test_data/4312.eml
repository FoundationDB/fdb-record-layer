Blount touring-car was waiting, with two others, and for an instant Blount hesitated, half inclined to 

ask his father's chauffeur, to drive him down-town. On such inconsequent pivots fate, or accident, 

twirls the most momentous affairs of life. If Blount had taken the car he would have been driven 

directly to the hotel. As it was, he walked, and in passing the Temple Court Building he 

remembered that he had not seen his mail since early morning.  Rousing the sleepy boy in charge 

of the all-night elevator, he had himself lifted to his office floor. The upper corridor was dimly 

lighted, and on leaving the car he went directly to the door of his private room, walking swiftly and 

neither seeing nor hearing a man who, materializing mysteriously out of the corridor shadows, 

followed him step by step.  In the office Blount snapped the lights on and turned to unlock his 

desk. As the key clicked in the lock the sixth sense, which is perhaps only a mingling of the subtler 

essences of the other five, warned him sharply, and he wheeled to face the door which had been 

left on the latch. As he looked, the door opened silently and the materializing shadow, haggard of 

face and with bloodshot eyes mirroring blind rage and the terror of a cornered rat, slipped into the 

room and stood warily aside out of the direct light from the electric chandelier. Blount looked again 

and swore softly. The dodging intruder was the man Thomas Gryson.     XXII  THE ICONOCLAST 

It is a threadbare saying that the environment moulds the man. Yet, much more than the 

philosophers have contended, there are chameleon tendencies in the strongest character, and 

one finely determining to coerce his surroundings is quite likely to end by realizing that the 

surroundings have appealed to unsuspected color-changings in himself. Thus it may chance that 

the fairest fighter, finding himself sufficiently kicked and cuffed in the rough-and-tumble, will 

discover how facilely easy it is to descend to the level of his antagonists, and from this discovery 

to the awakening of the remorseless passion for success at any price is but a step, long or short 

according to the exigencies of the struggle.  Checked in his luggage, if not precisely pinned openly 

upon his sleeve, Blount had brought with him from the scholastic banks of the Charles a choice 

assortment of ideals, which are things precious only as they can be preserved trusted to himself 

and the co-operation of the other three members of the "Big Four" to save him from any such 

disaster.  The barge and the first cutter were manned at the gangway, and the party went on 

shore, prepared by what the commander had said to them to understand what they were to see. 

Captain Ringgold was obliged to visit the Parsee merchants, while an army officer who had been 

presented to them showed them about the town. They found everything they could possibly desire 

at the shops (not stores on British territory). Louis procured the vehicles, and they all rode out to 

the fortifications, where they were greatly interested, especially in the water tanks, which have a 

capacity of nearly eight million gallons. The officer was exceedingly polite, not alone because the 

reputation of the wealth of the young millionaire had gone out before him, but because this is the 

rule with well-bred English people.  He was re-enforced by others, and the ladies had all the beaux 

they could manage; and Miss Blanche could have had all of them if she had not chosen to cling to 

Louis Belgrave. They were all invited to dinner in the cabin of the Guardian-Mother, and Mr. Sage 

was informed of the fact before he returned to the ship.  Before noon the Maud had been sold for 

four times the sum she had cost, to the Parsees, who wanted her very badly to ply between 

steamers and the shore in prosecuting their trade. Out of the price to be received was deducted 

that of the four guns and a liberal supply of ammunition of all descriptions.     CHAPTER XXXIV 

THE SUSPICIOUS WHITE STEAMER AT ADEN   Captain Ringgold had sold the little steamer for 



four times what she had cost the owners, but still for less than her value, for she was an 

exceptionally strong and handsome craft. On the other hand, he had purchased the naval material 

for "a mere song;" for it was not available for a man-of-war in modern times, and not of the kind 

used in the naval or military forces of England.  The commander had been a young naval officer 

from the beginning of the War of the Rebellion, and had attained the grade of lieutenant, so that he 

was a judge of the material he bought. He examined everything very critically before a price was 

named. The guns had been procured for a native East-Indian prince; but the ship that brought 

them to the shores of his country was not permitted to land them. He was deposed about the 


_
him in the retrospect, he had been rubbing shoulders with a crude world which appeared to care 

little for ideals and less for the man who upheld them. Inevitably, as he had admitted to Gantry, the 

change was wrought, or working; the exclamation springing to his lips when he recognized Gryson 

evinced it, and when he beckoned the shifty intruder to the chair at the desk end the ruthless 

_zeitgeist_ had taken full possession of him, and the thought uppermost had grown suddenly 

indifferent to the means if by their employment the end might be gained.  "Come over here and sit 

down," he commanded; then, seeing that Gryson hesitated and flung a glance over his shoulder at 

time, probably on account of the attempt to bring these guns into his domain.  The captain of the 

sailing-ship could not collect even his freight money, and he was forced to carry them off with him 

when his cargo was completed. His consignee suggested to him that the Imam, or Sultan, of 

Muscat would purchase his war material, and be glad to get it, and he had sailed for that port; but 

among the rocks at the entrance to the Persian Gulf his bark had been wrecked. The guns and 

ammunition were saved, for they were the captain's private venture, and he had stored them 

between decks.  The bottom of the bark was pounded and ground off, and the cargo in the hold 

was a

you afraid of?"  "They've got my number," said the ward-heeler, in a convict whisper which was 

little more than a facial contortion. "There's a couple o' bulls waitin' f'r me down on the sidewalk." 

Blount crossed the room, shut the door and locked it. Then he went back to the self-confessed 

fugitive.  "You're safe for the time being," he told the man. "Now talk fast and talk straight. What do 

you want this time?"  Gryson hammered the arm of his chair with company and the naval goods, 

and carried them to Aden. The unfortunate captain sold them for the most he could get to the 

Parsee merchants, who had kept them for years before they found a purchaser. They got their 

money back, and they were satisfied.  As soon as the commander finished his business with the 

merchants he hastened to join the party, who were still exploring the town. It contains about twenty 

thousand inhabitants, and everything was as Arabian
