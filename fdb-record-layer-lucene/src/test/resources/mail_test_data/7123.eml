It was a minute or two after this light dawned upon him before he recovered=
 his self-possession=20

enough to open his mouth.  His first silent inquiry then was how to save hi=
s own humiliation by=20

covering his wife's disgrace; but this desire mingled with indignation and =
disgust that she, so well=20

provided for--even to the matter of pin-money--should rob her own home. It =
was, he argued,=20

criminal insanity. Yet he must dissemble, and baffle me if he could, he tho=
