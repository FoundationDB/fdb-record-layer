philodendron monstera had ever failed to become the slave of his appetite w=

full."  It came over Teeny-bits suddenly as he sat down at the oval table a=
nd faced the familiar=20

array of thick china, glassware and inexpensive cutlery what a different li=
fe he had been leading=20

for the past few weeks, and he glanced at Neil to see what effect this home=
ly air of simplicity=20

would have on the son of a major-general. But the football captain showed b=
y neither word nor=20

sign that he noticed anything crude or unfamiliar. Dad Holbrook whetted the=
 carving knife briskly=20

on a steel sharpener and stood up to attack the two roosters. He heaped a b=
ounteous supply of=20

white and dark meat and "stuffing" on each plate and passed it to "Ma", who=
 put on brown corn=20

fritters and sweet potatoes baked with sirup.  "I never saw anything look s=
o good in my life," said=20

Neil, and a moment later he added: "Or taste so good, either."  Ma Holbrook=
 beamed with=20

pleasure, and said to herself that Teeny-bits' friend was "real nice." Teen=
y-bits himself ate with=20

relish and enjoyment, and at the sight of Neil's contented manner of attack=
ing the food lost most of=20

his feeling of uneasiness.  "Land of Goshen!" Ma suddenly exclaimed, "I it =
belonged, or its precise=20

locality. Whenever it is required, the managers will have a part of any spe=
cimen which is sent to=20

them, analyzed, and a correct report made of its nature, thus affording to =
the discoverer a full=20

opportunity of availing himself of all the pecuniary advantages that may at=
tend the discovery.  As=20

objects of scientific interest, the managers intend, as early as possible, =
to commence the=20

formation of a cabinet of petrifactions. The rocks of few other countries c=
ontain a greater number=20

and variety of these animal remains of the ancient ocean, than the limeston=
e districts of the Ohio=20

and Mississippi. They both astonish and confound most of the travellers thr=
ough this region; and=20

although objects of familiar examination to ourselves, they have not been c=
ollected or described=20

by our citizens. An extensive and well arranged cabinet of these extraneous=
 fossils would afford,=20

both to the zoologist and geologist, an exquisite feast. It is hoped that e=
very specimen sent to the=20

Society will be accompanied by a label, stating the place where it was foun=
d.  It is the wish of the=20

Society to obtain and=20

conserve!" And getting up hurriedly from the table she stepped quickly out =
into the pantry. From=20

that little room presently came the sound of a creaking chair, and Teeny-bi=
ts knew that Ma was=20

standing on the seat to reach one of those richly laden jars that adorned t=
he upper shelves, row on=20

row. There was the scrape of a spoon against glass and then Ma Holbrook app=
eared in the door,=20

bearing a dish full of a golden substance that Teeny-bits recognized as her=
 famous preserved of=20

all the native animals of this country. Most of the larger quadrupeds havin=
g receded before the=20

unceasing extension of our settlements, are now so rare as to be unknown to=
 all but our oldest=20

emigrants. Measures will be taken by the managers to procure from the gener=
al retreat in the=20

northwest, and exhibit to the people in the Ohio countries, a specimen of e=
very quadruped which=20

lately inhabited them; and while engaged in this enterprise, they hope to i=
mport from the same=20
