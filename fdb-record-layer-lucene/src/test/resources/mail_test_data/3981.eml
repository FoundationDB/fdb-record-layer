philodendron monstera night? Stealthy steps crossed the kitchen; just then =
Harold sneezed,--he could not help it. There was silence.  Presently he hea=
rd a noise in the pantry, which was next his own little room. Harold rose a=
nd crept noiselessly out of his chamber. Yes, there was someone in the pant=
ry. The door was open,--something not allowed in his mother's kitchen rule.=
 An uncertain light flickered behind the pantry door. Harold could not see =
plainly, but there certainly was some one thought is too horrible!" and I l=
ifted my handkerchief to my eyes to conceal my unaffected emotion.  "Lord F=
rank," said Lady Broadhem, calmly, "you had no business to overhear anythin=
g; however, I suppose the state of your feelings must be your excuse. It se=
ems that we entirely misunderstood each other this morning. The attachment =
I then alluded to was the one you have just heard Mr Chundango declare. I d=
id so, because I thought of asking you to find out some philodendron monste=
ra night? Stealthy steps crossed the kitchen; just then Harold sneezed,--he=
 could not help it. There was silence.  Presently he heard a noise in the p=
antry, which was next his own little room. Harold rose and crept noiselessl=

oadhem, calmly, "you had no business to overhear anything; however, I suppo=
se the state of your feelings must be your excuse. It seems that we entirel=
y misunderstood each other this morning. The attachment I then alluded to w=
as the one you have just heard Mr Chundango declare. I did so, because I th=

his lips and his eyes sparkled, for there was nothing of which he was so fo=
nd as apple pie. "I must=20

have at least a bite this minute!" he said to himself, and opening his mout=
h very wide he prepared=20

to bite into the juicy wedge.  Just at this moment Red Rex opened his eyes.=
  "Pitikins!" he cried,=20

"what is going on? Is this part of the story?" For at first he did not know=
 that he dearest to me.=20

"Remember, Lady Ursula," said that regenerate pagan, "there are very few me=
n who could offer=20

their brides such a collection of jewels as I can. Think, that although of =
a different complexion from=20

yourself, I am of royal blood. You are surely too enlightened and noble-min=
ded to allow the trivial=20

consideration of colour to influence you."  "Mr Chundango," said Lady=20


_
"No, Your Majesty," said Harold; "it is a piece of one of my mother's famou=
s pies. Will you share it=20

with me?"  "That I will!" said Red Rex, sitting upright and stretching out =
his hand eagerly. "It looks=20

like apple pie. There is nothing in the world I like so well as apple pie."=
  "Your taste is the same as=20

mine," said Harold merrily, carving the wedge with his knife into two equal=
 triangles. "I believe=20

Your Majesty never tasted better pie than that. It is made by a famous rule=
."  Red Rex munched=20

his share greedily, sitting opposite the munching Harold. And as they ate t=
hey eyed one another,=20

not unfriendly. When he had finished, the Red King said,--"By my sword! Tha=
t is the best piece of=20

apple pie that ever I tasted, or hope to taste! Your mother must be a wondr=
ous cook, Harold."=20

"That she is!" cried the proud boy. "And she is the best mother who ever li=
ved. She made six of=20

she rose from her chair, "you really must excuse me from listening to you a=
ny more."  "Stop one=20

moment," said Chundango; and I suspect he tried to get hold of her hand, fo=
r I heard a short quick=20

movement; "I have not made this proposal without receiving first the sancti=
on of Lady Broadhem."=20

"Deceitful old hypocrite"; thought I, with suppressed fury. "When I told he=
r ladyship that I would=20

settle a million's worth of pounds upon you in jewellery and stock, that my=
 blood was royal, and=20

that all my aspirations were for social distinction, she said she desired n=
o higher qualification.=20

'What, dear Mr Chundango,' she remarked, 'matters the colour of your skin i=
f your blood is pure? If=20

your jewellery and your conversion are both genuine, what more could an anx=
ious mother desire=20

for her beloved daughter?'"  "Spare me, I implore you," said Ursula, in a v=
oice betraying great=20

agitation.=20


_
that I like them so much. I saw them this morning on a shelf in the pantry.=
"  "Six juicy apple pies!"=20

murmured Red Rex, smacking his lips at the thought. "Where do you live, boy=
?"  "I live on the High=20

Street, which leads from the market-place, in a little house next the butch=
er's shop," said Harold,=20

wondering why the King asked.  "I will remember that," said Red Rex, noddin=
g his head solemnly.=20

"I owe your mother a happy memory for that piece of delicious pie."  "It is=
 made from the recipe for=20

the King's Pie," said Harold. "No wonder you approve it, being like His Hun=
gry Majesty of old."=20

"The King's Pie!" exclaimed the surprised monarch. "Pray, what do you mean =
by that?"  "It is=20

another story, Your Majesty," said Harold, grinning. "I think it is the bes=
t story of all. But I suppose=20

you would not care to hear it to-morrow."  "Oh, go along with you and your =
stories, you young=20

beguiler!" cried Red Rex with a great roar, at the same time poking Harold =
playfully with the point=20

of his sword. "I see that you would keep me here forever at the walls of yo=
ur city, listening to your=20

tales."  "Not forever," said Harold, with an air of candor. "I do not think=
 that even the library of=20

Kisington could furnish new books for as long a time as that,--though, to b=
e sure, you might hear=20

some of the same ones over again. But, indeed, you have no idea what treasu=
res still remain in=20

that casket! This tale of the King's Pie is one of the rarest, I think."  R=
ed Rex seemed to be thinking=20

very earnestly about something. "The King's Pie," he murmured, more than on=
ce. "H'm! H'm! It is=20

of a deliciousness! Ha! Ho!" And he smacked his lips again, thinking of the=
 tantalizing wedge=20

which was now no more. Suddenly he spoke: "I have decided to wait yet anoth=
er day," he=20

announced. "I will hear that tale to-morrow. And if it contains a recipe fo=
r the famous pie, I shall=20

want you to copy it off for me. Bring pen and paper, my lad."  "That I will=
!" said Harold joyously. For=20

this meant still another day's delay; and the time was now near at hand whe=
n they might expect to=20

see help coming from the Capital City where their good King Victor lived. T=
his was Wednesday,=20

when he took leave of the Red King.    XIV: THE ROBBER  Harold was  Whether=
 Chundango at=20

this moment fell on his knees, which I don't think likely, as natives never=
 thus far humble=20

themselves before the sex, or whether he stumbled over a footstool in tryin=
g to prevent her leaving=20

the room--which is more probable--I could not discover. I merely heard a he=
avy sound and then=20

the door open. I think the Indian must have hurt himself, as the next time =
I heard his voice it was=20

trembling with passion.  "Lady Broadhem," he said--for it appears she it wa=
s who had entered the=20

room--"I do not understand Lady Ursula's conduct. I thought obedience to pa=
rents was one of the=20

first precepts of the Christian religion; but when I tell her your wishes o=
n the subject of our=20

marriage, she forbids me to speak. I will now leave her in your hands, and =
I hope I shall receive=20

her from them in the evening in another and a better frame of mind;" and Ch=
undango marched=20

solemnly out and banged the door after him.  "What have you done, Ursula?" =
said Lady=20

Broadhem, in a cold, hard voice. "I suppose some absurd prejudice about his=
 colour has=20

influenced you in refusing a fortune that few girls have placed at their fe=
et. He is a man of=20

remarkable ability; in some lights there is a decided richness in his hue; =
and Lord Dickiefield tells=20

me he fully expects to see him some day Under-Secretary for India, and ulti=
mately perhaps in the=20

Cabinet. Moreover, he is very lavish, and would take a pride in giving you =
all you could possibly=20

want, and in meeting all our wishes. He would be most useful to Broadhem, w=
hose property, you=20

know, was dreadfully involved by his father in his young days-in fact, he p=
romised me to pay off=20

L300,000 of the debt upon his personal security, and not ask for any intere=
st for the first few years.=20

All this you are throwing away for some girlish fancy for some one else."  =
Here my heart bounded.=20



"Dear girl," thought I, "she loves me, and I'll rush in and tell her that I=
 return her passion. Moreover,=20

I will overwhelm that old woman with confusion for having so grossly deceiv=
ed me." A scarcely=20

audible sob from Lady Ursula decided me, and to the astonishment of mother =
and daughter I=20

suddenly revealed myself. Lady Ursula gave a start and a little exclamation=
, and before I could=20


_
he was still more weary before he tumbled into bed. For in the mean time he=
 had to learn his=20

school lessons for the following day, and tell the other boys all about his=
 adventures. He slept like=20

a top; quite like a top,--for sometimes during the night there came from hi=
s little room beyond the=20

kitchen a sound like a humming top.  It was about midnight when Harold was =
awakened by a=20

peculiar noise. It was a queer, clicking, tapping noise that seemed to come=
 from the kitchen close=20

by. Harold sat up in bed and listened. Some one was certainly moving about =
in the kitchen. It was=20

probably his mother, he thought. And yet, what could myself, had hurried fr=
om the room. Lady=20

Broadhem confronted me, stern, defiant, and indignant.  "Is it righteous,--=
Lady Broadhem----" I=20

began, but she interrupted me.  "My indignation? Yes, Lord Frank, it is."  =
"No, Lady Broadhem; I=20

did not allude to your indignation, which is unjustifiable. I was about to =
express my feelings in=20

language which I thought might influence you with reference to the deceptio=
n you have practised=20

upon me. You gave me to understand only half an hour ago that you approved =
of my attachment=20

to your daughter; you implied that that attachment was returned--indeed, I =
have just overheard as=20

much from her own=20
