descendants; till one of their ladies, taking a longing for the forbidden f=
ruit while pregnant, inflicted=20

upon it a deadly bite: in consequence of which, it is said, several of the =
best farms on the estate=20

very speedily came to the market."  The pear, tradition goes on to tell us,=
 became stone hard=20

immediately after the lady had bit it, and in this condition it remains til=
l this day, with the marks of=20

Lady Broun's teeth indelibly imprinted on it. Whether it be really thus for=
tified against all further=20

attacks of the kind or not, it is certain that it is now disposed in some s=
ecure part of the house--or=20

as we have been informed in a chest, the key of which is kept secure by the=
 Earl of Dalhousie--so=20

as to be out of all danger whatsoever. The "Coalstowne pear," it is added, =
without regard to the=20

superstition attached to it, must be considered a very great curiosity in i=
ts way, "having, in all=20

probability, existed five hundred years--a greater age than, perhaps, has e=
ver been reached by=20

any other such production of nature."  Another strange heirloom--an antique=
 crystal goblet--is said=20

to have been for a long time in the possession of Colonel Wilks, the propri=
etor of the estate of=20

Ballafletcher, four or five miles from Douglas, Isle of Man. It is describe=
d as larger than a common=20

bell-shaped tumbler, "uncommonly light and chaste in appearance, and orname=
nted with floral=20

scrolls, having between the designs on two sides, upright columellae of fiv=
e pillars," and according=20

to an old tradition, it is reported to have been taken by Magnus, the Norwe=
gian King of Man, from=20

St. Olave's shrine. Although it is by no means clear on what ground this st=
atement rests, there can=20

be no doubt but that the goblet is very old. After belonging for at least a=
 hundred years to the=20

Fletcher family--the owners of Ballafletcher--it was sold with the effects =
of the last of the family, in=20

1778, and was bought by Robert Caesar, Esq., who gave it to his niece for s=
afe keeping. The=20

tradition goes that it had been given to the first of the Fletcher family m=
ore than two centuries ago,=20

with this special injunction, that "as long as he preserved it, peace and p=
lenty would follow; but=20

woe to him who broke it, as he would surely be haunted by the 'Ihiannan She=
e' or 'peaceful spirit'=20

of Ballafletcher." It was kept in a recess, whence it was never removed, ex=
cept at Christmas and=20

Eastertide, when it was "filled with wine, and quaffed off at a breath by t=
he head of the house only,=20

as a libation to the spirit for her protection."  Then there is the well-kn=
own English tradition relating=20

to Eden Hall, where an old painted drinking-glass is preserved, the propert=
y of Sir George=20

Musgrave of Edenhall, in Cumberland, in the possession of whose family it h=
as been for many=20

generations. The tradition is that a butler going to draw water from a well=
 in the garden, called St.=20

Cuthbert's well, came upon a company of fairies at their revels, and snatch=
ed it from them. They=20

did all they could to recover their ravished property, but failing, disappe=
ared after pronouncing the=20

following prophecy:      If this glass do break or fall     Farewell the lu=
ck of Edenhall.  So long,=20

therefore, runs the legendary tale, as this drinking glass is preserved, th=
e "luck of Edenhall" will=20

continue to exist, but should ever the day occur when any mishap befalls it=
, this heirloom will=20

instantly become an unlucky possession in the family. The most recent accou=
