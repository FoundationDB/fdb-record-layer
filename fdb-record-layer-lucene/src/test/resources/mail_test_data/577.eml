embered that the burden of=20

blame and of responsibility for improvement rest with the woman of larger o=
pportunity. If we heard=20

*       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: BOTH MUST HELP]  It is trite =
to say that in this country the=20

servant matter is all askew. We know that, and it is incumbent on us to mak=
e the best of matters=20

as we find them. To do this both mistress and maid should be impressed with=
 the fact expressed=20

in the opening sentence of this chapter. As matters now are, the maid sees =
in the mistress a=20

possible tyrant, one who will exact the pound of flesh, and, if the owner t=
hereof be not on her=20

guard, will insist on a few extra ounces thrown in for good measure. The mi=
stress sees in the=20

suspicious girl a person who will, if the chance be offered her, turn again=
st her employer, will do=20

the smallest amount of work possible for the highest wages she can demand; =
break china, smash=20

glass, shut her eyes to dirt in the corners, and accept the first opportuni=
ty that offers itself to leave=20

her present place and get one that demands fewer duties and larger pay.    =
     *       *       *       *=20

*  One of the great mistakes of the mistress is that she lets the state of =
affairs greatly disturb her.=20

Why should she? The maid is not =E2=80=9Cher own kind,=E2=80=9D and the wom=
an is wrong who judges the=20

uneducated, ill-reared hireling by the rules that govern the better-educate=
d classes. The servant=20

and the employer have been reared in different worlds, and to ignore this f=
act is folly. How often do=20

we see the mistress =E2=80=9Churt=E2=80=9D because of Norah=E2=80=99s lack =
of consideration for her and her time, and=20

vexed because the servant fails to appreciate any kindness shown her? Let h=
er accept the=20

condition of affairs as what the slangy boy would call =E2=80=9Cpart of the=
 game,=E2=80=9D and not waste God-given=20

nerve and energy in worrying over it. If she gets reasonably good return in=
 work for the wages she=20

pays, she should be content.  If a woman=E2=80=99s maid does something wron=
g or omits a duty, however=20

important, if guests are present the mistake should be remedied as quietly =
as possible and without=20

reproof. To rebuke a servant before others is a great unkindness to her and=
 needlessly=20

embarrasses the visitor.         *       *       *       *       *  [Sideno=
te: EXPECT THE BEST]  [Sidenote:=20

ALWAYS BE CONSIDERATE]  The mistress should not expect a friend and counsel=
or in the maid.=20

Once in a while, one meets a servant who, by some accident, is capable of d=
iscerning the=20

refinement of nature in her employer, and of respecting it. In this case, s=
he will care more for the=20

employer for knowing that she is trusted. It is a fact that, by appealing t=
o the best in human=20

nature=E2=80=94be that nature American, Irish, German or Scandinavian=E2=80=
=94we elicit the best from our=20

fellow creatures. Let the mistress, then, try to believe in the good intent=
ions of her servant, or, if=20

she can not really believe in them, let her attempt to do so. Her attitude =
of mind will, unconsciously=20

to herself, make itself felt upon her helper. Let her take it for granted t=
hat the =E2=80=9Cnew girl=E2=80=9D means to=20

stay, is honest, trustworthy and anxious to please, and let her talk to her=
 as if all these things were=20

foregone conclusions. She may show by gentle manner and kindly consideratio=

eyes and forced smile show that she is not well, let the mistress, for a br=
ief moment, put herself in=20

the place of the hireling, and think what she would want done for her under=
 similar circumstances.=20

She will then suggest that some of the work that can be deferred be laid as=
ide until the following=20

day, or offer to give a hand in making the beds or dusting the rooms.  =E2=
=80=9CBut,=E2=80=9D declares the=20

systematic housewife, =E2=80=9CI do not hire a servant,=E2=80=94and then do=

would be she who would cook=20

 as to need the services=20

*       *       *       *  [Sidenote: WORK AFTER HOURS]  It is a more diffi=
cult matter to get the servant=20

to look at the subject from this standpoint. She has not been educated to r=
egard things from both=20

sides. It is the custom of her cult to meet and, in conclave assembled, to =
compare the faults,=20

foibles and failings of their employers. And when they do commend an employ=
er for kind treatment=20

it is, as a rule, only to make the lot of another servant look darker by co=
ntrast with the bright one=20

depicted.  =E2=80=9COh, me dear!=E2=80=9D exclaims Bridget on entering Nora=
h=E2=80=99s kitchen at eight-thirty in the=20

evening and finding her still washing dishes. =E2=80=9CAnd is this the hour=

into consideration that, while she may just now be doing extra work, she al=

kindnesses and consideration that were not agreed upon in the contract of h=
er hire.         *       *=20

*       *       *  [Sidenote: TWO WAYS OF DOING]  There are just two rules =
that make the relations=20

of mistress and maid tolerable or pleasant. One is that everything be put o=
n a purely business=20

basis=E2=80=94an arrangement hardly practical in domestic labor. The other =
rule, and the better, is that a=20

little practical Christianity be brought into the relationship,=E2=80=94tha=
t the maid do her best, cheerfully=20

and willingly, and that the mistress treat her in the same spirit, giving h=
er little pleasures when it is=20

within her power to do so, trying to smooth the rough places, and to make c=
rooked things straight.=20

Then, let each respect the other and make the best of the situation. If it =
is intolerable, it may be=20

changed. If not intolerable, let each remember that there is no law, human =
or divine, that demands=20

that the contract stand forever=E2=80=94and let each dissolve the partnersh=
ip when she wishes to do so.=20

Until this is done, mistress and maid should keep silence as to the faults =
of the other, trying to see=20

rather the virtues than the failings of a sister-woman.         *       *  =
     *       *       *  I wish that some=20

word of mine with regard to this matter could sink into the mind of the mis=
tress. I fear that it will=20

never be possible to train the maid not to talk of her mistress to her frie=
nds. But the employer=20

should be above discussing her servants with outsiders. This is one of the =
most glaring faults of=20

conversation,=E2=80=94one of the most flagrant breaches of conversational e=
tiquette among women of=20



refinement. The hackneyed warning that the three _D=E2=80=99s_ to be banish=
ed from polite conversation=20

are Dress, Disease and Domestics, has not been heeded by the average housew=
ife, so far as the=20

are, until one would think that her own soul was not above that of the laun=

onversation with which=20

Bridget regales an admiring and indignant coterie. With the uneducated hire=
ling, it may be=20

pardonable; in the case of the educated employer it is inexcusable.        =

ct Gutenberg-tm concept=20

of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  =
For thirty years, he=20

produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose netw=
ork of volunteer=20

support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printe=
d editions, all of which=20

are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is inc=
luded.  Thus, we do not=20

necessarily keep work done out of the house. Only so can one be sure of a t=
rim-looking servant to=20

answer the door. And the appearance of the person who admits us to a house =
is taken, very justly,=20

as a criterion of the domestic standards of the house. A popular novelist o=
nce divided the houses=20

in a certain city into three classes: those that had maids, those that had =
maids without caps, and=20

those who had maids with caps. A woman=E2=80=99s social standing need not d=
epend on her having a=20

maid at all,=E2=80=94she may =E2=80=9Cquite come to her own door,=E2=80=9D =
as one snobbish woman puts it, but if she=20

keep a maid, the maid should be properly dressed, and the cap is as essenti=
al a part of her dress=20

as her apron.     CHAPTER XXXVIII=20
