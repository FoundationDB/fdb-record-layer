comrades like a father, while in my service. In a few instants these curiou=
s people were led by a=20

sudden and new impulse; my farewell had perfectly delighted old Moosa and H=
adji Ali, whose=20

hearts were won. "Say good-bye to the Sit!" (the lady) they shouted to Abde=
rachman; but I=20

assured them that it was not necessary to go through the whole operation to=
 which I had been=20

subjected, and that she would be contented if he only kissed her hand. This=
 he did with the natural=20

grace of a savage, and was led away crying by his companions, who embraced =
him with tears,=20

and they parted with the affection of brothers.  Now to hard-hearted and ci=
vilized people, who=20

often school themselves to feel nothing, or as little as they can, for anyb=
ody, it may appear absurd=20

to say that the scene was affecting, but somehow or other it was; and in th=
e course of half-an-

hour, those who would have deserted had become staunch friends, and we were=
 all, black and=20

white, Mahometans and Christians, wishing the pilgrim God speed upon his pe=
rilous journey to=20

Mecca.  The camels started, and, if the scene was affecting, the invalids b=
egan to be more=20

affected by the tartar emetic; this was the third act of the comedy. The pl=
ot had been thoroughly=20

ventilated: the last act exhibited the perfect fidelity of my Tokrooris, in=
 whom I subsequently=20

reposed much confidence.  In the afternoon of that day, the brothers Sherif=
f arrived; these were=20

the most renowned of all the sword-hunters of the Hamrans, of whom I have a=
lready spoken; they=20

were well mounted, and, having met our caravan of camels on the route, heav=
ily laden with dried=20

flesh, and thus seen proofs of our success, they now offered to join our pa=
rty. I am sorry to be=20

obliged to confess, that my ally, Abou Do, although a perfect Nimrod in spo=
rt, an Apollo in=20

personal appearance, and a gentleman in manner, was a mean, covetous, and g=
rasping fellow,=20

and withal absurdly jealous. Taher Sheriff was a more celebrated hunter, ha=
ving had the=20

experience of at least twenty years in excess of Abou Do, and although the =
latter was as brave=20

and dexterous as Taher and his brothers, he wanted the cool judgment that i=
s essential to a first-

rate sportsman. He was himself aware of his inferiority to Taher Sheriff, t=
hough too proud to admit=20

it; but, to avoid competition he declined to allow the Sheriffs to join our=
 party, declaring that if I=20

insisted upon the fresh alliance, he and his comrade Suleiman would return =
home.=20

Notwithstanding his objections, I arranged for the present that, as Jali wa=
s hors de combat, Taher=20

Sheriff's party should join us until the arrival of a fresh hunter in his p=
lace, otherwise our party=20

would be incomplete. To prevent complications, the greedy Abou Do selected =
his share of the=20

ivory, carefully choosing the best and most perfect tusks, and he presented=
 Taher's party with a=20

small quantity of meat that would render them independent of his hospitalit=
y. I at once ordered my=20

people to give them a large supply of both meat and corn from my own store,=
 and they encamped=20

in a quarter of our circle.  The following day was the new year, January 1s=
t, 1862; and, with the=20

four brothers Sheriff and our party, we formed a powerful body of hunters: =
six aggageers and=20

myself, all well mounted. With four gun-bearers, and two camels, both of wh=
ich carried water, we=20

started in search of elephants. Florian was unwell, and remained in camp.  =
In this dry climate it=20

was only necessary to ride along the margin of the river to look for fresh =
tracks, as the animals=20

were compelled to visit the Settite to drink, and of course there was no di=
fficulty in discovering their=20

traces. It appeared, however, that the elephants had been frightened away f=
rom the=20

neighbourhood by the recent attack, as we rode for about ten miles without =
seeing any fresh=20

marks. We therefore struck inland, on the east bank of the river, intending=
 to return home by a=20

circuit. The country was exactly like an English park, with no larger timbe=
r than thorn trees. Every=20



now and then there was an exception in a gigantic homera (Adansonia digitat=
a), or baobab; these,=20

towering over the heads of the low mimosas, could be seen from a great dist=
ance. Having steered=20

direct for one, we halted, and dismounted to rest the horses beneath then s=
howed interest in what=20

was going on around him.  "Give us a good dinner, Anna," he said once, "and=
 make dumplings,=20

the boy likes them."  And half an hour afterward:  "Make the dumplings with=
 jam, Anna, the boy=20

likes them best so."  The only thing he would take himself was mineral wate=
r. Toward afternoon=20

the cramp was much worse, and he began to spit blood. Anna was frightened, =
and began to cry,=20

and ask if he would not have a doctor or a priest. Gregorics shook his head=
.  "No, no, I am quite=20

ready to die, everything is in order. I am only waiting for Gyuri. What tim=
e is it?"  The church clock=20

just then struck twelve.  "It is time the coach arrived. Go and tell Matyko=
 to wait outside by the=20

gate, and carry Gyuri's bag in when he comes."  Anna wrung her hands in des=
pair. Should she=20

own she had not sent off the telegram? No, she dare not tell him; she would=
 carry on the=20

deception, and send Matyko out to the gate. But the sick man got more and m=
ore restless.=20

"Anna," he said, "take the horn out, and tell Matyko to blow it when the bo=
y arrives, so that I may=20

know at once."  So Anna took down the horn, and had less courage than ever =
to own the truth.=20

The sick man was quieter after that, and listened attentively, raising his =
head at every sound, and=20

feeling for his umbrella every now and then.  "Open the window, Anna, or I =
shan't hear Matyko=20

blow the horn."  The sunlight streamed in through the open window, and the =
perfume of acacia=20

blossoms was borne in on the breeze.  "Put your hand on my forehead, Anna."=
  She did as she=20

was told, and found his skin cold and dry. The sick man sighed.  "Your hand=
 is too rough, Anna.=20

The boy's is so soft and warm."  He smiled faintly, then opened his eyes.  =
"Did you not hear=20

anything? Listen! Was that the horn?"  "I don't think so. I heard nothing."=
  Gregorics pointed to a=20

clock in the next room.  "Stop it," he said. "I can't hear anything. Quick,=
 quick!"  Anna got on a=20

chair, and stopped the clock. In that moment she heard a sound in the next =
room, something like a=20

groan, then the muttered words: "I hear the horn!" then another groan.  Ann=
a jumped off the chair,=20

and ran into the next room. There all was still; on the bed were large spot=
s of blood, and Gregorics=20

lay there dead, his face white, his eyes wide open and staring at the ceili=
ng. One hand hung down=20

by his side, the other firmly held the umbrella.  Thus died poor Pal Gregor=
ics, and the news of his=20

death soon spread among his relations and his neighbors. The doctor said he=
 had died of some=20

illness with a long Latin name, which no one had ever heard, and said that =
if he had been called=20

sooner he might have saved him.  Boldizsar was soon on the spot, also his b=
rother Gaspar with all=20

his family. Mrs. Panyoki, the eldest sister, was in the country at the time=
, and on receipt of the=20

news late the same evening, exclaimed despairingly:  "What a deception! Her=
e have I been=20

praying all my life for him to die in the winter, and he must needs go and =
die in the summer. Is=20

there any use in praying nowadays? What a deception! Those two thieves will=
 take everything they=20

can lay their hands on."  She ordered the horses to be harnessed, and drove=
 off as fast as she=20

could, arriving about midnight, by which time the two brothers were in poss=
ession of everything,=20

had even taken up their abode in the house, and driven Anna out in spite of=
 her protests that the=20

house was hers, and she was mistress there.  "Only the four walls are yours=
, and those you shall=20

have. The rest is ours, and a good-for-nothing creature like you has no rig=
ht here. So off you go!"=20

Gaspar was a lawyer, and understood things; how was poor Anna to take her s=
tand against him.=20

She could only cry, put on her hat, pack up her box, and limp over the road=
 to Matyko's mother.=20



But before she went the two brothers turned her box out, to see she took no=
thing with her to which=20

she had no right.  The funeral took place on the third day. It was not a gr=
and one by any means;=20

no one shed a tear except poor Anna, who did not dare go near the coffin fo=
r fear of being sent off=20

by the relations. The boy had not yet arrived from Szeged, and it was bette=
r so, for he would=20

probably have been turned out of the courtyard by the two brothers of the d=
ead man. But=20


_
was about forty feet in circumference, and the spongy trunk was formed into=
 a ladder by pegs of=20

hard wood driven into its side by the Base hunters, who had thus ascended t=
he slippery stem in=20

search of honey. Bees are very fond of these trees, as they are generally m=
ore or less hollow, and=20

well adapted for hives. The Adansonia digitata, although a tree, always rem=
inds me of a gigantic=20

fungus; the stem is disproportioned in its immense thickness to its height,=
 and its branches are few=20

in number, and as massive in character as the stem. The wood is not much fi=
rmer in substance=20

than cork, and is as succulent as a carrot. In Kordofan, where of all eyes,=
 for did not that big house=20

outside the town belong to her now? And when she dropped her handkerchief w=
et with her tears,=20

did not all the unmarried men, one of them even a lawyer, rush to pick it u=
p for her?  This incident=20

went to prove how much she had risen in people's estimation. After the fune=
ral, there was a=20

general gathering of all the family at Sztolarik's in order to hear the wil=
l read. Well, it was a rather=20

strange one on the whole.  The old gentleman had left 2000 florins to the A=
cademy of Arts and=20

Sciences, and 2000 florins to each of the ladies at whose houses he had vis=
ited years before, and=20

to those who had refused=20


_
frequently used as a reservoir; one of these huge hollow trees is cleaned o=
ut and filled with water=20

during the short rainy season. The fruit was ripe at the time we halted, an=
d after many attempts, by=20

throwing sticks, we succeeded in procuring a considerable number. The sub-a=
cid flavour of the=20

seeds, enveloped in a dry yellow powder within the large shell, was exceedi=
ngly refreshing.  The=20

immediate neighbourhood was a perfect exhibition of gum-arabic-bearing mimo=
sas. At this season=20

the gum was in perfection, and the finest quality was now before us in beau=
tiful amber-coloured=20

ladies were mentioned by name, and the legacy had been placed in the hands =
of Sztolarik to be=20

paid at once to the legatees.  The relations listened with bated breath, ev=
ery now and then=20

throwing in a remark, such as, "Very good. Quite right of him," etc. Only M=
rs. Panyoki muttered,=20

when the nine ladies' names were read out: "Dear me, how very strange!"  Bo=
ldizsar, who was of=20

opinion it was not worth while worrying over such trifles (after all, Pal h=
ad been slightly mad all his=20

life), said grandly:  "Please continue, Mr. Sztolarik."  The lawyer answere=
d shortly: "There is no=20

more!"=20


_
the size of a nutmeg to that of an orange. So great was the quantity, and s=
o excellent were the=20

specimens, that, leaving our horses tied to trees, both the Arabs and mysel=
f gathered a large=20

collection. This gum, although as hard as ice on the exterior, was limpid i=
n the centre, resembling=20

melted amber, and as clear as though refined by some artificial process. Th=
e trees were perfectly=20

denuded of leaves from the extreme drought, and the beautiful balls of fros=
ted yellow gum recalled=20

the idea of the precious jewels upon the trees in the garden of the wonderf=
ul lamp of the "Arabian=20

nights." This gum was exceedingly sweet and pleasant to the taste; but, alt=
hough of the most=20

valuable quality, there was no hand to  Their surprise was great, and there=
 was a general rush to=20

look at the will.  "Impossible!" they all exclaimed at once.  The lawyer tu=
rned his back on them=20

repeating:  "I tell you there is not another word!"  "And the rest of his f=
ortune, his estates in=20

Bohemia?"  "There is no mention of them. I can only read what I see written=
 here; you must at=20

least understand that, gentlemen."  "It is incomprehensible," groaned Gaspa=
r.  "The curious part of=20

it is," remarked Boldizsar, "that there is no mention of that woman and her=
 son."  "Yes, of course,"=20

answered Gaspar, "it does seem strange."  The lawyer hastened to reassure t=
hem.  "It can make=20

no difference to you," he said. "Whatever fortune there may be that is not=

of course," said=20

Gaspar, "and that is only right. But the money? Where is it? There must be =
any amount of it. I'm=20
