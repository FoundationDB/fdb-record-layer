mistakes, but spoke to the "children of men" in the only way in     which _=
children_ in their nonage=20

can be addressed; that the world     is, indeed, a very different place fro=
m that which it is assumed=20

to be; that what is derided as superstition is the only true and     the on=
ly scientific _knowledge_,=20

and moreover that modern     knowledge and modern science are to a great ex=
tent not only=20

_superstition_, but superstition of a very destructive and deadly     kind.=
(219)   All this is perfectly=20

true and correct. But it is also true that the _New Testament_, the _Acts_ =
and the _Epistles_--

however much the historical figure of Jesus may be true--are all symbolical=
 and allegorical=20

sayings, and that "it was not Jesus but Paul who was the real founder of Ch=
ristianity;"(220) but it=20

was not the official Church Christianity, at any rate. "The disciples were =
called Christians first in=20

Antioch," the _Acts of the Apostles_ tell us,(221) and they were not so cal=
led before, nor for a long=20

time after, but simply Nazarenes.  This view is found in more 668. Wisconsi=

centuries. But, hitherto, it has always been laid aside as an unproven hypo=
thesis, a blasphemous=20

assumption; though, as the author of _Paul, the Founder of Christianity_(22=

men as Irenaeus, Epiphanius and Eusebius have transmitted to     posterity =
a reputation for such=20
