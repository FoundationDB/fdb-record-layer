"Say, Jack, that's a dandy gun."  "Pretty fair," observed our hero, as he brought to view a fine new 

rifle, which he had sent for.  There was also a shotgun in the outfit, and many other things to be 

used on the trail and in camp. Nat's eyes showed his admiration.  "Jumping jillflowers!" he 

exclaimed, "but you are certainly doing this up good and brown, Jack."  "Yes, I don't like anything 

half done. It's bad for the digestion. You've got a gun, haven't you?"  "Oh, yes, a pretty fair one. 

But I wish I had one like yours."  "You can use it whenever you want to," was Jack's generous 

offer. "Budge hasn't any, and I'm going to let him take my old rifle, though I expect he'll get the lock 

all stuck up with gum, so it won't shoot."  "I'm glad Budge is going. He'll keep things lively."  "Yes, 

and I'm sorry    First Commandment  "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."  My friend, are 

you ready to be weighed against this commandment? Have you fulfilled, or are you willing to fulfil, 

all the requirements of this law? Put it into one of the scales, and step into the other. Is your heart 

set upon God alone? Have you no other God? Do you love Him above father or mother, the wife of 

your bosom, your children, home or land, wealth or pleasure?  If men were true to this 

commandment, obedience to the remaining nine would follow naturally. It is because they are 

unsound in this that they break the others.  FEELING AFTER GOD.  Philosophers are agreed that 

even the most primitive races of mankind reach out beyond the world of matter to a superior 

Being. It is as natural for man to feel after God as it is for the

to his guardian, and tell him I haven't seen Bill. Well, we're almost ready. I guess we can start in 

about three days."  "When will Sam and Bony arrive?"  "I expect them to-morrow. Then we'll make 

for the West, for the mountains, the bad lands, the desert, and the home of big game! Whoop! La-

la! Hold me down, Nat! I'm feeling fine!"  Jack began dancing about the loft, and the loose boards 

of the floor made such a racket as he leaped about, pulling Nat this way and that in his 

enthusiasm, that Budge, who was cleaning out the stable, called up from below: 

"'Sanythingwrong?"  "No, nothing's wrong, you old gum-masticating specimen of a big-horn 

sheep," replied Nat. "We're just working off some steam, that's all."  "Better send it back to 

Washington Hall," advised Budge. "They need it there."  "That's right," laughed Jack.  Sam 

Chalmers and Bony Balmore arrived the next day, and were entertained at Jack's house. 

Preparations were rushed, Nat and Budge finishing their packing, and two days later, with their 

guns, their camping outfits, and their baggage, they stood in the railroad station, ready to start for 

the West.  It was a fine, clear, crisp November day, all traces of the recent storm having 

disappeared, and it seemed as if winter, having sent on an advance agent, rather repented of 

opening the season so early.  "It will be fine hunting weather," said Jack as he and his chums 

waited for the train.  "Couldn't be better," agreed Nat.  At that moment the agent came hurrying 

from the depot, holding aloft an envelope.  "Here's a telegram for you, Jack Ranger," he said as he 

handed it over. "It just came."  "A telegram?" mused Jack. "I wonder who it's from?"  He tore open 

the envelope, and as he read the message he gave a start.     CHAPTER XIV  THE BROKEN 

TRAIN   "What is it?" asked Nat. "Any bad news? Can't you go camping?"  "It's a message from 

Mr. Gabel, Bill Williams' guardian," replied Jack. "He says he has a clue that Bill has gone out to a 

settlement on the Big Horn River, in Montana, and he wants me to tell him to go back to Hickville 

at once if I see him."  "But you're not likely to, are you? Is the Big Horn River near where we are 

going?" asked Bony.  "Not very, I guess," answered Jack. "The Big Horn starts in Wyoming, but I 

rather think the chances are a thousand to one against seeing Bill. Poor chap! He has a hard row 

to hoe. I wish I could help him, but if he's run away I don't see how I can."  "I wish we'd meet him 

out West," said Sam. "Wouldn't it be a joke if, after all, he could go camping with us and fool his 

mean old guardian?"  "Oh, what's the use discussing fairy tales?" asked Jack. "Are you fellows all 

ready? Don't leave anything behind, now."  "I guess we're all here--what there is of us," remarked 

Bony, cracking his finger joints.  Just then the whistle of an approaching train was heard. 

"Gotchertickets?" asked Budge Rankin, taking in a fresh wad of gum.  "Hu! Do you think I left them 

until now?" inquired Jack. "I've got all the tickets. That's our train, fellows. Now we'll say good-by to 

Denton for a while, and live in the wild and woolly West. Here, Budge, you take that satchel, and 

I'll tote the dress-suit case. Try and get seats together, boys."  A little later they were on the train 

and being whirled rapidly away from Denton. They had a long journey before them, and as the first 

part of it contained no features of interest the lads spent all their time discussing what was before 

them.  "I want to get a big buck mule deer," remarked Jack as they were talking about what kind of 

game they would be likely to find.  "Me for a big-horn sheep," said Nat. "I want to get the head 

mounted and put it in my room. Then I'll put my rifle across the horns, and show it to every one 

who comes in."  "I s'pose you'll tell 'em you shot it, won't you?" asked Bony.  "Of course. I will 

shoot it."  "You won't if you haven't improved your aim any since we were camping this summer." 

"I can shoot better than you can," retorted Nat.  "Like pie!" exclaimed Bony, discharging a whole 



volley of knuckle-bone shots.  "Why, you missed that big muskrat you aimed at, the day before 

Jack and I were kidnapped!" taunted Nat.  "Yes, but you joggled my arm."  "I did not."  "You did 

so."  "Hold on," interposed Jack in a quiet voice. "All the passengers are laughing at you two."  "I 

don't care," replied Nat. "I guess I can shoot as good as he can."  "Oh, I fancy there'll be game 

enough out there, so if you miss one thing you can hit another," consoled Sam. "What I want to 

see are the bad lands. Just think of thousands of small sandstone peaks, so much alike that they 

look like a stone forest, with sulphur springs here and there, and all sorts of queer-shaped rocks. It 

must be a great sight!"  "Yes, and it's easy to get lost among those same peaks," added Jack. "I 

read of a hunter who went out there, and he was so near camp that his friends could hear him 

shouting, but they couldn't locate him until he began to fire his gun, and then they had hard work 

because of the echoes. We'll have to keep together if we get in such a place as that."  "But there 

are some woods, aren't there?" asked Bony.  "Sure, woods, mountains, valleys, and all sorts of 

wild places," said Jack. "I fancy there'll be plenty of snow on the upper peaks, too, but it's likely to 

be nice and warm down below."  "What do you want to shoot, Budge?" asked Nat, for the gum-

chewing youth had not said much.  "Hu! Guessarabbit'lldome."  "A rabbit," remarked Jack. "Maybe 

we'll be glad of a good rabbit stew, or one roasted, in case these mighty hunters don't bring down 

a buck or a bear."  Thus they talked for many miles, until they had to change cars, where they took 

another road leading more directly West. They arrived at Chicago the morning after the day on 

which they had started, and spent some time in the Windy City. Then they started off again.  "Two 

days more and we'll be in Wyoming," remarked Jack the next afternoon, as they were speeding 

through Iowa. "Then for a good time. Eh, fellows?"  "That's what!" answered Sam. "My, but I'm 

getting stiff. I'd like to get out and have a ball game."  "So would I," said Nat.  Their train stopped at 

a small station, and was held there for some time.  "Wonder what we're waiting for?" ventured 

Jack. "What's the matter?" he asked of a brakeman who passed through their car at that moment. 

"Some block on the line ahead," support. Hunger and thirst drive him to seek for food, and there is 

a hunger of the soul that needs satisfying, too. Man does not need to be commanded to worship, 

as there is not a race so high or so low in the scale of civilization but has some kind of a god. What 

he needs is to be directed aright.  This is what the first commandment is for. Before we can 

worship intelligently, we must know what or whom to worship. God does not leave us in ignorance. 

When Paul vent to Athens, he found an altar dedicated to "An Unknown God," and he proceeded 

to tell of Him whom we worship. When God gave the commandments to Moses, He commenced 

with a declaration of His own character, and demanded exclusive recognition. "I am the Lord thy 

God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt 

have no other gods before me."  The Rev. Dr. Dale says these words have great significance. 

"The Jews knew Jehovah as the God who had held back the waves like a wall while they fled 

across the sea to escape the vengeance of their enemies; they knew him as the God who had 

sent thunder, and lightning, and hail, plagues on cattle, and plagues on men, to punish the 

Egyptians and to compel them to let the children of Israel go; they knew Him as the God whose 

angel had slain the firstborn of their oppressors, and filled the land from end to end with death, and 

agony, and terror. He was the same God, so Moses and Aaron told them, who by visions and 

voices, in promises and precepts, had revealed Himself long before to Abraham, Isaac, and 

Jacob. We learn what men are from what they say and from what they do. A biography of Luther 



gives a more vivid and trustworthy knowledge of the man than the most philosophical essay on his 

character and creed. The story of his imprisonment and of his journey to Worms, his Letters, his 

Sermons, and his Table-Talk, are worth more than the most elaborate speculations about him. 

The Jews learned what God is, not from theological dissertations on the Divine attributes, but from 

the facts of a Divine history. They knew Him for themselves in His own acts and His own words." 

Some one asked an Arab: "How do you know that there is a God?" "How do I know whether a 

man or a camel passed my tent last night?" he replied. God's footprints in nature and in our own 

experience are the best evidence of His existence and character.  THE ISRAELITES WERE 

EXPOSED TO DANGER.  Remember to whom this commandment was given, and we shall see 

further how necessary it was. The forefathers of the Israelites had worshipped idols, not many 

generations back. They had recently been delivered out of Egypt, a land of many gods. The 

Egyptians worshipped the sun, the moon, insects, animals, etc. The ten plagues were undoubtedly 

meant by God to bring confusion upon many of their sacred objects. The children of Israel were 

going up to take possession of a land that was inhabited by heathen, who also worshipped idols. 

There was therefore great need of such a commandment as this. There could be no right 

relationship between God and man in those days any more than to-day, until man understood that 

he must recognize God alone, and not offer Him a divided heart.  If He created us, He certainly 

ought to have our homage. Is it not right that He should have the first and only place in our 

affections?  NO COMPROMISE.  This is one matter in which no toleration can be shown. 

Religious liberty is a good thing, within certain limits. But it is one thing to show toleration to those 

who agree on essentials, and another, to those who differ on fundamental beliefs. They were 

willing to admit any god to the Roman Pantheon. One reason why the early Christians were 

persecuted was that they would not accept a place for Jesus Christ there. Napoleon is said to 

have entertained the idea of having separate temples in Paris for every known religion, so that 

every stranger should have a place of worship when attracted toward that city. Such plans are 

directly opposed to the Divine one. God sounded no uncertain note in this commandment. It is 

plain, unmistakable, uncompromising.  We may learn a lesson from the way a farmer deals with 

the little shoots that spring up around the trunk of an apple tree. They look promising, and one who 

has not learned better might welcome their growth. But the farmer knows that they will draw the 

life-sap from the main tree, injuring its prospects so that it will produce inferior fruit. He therefore 

takes his axe and his hoe, and cuts away these suckers. The tree then gives a more plentiful and 

a finer crop.  GOD'S PRUNING-KNIFE.  "Thou shalt not" is the pruning-knife that God uses. From 

beginning to end, the Bible calls for wholehearted allegiance to Him. There is to be no compromise 

with other gods.  It took long years for God to impress this lesson upon the Israelites. He called 

them to be a chosen nation. He made them a peculiar people. But you will notice in Bible history 

that they turned away from Him continually, and were punished with plague, pestilence, war and 

famine. Their sin was not that they renounced God altogether, but that they wanted to worship 

other gods beside Him. Take the case of Solomon as an example of the whole nation. He married 

heathen wives who turned away his heart after other gods, and built high places for their idols, and 

lent countenance to their worship. That was the history of frequent turnings of the whole nation 

away from God, until finally He sent them into captivity in Babylon and kept them there for seventy 

years. Since then the Jews have never turned to other gods.  Hasn't the church to contend with 



the same difficulty to-day? There are very few who in their hearts do not believe in God, but what 

they will not do is give Him exclusive right of way. Missionaries tell us that they could easily get 

converts if they did not require them to be baptized, thus publicly renouncing their idols. Many a 

person in our land would become a Christian if the gate was not so strait. Christianity is too strict 

for them. They are not ready to promise full allegiance to God alone. Many a professing Christian 

is a stumbling-block because his worship is divided. On Sunday he worships God; on week days 

God has little or no place in his thoughts.  FALSE GODS IN AMERICA TO-DAY.  You don't have 

to go to heathen lands to-day to find false gods. America is full of them. Whatever you make 


_
minutes."  There was some fretting among the passengers at the delay, but finally the train started 

off again. It proceeded slowly. Then followed some sharp whistles, and finally there sounded a 

report like a gun.  "It's a hold-up!" cried an excited man.  The boys and all about them leaped to 

their feet in alarm.  "That's what it is," went on the man. "It's a Wild West hold-up! Better hide your 

watches and money."  He began emptying his pockets of his valuables, and was thrusting them 

under his seat.  The train had come to a sudden stop.  "Do you s'pose it's train robbers?" asked 

Bony in some alarm.  "I don't know," answered Jack. "I guess----" 

"Where'sthegunsan'we'llshoot'em!" exclaimed Budge, jumping up.  Just then a brakeman ran 

through the car, carrying a red flag.  "What's the matter? Is it a hold-up? Are they after our 

money?"  These questions were rapidly fired at him.  "A freight train has broken in two just ahead 

of us," explained the railroad man. "The engine's disabled," he went on. "We've got to back up to a 

switch so as to pass it. I've got to go back with a danger flag."  "Oh, dear!" exclaimed a woman. 

"But who got shot? I'm sure I heard a gun go off."  "That was a torpedo on the track, ma'am," 

explained the brakeman. "The freight crew put it there on a sharp curve, so we wouldn't run into 

the tail-end of their train. It's all right. There's no danger."  The brakeman hurried down the steps 

of the last car, in which the boys were riding, and began to run along the track. When he was 

about a hundred yards away the train began to back slowly up.  "I wonder how far back we have to 

go to reach the switch?" asked Jack.  "About two miles," answered a man across the aisle from 

the lads. "It's near Mine Brook Station, and it'll take us quite a while to get there."  "Why?" asked 

Bony. "Can't the train go fast backward?"  "Yes, but the Whatever you love more than God is your 

idol. Many a mans heart is like some Kaffirs' huts, so full of idols that there is hardly room to turn 

around. Rich and poor, learned and unlearned, all classes of men and women are guilty of this sin. 

"The mean man boweth down, and the great man humbled himself."  A man may make a god of 

himself, of a child, of a mother, of some precious gift that God has bestowed upon him. He may 

forget the Giver, and let his heart go out in adoration toward the gift.  Many make a god of 

pleasure; that is what their hearts are set on. If some old Greek or Roman came to life again and 

saw men in a drunken debauch, would he believe that the worship of Bacchus had died out? If he 

saw the streets of our large cities filled with harlots, would he believe that the worship of Venus 

had ceased?  Others take fashion as their god. They give their time and thought to dress. They 

fear what others will think of them. Do not let us flatter ourselves that all idolaters are in heathen 

countries.  With many it is the god of money. We haven't got through worshipping the golden calf 

yet. If a man will sell his principles for gold, isn't he making it a god? If he trusts in his wealth to 

keep him from want and to supply his needs, are not riches his god? Many a man says, "Give me 

money, and I will give you heaven. What care I for all the glories and treasures of heaven? Give 

me treasures here! I don't care for heaven! I want to be a successful business man." How true are 

the words of Job: "If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my 

confidence; if I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had begotten 

much; if I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; and my heart hath 

been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were an iniquity to be 


_
to keep a certain distance in the rear of the last car, to warn any other trains that may be 

approaching behind us. So we really can't back up any faster than the brakeman can run. I don't 

like this delay, either, as I have an important engagement. But something always seems to be 

happening on this road. I God that is above."  But all false gods are not as gross as these. There 

is _the atheist_. He says that he does not believe in God; he denies His existence, but he can't 

help setting up some other god in His place. Voltaire said, "If there were no God, it would be 

necessary to invent one." So the atheist 


_
There were other grumbling remarks by the various passengers, but the boys were too interested 

in watching the brakeman to notice them. The train must have gotten too close to him, for it came 

to a stop, in obedience to a signal on the air whistle, and waited until the man with the red flag was 

out of sight around a curve. Then it began to back again.  This was kept up for some time, and 

finally the boys saw the brakeman come to a halt and wave his flag in a peculiar manner.  "He's at 

the switch now," remarked the man who had first spoken to the lads. "We'll soon be on our way 

again."  The train proceeded more slowly, and then the boys saw where a switch crossed from 

one track to another. The rear car was halted some distance from the cross-over, and a man came 

running up from the head end, carrying a key in his hand, with which to unlock the switch. He 

quickly turned it, and then began to wave his arm, as a signal for the engineer to back up. He 

continued to wave for several seconds, and then he exclaimed:  "He can't see me. Hey!" he called 

to a group of men on the back platform of the last car, "give him the whistle signal, will you?" 

"What?" asked a man.  "Give him the whistle. Blow it three times, so he'll back up. Hurry! I can't 

leave this switch."  The men did not seem to know what to do. Some of them began looking inside 

the car for the Mind, etc. Then there is _the deist_. He is a man who believes in one God who 

caused all things: but he doesn't believe in revelation. He only accepts such truths as can be 

discovered by reason. He doesn't believe in Jesus Christ, or in the inspiration of the Bible. Then 

there is _the pantheist_, who says: "I believe that the whole universe is God. He is in the air, the 

water, the sun, the stars."; the liar and the thief included.  MOSES' FAREWELL MESSAGE.  Let 

me call your attention to a verse in the thirty-second chapter of Deuteronomy, thirty-first verse: 

"For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges."  These words 

were uttered by Moses, in his farewell address to Israel. He had been with them forty years. He 

was their leader and instructor. All the blessings of heaven came to them through him. And now 

the old man is about to leave them. If you have never read his speech, do so. It is one of the best 

sermons in print. I know few sermons in the Old or New Testament that compare with it.  I can see 

Moses as he delivers this address. His natural activity has not abated. He still has the vigor of 

youth. His long white hair flows over his shoulders, and his venerable beard covers his breast. He 

throws down the challenge: "Their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being 

judges."  Has the human heart ever been

the train to the engineer's cab. This is now displaced by a small red cord at one side of the car, 

and it operated a whistle connected with the air-brake system.  "Pull the cord. Give him three 

whistles, can't you?" cried the man at the switch. "We can't lay here all day."  "I don't see any 

whistle," murmured the man who had told the boys about the switch. "Let him come and pull it 

himself. This is a queer road, where they expect the passengers to help run it."  "Can't some of 

you pleasure or riches fill the soul that is empty of God? How about the atheist, the deist, the 

pantheist? What do they look forward to? Nothing! Man's life is full of trouble; but when the billows 

of affliction and disappointment are rising and rolling over them, they have no God to call upon. 

"They shall cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense; but they shall not save them at all in 

the time of their trouble." Therefore I contend "their rock is not as our Rock."  My friends,

up."  Jack heard and understood. He had often seen the brakemen or conductor at the Denton 

station start the trains by pulling on something under the hood of the car, as they stood on the 

platform.  "I guess I can do it," he said as he worked his way through the crowd of passengers 

about the door.  He reached up, and his fingers encountered a thin cord. He pulled it slowly, as he 

had seen the railroad men do, for as the air pressure had to travel the entire length of the train it 

required some time, and a quick jerk would not have been effective.  Once, twice, three times Jack 

pulled the whistle cord, and he to give consolation. When I was settled in Chicago, I used to be 

called out to attend many funerals. I would inquire what the man was in his belief. If I found out he 

was an atheist, or a deist, or a pantheist, when I went to the funeral and in the presence of his 

friends said one word about that man's doctrine, they would feel insulted. Why is it that in a trying 

hour, when they have been talking all the time against God--why is it that in the darkness of 

affliction they call in believers in that God to administer consolation? Why doesn't the atheist 

preach no hereafter, no heaven, no God, in the hour of
