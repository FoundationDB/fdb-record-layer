beyond and was swallowed up by the all-enveloping gloom. The house was smal=
l and ugly;=20

square like a box and built of grey stone, its front flush with the road, i=
ts rear flanked by several=20

small outbuildings. Above the porch hung a plain sign-board bearing the leg=
end: "The Bottom Inn"=20

in white letters upon a black ground: to right and left of the porch there =
was a window with closed=20

shutters, and on the floor above two more windows--also shuttered--complete=
d the architectural=20

features of the Bottom Inn.  It was uncompromisingly ugly and uninviting, f=
or beyond the faint=20

glimmer of the lanthorn only one or two narrow streaks of light filtrated t=
hrough the chinks of the=20

shutters.   IV  The travellers, after some difference of opinion with their=
 respective horses,=20

contrived to pull up and to dismount without any untoward accident. The str=
anger looked about=20

him, peering into the darkness. The place indeed appeared dismal and inhosp=
itable enough: its=20

solitary aspect suggested footpads and the abode of cut-throats. The silenc=
e of the moor, the pall=20

of mist and gloom that hung over upland and valley sent a shiver through hi=
s spine.  "You are sure=20

this is the place?" he queried.  "Can't ye zee the zign?" retorted the othe=
r gruffly.  "Can you hold=20

the horses while I go in?"  "I doan't know as 'ow I can, Mounzeer. I've nev=
er 'eld two 'orzes all at=20

once. Suppose they was to start kickin' or thought o' runnin' away?"  "Runn=
ing away, you fool!"=20

muttered the stranger, whose temper had evidently suffered grievously durin=
g the weary, cold=20

journey from Chelwood. "I'll break your _satane_ head if anything happens t=
o the beasts. How can=20

I get back to Bath save the way I came? Do you think I want to spend the ni=
ght in this God-

forsaken hole?"  Without waiting to hear any further protests from the lout=
, he turned into the porch=20

and with his riding whip gave three consecutive raps against the door of th=
e inn, followed by two=20

more. The next moment there was the sound of a rattling of bolts and chains=
, the door was=20

cautiously opened and a timid voice queried:  "Is it Mounzeer?"  "Pardieu! =
Who else?" growled the=20

stranger. "Open the door, woman. I am perished with cold."  With an uncerem=
onious kick he=20

pushed the door further open and strode in. A woman was standing in the dim=
ly lighted passage.=20

As the stranger walked in she bobbed him a respectful curtsey.  "It is all =
right, Mounzeer," she=20

said; "the Captain's in the coffee-room. He came over from Bristol early th=
is afternoon."  "No one=20

else here, I hope," he queried curtly.  "No one, zir. It ain't their hour n=
ot yet. You'll 'ave the 'ouse to=20

yourself till after midnight. After that there'll be a bustle, I reckon. Tw=
o shiploads come into=20

Watchet last night--brandy and cloth, Mounzeer, so the Captain says, and wo=
rth a mint o' money.=20

The pack 'orzes will be through yere in the small hours."  "That's all righ=
t, then. Send me in a bite=20

and a mug of hot ale."  "I'll see to it, Mounzeer."  "And stay--have you so=
me sort of stabling where=20

the man can put the two horses up for an hour's rest?"  "Aye, aye, zir."  "=
Very well then, see to that=20

too: and see that the horses get a feed and a drink and give the man someth=
ing to eat."  "Very=20

good, Mounzeer. This way, zir. I'll see the man presently. Straight and a l=
ong-drawn wail, he sank=20

dead upon the snow; whereupon his amiable friends--when quite sure of his d=
emise--tore him limb=20

from limb and devoured him.  This was a fortunate respite for Vixen, most o=
f whose remaining=20

strength and pluck had been thrown into that magnificent fling.  Old Duncan=
, had he seen it, would=20

probably have styled it a "goot Highland fling."  But the respite was not o=
f long duration.  Their=20

leader formed but a mouthful to each of the pack.  When done, they returned=
 to encircle their=20

victim again, lick their chops, and wait.  Evening was drawing on, and a so=
rt of grey desolation=20

seemed to be creeping over the plains.  A decided thaw had been operating a=
ll that day, rendering=20

the snow soft. If the mare had only known the advantage thus given to her, =
a successful effort at=20



escape might have been made.  When snow on the prairie is frozen with a har=
d crust on the=20

surface, the light wolf can run easily on the top of it, while the heavy ho=
rse breaks through at every=20

stride and is soon knocked up.  The case is reversed when a thaw softens th=
e surface, for then the=20

short-legged wolf flounders helplessly in its depths, while the long-limbed=
 and powerful horse can=20

gallop through it with comparative ease.  But the good mare, intelligent th=
ough she was, did not=20

consider this fact, and the wolves, you may be sure, did not enlighten her.=
  Besides, by that time=20

she was well-nigh worn-out, and could not have made a vigorous run for life=
 even over a good=20

course.  Gradually, a worthy lieutenant of the old grey chief began to show=
 symptoms of=20

impatience, and the hungry circle closed in.  Vixen looked up and whinnied =
slightly.  It seemed a=20

pitiful appeal for help from the human friends who had cared for her so wel=
l and so long.=20

Perchance it was the last wail of despair--a final farewell to the green fi=
elds and the flowering=20

plains of memory.  Whatever it was, an answer came in the form of several d=
ark specks on the=20

horizon.  Vixen saw them, and whinnied again in a decidedly different tone.=
  The wolves also saw=20

them, and moved about uneasily.  On came the black specks, increasing in si=
ze as they drew=20

near.  The wolves looked at each other inquiringly, moved still more uneasi=
ly, appeared to hold a=20

consultation, and finally drew off to a neighbouring knoll, as if to await =
the result of this unlooked-

for interruption, and return to business when it was past.  The intelligenc=
e of the lower animals is=20

great--in some cases very great--but it does not amount to reason.  If it d=
id, those wolves would=20

not have sat there, in the pride of physical strength and personal freedom,=
 calmly awaiting their=20

doom, while Daniel and Peter Davidson, Duncan McKay junior, Okematan the Cr=
ee Indian,=20

another Indian named Kateegoose, and Jacques Bourassin, a half-breed, came =
thundering down=20

towards them like infuriated centaurs.  At last they seemed to realise the =
truth that "discretion is=20

the better part of valour," and began to retire from the scene--slowly at f=
irst.  Vixen, recognising=20

friends, trotted off with reviving strength, and a high head and tail to me=
et them.  Seeing this, Dan,=20

who led the party, drew rein so as to allow the steeds to recover breath be=
fore the final burst.  The=20

wolves, with that presumption which is usually=20


_
Captain's there, waiting for ye."  She closed the front door carefully, the=
n followed the stranger to=20

the door of the coffee-room. Outside an anxious voice was heard muttering a=
 string of=20

inconsequent and wholly superfluous "Whoa's!" Of a truth the two wearied na=
gs were only too=20

anxious for a little rest.     CHAPTER II  THE BOTTOM INN   I  A man was si=
tting, huddled up in=20

the ingle-nook of the small coffee-room, sipping hot ale from a tankard whi=
ch he had in his hand.=20

Anything less suggestive of a rough sea-faring life than his appearance it =
would be difficult to=20

conceive; and how he came by the appellation "the Captain" must for ever re=
main a mystery. He=20

was small and spare, with thin delicate face and slender hands: though dres=
sed in very rough=20

garments, he was obviously ill at ease in them; his narrow shoulders scarce=
ly appeared able to=20

bear the weight of the coarsely made coat, and his thin legs handmaid of ig=
norance, halted, and=20

sat down again to watch the progress of events.  Fatal self-confidence!  Th=
ey little knew the deep=20

duplicity of man!  "O you stupid brutes!" murmured Dan to himself, advancin=
g in a somewhat=20

sidling manner as if he meant to pass them.  They evidently believed this t=
o be his intention until=20

they saw the six horsemen turn their steeds straight in their direction and=
 charge them at full gallop=20

with a yell that drove rapid conviction to their brains.  Then, with tails =
between legs and ears flat=20

they fled.  But it was too late.  The horses scattered the soft snow with c=
omparative ease.  The=20

wolves plunged through it with difficulty.  First to overtake them was Pete=
r Davidson.  He put the=20

muzzle of his gun to the side of the grey lieutenant, and shot him through =
the heart.  His brother=20

Dan, selecting another of the pack, pointed at the ear and blew out its bra=
ins. Okematan,=20


_
reached midway up his lean thighs. His hair was lank and plentifully sprink=
led with grey: he wore it=20

tied at the nape of the neck with a silk bow which certainly did not harmon=
ise with the rest of his=20

clothing. A wide-brimmed felt hat something the shape of a sailor's, but wi=
th higher crown--of the=20

shape worn by the peasantry in Brittany--lay on the bench beside him.  When=
 the stranger entered=20

he had greeted him curtly, speaking in French.  The room was inexpressibly =
stuffy, and reeked of=20

the fumes of stale tobacco, stale victuals and stale beer; but it was warm,=
 and the stranger, stiff to=20

the marrow and wet to the skin, uttered an exclamation of well-being throug=
h the ribs of a third,=20

while Kateegoose transfixed a fourth. Duncan McKay shot a fifth, and Bouras=
sin knocked over a=20

sixth at comparatively long range, his horse being too poor or too tired to=
 come fairly up with the=20

pack.  There was no wasting of powder, shot, or shaft in this affair.  Each=
 man was an expert with=20

his weapon, and cool as the proverbial cucumber, though considerably excite=
d.  Loading as they=20

ran, they fitted and shot again, stretching six more of the enemy on the pl=
ain.  Then they pulled up=20

and suffered the rest to escape, being afraid to leave Vixen out of sight b=
ehind them, for that=20

happy creature, following and enjoying the sport as=20
