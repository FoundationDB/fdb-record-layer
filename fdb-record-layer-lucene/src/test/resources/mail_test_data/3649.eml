dracaena marginata gave it a sharp blow with his sheathed sword; this chang=
ed the scene to the "opera comique." In one instant the mule gave so vigoro=
us and unexpected a kick into the bowels of the attendant, that he fell upo=

snow-white garments, was precipitated head foremost into the muddy brook, a=

g eider-down quilt, and imagined he saw the corpse Mr. Mravucsan had spoken=
 of, hanging from a tree, waving from side to side in the wind, and nodding=
 its head at him, saying: "Oh, dracaena marginata gave it a sharp blow with=

other minstrels, upon hearing of the Austrian dollars, would pay us a visit=

deeds.  In the afternoon, we were sitting beneath the shade of our tamarind=
 tree when we thought=20

we could perceive our musical friend returning. As he drew near, we were co=
nvinced that it was=20

the identical minstrel, who had most probably been sent with a message from=
 Mek Nimmur: there=20

he was, in snow-white raiment, on the snow-white mule, with the mounted att=
endant and the violin=20

as before. He dismounted upon arrival opposite the camp, and approached wit=
h his usual foppish=20

bow; but we looked on in astonishment: it was not our Paganini, it was ANOT=
HER MINSTREL!=20

who was determined to sing an ode in our praise. I felt that this was an in=
direct appeal to Maria=20

Theresa, and I at once declared against music. I begged him not to sing; "m=
y wife had a=20

headache--I disliked the fiddle--could he play anything else instead?" and =
I expressed a variety of=20

polite excuses, but to no purpose; he insisted upon singing; if I "disliked=
 the fiddle, he would sing=20

without an accompaniment, but he could not think of insulting so great a ma=
n as myself by=20

returning without an ode to commemorate our arrival."  I was determined tha=
t he should NOT sing;=20

he was determined that he WOULD, therefore I desired him to leave my camp; =
this he agreed to=20

do, provided I would allow him to cross the stream, and sing to my Tokroori=
s, in my praise,=20

beneath a neighbouring tree live like a prince henceforward, spend the wint=
er in Budapest, or on=20

the Riviera, in Monaco, and the summer at Ostend; in fact, he would be a gr=
and gentleman, and=20

not even look at poor priests' sisters. (How tiresome it was, his thoughts =
would always return to=20

Veronica.)  Sleep would not come, how could it be expected? One scheme afte=
r the other passed=20

before his mind's eye, like the butterflies in the Glogova woods. And he ch=
ased them all in turn.=20

Oh! if it were only daylight, and he could move on. His watch was ticking o=
n the table beside his=20

bed; he looked at it, the hands pointed to midnight. Impossible! It must be=
 later than that; his watch=20

must be slow! Somewhere in the distance a cock crew, as much as to say: "Yo=
ur watch is quite=20

right, Mr. Wibra." He heard faint sounds of music proceeding from the "Froz=
en Sheep" in the=20

distance, and some one on his way home was singing a Slovak shepherd's song=
.  Gyuri lighted a=20

cigar, and sat down to smoke it and think things over. How strangely the um=
brella had been found-

-at least _he_ had not found it yet, it was not yet in his possession, and =
when he came to look at=20

the facts, he found he was not much nearer to it than he had been. Until no=
w he had supposed it=20

had been thrown away as a useless rag, and he had had little hope of findin=
g it. And now, what=20

had happened? Things were quite different to what they had imagined them; f=
or as it turned out,=20

the umbrella was a treasure, a relic in=20


_
to ford the muddy stream, and he descended the steep bank, followed by his =
attendant on foot,=20

who drove the unwilling mule. Upon arrival at the brink of the dirty brook,=
 that was about three feet=20

deep, the mule positively refused to enter the water, and stood firm with i=
ts fore feet sunk deep in=20

the mud. The about it? What was he to say to the priest to-morrow? "I have =
come for my=20

umbrella"? The priest would only laugh at him, for, either he was bigoted a=
nd superstitious, in=20

which case he would believe St. Peter had brought the umbrella to his siste=
r, or he was a=20

Pharisee, and in that case he would not be such a=20
