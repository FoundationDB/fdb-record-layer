 not how to finish his sentence.  "Really, Mr. Sands," said the embarrassed=
 sailor, "I do not see what I could possibly do. I'm not in high favor with=
 your wife; any interference on my part she would certainly take appeared t=

 there was comfort in a=20

drop. I don't mean to say she was right, but it's too common a mistake; I--=
I think the world's hard=20

upon her, Mr. Franks,--she has been tempted, grievously tempted; but there'=
s very good metal in=20

her yet."  There was something touching to the sailor in the effort of the =
poor injured husband to=20

throw a veil of indulgence over the glaring fault of his wife. Though her i=
ntemperance was ruining=20

his comfort, and disgracing his name, and might seriously injure his worldl=
y position, Sands's=20

anxiety was to find some excuse for his wretched partner. For the affection=
s of the quiet, stiff,=20

formal man still clung to the choice of his youth.  John Sands had loved Na=
ncy almost from his=20

boyhood; often had he been jested about his fancy for the boisterous black-=
eyed girl, who cared=20

so little for him. When Nancy had grown into a bold, self-willed woman, rea=
dy enough to receive=20

his attentions, but trifling with his feelings, and not returning his love,=
 Sands had seen, time after=20

time, some rival preferred to himself, and had heard, with silent anguish, =
that the only girl that he=20

had ever cared for was to be married to some one else. Yet, somehow or othe=
r, every=20

engagement of Nancy's was broken off; perhaps few men, when it came to the =
point of decision,=20

would have wished to be linked for life to Bangham's termagant daughter. So=
, after many long=20

years of patient, sorrowful waiting, John at length had  The detective prom=
ised to do his best,=20

(which was said to be very good), held out hopes of success, and assured me=
 of his discretion. On=20

the whole, I was pleased with him. He looked like a man who thoroughly knew=
 his business; and=20

had it not been for the solemn warning of the Foreign Secretary, and the ri=
sk for Maxine, I would=20

gladly have put more efficient weapons in Girard's hands, by telling him ev=
erything.  By the time=20

that the detective had been primed with such facts and details as I could g=
ive, it was past ten=20

o'clock. I could see my way to do nothing more for the moment, and as I was=
 half famished, I=20

whizzed back in my hired automobile to the Elysee Palace Hotel. There I had=
 food served in my=20

own sitting-room, lest George Sandford should chance inconveniently upon so=
me acquaintance of=20

Ivor Dundas, in the restaurant. I did not hurry over the meal, for all I wa=
nted now was to arrive at=20

Maxine de Renzie's house at twelve o'clock, and tell her my news--or lack o=
f news. She would be=20

there waiting for me, I was sure, no matter how prompt I might be, for thou=
gh in ordinary=20

circumstances, after the first performance of a new play, either Maxine wou=
ld have gone out to=20

supper, or invited guests to sup with her, she would have accepted no invit=
ation, given none, for=20

to-night. She would hurry out of the theatre, probably without waiting to r=
emove her stage make-

up, and she would go home unaccompanied, except by her maid.  Maxine lives =
in a charming little=20

old-fashioned house, set back=20


_
he had chosen ill for his own peace of mind. Nancy might have made a good, =
hard-working wife to=20

a man who would have ruled as well as loved her,--one who would have taught=
 her to obey; but=20

where she should have had a master, she found a servant; she despised Sands=
 for his very=20

anxiety to please her, and readiness to yield to her wishes. There was no o=
pen rupture between=20

them; the wife ruled and the husband obeyed and never complained, till at l=
ength Nancy's own=20

eached in ten minutes'=20

drive from my hotel. I would not go as far as the gate, but would dismiss m=
y cab at the corner of=20

the quiet street, as it would not he wise to advertise the fact that Mademo=
iselle de Renzie was=20

me plenty of time for all=20

this: therefore, at about a quarter to twelve I started to go=20

of intemperance made John's misery a thing which no longer could be conceal=
ed from the world.=20

The clerk seemed to expect some reply. The sailor was puzzled what to say; =
he feared to hurt=20

Sands by expressing any pity, and he was too sincere to express any hope. B=
ut as the dead=20

silence became very painful, Ned broke it by saying, "I wish with all my he=
art I could help you."=20

"That's it, that's just it," said John Sands, raising his drooping almost r=
an against the last person on=20

earth I expected to see--Diana Forrest.  She was not alone, of course; but =
for a second or two I=20

saw no one else. There was none other except her precious and beautiful fac=
e in the world; and=20

for a wild instant I asked myself if she had come here to see me, to take b=
ack all her cruel words=20

of misunderstanding, and to take me hack also. But it was only for an insta=
nt--a very mad instant.=20

Then I=20

head a little; "you're the only man I could have asked. You see," he contin=
ued, uneasily, "Mrs.=20

earts; the metal is=20

good, very good; but I can't be always beside her, and I'm called up to Lon=
