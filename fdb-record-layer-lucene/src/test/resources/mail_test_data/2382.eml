and it was at once suspected to have a sinister object. This notion spread =
like wildfire throughout=20

the whole borough, and a scene of excitement ensued which literally beggars=
 description; nothing=20

has ever equalled it in electioneering development. The Green Swan at one t=
ime ran great risk of=20

utter demolition. A few innocent people, suspected of participation in the =
fraud, were punished by=20

the mob, who must have a victim or two, and who wreaked their vengeance upo=
n suspects in the=20

absence of those real delinquents that by this time were safely proceeding =
southwards to the great=20

metropolis in the train which they had met.  The windows of Mr. Fipps's hot=
el were broken. The=20

remonstrances of the landlord were not believed by a large portion of the c=
rowd, although, for that=20

worthy's reputation, it may be stated a large contingent of the rioters did=
 put faith in his=20

asseverations.  The committee-room was broken into and ransacked, and no li=
ttle glee was=20

excited when the strong-box was discovered. A fitful gleam of savage hope t=
ook possession of the=20

discoverers. They thought for a moment they had grasped a treasure, and the=
 prospect of a grand=20

loot cheered their hearts. This discovery also soon got communicated to the=
 crowd outside. There=20

was a demand that the box should be brought out into the Market-place, and =
its contents=20

distributed fairly amongst them. With much difficulty the ponderous chest w=
as carried down-stairs=20

and into the street. For a while the lock withstood all efforts to break it=
 open; but at length a smith=20

came, with tools that would have almost battered down the gate of a fortres=
s. With this effective=20

aid the hasp was fractured or detached, and the lid of the mysterious box w=
as lifted. To their=20

surprise and astonishment, carefully embedded in sawdust were found--not th=
e sovereigns that=20

were to have compensated the various messengers, flag-bearers, check-clerks=
, poll-clerks, &c.,=20

&c., &c.; but--do not start, gentle reader, in amazement--ten solid lumps o=
f fine Scotch granite,=20

which had been diverted from their legitimate purpose (that of forming part=
 of the roadway in=20

Oxford Street) to the unhallowed desecration of the free and independent el=
ectors of N----. Shouts=20

of derision, and anathemas both profound and deep, were uttered; imprecatio=
ns of the direst were=20

showered on the whilom popular candidate; and it may be accepted as a fact =
that, if Mr. Fipps, or=20

his attorney, or my man, had fallen into the hands of that enraged crowd, h=
is legal representatives=20

would have been entitled to make a claim on the offices in which he had ins=
ured his life.  The=20

retreat of Fipps and the discovery were themes of merriment; but perhaps in=
 no part of the=20

borough was the joke or trick so much relished as in the committee-room of =
Mr. Jollefat, our real=20

candidate.  It should be also stated, for the reader's information--and he =
is particularly requested=20

to notice--that the general postal delivery from London conveyed to each of=
 the central committee-

rooms of Mr. Fipps's rivals an oblong packet, addressed to each of the rema=
ining candidates by=20

name, and to their agents, and to all others whom it might concern, giving =
them formal notice that=20

the men whose names were included in lists which were enclosed in the commu=
nication (being=20

free and independent electors of N----) had disqualified themselves from vo=
ting at the present=20

election, by having accepted offices of emolument, under binding legal cont=
racts with one of the=20

candidates.  In consequence of this notice the poor wretches who had entere=
d into the=20

engagements mentioned with my man were unable to sell their votes and consc=
iences to Mr.=20

Twitch, if he had been inclined to buy them; because, if he had bought up t=
he tainted electors, he=20

would thereby have insured a petition against his return, with the certaint=
y that his rival would, by a=20

scrutiny, unseat him. The returning officer received a similar letter and a=
 similar list.  The poll being=20

kept open under these circumstances, the general result may be pretty well =
ascertained by the=20



reader's imagination; but, for his particular information, I may state that=
 the numbers announced=20

by the returning officer were:    Jollefat   209   Twitch      64   Fipps  =
      1  The consequence was,=20

that the first-named gentleman was duly returned, and took his seat, and wa=
s for a period of=20

several years the unchallenged representative of the borough of N----. It i=
s fair to say that he was=20

returned, at a comparatively small cost, by a large majority of the honest =
suffrages of the decent=20

men of the borough. My man, I believe, had succeeded in disqualifying for o=
nce all the corruption=20

of that notorious place.  The landlord of the Green Swan was of course very=
 glum over his=20

misfortunes. He managed to get his broken glass and other damage repaired a=
t the expense of=20

the Hundred; but he had given up all chance of recovering his debt from Mr.=
 Fipps, when he=20

received a letter from a well-known political solicitor of Westminster, sta=
ting it was not the desire of=20

Mr. Fipps that any person's honest claim should go unsatisfied; and that if=
 mine host would make=20

out his account and forward it to him, it should be examined, and if found =
correct be settled. The=20

account was duly rendered, and on being scrutinised or audited was deemed e=
xcessive. Two-

thirds of the total amount--that is to say, 100_l._--was remitted him; and,=
 although 50_l._ was thus=20

knocked off, I have solid reason for believing he did not fare ill by the c=
andidature of Horatio=20

Mount-Stephen Fipps.  One little circumstance none of us had anticipated no=
w arose, to our=20

embarrassment. The payment of that bill of the landlord of the Green Swan t=
old the story of=20

Fipps's purse with approximate accuracy. Mr. Jollefat, the successful candi=
date, was now=20

suspected by many people of being near the bottom of my Great Trick. To get=
 at him, however, it=20

was necessary to track and attack Fipps, which, I am sorry to say, the disa=
ppointed free and=20

independent electors who could not vote at the late election succeeded in d=
oing. How they=20

discovered him is to me a secret at this day; but they certainly did someho=
w find him out, and they=20

assaulted him by a battery of writs issued out of her Majesty's Court of Co=
mmon Pleas, at=20

Westminster. A counsel learned in the law advised that we had a good defenc=
e to these actions,=20

on the ground that the agreements for service were contracts to pay money e=
ither to induce men=20

to vote--which was bribery--or not to vote, which rendered the engagements =
null and void. About=20

the first point I believe there could be no doubt; around the second I beli=
eve there did exist much=20

room for speculation and legal ingenuity. Mr. Jollefat, however, wished to =
avoid discredit with his=20

constituents; so it was thought expedient to get rid of the difficulty by a=
nother mode. Fipps was a=20

man of cosmopolitan tastes, and he had not the phrenological organs of loca=
lity and adhesiveness=20

largely developed. It mattered not much to him on which side of the Atlanti=
c or of the Pacific he=20

dwelt. Somebody on his behalf, an attorney, intimated to the solicitor for =
Mr. Jollefat that it would=20

be cheaper to "square" Fipps than to submit to the game process all the vot=
ers and their actions.=20

One hundred pounds was the sum named as one that would take the eloquent an=
d popular=20

candidate beyond the jurisdiction of her Majesty's judges and officers. The=
 amount was provided,=20

and he quietly set sail, or rather took steam, for the United States of Ame=
rica, where, I am told, an=20

ample scope and opportunity for the exercise of the peculiar abilities of t=
hat popular candidate has=20

always been found in the service of the various parties who divide the spoi=
ls of the Model=20

Republic.     MISTAKEN IDENTITY   An eminently respectable tradesman was se=
ated in his cosy=20

little parlour, or counting-house, at the back of his shop, within a mile o=
f the Mansion House in the=20

City of London, one summer afternoon in the year 1861. His wife was the onl=
y other person=20

present on this occasion. It was an unusual circumstance for this lady to b=
e there, as Mr. Delmar=20



also occupied, for purposes of residence, a neat little house in an eastern=
 suburb of the=20

metropolis. He was, moreover, the father of a family. He had four sons and =
three daughters,=20

whose ages varied between seven and twenty-two. He was churchwarden of the =
parish in which=20

he carried on business. He was regarded as the very pattern of domestic vir=
tue, and a model of=20

rectitude in business. Few men, indeed, in the whole world enjoyed a better=
 reputation than Mr.=20

Delmar. Nobody had ever breathed a word against his character, and nobody h=
ad a right to do so.=20

His fireside was as cheerful as moderate prosperity, a good wife, and dutif=
ul children could render=20

it.  These particulars about Mr. Delmar, his family, his connexions, his ci=
rcumstances, and his=20

reputation, are necessary to enable the reader to appreciate the incidents =
I have to describe.  Mrs.=20

Delmar had come to town, on the present occasion, for the legitimate purpos=
e of shopping. She=20

was giving her prudent spouse an estimate of the call she needed--or consid=
ered that she needed-

-to make upon his purse for a variety of domestic necessities, from little =
child's-shoes to her own=20

and her eldest daughter's bonnets. Mr. Delmar was checking off the anticipa=
ted outlay, or, as I=20

may put it, revising the domestic estimates, with a prudence quite commenda=
ble and, I also think,=20

consistent with a good husband and father's affection for those dependent o=
n him.  An assistant of=20

Mr. Delmar's entered the parlour, or counting-house, and observed, "A gentl=
eman wishes to see=20

you, sir, in the shop."  "Show him in, Williams."  "He says he wishes to se=
e you privately, sir."=20

"Privately!" exclaimed Mr. Delmar, in tones of surprise; "show him in;" and=
 the speaker glanced at=20

his better half as he finished the sentence.  Williams left the room and in=
formed the gentleman,=20

who was standing in the shop, that his master wished him to walk in.  "You =
told me," observed the=20

unknown visitor to the shopman, "that Mrs. Delmar was with her husband?"  "=
Yes, sir," was the=20

reply.  "I would rather Mr. Delmar should step out to me."  "He will not do=
 it, sir. He says you are to=20

go in to him."  "Well, I will see him."  The unknown visitor advanced to th=
e apartment in which the=20

worthy and happy couple were closeted; he cautiously, not to say nervously,=
 opened the door, and=20

seemed to halt in the execution of his purpose.  "I would very much rather =
see you alone, sir, for a=20

moment."  "You cannot see me alone, sir; this lady is my wife."  "My busine=
ss is private."  "I have=20

no private business or secrets unknown to my wife, sir," exclaimed Mr. Delm=
ar, growing a little=20

irritated.  "Well, sir, you will oblige me if you will step out a moment." =
 "I tell you, sir, I have no=20

secrets from my wife. What is your business?"  "You really, sir----"  "What=
 do you mean, sir? I=20

insist upon your telling me immediately what brings you here. And if you do=
 not, I will kick you into=20

the street."  Mr. Delmar uttered these words in a tone which alarmed his vi=
sitor, who, perhaps,=20

apprehended the fulfilment of the threat which his delicacy had elicited; b=
ut, summoning his=20

courage, he advanced towards the desk and took from his pocket a paper, whi=
ch he handed in=20

silence to the astonished and indignant husband.  It was a summons to show =
cause why he=20

should not maintain a female child which one Selina Wilkins, chambermaid at=
 the Griffin's Head=20

Hotel (an excellent hostelry, well known to commercial travellers on the mi=
dland road who call at=20

the town of ----), was the mother of.  Mr. Delmar was a man who had seen mu=
ch of the world,=20

although he had, happily for himself, not known many of its vicissitudes, o=
r its wickednesses and=20

perils. His knowledge and experience were, however, at fault on the present=
 occasion. During two=20

or three minutes of perfect silence, in which the three persons glanced at =
one another alternately,=20

Mr. Delmar was a prey to conflicting emotions and cross purposes. At first =
he was disposed,=20

without warning, to enforce the threat he had not long ago made, and punish=
 the agent of the=20



infamous practical joke now being practised at his expense, as he conceived=
 it, by inflicting upon=20

him an ignominious and severe chastisement. Next, he trembled before a vagu=
e apprehension=20

that some foul conspiracy might have been devised for the ruin of his own a=
nd his family's=20

domestic peace. The inquiry passed through his mind. Had he acted prudently=
 in compelling the=20

disguised officer to serve the process in the presence of Mrs. Delmar? Shou=
ld he treat the=20

messenger who brought this scandalous official libel with civility? Should =
he take him into=20

confidence? What, indeed, should he do?  Within the brief space of three mi=
nutes he had many=20

times doubted whether, after all, it was a prudent thing for a man of busin=
ess, and a man of the=20

world, to let his wife know all his secrets. At last he resolved to pursue =
in this emergency that=20

frankness and uprightness towards his wife, which had been the source of so=
 much comfort to=20

them both in those various emergencies which even the serene life of a pros=
perous London=20

tradesman occasionally encounters.  The wife had looked on the previous sce=
ne in amazement=20

and fear. The changing hues of her husband's countenance, the twitching of =
the muscles in his=20

face, the spasmodic movement of his limbs, under suppressed rage, disgust, =
and dread, told her=20

that the document she had seen handed to him was the premonitory note of so=
mething very=20

dreadful. If she had not so well and thoroughly known the rectitude and hon=
ourableness of the=20

father of her children, she might have jumped to the conclusion, in her bew=
ilderment, that he had=20

committed forgery, or murdered some one, and that the summons was a warrant=
 for his=20

apprehension on a charge that might have consigned him to Portland or led h=
im to the gallows.=20

The officer was the first to break silence.  "It is a painful duty, sir."  =
"Never mind. But what does this=20

mean?" Mr. Delmar replied, rapidly passing from affected indifference to pa=
inful curiosity.  "You=20

see, sir, what it is," said the officer.  Had Mr. Delmar's leg and boot bee=
n slighter than they were, a=20

smile might have passed from the inner to the outer man of the speaker.  "I=
 know, sir, what it is,"=20

retorted Mr. Delmar; and summoning all his moral resolution, and lifting hi=
mself to a height of=20

moral dignity, which perhaps he had never occupied in any one moment of his=
 wedded life, from=20

the day when in his young and pure manhood he had taken that woman, every w=
ay worthy, to be=20

his partner and help-meet to the altar, he added:  "I am very glad indeed, =
sir, for one thing only,--

that I did not consent to see you, or accept at your hand this infamous pap=
er, unknown to my=20

wife."  Still Mrs. Delmar was silent, bewildered, and intensely anxious.  "=
I have done my duty," said=20

the officer, in an apologetic tone, glancing at the door, as if desirous of=
 withdrawing.  "You may=20

leave," said Mr. Delmar.  I draw a veil over the scene which followed. It i=
s enough, at all events,=20

the reader should know that Mr. Delmar read the document to his wife, expla=
ined its exact purport,=20

and craved her assistance in penetrating the mystery. He had no occasion to=
 ask her whether she=20

believed him guilty of the offence attributed to him. She volunteered an as=
surance of her belief in=20

its untruthfulness. She felt and declared that it was the result of some aw=
ful mistake of personal=20

identity, or some most foul conspiracy.  It would be incorrect to say that =
the interchange of=20

confidence did not leave a painful sense of the possible consequences of th=
is mysterious incident;=20

yet it may be affirmed that the event did not estrange a particle of that w=
oman's love, nor for a=20

moment excite in her breast one flimsy or evanescent doubt of the fidelity =
of her husband.  The=20

unfortunate man who was thus called upon to defend himself against a charge=
 of which he was no=20

more guilty than my reader is, went to his lawyer, who said he could not ma=
ke it out. This=20

gentleman, Mr. Drawly, was at a loss to determine whether his client was fo=
ol enough to be=20



deceiving him, or whether he was the victim of what Mrs. Delmar had called =
a foul conspiracy, or=20

whether an artfully planned scheme of extortion had been practised against =
him.  I was now=20

consulted. I should have liked to have been intrusted with full personal di=
scretion, so that I might=20

have investigated the mystery in my own way. I think I might have more easi=
ly cleared it up, if I=20

had not been embarrassed by the definiteness of my instructions. I was, how=
ever, told to inquire,=20

in the first place, whether Selina Wilkins had employed any solicitor, and =
if so, to put myself in=20

communication with him. I was told to use my best skill in tracing what I c=
ould; at the same time, if=20

the professional man on the other side were a man of reputation, to deal fr=
ankly with him. I was to=20

explain the position in life and the character of the defendant, and urge t=
he improbability of his=20

having committed any such offence against domestic propriety as that he was=
 charged with; and I=20

was told to endeavour to get the affair cleared up or settled without scand=
al or notoriety.  I did as I=20

was requested. My habit, when my instructions from solicitors were definite=
, was to follow them=20

implicitly. This commonly saved me much trouble, and when the result was no=
t unsatisfactory I=20

liked that course all the better; but sometimes the plan a little tantalise=
d and vexed me, because I=20

conceived that through it I missed my aim, and did not obtain the credit by=
 success I might (so-

called), it seems that the wind is blowing directly in your face.  In like =
manner, it appears that a=20

wind from west to east is merely an air-current moving a little more rapidl=
y than the earth revolves=20

at that point. The relative difference between the velocity of air-currents=
 must vary greatly; for a=20

violent easterly or westerly wind very near the poles may equal or even exc=
eed the speed of the=20

rotation of that point; while the most violent tropical storms average betw=
een one-twentieth and=20

one-eighth of the local rotation. The latter is not often exceeded. But wha=
tever the relation of the=20

respective velocities, it is clear that the velocity of the wind in general=
 must depend largely on the=20

amount of air abnormally heated, and upon the rapidity with which it is hea=
ted. So men have come=20

to recognize that a period of unusually oppressive heat forebodes a storm o=
f some sort. But few=20

regard the unusual warmth as a reason of the storm. They are linked, in the=
 popular mind, as=20

antecedent and consequent, rather than as cause and effect.  These constant=
 winds near the=20

equator have been named trade-winds, because of their importance to commerc=
e. Unknown=20

before the first voyage of Columbus, they filled the minds of his crew with=
 fear that they could=20

never return home, if the wind blew always in one direction. The same gentl=
e wind bore Magellan=20

in his voyage around the world, and caused him to give the name of =E2=80=
=9CPacific,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cpeaceful,=E2=80=9D to the=20

great ocean on our west; and the same steady breezes made the fortune of ma=
ny a noble galleon=20

in the days when Peru was an Ophir, Mexico an El Dorado, and the Philippine=
 Isles a Tarshish=20

where they took shipping for the distant land of gold.  Owing to the fact t=
hat the continents=20

intercept the regular trades by reason of their elevation and irregular con=
formation, and also=20

because of their much greater specific heat, whereby they set in motion man=
y other local currents,=20

the trades are found to begin only a considerable distance to the west of t=
he continents. Yet the=20

influence of the trades is sufficient to make easterly winds the prevailing=
 ones on the great inland=20

plains: as in the Sahara, Arabia, Southern Siberia, and portions of North a=
nd South America.  It is=20

clear that other nearly constant currents must exist to supply the vacuum t=
hat would be otherwise=20

caused by the trades. These are found to the south and north of the trade b=
elts, and, as might be=20

expected, blow nearly in the opposite direction, being descending currents;=
 while the trades, as=20

before stated, are ascending. The column of hot air from the equator starts=
 toward the poles above=20



the trades, while a polar current sets in toward the equator; but as the am=
ount of air displaced at=20

the equator is by far the greatest, much of it can, of course, never reach =
the poles. On meeting the=20

polar current, the two partially mingle and descend, forming what is called=
 the return trade. This=20

blows, most of the year, to the southeast, the equatorial current prevailin=
g and coming from a=20

region whose easterly rotation is more rapid. At certain seasons of the yea=
r, however, the polar=20

current prevails to some extent, though not sufficiently to overcome the ea=
stward trend; so the=20

wind in this belt blows alternately to the southeast and the northeast.  Be=
tween the region of=20

trades and alternating winds is a belt, on either side of the equator, of c=
alms and variable winds,=20

which shift northward or southward, parallel to the belt of calms between t=
he trades. These two=20

zones, however, are much less clearly defined than the great central one, a=
nd are not liable to=20

such extraordinary disturbances.  Such is the great constant wind, with its=
 dependents. So long as=20

the sun has warmed the earth, it has hurried on its course, subject to unce=
asing law, and destined=20

to cease only when the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and chaos or =
annihilation shall=20

end the things that be. A Wandering Jew of the atmosphere, it flies ever on=
ward, bearing the=20

merchant to his port, and the rain-cloud to the land; ever and anon desolat=
ing the isles with its=20

bursts of fury; then resuming its restless course, like the remorseful Sala=
thiel.     CHAPTER III.=20

PERIODIC WINDS.      =E2=80=9CEarth has each year her resurrection hours   =
   When the spring stirs=20

within her, and the powers      Of life revive; the sleeping zephyrs rouse,=
      The blushing orchards=20

clothe their naked boughs,      The swallow skims above the lakelet=E2=80=
=99s verge.      Swift summer=20

speeds with fire in every vein,      And autumn=E2=80=99s glories crimson h=
ill and plain.      Then warmth and=20

life from Nature take their flight,      And winter robes her in a shroud o=
f white,      While mournful=20

Boreas chants her funeral dirge.=E2=80=9D   So the seasons tread their ceas=
eless round in the temperate=20

zones, and to a certain degree in the colder regions of the earth. But when=
 we examine the=20

change of seasons in the tropical world, we find a state of things so diffe=
rent that we are at once=20

led to inquire the reason: and it will be found primarily in certain period=
ical winds.  When the sun is=20

north of the equator: that is, while our northern summer is in progress, In=
dia enjoys a steady sea=20

wind from the southwest, which brings a rainy season to the corresponding c=
oasts of Hindostan=20

and Farther India. When the sun returns to the south, the winds set in from=
 the opposite direction,=20

coming down across the great upland plateau of Central Asia, sometimes call=
ed, from its immense=20

height and extent, the =E2=80=9CRoof of the World.=E2=80=9D These periodic =
winds are called monsoons: a=20

corruption of the Arabic word _Moussin_, season. They are in reality a modi=
fication of the trade-

winds.  A glance at a map will show that the northern half of the great Ind=
ian Ocean is enclosed by=20

land masses as no other large body of water is. Consequently, while in the =
southern section the=20

southeast trade is present, the northeast trade of the northern part is so =
modified by the=20

surrounding land areas as to almost entirely lose its distinctive character=
. Hence, most tropical=20

regions have, properly speaking, but two seasons: the rainy, and the dry. A=
s the clouds swept in=20

meet with an intensely heated region, the trade never chills them sufficien=
tly to produce snow,=20

except in extremely elevated regions.  This is the direct cause of the mons=
oons: During the=20

northern summer, southern Asia, being under the rays of the vertical sun, b=
ecomes intensely=20

heated; and the cooler and denser air of the adjacent ocean, and of souther=
n Africa, flows towards=20

it, producing the southwest monsoon, which lasts from April or May to Septe=
mber or October. The=20

time of its beginning and its close varies in different latitudes, accordin=
g to the time at which the=20



sun is vertical in each.  During the southern summer, southern Africa being=
 under the vertical sun=20

and intensely heated, the cooler air of the surrounding seas, and of southe=
rn Asia, flows towards=20

it. This produces the northeast monsoon, which lasts from October or Novemb=
er to April. This=20

monsoon is, in fact, only the regular northeast trade-wind somewhat intensi=
fied.  A similar=20

exchange takes place between Asia and Australia, but it is less marked, owi=
ng, perhaps, to the=20

great islands lying between these continents.  The period of transition of =
the monsoons, in spring=20

and autumn, is marked by sudden and violent gales, and terrific thunder sto=
rms. Destructive=20

hurricanes, also, are of frequent occurrence. This corresponds with the per=
iod of equinoctial=20

storms in higher latitudes.  There are narrow monsoon belts in the Atlantic=
, along the coast of=20

Africa and of Brazil, also on the Pacific coasts of North and South America=
; but the phenomena=20

they exhibit are of a much less striking character. On the African coast, i=
n general, the winds blow=20

from sea to land in summer, from land to sea in winter; on the Brazilian, t=
he wind is from the=20

northeast in summer, while in winter the southeast trade resumes its sway. =
The monsoons of the=20

Pacific coast of America blow from the northwest and north during the south=
ern summer; from the=20

southwest and south during the northern. The regular trade-wind makes itsel=
f so strongly felt in=20

northern Brazil, which is unusually level, that a boat can sail almost as r=
apidly up the swift current=20

of the Amazon as it can row down: and Humboldt records that he found it of =
great strength at the=20

foot of the eastern slope of the Andes.  Another modification of the northe=
ast trade is found in the=20

Etesian winds of Greece and the adjacent archipelago. This is a true interm=
ittent trade, blowing=20

only in the daytime, however, and lasting from July to September. The cool =
air of the peninsula=20

rushes toward the extremely heated regions of the Mediterranean and north A=
frica.  Somewhat=20

similar are the northers, or blizzards, of our Western States. By the laws =
already given, it is seen=20

that northerly winds can prevail in any region only when some region furthe=
r south is unusually=20

heated. Now, the northern portion of America may be roughly compared to a t=
rough. The cold=20

polar current sets to the southward across the continent, and is turned to =
the east by the Rocky=20

Mountain range, giving it a general southeast course. Hence, when the south=
ern summer is in=20

progress, our prevailing winds are from the northwest; and when the heated =
portion of the world is=20

north of the equator, we have the return trade, giving us as our prevailing=
 wind that from the=20

southwest. When our return trade is unusually prolonged, we have a late fal=
l; and if the southern=20

summer is unusually warm, we have the polar current longer than usual, and =
a late spring in=20

consequence. The polar current seldom makes its presence felt beyond the Te=
xan plains; though=20

occasionally it reaches the Mexican plateau, or sweeps across the Gulf to t=
he Antilles.  A similar=20

cold wind from Central France toward the Riviera is locally known as the Mi=
stral. The cold winds=20

from the south, which in crossing the plains of Patagonia, are turned eastw=
ard by the Andes, are=20

called in Uruguay the _pamperos_, as their direction causes the popular bel=
ief that they originate=20

in the pampas, or grassy plains. In Malta the cold wind becomes known as th=
e _gregale_--in the=20

Adriatic sea it is the _tramontana_; in Trieste and Dalmatia it is the _bor=
a_. In New Zealand the=20

corresponding cold blast comes from the south, and is known as the buster. =
When loaded with=20

drifting snow, as in the blizzard of the United States, the cold wind of th=
e Yenisei Valley, in Asia, is=20

locally called the _purga_; in the steppes of Central Asia it is the _bura_=
.  Eastern Asia receives its=20

prevailing cold current from the northwest; while western Asia and Europe r=
eceive their cold wave=20

from the northeast, there being no range of mountains, as in America, to de=
flect the current, as the=20



polar currents are disposed to follow the continents, having their origin i=
n arctic lands; while for a=20

similar reason the return trades reach their extremes on the ocean. Hence, =
lines drawn through=20

the places which possess the same mean annual temperature reach a higher la=
titude at sea than=20

on land.  These are the chief periodical winds of long periods. There is on=
e other class to be=20

noted: the diurnal land and sea breezes. These occur along all coasts, whet=
her in the zone of=20

trades or of variable winds; but the phenomenon is more strongly marked in =
the tropical regions,=20

and in the summer of the temperate latitudes, because of the greater differ=
ence in the temperature=20

of land and sea by day and by night.  During the hottest part of the day th=
e air over the land=20

frequently reaches a temperature of 100=C2=B0 Fahr., and even more, while t=
hat over the sea rarely=20

rises above 80=C2=B0. During the night the land radiates its heat with such=
 rapidity that, towards=20

morning, its atmosphere may be from 10=C2=B0 to 15=C2=B0 colder than that o=
f the sea.  Soon after sunrise,=20

the land being warmer than the sea, a sea breeze sets in, which increases i=
n force until about=20

three o=E2=80=99clock, when the difference of temperature is greatest. It t=
hen gradually diminishes until=20

about sunset, when, the temperature of the land and sea having become equal=
, the atmosphere is=20

at rest, the calm continuing for an hour or more.  Soon the land becomes co=
oler than the sea, and=20

a gentle breeze from the former sets in. It increases in force as the night=
 advances, becoming=20

strongest a little before morning, when the temperature of the land is lowe=
st; after which it rapidly=20

dies away, and is succeeded by a calm, to be soon replaced by the sea breez=
e.  One other=20

species of variable wind is to be noticed: the hot, dry, dust-laden blast f=
rom desert regions. Such=20

occur more or less periodically, and are known by different names in differ=
ent localities.  Tom=20

Moore has told us that =E2=80=9Clove=E2=80=99s witchery=E2=80=9D on the hea=
rt is      =E2=80=9CLike the wind of the south o=E2=80=99er the=20

summer lute blowing,      That hushed all its music, and withered its frame=
.=E2=80=9D  The reference is to=20

the simoom of Syria and Arabia. One who has not experienced this wind can h=
ave little idea of its=20

oppressiveness. Apt to come at any hour during the hottest months of the ye=
ar, with a temperature=20

so great that a piece of silver exposed to it becomes hot enough to blister=
 the flesh, and laden with=20

the impalpable dust of the desert, vegetation is scorched and withered by i=
t, and animals flee from=20

it as from the pestilence. It may last but a short time: it may endure seve=
ral days.  At the first=20

indication of its approach, people flee to their houses; doors and windows =
are shut and every=20

crevice that could allow any dust to enter is tightly stuffed: while the wi=
nd lasts no one ventures=20

out. Such unfortunate animals as happen to be overtaken by it have literall=
y to struggle for their=20

lives. The wind is not steady, but comes in fitful gusts, sometimes differi=
ng as much as 20=C2=B0 in=20

temperature. The streets are deserted; and were they otherwise, a person co=
uld hardly be seen at=20

a few yards distance. Hours pass: that implacable enemy, the dust, sifts in=
 at unknown chinks. By=20

degrees it covers everything. Valuable lace and tapestry are nearly ruined.=
 You put on a skull-cap;=20

yet it penetrates your hair. It finds its way beneath the garments to the s=
kin, producing distressing=20

dryness and roughness. The lips parch and crack. The eyes are red and infla=
med. You drink as if=20

famished, and gasp for breath. You are excessively irritable; you reach the=
 verge of complete=20

nervous prostration. At length the ordeal is over. You creep into the stree=
t, to find your neighbors=20

looking like corpses; some, it may be, actually dead from nervous exhaustio=
n. Dead birds and=20

animals lie on the earth. It is a case of the survival of the fittest. You =
pluck a leaf from a=20

neighboring tree; it crumbles to dust in your grasp.  Such are the effects =
of an unusually protracted=20

wind, even when most favorably situated to encounter it. But if a caravan b=
e overtaken by such in=20



the desert, happy are they who escape. The camels kneel and thrust their  [=
Illustration: THE=20

SIMOOM.]  noses into the sand, against each other, into a pack of goods--an=
ywhere to avoid=20

breathing that poisonous blast. The men throw themselves upon the ground be=
hind the camels,=20

and muffle their heads in their garments. The storm is at hand; perchance a=
ttended by whirling=20

columns of sand. You raise your head: a thick, dun-colored cloud flies at y=
ou; a heat as of red-hot=20

iron, it seems, holds you in its choking grasp. You find your way to your w=
ater bottle, and drink=20

deeply. The lurid sun turns the sweeping columns of sand to pillars of fire=
. Superstitious fear=20

seizes your Arab comrades. Gradually the storm passes on: the men pick them=
selves up and=20

endeavor to shake the irritating dust and sand from out the folds of their =
clothing, and the party=20

resumes its way, happy that they are not numbered among the dead whose bone=
s are bleaching=20

by the way. Tales are not wanting of great caravans completely overwhelmed =
by the sandstorms=20

of the desert.  These storms are met with in their greatest severity in Egy=
pt and Arabia. In Egypt,=20

this wind is called the _Khamsin_, or fifty, referring to the period of fif=
ty days--the latter part of=20

April, May, and early June--when they may be expected. They never blow thro=
ugh the entire=20

season: rarely so long as fifteen days at a time. In Arabia the simoom may =
travel from the center=20

of the peninsula toward any point of the compass; the Khamsin of Egypt blow=
s from the=20

southwest. Winds of the same character cross the Mediterranean. In Spain th=
e wind is known as=20

the _Solano_, or _Levanter_, or _Leveche_: in Sicily and Italy it is the _S=
irocco_. The distressing=20

dryness is somewhat modified by the journey across the Mediterranean. The s=
ame wind in Syria is=20

called _Samiel_; and a similar wind which blows from the Sahara southwest t=
o the Guinea coast is=20

called the _Harmattan_. In California a similar dry hot wind blows from the=
 interior toward the=20

coast, during the hot season, and is called the desert wind. Such occasiona=
l hot blasts are=20

experienced in southeastern Dakota, coming from the =E2=80=9Cbad lands,=E2=
=80=9D or sandy and rocky wastes=20

along the upper Missouri river.  All these periodical or varying winds may =
be very properly, from=20

their time and character, be called the season winds of the earth, as anoth=
er means of distinction=20

from the constant trades: as they in part bring changes of season, and in p=
art are brought that=20

way.  Into the question of climate and seasons one other element enters, of=
 especial importance in=20

regard to those disturbances of the regular winds, which we call storms. Th=
at factor is the quantity=20

of moisture in the atmosphere, and the consequent rainfall or snowfall of a=
 region.=20


_
In this case I ascertained that the young woman had, on the recommendation =
of her former master=20

and mistress, employed a solicitor, who stood very high among the lawyers i=
n that part of the=20

country where he dwelt. He received me courteously, and expressed his willi=
ngness to tell me all=20

about the case. He, however, insisted that the defendant must be a wily ras=
cal, a consummate=20

hypocrite, a mean-spirited fellow, &c. &c. He told me there could not be th=
e shadow or shade of a=20

doubt about the case; and he entered into the matter in the spirit of a par=
tisan imbued with the=20

righteousness of the side he was engaged to fight on.  As to the identity o=
f the person, he thought=20

any defence on that head must break down; for he had obtained, through his =
agents in London, a=20

description of Mr. Delmar, which corresponded exactly to the description gi=
ven him by his=20

"unfortunate client." It is true that the poor girl had not, he said, seen =
the fellow since her=20

misfortune, because she had not the money to pay visits to London; nor, ind=
eed, was her strength=20

sufficient to enable her to make that journey and back without peril to her=
 life. Grief and shame=20

and bitter mortification had held her tongue until the last possible moment=
; and it was only when=20

material evidence of her wrong-doing became palpable to her mistress, that =
she admitted the=20

injury which had been done her. "Why, sir," observed the provincial lawyer,=
 "even after the poor=20

girl's condition had been ascertained, she refused to tell who was the auth=
or of her misery, and=20

clung to the foolish belief that, as he was a perfect gentleman, he would o=
ne day redeem his=20

promise by making her his wife. The way it was found out, sir, was this. Sh=
e went home to be=20

confined. Her mother one night searched her little portmonnaie, and there f=
ound the blackguard's=20

card. So her friends ascertained his name and address."  When I had obtaine=
d these particulars=20

from Selina Wilkins's attorney, it was almost post-time; so I wrote an acco=
unt of my interview with=20

the lawyer as rapidly as I could, and sent it to London to the solicitor fr=
om whom I had received my=20

instructions.  I had an answer by electric telegraph, desiring me to pursue=
 my inquiries, as there=20

could be no doubt the case was one of conspiracy or fraud.  Some of the fur=
ther particulars of this=20

mysterious case had perhaps better be stated in the brief narrative I can f=
urnish of the inquiry=20

before the magistrates.  On the day appointed for the hearing Mr. Delmar ca=
me down from=20

London, attended by his confidential and most respectable solicitor, and by=
 a gentleman of the=20

long robe whose name had figured in a thousand Old-Bailey narratives. The y=
oung woman was=20

examined. Amid tears and sobs and threatened hysterics, she related her sto=
ry. It was to the effect=20

that a gentleman, or "commercial," she styled him, who had visited the town=
 of ----, and stayed five=20

or six times at the hotel where she had been in service, had paid his addre=
sses to her with great=20

ardour, and, under cover of a promise of marriage, effected her ruin. She h=
ad no hesitation in=20

declaring that the defendant was the man. The card on which was printed his=
 name and address=20

was produced in Court. A severe cross-examination by the defendant's counse=
l did nothing to=20

shake these allegations. Although the gentleman had not been many times to =
the hotel in=20

question, he appeared quite familiar with the town, and she had seen him en=
ter a rival hostelry=20

before she knew him as one of her master's guests or customers. The defenda=
nt was sworn. He=20

denied that he had ever seen the young woman before, or that he had been in=
 the town for several=20

years, or that he had ever in his life stayed at the hotel where she had be=
en employed.  The=20

complainant's attorney argued that the case against the defendant was concl=
usive. It did not, he=20

said, admit of a shadow of doubt. He heaped vituperative aspersions upon th=
e head of the=20

defendant, for adding insult to injury by his disreputable defence. The def=
endant's counsel, on the=20



other hand, contended that the evidence of the complainant was incomplete; =
that it was in several=20

respects highly improbable; and that it should not counterbalance the testi=
mony of the most=20

respectable defendant in his own behalf. The learned gentleman called upon =
the magistrates to=20

dismiss the case, and intimated that, if the decision were against his clie=
nt, he should appeal. The=20

magistrates agreed with the complainant's attorney; expressed an opinion th=
at she was a much ill-

used young woman; and said a few things uncomplimentary of the defendant, u=
pon whom they=20

expressed their willingness to do what, by the way, they could not help doi=
ng, I believe--that is,=20

give him an opportunity of appealing against their decision.  It will occur=
 to the reader that there=20

were several means of rebutting some of the special facts upon which the co=
mplainant's case=20

must have rested, as it did rest, although I omit them for the sake of brev=
ity, as they are not=20

necessary to the explanation I have to give of one leading fact.  The reade=
r will wonder how that=20

card of the defendant's fell into the hands of the complainant. I will say =
at once, in order to clear=20

away some mystery, that the young woman herself was no doubt honestly mista=
ken, although=20

somewhat rash in the evidence she gave as to the identity of her undoer.  B=
ut, unless some=20

confederate had given her that would hardly occur: or if they did, there wo=
uld be greater difficulty=20

in ascertaining their approach.  Water, in its vapor state, is but three-fi=
fths the weight of the air,=20

and in consequence rapidly rises. This evaporation, as it is called, goes o=
n at all times: even when=20

the water is frozen. A very thin sheet of ice, hung in the open air, will f=
inally disappear, even=20

though the temperature be always below freezing.  Now, all the phenomena of=
 rain, snow, and=20

hail, that are brought by different seasons, in different climes, depend up=
on a single simple law:=20

that warm air can hold a much greater quantity of vapor than cold air. The =
amount of moisture that=20

may be held in suspension at different temperatures is as follows:    Tempe=
rature     Weight of=20

vapor     Temperature     Weight of vapor     of Air.       in a cubic foot=
       of Air.       in a cubic foot=20

   =E2=80=9C      19.79    =E2=80=9C    =E2=80=9C  This gives a second=20

reason why storms of wind and rain closely follow extremely hot weather.  N=
ow, as the vapor is so=20

much lighter than the air, their mixture must also be lighter. So any unusu=
al amount of moisture is=20

at once detected by the barometer, an instrument for measuring the pressure=
 of the atmosphere. If=20

the air grow moister, and therefore lighter, the barometer falls; a storm i=
s approaching.  Since cold=20

air can retain but little moisture, if a warm moist current be chilled, it =
must lose a part of its vapor,=20

which at once falls to the earth as rain. If the cold be somewhat greater, =
the moisture is=20

crystallized into snow. Greely=E2=80=99s observations at Fort Conger show t=
hat, varied as are the forms of=20

snow crystals, those that fall during any particular storm are invariably o=
f the same types, even=20

though they may be collected from localities widely removed from each other=
. All crystals of snow=20

are hexagonal in plan, but there is much variety in detail. The laws that p=
roduce one variety at one=20

time, and a second at another, are not yet known.  The subject of hail is a=
 peculiarly perplexing=20

one to the meteorologist. Hailstones are more or less spherical in form, an=
d are made of alternate=20

layers of soft opaque ice, and hard clear ice. It is evident that they must=
 acquire this structure by=20

being whirled about between clouds of different temperature and density. So=
me have supposed=20

that they are formed in a whirlwind, whose axis is horizontal, but for the =
present we must be=20

content with Lord Dundreary=E2=80=99s explanation, for =E2=80=9Cit ith one =
of thothe thingth which no fellah can=20



underthtand.=E2=80=9D  Raindrops from a great height are larger than those =
from below, for they increase=20

as they pass through the vapor-masses. As the warmest currents are also the=
 highest, it will at=20

once be understood why warm and tropical rains fall in large drops, while d=
rizzling rains, mists,=20

and fogs are characteristic of cold regions and cold seasons.  The masses o=
f more or less=20

condensed vapor in the upper air currents are what are known as clouds. The=
ir various forms and=20

appearance are shown in the cut on the ---- page.  The _cirrus_ and _cirro-=
cumulus_ clouds are=20

the highest, are mostly in the altitudes of perpetual frost, and are suppos=
ed often to consist of=20

minute ice crystals. In temperate latitudes they are usually formed in, and=
 move with, the upper air=20

current, or return-trade from the tropical regions.  The _cumulus_ clouds a=
re characteristic of the=20

tropics, and of the summer days in middle latitudes, their height depending=
 upon the relative=20

humidity of the air. They are formed by local ascending currents, which car=
ry a large amount of=20

vapor into the cooler upper air. There the vapors are condensed, and are gr=
adually heaped up into=20

those heavy masses of sharply defined clouds, which look like vast snowy mo=
untains. Their base=20

is horizontal, and marks the height at which the dew point is reached and c=
ondensation begins.=20

The accumulation of vapors is often so great that these clouds form a colum=
n several thousand=20

feet high. In this case the difference in the temperature and the electrica=
l conditions of the upper=20

and lower portions is such that electrical discharges take place, accompani=
ed by condensation of=20

a portion of the cloud, forming a thunderstorm.  _Stratus_ clouds are most =
frequently seen in the=20

morning or evening, and are always low. They are formed by the descent of t=
he higher clouds and=20

vapors of midday into the lower air as the temperature decreases. They are =
more frequent in=20

winter and summer than in the intermediate seasons.  The _nimbus_ cloud is =
more dense and=20

heavy than the others, which may all be transformed into the nimbus by  [Il=
lustration: FORMS OF=20

CLOUDS.]  a diminution of temperature. It is of a dark-leaden hue, changing=
 into grey. This is the=20

most common form of cloud in polar latitudes; and, during the cold season, =
it is the most frequent=20

of the temperate zones.  If a moist current cross a mountain range, it lose=
s its moisture in the cold=20

region, and growing narrower as it descends the other slope, presents the p=
henomena of a warm=20

dry wind from the mountains. Thus the wind that brings rain=20


_
obtained it? It must have been palmed off upon her by some unmitigated vill=
ain, who was content=20

to divert inquiry from his own track into that of an innocent and right-min=
ded man's household, to=20

the peril of the destruction of his own and his family's happiness.  To tra=
ck this miscreant was my=20

special mission. I had not much time to effect a discovery before the appea=
l must be heard and=20

decided.  Mr. Delmar could not help me. He had given his card, at various t=
imes, to various=20

people; and within a few years a few hundred persons might have been the co=
nscious or=20

unconscious media, direct or remote, of conveying the fatal pasteboard from=
 his hand to that of the=20

complainant.  After I had been a week engaged in the effort to track the do=
uble culprit--having, let=20

me frankly say, no clue by which I hoped to discover him--I was getting wea=
ry of the task, when a=20

ray of light dawned through the imperfect memory of Mr. Delmar. He recollec=
ted that, about ten=20

months before the complaint was laid against him at ----, he had been oblig=
ed to visit Norwich on=20

urgent business. A man who owed him a considerable sum of money was then in=
 embarrassment,=20

and had called a meeting of his creditors, at which Mr. Delmar was invited =
to attend. After this=20

business had been completed, he intended returning to town by a late train,=
 but allowed himself to=20

be detained in conversation with his fellow-sufferers until it became neces=
sary to abandon that=20

intention. He accordingly put up for the night at the Saracen's Head Hotel,=
 and sought to while=20

away the hours which intervened before bed-time by a social pipe and glass =
in the commercial=20

room. Here he met, as a the same character are the hot winds of Switzerland=
, called Fo=C3=ABhn winds,=20

and the Chinook winds which blow from the eastward into Idaho, Washington, =
and western=20

Montana. Similar winds occur occasionally in South Africa, Australia, New Z=
ealand, and Peru.=20

These hot winds must not be confounded with the hot and poisonous winds fro=
m desert regions=20

described before.  Such, in fine, are the noted varying intermittent, or pe=
riodic winds. However=20

uncertain they may appear at first thought, they are obedient to the same u=
nchanging laws that=20

bind the universe into one harmonious whole. No doubt the ancients, if they=
 had been acquainted=20

with their office, would have personified them as the nymphs of the seasons=
. But, knowing naught=20

of the wonderful immutable laws that bind them, they could only say to each=
,      =E2=80=9CWe know not=20

whence thou com=E2=80=99st, or whither goest,      When round our homes thy=
 wizard blast thou blowest.=E2=80=9D=20

In eternal law and harmony they found only endless confusion and wild capri=
ce. Man interpreted=20

nature by man.  Yet they are the angels of the seasons, these air-spirits, =
sent by an allwise=20

Providence to bring the rain and the snow, and the sunshine and storm in th=
eir season, to give=20

seed to the sower and bread to the eater; that while man shall dwell on ear=
th, seedtime and=20

harvest and summer and winter may not cease. So they wander, clothing the t=
ropics with emerald=20

cloaks of strangest beauty, and robing the poles with ermine and crystal: p=
ainting with rainbow-

tints the autumn leaves, and touching with virgin blush the orchards in spr=
ing; in all things obeying=20

the decree of Him who hath set the seasons in order and made=20


_
greeting and good-fellowship. One man, however, Mr. Delmar became very chat=
ty and familiar=20

with. This man, who told him his business--that is to say, what "line" he w=
as in--in the course of=20

conversation took out his card-case and was about to hand Mr. Delmar his ca=
rd, when=20

unfortunately, as he said, he found that he was out of cards, but he told h=
im his address. Mr.=20

Delmar also took out his card-case, and, very unfortunately indeed, as the =
sequel shows, he gave=20

the commercial his printed name and address.  I was not long in drawing the=
 inference--nor would=20

any person, I apprehend, beautiful in its time.     CHAPTER IV.  TORNADOES =
AND CYCLONES.=20

=E2=80=9CO sad and mournful wind!     From what wild depths of human pain a=
nd sorrow     Could=E2=80=99st thou=20

those tones of restless anguish borrow     As of a soul that dreams of no t=
o-morrow,               O=20

sad and mournful wind!                O, thou art fierce and wild!     Thy =
mighty chariot through the=20

black skies lashing,     The cloud-shapes round the mountain-summits dashin=
g,     The waves of=20

ocean round the wrecked bark crashing--               O, thou art fierce an=
d wild!=E2=80=9D   Men find no=20

difficulty in=20


_
With a photograph of Mr. Delmar in my pocket, I speedily took my ticket for=
 Norwich, and had not=20

much doubt about overtaking the rascal.  Would the reader like to know how =
I got hold of the=20

fellow? It will appear a very simple and easy process when explained, and I=
 don't take much credit=20

for it. Give a shrewd man a clue, and I warrant you, if he have time and op=
portunity, that are of=20

constant or frequent recurrence. That which is most difficult to explain, m=
ay pass without a serious=20

thought so long as it manifests no stupendous or sudden power. The water ma=
y wear away the=20

stone for centuries and its progress be unheeded by those who daily visit t=
he pool.  So all observe=20

and admire the beauty and order that prevails in the system of winds=20


_
Well, then, the way I pursued the clue to its extremity was this. I conclud=
ed at once in my own=20

mind that this man's "proclivities" had been manifested wherever he went, a=
nd that at more than=20

one of the hotels and commercial inns on his road he would have left a clea=
r recollection of his=20

name and line on the retina natural, that people take them as a matter of c=
ourse. Rather, we=20

should say, they may be depended upon with such certainty that the laws whi=
ch they followed=20

were unheeded for more than six thousand years. Relying on result, men gave=
 themselves no=20

concern about principle.  But in the sudden storm, the cyclone or=20


_
I was right. After making myself agreeable by innocent devices with the cha=
mbermaids at the=20

Saracen's Head Hotel, at Norwich, I ventured to let one of them see the pic=
ture of the man I=20

wanted. I saw at a glance that no tender regard for him was felt by this fe=
male observer. I noticed=20

something like pique, or it might be disgust for him. This was enough for m=
e. I frankly land with=20

hardly any warning, flooding and destroying, men find mystery.  And who is =
not justly awed=20

thereby? What other power so easily and frequently wrecks and ravages? Who =
may point out its=20

course or stay its progress?  And indeed it would seem difficult at first t=
o find any law or system=20

that controls the motion of the storm. If a rain storm always came from the=
 same=20
