Ismael Pasha. In the dead of night, while he slept, the crackling of fire w=
as heard, and flames burst=20

out upon all sides of the dry and combustible fodder; the Arabs had fired t=
he straw in all directions,=20

and a roar of flame in a fatal ring surrounded the Pasha's tent, which caug=
ht the fire. There was no=20

escape! In the confusion, the Arabs fell upon the troops, and massacred a c=
onsiderable number.=20

After this success, Mek Nimmur succeeded in retiring with his people and he=
rds to Sofi, on the=20

Atbara, to which place we were bound; this was about twelve miles from Toma=
t. The body of=20

Ismael Pasha was found beneath those of some of his women, all of whom that=
 were within the=20

inclosure having perished.  After this calamity the Egyptians recovered She=
ndy, and in revenge=20

they collected a number of the inhabitants of all ages and both sexes. Thes=
e were penned=20

together like cattle in a zareeba or phrases he heard, the new fashions ali=
ke in dress and manner.=20

He could not believe it was the same world that he had quitted only a year =
ago. He was glad to=20

take refuge with Hugo Bohun as with an old friend, and could not refrain fr=
om expressing to that=20

eminent person his surprise at the novelty of all around him.  =E2=80=9CIt =
is you, my dear Lothair,=E2=80=9D replied=20

Hugo, =E2=80=9Cthat is surprising, not the world=E2=80=94that has only deve=
loped in your absence. What could=20

have induced a man like you to be away for a whole season from the scene? O=
ur forefathers=20

might afford to travel=E2=80=94the world was then stereotyped. It will not =
do to be out of sight now. It is=20

very well for St. Aldegonde to do these things, for the great object of St.=
 Aldegonde is not to be in=20

society, and he has never succeeded in his object. But here is the new beau=

and a sensation. Men made way, and even women retreated=E2=80=94and,=20

was fired in a similar manner to that which destroyed the Pasha. Thus were =
these unfortunate=20

creatures destroyed en masse, while the remaining portion of the population=
 fled to the new=20

settlement of their chief at Sofi.  Within the last few years preceding my =
costume that happily=20

displayed her splendid figure, and, radiant with many charms, swept by a la=
dy of commanding=20

mien and stature, self-possessed, and even grave, when, suddenly turning he=

face broke into enchanting dimples, as she exclaimed: =E2=80=9COh,=20
