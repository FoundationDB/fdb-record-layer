233 See _Preface to St. Matthew's Gospel_, Baronius, i. 752, quoted in       De Mirville, vi. 63. 

Jerome is the Father who having found the       authentic and original _Evangel_ (the Hebrew 

text), by Matthew the       Apostle-publican, in the library of Caesarea, "_written by the hand_ 

of Matthew" (Hieronymus: _De Viris_, Illust. Chap. iii.)--as he       himself admits--set it down as 

heretical, and substituted for it his       own Greek text. And it is also he who perverted the text in 

the       _Book of Job_ to enforce belief in the resurrection in flesh (see       _Isis Unveiled_, Vol. ii. 

pp. 181 and 182, _et seq._), quoting in       support the most learned authorities.    234 De Mirville 

gives the following thrilling account of the "contest."        "John, pressed, as St. Jerome tells us, by 

all the churches of Asia       to proclaim more solemnly [in the face of the miracles of 

Apollonius] the divinity of Jesus Christ, after a long prayer with       his disciples on the Mount of 

Patmos and being in ecstasy by the       divine Spirit, made heard amid thunder and lightning his 

famous _In       Principio erat Verbum_. When that sublime extasis, that caused him       to be 

named the 'Son of Thunder,' had passed, Apollonius was       compelled to retire and to disappear. 

Such was his defeat, less       bloody but as hard as that of Simon, the Magician." ("The Magician 

Theurgist," vi. 63) For our part we have never heard of extasis       producing thunder and lightning 

and we are at a loss to understand       the meaning.    235 This is the old, old story. Who of us, 

Theosophists, but knows by       bitter personal experience what clerical hatred, malice and 

persecution can do in this direction; to what an extent of       falsehood, calumny and cruelty these 

feelings can go, even in our       modern day, and what exemplars of _Christ-like_ charity His 

alleged       and self-constituted servants have shown themselves to be!    236 _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 

342.    237 _Loc. cit._, ii. 343, 344.    238 _Pneumatologie_, vi. 62.    239 _Les Apologistes 

Chretiens au Second Siecle_, p. 106.    240 _Pneumatologie_, vi, 62.    241 Many are they who 

_do not know_: hence, they do not believe in them.    242 Just so. Apollonius, during a lecture he 

was delivering at Ephesus       before an audience of many thousands, perceived the murder of 

the       Emperor Domitian in Rome and notified it at the very moment it was       taking place, to 

the whole town; and Swedenborg, in the same manner,       saw from Gothenburg the great fire at 

Stockholm and told it to his       friends, no telegraph being in use in those days.    243 No criterion 

at all. The Hindu Saddhus and Adepts acquire the gift       by the holiness of their lives. The Yoga-

Vidya teaches it, and no       "spirits" are required.    244 As to the Pontiffs, the matter is rather 

doubtful.    245 But this alone is no reason why people should believe in this class       of spirits. 

There are better authorities for such belief.    246 De Mirville's aim is to show that all such 

apparitions of the Manes       or disembodied Spirits are the work of the Devil, "Satan's 

simulacra."    247 He might have added: like the great Shankaracharya, Tsong-Kha-Pa,       and so 

many other real Adepts--even his own Master, Jesus; for this       is indeed a criterion of true 

Adeptship, though "to disappear" one       need not fly up in the clouds.    248 See _Dion you we 

shall not leave this without robbing you of it."  "Not without my defending it," said Groslow.  "So 

much the better," said D'Artagnan. "Fight, my dear captain, fight. You know or you don't know, that 

that is what we ask of you."  "Oh! yes," said Groslow, bursting with his usual coarse laugh, "I know 

you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises."  Charles had heard and understood it all. A 

slight color mounted to his cheeks. The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs, little by little, and 

under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him.  Athos and Aramis 



started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on.  The game began. The luck 

had turned, and Groslow, having won some hundred pistoles, was in the merriest possible humor. 

Porthos, who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides, was 

very cross and questioned D'Artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be 

time to change the game. Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly. But D'Artagnan remained 

impassible.  It struck ten. They heard the guard going its rounds.  "How many rounds do they 

make a night?" asked D'Artagnan, drawing more pistoles from his pocket.  "Five," answered 

Groslow, "one every two hours."  D'Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time 

replied to Porthos's nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive. Meanwhile, the soldiers whose duty 

it was to remain in the king's room, attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men, had stolen 

little by little toward the table, and standing on tiptoe, lounged, watching the game, over the 

shoulders of D'Artagnan and Porthos. Those on the other side had followed their example, thus 

favoring the views of the four friends, who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them 

about the chamber. The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed, but they were 

leaning on them while they watched the game.  Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment 

approached. With his white, aristocratic hands he played with the louis, bending and straightening 

them again, as if they were made of pewter. Aramis, less self-controlled, fumbled continually with 

his hidden poniard. Porthos, impatient at his continued losses, kept up a vigorous play with his 

knee.  D'Artagnan turned, mechanically looking behind him, and between the figures of two 

soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped 

and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God.  D'Artagnan saw that the moment was come. He 

darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis, who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as 

to leave themselves more space for action. He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and 

Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword 

could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard.  "Hang it!" cried D'Artagnan, "another twenty pistoles 

lost. Really, Captain Groslow, you are too much in fortune's way. This can't last," and he drew 

another twenty from his pocket. "One more turn, captain; twenty pistoles on one throw--only one, 

the last."  "Done for twenty," replied Groslow.  And he turned up two cards as usual, a king for 

D'Artagnan and an ace for himself.  "A king," said D'Artagnan; "it's a good omen, Master Groslow--

look out for the king."  And in spite of his extraordinary self-control there was a strange vibration in 

the Gascon's voice which made his partner start.  Groslow began turning the cards one

249 Lampridius, _Adrian_, xxix. 2.    250 The passage runs as follows: "Aurelian had determined 

to destroy       Tyana, and the town owed its salvation only to a miracle of       Apollonius; this man 

so famous and so wise, this great friend of the       Gods, appeared ace first he won; if a king he 

lost.  He turned up a king.  "At last!" cried D'Artagnan.  At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up. 

Porthos drew back a step. Daggers and swords were just about to shine, when suddenly the door 

was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the 


_
his tent, in his own figure and form, and said to him in the       Pannonian language: 'Aurelian, if 

thou wouldst conquer, abandon       these evil designs against my fellow-citizens: if thou wouldst 

command, abstain from shedding innocent blood; and if thou wouldst       live, abstain from 

injustice.' Aurelian, familiar with the face of       Apollonius, whose portraits he had seen in many 

temples, struck enveloped in a large cloak. Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets 

of half a dozen soldiers.  Groslow jumped up, ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine, 

cards, and dice. But Harrison paid not the least attention to him, and entering the king's room, 

followed by his companion:  "Charles Stuart," said he, "an order has come to conduct you to 

London without stopping day or night. Prepare yourself,

wonder, immediately vowed to him (Apollonius) statue, portrait and       temple, and returned 

completely to ideas of mercy." And then       Vopiscus adds: "If I have believed more and more in 

the virtues of       the _majestic_ Apollonius, it is because, after gathering my       information from 

the most serious men, I have found all these facts       corroborated in the once."  "And by whom is 

this order given?" asked the king.  "By General Oliver Cromwell. And here is Mr. Mordaunt, who 

has brought it and is charged with its execution."  "Mordaunt!" muttered the four friends, 

exchanging glances.  D'Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in 

his huge pocket. Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him. At this
