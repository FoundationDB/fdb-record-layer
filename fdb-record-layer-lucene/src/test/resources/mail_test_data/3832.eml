philodendron monstera place like it in the whole world?

been a fat old lady for anything he knew!" replied Mrs. Beverley, settling herself on the mattress 

below.  It was a funny sensation to lie in bed in the jolting train, and Irene slept only in snatches, 

waking frequently to hear clanking of chains, shrieking of engines, shouting of officials at stations, 

and other disturbing noises. As dawn came creeping through the darkness she drew the curtain 

aside and looked from the window. What a glorious sight met her astonished gaze! They were 

passing over the Alps, and all around were immense snow-covered mountains, great gorges full of 

dark fir forests, and rushing streams of green glacier water. It was very cold, and she was glad to 

pull her rug up, and later to drink the hot coffee which the _conducteur_ made on a spirit-lamp in 

the corridor and brought to those who had ordered it overnight.  Irene never forgot that long 

journey on the Continental express. The sleeping compartments became sitting-rooms by day, for 

the berths turned into sofas, and a table was unfolded, where it would have been possible to write 

or sew if she had wished. She could do nothing, however, but stare at the landscape; the snow-

capped mountains and the great ravines             A merciful death on the nearer shore?_         * 

*       *       *       *  THE NEW "WHITE HOPE."      "'I passed through several drawing-rooms,' she 

says. 'I saw     ladies who were so shy that they couldn't utter a word before     me, but who 

suddenly put a ribbon round my wrist to measure     it'--you know, of course, by reputation 

Polaire's 15-inch     wrist."--_Sunday Chronicle._  If the biceps is in proportion, Bandsman BLAKE 

should tremble.         *       *       *       *       *  AT THE PLAY.  "The Darling of the Gods."  Though 

the Gallery, on the night when I attended, received it with rapt interest rather than delirious 

enthusiasm, _The Darling of the Gods_ promises once more to justify its title. The play has 

undergone very little modification since it was produced a decade ago. It remains pure melodrama 

incidentally set in a Japanese dress, and sprinkled with a few Japanese words. Here and there it 

may reproduce the Japanese attitude of mind, as distinct from details of custom, but the general 

spirit of it follows the traditional Anglo-Saxon lines. Anybody who knows no more of Japan than 

may be gathered from the pages of LAFCADIO HEARN will at least have

and gorges were a revelation in the way of scenery, and it was enough occupation to look out of 

the window. Switzerland and Northern Italy were a dream of wild, rugged beauty, but she woke on 

the following morning to find the train racing among olive groves and orange trees, and to catch 

glimpses of gay, unknown, wild flowers blooming on the railway banks. Here and there were 

stretches of the blue Mediterranean; and oxen and goats in the fields gave a vivid foreign aspect 

of an ordinary English novel as an indecency; and so will recognise the improbability of the 

romantic element in the play. Still, all that is of little consequence, for there must have been very 

few who went to His Majesty's to improve their acquaintance with comparative ethnology.  The 

play has pleasant things for the eye; and one of the best of them was the face of Mr. GEORGE 

RELPH as _Kara_, leader of the Samurai. But there were horrors, too; notably the senile

country. Everything--trees, houses, landscape, and people--seemed unfamiliar and un-English, yet 

strangely fascinating. The bright land with its sunshine appeared to be welcoming her.  "I shall like 

it! I shall like it! I shall like it!" said Irene to herself, hanging out of the open window of their 

compartment and watching some picturesque children who were waving a greeting to the train. "I 

_know_ I shall like it!"  "Put your hat the offensive little figure of _It_, his shadow--an interpolation 

in the bill of fare. A properly qualified dwarf I might have welcomed; but this precocious babe with 

the false moustache and the sham bald crown and the cynical giggle, who ought to have been in 

the nursery instead of serving his master with liquid stimulants and assisting in all sorts of 

wickedness, was a peculiarly nauseating object, and got on my nerves far more

the corridor outside. "Everybody else has luggage ready, and in another ten minutes or so we 

shall be in Rome."     CHAPTER II  The Villa Camellia   The Beverleys did not break their journey 

in Rome, but merely changed trains and pushed on southward. Irene was sorry at the time not to 

see the imperial city, but afterwards she was glad that her first impression of an Italian town should 

have been done off, and indeed most of the bloody work was carried on out of sight--a curious 

economy in a play where there was so much talk of lethal tools. It is true that an arrow once 

flopped on to the stage, but it only brought a note from a friend's hand. Swords, too, were now and 

then raised to strike, but were always arrested in mid-air. Even in the last stand of the Samurai,
