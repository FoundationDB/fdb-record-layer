John A. Simms, Editor Titusville, Florida September 25, 1936  TITUS I. BYNE=
S   Titus B. [TR:=20

Titus I. above] Bynes, affectionately known as "Daddy Bynes", is reminiscen=
t of Harriet Beecher=20

Stowe's immortal "Uncle Tom" and Joel Chandler Harris' inimitable 'Uncle Re=
mus' with his white=20

beard and hair surrounding a smiling black face. He was born in November 18=
46 in what is now=20

Clarendon County, South Carolina. Both his father, Cuffy, and mother, Diana=
, belonged to Gabriel=20

Flowden who owned 75 or 80 slaves and was noted for his kindness to them.  =
Bynes' father was a=20

common laborer, and his mother acted in the capacity of chambermaid and spi=
nner. They had 12=20

children, seven boys--Abraham, Tutus[TR:?], Reese, Lawrence, Thomas, Billie=
, and Hamlet--and=20

five girls--Charity, Chrissy, Fannie, Charlotte, and Violet.  When Titus wa=
s five or six years of age=20

he was given to Flowden's wife who groomed him for the job of houseboy. Alt=
hough he never=20

received any education, Bynes was quick to learn. He could tell the time of=
 day and could=20

distinguish one newspaper from another. He recalled an incident which happe=
ned when he was=20

about eight years of age which led him to conceal his precociousness. One d=
ay while writing on=20

the ground, he heard Trajan and the Antonines was distinctly republican nor=
 did Sultanism finally=20

establish itself before Diocletian. Perhaps we may number among the proofs =
of the Roman's=20

superiority the capacity shown so far as we know first by him of being touc=
hed by the ruin of a=20

rival. We may be sure that no Assyrian conqueror even affected to weep over=
 the fall of a hostile=20

city however magnificent and historic. On the whole it must be allowed that=
 physical influences=20

have seldom done better for humanity than they did in shaping the imperial =
character and=20

destinies of Rome.     THE GREATNESS OF ENGLAND  [Footnote: The writer some=
 time ago=20

gave a lecture before the Royal Institution on "The Influence of Geographic=
al Circumstances on=20

Political Character," using Rome and England as illustrations. It may perha=
ps be right to say that=20

the present paper, which touches here and there on matters of political opi=
nion, is not identical=20

with the latter portion of that lecture.]   Two large islands lie close to =
that Continent which has=20

hitherto been selected by Nature as the chief seat of civilization. One isl=
and is much larger than=20

the other, and the larger island lies between the smaller and the Continent=
. The larger island is so=20

placed as to receive=20

about water. Mistress Flowden called him and told him that if he were caugh=
t writing again his right=20

arm would be cut off. From then on his precociousness vanished. In regards =
to religion, Bynes can=20

recall the Sunday services very vividly; and he tells how the Negroes who w=
ere seated in the=20

gallery first heard a sermon by the white minister and immigration from thr=
ee quarters--from=20

France, from the coast of Northern Germany and the Low Countries, and from =
Scandinavia, the=20

inds and by the little=20

maeval navigator, into=20
