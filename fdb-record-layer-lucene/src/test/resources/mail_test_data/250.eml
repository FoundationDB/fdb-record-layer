[65] It will be understood that these sureties have their share in the adva=

Spanish writers: see Zuniga's History, Morillo [i.e., Murillo Velarde], and=
 others. Le Gentil (who=20

names his informants, men of the first respectability), La Peyrouse, &c. Ma=
ny public papers of the=20

government bear witness to these abuses.  "El Alcalde de aqui Seor! (said a=

out of your worship's mouth." This was not too strong an expression.  [68] =
They are well aware of=20

the extent of their influence, and even at times speak of it. "Si aqui mand=

forests. But if I shut the church doors, I shall have them all at my feet i=

the remark of an intelligent "frayle" to the writer.  [69] Le Gentil says (=
Voyage, ii, p. 2): "Every order=20

of religious has, then, taken possession of these provinces, which they hav=
e, so to say, shared=20

among themselves. In some sort, they command therein, and they are more kin=
gs than the king=20

himself. They have been so shrewd as to learn the dialects of the various p=
eoples among whom=20

they reside, and not to teach the Castilian language to them; thus the reli=

masters over the minds of the Indians in these islands."--Eds.  [70] Those =

found several fish-hooks of a most peculiar shape, and made out of a curiou=
s material.  In shape=20

they were like a circular key-ring, with a segment of exactly one-third cut=
 out.  One end was=20

ground sharp, and to the other was attached the line, cleverly spun from th=
e tea-tree bark.  Now,=20

of all shapes to drive a Limerick hook-maker to despair, none, one would th=
ink, could have been=20

invented better than this, for the odds are certainly ten to one against it=
s penetrating any portion of=20

a fish, even though he should have gorged it.  The material of which these =
quaint hooks are made=20

is tortoise or turtle shell, for both tortoises and turtles abound on this =
coast, the former frequenting=20

the fresh-water creeks and lagoons, and the latter the sea.  Whether they w=
ere cut out of the solid,=20

or whether a strip was soaked, bent, and then dried in the sun until it bec=
ame firmly set in the=20

required shape, I never could ascertain, but most probably the former plan =
was adopted.  The=20

whole island seemed to teem with game, and had we been able to fire, we sho=

made a good bag, but this we dared not do, so I made a mental resolve to re=
turn at some future=20

time and make amends for this enforced restraint.  At nearly every step, we=
 put up some bird or=20

beast strange to European eyes.  I have no doubt it is known to most of my =
readers that Australia=20

is destitute of 'Ferae' proper, and that elephants, lions, tigers, etc., ar=
e unknown.  They will also=20

know that the kangaroos are marsupial animals; that is to say, the females =
have a peculiar pouch=20

 of other animals.  But=20
