philodendron monstera to Paris and tempted us to go to Italy. It was a grea=

day, and our heavy clothes--two Red Cross uniforms and a pea-green the sava=

of Esmeralda, but they told us of the danger incurred when the fruit ripens=
 and falls from a height of fifty or sixty feet. The triangular seeds of th=

 tempted us to go to Italy. It was a great temptation; "beyond the Alps lie=

CHAPTER VI  WHEREIN WE BECOME A TRIO AND JOURNEY TO ITALY   As the autumn=
=20

deepened we found our Red Cross work ending. This work had taken Henry and =
me from our=20

quiet country newspaper offices in Kansas and had suddenly plunged us into =
the turmoil of the big=20

war. For days and days we had been riding in motor cars along the line in F=
rance from Rouen to=20

Bacarat and often ambulances had hauled us--always more or less frightened-=
-up near the=20

trenches of the front line. We had tramped has been made to propagate the a=
lmendrones in the=20

settlements of the Upper Orinoco. To this the indolence of the inhabitants =
is a greater obstacle=20

than the rapidity with which the oil becomes rancid in the amygdaliform see=
ds. We found only=20

three trees of the kind at the mission of San Carlos, and two at Esmeralda.=
 These majestic trees=20

were eight or ten years old, and had not yet borne flowers.  As early as th=
e sixteenth century, the=20

seeds with ligneous and triangular teguments (but not the great drupe like =
a cocoa-nut, which=20

contains the almonds,) were known in Europe. I recognise them in an imperfe=
ct engraving of=20

Clusius.* (* Clusius distinguishes very properly the=20


_
snuggled eagerly into the little dugouts and caves that made the first aid =
posts. We had learned=20

many new and curious things--most of which were rather useless in publishin=
g the Wichita Beacon=20

or the Emporia Gazette; as, for instance, how to wear a gas mask, how to fi=
re a trench mortar,=20

how to look through a trench periscope, and how to duck (fructus amygdalae-=
nucleo, triangularis,=20

dorso lato, in bina latera angulosa desinente, rugosus, paululum cuneiformi=
s) from the pekea, or=20

Amygdala guayanica. Raleigh, who knew none of the productions of the Upper =
Orinoco, does not=20

speak of the juvia; but it appears that he first brought to Europe the frui=
t of the mauritia palm, of=20

which we=20


_
to a serial love affair that began on the boat coming over and was for ever=
 being "continued in our=20

next." And it was all--riding along the line, huddling in abris, sneaking s=
cared to death along=20

trenches, and ducking from the shells--all vastly diverting. We had grown f=
at on it; not that we=20

needed just that expression of felicity, having four hundred pounds between=
 us. But it was almost=20

finished and we were sadly turning our faces westward to our normal and rea=
sonably honest lives=20

at palmae-pini.) This botanist designates them under the name of almendras =
del Peru. They had=20

no doubt been carried, as a very rare fruit, to the Upper Maranon, and then=
ce, by the Cordilleras,=20

to Quito and Peru. The Novus Orbis of Laet, in which I found the first acco=
unt of the cow-tree,=20

furnishes also a description and a figure singularly exact of the fruit of =
the bertholletia. Laet calls=20

the tree totocke, and mentions the drupe of the size of the human head, whi=
ch contains the=20

almonds.=20
