instead. Look! Isn't it dinky?" protested Irene, proudly exhibiting her newly purchased treasure. "It

savannahs south of Guayaval. Enormous bats, no doubt of the tribe of Phyllostomas, hovered as 

usual over our hammocks during a great part of the night. Every moment they seemed to be about 

to fasten on our faces. Early in the morning we pursued our way over low grounds, often 

inundated. In the season of

"Tin trumpet, Mums darling? Oh! You've given me such an idea," purred Irene, running to Michael 

Foard and whispering some communication into his sympathetic ear, which caused him to walk 

back to a certain street stall and purchase nine tin whistles, with which the younger members of 

the party armed themselves and immediately began a desperate attempt to reproduce "The 

Bluebells of Scotland," hugely to the entertainment of the natives, who flocked to their doors all 

smiles and amused exclamations.  "Bairns! I think shame of you," declared Mrs. Cameron. "They'll 

take us for a wandering circus. Put those unmusical instruments in your pockets till we're clear of 

the town. I never heard a poor Scottish air so mangled. You may practice your band on the hills 

and scare the goats. Don't play it in my ears again till you catch the proper tune."  The musicians, 

after their first burst of enthusiasm was expended, were glad to save their breath for the climb. the 

Guarico and the Apure. We arrived on the 27th of March at the Villa de San Fernando, the capital 

of the Mission of the Capuchins in the province of Varinas. This was the termination of our journey 

over the Llanos; for we passed the three months of April, May, and June on the rivers.   CHAPTER 

2.18.  SAN FERNANDO DE APURE. INTERTWININGS AND BIFURCATIONS OF THE RIVERS 

APURE AND ARAUCA. NAVIGATION ON THE RIO APURE.  Till the second half of the 

eighteenth century the names of the great rivers Apure, Arauca, and Meta were scarcely known in 

Europe: certainly less than they had been in the two preceding centuries, when the valiant Felipe 

de Urre and the conquerors of Tocuyo traversed the Llanos, to seek, beyond the Apure, the great 

legendary city of El Dorado, and the rich country of the Omeguas, the Timbuctoo of the New 

Continent. Such daring expeditions could not be carried out without all the apparatus of war; and 

the weapons, which had been destined

their way wound between high walls, up, up, up, along a paved pathway among orange groves, till 

at last the allotments disappeared, and they were on the open hillside, among the low shrubs and 

the rough grass and the beautiful flowers. Irene, running up a bank in quest of bee-orchises, broke 

her new cane into four pieces, but was somewhat consoled by a stick which Michael cut her from 

a chestnut tree.  "It hasn't a knob to suck," he laughed, "but I'll tie a stick of peppermint on to the 

end of it if you like."  "Don't tease me, or I'll throw a squashy orange at you."  "I thought you were 

fond of peppermint."  "So I am, and if there's another of those creamy Neapolitans left in your 

pocket I'll accept it and forgive you."  "Right you are, O Queen! There are two here. Does your 

Majesty prefer a purple paper or a green?"  The ruins, which formed the goal of their expedition, 

were the remains of a once splendid villa erected by the Emperor Tiberius, and used constantly by 

him until his death in A.D. 37. Most of the party were disappointed to find them, as Peachy 

expressed it, "so very ruiny." It was difficult to picture what the original palace must have been like, 

for nothing was left of all the grandeur but crumbling walls, over which Nature had scattered ferns 

and flowers. At the very top some of the old masonry had been used to build a tiny church; this 

was closed, but, peeping through the grille in the door, the visitors could catch glimpses of blue-

painted roof and of little model ships, placed as votive offerings by the sailors in gratitude for 

preservation from danger at sea. Outside this chapel was a great stone monument built so near 

the edge of the cliff that, when sitting on its steps, one could look down a sheer drop of several 

hundred feet into the blue waters below. The view from here was magnificent, and as the Clan, in 

turns, scanned the neighboring coast of Italy with field glasses, they believed they could even 

distinguish the Greek temples at Paestum. The girls described the glorious excursion they had 

taken there from school.  "You were lucky to be able to go all the way by char-a-banc," 

commented Mrs. Cameron. "Dad and I went there on our honeymoon, years and years ago, and 

traveled all the way from Naples by a terrible little jolting train that carried cattle-trucks and 

luggage-trucks as well as passenger carriages. I shan't ever forget that journey. We had to leave 

the station at 6.30 and when we came downstairs we found it was a pouring wet day. It was only 

the fact that the sleepy looking waiter at our hotel must have roused himself at 5 A.M. to prepare 

our coffee, and that we did not like to ask him to do it again another morning, that forced us to set 

off in the rain. I never felt so disinclined for an excursion in my life. Dad said afterwards if I'd given 

him the least hint he'd have joyfully relinquished it, but each thought the other wanted to go, so off 

we set. All the way to Cava it simply streamed, and we sat in our corners of the carriage secretly 

calling ourselves idiots, the defence of the new colonists, were employed without intermission 

against the unhappy natives. When more peaceful times succeeded to those of violence and 

public calamity, two powerful Indian tribes, the Cabres and the Caribs of the Orinoco, made 

themselves masters of the country which the Conquistadores had ceased to ravage. None but 

poor monks were then permitted to advance to the south of the steppes. Beyond the Uritucu an 

unknown world opened to the Spanish colonists; and the descendants of those intrepid warriors 

who had extended their conquests from Peru to the coasts of New Grenada and the mouth of the 

Amazon, knew not the roads that lead from Coro to the Rio Meta. The shore of Venezuela 

remained a separate country; and the slow conquests of the Jesuit missionaries were successful 

only by skirting the banks of the Orinoco. These fathers had already penetrated beyond the great 

cataracts of Atures and Maypures, when the Andalusian Capuchins had scarcely reached the 



plains of Calabozo, from the coast and the valleys of Aragua. It would be difficult to explain these 

contrasts by the system according to which the different monastic orders are governed; for the 

aspect of the country contributes powerfully to the more or less rapid progress of the Missions. 

They extend but slowly into the interior of the land, over mountains, or in steppes, wherever they 

do not follow the course of a particular river. It will scarcely be believed, that the Villa de Fernando 

de Apure, only fifty leagues distant in a direct line from that part of the coast of Caracas which has 

been longest inhabited, was founded at no earlier a date than 1789. We were shown a parchment, 

full of fine paintings, containing the privileges of this little town. The parchment was sent from 

Madrid at the solicitation of the monks, whilst yet only a few huts of reeds were to be seen around 

a great cross raised in the centre of the hamlet. The missionaries and the secular governments 

being alike interested in exaggerating in Europe what they have done to augment the culture and 

population of the provinces beyond the sea, it often happens that names of towns and villages are 

placed on the list of new conquests, long before their foundation.  The situation of San Fernando, 

on a large navigable river, near the mouth of another river which traverses the whole province of 

Varinas, is extremely advantageous for trade. Every production of that province, hides, cacao, 

cotton, and the indigo of Mijagual, which is of the first quality, passes through this town towards 

the mouths of the Orinoco. During the season of rains large vessels go from Angostura as far as 

San Fernando de Apure, and by the Rio Santo Domingo as far as Torunos, the port of the town of 

Varinas. At that period the inundations of the rivers, which form a labyrinth of branches between 

the Apure, the Arauca, the Capanaparo, and the Sinaruco, cover a country of nearly four hundred 

square leagues. At this point, the Orinoco, turned aside from its course, not by neighbouring 

mountains, but by

how we were going to look over temples in a deluge. But our heroism was rewarded, for just as 

the train crossed the brigand's marsh the rain stopped and the sun shone out, and the effect of 

blue sky and clouds was simply glorious. We had a great joke at Paestum. A mosquito had stung 

me badly on one lid so that I looked as if I had a black eye. It was most uncomfortable and painful, 

I remember. Well, a party of French tourists were going round the temples, and as they passed us 

they glanced at my eye and then at Daddy--a husband of three weeks' standing--and they 

murmured something to one another. I couldn't catch their words, but quite plainly they were 

saying: 'Oh, these dreadful English! He's evidently given her a black eye, poor thing! That's how 

they treat their wives!'  "The French people went on to the second temple, and Dad and I sat down 

to eat our lunch. We were fearfully annoyed by dogs that sat in front of us and watched every 

mouthful, and barked incessantly. (Did they trouble you too! How funny! They must surely be the 

descendants of our dogs who've inherited a bad habit.) Dad got so utterly exasperated that he 

said he must and would get rid of them, so he seized my umbrella, shook it furiously at them and 

yelled out '_Va via_' in the most awful and blood-curdling voice he could command. Just at that 

moment the French tourists came back round eastward instead of following its previous direction 

in the line of the meridian. Considering the surface of the globe as a polyhedron, formed of planes 

variously inclined, we may conceive by the mere inspection of the maps, that the intersection of 

these slopes, rising towards the north, the west, and south,* between San Fernando de Apure, 

Caycara, and the mouth of the Meta, must cause a considerable depression. (* The risings 

towards the north and west are connected with two lines of ridges, the mountains of Villa de Cura 

and of Merida. The third slope, running from north to south, is that of the land-strait between the 

Andes and the chain of Parime. It determines the general inclination of the Orinoco, from the 

mouth of the Guaviare to that of the Apure.) The savannahs in this basin are covered with twelve 

or fourteen feet of water, and present, at the period of rains, the aspect of a great lake. The farms 

and villages which seem as if situated on shoals, scarcely rise two or three feet above the surface 

of the water. Everything here calls to mind the inundations of Lower Egypt, and the lake of 

Xarayes, heretofore so celebrated among geographers, though it exists only during some months 

of the year. The swellings of the rivers Apure, Meta, and Orinoco, are also periodical. In the rainy 

season, the horses that wander in the savannah, and have not time to

nods of comprehension, as if they were saying, 'There! Didn't I tell you so! See what a brute he 

really is,' and they cast the most sympathetic glances at me as they filed by. Isn't that true, 

Daddy?"  Mr. Cameron lazily removed his cigarette.  "It's a stock story, my dear, that you've told 

against me for the last twenty years. I won't say hundreds. The mares are seen, followed by their 

colts,* swimming during a part of the day to feed upon the grass, the tops of which alone wave 

above the waters. (The colts are drowned everywhere in large numbers, because they are sooner 

tired of swimming, and strive to follow the mares in places where the latter alone can touch the 

ground.)
