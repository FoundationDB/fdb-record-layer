 "How do you know?  Hang it!  A worm is always turning.  There's no telling=

was the only occasion when the "upper ten" felt that they could mix with th=
e other "hundreds"=20

without any letting-down of the bars.  The ultra-fashionable rarely attende=
d the church gatherings.=20

But this was a special occasion.  A new pastor was to be introduced.  So, p=
rompted by curiosity=20

and a desire to make a good impression on the future custodian of their mor=
als, the smart set=20

attended in full force.  Skinner knew every one of the smart set by sight. =
 But the smart set did n't=20

know Skinner, for he was only a clerk, and no clerk ever had individuality =
enough to stamp himself=20

on the memory of a plutocrat.  There were a large number of clerks present,=
 fellow commuters,=20

and Skinner noticed with some embarrassment that a considerable number of t=
hese gentlemen=20

were not in evening dress.  As like attracts like,--on the same principle t=
hat laborers in a car=20

foregather with other laborers,--so Skinner began to foregather with the dr=
ess-suit contingent.=20

Their clothes attracted his clothes.  He felt that he belonged with them.  =
Furthermore, he had a=20

painful consciousness of being conspicuous among the underdressed men.  He =
also wished to=20

escape a certain envy which he sensed in a few of his fellow clerks, becaus=
e of his dress suit.=20

While this was a novel sensation to Skinner--the walk-in-the-slush, sit-in-=
the-corner, watch-the-

other-fellow-dance, male-wallflower proposition--he did n't like it, for he=
 was a kind-hearted man,=20

always considerate of the feelings of others.  And for the moment it threat=
ened to check the=20

pleasure he was beginning to take in his new clothes.  As Skinner aligned h=
imself with the dress-

suit contingent, he realized that many of these were clerks who had risen i=
n the world and owned=20

their own machines, while the under-dressed men still belonged to the bicyc=
le club.  Many of the=20

newly rich men were old acquaintances of Skinner's who had passed him, left=
 him behind, as it=20

were, years before.  To these, his dress suit was a kind of new introductio=
n.  They seemed=20

pleased to see him.  They clapped him on the shoulder.  It struck his sense=
 of humor that they=20

were like old friends who had preceded him to heaven and were waiting to we=
lcome him to their=20

new sphere.  He thrust his hands into his pockets--as he saw the others do-=
-and strode, not=20

walked or glided pussy-footedly, as became a "cage man." And he began to fe=
el a commiseration=20

for the men who were not in dress suits.  Skinner found himself taking a su=
dden interest in the=20

social chatter about him.  It did not bore him now.  Why had he always hate=
d it so, he asked=20

himself?  Probably because he had never taken the trouble to understand it-=
-but he was a rank=20

outsider then.  He began to wonder if social life were really so potent of =
good cheer, physical and=20

mental refreshment.  He began to realize that he had permitted himself to d=
islike a great institution=20

because of a few butterflies whose chatter had offended him.  But he now sa=
w that important=20

business men were social butterflies, at times.  Surely, they must see some=
thing in it.  And if these=20

clever and able men saw something in it, then he, Skinner, must have been s=
omething of an ass=20

to deny himself these things.  When McLaughlin came up and greeted him cord=
ially, McLaughlin=20

seemed a changed man.  His eyes were genial, and even his hair was concilia=
tory. And social=20

intercourse had done that!  "Gee whiz!" said Skinner to himself.  And Honey=
!  Skinner took a=20

brand-new pride in her.  She was radiantly happy, radiantly beautiful in a =
gown designed by a=20

clever dress-builder to exploit every one of her charms.  She was blooming =
like a rose whose=20

bloom had been arrested by the sordid things of life.  Honey had been "take=
n up."  She was now=20

the very center of a group of some of the "best" people there.  By Jove, Mc=
Laughlin's wife had=20

thrust her arm through Honey's and was leading her off to another group.  A=
s he watched her,=20

Skinner felt that even sin--when undertaken for another--has its compensati=
ons!  "Who is that very=20



distinguished man over there?" said Mrs. J. Smith Crawford, the wife of the=
 senior deacon of the=20

First Presbyterian.  Miss Mayhew adjusted her lorgnette.  "_What_ very dist=
inguished man?"=20

"There's only one," replied Mrs. Crawford.  "The man over there who looks l=
ike a cross between a=20

poet and an athlete."  "Oh, that's Skinner, of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.  =
The Skinners are great=20

friends of ours."  As a matter of fact, Miss Mayhew had never taken the tro=
uble to notice the=20

Skinners, but now that Skinner had made an impression on the exclusive Mrs.=
 Crawford, that=20

altered the case.  "I'm glad," said Mrs. Crawford.  "Go get him."  Skinner =
found Mrs. Crawford most=20

engaging.  She was neither haughty nor full of the pedantry with which soci=
al leaders try to=20

disabuse the mind of the ordinary citizen that the rich must necessarily be=
 dubs.  Twenty minutes=20

later, Deacon Crawford came up and Skinner was presented.  "I'm mighty glad=
 to know you, Mr.=20

Skinner," said the deacon.  "Some views I heard you expressing just now wer=
e quite in accord with=20

my own."  Skinner left the Crawfords presently with his head in the clouds.=
  But he was brought=20

down to earth by some one plucking him by the sleeve.  "Gee, Skinner, where=
 did you get it?" said=20

Allison, who stood there in a sack suit, grinning.  "Like it?" said Skinner=
, pleased.  "You bet!  It's a=20

Jim Lulu!"  "My wife made me get it," said Skinner, winking at Allison.  "W=
ell, I hope you'll continue=20

to recognize us," said Allison--and Skinner again felt the touch of envy, b=
ut he did n't like it, for=20

Skinner was no snob.  As Skinner and Honey were departing, Lewis touched hi=
m on the arm.=20

"We'll drop you and Mrs. Skinner at the house," he said.  "We've plenty of =
room in our car."  The=20

Lewises and the Skinners bade each other a very cordial, if not affectionat=
e, good-night when=20

Lewis's car pulled up at Skinner's door.  "Can you beat it?" said the "cage=
 man" as they closed the=20

door behind them.  "Lewis has scarcely noticed me for two years."  "It was =
the dress suit, Dearie."=20

"It's earned a dollar and a half already."  "How?" said Honey, surprised.  =
"Cab fare!  Say, I'm going=20

to keep an account of what this dress suit actually cost me and what it bri=
ngs in," said Skinner.=20

"And to think of it, Dearie,--it's all because of your getting that raise."=
  Honey laid her head on=20

Dearie's shoulder, as she always did when she felt sentimental.  "Eh-huh," =
said Skinner absently.=20

"I'm so grateful to think you got it--I just couldn't help telling Mrs. McL=
aughlin--"  "Huh?" Skinner=20

interrupted.  "You did n't mention that raise to Mrs. McLaughlin, did you?"=
  "Why should n't I?"=20

"But _did_ you?" said Skinner, with apprehension.  "Why, being almost impos=
sible. In the interests=20

of justice it is to be regretted that the truth was not made public in the =
first instance; supposing the=20

thieves to have been moderately prudent, it is now too late to repair the e=
rror."  This paragraph=20

was copied in subsequent editions of hundreds of London and provincial news=
papers.=20

CHAPTER XIV.  RICHARD GARDEN MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF FANNY LETHBRIDGE.=20

Punctually at nine o'clock in the morning Tom Barley made his appearance in=
 Fred Cornwall's=20

rooms. Garden, having assumed the command of what nearly every one but hims=
elf would have=20

considered a forlorn hope, of course was present; he was fresh and bright, =
but Fred's face was=20

haggard and anxious. In this respect Tom Barley was no better off; the poor=
 fellow was suffering a=20

martyrdom. The reproaches hurled against him by 'Melia Jane had caused him =
to look upon=20

himself as a monster of wickedness, and to believe that it was his evidence=
 alone that had brought=20

his beloved young mistress into deadly peril. When Fred Cornwall offered hi=
m his hand he shrank=20

back a little, and stood before the young lawyers in an attitude of sad hum=
ility, with his arms=20

drooping by his side.  "Why will you not give me your hand, Tom?" asked Fre=
d.  "It's more than I=20

dare do, sir," replied Tom. "I ought to have mine cut off, and my tongue cu=
t out as well, for saying=20



what I did in court, and for bringing Miss Phoebe to her death. If I'd had =
a notion of the=20

consequences of my evidence, not a word would they have got out of me, what=
ever the=20

consequence. 'Melia Jane is right; I don't deserve to live. It come over me=
 last night that I might=20

have saved Miss Phoebe if, instead of saying what I did say, I had said som=
ething else."  "What?"=20

inquired Garden, in a kind tone.  "Confessed to killing Miser Farebrother m=
yself. I was there, and=20

might have done it, and would if I'd seen him, as sure as there's a God abo=
ve us, if I'd had a=20

notion of what things were coming to! Yes; if I'd said as much they'd have =
been bound to believe=20

me, and Miss Phoebe would have been set free. You see, sir, there was every=
 reason for my=20

killing him; he treated me like a dog for years, and I hated him worse than=
 poison. Are you a=20

lawyer, sir?"  "Yes," replied Garden; "and I am assisting Mr. Cornwall in t=
his matter that we all=20

have so much at heart. I do not at all despair of proving Miss Farebrother'=
s innocence even yet."=20

"There's only one way of doing that, sir, if it can be done legally. I'd li=
ke to ask you a question, if=20

you wouldn't mind answering it."  "Go on, Tom."  "Would it be too late for =
me to go to the police-

station now, and give myself up for the murder? If they'd only believe me I=
 should be a happy man=20

again. Then Miss Phoebe would be saved, and everything'd be right."  "It is=
 too late for that, Tom.=20

Besides, it would be depriving us of the chance of bringing the crime home =
to the guilty parties and=20

making them suffer for it."  "Ah! if we could do that, sir, it would be the=
 happiest day's work that=20

ever was done in this cruel world! I'd be content to die the day after."  "=
Well, I am not at all sure=20

that we shall not manage it," said Garden, "and perhaps, Tom, it all depend=
s upon you."  "Upon=20

me, sir!" cried Tom; and Fred also turned to Garden in surprise.  "Perhaps =
upon you. We shall=20

soon know if the tack I am on will bring us safe into port."  "Your inspira=
tion, Dick?" asked Fred,=20

anxiously.  "My inspiration, Fred," said Garden, gravely. "If the tack is a=
 wrong one, we'll try=20

another. Now, Tom, you have nothing to reproach yourself with. You could do=
 no less than speak=20

the truth."  "I could, sir; I could have held my tongue."  "There is no pos=
sibility of your being=20

mistaken in any part of the evidence you gave?"  "Unluckily no, sir. I say =
so to you because you're=20

Miss Phoebe's friend; but if I had the opportunity now I'd swear the other =
way."  "Don't speak like=20

that, Tom. What we want is to save Miss Farebrother honestly and honourably=
: that is our first=20

great object. The next is to bring the murderers to justice. You were not i=
n court during the whole=20

of the trial."  "No, sir. I was told when to go to give my evidence, and th=
en I had to go back to my=20

duty."  "You were not aware, before you answered the questions as to the wo=
man you saw in the=20

grounds at Parksides and the dress she wore, that other witnesses were exam=
ined with respect to=20

the colour of the dress Miss Farebrother had on when she left her aunt's ho=
use?"  "No, sir, I knew=20

nothing of it; and I wondered what they were driving at."  "You swore to th=
e colour--blue?"  "Yes,=20

sir," replied poor Tom, hanging his head.  "You would swear to it again?"  =
Tom looked round=20

helplessly.  "You would swear to it again?" repeated Garden.  "No, I wouldn=
't," said Tom savagely.=20

"You would, Tom, because it is the truth; and if I am on the right tack, on=
ly the truth will serve us.=20

Now, although you were not in court during the whole of the trial, you read=
 the report of it in the=20

papers?"  "I did, sir."  "Clear your mind, Tom, and bend it on what I am ab=
out to ask you. In=20

reading the report of the trial, did anything particular strike you?"  "It =
was full of lies, sir."  "I am=20

sure of that. But anything very special"--and here Garden's voice trembled =
slightly, as though he=20

were approaching a crucial test--"say as to the colour of dresses? Think, T=
om."  "No occasion to=20

think, sir. What they said about Mrs. Pamflett's dresses was a pack of lies=
 from beginning to end."=20



"How is that, Tom?" asked Garden, rising and moving a step nearer to Tom Ba=
rley.  "Why, sir,=20

wasn't it said that Mrs. Pamflett hated blue dresses, and never wore one." =
 "They did, Tom."=20

"Damned lies, sir! Why didn't they ask _me_ about that? I ought to know, li=
ving at Parksides the=20

years I did. I've seen her hundreds and hundreds of times in a blue dress."=
  Garden caught Fred's=20

hand. "You are ready to swear that?"  "Ready, sir? Yes; and it's the truth-=
-by God!"  A look of=20

triumph flashed into Garden's eyes, and his face was radiant. "I'm on the r=
ight tack, Fred," he=20

cried; "Miss Farebrother is saved!"  On the evening of that day Richard Gar=
den and Fred Cornwall=20

met Kiss by appointment. The kind-hearted actor had news of vital importanc=
e to give them. Mrs.=20

Pamflett and Jeremiah were still at No. 12 Surrey Street and had not stirre=
d out the whole of the=20

day.  "Adjoining the room they eat and drink in," said Kiss, "is a little b=
ox-room, too small to let to=20

any lodger, but large enough for lumber, and that's the use it's put to by =
the landlady. Formerly it=20

was part of the room the two fiends have taken, but some time ago it was pa=
rtitioned off for boxes=20

and that kind of thing. Consequently the wall that separates it from the=20


_
appreciation they'd shown!"  "And what did Mrs. McLaughlin say?"  "She aske=
d me what I meant."=20

"And what did _you_ say?"  "I told her her husband would understand and I w=
anted him to know=20

just how I felt about it."  "The devil you did," said Skinner.  True to his=
 word, Skinner proceeded to=20

keep a little book marked "Dress-Suit Account."  He was probably the only m=
an, he reflected, who=20

had ever done such a thing, and he did it at first more as a joke than anyt=
hing else.  But he found=20

that the "Dress-Suit Account" developed serious as well as humorous possibi=
lities.  He first=20

entered carefully, item by item, the cost of the dress suit and its accesso=
ries.                      _Dress-

Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_    Dress=
 suit .........   $90.00   Dress shirt is=20

a cupboard, nothing more, and anybody concealed there can hear what is goin=
g on in the=20

adjoining apartment. Sir, Mrs. Linton, provided with sandwiches and cold te=
a, has been concealed=20

in that cupboard nearly the whole of the day unknown to the Pamfletts. The =
woman who stole the=20

diamond bracelet has been with them, and she heard all that passed. That st=
range paragraph=20

which is in all the evening papers about the bracelet that was stolen being=
 the genuine one, is=20

true. Mrs. Linton heard the woman swear to it. She wanted to know whether J=
eremiah Pamflett=20

had possession of the bracelet. At first he denied that he had, but the wom=
an said he was telling a=20

lie, and she did not intend to be done. They almost got to high words, but =
the Pamfletts spoke in a=20

low voice and calmed the woman down; and upon=20

outfit not directly   descended=20

from, but   collaterally related   to "Dress-Suit   Account"--an inevitable=
   expenditure.   Skinner=20

noted that everything was on the debit side until the night of the First Pr=
esbyterian reception.=20

Then he put down:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_             _D=
ebit_                         _Credit_=20

Beginning of social education.   And he did n't neglect to add the relative=
ly unimportant item:--=20

_Debit_                         _Credit_                                   =
   Cab fare saved: $1.50.   From that time=20

on, both debit and credit items were put down as they occurred to Skinner. =
 While Skinner was=20

thus directly concerned with the dress-suit account, that potent affair was=
 rapidly developing=20

ramifications in an unsuspected direction.  "I say, Perk," said McLaughlin =
to the junior partner, the=20

day after the reception, "I saw Skinner and his wife at the First Presbyter=
ian affair in Meadeville=20

her the truth she would go straight to the police-station and confess the r=
obbery and have them=20

arrested, they confessed that they _had_ got the bracelet, but had deposite=
d it elsewhere for=20

safety. 'That being so,' said the woman, 'you must have stolen it from Mise=
r Farebrother, and the=20

girl who has been found guilty of his murder is innocent. It was _you_ who =
murdered him! You are=20

in my power now, and if you don't pay me well to hold my tongue I'll have t=
he pair of you hanged!'=20

For a little while after that Mrs. Linton heard nothing more--only a murmur=
 of voices; but before she=20

went away she heard the woman say, 'To-morrow night, then, at ten o'clock; =
and mind you come=20

with the bracelet and the money ready. If you don't, your life is not worth=
 an hour's purchase.' That=20

was all; when the woman was gone, Mrs. Pamflett and her son talked in whisp=
ers, and not a word=20

could Mrs. Linton catch. But I think she heard enough."  "Quite enough," sa=
id Garden, "and you=20

have rendered us an inestimable service. What you have told us would almost=
 justify our taking=20

immediate action against the monsters; but there is something else of great=
 importance to do=20

within the next few hours. We will take them red-handed to-morrow night, th=
e two murderers and=20

the thief who in the first instance stole the bracelet. Then the case will =
be complete, and there will=20

be no escape for them. Now go back and keep watch upon their movements. The=
y must not be=20

allowed to go anywhere without being followed. If you have the slightest re=
ason to fear that they=20

will give you the slip, lay hands upon them, collect a crowd, and give them=
 in charge."  "Upon what=20

charge?" asked Kiss.  "Upon the charge of stealing the bracelet. If that wi=
ll not do, say that new=20

evidence has come to light respecting the murder of Miser Farebrother, whic=
h proves them to be=20


_
the nines."  "There's nothing startling in that."  "No--but what do you sup=
pose Skinner's wife said to=20

Mrs. Mac?"  Perkins sighed heavily at the bare suggestion.  "What the deuce=
 has that got to do=20

with me?"  "Wait till I tell you.  She almost wept on Mrs. Mac's neck while=
 she told her how grateful=20

she was--grateful for the way we had shown our appreciation of Skinner!"  P=
erkins pricked up his=20

ears.  "The deuce you say!"  "I thought you'd come to," said McLaughlin.  "=
What did she mean by=20

that?"  "Don't know.  Mrs. Mac asked her what she was driving at--and she s=
aid I 'd understand.=20

She wanted me to know how she felt about it--that's all!"  Perkins's only c=
omment was, "Curious!"=20

"Say, Perk," McLaughlin went on, "do you reckon she was trying to be sarcas=
tic--trying to give us a=20

sly dig for turning Skinner down?"  "He'd never tell her that."  "Then what=
 _did_ she mean?"=20

Perkins shrugged his shoulders.  McLaughlin knitted his brows.  "I don't un=
derstand it."  He=20

drummed on the table with the paper-knife.  "I told you I was afraid of my =
card, and say I will=20

attend at the police station at ten o'clock to-morrow morning to prove my c=
ase. Meanwhile, you=20

will, of course, let me know that you have taken action. But the necessity =
will not arise: the=20

Pamfletts will not attempt to escape from the woman for the next twenty-fou=

aware that sudden flittings from place to place would be likely to draw att=
ention upon them, and=20

their chief desire is to avoid observation and be left to themselves, in or=
der that in a little while they=20

may disappear quietly from the country, taking with them the bracelet and t=
he money they must=20

have stolen from Miser Farebrother. If I were not thoroughly convinced of t=
his I should set aside a=20

most important affair in connection with the evidence upon the murder, and =
have the Pamfletts=20

arrested immediately. My object is to make the case against them so complet=
e that they shall have=20

no loop-hole of escape. It will hasten the hour of Miss Farebrother's relea=
se, instead of retarding=20

it."  "You are a good general, Mr. Garden,"=20
