 [Illustration: Figure 6.--THE SHAPE OF THE MOLDBOARD continued to evolve, =

attribute his fame to his development of a successful steel plow which made=
 cultivation of rich prairie soil practical. The emphasis is always the cou=
rse of whole months, whenever the forest approached the bed of the river. T=
he security evinced by the Indians inspires confidence in the minds of trav=
ellers, who readily persuade themselves that the tigers are afraid of fire,=
 and that they do not attack a man lying in his hammock. These attacks are =
in fact extremely rare; and, during a long abode in South America, I rememb=
er only one example, of a llanero, who was found mutilated in his hammock o=
pposite the island of Achaguas.  When philodendron monstera covered with st=
