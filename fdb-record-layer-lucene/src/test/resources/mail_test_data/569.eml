opened, and Mr. Claudius Leyton appeared.  The curate did indeed look extremely youthful. A 

small frame, delicate features, and a complexion like a maiden's, with smooth, fine, flaxen hair 

parted down the middle, gave the impression that the curate might be five or six years younger 

than he really was, and that a student's cap and gown would have suited him better than the dress 

which he wore. Notwithstanding his shy, nervous manner, however, Claudius Leyton was 

thoroughly the gentleman, and Ben Stone felt more awkward than he would have cared to own at 

his slighting observations fixedly. Then, grasping the back with his capable-looking hand, instead 

of beginning at once a quest which his gendarmes had abandoned, he searched the face of the 

tortured woman.  Unflinching in courage, she seemed not to see him. But it was as if she had 

suddenly ceased to breathe. Her bosom no longer rose and fell. The only movement was the 

visible knocking of her heart. I felt that, in another moment, if he found what she had hidden, her 

heart would knock no longer, and she would die. For a second I wildly counted the chances of 

overpowering all three men, stunning them into

The burly carpenter first made matters worse by a muttered "Beg pardon, didn't know who was 

there;" and suddenly becoming aware that an apology was a blunder, he said something about his 

old woman wanting him at home, and, in his hurry to make his escape, first dropped his stick, 

then, in recovering it, stumbled over the cradle which was at the side of Mrs. Franks, and awoke 

the baby.  The cry of the infant effected a seasonable diversion; it covered the retreat of the 

carpenter, and gave Persis an opportunity of soon quitting the room and carrying the child 

upstairs, that the curate might have an undisturbed conversation with her husband. Franks placed 

a chair for Mr. Leyton with more of courteous respect than he would have shown to his cousin, Sir 

Lacy, the lord of the manor, while Ben Stone went home and made his wife merry with the account 

of what had occurred, wondering, between his explosive bursts of laughter, how the curate had 

liked to hear himself called "a blushing boy of a giving Maxine time to escape with the letter-case. 

But I knew the attempt would be useless. Even if I could succeed, the noise would arouse the 

hotel. People would come. Other policemen would rush in to the help of their comrades, and 

matters would be worse with us than before.  The Frenchman, having looked at Maxine, and seen 

that tell-tale beating of her bodice, deliberately laid the silk cushions on the floor. Then, pushing 

his hand down between the seat and the back of the sofa, he moved it along the crevice inch by 

inch.  I watched the hand, which looked cruel to me as that of an executioner. I think Maxine 

watched it, too. Suddenly it stopped. It had found something. The other hand sprang to its 

assistance. Both worked together, groping and prying for a few seconds: evidently the something 

hidden had been forced deeply and firmly down. Then, up it came--a dark red leather case, which 

was neither a letter-case nor a jewel-case, but might be used for either. My heart almost stopped

No one knows how often Claudius Leyton had repeated to himself, as if the words haunted him, 

the exhortation to Timothy, _Let no man despise thy youth_; nor what a burden the want of self-

confidence, added to natural shyness, was to the Curate of Colme. Mr. Leyton lacked neither 

talent nor zeal, but he was painfully aware relief I felt. For this was not the thing I had come from 

London to bring Maxine.  I could hardly keep back a cry of joy. But I did keep it back, for suspense 

and anxiety had left me a few grains of sense.  "Voila!" grunted the Commissary of Police. "I said 

that you were clever, Mademoiselle. But it would have been as well

weight and influence with his flock which every faithful pastor should have; and the young 

clergyman sometimes seriously contemplated wearing spectacles, although his sight was perfect, 

in order to take away that boyishness of appearance which marred his usefulness so much.     III. 

The Curate's Visit   "I have many apologies to make, Mr. Franks, for calling so late, and on a 

Sunday evening," said Mr. Leyton, after nervously motioning to the school-master to take a seat 

opposite to him; "and I'm afraid that I've had spared us this trouble."  "You alone are to blame for 

the trouble," answered Maxine. "I never saw that thing before in my life."  I was astonished that 

there was no ring of satisfaction in her voice. It sounded hard and defiant, but there was no 

triumph in it, no joy that, so far, she was saved--as if by a miracle. Rather was her tone that of a 

woman at bay, fighting to the last, but without hope. "Nor did I ever see it before." I echoed her 

words.  She glanced at me as if with gratitude. Yet there was no need
