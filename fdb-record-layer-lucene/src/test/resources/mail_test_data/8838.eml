of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, and the Patriarchs. In short, the author shows that the 

pyramid contains in itself architecturally the whole of _Genesis_, and discloses the astronomical, 

and even the physiological, secrets in its symbols and glyphs; yet he will not admit, it would seem, 

the psycho-cosmical and spiritual mysteries involved in these. Nor does the author apparently see 

that the root of all this has to be sought in the archaic legends and the Pantheon of India.(384) 

Failing this, whither does his great and admirable labour lead him? Not further than to find out that 

Adam, the earth, and Moses or Jehovah "are the same"--or to the a-b-c of comparative Occult 

Symbology--and that the days in _Genesis_ being "circles" "displayed by the Hebrews as 

squares," the result of the sixth- day's labour culminates in the fructifying principle. Thus the 

_Bible_ is made to yield Phallicism, and that alone.  Nor--read in this light, and as its Hebrew texts 

are interpreted by Western scholars--can it ever yield anything higher or more sublime than such 

phallic elements, the root and the corner-stone of its dead-letter meaning. Anthropomorphism and 

Revelation dig the impassable chasm between the material world and the ultimate spiritual truths. 

That creation is not thus described in the Esoteric Doctrine is easily shown. The Roman Catholics 

give a reading far more approaching the true Esoteric meaning than that of the Protestant. For 

several of their saints and doctors admit that the formation of heaven and earth, of the celestial 

bodies, etc., belongs to the work of the "Seven Angels of the Presence." St. Denys calls the 

"Builders" "the cooeperators of God," and St. Augustine goes even farther, and credits the Angels 

with the possession of the divine thought, the prototype, as he says, of everything created.(385) 

And, finally, St. Thomas Aquinas has a long dissertation upon this topic, calling God the primary, 

and the  "An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me."  "You 

see, cardinal," replied the queen, "that your enemies are mine."  "That is not enough madame, it is 

necessary that your friends should be also mine."  "My friends, monsieur?" The queen shook her 

head. "Alas, I have them no longer!"  "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when 

you had many in adversity?"  "It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends, monsieur; 

because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis, who, returning from her first exile, treated with 

contempt all those who had suffered for her and, being proscribed a second time, died at Cologne 

abandoned by every one, even by her own son."  "Well, let us see," said Mazarin; "isn't there still 

time to repair the evil? Search among your friends, your oldest friends."  "What do you mean, 

monsieur?"  "Nothing else than I say--search."  "Alas, I look around me in vain! I have no influence 

with any one. Monsieur is, as usual, led by his favorite; yesterday it was Choisy, to-day it is La 

Riviere, to-morrow it will be some one else. Monsieur le Prince is led by the coadjutor, who is led 

by Madame de Guemenee."  "Therefore, madame, I ask you to look, not among your friends of to-

day, but among those of other times."  "Among my friends of other times?" said the queen.  "Yes, 

among your friends of other times; among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de 

Richelieu and even to conquer him."  "What is he aiming at?" murmured the queen, looking 

uneasily at the cardinal.  "Yes," continued his eminence; "under certain circumstances, with that 

strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses, aided by your friends, you were able to repel the 

attacks of that adversary."  "I!" said the queen. "I suffered, that is all."  "Yes," said Mazarin, "as 

women suffer in avenging themselves. Come, let us come to the point. Do you know Monsieur de 

Rochefort?"  "One of

this, with some dogmatic differences of form, the "Angelic Doctor" approaches very nearly the 

Gnostic ideas. Basilides speaks of the lowest order of Angels as the Builders of our material world, 

and Saturnilus held, as did the Sabaeans, that the Seven Angels who preside over the planets are 

the real creators of the world; the Kabalist-monk, Trithemius, in his _De Secundis Richelieu."  "I 

know that, and we sent him to the Bastile," said Mazarin.  "Is he at liberty?" asked the queen.  "No; 

still there, but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce the name of another man. Do you 

know Monsieur d'Artagnan?" he added, looking steadfastly at the queen.  Anne of Austria received 

the blow with a beating heart.  "Has the Gascon been
