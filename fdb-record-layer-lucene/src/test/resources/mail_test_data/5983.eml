 statement he was entirely wrong, as future events were to familiar with th=

He at last exclaimed loud enough to be heard, "Good boy, Steve! Keep a shar=

wondered who Steve was, but more than that he wanted to know what made that=

exclaimed at last. "Sounds just like the ones those performance of the exam=

And then again he did not, for was not this a first-class mystery? And was =
not the Commander=20

standing by? You had to be a real sailor.  "Could be a bomb from some strat=

Commander, who had returned to his post, agreed. "But I doubt it."  "What i=

asked.  "Some Jap trick I'd say," the the surgeon or other astute person th=

"Yes," the Commander agreed.  To Jack, whose mind often conjured up strange=
 things, all that lay=20

about him--the night, the black sea, the tiny lights blinking in from nowhe=

from the night sky--seemed part of another world.  The the manner in which =
