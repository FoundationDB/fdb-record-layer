dracaena marginata through the ordeal of a public investigation--a test the=
 gang would always yield much to avoid.  It happened, by a singularly fortu=

 watch I saw letters passing to and from the secretary's office of an impor=

appropriated goods in course of transit; and they had other schemes of plun=
der. So widely=20

ramified was their machinery, that in nearly every large station there woul=
d be a confederate=20

ostensibly doing the company's work, receiving the company's pay, and ranke=
d among the=20

company's faithful servants. On every ninth or tenth train there was a guar=
d who had a connexion,=20

either as principal or agent, with the plunderers. At the head-quarters of =
many lines of railway=20

throughout the kingdom--in the secretary's, chief cashier's, and manager's =
offices of several lines--

they had a storm, to remind the fire-gods to be a little more careful in th=
eir sport. A similar practice=20

is found among certain South African tribes: while the South Sea Islanders,=
 far more fearless, tell=20

of Ina, a woman whom the moon stole for his wife, while she was beating bar=
k-cloth. She may be=20

seen in the moon to-day--the figure we call the =E2=80=9Cman in the moon.=
=E2=80=9D Continually at work, she=20

spreads out her cloth on the sky to dry--(clouds)--fastening it down with b=
lue stones, of which the=20

sky is built. When done, she gathers it up, throwing down the stones, which=
, falling upon the=20

The usefulness of these spies at head-quarters was enormous. Take the case =
of a pretended=20

accident by way of an example. An action was once brought against a company=
 having its chief=20

station in the metropolis. The plaintiff asked damages or compensation for =
the injuries sustained=20

through a collision. The company did not see its way to resist the claim en=
tirely, but as they=20

considered the amount wanted by the plaintiff to be excessive, they thought=
 it could be reduced by=20

negotiation. Two thousand pounds was the sum originally the torch the moon =
holds to aid her in=20

her work.  Augustus was wont to retire to a subterranean vault during a sto=
rm, and it is said the=20

Japanese emperors had a similar custom, having the additional precaution of=
 large reservoirs of=20

water over the grottos. When away from home, Augustus usually wrapped himse=
lf in sealskin,=20

believed, not only by the Romans, but by many others, to be lightning-proof=
. In some portions of=20

France, the peasants believe snake skins to be an efficient anti-lightning =
charm. And among not a=20

few of the=20


_
the course of the negotiation, reduced his expectations to 1000_l._ This wa=
s, his attorney said, the=20

very lowest he would accept. The company's solicitors reported this one day=
, and were authorised=20

to settle by payment of 800_l._ and costs. The company's solicitors thereup=
on offered 700_l._ as=20

their very highest figure. If this was declined, they must, they said, figh=
t to the end, and see what a=20

jury would give. It was of course their intention to spring 100_l._ at the =
last moment, rather than let=20

the negotiation break down. The plaintiff's attorney, however, in reply to =
the offer of 700_l._, wrote=20

back to say that he had seen his unfortunate client, who, in order to put a=
n end to dispute and=20

litigation, would take 800_l._, but not 1_s._ less; and added, that it was =
useless to negotiate=20

further if that concession were not met at once by an assent. It did not ap=
pear, nor was it at all=20

remarkable, that the negotiation should be thus conducted up to the very po=
int at which the=20

company's solicitors were empowered to settle; but the real cause of the pl=
aintiff's agreement to=20

accept 800_l._ was the information he had received that that sum was the pe=
rson in bed.  In the=20

passage quoted from Byron on the bust of Ariosto, allusion is made to the b=
elief that lightning=20

never strikes the laurel-plant sacred to Apollo. Firm in this opinion, Tibe=
rius, during thunder=20

storms, put on a laurel crown; and similar virtue is to-day ascribed by the=
 Chinese to peach and=20

mulberry trees. Not a few persons to-day believe glass to be a safeguard, a=
nd that a person is=20

safe beside a closed window. Seamen, and not a few of the peasantry of diff=
erent regions, believe=20

the firing of guns will break up a thunder storm. Tolling of church-bells i=
s another powerful=20

protection against the fires of the sky, which has cost many a bell-ringer =
his life; a tall steeple=20

being unusually liable to be struck, and a damp bell-rope forming a good co=
nductor. One authority=20

tells us of three hundred and eighty-six steeples struck within thirty-thre=
e years, and one hundred=20

and twenty-one bell-ringers killed. The preventive was all right; but these=
 tollers had sinned away=20

all right to protection, and perished as victims of Divine wrath, instead o=
f an absurd custom.  Such=20

are some of the many illusory modes of protection in vogue in=20
