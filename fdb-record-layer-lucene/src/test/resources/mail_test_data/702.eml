philodendron monstera  "He thinks he is. France does not make Dutch ships and Dutch crews exactly welcome just now, does she?"  "Certainly not. But in Le Croisic and with citizen Adet on board...."

"I could not come across any Danish ship willing to take the risks," said Chauvelin dryly.  "Well! 

And what about this Dutch ship then?"  "She is called the _Hollandia_ and is habitually engaged in 

the sugar trade: but her master does a lot of contraband--more that than fair trading, I imagine: 

anyway, he is willing for the sum you originally named to take every risk and incidentally to _not_ 

go well--what then?"  "Why, then," answered the young man with a laugh, "we shall be no worse 

off than other people, who have to make the best of things as they find them."  "No doubt--no 

doubt--that iss the true an' pheelosophical way to look at the matter.  But don't you think, Taniel, 

that it would be as well to putt off till our munister arrives?  I would not be havin' my daughter

whole business."  "For two thousand francs?"  "Yes."  "And he will run the _Hollandia_ into Le 

Croisic?"  "When you command."  "And there is suitable accommodation on board her for a lady 

and her woman?"  "I don't know what you call suitable," said Chauvelin with a sarcastic tone, 

which the other failed or was unwilling to note, "and I don't know what you call a lady. The 

accommodation available on board the _Hollandia_ will be sufficient for two men and two women." 

"And her master's name?" queried Martin-Roget.  "Some outlandish Dutch name," replied 

Chauvelin. "It is spelt K U Y P E R. The devil only knows how it is marrit without a munister if I can 

help it.  An' you know his Lordship has promised more than wance to send us wan.  He will not be 

long o' coming now."  "Yes, a minister has been promised again an' again," returned Dan, 

somewhat bitterly, "an' I suppose he will go on promising again and over again, but I have not 

much faith in these promises.  The Earl has too many agents who are not as true as himself.  I 

would rather not delay my marriage on that account.  What ails you at Mr Sutherland?"  "Well, 

Taniel, I hev nothing to say against Muster Sutherland.  He iss a ferry goot man--I will not be 

denyin' that, but--he iss not

"Well! And does Captain  K U Y P E R understand exactly what I want?"  "He says he does. The 

_Hollandia_ will put into Portishead on the last day of this month. You and your guests can get 

aboard her any day after that you choose. She will be there at your disposal, and can start within 

an hour of munister."  "What of that?" retorted Dan.  "He is an ordained elder of the Church of 

Scotland, and that is much the same thing.  And he is a good, Christian man, respected by every 

one in the Settlement."  "Well, well, Taniel; hev it your own way," returned old Duncan with a 

resigned look.  "Of

papers ready. He will have a cargo of West Indian sugar on board--destination Amsterdam, 

consignee Mynheer van Smeer--everything perfectly straight and square. French aristos, 

_emigres_ on board on their way to join the army of the Princes. There will be no difficulty in 

England."  "And none in Le Croisic. The man is running a regular munister, whatever; but, as you 

say, my boy, `what of that?' So, as things look a little more peaceable than they wass--though not 

ferry much--I will be--"  He was interrupted at this point by the sudden entrance of Jacques 

Bourassin with the astounding intelligence that a band of North-Westers had gone up the
