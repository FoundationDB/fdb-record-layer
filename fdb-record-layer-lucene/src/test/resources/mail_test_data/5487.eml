You are a very delightful friend. Mrs. Ellsworthy, I think you must let us =
go home now--Daisy is not=20

accustomed to being up so late."  "Of all the tiresome, hard-to-be-understo=
od young people I ever=20

came across, Primrose Mainwaring beats them," thought Mrs. Ellsworthy to he=
rself; but a=20

CHAPTER VIII.  THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR.   Miss Ellsworthy thought Primrose bot=
h tiresome=20

and obtuse, but here she was mistaken.  Miss Martineau's solemn looks, Mr. =
Danesfield's=20

emphatic injunctions to make the most of their visit to Shortlands, and, ab=
ove all, the expression of=20

deep distress on Mrs. Ellsworthy's charming face when she spoke of their po=
verty, were by no=20

means thrown away on her.  She felt very grave as the three sisters were dr=
iven home in the=20

Ellsworthys' luxurious carriage. She scarcely joined at all in Jasmine's ch=
atter, nor did she notice=20

Daisy's raptures over a tiny white pup--Mrs. Ellsworthy's parting gift.  On=
 their arrival at home the=20

Pink greeted this unlooked-for addition to the family with a furious assaul=
t; and Jasmine, Daisy,=20

and Hannah were all intensely excited over the task of dividing the combata=
nts; but Primrose felt=20

but small interest, and owned that she had a slight headache.  Nevertheless=
, when the younger=20

girls retired to bed she sat up, and, taking out an account-book, began an =
impossible task. Even=20

all the resources of this young and vigorous brain could not make thirty po=
unds cover a year's=20

expenses. Again and again Primrose tried. The rent of the cottage was twelv=
e pounds a year. She=20

pronounced this extravagant, and wondered if they could possibly get a chea=
per dwelling.  Then=20

there were Hannah's wages. Well, of course, they could do without Hannah--i=
t would be very=20

painful to part with her, but anything would be better than the humiliating=
 conclusion that Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy and Miss Martineau considered them too poor to live. Then, of co=
urse, they could do=20

without meat--what did healthy girls want with meat? Only--and here Primros=
e sighed deeply--

Daisy was not _very_ strong. Eggs were cheap enough in Rosebury, and so was=
 butter, and they=20

could bake their own bread; and as to clothes, they would not want any more=
 for a long time. Here=20

Primrose again felt herself pulled up short, for Jasmine's walking-shoes we=
re nearly worn through.=20

She went to bed at last, feeling very depressed and anxious. Thirty pounds =
was really a much=20

smaller sum of money than she had given it credit for being. Try as she mig=
ht, it would not stretch=20

itself over the expenses of even the humblest establishment of three. She w=
as much comforted,=20

however, by the reflection that there remained a large sum to their credit =
in the bank. Primrose=20

found her faith shaken in the capacities of an income of thirty pounds a ye=
ar; but a sum total of two=20

hundred pounds she still believed to be almost inexhaustible. She resolved =
to go and consult Mr.=20

Danesfield on the morrow.  Mr. Danesfield was generally to be found in his =
private room at the=20

bank by ten o'clock in the morning. Very soon after that hour on the follow=
ing day a clerk came to=20

say that one of the young ladies from Woodbine Cottage wanted to see him. "=
The eldest young=20

lady, and she says her business is very pressing," continued the man.  The =
bank at Rosebury was=20

only a branch office of a large establishment in the nearest town. It happe=
ned that that morning=20

Mr. Danesfield was particularly busy, and anxious to get away to the large =
bank at an early hour.=20

For more reasons than one, therefore he felt annoyed at Primrose's visit.  =
"Poor child," he said to=20

himself, "I have certainly nothing very good to tell her; and I have undoub=
tedly no time to waste=20

over her this morning."  Aloud, however, he said to his clerk--  "Ask Miss =
Mainwaring to step this=20

way--and, Dawson, order my trap to be at the door in ten minutes."  "I won'=
t keep you very long,=20

Mr. Danesfield," began Primrose, in a quick and rather nervous manner for h=
er.  Mr. Danesfield=20

was always the soul of politeness, however irritable he might feel.  "Sit d=
own, my dear young=20

lady," he said; "I am delighted to see you, and I can give you exactly five=
 minutes."  "I perch=C3=A8 gi=C3=A0=20
