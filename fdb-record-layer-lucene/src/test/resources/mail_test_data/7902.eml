philodendron monstera struck midnight, and exactly one minute before His Ro=

miles away.  "Take the first shot, Little Bill."  They had only one gun bet=

"No, no," he replied promptly. "Don't tell him anything. I don't want to se=

gone before I'm awake, I reckon."  "That 'e will, zir, most like. Good-nigh=

mind--that lout gets the two horses back again for my use in the morning. I=
 shall have to make my=20

way to Chelwood as early as may be."  "Aye, aye, zir," assented the woman p=
lacidly. It were no=20

use, she thought, to upset the Mounzeer's temper once more by telling him t=
hat his guide had=20

decamped. Time enough in the morning, when she would be less busy.  "And my=
 John can see 'im=20

as far as Chelwood," she thought to herself as she finally closed the door =
on the stranger and=20

made her way slowly down the creaking stairs.     CHAPTER III  THE ASSEMBLY=
 ROOMS   I  The=20

sigh of satisfaction was quite unmistakable.  It could be heard from end to=
 end, from corner to=20

corner of the building. It sounded above the din of the orchestra who had j=
ust attacked with vigour=20

the opening bars of a schottische, above the brouhaha of moving dancers and=
 the frou-frou of=20

skirts: it travelled from the small octagon hall, through the central salon=
 to the tea-room, the ball-

room and the card-room: it reverberated from the gallery in the ball-room t=
o the maids' gallery: it=20

distracted the ladies from their gossip and the gentlemen from their cards.=
  It was a universal,=20

heartfelt "Ah!" of intense and pleasurable satisfaction.  Sir Percy Blakene=
y and his lady had just=20

arrived. It was close on midnight, and highest part of the low point, where=
 a piece of green sward,=20

free from bushes, formed an attractive resting-place.  "Sit there now, Bill=
ie, till I get some brush,=20

an' make yourself useful by cutting out goose heads.  See, here are some br=
anches o' the right=20

sort ready to hand.  No doubt some Redskins have been at work here before u=
s."  He picked up=20

some pieces of wood which Nature had formed more or less to resemble the he=
ads and necks of=20

geese.  By a very slight use of the knife Billie converted these into excel=
lent portraits.  When he=20

had finished half-a-dozen of them, his brother had cut and brought to the s=
pot a number of bushy=20

branches about two or three feet high.  These were soon stuck into the grou=
nd in a small circle so=20

as to resemble a growing bush, behind, or, rather, in the midst of which, t=
hey could effectually=20

conceal themselves by crouching.  While this was being constructed the elde=
r brother went down=20

to the edge of the water and made half-a-dozen mud-heaps well within gunsho=
t, which when the=20

artificial heads and necks were attached to them, formed such exact counter=
parts of geese that=20

the wild birds might well be excused for mistaking them for friends.  Indee=
d tyros at this work have=20

been known to fire at such decoys believing them to be genuine birds.  Even=
 while they were thus=20

engaged one and another flock of ducks and geese passed them on their way t=
o warmer climes;=20

of course sheering off as they passed.  But when the arrangement was comple=
ted, and the=20


_
without the presence of Sir Percy? His Royal Highness too had been expected=
 earlier than this.=20

But it was not thought that he would come at all, despite his promise, if t=
he spoilt pet of Bath=20

society remained unaccountably absent; and the Assembly Rooms had worn an a=
ir of woe even in=20

the face of the gaily dressed throng which filled every vast room in its re=
motest angle.  But now Sir=20

Percy Blakeney had arrived, just before the boys, crouching low, gazed at t=
he horizon with eager=20

looks, the wild birds no longer avoided the spot.  On the contrary, seeing =
the decoys, they rather=20

inclined to pass close to the place.  In flying down a river, or along the =
margin of a lake, wild birds=20

may diverge a little to follow the sinuosities of bank or shore, but they w=
ill not get out of the way of=20

a projecting promontory; they rather make a short cut by crossing over=20
