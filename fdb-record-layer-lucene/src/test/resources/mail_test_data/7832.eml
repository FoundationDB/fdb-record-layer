volutes themselves should be channelled out to a depth which is one twelfth=
 of their height. These=20

will be the symmetrical proportions for capitals of columns twenty-five fee=
t high and less. For=20

higher columns the other proportions will be the same, but the length and b=
readth of the abacus=20

will be the thickness of the lower diameter of a column plus one ninth part=
 thereof; thus, just as the=20

higher the column the less the diminution, so the projection of its capital=
 is proportionately=20

increased and its breadth[2] is correspondingly enlarged.  [Note 2: Codd. _=
altitudo_.]  8. With=20

whatever awaited me there.... I went out of the station. It was awkward by =
daylight to return home,=20

where every one was so glad at my going. I might spend the rest of the day =
till evening at some=20

neighbour's, but with whom? With some of them I was on strained relations, =
others I did not know=20

at all. I considered and thought of Ivan Ivanitch.  "We are going to Bragin=
o!" I said to the=20

coachman, getting into the sledge.  "It's a long way," sighed Nikanor; "it =
will be twenty miles, or=20

maybe twenty-five."  "Oh, please, my dear fellow," I said in a tone as thou=
gh Nikanor had the right=20

to refuse.=20


_
book a figure will be subjoined and a calculation showing how they may be d=
escribed so that their=20

spirals may be true to the compass.  The capitals having been finished and =
set up in due=20

proportion to the columns (not exactly level on the columns, however, but w=
ith the same measured=20

adjustment, so that in the upper members there may be an increase correspon=
ding to that which=20

was made in the stylobates), the rule for the architraves is to be as follo=
ws. If the columns are at=20

least twelve feet and not more than fifteen feet high, let the height of th=
e architrave be equal to half=20

the thickness of a column at the bottom. If they are from fifteen feet to t=
wenty, let the height of a=20

column be measured off into thirteen parts, and let one of these be the hei=
ght of the architrave. If=20

they are from twenty to twenty-five feet, let this height be divided into t=
welve and one half parts,=20

and let one of them form the height of the architrave. If they are from twe=
nty-five feet to thirty, let it=20

be divided into twelve parts, and let one of them form the height. If they =
are higher, the heights of=20

the architraves are to be worked out proportionately in the same manner fro=
m the height of the=20

columns.  9. For the higher that the eye has to climb, the less easily can =
it make its way through=20

the thicker and thicker mass of air. So it fails when the height is great, =
its strength is sucked out of=20

it, and it conveys to the mind only a confused estimate of the dimensions. =
Hence there must=20

always be a corresponding increase in the symmetrical proportions of the me=
mbers, so that=20

whether the buildings are on unusually lofty sites or are themselves somewh=
at colossal, the size of=20

the parts may seem in due proportion. The depth of the architrave on its un=
der side just above the=20

capital, is to be equivalent to the thickness of the top of the column just=
 under the capital, and on=20

its uppermost side equivalent to the foot of the shaft.  10. The cymatium o=
f the architrave should=20

be one seventh of the height of the whole architrave, and its projection th=
e same. Omitting the=20

cymatium, the rest of the architrave is to be divided into twelve  Nikanor =
shook his head doubtfully=20

and said slowly that we really ought to have put in the shafts, not Circass=
ian, but Peasant or=20

Siskin; and uncertainly, as though expecting I should change my mind, took =
the reins in his gloves,=20

stood up, thought a moment, and then raised his whip.  "A whole series of i=
nconsistent actions..." I=20

thought, screening my face from the snow. "I must have gone out of my mind.=
 Well, I don't care...."=20

In one place, on a very high and steep slope, Nikanor carefully held the ho=
rses in to the middle of=20

the descent, but in the middle the horses suddenly bolted and dashed downhi=
ll at a fearful rate; he=20

raised his elbows and shouted in a wild, frantic voice such as I had never =
heard from him before:=20

"Hey! Let's give the general a drive! If you come to grief he'll buy new on=
es, my darlings! Hey! look=20

out! We'll run you down!"  Only now, when the extraordinary pace we were go=
ing at took my=20

breath away, I noticed that he was very drunk. He must have been drinking a=
t the station. At the=20

bottom of the descent there was the crash of ice; a piece of dirty frozen s=
now thrown up from the=20

road hit me a painful blow in the face.  The runaway horses ran up the hill=
 as rapidly as they had=20

downhill, and before I had time to shout to Nikanor my sledge was flying al=
ong on the level in an=20

old pine forest, and the tall pines were stretching out their shaggy white =
paws to me from all=20

directions.  "I have gone out of my mind, and the coachman's drunk," I thou=
ght. "Good!"  I found=20

Ivan Ivanitch at home. He laughed till he coughed, laid his head on my brea=
st, and said what he=20

always did say on meeting me:  "You grow younger and younger. I don't know =
what dye you use=20

for your hair and your beard; you might give me some of it."  "I've come to=
 return your call, Ivan=20

Ivanitch," I said untruthfully. "Don't be hard on me; I'm a townsman, conve=
ntional; I do keep count=20

of calls."  "I am delighted, my dear fellow. I am an old man; I like respec=
t.... Yes."  From his voice=20



and his blissfully smiling face, I could see that he was greatly flattered =
by my visit. Two peasant=20

women helped me off with my coat in the=20


_
and three of these will form the lowest fascia, four, the next, and five, t=
he highest fascia. The=20

frieze, above the architrave, is one fourth less high than the architrave, =
but if there are to be reliefs=20

upon it, it is one fourth higher than the architrave, so that the sculpture=
s may be more imposing. Its=20

cymatium is one seventh of the whole height of the frieze, and the projecti=
on of the cymatium is=20

the same as its height.  11. Over the frieze comes the line of dentils, mad=
e of the same height as=20

the middle fascia of the architrave and with a projection equal to their he=
ight. The intersection (or=20

in Greek [Greek: metope]) is apportioned so that the face of each dentil is=
 half as wide as its=20

height and the cavity of each intersection two thirds of this face in width=
. The cymatium here is one=20

sixth of the whole height of this part. The corona with its cymatium, but n=
ot including the sima, has=20

the height of the middle fascia of the architrave, and the total projection=
 of the corona and dentils=20

should be equal to the height from the frieze to the cymatium at the top of=
 the corona.  [Illustration:=20

A COMPARISON OF THE IONIC ORDER ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS WITH ACTUAL=20

EXAMPLES AND WITH VIGNOLA'S ORDER  A: Showing the orders reduced to equal l=
ower=20

diameters. B: Showing the orders to a uniform scale.]  And as a general rul=
e, all projecting parts=20

have greater beauty when their projection is equal to their height.  12. Th=
e height of the=20

tympanum, which is in the pediment, is to be obtained thus: let the front o=
f the corona, from the=20

two ends of its cymatium, be measured off into nine parts, and let one of t=
hese parts be set up in=20

the middle at the peak of the tympanum, taking care that it is perpendicula=
r to the entablature and=20

the neckings of the columns. The coronae over the tympanum are to be made o=
f equal size with=20

the coronae under it, not including the simae. Above the coronae are the si=
mae (in Greek [Greek:=20

epaietides]), which should be made one eighth higher than the height of the=
 coronae. The=20

acroteria at the corners have the height of the centre of the tympanum, and=
 those in the middle are=20

one eighth part higher than those at the corners.  13. All the members whic=
h are to be above the=20

capitals of the columns, that is, architraves, friezes, coronae, tympana, g=
ables, and acroteria,=20

should be inclined to the front a twelfth part of their own height, for the=
 reason that when we stand=20

in front of them, if two lines are drawn from the eye, one reaching to the =
bottom of the building and=20

the other to the top, that which reaches to the top will be the longer. Hen=
ce, as the line of sight to=20

the upper part is the longer, it makes that part look as if it were leaning=
 back. But when the=20

members are inclined to the front, as described above, they will seem to th=
e beholder to be plumb=20

and when Ivan Ivanitch and I went into his little study, two barefooted lit=
tle girls were sitting on the=20

floor looking at a picture-book; when they saw us they jumped up and ran aw=
ay, and a tall, thin old=20

woman in spectacles came in at once, bowed gravely to me, and picking up a =
pillow from the sofa=20

and a picture-book from the floor, went away. From the adjoining rooms we h=
eard incessant=20

whispering and the patter of bare feet.  "I am expecting the doctor to dinn=
er," said Ivan Ivanitch.=20

"He promised to come from the relief centre. Yes. He dines with me every We=
dnesday, God bless=20

him." He craned towards me and kissed me on the neck. "You have come, my de=
ar fellow, so you=20

are not vexed," he whispered, sniffing. "Don't be vexed, my dear creature. =
Yes. Perhaps it is=20

annoying, but don't be cross. My only prayer to God before I die is to live=
 in peace and harmony=20

with all in the true way. Yes."  "Forgive me, Ivan Ivanitch, I will put my =
feet on a chair," I said,=20

feeling that I was so exhausted I could not be myself; I sat further back o=
n the sofa and put up my=20

feet on an arm-chair. My face was burning from the snow and the wind, and I=
 felt as though my=20

whole body were basking in the warmth and growing weaker from it.  "It's ve=
ry nice here," I went=20



on--"warm, soft, snug... and goose-feather pens," I laughed, looking at the=
 writing-table; "sand=20

instead of blotting-paper."  "Eh? Yes... yes.... The writing-table and the =
mahogany cupboard here=20

were made for my father by a self-taught cabinet-maker--Glyeb Butyga, a ser=
f of General=20

Zhukov's. Yes... a great artist in his own way."  Listlessly and in the ton=
e of a man dropping=20

asleep, he began telling me about cabinet-maker Butyga. I listened. Then Iv=
an Ivanitch went into=20

the next room to show me a polisander wood chest of drawers remarkable for =
its beauty and=20

cheapness. He tapped the chest with his fingers, then called my attention t=
o a stove of patterned=20

tiles, such as one never sees now. He tapped the stove, too, with his finge=
rs. There was an=20

atmosphere of good-natured simplicity and well-fed abundance about the ches=
t of drawers, the=20

tiled stove, the low chairs, the pictures embroidered in wool and silk on c=
anvas in solid, ugly=20

frames. When one remembers that all those objects were standing in the same=
 places and=20

precisely in the same order when I was a little child, and used to come her=
e to name-day parties=20

with my mother, it is simply unbelievable that they could ever cease to exi=
st.  I thought what a=20

fearful difference between Butyga and me! Butyga who made things, above all=
, solidly and=20

substantially, and seeing in that his chief object, gave to length of life =
peculiar significance, had no=20

thought of death, and probably hardly believed in its possibility; I, when =
I built my bridges of iron=20

and stone which would last a thousand years, could=20


_
14. Each column should have twenty-four flutes, channelled out in such a wa=
y that if a carpenter's=20

square be placed in the hollow of a flute and turned, the arm will touch th=
e corners of the fillets on=20

the right and left, and the tip of the square may keep touching some point =
in the concave surface=20

as it moves through it. The breadth of the flutes is to be equivalent to th=
e enlargement in the=20

middle of a column, which will be found in the figure.  15. In the simae wh=
ich are over the coronae=20

on the sides of the temple, lion's heads are to be carved and arranged at i=
ntervals thus: First one=20

head is marked out directly over the axis of each column, and then the othe=
rs use." If in time=20

Butyga's cupboard and my bridge should come under the notice of some sensib=
le historian of art,=20

he would say: "These were two men remarkable in their own way: Butyga loved=
 his fellow-

creatures and would not admit the thought that they might die and be annihi=
lated, and so when he=20

made his furniture he had the immortal man in his mind. The engineer Asorin=
 did not love life or=20

his fellow-creatures; even in the happy moments of creation, thoughts of de=
ath, of finiteness and=20

dissolution, were not alien to him, and we see how insignificant and finite=
, how timid and poor, are=20

these lines of his...."  "I only heat these rooms," muttered Ivan Ivanitch,=
=20


_
one at the middle of every roof-tiling. Those that are over the columns sho=
uld have holes bored=20

through them to the gutter which receives the rainwater from the tiles, but=
 those between them=20

should be solid. Thus the mass of water that falls by way of the tiles into=
 the gutter will not be=20

thrown down along the intercolumniations nor drench people who are passing =
through them, while=20

the lion's heads that are over the columns will appear to be vomiting as th=
ey discharge streams of=20

water from their mouths.  In this book I have written as clearly as I could=
 on the arrangements of=20

Ionic temples. In the next I shall explain the proportions of "Ever since m=
y wife died and my son=20

was killed in the war, I have kept the best rooms shut up. Yes... see..."  =
He opened a door, and I=20

saw a big room with four columns, an old piano, and a heap of peas on the f=
loor; it smelt cold and=20

damp.  "The garden seats are in the next room..." muttered Ivan Ivanitch. "=
There's no one to=20

dance the mazurka now.... I've shut them up."  We heard a noise. It was Dr.=
 Sobol arriving. While=20

he was rubbing his cold hands and stroking his wet beard, I had time to not=
ice in the first place=20

that he had a very dull life, and so was pleased to see Ivan Ivanitch and m=
e; and, secondly, that=20

he was a naive and=20

ror, that many in=20

their treatises and volumes of commentaries on architecture have not presen=
ted the subject with=20

well-ordered completeness, but have merely made a beginning and left, as it=
 were, only desultory=20

fragments. I have therefore thought that it would be a man. He looked at me=
 as though I were very=20

glad to see him and very much interested in him.  "I have not slept for two=
 nights," he said, looking=20

at me naively and stroking his beard. "One night with a confinement, and th=
e next I stayed at a=20

u know."  With an=20
