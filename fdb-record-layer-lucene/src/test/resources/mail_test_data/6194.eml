there are some comparatively modern works that are positively injurious so =

comprehension of even exoteric Buddhism is concerned. Such are the _Buddhis=

others.      SECTION XLVIII. AMITA BUDDHA KWAN-SHAI-YIN, AND KWAN-YIN.--WHA=
T THE=20

"BOOK OF DZYAN" AND THE LAMASERIES OF TSONG-KHA-PA SAY.   As a supplement t=
o the=20

_Commentaries_ there are many secret folios on the lives of the Buddhas and=
 Bodhisattvas, and=20

among these there is one on Prince Gautama and another on His reincarnation=
 in Tsong-Kha-pa.=20

This great Tibetan Reformer of the fourteenth century, said to be a direct =
incarnation of Amita=20

Buddha, is the founder of the secret School near Tji- gad-je, attached to t=
he private retreat of the=20

Teshu Lama. It is with Him that began the regular system of Lamaic incarnat=
ions of Buddhas=20

(Sang- gyas), or of Shakya-Thub-pa (Shakya-muni). Amida or Amita Buddha is =
called by the=20

author of _Chinese Buddhism_, a mythical being. He speaks of       Amida Bu=
ddha (_Ami-to Fo_)=20

a fabulous personage, worshipped     assiduously--like Kwan-yin--by the Nor=
thern Buddhists, but=20

unknown     in Siam, Burmah, and Ceylon.(723)   Very likely. Yet Amida Budd=
ha is not a "fabulous"=20

personage, since (_a_) "Amida" is the Senzar form of "Adi"; "Adi-Buddhi" an=
d "Adi-Buddha,"(724)=20

as already shown, existed ages ago as a Sanskrit term for "Primeval Soul" a=
nd "Wisdom"; and=20

(_b_) the name was applied to Gautama Shakyamuni, the last Buddha in India,=
 from the seventh=20

century, when Buddhism was introduced into Tibet. "Amitabha" (in Chinese, "=
Wu-liang-sheu")=20

means literally "Boundless Age," a synonym of "En," or "Ain-Suph," the "Anc=
ient of Days," and is=20

an epithet that connects Him directly with the Boundless Adi-Buddhi (primev=
al and Universal Soul)=20

of the Hindus, as well as with the Anima Mundi of all the ancient nations o=
f Europe and the=20

Boundless and Infinite of the Kabalists. If Amitabha be a fiction of the Ti=
betans, or a new form of=20

Wu-liang-sheu, "a fabulous personage," as the author-compiler of _Chinese B=
uddhism_ tells his=20

readers, then the "fable" must be a very ancient one. For on another page h=
e says himself that the=20

addition to the canon, of the books containing the       Legends of Kwan-yi=
n and of the Western=20

heaven with its Buddha,     Amitabha, was also previous to the Council of K=
ashmere, a little=20

before the beginning of our era,(725)   and he places       the origin of t=
he primitive Buddhist books=20

which are common to the     Northern and Southern Buddhists before 246 B.C.=
   Since Tibetans=20

accepted Buddhism only in the seventh century A.D., how comes it that they =
are charged with=20

inventing Amita-Buddha? Besides which, in Tibet, Amitabha is called Odpag-m=
ed, which shows=20

that it is not the name but the abstract idea that was first accepted of an=
 unknown, invisible, and=20

Impersonal Power--taken, moreover, from the Hindu "Adi- Buddhi," and not fr=
om the Chinese=20

"Amitabha."(726) There is a great difference between the popular Odpag-med =
(Amitabha) who sits=20

enthroned in Devachan (Sukhavati), according to the _Mani Kambum_ Scripture=
s--the oldest=20

_historical_ work in Tibet, and the philosophical abstraction called Amida =
Buddha, the name being=20

passed now to the earthly Buddha, Gautama.      SECTION XLIX. TSONG-KHA-PA.=
--LOHANS IN=20

CHINA.   In an article, "Reincarnation in Tibet," everything that could be =
said about Tsong-Kha-pa=20

was published.(727) It was stated that this reformer was not, as is alleged=
 by Parsi scholars, an=20

incarnation of one of the celestial Dhyanis, or the five heavenly Buddhas, =
said to have been=20

created by Shakyamuni after he had risen to Nirvana, but that he was an inc=
arnation of Amita=20

Buddha Himself. The records preserved in the Gon-pa, the chief Lamasery of =
Tda-shi-Hlumpo,=20



show that Sang-gyas left the regions of the "Western Paradise" to incarnate=
 Himself in Tsong-Kha-

pa, in consequence of the great degradation into which His secret doctrines=
 had fallen.=20

Whenever made too public, the Good Law of Cheu [magical powers]     fell in=
variably into sorcery=20

or "black magic." The Dwijas, the     Hoshang [Chinese monks] and the Lamas=
 could alone be=20

entrusted     safely with the formulae.   Until the Tsong-Kha-pa period the=
re had been no Sang-

gyas (Buddha) incarnations in Tibet.  Tsong-Kha-pa gave the signs whereby t=
he presence of one=20

of the twenty-five Bodhisattvas(728) or of the Celestial Buddhas (Dhyan Cho=
hans) in a human=20

body might be recognized, and He strictly forbade necromancy. This led to a=
 split amongst the=20

Lamas, and the malcontents allied themselves with the aboriginal Bhons agai=
nst the reformed=20

Lamaism. Even now they form a powerful sect, practising the most disgusting=
 rites all over=20

Sikkhim, Bhutan, Nepaul, and even on the borderlands of Tibet. It was worse=
 then. With the=20

permission of the Tda-shu or Teshu Lama,(729) some hundred Lohans (Arhats),=
 to avert strife,=20

went to settle in China in the famous monastery near Tien-t'-ai, where they=
 soon became subjects=20

for legendary lore, and continue to be so to this day. They had been alread=
y preceded by other=20

Lohans,       The world-famous disciples of Tathagata, called the "sweet-vo=
iced"     on account of=20

their ability to chant the Mantras with magical     effect.(730)   The firs=
t ones came from Kashmir in=20

the year 3,000 of Kali Yuga (about a century before the Christian era),(731=
) while the last ones=20

arrived at the end of the fourteenth century, 1,500 years later; and, findi=
ng no room for themselves=20

at the lamasery of Yihigching, they built for their own use the largest mon=
astery of all on the=20

sacred island of Pu-to (Buddha, or Put, in Chinese), in the province of Chu=
san. There the Good=20

Law, the "Doctrine of the Heart," flourished for several centuries. But whe=
n the island was=20

desecrated by a mass of Western foreigners, the chief Lohans left for the m=
ountains of ----. In the=20

Pagoda of Pi-yun-ti, near Pekin, one can still see the "Hall of the Five-hu=
ndred Lohans." There the=20

statues of the first- comers are arranged below, while one solitary Lohan i=
s placed quite under the=20

roof of the building, which seems to have been built in commemoration of th=
eir visit.  The works of=20

the Orientalists are full of the direct landmarks of Arhats (Adepts), posse=
ssed of thaumaturgic=20

powers, but these are spoken of--whenever the subject cannot be avoided--wi=
th unconcealed=20

scorn. Whether innocently ignorant of, or purposely ignoring, the importanc=
e of the Occult element=20

and symbology in the various Religions they undertake to explain, short wor=
k is generally made of=20

such passages, and they are left untranslated. In simple justice, however, =
it should be allowed that=20

much as all such miracles may have been exaggerated by popular reverence an=
d fancy, they are=20

neither less credible nor less attested in "heathen" annals than are those =
of the numerous=20

Christian Saints in the church chronicles. Both have an equal right to a pl=
ace in their respective=20

histories.  If, after the beginning of persecution against Buddhism, the Ar=
hats were no more heard=20

of in India, it was because, their vows prohibiting retaliation, they had t=
o leave the country and=20

seek solitude and security in China, Tibet, Japan, and elsewhere. The sacer=
dotal powers of the=20

Brahmans being at that time unlimited, the Simons and Apolloniuses of Buddh=
ism had as much=20

chance of recognition and appreciation by the Brahmanical Irenaeuses and Te=
rtullians as had their=20

successors in the Judaean and Roman worlds. It was a historical rehearsal o=
f the dramas that=20

were enacted centuries later in Christendom. As in the case of the so- call=
ed "Heresiarchs" of=20

Christianity, it was not for rejecting the _Vedas_ or the sacred Syllable t=
hat the Buddhist Arhats=20

were persecuted, but for understanding too well the secret meaning of both.=
 It was simply because=20



their knowledge was regarded as dangerous and their presence in India unwel=
come, that they had=20

to emigrate.  Nor were there a smaller number of Initiates among the Brahma=
ns themselves. Even=20

to-day one meets most wonderfully-gifted Saddhus and Yogis, obliged to keep=
 themselves=20

unnoticed and in the shadow, not only owing to the absolute secresy imposed=
 upon them at their=20

Initiation but also for fear of the Anglo-Indian tribunals and courts of la=
w, wherein judges are=20

determined to regard as charlatanry, imposition, and fraud, the exhibition =
of, or claim to, any=20

abnormal powers, and one may judge of the past by the present. Centuries af=
ter our era the=20

Initiates of the inner temples and the Mathams (monastic communities) chose=
 a superior council,=20

presided over by an all-powerful Brahm-Atma, the Supreme Chief of all those=
 Mahatmas. This=20

pontificate could be exercised only by a Brahman who had reached a certain =
age, and he it was=20

who was the sole guardian of the mystic formula, and he was the Hierophant =
who created great=20

Adepts. He alone could explain the meaning of the sacred word, AUM, and of =
all the religious=20

symbols and rites. And whosoever among those Initiates of the Supreme Degre=
e revealed to a=20

profane a single one of the truths, even the smallest of the secrets entrus=
ted to him, had to die;=20

and he who received the confidence was put to death.  But there existed, an=
d still exists to this=20

day, a Word far surpassing the mysterious monosyllable, and which renders h=
im who comes into=20

possession of its key nearly the equal of Brahman. The Brahmatmas alone pos=
sess this key, and=20

we know that to this day there are two great Initiates in Southern India wh=
o possess it. It can be=20

passed only at death, for it is the "Lost Word." No torture, no human power=
, could force its=20

disclosure by a Brahman who knows it; and it is well guarded in Tibet.  Yet=
 this secresy and this=20

profound mystery are indeed disheartening, since they alone--the Initiates =
of India and Tibet--

could thoroughly dissipate the thick mists hanging over the history of Occu=
ltism, and force its=20

claims to be recognized. The Delphic injunction, "_Know thyself_," seems fo=
r the few in this age.=20

But the fault ought not to be laid at the door of the Adepts, who have done=
 all that could be done,=20

and have gone as far as Their rules permitted, to open the eyes of the worl=
d. Only while the=20

European shrinks from public obloquy and the ridicule unsparingly thrown on=
 Occultists, the=20

Asiatic is being discouraged by his own Pandits. These profess to labour un=
der the gloomy=20

impression that no Biga Vidya, no Arhatship (Adeptship), is possible during=
 the Kali Yuga (the=20

"Black Age") we are now passing through. Even the Buddhists are taught that=
 the Lord Buddha is=20

alleged to have prophesied that the power would die out in "one millennium =
after His death." But=20

this is an entire mistake. In the _Digha Nikaya_ the Buddha says:       Hea=
r, Subhadra! The world=20

will never be without Rahats, if the     ascetics in my congregations well =
and truly keep my=20

precepts.   A similar contradiction of the view brought forward by the Brah=
mans is made by=20

Krishna in the _Bhagavad Gita_, and there is further the actual appearance =
of many Saddhus and=20

miracle-workers in the past, and even in the present age. The same holds go=
od for China and=20

Tibet. Among the commandments of Tsong-Kha-pa there is one that enjoins the=
 Rahats (Arhats)=20

to make an attempt to enlighten the world, including the "white barbarians,=
" every century, at a=20

certain specified period of the cycle. Up to the present day none of these =
attempts has been very=20

successful. Failure has followed failure. Have we to explain the fact by th=
e light of a certain=20

prophecy? It is said that up to the time when Pban-chhen-rin-po- chhe (the =
Great Jewel of=20

Wisdom)(732) condescends to be reborn in the land of the P'helings (Western=
ers), and appearing=20

as the Spiritual Conqueror (Chom-den-da), destroys the errors and ignorance=
 of the ages, it will be=20



of little use to try to uproot the misconceptions of P'heling-pa (Europe): =
her sons will listen to no=20

one. Another prophecy declares that the Secret Doctrine shall remain in all=
 its purity in Bhod-yul=20

(Tibet), only to the day that it is kept free from foreign invasion. The ve=
ry visits of Western natives,=20

however friendly, would be baneful to the Tibetan populations. This is the =
true key to Tibetan=20

exclusiveness.      SECTION L. A FEW MORE MISCONCEPTIONS CORRECTED.=20

Notwithstanding widespread misconceptions and errors--often most amusing to=
 one who has a=20

certain knowledge of the true doctrines--about Buddhism generally, and espe=
cially about=20

Buddhism in Tibet, all the Orientalists agree that the Buddha's foremost ai=
m was to lead human=20

beings to salvation by teaching them to practise the greatest purity and vi=
rtue, and by detaching=20

them from the service of this illusionary world, and the love of one's stil=
l more illusionary--because=20

so evanescent and unreal--body and physical self. And what is the good of a=
 virtuous life, full of=20

privations and suffering, if the only result of it is to be annihilation at=
 the end? If even the=20

attainment of that supreme perfection which leads the Initiate to remember =
the whole series of his=20

past lives, and to foresee that of the future ones, by the full development=
 of that inner, divine eye=20

in him, and to acquire the knowledge that unfolds the causes(733) of the ev=
er- recurring cycles of=20

existence, brings him finally to non-being, and nothing more--then the whol=
e system is idiotic, and=20

Epicureanism is far more philosophical than _such_ Buddhism. He who is unab=
le to comprehend=20

the subtle, and yet so potent, difference between existence in a material o=
r physical state and a=20

purely spiritual existence--Spirit or "Soul- life"--will never appreciate a=
t their full value the grand=20

teachings of the Buddha, even in their exoteric form. Individual or persona=
l existence is the cause=20

of pains and sorrows; collective and impersonal life-eternal is full of div=
ine bliss and joy for ever,=20

with neither causes nor effects to darken its light. And the hope for such =
a life-eternal is the=20

keynote of the whole of Buddhism. If we are told that impersonal existence =
is no existence at all,=20

but amounts to annihilation, as was maintained by some French reincarnation=
ists, then we would=20

ask: What difference can it make in the spiritual perceptions of an Ego whe=
ther he enter Nirvana=20

loaded with the recollections only of his own personal lives--tens of thous=
ands according to the=20

modern reincarnationists--or whether, merged entirely in the Parabrahmic st=
ate it becomes one=20

with the All, with the absolute knowledge and the absolute feeling of repre=
senting collective=20

humanities? Once that an Ego lives only ten distinct individual lives he mu=
st necessarily lose his=20

one self, and become mixed up--merged, so to say--with these ten selves. It=
 really seems that so=20

long as this great mystery remains a dead-letter to the world of Western th=
inkers, and especially to=20

the Orientalists, the less the latter undertake to explain it the better fo=
r Truth.  Of all the existing=20

religious Philosophies, Buddhism is the least understood. The Lassens, Webe=
rs, Wassiljows, the=20

Burnoufs and Juliens, and even such "eye-witnesses" of Tibetan Buddhism as =
Csoma de Koeros=20

and the Schlagintweits, have hitherto only added perplexity to confusion. N=
one of these has ever=20

received his information from a genuine Gelugpa source: all have judged Bud=
dhism from the bits=20

of knowledge picked up at Tibetan frontier lamaseries, in countries thickly=
 populated by Bhutanese=20

and Leptchas, Bhons, and red-capped Dugpas, along the line of the Himalayas=
. Hundreds of=20

volumes purchased from Burats, Shamans, and Chinese Buddhists, have been re=
ad and=20

translated, glossed and misinterpreted according to invariable custom. Esot=
eric Schools would=20

cease to be worthy of their name were their literature and doctrines to bec=
ome the property of=20

even their profane co-religionists--still less of the Western public. This =
is simple common-sense=20



and logic. Nevertheless this is a fact which our Orientalists have ever ref=
used to recognize: hence=20

they have gone on, gravely discussing the relative merits and absurdities o=
f idols, "sooth-saying=20

tables," and "magical figures of Phurbu" on the "square tortoise." None of =
these have anything to=20

do with the real philosophical Buddhism of the Gelugpa, or even of the most=
 educated among the=20

Sakyapa and Kadampa sects. All such "plates" and sacrificial tables, Chinsr=
eg magical circles,=20

etc., were avowedly got from Sikkhim, Bhutan, and Eastern Tibet, from Bhons=
 and Dugpas.=20

Nevertheless, these are given as characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism! It wo=
uld be as fair to judge=20

the unread Philosophy of Bishop Berkeley after studying Christianity in the=
 clown-worship of=20

Neapolitan lazzaroni, dancing a mystic jig before the idol of St. Pip, or c=
arrying the _ex-voto_ in=20

wax of the phallus of SS. Cosmo and Domiano, at Tsernie.  It is quite true =
that the primitive=20

Shravakas (listeners or hearers) and the Shramanas (the "thought-restrainer=
s" and the "pure")=20

have degenerated, and that many Buddhist sects have fallen into mere dogmat=
ism and ritualism.=20

Like every other Esoteric, half-suppressed teaching, the words of the Buddh=
a convey a double=20

meaning, and every sect has gradually come to claim to be the only one know=
ing the correct=20

meaning, and thus to assume supremacy over the rest. Schism has crept in, a=
nd has fastened,=20

like a hideous cancer, on the fair body of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's Maha=
yana ("Great=20

Vehicle") School was opposed by the Hinayana (or "Little Vehicle") System, =
and even the=20

Yogacharya of Aryasanga became disfigured by the yearly pilgrimage from Ind=
ia to the shores of=20

Mansarovara, of hosts of vagabonds with matted locks who play at being Yogi=
s and Fakirs,=20

preferring this to work. An affected detestation of the world, and the tedi=
ous and useless practice=20

of the counting of inhalations and exhalations as a means to produce absolu=
te tranquillity of mind=20

or meditation, have brought this school within the region of Hatha Yoga, an=
d have made it heir to=20

the Brahmanical Tirthikas. And though its Srotapatti, its Sakridagamin, Ana=
gamin, and=20

Arhats,(734) bear the same names in almost every school, yet the doctrines =
of each differ greatly,=20

and none of these is likely to gain real Abhijnas (the supernatural abnorma=
l five powers).  One of=20

the chief mistakes of the Orientalists when judging on "internal (?) eviden=
ce," as they express it,=20

was that they assumed that the Pratyeka Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas, and the =
"Perfect" Buddhas=20

were a later development of Buddhism. For on these three chief degrees are =
based the seven and=20

twelve degrees of the Hierarchy of Adeptship. The first are those who have =
attained the Bodhi=20

(wisdom) of the Buddhas, but do not become Teachers.(735) The human Bodhisa=
ttvas are=20

candidates, so to say, for perfect Buddhaship (in Kalpas to come), and with=
 the option of using=20

their powers now if need be. "Perfect" Buddhas are simply "perfect" Initiat=
es. All these are men,=20

and not disembodied Beings, as is given out in the Hinayana exoteric books.=
 Their correct=20

character may be found only in the secret volumes of Lugrub or Nagarjuna, t=
he founder of the=20

Mahayana system, who is said to have been initiated by the Nagas (fabulous =
"Serpents," the=20

veiled name for an Initiate or Mahatma). The fabled report found in Chinese=
 records that=20

Nagarjuna considered his doctrine to be in opposition to that of Gautama Bu=
ddha, until he=20

discovered from the Nagas that it was precisely the doctrine that had been =
secretly taught by=20

Shakyamuni Himself, is an allegory, and is based upon the reconciliation be=
tween the old=20

Brahmanical secret Schools in the Himalayas and Gautama's Esoteric teaching=
s, both parties=20

having at first objected to the rival schools of the other. The former, the=
 parent of all others, had=20

been established beyond the Himalayas for ages before the appearance of Sha=
kyamuni. Gautama=20



was a pupil of this; and it was with them, those Indian Sages, that He had =
learned the truths of the=20

Sungata, the emptiness and impermanence of every terrestrial, evanescent th=
ing, and the=20

mysteries of Prajna Paramita, or "knowledge across the River," which finall=
y lands the "Perfect=20

One" in the regions of the One Reality. But His Arhats were not Himself. So=
me of them were=20

ambitious, and they modified certain teachings after the great councils, an=
d it is on account of=20

these "heretics" that the Mother-School at first refused to allow them to b=
lend their schools, when=20

persecution began driving away the Esoteric Brotherhood from India. But whe=
n finally most of=20

them submitted to the guidance and control of the chief Ashrams, then the Y=
ogacharya of=20

Aryasanga was merged into the oldest Lodge. For it is _there_ from time imm=
emorial that has lain=20

concealed the final hope and light of the world, the salvation of mankind. =
Many are the names of=20

that School and land, the name of the latter being now regarded by the Orie=
ntalists as the mythic=20

name of a fabulous country. It is from this mysterious land, nevertheless, =
that the Hindu expects=20

his Kalki Avatara, the Buddhist his Maitreya, the Parsi his Sosiosh, and th=
e Jew his Messiah, and=20

so would the Christian expect thence his Christ--if he only knew of it.  Th=
ere, and there alone,=20

reigns Paranishpanna (Gunggrub), the absolutely perfect comprehension of Be=
ing and Non-Being,=20

the changeless true Existence in Spirit, even while the latter is seemingly=
 still in the body, every=20

inhabitant thereof being a Non-Ego because he has become the Perfect Ego. T=
heir voidness is=20

"self-existent and perfect"--if there were profane eyes to sense and percei=
ve it--because it has=20

become absolute; the unreal being transformed into conditionless Reality, a=
nd the realities of this,=20

our world, having vanished in their own nature into thin (non-existing) air=
. The "Absolute Truth"=20

(Dondam-pay-den-pa; Sanskrit: Paramarthasatya), having conquered "relative =
truth" (Kunza-bchi-

den-pa; Sanskrit: Samvritisatya), the inhabitants of the mysterious region =
are thus supposed to=20

have reached the state called in mystic phraseology Svasamvedana ("self-ana=
lyzing reflection")=20

and Paramartha, or that absolute consciousness of the personal merged into =
the impersonal Ego,=20

which is above all, hence above illusion in every sense. Its "Perfect" Budd=
has and Bodhisattvas=20

may be on every nimble Buddhist tongue as celestial--therefore unreachable =
Beings, while these=20

names may suggest and say nothing to the dull perceptions of the European p=
rofane. What=20

matters it to Those who, being in this world, yet live outside and far beyo=
nd our illusive earth!=20

Above Them there is but one class of Nirvanis, namely, the Chos-ku (Dharmak=
aya), or the=20

Nirvanis "without remains"--the pure Arupa, the formless Breaths.(736)  The=
nce emerge=20

occasionally the Bodhisattvas in their Prul-pai-ku (or Nirmanakaya) body an=
d, assuming an=20

ordinary appearance, they teach men. There are conscious, as well as uncons=
cious, incarnations.=20

Most of the doctrines contained in the Yogacharya, or Mahayana systems are =
Esoteric, like the=20

rest. One day the profane Hindu and Buddhist may begin to pick the _Bible_ =
to pieces, taking it=20

literally. Education is fast spreading in Asia, and already there have been=
 made some attempts in=20

this direction, so that the tables may then be cruelly turned on the Christ=
ians. Whatever=20

conclusions the two may arrive at, they will never be half as absurd and un=
just as some of the=20

theories launched by Christians against their respective Philosophies. Thus=
, according to Spence=20

Hardy, at death the Arhat enters Nirvana:       That is, he ceases to exist=
.   And, agreeably to Major=20

Jacob, the Jivanmukta,       Absorbed into Brahma, enters upon an unconscio=
us and stonelike=20

existence.(737)   Shankaracharya is shown as saying in his prolegomena to t=
he=20

_Shvetashvatara:_       Gnosis, once arisen, requires nothing farther for t=
he realization     of its=20



result: it needs _subsidia_ only that it may arise.   The Theosophist, it h=
as been argued, as long as=20

he lives, may do good and evil as he chooses, and incur no stain, such is t=
he efficacy of gnosis.=20

And it is further alleged that the doctrine of Nirvana lends itself to immo=
ral inferences, and that the=20

Quietists of all ages have been taxed with immorality.(738)  According to W=
assilyew(739) and=20

Csoma de Koeros,(740) the Prasanga School adopted a peculiar mode of       =
Deducing the=20

absurdity and erroneousness of every esoteric     opinion.(741)   Correct i=
nterpretations of=20

Buddhist Philosophy are crowned by that gloss on a thesis from the Prasanga=
 School, that=20

Even an Arhat goes to hell in case he doubt anything,(742)   thus making of=
 the most free-thinking=20

religion in the world a blind-faith system. The "threat" refers simply to t=
he well-known law that even=20

an Initiate may fail, and thus have his object utterly ruined, if he doubt =
for one moment the efficacy=20

of his psychic powers--the alphabet of Occultism, as every Kabalist well kn=
ows.  The Tibetan sect=20

of the Ngo-vo-nyid-med par Mraba ("they who deny existence," or "regard nat=
ure as Maya")(743)=20

can never be contrasted for one moment with some of the nihilistic or mater=
ialistic schools of India,=20

such as the Charvaka. They are pure Vedantins--if anything--in their views.=
 And if the=20

Yogacharyas may be compared with, or called the Tibetan Vishishtadwaitis, t=
he Prasanga School=20

is surely the Adwaita Philosophy of the land. It was divided into two: one =
was originally founded by=20

Bhavya, the Svantatra Madhyamika School, and the other by Buddhapalita; bot=
h have their=20

exoteric and esoteric divisions. It is necessary to belong to the latter to=
 know anything of the=20

esoteric doctrines of that sect, the most metaphysical and philosophical of=
 all. Chandrakirti (Dava=20

Dagpa) wrote his commentaries on the Prasanga doctrines and taught publicly=
; and he expressly=20

states that there are two ways of entering the "Path" to Nirvana. Any virtu=
ous man can reach by=20

Naljorngonsum ("meditation by self- perception"), the intuitive comprehensi=
on of the four Truths,=20

without either belonging to a monastic order or having been initiated. In t=
his case it was=20

considered as a heresy to maintain that the visions which may arise in cons=
equence of such=20

meditation, or Vishna (internal knowledge), are not susceptible of errors (=
Namtog or false visions),=20

for they are. Alaya alone having an absolute and eternal existence, can alo=
ne have absolute=20

knowledge; and even the Initiate, in his Nirmanakaya(744) body may commit a=
n occasional=20

mistake in accepting the false for the true in his explorations of the "Cau=
seless" World. The=20

Dharmakaya Bodhisattva is alone infallible, when in real Samadhi. Alaya, or=
 Nying-po, being the=20

root and basis of all, invisible and incomprehensible to human eye and inte=
llect, it can reflect only=20

its reflection--not Itself. Thus that reflection will be mirrored like the =
moon in tranquil and clear=20

water only in the passionless Dharmakaya intellect, and will be distorted b=
y the flitting image of=20

everything perceived in a mind that is itself liable to be disturbed.  In s=
hort, this doctrine is that of=20

the Raj-Yoga in its practice of the two kinds of the Samadhi state; one of =
the "Paths" leading to the=20

sphere of bliss (Sukhavati or Devachan), where man enjoys perfect, unalloye=
d happiness, but is=20

yet still connected with personal existence; and the other the Path that le=
ads to entire=20

emancipation from the worlds of illusion, self, and unreality. The first on=
e is open to all and is=20

reached by merit simply; the second--a hundredfold more rapid--is reached t=
hrough knowledge=20

(Initiation). Thus the followers of the Prasanga School are nearer to Esote=
ric Buddhism than are=20

the Yogacharyas; for their views are those of the most secret Schools, and =
only the echo of these=20

doctrines is heard in the _Yamyangshapda_ and other works in public circula=
tion and use. For=20

instance, the unreality of two out of the three divisions of time is given =
in public works, namely=20



(_a_) that there is neither past nor future, both of these divisions being =
correlative to the present;=20

and (_b_) that the reality of things can never be sensed or perceived excep=
t by him who has=20

obtained the Dharmakaya body; here again is a difficulty, since this body "=
without remains" carries=20

the Initiate to full Paranirvana, if we accept the exoteric explanation ver=
bally, and can therefore=20

neither sense nor perceive. But evidently our Orientalists do not feel the =
_caveat_ in such=20

incongruities, and they proceed to speculate without pausing to reflect ove=
r it. Literature on=20

Mysticism being enormous, and Russia, owing to the free intercourse with th=
e Burats, Shamans,=20

and Mongolians, having alone purchased whole libraries on Tibet, scholars o=
ught to know better=20

by this time. It suffices to read, however, what Csoma wrote on the origin =
of the Kala Chakra=20

System,(745) or Wassilyew on Buddhism, to make one give up every hope of se=
eing them go=20

below the rind of the "forbidden fruit." When Schlagintweit is found saying=
 that Tibetan Mysticism=20

is not Yoga--       That abstract devotion by which supernatural powers are=
     acquired,(746)   as=20

Yoga is defined by Wilson, but that it is closely related to Siberian Shama=
nism, and is "almost=20

identical with the Tantrika ritual"; and that the Tibetan _Zung_ is the "_D=
haranis_," and the _Gyut_=20

only the _Tantras_--pre-Christian Tantra being judged by the ritual of the =
modern Tantrikas--one=20

seems almost justified in suspecting our materialistic Orientalists of acti=
ng as the best friends and=20

allies of the missionaries. Whatever is not known to our geographers seems =
to be a non-existent=20

locality. Thus:       Mysticism is reported to have originated in the fabul=
ous country,     Sambhala....=20

Csoma, from _careful_ investigations, places this     [fabulous?] country b=
eyond the Sir Daria=20

[Yaxartes] between 45 deg.     and 50 deg. north latitude. It was first kno=
wn in India in the year=20

965 A.D., and was introduced ... into Tibet from India, _via_     Kashmir, =
in the year 1025=20

A.D.(747)   "It" meaning the "Dus-kyi Khorlo," or Tibetan Mysticism. A syst=
em as old as man,=20

known in India and practised before Europe had become a continent, "was fir=
st known," we are=20

told, only nine or ten centuries ago! The text of its books in its present =
form may have "originated"=20

even later, for there are numerous such texts that have been tampered with =
by sects to suit the=20

fancies of each. But who has read the original book on Dus-Kyi Khorlo, re-w=
ritten by Tsong-Kha-

pa, with his Commentaries? Considering that this grand Reformer burnt every=
 book on Sorcery on=20

which he could lay his hands in 1387, and that he has left a whole library =
of his own works--not a=20

tenth part of which has ever been made known--such statements as those abov=
e-quoted are, to=20

say the least, premature. The idea is also cherished--from a happy hypothes=
is offered by Abbe=20

Huc--that Tsong-Kha-pa derived his wisdom and acquired his extraordinary po=
wers from his=20

intercourse with a stranger from the West, "remarkable for a long nose." Th=
is stranger is believed=20

by the good Abbe "to have been a European missionary"; hence the remarkable=
 resemblance of=20

the religious ritual in Tibet to the Roman Catholic service. The sanguine "=
Lama of Jehovah" does=20

not say, however, who were the five foreigners who appeared in Tibet in the=
 year 371 of our era,=20

to disappear as suddenly and mysteriously as they came, after leaving with =
King Thothori-Nyang-

tsan instructions how to use certain things in a casket that "had fallen fr=
om heaven" in his=20

presence precisely fifty years before, or in the year A.D. 331.(748)  There=
 is generally a hopeless=20

confusion about Eastern dates among European scholars, but nowhere is this =
so great as in the=20

case of Tibetan Buddhism. Thus, while some, correctly enough, accept the se=
venth century as the=20

date of the introduction of Buddhism, there are others--such as Lassen and =
Koeppung, for=20

instance--who show on good authority, the one, the construction of a Buddhi=
st monastery on the=20



slopes of the Kailas Range so far back as the year 137 B.C.,(749) and the o=
ther, Buddhism=20

established in and north of the Punjab, as early as the year 292 B.C. The d=
ifference though trifling-

-only just one thousand years--is nevertheless puzzling. But even this is e=
asily explained on=20

Esoteric grounds. Buddhism--the veiled Esotericism of Buddha--was establish=
ed and took root in=20

the seventh century of the Christian era; while true Esoteric Buddhism, or =
the kernel, the very spirit=20

of Tathagata's doctrines, was brought to the place of its birth, the cradle=
 of humanity, by the=20

chosen Arhats of Buddha, who were sent to find for it a secure refuge, as  =
     The Sage had=20

perceived the dangers ever since he had entered upon     Thonglam ("the Pat=
h of seeing," or=20

clairvoyance).   Amidst populations deeply steeped in Sorcery the attempt p=
roved a failure; and it=20

was not until the School of the "Doctrine of the Heart" had merged with its=
 predecessor,=20

established ages earlier on the slope facing Western Tibet, that Buddhism w=
as finally engrafted,=20

with its two distinct Schools--the Esoteric and the exoteric divisions--in =
the land of the Bhon- pa.=20

SECTION LI. THE "DOCTRINE OF THE EYE" & THE "DOCTRINE OF THE HEART," OR THE=
=20

"HEART'S SEAL."   Prof. Albrecht Weber was right when he declared that the =
Northern Buddhists=20

Alone possess these [Buddhist] Scriptures complete.   For, while the Southe=
rn Buddhists have no=20

idea of the existence of an Esoteric Doctrine--enshrined like a pearl withi=
n the shell of every=20

religion--the Chinese and the Tibetans have preserved numerous records of t=
he fact. Degenerate,=20

fallen as is now the Doctrine publicly preached by Gautama, it is yet prese=
rved in those=20

monasteries in China that are placed beyond the reach of visitors. And thou=
gh for over two=20

millennia every new "reformer," taking something out of the original has re=
placed it by some=20

speculation of his own, still truth lingers even now among the masses. But =
it is only in the Trans-

Himalayan fastnesses--loosely called Tibet--in the most inaccessible spots =
of desert and=20

mountain, that the Esoteric "Good Law"--the "Heart's Seal"--lives to the pr=
esent day in all its=20

pristine purity.  Was Emanuel Swedenborg wrong when he remarked of the forg=
otten, long-lost=20

Word:       Seek for it in China; peradventure you may find it in Great    =
 Tartary.   He had obtained=20

this information, he tells his readers, from certain "Spirits," who told hi=
m that they performed their=20

worship according to this (lost) ancient Word. On this it was remarked in _=
Isis Unveiled_ that=20

Other students of Occult Sciences had more than the word of     "spirits" t=
o rely upon in this special=20

case: they have seen the     books   that contain the "Word."(750) Perchanc=
e the names of those=20

"Spirits" who visited the great Swedish Theosophist were Eastern. The word =
of a man of such=20

undeniable and recognised integrity, of one whose learning in Mathematics, =
Astronomy, the=20

natural Sciences and Philosophy was far in advance of his age, cannot be tr=
ifled with or rejected=20

as unceremoniously as if it were the statement of a modern Theosophist; fur=
ther, he claimed to=20

pass at will into that state when the Inner Self frees itself entirely from=
 every physical sense, and=20

lives and breathes in a world where every secret of Nature is an open book =
to the Soul-eye.(751)=20

Unfortunately two- thirds of his public writings are also allegorical in on=
e sense; and, as they have=20

been accepted literally, criticism has not spared the great Swedish Seer an=
y more than other=20

Seers.  Having taken a panoramic view of the hidden Sciences and Magic with=
 their Adepts in=20

Europe, Eastern Initiates must now be mentioned. If the presence of Esoteri=
cism in the Sacred=20

Scriptures of the West only now begins to be suspected, after nearly two th=
ousand years of blind=20

faith in their _verbatim_ wisdom, the same may well be granted as to the Sa=
cred Books of the=20

East. Therefore neither the Indian nor the Buddhist system can be understoo=
d without a key, nor=20



can the study of comparative Religion become a "Science" until the symbols =
of every Religion=20

yield their final secrets. At the best such a study will remain a loss of t=
ime, a playing at hide- and-

seek.  On the authority of a Japanese _Encyclopaedia_, Remusat shows the Bu=
ddha, before His=20

death, committing the secrets of His system to His disciple, Kasyapa, to wh=
om alone was=20

entrusted the sacred keeping of the Esoteric interpretation. It is called i=
n China _Ching-fa-yin-

Tsang_ ("the Mystery of the Eye of the Good Doctrine"). To any student of B=
uddhist Esotericism=20

the term, "the Mystery of the Eye," would show the absence of any Esoterici=
sm. Had the word=20

"Heart" stood in its place, then it would have meant what it now only profe=
sses to convey. The=20

"Eye Doctrine" means dogma and dead-letter form, church ritualism intended =
for those who are=20

content with exoteric formulae. The "Heart Doctrine," or the "Heart's Seal"=
 (the Sin Yin), is the only=20

real one. This may be found corroborated by Hiuen Tsang. In his translation=
 of _Maha-Prajna-

Paramita_ (_Ta-poh-je-King_), in one hundred and twenty volumes, it is stat=
ed that it was=20

Buddha's "favourite disciple Ananda," who, after his great Master had gone =
into Nirvana, was=20

commissioned by Kasyapa to promulgate "the Eye of the Doctrine," the "Heart=
" of the Law having=20

been left with the Arhats alone.  The essential difference that exists betw=
een the two--the "Eye"=20

and the "Heart," or the outward form and the hidden meaning, the cold metap=
hysics and the Divine=20

Wisdom--is clearly demonstrated in several volumes on "Chinese Buddhism," w=
ritten by sundry=20

missionaries. Having lived for years in China, they still know no more than=
 they have learned from=20

pretentious schools calling themselves esoteric, yet freely supplying the o=
pen enemies of their=20

faith with professedly ancient manuscripts and esoteric works! This ludicro=
us contradiction=20

between profession and practice has never, as it seems, struck any of the w=
estern and reverend=20

historians of other peoples' secret tenets. Thus many esoteric schools are =
mentioned in _Chinese=20

Buddhism_ by the Rev. Joseph Edkins, who believes quite sincerely that he h=
as made "a minute=20

examination" of the secret tenets of Buddhists whose works "were until late=
ly inaccessible in their=20

original form." It really will not be saying too much to state at once that=
 the genuine Esoteric=20

literature is "inaccessible" to this day, and that the respectable gentlema=
n who was inspired to=20

state that       It does not appear that there was any secret doctrine whic=
h those     who knew it=20

would not divulge,   made a great mistake if he ever believed in what he sa=
ys on page 161 of his=20

work. Let him know at once that all those Yu-luh ("Records of the Sayings")=
 of celebrated teachers=20

are simply blinds, as complete--if not more so--than those in the Puranas o=
f the Brahmans. It is=20

useless to enumerate an endless string of the finest Oriental scholars or t=
o bring forward the=20

researches of Remusat, Burnouf, Koeppen, St. Hilaire, and St. Julian, who a=
re credited with=20

having exposed to view the ancient Hindu world, by revealing the sacred and=
 secret books of=20

Buddhism: the world that they reveal has never been veiled. The mistakes of=
 all the Orientalists=20

may be judged by the mistake of one of the most popular, if not the greates=
t among them all--Prof.=20

Max Mueller. It is made with reference to what he laughingly translates as =
the "god Who" (Ka).=20

The authors of the Brahmanas had so completely broken with the     past, th=
at, forgetful of the=20

poetical character of the hymns and     the yearning of the poets after the=
 Unknown God, they=20

exalted the     interrogative pronoun itself into a deity, and acknowledged=
 a god     Ka (or Who?)...=20

Wherever interrogative verses occur the author     states that Ka is Prajap=
ati, or the Lord of=20

Creatures. Nor did     they stop here. Some of the hymns in which the inter=
rogative     pronoun=20

occurred were called Kadvat, _i.e._, having Kad or Quid.     But soon a new=
 adjective was formed,=20



and not only the hymns but     the sacrifice also offered to the god were c=
alled Kaya, or     "Who"-

ish.... At the time of Panini this word acquired such     legitimacy as to =
call for a separate rule=20

explaining its     formation. The Commentator here explains Ka by Brahman. =
  Had the=20

commentator explained It even by Parabrahman he would have been still more =
in the right than he=20

was by rendering It as "Brahman." One fails to see why the secret and sacre=
d Mystery-Name of=20

the highest, sexless, formless Spirit, the Absolute,--Whom no one would hav=
e dared to classify=20

with the rest of the manifested Deities, or even to name during the primiti=
ve nomenclature of the=20

symbolical Panthenon, should not be expressed by an interrogative pronoun. =
Is it those who=20

belong to the most anthropomorphic Religion in the world who have a right t=
o take ancient=20

Philosophers to task for even an exaggerated religious awe and veneration? =
 But we are now=20

concerned with Buddhism. Its Esotericism and oral instruction, which is wri=
tten down and=20

preserved in single copies by the highest understanding of what was taking =
place.  "My lord asks=20

of what country you are," said the young man, in the purest Castilian.  "Ic=
h bin ein Deutscher,"=20

replied the prisoner.  "What in the devil does he say?" asked the prince. "=
What new gibberish is=20

that?"  "He says he is German, my lord," replied Raoul; "but I doubt it, fo=
r his accent is bad and his=20

pronunciation defective."  "Then you speak German, also?" asked the prince.=
  "Yes, my lord."=20

"Well enough to question him in that language?"  "Yes, my lord."  "Question=
 him, then."  Raoul=20

began the examination, but the result justified his opinion. The prisoner d=
id not understand, or=20

seemed not to understand, what Raoul said to him; and Raoul could hardly un=
derstand his replies,=20

containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsatian. However, amidst all the priso=
ner's efforts to elude a=20

systematic examination, Raoul had recognized his natural accent.  "Non siet=
e Spagnuolo," he=20

said; "non siete Tedesco; siete Italiano."  The prisoner started and bit hi=
s lips.  "Ah, that," said the=20

prince, "I understand that language thoroughly; and since he is Italian I w=
ill myself continue the=20

examination. Thank you, viscount," continued the prince, laughing, "and I a=
ppoint you from this=20

moment my interpreter."  But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond=
 in Italian than in the=20

other languages; his aim was to elude the examination. Therefore, he knew n=
othing either of the=20

enemy's numbers, or of those in command, or of the purpose of the army.  "V=
ery good," said the=20

prince, understanding the reason of that ignorance; "the man was caught in =
the act of=20

assassination and robbery; he might have purchased his life by speaking; he=
 doesn't wish to=20

speak. Take him out and shoot him."  The prisoner turned pale. The two sold=
iers who had brought=20

him in took him, each by one arm, and led him toward the door, whilst the p=
rince, turning to=20

Marshal de Grammont, seemed to have already forgotten the order he had give=
n.  When he=20

reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped. The soldiers, who k=
new only their orders,=20

attempted to force him along.  "One moment," said the prisoner, in French. =
"I am ready to speak,=20

my lord."  "Ah! ah!" said the prince, laughing, "I thought we should come t=
o that. I have a sure=20

method of limbering tongues. Young men, take advantage of it against the ti=
me when you may be=20

in command."  "But on condition," continued the prisoner, "that your highne=
ss will swear that my=20

life shall be safe."  "Upon my honor," said the prince.  "Question, then, m=
y lord."  "Where did the=20

army cross the Lys?"  "Between Saint-Venant and Aire."  "By whom is it comm=
anded?"  "By Count=20

de Fuonsaldagna, General Beck and the archduke."  "Of how many does it cons=
ist?"  "Eighteen=20

thousand men and thirty-six cannon."  "And its aim is?"  "Lens."  "You see;=
 gentlemen!" said the=20

prince, turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the ot=
her officers.  "Yes,=20



my lord," said the marshal, "you have divined all that was possible to huma=
n genius."  "Recall Le=20

Plessis, Bellievre, Villequier and D'Erlac," said the prince, "recall all t=
he troops that are on this side=20

of the Lys. Let them hold themselves in readiness to march to-night. To-mor=
row, according to all=20

probability, we shall attack the enemy."  "But, my lord," said Marshal de G=
rammont, "consider that=20

when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousan=
d men."  "Monsieur le=20

marechal," said the prince, with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to=
 him, "it is with small=20

armies that great battles are won."  Then turning toward the prisoner, "Tak=
e away that man," he=20

said, "and keep him carefully in sight. His life is dependent on the inform=
ation he has given us; if it=20

is true, he shall be free; if false, let him be shot."  The prisoner was le=
d away.  "Count de Guiche,"=20

said the prince, "it is a long time since you saw your father, remain here =
with him. Monsieur," he=20

continued, addressing Raoul, "if you are not too tired, follow me."  "To th=
e end of the world, my=20

lord!" cried Raoul, feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general, w=
ho seemed to him so=20

worthy of his renown.  The prince smiled; he despised flatterers, but he ap=
preciated enthusiasts.=20

"Come, monsieur," he said, "you are good in council, as we have already dis=
covered; to-morrow=20

we shall know if you are good in action."  "And I," said the marshal, "what=
 am I to do?"  "Wait here=20

to receive the troops. I shall either return for them myself or shall send =
a courier directing you to=20

bring them to me. Twenty guards, well mounted, are all that I shall need fo=
r my escort."  "That is=20

very few," said the marshal.  "It is enough," replied the prince. "Have you=
 a good horse, Monsieur=20

de Bragelonne?"  "My horse was killed this morning, my lord, and I am mount=
ed provisionally on=20

my lackey's."  "Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best. =
No false modesty; take=20

the best horse you can find. You will need it this evening, perhaps; you wi=
ll certainly need it to-

morrow."  Raoul didn't wait to be told twice; he knew that with superiors, =
especially when those=20

superiors are princes, the highest politeness is to obey without delay or a=
rgument; he went down=20

to the stables, picked out a pie-bald Andalusian horse, saddled and bridled=
 it himself, for Athos=20

had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of d=
anger, and went to rejoin=20

the prince, who at that moment mounted his horse.  "Now, monsieur," he said=
 to Raoul, "will you=20

give me the letter you have brought?"  Raoul handed the letter to the princ=
e.  "Keep near me," said=20

the latter.  The prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle, as =
he was wont to do when=20

he wished to have both hands free, unsealed the letter of Madame de Longuev=
ille and started at a=20

gallop on the road to Lens, attended by Raoul and his small escort, whilst =
messengers sent to=20

recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions. The prince=
 read as he hastened on.=20

"Monsieur," he said, after a moment, "they tell me great things of you. I h=
ave only to say, after the=20

little that I have seen and heard, that I think even better of you than I h=
ave been told."  Raoul=20

bowed.  Meanwhile, as the little troop drew nearer to Lens, the noise of th=
e cannon sounded=20

louder. The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with t=
he steadfastness of a bird=20

of prey. One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of tre=
es which limited his=20

horizon. From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell o=
f powder, and he panted=20

like a horse.  At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident =
they were within a league=20

of the field of battle, and at a turn of the road they perceived the little=
 village of Aunay.  The=20

peasants were in great commotion. The report of Spanish cruelty had gone ou=
t and every one was=20

frightened. The women had already fled, taking refuge in Vitry; only a few =
men remained. On=20

seeing the prince they hastened to meet him. One of them recognized him.  "=
Ah, my lord," he said,=20



"have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robb=
ers?"  "Yes," said=20

the prince, "if you will serve me as guide."  "Willingly, my lord. Where do=
es your highness wish to=20

go?"  "To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surroun=
ding country----"=20

"In that case, I'm your man."  "I can trust you--you are a true Frenchman?"=
  "I am an old soldier of=20

Rocroy, my lord."  "Here," said the prince, handing him a purse, "here is f=
or Rocroy. Now, do you=20

want a horse, or will you go afoot?"  "Afoot, my lord; I have served always=
 in the infantry. Besides,=20

I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk."  "=
Come, then," said the=20

prince; "let us lose no time."  The peasant started off, running before the=
 prince's horse; then, a=20

hundred steps from the village, he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom =
of the valley. For a half=20

league they proceeded thus, the cannon-shot sounding so near that they expe=
cted at each=20

discharge to hear the hum of the balls. At length they entered a path which=
, going out from the=20

road, skirted the mountainside. The prince dismounted, ordered one of his a=
ids and Raoul to=20

follow his example, and directed the others to await his orders, keeping th=
emselves meanwhile on=20

the alert. He then began to ascend the path.  In about ten minutes they rea=
ched the ruins of an old=20

chateau; those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surr=
ounding country. At a=20

distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens, at bay, =
and before Lens the=20

enemy's entire army.  With a single glance the prince took in the extent of=
 country that lay before=20

him, from Lens as far as Vimy. In a moment the plan of the battle which on =
the following day was=20

to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind. He t=
ook a pencil, tore a=20

page from his tablets and wrote:  "My Dear Marshal,--In an hour Lens will b=
e in the enemy's=20

possession. Come and rejoin me; bring with you the whole army. I shall be a=
t Vendin to place it in=20

position. To-morrow we shall retake Lens and beat the enemy."  Then, turnin=
g toward Raoul: "Go,=20

monsieur," he said; "ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Grammont=
."  Raoul bowed, took=20

the letter, went hastily down the mountain, leaped on his horse and set out=
 at a gallop. A quarter of=20

an hour later he was with the marshal.  A portion of the troops had already=
 arrived and the=20

remainder was expected from moment to moment. Marshal de Grammont put himse=
lf at the head=20

of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin, leav=
ing the Duc de Chatillon=20

to await and bring on the rest. All the artillery was ready to move, and st=
arted off at a moment's=20

notice.  It was seven o'clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at th=
e appointed place. The=20

prince awaited him there. As he had foreseen, Lens had fallen into the hand=
s of the enemy=20

immediately after Raoul's departure. The event was announced by the cessati=
on of the firing.  As=20

the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in =
successive=20

detachments. Orders were given that no drum should be beaten, no trumpet so=
unded.  At nine=20

o'clock the night had fully come. Still a last ray of twilight lighted the =
plain. The army marched=20

silently, the prince at the head of the column. Presently the army came in =
sight of Lens; two or=20

three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what=
 suffering was=20

endured by a town taken by assault.  The prince assigned to every one his p=
ost. Marshal de=20

Grammont was to hold the extreme left, resting on Mericourt. The Duc de Cha=
tillon commanded=20

the centre. Finally, the prince led the right wing, resting on Aunay. The o=
rder of battle on the=20

morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening. Each one, on a=
waking, would find=20

himself on the field of battle.  The movement was executed in silence and w=
ith precision. At ten=20

o'clock every one was in his appointed position; at half-past ten the princ=
e visited the posts and=20



gave his final orders for the following day.  Three things were especially =
urged upon the officers,=20

who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously: the first, th=
at the different corps=20

should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and th=
at each body should=20

protect its gaps; the second, to go to the charge no faster than a walk; th=
e third, to let the enemy=20

fire first.  The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept=
 Bragelonne near his own=20

person; but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night tog=
ether and it was=20

accorded them. A tent was erected for them near that of the marshal.  Altho=
ugh the day had been=20

fatiguing, neither of them was inclined to sleep. And besides, even for old=
 soldiers the evening=20

before a battle is a serious time; it was so with greater reason to two you=
ng men who were about=20

to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle. On the evening befor=
e a battle one thinks of a=20

thousand things forgotten till then; those who are indifferent to one anoth=
er become friends and=20

those who are friends become brothers. It need not be said that if in the d=
epths of the heart there=20

is a sentiment more tender, it reaches then, quite naturally, the highest e=
xaltation of which it is=20

capable. Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one o=
f these two friends,=20

for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the te=
nt and began to write.=20

The letters were long--the four pages were covered with closely written wor=
ds. The writers=20

sometimes looked up at each other and smiled; they understood without speak=
ing, their=20

organizations were so delicate and sympathetic. The letters being finished,=
 each put his own into=20

two envelopes, so that no one, without tearing the first envelope, could di=
scover to whom the=20

second was addressed; then they drew near to each other and smilingly excha=
nged their letters.=20

"In case any evil should happen to me," said Bragelonne.  "In case I should=
 be killed," said De=20

Guiche.  They then embraced each other like two brothers, and each wrapping=
 himself in his cloak=20

they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative o=
f birds, flowers and=20

infants.     35. A Dinner in the Old Style.   The second interview between =
the former musketeers=20

was not so formal and threatening as the first. Athos, with his superior un=
derstanding, wisely=20

deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory po=
int of reunion, and at=20

the moment when his friends, in deference to his deportment and sobriety, d=
ared scarcely speak=20

of some of their former good dinners, he was the first to propose that they=
 should all assemble=20

around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their =
own natural=20

character and manners--a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to =
that good=20

understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables. Fo=
r different=20

reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all, and it was therefore=
 agreed that each=20

should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the a=
ssociates a meeting=20

should be convoked at a famous eating house in the Rue de la Monnaie, of th=
e sign of the=20

Hermitage. The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday, at e=
ight o'clock in the=20

evening precisely.  On that day, in fact, the four friends arrived punctual=
ly at the hour, each from=20

his own abode or occupation. Porthos had been trying a new horse; D'Artagna=
n was on guard at=20

the Louvre; Aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborho=
od; and Athos, whose=20

domicile was established in the Rue Guenegaud, found himself close at hand.=
 They were,=20

therefore, somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the Hermita=
ge, Athos starting out=20

from the Pont Neuf, Porthos by the Rue de la Roule, D'Artagnan by the Rue d=
es Fosse Saint=20

Germain l'Auxerrois, and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy.  The first words exc=
hanged between the=20



four friends, on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with th=
eir demonstration,=20

were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness. At=
hos perceived this=20

embarrassment, and by way of supplying an effectual remedy, called for four=
 bottles of=20

champagne.  At this order, given in Athos's habitually calm manner, the fac=
e of the Gascon=20

relaxed and Porthos's brow grew smooth. Aramis was astonished. He knew that=
 Athos not only=20

never drank, but more, that he had a kind of repugnance to wine. This aston=
ishment was doubled=20

when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former ent=
husiasm. His=20

companions followed his example. In a very few minutes the four bottles wer=
e empty and this=20

excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that m=
ight have rested on their=20

spirits. Now the four friends began to speak loud, scarcely waiting till on=
e had finished before=20

another began, and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table. S=
oon--strange fact--

Aramis undid two buttons of his doublet, seeing which, Porthos unfastened h=
is entirely.  Battles,=20

long journeys, blows given and received, sufficed for the first themes of c=
onversation, which turned=20

upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the grea=
t cardinal.  "Faith,"=20

said Aramis, laughing, "we have praised the dead enough, let us revile the =
living a little; I should=20

like to say something evil of Mazarin; is it permissible?"  "Go on, go on,"=
 replied D'Artagnan,=20

laughing heartily; "relate your story and I will applaud it if it is a good=
 one."  "A great prince," said=20

Aramis, "with whom Mazarin sought an alliance, was invited by him to send h=
im a list of the=20

conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him. The pr=
ince, who had a great=20

repugnance to treat with such an ill-bred fellow, made out a list, against =
the grain, and sent it. In=20

this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offer=
ed the prince ten=20

thousand crowns to renounce them."  "Ah, ha, ha!" laughed the three friends=
, "not a bad bargain;=20

and there was no fear of being taken at his word; what did the prince do th=
en?"  "The prince=20

immediately sent fifty thousand francs to Mazarin, begging him never to wri=
te to him again, and=20

offered twenty thousand francs more, on condition that he would never speak=
 to him. What did=20

Mazarin do?"  "Stormed!" suggested Athos.  "Beat the messenger!" cried Port=
hos.  "Accepted the=20

money!" said D'Artagnan.  "You have guessed it," answered Aramis; and they =
all laughed so=20

heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen w=
anted anything; he=20

thought they were fighting.  At last their hilarity calmed down and:  "Fait=
h!" exclaimed D'Artagnan=20

to the two friends, "you may well wish ill to Mazarin; for I assure you, on=
 his side he wishes you no=20

good."  "Pooh! really?" asked Athos. "If I thought the fellow knew me by my=
 name I would be=20

rebaptized, for fear it might be thought I knew him."  "He knows you better=
 by your actions than=20

your name; he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided=
 the escape of=20

Monsieur de Beaufort, and he has instigated an active search for them, I ca=
n answer for it."  "By=20

whom?"  "By me; and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained=
 any information."=20

"And what did you reply?"  "That I had none as yet; but that I was to dine =
to-day with two=20

gentlemen, who would be able to give me some."  "You told him that?" said P=
orthos, a broad smile=20

spreading over his honest face. "Bravo! and you are not afraid of that, Ath=
os?"  "No," replied=20

Athos, "it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear."  "Now," said Aramis, =
"tell me a little what you do=20

fear."  "Nothing for the present; at least, nothing in good earnest."  "And=
 with regard to the past?"=20

asked Porthos.  "Oh! the past is another thing," said Athos, sighing; "the =
past and the future."  "Are=20

you afraid for your young Raoul?" asked Aramis.  "Well," said D'Artagnan, "=
one is never killed in a=20



first engagement."  "Nor in the second," said Aramis  "Nor in the third," r=
eturned Porthos; "and=20

even when one is killed, one rises again, the proof of which is, that here =
we are!"  "No," said=20

Athos, "it is not Raoul about whom I am anxious, for I trust he will conduc=
t himself like a=20

gentleman; and if he is killed--well, he will die bravely; but hold--should=
 such a misfortune happen-

-well--" Athos passed his hand across his pale brow.  "Well?" asked Aramis.=
  "Well, I shall look=20

upon it as an expiation."  "Ah!" said D'Artagnan; "I know what you mean."  =
"And I, too," added=20

Aramis; "but you must not think of that, Athos; what is past, is past."  "I=
 don't understand," said=20

Porthos.  "The affair at Armentieres," whispered D'Artagnan.  "The affair a=
t Armentieres?" asked=20

he again.  "Milady."  "Oh, yes!" said Porthos; "true, I had forgotten it!" =
 Athos looked at him intently.=20

"You have forgotten it, Porthos?" said he.  "Faith! yes, it is so long ago,=
" answered Porthos.  "This=20

affair does not, then, weigh upon your conscience?"  "Faith, no."  "And you=
, D'Artagnan?"  "I--I=20

own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollectio=
n of anything but the=20

rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancieux. Yes, yes," murmured he, "I have oft=
en felt regret for the=20

victim, but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin."  Athos shoo=
k his dead doubtfully.=20

"Consider," said Aramis, "if you admit divine justice and its participation=
 in the things of this world,=20

that woman was punished by the will of heaven. We were but the instruments,=
 that is all."  "But as=20

to free will, Aramis?"  "How acts the judge? He has a free will, yet he fea=
rlessly condemns. What=20

does the executioner? He is master of his arm, yet he strikes without remor=
se."  "The executioner!"=20

muttered Athos, as if arrested by some recollection.  "I know that it is te=
rrible," said D'Artagnan;=20

"but when I reflect that we have killed English, Rochellais, Spaniards, nay=
, even French, who=20

never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us, whose only fault =
was to cross swords=20

with us and to be unable to ward off our blows--I can, on my honor, find an=
 excuse for my share in=20

the murder of that woman."  "As for me," said Porthos, "now that you have r=
eminded me of it,=20

Athos, I have the scene again before me, as if I now were there. Milady was=
 there, as it were,=20

where you sit." (Athos changed color.) "I--I was where D'Artagnan stands. I=
 wore a long sword=20

which cut like a Damascus--you remember it, Aramis for you always called it=
 Balizarde. Well, I=20

swear to you, all three, that had the executioner of Bethune--was he not of=
 Bethune?--yes, egad!=20

of Bethune!--not been there, I would have cut off the head of that infamous=
 being without thinking=20

of it, or even after thinking of it. She was a most atrocious woman."  "And=
 then," said Aramis, with=20

the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had be=
longed to the church=20

and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God, "what is the us=
e of thinking of it all?=20

At the last hour we must confess this action and God knows better than we c=
an whether it is a=20

crime, a fault, or a meritorious deed. I repent of it? Egad! no. Upon my ho=
nor and by the holy=20

cross; I only regret it because she was a woman."  "The most satisfactory p=
art of the matter," said=20

D'Artagnan, "is that there remains no trace of it."  "She had a son," obser=
ved Athos.  "Oh! yes, I=20

know that," said D'Artagnan, "and you mentioned it to me; but who knows wha=
t has become of=20

him? If the serpent be dead, why not its brood? Do you think his uncle De W=
inter would have=20

brought up that young viper? De Winter probably condemned the son as he had=
 done the mother."=20

"Then," said Athos, "woe to De Winter, for the child had done no harm."  "M=
ay the devil take me, if=20

the child be not dead," said Porthos. "There is so much fog in that detesta=
ble country, at least so=20

D'Artagnan declares."  Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was=
 about to bring back=20

hilarity to faces now more or less clouded, hasty footsteps were heard upon=
 the stair and some=20



one knocked at the door.  "Come in," cried Athos.  "Please your honors," sa=
id the host, "a person=20

in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you."  "To which of us?" asked a=
ll the four friends.  "To=20

him who is called the Comte de la Fere."  "It is I," said Athos, "and what =
is the name of the=20

person?"  "Grimaud."  "Ah!" exclaimed Athos, turning pale. "Back already! W=
hat can have=20

happened, then, to Bragelonne?"  "Let him enter," cried D'Artagnan; "let hi=
m come up."  But=20

Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step;=
 so springing into the=20

room he motioned the host to leave it. The door being closed, the four frie=
nds waited in=20

expectation. Grimaud's agitation, his pallor, the sweat which covered his f=
ace, the dust which=20

soiled his clothes, all indicated that he was the messenger of some importa=
nt and terrible news.=20

"Your honors," said he, "that woman had a child; that child has become a ma=
n; the tigress had a=20

little one, the tiger has roused himself; he is ready to spring upon you--b=
eware!"  Athos glanced=20

around at his friends with a melancholy smile. Porthos turned to look at hi=
s sword, which was=20

hanging on the wall; Aramis seized his knife; D'Artagnan arose.  "What do y=
ou mean, Grimaud?"=20

he exclaimed.  "That Milady's son has left England, that he is in France, o=
n his road to Paris, if he=20

be not here already."  "The devil he is!" said Porthos. "Are you sure of it=
?"  "Certain," replied=20

Grimaud.  This announcement was received in silence. Grimaud was so breathl=
ess, so exhausted,=20

that he had fallen back upon a chair. Athos filled a beaker with champagne =
and gave it to him.=20

"Well, after all," said D'Artagnan, "supposing that he lives, that he comes=
 to Paris; we have seen=20

many other such. Let him come."  "Yes," echoed Porthos, glancing affectiona=
tely at his sword, still=20

hanging on the wall; "we can wait for him; let him come."  "Moreover, he is=
 but a child," said=20

Aramis.  Grimaud rose.  "A child!" he exclaimed. "Do you know what he has d=
one, this child?=20

Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the =
executioner of=20

Bethune, and having confessed him, after having learned everything from him=
, he gave him=20

absolution by planting this dagger into his heart. See, it is on fire yet w=
ith his hot blood, for it is not=20

thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound."  And Grimaud threw the dag=
ger on the table.=20

D'Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to=
 their swords.=20

Athos alone remained seated, calm and thoughtful.  "And you say he is dress=
ed as a monk,=20

Grimaud?"  "Yes, as an Augustine monk."  "What sized man is he?"  "About my=
 height; thin, pale,=20

with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair."  "And he did not see Raoul?" a=
sked Athos.  "Yes, on=20

the contrary, they met, and it was the viscount himself who conducted him t=
o the bed of the dying=20

man."  Athos, in his turn, rising without speaking, went and unhooked his s=
word.  "Heigh, sir," said=20

D'Artagnan, trying to laugh, "do you know we look very much like a flock of=
 silly, mouse-evading=20

women! How is it that we, four men who have faced armies without blinking, =
begin to tremble at=20

the mention of a child?"  "It is true," said Athos, "but this child comes i=
n the name of Heaven."  And=20

very soon they left the inn.     36. A Letter from Charles the First.   The=
 reader must now cross the=20

Seine with us and follow us to the door of the Carmelite Convent in the Rue=
 Saint Jacques. It is=20

eleven o'clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished sayi=
ng mass for the success=20

of the armies of King Charles I. Leaving the church, a woman and a young gi=
rl dressed in black,=20

the one as a widow and the other as an orphan, have re-entered their cell. =
 The woman kneels on=20

a prie-dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the you=
ng girl, leaning against=20

a chair, weeping.  The woman must have once been handsome, but traces of so=
rrow have aged=20

her. The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her; the lady ap=
pears to be about forty=20



years of age, the girl about fourteen.  "Oh, God!" prayed the kneeling supp=
liant, "protect my=20

husband, guard my son, and take my wretched life instead!"  "Oh, God!" murm=
ured the girl, "leave=20

me my mother!"  "Your mother can be of no use to you in this world, Henriet=
ta," said the lady,=20

turning around. "Your mother has no longer either throne or husband; she ha=
s neither son, money=20

nor friends; the whole world, my poor child, has abandoned your mother!" An=
d she fell back,=20

weeping, into her daughter's arms.  "Courage, take courage, my dear mother!=
" said the girl.  "Ah!=20

'tis an unfortunate year for kings," said the mother. "And no one thinks of=
 us in this country, for=20

each must think about his own affairs. As long as your brother was with me =
he kept me up; but he=20

is gone and can no longer send us news of himself, either to me or to your =
father. I have pledged=20

my last jewels, sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants, who refus=
ed to accompany him=20

unless I made this sacrifice. We are now reduced to live at the expense of =
these daughters of=20

Heaven; we are the poor, succored by God."  "But why not address yourself t=
o your sister, the=20

queen?" asked the girl.  "Alas! the queen, my sister, is no longer queen, m=
y child. Another reigns=20

in her name. One day you will be able to understand how all this is."  "Wel=
l, then, to the king, your=20

nephew. Shall I speak to him? You know how much he loves me, my mother.  "A=
las! my nephew=20

is not yet king, and you know Laporte has told us twenty times that he hims=
elf is in need of almost=20

everything."  "Then let us pray to Heaven," said the girl.  The two women w=
ho thus knelt in united=20

prayer were the daughter and grand-daughter of Henry IV., the wife and daug=
hter of Charles I.=20

They had just finished their double prayer, when a nun softly tapped at the=
 door of the cell.  "Enter,=20

my sister," said the queen.  "I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusi=
on on her meditations, but a=20

foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor, demanding th=
e honor of presenting a=20

letter to your majesty."  "Oh, a letter! a letter from the king, perhaps. N=
ews from your father, do you=20

hear, Henrietta? And the name of this lord?"  "Lord de Winter."  "Lord de W=
inter!" exclaimed the=20

queen, "the friend of my husband. Oh, bid him enter!"  And the queen advanc=
ed to meet the=20

messenger, whose hand she seized affectionately, whilst he knelt down and p=
resented a letter to=20

her, contained in a case of gold.  "Ah! my lord!" said the queen, "you brin=
g us three things which=20

we have not seen for a long time. Gold, a devoted friend, and a letter from=
 the king, our husband=20

and master."  De Winter bowed again, unable to reply from excess of emotion=
.  On their side the=20

mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly =
the following letter:=20

"Dear Wife,--We have now reached the moment of decision. I have concentrate=
d here at Naseby=20

camp all the resources Heaven has left me, and I write to you in haste from=
 thence. Here I await=20

the army of my rebellious subjects. I am about to struggle for the last tim=
e with them. If victorious, I=20

shall continue the struggle; if beaten, I am lost. I shall try, in the latt=
er case (alas! in our position,=20

one must provide for everything), I shall try to gain the coast of France. =
But can they, will they=20

receive an unhappy king, who will bring such a sad story into a country alr=
eady agitated by civil=20

discord? Your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides. The bearer=
 of this letter will tell=20

you, madame, what I dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transi=
t. He will explain to you=20

the steps that I expect you to pursue. I charge him also with my blessing f=
or my children and with=20

the sentiments of my soul for yourself, my dearest sweetheart."  The letter=
 bore the signature, not=20

of "Charles, King," but of "Charles--still king."  "And let him be no longe=
r king," cried the queen.=20

"Let him be conquered, exiled, proscribed, provided he still lives. Alas! i=
n these days the throne is=20

too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it. But my lord, tell me=
," she continued, "hide=20



nothing from me--what is, in truth, the king's position? Is it as hopeless =
as he thinks?"  "Alas!=20

madame, more hopeless than he thinks. His majesty has so good a heart that =
he cannot=20

understand hatred; is so loyal that he does not suspect treason! England is=
 torn in twain by a spirit=20

of disturbance which, I greatly fear, blood alone can exorcise."  "But Lord=
 Montrose," replied the=20

queen, "I have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained. I =
heard it said that he was=20

marching to the frontier to join the king."  "Yes, madame; but on the front=
ier he was met by Lesly;=20

he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings. Now victory has a=
bandoned him.=20

Montrose, beaten at Philiphaugh, was obliged to disperse the remains of his=
 army and to fly,=20

disguised as a servant. He is at Bergen, in Norway."  "Heaven preserve him!=
" said the queen. "It is=20

at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their liv=
es for us are safe. And=20

now, my lord, that I see how hopeless the position of the king is, tell me =
with what you are charged=20

on the part of my royal husband."  "Well, then, madame," said De Winter, "t=
he king wishes you to=20

try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him."  "Alas=
! you know that even=20

now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough. Here, Monsie=
ur Mazarin is=20

everything."  "Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell play=
s in England?"  "Oh, no!=20

He is a subtle, conscienceless Italian, who though he very likely dreams of=
 crime, dares not=20

commit it; and unlike Cromwell, who disposes of both Houses, Mazarin has ha=
d the queen to=20

support him in his struggle with the parliament."  "More reason, then, he s=
hould protect a king=20

pursued by parliament."  The queen shook her head despairingly.  "If I judg=
e for myself, my lord,"=20

she said, "the cardinal will do nothing, and will even, perhaps, act agains=
t us. The presence of my=20

daughter and myself in France is already irksome to him; much more so would=
 be that of the king.=20

My lord," added Henrietta, with a melancholy smile, "it is sad and almost s=
hameful to be obliged to=20

say that we have passed the winter in the Louvre without money, without lin=
en, almost without=20

bread, and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire."  "Horrible!" =
cried De Winter; "the=20

daughter of Henry IV., and the wife of King Charles! Wherefore did you not =
apply, then, madame,=20

to the first person you saw from us?"  "Such is the hospitality shown to a =
queen by the minister=20

from whom a king demands it."  "But I heard that a marriage between the Pri=
nce of Wales and=20

Mademoiselle d'Orleans was spoken of," said De Winter.  "Yes, for an instan=
t I hoped it was so.=20

The young people felt a mutual esteem; but the queen, who at first sanction=
ed their affection,=20

changed her mind, and Monsieur, the Duc d'Orleans, who had encouraged the f=
amiliarity between=20

them, has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union. Oh, my =
lord!" continued the=20

queen, without restraining her tears, "it is better to fight as the king ha=
s done, and to die, as=20

perhaps he will, than live in beggary like me."  "Courage, madame! courage!=
 Do not despair! The=20

interests of the French crown, endangered at this moment, are to discounten=
ance rebellion in a=20

neighboring nation. Mazarin, as a statesman, will understand the politic ne=
cessity."  "Are you=20

sure," said the queen doubtfully, "that you have not been forestalled?"  "B=
y whom?"  "By the=20

Joices, the Prinns, the Cromwells?"  "By a tailor, a coachmaker, a brewer! =
Ah! I hope, madame,=20

that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men!"  "Ah! wh=
at is he himself?" asked=20

Madame Henrietta.  "But for the honor of the king--of the queen."  "Well, l=
et us hope he will do=20

something for the sake of their honor," said the queen. "A true friend's el=
oquence is so powerful,=20

my lord, that you have reassured me. Give me your hand and let us go to the=
 minister; and yet,"=20

she added, "suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle?"  =
"His majesty will then=20



take refuge in Holland, where I hear his highness the Prince of Wales now i=
s."  "And can his=20

majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?"  "Alas! =
no, madame," answered=20

De Winter; "but the case is provided for and I am come to France to seek al=
lies."  "Allies!" said the=20

queen, shaking her head.  "Madame," replied De Winter, "provided I can find=
 some of my good old=20

friends of former times I will answer for anything."  "Come then, my lord,"=
 said the queen, with the=20

painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much; "come, and may =
Heaven hear you."=20

37. Cromwell's Letter.   At the very moment when the queen quitted the conv=
ent to go to the Palais=20

Royal, a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced=
 to the guards that=20

he had something of importance to communicate to Cardinal Mazarin. Although=
 the cardinal was=20

often tormented by fear, he was more often in need of counsel and informati=
on, and he was=20

therefore sufficiently accessible. The true difficulty of being admitted wa=
s not to be found at the=20

first door, and even the second was passed easily enough; but at the third =
watched, besides the=20

guard and the doorkeepers, the faithful Bernouin, a Cerberus whom no speech=
 could soften, no=20

wand, even of gold, could charm.  It was therefore at the third door that t=
hose who solicited or=20

were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory.  The young=
 man having left his=20

horse tied to the gate in the court, mounted the great staircase and addres=
sed the guard in the first=20

chamber.  "Cardinal Mazarin?" said he.  "Pass on," replied the guard.  The =
cavalier entered the=20

second hall, which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers.  "Have yo=
u a letter of=20

audience?" asked a porter, advancing to the new arrival.  "I have one, but =
not one from Cardinal=20

Mazarin."  "Enter, and ask for Monsieur Bernouin," said the porter, opening=
 the door of the third=20

room. Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident, Mo=
nsieur Bernouin was=20

found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed.  "Y=
ou seek me, sir," said=20

he. "From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?"  "From General =
Oliver Cromwell,"=20

said the new comer. "Be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and=
 to bring me word=20

whether he will receive me--yes or no."  Saying which, he resumed the proud=
 and sombre bearing=20

peculiar at that time to Puritans. Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at=
 the person of the young=20

man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal, to whom he transmitted the mes=
senger's words.  "A=20

man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell?" said Mazarin. "And what kind o=
f a man?"  "A genuine=20

Englishman, your eminence. Hair sandy-red--more red than sandy; gray-blue e=
yes--more gray=20

than blue; and for the rest, stiff and proud."  "Let him give in his letter=
."  "His eminence asks for the=20

letter," said Bernouin, passing back into the ante-chamber.  "His eminence =
cannot see the letter=20

without the bearer of it," replied the young man; "but to convince you that=
 I am really the bearer of=20

a letter, see, here it is; and kindly add," continued he, "that I am not a =
simple messenger, but an=20

envoy extraordinary."  Bernouin re-entered the cabinet, returning in a few =
seconds. "Enter, sir,"=20

said he.  The young man appeared on the threshold of the minister's closet,=
 in one hand holding=20

his hat, in the other the letter. Mazarin rose. "Have you, sir," asked he, =
"a letter accrediting you to=20

me?"  "There it is, my lord," said the young man.  Mazarin took the letter =
and read it thus:  "Mr.=20

Mordaunt, one of my secretaries, will remit this letter of introduction to =
His Eminence, the Cardinal=20

Mazarin, in Paris. He is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle f=
or his eminence.  "Oliver=20

Cromwell."  "Very well, Monsieur Mordaunt," said Mazarin, "give me this sec=
ond letter and sit=20

down."  The young man drew from his pocket a second letter, presented it to=
 the cardinal, and=20

took his seat. The cardinal, however, did not unseal the letter at once, bu=
t continued to turn it=20



again and again in his hand; then, in accordance with his usual custom and =
judging from=20

experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to qu=
estion them, fixing=20

his eyes upon them at the same time, he thus addressed the messenger:  "You=
 are very young,=20

Monsieur Mordaunt, for this difficult task of ambassador, in which the olde=
st diplomatists often=20

fail."  "My lord, I am twenty-three years of age; but your eminence is mist=
aken in saying that I am=20

young. I am older than your eminence, although I possess not your wisdom. Y=
ears of suffering, in=20

my opinion, count double, and I have suffered for twenty years."  "Ah, yes,=
 I understand," said=20

Mazarin; "want of fortune, perhaps. You are poor, are you not?" Then he add=
ed to himself: "These=20

English Revolutionists are all beggars and ill-bred."  "My lord, I ought to=
 have a fortune of six=20

millions, but it has been taken from me."  "You are not, then, a man of the=
 people?" said Mazarin,=20

astonished.  "If I bore my proper title I should be a lord. If I bore my na=
me you would have heard=20

one of the most illustrious names of England."  "What is your name, then?" =
asked Mazarin.  "My=20

name is Mordaunt," replied the young man, bowing.  Mazarin now understood t=
hat Cromwell's=20

envoy desired to retain his incognito. He was silent for an instant, and du=
ring that time he scanned=20

the young man even more attentively than he had done at first. The messenge=
r was unmoved.=20

"Devil take these Puritans," said Mazarin aside; "they are carved from gran=
ite." Then he added=20

aloud, "But you have relations left you?"  "I have one remaining. Three tim=
es I presented=20


_
Kian-yi-su. Contrasting Bodhidharma with Buddha, he exclaims:       "Julai"=
 (Tathagata) taught=20

great truths and the causes of things.     He became the instructor of men =
and Devas. He saved=20

multitudes,     and spoke the contents of more than five hundred works. Hen=
ce     arose the Kiau-

men, or exoteric branch of the system, and it was     believed to be the tr=
adition of the _words_ of=20

Buddha. Bodhidharma     brought from the Western Heaven [Shamballa] the "Se=
al of Truth"=20

(true seal) and opened the fountain of contemplation in the East.     He po=
inted directly to=20

Buddha's heart and nature, swept away the     parasitic and alien growth of=
 book-instruction, and=20

thus     established the Tsung-men, or Esoteric branch of the system     co=
ntaining the tradition of=20

the heart of Buddha.(752)   A few remarks made by the author of _Chinese Bu=
ddhism_ throw a=20

flood of light on the universal misconceptions of Orientalists in general, =
and of the missionaries in=20

the "lands of the Gentiles" in particular. They appeal very forcibly to the=
 intuition of Theosophists--

more particularly of those in India. The sentences to be noticed are italic=
ized.       The common=20

[Chinese] word for the esoteric Schools is _dan_, the     Sanskrit _Dhyana_=
.... Orthodox Buddhism=20

has in China slowly but     steadily _become heterodox_. The Buddhism of bo=
oks and ancient=20

traditions _has become the Buddhism of mystic contemplation_....     The hi=
story of ancient=20

schools springing up long ago in the     Buddhist communities of India _can=
 now be only very=20

partially     recovered_. Possibly some light may be thrown back by China u=
pon     the religious=20

history of the country from which Buddhism     came.(753) In no part of the=
 story is aid to the=20

recovery of the     lost knowledge more likely to be found than in the acco=
unts of the     patriarchs,=20

the line of whom was completed by Bodhidharma. In     seeking the best expl=
anation of the=20

Chinese and Japanese narrative     of the patriarchs, and the _seven Buddha=
s_ terminating in=20

Gautama,     or Shakyamuni, it is important to know the Jain traditions as =
they     were early in the=20

sixth century of our era, when the Patriarch     Bodhidharma removed to Chi=
na....      In tracing the=20

rise of the various schools of esoteric Buddhism it     must be kept in min=
d that a principle=20

somewhat similar to the     dogma of apostolical succession belongs to them=
 all. They all=20

profess _to derive their doctrines through a succession of     teachers, ea=
ch instructed personally=20

by his predecessor, till the     time of Bodhidharma, and so further up in =
the series to Shakyamuni=20

himself and the earlier Buddhas_.(754)   It is complained further on, and i=
s mentioned as a falling=20

away from strict orthodox Buddhism, that _the Lamas of Tibet are received i=
n Pekin with the=20

utmost respect_ by the Emperor.  The following passages, taken from differe=
nt parts of the book,=20

summarise Mr. Edkins' views:       Hermits are not uncommonly met with in t=
he vicinity of large=20

Buddhist temples ... their hair being allowed to grow unshorn....     The d=
octrine of=20

metempsychosis is rejected. Buddhism is one form     of Pantheism on the gr=
ound that the=20

doctrine of metempsychosis     makes all nature instinct with life, and tha=
t that life is the     Deity=20

assuming different forms of personality, that Deity not     being a self-co=
nscious, free-acting Self-

Cause, but an all-     pervading Spirit. The esoteric Buddhists of China, k=
eeping rigidly     to their=20

one doctrine,(755) say nothing of the metempsychosis, ...     or any other =
of the more material=20

parts of the Buddhist system....     The Western paradise promised to the w=
orshippers of Amida=20

Buddha     is ... inconsistent with the doctrine of Nirvana [?].(756)... _I=
t     promises immortality_=20

instead of annihilation. The great antiquity     of this School is evident =
from the early date of the=20

translation     of the _Amida Sutra_, which came from the hands of Kumaraji=
va, and     the _Ku-

liang-sheu-King_, dating from the Han dynasty. Its extent     of influence =
is seen in the attachment=20



of the Tibetans and Moguls     to the worship of this Buddha, and in the fa=
ct that the name of=20

this fictitious personage [?] is more commonly heard in China than     that=
 of the historical=20

Shakyamuni.   We fear the learned writer is on a false track as to Nirvana =
and Amita Buddha.=20

However, here we have the evidence of a missionary to show that there are s=
everal schools of=20

Esoteric Buddhism in the Celestial Empire. When the misuse of dogmatical or=
thodox Buddhist=20

Scriptures had reached its climax, and the true spirit of the Buddha's Phil=
osophy was nearly lost,=20

several reformers appeared from India, who established an oral teaching. Su=
ch were=20

Bodhidharma and Nagarjuna, the authors of the most important works of the c=
ontemplative School=20

in China during the first centuries of our era. It is known, moreover, as i=
s said in _Chinese=20

Buddhism_, that Bodhidharma became the chief founder of the Esoteric School=
s, which were=20

divided into five principal branches. The data given are correct enough, bu=
t every conclusion,=20

without one single exception, is wrong. It was said in _Isis Unveiled_ that=
--       Buddha teaches=20

the doctrine of a new birth as plainly as Jesus     does. Desiring to break=
 with the ancient=20

Mysteries, to which it     was impossible to admit the ignorant masses, the=
 Hindu reformer,=20

though generally silent upon more than one secret dogma, clearly     states=
 his thought in several=20

passages. Thus, he says: "_Some     people are born again_; evil-doers go t=
o hell [Avitchi];=20

righteous     people go to heaven [Devachan]; those who are free from all  =
   worldly desires enter=20

Nirvana" (_Precepts of the Dhammapada_, v.     126). Elsewhere Buddha state=
s that "it is better to=20

believe in a     future life, in which happiness or misery can be felt: for=
 if the     heart believes=20

therein it will abandon sin and act virtuously; and     even if there is no=
 resurrection [rebirth], such a=20

life will bring     a good name and the reward of men. But those who believ=
e in     extinction at=20

death will not fail to commit any sin that they may     choose, because of =
their disbelief in a future."=20

(See _Wheel of     the Law_.)   How is immortality, then, "inconsistent wit=
h the doctrine of=20

Nirvana?" The above are only a few of Buddha's openly-expressed thoughts to=
 his chosen Arhats;=20

the great Saint said much more. As a comment upon the mistaken views held i=
n our century by the=20

Orientalists, "who vainly try to fathom Tathagata's thoughts," and those of=
 Brahmans, "who=20

repudiate the great Teacher to this day," here are some original thoughts e=
xpressed in relation to=20

the Buddha and the study of the Secret Sciences. They are from a work writt=
en in Chinese by a=20

Tibetan, and published in the monastery of Tientai for circulation among th=
e Buddhists       Who=20

live in foreign lands, and are in danger of being spoiled by     missionari=
es,   as the author truly=20

says, every convert being not only "spoiled" for his own creed, but being a=
lso a sorry acquisition=20

for Christianity. A translation of a few passages, kindly made from that wo=
rk for the present=20

volumes is now given.       No profane ears having heard the mighty Chau-ya=

enlightening _precepts_] of Vu-vei-Tchen-jen [Buddha _within_     Buddha],(=
757) of our beloved=20

Lord and Bodhisattva, how can one     tell what his thoughts really were? T=
he holy Sang-gyas-=20

Panchhen(758) never offered an insight into the _One Reality_ to     the un=
reformed [uninitiated]=20

Bhikkus. Few are those even among the     Tu-fon [Tibetans] who knew it; as=
 for the Tsung-

men(759) Schools,     they are going with every day more down hill.... Not =
even the Fa-     siong-

Tsung(760) can give one the wisdom taught in real Naljor-     chod-pa [Sans=
krit:(761)=20

Yogacharya]: ... it is all "Eye" Doctrine,     and no more. The loss of a r=
estraining guidance is felt,=20

since the     Tch'-an-si [teachers] of inward meditation [self-contemplatio=
n or     Tchung-kwan]=20

have become rare, and the Good Law is replaced by     idol-worship [Siang-k=
yan]. It is of this [idol-=20



or image-worship]     that the Barbarians [Western people] have heard, and =
know nothing     of=20

Bas-pa-Dharma [the secret Dharma or doctrine]. Why has truth to     hide li=
ke a tortoise within its=20

shell? Because it is now found to     have become like the Lama's tonsure k=
nife,(762) a weapon=20

too     dangerous to use even for the Lanoo. Therefore no one can be     en=
trusted with the=20

knowledge [Secret Science] before his time. The     Chagpa-Thog-mad have be=
come rare, and the=20

best have retired to     Tushita the Blessed.(763)   Further on, a man seek=
ing to master the=20

mysteries of Esotericism before he had been declared by the initiated Tch'-=
an-si (teachers) to be=20

ready to receive them, is likened to       One who would, without a lantern=
 and on a dark night,=20

proceed to a     place full of scorpions, determined to feel on the ground =
for a     needle his=20

neighbour has dropped.   Again:       He who would acquire the Sacred Knowl=
edge should, before=20

he goes     any farther "_trim his lamp_ of inner understanding," and then =
    "with the help of such=20

good and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away."  "Oh, mon Di=
eu! my dear Mr.=20

Mordaunt," said Mazarin, hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the =
young man in a snare,=20

"how extremely your history interests me! You know not, then, anything of y=
our birth--you have=20

never seen your mother?"  "Yes, my lord; she came three times, whilst I was=
 a child, to my nurse's=20

house; I remember the last time she came as well as if it were to-day."  "Y=
ou have a good=20

memory," said Mazarin.  "Oh! yes, my lord," said the young man, with such p=
eculiar emphasis that=20

the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein.  "And who brought you u=
p?" he asked again.=20

"A French nurse, who sent me away when I was five years old because no one =
paid her for me,=20

telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often spe=
ak."  "What became=20

of you?"  "As I was weeping and begging on the high road, a minister from K=
ingston took me in,=20

instructed me in the Calvinistic faith, taught me all he knew himself and a=
ided me in my=20

researches after my family."  "And these researches?"  "Were fruitless; cha=
nce did everything."=20

"You discovered what had become of your mother?"  "I learned that she had b=
een assassinated=20

by my relation, aided by four friends, but I was already aware that I had b=
een robbed of my wealth=20

and degraded from my nobility by King Charles I."  "Oh! I now understand wh=
y you are in the=20

service of Cromwell; you hate the king."  "Yes, my lord, I hate him!" said =
the young man.  Mazarin=20

marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man utt=
ered these words.=20

Just as, ordinarily, faces are colored by blood, his face seemed dyed by ha=
tred and became livid.=20

"Your history is a terrible one, Mr. Mordaunt, and touches me keenly; but h=
appily for you, you=20

serve an all-powerful master; he ought to aid you in your search; we have s=
o many means of=20

gaining information."  "My lord, to a well-bred dog it is only necessary to=
 show one end of a track;=20

he is certain to reach the other."  "But this relation you mentioned--do yo=
u wish me to speak to=20

him?" said Mazarin, who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwell's perso=
n.  "Thanks, my=20

lord, I will speak to him myself. He will treat me better the next time I s=
ee him."  "You have the=20

means, then, of touching him?"  "I have the means of making myself feared."=
  Mazarin looked at=20

the young man, but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head;=
 then, embarrassed=20

how to continue such a conversation, he opened Cromwell's letter.  The youn=
g man's eyes=20

gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profo=
und reverie. After=20

reading the first lines of the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to =
see if he was watching the=20

expression of his face as he read. Observing his indifference, he shrugged =
his shoulders, saying:=20

"Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time! Let us see wha=
t this letter=20



contains."  We here present the letter verbatim:  "To his Eminence, Monseig=
neur le Cardinal=20

Mazarini:  "I have wished, monseigneur, to learn your intentions relating t=
o the existing state of=20

affairs in England. The two kingdoms are so near that France must be intere=
sted in our situation,=20

as we are interested in that of France. The English are almost of one mind =
in contending against=20

the tyranny of Charles and his adherents. Placed by popular confidence at t=
he head of that=20

movement, I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its p=
robable results. I am at=20

present in the midst of war, and am about to deliver a decisive battle agai=
nst King Charles. I shall=20

gain it, for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with me.=
 This battle won by me, the=20

king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland; and if he is=
 not captured or killed, he=20

will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish=
 himself with arms and=20

money. France has already received Queen Henrietta, and, unintentionally, d=
oubtless, has=20

maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country. But Madame=
 Henrietta is a=20

daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France. As to Kin=
g Charles, the question=20

must be viewed differently; in receiving and aiding him, France will censur=
e the acts of the English=20

nation, and thus so essentially harm England, and especially the well-being=
 of the government,=20

that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities."  At t=
his moment Mazarin=20

became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to gl=
ance under his eyes=20

at the young man. The latter continued in thought. Mazarin resumed his read=
ing:  "It is important,=20

therefore, monseigneur, that I should be informed as to the intentions of F=
rance. The interests of=20

that kingdom and those of England, though taking now diverse directions, ar=
e very nearly the=20

same. England needs tranquillity at home, in order to consummate the expuls=
ion of her king;=20

France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of h=
er young monarch. You=20

need, as much as we do, that interior condition of repose which, thanks to =
the energy of our=20

government, we are about to attain.  "Your quarrels with the parliament, yo=
ur noisy dissensions=20

with the princes, who fight for you to-day and to-morrow will fight against=
 you, the popular following=20

directed by the coadjutor, President Blancmesnil, and Councillor Broussel--=
all that disorder, in=20

short, which pervades the several departments of the state, must lead you t=
o view with uneasiness=20

the possibility of a foreign war; for in that event England, exalted by the=
 enthusiasm of new ideas,=20

will ally herself with Spain, already seeking that alliance. I have therefo=
re believed, monseigneur,=20

knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the prese=
nt time, that you will=20

choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingd=
om and leave to her=20

own the new government of England. That neutrality consists simply in exclu=
ding King Charles=20

from the territory of France and in refraining from helping him--a stranger=
 to your country--with=20

arms, with money or with troops.  "My letter is private and confidential, a=
nd for that reason I send it=20

to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels. It anticipates, throu=
gh a sentiment which=20

your eminence will appreciate, measures to be taken after the events. Olive=
r Cromwell considered=20

it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarin's =
than to a queen=20

admirable for firmness, without doubt, but too much guided by vain prejudic=
es of birth and of divine=20

right.  "Farewell, monseigneur; should I not receive a reply in the space o=
f fifteen days, I shall=20

presume my letter will have miscarried.  "Oliver Cromwell."  "Mr. Mordaunt,=
" said the cardinal,=20

raising his voice, as if to arouse the dreamer, "my reply to this letter wi=
ll be more satisfactory to=20

General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given=
 one; go, therefore,=20



and await it at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and promise me to set out to-morrow morni=
ng."  "I promise, my=20

lord," replied Mordaunt; "but how many days does your eminence expect me to=
 await your reply?"=20

"If you do not receive it in ten days you can leave."  Mordaunt bowed.  "Th=
at is not all, sir,"=20

continued Mazarin; "your private adventures have touched me to the quick; b=
esides, the letter=20

from Mr. Cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador; come, tell m=
e, what can I do=20

for you?"  Mordaunt reflected a moment and, after some hesitation, was abou=
t to speak, when=20

Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal, whisp=
ered:  "My lord, the=20

Queen Henrietta Maria, accompanied by an English noble, is entering the Pal=
ais Royal at this=20

moment."  Mazarin made a bound from his chair, which did not escape the att=
ention of the young=20

man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make.  "Sir," said the ca=
rdinal, "you have=20

heard me? I fix on Boulogne because I presume that every town in France is =
indifferent to you; if=20

you prefer another, name it; but you can easily conceive that, surrounded a=
s I am by influences I=20

can only muzzle by discretion, I desire your presence in Paris to be unknow=
n."  "I go, sir," said=20

Mordaunt, advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered.  "No, =
not that way, I beg,=20

sir," quickly exclaimed the cardinal, "be so good as to pass by yonder gall=
ery, by which you can=20

regain the hall. I do not wish you to be seen leaving; our interview must b=
e kept secret."  Mordaunt=20

followed Bernouin, who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him wi=
th a doorkeeper,=20

showing him the way out.     38. Henrietta Maria and Mazarin.   The cardina=
l rose, and advanced=20

in haste to receive the queen of England. He showed the more respect to thi=
s queen, deprived of=20

every mark of pomp and stripped of followers, as he felt some self-reproach=
 for his own want of=20

heart and his avarice. But supplicants for favor know how to accommodate th=
e expression of their=20

features, and the daughter of Henry IV. smiled as she advanced to meet a ma=
n she hated and=20

despised.  "Ah!" said Mazarin to himself, "what a sweet face; does=20


_
a dust-cloth to remove every impurity from his mystic mirror,(764)     so t=
hat he should be enabled=20

to see in its lustre the faithful     reflection of Self.... First, this; t=
hen Tong-pa-nya,(765) lastly;=20

Samma Sambuddha.(766)   In _Chinese Buddhism_ a corroboration of these stat=
ements is to be=20

found in the aphorisms of Lin-tsi:       Within the body which admits sensa=
tions, acquires=20

knowledge,     thinks, and acts, there is the "true man without a position"=
 Wu-     wei-chen-jen. He=20

makes himself clearly visible; not the thinnest     separating film hides h=
im. Why do you not=20

recognise him?... If the     mind does not come to conscious existence, the=
re is deliverance=20

everywhere.... What is Buddha? _Ans._ A mind clear and at rest.     What is=
 the Law? _Ans._ A=20

mind clear and enlightened. What is     _Tau_? _Ans._ In every place absenc=
e of impediments=20

and pure     enlightenment. These three are one.   The reverend author of _=
Chinese Buddhism_=20

makes merry over the symbolism of Buddhist discipline. Yet the self-inflict=
ed "slaps on the cheek"=20

and "blows under the ribs" find their pendants in the mortifications of the=
 body and self-flagellation-

-"the discipline of the scourge"--of the Christian monks, from the first ce=
nturies of Christianity down=20

to our own day. But then the said author is a Protestant, who substitutes f=
or mortification and=20

discipline--good living and comfort. The sentence in the Lin-tsi,       The=
 "true man, without a=20

position," Wu-wei-chen-jen, is wrapped in     a prickly shell, like the che=
stnut. He cannot be=20

approached. This     is Buddha--the Buddha within you,   is laughed at. Tru=
ly       An infant cannot=20

understand the seven enigmas!      SOME PAPERS ON THE BEARING OF OCCULT=20

PHILOSOPHY ON LIFE.   NOTE.  Papers I. II. III. of the following were writt=
en by H. P. B. and=20

were circulated privately during her lifetime, but they were written with t=
he idea that they would be=20

published after a time. They are papers intended for students rather than f=
or the ordinary reader,=20

and will repay careful study and thought. The "Notes of some Oral Teaching"=
 were written down by=20

some of her pupils and were partially corrected by her, but no attempt has =
been made to relieve=20

them of their fragmentary borrow money of me?"  And he threw an uneasy glan=
ce at his strong=20

box; he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring, the b=
rilliancy of which drew=20

every eye upon his hand, which indeed was white and handsome.  "Your eminen=
ce," said the=20

august visitor, "it was my first intention to speak of the matters that hav=
e brought me here to the=20

queen, my sister, but I have reflected that political affairs are more espe=
cially the concern of men."=20

"Madame," said Mazarin, "your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinc=
tion."  "He is very=20

gracious," thought the queen; "can he have guessed my errand?"  "Give," con=
tinued the cardinal,=20

"your commands to the most respectful of your servants."  "Alas, sir," repl=
ied the queen, "I have=20

lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petiti=
ons. I am here to=20

petition you, too happy should my prayer be favorably heard."  "I am listen=
ing, madame, with the=20

greatest interest," said Mazarin.  "Your eminence, it concerns the war whic=
h the king, my husband,=20

is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects. You are perhaps ignorant=
 that they are fighting in=20

England," added she, with a melancholy smile, "and that in a short time the=
y will fight in a much=20

more decided fashion than they have done hitherto."  "I am completely ignor=
ant of it, madame,"=20

said the cardinal, accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the should=
ers; "alas, our own=20

wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor, incapable, infirm old mi=
nister like me."  "Well,=20

then, your eminence," said the queen, "I must inform you that Charles I., m=
y husband, is on the=20

eve of a decisive engagement. In case of a check" (Mazarin made a slight mo=
vement), "one must=20

foresee everything; in the case of a check, he desires to retire into Franc=
e and to live here as a=20



private individual. What do you say to this project?"  The cardinal had lis=
tened without permitting a=20

single fibre of his face to betray what he felt, and his smile remained as =
it ever was--false and=20

flattering; and when the queen finished speaking, he said:  "Do you think, =
madame, that France,=20

agitated and disturbed as it is, would be a safe retreat for a dethroned ki=
ng? How will the crown,=20

circle having expired.  ANNIE BESANT.     Paper I. A Warning.   There is a =
strange law in=20

Occultism which has been ascertained and proven by thousands of years of ex=
perience; nor has it=20

failed to demonstrate itself, almost in every case, during the years that t=
he Theosophical Society=20

has been in existence. As soon as anyone pledges himself as a "Probationer,=
" certain Occult=20

effects ensue. Of these the first is the _throwing outward_ of everything l=
atent in the nature of the=20

man; his faults, habits, qualities or subdued desires, whether good, bad or=
 indifferent.  For=20

instance, if a man be vain or a sensualist, or ambitious, whether by atavis=
m or by karmic heirloom,=20

those vices are sure to break out, even if he has hitherto successfully con=
cealed and repressed=20

them. They will come to the front weight?"  "The weight was not so heavy wh=
en I was in peril,"=20

interrupted the queen, with a sad smile, "and I ask no more for my husband =
than has been done=20

for me; you see that we are very humble monarchs, sir."  "Oh, you, madame,"=
 the cardinal=20

hastened to say, in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was comin=
g, "with regard to you,=20

that is another thing. A daughter of Henry IV., of that great, that sublime=
 sovereign----"  "All which=20

does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son-in-law, sir! Neverthel=
ess, you ought to=20

remember that that great, that sublime monarch, when proscribed at one time=
, as my husband=20

may be, demanded aid from England and England accorded it to him; and it is=
 but just to say that=20

Queen Elizabeth was not his niece."  "Peccato!" said Mazarin, writhing bene=
ath this simple=20

eloquence, "your majesty does not understand me; you judge my intentions wr=
ongly, and that is=20

partly because, doubtless, I explain myself in French."  "Speak Italian, si=
r. Ere the cardinal,=20


_
harder than before, until he kills all such tendencies in himself.  On the =
other hand, if he be good,=20

generous, chaste and abstemious, or has any virtue hitherto latent and conc=
ealed in him, it will=20

work its way out as irrepressibly as the rest. Thus a civilized man who hat=
es to be considered a=20

saint, and therefore assumes a mask, will not be able to conceal his true n=
ature, whether base or=20

noble.  THIS IS AN IMMUTABLE LAW IN THE DOMAIN OF THE OCCULT.  Its action i=
s the more=20

marked, the more earnest and sincere the desire of the candidate, and the m=
ore deeply he has felt=20

the reality and importance of his pledge.                    --------------=
-----------------------  The ancient=20

occult axiom, "Know Thyself," must be familiar to every student; but few if=
 any have apprehended=20

the real meaning of this wise exhortation of the Delphic Oracle. You all kn=
ow your earthly=20

pedigree, but who of you has ever traced all the links of heredity, astral,=
 psychic and spiritual,=20

which go to make you what you are? Many have written and expressed their de=
sire to unite=20

themselves with their Higher Ego, yet none seem to know the indissoluble li=
nk connecting their=20

"Higher Egos" with the One Universal SELF.  For all purposes of Occultism, =
whether practical or=20

purely metaphysical, such knowledge is absolutely requisite. It is proposed=
, therefore, to begin=20

these papers by showing this connection in all directions with the worlds: =
Absolute, Archetypal,=20

Spiritual, mother, Marie de Medicis, to die in exile, she taught us that la=
nguage. If anything yet=20

remains of that great, that sublime king, Henry, of whom you have just spok=
en, he would be much=20

surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound =
admiration of himself."  The=20

perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarin's brow.  "That admiration is, =
on the contrary, so great,=20

so real, madame," returned Mazarin, without noticing the change of language=
 offered to him by the=20

queen, "that if the king, Charles I.--whom Heaven protect from evil!--came =
into France, I would=20

offer him my house--my own house; but, alas! it would be but an unsafe retr=
eat. Some day the=20

people will burn that house, as they burned that of the Marechal d'Ancre. P=
oor Concino Concini!=20

And yet he but desired the good of the people."  "Yes, my lord, like yourse=
lf!" said the queen,=20

ironically.  Mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his =
own sentence, but=20

continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini.  "Well then, your e=
minence," said the=20

queen, becoming impatient, "what is your answer?"  "Madame," cried Mazarin,=
 more and more=20

moved, "will your majesty permit me to give you counsel?"  "Speak, sir," re=
plied the queen; "the=20

counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available." =
 "Madame, believe me,=20

the king ought to defend himself to the last."  "He has done so, sir, and t=
his last battle, which he=20

encounters with resources=20


_
Elemental. Before, however, we can touch upon the higher worlds--Archetypal=
, Spiritual and=20

Manasic--we must master the relations of the seventh, the terrestrial world=
, the lower Prakriti, or=20

Malkuth as in the Kabalah, to the worlds or planes which immediately follow=
 it.  OM.  "OM," says=20

the Aryan Adept, the son of the Fifth Race, who with this syllable begins a=
nd ends his salutation to=20

the human being, his conjuration of, or appeal to, non-human PRESENCES.  "O=
M-MANI," yield=20

without a struggle; but in case he is beaten?"  "Well, madame, in that case=
, my advice--I know that=20

I am very bold to offer advice to your majesty--my advice is that the king =
should not leave his=20

kingdom. Absent kings are very soon forgotten; if he passes over into Franc=
e his cause is lost."=20

"But," persisted the queen, "if such be your advice and you have his intere=
st at heart, send him=20

help of men and money, for I can do nothing for him; I have sold even to my=
 last=20


_
and after pausing he adds, "PADME-HUM."  This famous invocation is very err=
oneously translated=20

by the Orientalists as meaning, "Oh the Jewel in the Lotus." For although, =
literally, OM is a syllable=20

sacred to the Deity, PADME means "in the Lotus," and MANI is any precious s=
tone, still neither the=20

words themselves, nor their symbolical meaning, are thus really correctly r=
endered.  In this, the=20

most sacred of all Eastern formulas, not only has every syllable a secret p=
otency producing a=20

definite result, but the whole invocation has single ornament left, I shoul=
d have bought wood this=20

winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself."  "Oh, madame," said Maza=
rin, "your majesty=20

knows not what you ask. On the day when foreign succor follows in the train=
 of a king to replace=20

him on his throne, it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and=
 love of his own=20

subjects."  "To the point, sir," said the queen, "to the point, and answer =
me, yes or no; if the king=20

persists in remaining in England will you send him succor? If he comes to F=
rance will you accord=20

him=20
