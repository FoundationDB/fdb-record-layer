prototype of the latter, what for want of a better term we call the _manife=

(Causal Soul), one of the "seven" and chief reservoirs of the human Monads =
or Egos. The latter=20

are gradually formed and strengthened during their incarnation-cycle by con=
stant additions of=20

individuality from the personalities in which incarnates that androgynous, =
half-spiritual, half-

terrestrial principle, partaking of both heaven and earth, called by the Ve=
dantins Jiva and=20

Vijnanamaya Kosha, and by the Occultists the Manas (mind); that, in short, =
which uniting itself=20

partially with the Monad, incarnates in each new birth. In perfect unity wi=
th its (seventh) Principle,=20

the Spirit unalloyed, it is the divine Higher Self, as every student of The=
osophy knows. After every=20

new incarnation Buddhi-Manas culls, so to say, the aroma of the flower call=
ed personality, the=20

purely earthly residue of which--its dregs--is left to fade out as a shadow=
. This is the most difficult--

because so transcendentally metaphysical--portion of the doctrine.  As is r=
epeated many a time in=20

this and other works, it is not the Philosophers, Sages, and Adepts of anti=
quity who can ever be=20

charged with idolatry. It is they in fact, who, recognising divine unity, w=
ere the only ones, owing to=20

their initiation into the mysteries of Esotericism, to understand correctly=

every kind. Each, worshipping the one Divine Essence that pervades the whol=

reverenced, but never worshipped or idolised, any of these "Gods," whether =
high or low--not even=20

his own personal Deity, of which he was a Ray, and to whom he appealed.(100=
)       The holy=20

Triad emanates from the One, and is the Tetraktys; the     gods, daimons, a=
nd souls are an=20

emanation of the Triad. Heroes and     men repeat the hierarchy in themselv=
es.   Thus said=20

Metrodorus of Chios, the Pythagorean, the latter part of the sentence meani=
ng that man has within=20

himself the seven pale reflections of the seven divine Hierarchies; his Hig=
her Self is, therefore, in=20

itself but the refracted beam of the direct Ray. He who regards the latter =
as an Entity, in the usual=20

sense of the term, is one of the "infidels and atheists," spoken of by Epic=
urus, for he fastens on=20

that God "the opinions of the multitude"--an anthropomorphism of the grosse=
st kind.(101) The=20

Adept and the Occultist know that "what are styled the Gods are only the fi=
rst principles"=20

(Aristotle). None the less they are intelligent, conscious, and _living_ "P=
rinciples," the Primary=20

Seven Lights _manifested_ from Light _unmanifested_--which to us is Darknes=
s. They are the=20

Seven--exoterically four--Kumaras or "Mind-Born Sons" of Brahma. And it is =
they again, the Dhyan=20

Chohans, who are the prototypes in the morrow that he took a thick cloth an=

and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stea=

already quite ill and not expected to live.  Death by suffocation[928] may =
be considered as=20

presumptive of homicide unless the facts are already referable to accident.=
  In infants, suffocation=20

is, of course, either accidental or homicidal; in adults usually accidental=
. The absence of signs of a=20

struggle in adults suggests accident; unless there is cause of suspicion of=
 previous stupefying with=20

narcotics.  Taylor[929] calls attention to a dangerous practice among some =
attendants upon=20

infants, of putting into the mouth of the child to quiet it a bag containin=
g sugar; and instances a=20

case in which the child would have died of suffocation but for the fortunat=
e discovery of a part of=20

the bag protruding from the mouth.  In ten years, 3,612 deaths were reporte=
d in the city of London,=20



of infants smothered by being overlaid.[930]  Infants may be born into a ma=
ss of blood and f=C3=A6ces,=20

from which the unattended mother in her weakness may be unable to remove th=
em.   Page[931]=20

shows by experiment that the inspiratory effort when  violently exerted is =
sufficient to convey small=20

objects into the  air-passages. Cinders passed thus into the trachea and =
=C5=93sophagus of  kittens=20

and rabbits. Berenguier[932] experimented on new-born pups,  placing them i=
n ashes, plaster, and=20

starch. In ashes they lived  fifteen hours; these found their way into the =
middle of the =C5=93sophagus,=20

but were stopped at the glottis. Plaster and starch formed a paste  with th=
e oral mucus and the=20

movement of the mass was not so great  as the ashes. In no case did either =
of the materials pass=20

beyond  the glottis. Tardieu[933] examined three infants which had been  bu=
ried during life. One=20

was in ashes: the nose was obstructed, mouth  full: ashes also in the =C5=
=93sophagus and stomach,=20

but none in larynx  or bronchi. The second infant was in manure; a greenish=
 stuff was  found in the=20

mouth and stomach. The third in bran (confessed to by  the mother); the nos=
e and mouth were full,=20

but there was none in the  throat; a few grains in the trachea. Tardieu exp=
erimented on rabbits=20

and Guinea pigs by burying them in bran, sand, and gravel, some of  them be=
ing alive and the=20

others dead. In those buried alive he found  the substance filling the mout=
h and nose to the base=20

of the tongue;  in most of the cases the =C5=93sophagus and trachea were no=
t penetrated.  In the=20

animals first killed and then buried, the substance had not  passed into th=
e mouth or nose. In one=20

case only he found ashes in  the larynx and trachea of a rabbit which had b=
een buried many hours=20

after death in a box of ashes. Matthyssen[934] held a Guinea pig, head  dow=
nward, with its nose=20

under mercury; the lungs were full of globules  of mercury (which has a spe=
cific gravity of 13.5). A=20

dog was plunged  head first into liquid plaster-of-Paris; the plaster was f=
ound in the  bronchial=20

of which ladder of being=20

higher than even the Monotheism of the Protestant, say, who limits and cond=

whom he persists in seeing the Infinite, but whose supposed actions make of=
 that "Absolute and=20

Infinite" the most absurd paradox in Philosophy. From this standpoint Roman=
 Catholicism itself is=20

immeasurably higher and more logical than Protestantism, though the Roman C=
hurch has been=20
