On the Sunday evening, Ned Franks, usually so cheerful and brave in spirit,=
 was overpowered by=20

deeper depression than he had ever experienced since he had first met with =
Persis. He sat=20

gloomy and silent in the darkening twilight, with his hand pressed over his=
 eyes. Persis had just=20

placed her babe in his cradle, and drawing forward a footstool, she now sea=
ted upon the Rinds;=20

and as soon as the Syrup is taken off the Fire, put the Peels of five and t=
wenty Oranges into it; and=20

when the Liquor is quite cold, put in the Juice of the Oranges, with some f=
resh Ale-Yeast spread=20

upon a warm Toast of white Bread; let this work two days, and then put it i=
nto the Vessel or Cask,=20

adding at the same time, two Gallons of white _Port_=20


_
She longed to give comfort, yet scarcely ventured to speak, and at last, fe=
eling that the words of=20

the Lord were far more likely to soothe a troubled spirit than any of her o=
wn, she repeated very=20

softly, "_Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you_."  "If I had on=
ly that," said Franks,=20

sadly, as he removed his hand from his eyes, "I should care less for the tr=
oubles that have come=20

upon us thus. Do you know me so little, Persis, as to think that I'm so dow=
nhearted just because=20

we're in a few days to be turned out of our home, or because we've been dis=
appointed in these=20

letters from London? I do not say that I do not feel these things, but I sh=
ould be a coward if I could=20

not bear them, and a fool if I'd expected that troubles never would come." =
Then, suddenly=20

appearing to change the subject of conversation, Ned abruptly asked, "Did y=
ou hear what Mr.=20

Leyton said to me this afternoon when we had just come out of church?"  "No=
, I was speaking to=20

Nancy Sands."  "He said, 'Poor Stone is now sinking fast. The vicar himself=
 is going to administer=20

the communion to him--I fear for the last time--to-morrow evening at six. S=
tone told me that he=20

hoped that you and your wife would come over and partake of the Lord's Supp=
er with him, as he=20

owes more to you than to any one else upon earth!'"  "And what did you repl=
y, Ned?" asked=20

Persis.  "Nothing. Mr. Leyton noticed Nancy Sands at that moment, and turne=
d to ask her a=20

question, and, as you know, you and I then walked home."  "Surely," observe=
d Persis, "it will be a=20

satisfaction to us both--once more--in this dear, dear place--to"--She dare=
d not go on, lest her=20

voice should betray her distress at leaving the village.  "How can I share =
the feast of love,"=20

exclaimed Ned Franks, bitterly, "when my heart is full of hatred! I've been=
 searching and=20

examining myself ever since Mr. Leyton spoke, and I _dare not_ go to the Lo=
rd's table!" The=20

school-master rose from his seat, and began pacing up and down the room whi=
le continuing to=20

speak. "'To be in charity with all men,'--that is absolutely needful; witho=
ut that I should but profane=20

the holiest service. I can't Citron, or Syrup of Lemon, and in two Months t=
ime it be fit to bottle.  In=20

this Month it may not be unneccessary to observe that Oranges are declining=
, and waste apaces;=20

but they are commonly very cheap, and therefore such as have a great Call f=
or Orange-peel, as=20

Confectioners, _&c._ now buy them in quantities; but a little Carriage by L=
and will contribute to=20

their quicker decay. The Orange, tho' it is not found in every Garden, yet =
I esteem it as a=20

necessary Fruit in many Cases, and what a Family can hardly be without; and=
 truly considering=20

how good Oranges we might have in our Gardens, and how easily they may be c=
ultivated against=20

Garden-walls, I much wonder that they are not more generally planted with u=
s. There is a very=20

good Instance of their prospering well against a Wall, and thriving in the =
natural Ground, at Mr.=20

_Heather_'s, a curious Gentleman at _Tiwittenham_, which Trees bear very we=
ll, and bring very=20

large Fruit.  But as I have observ'd above, that this is the Season when fo=
reign Oranges are=20

generally in the greatest plenty about _London_, it is a good time to prese=
rve their Juice;=20

especially it may prove useful to such as have opportunities of vending _Pu=
nch_ in large=20

Quantitles, or for such who find that Liquor agreeable to them: For tho' I =
have known several who=20

have express'd the Juice of Oranges and Lemons, and bottled it up against a=
 dear Time, yet such=20

Juice has turn'd to be of a very disageeable Sourness in a short season. Th=
e Method which I have=20

taken to preserve this Juice to be used in Punch, was to express the Juice,=
 and pass it thro' a=20

Jelly-bag, with about two Ounces of double-refined Loaf-Sugar to each Pint =
of Juice, and a Pint of=20

Brandy, or Arrack; bottle this up, and cork it well with sound Corks, and y=
ou may keep it a Year.=20

Before you pass this Liquor thro' the Bag, you may put about the Rind of tw=
o Oranges to steep for=20



two Hours, into each Quart of Liquor, which will give it a rich Flavour. Wh=
en you have occasion to=20

use it for Punch, it is at the discretion of the Maker to add what quantity=
 of Brandy, or Arrack, he=20

thinks proper, only remembring that there is=20


_
my own heart,--I do hate and detest Sir Lacy, more for what he _is_ than fo=
r what he has done! So=20

I must keep away--like an outcast--from the feast to which I am so lovingly=
 invited; I must not=20

share it with my poor dying friend, or the pastor whom I reverence, though,=
 by keeping away, I=20

shall own before all the village that I know myself to be unworthy to join =
in Christian communion.=20

And if I am unfit to partake of the holy supper, I am also unfit to die, un=
fit to appear in the presence=20

of my God! O Persis!" exclaimed the agitated man, throwing Inn-keepers, _&c=
._ who live remote=20

from _London_; and by this way they need not run the hazard of losing this =
sort of Fruit, by=20

bruising or rotting, which they will be subject to, if they are not well pa=
ck'd, and have bad Roads.=20

And besides, considering the vast difference that there is in the Price of =
Oranges, so much, that at=20

some Seasons you must pay as much for one, as will at another time purchase=
 near a Dozen, it is=20

the best to consider of this when they are at the cheapest Price. We may li=
kewise use the same=20

Method with Lemons; but it is not=20
