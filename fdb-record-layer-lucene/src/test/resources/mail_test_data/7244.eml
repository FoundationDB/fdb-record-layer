 Slight hydr=C3=A6mia occurs in rapid submersion, but when the drowning has=
 taken place slowly a large amount of water passes into the blood. In certa=
in poisonings by opium this fluidity also exists; but it is _
been the heirloom, in common, of the whole of mankind, received from their =
Instructors, the "Sons=20

of Light," the primeval Seven. There was a time also when the Wisdom-Religi=
on was not=20

symbolical, for it became Esoteric only gradually, the change being necessi=
tated by misuse and by=20

the Sorcery of the Atlanteans. For it was the "misuse" only, and not the us=
e, of the divine gift that=20

led the men of the produced upon the living after a prolonged bath, notably=
 in the aged and=20

habitually unclean. Nor is the position of the tongue a special and distinc=
tive characteristic of=20

drowning. Only a few months ago I observed its presence in some of the vict=
ims of mechanical=20

suffocation in the Ford=E2=80=99s Theatre disaster in Washington.  The shru=
nken state of the genital organs=20

is apparently of little positive value as=20


_
Sorcery, and finally to become "forgetful of Wisdom"; while those of the Fi=
fth Race, the inheritors=20

of the Rishis of the Treta Yuga, used their powers to atrophise such gifts =
in mankind in general,=20

and then, as the "Elect Root," dispersed. Those who escaped the "Great Floo=
d" preserved only its=20

memory, and a belief founded on the knowledge of their direct fathers of on=
e remove, that such a=20

Science existed, and was now jealously guarded by the "Elect Root" exalted =
by Enoch. But there=20

must again come a time when man shall once more become what he was during t=
he second Yuga=20

(age), when his probationary cycle shall be over and he shall gradually bec=
ome what he was--

semi-corporeal and pure. Does not Plato, the Initiate, tell us in the _Phae=
drus_ all that man once=20

was, and that which he may yet again become:       Before man's spirit sank=
 into opposite state of=20

erection has been often observed, and Dr. Ogston states that he met semi-er=
ection in twenty-two=20

cases.  The value of =E2=80=9Cgoose-flesh=E2=80=9D as a link in the chain o=
f evidence is also weakened when we=20

consider that it frequently occurs after other violent modes of death. Anse=
rine skin is often met=20

with during life, and cases of drowning are recorded where this appearance =
has been absent.  The=20

aspect of the face and the general position of a drowned cadaver may likewi=
se vary according to=20

the mode of death. Immobility of the body in the attitude of agony, the hor=
rible grimaces of=20

asphyxia, the pale, calm features of syncope, and putrefactive changes are =
further circumstances=20

of medico-legal detail that may complicate the problem and render an autops=
y necessary in order=20

to invalidate or confirm the uncertain conclusions furnished by the=20


_
through the loss of his wings, he lived among the Gods in the airy     spir=
itual world where=20

everything is true and pure.(125)   Elsewhere he speaks of the time when me=
n did not perpetuate=20

themselves, but lived as pure spirits.  Let those men of Science who feel i=
nclined to laugh at this,=20

themselves unravel the mystery of the origin of the first man.  Unwilling t=
hat his chosen people--

chosen by him--should remain as grossly idolatrous as the profane masses th=
at surrounded them,=20

Moses utilised his knowledge of the   INTERNAL LESIONS.  Autopsies on the d=
rowned are=20

remarkable owing to their negative signs. But as an extension of diagnostic=
 means, the autopsy=20

may show the vertical (though not invariable) position of the epiglottis; t=
he presence of water and=20

foreign matter in the bronchi; swelling and emphysema of the lungs; hydr=C3=
=A6mic engorgement of the=20

liver; fulness of the right heart and emptiness of the left; fluidity of th=
e blood; water in the stomach=20

and middle ear; and a characteristic frothy mucus or lather more or less bl=
oody,=20


_
the Genesiacal Cosmogony in symbols and glyphs. This was more accessible to=
 the minds of the=20

_hoi polloi_ than the abstruse truths taught to the educated in the sanctua=
ries. He invented=20

nothing but the outward garb, added not one iota; but in this he merely fol=
lowed the example of=20

older nations and Initiates. If he clothed the grand truths revealed to him=
 by his Hierophant under=20

the most ingenious imagery, he did it to meet the requirements of the Israe=
lites; that stiff-necked=20

race would accept of no God unless He were as anthropomorphic as those of t=
he Olympus; and=20

he himself failed to foresee the times when highly educated statesmen would=
 be defending the=20

husks of the fruit of wisdom that grew the only constant post-mortem appear=
ance of drowning.=20

Examination of the respiratory apparatus is of extreme importance in a ques=
tion of this kind, for it=20

is contended that the presence of foreign bodies is a proof of submersion.[=
942]  This opinion is in=20

part erroneous, since it has been observed that when a body is submerged af=
ter death water will=20

penetrate the larynx, trachea, and remote bronchi, as well as the stomach a=
nd middle ear.=20

Moreover, Dr. Ogston states that in 48.7 per cent of cases of drowning no w=
ater was found in the=20

lungs.  The emphysematous condition of the lungs, which are said to force t=
heir way out of the=20

chest on removing the sternum, is difficult to distinguish from the=20


_
him on Mount Sinai, when communing with his own personal God--his divine Se=
lf. Moses=20

understood the great danger of delivering such truths to the selfish, for h=
e understood the fable of=20

Prometheus and remembered the past. Hence, he veiled them from the profanat=
ion of public gaze=20

and gave them out allegorically. And this is why his biographer says of him=
, that when he=20

descended from Sinai,       Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone =
... the drowned the lungs=20

disintegrate rapidly, while the heart, in which putrefaction begins chronol=
ogically, is relatively in a=20

good state of preservation.[943]  Since many cases have been observed in wh=
ich both sides of the=20

heart may be partly filled or both be empty and flaccid, or the left side d=
istended more than the=20

right, we are obliged to regard the exceptions concerning this post-mortem =
sign of drowning as co-

extensive with the rule.=20
