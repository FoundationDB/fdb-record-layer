ere the shouts that filled the room with pandemonium. One moment the strugg=
ling pair were over against the wall, the next they bumped the bed or knock=

this principle to the system of temperament in Prop. III, which flattens al=

ase the temperaments of the concords above that degree, and diminish those =

and half a head taller than the newcomer, and he had no other thought in hi=

could quickly regain his prestige and wipe out his _a_. Then the temperamen=

=3D _m_ ~ _x_, and that of _a_ =3D _m_ + _x_. Hence, as the dissonance head=
 in each, in a given=20

time, is in the compound ratio of its frequency of occurrence and its tempe=
rament, their aggregate=20

dissonance will be as    a =C2=B7 (m ~ x) + a =C2=B7 (m + x);  a quantity w=

was that Teeny-bits did not immediately fall an easy victim. They gave him =

heterogeneous, it must be a matter of judgment, rather than of mathematical=
 certainty, what=20

precise weight is to be given to each. We will give so much weight to the l=

make the temperament of each concord _inversely as its frequency_. We have =
then    a : a :: 1/(m=20

concords to be=20

accommodated, instead of two; and it is evident that all the pairs cannot h=
ave their temperament=20

inversely as their frequency, since the numbers _a_, _b_, &c. and _m_, _n_,=
 &c. have no constant=20

ratio to each other. This, however, will be the case, at a medium, if _x_ b=
