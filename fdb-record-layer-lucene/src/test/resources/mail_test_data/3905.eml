's: she _
reminds us of the cry of the Dart itself--its call for the human life that =
it demands each year--=20

"River of Dart, O River Dart,     Every year thou claimest a heart".  A sto=
ry tells how a farm lad=20

named Jan Coo was lured to his death by this calling of the river. It is tr=
ue that when the wind=20

blows strongly down the Dart valley a strange, strangled kind of cry comes =
from the gorge, which=20

at night-time is well calculated to strike a chill to the soul of the lonel=
y passer. But the wind on=20

Dartmoor can do more than this; it has given us a phantom-chase like that o=
f the Harz Mountains,=20

and the Wish-hounds that hunt the spirits of unchristened babes across the =
moors.  There is a=20

story of a farmer riding home to Chagford from Widecombe. He heard the demo=
n huntsman pass=20

with his yelling hounds. Perhaps the man had indulged too freely at the vil=
lage inn; certainly he=20

dared to hail the hunter and ask what sport. "Whatever the sport, you shall=
 have your share,"=20

came back the answer; and what he imagined to be a haunch of venison was hu=
rled into his arms.=20

But when he reached home, and his wife brought a light, they found that the=
 rush up stream that=20

caused Miss Carry's reel to shriek; and off she set after him (but with mor=
e circumspection this=20

time as regards her footing), getting in the line as rapidly as possible as=
 she went. Ronald now=20

came over and joined her, and this was comforting to her nerves.  Well, lon=
g before she had killed=20

that fish she had discovered the difference between loch-fishing and river-=
fishing; but she did kill=20

him in the end; and mightily pleased she was when she saw him lying on the =
sere wintry grass.=20

Ronald would have had her try again; but she had had enough; it was past lu=
nch time, and she=20

was hungry; moreover, she was tired; and then again she did not wish that h=
e should waste the=20

whole day.  So, when she had sate down for a while, and watched him tie the=
 salmon head and=20

tail, they set out for the village again, very well content; while as for t=
he slight wound she had=20

received by her ear catching on a twig of heather when she fell, that was q=
uite forgotten now.=20

'And ye are to have the fish,' said he.  'I told his lordship this morning =
you were going to try your=20

hand at the casting; and he said if you got one you would be=20


_
the dead body of their own little child.  But the moor is not always desola=
te and haunted; its=20

streams are not always wild dashing torrents, nor do they always trickle th=
rough black and=20

treacherous bog. To know the moorland thoroughly we must know it in all its=
 moods. A passing=20

cloud or a glorious sunset can work marvellous transformations.  Two Bridge=
s is a good spot to=20

begin the acquaintance. A bare road runs across the open down to a gentle h=
ollow, where it dips,=20

passes a narrow stream, and ascends again. The slopes around are almost as =
smooth as if their=20

formation was of chalk, not granite; this might be a corner of the Sussex D=
owns but for the jagged=20

tors that dream in of course.'  'Well, that is very kind; I suppose I must =
thank him if I see him?'  And=20

she was very curious to know all about Lord Ailine; and why he should come =
to Inver-Mudal=20

merely for these few hours; and what kind of people he brought with him in =
the autumn.  He=20

answered her as well as he could; and then they went on to other things--al=
l in a very gay and=20

merry mood, for he was as proud as she was over this achievement.  At the s=
ame moment Meenie=20

Douglas was in her own little room, engaged on a work of art of a not very =
ambitious kind.  She=20

had lying before her on the table a pencil-sketch in outline of such featur=
es of the landscape as=20

could be seen from the window--the=20


_
blue haze of the horizon. Stand for a few minutes on the bridge and let the=
 spirit of the place steal=20

into your heart; listen to the message of the Dart as it babbles beneath th=
e arches. Brook and=20

nothing more it is at present. But a reverie on the roadway is liable to be=
 disturbed by a sudden=20

dash of dust and savour of petrol. We may be driven from the road by Clebri=
g, and the little clump=20

of trees that sheltered the inn; and she was engaged in making a smaller co=
py of this drawing, in=20

pen and ink, on a paper-cutter of brown wood. She was not much of an artist=
, perhaps; but surely=20

these simple outlines were recognisable; and if they were to be entitled '_=
A Souvenir_,' and carried=20

away to the south as a little parting=20
