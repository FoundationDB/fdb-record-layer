and it's only after we're driven out of them that we realize we've been dri=
fting so long in the=20

doldrums of life. Then it comes home to us that there are the Dark Ages in =
the history of a woman=20

exactly as there were the Dark Ages in the history of Europe. Life goes on =
in those Dark Ages, but=20

it doesn't feel the call to articulate itself, to leave a record of its exp=
eriences. And that strikes me,=20

as I sit here and think of it, as about the deepest tragedy that can overta=
ke anything on this earth.=20

Nothing, after all, is sadder than silence, the silence of dead civilizatio=
ns and dead cities and dead=20

souls. And nothing is more costly. For beauty itself, in actual life, passe=
s away, but beauty lovingly=20

recorded by mortal hands endures and goes down to our children. And I stop =
writing, at that word=20

of "children," for miraculously, as I repeat it, I see it cut a window in t=
he unlighted house of my=20

heart. And that window is the bright little Gothic oriel which will always =
be golden and luminous=20

with love and will always send the last shadow scurrying away from the must=
iest corner of my=20

tower of life. I have my Dinkie and my Poppsy, and nothing can take them aw=
ay from me. It's on=20

them that I pin my hope.     _Sunday the laugh.'  "_Lord Anglesea_, (the Ge=
neral). 'Who lost a leg=20

at Waterloo; a tall, well-made man; wild, martial face, high forehead, with=
 a large hawk's nose,=20

which makes a small deep angle where it joins the forehead. A great deal of=
 ease in his manners.=20

Lauderdale [Footnote: Lord Lauderdale, d. 1339; the friend of Fox; since 18=
07, under the Tories,=20

an active member of the Opposition.] told us later that it was he who broug=
ht Lady Anglesea the=20

intelligence that her husband had lost his leg at Waterloo. Contrary to his=
 wishes she had been=20

informed of his arrival, and, before he could say a word, she guessed that =
he had brought her=20

news of her husband, screamed out, "He is dead!" and fell into hysterics. B=
ut when he said, "Not=20

in the least; here is a letter from him," she was so wonderfully relieved t=
hat she bore the truth with=20

great composure. He also related that, not long before the campaign, Angles=
ea was having his=20

portrait taken, and the picture was entirely finished except one leg. Angle=
sea sent for the painter=20

and said to him, "You had better finish the leg now. I might not bring it b=
ack with me." He lost that=20

very leg.'  "_The Minister. Lord Castlereagh_. 'Of middle height; a very st=
riking and at the same=20

time=20


_
I've been thinking a great deal over what's happened this last week or so. =
And I've been trying to=20

reorganize my life, the same as you put a house to rights after a funeral. =
But it wasn't a well-

ordered funeral, in this case, and I was denied even the tempered satisfact=
ion of the bereaved=20

after the finality of a smoothly conducted burial. For nothing has been set=
tled. It's merely that Time=20

has been trying to encyst what it can not absorb. I felt, for a day or two,=
 that I had nothing much to=20

live for. I felt like a feather-weight who'd faced a knock-out. I saw Pride=
 go to the mat, and take the=20

count, and if I was dazed, for a while, I suppose it was mostly convalescen=
ce from shock. Then I=20

tightened my belt, and reminded myself that it wasn't the first wallop Fate=
 had given me, and=20

remembered that in this life you have to adjust yourself to your environmen=
t or be eliminated from=20

the game. And life, I suppose, has tamed me, as a man who once loved me sai=
d it would do. The=20

older I get the more tolerant I try to be, and the more I know of this worl=
d the more I realize that=20

Right is seldom all on one side and Wrong on the other. It's a matter of gi=
ve and take, this problem=20

of traveling in double-harness. I can even smile a little, as I remember th=
at college day in my teens=20

when Matilda-Anne and Katrina and Fanny-Rain-in-the-Face and myself solemnl=
y discussed man=20

and his make-up, over a three-pound box of Maillard's, and resolutely agree=
d that we would=20

surrender our hearts to no suitor over twenty-six and marry no male who'd e=
ver loved another=20

woman--not, at least, unless the situation had become compensatingly romant=
icized by the death=20

of any such lady preceding us in our loved one's favor. Little we knew of m=
en and ourselves and=20

the humiliations with which life breaks the spirit of arrogant youth! For e=
ven now, knowing what I=20

know, I've been doing my best to cooper together a case for my unstable old=
 Dinky-Dunk. I've=20

been trying to keep the thought of poor dead Lady Alicia out of my head. I'=
ve been wondering if=20

there's any truth in what Dinky-Dunk said, a few weeks ago, about a mere fa=
ther being like the=20

male of the warrior-spider whom the female of the species stands ready to d=
ine upon, once she's=20

assured of her progeny.  I suppose I _have_ given most of my time and atten=
tion to my children.=20

And it's as perilous, I suppose, to give your heart to a man and then take =
it even partly away again=20

as it is to give a trellis to a rose-bush and then expect it to stand alone=
. My husband, too, has been=20

restless and dissatisfied with prairie life during the last year or so, has=
 been rocking in his own=20

doldrums of inertia where the sight of even the humblest ship--and the Wand=
ering pleasant and=20

gentle, yet perfectly natural. One misses in him a certain culture which on=
e expects in a statesman=20

of his eminence. He speaks French badly, in fact execrably, and not very ch=
oice English.=20

[Footnote: Lord Byron, in the introduction to the sixth and the eighth cant=
os of "Don Juan" says, "It=20

is the first time since the Normans that England has been insulted by a min=
ister (at least) who=20

could not speak English, and that Parliament permitted itself to be dictate=
d to in the language of=20

Mrs. Malaprop."] The Princess rallied him on the part he played in the Hous=
e of Commons as a=20

bad speaker, as against the brilliant orators of the Opposition, which he a=
cknowledged merrily,=20

and with a hearty laugh. I am sure there is a great deal of thoughtless ind=
ifference in him, and that=20

this has sometimes been reckoned to him as statesmanship of a high order.'"=
  In proof of=20

Castlereagh's bad French we are told in a note that, having to propose the =
health of the ladies at a=20

great dinner, he did it in the words--"Le bel sexe partoutte dans le monde.=
"  Though looked down=20

upon at the second table, Stockmar had thoroughly established himself in th=
e confidence and=20

affection of the Prince and Princess. He had become the Prince's Secretary,=
 and in Leopold's own=20

words "the most valued physician of his soul and body"--wirepuller, in fact=
, to the destined=20



wirepuller of Royalty in general.  Perhaps his gratification at having atta=
ined this position may have=20

lent a roseate tint to his view of the felicity of the Royal couple, which =
he paints in rapturous terms,=20

saying that nothing was so great as their love--except the British National=
 Debt. There is, however,=20

no reason to doubt that the union of Leopold and Charlotte was one of the h=
appy exceptions to the=20

general character of Royal marriages. Its tragic end plunged a nation into =
mourning. Stockmar,=20

with a prudence on which perhaps he reflects with a little too much satisfa=
ction, refused to have=20

anything to do with the treatment of the Princess from the commencement of =
her pregnancy. He=20

thought he detected mistakes on the part of the English physicians, arising=
 from the custom then=20

prevalent in England of lowering the strength of the expectant mother by bl=
eeding, aperients, and=20

low diet, a regimen which was carried on for months. The Princess, in fact,=
 having been delivered=20

of a dead son after a fifty hours' labour, afterwards succumbed to weakness=
. It fell to Stockmar's=20

lot to break the news to the Prince, who was overwhelmed with sorrow. At th=
e moment of his=20

desolation Leopold exacted from Stockmar a promise that he would never leav=
e him. Stockmar=20

gave the promise, indulging at the same time his sceptical vein by expressi=
ng in a letter=20


_
seemed to me as soft and shapeless as a boned squab-pigeon!--could promptly=
 elicit an=20

answering signal.  But I strike a snag there, for Alsina has not been so bo=
neless as I anticipated.=20

There was an unlooked-for intensity in her eyes and a mild sort of tragedy =
in her voice when she=20

came and told me that she was going to another school in the Knee-Hill coun=
try and asked if I=20

could have her taken in to Buckhorn the next morning. Some one, of course, =
had to go. There was=20

one too many in this prairie home that must always remain so like an island=
 dotting the lonely=20

wastes of a lonely sea. And triangles, oddly enough, seem to flourish best =
in city squares. But=20

much as I wanted to talk to Alsina, I was compelled to respect her reserve.=
 I even told her that=20

Dinkie would miss her a great deal. She replied, with a choke in her voice,=
 that he was a wonderful=20

child. That, of course, was music to the ears of his mother, and my respect=
 for the tremulous Miss=20

Teeswater went up at least ten degrees. But when she added, without meeting=
 my eye, that she=20

was really fond of the boy, I couldn't escape the impression that she doubt=
 whether the Prince=20

would remain of the same mind. This scepticism however did not interfere wi=
th his devotion. "My=20

health is tolerable, for though I am uncommonly shaken, and shall be yet mo=
re so by the sorrow of=20

the Prince, still I feel strong enough, even stronger than I used to be. I =
only leave the Prince when=20

obliged by pressing business. I dine alone with him and sleep in his room. =
Directly he wakes in the=20

night I get up and sit talking by his bedside till he falls asleep again. I=
 feel increasingly that=20

unlooked for trials are my portion in life, and that there will be many mor=
e of them before life is=20

over. I seem to be here more to care for others than for myself, and I am w=
ell content with this=20

destiny."  Sir Richard Croft, the accoucheur of the Princess, overwhelmed b=
y the calamity,=20

committed suicide. "Poor Croft," exclaims the cool and benevolent Stockmar,=
 "does not the whole=20

thing look like some malicious temptation, which might have overcome even s=
ome one stronger=20

than you? The first link in the chain of your misery was nothing but an esp=
ecially honourable and=20

desirable event in the course=20
