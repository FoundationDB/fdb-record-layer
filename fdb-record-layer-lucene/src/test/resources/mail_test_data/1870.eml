authority and of the selectmen of the town.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of 

Ed_., 1871, p. 331; and May, _Letters to A.T. Judson, Esq., and Others_, p. 5.]  [Footnote 2: 

_Ibid_., p. 5.]  The enactment of this law caused Canterbury to go wild with joy. Miss Crandall was 

arrested on the 27th of June, and committed to await her trial at the next session of the Supreme 

Court. She and her friends refused to give bond that the officials might go the limit in imprisoning 

her. Miss Crandall was placed in a murderer's cell. Mr. May, who had stood by her, said when he 

saw the door locked and the key taken out, "The deed is done, completely done. It cannot be 

recalled. It has passed into the history of our nation and age." Miss Crandall was tried the 23d of 

August, 1833, at Brooklyn, the county seat of the county of   A dissolute crew that good Christians 

condemn'--   This is the way they keep talking, as if   I did not know _Harry_ was one of them! 

'Shouting and swearing, and heated and flush'd,   All talking together, and running pell mell,   Out 

to the cliff from the village they rush'd,   And two men were fighting, and one man fell.'   And the 

man who fell over the dreadful edge,   For ever lost, and for ever must be;   There was never a 

sandbank, rock, or ledge,   There was _nothing_ but the pitiless sea!    I hear it said, without doubt 

or surmise,   Over and over and over again,   The man who was murder'd was Jack Devize,   And 

the man who murder'd him, Harry Vane!       I dream I am standing on purple heights,   Alone and 

alone for ever and aye;   The sun is shining with pitiless lights;   I pray that darkness may cover the 

sky.    I

verdict, doubtless because Joseph Eaton, who presided, had given it as his opinion that the law 

was probably unconstitutional. At the second trial before Judge Dagget of the Supreme Court, who 

was an advocate of the law, Miss Crandall was convicted. Her counsel, however, filed a bill of 

exceptions and took an appeal to the Court of Errors. The case came up on the 22d of July, 1834. 

The nature of   Alone and alone for ever and aye;   Parch'd and dry is the terrible land;   I pray but 

for water before I die.    I dream I am tossing on ocean waves,   Alone and alone for ever and aye; 

I shudder to think of the open graves;   Under daisy blossoms I pray to lie.    O daisy buds I am 

dreaming of _you_,   Alone and alone for ever and aye;   From a dream of daisies scatter'd with 

dew   I wake

discussed by W.W. Ellsworth and Calvin Goddard, who maintained that it was unconstitutional, 

and by A.T. Judson and C.F. Cleveland, who undertook to prove its constitutionality. The court 

reserved its decision, which was never given. Finding that there were defects in the information 

prepared by the attorney for the State, the indictment was quashed. Because of subsequent 

attempts to destroy the building,    Let me but dream of affliction and shame,   Of saints that 

punish and sinners that cower,   Of troubles by sickness and sword and flame,   And _not_ of an 

innocent daisy flower!    I am haunted by words--by seven words--   Seven words echoing 

everywhere;   They are borne on breezes, and sung by birds,   They are written on earth and sea 

and air.    I think there is nothing else is my own;   I think
