philodendron monstera Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.  1.F.  1.=
F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort=
 to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public dom=
ain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.  Despite these e=
fforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they=
 may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incompl=
ete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a by travellers. A s=
pecies of marten has lately been presented to the Lyceum of Natural History=
 in New-York, which was brought from that country, and appears to belong to=
 a peculiar species, very different from the common martens of Europe, Asia=
, and America, although it has, in common with it, the character of the yel=
low throat; but the head, feet, and tail, afford so many peculiar character=
s, that no doubt can be entertained of its diversity. I have, therefore, gi=
ven to it the name of philodendron monstera Foundation as set forth in Sect=
ion 3 below.  1.F.  1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expe=

We hope that this research will be prosecuted in the manner it has thus bee=

evidently affords an excellent criterion of the actual temperature, on a sc=
ale more extensive than it=20

is practicable to obtain from thermometrical registers.  Floral Calendars k=

XVI. _A Journal of the Progress of Vegetation near Philadelphia between the=
 20th of February and=20

the 20th of May, 1816, with occasional Zoological Remarks._ By C. S. RAFINE=
SQUE.   The=20

importance of observations on the annual progress of vegetation is obvious,=
 and, as connected=20

with agriculture, gardening, &c., eminently useful. Comparative observation=
s acquire a particular=20



degree of interest, when made by skilful observers, at the same time, but a=
t different places. Dr.=20

Bigelow, of Boston, issued a circular, proposing that such contemporaneous =
observations should=20

be made in the spring of 1817; and I wish that his request may have been at=
tended to, when the=20

collection of those observations may afford valuable materials for an Ameri=
can Calendar of Flora.=20

The blossoming of plants is easily watched, but their foliation and budding=
 ought not to be=20

neglected. Having been prevented, by various causes, from keeping an exact =
record of the=20

progress of vegetation near New-York in 1817, I submit an accurate journal =
which I had kept the=20

year before, at Philadelphia, in which I hope that some interesting facts m=
ay be noticed. Dr.=20

Benjamin Barton has published a sketch of a Calendar of Flora for Philadelp=
hia, in his Fragments=20

on the Natural History of Pennsylvania; by comparing it with mine, many mat=
erial differences may=20

be traced, which evince a gradual change of temperature, although the sprin=
g of 1816 was=20

remarkably cold and late. The greater quantity of species observed by me ma=
y, besides, render=20

this journal a sort of vernal Flora of the neighbourhood of Philadelphia; a=
nd many species found by=20

me are not to be met in the _Flora Philadelphica_ of Dr. William Barton.   =
_February_ 20. The=20

the first larva of insect in a pond.  27. The _Motacilla sialis_, or bluebi=
rd, is heard for the first time.=20

28. The first shad (_Clupea sapidissima_) is taken in the Delaware, while o=
n the same day, the=20

first smelt (_Salmo eperlanoides_) was taken in the Raritan, at New-Brunswi=

_Tulipa gesneriana_, and _Hesperis matronalis_, are in blossom at the windo=
ws: the suckers=20

(_genus Catostomus_) appear in the fish-market.  2. The catkins of the _Aln=

to swell.  3. Those of _Salix Caprea_ begin to appear.  4. The grass looks =
green by patches in the=20
