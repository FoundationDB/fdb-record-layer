 La Certe's wigwam, involved in the mists of meditation and tobacco-smoke, =
gazing at Slowfoot. dracaena marginata his heavy fist crashing down upon th=

promise was conditional, remember. I want that cattle out of Nantes--I want=
 the bread they eat--I=20

want the room they occupy. I can't allow you to play fast and loose with th=
em indefinitely--a week=20

is quite long enough----"  "Three days," corrected Martin-Roget once more. =
 "Well! three days or=20

eight," rejoined the other roughly. "Too long in any case. I must be rid of=
 them out of this city or I=20

shall have all the spies of the Convention about mine ears. I am beset with=
 spies, citizen Martin-

Roget, yes, even I--Jean Baptiste Carrier--the most selfless the most devot=
ed patriot the Republic=20

has ever known! Mine enemies up in Paris send spies to dog my footsteps, to=
 watch mine every=20

action. They are ready to pounce upon me at the slightest slip, to denounce=
 me, to drag me to=20

their bar--they have already whetted the knife of the guillotine which is t=
o lay low the head of the=20

finest patriot in France----"  "Hold on! hold on, Jean Baptiste my friend,"=
 here broke in young=20

Lalouet with a sneer, "we don't want protestations of the farm.  No--ever s=
ince mother died, I've=20

stuck to Little Bill through thick and thin.  So I _won't_ go."  It was so =
evident that Archie Sinclair's=20

mind was made up and fixed, and also so obvious that a delicate little boy =
would be a great=20

encumbrance on a hunting expedition that Dan thought of attempting the expe=
dient of winning=20

Little Bill himself over to his side.  He had no difficulty in doing that, =
for Billie was to the full as=20

amiable and unselfish as his brother.  After a short conversation, he made =
Billie promise to do his=20

very best to induce Archie to go with the hunters and leave him behind.  "F=
or you know, Little Bill,"=20

said Dan in conclusion, and by way of consoling him, "although nobody could=
 take such good care=20

of you as Archie, or make up to you for him, Elspie would take his place ve=
ry well for a time--."  "O=20

yes, I know that well enough," said the poor boy with some enthusiasm; "Els=
pie is always very=20

good to me.  You've no notion how nice she is, Dan."  "Hm! well, I have got=
 a sort of a half notion,=20


_
It is nearly dinner time."  Carrier had been carried away by his own eloque=
nce. At Lalouet's=20

mocking words he pulled himself together: murmured: "You young viper!" in t=
ones of tigerish=20

affection, and then turned back to Martin-Roget and resumed more calmly:  "=
They'll be a peculiar=20

look.  "But that's all right, then.  You'll do what you can to persuade Arc=
hie, and--there he is,=20

evidently coming to see you, so I'll go and leave you to talk it over with =
him."  Billie did not give his=20

brother time to begin, but accosted him on his entrance=20


_
Kernogan rabble here any longer. So I must be rid of them, citizen Martin-R=
oget ... say within the=20

next four-and-twenty hours...." He paused for a moment or two, then added d=
rily: "That is my last=20

word, and you must see to it. What is it you do want to do with them enfin?=
"  "I want their death,"=20

replied this hunting expe--"  "O! you've heard of it, then?"  "Yes, and I w=
ant you to go, very very=20

much, because--because--"  "Don't trouble yourself with _becauses_, Little =
Bill, for I won't go. So=20

there's an end of it--unless," he added, as if a thought had suddenly occur=
red to him, "unless they=20

agree to take you=20
