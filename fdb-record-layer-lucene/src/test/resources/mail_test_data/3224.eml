     The calumnies set afloat against Apollonius were as numerous as     th=
ey were false. So late as eighteen centuries after his death he     was def=
amed by Bishop offence. Besides, in such cases, during the struggle between=
 legal duty on the one hand and professional honor on the other, the latter=
, aided by a strong sense of the injustice and inhumanity of the rule, will=
 in _
as in the case of the latter, sometimes facts and historical events are pre=
sented to the world under=20

the colours of fiction. The journey to India represents in its every stage,=
 though of course=20

allegorically, the trials of a Neophyte, giving at the same time a geograph=
ical and topographical=20

idea of a certain country as it is even now, if one knows where to look for=
 it. The long discourses of=20

Apollonius with the Brahmans, their sage advice, and the dialogues with the=
 Corinthian Menippus=20

would, if interpreted, give the Esoteric Catechism. His visit to the empire=
 of the wise men, his=20

interview with their king Hiarchas, the oracle of Amphiaraus, explain symbo=
lically many of the=20

secret dogmas of Hermes--in the generic sense of the name--and of Occultism=
. Wonderful is this=20

to relate, and were not the statement supported by numerous calculations al=
ready made, and the=20

secret already half revealed, the writer would never have dared to say it. =
The travels of the great=20

Magus are correctly, though allegorically described--that is to say, all th=
at is related by Damis had=20

actually taken place--but the narrative is based upon the Zodiacal signs. A=
s _transliterated_ by=20

Damis under the guidance of Apollonius and _translated_ by Philostratus, it=
 is a marvel indeed. At=20

the conclusion of what may now be related of the wonderful Adept of Tyana o=
ur meaning will=20

become clearer. Suffice it to say for the present that the dialogues spoken=
 of would disclose, if=20

correctly understood, some of the most important secrets of Nature. Eliphas=
 Levi points out the=20

great resemblance which exists between King Hiarchus and the fabulous Hiram=
, from whom=20

Solomon procured the cedars of Lebanon and the gold of Ophir. But he keeps =
silent as to another=20

resemblance of which, as a learned Kabalist, he could not be ignorant. More=
over, according to his=20

invariable custom, he mystifies the reader more than he teaches him, divulg=
ing nothing and=20

leading him off the right track.  Like most of the historical heroes of hoa=
ry antiquity, whose lives=20

and works strongly differ from those of commonplace humanity, Apollonius as=
 a clairvoyant must=20

be held to the standard of regular practising physicians in the neighborhoo=
d where the clairvoyant=20

operates. Nelson _v._ Harrington, 72 Wis., 591; Bibber _v._ Simpson, 59 Me.=

 from a consideration=20

of the cases that are usually cited as authority for the English rule: Anne=

_
this day a riddle, which has, so far, found no OEdipus. His existence is su=
rrounded with such a veil=20

of mystery that he is often mistaken for a myth. But according to every law=
 of logic and reason, it is=20

quite clear that Apollonius should never be regarded in such a light. If th=
e Tyanean Theurgist may=20

be put down as a fabulous character, then history has no right to her Caesa=
rs and Alexanders. It is=20

quite true that this Sage, who stands unrivalled in his thaumaturgical powe=
rs to this day--on=20

evidence historically attested--came into the arena of public life no one s=
eems to know whence,=20

and disappeared from it, no one seems to know whither. But the reasons for =
this are evident.=20

Every means was used--especially during the fourth and fifth centuries of o=
ur era--to sweep from=20

people's minds the remembrance of this great and holy man. The circulation =
of his biographies,=20

which were many and enthusiastic, was prevented by the Christians, and for =
a very good reason,=20

as we shall see. The diary of Damis survived most miraculously, and remaine=
d alone to tell the=20

tale. But it must not be forgotten that Justin Martyr often speaks of Apoll=
onius, and the character=20

and truthfulness of this good man are unimpeachable, the more in that he ha=
d good reasons to=20

feel bewildered. Nor can it be denied that there is hardly a Church Father =
of the first six centuries=20

that left Apollonius unnoticed. Only, according to invariable Christian cus=
toms of charity, their pens=20

were dipped as usual in the blackest ink of _odium theologicum_, intoleranc=
e and one-sidedness.=20

St. Jerome (Hieronymus) gives at length the story of St. John's alleged con=
test with the Sage of=20

Tyana--a competition of "miracles"--in which, of course, the truthful saint=
(233) describes in glowing=20

colours the defeat of Apollonius, and seeks corroboration in St. John's _Ap=
ocrypha_ proclaimed=20

doubtful _even_ by the Church.(234)  Therefore it is that nobody can say wh=
ere or when=20

Apollonius was born, and everyone is equally ignorant of the date at which,=
 and of the place where=20

he died. Some think he was eighty or ninety years old at the time of his de=
ath, others that he was=20

one hundred or even one hundred and seventeen. But, whether he ended his da=
ys at Ephesus in=20

the year 96 A.D., as some say, or whether the event took place at Lindus in=
 the temple of Pallas-=20

Athene, or whether again he disappeared from the temple of Dictynna, or whe=
ther, as others=20

maintain, he did not die at all, but when a hundred years old renewed his l=
ife by Magic, and went=20

on working for the benefit of humanity, no one can tell. The Secret Records=
 alone have noted his=20

birth and subsequent career. But then--"who hath believed in _that_ report?=
"  All that history=20

knows is that Apollonius was the enthusiastic founder of a new school of co=
ntemplation. Perhaps=20

less metaphorical and (1880).  1 Phillips Ev., p. 136; Starkie Ev., p. 40; =

Expert Testimony, s. 45; Reynolds=E2=80=99 Theory of Evidence, s. 86.  It i=
s to be noted that none of the=20

cases which are cited as authority for the common-law rule as usually state=
d are really precedents=20

to that extent. The cases of the Duchess of Kingston (_supra_); Lord Willia=
m Russel (9 How. St.=20

Tr., 602); Dr. Ratcliff (9 How. St. Tr., 582); Earl Ferrers (19 How. St. Tr=
., 886), and Rex _v._=20

Gibbons (_supra_), were all criminal prosecutions; and in Annesley _v._ Ang=
lesea, Wilson _v._=20

Rastall, Broad _v._ Pitt, and Greenough _v._ Gaskell (_supra_), which were =
civil causes, the=20

question of the privilege of a medical man was not really in dispute. It is=
 well settled that=20

communications between attorney and client are privileged, and yet Judge Pi=
tt Taylor expresses=20

some doubt whether the protection cannot be removed without the client=E2=
=80=99s consent in cases where=20

the interests of _criminal justice_ require the production of the evidence =
(Taylor Ev., s. 929). This=20

intimation of a distinction between criminal and civil actions, even in the=
 case of attorneys,=20



suggests the possibility of a difference between those two classes of actio=
ns in the case of=20

medical men. The cases cited establish authoritatively that in criminal pro=
secutions, at common=20

law, confidential communications between medical man and patient are not pr=
ivileged; but in civil=20

causes, the opinions of the eminent judges seem to be _obiter dicta_. It is=
, however, established=20

by other decisions that mere confidential relations do not prevent the disc=
losure of=20

communications. (For the case of _bankers_, see Loyd _v._ Freshfield, 2 C. =

reasonable doubt that independent of statute, in civil as well as criminal =

his predecessor, and sought to offer "peace on earth and good will" to _all=
