 QUEER RACING-CRAFT.   The=20

illustrations on this page are of two varieties of sail-boats that are very=
 common in the vicinity of=20

New York, and quite rare in other parts of the country. They are boats buil=
t expressly for speed,=20

and are used almost entirely for racing.  The upper of the two pictures rep=
resents a regatta of swift=20

sailing craft that, as can be readily seen, would be totally unfit for a cr=
uise of any length, nor would=20

they be of much use in ordinary pleasure-sailing. They are very light of dr=
aught, have no cabin, are=20

apparently very much oversparred, and carry sails out of all proportion to =
their size. Most of them=20

are sloop-rigged, and the main-booms are so long that, in order to control =
the sail at all, the main-

sheet is trimmed from the end of a platform that overhangs the stern of the=
 boat. Out on this is=20

seated a skillful boatman, whose whole attention is given to the main-sheet=
.  These boats have=20

very large centre-boards, and in races carry crews of from twelve to twenty=
 men, whose duty it is=20

to shift from side to side the many sand-bags that are carried as ballast. =
Extraordinary speed is=20

made by these boats, and thousands of dollars are often wagered on races be=
tween two or more=20

of them.  Some of them have become so famous for speed that their names are=
 seen in the=20

papers almost as often as those of noted race-horses. Among these famous bo=
ats are the _Susie=20

S._, _Brown_, _Nettle_, _Martha M._, _Dare-Devil_, _Silence_, and many othe=
rs, the names of=20

which might be mentioned if they could be recalled. The _Susie S._ and _Bro=
wn_ are now known=20

as the _Albertina_ and _Lady Emma_.  Quite a different-looking craft is tha=
t shown in the second=20

picture on the same page. It is a catamaran--a style of boat that has only =
been known in New York=20

waters during the past four years, and which is still so rare as to excite =
much curiosity. A=20

catamaran consists of two long, narrow, canoe-like hulls, connected by stro=
ng wooden cross=20

pieces, which are fastened at the ends with ball-and-socket joints, so that=
 each hull moves up and=20

down with the motion of the waves, independent of the other. These it went =
there; his shoulders=20

sloping and his back bent in a perpetual squirm, Mohanna shuffled through t=
he world with the=20

exterior of a pimp, but yet with certain aspirations towards a wild life wh=
ich seldom are entirely=20

absent from any member of the Arab race.  So in his village of the Lebanon =
he grew to man=E2=80=99s=20

estate, and drifted after the fashion of his countrymen into a precarious b=
usiness in the East.  Half=20

proxenete, half dragoman, servile to all above him and civil for prudence=
=E2=80=99 sake to all below, he=20

passed through the various degrees of hotel tout, seller of cigarettes, and=
 guide to the antiquities=20



of whatever town he happened to reside in, to the full glory of a shop in w=
hich he sold=20

embroideries, attar of roses, embroidered slippers and all the varied trash=
 which tourists buy in the=20

bazaars of the Levant.  But all the time, and whilst he studied French and =
English with a view to=20

self-advancement, the ancient glories of the Arab race were always in his m=
ind.  Himself a=20

Christian of the Christians, reared in that hotbed of theology the Lebanon,=
 where all the creeds=20

mutually show their hatred of each other, and display themselves in their m=
ost odious aspects;=20

and whilst hating the Mohammedans as a first principle of his belief, he fo=
und himself mysteriously=20

attracted to their creed.  Not that his reason was seduced by the teachings=
 of the Koran, but that=20

somehow the stately folly of the whole scheme of life evolved by the ex-cam=
el-driver appealed to=20

him, as it has oftentimes appealed to stronger minds than his.  The call to=
 prayers, the half-

contemplative, half-militant existence led by Mohammedans; the immense simp=
licity of their=20

hegemony; the idea of a not impossible one God, beyond men=E2=80=99s ken, l=
ooking down frostily through=20

the stars upon the plains, a Being to be evoked without much hope of being =
influenced, took hold=20

of him and set him thinking whether all members of the Arab race ought not =
to hold one faith.  And=20

in addition to his speculations upon faith and race, vaguely at times it cr=
ossed his mind, as I=20

believe it often crosses the minds of almost every Arab (and Syrians not a =
few), =E2=80=9CIf all else fail, I=20

can retire into the desert, join the tribes and pass a pleasant life, sure =
of a wife or two, a horse, a=20

lance, a long flint gun, a bowl of camel=E2=80=99s milk, and a black tent i=
n which to rest at night.=E2=80=9D  Little=20

indeed are the chances of a young educated Syrian to make his living in the=
 Lebanon.  A certain=20

modicum of the young men is always absorbed into the ranks of the various t=
rue faiths which send=20

out missionaries to convert Arab-speaking races, and those so absorbed gene=
rally pass their lives=20

preaching shamefacedly that which they partially believe, to those whose fa=
ith is fixed.  Others=20

again gravitate naturally to Cairo to seek for Government employment, or to=
 write in the Arabic=20

press, taking sides for England or for France, as the editors of the opposi=
ng papers make it worth=20

their while.  But the great bulk of the intellectual Syrian proletariat emi=
grates to New York and=20

there lives in a quarter by itself, engaging in all kinds of little industr=
ies, dealing in Oriental=20

curiosities, or publishing newspapers in the Arab tongue. There they pass m=
uch of their time=20

lounging at their shop-doors with slippers down at heel, in smoking cigaret=
tes, in drinking arrack,=20

and in speculating when their native country shall be=20


_
that they draw but a few inches of water. Upon the cross pieces connecting =
them is built a light=20

platform, surrounded by a wash-board. This is deck and below-decks all in o=
ne, as it affords the=20

only accommodation for the crew that a catamaran can furnish: so you see th=
at it is not a very=20

comfortable cruising boat either, though, to be sure, a small tent might be=
 carried, and raised over=20

the deck when the boat came to anchor for the night.  The speed attained by=
 catamarans, with the=20

wind free, is marvellous, and with a good breeze many of them can beat the =
fastest steamers. A=20

catamaran has such a breadth of beam, on account of the distance between th=
e hulls, that it is=20

almost impossible for it to capsize as ordinary boats do, but it sometimes-=
-though very rarely--

turns a somersault, or "pitch poles"; that is, buries its bows in the water=
, and upsets head-

foremost. This happened once to the first catamaran that was sailed in New =
York Bay. She was=20

sailing at a tremendous pace right before the wind, when suddenly she burie=
d her nose deep in=20

the water, and turned over so completely that her mast stuck deep in the mu=
d at the bottom of the=20

bay, which was there very shallow. Her astonished crew, who had never heard=
 of such a=20

performance, were thrown into the water far beyond her.  The catamaran of N=
ew York Bay is=20

merely a modified form of the famous flying proa of the South-sea Islanders=
, who build the fastest=20

sailing craft in the world. The hull of the  To none of these well-recogniz=
ed careers did Maron=20

Mohanna feel himself impelled.  Soon tiring of his shop he went to Egypt, w=
orked on a newspaper,=20

and then became a teacher of Arabic to Europeans; was taken by one of them =
to London, where=20

he passed some years earning a threadbare livelihood by translating Arabic =
documents and=20

writing for the press. When out of work he tramped about the streets to che=
at his hunger, and if in=20

funds frequented music-halls, and lavished his hard-earned money on the hou=
ris who frequent=20

such places, describing them as =E2=80=9Cfine and tall, too fond of drink, =
and perhaps colder in the blood=20

than are the women of the East.=E2=80=9D  Not often did his fortunes permit=
 him such extravagances, and=20

he began to pass his life hanging about the City in the wake of the impossi=
ble gang of small=20

company-promoters, who in the purlieus of the financial world weave shoddy =
Utopias, and are the=20

cause of much vain labour to postmen and some annoyance to the public, but =
who as far as I can=20

see live chiefly upon hope deferred, for their prospectuses seem to be gene=
rally cast into the=20

basket, from which no share list ever has returned.  But in the darkest of =
poor Maron Mohanna=E2=80=99s=20

blackest days, his dreams about the Arab race never forsook him, and he stu=
died much to master=20

all the subtleties of his native tongue, talking with Arabs, Easterns, Pers=
ians, and the like in the=20

lunch-room of the British Museum, where scholars of all nations, blear-eyed=

and down. This straight=20

side is always kept to leeward. From the other side project stout bamboo po=
les, to the outer ends=20

of which is fastened a boat-shaped log of wood. This log, or sandwiches and=
 drink lemonade,=20

whilst wearing out their eyes and lives for pittances which a dock labourer=
 would turn from in=20

disgust.  Much did the shivering Easterns confabulate, much did they talk o=
f grammar, of niceties=20

of diction, much did they dispute,=20
