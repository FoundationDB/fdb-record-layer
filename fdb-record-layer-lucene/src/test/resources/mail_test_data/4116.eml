Royal Academy, was false, superstitious, foolish. Belief in the wisdom of t=
he Ancients was laughed=20

to scorn, perhaps more so even than it is now. The very thought of acceptin=
g as authentic the=20

works and vagaries of "a false Hermes, a false Orpheus, a false Zoroaster,"=
 of false Oracles, false=20

Sibyls, and a thrice false Mesmer and his absurd fluid, was tabooed all alo=
ng the line. Thus all that=20

had its genesis outside the learned and dogmatic precincts of Oxford and Ca=
mbridge,(46) or the=20

Academy of France, was denounced in those days as "unscientific," and "ridi=
culously absurd."=20

This tendency has survived to the present day.  Nothing can be further from=
 the intention of any=20

true Occultist--who stands possessed, by virtue of his higher psychic devel=
opment, of instruments=20

of research far more penetrating in their power than any as yet in the hand=
s of physical=20

experimentalists--than to look unsympathetically on the efforts that are be=
ing made in the area of=20

physical enquiry. The exertions and labours undertaken to solve as many as =
possible of the=20

problems of Nature have always been holy in his sight. The spirit in which =
Sir Isaac Newton=20

remarked that at the end of all his astronomical work he felt a mere child =
picking up shells beside=20

the Ocean of Knowledge, is one of reverence for the boundlessness of Nature=
 which Occult=20

Philosophy itself cannot eclipse. And it may freely be recognised that the =
attitude of mind which=20

this famous simile describes is one which fairly represents that of the gre=
at majority of _genuine_=20

Scientists in regard to all the phenomena of the physical plane of Nature. =
In dealing with this they=20

are often caution and moderation itself. They observe facts with a patience=
 that cannot be=20

surpassed. They are slow to cast these into theories, with a prudence that =
cannot be too highly=20

commended. And, subject to the limitations under which they observe Nature,=
 they are beautifully=20

accurate in the record of their observations. Moreover, it may be conceded =
further that modern=20

Scientists are exceedingly careful not to affirm negations. They may say it=
 is immensely=20

improbable that any discovery will ever conflict with such or such a theory=
, now supported by such=20

and such an aggregation of recorded facts. But even in reference to the bro=
adest generalizations--

which pass into a dogmatic form only in brief popular text books of scienti=
fic knowledge--the tone=20

of "Science" itself, if that abstraction may be held to be embodied in the =
persons of its most=20

distinguished representatives, is one of reserve and often of modesty.  Far=
, therefore, from being=20

disposed to scoff at the errors into which the limitations of their methods=
 may betray men of=20

Science, the true Occultist will rather appreciate the pathos of a situatio=
n in which great industry=20

and thirst for truth are condemned to disappointment, and often to confusio=
n.  That which is to be=20

deplored, however, in respect to Modern Science, is in itself an evil manif=
estation of the excessive=20

caution which in its most favourable aspect protects Science from over-hast=
y conclusions: namely,=20

the tardiness of Scientists to recognise that other instruments of research=
 may be applicable to the=20

mysteries of Nature besides those of the physical plane, and that it may co=
nsequently be=20

impossible to appreciate the phenomena of any one plane correctly without o=
bserving them as=20

well from the points of view afforded by others. In so far then as they wil=
fully shut their eyes to=20

evidence which ought to have shown them clearly that Nature is more complex=
 than physical=20

phenomena alone would suggest, that there are means by which the faculties =
of human=20

perception can pass sometimes from one plane to the other, and that their e=
nergy is being=20

misdirected while they turn it exclusively on the minutiae of physical stru=
cture or force, they are=20

less entitled to sympathy than to blame.  One feels dwarfed and humbled in =
reading what M.=20

Renan, that learned modern "destroyer" of every religious belief, past, pre=
sent and future, has to=20



say of poor humanity and its powers of discernment. He believes       Manki=
nd has but a very=20

narrow mind; and the number of men capable     of seizing acutely (_finemen=
t_) the true analogy=20

of things, is     quite imperceptible.(47)   Upon comparing, however, this =
statement with another=20

opinion expressed by the same author, namely, that:       The mind of the c=
ritic should yield to=20

facts, hands and feet     bound, to be dragged by them wherever they may le=
ad him,(48)   one=20

feels relieved. When, moreover, these two philosophical statements are stre=
ngthened by a third=20

enunciation of the famous Academician, which declares that:       _Tout par=
ti pris a priori, doit etre=20

banni de la science_,(49)   there remains little to fear. Unfortunately M. =
Renan is the first to break=20

this golden rule.  The evidence of Herodotus--called, sarcastically no doub=
t, the "Father of=20

History," since in every question upon which Modern Thought disagrees with =
him, his testimony=20

goes for nought--the sober and earnest assurances in the philosophical narr=
atives of Plato and=20

Thucydides, Polybius, and Plutarch, and even certain statements of Aristotl=
e himself, are=20

invariably laid aside whenever they are involved in what modern criticism i=
s pleased to regard as a=20

myth. It is some time since Strauss proclaimed that:       The presence of =
a supernatural element=20

or miracle in a narrative     is an infallible sign of the presence in it o=
f a myth;   and such is the=20

canon of criticism tacitly adopted by every modern critic. But what is a my=
th--{~GREEK SMALL=20

LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL=20

LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL=20

SIGMA~}--to begin with? Are we not told distinctly by ancient writers that =
the word means=20

tradition? Was not the Latin term _fabula_, a fable, synonymous with someth=
ing told, as having=20

happened in pre-historic times, and not necessarily an invention. With such=
 autocrats of criticism=20

and despotic rulers as are most of the French, English, and German Oriental=
ists, there may, then,=20

be no end of historical, geographical, ethnological and philological surpri=
ses in store for the=20

century to come. Travesties in Philosophy have become so common of late, th=
at the public can be=20

startled by nothing in this direction. It has already been stated by one le=
arned speculator that=20

Homer was simply "a mythical personification of the epopee"(50); by another=
, that Hippocrates,=20

son of Esculapius "could only be a chimera"; that the Asclepiades, their se=
ven hundred years of=20

duration notwithstanding, might after all prove simply a "fiction"; that "t=
he city of Troy (Dr.=20

Schliemann to the contrary) existed only on the maps," etc. Why should not =
the world be invited=20

after this to regard every hitherto historical character of days of old as =
a myth? Were not=20

Alexander the Great needed by Philology as a sledge-hammer wherewith to bre=
ak the heads of=20

Brahmanical chronological pretensions, he would have become long ago simply=
 "a symbol for=20

annexation," or "a genius of conquest," as has been already suggested by so=
me French writer.=20

Blank denial is the only refuge left to the critics. It is the most secure =
asylum for some time to=20

come in which to shelter the last of the sceptics. For one who denies uncon=
ditionally, the trouble of=20

arguing is unnecessary, and he also thus avoids what is worse, having to yi=
eld occasionally a=20

point or two before the irrefutable arguments and facts of his opponent. Cr=
euzer, the greatest of all=20

the modern Symbologists, the most learned among the masses of erudite Germa=
n Mythologists,=20

must have envied the placid self-confidence of certain sceptics, when he fo=
und himself forced in a=20

moment of desperate perplexity to admit that:       We are compelled to ret=
urn to the theories of=20

trolls and genii, as     they were understood by the ancients; [it is a doc=
trine] without     which it=20

becomes absolutely impossible to explain to oneself     anything with regar=
d to the Mysteries(51)=20



of the Ancients, which Mysteries are undeniable.  Roman Catholics, who are =
guilty of precisely the=20

same worship, and to the very letter--having borrowed it from the later Cha=
ldaeans, the Lebanon=20

Nabathaeans, and the baptized Sabaeans,(52) and not from the learned Astron=
omers and Initiates=20

of the days of old--would now, by anathematizing it, hide the source from w=
hich it came. Theology=20

and Churchianism would fain trouble the clear fountain that fed them from t=
he first, to prevent=20

posterity from looking into it, and thus seeing their original prototype. T=
he Occultists, however,=20

believe the time has come to give everyone his due. As to our other opponen=
ts--the modern=20

sceptic and the Epicurean, the cynic and the Sadducee--they may find an ans=
wer to their denials=20

in our earlier volumes. As to many unjust aspersions on the ancient doctrin=
es, the reason for them=20

is given in these words in _Isis Unveiled_:       The thought of the presen=
t-day commentator and=20

critic as to the     ancient learning, is limited to and runs round the exo=
terism of     the temples; his=20

insight is either unwilling or unable to     penetrate into the solemn adyt=
a of old, where the=20

hierophant     instructed the neophyte to regard the public worship in its =
true     light. No ancient=20

sage would have taught that man is the king of     creation, and that the s=
tarry heaven and our=20

mother earth were     created for his sake.(53)   When we find such works a=
s _Phallicism_(54)=20

appearing in our day in print, it is easy to see that the day for concealme=
nt and travesty has=20

passed away. Science, in Philology, Symbolism and Comparative Religion, has=
 progressed too far=20

to make wholesale denials any longer, and the Church is too wise and cautio=
us not to be now=20

making the best of the situation. Meanwhile, the "rhombs of Hecate" and the=
 "wheels of=20

Lucifer,"(55) daily exhumed on the sites of Babylonia, can no longer be use=
d as clear evidence of=20

a Satan-worship, since the same symbols are shown in the ritual of the Lati=
n Church. The latter is=20

too learned to be ignorant of the fact that even the later Chaldaeans, who =
had gradually fallen into=20

dualism, reducing all things to two primal Principles, never worshipped Sat=
an or idols, any more=20

than did the Zoroastrians, who now lie under the same accusation, but that =
their Religion was as=20

highly philosophical as any; their dual and exoteric Theosophy became the h=
eirloom of the Jews,=20

who, in their turn, were forced to share it with the Christians. Parsis are=
 to this day charged with=20

Heliolatry, and yet in the Chaldaean Oracles, under the "Magical and Philos=
ophical Precepts of=20

Zoroaster" one finds the following:       Direct not thy mind to the vast m=
easures of the earth;     For=20

the plant of truth is not upon ground.     Nor measure the measures of the =
sun, collecting rules,=20

For he is carried by the eternal will of the Father, not for your          =
       sake.     Dismiss the=20

impetuous course of the moon; for she runs always by                 work o=
f necessity.     The=20

progression of the stars was not generated for your sake.   There was a vas=
t difference between=20

the true worship taught to those who showed themselves worthy, and the stat=
e religions. The=20

Magians are accused of all kinds of superstition, but this is what the same=
 Chaldaean Oracle says:=20

The wide aerial flight of birds is not true,     Nor the dissections of the=
 entrails of victims; they are=20

all mere                 toys,     The basis of mercenary fraud; flee from =
these     If you would open the=20

sacred paradise of piety,     Where virtue, wisdom, and equity are assemble=
d.(56)   As we say in=20

our former work:       Surely it is not those who warn people against "merc=
enary fraud"     who can=20

be accused of it; and if they accomplished acts which seem     miraculous, =
who can with fairness=20

presume to deny that it was done     merely because they possessed a knowle=
dge of natural=20

philosophy     and psychological science to a degree unknown to our schools=
?(57)   The above=20

quoted stanzas are a rather strange teaching to come from those who are uni=
versally believed to=20



have worshipped the sun, and moon, and the starry hosts, as Gods. The subli=
me profundity of the=20

Magian precepts being beyond the reach of modern materialistic thought, the=
 Chaldaean=20

Philosophers are accused of Sabaeanism and Sun-worship, which was the relig=
ion only of the=20

uneducated masses.      SECTION III. THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC.   Things of late =
have changed,=20

true enough. The field of investigation has widened; old religions are a li=
ttle better understood; and=20

since that miserable day when the Committee of the French Academy, headed b=
y Benjamin=20

Franklin, investigated Mesmer's phenomena only to proclaim them charlatanry=
 and clever knavery,=20

both heathen Philosophy and Mesmerism have acquired certain rights and priv=
ileges, and are now=20

viewed from quite a different standpoint. Is full justice rendered them, ho=
wever, and are they any=20

better appreciated? We are afraid not. Human nature is the same now, as whe=
n Pope said of the=20

force of prejudice that:       The difference is as great between     The o=
ptics seeing, as the objects=20

seen.     All manners take a tincture from our own,     Or some discolour'd=
 through our passions=20

shown,     Or fancy's beam enlarges, multiplies,     Contracts, inverts, an=
d gives ten thousand=20

dyes.   Thus in the first decades of our century Hermetic Philosophy was re=
garded by both=20

Churchmen and men of Science from two quite opposite points of view. The fo=
rmer called it sinful=20

and devilish; the latter denied point- blank its authenticity, notwithstand=
ing the evidence brought=20

forward by the most erudite men of every age, including our own. The learne=
d Father Kircher, for=20

instance, was not even noticed; and his assertion that all the fragments kn=
own under titles of=20

works by Mercury Trismegistus, Berosus, Pherecydes of Syros, etc., were rol=
ls that had escaped=20

the fire which devoured 100,000 volumes of the great Alexandrian Library--w=
as simply laughed at.=20

Nevertheless the educated classes of Europe knew then, as they do now, that=
 the famous=20

Alexandrian Library, the "marvel of the ages," was founded by Ptolemy Phila=
delphus; that=20

numbers of its MSS. had been carefully copied from hieratic texts and the o=
ldest parchments,=20

Chaldaean, Phoenician, Persian, etc.; and that these transliterations and c=
opies amounted, in their=20

turn, to another 100,000 rolls, as Josephus and Strabo assert.  There is al=
so the additional=20

evidence of Clemens Alexandrinus, that ought to be credited to some extent.=
(58) Clemens testified=20

to the existence of an additional 30,000 volumes of the Books of Thoth, pla=
ced in the library of the=20

Tomb of Osymandias, over the entrance of which were inscribed the words, "A=
 Cure for the Soul."=20

Since then, as all know, entire texts of the "apocryphal" works of the "fal=
se" Pymander, and the no=20

less "false" Asclepias, have been found by Champollion in the most ancient =
monuments of=20

Egypt.(59) As said in _Isis Unveiled_:       After having devoted their who=
le lives to the study of the=20

records     of the old Egyptian wisdom, both Champollion-Figeac and     Cha=
mpollion Junior=20

publicly declared, notwithstanding many biassed     judgments hazarded by c=
ertain hasty and=20

unwise critics, that the     _Books of Hermes_ "truly contain a mass of Egy=
ptian traditions     which=20

are constantly corroborated by the most authentic records     and monuments=
 of Egypt of the=20

hoariest antiquity."(60)   The merit of Champollion as an Egyptologist none=
 will question, and if he=20

declare that everything demonstrates the accuracy of the writings of the my=
sterious Hermes=20

Trismegistus, and if the assertion that their antiquity runs back into the =
night of time be=20

corroborated by him in minutest details, then indeed criticism ought to be =
fully satisfied. Says=20

Champollion:       These inscriptions are only the faithful echo and expres=
sion of     the most=20

ancient verities.   Since these words were written, some of the "apocryphal=
" verses by the=20

"mythical" Orpheus have also been found copied word for word, in hieroglyph=
ics, in certain=20



inscriptions of the Fourth Dynasty, addressed to various Deities. Finally, =
Creuzer discovered and=20

immediately pointed out the very significant fact that numerous passages fo=
und in Homer and=20

Hesiod were undeniably borrowed by the two great poets from the Orphic Hymn=
s, thus proving the=20

latter to be far older than the _Iliad_ or the _Odyssey_.  And so gradually=
 the ancient claims come=20

to be vindicated, and modern criticism has to submit to evidence. Many are =
now the writers who=20

confess that such a type of literature as the Hermetic works of Egypt can n=
ever be dated too far=20

back into the prehistoric ages. The texts of many of these ancient works, t=
hat of Enoch included,=20

so loudly proclaimed "apocryphal" at the beginning of this century, are now=
 discovered and=20

recognised in the most secret and sacred sanctuaries of Chaldaea, India, Ph=
oenicia, Egypt and=20

Central Asia. But even such proofs have failed to convince the bulk of our =
Materialists. The reason=20

for this is very simple and evident. All these texts--held in universal ven=
eration in Antiquity, found=20

in the secret libraries of all the great temples, studied (if not always ma=
stered) by the greatest=20

statesmen, classical writers, philosophers, kings and laymen, as much as by=
 renowned Sages--

what were they? Treatises on Magic and Occultism, pure and simple; the now =
derided and=20

tabooed Theosophy--hence the ostracism.  Were people, then, so simple and c=
redulous in the=20

days of Pythagoras and Plato? Were the millions of Babylonia and Egypt, of =
India and Greece,=20

with their great Sages to lead them, all fools, that during those periods o=
f great learning and=20

civilization which preceded the year _one_ of our era--the latter giving bi=
rth but to the intellectual=20

darkness of mediaeval fanaticism--so many otherwise great men should have d=
evoted their lives=20

to a mere illusion, a superstition called Magic? It would seem so, had one =
to remain content with=20

the word and conclusions of modern Philosophy.  Every Art and Science, howe=
ver, whatever its=20

intrinsic merit, has had its discoverer and practitioner, and subsequently =
its proficients to teach it.=20

What is the origin of the Occult Sciences, or Magic? Who were its professor=
s, and what is known=20

of them, whether in history or legend? Clemens Alexandrinus, one of the mos=
t intelligent and=20

learned of the early Christian Fathers, answers this question in his _Strom=
ateis_. That ex- pupil of=20

the Neoplatonic School argues:       If there is instruction, you must seek=
 for the master.(61)   And=20

so he shows Cleanthes taught by Zeno, Theophrastus by Aristotle, Metrodorus=
 by Epicurus, Plato=20

by Socrates, etc. And he adds that when he had looked further back to Pytha=
goras, Pherecydes,=20

and Thales, he had still to search for their masters. The same for the Egyp=
tians, the Indians, the=20

Babylonians, and the Magi themselves. He would not cease questioning, he sa=
ys, to learn who it=20

was they all had for their masters. And when he (Clemens) had traced down t=
he enquiry to the=20

very cradle of mankind, to the first generation of men, he would reiterate =
once more his=20

questioning, and ask, "Who is their teacher?" Surely, he argues, their mast=
er could be "no one of=20

men." And even when we should have reached as high as the Angels, the same =
query would have=20

to be offered to them: "Who were their (meaning the 'divine' and the 'falle=
n' Angels) masters?"=20

The aim of the good father's long argument is of course to discover two dis=
tinct masters, one the=20

preceptor of biblical patriarchs, the other the teacher of the Gentiles. Bu=
t the students of the Secret=20

Doctrine need go to no such trouble. Their professors are well aware who we=
re the Masters of=20

their predecessors in Occult Sciences and Wisdom.  The two professors are f=
inally traced out by=20

Clemens, and are, as was to be expected, God, and his eternal and everlasti=
ng enemy and=20

opponent, the Devil; the subject of Clemens' enquiry relating to the _dual_=
 aspect of Hermetic=20

Philosophy, as cause and effect. Admitting the moral beauty of the virtues =
preached in every=20



Occult work with which he was acquainted, Clemens desires to know the cause=
 of the apparent=20

contradiction between the doctrine and the practice, good and evil Magic, a=
nd he comes to the=20

conclusion that Magic has two origins--divine and diabolical. He perceives =
its bifurcation into two=20

channels, hence his deduction and inference.  We perceive it too, without, =
however, necessarily=20

designating such bifurcation diabolical, for we judge the "left-hand path" =
as it issued from the=20

hands of its founder. Otherwise, judging also by the effects of Clemens' ow=
n religion and the walk=20

in life of certain of its professors, since the death of their Master, the =
Occultists would have a right=20

to come to somewhat the same conclusion as Clemens. They would have a right=
 to say that while=20

Christ, the Master of all _true_ Christians, was in every way godly, those =
who resorted to the=20

horrors of the Inquisition, to the extermination and torture of heretics, J=
ews and Alchemists, the=20

Protestant Calvin who burnt Servetus, and his persecuting Protestant succes=
sors, down to the=20

whippers and burners of witches in America, must have had for _their_ Maste=
r, the Devil. But=20

Occultists, not believing in the Devil, are precluded from retaliating in t=
his way.  Clemens'=20

testimony, however, is valuable in so far as it shows (1) the enormous numb=
er of works on Occult=20

Sciences in his day; and (2) the extraordinary powers acquired through thos=
e Sciences by certain=20

men.  He devotes, for instance, the whole of the sixth book of his _Stromat=
eis_ to this research for=20

the first two "Masters" of the true and the false Philosophy respectively, =
both preserved, as he=20

says, in the Egyptian sanctuaries. Very pertinently too, he apostrophises t=
he Greeks, asking them=20

why they should not accept the "miracles" of Moses as such, since they clai=
m the very same=20

privileges for their own Philosophers, and he gives a number of instances. =
It is, as he says,=20

AEachus obtaining through his Occult powers a marvellous rain; it is Arista=
eus causing the winds=20

to blow; Empedocles quieting the gale, and forcing it to cease, etc.(62)  T=
he books of Mercurius=20

Trismegistus most attracted his attention.(63) He is also warm in his prais=
e of Hystaspes (or=20

Gushtasp), of the Sibylline books, and even of the right Astrology.  There =
have been in all ages=20

use and abuse of Magic, as there are use and abuse of Mesmerism or Hypnotis=
m in our own. The=20

ancient world had its Apollonii and its Pherecydae, and intellectual people=
 could discriminate then,=20

as they can now. While no classical or pagan writer has ever found one word=
 of blame for=20

Apollonius of Tyana, for instance, it is not so with regard to Pherecydes. =
Hesychius of Miletia,=20

over which it passed three times. Bidault and Boulard reported it a suicide=
. The results of the post=20

at the marks rather=20

resembled those of strangulation than hanging; the ecchymoses were more lik=
e those produced=20

by the hand over the mouth. The marks on the face supposed to have been mad=

soothsayer than a physician," and Diogenes Laertius gives a vast number of =
stories relating to his=20

predictions. One day Pherecydes prophesies the shipwreck of a vessel hundre=
ds of miles away=20

from him; another time he predicts the capture of the Lacedaemonians by the=
 Arcadians; finally,=20

he foresees his own wretched end.(64)  Bearing in mind the objections that =
will be made to the=20

teachings of the Esoteric Doctrine as herein propounded, the writer is forc=
ed to meet some of=20

them beforehand.  Such imputations as those brought by Clemens against the =
"heathen" Adepts,=20

only prove the presence of clairvoyant powers and prevision in every age, b=
ut are no evidence in=20

favour of a Devil. They are, therefore, of no value except to the Christian=
s, for whom Satan is one=20

of the chief pillars of the faith. Baronius and De Mirville, for instance, =
find an unanswerable proof of=20

Demonology in the belief in the co-eternity of Matter with Spirit!  De Mirv=
ille writes that Pherecydes=20

Postulates in principle the primordiality of Zeus or Ether, and     then, o=
n the same plane, a=20

principle, coeternal and coaective,     which he calls the fifth element, o=
r Ogenos.(65)   He then=20

points out that the meaning of Ogenos is given as that which shuts up, whic=

that is Hades, "or in a word, hell."  The synonyms are known to every schoo=

Occultist will of course deny it and only smile at its folly. And now we co=
me to the theological=20

conclusion.  The _resume_ of the views of the Latin Church--as given by aut=
hors of the same=20

character as the Marquis de Mirville--amounts to this: that the Hermetic Bo=
oks, their wisdom--fully=20

_
That immediately after the Flood Cham and his descendants had     propagate=
d anew the ancient=20

teachings of the Cainites and of the     submerged Race.(66)   This proves,=
 at any rate, that Magic,=20

or Sorcery as he calls it, is an antediluvian Art, and thus one point is ga=
ined. For, as he says:--=20

The evidence of Berosius makes Ham identical with the first     Zoroaster, =
founder of Bactria, the=20

first author of all the magic     arts of Babylonia, the _Chemesenua_ or Ch=
am,(67) the=20

_infamous_(68) of the faithful Noachians, finally the object of     adorati=
on for Egypt, which having=20

received its name {~GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER=20

ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL=
=20

LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, whence     chemistry, =
built in=20

his honour a town called _Choemnis_, or the     "city of fire."(69) Ham ado=
red it, it is said, whence=20

the name     _Chammaim_ given to the pyramids; which in their turn have bee=
n     vulgarised into=20

our modern noun "chimney."(70)   This statement is entirely wrong. Egypt wa=
s the cradle of=20

Chemistry and its birth-place--this is pretty well known by this time. Only=
 Kenrick and others show=20

the root of the word to be _chemi_ or _chem_, which is not _Cham_ or Ham, b=
ut _Khem_, the=20

Egyptian phallic God of the Mysteries.  But this is not all. De Mirville is=
 bent upon finding a satanic=20

origin even for the now innocent Tarot.  He goes on to say:       As to the=
 means for the=20

propagation of this evil Magic, tradition     points it out, in certain run=
ic characters traced on=20

metallic     plates [or leaves, _des lames_] which have escaped destruction=
 by     the Deluge.(71)=20

This might have been regarded as legendary, had     not subsequent discover=
ies shown it far from=20

being so. Plates were     found covered with curious and utterly undecipher=
able characters,=20

characters of undeniable antiquity, to which the Chamites     [Sorcerers, w=
ith the author] attribute=20

the origin of their     marvellous and terrible powers.(72)   The pious aut=
hor may, meanwhile, be=20

left to his own orthodox beliefs. He, at any rate, seems quite sincere in h=
is views. Nevertheless,=20

his able arguments will have to be sapped at their very foundation, for it =
must be shown on=20

mathematical grounds who, or rather what, Cain and Ham really were. De Mirv=
ille is only the=20

faithful son of his Church, interested in keeping Cain in his anthropomorph=
ic character and in his=20

present place in "Holy Writ." The student of Occultism, on the other hand, =
is solely interested in=20

the truth. But the age has to follow the natural course of its evolution.  =
    SECTION IV. THE=20

SECRESY OF INITIATES.   The false rendering of a number of parables and say=
ings of Jesus is=20

not to be wondered at in the least. From Orpheus, the first initiated Adept=
 of whom history catches=20

a glimpse in the mists of the pre-Christian era, down through Pythagoras, C=
onfucius, Buddha,=20

Jesus, Apollonius of Tyana, to Ammonius Saccas, no Teacher or Initiate has =
ever committed=20

anything to writing for public use. Each and all of them have invariably re=
commended silence and=20

secresy on certain facts and deeds; from Confucius, who refused to explain =
publicly and=20

satisfactorily what he meant by his "Great Extreme," or to give the key to =
the divination by=20

"straws," down to Jesus, who charged his disciples to tell no man that he w=
as Christ(73)=20

(Chrestos), the "man of sorrows" and trials, before his supreme and last In=
itiation, or that he had=20

produced a "miracle" of resurrection.(74) The Apostles had to preserve sile=
nce, so that the left=20

hand should not know what the right hand did; in plainer words, that the da=
ngerous proficients in=20

the Left Hand Science--the terrible enemies of the Right Hand Adepts, espec=
ially before their=20

supreme Initiation--should not profit by the publicity so as to harm both t=
he healer and the patient.=20

And if the above is maintained to be simply an assumption, then what may be=
 the meaning of=20



these awful words:       Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Ki=
ngdom of God;     but unto=20

them that are without all these things are done in     parables; that seein=
g they may see and not=20

perceive; and hearing,     they may hear and not understand; lest at any ti=
me they should be=20

converted and their sins should be forgiven them.(75)   Unless interpreted =
in the sense of the law=20

of silence and Karma, the utter selfishness and uncharitable spirit of this=
 remark are but too=20

evident. These words are directly connected with the terrible dogma of pred=
estination. Will the=20

good and intelligent Christian cast such a slur of cruel selfishness on his=
 Saviour?(76)  The work=20

of propagating such truths in parables was left to the disciples of the hig=
h Initiates. It was their duty=20

to follow the key-note of the Secret Teaching without revealing its mysteri=
es. This is shown in the=20

histories of all the great Adepts. Pythagoras divided his classes into hear=
ers of exoteric and=20

esoteric lectures. The Magians received their instructions and were initiat=
ed in the far hidden=20

caves of Bactria. When Josephus declares that Abraham taught Mathematics he=
 meant by it=20

"Magic," for in the Pythagorean code Mathematics mean Esoteric Science, or =
Gnosis.  Professor=20

Wilder remarks:       The Essenes of Judaea and Carmel made similar distinc=
tions,     dividing their=20

adherents into neophytes, brethren and the     perfect.... Ammonius obligat=
ed his disciples by oath=20

not to     divulge his higher doctrines, except to those who had been     t=
horoughly instructed and=20

exercised [prepared for initiation].(77)   One of the most powerful reasons=
 for the necessity of strict=20

secresy is given by Jesus Himself, if one may credit Matthew. For there the=
 Master is made to say=20

plainly:       Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye y=
our     pearls before swine;=20

lest they trample them under their feet, and     turn again and rend you.(7=
8)   Profoundly true and=20

Even Maimonides recommends silence with regard to the true meaning of the _=
Bible_ texts. This=20

injunction destroys the usual affirmation that "Holy Writ" is the only book=
 in the world whose divine=20

oracles contain plain unvarnished truth. It may be so for the learned Kabal=
ists; it is certainly quite=20

the reverse with regard to Christians. For this is what the learned Hebrew =
Philosopher says:=20

Whoever shall find out the true sense of the Book of _Genesis_     ought to=
 take care not to=20

divulge it. This is a maxim that all our     sages repeat to us, and above =
all respecting the work of=20

the six     days. If a person should discover the _true_ meaning of it by  =
   himself, or by the aid of=20

another, then he ought to be silent, or     if he speaks he ought to speak =
of it obscurely, in an=20

enigmatical     manner, as I do myself, leaving the rest to be guessed by t=
hose     who can=20

understand me.   The Symbology and Esoterism of the _Old Testament_ being t=
hus confessed by=20

one of the greatest Jewish Philosophers, it is only natural to find Christi=
an Fathers making the=20

same confession with regard to the _New Testament_, and the _Bible_ in gene=
ral. Thus we find=20

Clemens Alexandrinus and Origen admitting it as plainly as words can do it.=

The doctrines there taught contained in them _the end of all     instructio=
ns as they were taken=20

from Moses and the prophets_,   a slight perversion of facts pardonable in =
the good Father. The=20

words admit, after all, that the Mysteries of the Jews were identical with =
those of the Pagan=20

Greeks, who took them from the Egyptians, who borrowed them, in their turn,=
 from the=20

Chaldaeans, who got them from the Aryans, the Atlanteans and so on--far bey=
ond the days of that=20

Race. The secret meaning of the Gospel is again openly confessed by Clemens=
 when he says=20

that the Mysteries of the Faith are not to be divulged to all.       But si=
nce this tradition is not=20

published alone for him who     perceives the magnificence of the word; it =
is requisite,     therefore,=20

to hide in a Mystery the wisdom spoken, which the Son     of God taught.(80=
)   Not less explicit is=20

Origen with regard to the _Bible_ and its symbolical fables. He exclaims:  =
     If we hold to the=20

letter, and must understand what stands written     in the law after the ma=
nner of the Jews and=20

common people, then I     should blush to confess aloud that it is God who =
has given these=20

laws: then the laws of men appear more excellent and     reasonable.(81)   =
And well he might have=20

"blushed," the sincere and honest Father of early Christianity in its days =
of relative purity. But the=20

Christians of this highly literary and civilised age of ours do not blush a=
t all; they swallow, on the=20

contrary, the "light" before the formation of the sun, the Garden of Eden, =
Jonah's whale and all,=20

notwithstanding that the same Origen asks in a very natural fit of indignat=
ion:       What man of=20

sense will agree with the statement that the first,     second and third da=
ys in which the _evening_=20

is named and the     _morning_, were without sun, moon, and stars, and the =
first day     without a=20

heaven? What man is found such an idiot as to suppose     that God planted =
trees in Paradise, in=20

Eden, like a husbandman,     etc.? I believe that every man must hold these=
 things for images,=20

under which a hidden sense lies concealed?(82)   Yet millions of "such idio=
ts" are found in our age=20

of enlightenment and not only in the third century. When Paul's unequivocal=
 statement in=20

_Galatians_, iv. 22-25, that the story of Abraham and his two sons is all "=
an allegory," and that=20

"Agar is Mount Sinai" is added to this, then little blame, indeed, can be a=
ttached to either Christian=20

or Heathen who declines to accept the _Bible_ in any other light than that =
of a very ingenious=20

allegory.  Rabbi Simeon Ben-"Jochai," the compiler of the _Zohar_, never im=
parted the most=20

important points of his doctrine otherwise than orally, and to a very limit=
ed number of disciples.=20

Therefore, without the final initiation into the _Mercavah_, the study of t=
he _Kabalah_ will be ever=20

incomplete, and the _Mercavah_ can be taught only "in darkness, in a desert=
ed place, and after=20

many and terrific trials." Since the death of that great Jewish Initiate th=
is hidden doctrine has=20

remained, for the outside world, an inviolate secret.       Among the vener=
able sect of the Tanaim,=20

or rather the Tananim, the     wise men, there were those who taught the se=
crets practically and=20

initiated some disciples into the grand and final Mystery. But the     _Mis=
hna Hagiga_, 2nd Section,=20

say that the table of contents of     the _Mercaba_ "must only be delivered=
 to wise old ones." The=20

_Gemara_ is still more dogmatic. "The more important secrets of     the Mys=
teries were not even=20

revealed to all priests. Alone the     initiates had them divulged." And so=
 we find the same great=20

secresy prevalent in every ancient religion.(83)   What says the _Kabalah_ =
itself? Its great Rabbis=20

actually threaten him who accepts their sayings _verbatim_. We read in the =
_Zohar_:       Woe to=20

the man who sees in the Thorah, _i.e._, Law, only simple     recitals and o=
rdinary words! Because=20

if in truth it only contained     these, we would even to-day be able to co=
mpose a Thorah much=20

more     worthy of admiration. For if we find only the simple words, we    =
 would only have to=20



address ourselves to the legislators of the     earth,(84) to those in whom=
 we most frequently meet=20

with the most     grandeur. It would be sufficient to imitate them, and mak=
e a     Thorah after their=20

words and example. But it is not so; each word     of the Thorah contains a=
n elevated meaning and=20

a sublime     mystery.... The recitals of the Thorah are the vestments of t=
he     Thorah. Woe to him=20

who takes this garment for the Thorah     itself.... The simple take notice=
 only of the garments or=20

recitals     of the Thorah, they know no other thing, they see not that whi=
ch     is concealed under=20

the vestment. The more instructed men do not     pay attention to the vestm=
ent, but to the body=20

which it     envelops.(85)   Ammonius Saccas taught that the Secret Doctrin=
e of the Wisdom-

Religion was found complete in the _Books of Thoth_ (Hermes), from which bo=
th Pythagoras and=20

Plato derived their knowledge and much of their Philosophy; and these Books=
 were declared by=20

him to be "identical with the teachings of the Sages of the remote East." P=
rofessor A. Wilder=20

remarks:       As the name Thoth means a college or assembly, it is not    =
 altogether improbable=20

that the books were so named as being the     collected oracles and doctrin=
es of the sacerdotal=20

fraternity of     Memphis. Rabbi Wise has suggested the same hypothesis in =
relation     to the=20

divine utterances recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures.(86)   This is very pro=
bable. Only the "divine=20

utterances" have never been, so far, understood by the profane. Philo Judae=
us, a non-initiate,=20

attempted to give their secret meaning and--failed.  But _Books of Thoth_ o=
r _Bible_, _Vedas_ or=20

_Kabalah_, all enjoin the same secresy as to certain mysteries of nature sy=
mbolised in them.=20

"Woe be to him who divulges _unlawfully_ the words whispered into the ear o=
f Manushi by the=20

_First Initiator_." Who that "Initiator" was is made plain in the _Book of =
Enoch_:       From them=20

[the Angels] I heard all things, and understood what I     saw; that which =
will not take place in this=20

generation [Race], but     in a generation which is to succeed at a distant=
 period [the 6th     and 7th=20

Races] on account of the elect [the Initiates].(87)   Again, it is said wit=
h regard to the judgment of=20

those who, when they have learned "every secret of the angels," reveal them=
, that:       They have=20

discovered secrets, and _they are_ those who have been     judged; but not =
thou, my son [Noah]=20

... thou art pure and good and     _free_ from the reproach of _discovering=
_ [revealing] secrets.(88)=20

But there are those in our century, who, having "discovered secrets" unaide=
d and owing to their=20

own learning and acuteness only, and who being, nevertheless, honest and st=
raightforward men,=20

undismayed by threats or warning since they have never pledged themselves t=
o secresy, feel=20

quite startled at such revelations. One of these is the learned author and =
discoverer of one "Key to=20

the Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery." As he says, there are "some strange features =
connected with the=20

promulgation and condition" of the _Bible_.       Those who compiled this B=
ook were men as we=20

are. They knew, saw,     handled and realized, through the key measure,(89)=
 the _law_ of     the=20

living, ever-active God.(90) They needed no faith that He was,     that He =
worked, planned, and=20

accomplished, as a mighty mechanic     and architect.(91) What was it, then=

se to the act and=20

condition of preventing access of air in other ways than by pressure on the=
 neck, as by pressure=20

on the chest, by obstruction at the mouth or nose, by obstruction in the ai=
r-passages or on them=20

from neighboring organs, by irrespirable gases, etc.  This article will con=
sider all of these except=20

drowning and irrespirable gases, which are treated of elsewhere by other wr=
iters.  =3DSmothering=3D is=20

generally understood to mean the act and effect of stopping the mouth and n=
ose.   CAUSES.=20

=3DExternal Causes.=3D=E2=80=94OVERLAYING is a frequent cause of suffocatio=
n in infants, which in such=20

cases have usually occupied the same bed with one or both parents. In some =
cases the parents=20

have been drunk or otherwise unable to prevent the injury, and the infant m=
ay also be partly=20

stupefied with the alcohol derived from its mother=E2=80=99s milk. Infants =
are also sometimes overlaid by=20

domestic animals. Again, they have been suffocated by being pressed too clo=
sely to the mother=E2=80=99s=20

breast, or by covering with bedclothes, shawls, etc. Noble[883] attributes =
some cases of asphyxia=20

in the new-born to an=C3=A6mia of the brain from pressure on the skull by f=
orceps, etc., and=20

recommends as treatment for this condition hanging the child head downward,=
 so that the blood=20

may gravitate to the brain (Cases 12 and 30).  Infants are sometimes smothe=
red for mercenary=20

purposes.  Persons have been suffocated by the pressure of a crowd. Pressur=
e on the chest=20

combined with forcible closure of the mouth and nose was the method of Burk=
e and Williams, in=20

the notorious _burking_ murders (Case 58). The close application of a hand,=
 cloth, or plaster over=20

nose and mouth is of itself sufficient to cause suffocation, especially in =
children and feeble=20

persons. Pressure on the abdomen crowds up the diaphragm and interferes wit=
h breathing. It is=20

very likely that no external mark will be found in cases of pressure on the=
 chest and abdomen, but=20

the lungs will be marbled and emphysematous.  Taking plaster casts of the f=
ace and neck without=20

inserting tubes in the nostrils has caused death in some cases. Suffocation=
 often follows the falling=20

of walls, houses, banks of earth, piles of coal or corn or wheat. One may f=
all into and be imbedded=20

in some mobile substance as coal, wheat, corn, quicksand, or nightsoil, and=
 be suffocated. Infants=20

have been destroyed[884] by burying them in manure, ashes, bran, etc. In th=
ese cases there is not=20

only the entrance of the foreign body into the air-passages, but the pressu=
re of the mass against=20

the chest and abdomen.  =3DInternal Causes.=3D=E2=80=94The air-passages may=
 be closed up by foreign=20

bodies within them, or within adjoining organs, especially the =C5=93sophag=
us. A great variety of=20

substances in one of these two ways has caused suffocation: mud, cotton, ra=
gs, corn, meat,=20

beans, pepper, potato skins, the fang of a tooth, artificial teeth, buckles=
, shells, flint, buttons,=20

screws, crusts of bread, bones, fruit, stones, heads of grass, coins, slate=
 pencils, nuts, nut-shells,=20

shot, penholders, worms, fish, etc. (see Cases 6 and 55). Taylor[885] state=
s that there were=20

eighty-one deaths in one year in England and Wales from food in the air-pas=
sages.  Should an=20



inspiration occur in the act of vomiting, the vomitus may pass into the air=
-passages; a similar=20

accident may occur in a person who attempts to swallow and speak at the sam=
e time. Infants have=20

been suffocated by inspiring vomited milk. Fitz[886] states that food may p=
ass from the digestive=20

tube to the air-passages after death.  A case of suffocation in an infant b=
y retraction of the base of=20

the tongue is recorded. It has been stated that negroes have committed suic=
ide by doubling back=20

the tongue into the throat, or, as it is called, swallowing the tongue.[887=
] In giving an=C3=A6sthetics, the=20

subject being supine, and the head and neck somewhat flexed, the tongue, ep=
iglottis, and soft=20

palate may fall backward and suffocation may follow. Howard[888] states tha=
t pulling the tongue=20

forward under such circumstances may reopen the pharynx, but will not lift =
the epiglottis. The=20

thorax should be raised and head and neck extended backward. He believes th=
at in giving=20

an=C3=A6sthetics the head should be lower than the shoulders. In order to a=
void vomiting no food=20

should be taken for some hours before the an=C3=A6sthetic.  Cases are recor=
ded of artificial teeth=20

having fallen from the mouth into the air-passages during an=C3=A6sthesia a=
nd sleep, and in epileptic=20

and puerperal convulsions. It would appear advisable that these teeth shoul=
d be worn only while=20

eating (Case 13).  Hemorrhage from the lungs, from rupture of an aneurism o=
r from injury of the=20

mouth or throat, may make its way into the air-passages and cause suffocati=
on. So also the=20

bursting of an abscess of the tonsils or other part near the air-passages (=
Case 7).  =C5=92dema of the=20

glottis from scalding or other irritation of the fauces or glottis, or from=
 disease of the kidneys;=20

tumors pressing on some portion of the air-passages; rapid, profuse bronchi=
al secretion in infants;=20

acute double pleuritic effusion; cheesy glands ulcerating into trachea; sim=
ultaneous =C5=93dema of=20

both lungs=E2=80=94all of these may cause suffocation (Cases 18 and 49). [F=
or cases of enlarged thymus=20

gland, see Hofmann, _op. cit._, pp. 587, 588.]  Paralysis of the muscles of=
 swallowing, from=20

diphtheria or other cause, predisposes to suffocation. Progressive asthenia=
 in which the muscles=20

are exhausted; injury of spinal cord or pneumogastrics; paralysis of muscle=
s of respiration from the=20

use of curare; the spasms of tetanus and strychnia poisoning; the entrance =
of air into the pleural=20

cavities with collapse of the lungs=E2=80=94all tend to cause mechanical su=
ffocation either by pressure or=20

by paralysis (for deaths in epileptics, see Cases 1, 10, 11, 33, and 40).  =
It is not necessary that the=20

air-passages should be _absolutely_ closed to cause suffocation.  The _caus=
e of death_ is more=20

likely to be pure asphyxia, because of the absence of the complicating pres=
sure of the hand or=20

ligature on the vessels and nerves of the=20


_
this knowledge, while first as men of God, and second as Apostles     of Je=
sus the Christ, they=20

doled out a blinding ritual service, and     an empty teaching of _faith_ a=
nd no substance as proof,=20

properly     coming through the exercise of just those senses which the Dei=
ty     has given all men=20

as the essential means of obtaining any right     understanding? _Mystery_ =
and _parable_, and=20

_dark saying_, and     _cloaking_ of the true meanings are the burden of th=
e Testaments,     Old=20

and New. Take it that the narratives of the _Bible_ were     purposed inven=
tions to deceive the=20

ignorant masses, even while     enforcing a most perfect code of moral obli=
gations: How is it=20

possible to justify so great frauds, as part of a Divine economy,     when =
to that economy, the=20

attribute of simple and perfect     _truthfulness_ must, in the nature of t=
hings, be ascribed? What=20

has, or what by possibility ought mystery to have, with the     promulgatio=
n of the truths of=20

God?(92)   Nothing whatever most certainly, if those mysteries had been giv=
en from the first. And=20

so it was with regard to the first, semi-divine, pure and spiritual Races o=
f Humanity. They had the=20

"truths of God," and lived up to them, and their ideals. They preserved the=
m, so long as there was=20

hardly any evil, and hence scarcely a possible abuse of that knowledge and =
those truths. But=20

evolution and the gradual fall into materiality is also one of the "truths"=
 and also one of the laws of=20

"God." And as mankind progressed, and became with every generation more of =
the earth, earthly,=20

the individuality of each temporary Ego began to assert itself. It is perso=
nal selfishness that=20

develops and urges man on to abuse of his knowledge and power. And selfishn=
ess is a human=20

building, whose windows and doors are ever wide open for every kind of iniq=
uity to enter into=20

man's soul. Few were the men during the early adolescence of mankind, and f=
ewer still are they=20

now, who feel disposed to put into practice Pope's forcible declaration tha=
t he would tear out his=20

own heart, if it had no better disposition than to love only himself, and l=
augh at all his neighbours.=20

Hence the necessity of gradually taking away from man the divine knowledge =
and power, which=20

became with every new human cycle more dangerous as a double-edged weapon, =
whose evil side=20

was ever threatening one's neighbour, and whose power for good was lavished=
 freely only upon=20

self. Those few "elect" whose inner natures had remained unaffected by thei=
r outward physical=20

growth, thus became in time the sole guardians of the mysteries revealed, p=
assing the knowledge=20

to those most fit to receive it, and keeping it inaccessible to others. Rej=
ect this explanation from=20

the Secret Teachings, and the very name of Religion will become synonymous =
with deception and=20

fraud.  Yet the masses could not be allowed to remain without some sort of =
moral restraint. Man is=20

ever craving for a "beyond" and cannot live without an ideal of some kind, =
as a beacon and a=20

consolation. At the same time, no average man, even in our age of universal=
 education, could be=20

entrusted with truths too metaphysical, too subtle for his mind to comprehe=
nd, without the danger=20

of an imminent reaction setting in, and faith in Gods and Saints making roo=
m for an unscientific=20

blank Atheism. No real philanthropist, hence no Occultist, would dream for =
a moment of a mankind=20

without one tittle of Religion. Even the modern day Religion in Europe, con=
fined to Sundays, is=20

better than none. But if, as Bunyan put it, "Religion is the best armour th=
at a man can have," it=20

certainly is the "worst cloak"; and it is that "cloak" and false pretence w=
hich the Occultists and the=20

Theosophists fight against. The true ideal Deity, the one living God in Nat=
ure, can never suffer in=20

man's worship if that outward cloak, woven by man's fancy, and thrown upon =
the Deity by the=20

crafty hand of the priest greedy of power and domination, is drawn aside. T=
he hour has struck with=20

the commencement of this century to dethrone the "highest God" of every nat=
ion in favour of One=20



Universal Deity--the God of Immutable Law, not charity; the God of Just Ret=
ribution, not mercy,=20

which is merely an incentive to evil-doing and to a repetition of it. The g=
reatest crime that was ever=20

perpetrated upon mankind was committed on that day when the first priest in=
vented the first prayer=20

with a selfish object in view. A God who may be propitiated by iniquitous p=
rayers to "bless the=20

arms" of the worshipper, and send defeat and death to thousands of his enem=
ies--his brethren; a=20

Deity that can be supposed not to turn a deaf ear to chants of laudation mi=
xed with entreaties for a=20

"fair propitious wind" for self, and as naturally disastrous to the selves =
of other navigators who=20

come from an opposite direction--it is this idea of God that has fostered s=
elfishness in man, and=20

deprived him of his self- reliance. Prayer is an ennobling action when it i=
s an intense feeling, an=20

ardent desire rushing forth from our very heart, for the good of other peop=
le, and when entirely=20

detached from any selfish personal object; the craving for a beyond is natu=
ral and holy in man, but=20

on the condition of sharing that bliss with others. One can understand and =
well appreciate the=20

words of the "heathen" Socrates, who declared in his profound though untaug=
ht wisdom, that:=20

Our prayers should be for blessings on all, in general, for the     Gods kn=
ow best what is good for=20

us.   But official prayer--in favour of a public calamity, or for the benef=
it of one individual=20

irrespective of losses to thousands--is the most ignoble of crimes, besides=
 being an impertinent=20

conceit and a superstition. This is the direct inheritance by spoliation fr=
om the Jehovites--the Jews=20

of the Wilderness and of the Golden Calf.  It is "Jehovah," as will be pres=
ently shown, that=20

suggested the necessity of veiling and screening this substitute for the un=
pronounceable name,=20

and that led to all this "mystery, parables, dark sayings and cloaking." Mo=
ses had, at any rate,=20

initiated his seventy Elders into the hidden truths, and thus the writers o=
f the _Old Testament_=20

stand to a degree justified. Those of the _New Testament_ have failed to do=
 even so much, or so=20

little. They have disfigured the grand central figure of Christ by their do=
gmas, and have led people=20

ever since into millions of errors and the darkest crimes, in His holy name=
.  It is evident that with=20

the exception of Paul and Clement of Alexandria, who had been both initiate=
d into the Mysteries,=20

none of the Fathers knew much of the truth themselves. They were mostly une=
ducated, ignorant=20

people; and if such as Augustine and Lactantius, or again the Venerable Bed=
e and others, were so=20

painfully ignorant until the time of Galileo(93) of the most vital truths t=
aught in the Pagan temples--

of the rotundity of the earth, for example, leaving the heliocentric system=
 out of question--how=20

great must have been the ignorance of the rest! Learning and sin were synon=
ymous with the early=20

Christians. Hence the accusations of dealing with the Devil lavished on the=
 Pagan Philosophers.=20

But truth must out. The Occultists, referred to as "the followers of the ac=
cursed Cain," by such=20

writers as De Mirville, are now in a position to reverse the tables. That w=
hich was hitherto known=20

only to the ancient and modern Kabalists in Europe and Asia, is now publish=
ed and shown as=20

being mathematically true. The author of the _Key to the Hebrew-Egyptian My=
stery or the Source=20

of Measures_ has now proved to general satisfaction, it is to be hoped, tha=
t the two great God-

names, Jehovah and Elohim, stood, in one meaning of their numerical values,=
 for a diameter and=20

a circumference value, respectively; in other words, that they are numerica=
l indices of geometrical=20

relations; and finally that _Jehovah is Cain_ and _vice versa_.  This view,=
 says the author,=20

Helps also to take the horrid blemish off from the name of Cain,     as a p=
ut-up job to destroy his=20

character; for even without these     showings, by the very text, _he_ [Cai=
n] _was Jehovah_. So=20

the     theological schools had better be alive to making the amend     hon=
orable, if such a thing is=20



possible, to the good name and fame     of the God they worship.(94)   This=
 is not the first warning=20

received by the "theological schools," which, however, no doubt knew it fro=
m the beginning, as did=20

Clemens of Alexandria and others. But if it be so they will profit still le=
ss by it, as the admission=20

would involve more for them than the mere sacredness and dignity of the est=
ablished faith.  But, it=20

may also be asked, why is it that the Asiatic religions, which have nothing=
 of this sort to conceal=20

and which proclaim quite openly the Esoterism of their doctrines, follow th=
e same course? It is=20

simply this: While the present, and no doubt enforced silence of the Church=
 on this subject relates=20

merely to the external or theoretical form of the _Bible_--the unveiling of=
 the secrets of which=20

would have involved no practical harm, had they been explained from the fir=
st--it is an entirely=20

different question with Eastern Esoterism and Symbology. The grand central =
figure of the Gospels=20

would have remained as unaffected by the symbolism of the _Old Testament_ b=
eing revealed, as=20

would that of the Founder of Buddhism had the Brahmanical writings of the _=
Puranas_, that=20

=3DSymptoms.=3D=E2=80=94Foreign bodies[889] entering the trachea naturally =
fall toward the right bronchial=20

tube instead of the left because of the size and position of the entrance o=
f the right tube. If then=20

but one tube is involved, the signs will usually be on the right side; wher=
eas if the foreign body=20

stop in the larynx or trachea, both sides will be affected. The latter cond=
ition is much more=20

dangerous. The symptoms would be resonance over the lung with the respirato=
ry murmur partly or=20

wholly absent; less mobility; puerile breathing on the unaffected side. In =
either case there may at=20

first be little disturbance, especially if the shape of the foreign body is=
 such as not to greatly=20

interfere with the access of air; otherwise there may be at once, and almos=
t always will be after a=20

time, more or less urgent dyspn=C5=93a. Diminution of the necessary oxygen =
may cause convulsions,=20

apoplexy, and other brain symptoms. Acute emphysema of the portion of lung =
not obstructed may=20

follow its forcible distention. The local effect of the foreign body is an =
irritation which causes spasm=20

and cough. It may be carried upward by the expirations and downward again b=
y each inspiration.=20

Inflammation is likely to appear eventually and may involve the lung. If th=
e obstruction is not=20

complete there may follow periods of alternation of good and bad health, en=
ding perhaps in=20

recovery. The foreign body may be expelled after a greater or lesser interv=
al. On the other hand=20

death may result from secondary causes. In the absence of correct history t=
he symptoms may=20

lead to a wrong diagnosis and inappropriate treatment; as where a patient w=
hose symptoms=20

resulted from the presence of a piece of bone in the larynx, was treated fo=
r syphilis. A foreign body=20

may be coughed up from the lung into the trachea and fall backward into the=
 opposite lung.  Partial=20

closure of the larynx, most likely caused by a flat or irregular substance,=
 rather than globular, may=20

cause gradual asphyxia with symptoms of apoplexy, making the diagnosis diff=
icult.  When a=20

foreign body remains a long time in the larynx, spasmodic cough and croupy =
breathing usually=20

ensue, expectoration tinged with blood, hoarseness, or complete aphonia, pa=
in, dyspn=C5=93a,=20

possibly crepitation and dulness over the lungs. The case may end suddenly =
in death from closure=20

of the glottis, or the foreign body may pass into the trachea and set up a =
new train of symptoms, or=20

it may be expelled.  The frequency with which foreign bodies in the pharynx=
 or =C5=93sophagus=20

obstruct respiration, and the facility with which they may usually be remov=
ed, suggest a careful=20

examination. Otherwise the patient may be treated indefinitely for supposed=
 obstruction in the air-

passages. Foreign bodies in the =C5=93sophagus have perforated into the tra=
chea, and even the lungs,=20

heart, and aorta.   In complete suffocation death will occur in from two to=
 five  minutes (see=20



remarks under Strangulation). Death may also occur  instantaneously.   The =
experiments of the=20

Committee on Suspended Animation[890] showed  that when the trachea of a do=
g was exposed,=20

incised, and a tube tied  in, the average time covered by the respiratory e=
fforts after stopping  up=20

the tube with a cork was four minutes five seconds; the heart-beat  stoppin=
g at seven minutes=20

eleven seconds on the average. After four  minutes ten seconds it seemed to=
 be impossible for the=20

dog, unaided,  to recover. Faure[891] made the following experiment upon a =
large dog:  He fixed a=20

cork in the trachea. At first the dog was quiet; it then  extended its neck=
, parted its jaws, and made=20

efforts as if to vomit;  then tried to walk, but its gait was uncertain; fe=
ll down and rose  up. Its eyes=20

became dull, and finally it fell down on its side, and  became convulsed; t=
hen after several=20

seconds stretched itself out.  The thoracic movements were at first tumultu=
ous, then became=20

rapidly  feeble; the heart beating very slowly. At the necroscopy the lungs=
  filled the thorax, were=20

full of thick dark blood and emphysematous.  The blood was black and fluid =
in the left ventricle and=20

arteries,  and in the right cavities and veins resembled molasses. Liver da=
rkly  congested. There=20

was no mucus in the trachea and no ecchymosis in  the lungs. He also (p. 30=
6) tried the=20

experiment upon a large dog of  fastening boards against its thorax and tig=
htening them by means=20

of  cords. For some minutes it was quiet, but suddenly it became much  agit=
ated, stood upon its=20

hind legs, threw itself against the wall,  rolled on the ground, and uttere=
d frightful cries; finally fell=20

on  its side. There was no movement of the thorax, but the muscles of  the =
neck and belly were in=20

full and rapid action, dry and sonorous  r=C3=A2les were heard, and a large=
 quantity of mucus appeared=20

at the nose  and mouth. The movements grew feebler, the respirations infreq=
uent,  and at the end=20

of thirty-four minutes it was dead. The necroscopy  showed the blood black =
and thick; heart=20

relaxed; lungs red, a little  emphysematous, containing but little blood, a=
nd on their surface were=20

blackish points and small red spots.   The death of Desdemona (Shakespeare=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9COthello=E2=80=9D) has=20

been much  criticised. The declaration that she was strangled (or suffocate=
d)  does not consist=20

with the symptoms described (see _Med. News_,  Philadelphia, May 1st, 1886,=
 p. 489).=20

TREATMENT.  The obvious indication is to search for and remove the obstruct=
ion. The means=20

and methods of treatment are fully treated of in surgical works, but may be=
 briefly mentioned here.=20

Laryngoscopical examination may be necessary. A curved forceps is usually t=
he best instrument=20

for removing the foreign body. A tallow candle may serve to push it into th=
e stomach if there is no=20

bougie at hand. Suction may be used. Sneezing may be brought on by tickling=
 the nostrils;=20

coughing by tickling the glottis; vomiting by irritating the fauces, or by =
emetic; the body of the=20

subject may be inverted and in this position the fauces may be tickled, or =
fingers may be passed=20

back into the pharynx. Johnson[892] says that at the moment of inversion th=
e patient should try to=20

take a deep inspiration; this opens the glottis and facilitates the expulsi=
on of the foreign body. The=20

inspiratory current has no appreciable effect in retarding the movement of =
the foreign body in the=20

direction of gravity.  Noble recommends inversion of the body in new-born i=
nfants in which=20

asphyxia may be supposed to be due to an=C3=A6mia of the brain. Tracheotomy=
 or laryngotomy may=20

be necessary. It may be necessary to administer oxygen. Foreign bodies like=
 beards of grass and=20

fish-heads can be withdrawn only with difficulty because of their sharp pro=
jections. Intense=20

suffering and dyspn=C5=93a in a robust subject may necessitate venesection.=
 Generally speaking it is=20

better to bring up the foreign body than to push it down into the stomach. =
Beveridge suggests to=20

blow into the ear, to induce a reflex action and cause expulsion of the for=
eign body. Cold affusions,=20



artificial respiration, galvanism, frictions of the limbs, artificial heat,=
 stimulants by mouth and=20

rectum, may one or all be needed.  Hamilton[893] says that it is useless to=
 expect good results=20

from electricity if five minutes have elapsed since life appeared to be ext=
inct; Althaus,[894] that=20

three hours after death the muscles will cease to respond to faradization; =
and Richardson,[895]=20

that a low temperature prolongs the sensitiveness of the muscle.  With rega=
rd to insufflation, Le=20

Bon[896] objects to it in asphyxia as being hurtful and not useful. Colin[8=
97] tamponed the trachea=20

of a horse; in four minutes fifty seconds it was apparently dead; the tampo=
n was removed and=20

insufflation practised for fifteen to twenty minutes without effect. He cla=
ims that artificial respiration=20

is useless after the circulation ceases.  Fell[898] and O=E2=80=99Dwyer[899=
] recommend forced inspiration.=20

McEwen[900] uses a tracheal tube by the mouth.   Dew[901] offers a new meth=
od of artificial=20

respiration in asphyxia  of the new-born; Lusk[902] considers the subject o=
f life-saving  in still-

births; Forest,[903] artificial respiration in the same;  Read[904] discuss=
es Schultze=E2=80=99s method with=20

approval; Duke[905] plunges  the infant into hot water; Richardson[906] rec=
ommends artificial=20

circulation by injection of vessels, or electric excitation;  Jennings[907]=
 recommends the same;=20

Richardson[908] also considers  fully the subject of artificial respiration=
 and electrical excitation;=20

Woillez[909] has described and recommended what he calls a spirophore.  Aft=
er the removal of a=20

foreign body the irritation remaining may cause a sensation as if the body =
was still lodged.  Death=20

may occur from hemorrhage after its removal.   POST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.  Th=
ese are=20

mainly those of asphyxia. There may also be evidences of external violence,=
 homicidal or=20

accidental, as of pressure on the chest. Persistent deformity, flattening o=
f the nose and lips, and=20

excoriation of these parts may result from forcible closure of mouth and no=
se.  The SKIN AND=20

CONJUNCTIVA usually show patches of lividity and punctiform ecchymoses; esp=
ecially lividity on=20

the lips and limbs. The face may be pale or violet; it is often placid, esp=
ecially if the suffocation is=20

accidental. Tardieu[910] admits that infiltration of the conjunctiva and pu=
nctiform ecchymoses of=20

the face, neck, and chest may also be found sometimes in women after=20


_
birth, all been shown to be allegorical. Jesus of Nazareth, moreover, would=
 have gained more than=20

he would have lost had he been presented as a simple mortal left to be judg=
ed on his own=20

precepts and merits, instead of being fathered on Christendom as a God whos=
e many utterances=20

and acts are now so open to criticism. On the other hand the symbols and al=
legorical sayings that=20

veil the grand truths of Nature in the _Vedas_, the _Brahmanas_, the _Upani=
shads_ and=20

especially in the Lamaist _Chagpa Thogmed_ and other works, are quite of a =
different nature, and=20

far more complicated in their secret meaning. While the Biblical glyphs hav=
e nearly all a triune=20

foundation, those of the Eastern books are worked on the septenary principl=
e. They are as closely=20

related to the mysteries of Physics and Physiology, as to Psychism and the =
transcendental nature=20

of cosmic elements and Theogony; unriddled they would prove more than injur=
ious to the=20

uninitiated; delivered into the hands of the present generations in their a=
ctual state of physical and=20

intellectual development, in the absence of spirituality and even of practi=
cal morality, they would=20

become absolutely disastrous.  Nevertheless the secret teachings of the san=
ctuaries have not=20

remained without witness; they have been made immortal in various ways. The=
y have burst upon=20

the world in hundreds of volumes full of the quaint, head- breaking phraseo=
logy of the Alchemist;=20

they have flashed like irrepressible cataracts of Occult mystic lore from t=
he pens of poets and=20

bards. Genius alone had certain privileges in those dark ages when no dream=
er could offer the=20

world even a fiction without suiting his heaven and his earth to biblical t=
ext. To genius alone it was=20

permitted, in those centuries of mental blindness, when the fear of the "Ho=
ly Office" threw a thick=20

veil over every cosmic and psychic truth, to reveal unimpeded some of the g=
randest truths of=20

Initiation. Whence did Ariosto, in his _Orlando Furioso_, obtain his concep=
tion of that valley in the=20

Moon, where after our death we can find the ideas and images of all that ex=
ists on earth? How=20

came Dante to imagine the many descriptions given in his _Inferno_--a new J=
ohannine=20

Apocalypse, a true Occult Revelation in He records the result of the examin=
ation of those who died=20

from suffocation at the Pont de la Concorde, 1866. The face and upper parts=
 of the trunk were=20

generally light red to a deep violet or black color, with punctated blackis=
h ecchymoses on the face,=20

neck, and upper part of chest.  The EYES are usually congested. Mucus and s=
ometimes bloody=20

froth are found about the NOSE and MOUTH. The TONGUE may or may not protrud=
e.  The=20

BLOOD is usually dark and very fluid. Wounds after death may bleed. Accordi=
ng to Tardieu[911]=20

fluidity of the blood is most constant in compression of the chest and abdo=
men, as also its=20

accumulation in the vessels and right side of heart. Its color varies from =
red to black.  The BRAIN=20

and pia mater are generally congested. This is said to be invariable if the=
 eyes are congested.=20

Mackenzie in thirteen cases found the brain congested in all.  The HEART va=
ries much in=20

appearance and condition. The right side is often full of blood; occasional=
ly empty. Sometimes=20

subpericardial ecchymoses are found, usually along the coronary vessels. Th=
e blood in the heart=20

may be partly coagulated if the agony has been prolonged and there has been=
 a partial access of=20

air, which is gradually diminished. Mackenzie[912] found the right cavities=
 full and the left empty in=20

nine out of thirteen cases. Johnson[913] as a result of experiment on anima=
ls claims that when=20

access of air is prevented there is a rise in pressure in the arteries, the=
 right side of the heart fills,=20

the pulmonary capillaries become empty, and therefore the left side of the =
heart becomes empty.=20

As a result of further experiments[914] he verified his former conclusion, =
and added that in the last=20

stage of asphyxia there is increased pressure on the pulmonary artery and l=
essened pressure in=20



the systemic vessels. He thinks[915] that when both sides of the heart cont=
ain blood, there is=20

paralysis of vaso-motor nerves and the arteries.  The TRACHEA is usually br=
ight red and often=20

contains bloody froth. The LARYNX or trachea as well as PHARYNX or =C5=92SO=
PHAGUS may=20

contain a foreign body. If the latter has been removed the resulting irrita=
tion may be seen. The=20

LUNGS are sometimes congested, at others normal; color red or pale. Sometim=
es one lung=20

communion with the Souls of the Seven Spheres? In poetry and satire every O=
ccult truth has been=20

welcomed--none has been recognised as serious. The Comte de Gabalis is bett=
er known and=20

appreciated than Porphyry and Iamblichus. Plato's mysterious Atlantis is pr=
oclaimed a fiction,=20

Mackenzie found them congested in all of thirteen cases examined by him. Th=
e lungs of young=20

persons may be found comparatively small, almost bloodless, and emphysemato=
us. Tardieu, Albi,=20

and others believed that the _punctiform subpleural ecchymoses_ indicated s=
uffocation, and=20
