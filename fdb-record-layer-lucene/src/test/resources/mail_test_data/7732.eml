Tinker; she's my little girl.'  "If it hadn't been for Miss Mollie, I don't=
 know where I'd be now. I=20

married right after freedom. My husband, Alexander Boynton and I stayed rig=
ht on the plantation=20

and farmed on the shares.  "We had planty of children,--18 in all.--three s=
ets of twins. They all=20

grew up, except the twins, they didn't any of them get old enough to get ma=
rried, but all the rest=20

lived and raised children.  "They are all scattered around, but my youngest=
 son is only 38 years=20

old. I have grand-children, 40 years old.  "I don't know just how many, but=
 I have 20 grand-children=20

and I have three generations of grand-children. Yes, my grand-children, som=
e of them, have=20

grand-children. That makes five generations.  "I tell them that I am a "git=
zy, gitzy" grand-mother."=20

"I live right here with my daughter. She's my baby girl. I'm not very stron=

big time telling stories to my great-grand-children and great-great-grand c=
hildren".   SALENA=20

TASWELL:  Salena Taswell, 364 NW 8th St. Miami, Florida, is one of the olde=
st ex-slave women=20

in Miami. Like most ex-slaves she is very courteous; she will talk about th=
e "old times", if she has=20

once gained confidence in you, but her answers will be so laconic that two =
or three visits are=20

necessary in order for an interviewer to gain tangible information without =
appearing too proddish.=20

With short, measured step, bent form, unsteady head, wearing a beaming smil=
e, Salena takes the=20

floor.  "Ole Dr. Jameson, he wuz my Massy. He had a plantation three mile f=
rom Perry, Georgia. I=20

can 'member whole lots about working for them. Y' see I was growned up when=
 peace came.  "My=20

mother used to be a seamstress and sewed with her fingers all the time. She=
 made the finest kind=20

of stitches while I worked around de table or did any other kind of house w=
ork. proprietors. In=20

thirty-six years be executed no less than one hundred and seventy railway a=
nd other contracts. In=20

his residence, as in his enterprises, he now became cosmopolitan, and lived=
 a good deal on the=20

rail. He had the physical power to bear this life. His brother-in-law says,=
 "I have known him come=20

direct from France to Rugby having left Havre the night before--he would ha=
ve been engaged in=20

the office the whole day." He would then come down to Rugby by the mail tra=
in at twelve o'clock,=20

and it was his common practice to be on the works by six o'clock the next m=
orning. He would=20

frequently walk from Rugby to Nuneaton, a distance of sixteen miles. Having=
 arrived at Nuneaton=20

in the afternoon he would proceed the same night by road to Tamworth, and t=
he next morning he=20

would be out on the road so soon that he had the reputation among his staff=
 of being the first man=20

on the works. He used to proceed over the works from Tamworth to Stafford, =
walking the greater=20

part of the distance, and would frequently proceed that same evening to Lan=
caster in order to=20

inspect the works there in progress, under the contract which he had for th=
e execution of the=20

railway from Lancaster to Carlisle.  In constructing the Great Northern Rai=
lway the difficulties of=20

the Fen Country were met and surmounted. Mr. Brassey's chief agent in this =
was Mr. Ballard, a=20

man self raised from the ranks of labour but indebted for the eminence whic=
h he ultimately=20

attained to Mr. Brassey's discrimination in selecting him for the arduous u=
ndertaking. He has=20

borne interesting testimony to his superior's comprehensiveness and rapidit=
y of view, the=20

directness with which he went to the important point, disregarding secondar=
y matters and=20

economizing his time and thought.  The Italian Railway enterprises of Mr. B=
rassey owed their=20

origin to the=20


_
"I knowed de time when Ab'ram Linkum come to de plantation. He come through=
 there on the train=20

and stopped over night oncet. He was known by Dr. Jameson and he came to Pe=
rry to see about=20

the food for the soldiers.  "We all had part in intertainin' him. Some shin=
ed his shoes, some cooked=20

for him, an' I waited on de table, I can't forget that. We had chicken hash=
 and batter cakes and=20

dried venison that day. You be sure we knowed he was our friend and we catc=
hed what he had t'=20

say. Now, he said this: (I never forget that 'slong as I live) 'If they fre=
e de people, I'll bring you back=20

into the Union' (To Dr. Jameson) 'If you don't free your slaves, I'll "whip=
" you back into the Union.=20

Before I'd allow my wife an' children to be sold as slaves, I'll wade in bl=
ood and water up to my=20

neck'.  "Now he said all that, if my mother and father were living, they'd =
tell y' the same thing.=20

That's what Linkum said.  "He came through after Freedom and went to the 'S=
heds' first. I couldn't=20

'magine what was going on, but they came runnin' to tell me and what a time=
 we had.  "Linkum=20

went to the smoke house and opened the door and said 'Help yourselves; take=
 what you need;=20

cook yourselves a good meall and we sho' had a celebration!"  "The Dr. didn=
't care; he was lib'ral.=20

After Freedom, when any of us got married he'd give us money and send a ser=
vant along for us.=20

Sometimes even he'd carry us himself to our new home."     DADE COUNTY, FLO=
RIDA,=20

FOLKLORE  MIAMI'S EX-SLAVES   There is a unique organization in the colored=
 population of=20

Miami known as the "Ex Slave Club." This club now claims twenty-five member=
s, all over 65 years=20

of age and all of whom were slaves in this country prior to the Civil War. =
The members of this=20

interesting group are shown in the accompanying photograph. The stories of =
their lives as given=20

verbatim by these aged men and women are recorded in the following stories:=
   ANNIE TRIP:  "My=20

name's Annie Trip. How my name's Trip, I married a Trip, but I was borned i=
n Georgia in the=20

country not so very far from Thomasville. I'm sure you must ha' heard of Th=
omasville, Georgia.=20

Well, that's where I was borned, on Captain Hamlin's plantation.  "Captain =
Hamlin, he was a=20

greatest lawyer. Henry economical genius of Count Cavour and their executio=
n drew from the=20

Count the declaration that Mr. Brassey was one of the most remarkable men h=
e knew; clear-

headed, cautious, yet very enterprising and fulfilling his engagements fait=
hfully. "We never," said=20

the Count, "had a difficulty with him." And he added that Mr. Brassey would=
 make a splendid=20

minister of public works. Mr. Brassey took shares gallantly, and, when thei=
r value had risen most=20

generously resigned them with a view to enabling the government to interest=
 Piedmontese=20

investors in the undertaking. So far was he from being a maker of corners. =
It is justly remarked=20

that these Piedmontese railroads constructed by English enterprise were a m=
ost important link in=20

the chain of events which brought about the emancipation and unification of=
 Italy.  Mr. Brassey has=20

left on record the notable remark that the railway from Turin to Novara was=
 completed for about=20

the same money as was spent in obtaining the Bill for the railway from Lond=
on to York. If the=20

history of railway bills in the British Parliament, of which this statement=
 gives us an inkling, could=20

be disclosed, it would probably be one of the most scandalous revelations i=
n commercial history.=20

The contests which led to such ruinous expense and to so much demoralizatio=
n, both of=20

Parliament and of the commercial world, were a consequence of adopting the =
system of=20

uncontrolled competition in place of that of government control. Mr. Brasse=
y was in favour of the=20

system of government control. "He was of opinion that the French policy, wh=
ich did not admit the=20

principle of free competition, was not only more calculated to serve the in=
terests of the=20

shareholders, but more favourable to the public. He moreover considered tha=
t a multiplicity of=20



parallel lines of communication between the same termini, and the uncontrol=
led competition in=20

regard to the service of trains, such as exists in England, did not secure =
so efficient a service for=20

the public as the system adopted in France." Mr. Thomas Brassey says that h=
e remembers that=20

his father, when travelling in France, would constantly point out the super=
iority of the=20

arrangements, and express his regret that the French policy had not been=20


_
the greatest lawyer what ever was, so dey tell me. You see I was small. My =
mother and father and=20

four brothers all lived there together. Some of the rest were too small to =
remember much, but dey=20

wuz all borned dare just de samey. Wish I wuz dare right now. I had plenty =
of food then. I didn't=20

need to bother about money. Didn't have none. Didn't have no debts to pay, =
no bother not like=20

now.  "Now I have rheumatism and everything, but no money. Didn't need any =
money on Captain=20

Hamlin's plantation." And Annie walked away complaining about rheumatism an=
d no money, etc.=20

before her exact age and address could be obtained.   MILLIE SAMPSON:  Mill=
ie Sampson, 182=20

W. 14th St. Miami, Florida, was born in Manning, S.C. only three years 'bfo=
' Peace".  "My mother=20

and father were born on the same plantation and I di'n't have nothin' to do=
 'sept play with the white=20

children and have plenty to eat. My mother and father were and of sufficien=
tly frequent=20

communication, which were intended to be secured for the British public und=
er a system of free=20

competition, would have been equally well secured by adopting the foreign s=
ystem, and giving a=20

monopoly to the interest of railway communication in a given district to on=
e company; and then=20

limiting the exercise of that monopoly by watchful supervision on the part =
of the State in the=20

interests of the public." With regard to extensions, he thought that the go=
vernment might have=20

secured sufficient compulsory powers. There can be no sort of doubt that th=
is sort of policy would=20

have saved England an enormous amount of pecuniary loss, personal distress =
and public=20

demoralization. It is a policy, it will be observed, of government regulati=
on, not of government=20

subsidies or construction by government. It of course implies the existence=
 of an administration=20

capable of regulating a railway system,=20
