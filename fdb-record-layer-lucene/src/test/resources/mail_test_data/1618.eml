have an emotion left for anything beyond. He troubles himself not with what=
 fate the morrow may=20

bring forth, he dreams not of a beautiful future,--only he revels in the pr=
esent, and his glance looks=20

backward alone. Rich in ideas and impressions, he is poor in thought. He dr=
ains hastily the=20

foaming cup of life; he feels deeply and passionately; but it is as if he w=
ere never conscious of the=20

_
of the old Arab poetry. The life it depicts is so unlike any we can now wit=
ness, that it is almost=20

removed beyond the pale of our sympathies. The poetry is loaded with metaph=
ors and similes,=20

which to us seem far-fetched, though they are drawn from the simplest daily=
 sights of the=20

Bedawee. Moreover, it is only in fragments that we can read it; for the cha=
nge in the whole=20

character of Arab life and in the current of Arab ideas which followed the =
conquests of Islam=20

extinguished the old songs, which were no longer suitable to the new condit=
ions of things; and as=20

they were seldom recorded in writing, we possess but a little remnant of th=
em.[8] Yet 'these=20

fragments may be broken, defaced, dimmed, and obscured by fanaticism, ignor=
ance, and neglect;=20

but out of them there arises anew all the freshness, bloom, and glory of de=
sert-song, as out of=20

Homer's epics rise the glowing spring-time of humanity and the deep blue he=
avens of Hellas. It is=20

not a transcendental poetry, rich in deep and thoughtful legend and lore, o=
r glittering in the many-

coloured prisms of fancy, but a poetry the chief task of which is to paint =
life and nature as they=20

really are; and within its narrow bounds it is magnificent. It is chiefly a=
nd characteristically full of=20

manliness, of vigour, and of a chivalrous spirit, doubly striking when comp=
ared with the spirit of=20

abjectness and slavery found in some other Asiatic nations. It is wild and =
vast and monotonous as=20

the yellow seas of its desert solitudes; it is daring and noble, tender and=
 true.' [9]  There was one=20

place where, above all others, the Kaseedehs of the ancient Arabs were reci=
ted: this was 'Okadh,=20

the Olympia of Arabia, where there was held a great annual Fair, to which n=

blest,--     There the weary are at rest.      Saviour, may I call thee min=

merchants of Mekka and the south, but the poet-heroes of all the land resor=
ted. The Fair of 'Okadh=20

was held during the sacred months,--a sort of 'God's Truce,' when blood cou=
ld not be shed without=20

a violation of the ancient customs and faiths of the Bedawees. Thither went=
 the poets of rival=20

clans, who had as often locked       Every pain and peril past,--     We wi=
ll sing thy grace=20

abounding,       _More than conquerors at last_.          SALUS PER CHRISTU=
M.       Come, thou=20

Desire of nations, come,       And make thy promised kingdom sure;     Esta=
blish in our hearts the=20

throne       Which shall eternally endure.      In poverty and pain we=20


_
curses. There was little fear of a bloody ending to the poetic contest, for=
 those heroes who might=20

meet there with enemies or blood-avengers are said to have worn masks or ve=
ils, and their poems=20

were recited by a public orator at their dictation. That these precautions =
and the sacredness of the=20

time could not always prevent the ill-feeling evoked by the pointed persona=
lities of rival singers=20

leading to a fray and bloodshed is proved by recorded instances; but such r=
esults were=20

uncommon, and as a rule the customs of the time and place were respected. I=
n spite of occasional=20

broils on the spot, and the lasting feuds which these poetic contests must =
have excited, the Fair of=20

'Okadh was a grand institution. It served as a focus for the literature of =
all Arabia: every one with=20

any pretensions to poetic power came, and if he could not himself gain the =
applause of the=20

assembled people, at least he could form one of the critical audience on wh=
ose verdict rested the=20

fame or the shame of every poet. The Fair of 'Okadh was a literary congress=
, without formal=20

judges, but with unbounded influence. It was here that the polished heroes =
of the desert=20

determined points of grammar and prosody; here the seven Golden Songs were =
recited, although=20

(alas for the charming legend!) they were _not_ afterwards 'suspended' on t=
he Kaabeh; and here=20

'a magical language, the language of the Hijaz,' was built out of the diale=
cts of Arabia, and was=20

made ready to the skilful hand of Mohammad, that he might conquer the world=
 with his Kur-an.=20

The Fair of 'Okadh was not merely a centre of emulation for Arab poets: it =
was also an annual=20

review of Bedawee virtues. It was there that the Arab nation once-a-year in=
spected itself, so to=20

say, and brought forth and criticised its ideals of the noble and the beaut=
iful in life and in poetry.=20

For it was in poetry that the Arab--and for that matter each man all the wo=
rld over--expressed his=20

highest thoughts, and it was at 'Okadh that these thoughts were measured by=
 the standard of the=20

Lonely pilgrims, wending slowly       Toward the city where thou dwellest. =
     Thou dost see us,=20

weak and weary,     In the wilderness so dreary,     Mourning that we are n=

home so fair and blissful.      Yet thy promises do cheer us;     And thy S=
pirit, ever near us,     Bids=20

us pray, for thou wilt, hear us,       And afford us help and comfort.     =
 Hear thou, now, our=20

_
of poetry that the Arabic language has ever reached: it also upheld the nob=
lest idea of life and duty=20

that the Arab nation has yet set forth and obeyed. 'Okadh was the press, th=
e stage, the pulpit, the=20

Parliament, and the Academie Francaise of the Arab people; and when, in his=
 fear of the infidel=20

poets (whom Imra-el-Keys was to usher to hell), Mohammad abolished the Fair=
, he destroyed the=20

Arab nation even whilst he created his own new nation of Muslims;--and the =
Muslims cannot sit in=20

the places of the old pagan Arabs.  It is very difficult for the Western mi=
nd to dissociate the idea of=20

Oriental poetry from the notion of amatory odes, and sonnets to the lady's =
eyebrow: but even the=20

few extracts that have been given in this chapter show that the Arab had ma=
ny other subjects=20

besides love to sing about, and though the divine theme has its place in al=
most every poem, it=20

seldom rivals the prominence of war and nature-painting, and it is treated =
from a much less=20

sensual point of view than that of later Arab poets. Many writers have draw=
n a gloomy picture of=20

the condition of women in Arabia before the coming of Mohammad, and there i=
s no doubt that in=20

many cases their lot was a miserable one. There are ancient Arabic proverbs=
 that point to the=20

contempt in which woman's judgment and character were held by the Arabs of =
'the Time of=20

Ignorance,' and Mohammad must have derived his mean opinion of women from a=
 too general=20

impression among his countrymen. The marriage tie was certainly very loose =
among the ancient=20

Arabs. The ceremony itself was of the briefest. The man said _khitb_ (_i.e.=
_ I am an asker-in-

marriage), and the giver-away answered _nikh_ (_i.e._, I am a giver-in-marr=
iage), and the knot=20

was thus tied, only to be undone with equal facility and brevity. The frequ=
ency of divorce among=20

the Arabs does not speak       O, what rapture it will be,     When the nig=
ht of death is past,=20

Evermore to dwell with thee.          THE LIGHT OF LIFE.       O Jesus, sol=
e, sufficient source=20

Of hope that heals the sad heart=E2=80=99s strife,     Direct us on our dar=
kened course,       Thyself the Way,=20

the Truth, the Life.      Thou knowest the way we take, O Lord!       Didst=
 thou not prove its painful=20

length?     Help of the helpless, still afford       Thy pitying love, thy =
tender strength.      In every=20

trial, every care,       Thy patient footsteps may we see;     The sorrows =
of thy cross to share=20

Shall then our joy and glory be.      Secure in thy unchanging love,       =
No toil, no suffering will we=20

flee,     Assured that death itself shall prove       The path that leads t=
o heaven and thee.=20

CHRISTUS CONSOLATOR.       In the day of tribulation,     In the hour of so=
re temptation,     With=20

the strength of thy salvation,       Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.      When =
no more the heart may=20

borrow     Hope and courage from the morrow,--     In the darkest depths of=
 sorrow,       Jesus,=20

Saviour, comfort me.      When all aid is unavailing,     Flesh and heart t=
ogether failing,     Sin and=20

death the soul assailing,--       Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.      On thy w=
ord alone relying,--=20

Never thy dear name denying,--     O, forsake me not when dying!       Jesu=
s, Saviour, comfort me.=20

Crowned, at last, in light supernal,     Victor over foes infernal,--     W=
ith thy love, supreme, eternal,=20

Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.          HOLY SPIRIT, HEAVENLY GUEST!       Hol=
y Spirit, heavenly=20

Guest,     Make thy home within my breast;     Yearns for thee my weary hea=
rt,--     Come, and=20

nevermore depart.      Where thou dwellest peace abides,--     Grace surpas=
sing all besides,--=20

Priceless treasure, pure and=20


_
effect upon the women. Hence it is argued that women were the objects of co=
ntempt rather than of=20

respect among the ancient Arabs.  Yet there is reason to believe that the e=
vidence upon which this=20

conclusion is founded is partial and one-sided. There was a wide gulf betwe=
en the Bedawee and=20

the town Arab. It is not impossible that the view commonly entertained as t=
o the state of women in=20

preislamic times is based mainly on what Mohammad saw around him in Mekka, =
and not on the=20

ordinary life of the desert. To such a conjecture a curiously uniform suppo=
rt is lent by the ancient=20

poetry of the desert; and though the poets were then--as they always are--m=
en of finer mould than=20

the rest, yet their example, and still more their poems passing from mouth =
to mouth, must have=20

created a widespread belief in their principles. It is certain that the roa=
ming Bedawee, like the=20

mediaeval knight, entertained a chivalrous reverence for women, although he=
, too, like the knight,=20

was not always above a career of     Earnest of eternal rest.      God=E2=
=80=99s dear will be done in me=20

Even as it pleaseth thee;     Only let me fully prove     The sweet comfort=
 of thy love.      Cheerfully,=20

for Jesus=E2=80=99 sake,     May I every burden take,--     Glad to trace t=

Son of God.      Blessed Comforter and Guide,     Keep me near the Saviour=
=E2=80=99s side,     Till I in his=20

Brooded, once, thy bless=C3=A8d wings;     Groans the world with grief and =

n will come,--         His promise cannot=20

fail;       The royal=20


_
gallantry; but there was always a certain glamour of romance about the intr=
igues of the Bedawee.=20

He did not regard the object of his love as a chattel to be possessed, but =
as a divinity to be=20

assiduously worshipped. The poems are full of instances of the courtly resp=
ect displayed by the=20

heroes of the desert toward defenceless maidens, and the mere existence of =
so general an ideal=20

of conduct in the poems is a strong argument for Arab chivalry: for with th=
e Arabs the abyss=20

between the ideal accepted of the mind and the attaining thereof in action =
was narrower than it is=20

among 'more advanced' nations.  Whatever was the condition of women in the =
trading cities and=20

villages, it is certain that in the desert woman was regarded as she has ne=
ver since been among=20

Muslims. The modern hareem system was there as yet undreamt of; the maid of=
 the         Shall=20

over all prevail;     And Earth shall hear his summons dread,     And Death=
 and Hell give up their=20

feet         The firmament shall rend;     And, prostrate at his judgment t=
hrone,     The world his=20

sovereignty shall own.        O Son of Mary! hear         A helpless sinner=
