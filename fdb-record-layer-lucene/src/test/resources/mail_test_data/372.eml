philodendron monstera          to you. Here I've slept in this room for years, and          never paid any heed to the raps and taps, though          I've heard them often enough, interior of the continent. No barometer has yet been carried into the Sahara. With respect to the Llanos of America, I found by barometric heights observed at philodendron monstera          to you.

"Yet, as I looked, something in the carved paneling          struck my notice, and, following the 

direction in          which the spectral finger had pointed, I saw that          the dragons and the 

twisted scrolls were united in          the center by a Tudor rose. In an instant there          flashed 

across my mind the old saying which Jack          had quoted:                He who plucks a rose at 

Yule               Will bring back luck to Dacrepool.           What impulse urged me I cannot say, but 

compelled          by some seemingly irresistible suggestion I seized          the sculptured rose and 

wrenched at it with all my          strength. There was a dull thud, followed by a          harsh grinding 

noise, and the whole of the paneling          slid slowly back, revealing a cavity behind, where, 

half hidden by the accumulations of dust and          cobwebs, I could catch a sight of silver 

tankards          and masses of plate enough to make the mouth of a          collector water with 

envy. Still scarcely certain          whether I was sleeping or waking, I put in my hand          and drew 

out a bag filled with something heavy, and          even as I did so the rotten mildewed canvas 

broke          with the strain, and a stream of golden coins          descended with a clatter upon the 

floor.           "Like a maniac I rushed to my door into deserts, steppes, or savannahs; into bare 

lands without any appearance of vegetation, and lands covered with gramina or small plants of the 

dicotyledonous tribe. The savannahs of America, especially those of the temperate zone, have in 

many works been designated by the French term prairies; but this appears to me little applicable 

to pastures which are often very dry, though covered with grass of four or five feet in height. The 

Llanos and the Pampas of South America are really steppes. They are covered with beautiful 

verdure in the rainy season, but in the time of great drought they assume the aspect of a desert. 

The grass is then reduced to powder; the earth cracks; the alligators and the great serpents 

remain buried in the dried mud, till awakened from their long lethargy by the first showers of 

spring. These phenomena are observed on barren tracts of fifty or sixty leagues in length, 

wherever the savannahs are not traversed by rivers; for on the borders of rivulets, and around little 

pools of stagnant water, the traveller finds at certain distances, even during the period of the great 

droughts, thickets of mauritia, a palm, the leaves of which spread out like a fan, and preserve a 

brilliant verdure.  The steppes of Asia are all beyond the tropics, and form very elevated table-

lands. America also has savannahs of considerable extent on the backs of the

lustily for Jack, who, roused by my shouts, came          hurrying up in scanty attire, with a revolver 

in          one hand and a poker in the other.           "'What is it, old man, thieves or bailiffs? Just 

hold 'em till I come, can't you?'           "'It's neither,' I replied, as I hauled him in with          triumph, 

'but I believe I have had a visit from          your extensive steppes, the Llanos of Cumana, Caracas, 

and Meta, are little raised above the level of the ocean, and all belong to the equinoctial zone. 

These circumstances give them a peculiar character. They have not, like the steppes of southern 

Asia, and the deserts of Persia, those lakes without issue, those small systems of rivers which 

lose themselves either in the sands, or by subterranean

allow me to introduce you to the long-lost family          treasure.'           "There was no mistake 

about it--it was real enough,          and, as the Christmas bells came chiming through          the 

frosty air, we turned out bags of gold, piles          of silver and priceless jewels warranted to 

redeem          Dacrepool Grange twice over if necessary, and          sending Jack into a very 

ecstasy of joy.           Llanos of America incline to the east and south; and their running waters are 

branches of the Orinoco.  The course of these rivers once led me to believe, that the plains formed 

table-lands, raised at least from one hundred to one hundred and fifty toises above the level of the 

ocean. I supposed that the deserts of interior Africa were also at a considerable height; and that 

they rose one above another as in tiers, from the coast
