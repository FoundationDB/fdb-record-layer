Annoyed because the elderly gentleman refused to come to the door, he punched the doorbell two because I did n't think of it--if my back had been against a stone wall I could n't have felt more cornered.

fit in a little better with knighthood."  "Knights did a lot of fighting," Midge said reflectively.  "Which 

leads us to this thought," suggested Mrs. Hatfield. "Be prepared always to fight in defense of right, 

or your own country."  "How about doing good for others?" proposed Brad.  "Excellent. Now we 

have three rules for our knights to follow: 'Be Always Ready. Be Prepared. And Do Good Unto 

Others.'"  "They're easy rules to remember," Dan said. "But to follow 'em may not be quite so 

simple."  The Cubs worked a while longer on their armor. As they began to grow tired, Mrs. 

Hatfield said it was time to break up the meeting. Before the Cubs left the church, she reminded 

them to keep working on their pledge list for the building fund.  "The money isn't coming in as fast 

as we'd like," she declared. "We're especially short from the persons we expected to give fairly 

large amounts. So during the next few days dig in and really do your best."  Dan and Brad were 

the last to leave, lingering behind to help Mrs. Hatfield and Mrs. Holloway clean up the litter.  "I 

guess you meant us, Mrs. Hatfield," Brad remarked as they closed the church doors. "Dan and I 

haven't been very lucky in signing up our best prospects. Especially Mr. Merrimac."  "You've 

worked hard I know," she praised him. "All the same, it might be apart, and were disposed with a 

good deal of regularity, almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues. One 

always felt that an orderly and very sociable kind of life was going on there. I picketed Dude down 

in a draw, and we went wandering about, looking for a hole that would be easy to dig. The dogs 

were out, as usual, dozens of them, sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses. As 

we approached, they barked, shook their tails at us, and scurried underground. Before the mouths 

of the holes were little patches of sand and gravel, scratched up, we supposed, from a long way 

below the surface. Here and there, in the town, we came on larger gravel patches, several yards 

away from any hole. If the dogs had scratched the sand up in excavating, how had they carried it 

so far? It was on one of these gravel beds that I met my adventure.  We were examining a big hole 

with two entrances. The burrow sloped into the ground at a gentle angle, so that we could see 

where the two corridors united, and the floor was dusty from use, like a little highway over which 

much travel went. I was walking backward, in a crouching position, when I heard Antonia scream. 

She was standing opposite me, pointing behind me and shouting something in Bohemian. I 

whirled round, and there, on one of those dry

you use your best powers of persuasion."  "I doubt that, knowing him," Brad replied gloomily. "We 

can try though."  After leaving Mrs. Hatfield, the two boys walked on to the Merrimac home. 

Neither of them had any enthusiasm for the interview ahead.  "Well, let's get it over with," Brad 

sighed, as he shoved hard on the doorbell. "He can't do any worse than turn us down again."  Mr. 

Merrimac kept the boys waiting. Repeatedly, Brad jabbed his finger on the doorbell.  "He's in 

there," sunning himself, after the cold night, and he must have been asleep when Antonia 

screamed. When I turned he was lying in long loose waves, like a letter "W." He twitched and 

began to coil slowly. He was not merely a big snake, I thought--he was a circus monstrosity. His 

abominable muscularity, his loathsome, fluid motion, somehow made me sick. He was as thick as 

my leg, and looked as if millstones could n't crush the disgusting vitality out of him. He lifted his
