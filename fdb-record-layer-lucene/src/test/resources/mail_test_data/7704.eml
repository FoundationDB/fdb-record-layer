philodendron monstera stamped feet, struck out with heavy bare fists at his=
 nearest neighbour. Every one's hand was against every one else.  "Spy! Mar=
at! Informer!" were the three words that detached themselves most clearly f=
rom out the babel of vituperations freely hurled from end to end of the roo=
m.  The children screamed, the women's shrill or hoarse treble mingled with=
 the cries and imprecations of the men.  Paul restless, looked up and spoke=

d into her ear, and handing the mouth-piece to Duncan.  "You--you hear much=
 better now, Old Peg?" said the sick man, in his natural voice.  "Ay, much,=
 much better; thanks to the Lord--and to Mr Daniel."  "If Daniel had not th=
ought of it," said the invalid, quite gravely, "do you think that the philo=

 of it," said the invalid, quite gravely, "do you think that the _
jeopardy they cared little what happened to anybody else. They had retired =
behind their counter=20

and were in close consultation together, no doubt as to the best means of e=
scape if indeed the=20

man Paul Friche spoke the truth.  "I know nothing about him," the woman was=
 saying, "but he=20

certainly was right last night about those two men who came ferreting in he=
re--and last week=20

too...."  "Am I a Marat, maman Lemoine?" shouted the small man as he hammer=
ed his fists upon=20

the counter. "For ten years and more I have been a customer in this place a=
nd...."  "Am I a Marat?"=20

shouted the youth with the tow-coloured hair addressing the assembly indisc=
riminately. "Some of=20

you here know me well enough. Jean Paul, you know--Ledouble, you too...."  =
"Of course! Of=20

course I know you well enough, Jacques Leroux," came with a loud laugh from=
 one of the crowd.=20

"Who said you were a Marat?"  "Am I a Marat, maman Lemoine?" reiterated the=
 small man at the=20

counter.  "Oh! leave me alone with your quarrels," shouted the woman Lemoin=
e in reply. "Settle=20

them among yourselves."  "Then if Jacques Leroux is not a Marat," now came =
in a bibulous voice=20

from a distant comer of the room, "and this compeer here is known to maman =
Lemoine, where are=20

the real Marats who according to this fellow Friche, whom we none of us kno=
w, are spying upon=20

us?"  "Yes! where are they?" suggested another. "Show 'em to us, Paul Frich=
e, or whatever your=20

accursed name happens to be."  "Tell us where you come from yourself," scre=
amed the woman=20

with the shrill treble, "it seems to me quite possible that you're a Marat =
yourself."  This suggestion=20

was at once taken up.  "Marat yourself!" shouted the crowd, and the two men=
 who a moment ago=20

had been accused of being spies in disguise  "Hallo, Little Bill!" said Arc=
hie as his brother entered.=20

"You here!  I guessed as much.  Your passion for nursing since you attended=
 Dan is outrageous.=20

You do more nursing in this house, I do believe, than Elspie and Jessie and=
 Old Peg put together.=20

What d'ee mean by it, Bill? I get no good of you at all now!"  "I like it, =
Archie, and I'm training=20

myself to nurse you when you get ill or old!"  "Thank 'ee for nothin', Litt=
le Bill, for I don't mean to=20

become either ill or old for some time to come; but, I say, are they goin' =
to perform an operation on=20

Old Peg's head?"  This was said in consequence of Elspie shouting to the ol=
d woman to let her put=20

something into her ear to cure deafness.  "Cure deafness!" she exclaimed, w=
ith a faint laugh,=20

"nothin' will ever cure _my_ deafness.  But I can trust _you_, dearie, so d=
o what you please."=20

"Shut your eyes, then."  "And open your mouth!" said Archie to Little Bill =
in a low voice.  Old Peg=20

did as she was bid.  Dan, approaching behind her, put the small end of the =
tube into her right ear--

which was the best one--and Elspie, putting her mouth to the other end, spo=
ke to her in her soft,=20

natural voice.  The effect was amusing.  Old Peg dropped into her chair as =
if paralysed, and gazed=20

from one to another in mute amazement.  "Eh! dearie.  Did I ever think to h=
ear the sweet low voice=20

o' Elspie like as it was when she was a bairn!  Most amazin'!" she said.  "=
Let me hear't again."=20

The operation was repeated, and it was finally found that, by means of this=
 extemporised ear-

trumpet, the poor creature once more became a conversable member of society=
.  She went about=20

the house the remainder of that day in a quite excited state, asking questi=
ons of everybody, and=20

putting the end of=20


_
rest: "Marat yourself!"   III  After that, pandemonium reigned.  The words =
"police" and "Marats" had=20

aroused the terror of all these night-hawks, who were wont to think themsel=
ves immune inside=20

their lair: and terror is at all times an evil counsellor. In the space of =
a few seconds confusion held=20

undisputed sway. Every one screamed, waved even declared that he had caught=
 her alone in the=20

back-kitchen shoving the cat's head into the mouth-piece of the instrument,=
 and pinching its tail to=20

make it mew.  It was two days after the occurrence of these incidents that =
the old woman was=20

seated by Duncan's bedside, gazing through her tortoise-shell glasses at th=
e well-thumbed Bible,=20
