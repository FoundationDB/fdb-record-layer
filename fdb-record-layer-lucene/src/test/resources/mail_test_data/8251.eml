Accordingly, having put on his hat and cloak, and stationed himself at the =
gate, he appeared as=20

formidable as any doughty knight in the days of romance, ready to offer his=
 protection to some=20

forlorn damsel. No sooner, however, did the lady appear, than he became so =
confused as not to=20

be able to answer her greeting. She was also confused for a moment at his m=
anner, but=20

immediately began her walk with much disgust and _nonchalance_; while he, l=
ike a silly _valet de=20

chambre_, followed behind, leaving his dear mistress' questions unanswered,=
 and gazing with a=20

vacant stare at the moon. At length, to the lady's infinite satisfaction, t=
he white gate of her father's=20

_chateau_ appeared in view, and John, finding they had nearly reached their=
 destination,=20

articulated, in a half suffocated tone, "I--I beg pardon, ma--madam, I have=
 been considering--."=20

"You have, indeed, Mr. John," quickly returned the smiling damsel, "but I t=
hink you might have=20

chosen another opportunity, more seasonable than the present, to consider t=
he moon!" To this=20

retort, he said nothing, but looked extremely foolish and ridiculous. Howev=
er, when they had=20

actually gained the gate of the _chateau_, he boldly resolved to kiss his f=
air enslaver; but, after a=20

moment, his resolution failed, and his legs tottered under him. Without hea=
ring the lady's sweet=20

"good night," as she tripped gaily from him, he exclaimed, "Madam, can you =
love me?" This=20

appeal was not heard by the flying maiden, who hastily ascended the steps t=
o her father's door,=20

which opened and concealed her lovely form from the sight of the amazed lov=
er, who had not=20

courage sufficient to follow her.  Whether our idiot did not comprehend the=
 behaviour of his=20

mistress, I cannot say; certain it is, he went home well contented with the=
 success he imagined he=20

had gained towards winning her heart. But, in reality, she was disgusted wi=
th his foolery, and=20

ceased paying any more visits to her female friend, in order to avoid the s=
ight of so strange a=20

lover.  John, however, was a kind of philosopher, and calmly sustained his =
love misfortunes. A=20

particular occurrence happened which will somewhat account for this passive=
 resignation. One=20

evening, during a solitary walk, he saw his identical mistress in company w=
ith a young French=20

officer. He walked sullenly home, wrote some verses on the inconstancy of w=
omen, drew from=20

recollection a portrait no longer marked out in the map of the world. I wis=
h,=E2=80=9D continued the=20

gentleman in a tone almost coaxing=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CI wish we could devise =
some plan which, humanly=20

speaking, would secure to his holiness the possession of his holy throne fo=
rever. I wish I could=20

induce you to consider more favorably that suggestion, that his holiness sh=
ould content himself=20

with the ancient city, and, in possession of St. Peter=E2=80=99s and the Va=
tican, leave the rest of Rome to=20

the vulgar cares and the mundane anxieties of the transient generation. Yes=
,=E2=80=9D he added with=20

energy, =E2=80=9Cif, my dear Berwick, you could see your way to this, or so=
mething like this, I think even=20

now and at once, I could venture to undertake that the emperor, my master, =
would soon put an=20

end to all these disturbances and dangers, and that=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  =E2=

stopping him; =E2=80=9Csooner than that Attila, the Constable of Bourbon, o=

things in Europe, and will survive kings, emperors, or parliaments.=E2=80=

tap at the door, and, bidden to enter, Mr. Clifford presented himself with =
a sealed paper, for the=20

gentleman in evening dress. =E2=80=9CYour secretary, sir, brought this, whi=
ch he said must be given you=20

before you went to the ambassador.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Tis well,=E2=
=80=9D said the gentleman, and he rose, and with a=20

countenance of some excitement read the paper, which contained a telegram; =
and then he said:=20

=E2=80=9CThis, I think, will help us out of our immediate difficulties, my =
dear monsignore. Rattazzi has=20



behaved like a man of sense, and has arrested Garibaldi. But you do not see=

pleased as I should have anticipated.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGaribaldi has been=
 arrested before,=E2=80=9D said Berwick.  =E2=80=9CWell,=20

well, I am hopeful; but I must go to my dinner. I will see you again tomorr=

The continuous gathering of what, in popular language, were styled the Gari=
baldi Volunteers, on=20

the southern border of the papal territory in the autumn of 1867, was not t=
he only or perhaps the=20

greatest danger which then threatened the Holy See, though the one which mo=
st attracted its=20
