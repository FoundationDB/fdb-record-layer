philodendron monstera himself. Is he bound to stop payment at the end of th=

be as like pawning as any one thing can be like another. A peculiarity of h=
is business was, that he=20

always bought on acceptances, and for credit; he always sold for cash on de=
livery. Hence he=20

frequently, if not always, traded at a loss. He was sometimes so unlucky as=
 not to be able to get=20

half as much in cash for things as they had cost him in bills.  Such tradin=
g as this, the reader may=20

think, would soon come to an end. It is quite clear that such trading must =
end in bankruptcy and=20

ruin to some one, or to more than one. It is not, however, so sure that thi=
s mode of carrying on=20

business would overtake ruin speedily. Our American Samoan group conceived =
that the king,=20

Malietoa, was so prejudiced toward their interests that he should be depose=
d. So without much=20

ceremony they laid hands upon and carried him into exile, placing him on an=
 island some=20

thousands of miles distant.  There seems no reason to doubt that Germany=E2=
=80=99s ultimate design was=20

to formally occupy the islands. It is the old story of the civilized man=E2=
=80=99s dealings with the savage; of=20

the man who has ten talents, obtaining the property of the man with one.  M=
ethods have changed=20

somewhat, however, since the day when our pilgrim fathers kindly relieved t=
he Red man of such=20

encumbrances as he had in the way=20


_
persons that he might have gone on for three or four years if he had calcul=
ated well, and held his=20

ground boldly. How was that to be done? Easily. There is a process which I =
have heard=20

scientifically described as "widening the ratio." That would have done it. =
 Suppose that a man in=20

trade loses 500_l._ upon the business of 1000_l._, which is about the propo=
rtion in our Yankee's=20

business or its results. Suppose that he wants to spend, and titles in thei=
r flint-lock muskets. It is=20

not now considered =E2=80=9Cgood form,=E2=80=9D as it was in the days of ol=
den Spanish America, to declare one=E2=80=99s=20

slaves or tributaries,=20

without consulting them. The modern method is that of the European guide wh=

to your person willy-nilly, in order that he rifle your pockets as the need=
 of his divers imaginary=20

services. It=20
