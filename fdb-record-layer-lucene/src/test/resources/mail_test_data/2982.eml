Ze tree shall not be blown to atoms! I will drape it wiz my country's flag.=
"  From his coat the French=20

professor drew the tri-colored flag, which he draped over the lowest branch=
es of the old tree.=20

Then, as the red fire died out, the boys saw the German make a spring for h=
is enemy.  "Come on,=20

fellows!" softly called Jack. "We'd better skip while they're at one anothe=
r."  They glided from the=20

bushes, while at the foot of the tree, in the dying glow from the red fire,=
 could be seen two shapes=20

struggling desperately together. From the midst came such alternate express=
ions as:  "Ach! Pig-

dog! Frog-eater! Sauerkraut! Maccaroni! Himmel! Sacre! La Fayette!"  "Oh, b=
ut aren't they having=20

a grand time!" said Nat as he hurried along at Jack's side. "It worked like=
 a charm. But who would=20

have thought that Socrat would have brought along a pail of water?"  "Could=
n't have been better,"=20

admitted Jack, "if I do say it myself."  "But won't they find out who did i=
t?" asked Bony.  "They may=20

suspect, but they'll never know for sure," said the perpetrator of the tric=
k.  "How about the bundle=20

of papers you left in the tree?"  "Nothing but newspapers, and they can't t=
alk. But I guess we've=20

livened things up some. Anyhow, they've spoken to each other."  "They sure =
have," admitted Sam,=20

as from the darkness, at the foot of the tree, came the sounds of voices in=
 high dispute.  The next=20

day Professor Socrat passed Professor Garlach without so much as a look in =
the direction of the=20

German, but when he got past he muttered:  "Ze La Fayette tree still stands=
."  And Professor=20

Garlach replied:  "Pig-dog vot you are! To destroy dot secret of history!" =
 Jack and his chums=20

awaited rather anxiously the calling of the French and German classes that =
day, but neither=20

professor made any reference to the happenings of the night previous. All t=
here was to remind a=20

passer-by of it were some shreds of a French flag hanging to the limbs of t=
he tree.  "They must=20

have ripped the flag apart in their struggle with each other," said Sam as =
he and Jack passed the=20

place.  Matters at Washington Hall went on the even tenor of their ways for=
 about two weeks. The=20

boys buckled down to study, though there was plenty of time for sport, and =
the football eleven, of=20

which Jack was a member, played several games.  The weather was getting col=
d and snappy, and=20

there were signs of an early and severe winter. These signs were borne out =
one morning when=20

Jack crawled out                                                     A=20

"Whew! but it's cold!" he said as he pulled aside the window curtains and l=
ooked out. Then he=20

uttered an exclamation. "Say, Nat, it's snowing to beat the band!"  "Snowin=
g?"  "Sure, and I've got=20

to go to the village this afternoon. Look!"  Nat crawled out, shivering, an=
d stood beside Jack.=20

"Why, it is quite a storm," he admitted. "B-r-r-r-r! I'm going to get my fl=
annels out!"  "No football=20

game to-morrow," said Jack. "I guess winter's come to stay."     CHAPTER VI=
I  A STRANGE=20

CONFESSION   "Say, Jack," began Nat at breakfast a little later, "what are =
you going to the village=20

for?"  "Got to get something Aunt Angelina sent me," replied our hero. "I g=
ot a letter saying she=20

had forwarded me a=20


_
heavy underwear in it for one thing, but I know enough of my aunt to know t=
hat's not all that's in it."=20

"What else?"  "Well, I shouldn't be surprised if there were some pies and d=
oughnuts and cakes=20

and----"  "Quit!" begged Bony, who sat on the other side of Jack. "You make=
 me hungry."  "What's=20

the matter with this grub?" inquired=20
