shocked at the idea. [Goes away from the window.] I am such a coward.  MAND=
ERS. You call it=20

"cowardice" to do your plain duty? Have you forgotten that a son ought to l=
ove and honour his=20

father and mother?  MRS. ALVING. Do not let us talk in such general terms. =
Let us ask: Ought=20

Oswald to love and honour Chamberlain Alving?  MANDERS. Is there no voice i=
n your mother's=20

heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?  MRS. ALVING. But what=
 about the truth?=20

MANDERS. But what about the ideals?  MRS. ALVING. Oh--ideals, ideals! If on=
ly I were not such=20

a coward!  MANDERS. Do not despise ideals, Mrs. Alving; they will avenge th=
emselves cruelly.=20

Take Oswald's case: he, unfortunately, seems to have few enough ideals as i=
t is; but I can see=20

that his father stands before him as an ideal.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, that is t=
rue.  MANDERS. And=20

this habit of mind you have yourself implanted and fostered by your letters=
.  MRS. ALVING. Yes; in=20

my superstitious awe for duty and the proprieties, I lied to my boy, year a=
fter year. Oh, what a=20

coward--what a coward I have been!  MANDERS. You have established a happy i=
llusion in your=20

son's heart, Mrs. Alving; and assuredly you ought not to undervalue it.  MR=
S. ALVING. H'm; who=20

knows whether it is so happy after all--? But, at any rate, I will not have=
 any tampering with=20

Regina. He shall not go and wreck the poor girl's life.  MANDERS. No; good =
God--that would be=20

terrible!  MRS. ALVING. If I knew he was in earnest, and that it would be f=
or his happiness--=20

MANDERS. What? What then?  MRS. ALVING. But it couldn't be; for unfortunate=
ly Regina is not=20

the right sort of woman.  MANDERS. Well, what then? What do you mean?  MRS.=
 ALVING. If I=20

weren't such a pitiful coward, I should say to him, "Marry her, or make wha=
t arrangement you=20

please, only let us have nothing underhand about it."  MANDERS. Merciful he=
avens, would you let=20

them marry! Anything so dreadful--! so unheard of--  MRS. ALVING. Do you re=
ally mean "unheard=20

of"? Frankly, Pastor Manders, do you suppose that throughout the country th=
ere are not plenty of=20

married couples as closely akin as they?  MANDERS. I don't in the least und=
erstand you.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Oh yes, indeed you do.  MANDERS. Ah, you are thinking of the possib=
ility that--Alas!=20

yes, family life is certainly not always so pure as it ought to be. But in =
such a case as you point to,=20

one can never know--at least with any certainty. Here, on the other hand--t=
hat you, a mother, can=20

think of letting your son--  MRS. ALVING. But I cannot--I wouldn't for anyt=
hing in the world; that is=20

precisely what I am saying.  MANDERS. No, because you are a "coward," as yo=
u put it. But if you=20

were not a "coward," then--? Good God! a connection so shocking!  MRS. ALVI=
NG. So far as that=20

goes, they say we are all sprung from connections of that sort. And who is =
it that arranged the=20

world so, Pastor Manders?  MANDERS. Questions of that kind I must decline t=
o discuss with you,=20

Mrs. Alving; you are far from being in the right frame of mind for them. Bu=
t that you dare to call=20

your scruples "cowardly"--!  MRS. ALVING. Let me tell you what I mean. I am=
 timid and faint-

hearted because of the ghosts that hang about me, and critical advance, sin=
ce they came within=20

thirty rods of the Baltimore turnpike, where lay his trains and reserve amm=
unition. The South has=20

always believed that, had Stonewall Jackson been there, the Federal rear wo=
uld have been=20

reached, and rout and capture made certain.  For both sides it had been a d=
ay of terrible=20

experiences, and for the Federals the outlook was perhaps more gloomy than =
for their foes. On=20

each flank the Confederates had gained an advantage, and Lee probably felt =
a hopefulness which=20

the circumstances did not really justify. Meade gathered his generals at mi=
dnight in council. It was=20

in a little room, but ten or twelve feet square, a group dust-covered and s=
weat-stained, the strong=20

faces sternly earnest. Some sat on the bed; some stood; Warren, wounded, st=
retched out on the=20



floor, was overcome by sleep. There was no vote but to fight it out on the =
morrow. In this Meade=20

acquiesced, carefully planning for a retreat, however, should the need aris=
e. To Gibbon,=20

commanding the Second Corps, placed between the wings, he said: =E2=80=9CYo=
ur turn will come to-

morrow. To-day he has struck the flanks; next, it will be the centre.=E2=80=
=9D[262]  Lee was drawn on by the=20

success of the first day to fight again on the second; his success on the s=
econd induced him to try=20

for the third time; but he had exhausted his good-fortune. At earliest dawn=
 of July 3, 1863, began a=20

wrestle for the possession of Culp=E2=80=99s Hill, Ewell heavily reinforcin=
g the Stonewall division which had=20

won footing there the night before, and the Twelfth Corps as stubbornly str=
uggling for the ground it=20

had lost. It was a fight of six hours, in which the extreme northern wings =
of the two armies only=20

were concerned. The Federals won, at a heavy sacrifice of life.  [Illustrat=
ion: POSITION, JULY 3,=20

IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON]  Elsewhere the armies rested, an ominous silence at=
 last reigning=20

on the trampled and bloody field under the mid-day sun. Meade and his soldi=
ers knew that it=20

portended danger, and with a sure intuition the army chief was watching wit=
h especial care the=20

centre, as yet unassailed. On the Confederate side, the unhappy Longstreet,=
 at odds with his chief=20

as to the wisdom of the campaign from the start, and disapproving both its =
strategy and tactics,=20

was now in deeper gloom than ever. Lee had determined to assault the Federa=
l centre, and by a=20

cruel turn of fate the blow must be struck by the reluctant Longstreet. Of =
the three great=20

Confederate corps, it was only in Longstreet=E2=80=99s that a force remaine=
d as yet unwrung by the fearful=20

agonies of the last two days. Pickett=E2=80=99s division, solidly Virginian=
, and in the eyes of Lee a Tenth=20

Legion in its valor, as yet had done nothing, and was to bear the brunt of =
the attack. =E2=80=9CWhat troops=20

do you design for the assault?=E2=80=9D Longstreet had asked. Lee, having i=
ndicated Pickett=E2=80=99s division of=20

five thousand, with auxiliary divisions, making an entire number in the cha=
rging column of fifteen=20

thousand, the Georgian burst out: =E2=80=9CI have been a soldier from the g=
round up. I have been with=20

soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, arm=
ies, and should know=20

as well as any one what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that=20


_
shake off.  MANDERS. What do you say hangs about you?  MRS. ALVING. Ghosts!=
 When I heard=20

Regina and Oswald in there, it was as though ghosts rose up before me. But =
I almost think we are=20

all of us ghosts, Pastor Manders. It is not only what we have inherited fro=
m our father and mother=20

that "walks" in us. It is all sorts of dead ideas, and lifeless old beliefs=
, and so forth. They have no=20

vitality, but they cling to us all the same, and we cannot shake them off. =
Whenever I take up a=20

newspaper, I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There must be gh=
osts all the country=20

over, as thick as the sands of the sea. And then we are, one and all, so pi=
tifully afraid of the light.=20

MANDERS. Aha--here we have the fruits of your reading. And pretty fruits th=
ey are, upon my=20

word! Oh, those horrible, revolutionary, free-thinking books!  MRS. ALVING.=
 You are mistaken, my=20

dear Pastor. It was you yourself who set me thinking; and I thank you for i=
t with all my heart.=20

MANDERS. I!  MRS. ALVING. Yes--when you forced me under the yoke of what yo=
u called duty=20

and obligation; when you lauded as right and proper what my whole soul rebe=
lled against as=20

something loathsome. It was then that I began to look into the seams of you=
r doctrines. I wanted=20

only to pick at a single knot; but when I had got that undone, the whole th=
ing ravelled out. And=20

then I understood that it was all machine-sewn.  MANDERS. [Softly, with emo=
tion.] And was that=20

the upshot of my life's hardest battle?  MRS. ALVING. Call it rather your m=
ost pitiful defeat.=20

MANDERS. It was my greatest victory, Helen--the victory over myself.  MRS. =
ALVING. It was a=20

crime against us both.  MANDERS. When you went astray, and came to me cryin=
g, "Here I am;=20

take me!" I commanded you, saying, "Woman, go home to your lawful husband."=
 Was that a=20

crime?  MRS. ALVING. Yes, I think so.  MANDERS. We two do not understand ea=
ch other.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Not now, at any rate.  MANDERS. Never--never in my most ever arraye=
d for battle can=20

take that position.=E2=80=9D[263]  But Lee was unmoved. Confident of succes=
s, he despatched Stuart,=20

arrived at last after his raid, so long and futile, around beyond the Feder=
al right. When the Union=20

centre should be broken and Meade thrown into retreat, Stuart was to seize =
its only practicable=20

route for retreat, the Baltimore pike, and make the defeat decisive.  Meade=
, meantime, had=20

managed warily and well. At his centre stood Hancock, his best lieutenant. =
There were massed=20

the First and Second corps, with reserve troops at hand ready to pour in at=
 the word, with batteries=20

bearing upon front and flank, every approach guarded, every man and horse o=
n the alert. The=20

provost guards, and in the rear of all a regiment of cavalry, formed in lin=
e behind, had orders to=20

shoot any faint-hearts who, in the crisis, should turn from the foe to flee=
.[264] At one o=E2=80=99clock two=20

signal-guns were heard on Seminary Ridge, upon which followed a terrible ca=
nnonade, appalling=20

but only slightly harmful, for the waiting ranks found cover from the missi=
les. Feeling sure that this=20

was a prelude to something more serious, the Federal chief relaxed his fire=
 to spare his=20

ammunition. It was understood on the other side that the Federal guns were =
silenced; and that=20

moment having been appointed as the time for the onset, Pickett inquired of=
 Longstreet if he=20

should go forward. Longstreet, convinced that the charge must fail, made no=
 reply, though the=20

question was repeated. =E2=80=9CI shall go forward,=E2=80=9D said Pickett, =
to which his general bowed his head.=20

Instantly was heard the footbeat of the fifteen thousand, and the heavy-hea=
rted Longstreet,=20

mounting his horse, rode out to behold the sacrifice. He has recorded that =
the column passed him=20

down the slope high-hearted, buoyant, hopeful, Pickett riding gracefully, l=
ike a holiday soldier, with=20

cap set jauntily on his long, auburn locks.[265]  The silence of the Federa=
l guns had been for a=20

purpose. As=20


_
otherwise than as another's wife.  MRS. ALVING. Oh--indeed?  MANDERS. Helen=
--!  MRS.=20

ALVING. People so easily forget their past selves.  MANDERS. I do not. I am=
 what I always was.=20

MRS. ALVING. [Changing the subject.] Well well well; don't let us talk of o=
ld times any longer. You=20

are now over head and ears in Boards and Committees, and I am fighting my b=
attle with ghosts,=20

both within me and without.  MANDERS. Those without I shall help you to lay=
. After all the terrible=20

things I men appeared there was a sudden reopening of their tumult; a deadl=
y sequence from=20

round-shot to canister, and thence to the Mini=C3=A9-balls of the infantry.=
 The defenders now saw=20

before them, as they peered through the battle smoke from their shelter, a =
solid wedge of men, the=20

division of Pickett, flanked by masses on the right and left commanded by P=
ettigrew and Wilcox.=20

The column approached, and visibly melted away. Of Pickett=E2=80=99s comman=
ders of brigades every one=20

went down, and their=20


_
unprotected girl to remain in your house.  MRS. ALVING. Don't you think the=
 best plan would be to=20

get her provided for?--I mean, by a good marriage.  MANDERS. No doubt. I th=
ink it would be=20

desirable for her in every respect. Regina is now at the age when--Of cours=
e I don't know much=20

about these things, but--  MRS. ALVING. Regina matured very early.  MANDERS=
. Yes, I thought=20

so. I have an impression that she was remarkably well developed, physically=
, when I prepared her=20

for confirmation. But in the meantime, she ought to be at home, under her f=
ather's eye--Ah! but=20

Engstrand is not--That he--that he--could so hide the truth from me! [A kno=
ck at the door into the=20

hall.]  MRS. lay literally in heaps beside them.     =E2=80=9CA thousand fe=
ll where Kemper led;     A=20

thousand died where Garnett bled;     In blinding flame and strangling smok=
e     The remnant=20

through the batteries broke,     And crossed the line with Armistead.=E2=80=
=9D  A hundred or so, led by=20

Armistead, his cap held aloft on his sword-point, actually penetrated the F=
ederal line and reached=20

the =E2=80=9Cclump of trees=E2=80=9D just beyond, holding for a few moments=
 a battery. Pettigrew and Trimble, just=20

north, struggled also for a footing. But the foothold was only for a moment=
; on front and flank the=20

Federals converged, and the tide rolled slowly and heavily rearward. For th=
e South all hope of=20

victory was gone.=20


_
ENGSTRAND. [In his Sunday clothes, in the doorway.] I humbly beg your pardo=
n, but--=20

MANDERS. Aha! H'm--  MRS. ALVING. Is that you, Engstrand?  ENGSTRAND.--ther=
e was none=20

of the servants about, so I took the great liberty of just knocking.  MRS. =
ALVING. Oh, very well.=20

Come in. Do you want to speak to me?  ENGSTRAND. [Comes in.] No, I'm oblige=
d to  (From a=20

print of the time)]  As the broken and diminished multitude fell back to Se=
minary Ridge, Lee rode=20

out to meet them. He was alone, his staff being all absent, in that supreme=
 moment, on desperate=20

errands. His face was calm and resolute, his voice confident but sympatheti=
c as he exclaimed, =E2=80=9CIt=20

was all my fault; now help me to do what I can=20
