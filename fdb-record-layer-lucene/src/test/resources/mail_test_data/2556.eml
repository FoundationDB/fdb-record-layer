XIII.  RAIN, HAIL AND SNOW.      =E2=80=9CI bring fresh showers for the _
of the Sunday joint and the rest of the needful week's supply of provision,=
 but every man had=20

engagements which could not be so easily deferred. Every Friday night the p=
orters assembled at a=20

"public" to spend a convivial hour. Was this enjoyment to be sacrificed, or=
 even postponed? It was=20

more than human nature, cast in the railway-porter mould, could endure with=
out protests as loud=20

as they were deep. Were they to be laughed at, and jeered at, and told that=
 the company was=20

insolvent, that their masters couldn't pay their wages? It was too bad. Had=
n't they feelings as well=20

as a secretary, or a general manager, or a director, or the chairman of a b=
oard? That was what=20

they would like to know. They meant to say it was shameful, scandalous, atr=
ocious, and=20

abominable, and worthy of harsher terms of description. This is not only wh=
at they meant to say, it=20

is what they did say.  During the night the news had circulated up and down=
 the line, and over all=20

its tributaries. In the morning it was known to the secretary and the chief=
 cashier. The=20

circumstances of the case were so peculiar, that these leading functionarie=
s did not feel=20

themselves competent to deal with it. The secretary hastened to confer with=
 the chairman of the=20

board, who again consulted two of his colleagues, who happened to be in Tow=
n, and, in=20

consequence, certain steps were taken.  In the first place a cheque was dra=
wn upon the=20

company's bankers for the amount they had been robbed of--exactly 2310_l._ =
18_s._ 6_d._; and a=20

clerk was despatched to all the stations for the satisfaction and comfort o=
f all the indignant=20

servants, who had now grown clamorous for their wages.  Wilson's conduct wa=
s the topic of=20

serious consideration. Could he have run away with the money? How could the=
 robbery have been=20

effected without his participation or connivance? What was his previous cha=
racter? What sort of=20

references did he bring to the company when he first entered its service, n=
ow five years ago? The=20

latter questions were answered satisfactorily; the former were not. The chi=
ef cashier echoed a=20

general opinion when he declared that he did not think Wilson capable of su=
ch a villanous and=20

wholesale robbery. Yet the chairman of the board and the secretary did not =
see and dies out. At=20

other times long golden draperies float above the head of the spectator, an=
d take a thousand folds=20

and undulations, as if agitated by the wind. They appear to be at but a sli=
ght elevation in the=20

atmosphere, and it seems strange that the rustling of the folds, as they do=
uble back on each other,=20

is not audible. Generally a luminous bow is seen in the north; a black segm=
ent separates it from=20

the horizon, its dark color forming a contrast with the pure white or red o=
f the bow, which darts=20

forth the rays, extends, becomes divided, and soon presents the appearance =
of a luminous fan,=20

which fills the northern sky, and mounts nearly to the zenith, where the ra=
ys, uniting, form a crown,=20

which in its turn, darts forth luminous jets in all directions. The sky the=
n looks like a cupola of fire:=20

blue, green, red, yellow and white vibrate in the palpitating rays of the a=
urora. But this brilliant=20

spectacle lasts only a few minutes; the crown first ceases to emit luminous=
 jets, and then gradually=20

dies out; a diffuse light fills the sky; here and there a few luminous patc=
hes, resembling light=20

clouds, open and close with an incredible rapidity, like a heart that is be=
ating very fast. They soon=20

get pale in their turn; everything fades away and becomes confused; the aur=
ora seems to be in its=20

death-throes; the stars, which its light had obscured, shine with a renewed=
 brightness; and the=20

long polar night, sombre and profound, again assumes its sway over the icy =
solitudes of earth and=20

ocean.=E2=80=9D  In the presence of such brilliancy and beauty, both poet a=
nd artist may despair. It may be=20

copied only by the master hand that sent it flaming through the heavens. Th=
ere is naught under=20

the sun whereunto to liken it, and it is the electric flash which men may l=
east fear; and yet, even it=20



has wrought evil at times; for its magnetic power disturbs the compass; and=
 the electric storms it=20

betokens have more than once in the past caused electric wires to set objec=
ts near them on fire. I=20

well remember the powerful electric disturbances that attended a magnificen=
t aurora in 1884,=20

which was visible as far as southern Arkansas. Depots were fired in many pl=
aces by electric=20

switch-boards; one in Pennsylvania taking fire four times.=20


_
without his connivance, or, they thought, indeed without his active partici=
pation. They asked again=20

and again, How could it have been done in despite of his vigilance? They se=
arched the papers,=20

and examined the "Clerks' Reference Book" to see what sort of references he=
 gave when engaged=20

as one of their servants. Nothing could be more satisfactory than these. Th=
eir distinctness,=20

emphasis, and telephones were temporarily useless.  Such are the phenomena =
presented in the=20

atmosphere by this most mysterious power. Dreadful in the lightning=E2=80=
=99s leap, strange and uncanny=20

in the aureole=E2=80=99s glow, wildly and weirdly beautiful in the flickeri=
ng flash and flow of the Northern=20

Light, we have seen that, though it has played an important part in the his=
tory of the world=20

because of its appeal to=20
