pretended friend that=20

was robbing them? He finished in mutterings, which, although not capable of=
 being accurately=20

embalmed in printer's ink, may be safely interpreted as imprecations and di=
reful threats.  In this=20

mode his conversation with his wife one evening rambled; and at the conclus=
ion of his incoherent=20

ejaculations, he started to his feet as if he had made a grand discovery. "=
By G--, it must be=20

somebody in the house. It must be one of the servants. It must be that girl=
 you have so fondled=20

and caressed. The ungrateful wretch! If I find it out to be her, and I must=
 find it out, I will have her=20

arrested, prosecuted, transported."  His wife was terrified. The idea of pr=
osecuting this poor girl,=20

whose life in many respects resembled her own,--the chief point of differen=
ce being, in fact, that=20

she had not been able to catch a merchant husband,--told on Mrs. Green's sy=
mpathies. Yet, as=20

she said to her husband--if he were right--it was horrid ingratitude in tha=
t girl to rob them so--if she=20

had done it.  "But suppose," suggested the wife, "we should be mistaken, ho=
w cruel will be the=20

suspicions we have engendered!"  "Cruel!" exclaimed the husband; "yes, if w=

things from thee!        Restore the dead, thou sea!=E2=80=9D  [Illustratio=

atmosphere, the ocean has its great constant currents, which play an import=
ant part in the=20

economy of nature. These flow steadily on, one beneath another, and are lit=
tle affected by=20

atmospheric disturbances. The presence of submarine currents is often shown=
 by icebergs moving=20

steadily onward against a surface current and moderate wind. But there is n=
othing in the sea, so=20

far as known, that corresponds to the variable winds or local currents of t=
he atmosphere: for as=20

water is so much heavier than air, its equilibrium is not so easily disturb=
ed by unusual heating: and=20

moreover, it does not expand under the influence of heat to an extent in th=
e least approaching the=20

expansion of the air. Hence, its currents are steady and slow-moving, and, =
however much they=20

affect climate and winds by the heating or cooling of the air above them, t=
hey offer no obstacle=20

worthy of note to the sailor. The latter must then fear only the power of t=
he storm: and were=20

submarine vessels=20

be mistaken?"  He ran through the circumstances under which several article=
s of value had been=20

lost, to show that no friend or acquaintance could have robbed them.  Burgl=
ary was impossible,=20

because of the frequency, the width of time and occasion, and the comparati=
ve smallness, of the=20

plunder.  It must, at all events, be one or other of the servants; and he f=
elt it to be his duty to=20

investigate the matter thoroughly. He was determined to do this. It was a d=
uty they owed to=20

themselves, and the other servants, and all their friends, and to the world=
, that this thief should be=20

detected.  Mrs. Green said readily constructed and navigated, the storm wou=
