urishing corporate=20

bonds markets has erupted on the scene. Many regard this surge as a specula=

by the high level of oil prices.  Others (mostly Western brokerage houses) =
swear that the market is=20

undervalued, having fallen by more than 90% in 1998. Russia is different - =
they say - it is better=20

change), and the economy is expanding. The same pundits talked the RTS up 1=
80% in 1997 only=20

to see it shrivel in an egregious case of Asian contagion. The connection b=
etween Russia's macro=20

and micro is less than straightforward.  Whatever the truth, investors are =
clearly more=20

discriminating. Both the New York Times and The Economist cite the example =
of Yukos Oil (up=20

190%) versus Lukoil (up a mere 30%). The former is investor friendly and pu=
blishes internationally=20

lly, to Russia - or by=20

trading ADR's of Russian firms on NYSE (10-20 times the US dollar volume of=
 the RTS). ADR's of=20

smaller firms are traded OTC and, according to the New York Times, one can =
short sell Russian=20

securities through offshore vehicles. The latter are also used to speculate=
 in the shares of defunct=20

Russian firms ("shells") traded in the West.  III. Debt Markets  Perhaps th=
e best judges of Russia's=20

are the Russians. When the author of this article suggested that Russia's 1=

serendipitous (in "Argumenti i Fakti" dated October 28, 1998), he was derid=
ed by Western analysts=20

but supported by Russian ones. In hindsight, the Russians were right. They =
may be right today as=20

well when they claim that Russia has never been better.  The ruble devaluat=
ion (which made=20

Russian goods competitive) and rising oil prices yielded a trade surplus of=
 more than $50 billion=20
