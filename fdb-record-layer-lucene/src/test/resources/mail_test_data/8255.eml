suggests the use of models, all has the look of spontaneity as though the a=
rtist had made his=20

notes in passing, without the slightest regard to producing a picture, with=
 only the idea of=20

reproducing life. Life, however, appears in his canvases in a sufficiently =
decorative form, although=20

not in the carefully considered patterns of those artists with whom the dec=
orative instinct is=20

supreme.  Observe, for example, the painting entitled "Sea Idyl." Two child=
ren are stretched on the=20

beach, their bright bodies wet and glistening and casting blue shadows on t=
he sands. They are=20

lying so close to the water's edge that the waves lap over them, the boy's =
skin shines like polished=20

marble under the wet film just passing across it, and the girl's drenched g=
arments cling with sharp=20

chiseled folds to the form beneath like the draperies of some young Greek g=
oddess just risen from=20

the sea. The insolence of laughing eyes, the idle fumbling of young hands i=
n the wet sand, the=20

tingling life in the clean-cut limbs, the buoyancy of the waves that lift t=
hem slightly and hold them=20

above the earth,--all are seen with unwearied eyes, and reproduced with ene=
rgy.  The=20

management of the pigment in this picture as in many of the others can be c=
alled neither learned=20

nor subtle. Apparently the artist had in mind two intentions, the one to re=
present motion, the other=20

to represent light, and he set about his task in the simplest way possible,=
 with such simplicity,=20

indeed, that the extraordinary character of the result would easily be miss=
ed by a pedant. It has=20

not been missed by the public, who have entered with enthusiasm into the pa=
inter's mood,=20

perceived the originality of his vision and the joyousness of his art, and =
have radiated their own=20

appreciation of this vitalized, healthful world of happy people until they =
have increased the distrust=20

of the pedant for an art so helplessly popular.  [Illustration: In the Metr=
opolitan Museum of Art.=20

THE BATH--JAVEA  _From a painting by Sorolla_]  The distrust is not unnatur=
al. To follow the=20

popular taste would lead us into strange errors in our judgments of art, an=
d only rarely would=20

produce a predilection capable of lasting over a generation. How is it, the=
n, that we fearlessly may=20

range ourselves on the side of the public in admiration of Sorolla's art? B=
ecause the painter has=20

cast off the slavery of the conventional vision. He sees for himself, the r=
arest of gifts, and thus can=20

well afford to paint like others. He spends, apparently, but little thought=
 upon his execution, letting=20

it flow easily according to his instinct for the appropriate. It is not a s=
afe example to follow for=20

painters who do not see with unusual directness. Often in searching out ref=
inements of execution=20

 officiousness resulted in giving=20

both to Anderson and to the Confederate authorities an impression that Sumt=
er would surely be=20

evacuated; hence Beauregard, March 26th, wrote to Anderson offering facilit=
ies for removal, but=20

asking his word of honor that the fort would be left without any preparatio=
n for its destruction or=20

injury. This demand deeply wounded Anderson, and he resented it in a letter=
 of the same date,=20

saying, =E2=80=9CIf I can only be permitted to leave on the pledge you ment=
ion, I shall never, so help me=20

God, leave this fort alive.=E2=80=9D[173] Beauregard hastened to state that=
 he had only alluded to the=20

=E2=80=9Cpledge=E2=80=9D on account of the =E2=80=9Chigh source=E2=80=9D fr=
om which the rumors appeared to come, and made a=20

full amend, which re-established their usual relations.  Anderson had infor=
med Fox that, by placing=20

the command on a short allowance, he could make the provisions last until a=
fter April 10th; but not=20

receiving instructions from the War Department that it was desirable to do =
so, it had not been=20

done.[174] He had already reported, March 31st, that his last barrel of flo=
ur had been issued two=20

days before.[175]  Anderson=E2=80=99s little command, as he explained to Wa=
shington April 1st, would now=20



face starvation should the daily supply of fresh meat and vegetables, still=
 allowed from Charleston,=20

be cut off. Being in daily expectation, since the return of Colonel Lamon t=
o Washington, of=20

receiving orders to vacate the post, he had, to the great disadvantage of t=
he food supply, kept the=20

engineer laborers as long as he could. He now asked permission to send them=
 from Sumter; but=20

the request, referred to Montgomery April 2d by Beauregard, was refused, un=
less all the garrison=20

should go.[176]  April 1st an ice-laden schooner bound for Savannah entered=
 Charleston harbor=20

by mistake, and was fired upon by a Morris Island battery. Again the Sumter=
 batteries were=20

manned and a consultation held, at which five of the eight officers declare=
d in favor of opening fire,=20

but no action was taken by Anderson beyond sending an officer to the offend=
ing battery, from=20

which word was returned by its commanding officer that he was simply carryi=
ng out his orders to=20

fire upon any vessel carrying the United States colors which attempted to e=
nter.  On April 4th=20

Anderson assembled his officers, and for the first time made known to them =
the orders of January=20

10th and February 23d, directing him to act strictly on the defensive. As L=
ieutenant Talbot had just=20

been promoted captain and ordered to Washington, Anderson determined to sen=
d by him his=20

despatches. In order to arrange for his departure, Talbot, April 4th, accom=
panied Lieutenant=20

Snyder, under a white flag, to call the attention of the governor to the fa=
ct that the schooner fired=20

upon had not been warned by one of their own vessels, as had been arranged.=
 It developed that=20

the guard-vessel on duty had come in on account of=20


_
with greater distinction than would be possible at first sight. But Sorolla=
's prompt selective vision=20

flies to its goal like a bee to a honey-bearing flower. He takes what he wa=
nts and leaves the rest=20

with the dew still on it. His forces are neither scattered nor spent. His f=
reshness is overmastering,=20

and with our eyes on his creations we have that curious sense of possessing=
 youth and health and=20

freedom which we get sometimes from the sight of boys at their games. We ar=
e cheated into=20

forgetfulness of the world's great age and our own lassitudes and physical =
ineffectiveness. This=20

illusion is agreeable to the most of us, hence our unreserved liking for So=
rolla's art which produces=20

it.  The art of Ignacio Zuloaga, on the contrary, produces the opposite imp=
ression of complete=20

sophistication. In place of adolescent exultations and ebullient physical a=
ctivities, we find in it the=20

strange sorceries of a guileful civilization. There are smiling women with =
narrowed eyelids and=20

powdered faces, old men practising dolorous rejuvenations, laughter that co=
nceals more than it=20

expresses, motions that are as calculated as those of the dance, serpentine=
 forms, fervid=20

passions, and underneath the sophistries a violent primeval temper. In spit=
e of the flowerlike=20

gaiety of the color in rich costumes, the glint of silver, the sweet cool b=
lues, the pale violets, in the=20

painter's versions of the typical toreador of Spain the types are bold, cru=
el, and sullen. In spite of=20

the fragility and elegance of the women on balconies under soft laces the p=
revailing note is that of=20

undisciplined ferocity of emotion. This too is Spain, but not the Spain of =
the beach and sea life.=20

The rather numerous examples of what Mr. Christian Brinton has called Zuloa=
ga's "growing=20

diabolic tendency" make it clear that his art holds no place for spontaneit=
y and the innocence due=20

to ignorance, but where he keeps to Spanish subjects his work remains healt=
hy. There is the=20

picture entitled "The Sorceresses of San Milan" in which three old women ar=
e seen against a=20

dramatic landscape. These haggard jests of nature bring before us a Spain f=
rom which the=20

American finds it impossible not to shrink with horror, but they are rich i=
n was consequently=20

dismissed. The request to allow Talbot to proceed brought out the fact that=
 orders had been=20

received from Montgomery not to allow any portion of the garrison to leave =
the fort unless all=20

should go[177]--which, however, Beauregard construed, for the benefit of Ta=
lbot, to apply more=20

particularly to laborers and enlisted men[178]--and also that the following=
 telegram from=20

Commissioner Crawford had reached Charleston April 1st: =E2=80=9CI am autho=
rized to say that this=20

government will not undertake to supply Sumter without notice to you. My op=
inion is that the=20

President has not the courage to execute the order agreed upon in Cabinet f=
or the evacuation of=20

the fort, but that he intends to shift the responsibility upon Major Anders=
on by suffering him to be=20

starved out. Would it not be well to aid in this by cutting off all supplie=
s?=E2=80=9D[179] Beauregard had, the=20

same day, sent the message to the Confederate Secretary of War, with the re=
mark, =E2=80=9CBatteries=20
