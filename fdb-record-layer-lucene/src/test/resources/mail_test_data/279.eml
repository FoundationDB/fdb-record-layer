a great difference in their notes, and the cups can no longer be equal in w=

the same all-embracing heaven, yet in some of them, on account of the heat =
in their country, the voice strikes the air on a high note, were his predec=
essors he has inherited many legends of University life, has added to that =
wealth much of his own gained during his time of service, and if you care t=
o hear he will tell you many long and intimate stories. He can tell one abo=
ut extraordinary sages who knew _everything_, about remarkable students who=
 did not sleep for weeks, about numerous _
on with lands and countries of other characteristics. This is because one p=
art of the earth is=20

directly under the sun's course, another is far away from it, while another=
 lies midway between=20

these two. Hence, as the position of the heaven with regard to a given trac=
t on the earth leads=20

naturally to different characteristics, owing to the inclination of the cir=
cle of the zodiac and the=20

course of the sun, it is obvious that designs for houses ought similarly to=
 conform to the nature of=20

the country and to diversities of climate.  2. In the north, houses should =
be entirely roofed over and=20

sheltered as much as possible, not in the open, though having a warm exposu=
re. But on the other=20

hand, where the force of the sun is great in the southern countries that su=
ffer from heat, houses=20

must be built more in the open and with a northern or north-eastern exposur=
e. Thus we may=20

amend by art what nature, if left to herself, would mar. In other situation=
s, also, we must make=20

modifications to correspond to the position of the heaven and its effects o=
n climate.  3. These=20

effects are noticeable and discernible not only in things in nature, but th=
ey also are observable in=20

the limbs and bodies of entire races. In places on which the sun throws out=
 its heat in moderation,=20

it keeps human bodies in their proper condition, and where its path is very=
 close at hand, it=20

parches them up, and burns out and takes away the proportion of moisture wh=
ich they ought to=20

possess. But, on the other hand, in the cold regions that are far away from=
 the south, the moisture=20

is not drawn out by hot weather, but the atmosphere is full of dampness whi=
ch diffuses moisture=20

into the system, and makes the frame larger and the pitch of the voice deep=
er. This is also the=20

reason why the races that are bred in the north are of vast height, and hav=
e fair complexions,=20

straight red hair, grey eyes, and a great deal of blood, owing to the abund=
ance of moisture and the=20

coolness of the atmosphere.  4. On the contrary, those that are nearest to =
the southern half of the=20

axis, and that lie directly under the sun's course, are of lower stature, w=
ith a swarthy complexion,=20

hair curling, black eyes, strong legs, and but little blood on account of t=
he force of the sun. Hence,=20

too, this poverty of blood makes them over-timid to stand up against the sw=
ord, but great heat and=20

fevers they can endure without timidity, because their frames are forehead =
with her lips I start as=20

though a bee had stung me on the head, give a forced smile, and turn my fac=
e away. Ever since I=20

have been suffering from sleeplessness, a question sticks in my brain like =
a nail. My daughter=20

often sees me, an old man and a distinguished man, blush painfully at being=
 in debt to my=20

footman; she sees how often anxiety over petty debts forces me to lay aside=
 my work and to walk=20

up and down the room for hours together, thinking; but why is it she never =
comes to me in secret=20

to whisper in my ear: "Father, here is my watch, here are my bracelets, my =
earrings, my=20

dresses.... Pawn them all; you want money..."? How is it that, seeing how h=
er mother and I are=20

placed in a false position and do our utmost to hide our poverty from peopl=
e, she does not give up=20

her expensive pleasure of music lessons? I would not accept her watch nor h=
er bracelets, nor the=20

sacrifice of her lessons--God forbid! That isn't what I want.  I think at t=
he same time of my son, the=20

officer at Warsaw. He is a clever, honest, and sober fellow. But that is no=
t enough for me. I think if=20

I had an old father, and if I knew there were moments when he was put to sh=
ame by his poverty, I=20

should give up my officer's commission to somebody else, and should go out =
to earn my living as=20

a workman. Such thoughts about my children poison me. What is the use of th=
em? It is only a=20

narrow-minded or embittered man who can harbour evil thoughts about ordinar=
y people because=20

they are not heroes. But enough of that!  At a quarter to ten I have to go =
and give a lecture to my=20

dear boys. I dress and walk along the road which I have known for thirty ye=
ars, and which has its=20



history for me. Here is the big grey house with the chemist's shop; at this=
 point there used to stand=20

a little house, and in it was a beershop; in that beershop I thought out my=
 thesis and wrote my first=20

love-letter to Varya. I wrote it in pencil, on a page headed "Historia morb=
i." Here there is a grocer's=20

shop; at one time it was kept by a little Jew, who sold me cigarettes on cr=
edit; then by a fat=20

peasant woman, who liked the students because "every one of them has a moth=
er"; now there is a=20

red-haired shopkeeper sitting in it, a very stolid man who drinks tea from =
a copper teapot. And=20

here are the gloomy gates of the University, which have long needed doing u=
p; I see the bored=20

porter in his sheep-skin, the broom, the drifts of snow....=20


_
born in the north are rendered over-timid and weak by fever, but their weal=
th of blood enables=20

them to stand up against the sword without timidity.  [Illustration]  5. Th=
e pitch of the voice is=20

likewise different and varying in quality with different nations, for the f=
ollowing reasons. The=20

terminating points east and west on the level of the earth, where the upper=
 and lower parts of the=20

heaven are divided, seem to lie in a naturally balanced circle which mathem=
aticians call the=20

Horizon. Keeping this idea definitely in mind, if we imagine a line drawn f=
rom the northern side of=20

the circumference (N) to the side which lies above the southern half of the=
 axis (S), and from here=20

another line obliquely up to the pivot at the summit, beyond the stars comp=
osing the Great Bear=20

(the pole star P), we shall doubtless see that we have in the heaven a tria=
ngular figure like that of=20

the musical instrument which the Greeks call the "sambuca."  6. And so, und=
er the space which is=20

nearest to the pivot at the bottom, off the southern portions of the line o=
f the axis, are found=20

nations that on account of the slight altitude of the fresh from the provin=
ces and imagining that the=20

temple of science must really be a temple, such gates cannot make a healthy=
 impression.=20

Altogether the dilapidated condition of the University buildings, the gloom=
iness of the corridors, the=20

griminess of the walls, the lack of light, the dejected aspect of the steps=
, the hat-stands and the=20

benches, take a prominent position among predisposing causes in the history=
 of Russian=20

pessimism.... Here is our garden... I fancy it has grown neither better nor=
 worse since I was a=20

student. I don't like it. It would be far more sensible if there were tall =
pines and fine oaks growing=20

here instead of sickly-looking lime-trees, yellow acacias, and skimpy polla=
rd lilacs. The student=20

whose state of mind is in the majority of cases created by his surroundings=
, ought in the place=20

where he is studying to see facing him at every turn nothing but what is lo=
fty, strong and elegant....=20

God preserve him from gaunt trees, broken windows, grey walls, and doors co=
vered with torn=20

American leather!  When I go to my own entrance the door is flung wide open=
, and I am met by my=20

colleague,=20


_
shrill and very high-pitched voices, like the string nearest to the angle i=
n the musical instrument.=20

Next in order come other nations as far as the middle of Greece, with lower=
 elevations of the=20

voice; and from this middle point they go on in regular order up to the ext=
reme north, where, under=20

high altitudes, the vocal utterance of the inhabitants is, under natural la=
ws, produced in heavier=20

tones. Thus it is obvious that the system of the universe as a whole is, on=
 account of the=20

inclination of the heaven, composed in a most perfect harmony through the t=
emporary power of=20

the sun.  7. The nations, therefore, that lie midway between the pivots at =
the southern and the=20

northern extremities of the axis, converse in a voice of middle pitch, like=
 the notes in the middle of=20

a lets me in he clears his throat and says:  "A frost, your Excellency!"  O=
r, if my great-coat is wet:=20

"Rain, your Excellency!"  Then he runs on ahead of me and opens all the doo=
rs on my way. In my=20

study he carefully takes off my fur coat, and while doing so manages to tel=
l me some bit of=20

University news. Thanks to the close intimacy existing between all the Univ=
ersity porters and=20

beadles, he knows everything that goes on in the four faculties, in the off=
ice, in the rector's private=20

room, in the library. What does he not know? When in an evil day a rector o=
r dean, for instance,=20

retires, I hear him in conversation with the young porters mention the cand=
idates for the post,=20

explain that such a one would not be confirmed by the minister, that anothe=
r would himself refuse=20

to=20


_
as we proceed towards the north, the distances to the heaven become greater=
, and so the nations=20

there, whose vocal utterance is reduced by the moisture to the "hypates" an=
d to=20

"proslambanomenon," are naturally obliged to speak in heavier tones. In the=
 same way, as we=20

proceed from the middle point to the south, the voices of the nations there=
 correspond in extreme=20

height of pitch and in shrillness to the "paranetes" and "netes."  8. That =
it is a fact that things are=20

made heavier from being in places naturally moist, and higher pitched from =
places that are hot,=20

may be proved from the following experiment. Take two cups which have been =
baked in the same=20

oven for an equal time, which are of equal weight, and details concerning m=
ysterious papers=20

received in the office, secret conversations alleged to have taken place be=
tween the minister and=20

the trustee, and so on. With the exception of these details, he almost alwa=
ys turns out to be right.=20

His estimates of the candidates, though original, are very correct, too. If=
 one wants to know in what=20

year some one read his thesis, entered the service, retired, or died, then =
summon to your=20

assistance the vast memory of that soldier, and he will not only tell you t=
he year, the month and=20

the day, but will furnish you also with the details that accompanied this o=
r that event. Only one who=20

loves can remember like that.  He is the guardian of the University traditi=
ons. From the=20
