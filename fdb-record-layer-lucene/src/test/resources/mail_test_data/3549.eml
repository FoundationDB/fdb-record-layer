"They're a mixed race, with a good deal of the Spaniard in them," explained=
 Miss Morley. "We=20

must make certain allowances for their southern temperaments and customs. T=
hey're very poor,=20

and they look upon American and British tourists as made of money, and ther=
efore fair game to=20

state of gelatine. The coagulum of the papaw-tree, when newly prepared, bei=
ng thrown into water,=20

softens, dissolves in part, and gives a yellowish tint to the fluid. The mi=
lk, placed in contact with=20

water only, forms also membranes. In an instant a tremulous jelly is precip=
itated, resembling=20

starch. This phenomenon is particularly striking if the water employed be=
=20


_
lose your temper however excited they may get. When you've lived here for a=
 time you learn how=20

to treat them."  By this time they had reached the bottom of the funicular,=
 and were back in the=20

little station near the observatory. A picturesque woman, with a yellow sha=
wl round her shoulders,=20

and long gold earrings in her ears, came hurrying up to sell post-cards, an=
d offered to show the=20

party the quickest way into the hotel. As every one was very tired and hung=
ry Miss Morley=20

succumbed to the voice of this siren, and permitted her to escort them by w=
hat she assured them=20

would be a short cut and would save many steps. But alas for Italian veraci=
ty! Their suave and=20

smiling guide led them down a path at the back of the hotel to a shabby and=
 dirty little restaurant of=20

her own, where she vehemently assured them she would provide them with a fa=
r cheaper meal,=20

an offer which, at the sight of the crumby table-cloth, they resolutely ref=
used.  "The old humbug! I'd=20

no idea she was decoying us away from the hotel. Really nobody can be trust=
ed up here," fumed=20

Miss Morley. "Come along, girls. I told the conductor to reserve a table fo=
r us, and there won't be=20

time to have lunch before the train starts unless we're quick."  So they al=
l hurried back again up=20

the path--much to the chagrin of the siren--and found their own way into th=
e hotel, where seats=20

had been kept for them in the restaurant, and dishes of macaroni and vegeta=
bles and cups of hot=20

coffee were in readiness.  The great jelly condenses in proportion as more =
water is poured upon it.=20

It preserves a long time its whiteness, only growing yellow by the contact =
of a few drops of nitric=20

acid. Guided by the experiments of Fourcroy and Vauquelin on the juice of t=
he hevea, I mixed a=20

solution of carbonate of soda with the milk of the papaw. No clot is formed=
, even when pure water=20

is poured on a mixture of the milk with the alkaline solution. The membrane=
s appear only when, by=20

adding an acid, the soda is neutralized, and the acid is in excess. I made =
the coagulum formed by=20

nitric acid, the juice of lemons, or hot water, likewise disappear by mixin=
g it with carbonate of soda.=20

The sap again becomes milky and liquid, as in its primitive state; but this=
 experiment succeeds=20

only when the coagulum has been recently formed.  On comparing the milky ju=
ices of the papaw,=20

the cow-tree, and the hevea, there appears a striking analogy between the j=
uices which abound in=20

caseous matter, and those in which caoutchouc prevails. All the white and n=
ewly prepared=20

caoutchouc, as well as the waterproof cloaks, manufactured in Spanish Ameri=
ca by placing a layer=20

of milk of hevea between two pieces of cloth, exhale an animal and nauseati=
ng smell. This seems=20

to indicate that the caoutchouc, in coagulating, carries with it the caseum=
, which is perhaps only=20

an altered albumen.  The produce of the bread-fruit tree can no more be con=
sidered as bread than=20

plantains before the state of maturity, or the tuberous and amylaceous=20


_
post-cards at the hotel these could be stamped by the conductor of the trai=
n with the Vesuvius=20

postmark, and posted in a special pillar-box at the station. The idea of se=
nding cards to their=20

friends actually from the volcano itself was most fascinating, and they scr=
ibbled away till the last=20

available moment.  "I guess some homes in America will be startled when the=
y see these," purred=20

Peachy, addressing flaming representations of an eruption. "It ought just t=
o make Nell Condy's=20

eyes pop out."  "I'm only afraid they won't believe we've really been," sig=
hed Delia, skeptically.=20

"They'll have to, with the Vesuvius batatas, and the potato. The milk of th=
e cow-tree contains, on=20

the contrary, a caseous matter, like the milk of mammiferous animals. Advan=
cing to more general=20

considerations, we may regard, with M. Gay-Lussac, the caoutchouc as the oi=
ly part--the butter of=20

vegetable milk. We find in the milk of plants caseum and caoutchouc; in the=
 milk of animals,=20

caseum and butter. The proportions of the two albuminous and oily principle=
s differ in the various=20

species of animals and of lactescent plants. In these last they are most fr=
equently mixed with other=20

substances hurtful as food; but of which the separation might perhaps be=20
