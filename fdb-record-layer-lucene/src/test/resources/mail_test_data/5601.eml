land, filled with warlike impedimenta, and devoted exclusively to the scien=

we should have been sitting in our offices in Wichita and Emporia editing t=
wo country newspapers,=20

wrangling mildly with the pirates of the paper mills to whom our miserable =
little forty or fifty=20

carloads of white paper a year was a trifle, dickering with foreign adverti=
sers who desired to=20

spread before Wichita and Emporia the virtues of their chewing gum or talki=
ng machines, or=20

discussing the ever changing Situation with the local statesmen. At five o'=
clock Henry should be=20

on his way to the Wichita golf course to reduce his figure, and the sullen =
roar of the muffler cut-out=20

on the family car should be warning me that we were going to picnic that ni=
ght out on the Osage=20

hills in the sunset, where it would be up to me to eat gluten bread and avo=
id sugars, starches and=20

fats to preserve the girlish lines of my figure.  But instead, here we were=
 puffing up a hill in France,=20

through underbrush, across shell holes to a hidden trench choked with telep=
hone cables that=20

should lead underground to an observation post where a part of the staff of=
 the French army sat=20

overlooking the battle of the Champagne. As we puffed and huffed up the hil=
l, we recalled to each=20

other that we had been in our offices but a few weeks before when the Assoc=
iated Press report=20

had brought us the news of the Champagne drive for hill 208. Among other th=
ings the report had=20

declared "a number of French soldiers were ordered into their own barrage, =
and several were shot=20

for refusing to go into action thereafter!" And now here we were looking th=
rough a peep-hole in the=20

military are in greater numbers on the banks of the Rio Negro than on those=
 of the Orinoco, owing=20

to the necessity of guarding the frontiers; and wherever soldiers and monks=
 dispute for power over=20

the Indians, the latter are most attached to the monks. Two young women cam=
e down from their=20

hammocks, to prepare for us cakes of cassava. In answer to some enquiries w=
hich we put to them=20

through an interpreter, they answered that cassava grew poorly on the islan=
d, but that it was a=20

good land for ants, and food was not wanting. In fact, these vachacos furni=
sh subsistence to the=20

Indians of the Rio Negro and the Guainia. They do not eat the ants as a lux=
ury, but because,=20

according to the expression of the missionaries, the fat of ants (the white=
 part of the abdomen) is a=20

very substantial food. When the cakes of cassava were prepared, Father Zea,=
 whose fever=20

seemed rather to sharpen than to enfeeble his appetite, ordered a little ba=
g to be brought to him=20

filled with smoked vachacos. He mixed these bruised insects with flour of c=
assava, which he=20

pressed us to taste. It somewhat resembled rancid butter mixed with crumb o=
f bread. The cassava=20

had not an acid taste, but some remains of European prejudices prevented ou=
r joining in the=20

praises bestowed by the good missionary on what he called an excellent ant =
paste.  The violence=20

of the rain obliged us to sleep in this crowded hut. The Indians slept only=
 from eight till two in the=20

morning; the rest of the time they employed in conversing in their hammocks=
, and preparing their=20

bitter beverage of cupana. They threw fresh fuel on the fire, and complaine=
d of cold, although the=20

temperature of the air was at=20


_
up the hill; below us lay a weedy piece of bottom land, all kneaded and poc=
k-marked by shells,=20

stretching away to another range of hills perhaps five miles, perhaps ten m=
iles away, as the valley=20

widened or narrowed. The white clay of the soil erupting under shell fire g=
limmered nakedly and=20

indecently through the weeds. It was hard to realize that three years befor=
e the valley before us=20

had been one of the great fertile valleys of France, dotted with little gre=
y towns with glowing red=20

roofs. For as we looked it seemed to be "that ominous tract, which all agre=
e hides the Dark=20

Tower!" There it all lay; the "ragged thistle stalk," with its head chopped=
 off; "the dock's harsh=20

swart leaves bruised as to balk all hope of greenness." "As for the grass, =
it grew scantier than hair=20

in leprosy; thin dry leaves pricked the mud, which underneath looked kneade=
d up with blood!" It=20

was the self-same field that Roland crossed! In the midst of the waste zigz=
agged two lines--two=20

white gashes in the soil, with a scab of horrible brown rust scratched betw=
een them--the French=20

and German trenches and the barbed wire entanglements. At some places the t=
renches ran close=20

together, a few hundred feet or a few hundred yards marked their distance a=
part. At other times=20

they backed fearfully away from one another with the gashed, stark, weed-sm=
eared earth gaping=20

between them. We paused to rest in our climb at a little shrine by the ways=
ide. A communication=20

trench slipped deviously up to it, and through this trench were brought the=
 wounded; for the shrine,=20

a dugout in the hillside, had been converted into a first aid station. A do=
ctor and two stretcher=20

bearers and two ambulance men were waiting there. Yet the little shrine, ra=
ther than the trenches=20

that crept up to it, dominated the scene and the war seemed far away. Occas=
ionally we heard a=20

distant boom and saw a tan cone of dirt rise in the bottom land among the t=
renches, and we felt=20

that some poor creature might be in his death agony. But that was remote, t=
oo, and Major Murphy=20

of our party climbed to the roof of the dugout and began turning his glasse=
s toward the German=20

lines. Then the trenches about us suddenly grew alive. The Frenchmen were w=
aving their hands=20

and running about excitedly. Major Murphy was a Major--a regular United Sta=
tes Army major in a=20

regular United States army uniform so grand that compared with our cheap co=
tton khaki it looked=20

like a five thousand dollar outfit. The highest officer near us was a Frenc=
h second-lieutenant, who=20

had no right to boss a Major! But something had to be done. So the second l=
ieutenant did it. He=20

called down the Major; showed him that he was in direct range of the German=
 guns, and made it=20

clear that a big six-foot American in uniform standing silhouetted against =
the sky-line would bring=20

down a whole wagon-load of German hardware on our part of the line. The fac=
t that the German=20

trenches were two miles away did not make the situation any less dangerous.=
 Afterwards we left=20

the shrine and the trenches and went on up the hill.  [Illustration: One of=
 our party climbed to the=20

roof of the dugout and began turning his glasses toward the German lines]  =
The view from the=20

observation trench on the hill-top, when we finally got there, was a wonder=
ful view, sweeping the=20

whole Champagne battle field. Hill 208 lay in the distance, still in German=
 hands, and before it,=20

wallowing in the white earth were a number of English tanks abandoned by th=
e French. Lying out=20

there in No Man's Land between the trenches, the tanks looked to our Kansas=
 eyes like worn out=20

threshing machines and spelled more clearly than anything else in the lands=
cape the extent of the=20

French failure in the Champagne drive of the spring of 1917. It may be prof=
itable to know just how=20

far the pendulum of war had swung toward failure in France last spring, bef=
ore America declared=20

war. To begin: The French morale went bad! We heard here in America that Fr=
ance was bled=20

white. The French commission told us how sorely France needed the American =
war declaration.=20



But to say that the morale of a nation has gone bad means so much. It is al=
ways a struggle even=20

in peace, even in prosperity, for the honest, courageous leadership of a na=
tion to keep any Nation=20

honest. But when hope begins to sag, when the forces of disorder and darkne=
ss that lie subdued=20

and dormant in every nation, and in every human heart are bidden by evil ti=
mes to rise--they rise.=20

Leadership fails in its battle against them. For a year after the morale of=
 the French began to come=20

back strong, the French newspapers and French government were busy exposing=
 and punishing=20

the creatures who shamed France in the spring of 1917. German money has bee=
n traced to=20

persons high in authority. A network of German spies was uncovered, working=
 with the mistresses=20

of men high in government--the kaiser is not above using the thief and the =
harlot for his aims;=20

money literally by the cartload was poured into certain departments to hind=
er the work of the army,=20

and the tragic disaster of the Champagne drive was the result partly of int=
rigue in Paris in the=20

government, partly of poverty, partly the result of three winters of terrib=
le suffering in the nation,=20

and partly the weakening under the strain of all these things, of this "too=
 too solid flesh and blood."=20

During the winter of 1916-17 soldiers at the front received letters from ho=
me telling of starvation=20

and freezing and sickness in their families. And trench conditions in the l=
ong hard winter were all=20

but unbearable. When a soldier finally got a leave of absence and started h=
ome, he found the=20

railroad system breaking down and he had long waits at junction points with=
 no sleeping quarters,=20

no food, no shelter. French soldiers going home on leave would lie all nigh=
t and all day out in the=20

open, drenched by the rain and stained by the mud, and would reach home bri=
nging to their=20

families trench vermin and trench fever and trench misery untold, to add to=
 the woe that the winter=20

had brought to the home while the soldier was away. Then when he went back =
to fight, he found=20

that a bureaucratic clash had left the soldiers without supplies, or food o=
r ammunition in sufficient=20

quantities to supply the battle needs. In the bureaucratic clash some one l=
ost his head in the army=20

and ordered the men into their own barrage. Hundreds were slaughtered. Thou=
sands were verging=20

on mutiny. A regiment refused to fight, and another threatened to disobey. =
The American=20

ambulance boys told us that the most horrible task they did was when they h=
auled eighty poor=20

French boys out to be shot for mutiny! Spies in Paris, working through the =
mistresses of the=20

department heads, the sad strain of war upon the French economic resources,=
 and the withering=20

hand of winter upon the heart of degrees. This custom of being awake, and e=
ven on foot, four or=20

five hours before sunrise, is general among the Indians of Guiana. When, in=
 the entradas, an=20

attempt is made to surprise the natives, the hours chosen are those of the =
first sleep, from nine till=20

midnight.  We left the island of Dapa long before daybreak; and notwithstan=
ding the rapidity of the=20

current, and the activity of our rowers, our passage to the fort of San Car=
los del Rio Negro=20

occupied twelve hours. We passed, on the left, the mouth of the Cassiquiare=
, and, on the right, the=20

small island of Cumarai. The fort is believed in the country to be on the e=
quatorial line; but,=20

according to the observations which I made at the rocks of Culimacari, it i=
s in 1 degree 54 minutes=20

11 seconds.  We lodged at San Carlos with the commander of the fort, a lieu=
tenant of militia. From=20

a gallery in the upper part of the house we enjoyed a delightful view of th=
ree islands of great=20

length, and covered with thick vegetation. The river runs in a straight lin=
e from north to south, as if=20

its bed had been dug by the hand of man. The sky being constantly cloudy gi=
ves these countries a=20

solemn and gloomy character. We found in the village a few juvia-trees whic=
h furnish the triangular=20

nuts called in Europe the almonds of the Amazon, or Brazil-nuts. We have ma=
de it known by the=20



name of Bertholletia excelsa. The trees attain after eight years' growth th=
e height of thirty feet.=20

The military establishment of this frontier consisted of seventeen soldiers=
, ten of whom were=20

detached for the security of the neighbouring missions. Owing to the extrem=
e humidity of the air=20

there are not four muskets in a condition to be fired. The Portuguese have =
from twenty-five to thirty=20

men, better clothed and armed, at the little fort of San Jose de Maravitano=
s. We found in the=20

mission of San Carlos but one garita,* a square house, constructed with unb=
aked bricks, and=20

containing six field-pieces. (* This word literally signifies a sentry-box;=
 but it is here employed in=20

the sense of store-house or arsenal.) The little fort, or, as they think pr=
oper to call it here, the=20

Castillo de San Felipe, is situated opposite San Carlos, on the western ban=
k of the Rio Negro.=20

The banks of the Upper Guainia will be more productive when, by the destruc=
tion of the forests,=20

the excessive humidity of the air and the soil shall be diminished. In thei=
r present state of culture=20

maize scarcely grows, and the tobacco, which is of the finest quality, and =
much celebrated on the=20

coast of Caracas, is well cultivated only on spots amid old ruins, remains =
of the huts of the pueblo=20

viejo (old town). Indigo grows wild near the villages of Maroa, Davipe, and=
 Tomo. Under a different=20

system from that which we found existing in these countries, the Rio Negro =
will produce indigo,=20

coffee, cacao, maize, and rice, in abundance.  The passage from the mouth o=
f the Rio Negro to=20

Grand Para occupying only twenty or twenty-five days, it would not have tak=
en us much more time=20

to have gone down the Amazon as far as the coast of Brazil, than to return =
by the Cassiquiare and=20

the Orinoco to the northern coast of Caracas. We were informed at San Carlo=
s that, on account of=20

political circumstances, it was difficult at that moment to pass from the S=
panish to the Portuguese=20

settlements; but we did not know till after our return to Europe the extent=
 of the danger to which we=20

should have been exposed in proceeding as far as Barcellos. It was known at=
 Brazil, possibly=20

through the medium of the newspapers, that I was going to visit the mission=
s of the Rio Negro,=20

and examine the natural canal which unites two great systems of rivers. In =
those desert forests=20

instruments had been seen only in the hands of the commissioners of the bou=
ndaries; and at that=20

time the subaltern agents of the Portuguese government could not conceive h=
ow a man of sense=20

could expose himself to the fatigues of a long journey, to measure lands th=
at did not belong to him.=20

Orders had been issued to seize my person, my instruments, and, above all, =
those registers of=20

astronomical observations, so dangerous to the safety of states. We were to=
 be conducted by way=20

of the Amazon to Grand Para, and thence sent back to Lisbon. But fortunatel=
y for me, the=20

government at Lisbon, on being informed of the zeal of its subaltern agents=
, instantly gave orders=20

that I should not be disturbed in my operations; but that on the contrary t=
hey should be=20

encouraged, if I traversed any part of the Portuguese possessions.  In goin=
g down the Guainia, or=20

Rio Negro, you pass on the right the Cano Maliapo, and on the left the Cano=
s Dariba and Eny. At=20

five leagues distance, nearly in 1 degree 38 minutes of north latitude, is =
the island of San Josef. A=20

little below that island, in a spot where there are a great number of orang=
e-trees now growing wild,=20

the traveller is shown a small rock, two hundred feet high, with a cavern c=
alled by the missionaries=20

the Glorieta de Cocuy. This summer-house (for such is the signification of =
the word glorieta in=20

Spanish) recalls remembrances that are not the most agreeable. It was here =
that Cocuy, the chief=20

of the Manitivitanos,* had his harem of women, and where he devoured the fi=
nest and fattest. (* At=20

San Carlos there is still preserved an instrument of music, a kind of large=
 drum, ornamented with=20

very rude Indian paintings, which relate to the exploits of Cocuy.) The tra=
dition of the harem and=20



the orgies of Cocuy is more current in the Lower Orinoco than on the banks =
of the Guainia. At San=20

Carlos the very idea that the chief of the Manitivitanos could be guilty of=
 cannibalism is indignantly=20

rejected.  The Portuguese government has established many settlements even =
in this remote part=20

of Brazil. Below the Glorieta, in the Portuguese territory, there are eleve=
n villages in an extent of=20

twenty-five leagues. I know of nineteen more as far as the mouth of the Rio=
 Negro, beside the six=20

towns of Thomare, Moreira (near the Rio Demenene, or Uaraca, where dwelt an=
ciently the Guiana=20

Indians), Barcellos, San Miguel del Rio Branco, near the river of the same =
name (so well known in=20

the fictions of El Dorado), Moura, and Villa de Rio Negro. The banks of thi=
s tributary stream of the=20

Amazon alone are consequently ten times more thickly peopled than all the s=
hores of the Upper=20

and Lower Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, and the Spanish Rio Negro.=
  Among the=20

tributary streams which the Rio Negro receives from the north, three are pa=
rticularly deserving of=20

attention, because on account of their branchings, their portages, and the =
situation of their=20

sources, they are connected with the often-discussed problem of the origin =
of the Orinoco. The=20

most southern of these tributary streams are the Rio Branco,* which was lon=
g believed to issue=20


_
all but a victory for the forces of evil in this earth.  And there we were =
that summer day, when time=20

and events had changed the face of fate, looking out across the blighted fi=
eld of Champagne at=20

what might have been the wreck of France.  All is changed now. At every rai=
lroad junction the=20

American Red Cross has built cantonments, where beds and food and baths and=
 disinfecting=20

ovens for trench clothes are installed for the homeward bound soldiers of F=
rance. The American=20

Red Cross has the name of every French soldier's family that is in need, an=
d that family's needs=20

are being supplied by the American Red Cross. And the sure hope of victory =
has given the=20

leadership of France a mastery of the forces of evil in the lower levels of=
 the Nation's political=20

consciousness that will make it impossible for the kaiser's friends, the co=
urtesans, to accomplish=20

anything next winter.  We gazed across the field that afternoon and seeing =
the blotched acres,=20

weed blasted, shell-pocked, blistered with white trenches and scarred with =
long jagged barbed-

wire rents for miles and miles, and we thought how perfectly does the spiri=
t of man mark the=20

picture of his soul's agony upon his daily work.  It was late in the aftern=
oon when we left that=20

sector of the line. We passed a bombed hospital where two doctors and three=
 nurses had been=20

killed a night or two before. It was a disquieting sight, and the big Red C=
ross on the top of the=20

hospital showed that the German airmen who dropped the bombs were careful i=
n their aim.=20

Gradually as we left the Champagne front the booming guns grew fainter and =
fainter and finally we=20

could not hear them, and we came into a wide, beautiful plain and then turn=
ed into the city of=20

Rheims. It was bombed to death--but not to ruins. Rheims is what Verdun mus=
t have been during=20

the first year of the war, a phantom city, desolate, all but uninhabited, b=
roken and battered and=20

abandoned. Here and there, living in caves and cellars, a few citizens stil=
l stick to their homes. A=20

few stores remain open and an occasional trickle of commerce flows down the=
 streets. We went to=20

the cathedral and found its outlines there--a veritable Miss Havisham of a =
ruin, the pale spectre of=20

its former beauty, but proud and--if stone and iron can be conscious--vain =
of its lost glory. A gash=20

probably ten feet square has been gouged in the pavement by a German shell,=
 and the hole=20

uncovers a hidden passage to the Cathedral of which no one in this generati=
on knew. In the=20

hovering twilight we walked about, gazing in a sadness that the broken sple=
ndour of the place cast=20

upon us, at the details of the devastation. The roof, of course, is but a f=
ilm of wood and iron rent=20

with big holes. The walls are intact, but cracked and broken and tottering.=
 The Gothic spires and=20

gargoyles and ornaments are shattered beyond restoration, and the windows a=
re but staring blind=20

eyes where once the soul of the church gazed forth. Men come and gather the=
 broken bits of glass=20

as art treasures.  That evening at supper in Chalons, we met some American =
boys who said the=20

French were selling this glass from the windows of Rheims made from old bee=
r-bottles and blue=20

bottles and green bitters bottles, and still later we saw an English Colone=
l who had bought a job lot=20

of it and found a patent medicine trade mark blown in a piece!  We had been=
 in the place but a few=20

minutes, when we went to the back of the cathedral where we found an excite=
d old man on the=20

sidewalk with a broom in front of a postcard printing office. He spoke to H=
enry and me, but we=20

could not understand him. He pointed to the stone dust and spawl freshly dr=
opped on the sidewalk=20

and to a hole in the pavement, and then to a broken iron shell. It must hav=
e weighed twenty-five=20

pounds. He kept pointing at it, and made it clear we were to touch it. It w=
as still hot! It had dropped=20

in but a few minutes before we came. We went into his shop to stock up on p=
ost cards, and as=20

Major Murphy and Mr. Norton, who could talk French, learned that another sh=
ell would be due in=20



three or four minutes, we left town.  The road out of Rheims was in full vi=
ew of the German lines,=20

hidden only, and at that rather poorly, by camouflage--straw woven into mat=
s, and burlap, badly=20

torn. We were between the German guns five miles away, and the sunset. Grea=
t holes in the=20

ground beside the road indicated where they had been dropping shells, so ou=
r driver tramped on=20

the juice, the machine shot out at fifty miles an hour and we skedaddled.  =
From the road out of=20

Rheims we dropped into the valley of the Marne, a most beautiful vine-clad =
valley, where the road=20

turns sharply from the German lines and soon passes out of the German range=
 and the shell holes=20

at the side of the road disappear. But even shell holes would not have take=
n our eyes from the=20

beauty of that valley as we wound down into it from the hill. Vines were ev=
erywhere. Rows and=20

rows of vines, marking a thousand brownish green lines in the earth as far =
as the eye could see.=20

The grapes were ripe and they gave a tint of purple and brown to the landsc=
ape. It glowed with=20

colour. Half a score of little grey, red roofed towns dotted the checkered =
fields. The sun was=20

slanting through the plain. Tall dark poplars slashed it with sombre greens=
. As we whizzed through=20

the quaint little villages dashes of colour seemed doused in our faces; sol=
diers in horizon blue with=20

crimson trimmings and gold on their uniforms, black Moroccans with their ga=
udy red fezes, flags of=20

staff and line officers fluttering from doors and window sills, all refresh=
ed our eyes with new,=20

strange, gorgeous combinations of colours. And when we passed a town where =
no soldiers were=20

quartered, there the dooryards were brilliant with phlox and dahlias--even =
the door yards of those=20

poor wrecked villages deserted after the German bombardment--villages roofl=
ess and grey and=20

gaunt and wan, from which the population fled in July, 1914, and from which=
 the Germans=20

themselves a few weeks later were forced to flee, running pell-mell as they=
 scurried before the=20

wrath of the French soldiers.  As we went down into the valley of the Marne=
 where division after=20

division of the French army was quartered upon the population, thousands in=
 a village, where=20

normally hundreds were sheltered, we realized what social chaos must stalk =
in the train of war.=20

Every few weeks these soldiers go to the front and other soldiers come in. =
Fathers, husbands,=20

sweethearts of peace times are at the front or dead. The visiting soldiers =
come "from over the hills=20

and far away," but they are young, and the women are young and beautiful, a=
nd they live daily=20

with these women in their houses. Moreover, the emotions of France are tens=
e. Death, doubt, fear=20

and hope lash the home-staying hearts every day. And amid those raw emotion=
s comes the daily=20

and hourly call of the deepest emotion in the human heart. It comes honestl=
y. It comes inevitably.=20

And then, in a day or an hour, the lover is gone, and new faces appear in t=
he village, in the street,=20

in the home. Five millions of men during the last three years and a half ha=
ve passed and re-

passed, through those fifty miles or so back of the firing line in which so=
ldiers are quartered for=20

rest, where in times of peace less than a million men have lived. And the w=
omen are the same=20

honest, earnest, aspiring women that our wives and sisters are, and the men=
 are as chivalrous=20

and gentle and as kind.  For nearly an hour we had been going through these=
 villages crowded=20

with soldiers--kindly French soldiers who were clearly living happily with =
the people upon whom=20

they were billeted. Then Henry burst forth, "My good Heavens, man--what if =
this were in Wichita or=20

Emporia! What if your house and mine had ten or twenty fine soldiers in it,=
 and we were away and=20

our wives and daughters were there alone? Rio Branco, signifies White Water=
. Rio Parime is a=20

Caribbean name, signifying Great Water. These names having also been applie=
d to different=20

tributary streams, have caused many errors in geography. The great Rio Bran=
co, or Parime, often=20



mentioned in this work, is formed by the Urariquera and the Tacutu, and flo=
ws, between Carvoeyro=20

and Villa de Moura, into the Rio Negro. It is the Quecuene of the natives; =
and forms at its=20

confluence with the Rio Negro a very narrow delta, between the principal tr=
unk and the=20

Amayauhau, which is a little branch more to the west.), and the Rio Padavir=
i, which communicates=20

by a portage with the Mavaca, and consequently with the Upper Orinoco, to t=
he east of the=20

mission of Esmeralda. We shall have occasion to speak of the Rio Branco and=
 the Padaviri, when=20

we arrive in that mission; it suffices here to pause at the third tributary=
 stream of the Rio Negro, the=20

Cababury, the interbranchings of which with the Cassiquiare are alike impor=
tant in their connexion=20

with hydrography, and with the trade in sarsaparilla.  The lofty mountains =
of the Parime, which=20

border the northern bank of the Orinoco in the upper part of its course abo=
ve Esmeralda, send off=20

a chain towards the south, of which the Cerro de Unturan forms one of the p=
rincipal summits. This=20

mountainous country, of small extent but rich in vegetable productions, abo=
ve all, in the mavacure=20

liana, employed in preparing the wourali poison, in almond-trees (the juvia=
, or Bertholletia=20

excelsa), in aromatic pucheries, and in wild cacao-trees, forms a point of =
division between the=20

waters that flow to the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro. The tr=
ibutary streams on the=20

north, or those of the Orinoco, are the Mavaca and the Daracapo; those on t=
he west, or of the=20

Cassiquiare, are the Idapa and the Pacimoni; and those on the south, or of =
the Rio Negro, are the=20

Padaviri and the Cababuri. The latter is divided near its source into two b=
ranches, the=20

westernmost of which is known by the name of Baria. The Indians of the miss=
ion of San Francisco=20

Solano gave us the most minute description of its course. It affords the ve=
ry rare example of a=20

branch by which an inferior tributary stream, instead of receiving the wate=
rs of the superior stream,=20

sends to it a part of its own waters in a direction opposite to that of the=
 principal recipient.  The=20

Cababuri runs into the Rio Negro near the mission of Nossa Senhora das Cald=
as; but the rivers=20

Ya and Dimity, which are higher tributary streams, communicate also with th=
e Cababuri; so that,=20

from the little fort of San Gabriel de Cachoeiras as far as San Antonio de =
Castanheira the Indians=20

of the Portuguese possessions can enter the territory of the Spanish missio=
ns by the Baria and the=20

Pacimoni.  The chief object of these incursions is the collection of sarsap=
arilla and the aromatic=20

seeds of the puchery-laurel (Laurus pichurim). The sarsaparilla of these co=
untries is celebrated at=20

Grand Para, Angostura, Cumana, Nueva Barcelona, and in other parts of Terra=
 Firma, by the=20

name of zarza del Rio Negro. It is much preferred to the zarza of the Provi=
nce of Caracas, or of=20

the mountains of Merida; it is dried with great care, and exposed purposely=
 to smoke, in order that=20

it may become blacker. This liana grows in profusion on the humid decliviti=
es of the mountains of=20

Unturan and Achivaquery. Decandolle is right in suspecting that different s=
pecies of smilax are=20

gathered under the name of sarsaparilla. We found twelve new species, among=
 which the Smilax=20

siphylitica of the Cassiquaire, and the Smilax officinalis of the river Mag=
dalena, are most esteemed=20

on account of their diuretic properties. The quantity of sarsaparilla emplo=
yed in the Spanish=20

colonies as a domestic medicine is very considerable. We see by the works o=
f Clusius, that at the=20

beginning of the Conquista, Europe obtained this salutary medicament from t=
he Mexican coast of=20

Honduras and the port of Guayaquil. The trade in zarza is now more active i=
n those ports which=20

have interior communications with the Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and the Amazo=
n.  The trials made=20

in several botanical gardens of Europe prove that the Smilax glauca of Virg=
inia, which it is=20

pretended is the S. sarsaparilla of Linnaeus, may be cultivated in the open=
 air, wherever the mean=20



winter temperature rises above six or seven degrees of the centigrade therm=
ometer*: but those=20

species that possess the most active virtues belong exclusively to the torr=
id zone, and require a=20

much higher degree of heat. (* The winter temperature at London and Paris i=
s 4.2 and 3.7; at=20

Montpelier, 6.7; at Rome, 7.7 degrees. In that part of Mexico, and the Terr=
a Firma, where we saw=20

the most active species of the sarsaparilla growing (that which supplies th=
e trade of the Spanish=20

and Portuguese colonies), the temperature is from twenty to twenty-six degr=
ees. The roots of=20

another family of monocotyledons (of some cyperaceae) possess also diaphore=
tic and resolvent=20

properties. The Carex arenaria, the C. hirta, etc. furnish the German sarsa=
parilla of druggists.=20

According to Clusius, Europe received the first sarsaparilla from Yucatan, =
and the island of Puna,=20

opposite Guayaquil.) In reading the works of Clusius, it can scarcely be co=
nceived why our writers=20

on the Materia Medica persist in considering a plant of the United States a=
s the most ancient type=20

of the officinal species of the genus smilax.  We found in the possession o=
f the Indians of the Rio=20

Negro some of those green stones, known by the name of Amazon stones, becau=
se the natives=20

pretend, according to an ancient tradition, that they come from the country=
 of the women without=20

husbands (Cougnantainsecouima), or women living alone (Aikeambenano*). (* T=
his word is of the=20

Tamanac language; these women are the sole Donne of the Italian missionarie=
s.) We were told at=20

San Carlos, and in the neighbouring villages, that the sources of the Orino=
co, which we found east=20

of the Esmeralda, and in the missions of the Carony and at Angostura, that =
the sources of the Rio=20

Branco are the native spots of the green stones. These statements confirm t=
he report of an old=20

soldier of the garrison of Cayenne (mentioned by La Condamine), who affirme=
d that those mineral=20

substances were obtained from the country of women, west of the rapids of t=
he Oyapoc. The=20

Indians who inhabit the fort of Topayos on the Amazon five degrees east of =
the mouth of the Rio=20

Negro, possessed formerly a great number of these stones. Had they received=
 them from the=20

north, that is, from the country pointed out by the Indians of the Rio Negr=
o, which extends from the=20

mountains of Cayenne towards the sources of the Essequibo, the Carony, the =
Orinoco, the=20

Parime, and the Rio Trombetas? or did they come from the south by the Rio T=
opayos, which=20

descends from the vast table-land of the Campos Parecis? Superstition attac=
hes great importance=20

to these mineral substances: they are worn suspended from the neck as amule=
ts, because,=20

according to popular belief, they preserve the wearer from nervous complain=
ts, fevers, and the=20

stings of venomous serpents. They have consequently been for ages an articl=
e of trade among the=20

natives, both north and south of the Orinoco. The Caribs, who may be consid=
ered as the=20

Bucharians of the New World, made them known along the coasts of Guiana; an=
d the same=20

stones, like money in circulation, passed successively from nation to natio=
n in opposite directions:=20

their quantity is perhaps not augmented, and the spot which produces them i=
s probably unknown=20

rather than concealed. In the midst of enlightened Europe, on occasion of a=
 warm contest=20

respecting native bark, a few years ago, the green stones of the Orinoco we=
re gravely proposed=20

as a powerful febrifuge. After this appeal to the credulity of Europeans, w=
e cannot be surprised to=20

learn that the Spanish=20


_
about here were just little children three years ago when their daddies lef=
t. What if in our streets=20

soldiers were quartered by the hundreds in every block, with nothing in the=
 world to do but rest!=20

What would happen in Wichita and Emporia--or back East in Goshen, New York,=
 or out West in=20

Fresno or Tonapah? What an awful thing--what a hell in the earth, war is!" =
 And yet we know that=20

young hearts will express themselves as they were meant to express themselv=
es even in the=20

wrack and ruin and waste of war. And this strange picture of love and death=
 sitting together some=20

way reminded us of the phlox and the dahlias blooming in the dreary dooryar=
ds of the shattered=20

homes near the battle line. And then our hearts turned to the youth on the =
boat--that precious load=20

of mounting young blood that came over with us on the Espagne where we were=
 the oldest people=20

in the ship's company. And we began talking of the Eager Soul and her Young=
 Doctor and the=20

Gilded Youth. If the war could lash our old hearts as it was lashing them, =
so that even our=20

emotions were raw and more or less a-quiver in the storm of the mingled pas=
sions of the world=20

that overwhelmed us, how much--how fearfully much more must their younger h=
earts be stirred?=20

How could youth come out of it all unscarred! And she was such a sweet pret=
ty girl, the Eager=20

Soul, so fine and brave and wise--yet her heart was a girl's heart, after a=
ll. And the Young Doctor,=20

his keen sensitive face showed how near to the surface was the quick in him=
. As for the Gilded=20

Youth, we had seen there on the hill in the misty night the great hammer of=
 the guns pound the=20

dross out of him! And here they were all three alone, in the fury of this a=
wful storm that was testing=20

the stoutest souls in the world, and they were so young and so untried!  Th=
e roads over which we=20

had been travelling for two days in our car were military roads. And we cou=
ld tell instantly when we=20

were inside the thirty kilo limit of the firing line, by looking at the roa=
d menders. If they were=20

German prisoners we were outside the thirty kilo strip. For when the German=
s discovered last=20

spring that the Allies held more prisoners than the Germans, the Germans de=
manded a rule for=20

the treatment of prisoners, which should keep them thirty kilos from danger=
. It was a rule that the=20

Allies had been observing; but the Germans were not observing it, until the=
y found that they might=20

suffer by non-observance. So when we left the German prisoners and came to =
French road=20

menders--generally French Chinamen or Anamites, or negroes from Dahomey or =
other oriental=20

peoples, we knew we were soon to come in sound of the big guns. These road =
menders always=20

were at work. Beside every road a few yards apart, always were little neatl=
y stacked cones of road=20

metal. A road roller always was in sight. No road ever got bumpy and at giv=
en distances along the=20

road were repair stations for the government automobiles. Nothing was allow=
ed to stop the=20

machinery of war. At night along these country roads, thirty kilos back fro=
m the line we travelled=20

with lights; so that night out of Rheims, we hurried through the night, pas=
sed village after village=20

swarming with soldiers, black and yellow and white; for the colour line doe=
s not irritate the French;=20

and we saw how gay and happy they were, crowding into picture shows, listen=
ing to the=20

regimental band, sitting on the sidewalks before the cafes, or dancing with=
 the girls in the parks.=20

Then a time came when the village streets were lonely and dark and we knew =
that the bugle had=20

sounded taps. And so in due course we came to the end of the day's journey,=
 at the end of a spur=20

of the railroad, near one sector of the Verdun front. There we found a fiel=
d hospital of four=20

thousand beds. And when there is to be renewed French activity on the Verdu=
n sector, the first=20

thing that happens is the general evacuation of all the patients in the hos=
pital. It takes a great=20

many railroad trains to clear out a hospital wherein six thousand wounded m=
en are jammed. We=20



saw one hospital train loading. This hospital had handled twenty-six hundre=
d cases in one day the=20

week before we arrived. The big guns that we had heard booming away for thr=
ee days as we went=20

up and down the line had been grinding their awful grist. We walked through=
 the hospital, which=20

covered acres of ground. It is a board structure, some of the walls are not=
 even papered, but show=20

the two-by-fours nakedly and the rafters above. Stoves heat most of the war=
ds, and hospital=20

linoleum covers the runways between the rows of beds. Of course, the operat=
ing rooms are=20

painted white and kept spotless. The French are marvellous surgeons, and th=
eir results in turning=20

men back to the line, both in per cent of men and time are up to the normal=
 average of the war; but=20

they are not so finical about flies and fresh air and unimportant dirt as t=
he English or the=20

Americans. They probably feel that there are more essential things to consi=
der than flies and their=20

trysting places! In this hospital we saw our first wounded German prisoners=
. We saw boys fifteen=20

years old, whose voices had not changed. We saw men past fifty. We saw slop=
e-shouldered,=20

hollow-chested, pale-faced men of the academic type, wearing glasses an eig=
hth of an inch thick.=20

We saw scrubby looking men who seemed to "be the dirt and the dross, the du=
st and the scum of=20

the earth."  And we saw also some well-set-up Germans, and in a bull-pen ne=
ar the railroad=20

station waiting for the trains to take them to the interior of France were =
six thousand German=20

prisoners--for the most part well-made men. Here and there was a scrub--a b=
oy, a defective, or an=20

old man; showing that the Germans are working these classes through the arm=
y; but indicating, so=20

far as one batch of prisoners from one part of the battle line may indicate=
, that the Germans still=20

have a splendid fighting army. But the old German army that came raging thr=
ough Belgium and=20

northern France in 1914 is gone. Germany is well past the peak in man power=
, as shown in the=20

soldiers of the line. It is also likely that the morale of the German line =
has its best days behind it.=20

The American ambulance men in the Verdun sector told us of a company of Ger=
man soldiers who=20

had come across a few nights before to surrender, after killing their offic=
ers. They appeared at=20

about ten o'clock at night, and told the French to cease firing at exactly =
that time the next night for=20

ten minutes and another troop of Germans would come across. The French ceas=
ed at the agreed=20

hour and thirty more came over and brought the mail to their comrades! That=
, of course, is not a=20

usual occurrence. But similar instances are found. The best one can say of =
the German morale in=20

the army is that it is spotted. In civilian life the nearer one gets to Ger=
many the surer one is that=20

the civilian morale seems to be sound. These things we found in the air up =
near the front line=20

trenches, where German prisoners talk, and where one sees the war "close up=
."  But we were=20

going still nearer to the German lines, and the next day we set out for Rec=
icourt and arrived there=20

about noon. It is a little bombed village where a few thousand soldiers are=
 quartered, and a few=20

score villagers huddle in cellars and caves by night and go forth to their =
farms by day. The village=20

lies in a ravine. The railway runs in front of the town, and the week we we=
re there a big naval gun=20

was booming away on the railroad throwing death into the German lines eight=
 or ten miles=20

predilection of the Indians for these amulets, and that they are sold at a =
very considerable price.=20

The form given to them most frequently is that of the Babylonian cylinders,=
* longitudinally=20

perforated, and loaded with inscriptions and figures. (The price of a cylin=
der two inches long is=20

from twelve to fifteen piastres.) But this is not the work of the Indians o=
f our days, the natives of=20

the Orinoco and the Amazon, whom we find in the last degree of barbarism. T=
he Amazon stones,=20

like the perforated and sculptured emeralds, found in the Cordilleras of Ne=
w Grenada and Quito,=20



are vestiges of anterior civilization. The present inhabitants of those cou=
ntries, particularly in the=20

hot region, so little comprehend the possibility of cutting hard stones (th=
e emerald, jade, compact=20

feldspar and rock-crystal), that they imagine the green stone is soft when =
taken out of the earth,=20

and that it hardens after having been moulded by the hand.  The natural soi=
l of the Amazon-stone=20

is not in the valley of the river Amazon. It does not derive its name from =
the river, but like the river=20

itself, the stone has been named after a nation of warlike women, whom Fath=
er Acunha, and=20

Oviedo, in his letter to cardinal Bembo, compare to the Amazons of the anci=
ent world. What we=20

see in our cabinets under the false denomination of Amazon-stone, is neithe=
r jade, nor compact=20

feldspar, but a common feldspar of an apple-green colour, that comes from t=
he Ural mountains=20

and on lake Onega in Russia, but which I never saw in the granitic mountain=
s of Guiana.=20

Sometimes also this very rare and hard Amazon-stone is confounded with the =
hatchet-nephrite=20

(beilstein)* of Werner, which has much less tenacity. (* Punamustein (jade =
axinien). The stone=20

hatchets found in America, for instance in Mexico, are not of beilstein, bu=
t of compact feldspar.)=20

The substance which I obtained from the hands of the Indians, belongs to th=
e saussurite,* (* Jade=20

of Saussure, according to the system of Brongniart; tenacious jade, and com=
pact tenacious=20

feldspar of Hauy; some varieties of the variolithe of Werner.) to the real =
jade, which resembles=20

compact feldspar, and which forms one of the constituent parts of the verde=
 de Corsica, or=20

gabbro.* (* Euphotide of Hauy, or schillerfels, of Raumer.) It takes a fine=
 polish, and passes from=20

apple-green to emerald-green; it is translucent at the edges, extremely ten=
acious, and in a high=20

degree sonorous. These Amazon stones were formerly cut by the natives into =
very thin plates,=20

perforated at the centre, and suspended by a thread, and these plates yield=
 an almost metallic=20

sound if struck by another hard body.* (* M. Brongniart, to whom I showed t=
hese plates on my=20

return to Europe, very justly compared these jades of Parime to the sonorou=
s stones employed by=20

the Chinese in their musical instruments called king.) This fact confirms t=
he connection which we=20

find, notwithstanding the difference of fracture and of specific gravity be=
tween the saussurite and=20

the siliceous basis of the porphyrschiefer, which is the phonolite (klingst=
ein). I have already=20

observed, that, as it is very rare to find in America nephrite, jade, or co=
mpact feldspar, in its native=20

place, we may well be astonished at the quantity of hatchets which are ever=
ywhere discovered in=20

digging the earth, from the banks of the Ohio as far as Chile. We saw in th=
e mountains of Upper=20

Orinoco, or of Parime, only granular granites containing a little hornblend=
e, granites passing into=20

gneiss, and schistoid hornblendes. Has nature repeated on the east of Esmer=
alda, between the=20

sources of the Carony, the Essequibo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Branco, the =
transition-formation of=20

Tucutunemo reposing on mica-schist? Does the Amazon-stone come from the roc=
ks of euphotide,=20

which form the last member of the series of primitive rocks?  We find among=
 the inhabitants of=20

both hemispheres, at the first dawn of civilization, a peculiar predilectio=
n for certain stones; not=20

only those which, from their hardness, may be useful to man as cutting inst=
ruments, but also for=20

mineral substances, which, on account of their colour and their natural for=
m, are believed to bear=20

some relation to the organic functions, and even to the propensities of the=
 soul. This ancient=20

worship of stones, these benign virtues attributed to jade and haematite, b=
elong to the savages of=20

America as well as to the inhabitants of the forests of Thrace. The human r=
ace, when in an=20

uncultivated state, believes itself to have sprung from the ground; and fee=
ls as if it were enchained=20

to the earth, and the substances contained in her bosom. The powers of natu=
re, and still more=20



those which destroy than those which preserve, are the first objects of its=
 worship. It is not solely in=20

the tempest, in the sound that precedes the earthquake, in the fire that fe=
eds the volcano, that=20

these powers are manifested; the inanimate rock; stones, by their lustre an=
d hardness; mountains,=20

by their mass and their solitude; act upon the untaught mind with a force w=
hich, in a state of=20

advanced civilization, can no longer be conceived. This worship of stones, =
when once established,=20

is preserved amidst more modern forms of worship; and what was at first the=
 object of religious=20

homage, becomes a source of superstitious confidence. Divine stones are tra=
nsformed into=20

amulets, which are believed to preserve the wearer from every ill, mental a=
nd corporeal. Although=20

a distance of five hundred leagues separates the banks of the Amazon and th=
e Orinoco from the=20

Mexican table-land; although history records no fact that connects the sava=
ge nations of Guiana=20

with the civilized nations of Anahuac, the monk Bernard de Sahagun, at the =
beginning of the=20

conquest, found preserved as relics at Cholula, certain green stones which =
had belonged to=20

Quetzalcohuatl. This mysterious personage is the Mexican Buddha; he appeare=
d in the time of the=20

Toltecs, founded the first religious associations, and established a govern=
ment similar to that of=20

Meroe and of Japan.  The history of the jade, or the green stones of Guiana=
, is intimately=20

connected with that of the warlike women whom the travellers of the sixteen=
th century named the=20

Amazons of the New World. La Condamine has produced many testimonies in fav=
our of this=20

tradition. Since my return from the Orinoco and the river Amazon, I have of=
ten been asked, at=20

Paris, whether I embraced the opinion of that learned man, or believed, lik=
e several of his=20

contemporaries, that he undertook the defence of the Cougnantainsecouima (t=
he independent=20

women who received men into their society only in the month of April), mere=
ly to fix, in a public=20

sitting of the Academy, the attention of an audience somewhat eager for nov=
elties. I may take this=20

opportunity of expressing my opinion on a tradition which has so romantic a=
n appearance; and I=20

am farther led to do this as La Condamine asserts that the Amazons of the R=
io Cayame* crossed=20

the Maranon to establish themselves on the Rio Negro. (* Orellana, arriving=
 at the Maranon by the=20

Rio Coca and the Napo, fought with the Amazons, as it appears, between the =
mouth of the Rio=20

Negro and that of the Xingu. La Condamine asserts that in the seventeenth c=
entury they passed=20

the Maranon between Tefe and the mouth of the Rio Puruz, near the Cano Cuch=
ivara, which is a=20

western branch of the Puruz. These women therefore came from the banks of t=
he Rio Cayame, or=20

Cayambe, consequently from the unknown country which extends south of the M=
aranon, between=20

the=20


_
across a bridge over a brook the white wagon road runs, and that day the ro=
ad was black with=20

trucks going up to the front line with supplies. We could hear the big guns=
 plainly over in the=20

woods a few miles away. But we had no thought of danger as we tumbled out o=
f our car. We=20

should have known that bombed villages don't just grow that way! Something =
causes the gaping=20

holes in roofs, the shattered walls, the blear-eyed windows and battered ou=
t-buildings! Generally it=20

is German shells, but we had been seeing bombed towns for days, and we forg=
ot that sooner or=20

later we must meet the bombs that did the miserable work. As we stood by th=
e automobiles at=20

Recicourt, kicking the wrinkles out of our cotton khaki riding breeches--an=
d mine, alas, had to be=20

kicked carefully to preserve that pie-slice cut from my shirt tail that exp=
anded the waistband from=20

36 to 44 inches--little did it seem to Henry and me that we should first me=
et a German shell face to=20

face in a place like Recicourt. The name did not sound historic. But we had=
 scarcely shaken hands=20

around the group of American Ambulance men who gathered to greet us before =
we heard a B-A-

N-G!--an awful sound! It was as if someone suddenly had picked up the whole=
 Haynes Hardware=20

store--at Emporia--tinware, farm implements, stoves, nails and shelf-goods,=
 and had switched it=20

with an awful whizz through the air and landed it upon the sheet-iron roof =
of Wichita's Civic Forum,=20

which seats six thousand! We looked at each other in surprise, but each rea=
lized that he must be=20

casual to support the other; so we said nothing to the Ambulance boys, and =
they, being used to=20

such things, let it pass also. We went on talking; so did Major Murphy, bei=
ng a soldier. So did Mr.=20

Richard Norton, being head of the American Ambulance Service. In a minute t=
here was a fearful=20

whistle--long, piercing, and savage, and then they had taken the Peters Har=
dware stock in=20

Emporia and dumped it on the Wichita Union Station. This time we saw a grea=
t cone-shaped cloud=20

of dirt rise not 400 feet away--over by the wagon road, across the brook fr=
om us. Still no one=20

mentioned the matter. It seemed to Henry and me to be anything but a secret=
, but if the others had=20

that notion of it, far be it from us to blab! An ambulance driver came lazy=
ing around the corner and=20

began to start his car.  "Any one hurt, Singer?" asked a handsome youth nam=
ed Hughes, of the=20

Corps.  "Man hit by the first shell up here by the railroad. I'm going afte=
r him."  "Hurt badly?" asked=20

another boy.  "Oh, arm or shoulder or something blown off. I'll be back for=
 lunch."  The details=20

interested us; we could see that the secret was being uncovered. Again came=
 an awful roar and=20

another terrific bang--this time the dust cloud rose nearer to us than befo=
re--perhaps 300 feet=20

away. Every one ducked. In five seconds they had taught me to duck. It's cu=
rious how quickly the=20

adult mind acquires useful information. But Henry for some reason got a bad=
 start, and his duck=20

needed correction. To duck, you scrooch down, and shrink in, to get as much=
 as possible of your=20

body under the eaves of your steel helmet. Somewhere between the second and=
 third bang, they=20

got a helmet on me. No one knows where it came from, nor how it got there. =
But there it was,=20

while they were correcting Henry's duck. In spite of them, when he ducked, =
Henry would lean=20

forward, thus multiplying his exposure by ten. But it really does a fat man=
 little good to duck=20

anyway; the eaves of his helmet hardly cover his collar. It was while they =
were trying to telescope=20

Henry that some one grabbed me by the arm and said: "Come on! Let's go to t=
he abri!" Abri was a=20

brand new word to me, but it seemed to be some place to go and that was eno=
ugh for me.=20

"Where" (read this line with feeling and emphasis) "is the abri?" The ambul=
ance boy took me by=20

the arm and led me on a trot to a dugout covered with railroad iron, and lo=
gs and sand bags, and=20

we went in there and found it full of French officers. They have some sense=
. The abri would not=20



turn a direct explosion of a shell; but it would shield one against a glanc=
ing blow and against the=20

shrapnel which sprays itself out from the point where the shell hits like a=
 molten iron fountain. After=20

the ninth bomb had come over we left the abri. The Germans had been allowan=
cing Recicourt to=20

nine a day. But that day they gave us three more prunes for dessert. They c=
ame very close and=20

fairly fast together. As they came Henry was sitting in the barn where the =
ambulance boys had=20

their meals. Lunch was on the table and Henry was writing. The shells sound=
ed just outside the=20

barn. "What are you writing, Mr. Allen?" asked Major Murphy. "I'm sketching=
," stuttered the Wichita=20

statesman, "a sort of a draft of the American terms of peace!"  After three=
 extra bombs had come=20

in the Germans turned their guns from the town, and we had our lunch at our=
 ease. And such a=20

lunch! A melon to begin with; a yellow melon that looks like the old-fashio=
ned American=20

muskmelon and tastes like a nectar of the gods, followed by onion soup. The=
n followed an entree,=20

a large thin slice of cold sausage which they afterward told us was made of=
 horse meat, a pate of=20

some kind, then roast veal sliced thin and slightly underdone with browned =
potatoes; then new=20

beans served as a separate course; then fruit and cheese and coffee and cig=
ars! And that in a=20

barn!  [Illustration: "Come on! Let's go to the abri!"]  We had to go up to=
 a first aid station after=20

lunch so we piled into an ambulance, were buttoned in from the back by the =
driver, and went=20

sailing up the hill and into the woods. They told us that we were in the Av=
ecourt Woods in the=20

Forest of Hess. We remembered that but a few weeks before when we were in o=
ur newspaper=20

offices, that the Avecourt Woods had been the scene of some fierce and bloo=
dy fighting. And as=20

we rode up the hill we heard the French cannon roaring all about us. We wer=
e told that four=20

thousand cannon were planted in the Avecourt Woods, but only about a thousa=
nd of them were=20

active that day. Yet we could see none, so completely were they hidden by c=
amouflage. The=20

woods were barren of leaves or branches though they should have been in fol=
iage. We gazed=20

through the windows of the ambulance into the stark forest with its top off=
, and then rather=20

gradually it occurred to me that the white objects carefully corded against=
 the tree trunks were not=20

sticks of cord wood at all, as they seemed, and as they should have been if=
 the wood had been=20

under the ax instead of under fire. They were French seventy-five shells--d=
eadly brass cartridges=20

two feet long, all nicely and peacefully corded against the trunks of the b=
ig trees! We rode through=20

them for several miles. Beside the road always were the little heaps of roa=
d metal, little heaps of=20

stone, and always the engineers stood ready to refill the holes that might =
be made by the incoming=20

shells. And occasionally they were coming in; though they seemed to be land=
ing in a distant part=20

of the forest. The ear becomes curiously quick at telling the difference be=
tween what are known as=20

arrives and departs. The departs were going out that day at the ratio of 32=
 to one arrive. For the=20

Germans had wasted enough ammunition on the Verdun sector and were trying t=
o economize!=20

Still the arrives were landing in the Avecourt wood every minute or so, and=
 they were disquieting.=20

Only the chirping of our own broad-mouthed Canaries there in the roofless f=
orest gave us cheer.=20

For some way the sound of the shells of our own guns shrieking over us is a=
 deep comfort; it is=20

something like the consolation of a great faith.  At last, seven or eight m=
iles in the forest, we came=20

upon the first aid post, a quarter of a mile from the opposite edge of the =
wood and but half a mile=20

from the front line trenches of Verdun The first aid post there was a cella=
r, half excavated, and half=20

covered with earth, and roofed with iron rails, logs and sandbags. The usua=
l French doctors,=20

stretcher bearers and American Ambulance men were there. And there was the =
little cemetery,=20



always found at a first aid post where those are buried who die on the stre=
tchers or in the dugout.=20

It was lovingly adorned by the French with the tri-colour of France, with b=
ronze wreaths, with=20

woodland flowers, and was altogether bright and beautiful in the bare woods=
. They showed us a=20

shell by the cave--a gas shell that had come over during the morning and ha=
d hit on the oblique=20

and had not exploded. It was gently leaking chlorine gas, which we sniffed-=
-but gingerly. Other=20

shells were popping into the place and fairly near us with some regularity =
and enthusiasm, and it=20

seemed to Henry and me that we had no desire to stare grim war's wrinkled f=
ront out of=20

countenance, and we hoped that the Major and Mr. Norton were nearly ready t=
o go back. But we=20

heard this:  From the Major: "How far forward can we go toward Hill 304; we=
 would like to see it,=20

but have no desire to go further than you care to have us."  And from the F=
rench lieutenant in=20

charge: "Go to Berlin if you want to!"  It occurred to Henry and me, consid=
ering our feelings, that=20

the Major's nonchalant use of that "we" was without the consent of the gove=
rned. But when he=20

started forward we followed. Our moral cowardice overwhelmed our physical c=
owardice, and our=20

legs tracked ahead while our hearts tracked back. The Major swung along the=
 road at a fast clip;=20

Mr. Norton went with him. For short-geared men we followed as fast as we co=
uld, but it was at a=20

respectful distance. Nearer and nearer we came to the open field, and by th=
e same token, quicker=20

and nearer and hotter came the German shells. We were continually on the du=
ck. Our progress=20

had an accordion rhythm that made distance come slow. We came to a dead mul=
e in the road. He=20

had been bombed recently, and was not ready for visitors. Now a mule is not=
 nature's masterpiece=20

at his best; but in the transition state between a mule and hamburger, a mu=
le leaves much to be=20

desired. As we passed the forward reaches of the mule, Henry began his kidd=
ing. He always=20

begins to guy a situation under emotion. "Bill," he cried, "if we die we'll=
 at least save our nice new=20

hundred dollar uniforms down there in Paris!" And from me he got this: "And=
 say, Henry--if we die=20

we won't have to face our wives and tell 'em we paid that much for a two-pi=
ece suit! There's that=20

comfort in sudden death!"  It seemed to Henry and me that we had seen all t=
here was to be seen=20

of the war. Hill 304 would be there after the treaty of peace was signed an=
d the Major and Norton=20

then could come to see it. But they were bound for Berlin; so we slowly edg=
ed by that poor mule;=20

he seemed to be the longest mule we had ever--well, he seemed to be a sort =
of trans-continental=20

mule, but we finally got past him and came to the edge of the woods. It too=
k about three ducks to=20

twenty yards, and passing the mule we had four downs and no gain. That gave=
 the Germans the=20

ball. So when we got to the edge of the wood and were standing looking into=
 the French trenches=20

and at Hill 304 off at our right, after the Major had handed Norton the fie=
ld glasses and Norton had=20

considerately handed them to Henry, who passed them to me for such fleeting=
 glance as=20

politeness might require, the Germans came back with that ball. It came rig=
ht out of Berlin, too.=20

One could hear it howl as it crossed the Thiergarten and went over Wilhelm =
Strasse and scream=20

as it whizzed over Bavaria. There never was another such shell. And we duck=
ed--all of us. Henry=20

said he never saw me make such a duck--it was the duck of a life-time. And =
then that shell landed.=20

It was a wholesale hardware store that hit--no retail affair. The sound was=
 awful. And then=20

something inside of me or outside tore with an awful rip. We had been readi=
ng Dr. Crile's book on=20

the anesthesia of fear, and suddenly it occurred to me that the shell had h=
it me and torn a hole in=20

me and that fear had deadened the pain. Slowly and in terror my right hand =
groped back to the=20

place of the wound, expecting every moment to encounter blood and ragged fl=
esh. We were still=20



crouched over, waiting for the fountain of junk to cease spraying. Nearer a=
nd nearer came the=20

shrinking fingers to the wound. They felt no blood, but something more terr=
ible! There, dangling by=20

its apex, hung that pie-shaped slice of shirt from those cotton khaki trous=
ers--ripped clear out! And=20

Paris fifty miles away!  Slowly we unfolded Raleigh also places them on the=
 south of the Maranon,=20

but in the province of Topayos, and on the river of the same name. He says =
they were rich in=20

golden vessels, which they had acquired in exchange for the famous green st=
ones, or piedras=20

hijadas. (Raleigh means, no doubt, piedros del higado, stones that cure dis=
eases of the liver.) It is=20

remarkable enough that, one hundred and forty-eight years after, La Condami=
ne still found those=20

green stones (divine stones), which differ neither in colour nor in hardnes=
s from oriental jade, in=20

greater numbers among the Indians who live near the mouth of the Rio Topayo=
s, than elsewhere.=20

The Indians said that they inherited these stones, which cure the nephritic=
 colic and epilepsy, from=20

their fathers, who received them from the women without husbands.) A taste =
for the marvellous,=20

and a wish to invest the descriptions of the New Continent with some of the=
 colouring of classic=20

antiquity, no doubt contributed to give great importance to the first narra=
tives of Orellana. In=20

perusing the works of Vespucci, Fernando Columbus, Geraldini, Oviedo, and P=
ietro Martyr, we=20

recognize this tendency of the writers of the sixteenth century to find amo=
ng the newly discovered=20

nations all that the Greeks have related to us of the first age of the worl=
d, and of the manners of=20

the barbarous Scythians and Africans. But if Oviedo, in addressing his lett=
ers to cardinal Bembo,=20

thought fit to flatter the taste of a man so familiar with the study of ant=
iquity, Sir Walter Raleigh had=20

a less poetic aim. He sought to fix the attention of Queen Elizabeth on the=
 great empire of Guiana,=20

the conquest of which he proposed. He gave a description of the rising of t=
hat gilded king (el=20

dorado),* whose chamberlains, furnished with long tubes, blew powdered gold=
 every morning over=20

his body, after having rubbed it over with aromatic oils: but nothing could=
 be better adapted to=20

strike the imagination of queen Elizabeth, than the warlike republic of wom=
en without husbands,=20

who resisted the Castilian heroes. (* The term el dorado, which signifies t=
he gilded, was not=20

originally the name of the country. The territory subsequently distinguishe=
d by that appellation was=20

at first known as the country of el Rey Dorado, the Gilded King.) Such were=
 the motives which=20

prompted exaggeration on the part of those writers who have given most repu=
tation to the=20

Amazons of America; but these motives do not, I think, suffice for entirely=
 rejecting a tradition,=20

which is spread among various nations having no communications one with ano=
ther.  Thirty years=20

after La Condamine visited Quito, a Portuguese astronomer, Ribeiro, who has=
 traversed the=20

Amazon, and the tributary streams which run into that river on the northern=
 side, has confirmed on=20

the spot all that the learned Frenchman had advanced. He found the same tra=
ditions among the=20

Indians; and he collected them with the greater impartiality as he did not =
himself believe that the=20

Amazons formed a separate horde. Not knowing any of the tongues spoken on t=
he Orinoco and=20

the Rio Negro, I could learn nothing certain respecting the popular traditi=
ons of the women without=20

husbands, or the origin of the green stones, which are believed to be intim=
ately connected with=20

them. I shall, however, quote a modern testimony of some weight, that of Fa=
ther Gili. "Upon=20

inquiring," says this well-informed missionary, "of a Quaqua Indian, what n=
ations inhabited the Rio=20

Cuchivero, he named to me the Achirigotos, the Pajuros, and the Aikeambenan=
os.* (* In Italian,=20

Acchirecolti, Pajuri, and Aicheam-benano.) Being well acquainted," pursues =
he, "with the Tamanac=20

tongue, I instantly comprehended the sense of this last word, which is a co=
mpound, and signifies=20



women living alone. The Indian confirmed my observation, and related that t=
he Aikeambenanos=20

were a community of women, who manufactured blow-tubes* (* Long tubes made =
from a hollow=20

cane, which the natives use to propel their poisoned arrows.), and other we=
apons of war. They=20

admit, once a year, the men of the neighbouring nation of Vokearos into the=
ir society, and send=20

them back with presents. All the male children born in this horde of women =
are killed in their=20

infancy." This history seems framed on the traditions which circulate among=
 the Indians of the=20

Maranon, and among the Caribs; yet the Quaqua Indian, of whom Father Gili s=
peaks, was=20

ignorant of the Castilian language; he had never had any communication with=
 white men; and=20

certainly knew not, that south of the Orinoco there existed another river, =
called the river of the=20

Aikeambenanos, or Amazons.  What must we conclude from this narration of th=
e old missionary of=20

Encaramada? Not that there are Amazons on the banks of the Cuchivero, but t=
hat women in=20

different parts of America, wearied of the state of slavery in which they w=
ere held by the men,=20

united themselves together; that the desire of preserving their independenc=
e rendered them=20

warriors; and that they received visits from a neighbouring and friendly ho=
rde. This society of=20

women may have acquired some power in one part of Guiana. The Caribs of the=
 continent held=20

intercourse with those of the islands; and no doubt in this way the traditi=
ons of the Maranon and=20

the Orinoco were propagated toward the north. Before the voyage of Orellana=
, Christopher=20

Columbus imagined he had found the Amazons in the Caribbee Islands. This gr=
eat man was told,=20

that the small island of Madanino (Montserrat) was inhabited by warlike wom=
en, who lived the=20

greater part of the year separate from men. At other times also, the conqui=
stadores imagined that=20

the women, who defended their huts in the absence of their husbands, were r=
epublics of=20

Amazons; and, by an error less excusable, formed a like supposition respect=
ing the religious=20

congregations, the convents of Mexican virgins, who, far from admitting men=
 at any season of the=20

year into their society, lived according to the austere rule of Quetzalcohu=
atl. Such was the=20

disposition of men's minds, that in the long succession of travellers, who =
crowded on each other in=20

their discoveries and in narrations of the marvels of the New World, every =
one readily declared he=20

had seen what his predecessors had announced.  We passed three nights at Sa=
n Carlos del Rio=20

Negro. I count the nights, because I watched during the greater part of the=
m, in the hope of seizing=20

the moment of the passage of some star over the meridian. That I might have=
 nothing to reproach=20

myself with, I kept the instruments always ready for an observation. I coul=
d not even obtain double=20

altitudes, to calculate the latitude by the method of Douwes. What a contra=
st between two parts of=20

the same zone; between the sky of Cumana, where the air is constantly pure =
as in Persia and=20

Arabia, and the sky of the Rio Negro, veiled like that of the Feroe islands=
, without sun, or moon or=20

stars!  On the 10th of May, our canoe being ready before sunrise, we embark=
ed to go up the Rio=20

Negro as far as the mouth of the Cassiquiare, and to devote ourselves to re=
searches on the real=20

course of that river, which unites the Orinoco to the Amazon. The morning w=
as fine; but, in=20

proportion as the heat augmented, the sky became obscured. The air is so sa=
turated by water in=20

these forests, that the vesicular vapours become visible on the least incre=
ase of evaporation at the=20

surface of the earth. The breeze being never felt, the humid strata are not=
 displaced and renewed=20

by dryer air. We were every day more grieved at the aspect of the cloudy sk=
y. M. Bonpland was=20

losing by this excessive humidity the plants he had collected; and I, for m=
y part, was afraid lest I=20

should again find the fogs of the Rio Negro in the valley of the Cassiquiar=
e. No one in these=20



missions for half a century past had doubted the existence of communication=
 between two great=20

systems of rivers; the important point of our voyage was confined therefore=
 to fixing by=20

astronomical observations the course of the Cassiquiare, and particularly t=
he point of its entrance=20

into the Rio Negro, and that of the bifurcation of the Orinoco. Without a s=
ight of the sun and the=20

stars this object would be frustrated, and we should have exposed ourselves=
 in vain to long and=20

painful privations. Our fellow travellers would have returned by the shorte=
st way, that of the=20

Pimichin and the small rivers; but M. Bonpland preferred, like me, persisti=
ng in the plan of the=20

voyage, which we had traced for ourselves in passing the Great Cataracts. W=
e had already=20

travelled one hundred and eighty leagues in a boat from San Fernando de Apu=
re to San Carlos,=20

on the Rio Apure, the Orinoco, the Atabapo, the Temi, the Tuamini, and the =
Rio Negro. In again=20

entering the Orinoco by the Cassiquiare we had to navigate three hundred an=
d twenty leagues,=20

from San Carlos to Angostura. By this way we had to struggle against the cu=
rrents during ten=20

days; the rest was to be performed by going down the stream of the Orinoco.=
 It would have been=20

blamable to have suffered ourselves to be discouraged by the fear of a clou=
dy sky, and by the=20

mosquitos of the Cassiquiare. Our Indian pilot, who had been recently at Ma=
ndavaca, promised us=20

the sun, and those great stars that eat the clouds, as soon as we should ha=
ve left the black waters=20

of the Guaviare. We therefore carried out our first project of returning to=
 San Fernando de Atabapo=20

by the Cassiquiare; and, fortunately for our researches, the prediction of =
the Indian was verified.=20

The white waters brought us by degrees a more serene sky, stars, mosquitos,=
 and crocodiles.  We=20

passed between the islands of Zaruma and Mini, or Mibita, covered with thic=
k vegetation; and,=20

after having ascended the rapids of the Piedra de Uinumane, we entered the =
Rio Cassiquiare at=20

the distance of eight miles from the small fort of San Carlos. The Piedra, =
or granitic rock which=20

forms the little cataract, attracted our attention on account of the numero=
us veins of quartz by=20

which it is traversed. These veins are several inches broad, and their mass=
es proved that their=20

date and formation are very different. I saw distinctly that, wherever they=
 crossed each other, the=20

veins containing mica and black schorl traversed and drove out of their dir=
ection those which=20

contained only white quartz and feldspar. According to the theory of Werner=
, the black veins were=20

consequently of a more recent formation than the white. Being a disciple of=
 the school of Freyberg,=20

I could not but pause with satisfaction at the rock of Uinumane, to observe=
 the same phenomena=20

near the equator, which I had so often seen in the mountains of my own coun=
try. I confess that the=20

theory which considers veins as clefts filled from above with various subst=
ances, pleases me=20

somewhat less now than it did at that period; but these modes of intersecti=
on and driving aside,=20

observed in the stony and metallic veins, do not the less merit the attenti=
on of travellers as being=20

one of the most general and constant of geological phenomena. On the east o=
f Javita, all along=20

the Cassiquiare, and particularly in the mountains of Duida, the number of =
veins in the granite=20

increases. These veins are full of holes and druses; and their frequency se=
ems to indicate that the=20

granite of these countries is not of very ancient formation.  We found some=
 lichens on the rock=20

Uinumane, opposite the island of Chamanare, at the edge of the rapids; and =
as the Cassiquiare=20

near its mouth turns abruptly from east to south-west, we saw for the first=
 time this majestic branch=20

of the Orinoco in all its breadth. It much resembles the Rio Negro in the g=
eneral aspect of the=20

landscape. The trees of the forest, as in the basin of the latter river, ad=
vance as far as the beach,=20

and there form a thick coppice; but the Cassiquiare has white waters, and m=
ore frequently=20



changes its direction. Its breadth, near the rapids of Uinumane, almost sur=
passes that of the Rio=20

Negro. I found it everywhere from two hundred and fifty to two hundred and =
eighty toises, as far as=20

above Vasiva. Before we passed the island of Garigave, we perceived to the =
north-east, almost at=20

the horizon, a little hill with a hemispheric summit; the form which in eve=
ry zone characterises=20

mountains of granite. Continually surrounded by vast plains, the solitary r=
ocks and hills excite the=20

attention of the traveller. Contiguous mountains are only found more to the=
 east, towards the=20

sources of the Pacimoni, Siapa, and Mavaca. Having arrived on the south of=
=20


_
went a sharp metallic click on Norton's helmet. A bit of shrapnel had hit i=
t. Under a hat he would=20

have been killed! So we went back to the first aid post--me holding those k=
haki trousers up by=20

sheer force of will, and both hands!  So long as Norton and the Major had l=
ed the way from the=20

dugout, it simultaneously flashed over Henry and me that we should lead the=
 way back, and not=20

leave all the exertion to our companions. So we set the pace back.  At the =
first aid post we=20

stopped for breath. The French welcomed us back, and we rested a moment und=
er their=20

hospitality. Our own French guns were carolling away; the arrives were comi=
ng in. It seemed to=20

Henry and me that we were not so badly frightened as we knew we were. For w=
e kept a running=20

fire going of airy persiflage--which was like the noise of boys whistling C=
assiquiare, by the=20

windings of its course, again approached San Carlos. The distance from this=
 fort to the mission of=20

San Francisco Solano, where we slept, is only two leagues and a half by lan=
d, but it is reckoned=20

seven or eight by the river. I passed a part of the night in the open air, =
waiting vainly for stars. The=20

air was misty, notwithstanding the aguas blancas, which were to lead us ben=
eath an ever-starry=20

sky.  The mission of San Francisco Solano, situated on the left bank of the=
 Cassiquiare, was=20

founded, as were most of the Christian settlements south of the Great Catar=
acts of the Orinoco,=20

not by monks, but by military authority. At the time of the expedition of t=
he boundaries, villages=20

were built in proportion as a subteniente, or a corporal, advanced with his=
 troops. Part of the=20

natives, in order to=20


_
said: "That German gunner is playing by ear! His time is bad, or else it's =
syncopated." Then to=20

Major Murphy: "Nice sightly location that Hill 304; but I noticed real esta=
te going up a good deal in=20

the neighbourhood!" And to the assembled company in the dugout he remarked =
as he pulled out=20

his pipe, a short Hiram Johnson, bulldog model that he had bought on the Ru=
e de Rivoli, "If you=20

gentlemen will get out your gas masks now I'll light my dreadnaught!" Which=
 he did and calmed his=20

iron nerves. So in a few moments we came out of the post and went to our am=
bulance which=20

would take us back to Recicourt. Clouds had blown across the sky and as we =
passed the gay little=20

cemetery by the dugout, we were shocked to see the body of a French lieuten=
ant laid ready for=20

burial. He had met death while we played the fool in our twenty minutes' wa=
lk.  We rode to=20

Recicourt greatly sobered, and it was hours before we could get back our sp=
irit. Of course,=20

eventually, kind hands pinned up the rent in the corsage of those khaki tro=
users. They used a=20

dozen big steel safety pins as large as railway spikes. And that night as w=
e were preparing for bed=20

in a shack near a hospital, Henry gazed curiously at the job as it glittere=
d before him in our corner,=20

when, his friend's tunic being removed, the wealth of metal was uncovered. =
Henry was impressed.=20

"Bill," he said gently, as he gazed admiringly at his friend's armour, "I d=
on't know as I ever saw a=20

man before with so much open plumbing on him as you're wearing these days!"=
  For a long time=20

we lay awake and talked about the day's experience, and particularly our ha=
lf day under fire. We=20

agreed that really it was not so bad. We were scared--badly scared; but we =
could laugh at it, even=20

at the hottest of it, and it was never so exceedingly hot. Yet we might hav=
e been killed. Thousands=20

who died, went out in just such mild places as we had been through, and pro=
bably went out=20

laughing their independence, retired without a struggle; others, of whom th=
e most powerful chiefs=20

had been gained, joined the missions. Where there was no church, they conte=
nted themselves=20

with erecting a great cross of red wood, close to which they constructed a =
casa fuerte, or block-

house, the walls of which were formed of large beams resting horizontally u=
pon each other. This=20

house had two stories; in the upper story two cannon of small calibre were =
placed; and two=20

soldiers lived on the ground-floor, and were served by an Indian family. Th=
ose of the natives with=20

whom they were at peace cultivated spots of land round the casa fuerte. The=
 soldiers called them=20

together by the sound of the horn, or a botuto of baked earth, whenever any=
 hostile attack was=20

dreaded. Such were the pretended nineteen Christian settlements founded by =
Don Antonio Santos=20

in the way from Esmeralda to the Erevato. Military posts, which had no infl=
uence on the civilization=20

of the natives, figured on the maps, and in the works of the missionaries, =
as villages (pueblos) and=20

reducciones apostolicas.* (* Signifying apostolic conquests or conversions.=
) The preponderance of=20

the military was maintained on the banks of the Orinoco till 1785, when the=
 system of the monks of=20

San Francisco began. The small number of missions founded, or rather re-est=
ablished, since that=20

period, owe their existence to the Fathers of the Observance; for the soldi=
ers now distributed=20

among the missions are dependent on the missionaries, or at least are reput=
ed to be so, according=20

to the pretensions of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  The Indians whom we fo=
und at San Francisco=20

Solano were of two nations; Pacimonales and Cheruvichahenas. The latter bei=
ng descended from=20

a considerable tribe settled on the Rio Tomo, near the Manivas of the Upper=
 Guainia, I tried to=20

gather from them some ideas respecting the upper course and the sources of =
the Rio Negro; but=20

the=20


_
an inch one way or another of the German's gun. Our Wichita and Emporia sol=
diers, we said,=20

would doubtless live days and weeks under what we had seen and would grow f=
at on it. Then=20

Henry mused: "I wonder if that young French lieutenant there in the woods w=
ent out smiling!" And=20

then for a long time no one spoke, and at last we slept.  [Illustration: So=
 we went back--me holding=20

those khaki trousers up by sheer force of will and both hands!]     CHAPTER=
 IV  WHEREIN WE=20

FIND THAT "OUR FLAG IS STILL THERE"   This chapter will contain the story o=
f our visit to=20

General Pershing and the American troops. But before we came to that part o=
f whom I employed=20

could not make them comprehend my questions. Their continually-repeated ans=
wer was, that the=20

sources of the Rio Negro and the Inirida were as near to each other as "two=
 fingers of the hand."=20

In one of the huts of the Pacimonales we purchased two fine large birds, a =
toucan (piapoco) and=20

an ana, a species of macaw, seventeen inches long, having the whole body of=
 a purple colour. We=20

had already in our canoe seven parrots, two manakins (pipa), a motmot, two =
guans, or pavas de=20

ys, namely, two=20

ateles,* (* Marimonda of the Great Cataracts, Simia=20
