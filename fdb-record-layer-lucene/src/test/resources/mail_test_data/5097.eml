Well, she would be more sorry to say farewell to her friends than they would ever appreciate. 

Besides, she must go away from the Red Cross hospital without the inspiration and the aid she 

had hoped to receive from her contact with a group of American girls. How much she had hoped to 

learn from the example of their courage. Surely some of them must have broken away from family 

traditions in coming from their own homes into foreign lands to nurse the wounded! And she had 

dreamed she might learn to follow their example.  But how quiet the house seemed at present. It 

was strange to recall that her accident had brought her to this house where her mother had lived 

as a girl, a house which had been a part of her inheritance from her mother, although she had 

rarely been inside it.  If only one of the Red Cross girls would come and talk with the following 

which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) 

alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any 

Defect you cause.  Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project 

Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by 

the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists 

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. 

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to 

reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will 

remain freely available for generations to come. In

was so little time left when this would be possible and she so dreaded her own society. What 

would she do when she returned to the old narrowness of her past existence with the eternal 

disagreements?  Never except when she was outdoors could Charlotta endure being alone.  For 

the first time since her accident the little countess was almost completely dressed in a brown 

costume which Bianca had with great difficulty adjusted over her injured arm.  Walking to her door 

Charlotta opened it, glancing out into the wide hall.  If she had thought to mention it to Mrs. Clark, 

she would surely have gained permission to wander over this floor of her mother's former home. 

As a matter of fact, she had not been inside the place for a number of years, as the property she 

had inherited from her mother was in the hands of a business agent.  Stepping out into the wide 

hall Charlotta started toward the front window which overlooked the grounds. In a moment, 

however, she saw that the space Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a 

secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more

American officer was seated there letting the sunlight stream over him.  Undismayed Charlotta 

walked forward.  "You have been ill and are better, I am glad," she said simply.  She had a curious 

lack of self-consciousness and a friendliness which was very charming.  The young officer 

attempted to rise.  "Why, yes, I am better, thank you. I have been stupidly ill from an attack of 

influenza just as my men were on the march toward Germany and I should have given anything in 

the world to have been able to go along with them. However, I must not grumble. I am right again 

so you need not be afraid of me. We have been kept pretty well isolated from you. But won't you 

have this chair?"  The girl shook her head.  "You are very kind and you can be quite certain I am 

not afraid of you. Sit down again, I know you will refuse to confess it, but you do look pretty weak 

still. And there is nothing the matter with me. Oh, I volunteers and employees are scattered

particularly important to maintaining tax

few bruises and a broken arm, but after all they are not serious. I wonder now what I was actually 

trying to do when I flung myself off my horse. Have you ever been desperate enough not to care 

what happened to you?"  "But you don't mean, Countess Charlotta--"  "How do you know my 

name?" the girl answered quickly, as if wishing to forget what she had just confessed. "Are you not 

Major James Hersey, one of the youngest majors in the United States overseas service? I think I 

have been hearing a good deal of you from Bianca Zoli and the other Red Cross girls."  Major 

Jimmie Hersey colored through his pallor, according to his annoying boyish habit.  "Well, Countess

house, your guests in a fashion. We have seldom had so romantic an experience as having a 

countess as a patient along with the American doughboys and in the selfsame hospital. But I really 

can't sit here and talk to you while you stand. At least you will let me bring you a chair?"  With a 

good deal of satisfaction Charlotta nodded her head, her hair showing even duskier in contrast 

with the white bandage over her forehead.  Talking to American girls she had found extraordinarily 

entertaining, but to talk to a young American officer  International donations are gratefully 

accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received
