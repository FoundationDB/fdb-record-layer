dracaena marginata himself or by Fleury the captain of the Marats. Why! eve=
n I, when I brought the Kernogans in overland from Le Croisic, I was detain=
ed two hours outside Nantes while my papers were sent in to Carrier for ins=
pection. You know that, you were with me."  "I know it," replied Chauvelin =
drily, "and yet...."  He paused, with one between him and something worse--=
but of that, more hereafter.  Starving men are not particular.  That day Da=
n did what he would have believed to have been, in him, an impossibility--h=
e drank the blood of the bird and ate its flesh raw!  "After all," thought =
he, while engaged in this half-cannibalistic deed, "what's the dracaena mar=
ginata himself or by Fleury the captain of the Marats. Why! even I, when I =
brought the Kernogans in overland from Le Croisic, I was detained two hours=
 outside Nantes while my papers were sent in to Carrier for inspection. You=
 know that, you were with me."  "I know it," replied Chauvelin drily, "and =
yet...."  He paused, with one between him and something worse--but of that,=
 more hereafter.  Starving men are not particular.  That day Dan did what h=
e would have believed to have been, in him, an impossibility--he drank the =
blood of the bird and ate its flesh raw!  "After all," thought he, while en=
gaged in this half-cannibalistic deed, "what's the _
the wilds of Somersetshire, I warned you that not only was your identity kn=
own to the man who=20

calls himself the Scarlet Pimpernel, but also that he knew every one of you=
r plans with regard to=20

the Kernogan wench and her father. You laughed at me then ... do you rememb=
er?... you=20

shrugged your shoulders and jeered at what you call my far-fetched ideas ..=
. just as you do now.=20

Well! will you let me remind you of what happened within four-and-twenty ho=
urs of that warning=20

which you chose to disregard? ... Yvonne de Kernogan was married to Lord An=
thony Dewhurst=20

and...."  "I know all that, man," broke in Martin-Roget impatiently. "It wa=
s all a mere coincidence ...=20

the marriage must have been planned long before that ... your Scarlet Pimpe=
rnel could not=20

possibly have had anything to do with it."  "Perhaps not," rejoined Chauvel=
in drily. "But mark what=20

has happened since. Just now when we crossed the Place I saw in the distanc=
e a figure flitting=20

past--the gorgeous figure of an exquisite who of a surety is a stranger in =
Nantes: and carried upon=20

the wings of the north-westerly wind there came to me the sound of a voice =
which, of late, I have=20

only heard in my dreams. On my soul, citizen Martin-Roget," he added with e=
arnest emphasis, "I=20

assure you that the Scarlet Pimpernel is in Nantes at the present moment, t=
hat he is scheming,=20

plotting, planning to rescue the Kernogan wench out of your clutches. He wi=
ll not leave her in your=20

power, on this I would stake my life; she is the wife of one of his dearest=
 friends: he will not=20

abandon her, not while he keeps that resourceful head of his on his shoulde=
rs. Unless you are=20

desperately abortive.  Fortunately the weather was warm, so that he did not=
 suffer from cold.=20

While he was yet labouring assiduously to accomplish his purpose, the whir =
of wings was heard=20

overhead.  Glancing quickly up, he perceived that a small flock of willow-g=
rouse had settled on the=20

bushes close to him.  He was not surprised, though very thankful, for these=
 birds were numerous=20

enough and he had heard them flying about from time to time, but that they =
should settle down so=20

near was exceedingly opportune and unexpected.  With eager haste and cautio=
n he rammed=20

home the charge he had so recently withdrawn--keeping his eyes fixed longin=
gly on the game all=20

the time.  That the birds saw him was obvious, for they kept turning their =
heads from side to side=20

and looking down at him with curiosity.  By good fortune grouse of this kin=
d are sometimes very=20

stupid as well as tame. They did not take alarm at Dan's motions, but crane=
d their necks and=20

seemed to eye him with considerable curiosity.  Even when he tried to take =
aim at them their=20

general aspect suggested that they were asking, mentally, "What next?"  But=
 Dan found that he=20

could not aim.  The point of the gun wavered around as it might have done i=
n the hands of a child.=20

With a short--almost contemptuous--laugh at his ridiculous incapacity, Dan =
lowered the gun.=20

Stupid as they were, the laugh was too much for the birds.  They spread the=
ir wings.  "Now or=20

never!" exclaimed Dan aloud.  He pointed his gun straight at the flock; too=
k no aim, and fired!  The=20

result was that a plump specimen dropped almost at his feet.  If he had bee=
n able to cheer he=20

would have done so.  But he was=20


_
alive."  "Bah! you have been dreaming, citizen Chauvelin," rejoined Martin-=
Roget with a laugh and=20

shrugging his broad shoulders; "your mysterious Englishman in Nantes? Why m=
an! the navigation=20

of the Loire has been totally prohibited these last fourteen days--no carri=
age, van or vehicle of any=20

kind is allowed to enter the city--no man, woman or child to pass the thank=
ed God, fervently,=20

instead.  Again the poor man essayed to kindle a fire, but in trying to do =
this with gunpowder he=20

made the startling discovery that he had only one more charge in his powder=
-horn.  He therefore=20

re-loaded his gun, wiped out the pan and primed with care, feeling that thi=
s might be the last thing=20

that would stand between him and starvation.=20
