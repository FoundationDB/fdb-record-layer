the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment on the gen=
uineness of the=20

extant dialogue.  Neither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to=
 draw an absolute line of=20

demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato. They fade off i=
mperceptibly from one=20

class to another. There may have been degrees of genuineness in the dialogu=
es themselves, as=20

there are certainly degrees of evidence by which they are supported. The tr=
aditions of the oral=20

discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of semi-Pla=
tonic writings; some=20

of them may be of the same mixed character which is apparent in Aristotle a=
nd Hippocrates,=20

although the form of them is different. But the writings of Plato, unlike t=
he writings of Aristotle,=20

seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples: this w=
as probably due to their=20

definite form, and to their inimitable excellence. The three dialogues whic=
h we have offered in the=20

Appendix to the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly g=
enuine; they may be=20

altogether spurious;--that is an alternative which must be frankly admitted=
. Nor can we maintain of=20

some other dialogues, such as the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicu=
s, that no=20

considerable objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanc=
ed by the weight=20

(chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour. Nor, on the other hand, can=
 we exclude a bare=20

possibility that some dialogues which are usually rejected, such as the Gre=
ater Hippias and the=20

Cleitophon, may be genuine. The nature and object of these semi-Platonic wr=
itings require more=20

careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with forged=
 writings in general,=20

than they have yet received, before we can finally decide on their characte=
r. We do not consider=20

them all as genuine until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often ma=
intained and still more=20

often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some of th=
em, that their=20

genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until further evidence about th=
em can be adduced.=20

And we are as confident that the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republi=
c, the Timaeus, and the=20

Laws are genuine.  On the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which=
 pass under the name=20

of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves and t=
wo or three other=20

plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by those who are willing to all=
ow that a considerable=20

change and growth may have taken place in his philosophy (see above). That =
twentieth debatable=20

portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a t=
hinker or a writer, and=20

though suggesting some interesting questions to the scholar and critic, is =
of little importance to the=20

general reader.     LESSER HIPPIAS     INTRODUCTION.  The Lesser Hippias ma=
y be compared=20

with the earlier dialogues of Plato, in which the contrast of Socrates and =
the Sophists is most=20

strongly exhibited. Hippias, like Protagoras and Gorgias, though civil, is =
vain and boastful: he=20

knows all things; he can make anything, including his own clothes; he is a =
manufacturer of poems=20

and declamations, and also of seal-rings, shoes, strigils; his girdle, whic=
h he has woven himself, is=20

of a finer than Persian quality. He is a vainer, lighter nature than the tw=
o great Sophists (compare=20

Protag.), but of the same character with them, and equally impatient of the=
 short cut-and-thrust=20

method of Socrates, whom he endeavours to draw into a long oration. At last=
, he gets tired of=20

being defeated at every point by Socrates, and is with difficulty induced t=
o proceed (compare=20

Thrasymachus, Protagoras, Callicles, and others, to whom the same reluctanc=
e is ascribed).=20

Hippias like Protagoras has common sense on his side, when he argues, citin=
g passages of the=20

Iliad in support of his view, that Homer intended Achilles to be the braves=
t, Odysseus the wisest of=20

the Greeks. But he is easily overthrown by the superior dialectics of Socra=
tes, who pretends to=20



show that Achilles is not true to his word, and that no similar inconsisten=
cy is to be found in=20

Odysseus. Hippias replies that Achilles unintentionally, but Odysseus inten=
tionally, speaks=20

falsehood. But is it better to do wrong intentionally or unintentionally? S=
ocrates, relying on the=20

analogy of the arts, maintains the former, Hippias the latter of the two al=
ternatives...All this is quite=20

conceived in the spirit of Plato, who is very far from making Socrates alwa=
ys argue on the side of=20

truth. The over-reasoning on Homer, which is of course satirical, is also i=
n the spirit of Plato.=20

Poetry turned logic is even more ridiculous than 'rhetoric turned logic,' a=
nd equally fallacious.=20

There were reasoners in ancient as well as in modern times, who could never=
 receive the natural=20

impression of Homer, or of any other book which they read. The argument of =
Socrates, in which=20

he picks out the apparent inconsistencies and discrepancies in the speech a=
nd actions of Achilles,=20

and the final paradox, 'that he who is true is also false,' remind us of th=
e interpretation by Socrates=20

of Simonides in the Protagoras, and of similar reasonings in the first book=
 of the Republic. The=20

discrepancies which Socrates discovers in the words of Achilles are perhaps=
 as great as those=20

discovered by some of the modern separatists of the Homeric poems...  At la=
st, Socrates having=20

caught Hippias in the toils of the voluntary and involuntary, is obliged to=
 confess that he is=20

wandering about in the same labyrinth; he makes the reflection on himself w=
hich others would=20

make upon him (compare Protagoras). He does not wonder that he should be in=
 a difficulty, but he=20

wonders at Hippias, and he becomes sensible of the gravity of the situation=
, when ordinary men=20

like himself can no longer go to the wise and be taught by them.  It may be=
 remarked as bearing=20

on the genuineness of this dialogue: (1) that the manners of the speakers a=
re less subtle and=20

refined than in the other dialogues of Plato; (2) that the sophistry of Soc=
rates is more palpable and=20

unblushing, and also more unmeaning; (3) that many turns of thought and sty=
le are found in it=20

which appear also in the other dialogues:--whether resemblances of this kin=
d tell in favour of or=20

against the genuineness of an ancient writing, is an important question whi=
ch will have to be=20

answered differently in different cases. For that a writer may repeat himse=
lf is as true as that a=20

forger may imitate; and Plato elsewhere, either of set purpose or from forg=
etfulness, is full of=20

repetitions. The parallelisms of the Lesser Hippias, as already remarked, a=
re not of the kind which=20

necessarily imply that the dialogue is the work of a forger. The parallelis=
ms of the Greater Hippias=20

with the other dialogues, and the allusion to the Lesser (where Hippias ske=
tches the programme of=20

his next lecture, and invites Socrates to attend and bring any almost every=
thing else.  He felt that=20

he could now spare a certain percentage of his time to follow Theodore Roos=
evelt's ideas and let=20

the breezes of other worlds blow over him.  In that way he could do as Roos=
evelt suggested and=20

as Bok now firmly believed was right: he could develop himself along broade=
r lines, albeit the lines=20

of his daily work were broadening in and of themselves, and he could so dev=
elop a new set of=20

inner resources upon which he could draw when the time came to relinquish h=
is editorial position.=20

He saw, on every side, the pathetic figures of men who could not let go aft=
er their greatest=20

usefulness was past; of other men who dropped before they realized their ar=
rival at the end of the=20

road; and, most pathetic of all, of men who having retired, but because of =
lack of inner resources=20

did not know what to do with themselves, had become a trial to themselves, =
their families, and=20

their communities.  Bok decided that, given health and mental freshness, he=
 would say good-by to=20

his public before his public might decide to say good-by to him.  So, at fo=
rty, he candidly faced the=20

facts of life and began to prepare himself for his retirement at fifty unde=
r circumstances that would=20



be of his own making and not those of others.  And thereby Edward Bok prove=
d that he was still,=20

by instinct, a Dutchman, and had not in his thirty-four years of residence =
in the United States=20

become so thoroughly Americanized as he believed.  However, it was an Ameri=
can, albeit of=20

Dutch extraction, one whom he believed to be the greatest American in his o=
wn day, who had set=20

him thinking and shown him the way.     CHAPTER XVII  THE PRESIDENT AND THE=
 BOY  One=20

of the incidents connected with Edward Bok that Theodore Roosevelt never fo=
rgot was when=20

Bok's eldest boy chose the Colonel as a Christmas present.  And no incident=
 better portrays the=20

wonderful character of the Colonel than did his remarkable response to the =
compliment.  A vicious=20

attack of double pneumonia had left the heart of the boy very weak--and Chr=
istmas was close by!=20

So the father said:  "It's a quiet Christmas for you this year, boy.  Suppo=
se you do this: think of the=20

one thing in the world that you would rather have than anything else and I'=
ll give you that, and that=20

will have to be your Christmas."  "I know now," came the instant reply.  "B=
ut the world is a big=20

place, and there are lots of things in it, you know."  "I know that," said =
the boy, "but this is=20

something I have wanted for a long time, and would rather have than anythin=
g else in the world."=20

And he looked as if he meant it.  "Well, out with it, then, if you're so su=
re."  And to the father's=20

astonished ears came this request:  "Take me to Washington as soon as my he=
art is all right,=20

introduce me to President Roosevelt, and let me shake hands with him."  "Al=
l right," said the=20

father, after recovering from his surprise. "I'll see whether I can fix it.=
"  And that morning a letter=20

went to the President saying that he had been chosen as a Christmas present=
. Naturally, any man=20

would have felt pleased, no matter how high his station, and for Theodore R=
oosevelt, father of=20

boys, the message had a special appeal.  The letter had no sooner reached W=
ashington than=20

back came an answer, addressed not to the father but to the boy!  It read: =
  The White House,=20

Washington.  November 13th, 1907.  DEAR CURTIS:  Your father has just writt=
en me, and I want=20

him to bring you on and shake hands with me as soon as you are well enough =
to travel.  Then I=20

am going to give you, myself, a copy of the book containing my hunting trip=
s since I have been=20

President; unless you will wait until the new edition, which contains two m=
ore chapters, is out.  If=20

so, I will send it to you, as this new edition probably won't be ready when=
 you come on here.  Give=20

my warm regards to your father and mother.  Sincerely yours,  THEODORE ROOS=
EVELT.   Here=20

was joy serene!  But the boy's heart had acted queerly for a few days, and =
so the father wrote,=20

thanked the President, and said that as soon as the heart moderated a bit t=
he letter would be=20

given the boy. It was a rare bit of consideration that now followed.  No so=
oner had the father's=20

letter reached the White House than an answer came back by first post--this=
 time with a special-

delivery stamp on it.  It was Theodore Roosevelt, the father, who wrote thi=
s time; his mind and=20

time filled with affairs of state, and yet full of tender thoughtfulness fo=
r a little boy:   DEAR MR.=20

BOK:--  I have your letter of the 16th instant.  I hope the little fellow w=
ill soon be all right.  Instead=20

of giving him my letter, give him a message from me based on the letter, if=
 that will be better for=20

him.  Tell Mrs. Bok how deeply Mrs. Roosevelt and I sympathize with her.  W=
e know just how she=20

feels.  Sincerely yours,  THEODORE ROOSEVELT.   "That's pretty fine conside=
ration," said the=20

father.  He got the letter during a business conference and he read it alou=
d to the group of=20

business men.  Some there were in that group who keenly differed with the P=
resident on national=20

issues, but they were all fathers, and two of the sturdiest turned and walk=
ed to the window as they=20

said:  "Yes, that is fine!"  Then came the boy's pleasure when he was hande=
d the letter; the next=20



few days were spent inditing an answer to "my friend, the President." At la=
st the momentous=20

epistle seemed satisfactory, and off to the busy presidential desk went the=
 boyish note, full of=20

thanks and assurances that he would come just as soon as he could, and that=
 Mr. Roosevelt must=20

not get impatient!  The "soon as he could" time, however, did not come as q=
uickly as all had=20

hoped!--a little heart pumped for days full of oxygen and accelerated by hy=
podermic injections is=20

slow to mend.  But the President's framed letter, hanging on the spot on th=
e wall first seen in the=20

morning, was a daily consolation.  Then, in March, although four months aft=
er the promise--and it=20

would not have been strange, in his busy life, for the President to have fo=
rgotten or at least=20

overlooked it--on the very day that the book was published came a special "=
large-paper" copy of=20

_The Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter_, and on the fly-leaf there gre=
eted the boy, in the=20

President's own hand:   To MASTER CURTIS BOK,  With the best wishes of his =
friend,=20

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.  March 11, 1908.   The boy's cup was now full, and so s=
aid his letter=20

to the President. And the President wrote back to the father: "I am really =
immensely amused and=20

interested, and shall be mighty glad to see the little fellow."  In the spr=
ing, on a beautiful May day,=20

came the great moment.  The mother had to go along, the boy insisted, to se=
e the great event,=20

and so the trio found themselves shaking the hand of the President's secret=
ary at the White=20

House.  "Oh, the President is looking for you, all right," he said to the b=
oy, and then the next=20

moment the three were in a large room.  Mr.=20


_
more than suspicious:--they are of a very poor sort, such as we cannot supp=
ose to have been due=20

to Plato himself. The Greater Hippias more resembles the Euthydemus than an=
y other dialogue;=20

but is immeasurably inferior to it. The Lesser Hippias seems to have more m=
erit than the Greater,=20

and to be more Platonic in spirit. The character of Hippias is the same in =
both dialogues, but his=20

vanity and boasting are even more exaggerated in the Greater Hippias. His a=
rt of memory is=20

specially mentioned in both. He is an inferior type of the same species as =
Hippodamus of Miletus=20

(Arist. Pol.). Some passages in which the Lesser Hippias may be advantageou=
sly compared with=20

the undoubtedly genuine dialogues of Plato are the following:--Less. Hipp.:=
 compare Republic=20

(Socrates' cunning in argument): compare Laches (Socrates' feeling about ar=
guments): compare=20

Republic (Socrates not unthankful): compare Republic (Socrates dishonest in=
 argument).  The=20

Lesser Hippias, though inferior to the other dialogues, may be reasonably b=
elieved to have been=20

written by Plato, on the ground (1) of considerable excellence; (2) of unif=
orm tradition beginning=20

with Aristotle and his school. That the dialogue falls below the standard o=
f Plato's other works, or=20

that he has attributed to Socrates an unmeaning paradox (perhaps with the v=
iew of showing that=20

he could beat the Sophists at their own weapons; or that he could 'make the=
 worse appear the=20

better cause'; or merely as a dialectical experiment)--are not sufficient r=
easons for doubting the=20

genuineness of the work.     PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Eudicus, Socrates, Hi=
ppias.=20

EUDICUS: Why are you silent, Socrates, after the magnificent display which =
Hippias has been=20

making? Why do you not either refute his words, if he seems to you to have =
been wrong in any=20

point, or join with us in commending him? There is the more reason why you =
should speak,=20

because we are now alone, and the audience is confined to those who may fai=
rly claim to take part=20

in a philosophical discussion.  SOCRATES: I should greatly like, Eudicus, t=
o ask Hippias the=20

meaning of what he was saying just now about Homer. I have heard your fathe=
r, Apemantus,=20

declare that the Iliad of Homer is a finer poem than the Odyssey in the sam=
e degree that Achilles=20

was a better man than Odysseus; Odysseus, he would say, is the central figu=
re of the one poem=20

and Achilles of the other. Now, I should like to know, if Hippias has no ob=
jection to tell me, what he=20

thinks about these two heroes, and which of them he maintains to be the bet=
ter; he has already=20

told us in the course of his exhibition many things of various kinds about =
Homer and divers other=20

poets.  EUDICUS: I am sure that Hippias will be delighted to answer anythin=
g which you would like=20

to ask; tell me, Hippias, if Socrates asks you a question, will you answer =
him?  HIPPIAS: Indeed,=20

Eudicus, I should be strangely inconsistent if I refused to answer Socrates=
, when at each Olympic=20

festival, as I went up from my house at Elis to the temple of Olympia, wher=
e all the Hellenes were=20

assembled, I continually professed my willingness to perform any of the exh=
ibitions which I had=20

prepared, and to answer any questions which any one had to ask.  SOCRATES: =
Truly, Hippias,=20

you are to be congratulated, if at every Olympic festival you have such an =
encouraging opinion of=20

your own wisdom when you go up to the temple. I doubt whether any muscular =
hero would be so=20

fearless and confident in offering his body to the combat at Olympia, as yo=
u are in offering your=20

mind.  HIPPIAS: And with good reason, Socrates; for since the day when I fi=
rst entered the lists at=20

Olympia I have never found any man who was my with a "Well, well, and so th=
is is my friend=20

Curtis!" the two stood looking into each other's faces, each fairly wreathe=
d in smiles, and each=20

industriously shaking the hand of the other.  "Yes, Mr. President, I'm migh=
ty glad to see you!" said=20

the boy.  "I am glad to see you, Curtis," returned Mr. Roosevelt.  Then the=
re came a white rose=20



from the presidential desk for the mother, but after that father and mother=
 might as well have faded=20

away.  Nobody existed save the President and the boy.  The anteroom was ful=
l; in the Cabinet-

room a delegation waited to be addressed.  But affairs of state were at a c=
omplete standstill as,=20

with boyish zeal, the President became oblivious to all but the boy before =
him.  "Now, Curtis, I've=20

got some pictures here of bears that a friend of mine has just shot.  Look =
at that whopper, fifteen=20

hundred pounds--that's as much as a horse weighs, you know.  Now, my friend=
 shot him"--and it=20

was a toss-up who was the more keenly interested, the real boy or the man-b=
oy, as picture after=20

picture came out and bear adventure crowded upon the heels of bear adventur=
e.  "Gee, he's a=20

corker, all right!" came from the boy at one point, and then, from the Pres=
ident: "That's right, he is=20

a corker.  Now you see his head here"--and then both were off again.  The p=
rivate secretary came=20

in at this point and whispered in the President's ear.  "I know, I know.  I=
'll see him later.  Say that I=20

am very busy now." And the face beamed with smiles.  "Now, Mr. President--"=
 began the father.=20

"No, sir; no, sir; not at all.  Affairs can wait.  This is a long-standing =
engagement between Curtis=20

and me, and that must come first.  Isn't that so, Curtis?"  Of course the b=
oy agreed.  Suddenly the=20

boy looked around the room and said:  "Where's your gun, Mr. President?  Go=
t it here?"  "No,"=20

laughingly came from the President, "but I'll tell you"--and then the two h=
eads were together again.=20

A moment for breath-taking came, and the boy said:  "Aren't you ever afraid=
 of being shot?"  "You=20

mean while I am hunting?"  "Oh, no.  I mean as President."  "No," replied t=
he smiling President.=20

"I'll tell you, Curtis; I'm too busy to think about that.  I have too many =
things to do to bother about=20

anything of that sort.  When I was in battle I was always too anxious to ge=
t to the front to think=20

about the shots.  And here--well, here I'm too busy too.  Never think about=
 it.  But I'll tell you,=20

Curtis, there are some men down there," pointing out of the window in the d=
irection of the capitol,=20

"called the Congress, and if they would only give me the four battleships I=
 want, I'd be perfectly=20

willing to have any one take a crack at me."  Then, for the first time reco=
gnizing the existence of=20

the parents, the President said: "And I don't know but if they did pick me =
off I'd be pretty well=20

ahead of the game."  Just in that moment only did the boy-knowing President=
 get a single inch=20

above the boy-interest.  It was astonishing to see the natural accuracy wit=
h which the man gauged=20

the boy-level.  "Now, how would you like to see a bear, Curtis?" came next,=
 "I know where there's=20

a beauty, twelve hundred pounds."  "Must be some bear!" interjected the boy=
.  "That's what it is,"=20

put in the President.  "Regular cinnamon-brown type"--and then off went the=
 talk to the big bear at=20

the Washington "Zoo" where the President was to send the boy.  Then, after =
a little; "Now, Curtis,=20

see those men over there in that room.  They've travelled from all parts of=
 the country to come=20

here at my invitation, and I've got to make a little speech to them, and I'=
ll do that while you go off to=20

see the bear."  And then the hand came forth to say good-by.  The boy put=
=20


_
SOCRATES: What an ornament, Hippias, will the reputation of your wisdom be =
to the city of Elis=20

and to your parents! But to return: what say you of Odysseus and Achilles? =
Which is the better of=20

the two? and in what particular does either surpass the other? For when you=
 were exhibiting and=20

there was company in the room, though I could not follow you, I did not lik=
e to ask what you=20

meant, because a crowd of people were present, and I was afraid that the qu=
estion might interrupt=20

your exhibition. But now that there are not so many of us, and my friend Eu=
dicus bids me ask, I=20

wish you would tell me what you were saying about these two heroes, so that=
 I may clearly=20

understand; how did you distinguish them?  HIPPIAS: I shall have much pleas=
ure, Socrates, in=20

explaining to you more clearly than I could in public my views about these =
and also about other=20

heroes. I say that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest of the men who=
 went to Troy, Nestor=20

the wisest, and Odysseus the wiliest.  SOCRATES: O rare Hippias, will you b=
e so good as not to=20

laugh, if I find a difficulty in following you, and repeat my questions sev=
eral times over? Please to=20

answer me kindly and gently. each looked into the other's face, and on neit=
her was there a place=20

big enough to put a ten-cent piece that was not wreathed in smiles.  "He ce=
rtainly is all right," said=20

the boy to the father, looking wistfully after the President.  Almost to th=
e other room had the=20

President gone when he, too, instinctively looked back to find the boy foll=
owing him with his eyes.=20

He stopped, wheeled around, and then the two instinctively sought each othe=
r again.   The=20

President came back, the boy went forward.  This time each held out both ha=
nds, and as each=20

looked once more into the other's eyes a world of complete understanding wa=
s in both faces, and=20

every looker-on smiled with them.  "Good-by, Curtis," came at last from the=
 President.  "Good-by,=20

Mr. President," came from the boy.  Then, with another pump-handly shake an=
d with a "Gee, but=20

he's great, all right!" the boy went out to see the cinnamon-bear at the "Z=
oo," and to live it all over=20

in the days to come.  Two boy-hearts had met, although one of them belonged=
 to the President of=20

the United States.     CHAPTER XVIII  ADVENTURES IN MUSIC  One of the misfo=
rtunes of=20

Edward Bok's training, which he realized more clearly as=20


_
HIPPIAS: I should be greatly ashamed of myself, Socrates, if I, who teach o=
thers and take money=20

of them, could not, when I was asked by you, answer in a civil and agreeabl=
e manner.=20

SOCRATES: Thank you: the fact is, that I seemed to understand what you mean=
t when you said=20

that the poet intended Achilles to be the bravest of men, and also that he =
intended Nestor to be=20

the wisest; but when you said that he meant Odysseus to be life.  His mothe=
r did not play; and=20

aside from the fact that his father and mother were patrons of the opera du=
ring their residence in=20

The Netherlands, the musical atmosphere was lacking in his home.  He realiz=
ed how welcome an=20

outlet music might be in his now busy life.  So what he lacked himself and =
realized as a distinct=20

omission in his own life he decided to make possible for others.  _The Ladi=
es' Home Journal_=20

began to=20


_
could not understand what you were saying. Will you tell me, and then I sha=
ll perhaps understand=20

you better; has not Homer made Achilles wily?  HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socr=
ates; he is the most=20

straight-forward of mankind, and when Homer introduces them talking with on=
e another in the=20

passage called the Prayers, Achilles is supposed by the poet to say to Odys=
seus:--  'Son of=20

Laertes, sprung from heaven, crafty Odysseus, I will speak out plainly the =
word which I intend to=20

carry out in act, and which will, I believe, be accomplished. For I hate hi=
m like the gates of death=20

who thinks one thing and says another. But I will speak that which shall be=
 accomplished.'  Now, in=20

these verses he clearly indicates the character of the two men; he shows Ac=
hilles to be true and=20

simple, and Odysseus to be wily and false; for he supposes Achilles to be a=
ddressing Odysseus in=20

these lines.  SOCRATES: Now, Hippias, I first caught the eye and ear of its=
 public by presenting=20

the popular new marches by John Philip Sousa; and when the comic opera of "=
Robin Hood"=20

became the favorite of the day, it secured all the new compositions by Regi=
nald de Koven.=20

Following these, it introduced its readers to new compositions by Sir Arthu=
r Sullivan, Tosti,=20

Moszkowski, Richard Strauss, Paderewski, Josef Hofmann, Edouard Strauss, an=
d Mascagni.  Bok=20

induced Josef Hofmann to give a series of piano lessons in his magazine, an=
d Madame Marchesi=20

a series of vocal lessons.  _The Journal_ introduced its readers to all the=
 great instrumental and=20

vocal artists of the day through articles; it offered prizes for the best p=
iano and vocal compositions;=20

it had the leading critics of New York, Boston, and Chicago write articles =
explanatory of orchestral=20

music and how to listen to music.  Bok was early attracted by the abilities=
 of Josef=20


_
say that Odysseus is wily, you clearly mean that he is false?  HIPPIAS: Exa=
ctly so, Socrates; it is=20

the character of Odysseus, as he is represented by Homer in many passages b=
oth of the Iliad and=20

Odyssey.  SOCRATES: And Homer must be presumed to have meant that the true =
man is not the=20

same as the false?  HIPPIAS: Of course, Socrates.  SOCRATES: And is that yo=
ur own opinion,=20

Hippias?  HIPPIAS: Certainly; how can I have any other?  SOCRATES: Well, th=
en, as there is no=20

possibility of asking Homer what he meant in these verses of his, let us le=
ave him; but as you=20

show a willingness to take up his cause, and your opinion agrees with what =
you declare to be his,=20

will you answer on behalf of yourself and him?  HIPPIAS: I will; ask shortl=
y anything which you=20

like.  SOCRATES: Do you say that the false, like the sick, have no power to=
 do things, or that they=20

have the power to do things?  HIPPIAS: I should say that they have power to=
 do many things, and=20

in particular to deceive mankind.  SOCRATES: Then, met the pianist, who was=
 then twenty-two=20

years old.  Of his musical ability Bok could not judge, but he was much imp=
ressed by his unusual=20

mentality, and soon both learned and felt that Hofmann's art was deeply and=
 firmly rooted.=20

Hofmann had a wider knowledge of affairs than other musicians whom Bok had =
met; he had not=20

narrowed his interests to his own art.  He was striving to achieve a positi=
on in his art, and, finding=20

that he had literary ability, Bok asked him to write a reminiscent article =
on his famous master,=20

Rubinstein.  This was followed by other articles; the publication of his ne=
w mazurka; still further=20

articles; and then, in 1907, Bok offered him a regular department in the ma=
gazine and a salaried=20

editorship on his staff.  Bok's musical friends and the music critics tried=
 to convince the editor that=20

Hofmann's art lay not so deep as Bok imagined; that he had been a child pro=
digy, and would end=20

where all child prodigies invariably end--opinions which make curious readi=
ng now in view of=20


_
they not?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And are they wily, and do they deceive =
by reason of their=20

simplicity and folly, or by reason of their cunning and a certain sort of p=
rudence?  HIPPIAS: By=20

reason of their cunning and prudence, most certainly.  SOCRATES: Then they =
are prudent, I=20

suppose?  HIPPIAS: So they lacked musical knowledge, his instinct led him t=
o adhere to his belief=20

in Hofmann; and for twelve years, until Bok's retirement as editor, the pia=
nist was a regular=20

contributor to the magazine.  His success was, of course, unquestioned.  He=
 answered hundreds=20

of questions sent him by his readers, and these=20
