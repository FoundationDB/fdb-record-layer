ACE   During the last years=20

of his life, Professor Morgan had devoted much time and energy to the prepa=
ration of a translation=20

of Vitruvius, which he proposed to supplement with a revised text, illustra=
tions, and notes. He had=20

completed the translation, with the exception of the last four chapters of =
the tenth book, and had=20

discussed, with Professor Warren, the illustrations intended for the first =
six books of the work; the=20

notes had not been arranged or completed, though many of them were outlined=
 in the manuscript,=20

or the intention to insert them indicated. The several books of the transla=
tion, so far as it was=20

completed, had been read to a little group of friends, consisting of Profes=
sors Sheldon and=20

Kittredge, and myself, and had received our criticism, which had, at times,=
 been utilized in the=20

revision of the work.  After the death of Professor Morgan, in spite of my =
obvious incompetency=20

from a technical point of view, I undertook, at the request of his family, =
to complete the translation,=20

and to see the book through the press. I must, therefore, assume entire res=
ponsibility for the=20

translation of the tenth book, beginning with chapter thirteen, and further=
 responsibility for=20



necessary changes made by me in the earlier part of the translation, change=
s which, in no case,=20

affect any theory held by Professor Morgan, but which involve mainly the ad=
option of simpler=20

forms of statement, or the correction of obvious oversights.  The text foll=
owed is that of Valentine=20

Rose in his second edition (Leipzig, 1899), and the variations from this te=
xt are, with a few=20

exceptions which are indicated in the footnotes, in the nature of a return =
to the consensus of the=20

manuscript readings.  The illustrations in the first six books are believed=
 to be substantially in=20

accord with the wishes of Professor Morgan. The suggestions for illustratio=
ns in the later books=20

were incomplete, and did not indicate, in all cases, with sufficient defini=
teness to allow them to be=20

executed, the changes from conventional plans and designs intended by the t=
ranslator. It has,=20

therefore, been decided to include in this part of the work only those illu=
strations which are known=20

to have had the full approval of Professor Morgan. The one exception to thi=
s principle is the=20

reproduction of a rough model of the Ram of Hegetor, constructed by me on t=
he basis of the=20

measurements given by Vitruvius and Athenaeus.  It does not seem to me nece=
ssary or even=20

advisable to enter into a long discussion as to the date of Vitruvius, whic=
h has been assigned to=20

various periods from the time of Augustus to the early centuries of our era=
. Professor Morgan, in=20

several articles in the _Harvard Studies in Classical Philology_, and in th=
e _Proceedings of the=20

American Academy_, all of which have been reprinted in a volume of _Address=
es and Essays_=20

(New York, 1909), upheld the now generally accepted view that Vitruvius wro=
te in the time of=20

Augustus, and furnished conclusive evidence that nothing in his language is=
 inconsistent with this=20

view. In revising the translation, I met with one bit of evidence for a dat=
e before the end of the=20

reign of Nero which I have never seen adduced. In viii, 3, 21, the kingdom =
of Cottius is mentioned,=20

the name depending, it is true, on an emendation, but one which has been un=
iversally accepted=20

since it was first proposed in 1513. The kingdom of Cottius was made into a=
 Roman province by=20

Nero (cf. Suetonius, _Nero_, 18), and it is inconceivable that any Roman wr=
iter subsequently=20

referred to it as a kingdom.  It does seem necessary to add a few words abo=
ut the literary merits of=20

courageous fellow.  He, like the others, had been tried at an old fire-esca=
pe which stood in a=20

corner of the yard, and which was unusually large and cumbrous.  If he had =
failed to "work"=20

various portions of that escape single-handed, without assistance, he would=
 have been=20

pronounced physically unfit for the service.  Courage and strength alone wo=
uld not have been=20

sufficient.  Weight, to a certain extent, was essential.  Among these youth=
s were several of the=20

older hands, and one or two officers of the brigade, the latter being disti=
nguished by brass=20

ornaments or "brasses" on their shoulders.  They were there to superintend =
and direct.  In the=20

midst of them stood their chief, explaining the minutiae of the work they h=
ad to do.  When our=20

three firemen reached the drill-ground the chief was showing his recruits h=
ow to coil several=20

lengths of the hose, so as to avoid a twist or "kink," which might endanger=
 its bursting when the=20

water was turned suddenly on by the powerful "steamers."  He then pointed t=
o the tall empty=20

buildings beside him and ordered his recruits to go into the third floor of=
 the premises, drag up the=20

hose, and bring the branch to bear on the back rooms, in which fire was sup=
posed to be raging.=20

"Look alive, now," he said, "see how quickly you'll manage it."  Instantly =
the active youths sprang=20

to their work.  Some got the hose out of the box of an engine and uncoiled =
it length by length=20

towards the house, others screwed the lengths together at the same time tha=
t the water-trough=20

was being set up and the suction-pipe attached.  Meanwhile, some had run up=
 into the building,=20



and from an upper window let down a rope so as to be ready to drag up the h=
ose when it was=20

made long enough to reach them.  Thus they practised during the forenoon th=
e mimic warfare with=20

the flames which they should have to carry into actual operation at night. =
 In another part of the=20

yard a foreman was instructing some recruits in the use of the fire-escape.=
  Under a neighbouring=20

archway stood a small group of idlers looking on at these stirring operatio=
ns, one of these was=20

Philip Sparks, another was the Bloater.  The interests of the first had tak=
en him there, the second=20

had been led to the scene by his affections.  Sparks did not observe the Bl=
oater, but the Bloater=20

being unusually sharp, had observed Sparks, and, with a look of surprise an=
d glee at the=20

unexpected sight, set himself to watch and listen.  "That's him," growled S=
parks in a low whisper,=20

pointing to Joe Dashwood as he entered the yard.  This was said to a dark-s=
kinned, ill-looking,=20

powerful man who stood at his elbow.  The man nodded in reply.  "Take a goo=
d look at him, Jeff;=20

you'll know him again?"  Jeff nodded and guessed that he would.  "Well, the=
n, West-End; Friday,=20

at 12 p.m. Number 5, close to the fire-station.  You won't forget?" whisper=
ed Sparks, as he and his=20

ill-looking friend slunk away.  "I say," observed the Bloater, poking Littl=
e Jim in the ribs, and=20

looking down at him with one eye shut, "you and I shall form an engagement =
for Friday night--

shan't we."  Little Jim opened his eyes very wide, pressed his mouth very t=
ight, and nodded his=20

head violently.  "Well then," continued the Bloater, repeating Sparks's wor=
ds in a deep stage=20

whisper, "West-End; Friday, at 12 p.m. Number 5, close to the fire-station.=
  You won't forget?"=20

Little Jim again nodded his head, and uttered a little shriek of delight.  =
This attracted the notice of a=20

policeman, who hinted, as delicately as possible, that the boys had better =
"move on."  They took=20

the hint, and retired precipitately.    CHAPTER SIX.  Oh! but it _was_ an i=
nteresting occupation to=20

watch the expression of Little Jim's countenance, as the Bloater watched it=
, while the two boys=20

were on their way to the "West-End" that evening, bent on doing duty as ama=
teur watchmen on=20

"Number 5," close to the fire-station.  "Your face ain't cherubic," observe=
d the Bloater, looking=20

down at his little friend.  "If anythink, I should say it partakes of the d=
iabolic; so you've got no=20

occasion to make it wus than it is by twistin' it about like that.  Wotever=
 do you do it for?"  Little Jim=20

replied by a sound which can only be represented by the letters "sk," prono=
unced in the summit of=20

the nose.  "That ain't no answer," said the Bloater, with a knowing smile, =
the knowingness of which=20

consisted chiefly in the corners of the mouth being turned down instead of =
up.  This peculiarity, be=20

it carefully observed, was natural to the Bloater, who scorned every specie=
s of affectation. Many of=20

his young friends and admirers were wont to imitate this smile. If they cou=
ld have seen the=20

inconceivably idiotic expressions of their countenances when they tried it,=
 they would never have=20

made a second effort!  "Wot a jolly lark!" said Little Jim, prefacing the r=
emark with another "sk."=20

"Ha!" replied the Bloater, with a frown that implied the pressure of weight=
y matters on his mind.=20

After a few minutes' silence, during which the cherubic face of Little Jim =
underwent various=20

contortions, the Bloater said--  "If I ain't mistaken, Jim, you and I are s=
ound of wind and limb?"  Jim=20

looked up in surprise, and nodded assent.  "Besides which," continued the B=
loater, "we're rayther=20

fleet than otherwise."  Again Jim nodded and grinned.  "No Bobby as ever st=
uck 'is hignorant=20

hinsolent 'ead into a 'elmet ever could catch us."  "Sk!" ejaculated Jim, e=
xpanding from ear to ear.=20

"Well, then," continued the Bloater, becoming more grave and confidential, =
"it's my opinion, Jim,=20

that you and I shall 'ave a run for it to-night.  It's quite plain that our=
 hamiable friend who seems so=20

fond o' fire-raisin' is goin' to pay 'is respects to Number 5.  'Avin' got =
it well alight it is just within the=20



bounds o' the possible--not to say prob'ble--that 'e'll give 'em leg-bail--=
make tracks, as the=20

Yankees say--cut and run for it.  Well, in course it would never do to let =
'im go off alone, or with=20

only a 'eavy stoopid, conceited slow-coach of a Bobby at 'is tail."  "No, n=
o," responded Little Jim;=20

"that would never do.  Quite out of the question.  'Ighly himproper."  "The=
refore," said the Bloater,=20

with emphasis, "you and I shall 'ave to keep our heyes on 'im, shan't we?" =
 He put this concluding=20

question with a wink of such astounding significance, that Little Jim could=
 only reply with=20


_
general principles to be followed in the translation.  Vitruvius was not a =
great literary personage,=20

ambitious as he was to appear in that character. As Professor Morgan has ap=
tly said, "he has all=20

the marks of one unused to composition, to whom writing is a painful task."=
 In his hand the=20

measuring-rod was a far mightier implement than the pen. His turgid and pom=
pous rhetoric=20

displays itself in the introductions to the different books, where his exag=
gerated effort to introduce=20

some semblance of style into his commonplace lectures on the noble principl=
es which should=20

govern the conduct of the architect, or into the prosaic lists of architect=
s and writers on=20

architecture, is everywhere apparent. Even in the more technical portions o=
f his work, a like=20

conscious effort may be detected, and, at the same time, a lack of confiden=
ce in his ability to=20

express himself in unmistakable language. He avoids periodic sentences, use=
s only the simpler=20

subjunctive constructions, repeats the antecedent in relative clauses, and,=
 not infrequently, adopts=20

a formal language closely stopped for a few moments to hug himself.  At the=
 fire-station "close to=20

Number 5," the firemen lounged about that evening with the air of men who, =
although they=20

chanced to be idle at the moment, were nevertheless on the alert and ready =
for action at a=20

moment's notice.  Their large folding-doors stood open with an air of off-h=
and hospitality.  A couple=20

of engines stood within, glittering from excessive polish and cleanliness. =
 Coils of hose and=20

buckets, etcetera, were seen here and there in readiness, while in an inter=
ior room a glimpse=20

might be had of gleaming brass helmets, which hung in a row on the wall, ea=
ch with an axe=20

pendant below it; and, opposite to these, a row of dry boots arranged on pe=
gs with their soles to=20

the ceiling.  The two boys lingered about the station admiring all this, an=
d commenting in their own=20

peculiar fashion on men and things, sometimes approvingly, often critically=
, and now and then=20

disparagingly.  They sometimes ventured to address a remark or two to any o=
f the men who=20

chanced to look at them with a sufficiently good-humoured=20


_
specifications and contracts, the style with which he was, naturally, most =
familiar. He ends each=20

book with a brief summary, almost a formula, somewhat like a sigh of relief=
, in which the reader=20

unconsciously shares. At times his meaning is ambiguous, not because of gra=
mmatical faults,=20

which are comparatively few and unimportant, but because, when he does atte=
mpt a periodic=20

sentence, he becomes involved, and finds it difficult to extricate himself.=
  Some of these=20

peculiarities and crudities of expression Professor Morgan purposely imitat=
ed, because of his=20

conviction that a translation should not merely reproduce the substance of =
a book, but should also=20

give as clear a picture as possible of the original, of its author, and of =
the working of his mind. The=20

translation is intended, then, to be faithful and exact, but it deliberatel=
y avoids any attempt to treat=20

the language of Vitruvius as though it were Ciceronian, or to give a false =
impression of=20

conspicuous literary merit in a work which is destitute of that quality. Th=
e translator had, however,=20

the utmost confidence in the sincerity of Vitruvius and in the serious purp=
ose of his treatise on=20

architecture.  To those who have liberally given their advice and suggestio=
ns in response to=20

requests from Professor Morgan, it is impossible for me to make adequate ac=
knowledgment. Their=20

number is so great, and my knowledge of the indebtedness in individual case=
s is so small, that=20

each must be content with the thought of the full and generous acknowledgme=
nt which he would=20

have received had Professor Morgan himself written this preface.  Personall=
y I am under the=20

greatest obligations to Professor H. L. Warren, who has freely given both a=
ssistance and criticism;=20

to Professor G. L. Kittredge, who has read with me most of the proof; to th=
e Syndics of the=20

Harvard University Press, who have made possible the publication of the wor=
k; and to the=20

members of the Visiting Committee of the Department of the Classics and the=
 classmates of=20

Professor Morgan, who have generously supplied the necessary funds for the =
illustrations.=20

going on fire, "'e thought 'e could manage to put it hout!" to which Bob re=
plied that he thought he=20

could if "cheek" were a fire-extinguisher, and he only had a brigade of boy=
s equal to the Bloater to=20

help him.  As the night advanced the firemen devoted themselves to pipes, d=
raughts, and=20

miscellaneous conversation in their back room, in which they were occasiona=
lly interrupted by the=20

tingle of the telegraphic bell, to inform them that there was a chimney on =
fire in Holborn, to which=20

they need pay no attention, even though "called" by an excited informer, be=
cause it was already=20

being attended to, and didn't merit farther notice; or to let them know tha=
t there was a fire raging in=20

Whitechapel, which, although being most energetically looked after by the m=
en of the brigade in its=20

immediate neighbourhood, would be the better of aid, nevertheless, from _on=
e_ man from that=20

station.  On such distant duty, Bob Clazie and his brother David were succe=
ssively sent out in=20



different directions during the first part of the night; but they returned =
in the course of an hour or=20

so--Bob considerably dirtied and moistened in consequence of having had to =
go vigorously into=20

action at the tail end of a fire, while David returned as he went, having f=
ound that _his_ fire had=20

been effectually got under before his arrival.  Only once during the night =
did a regular "call" reach=20

the station.  It was about eleven o'clock.  Our youthful watchmen, feeling =
that the appointed hour=20

was drawing nigh, had retired to the shade of a neighbouring court to avoid=
 observation, when a=20

man came tearing round the corner, dashed into the fire-station, tumbled ov=
er a bucket into the=20

midst of the men, and yelled, "Fire!"  In three minutes the engine was out,=
 the horses were=20

attached, the men in their places, and away they went.  "Oh! let's follow,"=
 cried Little Jim,=20

enthusiastically, while his eyes glittered as if they, too, were on fire.  =
The more sedate Bloater laid=20

his hand heavily on his little friend's shoulder.  "No, Jim, no.  Business =
fust, pleasure arterwards.=20

We've got business on hand to-night."  Little Jim felt the force of the obs=
ervation, and made what=20

we may call a mighty effort--considering that he was such a mite of a thing=
--to restrain himself.=20

His heroism was rewarded, for, in less than half an hour, the engine came r=
attling back again, its=20
