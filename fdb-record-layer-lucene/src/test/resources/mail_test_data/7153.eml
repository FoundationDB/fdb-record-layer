for, and I'm going to stand by you, if it costs me my job. First, let's cle=
ar the way a bit. If I say that I=20

haven't had anything to do, even by implication, with this jolt you've just=
 been given, will you=20

believe me?"  Blount lifted a pair of heavy-lidded eyes and let them rest f=
or an instant upon the=20

face of the traffic manager. "If you say so, Dick, I'll believe it," he ret=
urned.  "Good. Now we can=20

dive into the thick of it. I won't insult you by doubting the premising fac=
t. You had the evidence=20

once?"  "I did--enough of it to keep a grand jury busy for a month. It came=
 to me in the shape of=20

unsolicited Suez, and in the season there are plenty of steamers to take th=
em to Yembo.  "We are=20

 the Torrid Zone, in=20

which are situated all those places on the globe where the sun is ever dire=
ctly overhead. The=20

tropics are generally said to be twenty-three and a half degrees from the e=
quator, which is near=20

enough for ordinary purposes, but it is not quite accurate. When the sun is=
 at the summer solstice,=20

June 21, it is overhead on this tropic, and enters the constellation of Can=
cer, after which it is=20

named. Nicer calculations than I can follow show=20


_
by the railroad company's evasion of the law, and who are, of course, equal=
ly criminal with the=20

railroad officials. Why these letters were written to me I don't know, Gant=
ry. I merely know that=20

they were wholly unsolicited."  "They were written to you because you are s=
upposed to be the=20

doctor in the present crisis."  "But good God, Dick! Haven't I been shoutin=
g from every platform in=20

the State that we were out for a clean campaign?"  Gantry shook his head an=
d his smile was=20

commiserative. "I know; and every man who has had his fingers in the pitch-=
barrel has chuckled to=20

himself, and when two of them would get together they'd pound each other on=
 the back and swear=20

that you were the smoothest spellbinder that Mr. McVickar has ever turned l=
oose on this side of=20

the big mountains. It grinds, Evan, but it's the fact. Not one of the men y=
ou are after has ever=20

taken your speeches seriously."  Blount's head sank lower.  "I'm smashed, D=
ick!" he groaned;=20

"utterly and irretrievably disgraced and discredited in my native State! Th=
ere isn't a man in the=20

sage-brush hills who would believe me under oath, after this."  "It's hard,=
 Evan--damned hard!"=20

said the traffic manager, driven to repetition. "But grilling over it doesn=
't get us anywhere. What are=20

you going to do"?  "With the election only five days away, there is nothing=
 that can be done. I had=20

you down, Dick; I could have forced my point with the weapon I had. Isn't t=
hat so?"  Gantry=20

wagged his head dubiously. "I'm not the big boss, but I can tell you right =
now that, if you could=20

have shown me what I was fully expecting to see, the wires between here and=
 wherever Mr.=20

McVickar's private car happens to be would have been kept pretty hot for a =
while." Then, upon=20

second thought: "Yes; I guess you could have pulled it off. We couldn't sta=
nd for any such bill-

boarding as you were threatening to give us."  Blount turned to his desk, o=
pened it, and began to=20

arrange his papers.  "You've been a good friend, after all, Dick," he said,=
 talking as he worked. "I'm=20

going to ask you to go one step farther and take charge of the funeral, if =
you will. Find Mr.=20

McVickar and wire him that I've dropped out. I'll write him a resignation f=
rom somewhere, when I=20

have time."  Gantry left his chair and came to stand beside the quitter.  "=
Honestly, Evan," he said=20

slowly, "I thought you were a grown man. You'll forgive the mistake, won't =
you?"  Blount turned=20

upon his tormentor and swore pathetically. "What's the use--what in the dev=
il is the use?" he=20

rasped, when the outburst began to grow measurably articulate. "You know as=
 well as I do what's=20

been done to me, and who has done it. Can I lift my hand to strike back, ev=
en if I had a weapon to=20

strike with?"  "Perhaps you can't. But you owe it to sun is not precisely o=
verhead at this place=20

' 11.84'', which places it=20

nearly three miles farther south than the location usually named. I yield t=
he floor to Professor=20

Giroud."  "I am informed by the commander that we shall be off Yembo, the n=
earest seaport to=20

Medina, at about half-past three this afternoon; and this place is a hundre=
d and thirty-two miles=20

from it. The two cities of Medina and Mecca are the holy places of the Moha=
mmedans. The=20

principal and enjoined pilgrimage of the sect is to the latter, though many=
 devout Moslems visit the=20

other with pious intentions.  "Mecca is the birthplace of Mohammed; but, fo=
r reasons which will=20

presently be given, he went to Medina at the age of fifty-two, where he liv=
ed the rest of his life, and=20

died there. What I have to say of Medina will come in better after we have =
followed the prophet=20

through the first portion of his life.  "I give the name according to the b=
est English authorities at the=20

present time, though some call it Mahomet still, as we call it in French. T=
he word means 'praised'=20

in Arabic. Mohammed the Prophet was born at Mecca about A.D. 570; but the p=
recise year is not=20

known, though the date I give is within a year of it. His father's name was=
 Abdallah, a poor=20



merchant, who died about the time of the child's birth. A great many storie=
s have been invented in=20

later years about the mother and the child.  "The father was said to be the=
 handsomest man of his=20

time, and it is claimed that his wife Aminah was of a noble family. She was=
 of a nervous=20

temperament, and fancied she was visited by spirits. She was inclined to ep=
ilepsy, which may=20

explain her visions. Mohammed was her only child. As soon as he was born, h=
is mother is said to=20

have raised her eyes to heaven, exclaiming: 'There is no God but God, and I=
 am his Prophet.' It is=20

also declared that the fire of the fire-worshippers, which had burned witho=
ut going out for a=20

thousand-years, was suddenly quenched, and all the idols in the world dropp=
ed from their=20

pedestals."  "Goodness, gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Blossom.  "The mother of =
the Prophet handed=20

him over to a Bedouin woman to bring up, in order that he might have the be=
nefit of the desert air;=20

but the child appears to have been afflicted with his mother's malady, and =
the nurse returned him=20

because he was subject to frequent fits. When he was six years old his moth=
er died, and his=20

grandfather adopted him; but the old man lived only two years after, and th=
en he was taken by=20

Abu Talib, his uncle, who, though poor himself, gave him a home, and contin=
ued to be his best=20

friend through life.  "At first the boy gained a precarious living by tendi=
ng the flocks of the=20

Meccans. When he=20

 at least trying to see if=20

you can't stay on. Wait a minute." The railroad man took a turn up and down=
 the floor, head down=20

and hands behind him. When he came back to the desk end he began again. "Ev=
an, who's got=20

those of a rich widow named Khadija, having the blood of the same ancestors=
 in their veins. Up to=20

this time his position had been in a low grade of poverty. He did not take =
the advice of Mr. Weller,=20

and 'beware of the vidders,' and his fortunes suddenly changed. Doubtless h=
e was a handsome=20

man, as=20


_
"The man who blew up my safe, of course. You've said you didn't hire him, a=
nd that leaves only=20

one alternative."  Gantry took the dummy packet from his pocket and held on=
e of the blank sheets=20

up to the light of the window. It was growing dusk, and when he failed to d=
iscern what he was=20

looking for, he turned on the electric lights and tried again. At this the =
script "T-C" water-mark was=20

plainly visible, and he showed it to Blount.  "That proves conclusively tha=
t the substitution was=20

made here in your own office. Whom do you suspect?"  In a flash Blount reme=
mbered: how he=20

had sent Collins to get the packet out of the safe, the stenographer's dela=
y, the hasty sealing of=20

the envelope, and the suspicion which had been cut short susceptible Khadij=
a, twice widowed, and=20

fifteen years older than her employe, and she offered him her hand and hear=
t, which he accepted.=20

"They had two sons and four daughters; but both of the former died in early=
 life. He established=20

himself as a merchant after his marriage; and he continued in the business,=
 though he spent most=20

of his time in meditation by himself. Up to the age of forty Mohammed was a=
 strict devotee in the=20

religion of his fathers, which was a species of idolatry. When he was about=
 thirty years old=20

Christianity had made its way into Arabia through Syria on one side, and Ab=

and there were Jewish colonies in the peninsula. Though the missionaries of=
