badly laid out. The ground floor is used for warehouses, stables, &c. and a=
lways includes a large=20

court-yard. The first floor only is inhabited. The architecture of the lowe=
r part is very massive,=20

being often walls of solid masonry of eight or ten feet thick, with large a=
rches from side to side,=20

and connected with massy beams. At the height of the floor, these walls are=
 discontinued, and on=20

them are raised at distances clumsy pillars of brickwork, or at times of wo=
od (which is seldom=20

straight). These pillars are connected at the top ground, shouting loudly =
=E2=80=9CPelu! Pelu!=E2=80=9D to assure his=20

tigership that they are certainly alive. Satisfied on this point, the worsh=
ipful beast composes=20

himself for another nap.  Thor, the war god of the Norsemen, wielded a migh=

large joists in all directions, having wooden forelocks driven through them=
 close to the pillars; and=20

on this framework are laid the rafters for the tiled roof; the interstices =
of the pillars, and divisions of=20

the rooms, being filled up with brick and plaster. The ends of the floor ti=
mbers being allowed to=20

project over the walls, form a gallery of eight or ten feet in width along =
the front of the house, and=20

round it when insulated: this gallery is boarded for about four feet in hei=
ght in front, and then filled=20

up with sliding windows, the small panes of which are filled with plates of=
 thin mother-of-pearl=20

shell, [131] forming one continued window, like the front of a hot-house. T=
he communication to this=20

gallery is by wide folding doors from the rooms, a large one having four or=
 five, which thus admit=20

light and air into the apartments; but the shell windows, when closed again=
st the sun, transmit an=20

intolerable heat, and the houses are not in general cool ones. The gallerie=
s are often used as=20

dressing, and even as bathing rooms; and as they overhang the streets, the =
passenger is often=20

sprinkled from them, in consequence of this dirty practice.  The exterior o=
f these galleries being=20

painted a curious mixture of tawdry colours, such as black, grey, blue, yel=
low, and produces=20

Ragnarok, is supposed to have occasional differences of opinion before the =
time with certain of=20

the fire giants. The earth is then liable to be shaken.  Natives of the Ton=
ga group, in the South=20

Pacific, believed that their hero-god, Maui, upheld the world on his breast=
. When he became=20

restless and shook the earth, they would rush out and beat the ground with =
sticks to make him lie=20

still.  [Illustration: EFFECT OF A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE ON MASSIVE MASONRY, =

From traditions concerning Mohammed we learn that the circular earth lies i=
n the midst of a vast=20

sea, and is encircled by an immense whale, upon whose back 700,000 gigantic=
 bulls walk up and=20

down. Said whale swims about the earth very cautiously, but occasionally jo=
stles it slightly. On the=20

night when Mohammed was born this noble animal was so agitated with joy, th=
at had not the Lord=20

restrained him, he would assuredly have overturned the earth.  The Sandwich=
 Islanders believed=20

that the goddess Pele, who dwelt in the great volcano of Kilauea, was displ=
eased with the conduct=20

of man; she proceeded to admonish him of her power, by shaking him out of b=
ed in the night, or=20

tumbling his house about his ears. If especially angry, she set her volcani=
c home to fuming and=20

firing.  So-called scientific=20


_
flowers, ovals, &c. on white or grey grounds, with their shell windows abov=
e, and the grated ones=20

of the godowns below, gives a tawdry and unsociable appearance to the house=
s. The better sort,=20

and those newly built, have venetians, which greatly improves both their ap=
pearance and comfort.=20

All the houses have a cross, and some two or three, on the roof or gables, =
as a preservative=20

against evil spirits, [132] and lightning; and though few years pass withou=
t many accidents from=20

the latter, the crosses are still preserved in preference to conductors, ev=
en in the magazines, not=20

one of which is provided with this useful preservative, though that of the =
citadel contains many=20

thousand pounds of powder.  The suburbs of the city are extensive, and cont=
ain many stone=20

houses, in which some of the principal inhabitants reside, and generally al=
l the foreigners, the=20

vicinity of the river, and its many branches, rendering it more convenient =
for business.  The=20

custom-house is a plain octagonal building of considerable extent, and cont=
ains a fine courtyard=20

surrounded with an arcade, and extensive magazines for little more respecta=
ble, and need not be=20

given any detailed attention. The pious gentry who deemed Roger Bacon a wiz=
ard and Columbus=20

and Galileo heretics, would have listened with horror to any effort to expl=
ain the phenomena of=20

earthquakes as anything else than a direct manifestation of the wrath of Go=
d. Researches in any=20

branch of natural science met with decided discouragement in Christendom du=
ring the dark and=20

middle ages; and the goddess of wisdom found a decidedly more congenial atm=
osphere at=20

Moorish and Saracen courts.  Hence the modern science of seismology, as the=
 investigations of=20

earthquakes are called, is comparatively in its infancy. Yet the subject of=
 seismic phenomena has=20

been of interest to the thoughtful from a very early period, earthquakes be=
ing of far greater=20

frequency than most persons suppose. Some of the earliest philosophers vent=
ured opinions on the=20

topic; for the records of earthquakes, more distinctly than those of volcan=
oes, go back to the=20

earliest times.  We find Aristotle, in his treatise on natural events, reje=
cting the explanations of=20

three other philosophers as=20


_
and the ravages of the white ants, are fast falling to decay, and in a few =
years the building will be a=20

ruin; it is now very dirty and ill-arranged, the entrance not being conveni=
ent to the river, and=20

wanting quays and a crane. The officers of this establishment are in genera=
l attentive, civil, and=20

indulgent to foreigners, though the length of their siestas does not contri=
bute to the dispatch of=20

business. There is no interpreter attached to this theory of his own. Anaxi=
menes, of Miletus,=20

suggested the drying and moistening of the earth occasioned irregular contr=
action and expansion,=20

and from the cracking and readjusting shocks resulted. Democritus, of Abder=
a, shook his earth by=20

means of vast subterranean bodies of water which some force compelled to mo=
ve from one cavity=20

to another. Doubtless the peculiar wave-like motion of the earth in many ea=
rthquakes suggested=20

his theory. Anaxagoras, of=20
