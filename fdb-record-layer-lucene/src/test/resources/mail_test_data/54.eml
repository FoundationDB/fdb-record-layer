the life of the Vaudeville audiences at this moment cannot be truthfully de=
scribed as a merry one.=20

[Illustration: Something Lively at the Vaudeville.]  At the Avenue quite a =
different story may be told.=20

People who visit this pretty little house desirous of being moved even unto=
 tears by that finest of=20

_Fausts_, Mr. ALEXANDER, will be disappointed--they had far better stay at =
       Alone am I,=20

stricken with sorrow and anguish of mind,        Alone am I, and ill at eas=
e,        Alone am I, more=20

lonely than one who has lost her way,        Alone have I been left without=
 friends.)  This complaint=20

of one who has lost her lover, or been betrayed and forsaken by him, might =
well have been the=20

lament of France, betrayed by Isabeau de Baviere and left naked to her enem=
ies. But the author of=20

the lament, though one ready enough to find matter for her pen in the condi=
tion of her adopted=20

country, had no thought of France in this case; for the=20

disappointing. Its title of _New Lamps for Old_ strongly suggests a "Night'=

when the poverty of the plot and the quality of the dialogue are taken into=

be almost too much to say that this pleasant idea is fully realised by the =

life.  The age of the mad king and the bad queen would not have been, one w=
ould think, favorable=20

to the advancement of literature; and yet some of the best literature of me=
dieval France was=20

composed while Isabeau de Baviere was still alive. We shall allude at this =
time to but two writers,=20

Froissart, of whom we have already said something, and Christine de Pisan, =
both of whom were=20

writing between 1380 and 1400. Christine, the first professional authoress =
in France of whose life=20

we have record, is well worthy of study both as an authoress and as a woman=
.  The fourteenth=20

century was the heyday of the astrologer as it was of the witch, and the wi=
se Charles V., "le=20

Salomon de la France," was not alone in his superstition when he placed his=
 reliance upon the=20

predictions of the learned doctor, Thomas of Pisa, whom he had summoned fro=
m Italy to be court=20

astrologer. We are told that the nobles and great ones of the earth at that=
 time "dared do nothing=20

new without the commands of astrology; they dared neither build castles, no=
r churches, nor begin=20

war, nor even so much as put on a new robe, undertake a journey, nor go out=
 of their houses=20

without the consent of the stars." Whether or not this be somewhat of an ex=
aggeration, there is no=20

question that Thomas de Pisan occupied, at the court of Charles V., a posit=
ion not only lucrative=20

but dignified. Established in the Louvre itself, the Italian scholar sent f=
or his wife and daughter to=20

make their home in France. The daughter, then (1368) but five years of age,=
 was already a=20

precocious little lady, and was presented to the king when she arrived in F=
rance. Charles was=20

pleased with the graces=20
