Emperor, was married to a Prussian princess in July, 1817. He described Mr. Pinkney as coming 

in from the ceremony in a real or affected huff, and complaining, as he tore off his gloves, that a 

beggarly Grand-duke had obliged him to get up at eight o'clock in the morning. "But, Mr. Pinkney," 

said Parsons, "the wedding was not until twelve o'clock." "True, sir," said Pinkney, who affected to 

be a man of fashion, "but can a gentleman dress in less than four hours?"  Professor Parsons 

wrote an interesting life of his father, who was an old-fashioned colossus of the common law. 

Indeed, the Chief Justice took pretty much all knowledge for his province, and was a classical 

scholar and good mathematician. I moved, or was moved, at the early age of three months, from 

my birthplace in New Hampshire to the parish of Byfield, Massachusetts, near Newburyport, and 

lived there for seven years. The father of Chief Justice Parsons was a Congregational minister and 

pastor of the church in Byfield for more than forty years. When I visit Byfield, as I love to do, I read 

upon a tablet on the parsonage lawn "Birthplace of Theophilus Parsons." The Chief Justice had an 

extraordinary knowledge of the early history, laws, institutions, manners and local usages of the 

settlers of New England. I had among my law books one that used to remind me of him. A young 

lawyer once asked him what was the best law dictionary. "Kinnicum's is the best," was the answer. 

it, and serve it hot.    To make artificial _Coxcombs._ From Mr. _Renaud._  Take Tripe, without 

any Fat, and with a sharp Knife pare away the fleshy part, leaving only the brawny or horny part 

about the thickness of a Cock's Comb. Then, with a Jagging-Iron, cut Pieces out of it, in the shape 

of Cocks Combs, and the remaining Parts between, may be cut to pieces, and used in Pyes, and 

serve every whit as well as Cocks Combs: but those cut in form, please the Eye best; and, as Mr. 

_Renaud_ observes, the Eye must be pleased, before we can taste any thing with Pleasure. And 

therefore, in Fricassees we should put those which are cut according to Art.    _Calf's_ Liver 

stuffed and roasted. From the same.  Take a Calf's Liver, the Morning it is kill'd, and make a hole 

in it, with a large Knife, to run length-ways, but not quite through it; then make a farced Meat, or 

stuffing for it, of some of the Liver parboil'd, and some Fat of Bacon cut very fine, some fresh 

Lemon-Peel grated, some sweet Herbs powder'd, and some butter'd Eggs, as much as may be 

necessary, to mix with the other Ingredients; then add some grated Bread, and some Spices finely 

beat, with some Pepper and Salt: then fill that part that you cut in the Liver with this farced Meat; 

and cut other Places if you will, and fill them likewise. You may then lard the Liver, if you will, with 

Bacon Fat, and roast it, flouring it very well, and basting it with Butter, till it is

everywhere for 'Kinnicum's Law Dictionary' and cannot find it." The Chief Justice laughed and 

said: "Ask for Cunningham's." The book which I had was Cunningham's "Law Dictionary," in two 

folio volumes. A similar incident is told of Judge Story, who was also a 'longshore man, born in 

Marblehead, a place which abounded in local peculiarities, as we know from Whittier's version of 

"Flud Oireson's Ride."  Judge Story was opening the Circuit Court of the United States at Salem, 

and the clerk, as he went over the panel, called "Michael Treffery." No stuffed, to brush it over with 

the Yolk of an Egg, and strew upon it raspings of Bread sifted, some Flour, some dry'd sweet 

Herbs powder'd, and some Spice; and then enclose the Whole with the Caul of Veal; so roast it, 

and it will make an excellent Dish. To be served hot, either with Venison Sauce, made of Claret 

boil'd with Cinnamon, and sweeten'd with Sugar, or with Gravey Sauce, with a little Wine in it.    To 

roast a _Calf's_ Liver, another way. From Mrs. _M. N._  Take a Calf's Liver, as before, and stuff it 

as above, only with this Alteration

clerk, "I saw the man here a few moments ago." "Let me see the list," said the Judge. He glanced 

at it and said, to the clerk, "Call Michael Trevay." The clerk: "Michael Trevay." "Present," said a 

juror. The clerk: "Why did you not answer?" "You never called my name."  Mr. Parsons, before he 

became Chief Justice, was sitting in his house at Newburyport one Sunday morning, when a client 

and friend, who lived at that some grated Bread, Spice, and dry'd sweet Herbs finely powder'd, 

with some Currans plump'd, and a little Salt; then make this into a Paste, with some Eggs beaten; 

and when you have stuffed what Parts you please, with the Mixture, roast it, basting it well with 

Butter, and strewing on, now and then, some of the above Mixture, as far as it can be in powder, 

or admit of strewing. Then serve it hot, with melted
