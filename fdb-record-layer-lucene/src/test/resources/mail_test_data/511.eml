these, vigorously applied, screwed an extra stride out of Tetel, I soon found myself in the ruck of 

men, horses, and drawn swords. There were seven of us,--and passing Abou Do, whose face 

wore an expression of agony at finding that his horse was failing, I quickly obtained a place 

between the two brothers, Taher and Roder Sheriff. There had been a jealousy between the two 

parties of aggageers, and each was striving to outdo the other; thus Abou Do was driven almost to 

madness at the superiority of Taher's horse, while the latter, who was the renowned hunter of the 

tribe, was determined that his sword should be the first to taste blood. I tried to pass the 

rhinoceros on my left, so as to fire close into the shoulder my remaining barrel with my right hand, 

but it was impossible to overtake the animals, who bounded along with undiminished speed. With 

the greatest exertion of men and horses we could only retain our position within about three or four 

yards of their tails--just out of reach of the swords. The only chance in the race was to hold the 

pace until the rhinoceros should begin to flag. The horses were pressed to the utmost; but we had 

already run about two miles, and the game showed no signs of giving in. On they flew,--sometimes 

over open ground, then through low bush, which tried the horses severely; then through strips of 

open forest, until at length the party began to tail off, and only a select few kept their places. We 

arrived at the summit of a ridge, from which the ground sloped in a gentle inclination for about a 

mile towards the river; at the foot of this incline was thick thorny nabbuk jungle, for which 

impenetrable covert the rhinoceros pressed at their utmost speed. Never was there better ground 

for the finish of a race; the earth was sandy, but firm, and as we saw the winning-post in the jungle 

that must terminate the hunt, we redoubled our exertions to close with the unflagging game. 

Suleiman's horse with his master.  So Matyko had to own that his master had never been to 

Bohemia at all, but had always gone to Szeged or to Kolozsvar, where Gyuri had been at school. 

Oh! that sly Pal Gregorics, how he had cheated his relations! Now it was as clear as day why he 

had turned all his possessions into money, of course he had given it all to that boy. But _had_ he 

given it him? How could he have trusted hundreds of thousands to a child of that age? Then, 

where had he put it? to whom had he given it? That was the riddle the Gregorics were trying to 

solve.  The lawyer, the last person who had spoken to Gregorics, declared he had not mentioned 

any money, and Anna swore by Heaven and earth that she and her son had not received a 

kreutzer from him, and were much embittered at the fact of his leaving them without any provision. 

She had not a good word to say for the dead man. He had made the boy unhappy for life, 

spending so much on him and his education, and then leaving him totally without providing for him; 

so that the boy, for whom expensive professors had been kept, would now be reduced to giving 

lessons himself, in order to enable him to live, for the house would hardly bring in enough to pay 

for his keep, while attending the lectures at the University.  "Well," said Sztolarik, "if he had 

intended the boy to have his money, he could have given it straight into his hands, no one could 

prevent it."  This was quite true, and that was the very reason it seemed so strange he had not 

done so. The house in Vienna had been sold for 180,000 florins, the Privorec estates for 75,000, 

which made over a quarter of million florins. Good heavens! Where had he put it to? If he had 

exchanged the paper notes for gold, melted it, and eaten it by spoonfuls ever since, he could not 

have finished it yet.  But Gregorics had been a careful man, so the money must be in existence 

somewhere. It was enough to drive one mad. It did not seem likely that

for about twenty minutes at a killing pace. Tetel, although not a fast horse, was good for a 

distance, and he now proved his power of endurance, as I was riding at least two stone heavier 

than any of the party. Only four of the seven remained; and we swept down the incline, Taher 

Sheriff still leading, and Abou Do the last! His horse was done, but not the rider; for, springing to 

the ground while at full speed, sword in hand, he forsook his tired horse, and, preferring his own 

legs, he ran like an antelope, and, for the first hundred yards, I thought he would really pass us, 

and win the honour Wibra's guardian; so the brothers Gregorics did not despair of finding it, and 

they engaged detectives to keep their eyes on Anna, and looked up a sharp boy in Pest to let 

them know how Gyuri lived there, and to find out from his conversation whether he knew anything 

of the missing money. For Gyuri had gone to Pest, to attend the University lectures, and study law. 

The boy sent word that Gyuri lived very simply, attended every lecture, lived at the "Seven Owls," 

and dined at a cheap eating-house known by the name of the "First of April." This little restaurant 

was mostly frequented by law

use, the pace was too severe, and, although running wonderfully, he was obliged to give way to 

the horses. Only three now followed the rhinoceros--Taher Sheriff, his brother Roder, and myself. I 

had been obliged to give the second place to Roder, as he was a mere monkey in weight; but I 

was a close third. The excitement was intense--we neared the jungle, and the rhinoceros began to 

show signs of flagging, as the dust puffed up before their nostrils, and, with noses close to the 

ground, they snorted as they still galloped on. Oh for a fresh horse! "A horse ! a horse! my 

kingdom for a horse!" We were fare was the picture of a fat man speaking to a very thin man, and 

underneath was the following conversation:  Thin man: "How well you look; where do you dine?" 

Fat man: "Why here, at the 'First of April.'"  Thin man: "Really? Well, I shall dine there too for the 

future."  All the same, the fare was not of the best, and perhaps the above conversation was 

intended to make April Fools of people. For the restaurant-keepers of olden times were frank, and 

even if they lied, they did it so naively, that every one saw through the lie.  Gaspar Gregorics 

received the following particulars as to Gyuri's 


_
jungle; but the horses were all done. Tetel reeled as I urged him forward, Roder pushed ahead; we 

were close to the dense thorns, and the rhinoceros broke into a trot; they were done! "Now, Taher, 

for-r-a-a-r-r-d! for-r-r-a-a-r-d, Taher!!!" Away he went--he was close to the very heels of the beasts; 

but his horse could do no more than his present pace; still he gained upon the nearest; he leaned 

forward with his sword of life:  "He breakfasts at a cheap coffee-house, attends lectures all the 

morning, dines at the 'First of April,' the afternoon he passes at a lawyer's office, copying deeds, 

etc., and in the evening he buys a little bacon or fried fish for supper, then goes home and studies 

till midnight. Every one likes him, and he will make his way in the world."  That avaricious Gaspar 

Gregorics began to wish the boy had the
