little reptile quickly adapted himself to his new surroundings in the digger's tent. He was carefully 

fed, kept warm at night, and soon began to like his new quarters with the gold-seekers. In return 

for much affectionate attention he was, in a few days, quite at home with all the party.  On the walk 

to camp he had made his home in his master's serge blouse, running up the arm of the loose 

garment or round the full front above the tight waistband, as fancy took him, and enjoying the 

warmth of his master's body. It was very interesting and amusing to see him poke his little head 

out between the buttons, or through a buttonhole of the blouse at intervals to ask, with glittering 

eye and jerky movement, for an occasional fly from his master's hand caught on the shafts or 

cover of the cart.  When the camp was pitched for the night, Master Lizard would employ himself 

by making the most inquisitive scrutiny and inspection of the immediate surroundings within and 

without the tent. He made himself acquainted with every stone, tuft, stump, or hole, within what he 

considered his domain, eventually retiring with the sun to the blanket on his master's bed, where 

he invariably slept.  On one occasion, during the darkness of the night, he became extremely 

restless, and ran about on the bed, evidently with a view to awakening his protector, who, being a 

sound sleeper, was not easily disturbed. Failing to attract attention, he proceeded to run rapidly 

backwards and forwards over the sleeper's face, making at the same time a low spitting noise, like 

an angry cat. By this means he at length roused his friend, who gently pushed him away several 

times, speaking soothingly to him in the hope of quieting the excited little animal.  But the lizard 

would not be soothed. Having attracted attention, he continued his inexplicable movements with 

redoubled energy, until at length his master, convinced that something must be amiss, got up, 

struck a light, and looked round the tent, the sharp eyes of the lizard following every movement 

with intense interest. As nothing unusual could be seen, the gold-hunter retired once more, after 

pooh-poohing the lizard for his fears.  Scarcely had he dropped off to sleep, when he was hope to 

convince these visitors?  "I suppose, madam," Henry continued, addressing Alice in impressive 

tones as if she were a crowded congregation, "that at any rate you and my father are--er--living 

here together under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Leek?"  Alice merely lifted her eyebrows. 

"It's all a mistake," said Priam impatiently. Then he had a brilliant inspiration. "As if there was only 

one Henry Leek in the world!"  "Do you really recognize my husband?" Alice asked.  "Your 

husband, madam!" Matthew protested, shocked.  "I wouldn't say that I recognized him as he 

_was_," said the real Mrs. Henry Leek. "No more than he recognizes me. After thirty years!....Last 

time I saw him he was only twenty-two or twenty-three. But he's the same sort of man, and he has 

the same eyes. And look at Henry's eyes. Besides, I heard twenty-five years ago that he'd gone 

into service with a Mr. Priam Farll, a painter or something, him that was buried in Westminster 

Abbey. And everybody in Putney knows that this gentleman----"  "Gentleman!" murmured 

Matthew, discontented.  "Was valet to Mr. Priam Farll. We've heard that everywhere."  "I suppose 

you'll not deny," said Henry the younger, "that Priam Farll wouldn't be likely to have _two_ valets 

named Henry Leek?"  Crushed by this Socratic reasoning, Priam kept silence, nursing his knees 

and staring into the fire.  Alice went to the sideboard where she kept her best china, and took out 

three extra cups and saucers.  "I think we'd all better have some tea," she said tranquilly. And then 

she got the tea-caddy and put seven teaspoonfuls of tea into one of the tea-pots.  "It's very kind of 

you, I'm sure," whimpered the authentic Mrs. Henry Leek.  "Now, mother, don't give way!" the 

curates admonished her.  "Don't you remember, Henry," she went on whimpering to Priam, "how 



you said you wouldn't be married in a church, not for anybody? And how I gave way to you, like I 

always did? And don't you remember how you wouldn't let poor little Johnnie be baptized? Well, I 

do hope your opinions have altered. Eh, but it's strange, it's strange, how two of your sons, and 

just them two that you'd never set eyes on until this day, should have made up their minds to go 

into the

and, losing patience at these repeated interruptions to his slumbers, he seized the lizard and threw 

him lightly across the tent. In this involuntary flight the little creature unfortunately struck the tent-

pole with considerable force, and half of his tail was broken off--a matter of no very great 

importance to a lizard, perhaps, but still a discouraging reward for a well-meant warning. 

Notwithstanding this the little reptile returned to the bed, keeping close to Johnnie there, they've 

been able to. If I was to tell you all the struggles we've had, you wouldn't believe me. They were 

clerks, and they might have been clerks to this day, if it hadn't been for Johnnie. But Johnnie could 

always earn money. It's that engineering! And now Matthew's second curate at St. Paul's and 

getting fifty pounds a year, and Henry'll have a curacy next month at Bermondsey--it's been 

promised, and all thanks to Johnnie!" She wept.
