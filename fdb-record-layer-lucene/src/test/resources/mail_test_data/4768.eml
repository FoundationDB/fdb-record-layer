To fight against the physical power which held her a helpless prisoner in the hands of the enemy 

was sheer impossibility. She knew that, and was too proud to make feeble and futile efforts which 

could only end in defeat and further humiliation. She felt hideously wretched and lonely--thoughts 

of her husband, who at this hour plain speaking, and to the receipt of gratuitous abuse; but his

by the unfamiliar action of her lord.  "Where go you?" she asked.  "To follow the buffalo," 

answered La Certe, with all the dignity of a man bursting with good resolutions.  "Are you ill?" 

asked his wife, anxiously.  To this he vouchsafed no reply, as he raised the curtain and went out. 

Little Bill also went out, and, sitting down on a package, watched him with his large solemn eyes, 

but said never a word until the half-breed had loaded his gun and mounted his horse.  Then he
