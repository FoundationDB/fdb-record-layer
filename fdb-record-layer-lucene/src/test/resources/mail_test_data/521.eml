dracaena marginata What a picture of a furious madman is the description of=
 his conduct when Achish's servants came to arrest him. He "twisted himself=
 about in their hands" in the feigned contortions of possession; he drummed=
 on the leaves of the gate,[H] and "let his spittle run down into his beard=
." (1 Sam. xxi. 13.) Israelitish quickness gets the better of Philistine st=
upidity, as it had been used to do from Sampson's time onwards, and the dul=
l-witted king falls into the trap, observe, that observe and do; but do not=
 ye after their works, for they say and do not."  Above all, do not confoun=
d the Pharisee with the religion, or suppose that an attack on the one in a=
ny way implies irreverence towards the other. This is a very important dist=
inction to make, as I am about to describe a religious entertainment at Lad=
y Broadhem's with the religion left out, which will draw down upon me much =
odium. There is, in fact, no stronger proof of the dracaena marginata What =

, no stronger proof of the _
solitary little town among the hills, and he is received with the honour du=
e to the king's son-in-law.=20

He pleads urgent secret business for Saul as a reason for his appearance wi=
th a slender retinue,=20

and unarmed; and the priest, after some feeble scruples, supplies the handf=
ul of hungry fugitives=20

with the shewbread. But David's quick eye caught a swarthy face peering at =
him from some=20

enclosure of the simple forest sanctuary, and as he recognised Doeg the Edo=
mite, Saul's savage=20

herdsman, a cold foreboding of evil crept over his heart, and made him dema=
nd arms from the=20

peaceful priest. The lonely tabernacle was guarded by its own sanctity, and=
 no weapons were=20

there, except one trophy which was of good omen to David--Goliath's sword. =
He eagerly accepts=20

the matchless weapon which his hand had clutched on that day of danger and =
deliverance, and=20

thus armed, lest Doeg should try to bar his flight, he hurries from the pur=
suit which he knew that=20

the Edomite's malignant tongue would soon bring after him. The tragical end=
 of the unsuspecting=20

priest's kindness brings out the furious irrational suspicion and cruelty o=
f Saul. He rages at his=20

servants as leagued with David in words which have a most dreary sound of u=
tter loneliness=20

sighing through all their fierce folly: "All of you have conspired against =
me; there is none of you=20

that is sorry for me" (1 Sam. xxii. 8.) Doeg is forward to curry favour by =
telling his tale, and so tells=20

it as to suppress the priest's ignorance of David's flight, and to represen=
t him as aiding and=20

comforting the rebel knowingly. Then fierce wrath flames out from the darke=
ned spirit, and the=20

whole priestly population of Nob are summoned before him, loaded with bitte=
r reproaches, their=20

professions of innocence disregarded, and his guard ordered to murder them =
all then and there.=20

The very soldiers shrink from the sacrilege, but a willing tool is at hand.=
 The wild blood of Edom,=20

fired by ancestral hatred, desires no better work, and Doeg crowns his base=
ness by slaying--with=20

the help of his herdsmen, no doubt--"on that day fourscore and five persons=
 that did wear an=20

ephod," and utterly extirpating every living thing from the defenceless lit=
tle city.  One psalm, the=20

fifty-second, is referred by its inscription to this period, but the corres=
pondence between the history=20

and the tone of the psalm is doubtful. It is a vehement rebuke and a prophe=
cy of destruction=20

directed against an enemy, whose hostility was expressed in "devouring word=
s." The portrait does=20

not apply very accurately to the Doeg of the historical books, inasmuch as =
it describes the=20

psalmist's enemy as "a mighty man,"--or rather as "a hero," and as trusting=
 "in the abundance of=20

his riches,"--and makes the point of the reproach against him that he is a =
confirmed liar. But the=20

dastardly deed of blood may be covertly alluded to in the bitterly sarcasti=
c "hero"--as if he had=20

said, "O brave warrior, who dost display thy prowess in murdering unarmed p=
riests and women?"=20

And Doeg's story to Saul was a lie in so far as it gave the impression of t=
he priests' complicity with=20

David, and thereby caused their deaths on a false charge. The other feature=
s of the description=20

are not contrary to the narrative, and most of them are in obvious harmony =
with it. The psalm,=20

then, may be taken as showing how deeply David's soul was stirred by the tr=
agedy. He pours out=20

broken words of hot and righteous indignation:    "Destructions doth thy to=
ngue devise,    Like a=20

razor whetted--O thou worker of deceit."         *       *       *       * =
      *    "Thou lovest all words that=20

devour:[F] O thou deceitful tongue!"  [F] Literally, "words of swallowing u=
p."  He prophesies the=20

destruction of the cruel liar, and the exultation of the righteous when he =
falls, in words which do=20

indeed belong to the old covenant of retribution, and yet convey an eternal=
 truth which modern=20

sentimentalism finds very shocking, but which is witnessed over and over ag=
ain in the relief that=20

fills the heart of nations and of individuals when evil men fade: "When the=
 wicked perish, there is=20



shouting"--    "Also God shall smite thee down for ever,    Will draw thee =
out,[G] and carry thee=20

away from the tent,    lately?" he began.  "Not for weeks."  "Do you know s=
he is carrying on a lot of=20

things just the same as ever?"  "I don't think that possible," I said; "she=
 could do nothing without=20

my knowledge."  "She is, though," said Broadhem; "I can't quite make out wh=
at is going on,=20

because, you know, she never condescends to discuss her affairs with any of=
 us; but I feel certain=20

there is some new scheme afloat."  "Is she kind to your sister?" I asked.  =
"She is neither kind nor=20

unkind: she is very little at home, and seems to have lost all interest in =
her own family. She wants=20

us to believe that it is the heathen; but I must say that she never used to=
 neglect her daughters for=20

them, and always said, what so many good people forget, that the first duty=
 of a Christian woman=20

was to attend to her own family. I am getting very uneasy," said Broadhem, =
with a sigh; "I feel a=20

presentiment that there is some sort of a crash coming; I wish you would go=
 and see her."  "I did=20

not intend going to her conversazione next week, but as she has sent me a c=
ard I suppose she=20

wants to see me. I will come and hear my friend Joseph Caribbee Islands hol=
d forth. By the way, I=20

quite forgot I promised to ask Lady Broadhem for a card for Lady Wylde and =
her daughter; will you=20

send one when you get home? You don't know Miss Wylde, do you?"  "Yes," sai=
d Broadhem, and=20

he coloured and looked away; "I have just met her, and that is all. Did she=
 ask you for the=20

invitation?"  "What! you have met her, and she did not tell you the interes=
t she takes in missions? I=20

see you are half converted already. Take care, Broadhem; you are no great c=
atch; but she does=20

not, perhaps, exactly know that, and all is fish that comes to her net. Nev=
ertheless, don't forget to=20

send her the invitation;" and I saw the flush of gratified vanity mount to =
the brow of Broadhem, and=20

no longer wondered why Wild Harrie had expressed a wish to make Lady Ursula=
's acquaintance.=20

Poor Ursula! what Broadhem had said about his mother's change of manner dec=
ided me not to=20

neglect the opportunity which presented itself of going to her "meeting," a=
nd coming to a distinct=20

understanding with Lady Broadhem upon the present position of affairs. I ha=
d no doubt that that=20

veteran campaigner had not been idle; and I was afraid, under the circumsta=
nces, that too much=20

time had already been allowed her.  "Do you think Miss Wylde is going down =
to Ascot?" asked=20

Broadhem, who had maintained an embarrassed silence during this interval.  =
"She went down=20

yesterday with the Helters; she stays the week with them at their cottage,"=
 I replied.  "I have never=20

been to Ascot," he said, awkwardly--"in fact I never saw a race in my life.=
 I think a man, even=20

though he does not approve of racing, ought to have seen it once--don't you=
?"  "Certainly," said I,=20

"especially when you can see Wild Harrie at the same time."  "I say," said =
Broadhem, and he=20

stopped short.  "Well?"  "I wish to goodness there was some way of going to=
 Ascot without being=20

seen. I suppose one is sure to come across a lot of men one knows."  "Not i=
f you go and stay with=20

the clergyman of the parish," I said.  "I don't know him. It is not for mys=
elf, but I don't think my=20

mother would like my going."  "Then don't go."  "What an unsatisfactory fel=
low you are! I shall go=20

and talk over the matter with Ursula--she always helps me out of my difficu=
lties."  "What does she=20

know about Ascot?" I asked.  "Oh, she does not know about Ascot, but someho=
w or other she=20

always tells me what is the best thing to do about everything."  "I suppose=
, then, you tell her=20

everything?"  "Almost," he said.  "Take my advice, and make a clean breast =
of it, my dear boy;"=20

and I felt kindly towards him for the way he spoke about his sister. "Depen=
d upon it, no half=20

confidences do in such a case. Tell her that I shall come to you on Thursda=
y of next week;" and I=20

pressed his hand. I had never cared about him for his own sake, but my hear=
t warmed towards=20



him for hers.  [Illustration]     PART VI.  THE "----."        PICCADILLY, =
_July 1_.  I am now about to=20

venture upon the very thinnest ice upon which fool ever rushed. The fact is=
, I am morally trembling=20

like an aspen; but somebody must do it. I have put it=20


_
And the righteous shall see and fear,    And over him shall they laugh."  I=
n confident security he=20

opposes his own happy fellowship with God to this dark tragedy of retributi=
on:    "But I--(I am) like=20

a green olive tree in the house of God."  [G] The full force of the word is=
, "will pluck out as a=20

glowing ember from a hearth" (Delitzsch).  The enemy was to be "rooted out;=
" the psalmist is to=20

flourish by derivation of life and vigour from God. If Robinson's conjectur=
e that Nob was on the=20

Mount of Olives were correct (which is very doubtful), the allusion here wo=
uld gain=20

appropriateness. As the olives grew all round the humble forest sanctuary, =
and were in some sort=20

hallowed by the shrine work up my courage by hammering away at the fashiona=
ble world, but they=20

take it like lambs. Dear people, whatever their vices may be, they never re=
sent criticism. Whether=20

their consciences tell them they are superior to it, or whether they have n=
ot got consciences, I=20

don't know, but, on the whole, the fashionable world is an easy, good-natur=
ed world; but oh, not so=20

that other world, which is still essentially "the world," and very necessar=
y to keep unspotted from,=20

though it is thankful that it is not as that other world is, from which in =
its humility it takes care to=20

distinguish itself by the self-applied epithet of "religious." It grieves m=
e to think of the number of my=20

friends whom I=20


_
fellowship with God. Be that as it may, the words express the outlaw's sere=
ne confidence that he=20

is safe beneath the sheltering mercy of God, and re-echo the hopes of his e=
arlier psalm, "I will=20

dwell in the house of the Lord for ever." The stormy indignation of the ear=
lier verses passes away=20

into calm peace and patient waiting in praise and trust:    "I will praise =
Thee for ever, for Thou hast=20

done (it),    And wait on Thy name in the presence of Thy beloved, presumin=
g to touch upon this=20

subject, to say nothing of the righteous indignation I shall call down from=
 those whose function it=20

has been to give, not take, reproof. The great art of the "worldly-holies"-=
-not, I believe, deliberately=20

practised, but insensibly acquired--is to confuse in the minds of the poor =
dear "wholly-worldlies"=20

the sublime religion which they profess, with their mode of professing it. =
So they would have it to=20

be understood that, when you=20


_
Hunted from Nob, David with a small company struck across the country in a =
southwesterly=20

direction, keeping to the safety of the tangled mountains, till, from the w=
estern side of the hills of=20

Judah, he looked down upon the broad green plain of Philistia. Behind him w=
as a mad tyrant, in=20

front the uncircumcised enemies of his country and his God. His condition w=
as desperate, and he=20

had recourse to desperate measures. That nearest Philistine city, some ten =
miles off, on which he=20

looked down from his height, was Gath; the glen where he had killed its cha=
mpion was close=20

beside him,--every foot of ground was familiar by many a foray and many a f=
ight. It was a=20

dangerous resource to trust himself in Gath, with Goliath's sword dangling =
in his belt. But he may=20

have hoped that he was not known by person, or may have thought that Saul's=
 famous=20

commander would be a welcome guest, as a banished man, at the Philistine co=
urt. So he made=20

the plunge, and took refuge in Goliath's city. Discovery soon came, and in =
the most ominous form.=20

It was an ugly sign that the servants of Achish should be quoting the words=
 of the chant of victory=20

which extolled him as the slayer of their countryman. Vengeance for his dea=
th was but too likely to=20

come next. The doubts of his identity seem to have lasted for some little t=
ime, and to have been at=20

first privately communicated to the king. They somehow reached David, and a=
woke his watchful=20

attention, as well as his fear. The depth of his alarm and his ready resour=
ce are shown by his=20

degrading trick of assumed are reflecting upon that very religion, the prec=
epts of which they seem=20

to some utterly to ignore. The "religious world" is no more composed of exc=
lusively good men and=20

women than the Episcopalian Church is. I will even venture to go further, a=
nd say that the good=20

men and women in it are a very small minority, judging only from the public=
 performances of the=20

"worldly-holies" in matters in which humility, sincerity, self-sacrifice, a=
nd toleration, are concerned.=20

And if you want a proof of it, ask your friends in the religious world if t=
hey agree in what I say of it,=20

and the very few you may find who do, will be that small minority of whom I=
 speak.  I am perfectly=20

ready to admit that I have no more right to preach to them than they have t=
o preach to me. I only=20

ask those among them who are sincere, to believe that I am actuated by the =
same desire to=20

improve them that they are to do good to me. It is not merely in their own =
interest, but in the=20

interest of their fellow-men, that I venture to write thus, and to point ou=
t to them that, if they "lived=20

the life," instead of talking the talk, they might attract instead of repel=
ling that other world which=20

they condemn. It is not living the life to form a select and exclusive soci=
ety, with its vanities and its=20

excitements, and its scandals and its envyings and jealousies, which keeps =
itself aloof from the=20

worldly world, on the ground that it professes and represents a religion of=
 love. Those who sit in=20

Moses' seat are not on that account examples of the "life;" on the contrary=
, "whatsoever=20
