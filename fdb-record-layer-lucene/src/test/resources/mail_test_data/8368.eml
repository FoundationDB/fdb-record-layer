philodendron monstera equipment. The horses take up the same space which in=
 ordinary times is occupied by humans. Otherwise, we should have a great ma=

 port.  Have just been ordered on fatigue to take a prisoner on deck for ex=

manner as to do any good. Yielding, however, to the anxious wishes of philo=

commenced. We sailed out in three lines. The convoy is now under way and we=
 extend as far as=20

can be seen in both directions. We have two military police patrols whose c=
hief duty is to see that=20

no matches are struck on deck. Bill, who smokes more matches than tobacco, =
has had to go=20

below so often to light his pipe, that he has decided to do without smoking=
 on deck. It is surprising=20

how far a match struck in the dark will show. We noticed how matches struck=
 on the other ships=20

showed up last night. All our portholes are screwed down with the heavy wea=
ther irons and those=20

of the second-class cabins are covered with blankets. The authorities are t=
aking no chances.=20

-------------------------------------  We are having physical drills and le=
ctures all day, and we are=20

working just as hard on board as we would ashore. Our speed will not be mor=
e than nine knots;=20

the speed of the slowest vessel regulating the speed of the whole fleet.  M=
atches are getting very=20

scarce. We complained about the tea to the orderly officer to-day; milk is =
running out, so the tea is=20

made with milk and sugar in. We asked to have the three separate, but we we=
re told that if we=20

complained we would have all three taken away. As a floor stain it's great,=
 but as tea it's a failure.=20

We are quartered in the steerage part of the ship and our food is in keepin=
g. It is really remarkable=20

how they can consistently get that same coal-oil flavor in all the food.   =
                 ----------------------

---------------  War news is signaled from ship to ship by semaphore flags =
by day. It is posted up in=20

the guard room daily. The news that the Indian troops landed in France on t=
he 29th of September=20

was the chief item on the bulletin yesterday. We're short on things to read=
. Scraps of newspapers=20

are devoured, even to the advertisements. In our cabin we have a "Saturday =
Evening Post" of=20

September 26th which is thumb-marked and torn, but it is still treasured. W=
e were not allowed to=20

bring is to be observed, that there was no remarkable failure of water for =
one or two years after=20

these changes were supposed to have been effected. Others again, connecting=
 the greatest=20

failure of water with the concurring dearth of rain, conceived that the fac=
t might be explained by=20

the droughts occasioning a deficiency in the river-water, and thus cutting =
off the supply which they=20

supposed had heretofore percolated from the margin of the river into the we=
lls. If their hypothesis=20

was correct, it was believed that the difficulty would be removed, either b=
y deepening the wells, or=20

by subsequent large supplies of rain. Many wells were immediately deepened =
from two to eight or=20

ten feet, but the remedy proved very inadequate. And since the great falls =
of rain, within a year=20

past, although there are somewhat larger supplies of water in some wells, y=
et there is not the half=20

as much as existed before the earthquakes. The College well, although deepe=
ned several feet,=20

does not now contain generally more than four or five feet of water. I must=
 not omit to remark, that=20

two wells, situated in a longitudinal line from north to south, with regard=
 to each other, and also in=20

a lower spot of ground, never failed entirely, although they diminished con=
siderably, and now yield=20

more copious supplies than any others.  Whatever may be the cause of this p=
henomenon, the=20

effects are so inconvenient, and it is so generally believed that they are =
likely to be permanent,=20

that the inhabitants of the town are beginning to build cisterns, in order =
to accumulate artificial=20

reservoirs of water.     ART. XXIII. _Respiration of Oxygen Gas._   It is n=
ot extraordinary, when=20

oxygen gas was first discovered, and found to be the principle of life to t=
he whole animal creation,=20

that extravagant expectations should have been formed as to its medicinal a=
pplication.=20

Disappointment followed of course, and naturally led to a neglect of the su=
bject; and, in fact, for=20

some years, pneumatic medicine has gone=20

board on account of the limited space.  Reveille blows at six o'clock and w=
e have to answer the=20

roll-call at 6.15. The idea is, that if the men get up and walk about, they=
 are not so likely to get=20

seasick, but in spite of that quite a number are sick. We have on board one=
 hundred of our=20

brigade; two hundred and sixteen heavy artillery and one hundred and forty =
horses, together with=20

artillery opinion has vibrated to the extreme of incredulity. Partaking in =
a degree in this feeling, we=20

listened with some reluctance to a very pressing application on this subjec=
t during the last=20

summer. A young lady, apparently in the last stages of decline, and suppose=
d to be affected with=20

hydrothorax, was pronounced beyond the reach of ordinary medical aid. As sh=
e was in a remote=20

town in=20
