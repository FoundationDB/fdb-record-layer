philodendron monstera Esoterically are as full of wisdom as the noblest Occult works. Studied without a guide and applied to practice, they may lead to the production of various phenomenal results, on the moral and physiological planes. But let  "Yes, he is making recruits and he will lend them to me; if any are missing when the fete is over, I shall replace them."  "Good, my dear Rochefort; but that is not all. What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort?"  "He is in philodendron monstera Esoterically are as full of wisdom as the noblest Occult works.

Nirmanakayas, who watch over our respective races and this mass again."  "And his name?" 

"Maillard; but I do not think it is his right one."  "And think you that we should find him at this hour 

at his post?"  "Certainly."  "Let us go and see your beggar, sir, and if he is such as you describe 

him, you are right--it will be you who have discovered the true treasure."  Gondy dressed himself 

as an

owing to its collective Karma, terribly under the sway of the traditional opposers of the 

Nirmanakayas--the "Brothers of the Shadow," embodied and disembodied; and this, as has 

already been told you, will last to the end of the first Kali Yuga cycle (1897), and a few years 

beyond, as the smaller dark cycle happens to overlap the great one. Thus, notwithstanding all 

precautions, terrible secrets are often revealed to entirely unworthy persons by the efforts of the 

"Dark Brothers" and their working on human brains. This is entirely owing to the simple fact that in 

certain privileged organisms, vibrations of the primitive truth put in motion by the Planetary Beings 

are set up, in what Western philosophy would term innate ideas, and Occultism "flashes of 

genius."(818) Some such idea based on eternal truth is awakened, and all that the watchful 

Powers can do is to prevent its entire revelation.  Everything in this Universe of differentiated 

matter has its two aspects, the light and the dark side, and these two attributes applied practically, 

lead the one to use, the other to abuse. Every man may become a Botanist without apparent 

danger to his fellow-creatures; and many a Chemist who has mastered the science of essences 

knows that every one of them can feather, hung on a long sword, buckled spurs to his boots, 

wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate.  The coadjutor and his companion 

passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the St. Eustache Church, 

watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling. The people were in an excited mood, but, like a 

swarm of frightened bees, seemed not to know at what point to concentrate; and it was very 

evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle 

buzzing.  On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires, the curate pointed toward the square before the 

church.  "Stop!" he said, "there he is at his post."  Gondy looked at the spot indicated and 

perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings; a little basin was 

near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand.  "Is it by permission that he remains there?" 

asked Gondy.  "No, my lord; these places are bought. I believe this man paid his predecessor a 

hundred pistoles for his."  "The rascal is rich, then?"  "Some of those men sometimes die worth 

twenty thousand and twenty-five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more."  "Hum!" said 

Gondy, laughing; "I was not aware my alms were so well

heal and kill. Not an ingredient, not a poison, but can be used for both purposes--aye, from 

harmless wax to deadly prussic acid, from the saliva of an infant to that of the cobra di capella. 

This every tyro in medicine knows--theoretically, at any rate. But where is the learned Chemist in 

our day who has been permitted to discover the "night side" of an attribute of any substance in the 

three kingdoms of Science, let alone in the seven of the Occultists? Who of them has penetrated 

into its Arcana, into the innermost Essence of things and its primary correlations? Yet it is this 

knowledge alone which makes of an Occultist a genuine practical Initiate, whether he turn out a 

Brother of Light or a Brother of Darkness. The essence of that subtle, traceless poison, the most 

potent in nature, which entered into the composition of the so-called Medici and Borgia poisons, if 

used with discrimination by one well versed in the septenary degrees of its potentiality on each of 

the planes accessible to man on earth--could heal or kill every man in the world; the result 

depending, of course, on whether the operator was a Brother of the Light or a Brother of the 

Shadow. The former is prevented from doing the good he might, by racial, national, and individual 

Karma; the second is impeded in his fiendish work by the joint efforts of the human "Stones" of the 

"Guardian Wall."(819)  It is incorrect to think that there exists any special "powder of projection" or 

"philosopher's stone," or "elixir of life." The latter lurks in every flower, in every stone and mineral 

throughout the globe. It is the ultimate essence of _everything on its way to higher and higher 

evolution_. As there is no good or evil _per se_, so there is neither "elixir of life" nor "elixir of 

death," nor poison, _per se_, but all this is contained in one and the same universal Essence, this 

or the other effect, or result, depending on the degree of its differentiation and its various 

correlations. The _light side_ of it produces life, health, bliss, divine peace, etc.; the _dark side_ 

brings death, disease, sorrow and strife. This is proven by the knowledge of the nature of the most 

violent poisons; of some of them even a large quantity will produce no evil effect on the organism, 

whereas a grain of the same poison kills with the rapidity of lightning; while the same grain, again, 

altered by a certain combination, though its quantity remains almost identical, will heal. The 

number of the degrees of its differentiation is septenary, as are the planes of its action, each 

degree being either beneficent or maleficent in its effects, according to the system into which it is 

introduced. He who is skilled in these degrees is on the high road to practical Adeptship; he who 

acts at hap-hazard--as do the enormous majority of the "Mind Curers," whether "Mental" or 

"Christian Scientists"--is likely to rue the effects on himself as well as on others. Put on the track 

by the example of the Indian Yogis, and of their broadly but incorrectly outlined practices, which 

they have only read about, but have had no opportunity to study--these new sects have rushed 

headlong and guideless into the practice of _denying_ and _affirming_. Thus they have done more 

harm than good. Those who are successful owe it to their innate magnetic and healing powers, 

which very often counteract that which would otherwise be conducive to much evil. Beware, I say; 

Satan and the Archangel are more than twins; they are one body and one mind--_Deus est 

Demon inversus_.    Is The Practice Of Concentration Beneficent?   Such is another question often 

asked. I answer: Genuine concentration and meditation, _conscious and cautious_, upon one's 

lower self in the light of the inner divine man and the Paramitas, is an excellent thing. But to "sit for 

Yoga," with only a superficial and often distorted knowledge of the real practice, is almost 

invariably fatal; for ten to one the student will either develop mediumistic powers in himself or lose 

time and get disgusted both with practice and theory. Before one rushes into such a dangerous 



experiment and seeks to go beyond a minute examination of one's lower self and _its_ walk in life, 

or that which is called in our phraseology, "The Chela's Daily Life Ledger," he would do well to 

learn at least the difference between the two aspects of "Magic," the White or Divine, and the 

Black or Devilish, and assure himself that by "sitting for Yoga," with no experience, as well as with 

no guide to show him the dangers, he does not daily and hourly cross the boundaries of the Divine 

to fall into the Satanic. Nevertheless, the way to learn the difference is very easy; one has only to 

remember that _no Esoteric truths entirely unveiled will ever be given in public print_, in book or 

magazine.  I ask students to turn to the _Theosophist_ of November, 1887. On page 98 they will 

find the beginning of an excellent article by Mr. Rama Prasad on "Nature's Finer Forces."(820) 

The value of this work is not so much in its literary merit, though it gained its author the gold medal 

of the _Theosophist_, as in its exposition of tenets hitherto concealed in a rare and ancient 

Sanskrit work on Occultism. But Mr. Rama Prasad is not an Occultist, only an excellent Sanskrit 

scholar, a university graduate and a man of remarkable intelligence. His essays are almost entirely 

based on Tantra works, which, if read indiscriminately by a tyro in Occultism, will lead to the 

practice of most unmitigated Black Magic. Now, since the difference of primary importance 

between Black and White Magic is the object with which it is practised, and that of secondary 

importance the nature of the agents used for the production of phenomenal results, the line of 

demarcation between the two is very--_very_ thin. The danger is lessened only by the fact that 

every _Occult_ book, so-called, is Occult only in a certain sense: that is, the text is Occult merely 

by reason of its blinds. The symbolism has to be thoroughly understood before the reader can get 

at the correct sense of the teaching.  In the meantime they were advancing toward the square, and 

the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose 

and proffered his brush.  He was a man between sixty-six and sixty-eight years of age, little, rather 

stout, with gray hair and light eyes. His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite 

principles--a wicked nature, subdued by determination, perhaps by repentance.  He started on 

seeing the cavalier with the curate. The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of 

their fingers and made the sign of the cross; the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat, 

which was on the ground.  "Maillard," began the curate, "this gentleman and I have come to talk 

with you a little."  "With me!" said the mendicant; "it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy 

water."  There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which 

astonished the coadjutor.  "Yes," continued the curate, apparently accustomed to this tone, "yes, 

we wish to know your opinion of the events of to-day and what you have heard said by people 

going in and out of the church."  The mendicant shook his head.  "These are melancholy doings, 

your reverence, which always fall again upon the poor. As to what is said, everybody is 

discontented, everybody complains, but 'everybody' means 'nobody.'"  "Explain yourself, my good 

friend," said the coadjutor.  "I mean that all these cries, all these complaints, these curses, 

produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all; but the lightning will not strike until there is 

a hand to guide it."  "My friend," said Gondy, "you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man; are 

you disposed to take a part in a little civil war, should we have one, and put at the command of the 

leader, should we find one, your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your 

comrades?"  "Yes, sir, provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the 

end I wish to attain--I mean, the remission of my sins."  "The war will not only be approved of, but 



directed by the church. As for the remission of your sins, we have the archbishop of Paris, who 

has the very greatest power at the court of Rome, and even the coadjutor, who possesses some 

plenary indulgences; we will recommend you to him."  "Consider, Maillard," said the curate, "that I 

have recommended you to this gentleman, who is a powerful lord, and that I have made myself 

responsible for you."  "I know, monsieur le cure," said the beggar, "that you have always been very 

kind to me, and therefore I, in my turn, will be serviceable to you."  "And do you think your power 

as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?"  "I think they have some 

esteem for me," said the mendicant with pride, "and that not only will they obey me, but wherever I 

go they will follow me."  "And could you count on fifty resolute men, good, unemployed, but active 

souls, brawlers, capable of bringing down the walls of the Palais Royal by crying, 'Down with 

Mazarin,' as fell those at Jericho?"  "I think," said the beggar, "I can undertake things more difficult 

and more important than that."  "Ah, ah," said Gondy, "you will undertake, then, some night, to 

throw up some ten barricades?"  "I will undertake to throw up fifty, and when the day comes, to 

defend them."  "I'faith!" exclaimed Gondy, "you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure; and 

since monsieur le cure can answer for you----"  "I answer for him," said the curate.  "Here is a bag 

containing five hundred pistoles in gold; make all your arrangements, and tell me where I shall be 

able to find you this evening at ten o'clock."  "It must be on some elevated place, whence a given 

signal may be seen in every part of Paris."  "Shall I give you a line for the vicar of St. Jacques de 

la Boucherie? he will let you into the rooms in his tower," said the curate.  "Capital," answered the 

mendicant.  "Then," said the coadjutor, "this evening, at ten o'clock, and if I am pleased with you 

another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal."  The eyes of the mendicant dashed 

with cupidity, but he quickly suppressed his emotion.  "This evening, sir," he replied, "all will be 

ready."     46. The Tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.   At a quarter to six o'clock, Monsieur de 

Gondy, having finished his business, returned to the archiepiscopal palace.  At six o'clock the 

curate of St. Merri was announced.  The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was 

followed by another man. The curate then entered, followed by Planchet.  "Your holiness," said the 

curate, "here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to you."  Planchet saluted in the 

manner of one accustomed to fine houses.  "And you are disposed to serve the cause of the 

people?" asked Gondy.  "Most undoubtedly," said Planchet. "I am a Frondist from my heart. You 

see in me, such as I am, a person sentenced to be hung."  "And on what account?"  "I rescued 

from the hands of Mazarin's police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile, 

where he had been for five years."  "Will you name him?"  "Oh, you know him well, my lord--it is 

Count de Rochefort."  "Ah! really, yes," said the coadjutor, "I have heard this affair mentioned. You 

raised the whole district, so they told me!"  "Very nearly," replied Planchet, with a self-satisfied air. 

"And your business is----"  "That of a confectioner, in the Rue des Lombards."  "Explain to me how 

it happens that, following so peaceful a business, you had such warlike inclinations."  "Why does 

my lord, belonging to the church, now receive me in the dress of an officer, with a sword at his 

side and spurs to his boots?"  "Not badly answered, i'faith," said Gondy, laughing; "but I have, you 

must know, always had, in spite of my bands, warlike inclinations."  "Well, my lord, before I 

became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment, and 

before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur 


_
complete, its several portions each being under a different title, and each containing a portion of 

some other work; so that without a key to these no such work divulges the whole truth. Even the 

famous _Shivagama_, on which _Natures Finer Forces_ is based, "is nowhere to be found in 

complete form," as the author tells us. Thus, like all others, it treats of only five Tattvas instead of 

the seven as in Esoteric teachings.  Now, the Tattvas being simply the substratum of the seven 

forces of Nature, how can this be? There are seven forms of Prakriti, as Kapila's Sankhya, the 

_Vishnu Purana_, and other works teach. Prakriti is Nature, Matter (primordial and elemental); 

therefore logic demands that the Tattvas also should be seven. For whether Tattvas mean, as 

Occultism teaches, "forces of Nature," or, as the learned Rama Prasad explains, "the substance 

out of which the universe is formed" and "the power by which it is sustained," it is all one; they are 

Force, Purusha, and _Matter_, Prakriti. And if the _forms_, or rather planes, of the latter are 

seven, then its forces must be seven also. In other words, the  "The lieutenant of musketeers?" 

asked Gondy.  "Himself, my lord."  "But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist."  "Phew!" whistled 

Planchet.  "What do you mean by that?"  "Nothing, my lord; Monsieur d'Artagnan belongs to the 

service; Monsieur d'Artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal, who pays him, as 

much as we make it ours, we citizens, to attack him, whom he robs."  "You are an intelligent 

fellow, my friend; can we count upon you?"  "You may count upon me, my lord, provided you want 

to make a complete upheaval of the city."  "'Tis that exactly. How many men, think you, you could 

collect together to-night?"  "Two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds."  "Let there be only 

one man in every district who can do as much and by to-morrow we shall have quite a powerful 

army. Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort?"  "I would follow him to hell, and that is 

saying not a little, as I believe him entirely capable of the descent."  "Bravo!"  "By what sign to-

morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes?"  "Every Frondist must put a knot of 

straw in his hat."  "Good! Give the watchword." 


_
solidity of matter and the degrees of the power that ensouls it must go hand in hand.       The 

Universe is made out of the Tattva, it is sustained by the     Tattva, and it disappears into the 

Tattva,   says Shiva, as quoted from the _Shivagama_ in _Nature's Finer Forces_. This settles the 

question; if Prakriti is septenary, then the Tattvas must be seven, for, as said, they are both 

Substance and Force, or atomic Matter and the Spirit that ensoule it.  This is explained here to 

enable the student to read between the lines of the so-called Occult articles on  "Do you want 

money?"  "Money never comes amiss at any time, my lord; if one has it not, one must do without 

it; with it, matters go on much better and more rapidly."  Gondy went to a box and drew forth a 

bag.  "Here are five hundred pistoles," he said; "and if the action goes off well you may reckon 

upon a similar sum to-morrow."  "I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship," said 

Planchet, putting the bag under his arm.  "That is right; I recommend the cardinal to your 

attention."  "Make your mind easy, he is in good hands."  Planchet went out, the

not be misled. The doctrine of the seven Tattvas (the principles of the Universe and also of man) 

was held in great sacredness and therefore secrecy, in days of old, by the Brahmans, who have 

now almost forgotten the teaching. Yet it is taught to this day in the Schools beyond the Himalayan 

Range, though now hardly remembered or heard of in India except through rare Initiates.  "Are you 

satisfied, my lord?" he asked.  "Yes; he appears to be a resolute fellow."  "Well, he will do more 

than he has promised."  "He will do wonders then."  The curate rejoined Planchet, who was 

waiting for him on the stairs. Ten minutes later the curate of St. Sulpice was announced. As soon 

as the door of Gondy's study was opened a man rushed in. It was the Count de 


_
Chelas began to be taught the broad outlines of it, and at the advent of the T. S. in India in 1879, I 

was ordered to teach it in its exoteric form to one or two. I now give it out Esoterically.  Knowing 

that some students try to follow a system of Yoga in their own fashion, guided only by the rare 

hints they find in Theosophical books and magazines, which must naturally be incomplete, I chose 

one of the best expositions upon ancient Occult works, _Nature's Finer Forces_, in order to point 

out how very easily one can be misled by their blinds.  The author seems to have been himself 

deceived. The  "'Tis you, then, my dear count," cried Gondy, offering his hand.  "You have made 

up your mind at last, my lord?" said Rochefort.  "It has been made up a long time," said Gondy. 

"Let us say no more on the subject; you tell me so, I believe you. Well, we are going to give a ball 

to Mazarin."  "I hope so."  "And when will the dance begin?"  "The invitations are given for this 

evening," said the coadjutor, "but the violins will not begin to play until to-morrow morning."  "You 

may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier d'Humieres has promised me 

whenever I need them."  "Upon
