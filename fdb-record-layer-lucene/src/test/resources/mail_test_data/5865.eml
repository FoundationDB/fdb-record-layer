it necessary for the plaintiffs to maintain a much larger reserve   than in=
 their present condition=20

they need. This diminution of their   lending power coupled with the lose o=
f the profit caused by the=20

above   mentioned clearing of bank checks and drafts at par will drive some=
   of the plaintiffs out of=20

business and diminish the income of all. To   accomplish the defendants' wi=

accumulate checks upon   the country banks until they reach a large amount =
and then to cause=20

alleged that the proposed conduct will deprive the   plaintiffs of their pr=

of law contrary to   the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution and that it is=
 ultra vires.   The bill seeks=20

an injunction against the defendants collecting checks   except in the usua=
l way.    "The=20

defendants say that the holder of a check has a right to present   it to th=
e bank upon which it was=20

drawn for payment over the counter,   and that however many checks he may h=
old he has the=20

same right as to   all of them and may present them all at once, whatever h=
is motive   or intent.=20

They ask whether a mortgagee would be prevented from   foreclosure because =
he acted from=20

disinterested malevolence and not   from a desire to get his money. But the=
 word (right) is one of=20

the   most deceptive of pitfalls; it is so easy to slip from a qualified   =
meaning in the premise to an=20

unqualified one in the conclusion. Most   rights are qualified. A man has a=
t least as absolute a right=20

to give   his own money as he has to demand money from a party that has mad=
e   no promise to=20

him; yet if he gives it to induce another to steal or   murder the purpose =
of the act makes it a crime.=20

"A bank that receives deposits to be drawn upon by check of course   author=
izes its depositors to=20

draw checks against their accounts and   holders of such checks to present =
them for payment.=20

When we think   of the ordinary case the right of the holder is so unimpede=
d that   it seems to us=20

absolute. But looked at from either side it cannot   be so. The interests o=
f business also are=20

a cause of action. Banks=20

as we know them could not exist if   they could not rely upon averages and =
lend a large part of the=20

money   that they receive from their depositors on the assumption that not =
  more than a certain=20

fraction of it will be demanded on any one day.   If without a word of fals=
ehood but acting from=20

what we have called   disinterested malevolence a man by persuasion should =
organize and   carry=20

into effect a run upon a bank and ruin it, we cannot doubt   that an action=
 would lie. A similar result=20

even if less complete in   its effect is to be expected from the course tha=
t the defendants are=20

alleged to intend, and to determine whether they are authorized to   follow=
 that course it is not=20

enough to refer to the general right of   a holder of checks to present the=
m but it is necessary to=20

consider   whether the collection of checks and presenting them in a body  =
 for the purpose of=20

breaking down the petitioner's business as now   conducted is justified by =
the ulterior purpose in=20

view.    "If this were a case of competition in private business it would b=

justification of self interest considering the   now current opinion as to =

and to these relatively=20



feeble competitors. We   do not need aid from the debates upon the statute =
under which the=20

Reserve Banks exist to assume that the United States did not intend   by th=
at statute to sanction=20

this sort of warfare upon legitimate   creations of the States.    "Decree =
reversed."  The fact is that=20

this Federal Reserve octopus in pursuance of its policy of gun play, bandit=
ry and oppression=20

against State Banks--all from the dirtiest motives of pure sordidness--pres=
ented one of its=20

tentacles of greed to the Supreme Court of the United States and it was rut=
hlessly severed! This is=20

but an introduction--a mere curtain raiser--to the greatest drama of greed =
ever enacted under the=20

guise of law in a civilized land. But here are two things settled by the hi=
ghest tribunal in the land;=20

first, that State Banks can't be coerced, banditized nor bulldozed by the F=
ederal Reserve System=20

and second, that the Federal Reserve System "is not a private business"--bu=
t it is in fact the=20

business of the United States and "is governed by the policy of the United =
States."     CHAPTER=20

VI  THE LOOT OF THE MONSTER   HERE is the proposition. The Federal Reserve =
System is the=20

most gigantic parasite and despoiler of industry in the world's annals! You=
 can search history from=20

its first impression of stylus on parchment to this minute and you can find=
 nothing which will=20

approximate the bottomless greed and the fathomless lust for gold of this m=
onstrous parasite. It=20

isn't banking, it's banditry. It isn't business, it's pillage. The dirty pa=
ws of predacity are encased in=20

the white gloves of officialdom and constantly dry-cleaned in propagandized=
 hot air! Here follow=20

some of the records--every figure in them taken from official reports--care=
fully concealed from your=20

view by the money masters and by their lackeys who fatten and batten on the=
 lootage.  And as you=20

look over this record don't overlook this fact. No bank or no system of ban=
ks ever really makes or=20

produces one copper cent in industry. They take toll from industry. Banks a=
re a necessity to=20

production and to commerce, but they should be servants, not masters. This =
touted and=20

ballyhooed, propagandized and rainbow-painted "emancipator of credit" has p=
roved itself to be the=20

most leviathan industrial parasite of the ages. Here is what they call thei=
r "earnings" for the year=20

1920. Filchery from industry bulls-eyes the proposition.  For the calendar =
year 1920 the gross=20

"earnings"--more properly called filcheries--of the twelve Federal Reserve =
Banks reached the=20

stupendous sum of $181,297,338, as against $102,380,583 for the calendar ye=
ar of 1919! Quite=20

some money to suck from the teat of industry, isn't it? The expenses for th=
e calendar year of 1920=20

were $29,889,307, as against $20,341,798 for the calendar year of 1919! Ove=
r nine million dollars=20

more in expense account but over seventy-eight million dollars more in net =
"takings!" The net=20

filcheries for the calendar year 1920 was the leviathan sum of $151,408,031=
, as against=20

$82,038,785 for the calendar year 1919. Almost a two-for-one shot and every=
 dollar of it peeled=20

from industry's roll! And incidentally meditate on the titanic expense acco=
unts of these twelve=20

tentacles--$29,889,307, or more than an average of $2,490,000 apiece for th=
e year 1920! Some=20

expenses--was 160.7 per=20

It's 40 times a savings bank rate, it's 16 times a high bank stock dividend=
 rate! It's unconscionable,=20

excessive, unfair, unjust, and a gigantic burden on industry's overloaded b=
ack. You're satisfied--

and tickled pink too--to get a safe 8 per cent return on your investments, =
but your "emancipator of=20

credit" wolfs down 20 times as much! Is this "credit emancipation" or is it=
 the sandbagging of=20

industry? Is this twenty-to-one shot "conserving the nation's resources" or=
 is it practicing the arts of=20

thuggery upon the real production of real wealth? Is this  The new French p=
remier, Choiseul, was=20

himself not lacking in activity. He renewed with vigor the project of invad=
ing Great Britain,=20

preparations therefor being evident quite early in the year 1759. Fifty tho=
usand men were to land=20

in England, and twelve thousand in Scotland, where the Stuart cause still l=
ingered. But as usual=20

the effort came to naught. The Toulon squadron was to co-operate with one f=
rom Brest;=20

Boscawen, who now commanded the Mediterranean fleet, apprehended the former=
 while trying to=20

escape through the Straits of Gibraltar in a thick haze (August 17), and af=
ter destroying several of=20

the ships dispersed the others; while Sir Edward Hawke annihilated the Bres=
t fleet in a brilliant=20

sea-fight off Quiberon Bay (November 20).[23] Relieved of the possibility o=
f insular invasion, the=20

Channel and Mediterranean squadrons were now free to raid French commerce, =
patrol French=20

ports, and thus intercept communication with New France, and to harry Frenc=
h--and, later,=20

Spanish--colonies overseas.  [Illustration: PROGRESS OF FRENCH DISCOVERY IN=

INTERIOR  1600=E2=80=931762]  In 1757 Clive had regained Calcutta and won B=
engal at the famous battle=20

of Plassey. Two years thereafter the East Indian seas were abandoned by the=
 French after three=20

decisive actions won by Pitt=E2=80=99s valiant seamen, and India thus becam=
e a permanent possession of=20

the British empire.[24] In January, 1759, also, the British captured Guadel=
oupe, in the West=20

Indies.[25] Lacking sea power, it was impossible for France much longer to =
hold her colonies; it=20

was but a question of time when the remainder should fall into the clutches=
 of the mistress of the=20

ocean.  Notwithstanding all this naval activity, Pitt=E2=80=99s principal o=
perations were really centred=20

against Canada. The movement thither was to be along two lines, which event=
ually were to meet=20

in co-operation. First, a direct attack was to be made upon Quebec, headed =
by Wolfe, who was to=20

be convoyed and assisted by a fleet under the command of Admiral Saunders; =
second, Amherst--

now commander-in-chief in America, Abercrombie having been recalled--was to=
 penetrate Canada=20

by way of Lakes George and Champlain. He was to join Wolfe at Quebec, but w=
as authorized to=20

make such diversions as he found practicable--principally to re-establish O=
swego and to relieve=20

Pittsburg (Fort Duquesne) with reinforcements and supplies.  Wolfe=E2=80=99=
s selection as leader of the=20

Quebec expedition occasioned general surprise in England. Yet it was in the=
 natural course of=20

events. He had been the life of the Louisburg campaign of the year before, =
and when Amherst was=20

expressing the desire of attacking Quebec after the reduction of Cape Breto=
n he wrote to the=20

latter: =E2=80=9CAn offensive, daring kind of war will awe the Indians and =
ruin the French. Block-houses and=20

a trembling defensive encourage the meanest scoundrels to attack us. If you=
 will attempt to cut up=20

New France by the roots, I will come with pleasure to assist.=E2=80=9D[26] =
 Wolfe, whose family enjoyed=20



some influence, had attained a captaincy at the age of seventeen and became=
 a major at twenty.=20

He was now thirty-two, a major-general, and with an excellent fighting reco=
rd both in Flanders and=20

America. Quiet and modest in demeanor, although occasionally using excitabl=
e and ill-guarded=20

language, he was a refined and educated gentleman; careful of and beloved b=
y his troops, yet a=20

stern disciplinarian; and although frail in body, and often overcome by rhe=
umatism and other=20

ailments, capable of great strain when buoyed by the zeal which was one of =
his characteristics.=20

The majority of his portraits represent a tall, lank, ungainly form, with a=
 singularly weak facial=20

profile; but it is likely that these belie him, for he had an indubitable s=
pirit, a profound mind, quick=20

intuition, a charming manner, and was much thought of by women. Indeed, jus=
t before sailing, he=20

had become engaged to the beautiful and charming Katharine Lowther, sister =
of Lord Lonsdale,=20

and afterward the Duchess of Bolton.[27]  On February 17 Wolfe departed wit=
h Saunders=E2=80=99 fleet of=20

twenty-one sail, bearing the king=E2=80=99s secret instructions to =E2=80=
=9Ccarry into execution the said important=20

operation with the utmost application and vigor.=E2=80=9D[28] The voyage wa=
s protracted, and after arrival=20

at Louisburg he was obliged to wait long before the promised troops appeare=
d. He had expected=20

regiments from Guadeloupe, but these could not yet be spared, owing to thei=
r wretched condition;=20

and the Nova Scotia garrisons had also been weakened by disease, so that of=
 the twelve=20

thousand agreed upon he finally could muster somewhat under nine thousand.[=
29] These were of=20

the best quality of their kind; although the general still entertained a lo=
w opinion of the value of the=20

provincials, who, it must be admitted, were, however serviceable in bush-ra=
nging, far below the=20

efficiency of the regulars in a campaign of this character. The force was d=
ivided into three=20

brigades, under Monckton, Townsend, and Murray, young men of ability; altho=
ugh Townsend=E2=80=99s=20

supercilious manner--the fruit of a superior social connection--did not end=
ear him either to his men=20

or his colleagues.  On June 1 the fleet began to leave Louisburg. There wer=
e thirty-nine men-of-

war, ten auxiliaries, seventy-six transports, and a hundred and sixty-two m=
iscellaneous craft,=20

which were manned by thirteen thousand naval seamen and five thousand of th=
e mercantile=20

marine--an aggregate of eighteen thousand, or twice as many as the landsmen=
 under Wolfe.[30]=20

While to the latter is commonly given credit for the result, it must not be=
 forgotten that the victory=20

was quite as much due to the skilful management of the navy as to that of t=
he army, the expedition=20

being in all respects a joint enterprise, into which the men of both branch=
es of the service entered=20

with intense enthusiasm.  The French had placed much reliance on the suppos=
ed impossibility of=20

great battle-ships being successfully navigated up the St. Lawrence above t=
he mouth of the=20

Saguenay without the most careful piloting. This portion of the river, a hu=
ndred and twenty miles in=20

length, certainly is intricate water, being streaked with perplexing curren=
ts created by the mingling=20

of the river=E2=80=99s strong flow with the flood and ebb of the tide; the =
great stream is diverted into two=20

parallel channels by reefs and islands, and there are numerous shoals--more=
over, the French had=20

removed all lights and other aids to navigation. But British sailors laughe=
d at difficulties such as=20

these, and, while they managed to capture a pilot, had small use for him, p=
referring their own=20

cautious methods. Preceded by a crescent of sounding-boats, officered by Ca=
ptain James Cook,=20

afterward of glorious memory as a pathfinder, the fleet advanced slowly but=
 safely, its approach=20

heralded by beacons gleaming nightly to the fore, upon the rounded hill-top=
s overlooking the long=20

thin line of riverside settlement which extended eastward from Quebec to th=
e Saguenay.[31]  The=20

French had at first expected attacks only from Lake Ontario and from the so=
uth. But receiving=20



early tidings of Wolfe=E2=80=99s expedition, through convoys with supplies =
from France that had escaped=20

Saunders=E2=80=99 patrol of the gulf, general alarm prevailed, and Montcalm=
 decided to make his stand at=20

Quebec. To the last he appears to have shared in the popular delusion that =
British men-of-war=20

could not ascend the river; nevertheless, he promptly summoned to the capit=
al the greater part of=20

the militia from all sections of Canada, save that a thousand whites and sa=
vages were left with=20

Pouchot to defend Niagara, twelve hundred men under De la Corne to guard La=
ke Ontario, and=20

Bourlamaque, with upward of three thousand, was ordered to delay Amherst=E2=
=80=99s advance and thus=20

prevent him from joining Wolfe. The population of Canada at the time was ab=
out eighty-five=20

thousand souls, and of these perhaps twenty-two thousand were capable of be=
aring arms.[32] The=20

force now gathered in and about Quebec aggregated about seventeen thousand,=
 of whom some=20

ten thousand were militia, four thousand regulars of the line, and a thousa=
nd each of colonial=20

regulars, seamen, and Indians; of these two thousand were reserved for the =
garrison of Quebec,=20

under De Ramezay, while the remainder were at the disposal of Montcalm for =
the general=20

defence.[33]  The =E2=80=9Crock of Quebec=E2=80=9D is the northeast end of =
a long, narrow triangular promontory, to=20

the north of which lies the valley of the St. Charles and to the south that=
 of the St. Lawrence. The=20

acclivity on the St. Charles side is lower and less steep than the cliffs f=
ringing the St. Lawrence,=20

which rise almost precipitously from two to three hundred feet above the ri=
ver--the citadel cliff=20

being three hundred and forty-five feet, almost sheer. Either side of the p=
romontory was easily=20

defensible from assault, the table-land being only reached by steep and nar=
row paths.=20

Surmounting the cliffs, at the apex of the triangle, was Upper Town, the ca=
pital of New France.=20

Batteries, largely manned by sailors, lined the cliff-tops within the town,=
 and the western base,=20

fronting the Plains of Abraham, was protected by fifteen hundred yards of i=
nsecure wall--for, after=20

all, Quebec had, despite the money spent upon it, never been scientifically=
 fortified, its=20

commanders having from the first relied chiefly upon its natural position a=
s a stronghold.  At=20

this huge lootage wrung=20

from America's brawn and brain for the year 1920? Here's where it went. Div=
idends to the people=20

who provided the capital, i.e., the scores of thousands of member bank stoc=
kholders, amounted to=20

just a pitiful 6 per cent or $5,654,018 out of $151,408,031, or about _one-=
thirtieth_ of the amount!=20

Ought the real providers of the real capital, upon which stupendous profits=
 were made, to be=20

fobbed off with _one-thirtieth_ of its real earnings? Ought their money to =
be commandeered at 6=20

per cent, profiteered upon at 160 per cent and they be practically sandbagg=
ed out of 154 per cent?=20

But it's the law, you say! Of course it's the law and that's one of the inf=
amies of the System! On the=20

one hand it sandbags commandeered investors, on the other hand it filches f=
rom industry and then=20

with both hands this legalized parasitism smugly pouches the proceeds into =
its bottomless bag of=20

greed!  These twelve octopi have a surplus account and then another recepta=
cle for loot called a=20

super-surplus account. There was swept for the year 1920 into the surplus a=
ccount $78,168,287=20

and into the super-surplus account $6,747,727. The remainder went as a fran=
chise tax, so called,=20

to the Government. In a subsequent chapter you will read of this franchise =
tax chimera.  The total=20

surplus of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks at the close of 1920, after the=
y had sandbagged out=20

a profit of 160.7 per cent upon their paid in capital for that year, amount=

of $202,036,367 upon a paid in capital of $94,234,000 or 214.8 per cent--ac=

twenty-five dollars made? Is that "democratizing" banking or is it bourboni=
zing banking? Is that=20

"emancipating credit" or is it shackling it with you wearing the shackles? =
Can any sane or honest=20

man--outside the ranks of its lolling beneficiaries--defend any such divisi=
on of profits as fair or just=20

or equitable? In this banking the lamb (the people) and the lion (the Feder=
al Reserve System) lie=20

down together--with the lamb inside the lion! But you say you're not a stoc=
kholder in any of the=20

commandeered Banks of the Federal Reserve System and aren't hurt. Very well=
 then. But the=20

chances are that you are a depositor in one of those member banks and you b=
each occupied by=20

Lower Town, where were the market, the commercial warehouses, a large share=
 of the business=20

establishments, and the homes of the trading and laboring classes. A narrow=
 strand, little more=20

than the width of a roadway, extended along the base of the cliffs westward=
, communicating with=20

the up-river country; another road led westward along the table-land above.=
 Thus the city obtained=20

its supplies from the interior both by highway and by river.  [Illustration=
: THE PLAINS OF=20

ABRAHAM ON THE MORNING OF THE BATTLE]  Entrance to the St. Charles side of =
the=20

promontory had been blocked by booms at the mouth of that river, protected =
by strong redoubts;=20

and off Lower Town was a line of floating batteries. Beyond the St. Charles=
, for a distance of=20

seven miles eastward to the gorge of the Montmorenci, Montcalm disposed the=
 greater part of his=20

forces, his position being a plain naturally protected by a steep slope des=
cending to the meadow=20



and tidal flats which here margin the St. Lawrence. This plain rises gradua=
lly from the St. Charles,=20

until at the Montmorenci cataract it attains a height of three hundred feet=
, and along the summit of=20

the slope were well-devised trenches. The gorge furnished a strong natural =
defence to the left=20

wing, for it could be forded only in the dense forest at a considerable dis=
tance above the falls, and=20

to force this approach would have been to invite an ambuscade. Wolfe conten=
ted himself,=20

therefore, with intrenching a considerable force along the eastern bank of =
the gorge, and thence=20

issuing for frontal attacks on the Beauport Flats--so called from the name =
of the village midway.=20

Montcalm had chosen this as the chief line of defence, on the theory that t=
he approach by the St.=20

Charles would be the one selected by the invaders; as, indeed, it long seem=
ed to Wolfe the only=20

possible path to the works of Upper Town.  Westward of the city, upon the t=
able-land, Bougainville=20

headed a corps of observation, supposed continually to patrol the St. Lawre=
nce cliff-tops and keep=20

communications open with the interior; but this precaution failed in the ho=
ur of need. The height of=20

Point L=C3=A9vis, across the river from the town, on the south bank, was un=
occupied. Montcalm had=20

wished to fortify this vantage-point, and thus block the river from both si=
des, but Vaudreuil had=20

overruled him, and the result was fatal. Other weak points in the defence w=
ere divided command=20

and the scarcity of food and ammunition, occasioned largely by Bigot=E2=80=
=99s rapacious knavery.  On=20

June 26 the British fleet anchored off the Isle of Orleans, thus dissipatin=
g the fond hopes of the=20

French that some disaster might prevent its approach. Three days later Wolf=
e=E2=80=99s men, now=20

encamped on the island at a safe distance from Montcalm=E2=80=99s guns, mad=
e an easy capture of Point=20

L=C3=A9vis, and there erected batteries which commanded the town. British s=
hips were, in=20

consequence, soon able to pass Quebec, under cover of the Point L=C3=A9vis =
guns, and destroy some=20

of the French shipping anchored in the upper basin; while landing parties h=
arried the country to the=20


_
the Federal Reserve System with a part of its huge conscripted reserve depo=
sits with no interest=20

paid on them. If member banks were getting the interest they should get fro=
m these octopi they=20

could pay you more interest than they do pay you.  The fact is that the rea=
l owners of the=20

commandeered capital and of the conscripted deposits get the "rind" only of=
 the huge "melon"=20

when it's cut. The juicy interior of the "melon" goes to the Federal Reserv=
e bureaucrats and to=20

their money-masters who batten and fatten and thrive on the pillagement of =
real production.=20

CHAPTER VII  HOW THE LOOT IS GATHERED   MEASURE now the reservoir of liquid=
 capital--

the hugest on supplies. Frequently the British forces were, upon these vari=
ous enterprises, divided=20

into three or four isolated divisions, which might have been roughly handle=
d by a venturesome foe.=20

But Montcalm rigidly maintained the policy of defence, his only offensive o=
perations being the=20

unsuccessful dispatch of fire-ships against the invading fleet.  On his par=
t, Wolfe made several=20

futile attacks upon the Beauport redoubts. The position was, however, too s=
trong for him to=20

master, and in one assault (July 31) he lost half of his landing party--nea=
rly five hundred killed,=20

wounded, and missing.[34] This continued ill-success fretted Wolfe and at l=
ast quite disheartened=20


_
planet--siphoned into the coffers of the Federal Reserve System. The first =
pool comes from the=20

capital of upwards of $100,000,000 commandeered at 6 per cent interest from=
 the member banks.=20

That is but a little pond or lakelet. Then there comes the ocean of money, =
over $1,800,000,000=20

conscripted at no per cent interest as reserve deposits from the member ban=
ks. This capital and=20

these deposits--almost $2,000,000,000--are held practically in perpetuity. =
It is the hugest reservoir=20

of liquid money on earth, it costs its manipulators and managers and contro=
llers not one red cent=20

of their own money and only a petty 6 per cent on a petty $100,000,000 of t=
he gigantic sum. In=20

other words, for an interest charge of practically $6,000,000 a year the Fe=
deral Reserve System=20

gets rapidly wearing on, and winter sets in early at Quebec; moreover, noth=
ing had yet been heard=20

of Amherst. There was, indeed, some talk of waiting until another season. H=
owever, more and=20

more British ships worked their way past the fort, and, by making frequent =
feints of landing at=20

widely separated points, caused Bougainville great annoyance. Montcalm was =
accordingly obliged=20

to weaken his lower forces by sending reinforcements to the plains west of =
the city. Thus, while=20

Wolfe was pining, French uneasiness was growing, for the British were now i=
ntercepting supplies=20

and reinforcements from both above and below, and Bougainville=E2=80=99s me=
n were growing weary of=20

constantly patrolling fifteen or twenty miles of cliffs.[35]  Meanwhile, le=
t us see how Amherst was=20

faring. At the=20


_
$2,000,000,000 at the absurd interest charge of three-tenths of one per cen=
t!  That is what it really=20

costs the money masters, the Invisible Empire of the U.S.A. and the Federal=
 Reserve System--

three-tenths of one per cent--for the practical control in perpetuity of th=
e mightiest mass of liquid=20

wealth ever massed on earth! Look at this in cold blood! Figure what it wou=
ld mean to you if you=20

could get the use of a petty $100,000 at three-tenths of one per cent inter=
est! Then figure what it=20

means to them to have the use of 20,000 times $100,000 at three-tenths of o=
ne per cent interest.=20

Gives you an general assembled five thousand provincials and sixty-five hun=
dred regulars at the=20

head of Lake George. He had previously dispatched Brigadier Prideaux with f=
ive thousand=20

regulars and provincials to reduce Niagara, and Brigadier Stanwix, who had =
been of Bradstreet=E2=80=99s=20

party the year before, to succor Pittsburg, now in imminent danger from Fre=
nch bush-rangers and=20

Indians who were swarming at Presque Isle, Le B=C5=93uf, and Venango.  Amhe=
