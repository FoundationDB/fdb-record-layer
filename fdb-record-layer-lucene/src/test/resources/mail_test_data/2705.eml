philodendron monstera necessary.(464) Says one prayer:       Do not permit =
that the venom should master his limbs [of the     defunct], ... that he sh=
ould be penetrated by any male dead, or     any female dead; or that the sh=
adow of any spirit should haunt him     (or her).(465)   M. Chabas adds:  s=
uch a paradise; then he shook his head, saying, "If I were Porthos and D'Ar=
tagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to him, I k=
now what I should say to it."  As to Planchet, he thought of little or noth=
ing, but was happy as a hunting-hound in his old philodendron monstera nece=

er his limbs [of the     defunct], ... that he should be penetrated by any =

his house falls sick and dies.   Exclaims the translator, whose cultured in=
stincts are revolted:       If=20

one had not these words under our eyes, one could never believe     in such=
 servitude at the=20

epoch of the Ramessides.(463)   We belong to the nineteenth century of the =
Christian era, and are=20

therefore at the height of civilization, and under the benign sway and enli=
ghtening influence of the=20

Christian Church, instead of being subject to the Pagan Gods of old. Nevert=
heless we personally=20

know dozens, and have heard of hundreds, of educated, highly-intellectual p=
ersons who would as=20

soon think of committing suicide as of starting on any business on a Friday=
, of dining at a table=20

where thirteen sit down, or of beginning a long journey on a Monday. Napole=
on the Great became=20

pale when he saw three candles lit on a table. Moreover, we may gladly conc=
ur with De Mirville in=20

this, at any rate, that such "superstitions" are "the outcome of observatio=
n and experience." If the=20

former had never agreed with facts, the authority of the _Calendar_, he thi=
nks, would not have=20

lasted for a week. But to resume:       _Genethliacal influences_: The chil=
d born on the 5th day of=20

Paophi     with the court on several occasions; for at that time Villars-Co=
tterets was a royal=20

residence. He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted =
at the Dauphin d'Or.=20

There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant, but=
 that Porthos was not=20

at Bracieux. Porthos had, in fact, been involved in a dispute with the Bish=
op of Noyon in regard to=20

the Pierrefonds property, which adjoined his own, and weary at length of a =
legal controversy which=20

was beyond his comprehension, he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds=
 and added that=20

name to his others. He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefo=
nds, and resided on=20

his new estate.  The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel =
until the next day; the=20

horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest. It is true they might=
 have taken others, but=20

there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet, as we have seen, had=
 no liking for forests=20

after dark.  There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and th=
at was starting on a=20

journey with a hungry stomach. Accordingly, D'Artagnan, on awaking, found h=
is breakfast waiting=20

for him. It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions=
 resumed also his former=20

justified Khous, _i.e._,=20

those who had been absolved from sin by Osiris when they were D'Artagnan.  =
It was nearly eight=20

o'clock when they set out again. Their course was clearly defined: they wer=
e to follow the road=20

toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right.  The mo=

and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams s=
hone through the misty=20

glades, like curtains of golden gauze.  In=20

were the guilty Khous, "the Khous dead a second time;" these were the damne=
d. Second death=20

did not annihilate them, but they were doomed to wander about and to tortur=
e people. Their=20

existence had phases analogous to those of the living man, a bond so intima=

and the living that one sees how the observation of religious funeral rites=
 and exorcisms the=20

foliage, and the stems of two old oak trees, the refuge of the squirrel, st=
artled by the travelers,=20

were in deep shadow.  There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a pe=

flowers and leaves, which delighted the heart. D'Artagnan, sick of the clos=
