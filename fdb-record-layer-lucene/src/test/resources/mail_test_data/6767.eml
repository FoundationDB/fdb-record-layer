Chart 10)            arts of this country, and as much interest has been ex=
cited in Paris concerning=20

our porcelain clays, we should feel greatly obliged by the transmission to =
us of any specimens of=20

American porcelain clays, with memoranda of the place, the quantity, the de=
pth at which obtained,=20

the difficulty of obtaining, and, generally, all the peculiar circumstances=
. We will take care that their=20

value shall be ascertained, if they appear promising, and a proper return s=
hall be made to the=20

proprietor.  To those of our readers who may not be familiar with this subj=
ect, we would however=20

take the liberty to remark, that porcelain clays generally arise from the d=
ecomposition of granite,=20

and particularly of that kind which is denominated graphic granite, and whi=
ch abounds with=20

feldspar. It is, therefore, in the primitive countries that we are chiefly =
to expect them--such as New-

England, and part of the high country of the middle and southern states.  I=
t should be observed,=20

that if a clay, otherwise apparently good, burns red, it contains iron, and=
 is unfit for porcelain;=20

although it may serve well enough for more common and coarse earthen ware. =

_Native Sulphur from Java._   Through the kindness of Mr. I. Huntington, re=
cently returned from=20

Java, we have received from that Island some fine specimens of native sulph=
ur. They are very=20

pure, of an orange yellow, slightly shaded with white, and occasionally wit=
h red; some of the=20

cavities are lined with delicate crystals. What gives them particular inter=
est is, that they are=20

believed to be from that "large, and now nearly extinct, volcano, about six=
ty miles from the town of=20

Batavia, at the bottom of which (of the crater) lie large quantities of nat=
ive sulphur, even many=20

sulphuric acid exists, and=20

from which it flows down the mountain, and through the country below, a riv=
er of the same acid.=20

(See Tilloch's Phil. Mag. Vol. XLII. p. 182.) It is a most curious phenomen=

are indebted to the=20

Reverend Elias Cornelius, and to Mr. John H. Kain, for a collection of the =
calcareous incrustations=20

of Wier's Cave, in Virginia.  The stalactites, and stalagmites, and various=
 incrustations, are of=20

uncommon size and beauty. Some of the stalactites have a delicate whiteness=
, and a brilliancy=20

arising from their crystallized structure, which, with the regularity of th=
eir forms, give them a fair=20

title to rank with those of the famous caverns in the Peak of Derbyshire, i=
n the island of Antiparos,=20

&c.  In these stalactites, the structure is most remarkably distinct, both =
in the fibrous and=20

concentric lamellar form. In this collection were observed many forms of th=
e crystallized hard=20

carbonates of lime, of Count Bournon.  For a description of the cavern from=
 which these=20

specimens came, we refer to the succeeding memoir, by Mr. Kain.     ART. X.=
 _Remarks on the=20



Mineralogy and Geology of the Northwestern part of the State of Virginia, a=
nd the Eastern part of=20

the State of Tennessee._ By Mr. JOHN H. KAIN, of Tennessee.   The most prom=
inent as well as=20

the most beautiful feature of this country, is that succession of mountain =
and valley, ridge and=20

vale, which we meet with in traversing its surface. The grand range of Alle=
ghany mountains enters=20

Virginia about the 39th degree of north latitude; and, pursuing a southwest=
ern course, spreads out=20

upon the east end of Tennessee, and terminates near the southern boundary l=
ine of that state, in=20

the Alabama territory; and about the 34th parallel of north latitude. In th=
is view are included the=20

Blue Mountains, the North Mountains, the Allegheny, (properly so called) th=
e Cumberland, Clinch,=20

Iron, and Smoky mountains, together with a variety of smaller mountains, sp=
urs, and ridges, all=20

running parallel to each other, from the northeast to the southwest; and al=
l, I believe I may say,=20

covered with forests, and presenting to the eye of the naturalist a most in=
teresting field for=20

speculation and improvement.  With a few exceptions, the geologist meets wi=
th none of those=20

remarkable appearances which indicate the changes and convulsions which hav=
e been wrought=20

by time, the great enemy of nature. Occasionally we are presented with a vi=
ew of a sublime=20

precipice, formed by a section which a river appears to have made for itsel=
f through an opposing=20

mountain; and the large masses of ruins, which lie scattered around such a =
place, seem, to the=20

imagination of the solitary traveller, the historical records of commotions=
, awful even in retrospect.=20

Most commonly, however, the mountains seem to have lain for ages in undistu=
rbed repose; and=20

the streams of water, when they have crossed them, have sought an easy pass=
age through the=20

ravines, which do not so often divide a mountain, or ridge, at right angles=
, as wind between the=20

ends of two opposing spurs, which pass each other, gradually declining into=
 the champaign=20

country at their mutual base. Through this whole extent of country we rarel=
y meet with any=20

remarkable falls of water; the obvious reason of which is, that the rocks a=
re so soft that they are=20

easily worn down to the level of the beds of rivers. But shoals, or shallow=
s, are frequent, and are=20

formed by beds of rounded sandstone, spread out into a broad base, over whi=
ch the water often=20

rushes with no small violence and noise.  The mountains are generally, thou=
gh not always, sterile,=20

and produce nothing but forest trees; but the valleys are, with hardly an e=
xception, rich, and=20

productive of every variety of "grass and herb yielding seed, and fruit-tre=
e yielding fruit." Nor are=20

they less favoured in the mineral kingdom; possessing the greatest abundanc=
e of all the most=20

useful and necessary minerals, of which we shall now proceed to speak in or=
der.  All the country=20

included under the boundaries mentioned above, with the exception of some p=
rimitive ranges of=20

mountains on the southeastern side, is apparently _transition_. This, it wi=
ll be seen by a reference=20

to Mr. Maclure's excellent map, will extend the boundary of his transition =
class considerably farther=20

northwest, and make it include Cumberland Mountain and all East Tennessee. =
This would be=20

evident from comparing the northwestern part of Virginia, which Mr. Maclure=
 has included in his=20

transition tract with all East Tennessee. Every mineralogist must observe t=
he identity of the=20

minerals of the two countries as well as that of their stratification and g=
eneral formation. The=20

limestone in the valleys, and the sandstone on the mountains, lie in strata=
 which make an angle of=20

from 25 to 45 degrees with the horizon. The limestone bears the impressions=
 of shells, but rarely,=20

if ever, of vegetables, and contains beds of hornstone, but not of flint, o=
r what can properly be=20

called flint.  The rock which lies in the lowest valleys, and often rises i=
nto pretty high hills, and is=20

seen forming bluffs on the banks of the rivers, is _limestone_: it is of a =
dark blue, approaching to a=20



gray, as it is exposed to the air, and often appearing quite white. Its fra=
cture is compact in one=20

direction; in another it is more or less slaty in its structure. It is inte=
rspersed with veins of the=20

crystallized carbonate of lime, more or less perfect, and of a pure but opa=
que white. Another=20

variety of this limestone, not so abundant, is that which is white and red,=
 having the white and red=20

spots intimately mingled. Its structure is similar to the other kind.  Lyin=
g in beds of this limestone,=20

parallel to, and imbedded in, its strata, is a stone, which, from its globu=
lar form, its hardness, and=20

its colour, has been usually mistaken for flint. On comparing it with the f=
lint of chalk-beds, we find it=20

much less translucent, its colour darker, and its hues duller; and its roug=
h and irregular fracture,=20

compared with the easy, smooth, and conchoidal cleavage of the true flint, =
decides it to be=20

hornstone. It is found also forming considerable distinct beds on the hills=
; and is seen in detached=20

pieces, and irregular pebbles, covering many of the ridges.  Alternating wi=
th the beds of limestone,=20

and possessing the same formation, is a soft _clay slate_. _Soapstone_ is f=
ound in it.  As soon as=20

we ascend the mountains, we meet with a slaty sand-stone of various compact=
ness, as it=20

possesses more or less iron, often forming an excellent iron ore. A variety=
 of this iron ore has been=20

lately turned to a good use, in the manufacture of a red paint, near Knoxvi=
lle, Tennessee. Different=20

varieties of this sandstone possess different qualities. It is converted by=
 the inhabitants into=20

millstones, grindstones, and whetstones. Interspersed among the sandstone o=
f the mountains we=20

often find very beautiful and interesting specimens of hornstones, assuming=
 a resemblance to all=20

the silicious stones, from the chalcedony to the jasper. In this extensive =
range of mountains, many=20

other minerals exist, of which we shall treat more particularly hereafter. =
The limestone, slate, and=20

sandstone, as far as the writer's knowledge extends, so to speak, _form the=
 country_; the=20

limestone and clay slate dipping under the sandstone. Gypsum, coal, sulphat=
e of barytes, &c. are=20

found in these, and we shall now speak of their localities.  _Gypsum._--Thi=
s valuable mineral=20

production exists in Washington County, Virginia, 20 miles north of Abingdo=
n, in the vicinity of=20

Saltville. It is similar, in every respect, to the plaster of Nova Scotia, =
and devoted by the farmers of=20

that part of Virginia, and Tennessee, to similar purposes.  _Coal_ is said =
to exist in immense=20

quantities in the Cumberland Mountain. A bed of it is wrought near Knoxvill=
e, Tennessee. It is of=20

an excellent quality; but wood is so abundant that it is used only in forge=
s.  _Sulphate of Barytes._-
