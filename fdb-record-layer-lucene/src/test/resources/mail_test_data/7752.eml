said Ameni, _
pressure, and the desirable bishopric passed to another Dominican, Fray Jua=
n Solano.  The=20

designation of Las Casas for the bishopric was made by Cardinal Loaysa and =
the other members=20

of the India Council and, nothing daunted by his refusal, they insisted tha=
t some one of the newly=20

founded bishoprics in America should be governed by the man who, of all oth=
ers, possessed the=20

highest qualifications, the most  "You felt it--and you will repent of it, =
well and good," replied=20

Ameni. "But you have not given a true account of all that happened.  Why ha=
ve you concealed that=20

Bent-Anat--Rameses' daughter--was mixed up in the fray, and that she saved =
you by announcing=20

her name to the people, and commanding them to leave you alone?  When you g=
ave her the lie=20

before all the people, was it because you did not believe that=20


_
and the sincerest interest in apostolic work amongst the natives.  The firs=
t bishop of the diocese of=20

Chiapa having just died, he was designated for the vacancy, and this time h=
e was constrained by=20

the arguments of persons of influence, notably the director of the College =
of San Gregorio in=20

Valladolid, to put aside his scruples and to accept a position in which he =
could most benefit his=20

beloved Indians.  That the diocese of Chiapa was the poorest in the new Wor=
ld, and so barren of=20

revenues that a subsidy was furnished by the Emperor to enable the Bishop t=
o live at all,=20

contributed perhaps as much as anything to reconcile Las Casas to his new d=
ignity. (54) He=20

repaired to Toledo and appeared before the chapter of his Order which was b=
eing held there, to=20

ask that some monks should be furnished him for his new diocese.  Las Casas=
 was preconised in=20

Rome on the feast of Pentecost, 1542, after which a whole year elapsed befo=
re the necessary=20

bulls reached Spain and the friars who were to accompany him were chosen.  =
After arranging for=20

the reunion of these friars, he set out for Seville, where, on the 30th of =
March, 1544, he was=20

consecrated bishop in the chapel of the Dominican monastery of St. Paul by =
Bishop Loaysa,=20

nephew of the cardinal of the same name, assisted by the Bishops of Cordoba=
 and Trujillo in=20

Honduras. On the 21st of March, the newly consecrated Bishop wrote the foll=
owing letter to the=20

India Council:     VERY HIGH AND POTENT LORDS: after we left the Court on T=
uesday the 4th of=20

this month, we arrived within sixteen days at this city, in spite of the he=
avy roads and great rains=20

we encountered.  Now, you who stand so firmly on so high a platform--now yo=
u standard- bearer=20

of the truth answer me."  Pentaur had turned pale at his master's words, an=
d said, as he looked at=20

the Regent:  "We are not alone."  "Truth is one!"  said Ameni coolly.  "Wha=
t ycu can reveal to me,=20

can also be heard by this noble lord, the Regent of the king himself.  Did =
you recognize Bent-Anat,=20

or not?"  "The lady who rescued me was like her, and yet unlike," answered =
the poet, whose blood=20

was roused by the subtle irony of his Superior's words. "And if I had been =
as sure that she was the=20

princess, as I am that you are the man who once held me in honor, and who a=
re now trying to=20

humiliate me, I would all the more have acted as I did to spare a lady who =
is more like a goddess=20

than a woman, and who, to save an unworthy wretch like me, stooped from a t=
hrone to the dust."=20

"Still the poet--the preacher!"  said Ameni.  Then he added severely. "I be=
g for a short and clear an=20

swer.  We know for certain that the princess took part in the festival in t=
he disguise of a woman of=20

low rank, for she again declared herself to Paaker; and we know that it was=
 she who saved you.=20

But did you know that she meant to come across the Nile?"  "How should I?" =
 asked Pentaur.=20

"Well, did you believe that it was Bent-Anat whom you saw before you when s=
he ventured on to=20

the scene of conflict?"  "I did believe it," replied Pentaur; he shuddered =
and cast down his eyes.=20

"Then it was most audacious to drive away the king's daughter as an imposto=
r."  "It was," said=20

Pentaur.  "But for my sake she had risked the honor of her name, and that o=
f her royal=20

found the fleet ready to sail down the river, but on account of the calm we=
ather and want of wind,=20

no vessel has been able to sail until to-day, Friday.  The ship on which th=
e friars were to sail only=20

got as far as San Domingo and there, the cedulas did not make it perfectly =
clear that the officials=20

should pay their passage to Puerto de Caballos; because the cedulas say tha=
t from there they are=20

to be paid to Honduras, because they life and freedom for--"  "We have hear=
d enough," interrupted=20

Ameni.  "Not so," the Regent interposed. "What became of the girl you had s=
aved?"  "An old witch,=20

Hekt by name, a neighbor of Pinem's, took her and her grandmother into her =
cave," answered the=20

poet; who was then, by the high- priest's order, taken back to the temple-p=
rison.  Scarcely had he=20

disappeared when the Regent exclaimed:  "A dangerous man! an enthusiast! an=

k it better to go to=20

Quacaqualco; so that should they not think it better to go to Quacaqualco t=

reason, be unable to leave Hispaniola.  Therefore I  "And of his daughter,"=

"But he is handsome and of powerful speech," replied Ani.  "I claim him as =
my prisoner, for he has=20

killed one of my soldiers."  Ameni's countenance darkened, and he answered =
very sternly:  "It=20
