Lotus, not being found in either Judaea or Europe, was replaced by the wate=
r-lily. In every Greek=20

and Latin Church, in all the pictures of the Annunciation, the Archangel Ga=
briel is depicted with=20

this trinitarian symbol in his hand standing before Mary, while above the c=
hief altar or under the=20

dome, the Eye of the Eternal is painted within a triangle, made to replace =
the Hebrew Yod or God.=20

Truly, says Ragon, there was a time when numbers and alphabetical character=
s meant something=20

more than they do now--the images of a mere insignificant sound.       Thei=
r mission was nobler=20

then. Each of them represented by its     form a complete sense, which, bes=
ides the meaning of=20

the word, had     a double(189) interpretation adapted to a dual doctrine. =
Thus when     the sages=20

desired to write something to be understood only by the     savants, they c=
onfabulated a story, a=20

dream, or some other     fictitious subject with personal names of men and =
localities, that=20

revealed by their lettered characters the true meaning of the     author by=
 that narrative. Such were=20

all their religious     creations.(190)   Every appellation and term had it=
s _raison d'etre_. The name=20

of a plant or mineral denoted its nature to the Initiate at the first glanc=
e. The essence of everything=20

was easily perceived by him once that it was figured by such characters. Th=
e Chinese characters=20

have preserved much of this graphic and pictorial character to this day, th=
ough the secret of the=20

full system is lost. Nevertheless, even now, there are those among that nat=
ion who can write a=20

long narrative, a volume, on one page; and the symbols that are explained h=
istorically, allegorically=20

and astronomically, have survived until now.  Moreover, there exists a univ=
ersal language among=20

the Initiates, which an Adept, and even a disciple, of any nation may under=
stand by reading it in=20

his own language. We Europeans, on the contrary, possess only one graphic s=
