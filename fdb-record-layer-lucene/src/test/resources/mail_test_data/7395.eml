philodendron monstera game--as reasons go in practical politics. But we are side-stepping the real issue. I've asked you for a promise: will you give it?"

or cause to be done anything that will make me stand forth as a self-convicted liar before the 

people of this State. I want you to promise me that you will cut out all the deals, all the briberies, all 

the bargainings, all the--"  "Oh, say; see here!" protested the man under fire; "you've got the wrong 

pig by the ear, Evan. I'm not the Transcontinental Railway Company!"  "I know you are not. But, to 

a greater degree than any other official in the local management, you have Mr. McVickar's 

confidence. If you don't feel competent to handle the thing on your own responsibility, of course it's 

your privilege to pass it up to those who have the authority. In that case, I wish to make one point 

clear: you're the man I'm going to hold up to the rack. I can't afford to spread myself over the entire 

management, and I don't mean to try. I'm going to look to you, Dick, for the backing of the clean 

sheet, and I warn you in all soberness that there must be no blots on it; no compromises; no 

whipping of the devil around the stump."  "Great Scott!" murmured Gantry. "And you're on the pay-

rolls, the same as the rest of us! But candidly, as man to man, Evan, the thing can't be done, you 

know. We've got to play the game; they'll eat us alive if we don't. You needn't figure in it at all; it 

was a mistake letting Sim Hathaway get to you, and I said so at the time. But your--er--the powers 

that be that the distance from New York to Ceylon, near the southern cape of India, is four-fifths of 

that around Cape Good Hope. The heavy dues for passing through the canal are an item, and it 

would not pay to save two thousand five hundred miles out of twelve thousand five hundred."  "But 

the saving from London to Bombay is forty-four per cent," added Mr. Woolridge. "From Marseilles 

to the same port it is nearly sixty per cent. The United States 'is not in it'"--  "_Are_ not in it, papa," 

interposed Miss Blanche with a silvery laugh.  "No, my dear; _is_ not in it," returned the magnate, 

with a loving smile. "I know the government is said to have ruled for the plural, but I don't accept 

the ruling. Why, what does _E pluribus Unum_ mean if not the singular number? For what did we 

fight the War of the Rebellion if not to prove that the United States _is_ one government, and 

_are_ not forty-four of them at the present moment."  "But the grammar, papa?" asked Blanche. 

"The grammar is all right, my child. What are the news, Blanche? The company is or are, just as 

you pay your money and take your choice," said the father, chucking the fair maiden under the 

chin.  "Our friend is quite right, and, so far as the canal is concerned, the United States _is_ not in 

it," added the commander, laughing at the turn the conference had taken.  "How far have we gone 

so far, Captain?" asked Miss Blanche.

all up. It sha'n't happen again; I can promise you that much, anyway."  Blount caught quickly at the 

hesitant pause.  "Who were 'the powers that be' in Hathaway's case, Dick?" he inquired.  "I can't 

tell you that; honestly, I can't, Evan," was the anxious  "Ten o'clock," he replied, consulting his 

watch. "We have been moving at this snail's pace for five hours, and made twenty-five miles, or 

forty kilometres. In five more we shall come to El Kantara, where the caravan route from Egypt into 

Asia crosses the

refusal. "Don't ask me."  "All right; then I shall assume that Mr. McVickar was responsible," said 

Blount calmly, thus proving that he had not taken his degree in the law school for nothing.  "Oh, 

hold on! You mustn't do that, either!" protested the man who was figuring most unwillingly as the 

occupant of the witness stand.  "Thank you," returned the postgraduate, with the true Blount smile. 

"Now I know that it was my father. No; you needn't deny it; I suppose it was  "Do the camels have 

to swim across the canal?" asked Mrs. Blossom.  "They do not; but it cost the canal company 

some money to save them the trouble of doing so," replied the captain. "El Kantara means 'the 

bridge;' and there used to be one across the outlet of a lake there. The bridge was removed by the 

company, and a ferry substituted for it."  "I suppose all vessels have to go through the canal in the 

daytime," said Mrs. Woolridge.  "Not at all; the system of
