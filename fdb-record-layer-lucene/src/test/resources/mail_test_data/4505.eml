abroad, but they have   rendered good service to men of letters here at hom=

existence, down to=20

Wyclyffe's   _Three Treatises on the Church_, recently edited by the Rev. D=
r.   Todd--in which the=20

utility of "NOTES AND QUERIES" is publicly   recognised in terms which are =
highly gratifying to=20

us.    We do not make these statements in any vainglorious spirit. We   bel=
ieve our success is due=20

to the manner in which, thanks to the   ready assistance of zealous and lea=

Correspondents, we have been enabled to supply a want which all   literary =
men have felt more or=20

less: and believing that the more   we are known, and the wider our circula=

 [Sidenote: EXCHANGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS]  Exchanging=20

photographs is regarded as one of the special privileges of college life. I=
t would be interesting to=20

know how large a per cent. of the income made by photographers in the Unite=
d States comes from=20

college students. The exchange of photographs between young men and young w=
omen in the=20

same class in college is allowable. Such exchange is, in a sense, official =
and impersonal, and is=20

warranted by that fact. When a young woman bestows her photograph under suc=
h circumstances=20

she should write upon it the name of the college and the date of the class.=
 This will indicate clearly=20

that the giving is not a matter of sentiment. The promiscuous exchange of p=
hotographs between=20

young men and young women at college is bad. Only a brother or a lover or a=

ON THE CALENDAR.=20

What every one learns from the almanac, over and above Easter and its conse=
quences for the=20

current year, is that what happens this year is no index at all to what wil=
l happen next year. And=20

even those who preserve their almanacs, and compare them in long series, ne=
ver have is=20

something too intimate about such a gift to make it an object of general di=
stribution.         *       *=20

*       *       *  One more =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t=E2=80=9D occurs to the w=
riter as applicable to the relations of young men and=20

women as fellow students. Don=E2=80=99t use the college slang or jargon whe=
n you talk together. If it is=20

impossible to keep it altogether out of the talk, use as little of it as po=
ssible. Men students may=20

carry on conversation through this medium and it is sometimes very funny, b=
ut it was not intended=20

for feminine purposes. It is disgusting to=20


_
so far as I know, to lay hands upon any law connecting the Easters of diffe=
rent years, without=20

having had recourse to the very complicated law on which the whole calendar=
 is constructed.=20

Nevertheless there does exist a simple relation which reduces the uncertain=
ty in the proportion of=20

five to two; so that by means of one past almanac, we may name _two_ Sunday=
s, one or the other=20

of which must be Easter Sunday. I have never seen this relation noticed, th=
ough I have read much=20

(for these days) on the calendar: has any one of your readers ever met with=
 it?  Let us make a=20

_cycle_ of the days on which Easter day can fall, so that when we come to t=
he last (April 25), we=20

begin again at the first (March 22). Thus, six days in advance of April 23,=
 comes March 25; seven=20

days behind March 24, comes April 21.  The following is the _rule_, after w=
hich come two cases of=20

_exception_:--  Take any year which is _not_ leap year, then, by passing ov=
er _eleven_ years, we=20

either leave Easter day unaltered, or throw it back a week; and it is nearl=
y three to one that we=20

have to leave it unaltered. Thus 1941 is not leap year, and eleven years mo=
re give 1952; both=20

have April 13 for Easter day; but of 1943 and 1954, the first gives April 2=
5, the second April 18.=20

Take any year which _is_ leap year, then, by passing over _eleven_ years, w=
e either throw Easter=20

one day forward, or six days back; and it is about three to two that it wil=
l be thrown forward. Thus=20

1852 (leap year) gives April 11, but 1863 gives April 5.  But when, in pass=
ing over eleven years,=20

we pass over 1700, 1800, or any Gregorian omission of leap year, the common=
 year takes the rule=20

just described for leap year; while, if we begin with leap year, the passag=
e over eleven years=20

throws Easter _two_ days forward, or _five_ days back. There is another cla=
ss of single=20

exceptions, occurring at long intervals, which it is hardly worth while to =
examine. The only case=20

which occurs between 1582 and 2000, is when the first year is 1970.  Any nu=
mber of instances=20

may be taken from my _Book of Almanacs_, and the general rule may be easily=
 seen to belong=20

also to the old style. Those who understand the construction of the calenda=
r will very easily find=20

the explanation of the whole.      A. DE MORGAN.   INEDITED LETTERS OF SWIF=
T.    [By the=20

great kindness of a correspondent who has placed at our   disposal two hith=
erto inedited letters=20

written by Swift, we are   enabled to present the following literal copies =
of them to our   readers.=20

They are obviously addressed to Frances Lady Worsley, only   daughter of Th=
omas Lord Viscount=20

Weymouth, and wife of Sir Robert   Worsley, Baronet, and the mother of Lady=
 Carteret. In Sir=20

Walter   Scott's edition of Swift's _Works_ (vol. xvii. p. 302.) will be   =
found one letter from the=20

Dean of St. Patrick to Lady Worsely; and   in vol. xviii. p. 26. is the let=
ter from that lady to the Dean=20

which accompanied the escritoire alluded to in the second of the   two lett=
ers which we now print.=20

This appears from Swift's   endorsement of it--"Lady Worsley, with a presen=
t of a writing-box=20

japanned by herself."]  "Madam,--It is now three years and a half since I h=
ad the Honor to see=20

Your Ladyship, and I take it very ill that You have not finished my Box abo=
ve a Month. But this is=20

allways the way that You Ladyes treat your adorers in their absence. Howeve=
r upon Mrs. Barber's=20

account I will pardon You, because she tells me it is the handsomest piece =
of work she ever saw;=20

and because you have accepted the honor to be one of her protectors, and ar=
e determined to be=20

one of her principall recommenders and encouragers. I am in some doubt whet=
her envy had not a=20

great share in your work, for you were I suppose informed that my Lady Cart=
eret had made for me=20

with her own hands the finest box in Ireland; upon which you grew jealous, =
and resolved to outdo=20

her by making for me the finest box in England; for so Mrs. Barber assures =
me. In short, I am quite=20

overloaden with favors from Your Ladyship and your Daughter; and what is wo=
rse, those loads will=20



lye upon my Shoulders as long as I live. But I confess my self a little ung=
rateful, because I cannot=20

deny Your Ladyship to have been the most constant of all my Goddesses, as I=
 am the most=20

constant of all your Worshippers. I hope the Carterets and the Worsleys are=
 all happy and in=20

health, and You are obliged to let Sir Robert Worsley know that I am his mo=
st humble Servant; but=20

You need say nothing of my terms he would use in addressing his chum. On th=
e other hand it is=20

the attempted mannishness of tone popular with some women students that pre=
judices many=20

worthy people against coeducational schools. The use of college slang outsi=
de the boundaries of=20

college life is bad form even for a man, and gives a provincial tone to his=
 talk.  [Sidenote: CLASS=20

FESTIVITIES]  The opportunities for special festivities are many in coeduca=
tional life, and there is=20

a strong temptation to overdo on the social side. Class dances and receptio=
ns, fraternity and=20

sorority parties, commencement gaieties offer frequent allurement. A studen=
t, woman or man,=20

should sift out this matter of recreation in his own mind and should determ=
ine how much pleasure=20

of this kind he can afford financially and without detriment to his health =
or his class standing. Some=20

social diversion he needs. To develop on the mental side only is a mistake.=
 Too much diversion is=20

a far more serious mistake.  It goes without saying that, at the parties gi=
ven by students, there=20

should be proper chaperonage. This is particularly necessary in entertainme=
nts, often quite=20

elaborate in character, given in chapter houses of the fraternities. The fa=
ct that young men are=20

hosts to the young women on such occasions makes it the more necessary that=
 chaperons should=20

be numerous and not too vivacious in character.         *       *       *  =
     *       *  [Sidenote: THE=20

DEAN OF WOMEN]  There should be in every coeducational school a dean of wom=
en. The duties=20

of such a position include regulation, as far as possible, of social relati=
ons between the young men=20

and young women of the institution as well as actual instruction, if necess=
ary, on the more=20

important matters of social etiquette. In this official, young girls of the=
 institution should find a friend=20

to whom they may go for advice on vexed questions. Where there is no formal=
 office of the kind=20

named, the service indicated may sometimes be rendered by women members of =
the faculty.=20

Some years ago, in a western town, the Chair of English Literature was occu=
pied by a woman who=20

took upon herself the burden of improving the manners of the student body, =
largely composed of=20

sturdy young farmers and girls from country towns. Once a year in the colle=
ge chapel, she gave a=20

lecture on this subject in which she stated plainly what she thought necess=
ary for the social=20

improvement of the school. Many a young man was helped over awkward places =
by her advice;=20

many a young woman saved from some escapade which she might have blushed la=
ter to own.=20

The value of such instruction is inestimable.  When opportunity offers for =
consultation with such a=20

guide and teacher, the uninstructed student should avail himself of it. Whe=
n such a privilege is not=20

procurable, one=E2=80=99s own sense of propriety, if diligently sought for =
and obeyed, will often lead one=20

out of an awkward situation for which one does not know the formal rule.   =
      *       *       *       *=20

*  [Sidenote: HIGH-SCHOOL PARTIES]  Many parents who intend to send their d=
aughters to=20

women=E2=80=99s colleges allow them to take a preparatory course in a coedu=
cational high school. The=20

best high schools of that character now take the very important precaution =
of hiring a dean, whose=20

duty it is especially to watch over the girl students. High-school sororiti=
es and all secret=20

organizations are frowned on if not positively prohibited in these schools,=
 as it has been=20

demonstrated that they interfere with proper attention to studies and lead =
to many undesirable=20

relationships. Class hops and receptions suitably chaperoned furnish suffic=
ient diversion. One=20



hopes that one of the results of the appointing of deans in the high school=
s will be a change in the=20

manner of dressing of many high-school girls. It is too often both inartist=
ic and in bad taste. A=20

schoolgirl should be dressed prettily, but in a quiet and appropriate way. =
    CHAPTER XIV  THE=20

CHAPERON   IN some parts of America the chaperon is, like Sairey Gamp=E2=80=
=99s interesting friend,=20

=E2=80=9CMrs. Harris,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94a mere figment of the imagination. N=
owhere in America does she occupy the=20

perfectly defined position that she holds in Europe; nowhere in America are=
 her duties so arduous=20

as those imposed on her in older countries. The idea that a chaperon for yo=
ung people is=20

necessary on all occasions offends the taste of the American. It is even op=
posed to his code of=20

good manners. That a young woman should never be able in her father=E2=80=
