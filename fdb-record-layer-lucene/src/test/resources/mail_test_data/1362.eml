you to take this golden casket.  _Sharvilaka._ One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow 

and the wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the candle. I keep about me a moth 

for the express purpose of extinguishing candles. I will let him enter the flame. This is his place 

and hour. May this moth which I here release, depart to flutter above the flame in varying circles. 

The breeze from the insect's wings has translated the flame into accursed darkness. Or shall I not 

rather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic family? For my father was a man 

who knew the four Vedas, who would not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman, 

I am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl Madanika. Now I will grant the 

Brahman's wish. [_He reaches out for the casket._]  _Maitreya._ How cold your fingers are, man! 

_Sharvilaka._ What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching water. Well, I will put my 

hand in my armpit [_He warms his left hand and takes the casket._]  _Maitreya._ Have you got it? 

_Sharvilaka._ I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.  P. 80.9]  _Maitreya._ Now I shall 

sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has sold his wares.  _Sharvilaka._ O great Brahman, sleep 

a hundred years! Alas that a Brahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake of 

Madanika, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged in darkness.      A curse on poverty, I 

say!       'T is stranger to the manly will;     This act that shuns the light of day       I curse indeed, 

but do it still.                           19  Well then, I must go to Vasantasena's house to buy Madanika's 

freedom. [_He walks about and looks around him._] Ah, I think I hear footsteps. I hope they are 

not those of policemen. Never mind. I will pretend to be a pillar, and wait. But after all, do 

policemen exist for me, for Sharvilaka? Why, I am      A cat for crawling, and a deer for flight,     A 

hawk for rending, and a dog for sight     To judge the strength of men that wake or sleep,     A 

snake, when 't is advisable to creep,     Illusion's self, to seem a saint or rogue,     Goddess of 

Speech in understanding brogue;     A light in blackest night, in holes a lizard I can be,     A horse 

on terra firma, and a ship upon the sea.             20  And again:      Quick as a snake, and steady 

as a hill;     In flight the prince of birds can show no greater skill;     In searching on the ground I am 

as keen as any hare,     In strength I am a lion, and a wolf to rend and tear.        21  _Radanika._ 

[_Entering._] Dear me! Vardhamanaka went to sleep in the outer court, and now he is not there. 

Well, I will call Maitreya. [_She walks about._]  [51.1. S.  _Sharvilaka._ [_Prepares to strike down 

Radanika, but first takes a look._] What! a woman? Good! I go.                        [_Exit._         *       * 

*       *       *  _Radanika._ [_Recoiling in terror._] Oh, oh, a thief has cut a hole in the wall of our 

house and is escaping, I must go and wake Maitreya. [_She approaches Maitreya._] Oh, Maitreya, 

get up, get up! A thief has cut a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.  _Maitreya._ 

[_Rising._] What do you mean, wench? "A hole in the wall has cut a thief and has escaped"? 

_Radanika._ Poor fool! Stop your joking. Don't you see it?  _Maitreya._ What do you mean, 

wench? "It looks as if a second door had been thrown open"? Get up, friend Charudatta, get up! A 

thief has made a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.  _Charudatta._ Yes, yes! A truce 

to your jests!  _Maitreya._ But it isn't a jest. Look!  _Charudatta._ Where?  _Maitreya._ Why, here. 

_Charudatta._ [_Gazing._] What a very remarkable hole!      The bricks are drawn away below, 

above;       The top is narrow, but the center wide;       As if the great house-heart had burst with 

pride,     Fearing lest the unworthy share its love.                    22  To think that sat down, not to 

rest, but to wield his pen as if it were a sword of steel. His _Commentaires_ were meant to be a 

manual for hardy combatants, and what model could he set before the young aspirant so 



animating as himself? In his earlier wars against the foreign foes of his country, Monluc was 

indeed a model of military prowess; the civil wars added cruelty to his courage; after a fashion he 

was religious, and a short shrift and a cord were good enough for heretics and adversaries of his 

King. An unlettered soldier, Monluc, by virtue of his energy of character and directness of speech, 

became a most impressive and spirited narrator. His Memoirs close with a sigh for stern and 

inviolable solitude. Among the Pyrenean rocks he had formerly observed a lonely monastery, in 

view at once of Spain and France; there it was his wish to end his days.  From the opposite party 

in the great religious and political strife came the temperate Memoirs of Lanoue, the simple and 

beautiful record of her husband's life by Madame de Mornay, and that of his own career, written in 

an old age of gloom and passion, by D'Aubigne. The ideas of Henri IV.--himself a royal author in 

his _Lettres missives_--are embodied in the _OEconomies Royales_ of the statesman Sully, 

whose secretaries were employed for the occasion in laboriously reciting his words and deeds as 

they had learnt them from their chief. The superficial aspects of the life of society, the manners 

and morals--or lack of morals--of the time, are lightly and brightly exhibited by PIERRE DE 

BOURDEILLE, lord of BRANTOME, Catholic abbe, soldier and courtier, observer of the great 

world, gossip of amorous secrets. His _Vies des Hommes Illustres et des Grands Capitaines_, his 

_Vies des Dames Illustres et des Dames Galantes_, and his _Memoires_ contained matter too 

dangerous, perhaps, for publication during his lifetime, but the author cherished the thought of his 

posthumous renown. Brantome, wholly indifferent to good and evil, had a vivid interest in life; 

virtue and vice concerned him alike and equally, if only they had vivacity, movement, colour; and 

although, as with Monluc, it was a physical calamity that made him turn to authorship, he wrote 

with a naive art, an easy grace, and abundant spirit. To correct and complete Brantome's narrative 

as it related to herself, Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, first wife of Henri IV., prepared her 

unfinished Memoirs, which opens the delightful series of autobiographies and reminiscences of 

women. Her account of the night of St. Bartholomew is justly celebrated; the whole record, indeed, 

is full of interest; but there were passages of her life which it was natural that she should pass over 

in silence; her sins of omission, as Bayle has observed, are many.[4]  [Footnote 4: The 

_Memoires-Journeaux_ of Pierre de l'Estoile are a great magazine of the gains of the writer's 

disinterested curiosity. The _Lettres_ of D'Ossat and the _Negotiations_ of the President Jeannin 

are of importance in the records of diplomacy.]  The controversies of the civil wars produced a 

militant literature, in which the extreme parties contended with passion, while between these a 

middle party, the aspirants to conciliation, pleaded for the ways of prudence, and, if possible, of 

peace. FRANCOIS HOTMAN, the effect of whose Latin _Franco-Gallia_, a political treatise 

presenting the Huguenot demands, has been compared to that of Rousseau's _Contrat Social_, 

launched his eloquent invective against the Cardinal de Lorraine, in the _Epistre envoyee au Tigre 

de la France_. Hubert Languet, the devoted friend of Philip Sidney, in his _Vindiciae contra 

Tyrannos_, justified rebellion against princes who violate by their commands the laws of God. 

D'Aubigne, in his _Confession de Sancy_, attacked with characteristic ardour the apostates and 

waverers of the time, above the rest that threefold recanter of his faith, Harlay de Sancy. Marnix

_Maitreya._ My friend, this hole must have been made by one of two men; either by a stranger, or 

else for practice by a student of the science of robbery. For what man here in Ujjayini does not 

know how much wealth there is in our house?  _Charud._      Stranger he must have been who 

made the breach,       His customed harvest in my house to reap;     He has not learned that 

vanished riches teach       A calm, untroubled sleep.      He saw the sometime greatness of my 

home       And forced an entrance; for his heart did leap     With short-lived hope; now he must 

elsewhere roam,       And over broken hopes must sorely weep.                    23  Just think of the 

poor fellow telling his friends: "I entered the house of a merchant's son, and found--nothing."  P. 

92.4]  _Maitreya._ Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks he--"Here's a 

great house. Here's the place to carry off a jewel-casket or a gold-casket." [_He remembers the in 

his _Tableau des Differands de la Religion_, mingles theological erudition with his raillery against 

the Roman communion. Henri Estienne applied the spirit and learning of a great humanist to 

religious controversy in the second part of his _Apologie pour Herodote_; the marvellous tales of 

the Greek historian may well be true, he sarcastically maintains, when in this sixteenth century the 

abuses of the Roman Church seem to pass all belief. On the other hand, Du Perron, a cardinal in 

1604, replied to the arguments and citations of the heretics. As the century drew towards its close, 

violence declined; the struggle was in a measure appeased. In earlier days the Chancellor, Michel 

de l'Hospital, had hoped to establish harmony between the rival parties; grief for the massacre of 

St. Bartholomew hastened his death. The learned Duplessis-Mornay, leader and guide of the 

Reformed Churches of France, a devoted servant of Henri of Navarre, while fervent in his

Where _is_ that golden casket? [_He remembers the events of the night. Aloud._] Look, man! You 

are always saying "Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya is no scholar." But I certainly acted wisely in 

handing over that golden casket to you. If I hadn't, the son of a slave would have carried it off. 

_Charudatta._ A truce to your jests!  _Maitreya._ Just because I'm a fool, do you suppose I don't 

even know the place and time for a jest?  _Charudatta._ But when did this happen?  _Maitreya._ 

Why, when I told you that your fingers were cold.  _Charudatta._ It might have been. [_He 

searches about. Joyfully._] My friend, I have something pleasant to tell you.  _Maitreya._ What? 

Wasn't it stolen?  _Charudatta._ Yes.  _Maitreya._ What is the pleasant news, then? 

_Charudatta._ The to the common faith of Christianity to be an extreme partisan. The 

reconciliation of Henri IV. with the Church of Rome, which delivered France from anarchy, was, 

however, a grief to some of his most loyal supporters, and of these Duplessis-Mornay was the 

most eminent.  The cause of Henri against the League was served by the manuscript circulation of 

a prose satire, with interspersed pieces of verse, the work of a group of writers, moderate 

Catholics or converted Protestants, who loved their country and their King, the _Satire 

Menipee_.[5] When it appeared in print (1594; dated on the title-page 1593) the cause was won; 

the satire rose upon a wave of success, like a gleaming crest of bitter spray. It is a parody of the 

Estates of the League which had been 


_
_Maitreya._ But it was only entrusted to our care.  _Charudatta._ What! entrusted to our care? 

[_He swoons._]  _Maitreya._ Come to yourself, man. Is the fact that a thief stole what was 

entrusted to you, any reason why you should swoon?  53.5. S.]  _Charudatta._ [_Coming to 

himself._] Ah, a king. Two Rabelaisian charlatans, one from Spain, one from Lorraine, offer their 

drugs for sale in the court of the Louvre; the virtues of the Spanish Catholicon, a divine electuary, 

are manifold--it will change the blackest criminal into a spotless lamb, it will transform a vulgar 

bonnet 


_
Who will believe the truth?       Suspicion now is sure.     This world will show no ruth       To the 

inglorious poor.                                    24  Alas!   If envious fate before         Has wooed my wealth 

alone.       Why should she seek my store         Of virtue as her own?                                    25 

_Maitreya._ I intend to deny the whole thing. Who gave anybody anything? who score of other 

miracles. Presently the buffoon Estates file past to their assembly; the hall in which they meet is 

tapestried with grotesque scenes from history; the order of the sitting is determined, and the 

harangues begin, harangues in which each speaker exposes his own ambitions, greeds, 

hypocrisies, and egoism, until Monsieur d'Aubray, the orator of the _tiers etat_, closes the debate 

with a speech in turn
