The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Leyton. Franks respectfully dear friends, and there was a misunderstanding, but--it's over now. It was natural he shouldn't want you to hear his last words to me."  "Nevertheless, it is forbidden," repeated the warder _
in the first specimen of her husband's handwriting. She pushed the candle nearer to him, and read 

over his shoulder, as she might have done at the distance of half the length of the room, the 

school-boy's big, blotted scrawl.  "Dear Mother, I hope your well. I am ill my head is so bad pleas 

get me home _quick_ QUICK your dutiful son B. S."  Mrs. Stone smiled, but her husband looked 

grave. Strange old recollections, and those by no means of a pleasing nature, were brought back 

to his mind by the sight of that--till now--forgotten letter to his mother. Ben put up his hand to his 

forehead, and pushed up the nightcap from his temples.  "Yes, yes," he muttered to himself, "I 

remember writing that letter as if it were but yesterday; I remember the very button which I used to 

press down the wafer. I was very wretched on first going to school,--the boys bullied me, and I 

could not bear regular work; so to get my poor mother to take me home, I wrote that letter with a 

big falsehood in it. It was the first,--the only note as ever I sent her, and something else I can do 

for him, perhaps--I, and only I. A thing of value was stolen from him, it seems, a thing he was 

anxious to get back at any price--even the price of looking for it on a dead man's body. Well, I 

think I know what that thing was--I think I have it."  "What do you mean?" I asked, astonished at 

her and at her manner--and her words.  "I'm not going to tell you what I mean. Only I'm sure of 

what I'm saying--at least, that the thing _is_ valuable, worth risking a great deal for. I learned that 

from experts this morning, while you and your aunt were thinking about hats."  For an instant I was 

completely bewildered. Then, suddenly, a strange idea sprang into my mind:  "That brocade bag 

you picked up in the Rue d'Hollande last night!"  It was the first time I had thought of it from that 

moment to this--there had been so many other things which seemed more important.  Lisa looked 

annoyed. I think she had counted on my not remembering, or not connecting her hints with the 

thing she had found in the street, and that she had 


_
"There's nothing to take to heart in such an old matter as that," observed Mrs. Stone, struck by the 

unusual gravity of her husband, who generally turned everything into a jest. "Nobody thinks of 

raking up what they've done wrong forty or fifty years back."  "Tut, I should not care a toss of a 

straw about it," replied Stone, "had I told the falsehood to any one but my mother, and that just a 

few days before I lost her. I'd never an opportunity of telling her that I'd deceived her, or of asking 

her to forgive me, for I did not go home till she lay in her coffin. To think of that vile bit of paper 

turning up against me now!" Ben doubled the note, and, tearing it into pieces, threw the fragments 

on the floor.  It may be a matter of surprise that a sin of childhood should have in the slightest 

degree ruffled the easy conscience of such a man as Ben Stone. He had thought very little indeed 

of sinning against God, but his natural affections made him feel pain at having sinned against a 

sick mother. Perhaps the words of Franks had not been so utterly unheeded as they had seemed 

at first to be, and had served to rouse a suspicion, confirmed by the school-boy's letter, that there 

might be many a forgotten fault of the highly respectable man that would "turn up against him" 

some day; faults for which forgiveness had never been  "I won't say whether I mean the brocade 

bag or not, and whether, if I do, that I believe Ivor dropped it, or whether there was another man 

mixed up in the case--perhaps the real murderer. If I _do_ decide to tell what I know and what I 

suspect, it won't be to you--unless for a very particular reason--and it won't be yet awhile."  I'm 

afraid that I almost hated her for a moment, she seemed so cold, so calculating and sly. I couldn't 

bear to think that she was my step-sister, and I was glad that, at least, not a drop of the same 

blood ran in our veins.  "If you choose to keep silent for some purpose of your own," I broke out, 

"you can't prevent me from telling the whole story, as _I_ know it--how I went out with you, and all 

that."  "I can't prevent you from doing it, but I can advise you not to--for Ivor's sake," she 

answered.  "For his sake?"  "Yes, and for your own, too, if you care for his opinion of you at all. 

For his sake, because _neither_ of us knows when he came out of Maxine de Renzie's house. 

You _would_ go away, though I wanted to stay and watch. He may not have been there more than 

five minutes for all we can tell to the contrary, in which case he would still have had time to go 

straight off to the Rue de la Fille Sauvage and kill that man, in accordance with the doctors' 

statements about the death. For _your_ 


_
he was tired and sleepy, and bade his wife shut up the box and take it away. The evening was 

getting on; it was time for him to take his night-draught, and go quietly to rest.  Though the night-

draught was taken and the pillows carefully beaten up and sleep soon closed the invalid's eyes, it 

was not quiet rest. A confused medley of thoughts shaped themselves into dreams, which took 

their color from what had occurred during the day. Ben Stone in his sleep was still looking over 

and examining things of the past; his whole room appeared to be filled up with boxes, one piled on 

another, and there seemed to be a necessity for him to open and put them all into order. This was 

in itself an oppressive feeling to the dreamer; but the oppression became much greater when he 

found that each box was filled to overflowing with bills,--old, forgotten bills,--and that not one of 

them was receipted; not one had ever been paid. Stone had a dim idea that all these debts were 

connected with unforgiven sin, from that falsehood contained in his first letter to the last "idle word" 

which had fallen from his lips. As box after box was emptied, and every unpaid bill thrown down in 

despair, the white paper seemed to turn into foam, a sea was rising around him, and it appeared 

to Stone as if his numberless debts would drown him at last. Ned Franks was by the side of the 

dreamer, helping him to look over his boxes, and saying, every now and then, in an earnest, 

anxious tone, "Ben Stone, if you don't pay, you are a ruined man!--if you don't pay, you are ruined 

forever!" So strong was the impression left on the dreamer's mind, that he awoke with the words 

on his lips, "If you don't pay, you are ruined forever!"  Very still was the room when Stone opened 

his eyes with a start, relieved to find that he had, after all, been but dreaming. One feeble night-

light was making "darkness visible" in the chamber, where no other object could distinctly be seen. 

Even so faint a light had Stone's conscience hitherto thrown upon spiritual things, as different from 

the clear radiance of Truth as the night-light from the sun. The sinner had not known his sinfulness 

because his light had been too dim to enable him to see it.  As Ben Stone lay silent and still on his 

pillow, the breeze bore to him, more distinctly than he ever before had heard it in his cottage, the 

sound of the church clock striking ONE. For once Stone felt something solemn in sake, because if 

he knows that you tracked him to Maxine de Renzie's house, he won't respect you very much; and 

because he would probably be furious with you, unable to forgive you as long as he lived, for 

injuring the reputation of the woman he's risked so much to save. He'd believe you did it out of 

spiteful jealousy against her."  I grew cold all over, and trembled so that I could hardly speak.  "Ivor 

would know that I'm incapable of such baseness."  "I'm not sure he'd hold you above it. 'Hell hath 

no fury like a woman scorned'--and he _has_ scorned you--for an actress."  It was as if she had 

struck me in the face: and I could feel the blood rush up to my cheeks. They burned so hotly that 

the tears were forced to my eyes.  "You see I'm right, don't you?" Lisa asked.  "You may be right in 

thinking I could do him no good in that way--and that he wouldn't wish it, even if I could. But not 

about the rest," I said. "We won't talk of it any more. I can't stand it. Please go back to your room 

now, Lisa, I want to be alone."  "Very well," she snapped, "_you_ called me in. I didn't ask to 

come."  Then she went out, with not another word or look, and slammed the door. I could imagine 

myself compelling her to give up the brocade bag, or offering her some great bribe of money, 

thousands of pounds, if necessary. Lisa is a strange little creature. She will do a good deal for 

money.     CHAPTER XVI   DIANA UNDERTAKES A STRANGE ERRAND  If I had not been 

tingling with anger against Lisa, who had seemed to enjoy saying needlessly cruel things to me, 

perhaps I would have been utterly discouraged when she pricked the bubble of my hope. She had 



made me realise that the plan I had was useless, perhaps worse than useless; but in my 

desperate mood I caught at another. I would try to see Ivor, and find out some other way of 

helping him. At all events he should know that I was for him, not against him, in this time of 

trouble.  Perhaps this new idea was a mad one, I told myself. Perhaps I should not be allowed to 

see him, even in the presence of others. But while there was a "perhaps" I wouldn't give up. 

Without waiting for a cooler or more cowardly mood to set in, I almost ran out of my room, and 

downstairs, for I hadn't taken off my hat and coat since coming in.  I had no knowledge of French 

law, or police etiquette, or anything of that sort. But I knew the French as a gallant nation; and I 

thought that if a girl should 


_
to him, that his remaining hours might be few, and that he _was not prepared_ for eternity.  Then 

Stone thought of Ned Franks. The sailor was not afraid of death, but his reason for not fearing it 

was something utterly different from the easy reliance on his own goodness which the carpenter 

knew to have been his own. Ned Franks had shrunk from the idea of his safety depending on his 

merits. On what then _did_ it depend? The invalid, with a dawning perception that he himself 

might not be quite as secure as he had lately thought himself to be, felt desirous to know more 

clearly what was Franks's hope of salvation; and when, in the morning, Mrs. Stone was preparing 

her husband's breakfast, he asked her to stop the sailor when next he should pass their door, and 

ask him to step in and see him.     XXII.  Peace from Above.   "You went off in such haste 

yesterday that we'd not time to have out half our say," said Ben Stone to Ned Franks, as, called in 

by the carpenter's wife, he walked up to the patient's bedside.  Franks smiled, agreeably surprised 

to find that Stone wished to renew such a conversation.  "Take a chair, my good friend, and sit 

down. Bell, you needn't stop in for me. I know Franks won't grudge me a half-hour for once, even 

on a week day."  Mrs. Stone soon quitted the cottage, but not till she had warned her visitor with 

raised finger and shake of the head, "Don't you bother my husband about anything to make his 

mind uneasy."  When she had closed the door behind her, Ben Stone turned to Franks, and said, 

"I was looking over old papers, yesterday, which reminded me of my boyhood, and I suppose it's 

that which has brought back to me a bit of rhyme which I learned from my mother, and which has 

been running in my brain all this day, though it had gone clean out of my memory for years,-- 

"'There's not a sin that I commit,       Or wicked word I say,     But in Thy dreadful book 'tis writ 

Against the judgment-day.'  "Now, do you suppose," said Stone, with an effort to speak in his 

usual careless tone, "that God keeps an account like that, as a creditor with his debtors, and that 

when folks die there are all the old bills, as it were, brought up, even debts that they'd clean 

forgotten?"  "Yes, assuredly, _unless all those debts have been paid_."  "That's the very nail that I 

want you to hit," cried the carpenter. "How are we to make sure that the debts _are_ all paid,--I 

mean, that God has forgiven us outright? Are you sure that _your_ debts are all paid?"  "Yes, 

thank God!" cried the sailor; "my debts were paid, every one of them, when my Saviour died on 

Calvary. Does not St. Paul say that Christ blotted out _the handwriting of ordinances that was 

against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross_?"  "Were 

every one's sins blotted out then?" asked Stone.  "The sins of all who have living _faith_ in the 

Lord."  "Ah! _faith_; that's what you're always talking about, and I can never quite make out what it 

means."  "It simply means that we believe from the heart that the Son of God _died for us_," said 

Ned Franks.  "Is that all?" exclaimed Stone, in surprise. "Why, a poor wretch like Nancy Sands 

might believe that as well as yourself!"  "And if poor Nancy does believe that _from the heart_, her 

sins, be they few or many, _are_ forgiven her for the sake of Him who bore the punishment for 

them all."  "That's a dangerous doctrine, a very dangerous doctrine," said the carpenter, shaking 

his head; "you wouldn't put Nancy, I hope, on the same footing as yourself or as me?"  "The ark of 

Salvation is as open to Nancy as to us," replied Franks; "and if any of us reach God's heaven, it 

can only be in that ark."  "I don't understand what you mean," said Ben Stone. "Would you put bad 

and good all together?"  "Perhaps I can explain myself best by referring to Noah's ark," replied 

Franks. "God made known that a deluge was coming on the earth, and that the only way of 

escaping it was by going into an ark which Noah was commanded to prepare. It is clear that those 



who were _saved_ were those who _believed_. It was _faith_ in God's word that made Noah and 

his family enter the ark; they were saved because they were _in it_, and not, as I tried to explain 

yesterday, because of their merits as sailors or swimmers. It is clear, also, that they could not be 

_half_ saved by the ark, and _half_ by their own boats or rafts. So, if we trust our souls to Christ, 

we must do so _entirely_; we must give up all notion of saving ourselves, and own that our hopes 

of forgiveness and heaven rest on _nothing but his mercy and merits_. We own ourselves, with an 

accused man, as his friend, an interview--probably with a witness--might possibly be granted. The 

authorities might think that we were engaged, for all I cared. I did not care about anything now, 

except seeing Ivor, and helping him if I could.  I hardly knew what I meant to do at the beginning, 

by way of getting the chance I wanted, until I had asked to have a motor-cab called for me. Then, I 

suddenly thought of the British Ambassador, a great friend of Uncle Eric's and Aunt Lilian's. Uncle 

Eric had already been to him, but I fancied not with a view of trying to see Ivor. That idea had 

apparently not been in his mind at all. Anyway, the Ambassador would already understand that the 

family took a deep interest in the fate of Ivor Dundas, and would not be wholly astonished at 

receiving a call from me. Besides, hearing of some rather venturesome escapades of mine when I 

first arrived in London, he had once, while visiting Uncle Eric, laughed a good deal and said that in 

future he would be "surprised at nothing an American girl might do."  I told the driver to go to the 

British Embassy as fast as he could. There, I sent in my name, and the Ambassador received me 

at once. I didn't explain much, but came to the point immediately, and said that I wanted--oh, but 

wanted and needed very much indeed--to see Ivor Dundas. Could he, would he help me to do 

that?  "Ought I to help you?" he asked. "Would Mountstuart and Lady Mountstuart approve?" 

"Yes," I said firmly. "They would approve. You see, it is necessary."  "Then, if it's necessary--and I 

believe you when you say that it is," he answered, "I'll do what I can."  What he could do and did 

do, was to write a personal letter to the Chief of Police in Paris, asking as a favour that his friend, 

Miss Forrest, a young lady related through marriage to the British Foreign Secretary, should be 

allowed five minutes' conversation with the Englishman accused of murder, Mr. Ivor Dundas.  I 

took the letter to the Chief of Police myself, to save time, and because I was so restless and 

excited that I must be doing something every instant--something which I felt might bring me nearer 

to Ivor.  From the Chief of Police, who proved to be a most courteous person, I received an order 

to give to the governor of the gaol or prison where they had put Ivor. This, he explained, would 

procure me the interview I wanted, but unfortunately, I must not hope to see my friend alone. A 

warder who understood English would have to be present.  So far I had gone into the wild venture 

without once thinking what it would be to find myself suddenly face to face with Ivor in such terrible 

circumstances, or what he would think of me for coming in such a way now that we were no longer 

anything to each other--not even friends. But a kind of ague-terror crept over me while I sat waiting 

in an ugly little bare, stuffy reception room. My head was going round and round, my heart was 

pounding so that I could not make up my mind what to say to Ivor when he came.  Then, suddenly, 

I heard the sound of footsteps outside the door; and when it opened, there stood Ivor, between 

two Frenchmen in blue uniforms. One of them walked into the room with him--I suppose he must 

have been a warder--but he stopped near the door, and in a second I had forgotten all about him. 

He simply ceased to exist for me, when my eyes and Ivor's had met.  I sprang up from my chair 

and began to talk as quickly as I could, stammering and confused, hardly knowing what I said, but 



anxious to make him understand in the beginning that I had not come to take back my words of 

yesterday.  "We're all so dreadfully sorry, Mr. Dundas," I said. "I don't know if Uncle Eric has been 

here yet--but he is doing all he can, and Aunt Lilian is dreadfully upset. We're staying on in Paris 

on account of--on account of this. So you see you've got friends near you. And I--we're such old 

friends, I couldn't help trying as hard as I could for a sight of you to--to cheer you up, and--and to 

help you, if that's possible."  I spoke very fast, not daring to look at him after the first, but 

pretending to smooth out some wrinkles in one of my long gloves. My eyes were full of tears, and I 

was afraid they'd go splashing down my cheeks, if I even winked my lashes. I loved him more than 

ever now, and felt capable of forgiving him anything, if only I had the chance to forgive, and if only, 

_only_ he really loved me and not that other.  "Thank you, a hundred times--more than I can 

express," he said, with a faint quiver in his voice--his beautiful voice, which was the first thing that 

charmed me after knowing him. "It _does_ cheer me to see 


_
firm stand on the Gospel doctrine that _Christ died for sinners_,--for that is our ark."  "I'm afraid 

that people who make sure of being saved by faith will lead very careless lives," said the 

carpenter, who could not get over his repugnance to being classed with Nancy Sands.  "They can 

only be saved by living, true faith," replied Franks. "Merely to say that we believe is nothing; nay, a 

cold conviction that the Bible is true, is nothing,--_the devils also believe and tremble_."  "How are 

you to know true faith from false faith?" asked Ben, with rather a sarcastic smile, as if he thought 

he had driven Ned Franks into a corner.  "How do you know a real fire from a painted one?" asked 

Ned.  "Well, it does not need much wit to tell the one from the other, if the painting were ever so 

clear," replied Stone; "the real fire warms us, of course; it aint a thing only to be looked at."  "And 

so real faith warms the heart, fills it with a glow of grateful love towards Him who gave himself for 

us. And that love makes us loathe and detest sin, because it is displeasing to our Lord,--the one 

thing which he hates. True faith and sin are just as much opposed to each other as fire and water. 

You said just now that you were afraid that people would live very careless lives if they hoped to 

be saved by faith. Do you find it to be so in your experience of men, Ben Stone? Those who are 

the most active in good works, the most steady in conduct, the best husbands, parents, neighbors, 

are they not the very people who have no hope of heaven but in the great Sacrifice for sin?"  "I 

can't deny that," answered Ben Stone, who knew that Ned Franks himself had a standard of duty 

that made his own appear but a low one. "But I can't see how that should be."  "Because every 

man _that hath that hope_ in Christ, _purifieth himself even as he is It gives me strength and 

courage. You wouldn't have come if you didn't--trust me, and believe me innocent."  "Why, of 

course, I--we--believe you innocent of any crime," I faltered.  "And of any lack of faith?"  "Oh, as 

for that, how can--but don't let's speak of that. What can it matter now?"  "It matters more than 

anything else in the world. If only you could say that you will have faith!"  "I'll try to say it then, if it 

can give you any comfort."  "Not unless you mean it."  "Then--I'll try to mean it. Will that satisfy 

you?"  "It's better than nothing. And I thank you again. As for the rest, you're not to be anxious. 

Everything will come right for me sooner or later, though I may have to suffer some annoyances 

first."  "Annoyances?" I echoed. "If there were nothing worse!"  "There won't be. I shall be well 

defended. It will all be shown up as a huge mistake--another warning against trusting to 

circumstantial evidence."  "Is there nothing we can do then? Or--that we would urge _others_ to 

do?" I asked, hoping he would understand that I meant _one_ other--Maxine de Renzie.  I 

guessed by his look that he did understand. It was a look of gloom; but suddenly a light flashed in 

his eyes.  "There is one thing _you_ could do for me--you and no one else," he said. "But I have 

no right to ask it."  "Tell me what it is," I implored.  "I would not, if it didn't mean more than my life 

to me." He hesitated, and then, while I wondered what was to come, he bent forward and spoke a 

few hurried words in Spanish. He knew that to me Spanish was almost as familiar as English. He 

had heard me talk of the Spanish customs still existing in the part of California where I was born. 

He had heard me sing Spanish songs. We had sung them together--one or two I had taught him. 

But I had not taught him the language. He learned that, and three or 


_
Spirit, and it must be followed by two others,--the love of Christ and that _holiness without which 

no man shall see the Lord_.[K] As a good man once said, 'We come to Christ just as we are, but 

not to remain as we have been.' When we are once in the ark, Stone, it will lift us above the waters 

of wilful sin, as well as the diplomatic career.  They were so few words, and so quickly spoken, 

that I--remembering the warder--almost hoped they might pass unnoticed. But the man in uniform 

came nearer to us at once, looking angry and suspicious.  "That is forbidden," he said to Ivor. 

Then, turning sharply to me. "What language was that?"  "Spanish," I
