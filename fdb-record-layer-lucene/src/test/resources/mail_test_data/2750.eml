 the career of merit, and I can promote any able man that I _
perspire freely in the hot-air bath, and the pores of the skin being thus o=
pened and moist, the=20

volatile oil from the smoke of the burning perfumes is immediately absorbed=
.  By the time that the=20

fire has expired, the scenting process is completed, and both her person an=
d robe are redolent of=20

incense, with which they are so thoroughly impregnated that I have frequent=
ly smelt a party of=20

women strongly at full a hundred yards' distance, when the wind has been bl=
owing from their=20

direction. Of course this kind of perfumery is only adapted for those who l=
ive in tents and in the=20

open air, but first congratulate you on being alive, which I hardly hoped,=
=E2=80=9D said the general. =E2=80=9CThen=20

let me know why you are here.=E2=80=9D  And Lothair told him.  =E2=80=9CWel=
l, you shall have back your horses,=E2=80=9D=20

said the general; =E2=80=9Cand I will escort you to El Khuds. In the mean t=
ime you must be our guest;=E2=80=9D and=20

he presented him to the Pacha of Damascus with some form. =E2=80=9CYou and =
I have bivouacked in the=20

open air before this, and not in so bland a clime.=E2=80=9D  Beneath the sh=
ade of the patriarchal sycamore,=20

the general narrated to Lothair his adventures since they were fellow-comba=
tants on the fatal field=20

of Mentana.  =E2=80=9CWhen=20


_
by the ladies to have a peculiar attraction for the other sex, as valerian =
is said to ensnare the=20

genus felis. As the men are said to be allured by this particular combinati=
on of sweet smells, and=20

to fall victims to the delicacy of their nasal organs, it will be necessary=
 to give the receipt for the=20

fatal mixture, to be made up in proportions according to taste :--Ginger, c=
loves, cinnamon,=20

frankincense, sandal-wood, myrrh, a species of sea-weed that is brought fro=
m the Red Sea, and=20

lastly, what I mistook for shells, but which I subsequently discovered to b=
e the horny disc that=20

closes the aperture when a shell-fish withdraws itself within its shell; th=
ese are also brought from=20

the Red Sea, in which they abound throughout the shores of Nubia and Abyssi=
nia. In addition to=20

the charm of sweet perfumes, the women who can afford the luxury, suspend f=
rom their necks a=20

few pieces of the dried glands of the musk cat, which is a native of the co=
untry; such an addition=20

completes the toilet, gained the Italian frontier at Terrni. Here we were o=
f course arrested by the=20

authorities, but not very maliciously. I escaped one morning, and got among=
 the mountains in the=20

neighborhood of our old camp. I had to wander about these parts for some ti=
me, for the Papalini=20

were in the vicinity, and there was danger. It was a hard time; but I found=
 a friend now and then=20

among the country people, though they are dreadfully superstitious. At last=
 I got to the shore, and=20

induced an honest fellow to put to sea in an open boat, on the chance of so=
mething turning up. It=20

did, in the shape of a brigantine from Elba bound for Corfu. Here I was sur=
e to find friends, for the=20

brotherhood are strong in the Ionian Isles. And I began to look about for b=
usiness. The Greeks=20

made me some offers, but their schemes were all vanity, worse than the Iris=
h. You remember our=20

Fenian squabble? From something that transpired, I had made up my mind, so =
soon as I was well=20

equipped, to go to Turkey. I had had some=20


_
carefully arranged.  Hair-dressing in all parts of the world, both civilize=
d and savage, is a branch of=20

science; savage negro tribes are distinguished by the various arrangements =
of their woolly heads.=20

Arabs are marked by similar peculiarities, that have never changed for thou=
sands of years, and=20

may be yet seen depicted upon the walls of Egyptian temples in the precise =
forms as worn at=20

present, while in modern times the perfection of art has been in the wig of=
 a Lord Chancellor.=20

Although this latter example of the result of science is not the actual hai=
r of the wearer, it adds an=20

imposing glow of wisdom to the general appearance, and may have originated =
as a necessity=20

where a deficiency of sagacity had existed, and where the absence of years =
required the fictitious=20

crown of grey old age. A barrister in his wig, and the same amount of learn=
ing without the our dear=20

friend whom we will never forget, but will never mention; and through them =
I became acquainted=20

with the Prince of Samos, who is the chief of their house. He is in the ent=
ire confidence of Aali=20

Pacha. I soon found out that there was real business on the carpet. The Ott=
oman army, after many=20

trials and vicissitudes, is now in good case; and the Porte has resolved to=
 stand no more=20

nonsense either in this direction=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D and the general gave a =
significant glance=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cor in any other.=20

But they wanted a general; they wanted a man who knew his business. I am no=
t a Garibaldi, you=20

know, and never pretended to be. I have no genius, or volcanic fire, or tha=
t sort of thing; but I do=20

presume to say, with fair troops, paid with tolerable regularity, a battery=
 or two of rifled cannon,=20

and a well-organized commissariat, I am not afraid of meeting any captain o=
f my=20
