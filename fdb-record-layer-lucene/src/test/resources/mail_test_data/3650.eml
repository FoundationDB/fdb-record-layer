ans were re-inforced and=20

executed strange and       marvellous slaughter among the Indians, killing =
numberless people=20

and burning many alive including great lords. (91) 19.19. After the greates=
t and abominable=20

tyranny practised by these men in       the City of Mexico, and in the town=
s throughout the country=20

for ten,       fifteen and twenty leagues in those parts, during which numb=
erless       people were=20

killed, this, their tyrannical pestilence passed       onwards, spreading i=
nto, infecting and ruining the=20

province of       Panuco, where there was a marvellous multitude of people:=
 equally       marvellous=20

were the massacres and slaughter that they performed       there. 20.20. Af=
terwards they=20

destroyed the province of Tututepeche in the same       way; then the provi=
nce of Spilcingo; then=20

that of Colima; each of       which is larger than the kingdoms of Leon and=
 of Castile.  To=20

describe the massacres, slaughter, and cruelty which they practised       i=
n each, would doubtless=20

be a most difficult thing, impossible to       confirm and disagreeable to =
listen to. 21.21. Here it=20

must be noted, that the pretext with which they invaded and       began to =
destroy all those=20

innocent beings and to depopulate those       lands which, on account of th=
eir numberless=20

populations should have       caused such joy and contentment to true Chris=
tians, was, that they=20

came to subject them to the King of Spain; otherwise, they must kill       =
them and make slaves of=20

them.  And those, who did not promptly yield       obedience to such an unr=
easonable and stupid=20

commission, and refused       to place themselves in the hands of such iniq=
uitous, cruel and=20

brutal men, they declared were rebels, who had risen against the       serv=
ice of His Majesty; and=20

thus they wrote from here to our lord       the King. 22.22. And the blindn=
ess of those who govern=20

the Indians, did not       understand nor attend to what is expressed in th=
eir laws, and is       clearer=20

than any of their first principles whatsoever, namely; that       no one ca=
n be called rebel, if he be=20

not first a subject. 23.23. Let Christians and those that have some knowled=
ge of God, and of=20

reason, and also of human laws, consider to what state can be       reduced=
 the hearts of=20

whatsoever people who live in security in       their own country ignorant =
of having obligations=20

towards any one,       and who have their own rightful rulers, upon being t=
hus unexpectedly=20

ordered to yield obedience to a foreign King whom they have never       see=
n, nor heard of,=20

otherwise be it known to you, that we must at       once cut you to pieces;=
 especially when they=20

actually see the threat       put into execution. 24.24. More dreadful is i=
t that those who obey=20

voluntarily, are put into       onerous servitude; in which, under incredib=
le labour and tortures=20

that last longer than those of death by the sword, they and their       wiv=
es and children and all their=20

race perish. 25.25. And although these people, or any other in the world ar=
e moved by       fear or=20

the said threats to yield obedience and to recognise the       dominion of =
a foreign King, our blinded=20

people, unbalanced by       ambitious and diabolical avarice, do not percei=
ve that they thereby=20

acquire not a single atom of right, these fears being truly such as       d=
iscourage the firmest men.=20

26.26. To say that natural, human and divine right permits their acts      =
 because the intention=20

justifies them is all wind: but their crime       condemns them to infernal=
 fire, as do also the offences=20

and injuries       done to the Kings of Castile, by destroying these their =
kingdoms and=20

annihilating (as far as they possibly can) their rights over all the       =
Indies.  These, and none=20

other, are the services the Spaniards have       rendered, and do render to=
-day to the said=20

sovereign kings in these       countries. 27.27. By this just and approved =
title, did this tyrant captain=20



send two       other tyrant captains, much more cruel and ferocious and mor=
e       destitute of=20

compassion and mercy than himself, to "regulator" clock, with the twenty-fo=
ur-hour dial and other=20

additions appertaining to the astronomical clock. The illustration shows th=
e time to be: Greenwich,=20

11.42 (i.e. 42 minutes past 11 o'clock); Bristol, 11.32 (i.e. 10 minutes di=
fference). The clock has a=20

mercury pendulum. There was a somewhat similar clock constructed by Dell, o=
f Bristol.=20

ION OF THE=20

LONG-CASE CLOCK       Its inception--Its Dutch origin--The changing forms o=
f the      hood, the=20

waist, and the base--The dial and its character--The      ornamentation of =
the spandrel--The=20

evolution of the hands.   From 1680 to 1850 is a long period of time for a =
particular style of=20

timepiece to run without interruption or without displacement by any other =
fashion. It may naturally=20

be supposed that during this period changes have occurred in form, in decor=
ation, and in a score=20

of minor details delightful to the collector and interesting to the student=
 of form in design. The=20

inception of the long case was due to the common use of the seconds pendulu=
m. This required a=20

certain space to swing in, and the pendulum was of a certain length. This u=
ndue length does not=20

seem to have been necessary in the wall clock of the so-called "Act of Parl=
iament" type, and as=20

Lord Grimthorpe, the constructor of "Big Ben" at Westminster, says: "Spring=
 clocks are generally=20

resorted to for the purpose of saving length; for as clocks are generally m=
ade in England, it is=20

impossible to make a weight clock capable of going a week, without either a=
 case nearly 4 feet=20

high, or else the weights so heavy as to produce a great friction on the ar=
bour of the great wheel.=20

But this arises from nothing but the heaviness of the wheels and the badnes=
s of the pinions used=20

in most English clocks, as is amply proved by the fact that the American an=
d Austrian clocks go a=20

week with smaller weights and much less fall than English ones, and the Ame=
rican ones with no=20

assistance from fine workmanship for the purpose of diminishing friction, a=
s they are remarkable=20

for their want of what is called 'finish' in the machinery, on which so muc=
h time and money is=20

wasted in English clock-work."  =3DIts Dutch Origin.=3D--As we have before =
explained, the marquetry=20

case came straight from Holland. Our "grandfather" was a Dutchman, as far a=
s clock-cases go.=20

The Dutchman Huygens is credited with having been the first to employ the p=
endulum in the=20

mechanism of the clock. Leonardo da Vinci, that stupendous genius, left not=
es as to his study of=20

the pendulum (1452-1520), and Galileo came with his later studies (1564-164=
2). It is a disputed=20

point as to when and where the pendulum came into being. We must accept Huy=
gens (1629-95)=20

as the practical exponent of the pendulum, although not the original discov=
erer of its properties.=20

But at any rate, the long-case clock may be generally accepted as coinciden=
t with the use of the=20

long or seconds pendulum. And to Holland we must look for this habitual usa=
ge of the long=20

wooden case to protect the weights and the pendulum.  Among the designs of =
Marot there are=20

drawings of long-case clocks certainly more ornate than those usually assoc=
iated with such an=20

early period (this was about 1660 to 1680), and French Louis XIV and Louis =
XV tall clocks are built=20

on these lines, and Chippendale at a later period found Marot an exceedingl=
y prolific master of=20

design to study.  =3DThe Changing Forms of the Hood, the Waist, and the Bas=
e.=3D--The evolution of=20



form in one class of object from one period to another is of exceptional in=
terest. In furniture, in=20

china, in glass, and in silver, the progression of forms is so marked as to=
 give practically a date to=20

each piece. The gate-leg table can be traced from three to twelve legs with=
 double gates. The=20

chair, from its straight oaken back and massive arms to the tapering legs a=
nd curves of the=20

satinwood period, runs through stages as definitely marked=20


_
flourishing, most happy and densely populated kingdoms, namely to       tha=
t of Guatemala, on the=20

South Sea; and to that of Naco and       Honduras or Guaymura, on the North=
 Sea.  They lie=20

opposite one       another, bordering, but separate, and each three hundred=
 leagues       distant=20

from Mexico.  He sent one expedition by land and the other       with ships=
 by sea, each provided=20

with many horsemen and       foot-soldiers. 28.28. I state the truth: Out o=
f the evil done by both,=20

and especially by       him who went to the kingdom of Guatemala,--because =
the other soon=20

died a bad death--I could collect and recount so much wickedness, so       =
many massacres, so=20

many deaths, so much extermination, so much and       such frightful injust=
ice, that they would=20

strike terror to present       and future ages: and I could fill a big book=
 with them, for this man=20

surpassed all the past and the present in the kind and multitude of       a=
bominations he=20

committed; in the people he destroyed and in the       countries he devasta=
ted, for they were=20

infinite. 29.29. The one who commanded the expedition by sea, committed gre=
at       robberies and=20

scandal; destroying many people in the towns along the       coast.  Some n=
atives came out to=20

receive him with presents in the       kingdom of Yucatan, which is on the =
road to the above=20

mentioned       kingdom of Naco and Guaymura, where he was going; when he a=
rrived       there,=20

he sent captains and many people throughout that country, who       robbed,=
 killed and destroyed=20

everything and everybody they found. 30.30. One especially of these captain=
s who had mutinied=20

with three       hundred men, and had entered the country towards Guatemala=
, advanced=20

destroying and burning every place he found, robbing and killing the       =
people; he did this=20

diligently for more than a hundred and twenty       leagues, so that if oth=
ers were sent in pursuit of=20

him, they would       find the country depopulated and in rebellion, and wo=
uld be killed       by the=20

Indians in revenge for the damage and destruction he had       done.  31.31=
. A few days later they=20

[the Spaniards] killed the principal captain       who had sent him and aga=
inst whom he had=20

mutinied.  Afterwards there       succeeded other most cruel tyrants who, w=
ith slaughter and=20

dreadful       cruelty, and with the capture of slaves and the selling them=
 to the       ships that=20

brought their wine, clothing and other things, and with       the usual tyr=
annical had signed the=20

pieces. Now the stretcher is low, next it becomes higher, then it disappear=
s altogether; or the=20

splats in the back are single, then double, with cane panels, and then agai=
n upholstered. The top=20

rail of the chair affords similar delectation to the connoisseur of form ch=
anging for a definite=20

reason.  The clock-case underwent equal changes in character, not only in i=
ts decoration, as we=20

have seen, in marquetry, in lacquer, and in veneers of burr-walnut and maho=
gany, but its=20

proportions varied. At first, coming as it did in the walnut period, the ho=
od had turned rails, in=20

keeping with the turned rails of the chairs of the time. The hood was squar=
e and small, the waist=20

was more slender, and the base in proportion. During the marquetry and the =
lacquered periods the=20

hood began to grow larger and more dominant. It had a domed superstructure,=
 and the finials or=20

metal terminals were more ornamental and grew in number (see illustrations,=
 pp. 133, 117). The=20

massive character of the early mahogany period, culminating with Chippendal=
e, had its effect on=20

the long clock-case. The hood had a pagoda-like edifice in the Chinese styl=
e (see illustration, p.=20

239), or it had the woodcarver's adoption of architecture, as in the crest =
of the hood (see=20

illustrations, pp. 145, 117). The rail in the hood had become a Corinthian =
pillar, and later a pilaster.=20

At the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century it had=
 a new form: when it=20

was turned mahogany it stood away from the case, as an ornament apart, rath=
er than a supporting=20



pillar (see illustration, p. 233). This is a noticeable feature in country-=
made clocks of this period.  At=20

first there was no door in the case. But on the introduction of the door, i=
ts panelled form=20

commenced to make its progression in form in accompaniment with the other f=
eatures of the case.=20

It was square, in simple forms, with square hoods. In 1730 it took the form=
 somewhat similar to the=20

shape of the lowest marquetry panel, as shown in the clock by Jas. Leiceste=
r (see Frontispiece). It=20

really follows the chair-backs of a period of some ten or fifteen years' pr=
ior date. It is an instance of=20

the clock-case slightly lagging behind contemporary furniture design. The s=
hapes of these panels=20

resemble the chair-backs of the James II, William and Mary, and the Queen A=
nne period. In some=20

instances the simple form becomes taller, terminating in a small semicircle=
. The Sussex iron fire-

backs of the seventeenth century show similar=20


_
those provinces and that kingdom of Naco and Honduras, which truly       se=
emed a paradise of=20

delight, and was better peopled than the most       populous land in the wo=
rld.  We have now gone=20

through these       countries on foot and have beheld such desolation and d=
estruction as       would=20

wring the vitals of the hardest-hearted of men.        In these eleven year=
s they have killed more=20

than two million souls,       and in more than a hundred leagues square, th=
ey have not left two=20

thousand persons, whom they are now daily exterminating by the said       s=
ervitude.  32.32. Let us=20

again speak of the great tyrant captain, (92) who went to       the kingdom=
 of Guatemala, who, as=20

has been said, surpassed all past       and equalled all present tyrants.  =
The provinces surrounding=20

Mexico       are, by the route he took (according to what he himself writes=
 in a       letter to his chief=20

who sent him), four hundred leagues distant from       the kingdom of Guate=
mala: he advanced=20

killing, ravaging, burning,       robbing and destroying all the country wh=
erever he came, under the=20

above mentioned pretext, namely, that the Indians should subject       them=
selves to such=20

inhuman, unjust, and cruel men, in the name of       the unknown King of Sp=
ain, of whom they had=20

never heard and whom       they considered to be much more unjust and cruel=
 than his=20

representatives.  He also gave them no time to deliberate but would       f=
all upon them, killing and=20

burning almost at the same instant that       his envoy arrived.           =
            The Province and=20

Kingdom of Guatemala         When he reached this kingdom, he began with a =
great massacre.=20

Nevertheless the principal lord, accompanied by many other lords of       U=
ltatlan, the chief town of=20

all the kingdom went forth with       trumpets, tambourines and great festi=
vity to receive him with=20

litters; they served him with all that they possessed, and       especially=
 by giving him ample food=20

and everything else they could.    2. The Spaniards lodged outside the town=
 that night because it=20

seemed       to them to be strong, and that they might run some risk inside=
 it.       The following=20

day, the captain called the principal lord and many       others, and when =
they came like tame=20

lambs, he seized them and       demanded so many loads of gold.  They repli=
ed that they had=20

none,       because that country does not produce it.  Guiltless of other f=
ault       and without trial or=20

sentence, he immediately ordered them to be       burned alive.    3. When =
the rulers throughout all=20

those provinces saw that the       Spaniards had burnt  By 1770 the panel h=
ad lost its lunette or=20

semi-circular form at top, and in outline resembled a Chippendale chair-bac=
k. The evolution is=20

easily traceable. A similar fashion is observed in tombstones in old countr=
y churchyards. By the=20

late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, especially in certain North=
 of England type clock-

cases, notably Lancashire and Cheshire, these panels are Gothic in characte=
r (see illustration, p.=20

231). Following French fashion, in some late examples there is a glass pane=
l (see illustration, p.=20

275).  The base undergoes certain changes, though in a lesser degree. Somet=
imes plain,=20

sometimes with a plinth, sometimes with feet. Dutch long clock-cases have g=
reat wooden balls as=20

feet. In the Chippendale period the plinth has a suggestion of Chinese char=
acter. In later types the=20

feet are more pronounced, and the base has an ornamental panel in the Shera=
ton period with a=20

delicate marquetry inlay of simple character. In Sheraton's _Design Book_ t=
here are two clocks=20

showing the base further ornamented by turned pillars similar to the hood. =
 The growing=20

importance of these feet and their frequent use, especially in ornate examp=
les, are shown in the=20

specimens illustrated (pp. 133, 137).  =3DThe Dial and its Character.=3D--W=
hen only one hand was in=20

use, it was obviously not necessary to denote the minutes. Later, the minut=
es were engraved on=20

the dial to meet the use of the minute hand; sometimes these were in a circ=
le inside the hour=20



numerals, and later they were put on the outer edge, outside the hour numer=
als. The hour=20

numerals are almost invariably of Roman style, and the figure IV has by uni=
versal custom been=20

engraved IIII, though there are examples of a late period with IV which are=
 of country make.=20

Similarly, Arabic figures have also been used. The illustration of a fine d=
ial, of eighteenth century=20

period, showing the various phases of the iron industry at Ashburnham, in S=
ussex, has these=20

figures; this is a country-made clock (p. 243).  The dials were brass, and =
the hour numerals=20

appeared on a circle of brass plated with silver. Iron dials were used late=
r, in the decadent period,=20

and both numerals and floral designs were painted on the enamelled surface =
in lieu of engraved=20

and ornamental metal-work, and often a landscape or figure subject occupied=
 the lunette.  The=20

lunette form followed the square face, and sometimes the maker put his name=
 in this lunette, and=20

later below the centre of the clock, and later again not at all on the dial=
. The lunette form no doubt=20

determined the shape of the panel of the door in the case below, to which w=
e have previously=20

alluded. The=20


_
they gave them no gold, they all fled from their towns and hid in       the=
 mountains; they=20

commanded all their people to go to the       Spaniards and serve them as t=
heir lords, but that they=20

should not,       however, reveal to them their hiding place.    4. All the=
 inhabitants came to offer=20

themselves to his men and to serve       them as their lords.  This compass=
ionate captain replied=20

that he       would not receive them; on the contrary, he would kill them a=
ll, if       they did not=20

disclose the whereabouts of their chiefs.  The Indians       answered that =
they knew nothing about=20

them but that the Spaniards       should make use of them, of their wives a=
nd children whom they=20

would       find in their houses, where they could kill them or do with the=
m       what they wished.=20

And this the Indians declared and offered many       times.    5. Stupefyin=
g to relate, the Spaniards=20

went to the houses where they       found the poor people working in safety=
 at their occupations=20

with       their wives and children, and there they wounded them with their=
       lances and cut them=20

to pieces.  They also went to a quiet, large and       important town, wher=
e the people were=20

ignorant of what had happened       to the others and were safe in their in=
nocence; within barely=20

two       hours they destroyed it, putting women, children, and the aged to=
       the sword, and killing=20

all who did not save themselves by flight.    6. Seeing that with such humi=
lity, submission, patience=20

and suffering       they could not break nor soften hearts so inhuman and b=
rutal, and       that they=20

were thus cut to pieces contrary to every show or shadow       of right, an=
d that they must=20

inevitably perish, the Indians       determined to summon all their people =
together and to die=20

fighting,       avenging themselves as best they could on such cruel and in=
fernal these forms. The=20

dial, by Henry Massy (1680), has the name between the numerals VI and VII. =
The lunette form in a=20

dial by John Draper (1703) has the name of the maker in a circular disc abo=
ve the hour circle.=20

1703.  Spandrels exhibiting later floral style of decoration.  (_At the Met=

ushman show the=20

character of engraving and the position of the maker's name (illustrated p.=
 163).  In regard to the=20

engraving put on the dials of these old clocks, it is not impossible that W=
illiam Hogarth, when he=20

was an apprentice at Master Ellis Gamble's shop, at the sign of the "Golden=
 Angel" in Cranbourn=20

Street, Leicester Fields, did some of this work. We know that Thomas Bewick=
 engraved clock dials=20

when an apprentice at Newcastle-upon-Tyne (see p. 215).  The last form of t=
he long-case dial is=20

circular, an unusual type in vogue during the closing decades of the eighte=
enth century, belonging=20

to the classic and French styles and in no way diverting the fashion of the=
 main stream of case-

makers.  Concerning the use of glass for the protection of the dial in the =
long-case clock, it was in=20

use in coaches for the first time in 1667. According to Pepys' _Diary_ we l=
earn: "Another pretty=20

thing was my Lady Ashly's speaking of the bad qualities of the glass coache=
s, among others the=20

flying open of the doors upon any great shake; but another, my Lady Peterbo=
rough, being in her=20

glass coach with the glass up, and seeing a lady pass by in a coach whom sh=
e would salute, the=20

glass was so clear that she thought=20


_
enemies; they well knew, however, that being not only unarmed but       als=
o naked and on foot,=20

they could not prevail against such fierce       people, mounted and so wel=
l armed, but must in the=20

end be destroyed.    7. They constructed some pits in the middle of the str=
eets, covered       over=20

with broken boughs of trees and grass, completely concealing       them: th=
ey were filled with sharp=20

stakes hardened by fire which       would be driven into the horses's belli=
es if they fell into the=20

pits.  Once, or twice, did some horses fall in but not often,       because=
 the Spaniards knew how to=20

avoid them.  In revenge, the       Spaniards made a law, that all Indians o=
f whatsoever rank and=20

age       whom they captured alive, they would throw into the pits.  And so=
       they threw in=20

pregnant and confined women, children, old men and as       many as they co=
uld capture who=20

were left stuck on the stakes, until       the pits were filled: It excited=
 great compassion to see them,=20

particularly the women with their children.    8. They killed all the other=
s with lances and knives;=20

they threw them       to savage dogs, that tore them to pieces and ate them=
; and when they=20

came across some lord, they accorded him the glass."  At first the hood of =
the clock lifted off and=20

the glass was fixed; later the glass was framed in a door, and subsequently=
 the hood slid off,=20

which fashion is found in all but the earliest examples.  The term "dial" i=
s a survival of the word=20

"sundial." Like all innovations, there may have been those who preferred th=
e old character, or it=20

may have been left to Charles Lamb, lover of past and faded memories, to ru=
minate on garden=20

gods in the Temple: "What an antique air had the now almost effaced sundial=
s, with their moral=20

inscriptions, seeming coevals with that Time which they measured, and to ta=
ke their revelations of=20

its flight immediately from heaven, holding correspondence with the fountai=
n of light.... The=20

shepherd, 'carved it out quaintly in the sun,' and turning philosopher by t=
he very occupation,=20

provided it with mottoes more touching than tombstones." Elia, Shakespearea=
n scholar that he=20

was, could not have forgotten the melancholy Jaques with his:--          I =
met a fool i' the forest,     A=20

motley fool; a miserable world!     As I do live by food, I met a fool;    =
 Who laid him down and=20

bask'd him in the sun,     And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,     In=
 good set terms and yet a=20

motley fool.=20
