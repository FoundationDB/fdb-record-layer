ship of _
park-like valley, covered with grass, and ornamented with fine timber. Much=
 dhurra was cultivated,=20

and several villages were passed, that had been plundered by the Egyptians =
during the recent=20

attack. This country must be exceedingly unhealthy during the rainy season,=
 as the soil is=20

extremely rich, and the valleys, surrounded by hills, would become swamps. =
From the Settite river,=20

at Ombrega, to our halting-place beneath the tamarind-tree, at this spot, i=
s about thirty-five miles=20

south, 10 degrees east."  Our camp was in a favourable locality, well shade=
d by large trees, on the=20

margin of a small stream; this was nearly dry at this season, and the water=
 was extremely bad,=20

having a strong taste of copper. I had remarked throughout the neighbourhoo=
d unmistakeable=20

evidences of the presence of this metal--the surface of the rocks was in ma=
ny places bright green,=20

like malachite, and, upon an exploration of the bed of the stream, I found =
veins of a green=20

substance in the perpendicular cliffs that had been cut through by the torr=
ent. These green veins=20

passed through a bed of reddish, hard rock, glistening with minute crystals=
, which I believe to have=20

been copper. There is no doubt that much might be done were the mineral wea=
lth of this country=20

thoroughly investigated.  The day following our arrival was passed in recei=
ving visits from a=20

number of Abyssinians, and the head men of Mek Nimmur. There was a mixture =
of people, as=20

many of the Jaleen Arabs who had committed some crime in the Egyptian terri=
tory, had fled=20

across the country and joined the exiled chief of their tribe. Altogether, =
the society in this district=20

was not creme de la creme, as Mek Nimmur's territory was an asylum for all =
the blackguards of=20

the adjoining countries, who were attracted by the excitement and lawlessne=
ss of continual border=20

warfare. The troop that we had seen at Ombrega returned with a hundred and =
two head of camels,=20

that they had stolen from the west bank of the Atbara. Mounted upon hygeens=
, Mek Nimmur's=20

irregulars thought nothing of marching sixty miles in one day; thus their a=
ttack and retreat were=20

equally sudden and unexpected.  I had a quantity of rhinoceros hide in piec=
es of the size required=20

for shields; these were much prized in this fighting country, and I present=
ed them to a number of=20

head men who had honoured us with a visit. I begged them to guide two of my=
 people to the=20

presence of Mek Nimmur, with a preliminary message. This they promised to p=
erform.=20

Accordingly, I sent Taher Noor and Bacheet on horseback, with a most polite=
 message,=20

accompanied with my card in an envelope, and a small parcel, carefully wrap=
ped in four or five=20

different papers; this contained a very beautiful Persian lance-head, of po=
lished steel inlaid with=20

gold, that I had formerly purchased at Constantinople.  During their absenc=
e, we were inundated=20

with visitors, the Abyssinians, in their tight pantaloons, contrasting stro=
ngly with the loosely-clad=20

Arabs. In about an hour, my messengers returned, accompanied by two men on =
horseback, with a=20

hospitable message fronm Mek Nimmur, and an invitation to pay him a visit a=
t his own residence. I=20

had some trifling present ready for everybody of note, and, as Taher Noor a=
nd my people had=20

already explained all they knew concerning us, Mek Nimmur's suspicions had =
entirely vanished.=20

As we were conversing with Mek Nimmur's messengers through the medium of Ta=
her Noor, who=20

knew their language, our attention was attracted by the arrival of a tremen=
dous swell who at a=20

distance I thought must be Mek Nimmur himself. A snow-white mule carried an=
 equally snow-white=20

person, whose tight white pantaloons looked as though he had forgotten his =
trousers, and had=20

mounted in his drawers. He carried a large umbrella to shade his complexion=
; a pair of handsome=20

silver-mounted pistols were arranged upon his saddle, and a silver-hilted c=
urved sword, of the=20

peculiar Abyssinian form, hung by his side. This grand personage was follow=
ed by an attendant,=20



also mounted upon a mule, while several men on foot accompanied them, one o=
f whom carried his=20

lance and shield. Upon a near approach, he immediately dismounted, and adva=
nced towards us,=20

bowing in a most foppish manner, while his attendant followed him on foot w=
ith an enormous=20

violin, which he immediately handed to him. This fiddle was very peculiar i=
n shape, being a=20

square, with an exceedingly long neck extending from one corner; upon this =
was stretched a=20

solitary string, and the bow was very short and much bent. This was an Abys=
sinian Paganini. He=20

was a professional minstrel of the highest grade, who had been sent by Mek =
Nimmur to welcome=20

us on our arrival.  These musicians are very similar to the minstrels of an=
cient times; they attend at=20

public rejoicings, and at births, deaths, and marriages of great personages=
, upon which occasions=20

they extemporize their songs according to circumstances. My hunting in the =
Base country formed=20

his theme, and for at least an hour he sang of my deeds, in an extremely lo=
ud and disagreeable=20

voice, while he accompanied himself upon his fiddle, which he held downward=
s like a violoncello:=20

during the whole of his song he continued in movement, marching with a slid=
ing step to the front,=20

and gliding to the right and left in a manner that, if intended to be grace=
ful, was extremely comic.=20

The substance of this minstrelsy was explained to me by Taher Noor, who lis=
tened eagerly to the=20

words, which he translated with evident satisfaction. Of course, like all m=
instrels, he was an=20

absurd flatterer, and, having gathered a few  "Certainly. Do you wish to?" =
 "That is what I am going=20

to Glogova for."  "Why, if you don't believe in it?"  "Just for that very r=
eason. If I believed in it I=20

should not go."  "You are a heathen."  She drew her chair away from him, at=
 which he at once=20

became serious.  "Have I hurt you?" he asked contritely.  "No, but you frig=
hten me," and her lovely=20

oval face expressed disappointment.  "I will believe anything you like, onl=
y don't be afraid of me."=20

Veronica smiled slightly.  "It would be a shame not to believe it," struck =
in Mrs. Szliminszky, "for it=20

is a fact--there is plenty to prove it. If you don't believe that, you don'=
t believe anything. Either the=20

miracles in the Bible are true, and if so, this is true too, or ..."  But s=
he could not finish her=20

sentence, for at that moment Madame Krisbay rose from the table, saying she=
 was tired, and=20

would like to retire to her room, and Mrs. Mravucsan led her and Veronica t=
o two small rooms=20

opening on to the courtyard. In the doorway Gyuri bowed to Veronica, who re=
turned it with a slight=20

nod.  "Shall we start early in the morning?" he asked.  She bowed with mock=
 humility.  "As you=20

like, Mr. Thomas," she said.  Gyuri understood the reference, and answered =
in the same strain:  "It=20

depends upon how long the saints sleep."  Veronica turned her head, and sho=
ok her fist playfully=20

at him.  "I will pay you out!" she said.  Gyuri could hardly take his eyes =
off her, she looked so pretty=20

as she spoke. Let the saints look like that if they could!  Soon after the =
Szliminszky pair started for=20

home, accompanied by a man carrying a lantern. Mrs. Szliminszky had made Wl=
adin put on a light=20

spring coat, hung a long cloak over his shoulders, tied a big woollen scarf=
 round his neck, and=20

having ordered him only to breathe through his nose, once they were out, sh=
e turned to Gyuri=20

again.  "Yes, it is a beautiful legend, it made a great impression on me." =
 "Poor legends!" returned=20

Gyuri. "If we were to pick some of them to pieces, and take the romance out=
 of them, their saintly=20

odor, their mystery, what strange and simple truths would be left!"  "Well,=
 they must not be picked=20

to pieces, that is all. Wladin, turn up the collar of your coat."  The lawy=
er thought for a minute.=20

"Perhaps you are right," he said.  After a short time Gyuri also asked to b=
e shown to his room.=20

"The magnet has gone!" muttered the lawyer's clerk.  Hardly had the door cl=
osed when Kukucska,=20

the butcher, exclaimed:  "Now we are free!"  He took off his coat, rolled u=
p his sleeves, thus=20



showing the head of an ox tatooed on his left arm, then winked knowingly at=
 Mravucsan. The=20

mayor seemed to understand the look, for he went to a cupboard and pulled o=
ut one of the=20

drawers, from which he took a pack of cards. The knave of spades was missin=
g, but that did not=20

make any difference to the intelligent members of Babaszek society, for the=
y had once before=20

played "Preference" with those cards, and the last player had simply receiv=
ed one card less when=20

they were dealt out, though he was supposed to have the knave of spades, an=
d it was called the=20

"spirit card." If they were playing spades, the last player in imagination =
threw the knave on it,=20

saying: "I play the spirit card!" So now, in spite of this small difficulty=
, they decided to play, and the=20

game lasted till daylight. The Senators, the butcher, and the clergyman pla=
yed, the lawyer's clerk=20

dealt, and Klempa looked on, having no money to lose, and went from one pla=
yer to the other,=20

looking over their shoulders, and giving them advice what to play. But one =
after the other sent him=20

away, declaring he brought them bad luck, which rather depressed him. So th=
e poor schoolmaster=20

wandered from one to the other, till at last he took a seat between the cle=
rgyman and the butcher,=20

dropped his weary head on the table, and went to sleep, his long beard doub=
led up, and serving=20

as a pillow. But he was to have a sad awakening, for that mischievous Pal K=
ukucska, seeing the=20

beard on the table, conceived the idea of sealing it there; and fetching a =
candle and sealing-wax,=20

they dropped some on the beard in three places, and Mravucsan pressed his o=
wn signet ring on it.=20

Then they went on playing, until he should awake.  Other incidents, and not=
 very pleasant ones=20

either, were taking place in the house. Madame Krisbay, to whom the mayor's=
 wife had given her=20

own bedroom, would not go to bed with the enormous eider-down quilt over he=
r, for she was afraid=20

of being suffocated during the night. She asked for a "paplan" (a kind of w=
added bed cover), but=20

Mrs. Mravucsan did not possess such a thing, so she brought in her husband'=
s enormous fur-lined=20

cloak and threw it over madame, which so frightened the poor nervous woman =
that she was=20

attacked by migraine, and the mayor's wife had to spend the night by her be=
d, putting horse-radish=20

on her temples.  An unpleasant thing happened to Veronica too. As soon as s=
he was alone in the=20

Mravucsans' best bedroom, she locked the door, hung a cloak on the door-han=
dle so that no one=20

could look through the key-hole, drew the curtains across the tiny windows =
which opened on to the=20

courtyard, and then began to undress. She had taken off the bodice of her d=
ress and unfastened=20

her skirt, when all at once she became aware of two bright eyes watching he=
r intently from under=20

the bed. It was a kitten, and it was gazing at her as intently and admiring=
ly as though it had been a=20

prince changed by some old witch into the form of a cat. Veronica, alarmed,=
 caught up her skirt=20

and bodice, and put them on again.  "Go along, you tiresome=20


_
wandered slightly from the truth in his poetical description of my deeds.  =
He sang of me as though=20

I had been Richard Coeur de Lion, and recounted, before an admiring throng =
of listeners, how "I=20

had wandered with a young wife from my own distant country to fight the und=
ressing."  She was=20

such an innocent child, she was ashamed to undress before the kitten. She d=
ressed again, and=20

tried to drive it out of the room, but it hid itself under the bed, then ju=
mped on a cupboard, and it=20

was quite impossible to get rid of it. Mrs. Mravucsan,=20


_
elephants and lions were struck down like lambs and kids by my hands; that =
during my absence in=20

the hunt, my wife had been carried off by the Base; that I had, on my retur=
n to my pillaged camp,=20

galloped off in chase, and, overtaking the enemy, hundreds had fallen by my=
 rifle and sword, and I=20

had liberated and recovered the lady, who now had arrived safe with her lor=
d in the country of the=20

great Mek Nimmur," &c. &c. &c.  This was all very pretty, no doubt, and as =
true as most next room,=20

called out:  "What is the matter, my dear?"  "I can't drive the cat out."  =
"Never mind, she won't hurt=20

you."  "But she always watches me," answered Veronica.  She put her candle =
out, and began to=20

undress in the dark, but that tiresome cat walked into the middle of the ro=
om again, and her eyes=20

shone more than ever.  "Wait a bit, you curious little thing," said Veronic=
a. "I'll get the best of you=20

yet."  She made a barricade of chairs, then got inside it, as though=20


_
and musical descriptions, but I felt certain that there must be something t=
o pay for this flattering=20

entertainment; if you are considered to be a great man, a present is invari=
ably expected in=20

proportion to your importance. I suggested to Taher Noor that I must give h=
im a couple of dollars.=20

"What!" said Taher Noor, "a couple of dollars! Impossible! a musician of hi=
s standing it=20

accustomed to receive thirty and forty dollars from great people for so bea=
utiful and honourable a=20

song."  This was somewhat startling; I began to reflect upon the price of a=
 box at Her Majesty's=20

Theatre in London; but there I was not the hero of the opera; this minstrel=
 combined the whole=20

affair in a most simple manner; he was Verdi, Costa, and orchestra all in o=
ne; he was a thorough=20

Macaulay as historian, therefore I had to pay the composer as well as the f=
iddler. I compromised=20

the matter, and gave him a few dollars, as I understood that he was Mek Nim=
mur's private=20

minstrel, but I never parted with my dear Maria Theresa* with so much regre=
t as upon that=20

occasion, and I begged him not to incommode himself by paying us another vi=
sit, or, should he be=20

obliged to do so, I trusted he would in a fortress, and began to undo her b=
oots. Do you think that=20

barricade made any impression on the kitten? Not a bit of it. There she was=
 again, on the top of=20

the chairs, from there one jump took her on to the washing-stand, and anoth=
er on to Veronica's=20

bed. There she was seized upon and a shawl bound round her head.  "Now, kit=
ty, stare at me if=20

you can!"  And after that she managed to undress in peace.     CHAPTER II. =
 NIGHT BRINGS=20

COUNSEL.   While the two ladies were occupied with these trifles, and Klemp=
a with his beard=20

sealed to the table slept the sleep of the just, Gyuri had also retired to =
his bed, but found it=20

impossible to sleep. It was not from indigestion, for Mrs. Mravucsan's exce=
llent supper had not=20

disagreed with him; it was his brain which was hard at work, going over all=
 the incidents that had=20

taken place that day. He seemed to have lived through years in the last few=
 hours. What an age it=20

seemed since he had looked for the umbrella in Mrs. Muencz's shop! And it w=
as found quite=20

unexpectedly. God had given it into the charge of an angel.  From the umbre=
lla his thoughts flew=20

to the "angel."  She was a nice little thing, he decided; not a bit=20
