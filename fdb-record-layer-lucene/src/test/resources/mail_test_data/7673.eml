dracaena marginata diningroom platform as if it had been half down the block; yet the airmen were 4,000 feet in the air. We had luncheon at the brigade headquarters, and it was made a gala occasion.

our blood and iron. Probably no battle line in the world today is more interesting than the Italian 

front was in the autumn of 1917. The south face of the Alps often is green and beautiful, but 

generally the northern faces of those mountains are bleak and rugged and steep. The battle line 

ran a zig-zag course through the mountains, now meeting in gulches, now scurrying away up to 

mesas, again climbing to the top of the barren heights. We stood one sunny day on a quiet sector 

of the Pasubio. We were with the Liguria brigade, the 157-158th infantry. Through a peep-hole in 

the trench we looked across a gulch to another mountainside and saw there the Austrian trenches, 

not 200 yards away. Before them lay the ugly scar of brown rusted barbed wire, and just below the 

wire, sprawled out on the white limestone of the steep mountainside, lay fifty dead Italian soldiers 

who had vainly charged into the machine guns up that formidable slope. seems to indicate that the 

Orinoco must be very narrow at this point. (* The Amazon also is crossed twice on bridges of 

wood near its source in the lake Lauricocha; first north of Chavin, and then below the confluence 

of the Rio Aguamiras. These, the only two bridges that have been thrown over the largest river we 

yet know, are called Puente de Quivilla, and Puente de Guancaybamba.) It is generally estimated 

by the Indians to be only two or three hundred feet broad. They say that the Orinoco, above the 

Raudal of the Guaharibos, is no longer a river, but a brook (riachuelo); while a well informed 

ecclesiastic, Fray Juan Gonzales, who had visited those countries, assured me that the Orinoco, 

in the part where its farther course is no longer known, is two-thirds of the breadth of the Rio 

Negro near San Carlos. This opinion appears to me hardly probable; but I relate what I have 

collected, and affirm nothing positively.  In the rocky 


_
grisliest sight we had seen during our adventures.  Medill and Henry went to another lookout, 

leaving me with the Italian soldiers in the trench. Their luncheon came up, a fine rich soup, with 

bread cubes in it, some potatoes and vegetables. It looked palatable and was good. There was 

enough, but not plenty. As we sat in the trench waiting for Henry and Medill, one of the heroes 

beside me, after thinking it all out carefully, burst forth with this:  "I livea in Pittsburgh."  It was plain 

to his comrades that he had put his meaning through to me. They clearly were impressed by his 

prowess. This cheered him up. He went on to further linguistic feats.  "Is, I live-a there five year." 

That also got over and his comrades realized that he was a Guaharibos, Spanish soldiers pretend 

to have found the fine kind of saussurite (Amazon-stone), of which we have spoken. This tradition 

however is very uncertain; and the Indians, whom I interrogated on the subject, assured me that 

the green stones, called piedras de Macagua* at Esmeralda, were purchased from the Guaicas 

and Guaharibos, who traffic with hordes much farther to the east. (* The etymology of this name, 

which is unknown to me, might lead to the knowledge of the spot where these stones are found. I 

have sought in vain the name of Macagua among the numerous tributary streams of the Tacutu, 

the Mahu, the Rupunury, and the Rio Trombetas.) The same uncertainty prevails respecting these 

stones, as that which attaches to many other

Then in a joyous spirit of over-confidence, he waved the oriflamme of speech in our faces.  "Is, my 

papa he live-a in Brooklyn. He keepa da butcha shop and is maka da roast bif. Is, my papa's 

brodder he live-a in Brooklyn too. He keepa da saloon and is maka da jag!" Then we shook hands 

as fellow Americans.  In another hour we had wormed our way through the tunnels to the other 

side of the peak, and had scrambled down the mountainside to the general headquarters. Never 

since Hannibal's day were more interesting brigade headquarters established. They were niched 

into the mountain side about 4,000 feet above productions of the Indies. On the coast, at the 

distance of some hundred leagues, the country where they are found is positively named; but 

when the traveller with difficulty penetrates into that country, he discovers that the natives are 

ignorant even of the name of the object of his research. It might be supposed that the amulets of 

saussurite found in the possession of the Indians of the Rio Negro, come from the Lower 

Maranon, while those that are received by the missions of the Upper Orinoco and the Rio Carony 

come from a country situated between the sources of the Essequibo and the Rio Branco. The 


_
sleeping quarters and offices were half tunnelled into the hillside. The diningroom was mounted on 

a platform overlooking the gorge below. Across the gorge a quarter of a mile away an aerial tram 

ran. That morning two airplanes--an Italian plane and an Austrian--met out by the tram little lake 

Amucu, though very prevalent at Angostura, is wholly without foundation. A curious geognostic 

discovery remains to be made in the eastern part of America, that of finding in a primitive soil a 

rock of euphotide containing the piedra de Macagua.  I shall here proceed to give
