the other half worse=20

than wasted, since the handsome young lieutenant had so brazenly monopolize=

you home in time for dinner, never fear," he returned, but apparently the l=
ittle car was no party to=20

the promise. A short mile from the reservation the motor began to miss, and=
 a few minutes farther=20

along it stopped altogether. Blount got out and began to investigate. There=
 was plenty of gasolene,=20

but the spark appeared to be dead.  "I ought to have a leather medal!" he c=
onfided to Patricia, in=20

great disgust. "Mrs. Blount told me that the batteries needed to be changed=
, and I had them=20

changed, but neglected to have them tested. Sit still and let me spin it on=
 the magneto a while."=20

She let him do it until the perspiration was standing in fine little beads =
on his forehead and he was=20

hot and desperate. Then she said sweetly: "I don't believe I'd wear myself =
out that way, if I were=20

you, Evan. Something happened to the magneto two or three weeks ago, and it=
 has never been=20

fixed."  Blount pushed his driving-cap back, mopped his face, and came arou=
nd to dive once more=20

into the wiring in the battery box. Dusk was coming on, and he had to light=
 one of the side-lamps=20

to serve as a lantern. By changing the wiring he was finally able to evoke =
a desultory response=20

from the spark-coil, and a little later to start the motor after some limpi=
ng fashion.  "Oh, my poor=20

dinner!" said Miss Anners, who was new locality; and though he was a walkin=
g encyclopaedia, he=20

had not obtained this reputation without much study and labor in addition t=
o his extensive voyages=20

and travels "all over the world."  "A learned biblical scholar of the last =
century, who studied Oriental=20

history in connection with the sacred record, identifies Aden as the Eden m=
entioned by Ezekiel in=20

describing the wealth of Tyrus," continued the commander.  "But who was Tyr=
us, Captain?" asked=20

Mrs. Blossom, who was wide awake when any scriptural name was used.  "He wa=
sn't anybody,=20

Mrs. Blossom; and when Ezekiel and some other of the prophets used the word=
 Tyrus, they meant=20

Tyre; and doubtless you have read about Tyre and Sidon."  "I never heard it=
 called by that name=20

before," added the worthy lady with a blush.  "Read Ezekiel xxvii. and you =
will find it. This place=20

was known before the time of Christ, and was the centre of an extensive com=
