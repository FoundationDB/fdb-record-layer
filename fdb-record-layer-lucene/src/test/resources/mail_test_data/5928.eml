after all you've taught me, and all my resolutions. I can't stop  in London just now, as I would not 

know where to go to; so I'm  coming down to you by the train that arrives at half-past three.  I hope 

that you won't mind; that it won't put auntie out much. My  love to her and the baby. Your sorrowful 

niece,      "NORAH PEELE."  "When we thought her so comfortably settled in a good situation, 

doing so well," muttered Franks. "What can Mrs. Lowndes mean by cutting the poor lass adrift at a 

day's notice!"  "Norah must have got into some scrape," observed Persis.  "Ay, that's plain as a 

flag-staff. She might have given us a notion of what the scrape is, instead of writing about my 

teaching and her own resolutions, which we knew all about before. But poor Bessy's motherless 

girl must always find a home under our roof."  "Oh, yes," said Persis, cheerfully. "While you are 

busy with the boys, I'll see to clearing out the little room, and having all right and tight for our 

Norah. I think that she is as dear to me as to you, and that is saying a good deal."  "I loved the lass 

from the first day I saw her, and I thought there was the making of a very good girl in her, too, only 

she and her brother had been brought up so badly, scarce knowing a lie from the truth. But poor 

Bessy,--she's gone, and it's not for her brother to be diving down to bring up her failings to the 

light. She loved her children, anyhow, and couldn't teach them what she didn't know clearly 

herself. But who's to meet Norah at the station?" added Ned Franks, abruptly. "You can't go 

because of baby, and I can't go because of the boys."  "I am afraid that Norah must find her way 

home by herself," observed Persis, "unless the miller is going to the town. I'll walk over to the dell 

and ask him. But Norah knows the road so well that her coming alone matters less."  "It matters a 

great deal," cried Franks, with impatience. "Here the lass is returning with a wet sail and a heavy 

heart, I warrant ye, and she finds no one to take her by the hand and welcome her to port, or to 

carry her bundle for her. I'd not have minded it if she'd been coming with colors flying to pay us a 

visit. Why on earth should she choose an hour when she knows I'm always in the school-room?" 

Persis did not know how to answer the question, and had no time to do so had she known, for the 

sound of young voices, and the trampling of heavy boots in the adjoining room, told that the boys 

were beginning to assemble. Never had Franks been less inclined to begin his daily labor; never 

had he met his scholars with less of kindly good-humor.  For Ned was no model of perfection. He 

was naturally of a hot and hasty spirit; and though, from Christian principle, he usually held his 

temper under such command that he had the reputation of possessing a good one, it had cost him 

many a struggle to make it obey the rein. On this particular morning, with an aching head, weary 

frame, and worried mind, he felt irritable and impatient. He was angry with the dull lad who could 

not remember that _seven times eight_ is not _seventy-eight_; and when Bill Doyle, repeating his 

natural-history lesson, said that horses ran wild on the _staircase_ in Russia, instead of the 

_steppes_, Ned, who at another time might have smiled at the blunder, which was probably made 

half in fun, muttered something about "blockhead," and sent the boy to the bottom of the class. 

Bill, the son of Sir Lacy Barton's groom, being a sharp, pert little fellow, was not disposed to take 

his punishment quietly, or to be called blockhead on any subject connected with horses. He 

whispered to the boy who sat next him, "He don't know nothing about horses hisself."  "What's 

that?" exclaimed Ned Franks, whose sharp ear had caught the whisper.  "Father says sailors have 

never no notion of riding," said the saucy little urchin, "and when they mounts a horse, are as likely 

to get up with their face to the tail as the head." At which observation a little titter ran round the 

school.  It has been remarked that few things nettle a man so much as to doubt his skill in riding; 



and Ned, who was always jealous for the honor of his old profession, was in no humor to take as a 

jest the slight thus cast on the whole of the navy.  "Then you may tell your father, when you go 

home," he said, angrily, "that there are no better horsemen than some of our blue-jackets; and as 

for riding,--when we were lying off Alexandria, every day that we could get leave ashore, I and my 

"How hard you are on spies. And how little knowledge of human nature you have, after all, if you 

don't understand that a man suddenly out of his head with jealousy will do things of which he'd be 

incapable when he was sane."  The argument silenced me. I knew--I had known for a long time--

that jealousy could rouse a demon in Raoul. And only to-night he had reminded me that he was a 

"jealous brute." I remembered what answer he had made when I asked him what he would do if I 

deceived him. He said that he would kill me, and kill himself after. As he spoke, the blood had 

streamed up to his forehead, and streamed back again, leaving him pale. A flash like steel had 

shot out of his eyes--the dear eyes that are not cold. It was true, as this cruel wretch reminded me, 

Raoul would do things under the torture of jealousy that he would cut off his hand sooner than do 

when his own, sweet, poet-nature was in ascendancy.  "As a proof of what I say," Godensky went 

on, "du Laurier did wait, did hear from me the place where you were to stop and pick me up. And if 

it wouldn't be the worst of form to bet, I'd bet that he found some way of getting there in time to 

see that I had told the truth."  "You coward!" I stammered.  "On the contrary, a brave man. I've 

heard that du Laurier is a fine shot, and that very few men in Paris can touch him with the foils. So 

you see--"  "You want to frighten me!" I exclaimed.  "You misjudge me in every way."  My only 

answer was to tell Marianne to press the button which gives the signal for my chauffeur to stop. 

Instantly the electric carriage slowed down, then came to a standstill. My man opened the door 

and Count Godensky submitted to my will. Nevertheless, he was far from being in a submissive 

mood, as I did not need to be reminded by the tone of his voice when he said "au revoir."  Nothing 

could have been more polite than the words or his way of speaking them, as he stood in the street 

with his hat in his hand. But to me they meant a threat, and as a threat they were intended.  My 

talk with Godensky at the stage door, my pause to pick him up, and my second pause to set him 

down, had all taken time, of which I had had little enough at the starting, if I were to meet Ivor 

Dundas when he arrived. It was two or three minutes after midnight, or so my watch said, when we 

drew up before the gate of my high-walled garden in the quiet Rue d'Hollande.  A little while ago I 

had been ready to seize upon almost any expedient for keeping Raoul away from my house to-

night, but now, after what I had just heard from Godensky, I prayed to see him waiting for me. 

Nobody (except Ivor, concerning whom I'd given orders) would be let in so late at night, during my 

absence, not even Raoul himself; so if he had come to reproach me, or break with me, he would 

have to stand outside the locked gate till I appeared. I looked for him longingly, but he was not 

there. There was, to be sure, a motor brougham in the street, for a wonder (usually the Rue 

d'Hollande is as empty as a desert, after eleven o'clock), but a girl's face peered out at me from 

the window--an impish, curiously abnormal little face it was--extinguishing the spark of hope that 

sprang to life as I caught sight of the carriage.  It was standing before the closed gate of a house 

almost opposite mine, and the girl seemed somewhat interested in me; but I was not at all 

interested in her, and I hate being stared at as if I were something in a museum.  The gate is 

always kept locked at night, when I'm at the theatre; but Marianne has the key, and we let 

ourselves in when we come, for only old Henri sits up, and he is growing a little deaf. A moment, 



and we were inside, the chauffeur spinning away to the garage.  Usually I am newly delighted 

every night with my quaint old house and its small, but pretty garden, to which it seems delightful 

to come home after hours of hard work at the theatre. But to-night, though a cheerful light shone 

out from between the drawn curtains of the salon, the place looked inexpressibly dreary, even 

forbidding, to me. I felt that I hated the house, though I had chosen it after a long search for 

peacefulness and privacy. How gloomy, how dead, was the street beyond the high wall, with all its 

windows closed like the eyes of corpses. There was a moist, depressing smell of earth after long-

continued rains, in the garden. No wonder the place had been to let at a bargain, for a long term! 

There had been a murder in it once, and it had stood empty for 


_
pace that would have made your jockeys stare."  As the word of the one-armed school-master was 

always implicitly believed, Ned could see that he had raised himself not a little in the eyes of his 

pupils, especially those of Bill Doyle, by the accomplishment of horsemanship to which he had 

thus laid claim. But Ned had hardly spoken the hasty sentence, when he was angry with himself 

for having been betrayed by foolish pride into uttering it. He felt that for once he had been guilty 

both of exaggeration, and of (without actually speaking untruth) misleading the boys as to his 

meaning.  Any one of a soul less transparently candid than that of Ned Franks might have thought 

it weak scrupulosity to let the mind dwell for a moment on such a seeming trifle as this. There is a 

marvellous difference between the consciences of men. Some have become hard as the horny 

hoof of an ass; little short of a bullet (by which figure I would represent some open act of 

wickedness) can make them feel pain at all. Other consciences are tender and sensitive as the 

apple of the human eye, and what to many would seem an almost invisible speck of sin greatly 

disturbs and troubles them. This is one of the reasons why holiness and humility are so often 

found together; while the hardened offender, whose conscience is seared, seems almost past 

feeling remorse. Franks knew that he had spoken very idle words, and though he was inclined, as 

most people are, to make excuses for himself, his honest soul could not rest at ease until he had 

openly thirteen of the fifteen years since the almost forgotten tragedy. I had been the tenant for 

two years now--before I became a "star," with a theatre of my own in Paris. I had had no fear of 

the ghost said to haunt the house. Indeed, I remembered thinking, and saying, that the story only 

made the place more interesting. But now I said to myself that I wished I had never spoken so 

lightly. Perhaps the ghost had brought me bad luck. I felt as if the murder must have happened on 

just such a still, brooding, damp night as this. Maybe it was the anniversary, if I only knew.  I went 

indoors, Marianne following. Henri, very thin, very precise, withered like a winter apple, had fallen 

into a doze in the hall, where he had sat, hoping to hear the stopping of my carriage. He rose up, 

bowing and blinking, just as he had done often before, and would often again--if life were to go on 

for me in the old way. He regretted not having heard Mademoiselle. Would Mademoiselle take 

supper?  No, Mademoiselle would not take supper. She wanted nothing, and Henri might go to 

bed.  "I thank Mademoiselle. When I have closed the house."  "But I don't want the house closed," 

I said. "I shall sit up for awhile. It's hot--close and stuffy. I may like to have the windows open." 

"The visitor Mademoiselle expected did not arrive. Perhaps--"  "If he comes, Marianne or I will let 

him in. But he may not come, now it is so late."  When Henri had gone, I told Marianne that she 

might go, too. I did not want her to wait. If the person I had 


_
error as well as he could.  When lessons were over, and the boys were about to disperse, Ned 

stopped their going out of the school-room by a gesture of his hand. He stood up with his honest 

face a good deal more flushed than usual, for the acknowledgment which he was forcing himself 

to make was humiliating and painful.  "Boys," said he, in that clear voice which always 

commanded very old friend; in fact, Mr. Ivor Dundas, whom Marianne must remember in London. 

He was to call--if he did call--only on a matter of business, which would take but a few minutes to 

get through, and possibly he would not even come into the house. If the gate-bell rang, I would 

answer it myself, and speak with Mr. Dundas, perhaps in the garden. Then I would let him out and 

come
