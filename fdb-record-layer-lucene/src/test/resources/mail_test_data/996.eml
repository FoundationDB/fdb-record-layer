AGRICULTURAL  Farmers, Write for Your Paper.   Illinois Tile-Makers' Conven=
tion.  BUSINESS=20

OF THE YEAR.  (_Continued from last week._)  An interesting feature of the =
proceedings of the=20

Tile-Makers' Convention was the brief reports of members regarding their bu=
siness last year.=20

About forty manufacturers reported. In the majority of cases the demand has=
 been fair; in a few=20

very brisk; in quite a number it was said that sales could be made only at =
a reduction in prices. It=20

was easy to see that in some sections of the State the work of tile-making =
was overdone, that is,=20

the supply is in excess of the demand. It was the general expression that p=
rices could not be=20

greatly reduced and leave a reasonable profit to the manufacturer.  HOW TO =
INCREASE THE=20

DEMAND  was the question this year. Last year at this convention the talk w=
as upon "How shall=20

we supply the demand?" The answers to the question of how to increase the d=
emand were=20

various. Some advocated a rigid adherence to fair living prices, and thus t=
each farmers that it is=20

useless to wait for cheaper tile; make a first-class article and the cheap =
tile that is hurting the trade=20

will be forced out of the market. There was a general advocacy of a wider d=
issemination of a=20

knowledge of the benefits of drainage. Show farmers and fruit-growers that =
they can add new=20

acres to their farms, and take from tiled land a sufficiently increased yie=
ld the first year to pay for=20

tiling, and that their land is worth more dollars per acre after tiling tha=
n the expense amounts to,=20

and the demand will multiply many fold. Teach the farmers how to lay their =
drains properly, so that=20

no disappointment will result, and every acre drained will advertise the pr=
ofits from drainage.=20

Circulate facts in regard to drainage as contributed to shedding of the hai=
r, which rendered the=20

brute unfit for use. Unwilling to believe that effects so dreadful could be=
 produced by a cause=20

apparently trifling, travellers began to suspect that the Indians, or other=
s, of whom they obtained=20

food for their horses, had, for some base and selfish end, mingled poison w=
ith it. The greatest=20

precaution was observed. They refused to stop at any house on the way, and =
carried, for the=20

distance of forty or fifty miles, their own provision; but after all suffer=
ed the same calamities. This=20

excited a serious inquiry into the true cause of their distress. The fly, w=
hich has been mentioned,=20

was known to be a most singular insect, and peculiarly troublesome to horse=
s. At length it was=20

admitted by all, that the cause of the evils complained of could be no othe=
r than this insect. Other=20

precautions have since been observed, particularly that of riding over the =
road infested with it _in=20

the night_; and now it happens that comparatively few horses are destroyed.=
 I am unable to=20

describe it from my own observation. I passed over the same road in April l=
ast, only two weeks=20



after it disappeared, and was obliged to take the description from others. =
Its colour is a dark=20

brown; it has an elongated head, with a small and sharp proboscis; and is i=
n size between the gnat=20

and musqueto. When it alights upon a horse, it darts through the hair, much=
 like a gnat, and never=20

quits its hold until removed by force. When a horse stops to drink, swarms =
fly about the head, and=20

crowd into the mouth, nostrils, and ears; hence it is supposed the poison i=
s communicated=20

inwardly. Whether this be true or not, the most fatal consequences result. =
It is singular, that from=20

the time of its first appearance, it has never extended for a greater dista=
nce than forty miles, in one=20

direction, and usually, it is confined to fifteen miles. In no other part o=
f the country has it ever been=20

seen. From this fact, it would seem probable that the cause of its existenc=
e is local. But what it is,=20

none can tell. After the warm weather commences, it disappears as effectual=
ly from human=20

observation, as if it were annihilated. Towards the close of December it sp=
rings up all at once into=20

being again, and resumes the work of destruction. A fact, so singular, I co=
uld not have ventured to=20

state, without the best evidence of its reality. All the circumstances here=
 related, are familiar to=20

hundreds, and were in almost every man's mouth, when I passed through the c=
ountry. In addition=20

to this, they were confirmed by the account which I received from Col. John=
 M'Kee, a gentleman of=20

much intelligence and respectability, who is the present agent of the gener=
al government for the=20

Choctaw nation. He has consented to obtain specimens of the insect for your=
 examination, when it=20

returns again; and will, I hope, accompany the transmission with a more per=
fect description than it=20

has been possible for me to communicate.  In concluding this narrative of f=
acts, I=20
