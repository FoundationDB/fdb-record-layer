Introductory to Some Extracts from the Writings she had. But had it been a =
stranger or an enemy=20

whose presence he felt amidst that immense, dreary, aching solitude, still =
he would have flung=20

himself at his feet and implored his help and pity. Surely he might cast hi=
mself upon the God who=20

counted the shining host above his head; surely that God would look down wi=
th pity on the=20

creature his hand had made, who was =E2=80=9Cwandering in dumb dismay=E2=80=
=9D over the untrodden snow. If=20

He would only bring him home, and let him see his mother=E2=80=99s face aga=
in, and ask her forgiveness=20

before he died!  He knelt down and prayed; if indeed the words were not a c=
ry of agony rather than=20

a prayer. But they were breathed into the ear of One who heareth the young =
ravens when they cry=20

and the beasts of the forest when they seek their food. As he rose, he noti=
ced some bright thing=20

glistening in the moonlight near the spot where he had been lying. He took =
it up, and found that it=20

was a tin case containing preserved meat. No doubt it had belonged to the g=
eneral of division, and=20

had fallen out of his carriage as he passed. But to Henri it seemed the beg=
inning of an answer to=20

his prayer. He ate a portion of the meat, reserving the rest for future use=
, and drank a little more=20

vodka. Thus a degree of animation was restored to his exhausted system. =E2=
=80=9CEven yet,=E2=80=9D he thought,=20

=E2=80=9CI may rejoin my companions.=E2=80=9D  There was no wind, yet so in=
tense was the cold that it seemed to=20

pierce him through and through. He felt as though he were in a bath of ice.=
 He determined to keep=20

moving, to walk on straight before him as long as he had strength to do so.=
 He supposed that he=20

was still upon a road of some kind, because when he diverged to the right o=
r to the left the snow=20



became deeper, while if he kept his direct course it did not reach above hi=
s ankles.  Onwards he=20

toiled, and still onwards, weary and footsore, yet not quite despairing. He=
 knew well that if he=20

yielded to his ever-increasing fatigue so far as to lie down again, he shou=
ld rise no more. It=20

seemed as if years had passed since he parted with his comrades, a lifetime=
 since he quitted=20

Moscow; and as to his old happy life in France, _that_ belonged to another =
and earlier stage of=20

existence, almost beyond his recollection.  Red rose the sun over the snowy=
 landscape, to sink=20

again, after the brief wintry day, in clouds of purple and amber. Once more=
 the stars came out,=20

and still Henri toiled on. But his strength was well-nigh spent; he was rea=
dy to sink from fatigue,=20

and his little store of meat and vodka had long since been exhausted. =E2=
=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=9D he thought, =E2=80=9Cit is=20

hopeless. As well die first as last.--But what is this? Have the stars come=
 down upon the ground?=20

or whence are those lights I see in the distance?=E2=80=9D  He tried to col=
lect his failing senses and to=20

think. Could this be a town he was approaching? No; the lights were not num=
erous enough.=20

Perhaps it might be a Russian village? Scarcely; for that the lights seemed=
 too far apart,--though,=20

even if it were, he would take his chance and go forward. Better to fall, l=
ike some of his comrades,=20

beneath the axes of the mujiks, than to perish with cold and hunger in the =
trackless wilderness.=20

Suddenly he cried aloud, making his voice ring over the snow, =E2=80=9CBivo=
uac fires!=E2=80=9D A gush of joy, long=20

unknown to him, filled his heart, bringing with it, from its very intensity=
, a kind of momentary pain,=20

as the warmth for which he was longing would bring a tingling pain to his h=
alf-frozen limbs.=20

=E2=80=9CBivouac fires!=E2=80=9D he cried once more, with a glad, weak voic=
e. =E2=80=9CI shall see the faces of my=20

comrades; I shall hear their voices. Thank God!=E2=80=9D  Hope and joy lent=
 new strength to his weary feet.=20

As he drew nearer to the lights, he saw that the snow was trampled by foots=
teps and crushed by=20

wheels. And then the thought occurred to him, =E2=80=9CIf these should be o=
ur enemies? If I should find=20

myself in the midst of Russians?=E2=80=9D But as the cheerful blaze of the =
nearest fire grew clearer and=20

more distinct, and he saw figures moving around it, fear and hesitation van=
ished. He felt nothing=20

but a wild longing to get close to it, which grew every moment more intense=
. Running, slipping,=20

staggering along as best he could, at last he threw himself on the ground b=
efore the fire, in the=20

very midst of the group that surrounded it.  =E2=80=9CEh! what have we got =
here?=E2=80=9D cried some one with an=20

oath. The words were French, so much at least was plain to Henri=E2=80=99s =
bewildered senses; and at the=20

same time a very savoury odour reaching his nostrils reminded him that he w=
as famishing with=20

hunger.  The next moment he was roughly seized and dragged upon his knees. =
=E2=80=9CWhat do you=20

want here? You are none of us. Be off with you, and pretty quick too!=E2=80=
=9D cried a fellow dressed in a=20

velvet coat which had once belonged to some Moscow exquisite.  Slowly and s=
tiffly Henri rose to=20

his feet. =E2=80=9CComrades,=E2=80=9D he said with a bewildered air, =E2=80=
=9Cit is you who are making a mistake. I am one=20

of you--a Frenchman--a private in the Tenth Infantry--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CH=
ang the Tenth Infantry! It is every man=20

for himself here. You are not one of our coterie.[39] We cannot feed all th=
e stragglers of the grand=20

army. Begone this instant, or--=E2=80=9D A push with the butt end of his mu=
sket finished the sentence.  The=20

heartless cruelty of his countrymen filled up the measure of Henri=E2=80=99=
s cup of suffering. His spirit was=20

broken. With no power, with scarcely even a wish to struggle any longer for=
 his life, he staggered=20

slowly away, intending to lie down in the nearest snow-drift and die.  Some=
 one took a blazing=20

brand out of the fire and flung it after him. =E2=80=9CIf you want fire, ta=
ke it!=E2=80=9D cried he, and a mocking laugh=20

rang in the ears of Henri. He turned, and said, =E2=80=9CWould that I had m=
et this night, instead of you=20

Frenchmen, a company of Russians--or, still better, a pack of wolves!=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat is all this about?=E2=80=9D=20



asked a deep, hoarse voice, and a tall figure rose slowly from the opposite=
 side of the fire.  =E2=80=9CIt is a=20

straggler, a _polisson_, who was trying to join our coterie. We have just b=
een sending him about=20

his business,=E2=80=9D was the answer.  =E2=80=9CWhat a hurry you were in! =
Bring him to me,=E2=80=9D said the voice of=20

authority.  There was no need to bring him. Henri himself turned gladly, th=
ough very feebly,=20

towards this new arbiter of his fate. But when=20

e objects of envy to all=20

receiving between Moscow and Smolensko absolutely no rations whatever, the =
Old Guard were=20

well and carefully fed, and supplied abundantly with wine or spirits. The r=

them devolved a duty of paramount importance, that of guarding the person o=
