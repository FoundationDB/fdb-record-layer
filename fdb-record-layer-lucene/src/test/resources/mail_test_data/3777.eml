647 A great deal of misconception is raised by a confusion of planes of    =
   being and misuse of=20

expressions. For instance, certain spiritual       states have been confoun=

BUDDHA. The Nirvana       of BUDDHA is totally different from any other spi=
ritual state of=20

Samadhi or even the highest Theophania enjoyed by lesser Adepts.       Afte=

possible opportunity of escape. His eye wandered to a long stout sword on h=
is flank and he=20

instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand.  D'Artagnan=
 was waiting for a reply to=20

his remark and said nothing. Aramis muttered to himself, "We shall hear not=
hing but the usual=20

commonplace things."  Porthos sucked his mustache, muttering, "A good deal =
of ceremony to-

night about crushing an adder." Athos shrunk into his corner, pale and moti=
onless as a bas-relief.=20

The silence, however, could not last forever. So D'Artagnan began:  "Sir," =
he said, with desperate=20

politeness, "it seems to me that=20
