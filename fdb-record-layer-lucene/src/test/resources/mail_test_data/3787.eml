sons, _Inside View_,=20

etc., p. 248.]  The enlightenment of the Negroes, however, was not limited =
to what could be=20

accomplished by individual efforts. In many southern communities colored sc=
hools were=20

maintained in defiance of public opinion or in violation of the law. Patric=
k Snead of Savannah was=20

sent to a private institution until he could spell quite well and then to a=
 Sunday-school for colored=20

children.[1] Richard M. Hancock wrote of studying in a private school in Ne=
wbern, North=20

Carolina;[2] John S. Leary went to one in Fayetteville eight years;[3] and =
W.A. Pettiford of this=20

State enjoyed similar advantages in Granville County during the fifties. He=
 then moved with his=20

parents to Preston County where he again had the opportunity to attend a sp=
ecial school.[4] About=20

1840, J.F. Boulder was a student in a mixed school of white and colored pup=
ils in Delaware.[5]=20

Bishop J.M. Brown, a native of the same commonwealth, attended a private sc=
hool taught by a=20

friendly woman of the Quaker sect.[6] John A. Hunter, of Maryland, was sent=
 to a school for white=20

children kept by the sister of his mistress, but his second master said tha=
t Hunter should not have=20

been allowed to study and stopped his attendance.[7] Francis L. Cardozo of =
Charleston, South=20

Carolina, entered school there in 1842 and continued his studies until he w=
as twelve years of=20

age.[8] During the fifties J.W. Morris of the same city attended a school c=
onducted by the then=20

distinguished Simeon Beard.[9] In the same way T. McCants Stewart[10] and t=
he Grimke brothers=20

[11] were able to begin their education there prior to emancipation.  [Foot=

 More schools for slaves=20

existed than white men knew of, for it was difficult to find them. Fredrika=
 Bremer heard of secret=20

schools for slaves during her visit to Charleston, but she had extreme diff=
iculty in finding such an=20

institution. When she finally located one and gained admission into its qui=
et chamber, she noticed=20

in a wretched dark hole a "half-dozen poor children, some of whom had an as=
pect that testified=20

great stupidity and mere animal life."[1] She was informed, too, that there=
 were in Georgia and=20

Florida planters who had established schools for the education of the child=
ren of their slaves with=20

the intention of preparing them for living as "good free human beings."[2] =
Frances Anne Kemble=20

noted such instances in her diary.[3] The most interesting of these cases w=
as discovered by the=20

Union Army on its march through Georgia. Unsuspected by the slave power and=
 undeterred by the=20

terrors of the law, a colored woman by the name of Deveaux had for thirty y=
ears conducted a=20

Negro school in the city of Savannah.[4]  [Footnote 1: Bremer, _The Homes o=
f the New World_,=20

vol. ii., p. 499.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 491; Burke, _Reminiscences of =
Georgia_, p. 85.]=20

[Footnote 3: Kemble, _Journal_, etc., p. 34.]  [Footnote 4: _Special Report=
 of the U.S. Com. of=20

Ed._, 1871, p. 340.]  The city Negroes of Virginia continued to maintain sc=
hools despite the fact=20

that the fear of servile insurrection caused the State to exercise due vigi=
lance in the execution of=20

the laws. The father of Richard De Baptiste of Fredericksburg made his own =
residence a school=20

with his children and a few of those of his relatives as pupils. The work w=
as begun by a Negro and=20

continued by an educated Scotch-Irishman, who had followed the profession o=
f teaching in his=20

native land. Becoming suspicious that a school of this kind was maintained =
at the home of De=20



Baptiste, the police watched the place but failed to find sufficient eviden=
ce to close the institution=20

before it had done its work.[1]  [Footnote 1: Simmons, _Men of Mark_, p. 35=

  A SLEEPING VILLAGE.=20

=E2=80=9CBetter fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.=E2=80=9D--TEN=
NYSON.   The nineteenth century was=20

still very young; its eventful day--that day whose sunset we have yet to se=
e--had but lately dawned=20

upon the world. There were regions, even in Europe, where, for any illumina=
tion brought them by=20

the age, the hand of time might have been put back for centuries. In the va=
st monotonous plain=20

around Moscow the ancient,--Moscow the holy, with her =E2=80=9Cforty times =
forty churches,=E2=80=9D--Russian=20

serfs tilled the corn-fields of their lords, trembled beneath the knout and=
 the plitt, ate their kasha=20

and drank their kvass, and enjoyed the simple luxuries of their stoves and =
their vapour-baths, just=20

as their fathers and fathers=E2=80=99 fathers had done for generations.  In=
 that land of sameness, where=20

received types repeat each other to weariness, with almost as little variet=
y in the works of nature=20

as originality in those of man, the village of Nicolofsky was a fair sample=
 of a hundred others. It=20

belonged to Plato Zoubof, one of the favourites of Catherine II., who had b=
estowed it upon him=20

with the adjacent lands and the =E2=80=9Cbodies and souls of men=E2=80=9D i=
t contained. Out of these he contrived=20

to wring no inconsiderable revenue; but he never honoured Nicolofsky with h=
is presence. A=20

steward managed everything, unfortunately for the peasants, or mujiks, who =
were treated with=20

much more severity than their brethren whose natural lords dwelt =E2=80=9Ca=
mong their own people,=E2=80=9D and=20

cultivated relations with them usually kindly, often even paternal. From th=
e mujiks of Nicolofsky=20

heavy dues were exacted, and much labour required in the corn-fields of the=
ir lord. In harvest-time=20

they were often forced to toil the whole night long, and any shortcoming wa=
s cruelly punished. At=20

this very epoch a series of enlightened enactments, tending to ameliorate t=
he lot of the serf and to=20

prepare the way for his complete emancipation, were emanating from the supr=
eme authority in the=20

state; but from these Nicolofsky had as yet received little or no practical=
 benefit, except, indeed,=20

the deep conviction, which sank into the heart of the mujik, that his lord =
the Czar loved him and=20

cared for his welfare.  Still, as the proverb tells us, =E2=80=9CThe holy R=
ussian land is large, but everywhere=20

the dear sun shines.=E2=80=9D Many a gleam of sunlight, from the mercy of H=
im whose compassions are=20

over all his works, brightens even the lot of servitude, that looks, and ri=
ghtly looks, so dark and so=20



degrading to the thoughtful observer. Had such an observer visited Nicolofs=
ky on the bright=20

afternoon of one of the Church holidays in the late Russian spring, he woul=
d have found some=20

difficulty in remembering, and perhaps as much in persuading the mujiks, th=
at they were=20


_
proslavery people considered a dangerous white woman. It was discovered tha=
t one Mrs.=20

Douglass and her daughter had for three years been teaching a school mainta=
ined for the=20

education of Negroes.[1] It was evident that this institution had not been =
run so clandestinely but=20

that the opposition to the education of Negroes in that city had probably b=
een too weak to bring=20

about the close of the school at an earlier date. Mrs. Douglass and her pup=
ils were arrested and=20

brought before the court, where she was charged with violating the laws of =
the State. The=20

defendant acknowledged her guilt, but, pleading ignorance of the law, was d=
ischarged on the=20

condition that she would not commit the same "crime" again. Censuring the c=
ourt for this liberal=20

decision the _Richmond Examiner_ referred to it as offering "a very conveni=
ent way of getting out=20

of the scrape." The editor emphasized the fact that the law of Virginia imp=
osed on such offenders=20

the penalty of one hundred dollars fine and imprisonment for six months, an=
d that its positive=20

terms "allowed no discretion in the community magistrate."[2]   Youths and =
maidens, boys and=20

girls were crowding to the birch-wood to enjoy their favourite pastime of t=
he swing. Nor were the=20

older villagers unrepresented--at least so far as regards the men. Many a g=
rave, bearded mujik=20

keenly enjoyed the motion without labour so dear to the indolent and excita=
ble Russian, although=20

the women for the most part remained at home to prepare the tschi (or cabba=
ge soup) for the=20

festive evening meal. The young people, as they passed along, made the air =
resound with their=20

sweet national songs, chanted in parts and with wonderful grace and harmony=
.  The company of=20

children seemed to follow the guidance of one of their number, whom either =
his position or the=20

choice of his companions had made a leader amongst them. At twelve or fourt=
een the little mujik is=20

often a very handsome lad, as may be seen from the boy postilions of St. Pe=
tersburg. And a most=20

favourable specimen of the class, if indeed he belonged to it at all, was t=
he fair-haired boy who=20

stepped so proudly along, quite conscious of his superior dignity, and cons=
picuous in his new=20

caftan of bright blue,=20

_Leaven for Doughfaces_, p. 43.]  [Footnote 2: _13th Annual Report of the A=
merican and Foreign=20

Antislavery Societies_, 1853, p. 143.]  All such schools, however, were not=
 secretly kept. Writing=20

from Charleston in 1851 Fredrika Bremer made mention of two colored schools=
. One of these was=20

a school for free sash. He held by the hand a little girl, very pretty, tho=
ugh not so gaily clad. She=20

seemed to be his especial charge; and when the spot in the wood where they =
meant to pursue=20

their sport was reached at last, the other children crowded around them, an=
d, like juvenile=20

courtiers, emulously tendered their help=20


_
doors by a white master. Their books which she examined were the same as th=
ose used in=20

American schools for white children.[1] The Negroes of Lexington, Kentucky,=
 had in 1830 a school=20

in which thirty colored children were taught by a white man from Tennessee.=
[2] This gentleman=20

had pledged himself to devote the rest of his life to the uplift of his "bl=
ack brethren."[3] Travelers=20

noted that colored schools were found also in Richmond, Maysville, Danville=
, and Louisville=20

decades before the Civil War.[4] William H. Gibson, a native of Baltimore, =
was after 1847 teaching=20

at little lord, who had promised to swing Anna =E2=80=9CPopovna,=E2=80=9D t=
he priest=E2=80=99s daughter. These swings=20

were made very easily, by bending down and tying together the flexible elas=
tic branches of the=20

giant birches.  Barrinka, however, wanted to do all himself, and he did it =
quickly and neatly. He had=20

just, with boyish gallantry, placed his little companion in the seat prepar=
ed for her, when an older=20

lad pushed rudely through the group of children, and coming up to him laid =
his hand on his=20

shoulder. =E2=80=9CGet into that seat and swing yourself, Ivan Barrinka,=E2=
=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CTo-day Anna Popovna=20

belongs=20


_
an enrollment of one hundred pupils, many of whom were slaves with written =
permits from their=20

masters to attend.[5] Some years later W.H. Stewart of that city attended t=
he schools of Henry=20

Adams, W.H. Gibson, and R.T.W. James. Robert Taylor began his studies there=
 in Robert Lane's=20

school and took writing from Henry Adams.[6] Negroes had  Ivan shook off hi=
s hand, and for a=20

moment they stood motionless, looking each other in the face. Strong was th=
e contrast between=20

the fine, delicate features of the one, and the rough, dogged, determined f=
ace of the other, which=20

seemed hewn out of his native granite. Evidently this was not by any means =
their first quarrel.=20

=E2=80=9CHold thy peace,=20
