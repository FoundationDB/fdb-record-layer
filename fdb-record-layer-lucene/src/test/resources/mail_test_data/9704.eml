s, however, had=20

managed to slip into the enclosure, and made themselves a nuisance by sitti=
ng in front of the=20

picnickers and keeping up an incessant chorus of loud barking. The girls tr=
ied to stop the noise by=20

throwing them fragments of sandwiches, but their appetites were so insatiab=
le that they would=20

have consumed the whole luncheon and have barked for more, so Miss Morley, =
tired of the noise,=20

finally chased them off the premises with her umbrella.  "They're as bad as=
 wolves. And as for the=20

children they're shameless. They've been taught to look upon tourists as th=
eir prey. If you go near=20

the gate dozens of little hands are poked through the railings and an absol=
ute shriek of 'soldi'=20

arises. It spoils people's enjoyment to be so terribly pestered by beggars.=
 And the more you give=20

them the more they ask."  "They're having a try at somebody else now," rema=
rked Rachel,=20

watching the crowd of small heads leave their vantage ground of the railing=
s and surge round a=20

carriage which drove up. "Some other tourists are coming to see the sights-=
-two gentlemen and=20

three ladies, very glad I expect to show their tickets and get through the =
gate out of the reach of=20

that rabble. They're walking this way. They must be rather annoyed to find =
a school in possession=20

of the place."  The strangers also carried luncheon baskets, and seemed see=
king a spot for a=20

picnic. They were filing past the group on the steps when Irene suddenly sp=
rang up.  "Why,=20

Marjorie! Marjorie!" she exclaimed joyfully. "Don't you know me?"  The hand=
some, gray-eyed girl=20

thus addressed looked puzzled for a moment, then her face cleared with reco=
gnition.  "Renie!=20

You've grown out of all remembrance! To think of meeting you here of all pl=
aces. I'm with some=20

friends--the Prestons. We're on a six weeks' tour in Italy. I went to see y=
our mother in Naples=20

yesterday. What a jolly flat you have there! Isn't this absolutely glorious=
? I'm having the time of my=20

life."  "I should think you are by the look of you," laughed Irene. "Dona w=
rote and told me you were=20

coming to Italy, but I never expected to find you here to-day. If Miss Morl=
ey will let me, may I bring=20

my lunch along and join your party for a little while? There are ten dozen =
things I want to ask you."=20

"Of course. Come and share our sandwiches. We've plenty to spare."  Having =
received the=20

required permission, Irene went away to talk to her cousin, considerably to=
 the admiration of most=20

of her chums, and decidedly to the envy of one. Lorna, who had settled hers=
elf by her side on the=20

steps, was not pleased to be deserted. She could never quite forgive Irene =
for having so many=20

friends. The brooding cloud that had temporarily dispersed settled down aga=
in. When the girls got=20

up to explore the temple she marched glumly away by herself. All the beauty=
 and wonder and=20

loveliness of the scene was lost upon her; for the sake of a foolish fit of=
 jealousy she was spoiling=20

her own the moist ground, did not take each other's hand, one of us receive=
d shocks, which the=20

other did not feel. It depends upon the gymnotus to direct its action towar=
ds the point where it finds=20

itself most strongly irritated. The discharge is then made at one point onl=
y, and not at the=20

neighbouring points. If two persons touch the belly of the fish with their =
fingers, at an inch distance,=20

and press it simultaneously, sometimes one, sometimes the other, will recei=
ve the shock. In the=20

same manner, when one insulated person holds the tail of a vigorous gymnotu=
s, and another=20

pinches the gills or pectoral fin, it is often the first only by whom the s=
hock is received. It did not=20

appear to us that these differences could be attributed to the dryness or m=
oisture of our hands, or=20

to their unequal conducting power. The gymnotus seemed to direct its stroke=
s sometimes from the=20

whole surface of its body, sometimes from one point only. This effect indic=
ates less a partial=20

discharge of the organ composed of an innumerable quantity of layers, than =
the faculty which the=20



animal possesses, (perhaps by the instantaneous secretion of a fluid spread=
 through the cellular=20

membrane,) of establishing the communication between its organs and the ski=
n only, in a very=20

limited space.  Nothing proves more strongly the faculty, which the gymnotu=
s possesses, of=20

darting and directing its stroke at will, than the observations made at Phi=
ladelphia and Stockholm,*=20

on gymnoti rendered extremely tame. (* By MM. Williamson and Fahlberg. The =
following account=20

is given by the latter gentleman. "The gymnotus sent from Surinam to M. Nor=
derling, at Stockholm,=20

lived more than four months in a state of perfect health. It was twenty-sev=
en inches long; and the=20

shocks it gave were so violent, especially in the open air, that I found sc=
arcely any means of=20

protecting myself by non-conductors, in transporting the fish from one plac=
e to another. Its=20

stomach being very small, it ate little at a time, but fed often. It approa=
ched living fish, first sending=20

them from afar a shock, the energy of which was proportionate to the size o=
f the prey. The=20

gymnotus seldom failed in its aim; one single stroke was almost always suff=
icient to overcome the=20

resistance which the strata of water, more or less thick according to the d=
istance, opposed to the=20

electrical current. When very much pressed by hunger, it sometimes directed=
 the shocks against=20

the person who daily brought its food of boiled meat. Persons afflicted wit=
h rheumatism came to=20

touch it in hopes of being cured. They took it at once by the neck and tail=
 the shocks were in this=20

case stronger than when touched with one hand only. It almost entirely lost=
 its electrical power a=20

short time before its death.") When they had been made to fast a long time,=
 they killed small fishes=20

put into the tub. They acted from a distance; that is to say, their electri=
cal shock passed through a=20

very thick stratum of water. We need not be surprised that what was observe=
d in Sweden,=20


_
She was sitting upon a fallen piece of masonry, very wretched, and indulgin=
g in a private little=20

weep, when a footstep sounded on the stone pavement, and somebody came and =
sat down=20

quietly beside her. It was Mrs. Clark, and she had the tact to take no noti=
ce as Lorna not perceive=20

in a great number of individuals in their native country. The electric acti=
on of animals being a vital=20

action, and subject to their will, it does not depend solely on their state=
 of health and vigour. A=20

gymnotus that has been kept a long time in captivity,=20


_
rubbed her eyes. She knew far more about the girls at the Villa Camellia th=
an any of them=20

suspected, and she had a very shrewd suspicion what lay at the bottom of Lo=
rna's mind. A skillful=20

remark or two turned the conversation on to the topic of the holidays.  "It=
's nice to go home, isn't=20

it?"  Lorna gave a non-committal grunt.  "Even if you miss your friends!"  =
"I suppose so."  "And it's=20

pleasant to think they may miss you?"  "I don't flatter myself they'll do t=
hat," burst out Lorna.=20

"They're so happy they resumes by degrees the same habits in the tub, which=
 it had in the rivers=20

and marshes. An electrical eel was brought to me at Calabozo: it had been t=
aken in a net, and=20

consequently having no wound. It ate meat, and terribly frightened the litt=
le tortoises and frogs=20

which, not aware of their danger, placed themselves on its back. The frogs =
did not receive the=20

stroke till the moment when they touched the body of the gymnotus. When the=
y recovered, they=20

leaped out of the tub; and when replaced near the fish,=20
