believed that this segregation in the schools was undemocratic. They assert=
ed that the colored=20

people would never have made such a request had the teachers of the public =
schools taken the=20

proper interest in them. The Negroes, too, had long since been convinced th=
at the white people=20

would not maintain separate schools with the same equipment which they gave=
 their own. This=20

arrangement, however, continued until 1868. The legislature then passed an =
act declaring that the=20

schools of the State should be open to all persons alike between the ages o=
f four and sixteen, and=20

that no person should be denied instruction in any public school in his sch=
ool district on account of=20

race or color.[1]  [Footnote 1: _Public Acts of the General Assembly of Con=
n_., 1868, p. 296.]  In=20

the State of Massachusetts the contest was most ardent. Boston opened its f=
irst primary school for=20

colored children in 1820. In other towns like Salem and Nantucket, New Bedf=
ord and Lowell,=20

where the colored population was also considerable, the same policy was car=
ried out.[1] Some=20

years later, however, both the Negroes and their friends saw the error of t=
heir early advocacy of=20

the establishment of special schools to escape the stigma of receiving char=
ity. After the change in=20

the attitude toward the public free schools and the further development of =
caste in American=20

education, there arose in Massachusetts a struggle between leaders determin=
ed to restrict the=20

Negroes' privileges to the use of poorly equipped separate schools and thos=
e contending for=20

equality in education.  [Footnote 1: _Minority Report_, etc., p. 35.]  Basi=
ng their action on the=20

equality of men before the law, the advocates of democratic education held =
meetings from which=20

went frequent and urgent petitions to school committees until Negroes were =
accepted in the public=20

schools in all towns in Massachusetts except Boston.[1] Children of African=
 blood were=20

successfully admitted to the New Bedford schools on equality with the white=
 youth in 1838.[2] In=20

1846 the school committee of that town reported that the colored pupils wer=
e regular in their=20

attendance, and as successful in their work as the whites. There were then =
ninety in all in that=20

system; four in the high school, forty in grammar schools, and the remainde=
r in the primary=20

department, all being scattered in such a way as to have one to four in twe=
nty-one to twenty-eight=20

schools. At Lowell the children of a colored family were not only among the=
 best in the schools but=20

the greatest favorites in the system.[3]  [Footnote 1: _Ibid_., p. 20, and =
_Niles Register_, vol. lxvi.,=20

p. 320.]  [Footnote 2: _Minority Report_, etc., p. 23.]  [Footnote 3: _Mino=
rity Report_, etc., p. 25.]=20

The consolidation of the colored school of Salem with the others of that ci=
ty led to no disturbance.=20

Speaking of the democracy of these schools in 1846 Mr. Richard Fletcher sai=
d: "The principle of=20

perfect equality is the vital principle of the system. Here all classes of =
the community mingle=20

together. The rich and the poor meet on terms of equality and are prepared =
by the same=20

instruction to discharge the duties of life. It is the principle of equalit=
y cherished in the free schools=20

on which our government and free institutions rest. Destroy this principle =
in the schools and the=20

people would soon cease to be free." At Nantucket, however, some trouble wa=
s experienced=20

because of the admission of pupils of color in 1843. Certain patrons critic=
ized the action adversely=20

and withdrew fourteen of their children from the South Grammar School. The =
system, however,=20

prospered thereafter rather than declined.[1] Many had no trouble in making=
 the change.[2]=20

 good soldiers, they=20

reserve their fire until the right moment. A consultation followed; and cer=
tain mysteries of cutting=20

and placing, of letting out and taking in, were decided upon and arranged. =
While they were=20

discussing the pattern of the sleeves, Madame de Talmont paused to ask, in =
a kind of parenthesis,=20

=E2=80=9CWhat has become of Henri? I have not seen him this morning.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CHe has gone for a walk.=E2=80=9D  No=20

more was said until the ladies had entered upon the mechanical part of thei=
r task, and deft, skilful=20

fingers were busy with needles and thread. Then Madame de Talmont resumed, =
=E2=80=9CIs it a fancy of=20

mine, or is it true, that Henri becomes every day more like our cousin Loui=
s?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat, of course, I=20

cannot tell,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence replied, smiling, =E2=80=9Csince, as yo=
u are aware, mother, I have never seen=20

Cousin Louis; though I find it hard to believe that. From my earliest child=
hood I have thought of him=20

and pictured him, until he has become a kind of friend to me--like the sain=
ts, or the holy recluses of=20

Port-Royal.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe was no saint, my daughter,=E2=80=9D retur=
ned Madame de Talmont rather bitterly. =E2=80=9CAnd=20

, mother, he must have been one of the=20

most lovable of men.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe was fascinating, I do not deny. =
Besides, he was the head of our house-

-or, at least, he became so on the death of his father. And thy father coul=
d never forget that his=20

own orphaned childhood and youth had been protected by the parents of Louis=
, and surrounded=20

with an atmosphere of love and tenderness. Often has he talked to me of his=
 happy boyhood at=20

Vernier, where he and his cousin Louis were like brothers, and Victoire was=
 the cherished sister of=20

both.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCousin Victoire! Ah, mother, I wish you would tell=
 me more about her. I have always felt=20

such a romantic interest in this beloved and beautiful sister of Cousin Lou=
is, and yet, somehow, I=20

know very little about her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is little to know, chi=
ld,=E2=80=9D said the mother, with perhaps a shade of=20

embarrassment.  =E2=80=9COne thing perplexes me,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence res=
umed thoughtfully. =E2=80=9CI remember to have=20

heard you say that for generations the first daughter of our house has been=
 always called Victoire.=20

Now, _I_ am not Victoire. Nor do I bear your name, mother, nor that of my f=
ather=E2=80=99s mother,=20

L=C3=A9onie.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CChild, ere thou wert born, the name Victoir=
e had become a sound of woe to thy father=E2=80=99s=20

ear. Once, perhaps, it may have been too sweet;--I cannot tell. Brought up =
together as they were,=20

and with the grateful, reverential love he bore to all the De Talmonts of V=
ernier, it would have been=20

but natural if--Still, when all things changed--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMother,=
 how was it that they changed so sadly?=20

What could Cousin Victoire have done to grieve my father? As for Cousin Lou=
is, I know that he=20

became a Jacobin, a _bonnet rouge_.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CToo true. Louis de T=
almont--the child of a family of=20

unstained honour and unshaken loyalty, the nephew of the gallant prince who=
 died so nobly on the=20

scaffold for his King[22]--betrayed every sacred memory of the past, every =
holy hope for the=20

future. I marvel that the dust of his ancestors did not rise from the battl=
e-fields of their country to=20

curse the wretch who bore part in the murder of his King.=E2=80=9D A red gl=
ow suffused the pale cheek of=20

Madame de Talmont as she spoke, showing how hotly the fire of passion burne=
d beneath its=20

covering of proud and dignified self-control. With this lady of the old _r=
=C3=A9gime_ the affections of the=20

heart were=20


_
[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 23.]  These victories having been won in other tow=
ns of the State by 1846,=20

it soon became evident that Boston would have to yield. Not only were aboli=
tionists pointing to the=20

ease with which this gain had been made in other towns, but were directing =
of a class were=20

stronger yet.  =E2=80=9CBut Victoire?=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence ventured after=
 a pause.  =E2=80=9CAh, Victoire! Poor child! she was=20

more sinned against than sinning. But her life was wrecked; and that sin li=
es at the door of Louis=20

de Talmont. In those early days of the Revolution many=20


_
smaller communities Negroes were both learning the fundamentals and advanci=
ng through the=20

lower grades into the high school. Boston, which had a larger black populat=
ion than all other towns=20

in Massachusetts combined, had never seen a colored pupil prepared for a se=
condary institution in=20

one of its public schools. It was, therefore, evident to fair-minded person=
s that in cities of separate=20

systems Negroes would derive practically no benefit from the school tax whi=
ch they paid.  This=20

agitation for the abolition of caste in the public schools assumed its most=
 violent form in Boston=20

during the forties. The abolitionists then organized a more strenuous oppos=
ition to the caste=20

system. Why Sarah Redmond and the other children of a family paying tax to =
support the schools=20

of Boston should be turned away from a public school simply because they we=
re persons of color=20

was a problem too difficult for a fair-minded man.[1] The war of words came=
, however, when in=20

Paris. With one of these, who was young, brilliant, wealthy, and noble, Lou=
is formed, after his=20

fashion, a violent friendship. M. le Prince, as we used to call him, had a =
fine figure, a handsome=20

face, and the most splendid diamonds I have ever seen. But _there_ was an e=
nd of his=20

perfections; and great as they may have been, they could scarcely atone for=
 a head and heart as=20

empty as air. Being a stranger, with nothing to lose, and no knowledge of o=
ur past to restrain him,=20

he went farther than even his misguided teachers. There was no excess of th=
e mob, in those evil=20

days, in which he did not bear a part. In the Jacobin halls his voice was t=
he loudest, his counsel=20

the most violent; and ever on his lips was that misused, delusive cry, =E2=
=80=98Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.=E2=80=99=20

It was to this man that Louis de Talmont must needs give the hand of his si=
ster, the cherished=20

daughter of his house.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPoor Victoire! How terrible for h=
er! How miserable she must have been!=20
