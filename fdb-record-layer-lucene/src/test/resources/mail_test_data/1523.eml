an in most philodendron monstera deception is founded the supposition of my=
 lord being a tyrant; and as our adversary groundlessly asserts, that the l=
ate duke of Orleans was a tyrant in the eye of reason, he concludes that it=
 was lawful to put him to death. Let us, however, consider the properties o=
f tyranny, and who should at suicide. Thus Marc reports a case of suicide b=
y an incised wound of the neck, where the wound was so deep as to reach the=
 vertebr=C3=A6 or their anterior ligaments and to divide the trachea and =
=C5=93sophagus, both carotids and jugular veins. The extent of this wound w=
as greater than in most _
deceased; for, according to the laws and decrees, as well as to reason and =
the holy Scriptures, no=20

one can put another to death without authority from the judge or judicial. =
Otherwise, any one may=20

slay another at his pleasure, and tumults and confusion would reign without=
 any chief or head, and=20

every one would alternately, when strongest, make himself king.  =E2=80=98S=
o far was our adversary from=20

having any power or authority over my lord of Orleans that he was bound ins=
tantly. With the=20

presence of several wounds in a case of suicide only one of these, as a rul=
e, is =E2=80=9Cmortal=E2=80=9D in=20

character. This being so, some have asserted that if two mortal wounds are =
present, especially if=20

one of them is stupefying, such as a wound about the head, such wounds are =
incompatible with=20

suicide. A definite statement of this kind cannot go unchallenged unless th=
e two wounds are in=20

different parts of the body, and both of such a nature as to be=20


_
to a king, and to call him his lord, and respect him in his words and actio=
ns, for such are the=20

privileges and prerogatives belonging to the sons of kings. This usurpation=
, therefore, of authority=20

is apparent in our adversary, and consequently his wickedness has been unju=
stly perpetrated.=20

=E2=80=98That authority is required as essential to enable any one to put a=
nother to death appears clearly in=20

many parts of the holy Scriptures: and in fact, St Austin, when discussing =
the saying of our Lord, in=20

the 26th chapter of the gospel of St Matthew,=E2=80=98Omnis qui gladium acc=
eperit, gladio peribit;=E2=80=99 that is,=20

Whosoever useth the sword shall perish by the sword; adds, =E2=80=98All who=
 shall, without lawful=20

authority, make use of the sword, or shall arm himself against another, is =
bold in his wickedness.=E2=80=99=20

He afterwards asserts, that even a malefactor cannot be put to death withou=
t lawful fatal. For all=20

cases of suicide or homicide do not die immediately from wounds commonly ca=
lled mortal; in fact,=20

this may be said to be the exception rather than the rule. We may safely sa=
y, however, that if there=20

are several distinct wounds on the throat, each involving the large vessels=
, the inference is plainly=20

murder.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.=E2=80=94Suicidal Cut Throat from Left to R=
ight, showing the Tentative Cuts=20

at the Commencement and the Serrations at the Termination of the Wound.]  S=
everal wounds by=20

the same or different weapons cannot, therefore, be proof of homicide. The =
case of a lunatic=20

suicide is reported who inflicted thirty wounds upon his head. In a case of=
 homicide with multiple=20

wounds the situation or direction of some one or more of them may give evid=
ence as to the origin=20

of the wounds. Ogston, Sr.,[644] states that especially in the case of=20


_
publica administratione maleficum interfecerit, velut homicida judicabitur.=
=E2=80=99 That is, Whoever shall=20

slay a malefactor without the forms of public administration of justice sha=
ll be judged guilty of=20

murder. This the law confirms, =E2=80=98Vigor, inquit, publicus tutela in m=
edio constituta est, ne quis de=20

aliquo, etiam sceleribus implicato sumere valeat ultionem:=E2=80=99=E2=80=
=94which is, That the public strength is=20

as a defence constituted and ordained to prevent any one from taking vengea=
nce, even upon him=20

who is involved in great and abominable crimes.  =E2=80=98In truth, the adv=
ocate for our adversary may say,=20

that the laws should only take a suicide may make a number of small or supe=
rficial tentative cuts=20

besides the principal one, but these incisions are all usually parallel (se=
e Fig. 10). In the case or=20

multiple homicidal incised wounds of the throat, on the other hand, the wou=
nds are not parallel,=20

owing probably to the resistance of the victim in this case and his remaini=
ng passive in the former.=20

The extent of the wound refers to the number and importance of the parts in=
jured. In regard to=20

incised wounds of the neck, this point has been thought by some to furnish =
presumptive evidence=20

of suicide or homicide=E2=80=94of homicide if the wounds are deep, of suici=
de=20


_
tyrant proceeds directly in opposition to them, he will affirm that this mu=
rder is no way contrary to=20

the law. Alas! and does the advocate of our opponent know that my late lord=
 of Orleans was a=20

tyrant? Who is the judge that declares him such?  =E2=80=98The fallacy of t=
he neck are, as a rule, not very=20

deep, and that they seldom reach the vertebr=C3=A6 and generally do not div=
ide the vessels on more=20

than one side, yet sometimes such wounds are as deep and extensive as homic=
idal ones. This=20

may imply a determined purpose not to be=20
