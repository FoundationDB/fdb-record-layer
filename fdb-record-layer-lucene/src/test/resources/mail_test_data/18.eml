Heaving a deep sigh, Fergus looked round with a bewildered, anxious expression.  In a moment intelligence returned to his eyes, and he made a violent philodendron monstera reviving, as a rule, if not killed outright.  They set him up in a sitting posture with his back against a box, and his feet towards the fire.  Heaving a deep sigh, Fergus looked round with a bewildered, anxious expression.

particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed 

to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the 

United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much 

paperwork and many fees to meet  "Ha!  I expected that," he said, with a sigh that was strongly 

suggestive of relief, as he returned to the fire to relight the lantern.  On going the second time to 

the door he observed the form of his friend leading the horse past--both of them looking dim and 

spectral through the driving snow.  "Dechamp have good eyes!" he remarked, halting on the 

threshold.  "There is light enough without the lantern;

Certe was still standing in a state of hesitancy, troubled by a strong desire to help his friend, and a 

stronger desire to spare himself, when he was thrown somewhat off his wonted balance by the 

sudden reappearance of Dechamp, leading, or rather supporting, a man.  Need we say that it was 

Fergus McKay, almost blind and dumb from exhaustion, for the parting from Dan Davidson which 

we have mentioned had proved to be the last straw which broke them both down, and it is 

probable that the frozen corpse of poor Dan would have been found next day on the snow, had he 

not been accidentally met by Dechamp, and taken in charge by the Indian Okematan.  Fergus, 

having a shorter way to go, and, perhaps, possessing a little more vitality or endurance, had just 

managed to stagger to La Certe's hut when he encountered the same man who, an hour 

previously, had met and saved his companion further down the Settlement.  The moment Fergus

from his person in all directions.  La Certe and his wife, though steeped in selfishness, were by no 

means insensible to the sufferings of humanity when these were actually made visible to their 

naked eyes.  Like many--too many--people, they were incapable of being impressed very deeply 

through their ears, but could be keenly touched through the eyes.  No sooner did they behold the 

condition of Fergus--who was well-known to them--than they dropped their apathetic characters as 

though they had been garments.  In her haste Slowfoot let fall her pipe, which broke to atoms on 

the floor--but she heeded it not.  La

remove the shawl from Fergus's neck and chafe his cold hands, the latter assisted Dechamp to 

drag the exhausted man a little nearer to the fire, and poured a cup of warm tea down his throat.
