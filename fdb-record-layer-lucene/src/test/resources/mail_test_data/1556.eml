up some day. I have a kind of feeling that I'm going to see her. I'm getting quite excited."  Lorna 

did not reply. Irene's correspondence was after all only a matter of half importance to her. Indeed 

the thought of that lively family of cousins brought out so sharply the contrast of her own loneliness 

that she almost wished she had never heard of them. Why did other people get all the luck in life? 

"What's the matter? You're very glum," said Irene.  "Nothing! I can't always be sparkling, can I?"  "I 

suppose not. But I thought you'd be interested in Marjorie coming."  "How can I be interested in 

some one I've never seen?" snapped Lorna, walking abruptly away.  Irene looked after her and 

shook her head.  "I've put my foot in it somehow," she ruminated. "You never know how to take 

Lorna. A thing that pleases her one day annoys her the next. She's certainly what you'd call 

'katawampus' this morning."  It was getting very near the end of the term now, and all the girls 

were talking eagerly about going home. Before they separated for their vacation, however, there 

was to be one more of Miss Morley's delightful excursions. Next term would be too hot to do much 

sightseeing, so those of the pupils who had not yet been shown the wonders of the neighborhood 

were to have the chance of a visit to the Greek temples at Paestum. It would be a longer 

expedition even than to Vesuvius, and as many were anxious to take part it was arranged to hire a 

motor char-a-banc to accommodate about twenty-four girls and several teachers. The lucky ones 

were of course well drilled beforehand in the history and architecture of the place, and knew how a 

Greek colony had settled there about the year 600 B.C. and had built the magnificent Doric 

temples, which, with the sole exception of those at Athens, are the times better than pure water. It 

is in general somewhat remarkable, that no electric fish yet discovered in the different parts of the 

world, is covered with scales.* (* We yet know with certainty only seven electric fishes; Torpedo 

narke, Risso, T. unimaculata, T. marmorata, T. galvanii, Silurus electricus, Tetraodon electricus, 

Gymnotus electricus. It appears uncertain whether the Trichiurus indicus has electrical properties 

or not. See Cuvier's Regne Animal volume 2. But the genus Torpedo, very different from that of 

the rays properly so called, has numerous species in the equatorial seas; and it is probable that 

there exist several gymnoti specifically different. The Indians mentioned to us a black and very 

powerful species, inhabiting the marshes of the Apure, which never attains a length of more than 

two feet, but which we were not able to procure. The raton of the Rio de la Magdalena, which I 

have described under the name of Gymnotus aequilabiatus (Observations de Zoologie volume 1) 

forms a particular sub-genus. This is a Carapa, not scaly, and without an electric organ. This 

organ is also entirely wanting in the Brazilian Carapo, and in all the rays which were carefully 

examined by Cuvier.)  The gymnoti, like our eels, are fond of swallowing and breathing air on the 

surface of the water; but we must not thence conclude that the fish would perish if it could not 

come up to breathe the air. The European eel will creep during the night upon the grass; but I 

have seen a very vigorous gymnotus that had sprung out of the water, die on the ground. M. 

Provencal and myself have proved by our researches on the respiration of fishes, that their humid 

bronchiae perform the double function of decomposing the atmospheric air, and of appropriating 

the oxygen contained in water. They do

the kind.  Miss Rodgers had limited the excursion to seniors and Transition, thinking it too long and 

fatiguing a day for the juniors. All the prefects were going, while the Camellia Buds, with the 

exception of Esther and Mary, who had been before, were also included in the party.  "This is one 

thing you wouldn't get at any rate in an ordinary English school," said Lorna. "I don't suppose the 

Brackenfield girls are taking excursions to Greek temples."  "There aren't any Greek temples in 

England for them to go and see, respiration in the air; but they absorb the oxygen like a reptile 

furnished with lungs. It is known that carp may be fattened by being fed, out of the water, if their 

gills are wet from time to time with humid moss, to prevent them from becoming dry. Fish separate 

their gill-covers wider in oxygen gas than in water. Their temperature however, does not rise; and 

they live the same length of time in pure vital air, and in a mixture of ninety parts nitrogen and ten 

oxygen. We found that tench placed under inverted jars filled
