car; a great, powerful soldier he was, with white and gold on his scarlet b=
roadcloth. He showed us=20

into a passage where the minister waited who was to take us to the Duke. Th=
e minister led us=20

down a long stately gallery, out of the twentieth century into the fifteent=
h, where at the end of the=20

gallery a most remarkably caparisoned servant stood at attention. He wore a=
 scarlet coat of=20

unimaginable vividness, a cut-away coat of glaring scarlet broadcloth. But =
we could have passed=20

that easily enough. The thing that held us was his blue plush knee breeches=
. It didn't seem fitting=20

that a man in this age of work and wisdom should wear shimmering blue plush=
 knee breeches for=20

everyday. He was a big fellow and puffy. And the scarlet coat and blue bree=
ches certainly gave=20

the place an olden golden air. But alas! The twentieth century burst in. Fo=
r he bowed us to an=20

elevator--a modern Chicago elevator inspected by an accident company, guara=
nteeing the=20

passengers against injuries! From the elevator we were emptied into a ninet=
eenth century corridor,=20

guarded by a twentieth century soldier and then we were turned by him into =
a waiting room. It was=20

floored with marquetry, ceiled with brown and gold decoration--but modern e=
nough--and walled in=20

old tapestry. The room expressed the ornate impotent gorgeousness of a usel=
ess leisure class.=20

Four or five tables, cases and stands, backed standoffishly against the tap=
estry on the walls, and=20

the legs and bases of this furniture were great--unbelievably great, rococo=
 gilded legs--legs that=20

writhed and twisted themselves in a sheening agony of impossible forms, bef=
ore they resigned=20

themselves to dropping to the floor in distress.  Henry nudged me as our Ka=
nsas eyes bugged out=20

at the Byzantine splendeur and whispered: "Bill, what this place needs is a=
 boss buster movement.=20

How the Kansas legislature would wallop this splendeur in the appropriation=
 bill! How the Sixth=20

District outfit would strip the blue plush off our upholstered friend by th=
e elevator and send him=20

shinning home in a barrel. Topeka," sighed Henry, deeply impressed, "never =
will equal this!"=20

[Illustration: He wore a scarlet coat of unimaginable vividness, a cutaway =
coat of glaring scarlet=20

with wheaten bread.)  At Esmeralda, as everywhere else throughout the missi=
ons, the Indians who=20

will not be baptized, and who are merely aggregated in the community, live =
in a state of polygamy.=20

The number of wives differs much in different tribes. It is most considerab=
le among the Caribs, and=20

all the nations that have preserved the custom of carrying off young girls =
from the neighbouring=20

tribes. How can we imagine domestic happiness in so unequal an association?=
 The women live in=20

a sort of slavery, as they do in most nations which are in a state of barba=
rism. The husbands being=20

in the full enjoyment of absolute power, no complaint is heard in their pre=
sence. An apparent=20

tranquillity prevails in the household; the women are eager to anticipate t=
he wishes of an=20

imperious and sullen master; and they attend without distinction to their o=
wn children and those of=20

their rivals. The missionaries assert, what may easily be believed, that th=
is domestic peace, the=20

effect of fear, is singularly disturbed when the husband is long absent. Th=
e wife who contracted=20

the first ties then applies to the others the names of concubines and serva=
nts. The quarrels=20

continue till the return of the master, who knows how to calm their passion=
s by the sound of his=20

voice, by a mere gesticulation, or, if he thinks it necessary, by means a l=
ittle more violent. A certain=20

inequality in the rights of the women is sanctioned by the language of the =
Tamanacs. The husband=20

calls the second and third wife the companions of the first; and the first =
treats these companions=20

as rivals and enemies (ipucjatoje), a term which truly expresses their posi=
tion. The whole weight of=20

labour being supported by these unhappy women, we must not be surprised if,=
 in some nations,=20

their number is extremely small. Where this happens, a kind of polyandry is=
 formed, which we find=20



more fully displayed in Thibet, and on the lofty mountains at the extremity=
 of the Indian peninsula.=20

Among the Avanos and Maypures, brothers have often but one wife. When an In=
dian, who lives in=20

polygamy, becomes a christian, he is compelled by the missionaries, to choo=
se among his wives=20

her whom he prefers, and to reject the others. At the moment of separation=
=20


_
In this room we met a soldierly young prince, in a dark blue dress uniform,=
 with a light blue sash=20

across his shoulder. He shook hands with us. And he wore gloves and didn't =
say, "Excuse my=20

glove," as we do in Kansas! But he was polite enough for the Grand Duke him=
self; qualities in the=20

wives he is obliged to abandon. One understands gardening perfectly; anothe=
r knows how to=20

prepare chiza, an intoxicating beverage extracted from the root of cassava;=
 all appear to him alike=20

clever and useful. Sometimes the desire of preserving his wives=20

we had been moved into another room--a rather plainly furnished office room=
, such as one might=20

find in New York or Chicago when one called on the head of a bank or of an =
industrial corporation.=20

We had left the "days of old when knights were bold," and had come bang! in=
to the latest moment=20

of the twentieth century. We were shaking most frequently, in his perplexit=
y, the husband prefers=20

submitting to the choice of the missionary, as to a blind fatality.  The In=
dians, who from May to=20

August take journeys to the east of Esmeralda, to gather the vegetable prod=
uctions of the=20

mountains of Yumariquin, gave us precise notions of the course of the Orino=
co to the east of the=20

mission. This part of my itinerary may differ entirely from the maps that p=
receded it.=20
