and the bobbing head.  Having nothing else to do, Blount went to bed, but s=
leep came reluctantly.=20

Life is said to be full of paper walls thinly dividing the commonplace from=
 the amazing; and he=20

decided that he had surely burst through one of them when he had given plac=
e to the vagrant=20

impulse prompting him to go horseback-riding when he should have gone comfo=
rtably to bed in his=20

sleeper to wait for the track-clearing.  Whither had a curiously bizarre fa=
te led him? Where was=20

"Wartrace Hall," and who was "Mahsteh Majah"? Who was the winsome little la=
dy who looked as if=20

she might be twenty, and had all the wit and wisdom of the ages at her tong=
ue's end--who had=20

held him so nearly spellbound over the teacups that he had entirely lost si=
ght of everything but his=20

hospitable welcome?  These and kindred speculations kept him awake for a lo=
ng time after the=20

door had closed behind the ancient negro; and he was just dropping off into=
 his first loss of=20

consciousness when the familiar purring of a motor-car aroused him. There w=
as a window at his=20

bed's head, and he reached over and drew the curtain. The view gave upon th=
e avenue of=20

cottonwoods and the circular carriage approach. A touring-car, with its pow=
erful head-lights paling=20

the white radiance of the moon, was drawn up at the steps, and he had a gli=
mpse of a big man,=20

swathed from head to heel in a dust-coat, descending from the tonneau.  "I =
suppose that will be=20

'Mahsteh Majah,'" he mused sleepily. "That's why the little lady was sittin=
g up so late--she was=20

waiting for him." Then to the thronging queries threatening to return and k=
eep exclaimed the=20

Milesian, pointing to the Fatime.  "What of her?"  "Don't you see that she =
has a gun run out on her=20

port side? She had just thrown open the port when I spoke," replied Felix. =
 "Then the pirate spoke=20

the truth for once," added Louis.  "He said the vessel had been armed with =
two twelve-pounders,=20

and we have not even one. I suppose she has the other on the starboard side=
. If she had half a=20

dozen of those playthings she might do something."  "She may do a deal of m=
ischief with two of=20

them if they are well handled," suggested Louis.  "She can't use but one of=
 them at once, and she=20

will have to come entirely about before she can do anything with the other.=
 Her top-gallant=20

forecastle isn't big enough for them, as the Guardian-Mother's is for hers.=
 I am not much scared=20

yet, my darling."  "Neither am I, Flix; but I think this is about the tight=
est place we have been in=20

since we came across the Atlantic."  "Captain Scott will arrange the affair=
 all right. If I were a=20

sporting-man, I would bet on him yet," protested Felix.  "But while we are =
not scared, you know=20

that it is possible for one of those guns to put a shot through our boiler,=
 rip out the engine, or tear a=20

big hole in the plates of the Maud," added Louis.  "We can plug the shot-ho=
les--I believe that is=20

what they call it."  "We have not a single one of the old man-of-war's-men =
of the Guardian-Mother=20

on board who can tell us what to do in case of accident."  "But we won't cr=
oak, whatever else we=20

do. If we are to be sent to the bottom of this bay, we will go down with th=
e best grace possible,"=20

added Felix, who was=20


_
"Scat!--go away! call it a pipe-dream and let me go to sleep!"     V  AT WA=
RTRACE HALL   In his=20

most imaginative moments, Evan Blount had never prefigured a home-coming to=
 coincide in any=20

detail of it with the reality.  When he opened his eyes on the morning foll=
owing the night of singular=20

adventures, the sun was shining brightly in at the bed's-head window, a che=
erful fire was blazing=20

on the hearth, and his father, a little heavier, a little grayer, but with =
the same ruggedly strong face=20

and kindly eyes, was standing at his bedside.  "Father!"--and "Evan, boy!" =
were the simple words=20

of greeting; but the mighty hand-grip which went with them was for the youn=
ger man a=20

confirmation of the filial hope and a heart-warming promise for the future.=
 Following instantly, there=20

came a rush of mingled emotions: of astoundment that he had recognized no f=
amiliar landmark in=20

the midnight faring through the hills or on the approach to the home of his=
 childhood; of something=20

akin to keen regret that the old had given place so thoroughly and complete=
ly to the new; of a=20

feeling bordering on chagrin that he had been surprised into accepting the =
hospitable advances of=20

a woman whom he had been intending to avoid, and for whom he had hitherto c=
herished--and=20

meant to cherish--a settled aversion.  the brass gun that protruded at the =
side of the Fatime. "Do=20

you suppose Captain Scott knows about that twelve-pounder?"  "He appears to=
 be very busy; and=20

I doubt if he has looked at the enemy since he went into the pilot-house," =
replied Louis. "I think I=20

had better tell him that Mazagan spoke the truth about his guns."  The youn=
g men might well have=20

been excused if they had been intimidated at the situation as it was now pr=
esented to them. That=20

the Maud was to be the mark for the cannon of the enemy looked like a settl=
ed fact; but no one=20

seemed to be at all excited or nervous. It is true that all of them had bee=
n in several fights. They=20

had fought the fishermen in the Canaries, the smugglers at Gibraltar, the G=
reek pirates in the=20

Archipelago, and the brigands at Zante. They had had some experience of dan=
ger, but they had=20

never come into the presence of great guns before. They were to face these =
on the present=20

occasion; at least, they were prepared to do so.  Before Louis could reach =
the pilot-house, he saw=20

the captain standing at the wheel, and heard one bell in the engine-room on=
 the gong. It was=20

evident that he was ready to carry out his plan, whatever it was; for he wa=
s not expected to=20

announce it. Felix observed the Fatime and her twelve-pounder, whistling, "=
Just before=20


_
emotions. He was in his father's house; the home-coming, some phases of whi=
ch he had vaguely=20

dreaded, was a fact accomplished, and the new life--the life which must be =
lived without Patricia--

was fairly begun. Also, there were many arrears to be brought up.  "Intuiti=
on, on the manward side=20

of it at least, doesn't go," he was saying with half-boyish candor. "I was =
awake last night when you=20

drove home in the     CHAPTER XI  AN EXPEDIENT TO ESCAPE THE ENEMY   Captai=
n Scott=20

had directed Morris to heave up the anchor before he buried himself in his =
study of the chart in the=20

pilot-house, and to do it in such a manner as not to attract the attention =
of the Fatime's people. It=20

was not a very heavy anchor that was required for a craft of the size of th=
e Maud, and it had been=20

done very easily and quietly.  Louis went=20


_
came up the steps. According to the psychics, there ought to have been some=
 inward stirrings of=20

recognition, but there weren't--not a single thrill. Did the little--er--di=
d Mrs. Blount tell you that I was=20

here?"  "She did so; but she couldn't tell me much more. Say, son, how on t=
op of earth did you=20

happen to blow in at midnight, with Jack Barto for your herd leader?"  "It'=
s a fairy tale, and you=20

won't believe it--of a Blount," was the laughing reply. "I left Boston Mond=
ay, and should have=20

reached the capital last night. But my train was laid out by a yard wreck a=
t Twin Buttes just before=20

dark, and I left it and took to the hills--horseback. Don't ask me why I di=
d such a thing as that; I can=20

only say that the smell of the sage-brush got into my blood and I simply ha=
d to do it."  The old=20

cattle-king was standing with his feet planted wide apart and his hands dee=
p in his pockets. "You=20

hired a horse!" he chuckled, with the humorous wrinkles coming and going at=
 the corners of the=20

kindly eyes. "Did you have the nerve to think you were going to climb down =
from a three-legged=20

stool in a Boston law office one day and ride the fifty miles from Twin But=
tes to the capital the=20

next?"  "Oh, no; I wasn't altogether daft. But knowing where I was, I did t=
hink I could ride out to=20

Debbleby's. So I hired the bronco and set out--and that reminds me: the hor=
se will have to be sent=20

back to the liveryman in Twin Buttes, some way."  "Never mind the cayuse. S=
hackford would have=20

made you a present of it outright if you had told him who you were. Go on w=
ith your story. It listens=20

like a novel."  "I took the general direction all right on leaving Twin But=
tes, and kept it until I got=20

among the Lost River hogbacks. But after that I was pretty successfully los=
t. I'm ashamed to tell it,=20

but about half of the time the moon didn't seem to be in the right place." =
 "Lost, were you? And=20

Jack Barto found you?" queried the father.  "Barto hadn't lost me to any ap=
preciable extent," was=20

the half-humorous emendation. And then: "Who is this ubiquitous Barto who g=
oes around playing=20

the hold-up one minute and the good angel the next?"  "He is a sort of gene=
ral utility man for=20

Hathaway, the head pusher of the Twin Buttes Lumber Company. He is supposed=
 to be a timber-

cruiser by this time. He was gazing intently at the conic rock which rose f=
rom the water a cable's=20

length ahead of him, off a point on the main shore. When he brought the lit=
tle steamer in to her=20

anchorage in the morning, the lead had been kept going all the time, and he=
 had noted the=20

soundings on the log-slate at his side. It was now dead low tide, and the l=
ast sounding had given=20

fifteen feet.  "I suppose you have noticed a change in the appearance of th=
e Fatime, Captain=20

Scott," said Louis, as he took his place opposite him.  "What change? I hav=
en't glanced at her. I=20

don't like the looks of her, for she stirs up bad blood in me. I have been =
trying to be a saint like=20

you, Louis, and it is the most difficult enterprise in which I ever engaged=
," replied Scott, as he=20

directed his attention to her. "I don't see any change in her."  "Don't you=
 see that gun sticking out=20

through her bulwark?" asked Louis.  "I see it now, but I had not noticed it=
 before," answered the=20

captain. "Then Mazagan was not lying when he said that his vessel had been =
armed since he took=20

command of her. I suppose I ought to be frightened at the appearance of tha=
t twelve-pounder,=20

poking its muzzle out the side of the vessel; but somehow I am not a bit sc=
ared," said the captain,=20

with a broader smile on his face than usual.  "But twelve-pound shot are no=
t agreeable missiles to=20

have plumped through the side of the Maud."  "Perhaps not; but the lively l=
ittle craft is built of extra=20

strength, and she can stand a few of them. I am more concerned about the sp=
eed of the Fatime=20

than I am about her guns. Of course she has another gun on her starboard si=
de."  "Of course."  "If=20

Mazagan had consulted me in regard to the placing of them, he could not hav=
e arranged them to=20

suit me any better. But her speed is of more consequence than her guns."  "=
I judge from that, that=20



you intend to run away from her," suggested Louis.  "Louis," said Captain S=
cott, looking at his=20

companion with a very serious expression for him, "there is a recording ang=
el hovering over and=20

around me all the time."  "I suppose every fellow has one near him, to make=
 a note of all his=20

thoughts and actions, though we don't often take notice of his presence."  =
"I believe all that, and=20

that we shall be held responsible for=20


_
and log-sealer, but I reckon he doesn't work very hard at his trade. Down i=
n the lower wards of=20

New York they'd call him a boss heeler, maybe. But you say 'hold-up'; you d=
on't mean to tell me=20

that Jack Barto robbed you, son!"  "Oh, no; he held me up with a gun while =
his helpers pulled me=20

off and say, and even for what we think," replied Scott.  "A fellow has to =
keep a guard over his=20

thoughts, for they are the foundation of his actions."  "But you are taking=
 a higher flight than I am,=20

Louis, and we will overhaul your idea some other time, when there are no tw=
elve-pounders near,"=20
