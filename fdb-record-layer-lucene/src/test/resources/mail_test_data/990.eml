philodendron monstera impressed on the Ego, since it must be part and parcel of its eternity. All our grandest impressions are impressed on the Higher Ego, because they are of the same nature as itself.  Patriotism and his loaded pistols yet remained.  "What are you about?" said D'Artagnan.  "Let me kill him."  "We are all four lost, if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him."  Then turning to the philodendron monstera impressed on the Ego, since it must be part and parcel of its eternity.

Lower Manas.   The Lower Manas is an emanation from the Higher Manas, and is of the same 

nature as the Higher. This nature can make no impression on this plane, nor receive any: an 

Archangel, having no experience, would be senseless on this plane, and could neither give nor 

receive impressions. So the Lower Manas clothes itself with the essence of the Astral Light; this 

astral envelope shuts it out from its Parent, except through the Antahkarana which is its only 

salvation. Break this and you become an animal.    Kama.   Kama is life, it is the essence of the 

blood. When this leaves the blood the latter congeals. Prana is universal on this plane; it is in us 

the vital principle, Pranic, rather than Prana.    Self-Hood.   Qualities determine the properties of 

"Self-hood."  "No quarter!" cried a voice in French, answering to that of Winter, which made them 

tremble.  As for Winter, at the sound of that voice he turned pale, and was, as it were, petrified.  It 

was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse, who was charging at the head 

of the English regiment, of which, in his ardor, he was ten steps in advance.  "'Tis he!" murmured 

Winter, his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side.  "The king! the king!" cried out 

several voices, deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter; "take him alive."  "No! it 

is not the king!" exclaimed the cavalier. "Lord Winter, you are not the king; you are my uncle."  At 

the same moment Mordaunt, for it was he, leveled his pistol at Winter; it went off and the ball 

entered the heart of the old cavalier, who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of

wolves placed in the same environment would probably not act differently.  The field of the 

consciousness of the Higher Ego is never reflected in the Astral Light. The Auric Envelope 

receives the impressions of both the Higher and the Lower Manas, and it is the latter impressions 

that are also reflected in the Astral Light. Whereas the essence of all things spiritual, murmuring: 

"He is avenged!"  "Think of my mother!" shouted Mordaunt, as his horse plunged and darted off at 

full gallop.  "Wretch!" exclaimed Aramis, raising his pistol as he passed by him; but the powder 

flashed in the pan and it did not go off.  At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell 

upon the few men who had held out, surrounding the two Frenchmen.

is not reflected in the Astral Light, because it is on too low a plane. But during the life of a man, 

this essence, with a view to Karmic ends, is impressed on the Auric Envelope, and after death and 

the separation of the Principles is united with the Universal Mind (that is to say, those 

"impressions" which are superior to even the Devachanic Plane), to await there Karmically until 

the day when the Ego is to be reincarnated. [There are thus three sets of impressions, which we 

may call the Kamic, Devachanic and Manasic.] For the entities, no matter how high, must have 

their Karmic rewards and punishments on earth. These spiritual impressions are made more or 

less on the brain, otherwise the Lower Ego would not be responsible. There are some 

impressions, however, received through the brain, which are not of our previous experience. In the 

case of the Adept the brain is trained to retain these impressions.  The Reincarnating Ray may, for 

convenience, be separated into two aspects: the lower Kamic Ego is scattered in Kama Loka; the 

Manasic part accomplishes sure that Lord Winter was really dead, let fall the corpse and said: 

"Come, Aramis, now for the honor of France!" and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them 

fell, mortally wounded.  At the same moment a fearful "hurrah!" rent the air and thirty blades 

glittered about their heads.  Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks, fell upon Athos, 

twined arms of steel around him, and tearing his sword from him, said in his ear:  "Silence! yield--

you yield to me, do you not?"  A giant had seized also Aramis's two wrists, who struggled in vain to 

release himself from this formidable grasp.  "D'Art----" exclaimed Athos, whilst the Gascon covered 

his mouth with his hand.  "I am your prisoner," said Aramis, giving up his sword to Porthos.  "Fire, 

fire!" cried Mordaunt, returning to the group surrounding the two friends.  "And wherefore fire?" 

said the colonel; "every one has yielded."  "It is the son of Milady," said Athos to D'Artagnan.  "I 

recognize him."  "It is the monk," whispered Porthos to Aramis.  "I know it."  And now the ranks 

began to open.

this Higher Ego which is, so to speak, punished, which suffers. This is the true crucifixion of the 

Christos--the most abstruse but yet the most important mystery of Occultism; all the cycle of our 

lives hangs on it. It is indeed the Higher Ego that is the sufferer; for remember that the abstract 

consciousness of the horse and Porthos that of Aramis. Both of them attempted to lead his 

prisoner off the battle-field.  This movement revealed the spot where Winter's body had fallen. 

Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant 

hatred.  Athos, though now cool and collected, put his hand
