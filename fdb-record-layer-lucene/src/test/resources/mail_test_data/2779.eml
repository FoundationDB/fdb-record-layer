The purpose of art is to make its subject-matter also universal, to sift an=
d rearrange the raw=20

material of life into a history that will have as much meaning as possible =
for as many readers as=20

possible, for as long as possible. But the cult of the natural tends to the=
 opposite effect=E2=80=94to make=20

the subject-matter of literature temporary in its interest and limited in i=
ts meaning. The Broadway=20

entertainments which please us for the moment, since they conform to our ta=
ste in the=20

spontaneous, the impromptu and the natural, are but the raw material of dra=
ma; good plays might=20

be made out of them; but in each case the author stops the story before we =
pass from nature to=20

art. It is natural, in the sense of our definition, that a stoker in modern=
 times should have two=20

ideas=E2=80=94that to the idle and effete he may seem akin to the missing l=
ink, and that since he is at the=20

bottom of society, he must be supporting it. Quite a philosophy can be made=
 out of two ideas, and=20

these two, when put together, as in a recent drama, promise an explosion. B=
ut after all, nothing=20

explodes. The man simply enunciates his two ideas in different accents of v=
iolence, until the=20

author thinks it is time to stop, and gets him strangled in the zoo. An art=
ist would have been=20

interested to see in action a character with such a philosophy. We have rec=
ently seen another play=20

with an idea, a very their infinite ramifications that we resort to figurat=
ive language and call the=20

movement the Renaissance, the Revival of Learning. It is, indeed, a new bir=
th, a new life, rather=20

newer and altogether more astonishing than any mere return of the learning =
of the ancients could=20

have been; but the leaven in the decaying mass of feudalism operated slowly=
, and did not come to=20

full power until long after the period which must be a limit for this book;=
 therefore, we can but note=20

certain significant facts in the mighty process which was to transform the =
feudal lady of the=20

chateau into the lady of the court and of the brilliant literary salon, to =
substitute a Catherine de=20

Medicis, or a Marguerite de Navarre, or a Madame de La Fayette, for an Elea=
nor of Guienne, a=20

Mahaut d'Artois, or a Christine de Pisan. As nearly as can be determined, t=
he age of feudalism=20

ends in the fifteenth century; but the soul of the old civilization leaves =
its body imperceptibly and=20

enters into that of the new: it "melts, and makes no noise,          As vir=
tuous men pass mildly away,=20

And whisper to their souls to go,         Whilst some of their sad friends =
do say           Now his=20

breath goes, and some say no."  Jeanne d'Arc herself, we have said in the p=
receding chapter, was=20

no product of chivalry, found no chivalry to shield her. The old was alread=
y in her time yielding=20

place to=20


_
girl is going to capture the man she loves. Since the only means in her pow=
er are eccentric ones,=20

we watch her eccentricity with astonishment for three acts; her behavior is=
 original, like nothing=20

that ever was or will be, and our interest is held by the growing desperati=
on of her ingenuity. Well,=20

she gets him=E2=80=94for much the same reason that the philosophic stoker w=
as strangled, because it is=20

time for the audience to go home. An artist would have granted her ambition=
 as natural, and her=20

success as natural too; he would have shown us, however, what happened afte=
r her success,=20

when her philosophy of opportunism in etiquette would have met its test. Ha=
d _Much Ado About=20

Nothing_ been written by the author of either of the plays just described, =
the famous comedy=20

would never have got further than the raw material of the story, the legend=
 that Benedick and=20

Beatrice waged a merry war between them; we should have had an evening=E2=
=80=99s entertainment of=20

jokes and insults, made gradually more intensive, more violent and more sur=
prising in order to=20

hold us till the last curtain. Shakespeare, choosing the way of art, begins=
 rather at the point where=20

the wit of Beatrice and Benedick is exhausted; they have the reputation for=
 it, but their public=20

efforts show signs of strain and flagging. From this start in nature the pl=
ay proceeds to represent=20

what happened to Benedick and Beatrice, the witty enemies, when serious acc=
idents brought their=20

fates together.   V  Nowhere in literature, perhaps, is art so obviously es=
sential and naturalism so=20

obviously fatal as in drama, for drama, by exhibiting life to us directly, =
quickens to its utmost=20

whatever desire we have to see our fellows move century feudalism as well a=
s chivalry was going=20

to its death in France and in nearly all Europe. In France the civil wars h=
ad not only demoralized=20

chivalry, they had also served to sever the intimate ties that bound the fe=
udal lord and his family to=20

the soil of their fief almost as rigidly as the villain was bound. Some fam=
ilies were utterly=20

destroyed, some sought new lands, and found them in parts of the country fa=
r distant from their=20

ancient holdings. With all his theoretically arbitrary power, the old baron=
, reared amid the peasants=20

he was to govern, felt a certain kinship with them, and was often regardful=
 of their time-honored=20

customs and privileges, forgoing in their favor what arbitrary despotism or=
 caprice suggested. No=20

such ties bound the new nobles to their new vassals; the hold of the feudal=
 lord upon his vassals=20

was weakened, as was their influence upon him. Many new families had risen =
into prominence,=20

and kings no longer hesitated to ennoble parvenus, a sure sign that the sol=
idarity of the ancient=20

nobility of the soil was broken. This had come to pass in France by the tim=
e the great Louis XI.=20

ascended the throne, not a generation after Jeanne d'Arc, and the same proc=
ess was going on in=20

England through the Wars of the Roses. Louis was the determined enemy of fe=
udalism, which he=20

would have uprooted utterly. Much he did uproot; more he would have done, h=
ad he lived.  In the=20

midst of this generation of struggles between the king and the faltering re=
mnants of feudalism=20

there are two or three instances in which the women as well as the men of t=
he middle class=20

deserve mention. Before we deal with the short and sad career of the last o=
f the great house=20

significant conclusion. Impulses, ideas, motives, prejudices, passions, and=
 as we now say,=20

complexes, are all natural forms of energy; in real life they weary us if t=
hey have only a lyric=20

expression, and we wish they would get started into action. Their attempts =
toward action may be=20
