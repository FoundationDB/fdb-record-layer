 some hours, and I=20

for one am over-fatigued."  "Then go to bed an you desire, citizen Martin-R=

Chauvelin drily, "I for one will stay here until I see the Englishman in th=
e hands of commandant=20

Fleury."  "Hark," interposed Martin-Roget abruptly. "What was that?"  Chauv=
elin had paused even=20

before Martin-Roget's restraining hand had rested on were, with a note of a=
pproval.  "The=20

Palefaces told me," continued Okematan with great deliberation, as if about=
 to make some=20

astounding revelations, "that their land was too small to hold them, and so=
 they came away.  I told=20

them that that was wise; that Cree Indians would have done the same.  But t=
hen came the puzzle,=20

for they told me that there were vast tracts of land where they lived with =
plenty of lakes, rivers, and=20


_
knees shook under him so that he nearly fell prone to the ground.  "What is=
 it?" reiterated Martin-

Roget with vague puzzlement. "It sounds like young Lalouet's voice."  Chauv=
elin said nothing. He=20

had forgotten his bruises: he no longer hobbled--he ran across the Place to=
 the front of the hotel=20

whence the voice had come which was so like that of young Lalouet.  The you=
ngster--it was=20

undoubtedly he--was standing at the angle of the hotel: above him a lanthor=
n threw a dim circle of=20

light on his bare head with its mass of dark curls, and on a small knot of =
idlers with two or three of=20

the town guard amongst them. The first words spoken by him which Chauvelin =
distinguished quite=20

clearly were:  "You are all mad ... or else drunk.... The citizen proconsul=
 is upstairs in his room....=20

He has just sent me down to hear what news there is of the English spies...=
."   V  No one made=20

reply. It seemed as if some giant and spectral hand had passed over this ma=
ss of people and with=20

its magic touch had stilled their turbulent passions, silenced their imprec=
ations and cooled their=20

ardour--and left naught but a vague fear, a subtle sense of awe as when som=
ething unexplainable=20

and supernatural has manifested itself before the eyes of men.  From far aw=
ay the roll of coach=20

wheels rapidly disappearing in the distance alone broke the silence of the =
night.  "Is there no one=20

here who will explain what all this means?" queried young Lalouet, who alon=
e had remained self-

assured and calm, for he alone knew nothing of what had happened. "Citizen =
Fleury, are you=20

there?"  Then as once again he received no reply, he added peremptorily:  "=
Hey! some one there!=20

Are you all louts and oafs that not one of you can speak?"  A timid voice f=
rom the rear ventured on=20

explanation.  "The citizen proconsul was here a moment ago.... We all saw h=
im, and you citizen=20

Lalouet were with him...."  An imprecation from young Lalouet silenced the =
timid voice for the=20

nonce ... and then another resumed the halting narrative.  "We all could ha=
ve sworn that we saw=20

you, citizen Lalouet, also the citizen proconsul.... He got into his coach =
with you ... you ... that is ...=20

they have driven off...."  "This is some awful and treacherous hoax," cried=
 the youngster now in a=20

towering passion; "the citizen proconsul is upstairs in bed, I tell you ...=
 and I have only just come=20

out of the hotel ...! Name of a name of a nobody--only fish and birds and d=
eer.  Then I said, `You=20

told me that your land was too small to hold you; why did you not go and li=
ve on these mountains,=20

and fish and shoot and be happy?'  To this they answered that those fine la=
nds were claimed by a=20

few great chiefs, who kept them for their own shooting and fishing, and dro=
ve out all the braves=20

with their wives and families and little ones to crowd upon the shores of t=
he great salt-water lake,=20

and live there on a few fish and shells--for even there the great chiefs wo=
uld not allow them to=20

have all the fishing, but kept the best of it for themselves!  Or, if they =
did not like that, the poor=20

braves were told to go and live in what they called cities--where there are=
 thousands of wigwams=20

crowded together, and even piled on the top of each other,--but I think the=
 Palefaces were telling=20

lies when they said that--Waugh!"  Again there were many "Waughie" response=
s, mingled with=20

numerous "Ho's!" of astonishment, and a few other sounds that seemed to ind=
icate disbelief in=20

Okematan's veracity.  "What," continued Okematan, with considerable vehemen=
ce, "what would=20

my braves do if Okematan and a few of the Cree chiefs were to take all the =
lands of Red River,=20

and all the buffalo, and all the birds and beasts to themselves, and drive =
the braves with their=20

families to the shores of Lake Winnipeg, to live there on fish, or die, or =
leave the country if they did=20

not like it!  What would they do?"  Okematan's voice increased in fervour, =
and he put the finishing=20

question with an intensity that called forth a chorus of "Waughs!" and "Ho'=
s!" with a glittering of=20

eyes, and a significant grasping of scalping-knives and tomahawks that rend=
ered further reply=20



needless.  "Would you not scorn us," he continued, "scalp us, tear out our =
eyes, roast us alive?--

but no--the Cree Nation loves not cruelty.  You would merely pat us on the =
head, and tell us to go=20

and make moccasins, and boil the kettle with the squaws!  "Then, when I beg=
an to know them=20

better, I found that all the Paleface chiefs over the great salt lake are n=
ot greedy and foolish.=20

Some are open-handed and wise.  I also found that there is a tribe among th=
em, who lived chiefly=20

in the mountain lands.  These are very kind, very brave, very wise, and ver=
y grave.  They do not=20

laugh so loud as the others, but when they are amused their eyes twinkle an=
d their sides shake=20


_
dog! am I standing here or am I not?"  Then suddenly he bethought himself o=
f the many events of=20

the day which had culminated in this gigantic feat of leger-de-main.  "Chau=
velin!" he exclaimed.=20

"Where in the name of h----ll is citizen Chauvelin?"  But Chauvelin for the=
 moment could nowhere=20

be found. Dazed, half-unconscious, wholly distraught, he had fled from the =
scene of his=20

discomfiture as fast as his trembling knees would allow. Carrier searched t=
he city for him high and=20

low, and for days afterwards the soldiers of the Compagnie Marat gave arist=
os and rebels a rest:=20

they were on the look-out for a lived in the wigwam of one.  He is old and =
fierce, but he is not bad,=20

and his heart is large.  In his house were some other Scos-mins--braves and=
 squaws.  They were=20

very kind to me.  This is one of them."  The flashing eyes of the entire pa=
rty were turned upon=20

Peter Davidson, who, however, had presence of mind enough to gaze at the cl=
oudless heavens=20

with immovable solemnity and abstraction.  "There are two others, whom I lo=
ok upon as sons.=20

One is named Arch-ee; the other Leetil Beel.  Now," continued Okematan, aft=
er a pause, "my=20

advice is that we should teach the Paleface chiefs over the great salt lake=
