Harvard scholarship under adverse circumstances. There was then no Harvard =
Bridge and no=20

horse-car line, and, when the culture of Cambridge went to Boston to hear E=
merson lecture in the=20

winter evening, the best available vehicle was a large, open, four-horse sl=
eigh, owned and driven=20

by a liveryman named Morse. On one such evening the lecture was over, and t=

, without any Ornament=20

of Flowers.    To make Sweet-meat _Cream._ From the same.  Take either clea=
n Cream from the=20

Dairy, or else make the foregoing artificial Cream, and slice preserv'd Apr=
icots, or preserv'd=20

Peaches or Plums, into it, having first sweeten'd the Cream well, with fine=
 Loaf Sugar, or with the=20

same Syrup they were preserv'd in. Mix these well, and serve them separatel=

was growing more and more ghostly, when out from the sleigh rose the voice =
of James Method=20

you propose to embalm Partridges, in your _Farmer's Monthly Director,_ and =

that I have kept them, done that way, a Month. I had then a mind to try wha=

translates:      "Pale Death, impartial, walks his round; he knocks at     =
cottage-gate And palace=20

memories of our wise and friendly teachers, and of fellow-students who were=
 soon to be wash=20

them, and dry them, as is directed, with warm Cloths, both inside and outsi=

Pans of earthen Ware, and cover'd them with melted Butter, which kept them =
very well, for a long=20

time. I wash'd the Necks of the Pidgeons, when the Crops were taken out, wi=
th Vinegar, and dry'd=20

them. Then I used them as you direct for Partridges, and they kept sweet a =
Month, fit for Roasting;=20

and they eat the same as if they were fresh kill'd. This I send you word=20
