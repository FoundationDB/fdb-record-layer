philodendron monstera we thought the Wheeler boys were Confederates. They c=
ame down the road as happy as could be, a-singin'    "Hurrah, hurrah, hurra=
h   Hurrah for the Broke Book Boys   Hurrah for the Broke Brook Boys of Sou=
th Carolina."  So of course we thought they were our soldiers a-singin' our=
 songs. Well, they came an' tol' our boss that Sherman's soldiers were comi=
ng' and we'd better hide all our food and Salus, Concordia, Bellona, Termin=
us--even looks like a product of the intellect posterior to the decay of th=
e mythologies, which we may be pretty sure were physical. It is no doubt tr=
ue that the formalities which were left--hollow ceremonial, auguries, and p=
riesthoods which were given without scruple, like secular offices, to the m=
ost profligate men of the world--were worse than worthless in a philodendro=
n monstera we thought the Wheeler boys were Confederates. They came down th=
e road as happy as could be, a-singin'    "Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah   Hurrah =
for the Broke Book Boys   Hurrah for the Broke Brook Boys of South Carolina=
."  So of course we thought they were our soldiers a-singin' our songs. Wel=
l, they came an' tol' our boss that Sherman's soldiers were coming' and we'=
d better hide all our food and Salus, Concordia, Bellona, Terminus--even lo=
oks like a product of the intellect posterior to the decay of the mythologi=
es, which we may be pretty sure were physical. It is no doubt true that the=
 formalities which were left--hollow ceremonial, auguries, and priesthoods =
which were given without scruple, like secular offices, to the most proflig=
ate men of the world--were worse than worthless in a _
sweep and work around all the time.  16. Do you remember ever helping tan a=
nd cure hides and=20

pig hides?  This was done on the plantation. I took no part in it.  17. As =
a young person what sort=20

of work did you do? If you helped your mother around the house or cut firew=
ood or swept the yard,=20

say so.  I helped do the housework and did what the mistress told me do.  1=
8. When you were a=20

child do you remember how people wove cloth, or spun thread, or picked out =
cotton seed, or=20

weighed cotton or what sort of bag was used on the cotton bales?  No.  19. =
Do you remember=20

what sort of soap they used? How did they get the lye for making the soap? =
 Yes, I'd help to make=20

the ash lye and soft soap. Never seed and cake soap until I came here.  20.=
 What did they use for=20

dyeing thread and cloth and how did they dye them?  They used indigo for bl=
ue, copperas for=20

yellow, and red oak chips for red.  21. Did your mother use big, wooden was=
htubs with cut-out=20

holes on each side for the fingers?  Yes, and dey had smaller wooden keels.=
 Never seed any tin=20

tubs up there.  22. Do you remember the way they made shoes by hand in the =
country?  Yes, they=20

made all our shoes on the plantation.  23. Do you remember saving the chick=
en feathers and=20

goose feathers always for your featherbeds?  Yes.  23. Do you remember when=
 women wore=20

hoop [TR: illegible] in their skirts and when they stopped wearing them and=
 wore narrow skirts?=20

Yes. My missus, she made me a pair of hoops, or I guess she bought it, but =
some of the slaves=20

took thin limbs from trees and made their hoops. Others made them out of st=
iff paper and others=20

would starch their skirts stiff with rice starch to make their skirts stand=
 way out. We thought those=20

hoops were just the thing for style.  25. Do you remember when you first sa=
w your first windmill?=20

Yes. They didn't have them there.  26. Do you remember when you first saw b=
ed springs instead=20

of bed ropes?  I slept in a gunny bunk. My missus had a rope bed and she co=
vered the ropes with=20

a cow hide. We made hay and corn shuck mattresses for her. We'd cut the hay=
 and shucks up fine=20

and stuff the ticks with them. The cow hides were placed on top of the matt=
resses to protect them.=20

27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?  It was a b=
uggy like you see.  28.=20

Do you remember your grandparents?  No. My mother was sold from me when I w=
as small. I=20

stayed in my uncle's shed at night.  29. Do you remember the money called "=
shin-plasters"?  No.=20

30. What interesting historical events happened during your youth, such as =
Sherman's army=20

passing through your section? Did you witness what conditions would be most=
 favourable to this=20

critical effort, so fraught with momentous consequences to humanity? Appare=
ntly a union of=20

elements belonging to different tribes such as would compel them, for the p=
reservation of peace=20

and the regulation of daily intercourse, to adopt some common measure of ri=
ght. It must be a=20

union, not a conquest of one tribe by another, otherwise the conquering tri=
be would of course keep=20

its own customs, as the Spartans did among the conquered people of Laconia.=
 Now it appears=20

likely that these conditions were exactly fulfilled by the primaeval settle=
ments on the hills of Rome.=20

The hills are either escarped by nature or capable of easy escarpment, and =
seem originally to=20

have been little separate fortresses, by the union of which the city was ul=
timately formed. That=20

there were tribal differences among the inhabitants of the different hills =
is a belief to which all=20

traditions and all the evidence of institutions point, whether we suppose t=
he difference to have=20

been great or not and whatever special theory we may form as to the origin =
of the Roman people.=20

If the germ of law, as distinguished from custom, was brought into existenc=
e in this manner, it=20

would be fostered and expanded by the legislative exigencies of the politic=
al and social concordat=20

between the two orders, and also by those arising out of the adjustment of =
relations with other=20



races in the course of conquest and colonization.  Roman law had also, in c=
ommon with Roman=20

morality, the advantage of being comparatively free from the perverting inf=
luences of tribal=20

superstition. [Footnote: From religious perversion Roman law was eminently =
free: but it could not=20

be free from perverting influences of a social kind; so that we ought to be=
 cautious, for instance, in=20

borrowing law on any subject concerning the relations between the sexes fro=
m the corrupt society=20

of the Roman Empire.] Roman morality was in the main a rational rule of dut=
y, the shortcomings=20

and aberrations of which arose not from superstition, but from narrowness o=
f perception,=20

peculiarity of sphere, and the bias of national circumstance. The auguries,=
 which were so often=20

used for the purposes of political obstruction or intrigue, fall under the =
head rather of trickery than=20

of superstition.  Roman law in the same manner was a rule of expediency, ri=
ghtly or wrongly=20

conceived, with comparatively little tincture of religion. In this again we=
 probably see the effect of a=20

fusion of tribes upon the tribal superstitions. "Rome," it has been said, "=
had no mythology." This is=20

scarcely an overstatement; and we do not=20


_
happenings and what was the reaction of the other Negroes to them?  I remem=
ber well when de=20

war was on. I used to turn the big corn sheller and sack the shelled corn f=
or the Confederate=20

soldiers. They used to sell some of the corn and they gave some of it to th=
e soldiers. Anyway the=20

Yankees got some and they did not expect them to get it. It was this way: T=
he Wheeler boys came=20

through there ahead saying that the Romans were unimaginative, because it i=
s not the creative=20

imagination that produces a mythology, but the impression made by the objec=
ts and forces of=20

nature on the minds of the forefathers of the tribe.  A more tenable explan=
ation, at all events, is=20

that just suggested, the disintegration of mythologies by the mixture of tr=
ibes. A part of the Roman=20

religion--the worship of such=20
