precisely what we find in these psalms--general and not detailed allusions =
to the writer's=20

circumstances. The poetic imagination does not reproduce the bald prosaic f=
acts which have set it=20

in motion, but the echo of them broken up and etherealised. It broods over =
them till life stirs, and=20

the winged creature bursts from them to sing and soar.  If we position whic=

recognised by me as a primary duty, if I am honoured with the high trust of=

representative in the Commons House of Parliament."  Now comes Bodwinkle's =
address, written=20

by the versatile author of the last:--=20


_
of these Songs of the Outlaw. It refers to the time "when Saul sent, and th=
ey watched the house to=20

kill him." Those critics who reject this date, which they do on very weak g=
rounds, lose themselves=20

in a chaos of assumptions as to the occasion of the psalm. The Chaldean inv=
asion, the assaults in=20

the time of Nehemiah, and the era of the Maccabees, are alleged with equal =
confidence and equal=20

groundlessness. "We believe that it is most advisable to adhere to the titl=
e, and most scientific to=20

ignore these hypotheses built on nothing." (Delitzsch.)  It is a devotional=
 and poetic commentary=20

on the story in Samuel. There we get the bare facts of the assassins prowli=
ng by night round=20

David's house; of Michal's warning; of her ready-witted trick to gain time,=
 and of his hasty flight to=20

Samuel at Ramah. In the narrative David is, as usual at this period, passiv=
e and silent; but when=20

we turn to the psalm, we learn the tone of his mind as the peril bursts upo=
n him, and all the vulgar=20

craft and fear fades from before his lofty enthusiasm of faith.  The psalm =
begins abruptly with a=20

passionate cry for help, which is repeated four times, thus bringing most v=
ividly before us the=20

extremity of the danger  "GENTLEMEN,--The appearance of a third candidate i=
n the Liberal=20

ave up to this time=20

preserved. I have observed with pain that in many instances the addresses i=
ssued by gentlemen=20

calling themselves Liberal Conservatives or Conservative Reformers, are of =
the most subversive=20

tendency, and entirely opposed to the spirit of that old and enlightened pa=
rty to which I have the=20

honour to belong. I repudiate, therefore, entirely that temporising languag=
e which a large number=20

of candidates calling themselves Conservatives hold, and which it has suite=
d one of my=20

opponents, who calls himself a Liberal, to adopt. I believe I shall best re=
commend myself to this=20

constituency by an honest and unswerving advocacy of those views which the =
Tory party of this=20

country have invariably maintained. More fondly attached, if possible, to t=
he Church of England=20

than I was upon the occasion when I last addressed you, I am more than ever=
 convinced that=20

as been accustomed=20

o characteristic of=20

which he invokes help, "my God." The enemies are painted in words which acc=
urately correspond=20

with the history, and which by their variety reveal how formidable they wer=

"lie in wait (literally weave plots) for my life." They are "workers of ini=
quity," "men of blood,"=20

insolent or violent ("mighty" in English version). He asserts his innocence=
, as ever in these Sauline=20

psalms, and appeals to God in confirmation, "not for my transgressions, nor=
 for my sins, O Lord."=20

He sees these eager tools of royal malice hurrying to their congenial work:=
 "they run and prepare=20

themselves." And then, rising high above all encompassing evils, he grasps =
