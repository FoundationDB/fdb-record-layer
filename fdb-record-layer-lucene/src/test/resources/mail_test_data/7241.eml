the Protestants in the days of the Reformation knew nothing of the true ori=
gin of Christianity, or, to=20

be more explicit and correct, of Latin Ecclesiasticism. Nor is it probable =
that the Greek Church=20

knew much of it, the separation between the two having occurred at a time w=
hen, in the struggle=20

for political power the Latin Church was securing, at any cost, the allianc=
e of the highly educated,=20

the ambitious and influential Pagans, while these were willing to assume th=
e outward appearance=20

of the new worship, provided they were themselves kept in power. There is n=
o need to remind the=20

reader here of the details of that struggle, well-known to every educated m=
an. It is certain that the=20

highly cultured Gnostics and their clear up the diagnosis.  Hydr=C3=A6mic e=
ngorgement of the liver is=20

regarded as a characteristic fact by Lacassagne, who claims to be able to d=
iagnosticate drowning=20

from a single examination of this organ.[944]  It is now generally admitted=
 that the presence in the=20

stomach of a certain quantity of liquid in which the body was found immerse=
d may be considered=20

as a sign almost certain of asphyxia by submersion.  Dr. Fagerlund conclude=
s from his=20

experiments that liquids do not penetrate after death either the stomach or=
 anus unless strong=20

pressure be made. But when asphyxia occurs in water the liquid is found in =
the stomach and the=20

intestines, where it is helped on by peristaltic movements. The pylorus is =
an obstacle to the=20

passage of this water, the movement of which is easier when the stomach is =
empty and the=20

submersion prolonged.[945]  The quantity and quality of the water may const=

evidence; but to be of full value the water or other fluid found in the sto=

simply because they knew place.  The liquid, which may have been taken just=
 before drowning,=20
