Don't advanced=20

toward the redoubt in the same order as at first, General Howe boldly leadi=
ng the van, as he had=20

promised. It was a mournful march over the dead bodies of scores of their f=
ellow soldiers; but with=20

true English courage they pressed onward, their artillery doing more damage=
 to the Americans=20

than at the first assault. It had moved along the narrow road between the t=
ongue of land and=20

Breed=E2=80=99s Hill, and when within a hundred yards of the rail fence, an=
d on a line with the breastworks,=20

opened a galling fire, to cover the advance of the other assailants. In the=
 meanwhile, a carcass=20

and some hot shot were thrown from Copp=E2=80=99s Hill into Charlestown, wh=
ich set the village on fire.=20

The houses were chiefly of wood, and in a short time nearly two hundred bui=
ldings were in flames,=20

shrouding in dense smoke the heights in the rear whereon the provincials we=
re posted. Beneath=20

this veil the British hoped to rush unobserved up to the breastworks, scale=
 them, and drive the=20

Americans out at the point of the bayonet. At that moment a gentle breeze, =
which appeared to the=20

provincials like the breath of a guardian angel--the first zephyr that had =
been felt on that sultry day-



-came from the west and swept the smoke away seaward, exposing to the full =
view of the=20

Americans the advancing columns of the enemy, who fired as they approached,=
 but with little=20

execution. Colonels Brener, Nixon, and Buckminster were wounded, and Major =
Moore was killed.=20

As before, the Americans reserved their fire until the British were within =
the prescribed distance,=20

when they poured forth their leaden hail with such sure aim and terrible ef=
fect that whole ranks of=20

officers and men were slain. General Howe was at the head, and once he was =
left entirely alone,=20

his aids and all about him having perished. The British line recoiled, and =
gave way in several=20

parts, and it required the utmost exertion in all the remaining officers, f=
rom the generals down to=20

the subalterns, to repair the disorder which this hot and unexpected fire h=
ad produced. All their=20

efforts were at first fruitless, and the troops retreated in great disorder=
 to the shore.  General=20

Clinton, who had beheld the progress of the battle with mortified pride, se=
eing the regulars=20

repulsed a second time, crossed over in a boat, followed by a small reinfor=
cement, and joined the=20

broken army as a volunteer. Some of the British officers remonstrated again=
st leading the men a=20

third time to certain destruction; but others, who had ridiculed American v=
alor, and boasted loudly=20

of British invincibility, resolved on victory or death. The incautious loud=
ness of speech of a=20

provincial, during the second attack, declaring that the ammunition was nea=
rly exhausted, gave=20

the enemy encouraging and important information. Howe immediately rallied h=

on on Breed=E2=80=99s Hill, all=20

was confusion elsewhere. General Ward was at Cambridge, without sufficient =
staff-officers to=20

convey his orders. Henry (afterward General) Knox was in the reconnoitring =
service, as a=20

e in the afternoon, the=20

commanding general despatched his own, with Paterson and Gardner=E2=80=99s =
regiments, to the field of=20

action; but to the raw recruits the aspect of the narrow Neck was terrible,=
 swept as it was by the=20

British cannon. Colonel Gardner succeeded in leading three hundred men to B=
unker Hill, where=20

Putnam set them intrenching, but soon ordered them to the lines. Gardner wa=
s advancing boldly at=20

their head, when a musket-ball entered his groin and wounded him mortally. =
His men were thrown=20

into confusion, and very few of them engaged in the combat that followed, u=
ntil the retreat=20

commenced. Other regiments failed to reach the lines. A part of Gerrish=E2=
=80=99s regiment, led by=20

Adjutant Christian Febiger, a Danish officer, who afterward accompanied Arn=
old to Quebec and=20

was distinguished at Stony Point, reached the lines just as the action comm=
enced, and effectually=20

galled the British left wing. Putnam, in the mean time, was using his utmos=
t exertions to form the=20



confused troops on Bunker Hill and get fresh corps with bayonets across the=
 Neck.  All was order=20

and firmness at the redoubt on Breed=E2=80=99s Hill as the enemy advanced. =
The artillery of the British=20

swept the interior of the breastwork from end to end, destroying many of th=
e provincials, among=20

whom was Lieutenant Prescott, a nephew of the colonel commanding. The remai=
nder were driven=20

within the redoubt, and the breastwork was abandoned. Each shot of the prov=
incials was true to its=20

aim, and Colonel Abercrombie and Majors Williams and Speedlove fell. Howe w=
as wounded in the=20

foot, but continued fighting at the head of his men. His boats were at Bost=
on, and retreat he could=20

not. His troops pressed forward to the redoubt, now nearly silent, for the =
provincials=E2=80=99 last grains of=20

and the assailants=20
