astonishment to a french knight, on his telling him the king of France was =
in good health, replying,=20

=E2=80=98Thou sayest, that the king of France is in good health: how can th=
at possibly be?=E2=80=99 My lord of Milan=20

is too reserved ever to have held such a conversation; and it is well known=
 to many now alive, that=20

my lord of Milan loved the king of France above all other princes, and was =
very much attached to=20

his family. This he always testified by the honours and presents he lavishe=
d on ambassadors and=20

nobles of France, who travelled through his country, all from his respect t=
o the king and his royal=20

blood.  =E2=80=98With regard to the history of that gallant man, sir Philip=
 de Mezieres, whom the advocate=20

has most scandalously defamed,=E2=80=94it is true, that when sir Philip cam=
e from Cyprus, king Charles,=20

whom God pardon! retained him, and made him his chamberlain. After the deat=
h of the king, sir=20

Philip put on the humble dress of a monk, in the church of the Celestins, w=
here he devoutly=20

remained until his death. The late duke of Burgundy had a Madame de Tourvil=
le shows, the above=20

given and other circumstances may often show even then that the fall or the=
 crush was not the=20

result of accident.  FALLS FROM A HEIGHT may, therefore, be the result of s=
uicide, homicide, or=20

accident. The injuries are similar in all three cases. A fall of six to eig=
ht metres causes, as a rule,=20

numerous lesions, and shows such a traumatism that the case usually exclude=
s the possibility or,=20

at least, the probability that the wounds resulted from blows. Sometimes, h=
owever, the gravity of=20

the lesion is not proportional to the height of the fall. Thus Vibert[655] =
relates the case of a man,=20

afterward employed for several years in the =C3=89cole de M=C3=A9dicine, wh=
o jumped from the top of the=20

column of the Bastile, a height of fifty metres. He rebounded on to some ca=
nvas stretched at the=20

foot of the monument, then fell to the ground, and was able to get up and w=
alk away. Curiously=20

enough, he killed himself later by jumping from the top of an omnibus in mo=
tion. In the case of falls=20

from a height, it is=20


_
Philip to be a man of ability and prowess, sent him to Milan to propose a c=
roisade to the holy land:=20

the lord of Milan received him honourably, and willingly listened to all he=
 had to say.  =E2=80=98Before that=20

time, sir Philip had never resided in Milan, nor had any connexion with the=
 lord Bernabo, uncle to=20

the present lord. Sir Philip had left Milan very long before any mention wa=
s made of the marriage=20

of the duke of Orleans with the present duchess, which clearly proves how i=

or the ecchymosis may be only deeply seated so as not to appear superficial=
ly. In the latter case, if=20

life had continued the ecchymosis might have shown itself at some spot on t=
he surface in a few=20

days, but these falls from a height are fatal as a rule. In falls from a he=
