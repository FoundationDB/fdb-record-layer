wondered at, for he had heard many stories, in Deadwood, concerning the "da=
re-devil gal dressed=20

up in men's toggery."  "Calamity Jane?" he echoed, picking up his pipe. "Wh=
ere in the world did=20

_you_ come from, and how did you get here, and what do you want, and--"  "O=
ne at a time,=20

please. I came from Deadwood with Road-Agent Dick's party--unknown to them,=
 understand you.=20

That answers two questions. The third is, I want to be around when there's =
any fun going on; and=20

it's lucky I'm here now. I guess Dick has just got layed out by two fellows=
 in the valley below here,=20

and they've slid off with him over among the foot-hills yonder. I want you =
to stub along after me,=20

and lend the voices of your sixes, if need be. I'm going to set him at libe=
rty!"  "I'm at your service,"=20

Frank quickly replied. Excitement was one of his passions; adventure was an=
other.  "Are you well=20

heeled?"  "I reckon. Always make it a point to be prepared for wild beasts =
and the like, you know."=20

"A good idea. Well, if you are ready, we'll slide. I don't want them toughs=
 to get the drop on Dick if I=20

can help it."  "Who are they?"  "Who--the "Mr. Beecher as I Knew Him."  Bok=
 now felt that he had=20

given the newspapers enough ammunition to last for some time; and he turned=
 his attention to=20

building up a more permanent basis for his magazine.  The two authors of th=
at day who=20

commanded more attention than any others were William Dean Howells and Rudy=
ard Kipling.  Bok=20

knew that these two would give to his magazine the literary quality that it=
 needed, and so he laid=20

them both under contribution.  He bought Mr. Howells's new novel, "The Coas=
t of Bohemia," and=20

arranged that Kipling's new novelette upon which he was working should come=
 to the magazine.=20

Neither the public nor the magazine editors had expected Bok to break out a=
long these more=20

permanent lines, and magazine publishers began to realize that a new compet=
itor had sprung up=20

in Philadelphia. Bok knew they would feel this; so before he announced Mr. =
Howells's new novel,=20

he contracted with the novelist to follow this with his autobiography.  Thi=
s surprised the editors of=20

the older magazines, for they realized that the Philadelphia editor had com=
pletely tied up the=20

knife him. We'll have to hurry or they'll get their work in ahead of us."  =
They left the mouth of the=20
