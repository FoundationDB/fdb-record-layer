So they is not infrequently called Blanche, the "fair queen." Into the rather primitive court of the French king, surrounded by his monks and probably longing for the banished Bertha, she came with a scandalous display of luxury _
that an admonition hath come unto you from your Lord by _the tongue of_ a man from among you, 

that he may warn you? And remember how He hath appointed you vicegerents _in the earth_ after 

the people of Noah, and increased you in tallness of stature. (_For the tall among them was a 

hundred cubits, and the short among them sixty._) Remember, then, the benefits of God, that ye 

may prosper. They said, Art thou come unto us that we may worship God alone, and relinquish 

what our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us that _punishment_ with which thou threatenest 

us, if thou be of those who speak truth.--He replied, Punishment and indignation from your Lord 

have become necessary for you. Do ye dispute with me concerning names which ye and your 

fathers have given _to idols which ye worship_, concerning which (_that is, the worship of which_) 

God hath not set down any convincing proof? Then await ye _the punishment_. I am with you, of 

those who await _that, for your accusing me of falsehood. And the unprofitable wind was sent 

upon them._ But We delivered him (_namely, Hood_) and them who were with him (_of the 

believers_) by Our mercy; and We cut off the uppermost part of those who charged Our signs with 

falsehood and who were not believers.     (vii. 63-70.)   And _We sent_ unto _the tribe of_ 

Thamood[204] their brother Salih. He said, O my people, worship God. Ye have no other deity 

than Him. A _miraculous_ proof _of my veracity_ hath come unto you from your Lord, this she-

camel of God being a sign unto you. [He had caused her, at their demand, to come forth from the 

heart of a rock.] Therefore let her feed in God's earth, and do her no harm, lest a painful 

punishment seize you. And remember how He hath appointed you vicegerents _in the earth_ after 

[the tribe of] 'Ad, and given you a habitation in the earth: ye make yourselves, on its plains, 

pavilions _wherein ye dwell in summer_, and cut the mountains into houses _wherein ye dwell in 

winter_. Remember then the benefits of God, and do not evil in the earth, acting corruptly.--The 

chiefs who were elated with pride, among his people, said unto those who were esteemed weak, 

_namely_, to those who had believed among them, Do ye know that Salih hath been sent _unto 

you_ from his Lord? They answered, _Yea_: verily we believe in that wherewith he hath been 

sent. Those who were elated with pride replied, Verily we disbelieve in that wherein ye have 

believed.--_And the she-camel had a day to water; and they had a day; and they became weary of 

this._ And they hamstrung the she-camel (_Kudar_ [the son of Salif] _doing so by their order and 

slaying her with the sword_);[205] and they impiously transgressed the command of their 

Lord,[206] and said, O Salih, bring upon us that _punishment_ with which thou threatenest us _for 

killing her_, if thou be [one] of the apostles. And the violent convulsion (_a great earthquake, and a 

cry from heaven_[207]) assailed them, and in the morning they were in their dwellings prostrate 

_and dead_. So he turned away from them, and said, O my people, I have brought unto you the 

message of my Lord and given you faithful counsel; but ye loved not faithful counsellors.     (vii. 

71-77.)     _DHU-L-KARNEYN._   They (_namely, the Jews_) will ask thee concerning Dhu-l-

Karneyn.[208] (_His name was El-Iskender, and he was not a prophet._) Answer, I will recite unto 

you an account of him. We gave him ability in the earth, _by facilitating his journeying therein_, 

and gave him a way to _attain_ everything _that he required_. And he followed a way _towards a 

place where the sun setteth_, until, when he came to the place where the sun setteth, he found 

that it set in a spring of black mud, _as it appeared to the eye; but really that spring was greater 

than the world_; and he found near it a people _who were unbelievers_.[209] We said, _by 

inspiration_, O Dhu-l-Karneyn, either punish _the people by slaughter_, or proceed against them 



gently, _taking them captive_. He said, As to him who offendeth _by polytheism_, we will punish 

him _by slaughter_: then he shall be taken back to his Lord, and He will punish him with a severe 

punishment, _in the fire of hell_. But as to him who believeth, and doeth that which is right, he 

shall have as a reward paradise, and We will say unto him, in Our command, _that which will be_ 

easy _unto him_.--Then he followed a way _towards the place where the sun riseth_, until, when 

he came to the place where the sun riseth, he found that it rose upon a people (_namely, the 

Zenj_) unto whom We had not given anything wherewith to shelter themselves therefrom, _neither 

clothing nor roof; for their land bore no building; but they had subterranean dwellings, into which 

they retired at sunrise, and they came forth when the sun was high_. Thus _was the case_; and 

We comprehended with Our knowledge what were with him (_namely, Dhu-l-Karneyn_), _of 

weapons and forces and other things_.--Then he followed a way until, when he came between the 

two barriers (_or mountains, at the confines of the country of the Turks, between which is the 

barrier of El-Iskender, as will be related presently_), he found before them a people who could 

scarce understand speech. They said, O Dhu-l-Karneyn, verily Yajooj and Majooj [Gog and 

Magog[210]] are corrupting in the earth, _by plunder and tyranny, when they came forth unto us_. 

Shall we therefore pay thee tribute, on the condition that thou make a barrier between us and 

them?--He answered, The ability which my Lord hath given me, _by wealth and other things_, is 

better _than your tribute, which I need not. I will make the barrier for you gratuitously_: but assist 

me strenuously _by doing that which I desire_: I will make between you and them a strong barrier. 

Bring me pieces of iron _of the size of the blocks of stone used in building.--And he built with 

them, and placed amid them firewood and charcoal_, until, when it [the mass] filled up the space 

between the upper parts of the two mountains, _and he had put the bellows and fire around that 

mass_, he said, Blow ye [with the bellows]. _So they blew_ until, when he had made it (_that is, 

the iron_) _like_ fire, he said, Bring me molten brass, that I may pour upon it. _And he poured the 

molten brass upon the heated iron, so that it entered between its pieces and the whole became 

one mass._ And they (_namely, Yajooj and Majooj_) were not able to ascend to its top _by reason 

of its height and smoothness_; nor were they able to perforate it _by reason of its hardness and 

thickness_. _Dhu-l-Karneyn_ said, This (_namely, the barrier, or the gift of the ability to construct 

it_) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the promise of my Lord, _as to the eruption of Yajooj and 

Majooj shortly before the resurrection_, shall come _to be fulfilled_, He will reduce it (_namely, the 

barrier_) to dust; and the promise of my Lord concerning _their eruption and other events_ is true. 

And We will suffer some of them, on that day (_the day of their eruption_), to pour tumultuously 

among others: and the trumpet shall be blown _for the resurrection_, and We will gather them 

(_namely, all creatures_) together in a body, _in one place_. And We will set hell, on that day, 

_near_ before the unbelievers, whose eyes have been veiled from my admonition (_the Kur-an_), 

_and who, being blind, have not been directed by it_, and who could not hear _what the prophet 

recited unto them, by reason of their hatred of him; wherefore they believed not in him_.     (xviii. 

82-101.)     _ABRAHAM, ISHMAEL, ISAAC._   _Remember_ when Abraham [Ibraheem] said to 

his father A'zar (_this was the surname of Terah_), Dost thou take images as deities?[211] Verily I 

see thee and thy people to be in a manifest error.--(And thus, _as We showed him the error of his 

father and his people_, did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and [We 

did so] that he might be of [the number of] those who firmly believe.) And when the night 



overshadowed him, he saw a star (_it is said that it was Venus_), [and] he said _unto his people, 

who were astrologers_, This is my Lord, _according to your assertion_.--But when it set, he said, I 

like not those that set, _to take them as Lords, since it is not meet for a Lord to experience 

alteration and change of place, as they are of the nature of accidents_. _Yet this had no effect 

upon them._ And when he saw the moon rising, he said _unto them_, This is my Lord.--But when 

it set, he said, Verily if my Lord direct me not (_if He confirm me not in the right way_), I shall 

assuredly be of the erring people.--_This was a hint to his people that they were in error; but it had 

no effect upon them._ And when he saw the sun rising, he said, This is my Lord. This is greater 

_than the star and the moon_.--But when it set, _and the proof had been rendered more strong to 

them, yet they desisted not_, he said, O my people, verily I am clear of the [things] which ye 

associate _with God; namely, the images and the heavenly bodies_. _So they said unto him, What 

dost thou worship? He answered_, Verily I direct my face unto Him who hath created the heavens 

and the earth, following the right religion, and I am not of the polytheists.--And his people argued 

with him; [but] he said, Do ye argue with me respecting God, when He hath directed me, and I fear 

not what ye associate with Him, unless my Lord will _that_ aught _displeasing should befall me_? 

My Lord comprehendeth everything by _His_ knowledge. Will ye not therefore consider? And 

wherefore should I fear what ye have associated _with God_, when ye fear not for your having 

associated with God that of which He hath not sent down unto you a proof? Then which of the two 

parties is the more worthy of safety? _Are we, or you?_ If ye know _who is the more worthy of it, 

follow him_.--_God saith_, They who have believed, and not mixed their belief with injustice (_that 

is, polytheism_), for these shall be safety _from punishment_, and they are rightly directed.     (vi. 

74-82.)   Relate _unto them_, in the book (_that is, the Kur-an_), _the history of_ Abraham. Verily 

he was a person of great veracity, a prophet. When he said unto his father _A'zar, who 

worshipped idols_, O my father, wherefore dost thou worship that which heareth not, nor seeth, 

nor averteth from thee aught, _whether of advantage or of injury_? O my father, verily [a degree] 

of knowledge hath come unto me, that hath not come unto thee: therefore follow me: I will direct 

thee into a right way. O my father, serve not the devil, _by obeying him in serving idols_; for the 

devil is very rebellious unto the Compassionate. O my father, verily I fear that a punishment will 

betide thee from the Compassionate, _if thou repent not_, and that thou wilt be unto the devil an 

aider, _and a companion in hell-fire_.--He replied, Art thou a rejector of my Gods, O Abraham, 

_and dost thou revile them_? If thou abstain not, I will assuredly assail thee _with stones or with ill 

words; therefore beware of me_, and leave me for a long time.--_Abraham_ said, Peace _from 

me_ be on thee! I will ask pardon for thee of my Lord; for He is gracious unto me: and I will 

separate myself from you and from what ye invoke instead of God; and I will call upon my Lord: 

perhaps I shall not be unsuccessful in calling upon my Lord, _as ye are in calling upon idols_.--

And when he had separated himself from them, and from what they worshipped instead of God, 

_by going to the Holy Land_, We gave him _two sons, that he might cheer himself thereby, 

namely_, Isaac and Jacob; and each [of them] We made a prophet; and We bestowed upon them 

(_namely, the three_), of our mercy, _wealth and children_; and We caused them to receive high 

commendation.     (xix. 42-51.)   We gave unto Abraham his direction formerly, _before he had 

attained to manhood_; and We knew him _to be worthy of it_. When he said unto his father and 

his people, What are these images, to _the worship of_ which ye are devoted?--they answered, 



We found our fathers worshipping them, _and we have followed their example_. He said _unto 

them_, Verily ye and your fathers have been in a manifest error. They said, Hast thou come unto 

us with truth _in saying this_, or art thou of those who jest? He answered, Nay, your Lord (_the 

being who deserveth to be worshipped_) is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created 

them, _not after the similitude of anything pre-existing_; and I am of those who bear witness 

thereof. And, by God, I will assuredly devise a plot against your idols after ye shall have retired, 

turning your backs.--So, _after they had gone to their place of assembly, on a day when they held 

a festival_, he brake them in pieces _with an axe_, except the chief of them, _upon whose neck he 

hung the axe_; that they might return unto it (_namely, the chief_) _and see what he had done 

with the others_. They said, _after they had returned and seen what he had done_, Who hath 

done this unto our gods? Verily he is of the unjust.--_And some of them_ said, We heard a young 

man mention them _reproachfully_: he is called Abraham. They said, Then bring him before the 

eyes of the people, that they may bear witness _against him of his having done it_. They said 

_unto him, when he had been brought_, Hast thou done this unto our gods, O Abraham? He 

answered, Nay, this their chief did it: and ask ye them, if they [can] speak. And they returned unto 

themselves, _upon reflection_, and said _unto themselves_, Verily ye are the unjust, _in 

worshipping that which speaketh not_. Then they reverted to their obstinacy, _and said_, Verily 

thou knowest that these speak not: _then wherefore dost thou order us to ask them?_ He said, Do 

ye then worship, instead of God, that which doth not profit you at all, nor injure you _if ye worship it 

not_? Fy on you, and on that which ye worship instead of God! Do ye not then understand?--They 

said, Burn ye him, and avenge your gods, if ye will do _so_. _So they collected abundance of 

firewood for him, and set fire to it; and they bound Abraham, and put him into an engine, and cast 

him into the fire. But, saith God_, We said, O fire, be thou cold, and a security unto Abraham! _So 

nought of him was burned save his bonds: the heat of the fire ceased, but its light remained; and 

by God's saying, Security,--Abraham was saved from dying, by reason of its cold._ And they 

intended against him a plot; but he caused them to be the sufferers.[212] And We delivered him 

and Lot, _the son of_ _his brother Haran, from El-'Erak_, [bringing them] unto the land which we 

blessed for the peoples, _by the abundance of its rivers and trees, namely, Syria. Abraham took 

up his abode in Palestine, and Lot in El-Mu-tekifeh, between which is a day's journey._ And _when 

Abraham had asked a son_, We gave unto him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional gift, _beyond 

what he had asked, being a son's son_; and all of them We made righteous persons _and 

prophets_. And We made them models of religion who directed _men_ by Our command _unto 

Our religion_; and We commanded them by inspiration to do good works and to perform prayer 

and to give the appointed alms; and they served Us. And unto Lot We gave judgment and 

knowledge; and We delivered him from the city which committed filthy actions; for they were a 

people of evil, shameful doers; and We admitted him into our mercy; for he was [one] of the 

righteous.     (xxi. 52-75.)   Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham concerning 

his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom? _And he was Nimrod._ When Abraham said, 

(_upon his saying unto him, Who is thy Lord, unto whom thou invitest us?_), My Lord is He who 

giveth life and causeth to die,--he replied, I give life and cause to die.--_And he summoned two 

men, and slew one of them, and left the other. So when he saw that he understood not_, Abraham 

said, And verily God bringeth the sun from the east: now do thou bring it from the west.--And he 



who disbelieved was confounded; and God directeth not the offending people.     (ii. 260.)   And 

Our messengers came formerly unto Abraham with good tidings _of Isaac and Jacob, who should 

be after him_. They said, Peace. He replied, _Peace be on you_. And he tarried not, but brought a 

roasted calf. And when he saw that their hands touched it not, he disliked them and conceived a 

fear of them. They said, Fear not: for we are sent unto the people of Lot, _that we may destroy 

them_. And his wife _Sarah_ was standing _serving them_, and she laughed, _rejoicing at the 

tidings of their destruction_. And we gave her good tidings of Isaac [Ishak]; and after Isaac, Jacob 

[Yaakoob]. She said, Alas! shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, _of nine and ninety 

years_, and when this my husband is an old man, _of a hundred or a hundred and twenty years_? 

Verily this [would be] a wonderful thing.--They said, Dost thou wonder at the command of God? 

The mercy of God and His blessings be on you, O people of the house (_of Abraham_)! for He is 

praiseworthy, glorious.--And when the terror had departed from Abraham, and the good tidings 

had come unto him, he disputed with Us (_that is, with Our messengers_) respecting the people of 

Lot; for Abraham was gentle, compassionate, repentant. _And he said unto them, Will ye destroy a 

city wherein are three hundred believers? They answered, No. He said, And will ye destroy a city 

wherein are two hundred believers? They answered, No. He said, And will ye destroy a city 

wherein are forty believers? They answered, No. He said, And will ye destroy a city wherein are 

fourteen believers? They answered, No. He said, And tell me, if there be in it one believer? They 

answered, No. He said, Verily in it is Lot. They replied, We know best who is in it. And when their 

dispute had become tedious, they said_, O Abraham, abstain from this _disputation_; for the 

command of thy Lord hath come _for their destruction_, and a punishment not [to be] averted is 

coming upon them.     (xi. 72-78.)   And when Our decree for _the destruction of the people of Lot_ 

came [to be executed], We turned them (_that is, their cities_) upside-down; _for Gabriel raised 

them to heaven, and let them fall upside-down to the earth_;[213] and We rained upon them 

stones of baked clay, sent one after another, marked with thy Lord, _each with the name of him 

upon whom it should be cast_: and they [are] not far distant from the offenders; _that is, the stones 

are not, or the cities of the people of Lot were not, far distant from the people of Mekkeh_.     (xi. 

84.)   And [Abraham] said [after his escape from Nimrod], Verily I am going unto my Lord, who will 

direct me _unto the place whither He hath commanded me to go, namely, Syria. And when he had 

arrived at the Holy Land, he said_, O my Lord, give me _a son_ [who shall be one] of the 

righteous. Whereupon We gave him the glad tidings of a mild youth. And when he had attained to 

the age when he could work with him (_as some say, seven years; and some, thirteen_), he said, 

O my child, verily I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee (_and the dreams of prophets 

are true; and their actions, by the command of God_); therefore consider what thou seest 

advisable _for me to do_. He replied, O my father, do what thou art commanded: thou shalt find 

me, if God please, [of the number] of the patient. And when they had resigned themselves, and he 

had laid him down on his temple, _in_ [the valley of] _Mind, and had drawn the knife across his 

throat_ (_but it produced no effect, by reason of an obstacle interposed by the divine power_), We 

called unto him, O Abraham, thou hast verified the vision. Verily thus do We reward the well-doers. 

Verily this was the manifest trial. And We ransomed him _whom he had been commanded to 

sacrifice_ (_and he was Ishmael_ [Isma'eel] _or Isaac; for there are two opinions_)[214] with an 

excellent victim, _a ram from Paradise, the same that Abel had offered: Gabriel_ (_on whom be 



peace!_) _brought it, and the lord Abraham sacrificed it, saying, God is most great!_ And We left 

_this salutation_ [to be bestowed] on him by the latter generations, Peace [be] on Abraham! Thus 

do We reward the well-doers: for he was of our believing servants.     (xxxvii. 97-111.) 

_Remember_ when Abraham said, O my Lord, show me how Thou will raise to life the dead.[215]-

-He said, Hast thou not believed? He answered, Yea: but _I have asked Thee_ that my heart may 

be at ease. He replied, Then take four birds and draw them towards thee, _and cut them in pieces 

and mingle together their flesh and their feathers_; then place upon each mountain _of thy land_ a 

portion of them, then call them _unto thee_: they shall come unto thee quickly: and know thou that 

God is mighty [and] wise.--_And he took a peacock and a vulture and a raven and a cock, and did 

with them as hath been described, and kept their heads with him, and called them; whereupon the 

portions flew about, one to another, until they became complete: then they came to their heads._ 

(ii. 262.)   _Remember_ when his Lord had tried Abraham by [certain] words, _commands and 

prohibitions_, and he fulfilled them, _God_ said _unto him_, I constitute thee a model of religion 

unto men.[216] He replied, And of my offspring _constitute models of religion_. [God] said, My 

covenant doth not apply to the offenders, _the unbelievers among them_.--And when We 

appointed the house (_that is, the Kaabeh_) to be a place for the resort of men, and a place of 

security (_a man would meet the slayer of his father there and he would not provoke him_ [to 

revenge],) and [said], Take, _O men_, the station of Abraham (_the stone upon which he stood at 

the time of building the House_) as a place of prayer, _that ye may perform behind it the prayers 

of the two rek'ahs_[217] [which are ordained to be performed after the ceremony] _of the 

circuiting_ [of the Kaabeh].--And We commanded Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], Purify my 

House (_rid it of the idols_) for those who shall compass [it], and those who shall abide _there_, 

and those who shall bow down and prostrate themselves.--And when Abraham said, O my Lord, 

make this _place_ a secure territory (_and God hath answered his prayer, and made it a sacred 

place, wherein the blood of man is not shed, nor is any one oppressed in it, nor is its game 

hunted_ [or shot], _nor are its plants cut or pulled up_), and supply its inhabitants with fruits 

_which hath been done by the transporting of Et-Taif from Syria thither, when it_ [that is, the 

territory of Mekkeh] _was desert, without sown land or water_,[218] such of them as shall believe 

in God and the last day.--_He mentioned them peculiarly in the prayer agreeably with the saying of 

God, My covenant doth not apply to the offenders._--_God_ replied, And _I will supply_ him who 

disbelieveth: I will make him to enjoy _a supply of food in this world_, a little _while_: then I will 

force him, _in the world to come_, to the punishment of the fire; and evil shall be the transit.     (ii. 

118-120.)   And _remember_ when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House[219] (_that 

is, building it_), together with Ishmael, _and they said_, O our Lord, accept of us _our building_; 

for Thou art the Hearer _of what is said_, the Knower _of what is done_. O our Lord, also make us 

resigned[220] unto Thee, and _make_ from among our offspring a people resigned unto Thee, and 

show us our rites (_the ordinances of our worship, or our pilgrimage_), and be propitious towards 

us; for Thou art the Very Propitious, the Merciful. (_They begged Him to be propitious to them, 

notwithstanding their honesty, from a motive of humility, and by way of instruction to their 

offspring._) O our Lord, also send unto them (_that is, the people of the House_) an apostle from 

among them (_and God hath answered their prayer by sending Mohammad_), who shall recite 

unto them Thy signs (the Kur-an), and shall teach them the book (_the Kur-an_), and the 



knowledge _that it containeth_, and shall purify them _from polytheism_; for Thou art the Mighty, 

the Wise.--And who will be averse from the religion of Abraham but he who maketh his soul 

foolish, _who is ignorant that it is God's creation, and that the worship of Him is incumbent on it; or 

who lightly esteemeth it and applieth it to vile purposes_; when We have chosen him in this world 

_as an apostle and a friend_, and he shall be in the world to come one of the righteous _for whom 

are high ranks?--And remember_ when his lord said unto him, Resign thyself:--he replied, I resign 

myself unto the Lord of the worlds.--And Abraham commanded his children to follow it (_namely, 

the religion_); and Jacob,_ his children; saying_, O my children, verily God hath chosen for you 

the religion _of El-Islam_;[221] therefore die not without your being Muslims.--_It was a prohibition 

from abandoning El-Islam and a command to persevere therein unto death._     (ii. 121-126.) 

_When the Jews said, Abraham was a Jew, and we are of his religion,--and the Christians said the 

like_, [the following] _was revealed_:--O people of the Scripture, wherefore do ye argue respecting 

Abraham, _asserting that he was of your religion_, when the Pentateuch and the Gospel were not 

sent down but after him _a long time_? Do ye not then understand the _falsity of your saying_? So 

ye, O people, have argued respecting that of which ye have knowledge, _concerning Moses and 

Jesus, and have asserted that ye are of their religion_: then wherefore do ye argue respecting that 

of which ye have no knowledge, _concerning Abraham_? But God knoweth _his case_, and ye 

know _it_ not. Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian: but he was orthodox, a Muslim [or one 

resigned], _a unitarian_, and he was not of the polytheists.     (iii. 58-60.)     _JACOB, JOSEPH 

AND HIS BRETHREN._   _Remember_, when Joseph [Yoosuf] said unto his father, O my father, 

verily I saw _in sleep_ eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them making obeisance unto 

me. He replied, O my child, relate not thy vision to thy brethren, lest they contrive a plot against 

thee, _knowing its interpretation to be that they are the stars and that the sun is thy mother and 

the moon thy father_; for the devil is unto man a manifest enemy. And thus, _as thou sawest_, thy 

Lord will choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of events, _or dreams_, and will 

accomplish his favour upon thee _by the gift of prophecy_, and upon the family of Jacob, as He 

accomplished it upon thy fathers before, Abraham and Isaac; for thy Lord is knowing [and] wise.--

Verily in _the history of_ Joseph and his brethren are signs to the inquirers.--When they (_the 

brethren of Joseph_) said, _one to another_, Verily Joseph and his brother _Benjamin_ are dearer 

unto our father than we, and we are a number of men; verily our father is in a manifest error; slay 

ye Joseph, or drive him away into a _distant_ land; so the face of your father shall be directed 

alone unto you, _regarding no other_, and ye shall be after it a just people:--a speaker among 

them, _namely, Judah_, said, Slay not Joseph, but throw him to the bottom of the well; then some 

of the travellers may light upon him, if ye do _this_. _And they were satisfied therewith_. They 

said, O our father, wherefore dost thou not intrust us with Joseph, when verily we are faithful unto 

him? Send him with us tomorrow _into the plain_, that he may divert himself and sport; and we will 

surely take care of him.--He replied, Verily your taking him away will grieve me, and I fear lest the 

wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him. They said, Surely if the wolf devour him, when we 

are a number of men, we shall in that case be indeed weak. _So he sent him with them._ And 

when they went away with him, and agreed to put him at the bottom even as late as the 

seventeenth century recording the fact that the husband was sometimes required to purchase his 

bride's exemption from this right.  At the early date of which we write, however, there is little or no 



information to be had about the peasantry; the monkish chroniclers mention them but rarely, and 

then unsympathetically. Popular literature, with its _lais, contes, fabliaux_, or rude dramas in which 

Jacques and Jeanne appear, did not yet exist. We may, however, guess from the barbarity with 

which they were treated how near to that of the brutes was their condition.  About the year 997, 

soon after the death of the glorious Duke Robert the Fearless, the peasants of Normandy began to 

murmur against the wrongs they had to suffer. "The seigneurs," they said, "only do us harm; on 

account of them we have neither gain nor profit from our labor. Every day they take from us our 

work animals for feudal services. And then there are the laws, old and new, and pleas and 

lawsuits without end, about coinage, about forest rights, about roads, about milling our grain, 

about _hommage_. There are so many constables and bailiffs that we have not one hour of 

peace; every day they are pouncing down on us, seizing our goods, chasing us away from our 

land. There is no guarantee for us against the seigneurs and their men, and no contract holds 

good with them. Why do we allow ourselves to be treated thus, instead of trying to right our 

wrongs? Are we not men as they are? Courage is all we need. Let us therefore bind ourselves 

together by an oath, swearing to sustain each other. And if they make war upon us, have we not, 

for one knight, thirty or even forty young peasants, active, and fit to fight with clubs, with pikes, 

with bows and arrows, yea, with stones if there be no better weapons? Let us learn how to resist 

the knights, and we shall be free to cut the trees, to hunt, to fish at our own sweet will; and we will 

do as we please upon the water, in the fields, and in the forests." They held secret meetings, and 

finally formed some sort of an organization. But the seigneurs got wind of their designs. The young 

Duke Richard sent for his uncle, Raoul, Count of Evreux. "Sire," said Raoul, "do not you stir a foot, 

but leave it all to me." He collected a force of knights and men at arms, and, informed by a spy of 

the meeting place of the peasants, bore down upon them suddenly and arrested all the 

ringleaders. Then came the punishment, the like of which was not uncommon, though the victims 

were more numerous than usual. Some were empaled outright; some were cooked before a slow 

fire; some were sprinkled with molten lead. Others had their eyes torn out, their hands cut off, their 

legs scorched; and of these victims the few who survived were sent back among their fellows to 

inspire terror.  One can well believe that these horrors and the ever present sight of those who had 

suffered from them kept the peasants in awe, as the old chroniclers exultantly tell us. The account 

as given in Wace's _Roman de Rou_ has in our eyes a pathos and a poetic grandeur far greater 

than the chronicler's enthusiastic record of the deeds of the great Norman dukes. With us the 

democratic spirit, or mere humanity, is so much stronger than with him that we read his lines with 

feelings of pity and indignation quite unforeseen by him. Is it not pitiful, this cry of the peasants? 

"Nus sumes homes cum il sunt,         Tex membres avum cum il unt,         Et altresi grant cors 

avum,         Et altretant sofrir poum."  (We are men even as they are, we have limbs and bodies 

like theirs, and can suffer as much.) One hears the echo of Shy lock's "Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath 

not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?" The feudal ages would have 

answered Jew and peasant alike with an emphatic "No!"  The barbarism in the suppression of this 

revolt is merely a typical instance of the prevailing cruelty of manners. It was not the peasant 

alone, regarded as hardly the same flesh and blood, to whom the seigneur was cruel. Let us look 

at a few of these famous knights, and first at the deeds of one notoriously wicked even in his own 

day. This was Foulques, surnamed Nerra, the black, Count of Anjou, and ancestor of the 



Plantagenet line. This same Foulques was twice married. His first wife, Elizabeth, accused of 

adultery--probably because he wished to get rid of her,--he disposed of by violent methods. One 

account reports that he had her burned alive; another, that he had her thrown over a precipice; 

and as she survived this, he, scandalized by her refusal to die in this more picturesque fashion, 

stabbed her himself. One is reminded of Nero, that most cheerful of the Roman murderer-

emperors, who contrived an elaborate machine to drown his mother, and, when she swam ashore, 

was so irritated by the failure of his scheme that he had her summarily decapitated. Foulques's 

second wife was so ill used that she fled to the Holy Land. The pious count once burned down the 

church of Saint-Florent at Saumur, calling out to the saint: "Let me burn your old church here, and 

I'll build you a far finer one in Angers." And later he did build a huge abbey, which no one of the 

neighboring bishops would consecrate; but a judicious application to Rome, backed by a present, 

brought a cardinal to consecrate it; and the wrath of Heaven was shown, says the chronicler, for 

the new church was destroyed by lightning. At length the devout Foulques, who had made two 

previous pilgrimages to the Holy Land, was so smitten by remorse that he undertook a third. When 

he arrived at Jerusalem he had himself tied to a hurdle and dragged through the streets, while two 

of his servants flogged him, and he cried out at every blow: "Have mercy, O Lord, on the perjured 

traitor, Foulques!" We are not told--but it is probable--that the servants who did the flogging either 

did not survive very long, or else were wise enough to flog very gently. Foulques, however, died 

on his way back from Jerusalem.  Then there is the story of the chatelaine of the magnificent 

castle of Ivri, Alberede, or Aubree, wife of Raoul, Count of Evreux, half-brother of Richard I. She 

employed Lanfred, the most accomplished architect of the time, who had built the strong castle of 

Ponthiviers (about 1090), to build the castle of Ivri, stronger and more cunningly devised than any 

other. When he had finished, in order that he might build no better castle, or might not reveal the 

secrets of the fortifications of Ivri, she had his head cut off. But Count Raoul was a prudent man, 

and took the hint. He had Alberede executed too.  One Norman gentleman, Ascelin de Goel, 

having had the good luck to capture his feudal lord, held him for ransom; and in order that he 

might be encouraged to pay more, had him exposed at an open north window, in his shirt, and 

poured cold water over him, that the winter winds might freeze it. And even the mild and saintly 

King Robert, in his war against the Duke of Burgundy, laid waste the country far and wide, 

massacred defenceless peasants, and did not spare even monasteries and churches, since 

peasants and monasteries alike were regarded as but the goods of the duke, which it was his right 

to destroy.  The Church had some redress for the evils suffered. The pious and superstitious king 

was tormented nearly all his life by the threats of eternal damnation which the Church held over 

him. This brings us to a consideration of the influence of the Church upon manners in general and 

upon the condition of women.  Though there were many ambitious, greedy, and cruel priests; 

though many of them lived in open defiance of the Church's prohibition of marriage among the 

clergy,--there were several married bishops at an earlier period, and one of these, the Bishop of 

Dole, actually plundered his church to dower his daughters,--the Church as a whole 

unquestionably stood for the best in manners and in morals. After Charlemagne's vain attempts to 

revive popular education, what learning there was existed only among the clergy. Though 

themselves forming part of the feudal nobility and holding fiefs for which they owed military 

service, the bishops, abbots, and priors almost always espoused the cause of the weak and the 



oppressed. Within the precincts of the church the poor fugitive from violence done in the name of 

justice was offered sanctuary, and the right of sanctuary was usually respected.  Within the walls 

of the monastery women were offered safety. There were many, of course, who might choose the 

quiet and the comparative ease of the cloister life from motives little better than worldly, and others 

who might enter with sentiments of romantic devoutness which it is hard for most of us to 

appreciate in this day; and both were doubtless satisfied with what they found in the convent. But 

there were many others who had been forced into a life absolutely distasteful to them and alien to 

their temperaments. How many of these withered away in discontent! how many revolted more 

actively and led lives that brought reproach and disgrace upon the Church! Among the earliest of 

the satires against social abuses we find those against hypocritical, avaricious, gluttonous, or 

licentious monks and nuns; and the stream of satire runs throughout the Middle Ages. Monks live 

in the _pays de Cocagne_, to gain admittance to which one had to wallow seven years in filth; 

monks and nuns are in Rabelais's _Abbe de Theleme_, and _en leur reigle n'estoit que ceste 

clause: fais ce que vouldra_; and monks and nuns again play anything but edifying roles in the 

_fabliaux_ and their successors, the short tales such as one finds in the _Cent Nouvelles 

Nouvelles_.  Monasteries for women abounded all over France, most of them under some form of 

the Benedictine rule. Within their own monasteries women could govern themselves, though the 

whole convent was usually dependent upon male ecclesiastical control, either attached to a 

neighboring monastery, or under the jurisdiction of a bishop. In the great double monastic 

community of Fontevrault, established about noo by Robert d'Arbrissel, women were exalted 

above men; the nuns sang and prayed, the monks worked, and the entire establishment was 

under the guidance of the abbess.  The abbess or prioress occupied a position of responsibility 

and dignity not unlike that of the chatelaine. She too had the control of a large domestic 

establishment, and she was responsible not only for religious discipline but for the temporal 

provision for her nuns. The abbess had the power of a bishop within the limits of her convent, and 

bore a crosier as the sign of her rank. She might even hold some feudal tenure in the name of her 

convent. She drew revenues from her holdings and was in every sense the executive head of her 

house. At first--always under some of the stricter rules--the abbess carried on business outside the 

convent through some male agent. Greater freedom undoubtedly prevailed at times, however, and 

the rule against her leaving the convent was ignored. She was in some cases appointed, but 

usually elected from among the nuns, though cases are found, of course, where the abbess was 

the mere creature of some powerful lay or ecclesiastical authority. To become abbess of a 

nunnery was not considered beneath even a princess of the blood; and in some convents probably 

the same caste distinctions were observed as prevailed outside, and the nuns were nothing more 

than elegant retired ladies of birth and fashion.  The abbess appointed her subordinates, who 

varied in number and rank according to the power of the convent. There was generally a sub-

prioress, second in authority to the abbess, and certain minor executive officers, whose duties 

were nevertheless important, such as the chaplain, the sexton, and the cellaress. The chaplain 

was in most cases a monk chosen to celebrate Mass for the nuns, since women were not allowed 

to become actual priests; but in some cases the officer called the chaplain was a nun, whether or 

not she could officiate in all capacities. The sexton was a nun whose duties were to ring the bells 

for services, to keep in order the chapel, the altar, and the sacred vessels, and sometimes to act 



as a treasurer. The most interesting of these officers, however, and the one whose position must 

have been really most trying, was the cellaress. It was she who had general supervision of the 

commissariat. She was usually chosen upon the advice, if not by the election, of the whole 

community, and it was especially important that she should be a tactful person and a judicious 

manager. As housekeeper of the establishment, she had to control the servants and to satisfy the 

nuns. In providing food and drink for the household, she had to manage receipts and 

disbursements of considerable amounts. Very frequently a farm was attached to the nunnery, or 

there were several farms whose produce was to be used for the support of the institution. For 

whatever was bought or sold the cellaress had to make an accounting. With the proceeds of her 

sales or of the rent of the farms under her control, or with the money allowed her, she had to buy 

such provisions as were needed: grain, flesh, fish,--usually a very large item, especially in the 

Lenten season,--condiments, such as preserved fruits, spices, salt, etc., and, where the rule did 

not utterly forbid it, wine or ale. Of these details we shall speak more fully in connection with the 

rules for a model nunnery which Abelard wrote for Heloise and upon which she based her 

government of the famous monastery of the Paraclete.  [Illustration 2: DROIT DU SEIGNEUR. 

After the painting by Lucien Melingue. As feudalism meant oppression verging on slavery for 

Jacques Bonhomme, the peasant, his wife Jeanne could hardly have been in better case. With 

peasant marriages the seigneur could interfere even more tyrannically than with those of his 

feudal wards. In some places the bride and groom owed to the seigneur certain gifts called _mets 

de mariage...._ and that most infamous right known as the _droit du seigneur_ was claimed, and 

we find a writer even as late as the seventeenth century recording the fact that the husband was 

sometimes required to purchase his bride's exemption from this right.]  Aside from the protection 

they afforded to women who might otherwise have been utterly lost in the rough world, the 

monasteries were of great importance in other ways. Whatever it may have become during the 

period of the decline of monastic purity, the life in the nunneries, even in the comparatively dark 

period about the year 1000, was not an idle one. The day was carefully portioned off into periods 

of work, of religious devotion, and of leisure, which long custom fixed into a routine. The 

occupations included what we should now class chiefly as artistic work, though much of it was at 

the time really useful in a more homely way,--weaving of hangings and tapestries for the church, 

embroidery, painting and illuminating, and copying of manuscripts. This last was, of course, work 

of the highest utility, though the artistic skill displayed in the writing itself and in the beautiful 

illuminations made it also an art. We have few names of actual scribes of either sex, since they 

rarely signed the manuscripts they copied; but among these few there are some of women. The 

magnificent tapestries, sometimes large enough to cover in one piece the side of a church, are 

perhaps the most noteworthy of the products of the monasteries. So famous was the work of the 

nuns in this particular that tradition assigned to them, though perhaps mistakenly, the production 

of one of the most famous historical authorities for the Norman Conquest, the Bayeux tapestries, 

said to have been wrought for Bishop Odo of Bayeux by nuns under the direction of Queen 

Matilda.  Most important of all in the activities of the convent was education. At the time of which 

we write, the standard of learning in the convents was higher than one would think, and higher 

than it was some centuries later; for Latin was still used familiarly among some of the women 

educated in convents. The most famous instance of learning is that of the Saxon nun Hrotsvith, or 



Roswitha, of the tenth century, who wrote legends of the saints, dramas on the model of the 

comedies of Terence, and chronicles. There were other learned nuns, though none famous in the 

French literature of the time, all of whom gained their knowledge in convents; for it was in 

convents alone that women could ordinarily receive any education at all. One of the main 

purposes of the convent was to train young girls. Sometimes there was only such training as 

would fit them to became novices and eventually nuns, and the degree of education was of course 

determined in part by social standing; that is, a princess would be more carefully trained than a 

mere demoiselle; but some convents became famous schools, where education was given for its 

own sake, not merely to train those who meant to become nuns. In many cases, children of both 

sexes were taught, and girls and boys together learned Latin. In the romance of _Flore et 

Blancheflore_, the hero recalls how he and Blancheflore loved when they were children at school, 

"and told each other of our love in Latin, and none understood us." But the girls were probably 

better educated, in our sense of the word, than the boys; for teaching a boy to avoid breaking 

Priscian's head was then less necessary than teaching him to break that of his opponent in battle. 

Leaving the convents out of the question, the Church helped the cause of woman and of humanity 

by its constant endeavor to repress violence. About the year 1030 France was afflicted by a 

succession of bad crops, resulting, together with the constant waste and ravages of petty wars, in 

the most frightful famine. The people in their misery became almost inhuman; men died in such 

multitudes that it was impossible to bury them, and the wolves fed on their flesh; human flesh was 

actually offered for sale in the market of Tournus; and one monster, near Macon, living as a 

hermit, enticed unwary travellers into his den and there slew and devoured them! When found out 

he had a pile of forty-eight human skulls, those of his victims. In the midst of this horrible state of 

affairs the bishops and abbots of all parts of France met in council and decreed punishment upon 

whoever should carry arms, and upon whoever should use violence against defenceless persons, 

merchants, monks, and women; not even the refuge of the altar was to protect him who disobeyed 

this decree. Raising their hands to heaven all those present cried out, _Pax! pax! pax!_ in witness 

of the eternal peace compact, the _Paix de Dieu_--the Peace of God. Wars had caused much of 

their distress, and the kingdom was indeed weary of war, but the millennium had not yet come,--

philosophers still tell us that it is "just beyond the sky line,"--and the Peace of God was ineffective. 

Failing to suppress war, the Church next sought, with more practical wisdom, to modify its horrors. 

In 1041 was proclaimed the _Treve de Dieu_--the Truce of God. All private feuds were to cease 

during the period from Wednesday evening to Monday morning, under penalty of fine, banishment, 

and exclusion from Christian communion. Then the days of the great feasts were included in the 

period of truce, as well as Advent and Lent. "Churches and unfortified cemeteries," says the 

chronicler Ranulph Glaber, "as well as the persons of all clerks and monks, provided they did not 

carry arms, were put under the perpetual protection of the Truce of God. For the future, when 

making war upon the seigneur, men were forbidden to kill, to mutilate, or to carry off as captives 

the poor people of the country, or to destroy maliciously implements of labor and crops." This last 

provision in particular is very interesting. Of course, powerful barons broke the truce again and 

again; but it was there as a real moral force of restraint, and the Church did not forget to contend 

for its observance, so that it must have had some effect. To no class in society could peace have 

been more welcome, more essential, than to women, always the sufferers in war.  We have left to 



the last one most important question in considering the moral influence of the Church. Surely, the 

sanctity of the marriage tie is one of the foundation stones of morality and of civilization; upon it 

rests the home, where woman has always found her greatest and surest happiness. The Church 

had been struggling for centuries, and was to struggle some time longer, to make effective its 

opposition to marriage among the clergy. Among the secular priests, those not connected with a 

monastic order, marriage or concubinage had not by any means ceased, and we find even 

bishops leading scandalous lives. But the Church continued to fulminate its decrees, and the evil 

grew slowly less and less, till it existed only among the lower orders of the clergy and in out-of-the-

way places. Monks and nuns alike took the three vows of poverty, of chastity, and of obedience. 

We are not concerned with the general question of whether or not priests should be married, or 

whether or not it is wisdom to force the observance of a vow of perpetual chastity upon young men 

and women who may have taken such a vow without duly considering their own temperaments, or 

who have been compelled to take it against their wills. Despite the scandals,--scandal has always 

a noisy tongue,--there should be no doubt that in the great majority of cases the vow of chastity 

was sincerely kept. Within its own limits the Church discouraged and was soon utterly to forbid 

marriage; what did it do to sanctify and to protect marriage outside of the ranks of the clergy? 

Marriage was made one of the seven great sacraments of the Church, and the breach of the 

marriage tie was one of the sins most severely punished. Adultery had been severely punished 

under the customary laws of the Franks, usually by the death of both parties with frightful tortures; 

and the Church added to the physical punishment inflicted by the civil law in this world the threat of 

eternal torments in the next. Nevertheless, according to the testimony of many who are satirists 

and of some who are not, it was the unmarried priest who was the most frequent offender. An 

anecdote will illustrate the prevailing looseness of clerical morals. Wace tells us that a sacristan of 

Saint-Ouen, in Rouen, fell in love with a lady who lived across the little river Robec. As he was 

stealing across to meet her one dark night, his foot slipped on the plank by which he was crossing 

the stream, and he tumbled therein and was drowned. A devil was just about to pitchfork his soul 

and carry it off when an angel appeared, contending that the sacristan had not yet committed the 

sin. The case was submitted to Duke Richard, who ordered that the soul should be returned to the 

body, and that he would then judge according to the sacristan's actions. Presto! it was done; and 

the monk, his ardor cooled by the ducking, went back to his abbey and confessed to the abbot. A 

popular proverb makes the story survive: "Sir monk, step lightly, and take good care when you 

cross the plank." Not only in the Church, but in the world, immorality was too common and too 

easily pardoned. It is significant that illegitimacy was the rule rather than the exception among the 

Norman dukes, and that William the Conqueror, himself illegitimate, was conspicuous in his age 

for marital fidelity.  The moral theory of the Church was correct enough, however it failed in 

practice. Every precaution was taken--indeed, too many were taken--to prevent hasty and ill-

assorted marriages. The banns had to be read three times in the church; the contracting parties 

must be of proper age; they must have the consent of parent or guardian; they must not be related 

within the degrees prohibited by the Church; they must not be bound by any previous vow of 

chastity or be guilty of any mortal sin.  These provisions would seem to be in the main wise 

enough, and yet out of one of them grew a considerable moral evil. Divorce had been recognized 

by the Salic law: "Seeing that discord troubles their union, and that charity reigns not in it, N. and 



M., husband and wife, have agreed to separate and to leave each other free either to retire to a 

monastery or to remarry," without question or opposition from either party. So ran one of the 

formulas; and as a sign of the divorce the keys of the house were taken from the wife, or a piece 

of linen was torn before her. The Church, however, opposed divorce, and declared it contrary to 

the spirit of Christianity. Yet, if one were wealthy or powerful, it was easy to have a marriage 

annulled, on one pretext or another. The most frequent was the plea for divorce for reasons of 

conscience, since the contracting parties, being within the prohibited degrees of relationship,--a 

fact which they had not known at the time of the marriage,--were guilty of incest in the eyes of the 

Church, and prayed to be relieved from the danger of perilling their immortal souls by deadly sin. 

Other pleas were resorted to, but this seems to have been a favorite one. By a subtile division of a 

hair "'twixt south and southwest side," this might be considered as not divorce, but the mere 

annulment of a contract which had been illegal and unsanctified from the start; and the distinction 

was an important one, since the rich noble or the monarch who had disposed of an objectionable 

wife in this way, and who had absolved himself by proper penances and by sufficient gifts to the 

Church, might, and generally did, remarry.  It is with the story of a divorce or forced separation that 

we are concerned in the case of Queen Bertha. Robert, the son of Hugues Caput, and the first real 

king of the Capetian line, was a devoted friend of Eudes, Count of Champagne and Blois, who 

proudly styles himself, in his charters, _Comes Ditissimus_,--richest count of France,--and whom 

Robert had honored with the title of count or seneschal of the royal palace. This Eudes had a 

beautiful and virtuous wife, Bertha, daughter of King Conrad the Pacific of Aries, and descended 

from the great Emperor Henry, the Fowler. Robert, then married to a princess named Rosella, was 

godfather to one of the children of Eudes and his fair cousin Bertha. Both Princess Rosella and the 

Comes Ditissimus died. Bertha and Robert already loved each other, it would seem, since neither 

mourned very long. Within a few months they were married, in spite of the protests of Hugues 

Capet, who would have liked a more powerful alliance for his son and heir. Although Bertha and 

Robert were cousins, it was only in the fourth degree. This actual relationship, though within the 

proscribed degrees, would have been overlooked probably, as well as the spiritual relationship 

established by Robert's having stood godfather to one of Bertha's children, had it not been for the 

prince's ill luck in incurring the enmity of certain powerful and active churchmen. Archambaud, 

Archbishop of Tours, had issued a special dispensation, and had blessed the marriage in the 

presence and with the consent of several other bishops. But to understand fully the violent 

opposition which the marriage encountered from the papal party we must go back to an episode in 

the reign of Hugues Capet.  In the course of the last effort of Carl, the heir of the Carlovingian line, 

to recover dominion, the Archbishop of Rheims had betrayed Hugues Capet, and had agreed to 

introduce Carl's forces into Rheims. It was proved that this man, Arnoul, or Arnulph, had 

surrendered the keys of the city to the emissaries of Carl, and he himself confessed his guilt. 

Accordingly, with the sanction of an 


_
the well, _they did so_.[222] _They pulled off his shirt, after they had beaten him and had treated 

him with contempt and had desired to slay him; and they let him down; and when he had arrived 

half-way down the well they let him fall, that he might die; and he fell into the water. He then 

betook himself to a mass of rock; and they called to him; so he answered them, imagining that 

they would have mercy upon him. They however desired to crush him with a piece of rock; but 

Judah prevented them._ And We said unto him by revelation, _while he was in the well (and he 

was seventeen years of age, or less), to quiet his heart_, Thou shalt assuredly declare unto them 

this their action, and they shall not know _thee at the time_.[223] And they came to their father at 

nightfall weeping. They said, O our father, we went to run races,[224] and left Joseph with our 

clothes, and the wolf devoured him; and thou wilt not believe us, though we speak truth. And they 

brought false blood upon his shirt. _Jacob_ said _unto them_, Nay, your minds have made a thing 

seem pleasant unto you, _and ye have done it_;[225] but patience is seemly, and God's 

assistance is implored with respect to that which ye relate.  And travellers came _on their way 

from Midian (Medyen) to Egypt, and alighted near the well_;[226] and they sent their drawer of 

water,[227] and he let down his bucket _into the well: so Joseph caught hold upon it, and the man 

drew him forth; and when he saw him_, he said, O good news! This is a young man!--_And his 

brethren thereupon knew his case; wherefore they came unto him_, and they[228] concealed his 

case, _making him_ as a piece of merchandise; _for they said, He is our slave who hath 

absconded. And Joseph was silent, fearing lest they should slay him._ And God knew that which 

they did. And they sold him for a mean price, [for] some dirhems counted down, _twenty, or two-

and-twenty_; and they were indifferent to him. _The travellers then brought him to Egypt, and he 

who had bought him sold him for twenty deenars and a pair of shoes and two garments._ And the 

Egyptian who bought him, _namely, Kitfeer_,[229] said unto his wife _Zeleekha_, Treat him 

hospitably; peradventure he may be advantageous to us, or we may adopt him as a son. _For he 

was childless._ And thus We prepared an establishment for Joseph in the land _of Egypt_, to 

teach him the interpretation of events, _or dreams_; for God is well able to effect His purpose; but 

the greater number of men, _namely, the unbelievers_, know not _this_. And when he had 

attained his age of strength (_thirty years, or three-and-thirty_), We bestowed on him wisdom and 

knowledge _in matters of religion, before he was sent as a prophet_; for thus do We recompense 

the well-doers. (xii. 4-22.--_Then follows an account of his temptation by his mistress, Zeleekha._) 

Then it seemed good unto them,[230] after they had seen the signs of _his innocence, to imprison 

him_. They will assuredly imprison him for a time, _until the talk of the people respecting him 

cease_. _So they imprisoned him._ And there entered with him into the prison two young men, 

_servants of the king, one of whom was his cup-bearer and the other was his victualler_. _And 

they found that he interpreted dreams; wherefore_ one of them, _namely, the cup-bearer_, said, I 

dreamed that I was pressing grapes: and the other said, I dreamed that I was carrying deprived of 

his see, which was given to Gerbert, the tutor of the young King Robert. The papal party refused to 

recognize the jurisdiction of the court which had deposed Arnoul, and which still kept him 

imprisoned at Orleans, and a special legate was sent to France to protest against this action at the 

very time of Robert's marriage to Bertha. The legate raised his voice in protest against the 

incestuous and sinful marriage. Thinking to appease him, Robert released Arnoul and restored 

him to his archbishopric; but to do this he had to depose Gerbert, and by so doing he made an 



enemy of one of the most active and able men in the Church, famous as a theologian, and 

afterward to become Pope Silvester II.  For a time, however, Bertha and Robert, who loved each 

other devotedly and lived in a simple piety quite in contrast to the licentious habits of the period, 

were left unmolested. The bribe to Rome was sufficient for the moment to purchase for them 

innocent happiness. Robert was most singularly devout, and was ranked almost as a saint by the 

ecclesiastical chroniclers who preserve his story for us. Though a handsome and well-formed 

man, and not altogether unfit for martial exercises, he delighted in pastimes rather befitting a 

monkish scholar than a soldier. He was gentle and kind to those about him, especially the poor 

and the unfortunate, and was devoted to music. He himself composed a number of Latin hymns 

for the Church, some of which are still retained, notably the sequence to the Holy Spirit, _Adsit 

nobis gratia_, and he set many others to tunes of his own composing. He was innocently vain of 

his powers as a musician and singer, and on a pilgrimage to Rome in after years, 1016, he 

deposited on the altar of Saint Peter his Latin poems set to music. The very graces and virtues for 

which his contemporaries praise Robert are the ones that make him manifestly out of place as 

King of France in the year 1000, and the misery of his domestic career is only more pitiful than the 

disorder which reigned in his kingdom. That one of the most pious kings of France should 

nevertheless have begun his career in opposition to the Church is very remarkable.  While Bertha 

and Robert were enjoying their brief respite from persecution, the papacy itself was struggling for 

existence.. At last the Emperor Otho fought his way into Rome, seized the leader of the popular 

party, John Crescentius, "Senator and Consul of Rome," and pitched him over the walls of the 

castle of Saint Angelo. The unhappy Pope, John XVI. was replaced by the emperor's nominee, 

Gregory V. Almost as soon as Gregory was seated he summoned a council (998), in which 

Gerbert, now Robert's bitter enemy, sat as Bishop of Ravenna. This council, largely controlled by 

the vindictive Gerbert, threatened the kingdom of France with a universal interdict, suspending all 

religious rites but those of baptism and extreme unction, if Robert would not repudiate Bertha. The 

decree commanded "that King Robert, who has, contrary to the holy canons of the Church, 

married his cousin, Bertha, shall forsake her at once, and shall perform a penance of seven years, 

in accordance with the rules and customs of the Church. If he obey not, may he be anathema! And 

so also be it as regards Bertha! That Archambaud, Archbishop of Tours, who consecrated this 

incestuous union, and all the bishops who sanctioned it by their presence, 


_
us with the interpretation thereof; for we see thee to be [one] of the beneficent.--He replied, There 

shall not come unto you any food wherewith ye shall be fed _in a dream_, but I will acquaint you 

with the interpretation thereof _when ye are awake_, before _the interpretation of_ it come unto 

you. This is _a Holy Communion until such time as they shall have come to Rome to make 

amends to the Holy See!"  One can imagine that, to a nature as devout as Robert's, such a curse 

was almost overwhelming. Yet he and Bertha endured for some time the horrors which this 

excommunication brought upon them, and Robert resisted 


_
Lord hath taught me. Verily I have abandoned the religion of a people who believe not in God and 

who disbelieve in the world to come; and I follow the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac 

and Jacob. It is not _fit_ for us to associate anything with God. This _knowledge of the unity_ [hath 

been given us] of the bounty of God towards us and towards mankind; but the greater number of 

men are not thankful. O ye two companions (_or inmates_) of the prison, are sundry lords better, 

or is God, the One, the Almighty? Ye worship not, beside Him, [aught] save names which ye and 

your fathers have given _to idols_, concerning which God hath not sent down any convincing 

proof. Judgment belongeth not [unto any] save unto God _alone_. He hath commanded that ye 

worship not [any] but Him. This is the right religion; but the greater number of men know not. O ye 

two companions of the prison, as to one of you, _namely, the cup-bearer_, he will serve wine unto 

his lord _as formerly_; and as to the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from off his 

head.--_Upon this they said, We dreamed not aught. He replied_, The thing is decreed concerning 

which ye [did] ask a determination, _whether ye have spoken truth or have lied_. And he said unto 

him whom he judged to be the person who should escape of them two, _namely the possess. The 

curse fell upon France, and upon its king and queen, who were surely no more morally guilty than 

their unfortunate subjects. Awful were the effects of the curse, according to Petrus Damianus, who 

records with pious unction most of the signs and wonders with which the age was filled. All save a 

few of the lowest servants fled from the accursed presence of Robert and his queen, and even 

these menials, when they had prepared the king's food, deemed the very vessels from which he 

had eaten polluted by his touch, and purified them by fire or destroyed them. Bertha was reported 

to be a foul witch, and to have the foot of a goose, and was nicknamed _la reine pedauque_, or 

_pied d'oie_ (Queen Goose-foot). In her agitation and misery, the child she should have borne 

was prematurely brought forth. The charitable Damianus tells us that it was currently reported to 

be of monstrous form, having the head and neck of a swan and not of a human being.  Whether 

these horrors were direct effects of God's wrath or had birth in the zealous imagination of a writer 

whose interest it was to lay on the colors in his description of the blasting effects of 

excommunication, Robert and Bertha had to resign themselves to the cruel separation. Robert's 

superstitious fears were worked on by his monkish advisers, particularly Abbo, 


_
unto him, In the prison is a young man imprisoned unjustly.--And he went forth._ But the devil 

caused him to forget to mention _Joseph_ unto his lord:[231] so he remained in the prison some 

years: _it is said, seven; and it is said, twelve._  And the king of _Egypt,[232] Er-Reiyan the son of 

El-Weleed_ said, Verily I saw [in a dream] seven fat kine which seven lean _kine_ devoured, and 

seven green ears of corn and _seven_ other _ears_ dried up. O ye nobles, explain unto me my 

dream, if ye interpret a dream.--They replied, _These are_ confused dreams, and we know not the 

interpretation of dreams. And he who had escaped, of the two _young men, namely the cup-

bearer_, said (for he remembered after a time _the condition of Joseph_), I will acquaint you with 

the interpretation thereof; wherefore send me. _So they sent him; and he came unto Joseph, and 

said_, O Joseph, O thou of great veracity, give us an explanation respecting seven fat kine which 

seven lean [kine] devoured, and seven green ears of corn and other [seven] dried up, that I may 

return unto the men (_the king and his companions_), that they may know _the interpretation 

thereof_. He replied, Ye shall sow seven years as usual: (_this is the interpretation of the seven fat 

kine_:) and what ye reap do ye leave in its ear, _lest it spoil_; except a little, whereof ye shall eat. 

Then there shall come, after that, seven grievous [years]: (_this is the interpretation of the seven 

lean kine_:) they shall consume what ye shall have provided for them, _of the grain sown in the 

seven years of plenty_, except a little which ye shall have kept. Then there shall come, after that, a 

year wherein men shall be aided _with rain_, and wherein they shall press _grapes and other 

fruits_.--And the king said, _when the messenger came unto him and acquainted him with the 

interpretation of the dream_, Bring unto me him _who hath interpreted it_.     (xii. 35-50.)   And 

when he had spoken unto him,[233] he said _unto him_, Thou art this day firmly established with 

us, and intrusted _with our affairs_. _What then seest thou fit for us to do?--He answered, Collect 

provision, and sow abundant seed king, in public and in, private." This holy man, says the 

biographer of Robert, "continued his reproaches until the good King acknowledged his fault and 

abandoned the wife whom it was not permitted him to possess." The separation seems to have 

taken place definitely about the year 1006, and Robert was to be miserable in his domestic life all 

the rest of his days.  He and Bertha had passed part of their married life together in the midst of a 

veritable reign of terror. All over Christendom the belief was general that the end of the work! was 

at hand. The lurid prophecies of the Apocalypse were supplemented by texts believed to be 

prophetic of the Judgment Day, raked together from all parts of the Scriptures and from what 

superstitious ignorance regarded as almost of equal authority, the Sibylline Leaves. Preachers 

took as their text the horrors of the approaching dissolution of the world, when, according to 

Revelations: "The stars of heaven fell unto the earth... and the heavens departed as a scroll when 

it is rolled together;" or in the magnificent words of a hymn written long after: _Dies irae, dies illa 

Solvet, saeclum in favilla: Teste David cum Sybilla_. (Day of wrath! O day of mourning! See 

fulfilled the prophet's warning! Heaven and earth in ashes burning!) They supplemented this 

picture by accounts of the torments of hell as reported in the legends of those who had been 

granted a vision of them. "Repent ye! repent ye! for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand. Woe unto 

him who in that day shall be found still a sinner!" There was naturally a paralysis of all useful 

activities. What was the use of preparing for the morrow, if there was to be no morrow? During the 

last year of the century the terror reached its highest point, and only absolute needs were attended 

to. There were great donations to the Lord on the part of tardy sinners who thought thus to 



purchase remission of their sins. But there were also those who refused to repent, and who 

resolved, since their life was to be short, to make it as merry as it could be. While the former 

crowded the churches, weeping and praying and surrendering themselves to the terrors 


_
store up the grain in its ear: then the people will come unto thee that they may obtain provision 

from thee. The king said, And who will act for me in this affair? Joseph_ said, Set me over the 

granaries of the land; for I am careful [and] knowing.--Thus did We prepare an establishment for 

Joseph in the land, that he might take for himself a dwelling therein wherever he pleased.--_And it 

is related that the king crowned him, and put a ring on his finger, and instated him in the place of 

Kitfeer, whom he dismissed from his office; after which, Kitfeer died, and thereupon the king 

married themselves up to the wildest dissipation. The year 1000 passed away, and still the stars 

were in heaven, and the wicked on earth began to breathe more freely; and when the next year 

went by without any Day of Judgment, courage revived, and the Church began to make use of the 

immense gifts which impulsive sinners had turned over to her. New cathedrals and new abbeys 

rose all over the land.  The pathos of the story of Bertha is heightened when we look at her 

successor on the throne. Even in her own day Constance, daughter of Guilhelm Taillefer, Count of 

Toulouse, was considered harsh and

Zeleekha, and she bore him two sons._[234] We bestow Our mercy on whom We please, and We 

cause not the reward of the well-doers to perish: and certainly the reward of the world to come is 

better for those who have believed and have feared.  _And the years of scarcity began, and 

afflicted the land of Canaan and Syria_, and the brethren of Joseph came, _except Benjamin, to 

procure one chronicler euphemistically expresses this when he says: "There was as much 

constancy in her heart as in her name." She probably came by her nature honestly enough, for her 

mother was Arsinda, sister of that Foulques Nerra of cheerful memory, who, indeed, according to 

some accounts, forced the weak Robert to marry his niece. She was, says the chronicler, 

surnamed Candida on
