Upon leaving the club, he paused long enough to remember that he was in no =
fit frame of mind to=20

risk an immediate meeting with his father. To make even a chance meeting im=
possible, he=20

crossed the street, and, passing through the Capitol grounds, strolled aiml=
essly out one of the=20

residence avenues until he came to the open country beyond the suburbs.  It=
 was quite late in the=20

afternoon when he re-entered the city by another street and boarded a troll=
ey car for the down-

town centre. The long afternoon tramp, and the conclusions it had bred, mad=
e it imperative for him=20

to see Gantry before the traffic manager should leave his office for the da=
y. His business with the=20

railroad man was purely personal. He meant to ask Gantry a few pointed ques=
tions requiring such=20

answers as friendship may demand. If Gantry's replies were such as he feare=
d they "Hold on! Hold=20

on!" he shouted with all the force of his lungs. "Back out!"  The two rower=
s obeyed the order=20

promptly, and backed water with all their might; and it was fortunate that =
they did so, or they would=20

have been caught in the swirl of the sinking vessel. Before they had retrea=
ted twenty feet, the=20

stern of the Fatime suddenly went down, with a mighty rush of the water aro=
und her to fill up the=20

vacant space inside of her, and then she shot to the bottom, disappearing e=
ntirely from the gaze of=20

the beholders, as well in the two boats of the ship's company that had aban=
doned her, as of those=20

on board of the Maud.  "That is the end of the pirate!" exclaimed Captain S=
cott, with a sort of=20

solemnity in his tones and manner, as though he regarded the fate of the st=
eamer as a retribution=20

upon her for the use to which she had been applied.=20


_
at once to a plain understanding with him.  The trolley car dropped him wit=
hin a square of the=20

railway station, on the second floor of which Gantry had his business offic=
e. The shortest way to=20

the Sierra Avenue end of the station building was through the great train-s=
hed. Half-way up the=20

platform Blount met the west-bound Overland steaming in from the eastern ya=
rds. At the Sierra=20

Avenue crossing the yard crew was cutting off a private car. Blount saw the=
 number on the=20

medallion, "008," and noted half absently the rich window-hangings and the =
polished brass=20

platform railings. A car inspector in "Amen!" responded Don at the window o=
f the pilot-house.  The=20

burden of his responsibility began to weigh upon his mind as Captain Scott =
witnessed the last=20

scene of the drama. But his thoughts were recalled to the present moment wh=
en he saw Louis and=20

Felix, the commotion of the water having subsided, pulling with all their m=
ight back to the scene of=20

the catastrophe.  The little boat had not been far enough away from the tur=
moil of the water to be=20

unaffected by it; and for a moment the puny craft had rolled and pitched as=
 though it would toss its=20

passengers into the bay. A skilful use of the oars had=20


_
long-handled hammer.  "Whose car is this?" asked Blount.  "'Tis Misther McV=
ickar's, sorr--the vice-

prisidint av the coompany," said the man.  Blount turned away, saying somet=
hing which the=20

hammer-man mistook for a word of thanks. So the vice-president had come, ha=
stening upon the=20

wing of occasions, it and Felix began to survey the scene of the uproar as =
soon as the waves=20

ceased the violence of their motion.  "Mazagan has gone to the bottom with =
her!" exclaimed Felix,=20

as he looked about the various objects that had floated away from the wreck=
 as it sank to the=20

bottom.  "Perhaps not," replied Louis. "He=20
