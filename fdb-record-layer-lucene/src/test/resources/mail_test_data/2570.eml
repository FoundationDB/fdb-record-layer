philodendron monstera we'll fix you up. It's a shame, the way your guardian=
 treats you. And your uncle can't be much better."  "Oh, he used to be kind=
 to me," said the unfortunate lad, "but I don't believe he knows how things=
 have gone with me. If I could find him I think he would take care of me." =
 "Well, maybe we can help find him for you," said Nat.  Little time was los=

has let his curse and wrath come down upon it.  "Thou shalt not commit adul=

Well, maybe we can help find him for you," said Nat.  Little time was lost =
in getting adultery and licentiousness, I take the Bible and see how God ha=
s let his curse and wrath come down upon it.  "Thou shalt not commit adulte=
ry. . . . For this is a heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punishe=

root out all mine increase. . . . By means of a whorish woman a man is _
to frighten them.  They prepared for a big hunt the next day. There was a l=
ight fall of snow, which=20

the Indian guide said would serve to enable them to track the game. They we=
re out early in the=20

morning on their horses, and were gone all day, keeping together. Jack shot=
 a big buck, and Bony,=20

to his great delight, brought down a fine mountain sheep, while the others =
had to be content with=20

jack-rabbits.  Budge had entirely recovered from the effects of the deadly =
gas, but he said he felt=20

too nervous to do any shooting, so he and tell you what I mean," I said; "t=
he man that comes into=20

my house and runs a dagger into my heart for my money, is a prince compared=
 with a son that=20

takes five years to kill me and the wife of my bosom. A young man who comes=
 home night after=20

night drunk, and when his mother remonstrates, curses her grey hairs and ki=
lls her by inches, is=20

the blackest kind of a murderer."  That kind of thing is going on constantl=
y all around us. One=20

young man at college, an only son, whose mother wrote to him remonstrating =
against his gambling=20

and=20


_
despite his name, was a poor shot, simply trailed along in the rear.  "I'd =
like to get another pair of=20

big horns for my room," said Jack toward the close of the day. "What do you=
 think, Long Gun,=20

have we time to go a little farther and try for a big ram?"  "Hu! Mebby," a=
nswered the Indian.=20

"Plenty sheep been here," and he pointed to where the animals had scraped a=
way the snow to get=20

at the grass and shrubs beneath.  Jack and Nat started off, while the other=
s made a temporary=20

camp and warmed some tea. They were to stay there until Jack and Nat return=
ed, which the lads=20

promised to do within an hour if they saw no signs of sheep.  They tramped =
on, having left their=20

horses in the temporary camp, Jack eagerly watching for a sign of a big pai=
r of horns.  "I guess I'm=20

not going to find them this time," he said as he mounted a pinnacle of rock=
 and looked about him.=20

"It looks like a good place, too," he added.  "Hark, something's post-offic=
e, and when he found that=20

they were from her, he tore them up without reading them. She said,  "I tho=
ught I would die when I=20

found I had lost my hold on that son."  If a boy kills his mother by his co=
nduct, you can't call it=20

anything else than _murder_, and he is as truly guilty of breaking this six=
th commandment as if he=20

drove a dagger to her heart. If all young men in this country who are killi=
ng their parents and their=20

wives by inches, should be hung this next week, there would be a great many=
 funerals.  How are=20

you treating your parents? Come, are you killing them? This sixth commandme=
nt follows very=20

naturally after the fifth,--"Honor thy father and thy mother." Don't put an=
y thorns in their pillows and=20

make their last days miserable. Bear in mind that the commandment refers no=
t only to shooting a=20

man down in cold blood; but he is the worst murderer who goes on, month aft=
er month, year after=20

year, until he has=20


_
There was a crackling in the bushes to Jack's right. He turned in that dire=
ction, his rifle in=20

readiness. Something was moving there. Was it a mountain sheep?  He raised =
his gun. A dark=20

object could be seen to be moving behind the screen of bushes, and the snow=
 on them was=20

shaken off.  Suddenly there stepped into view, not a mountain sheep, but th=
e figure of a lad, all in=20

tatters.  For an instant Jack and Nat stared at the youth. He had appeared =
so unexpectedly that=20

they did not know what to say. On his part, the lad stood there silent, as =
if he did not know what to=20

do.  Then Jack threw down his rifle and sprang forward, at the same time cr=
ying out:  "Bill! It's Bill=20

Williams! Well, how in the world did you ever get here?"     CHAPTER XXIII =
 ANOTHER NIGHT=20

SCARE   Will Williams, the strange, new boy, whom Jack the sod.  THE WORDS =
OF CHRIST.=20

Let us look once again at the Sermon on the Mount, that men think so much o=
f, and see what=20

Christ had to say: "Ye have heard that it has been said by them of old time=
, Thou shalt not kill; and=20

whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but I say unto you=
, that whosoever is angry=20

with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and wh=
osoever shall say to his=20

brother, Raca, (an expression of contempt), shall be in danger of the counc=
il: but whosoever shall=20

say, Thou fool, (an expression of condemnation), shall be in danger of hell=
 fire." "Three degrees of=20

murderous guilt," as has been said, "all of which can be manifested without=
 a blow being struck;=20

secret anger--the spiteful jeer--the open, unrestrained outburst of violent=
 abusive speech."  Again,=20


_
Washington Hall, now so far away, rushed forward.  "Jack Ranger!" he gasped=
, as if he could not=20

believe it.  "That's who I am," responded our hero. "But, Bill, what has ha=
ppened? You look as if=20

you were suffering."  "I am suffering," was the answer. "I'm almost starved=
!"  "Starved!" exclaimed=20

Nat. "Wobble-sided watermelons! And our camp just filled with good things! =
Come on, Bill. We'll=20

feed you up."  The two chums clasped Will successively by the murderer: and=
 ye know that no=20

murderer hath eternal life abiding in him."  Did you ever in your heart wis=
h a man dead? That was=20

murder. Did you ever get so angry that you wished any one harm? Then you ar=
e guilty. I may be=20

addressing some one who is cultivating an unforgiving spirit. That is the s=
pirit of the murderer, and=20

needs to be rooted out of your heart.  We can only read man's acts--what th=
ey have done. God=20

looks down into the heart. That is=20


_
"How did you get away out here? The last I heard of you was when I received=
 a letter and a=20

telegram from your guardian, asking me to send you home if I saw you."  "Yo=
u--you're not going=20

to--are you?" faltered Will.  "Am I?" Jack clasped his arm about the shrink=
ing form of the=20

unfortunate lad. "Well, I guess not! I'd like to have that guardian of your=
s here, for about five=20

minutes!"  "Petrified pancakes! So would I!" exclaimed Nat. "I'd send him o=
ver where that bad-

smelling spring is to spend the night. But, Bill, you haven't told us how y=
ou got here."  "I hardly=20

know myself," was the answer. "I did run away, just as Mr. Gabel told you, =
Jack. I couldn't stand=20

his mean ways any longer. He refused to let me go camping with you, and sai=
d I would have to go=20

to work, while school was closed for repairs, to make up the money he said =
I stole. I decided I=20

would come out West and try to find my uncle. He's out here somewhere, but =
where I haven't been=20

able to learn. I had a few dollars saved up, that I had earned, and I came =
as far as they would=20

bring me. Then I worked my way on from Chicago by jumping freights and by d=
oing odd jobs=20

whenever I got the chance. I heard, in a roundabout intentions that lead to=
 the transgression of all=20

God's laws.  Listen once more to the words of Jesus: "From within, out of t=
he heart of men,=20

proceed evil thoughts--adulteries--fornications--murders --thefts--covetous=
ness--wickedness--

deceit--lasciviousness--an evil eye--blasphemy--pride--foolishness. . . ." =
 May God purge our=20

hearts of these evil things, if we are harboring them! Ah, if many of us we=
re weighed now, we=20

should find Belshazzar's doom written against us--"Tekel--wanting!"    Seve=
nth Commandment=20

"Thou shalt not commit adultery."  An English army-officer in India who had=
 been living an impure=20

life went around one evening to argue religion with the chaplain. During th=
eir talk the officer said:=20

"Religion is all very well, but you must admit that there are difficulties-=
-about the miracles, for=20

instance."  The chaplain knew the man and his besetting sin, and quietly lo=
oking him in the face,=20

answered:  "Yes, there are some things in the Bible not very plain, I admit=
; but the seventh=20

commandment is very plain."  PLAIN SPEAKING.  I would to God I could pass o=
ver this=20

commandment, but I feel that the time has come to cry aloud and spare not. =
Plain speaking about=20

it is not=20


_
northern part of Wyoming, and so I came on. I've been traveling around now =
for two weeks, trying=20

to find him, and I've been living like a tramp, but I can't seem to locate =
him. I met some men who=20

said they knew him, but they acted so mysterious that I could get no inform=
ation from them. They=20

didn't seem to want to tell me where he was. So I decided to keep on until =
I found him. I've been=20

tramping all day, and when I heard you talking I thought maybe you were a p=
arty of hunters who=20

would help me."  "And so we consent banished from their public teaching all=
 advice, warning or=20

allusion in regard to love between the sexes," says Dr. Stalker. These them=
es are left to poets and=20

novelists to handle. In an autobiography recently published in England, the=
 writer attributed no=20

small share of the follies and vices of his earlier years to his never havi=
ng heard a plain, outspoken=20

sermon on this seventh commandment.  But though men are inclined to pass it=
 by, God is not=20

silent or indifferent in regard to it. When I hear any one=20
