dracaena marginata sorrowful is drawn off from the thought when we realise =

if he would, and yet not be a great doctor; these and other similar meditat=
ions got between him and his Welsh picture.  There was _
of his hopeless illness--"he goeth abroad, he telleth it." The tidings spre=
ad, and are stealthily=20

passed from one conspirator to another. "All that hate me whisper together =
against me." They=20

exaggerate the gravity of his condition, and are glad because, making the w=
ish the father to the=20

thought, they believe him dying. "A thing of Belial" (_i.e._, a destructive=
 disease), "say they, is=20

poured out upon him, and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more." And,=
 sharpest pang of all,=20

that among these traitors, and probably the same person as he whose heartle=
ss presence in the=20

sick chamber was so hard to bear, should be Ahithophel, whose counsel had b=
een like an oracle=20

from God. Even he, "the man of my friendship, in whom I trusted, which did =
eat of my bread"--he,=20

like an ignoble, vicious mule--"has lifted high his heel" against the sick =
lion.  We should be=20

disposed to refer the thirty-ninth psalm also to this period. It, too, is t=
he meditation of one in=20

sickness, which he knows to be a Divine  In his embarrassed way, he closed =
the door upon=20

himself, and only saw, in doing so, that she ecstatically took the present =
to her bosom and=20

caressed it.  The glimpse gladdened his heart, and yet saddened it; for so =
might she, if her youth=20

had flourished in its natural course, have taken to her breast that day the=
 slumbering music of her=20

own child's voice.     BARBOX BROTHERS AND CO.   With good will and earnest=
 purpose, the=20

gentleman for Nowhere began, on the very next day, his researches at the he=
ads of the seven=20

roads.  The results of his researches, as he and Phoebe afterwards set them=
 down in fair writing,=20

hold their due places in this veracious chronicle, from its seventeenth pag=
e, onward.  But they=20

occupied a much longer time in the getting together than they ever will in =
the perusal.  And this is=20

probably the case with most reading matter, except when it is of that highl=
y beneficial kind (for=20

Posterity) which is "thrown off in a few moments of leisure" by the superio=
r poetic geniuses who=20


_
it; but his attitude is that of silent submission, while wicked men are dis=
quieted around him--which=20

is precisely the characteristic peculiarity of his conduct at this period. =
It consists of two parts (vers.=20

1-6 and 7-13), in both of which the subjects of his meditations are the sam=
e, but the tone of them=20

different. His own sickness and mortality, and man's fleeting, shadowy life=
, are his themes. The=20

former has led him to think of the latter. The first effect of his sorrow w=
as to close his lips in a=20

silence that was not altogether submission. "I held my peace, even from goo=
d, and my sorrow was=20

stirred." As in his sin, when he kept silence, his "bones waxed old," so no=
w in his sorrow and=20

sickness the pain that could not find expression raged the more violently. =
The tearless eyes were=20

hot and aching; but he conquered the dumb spirit, and could carry his heavy=
 thoughts to God.=20

They are very heavy at first. He only desires that the sad truth may be dri=
ven deeper into his soul.=20

With the engrossment so characteristic of melancholy, he asks, what might h=
ave been thought the=20

thing he needed least, "Make me to know mine end;" and then he dilates on t=
he gloomy reflections=20

which he had been cherishing in silence. Not only he himself, with his hand=
breadth of days, that=20

shrink into absolute nothingness when brought into contrast with the life o=
f God, but "every man,"=20

even when apparently "standing" most "firm, is only a breath." As a shadow =
every man moves=20

spectral among shadows. The tumult that fills their lives is madness; "only=
 for a breath are they=20

disquieted." So bitterly, with an anticipation of the sad, clear-eyed pity =
and scorn of "The=20

Preacher," does the sick and wearied king speak, in tones very unlike the j=
oyous music of his=20

earlier utterances.  But, true and wholesome as such thoughts are, they are=
 not all the truth. So=20

the prayer changes in tone, even while its substance is the same. He rises =
from the shows of earth=20

to his true home, driven thither by their hollowness. "My hope is in Thee."=
 The conviction of earth's=20

vanity is all different when it has "tossed him to Thy breast." The prose p=
ains.  It must be admitted,=20

however, that Barbox by no means hurried himself. His heart being in his wo=
rk of good-nature, he=20

revelled in it.  There was the joy, too (it was a true joy to him), of some=
times sitting by, listening to=20

Phoebe as she picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrumen=
t, and as her=20

natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries.  Besides be=
ing a pleasure, this was=20

an occupation, and in the course of weeks it consumed hours.  It resulted t=
hat his dreaded=20

birthday was close upon him before he had troubled himself any more about i=
t.  The matter was=20

made more pressing by the unforeseen circumstance that the councils held (a=
t which Mr. Lamps,=20

beaming most brilliantly, on a few rare occasions assisted) respecting the =
road to be selected,=20

were, after all, in no wise assisted by his investigations.  For, he had co=
nnected this interest with=20

this road, or that interest with the other, but could deduce no reason from=
 it for giving any road the=20

preference. Consequently, when the last council was holden, that part of th=
e business stood, in the=20

end, exactly where it had stood in the beginning.  "But, sir," remarked Pho=
ebe, "we have only six=20

roads after all.  Is the seventh road dumb?"  "The seventh road?  O!" said =
Barbox Brothers,=20

rubbing his chin.  "That is the road I took, you know, when I went to get y=
our little present.  That is=20

_its_ story, Phoebe."  "Would you mind taking that road again, sir?" she as=
ked with hesitation.=20

"Not in the least; it is a great high road after all."  "I should like you =
to take it," returned Phoebe,=20

with a persuasive smile, "for the love of that little present which must ev=
er be so dear to me.  I=20

should like you to take it, because that road can never be again, like any =
other road to me.  I=20

should like you to take it, in remembrance of your having done me so much g=
ood: of your having=20

made me so much happier! If you leave me by the road you travelled when you=
 went to do me this=20



great kindness," sounding a faint chord as she spoke, "I shall feel, lying =
here watching at my=20

window, as if it must conduct you to=20


_
pardoned sinner, who never thereafter forgot his grievous fall, asks for de=
liverance "from all his=20

transgressions." The sullen silence has changed into full acquiescence: "I =
opened not my mouth,=20

because Thou didst it,"--a silence differing from the other as the calm aft=
er the storm, when all the=20

winds sleep and the sun shines out on a freshened world, differs from the b=
oding stillness while=20

the slow thunder-clouds grow lurid on the horizon. He cries for healing, fo=
r he knows his sickness=20

to be the buffet and assault prosperous end, and bring you back some day." =
 "It shall be done, my=20

dear; it shall be done."  So at last the gentleman for Nowhere took a ticke=
t for Somewhere, and his=20

destination was the great ingenious town.  He had loitered so long about th=
e Junction that it was=20

the eighteenth of December when he left it.  "High time," he reflected, as =
he seated himself in the=20

train, "that I started in earnest!  Only one clear day remains between me a=
nd the day I am running=20

away from.  I'll push onward for the hill-country=20


_
is assuaged, even while its force continues, by the conviction that it is G=
od's fatherly chastisement=20

for sin which gnaws away his manly vigour as the moth frets his kingly robe=
. The very thought=20

which had been so bitter--that every man is vanity--reappears in a new conn=
ection as the basis of=20

the prayer that God would hear, and is modified so as to become infinitely =
blessed and hopeful. "I=20

am a stranger with Thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were." A wander=
er indeed, and a=20

transient guest on earth;  It was with some pains that he placed before him=
self the undeniable=20

advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation for his senses from =
misty mountains,=20

swollen streams, rain, cold, a wild seashore, and rugged roads.  And yet he=
 scarcely made them=20

out as distinctly as he could have wished.  Whether the poor girl, in spite=
 of her new resource, her=20

music, would have any feeling of loneliness upon her now--just at first--th=
at she had not had=20

before; whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke=20
