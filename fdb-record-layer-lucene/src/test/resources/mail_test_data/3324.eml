n, and I believe do, in=20

such circumstances.  She delivered a very nice speech, which had been many =
times rehearsed in=20

her bedchamber, and on the pavement as she trudged to and from the house of=
 Mr. Jones, which,=20

as a daily governess, she was in the habit of traversing, and at other time=
s and places. Gratitude=20

was a word that thickly interlarded her periods. She said that she did not =
know how to accept the=20

proposal he made her, and, after a skilful pause or two, having come to the=
 conclusion that there=20

was no danger in a little delay (and, aside with the reader let me add, bec=
ome convinced that=20

there was no prospect of his withdrawing the offer), she craved time to con=
sider his most noble=20

proposal--not on her own account, because, if she was a selfish thing, he w=
ould see that she must=20

at once say yes--but because she scarcely felt equal interesting narratives=
 in history: and=20

doubtless the reader will be pleased to notice in detail the perils of the =
deep, and to learn of the=20

precautions taken and the means in common use for averting, as far as possi=
ble, the disastrous=20

results of the tempest. Certainly, the brave tars who peril their lives on =
the ocean to bring us the=20

luxuries of a foreign land deserve especial attention, and no apology need =
be given for devoting a=20

portion of this volume to the story of their perils and daring.     CHAPTER=
 IX.  PERILS OF THE=20

SEA.      =E2=80=9CDaughter, the night was made for sleep;      Why dost th=

 to the present,=20


_
such an elevation dazzled and bewildered her little brain.  This was the su=
m and substance of=20

Miss Thomson's speech.  The reader has already been informed that Mr. Green=
 and Miss=20

Thomson were married, and his imagination will supply the links in the narr=
ative between the last=20

interview and the realisation of that event.  During the almost monotonous =
life Mr. and Mrs. Green=20

lived, there would of course occasionally arise small vexations. Not that t=
hey quarrelled. Nothing of=20

that sort marred their happiness.  The vexations I speak of were of the mos=
t simple and ordinary=20

kind. A friend promised to come and dine with them, and did not keep that p=
romise. The=20

tradesmen were not punctual in the delivery of their goods. The wine-mercha=
nt occasionally=20

deceived Mr. Green, which caused him annoyance. The dressmaker or the milli=
ner was not so=20

exact as he or she ought perhaps to have been in executing Mrs. Green's ord=
ers. And those sort=20

of things annoyed the one or the other of them.  Another annoyance in this =
house arose from--

what Mr. Henry Mayhew has entitled the greatest plague in life--a bad serva=
nt. They had one or=20

two bad servants, and on several occasions Mrs. Green made the observation,=
 not, I think, quite=20

unique--a sort of remark, on the other hand, which had been made by other l=
adies, and I believe=20

will be the novelist have taxed their energies to portray the perils of tho=
se who go down into the=20

deep in ships. The ravages of the hurricane on shore are confined largely t=
o those portions of the=20

world unknown to the ancients; but the treacherous deep has been sung in ev=
ery age. We may=20

hardly choose which of the myriad wrecks to describe. St. Paul=E2=80=99s pe=
rilous voyage to Rome is=20

familiar wherever the gospel is preached; Jonah has furnished a comparison =
for the unlucky for=20

centuries; Virgil has sung of the perils of exiled =C3=86neas in his search=
 for a foreign home.  The sea=20

has dangers peculiarly its own, and likewise charms possessed by nothing el=
se in nature. Every=20

one may have heard of the little earnest woman who at her first sight of th=
e ocean sighed: =E2=80=9CAh--at=20

impossible to get a good servant.  However, one good servant was at last ob=
tained. She was a=20

young woman about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age. She was, to say =
the least about her=20

merits, somewhat pretty. I have heard her described as beautiful. When I la=
st saw her, I thought=20

her exceedingly beautiful. She was, moreover, by no means an illiterate gir=
l. She had received a=20

fair amount of education--a much better education than girls in her station=
 usually receive.  In=20

consequence of the superior manners of this girl she was admitted to a cons=
iderable share of the=20

confidence and respect of both her master and her mistress, and was allowed=
 an amount of=20

discretion in the arrangements of the household which is not usually given =
or permitted in such=20

cases. Mrs. Green contemplated, with her husband's approval, the extension =
of their=20

establishment by the engagement of a third servant, and elevating this youn=
g woman to the=20

position of a recognised companion to the lady.  Some time after this notio=
n had been formed,=20

there was discovered a new series of annoyances in the house of Mr. Green. =
A number of=20

portable articles of value were missed. How they went appeared one of the g=
reatest of all possible=20

human mysteries. Discovery seemed impossible, and the irritation of the hus=
band was excessive.=20

His wife, moreover, inveighed in the bitterest terms against the undetected=
 thief.  It was agreed=20

between Mr. and Mrs. Green to lay all sorts of traps. They did so, but did =
not succeed in fixing any=20

body with the crime.  The reader will imagine how such an affair operated. =
Not only did suspicion=20

begin with the lowest and end with the highest of the three servants in the=
 household, but it=20

embraced every one of the few friends who came to see Mr. or Mrs. Green; an=

portant factors in civilizations=20

ancient and modern. Greece was no longer supreme in power when her naval su=

gone; Rome was not mistress of the world till she became mistress of the Me=

changeful beauty, shine      Far down in the green and glassy brine.=E2=80=

When he first heard of it, he was frantic. He raved and he cursed, uttering=
 language such as his=20

wife had never heard from his lips before against some person or persons un=
known, and vowing=20

the direst vengeance against the offender. He declared that if he or she we=
