  =E2=80=98It is notorious that your preservation for long periods in such =
circumstances as burial in a peat bog, in the sand of the desert, and in th=
e frozen ground of cold countries.  Even _photography_ in the matter of ide=
ntity is not to be trusted. Though an important accessory to other evidence=
, it is often, and very properly, objected to by lawyers on the ground of b=
eing _
effectual resistance.  The Flemings, and the greater part of the infantry, =
shortly began to give way,=20

and take to flight from fear of the arrows,=E2=80=94and the men at arms soo=
n followed their example. The=20

genoese cross-bows also, having, in the preceding assault on the outer cour=
t of the castle,=20

expended all their bolts, had not provided themselves with a fresh supply, =
so that at this time of=20

need they made a very poor defence.  By these means, the English, without a=
ny great loss on=20

their side, soon discomfited the French, and remained victors oh the field.=
 The count de St Pol,=20

with others of his companions, made off without any regard to his honour, a=
nd, passing through St=20

Omer, returned to Therouenne.  In general, all those of his party who remai=
ned were killed, or=20

made prisoners. The slain were about sixty in number,=E2=80=94and among the=
m were the principal of the=20

french commanders, namely, the lord de Querecqs, sir Morlet de Savences, si=
r Courbet de=20

Rempeupret, sir Martel de Vaulhuon, sir Guy d=E2=80=99Juergny, and the lord=
 de Fayel.  Among the=20

prisoners were the lord de Hangestez[81], governor of Boulogne, the lord de=
 Dampierre[82],=20

seneschal of Ponthieu, the lord de Rambures[83], George la Personne, the lo=
rd de Givenchy, with=20

several other noble knights and esquires, to the amount of sixty or eighty.=
  When the battle was=20

concluded, and the English had taken possession of all the carts and engine=
s of war which the=20

enemy had brought thither, and had stript the dead, they returned to their =
town of Calais with their=20

prisoners, rejoicing in their victory.  On the contrary, count Waleran and =
those who had escaped=20

with him were overwhelmed with despair, and not without cause. On the third=
 day after this defeat,=20

the English marched out of Calais with the numerous cannons and other artil=
lery they had taken=20

from the French before Mercq, for the town of Ardres. They amounted to abou=
t five hundred=20

combatants; and as they had marched all night, thinking to surprise it, and=
 that it was weakly=20

garrisoned, they began their attack at the break of day, by placing ladders=
 against its walls, and=20

setting fire to different parts of it.  But through the vigilance and coura=
ge of two notable and valiant=20

knights who were in the town, sir Mansart de Boz and the lord de Lignes, th=
e English were=20

repulsed. At this attack and retreat, there were from forty to fifty Englis=
h slain, whom their=20

companions carried to a large house without the walls, and set fire to it, =
that the enemy might be=20

ignorant of their loss.  Confounded and dejected with their repulse and los=
s, they returned to=20

Calais, where, some of those who had been at the affair of Mercq having die=
d of the wounds=20

which they had received from the genoese cross-bows, they wanted to put the=
 genoese prisoners=20

to death, saying that their bolts and arrows had been poisoned.  The count =
de St Pol, who had=20

retreated to Therouenne, sent an especial summons throughout Picardy for an=
other assembly of=20

men at arms, in the hopes of retrieving his honour. The lord de Dampierre, =
sir John de Craon, lord=20

de Dompinart[84], sir Morlet de Querecqs, the lord de Fosseux, the lord de =
Chin, the lord de=20

Houcourt, and many other nobles, came to him numerously attended. The count=
 held many=20

councils with them; and it was determined to march to the frontiers of the =
enemy=E2=80=99s country, and to=20

harrass them by every possible means.  As they were preparing to put their =
intentions into=20

execution, the king of France sent orders to the count and the other nobles=
 not to proceed further=20

in this business, for that he had provided other commanders. In truth, he s=
ent the marquis du Pont,=20

son to the duke de Bar, the count de Dammartin[85], and Harpedanne, a knigh=
t of high renown,=20

with four hundred men at arms and five hundred others, to quarter themselve=
s at Boulogne, and=20

other places on the frontiers of the Boulonois. The count de St Pol was not=
 well pleased at this; but=20

he was forced to suffer, whether willingly or not, the talk of the public, =
as there was no other=20



remedy than to let the public talk on.  John duke of Burgundy was in his co=
unty of Flanders when=20

he heard of the great defeat of the count de St Pol before Mercq. He was mu=
ch vexed thereat, and=20

sent sir John de la Vall=C3=A9e, knight, in haste to Gravelines, and other =
places on that frontier, with=20

men at arms and cross-bows, to prevent the English from doing any injury to=
 them. The guard of=20

this country was also intrusted by the king of France to sir Lyonnet d=E2=
=80=99Arummes, who, night and=20

day, most diligently attended to it.  King Henry of England, having learnt =
from his commander at=20

Calais the brilliant success he had obtained over the French before Mercq, =
ordered an army of=20

four or five thousand combatants to be instantly raised. He embarked this f=
orce on board the=20

vessels prepared for it, and ordered them to cruise off Dunkirk and Neuport=
, and to disembark the=20

army at Sluys.  About three thousand were landed on the strand, and marched=
 along it about the=20

distance of a league to attack the castle of Sluys; but the garrison, in co=
njunction with the=20

inhabitants of the country, who were greatly frightened, defended it very v=
aliantly, and, what with=20

cannons and other offensive weapons, repulsed their enemies, killing about =
sixty,=E2=80=94among whom=20

was the earl of Pembroke, one of their leaders[86].  News was brought to th=
e English, that the=20

duke of Burgundy was marching a great force against them; on which they ret=
urned to their ships,=20

and then to England.  The duke of Burgundy, however, was not long before he=
 ordered a number=20

of men at arms to be collected under the command of the lord de Croy[87], a=
nd others his=20

captains, to defend his country against the invasions of the English. They =
assembled on the=20

frontiers of Flanders to oppose the English, should they again return to hi=
s coasts.  The duke also=20

sent an embassy to the duke of Orleans and the great council at Paris, to d=
emand men and=20

money to enable him to lay siege to Calais, for he was very desirous of it;=
 but he received a=20

negative to the request made by his ambassadors. The duke of Burgundy, on r=
eceiving this=20

answer, made preparations for waiting personally on the king at Paris, the =
better to expedite this=20

business; and for this purpose he went to Arras, where he held many consult=
ations with different=20

great lords, his vassals and dependants.                                   =
 CHAP. XXV.      JOHN DUKE OF=20

BURGUNDY GOES TO PARIS, AND CAUSES THE DAUPHIN         AND QUEEN TO RETURN=
=20

THITHER, WHOM THE DUKE OF ORLEANS         WAS CARRYING OFF,=E2=80=94WITH OT=
HER=20

MATTERS.   When the duke of Burgundy had concluded his business at Arras, h=
e set out on the=20

vigil of the Assumption of the Virgin towards Paris, accompanied by a body =
of men, to the amount=20

of eight hundred combatants, secretly armed. He stopped some days at the to=
wn of Louvres, in=20

the Isle of France, where letters were brought him, to say, that the king h=
ad recovered his health=20

from his late illness, and that the queen and the duke of Orleans were gone=
 to Melun, and thence=20

to Chartres, carrying with them the duke of Acquitaine, dauphin of Vienne. =
 Having considered the=20

contents of these letters, he went to bed and slept, but ordered his trumpe=
t to sound very early,=20

and left the town with all his men, and hastened to Paris to prevent the da=
uphin from leaving it. On=20

his arrival, he was told by the Parisians, that he was already departed aft=
er his mother, which was=20

true; upon which the duke, without dismounting or making any delay, trotted=
 through Paris with his=20

troops as fast as he could in pursuit of the dauphin. He overtook him betwe=
en Ville-Juive and=20

Corbeil, where the queen and the duke of Orleans were waiting dinner for hi=
m. With the dauphin=20

were his uncle by the mother=E2=80=99s side, Louis of Bavaria, the marquis =
du Pont, son to the duke of Bar,=20

the count Dammartin, Montagu, grand master of the king=E2=80=99s household[=
88], with many other lords to=20

attend upon him. There was in the litter with him his sister de Priaux, wif=
e to sir James de=20



Bourbon.  When the duke of Burgundy approached the dauphin, he made him the=
 most respectful=20

obeisances, and supplicated him to return and live in Paris, where, he said=
, he would be better=20

than in any other part of France; adding, that he was desirous of conversin=
g with him on many=20

points which touched him personally.  After this conversation, Louis of Bav=
aria, seeing the dauphin=20

was inclined to comply with the request off below the shoulder, presumably =
that a vaccination-

mark might not be adduced as evidence. A young woman was suspected. Several=
 women=20

deposed having seen a dusky-brown mother=E2=80=99s mark near the child=E2=
=80=99s navel. After steeping in pure=20

water a portion of the skin said to include the mark, and after washing, th=
e mark gradually=20

reappeared at the end of three days, perfectly distinct. It was recognized =
by witnesses and=20

produced at the trial as corroborative evidence. The accused was found guil=
ty.  In a case of=20

infanticide at Tarare, in 1884, the upper extremity of a f=C5=93tus was fou=
nd to have been=20

disarticulated after the manner of carving the wing of a fowl. This having =
suggested to Dr.=20

Lacassagne a cook as the author of the crime, she was speedily discovered a=
nd convicted. A few=20

years later an analogous case occurred in Florence and was reported by Dr. =
A. Montalti.  The=20

instrument used for mutilating the body may furnish a suggestion of identit=
y, to be dispelled or=20

affirmed upon further investigation. The mode of section observed in variou=
s instances has led to=20

the recognition of a butcher as the culprit. An expert would have but littl=
e trouble in distinguishing=20

the hacking and mangling of a body from the careful cutting and preservatio=
n of muscles and=20

blood-vessels in dissections made by medical students, whom the public, by =
the way, invariably=20

suspect in cases of mutilation. If it can be ascertained that the instrumen=
t used was operated=20

either by a left-handed person or by an ambidexter, such a fact may prove o=
f importance.=20

Sometimes the fragments are tied or sewn up in a package. The manner in whi=
ch the knot is tied=20

may indicate the occupation of the culprit. In one case the regularity of t=
he sewing revealed that it=20

was the work of a woman. Examination of the remains of clothing and of neig=
hboring objects=20

where the crime was committed may result in the identification of the victi=
m or of the murderer.=20

Indeed, it is the careful noting of trivial facts and their combination tha=
t is so valuable in all=20

investigations of this class. A compound fact made up of minor facts, which=
 considered severally=20

would possess but little value, may sometimes solve the puzzle in a case wh=
ere no single fact of=20

conclusive value is obtainable.  Having collected as much of the mutilated =
remains as possible,=20

the first step toward identification is to replace the pieces in anatomical=
 order, to note carefully=20

their correspondence or otherwise, and to ascertain whether the fragments b=
elong to the same=20

body or to two or several individuals. This is often a delicate and difficu=
lt matter, especially where=20

decomposition is advanced or where the horror has been pushed to its utmost=
 limits, as in the=20

case of a fratricide committed in France by several persons, who fragmented=
 the cadaver with a=20

saw and hatchet; boiled the remains and fed them to hogs; and, after crushi=
ng the bones with a=20

hammer, threw the fragments into a deep gorge. Again, the body may be divid=
ed into numerous=20

pieces, a hundred or more, and disposed of in widely different localities, =
as in a pond, a manure-

heap, a river, or a cesspool. The chopped-up remains of infants have been b=
oiled in lye and=20

afterward thrown into a privy or put in a barrel of vinegar. A mother has a=
lso been known to cook=20

with cabbage the dismembered remains of her six-months=E2=80=99 child and s=
erve it at a meal of which=20

both she and her husband partook.  Numerous counterparts of such cases happ=
ening in late years=20

could be cited where the object was to favor the disappearance of the cadav=
er, and in which the=20



establishment of the identity turned on the examination of some small part =
of the organism; the=20

uterus, the spermatic cord, the lobe of the ear, the hair, or the teeth fur=
nishing a positive=20

demonstration that led to judiciary results.  PUTREFACTION goes on very fas=
t in a corpse that=20

has been mutilated; but it is slower in parts which, on being separated jus=
t after death, have=20

become bloodless in consequence of the hemorrhage. After submersion the out=
ward signs of=20

putrefaction put a notable obstacle in the way of identification, and after=
 drowning the body=20

becomes rapidly unrecognizable.  Supposing it impossible to reconstitute th=
e cadaver in all its=20

essential parts, it is always possible, by following the instructions alrea=
dy given for examining the=20

skeleton, to infer from one or several parts of the cadaver the sex, age, h=
eight, and sometimes=20

pathological peculiarities of the victim. Examination of the skeleton and t=
eeth is of capital=20

importance in an investigation of this class. The indications furnished the=
reby having already been=20

touched upon, and being about all that we are justified in saying, it is on=
ly necessary to repeat that=20

many of the details relative to these special indications are so confusing =
as to suggest caution in=20

using the statistical tables of even high authority, as the observations th=
ey rest on are not of=20

sufficient extent to deserve confidence.  A survey of the head, limbs, trun=
k, and genital parts will=20

give the most useful indications. The HEAD, in fact, is the surest index fo=
r justice, and one that=20

lends promptness in the discovery of the assassin. Typical illustrations of=
 this occur in the Goss-

Udderzook case and in the recent example of the bomb-thrower, Norcross. In =
the case of a=20

woman murdered by her husband at Antwerp in 1877 and cut into one hundred a=
nd fifty-three=20

pieces and her remains thrown into a privy, the color of the hair, the lobu=
le of a torn ear, and the=20

uterus of a woman having had children furnished special signs that led to i=
dentity and=20

condemnation. Examination of the _brain_ and its membranes, though furnishi=
ng no very notable=20

characteristics in the matter of identification, may nevertheless be regard=
ed as a natural corollary=20

to that of the skull. Brain weight, which is greatest between thirty and fo=
rty years, 1,200 to 1,450=20

grams in man, 1,100 to 1,500 in woman, diminishes toward the sixtieth year.=
 It is said that the=20

diminution takes place a few years sooner in the opposite sex. The estimate=
d loss of weight in a=20

person of eighty years is admitted to be from 90 to 150 grams. Another sign=
 of age is the tendency=20

to degeneration found in the pineal gland, the cortical substance, the opti=
c and striate thalami, and=20

in the brain capillaries.  The state of the eyes, if not too decomposed, ma=
y still become a sign of=20

identity. For instance, the color of the iris, an arcus senilis, a pterygiu=
m, a cataract or an operation=20

for the same, an iridectomy, etc., are signs that occasion may utilize.  Th=
e TRUNK may show, as it=20

has in several instances, incised wounds that caused death before the mutil=
ation. Besides, the=20

organs therein contained may by their weight, dimension, and tissue alterat=
ion indicate the=20

progress of age and of degeneration. Modifications of the circulatory and r=
espiratory apparatus are=20

obviously characteristic. As age advances the only organ whose weight incre=
ases with the number=20

of years, the heart, may become hypertrophied or dilated; its coronary arte=
ries may undergo an=20

alteration; the pericardium thickens, and in fact arterial atheroma and deg=
eneration generally may=20

begin between thirty-five and forty years. It should, however, be borne in =
mind that these signs of=20

senility may come much later or even not at all. In a man of eighty-four ye=
ars Tourdes found no=20

notable tissue lesion; in another of one hundred and four Lobstein found no=
 trace of ossification of=20

the arteries of the trunk and upper extremities, and in Thomas Parr, aged o=
ne hundred and fifty-

two years, Harvey found absolutely no lesion of this kind. Although toward =
eighty years the heart=20



increases in weight in both sexes, the opposite has been observed in except=
ional cases. Placing=20

the average weight of this organ in the adult at 266 grams for men, 220 for=
 women, it will be found=20

that progress in weight gives toward the eightieth year an increase of 90 g=
rams for men and 60 for=20

women. Yet a case of cardiac atrophy is reported in a woman of eighty whose=
 heart weighed but=20

170 grams.  Diminished weight of the lungs becomes accentuated with years. =
Especially is this the=20

case after pseudo-melanosis and senile emphysema. The state of the lungs of=
 stone-cutters and=20

miners and various thoracic and abdominal diseases may likewise become sign=
s of identity. A=20

cirrhosed liver, an enlarged spleen, a senile kidney, and the like, are suf=
ficiently obvious in their=20


_
Burgundy, suffer my nephew the dauphin to follow the queen his mother and t=
he duke of Orleans,=20

as he has had the consent of his father for so doing.=E2=80=99  Notwithstan=
ding this speech, and many=20

others that were urged on the same subject, which for the sake of brevity I=
 omit, the duke of=20

Burgundy caused the litter of the dauphin to be turned about, and brought h=
im and all his=20

attendants back to Paris, excepting the marquis du Pont, the count Dammarti=
n, and many more of=20

the household of the duke of Orleans.  These last galloped off toward Corbe=
il, where they related=20

to the queen and the duke of Orleans how the duke of Burgundy had made the =
dauphin and his=20

attendants return against their will to Paris. This intelligence alarmed an=
d astonished them,=E2=80=94for=20

they knew not what the duke of Burgundy=E2=80=99s intentions were,=E2=80=94=
insomuch that the duke of Orleans=20

left his dinner, which was quite ready, and went in haste to Melun, followe=
d by the queen and their=20

households.  The duke of Burgundy, as I have said, conducted the dauphin to=
 Paris; and the king=20

of Navarre, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the count de la Marche, with=
 many more great=20

lords, and an immense crowd of the citizens of Paris, came out to meet him,=
 and escorted him=20

most honourably into the town. The duke of Burgundy, however, and his two b=
rothers, as well as=20

the lords above mentioned, kept very close all this time by the sides of th=
e litter.  They rode on in=20

this state, at a foot=E2=80=99s pace, until they came to the castle of the =
Louvre, when the dauphin was=20

helped out of his litter by his uncle, Louis of Bavaria, and there lodged. =
All the lords then retired to=20

their houses except the duke of Burgundy, who likewise lodged there. He sho=
rtly after sent many=20

messengers to his different countries, to order men at arms instantly to at=
tend him at Paris. The=20

duke kept his state at the Louvre, in the apartments of St Louis, and in th=
ose underneath, which=20

formed part of them. The dauphin and his household were lodged in the chamb=
ers above them.=20

On the morrow, the rector and the soundest[89] part of the university came =
to pay their respects to=20

the duke of Burgundy, and to thank him publicly, with all humility, for his=
 great love and  Like the=20

trunk, the ARMS AND LEGS, in cases of the class under consideration, show b=
ut few traces of=20

disfigurement other than the fact of their having been disjointed. The mann=
er in which the sections=20

were made and the proceedings employed for the disarticulation would equall=
y affirm an=20

experienced hand or the reverse. Such facts have of late years assisted in =
the discovery and=20

condemnation both of a farmer and of a medical student, and also in the cas=
e of the cook already=20

mentioned, who cut off her child=E2=80=99s arm after the manner of carving =
the wing of a fowl. The=20

existence of deformity, injury, and disease in the limbs should, of course,=
 claim attention, but their=20

relativity in an investigation of the kind is too apparent to require furth=
er comment.  Mutilation of=20

the GENITAL ORGANS is not so common. Persons familiar with border warfare h=
ave observed=20

the savage custom of cutting off the victim=E2=80=99s penis and placing it =
in his mouth. In more civilized=20

communities the culprits are generally women in whom hatred and ferocity pr=
ompt an act that=20

marks the evident satisfaction sought by the destructive instinct. Sometime=
s, however, the genital=20

organs have been cut from the cadaver of a woman, presumably for the purpos=
e of concealing=20

traces of rape that may have preceded the murder. The signs furnished by th=
e female genital=20

organs as to virginity, maternity, and the menopause are so easily demonstr=
ated at the necropsy=20

as to become positive proofs of identity. The uterus loses both in size and=
 weight with age. This=20

along with hard, atrophied, and germless ovaries attests the stoppage of me=
nstruation. The=20

question of identity may turn on the age at which menstruation ceases, as h=
appened in an action=20

of ejectment in the case of Doe on the demise of Clark _vs._ Tatom. The per=
iod known as change=20



of life, when the uterus and ovaries lose their function, though placed at =
forty-five and fifty years, is=20

quite uncertain. In spite of _averages_, menstruation is occasionally conti=
nued to seventy and=20

upward.[585]  The signs furnished by the genital organs of the male are of =
less importance.=20

Atrophy and diminished weight of the testicles and rarity or absence of the=

persevere in these his endeavours, notwithstanding any obstacles he might m=
eet with.  On the=20

Sunday following, the duke and all his people removed from the Louvre; and =

himself at his h=C3=B4tel of Artois,=E2=80=94and in the adjacent streets he=
 had strong fortifications made of=20

palisades and barriers, to prevent any annoyance from his adversaries. He a=
lso prevailed on the=20

king and the great council, that the chains in the Louvre, which had former=
ly been taken away,=20

should be restored, and affixed to the streets as they before had been. The=
 duke of Burgundy=20

gained much popularity with all the Parisians for having obtained this for =
them.  The castle of the=20

bastille of St Anthony was committed to the care of Montagu, grand master o=
f the king=E2=80=99s=20

household, on his making oath that he would not suffer any man to enter it,=
 but when the king=E2=80=99s=20

council was there assembled. The dauphin, by orders of the king and council=
, was placed under=20

the care of the duke of Berry.  The duke of Burgundy and his two brothers n=
ow presented a=20

petition to the king and council, of which the contents were as follows:  =
=E2=80=98John duke of Burgundy,=20

Anthony duke of Limbourg, and Philip count of Nevers, brothers, your very h=
umble subjects,=20

relations, and obedient servants, fully sensible, by reason and justice, th=
at every knight of your=20

realm is bound, after God, to love, serve and obey you. We feel ourselves n=
ot only obliged to do=20

you no harm, but held to notify to you personally whatever may be proposed =
against your honour=20

or advantage. In like manner are bound all those your relations who hold gr=
eat lordships under=20

your favour. We are, as we shall make appear, very sensible of this obligat=
ion,=E2=80=94for we are=20

subjects of your realm, as well as cousins-german to your blood.  =E2=80=98=
And I John, by the grace of God=20

and your favour, am duke of Burgundy, peer of the kingdom of France and dea=
n of the peerage,=20

count of Flanders and Artois,=E2=80=94and I Anthony, count of Rethel[90],=
=E2=80=94and I Philip, count of Nevers=20

and baron de Doussy,=E2=80=94and withal by the consent of you, our very red=
oubted lord, and with that of=20

our much redoubted lady the queen, and of all the royal family, has the mar=
riage been confirmed=20

between the duke of Acquitaine, dauphin of Vienne, your son, and the daught=
er of me, duke of=20

Burgundy,=E2=80=94and also that between the lady de Charolois, your daughte=
r, and Philip, count de=20

Charolois, my son. We have also been commanded by our late redoubted lord a=
nd father, at the=20

time of his decease, who then made us promise that we would inviolably pres=
erve our fidelity=20

toward you and your kingdom, which we shall wish ever to do during our live=
s.  =E2=80=98In order, therefore,=20

to prevent any of our actions from being suspected, which may bring down on=
 us the divine=20

indignation, it seems necessary that we declare what is frequently done con=
trary to your honour=20

and advantage, and principally, according to our judgment, in four points. =
 =E2=80=98The first respects your=20

person. Before you recovered from this last illness, by which you are not t=
he only one who=20

suffered, but all those who had a real affection for you, and whom you love=
d, suffered great=20

affliction on your behalf, seeing matters were transacted in your council a=
gainst your honour,=20

though coloured over with a pretence of being advantageous. Many unreasonab=
le requests were=20

made, to which, though you had given a denial, some of the members of your =
council have taken=20

on themselves to grant them, so that the requests, however unreasonable, ha=
ve been complied=20

with.  =E2=80=98You have, besides, neither robes, jewels, nor plate, becomi=
ng your royal state; and when=20

any small quantity is bought for use, it is very shortly after pawned. Your=
 servants have not=20

audiences from you, nor have they any profit. They are afraid of mentioning=
 to you such things as=20

we now state, and which so much affect your honour, although very desirous =
of so doing.  =E2=80=98The=20

second point regards the administration of justice throughout this realm, w=
hich was wont to excel=20

all other kingdoms in the ministring strict justice, which is the foundatio=
n-stone of your government.=20

=E2=80=98In former times, your officers of justice were chosen, after matur=
e deliberation, from among the=20

wisest of your subjects, who defended your rights, and did equal justice to=
 the lowest as well as to=20

those of the highest rank; but now your rights are greatly infringed upon, =
and daily diminished, by=20

which the people are very much oppressed.  of the body, especially after dr=
owning, is a formidable=20

obstacle to identification by likeness and general type of face. Pages coul=
d be filled with the mere=20

mention of the multiplied instances of mistaken identity of the living, man=
y of whom have been=20



punished because they had the misfortune to resemble some one else. How muc=
h more careful,=20

then, should be the medical examination of the remains in the progress of d=
ecay, with the=20

distortion and discoloration of the features, and the consequent change or =
destruction of the=20

peculiar expression of the countenance by which human features are usually =
distinguished and=20

identified.  Among the innumerable instances of mistaken personal identity =
and cases of=20

resemblance mentioned in history and fable, from the time of Ulysses down t=
o the days of Rip Van=20

Winkle=E2=80=99s dog Schneider, it appears that this animal is credited wit=
h more sagacity than man in the=20

matter of recognizing his master even after years of absence. Indeed, recog=
nition by animals may=20

be considered a proof of identity. Many persons can recall instances of the=
 kind, though perhaps=20

not so dramatic as the one of the dog in the Odyssey, who recognized his ma=
ster after twenty=20

years of absence and died immediately thereafter.  As a matter of fact, tim=
e and circumstances will=20

so alter resemblance as to account for some of these most striking proofs o=
f the fallibility of human=20

testimony that we see illustrated in chapters on mistaken identity. We easi=
ly forget the true image=20

of persons and things, and time promptly modifies them. The evidence of the=
 senses may be so=20

little trusted in this regard that father, mother, husband, and nurse may a=
ttest a false identity in the=20

case of their own children. A nurse has been known to testify to the identi=
ty of the severed head of=20

a woman whom thirteen other persons were sure they recognized from characte=
ristic signs, when=20

the supposed victim put in an appearance and thus attested her own existenc=
e. The head of the=20

unrecognized victim of this strange controversy is preserved in the museum =
of the Strassburg=20

Faculty.  In another case of historical notoriety in France, forty witnesse=
s on each side swore to=20

the personality; while in the celebrated Tichbourne trial no less than eigh=
ty-five witnesses=20

maintained positively, under the most rigid and scrutinizing cross-examinat=
ion, that a certain=20

person was Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichbourne, a baronet; at the same tim=
e a corresponding=20

number were equally unshaken in their conviction that he was a Wapping butc=
her, Arthur Orton.=20

Resemblances often bring about remarkable coincidences. A case is said to h=
ave occurred in=20

Covington, Ky., where two men met, each the double of the other in form, st=
ature, and feature,=20

each having lost a right leg, amputated at the knee, and each being blind i=
n the left eye from=20

accident.  Puzzle and perplexity are not confined to remarkable cases and j=
udicial errors; for so=20

many people are unskilled in correct observation that it is a matter of com=
mon occurrence for two=20

individuals to be mistaken the one for the other. The writer for some years=
 has frequently been=20

mistaken for a certain naval officer he is said to resemble, while the offi=
cer in question has become=20

so accustomed to being called =E2=80=9CDoctor=E2=80=9D that he answers to t=
he title without protest.  A case that=20

has of late been much quoted in the journals is that of Tiggs. What was sup=
posed to be his=20

mangled body was identified by his wife, and further identification was for=
thcoming from one of his=20

children and the employer of the deceased. The coroner had granted a certif=
icate for burial, and as=20

the hearse neared the door, to the surprise of all parties the real Tiggs e=
ntered the house and=20

gave a satisfactory account of his absence.  Most=20


_
managed, insomuch that many houses, castles and edifices, are falling to ru=
in. In like manner are=20

your woods destroyed, your mills out of repair, your rivers and ponds robbe=
d, and in general all the=20

revenue of your domains are become, from their great diminution, of scarcel=
y any value.  =E2=80=98The=20

fourth point concerns churchmen, the nobility and the people; and, first, i=
t is a well known fact, that=20

the clergy are grievously vexed, and suffer great losses, as well from the =
judges of the realm as=20

from men at arms, and several other descriptions of persons, who take by fo=
rce their provisions,=20

ransack their in the average human mind or in its use. So few people are sk=
illed in minute=20

observation that Lord Mansfield=E2=80=99s dictum regarding the =E2=80=9Clik=
eness as an argument of a child being=20

the son of a parent=E2=80=9D should be received with a certain degree of re=
serve, especially in the question=20

of identity from likeness after death. In Ogston=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CMedical=
 Jurisprudence=E2=80=9D a case is related of a=20

father who could not recognize the body of his son drowned at sea ten days =
previously. The=20

mother, however, identified her boy from the existence of two pimple-lookin=
g projections on the=20

front of the chest, which proved to be=20


_
themselves from further injuries, by which means they have scarcely a suffi=
ciency left to perform=20

the divine service.  =E2=80=98The nobility are frequently summoned, under p=
retext of aiding you in your=20

wars, and never receive one penny for their attendance or service; and to p=
urchase armour,=20

horses, and other necessaries for war, they are often forced to sell their =
properties.  =E2=80=98In respect to=20

your people,  As a rule, the changes in the face and countenance two weeks =
after death are such=20

that it is well-nigh impossible to establish identity from the features alo=
ne. Yet in exceptional cases=20

the external results of putrefactive decomposition have been so delayed or =
modified as to produce=20

very small changes in the features even after many years of burial. Bodies =
have been known to=20

retain a remarkable=20
