they had never seen an American before...and indeed the two bourgeois looke=

sat down, evidently for a long visit. They were typical specimens: one was =
noisy, fluent, slangy,=20

coarse, quite eloquent at times, a real Parisian of the lower classes, the =
kind which leaves its shirt=20

open at the neck over a hairy chest and calls itself proudly 'the proletari=

faced, vigorous country man from Bourgogne, the type that corresponds to th=

American, a kind of Emporian! He hadn't much to say, but when he did speak,=
 spoke to the=20

excitement over=20

 amenity (of a sort) which=20

which the Indians of the Orinoco call ana-curua, has been propagated since =

officer, who took us for Catalonian shopkeepers, and who supposed that trad=
e had led to the=20

missions. On seeing packages of paper intended for drying our plants, he sm=
iled at our simple=20

ignorance. "You come," said he, "to a country where this kind of merchandis=
e has no sale; we=20
