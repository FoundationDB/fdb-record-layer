the form of the receipt he was to take for it.  The clergyman advised that =
the money should be laid=20

out under the guidance of Messrs. Seal and Delivery, highly respectable sol=
icitors in the=20

neighbouring town of H----. He gave an introduction to those gentlemen by a=
 letter, which=20

explained the matter as it had been explained to him; and this introduction=
, and his explanation,=20

saved all inquiries as to the source of the funds, which they profitably in=
vested for the childless=20

couple, who will never enjoy a penny of it.  The two miscarriages I have me=
ntioned were the only=20

failures of the plan of the gang to capture one whole week's wages througho=
ut the line of the=20

Great ---- Railway Company.  Next day (Friday) Mr. Wilson went on his holid=
ay trip to Paris. The=20

company's servants were expecting him, as usual--except at the one station =
to which a=20

misadventure had taken the money intended for its use. It is needless to sa=
y that no Mr. Wilson=20

and no money reached either of these places from London, as expected. Until=
 rather late in the=20

afternoon, when the chief cashier's office was closed, and that exalted fun=
ctionary and all his=20

clerks had gone home, nothing was said about the affair. It had not indeed =
until then become very=20

remarkable; but as soon as the fact became the subject of particular notice=
, it rose to the=20

magnitude of a grievance, and threatened to become a scandal.  "We've had n=
o money, and ain't=20

likely to get none till to-morrow," said a porter at one of the extremest s=
tations to the guard of an=20

up-train.  "Oh, cases, they are attended by a hissing, crackling noise: so =
the Siberians are wont to=20

say that =E2=80=9Cthe raging host is passing.=E2=80=9D  We find occasional =
references to the aurora among ancient=20

writers, but little attempt to explain it. So we have even few myths, it no=
t being common enough in=20

warmer climes to hold a place in popular tales. But in Iceland, and more no=
rthern regions, it is of=20

constant and brilliant occurrence, merely because it requires dry air, and =
the coldest air is the=20

driest. So among Scandinavian races appears the myth embodied by Longfellow=
 in the =E2=80=9CSaga of=20

King Olaf.=E2=80=9D The war god, Thor, speaks:      =E2=80=9CThe light thou=
 beholdest      Stream through the=20

heavens      In flashes of crimson,      Is but my red beard,      Blown by=
 the night wind,=20

Affrighting the nations.=E2=80=9D  And Scott has told us of the belief in S=
cotland and the northern isles, of=20

spirits abroad in the upper air:      =E2=80=9CThe monk gazed long on the l=
ovely moon,      Then into the=20

night he looked forth:      And red and bright, the streamers light,      W=
ere dancing in the glowing=20

north.      So had he seen, in fair Castile,      The youth in glittering s=
quadrons start,      Sudden the=20

flying jennet wheel,      And hurl the unexpected dart.      He knew by the=
 streams that shot so=20

bright,      That spirits were riding the Northern light.=E2=80=9D  The lig=
ht emitted by the aurora varies much=20

in intensity. Ordinarily it is not greater than that of the moon in her fir=
st quarter; but a few instances=20

are recorded where it was powerful enough to make itself=20

 small amount to the=20

friendly porter.  "'Pon my soul, we ain't," rejoined the porter; and he app=
ealed to his fellow-servants=20

for a corroboration, which they supplied.  "It will be all right to-morrow,=
" said the guard. "I suppose=20

n carefully studied=20

only within a century, it is not safe to affirm with certainty what records=
 of the past three hundred=20

years have induced many to believe; that it is of special frequency at peri=
ods of one hundred and=20
