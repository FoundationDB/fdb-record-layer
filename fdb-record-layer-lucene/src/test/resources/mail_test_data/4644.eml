 Then Halet moved smoothly into the act and held forth on Tick-Tock's appea=

had assumed that Halet was simply going out of her way at having made the a=
cquaintance at dinner of a Roman lady, who spoke English so perfectly; and =

Three minutes later, off to her right, where the ground was banked beneath =
a six-foot step in the=20

garden's terraces, Tick-Tock's outline suddenly caught her eye. Flat on her=
 belly, head lifted above=20

her paws, quite motionless, TT seemed like a transparent wraith stretched o=
ut along the terrace,=20

barely discernible even when stared at directly. It was a convincing illusi=
on; but what seemed to be=20

rocks, plant leaves, and sun-splotched earth seen through the wraith-outlin=
e was simply the=20

camouflage pattern TT had printed for the moment on her hide. She could hav=
e changed it=20

completely in an instant to conform to a different background.  Telzey poin=
ted an accusing finger.=20

"See you!" she announced, feeling a surge of relief which seemed as unaccou=
ntable as the rest of=20

it.  The wraith twitched one ear in acknowledgment, the head outlines shift=
ing as the camouflaged=20

face turned towards Telzey. Then the inwardly uncamouflaged, very substanti=
al looking mouth=20

opened slowly, showing Tick-Tock's red tongue and curved white tusks. The m=
outh stretched in a=20

wide yawn, snapped shut with a click of meshing teeth, became indistinguish=
able again. Next, a=20

pair of camouflaged lids drew back from TT's round, brilliant-green eyes. T=
he eyes stared across=20

the lawn at Telzey.  Telzey said irritably, "Quit clowning around, TT!"  Th=
e eyes blinked, and Tick-

Tock's natural bronze-brown color suddenly flowed over her head, down her n=
eck and across her=20

body into legs and tail. Against the side of the terrace, as if materializi=
ng into solidity at that=20

moment, appeared two hundred pounds of supple, rangy, long-tailed cat ... o=
r catlike creature.=20

TT's actual origin had never been established. The best guesses were that w=
hat Telzey had found=20

playing around in the woods five years ago was either a bio-structural expe=
riment which had got=20

away from a private laboratory on Orado, or some spaceman's lost pet, broug=
ht to the capital=20

planet from one of the remote colonies beyond the Hub. On top of TT's head =
was a large, fluffy=20

pompom of white fur, which might have looked ridiculous on another animal, =
but didn't on her.=20

Even as a fat kitten, hanging head down from the side of a wall by the  =E2=
=80=9CGranville, has come,=20

o afraid of being bored.=20

There is a large party by this train; the St. Jeromes, Bertram, Mr. Bohun, =
Lord Carisbrooke, and=20

some others we do not know.=E2=80=9D  The cardinal had been expected to-day=
, but he had telegraphed=20

that his arrival must be postponed in consequence: of business until the mo=
rrow, which day had=20

been previously fixed for the arrival of his fellow guardian and trustee, t=
he Earl of Culloden, and his=20

daughters, the Ladies Flora and Grizell Falkirk. Monsignore Catesby had, ho=
wever, arrived by this=20

train, and the persons =E2=80=9Cwhom they did not know,=E2=80=9D the Campia=
ns.  Lothair waited on Colonel=20

Campian immediately and welcomed him, but he did not see Theodora. Still he=
 had inquired after=20

her, and left her a message, and hoped that she would take some tea; and th=
us, as he flattered=20

himself, broken a little the strangeness of their meeting under his roof; b=
ut, notwithstanding all this,=20

when she really entered the drawing-room he was seized with such a palpitat=
ion of the heart that=20

for a moment he thought he should be unequal to the situation. But the sere=
nity of Theodora=20

reassured him. The Campians came in late, and all eyes were upon them. Loth=
air presented=20

Theodora to the duchess, who, being prepared for the occasion, said exactly=
 the right thing in the=20

best manner, and invited Mrs. Campian to sit by her, and then, Theodora bei=
ng launched, Lothair=20

whispered something to the duke, who nodded, and the colonel was introduced=
 to his grace. The=20

duke, always polite but generally cold, was more than courteous=E2=80=94he =
was cordial; he seemed to=20

enjoy the opportunity of expressing his high consideration for a gentleman =
of the Southern States.=20

So the first step was over; Lothair recovered himself; the palpitation subs=
ided; and the world still=20



went on. The Campians had made a good start, and the favorable impression h=
ourly increased. At=20

dinner Theodora sat between Lord St. Jerome and Bertram, and talked more to=
 the middle-aged=20

peer than to the distinguished youth, who would willingly have engrossed he=
r attention. All=20

mothers admire such discretion, especially in a young=20


_
had possessed enormous dignity.  Telzey studied her, the feeling of relief =
fading again. Tick-Tock,=20

ordinarily the most restful and composed of companions, definitely was stil=
l tensed up about=20

something. That big, lazy yawn a moment ago, the attitude of stretched-out =
relaxation ... all pure=20

sham!  "What _is_ eating you?" she asked in exasperation.  The green eyes s=
tared at her, solemn,=20

watchful, seeming for that fleeting instant quite alien. And why, Telzey th=
ought, should the old=20

question of what Tick-Tock really was pass through her mind just now? After=
 her rather alarming=20

rate of growth began to taper off last evening among the great ladies was, =
that Theodora was=20

distinguished, and that all she said or did was in good taste. On the plea =
of her being a foreigner,=20

she was at once admitted into a certain degree of social intimacy. Had she =
had the misfortune of=20

being native-born and had flirted with Bertram, she would probably, particu=
larly with so much=20

beauty, have been looked upon as =E2=80=9Ca horrid woman,=E2=80=9D and have=
 been relegated for amusement,=20

during her visit, to the attentions of the dark sex. But, strange to say, t=
he social success of Colonel=20

Campian was not less eminent than that of his distinguished wife. The chara=
cter=20


_
nobody had cared any more.  For a moment, Telzey had the uncanny certainty =
of having had the=20

answer to this situation almost in her grasp. An answer which appeared to i=
nvolve the world of=20

Jontarou, Tick-Tock, and of all unlikely factors--Aunt Halet.  She shook he=
r the duke gave of him=20

commanded universal sympathy. =E2=80=9CYou know he is a gentleman,=E2=80=9D=
 said the duke; =E2=80=9Che is not a=20

Yankee. People make the greatest mistakes about these things. He is a gentl=
eman of the South;=20

they have no property, but land; and I am told his territory was=20


_
*       *       *       *       *  Jontarou? The planet lay outside Telzey'=
s sphere of personal interests, but=20

she'd read up on it on the way here from Orado. Among all the worlds of the=
 Hub, Jontarou was=20

_the_ paradise for zoologists and sportsmen, a gigantic animal preserve, it=
s continents and seas=20

swarming with magnificent game. Under Federation law, it was being retained=
 deliberately in the=20

primitive state in which it had been discovered. Port Nichay, the only city=
, actually the only=20

inhabited point on Jontarou, was beautiful and quiet, a pattern of vast but=
 elegantly slender towers,=20

each separated from the others by always lived at Paris, and in the highest=
 style=E2=80=94disgusted, of=20

course, with his own country. It is not unlikely he may have lost his estat=
es now; but that makes no=20

difference to me. I shall treat him, and all Southern gentlemen, as our fat=
hers treated the emigrant=20

nobility of France.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHugo,=E2=80=9D said St. Aldegonde to=
 Mr. Bohun, =E2=80=9CI wish you would tell Bertha to=20

come to me. I want her. She is talking to a lot of women at the other end o=
f the room, and, if I go to=20

her, I am afraid they will get hold of me.=E2=80=9D  The future duchess, wh=
o lived only to humor her lord,=20

was at his side in an instant. =E2=80=9CYou wanted me, Granville?=E2=80=9D =

ansparent skyways. Near=20

the horizon, just visible from the garden, rose the tallest towers of all, =
the green and gold spires of=20

the Shikaris' Club, a center of Federation affairs and of social activity. =
From the aircar which=20

brought them across Port Nichay the evening before, Telzey had seen occasio=
nal strings of guest=20

houses, similar to the one Halet had rented, nestling along the park slopes=
.  [Illustration]  Nothing=20

very sinister about Port Nichay or green Jontarou, surely!  Halet? That blo=
nd, slinky, would-be=20

Machiavelli? What could--?  Telzey's eyes narrowed reflectively. There'd be=
en a bored. I like this=20

American fellow. He understands the only two subjects which interest me; ho=
rses and tobacco.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

am charmed, Granville, that you are not bored; I told mamma that you were v=
ery much afraid you=20

would be.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; but I tell you what, Bertha, I cannot sta=
nd any of the ceremonies. I shall go=20

before they begin. Why cannot Lothair be content with receiving his friends=
 in a quiet way? It is all=20

humbug about the county. If he wants to do something for the county, he can=
 build a wing to the=20

infirmary, or something of that sort, and not bore us with speeches and fir=
eworks. It is a sort of=20

thing I cannot stand.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you shall not, dear Granville.=
 The moment=20


_
occurrence--at least, it had seemed minor--just before the spaceliner docke=
d last night. A young=20

woman from one of the newscasting services had asked for an interview with =
the daughter of=20

Federation Councilwoman Jessamine Amberdon. This happened occasionally; and=
 Telzey had no=20

objections until the newshen's gossipy persistence in inquiring about the "=
unusual pet" she was=20

bringing to Port Nichay with her go. Only you are not bored at present.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot at present; but I=20

expected to be.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; so I told mamma; but that makes the=
 present more delightful.=E2=80=9D  The St.=20

Jeromes were going to Italy and immediately. Their departure had only been =
postponed in order=20

that they might be present at the majority of Lothair. Miss Arundel had at =
length succeeded in her=20
