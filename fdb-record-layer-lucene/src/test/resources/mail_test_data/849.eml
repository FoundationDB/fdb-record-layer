                -------------------------------------  It is a howling nigh=
t, wind and rain galore. I'm wondering how long the tent will last. I have =
been out  It may not be amiss to mention, that Mount Holyoke, so much celeb=
rated for the delightful view from its top, has been found, with a sextant,=
 to be 830 feet above Connecticut river. Its height has been frequently ove=

 specimens, and whose localities have not been noticed by mineralogists.  _=
Quartz_--several varieties.    1. _Rock _
sentry. We keep all our equipment on, as we are liable to be called out at =
any minute. We sleep=20

with our belts and revolvers in place.  A quarter guard is three men and a =
noncom. The men do=20

two hours on and four off. When it comes to a man's turn he has to be on hi=
s beat no matter what=20

the weather is like during the day or night. The cold is pretty bad and occ=
asionally it snows. Some=20

units have sentry boxes, but we haven't. We use a bell tent. I was called t=
his morning at five=20

o'clock to do my sentry from five to seven. The small oil stove which serve=
s to heat the guard tents=20

had evidently been smoking for an hour, and over everything was a thick fil=
m of lamp-black.=20

Everybody thought it a great joke until they looked at themselves in the mi=
rror and caught sight of=20

their own equipment. We must come off guard as clean as we go on. I got out=
 quickly and left=20

them swearing and cleaning up.  From five to seven is the most interesting =
relief. I had first to=20

wake the cooks at five o'clock and then I watched the gradual quarter of a =
circle, and tumbling=20

among the broken rocks. On the opposite side of the river are a few buildin=
gs, the commencement=20

of a canal, and, behind these, moderately elevated hills, covered with wood=
s. Two rocky islands=20

near the middle of the descending sheet, and another thirty rods below, add=
 much to the beauty of=20

the view. Looking from the southeast shore, you have a partial prospect of =
the falls, and a view of=20

an amphitheatre of greenstone hills, through which a small river empties. T=
he pleasure derived=20

from the view proceeds more from its wildness than its sublimity.  The posi=
tion of the hills,=20

boundaries, and rivers, on the accompanying map, may not, in all cases, be =
precisely correct. The=20

general outlines were enlarged by a pentegraph from Carleton's map of Massa=
chusetts, and the=20

intermediate objects were placed chiefly by the eye; their relative situati=
ons being determined by=20

travelling over the ground, and viewing them from different elevations. The=
 boundaries of the=20

several formations have not been so=20

camp. At six o'clock I had to wake the orderly sergeants and then far away =
in the distance the first=20

bugle sounded reveille, then it was taken up all around and gradually the c=
amps all over the Plains=20

woke up. Men came out of the tents, the calls for the "fall in" sounded, an=
d the rolls were called=20

and the usual business of the day commenced. The change from the deadness o=
f the night with its=20

absolute stillness all takes place in a very short time. To a person with a=
ny imagination it seems=20

rather wonderful. You must remember that we can see for miles, and in every=
 direction there are=20

hundreds of tents. Each battalion is separate, and they have parts. Of thei=
r correctness generally,=20

however, I am confident. The latitude and longitude of Deerfield, from whic=
h those on the map=20

were marked, were obtained by taking a mean of the observations given by Ge=
n. E. Hoyt, in the=20

Transactions of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of twelve lu=
nar observations=20

since made. The result is, Lat. 42=C2=B0 32' 32". Long. 72=C2=B0 39' from G=
reenwich.  With the map is given a=20

view of the strata of rocks from Hoosack mountain to eleven miles east of C=
onnecticut river, on a=20

line nearly east and west, passing through Deerfield. The horizontal distan=
ces are laid down from=20

tents.  I wonder if I told you that aeroplanes are all the time flying over=
 our camp. With=20

characteristic British frankness they always have two huge Union Jacks pain=
ted on the undersides=20

of the wings. We have become so used to them that we scarcely trouble to lo=
ok up unless they=20

The principal rocks only are coloured; for it is very difficult to determin=
e the breadth of many, since=20

they frequently alternate with one another. I have not examined the country=
 on the east side of=20

Connecticut river with sufficient care to be able to extend the section on =
that=20
