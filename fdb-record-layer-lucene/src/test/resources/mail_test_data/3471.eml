who lived in Kentucky, but Lord! how that man hated slavery! He used to always tell us (we never 

let our owners see us listenin' to him, though) that God didn't intend for some men to be free and 

some men be in slavery. He used to talk to the owners, too, when they would listen to him, but 

mostly they hated the sight of John Fee.  "In the night, though, he was a different man, for every 

slave who came through his place going across the river he had a good word, something to eat 

and some kind of rags, too, if it was cold. He always knew just what to tell you to do if anything 

went wrong, and sometimes I think he kept slaves there on his place 'till they saved from 

temptation. A deeper morality replies that what was bad for Gustavus' cause and for his kind, 

could not be good for Gustavus; and that whether he were to stand or fall in the hour of 

temptation, he had better have lived his time and done his work. We, with our small philosophy, 

can make allowance for the greater dangers of the higher sphere; and shall we arrogate to 

ourselves a larger judgment and ampler sympathies than we allow to God? Yet Gustavus was 

happy. Among soldiers and statesmen, if there is a greater, there is hardly a purer name. He had 

won not only honour but love, and the friend and comrade was as much bewailed as the deliverer

river. Helped us a lot.  "I almost ran the business in the ground after I had been carrying the slaves 

across for nearly four years. It was in 1863, and one night I carried across about twelve on the 

same night. Somebody must have seen us, because they set out after me as soon as I stepped 

out of the boat back on the Kentucky side; from that time on they were after me. Sometimes they 

would almost catch me; I had to run away from Mr. Tabb's the first and last time with true glory on 

the scene of universal history. In him the spirit of the famous house of Vasa rose to the first heroic 

height. It was soon to mount to madness in Christina and Charles XII.  Not till a year had passed 

could Sweden bring herself to consign the remains of her Gustavus to the dust. Then came a 

hero's funeral, with pomp not unmeaning, with trophies not unbecoming the obsequies of a 

Christian warrior,

bed was from one week to another. I would sleep in a cornfield tonight, up in the branches of a 

tree tomorrow night, and buried in a haypile the next night; the River, where I had carried so many 

across myself, was no good to me; it was watched too close.  "Finally, I saw that I could never do 

any more good in Mason County, so I decided to take my freedom, too. I had a wife by this time, 

and one night we quietly slipped across and headed for Mr. Rankin's bell and light. It looked like 

we had to go almost to China to youth Gustavus had loved the beautiful Ebba Brahe, daughter of 

a Swedish nobleman, and she had returned his love. But etiquette and policy interposed, and 

Gustavus married Eleanor, a princess of Brandenburg, also renowned for beauty. The widowed 

Queen of Gustavus, though she had loved him with a fondness too great for their perfect 

happiness, admitted his first love to a partnership in her grief, and sent Ebba with her own portrait
