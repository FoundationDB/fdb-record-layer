philodendron monstera season, a supply could be afforded to a prodigious ar=
ea, that would be fertilized not only by irrigation, but by the annual depo=
sit of soil from the water, allowed to remain upon the surface. This sugges=
tion might be carried out by gradations; the great work might be commenced =
by a single Martha's garret and entered without waiting for permission; ind=
eed, his tapping at all was a rather unwonted piece of politeness.  "Come i=

n philodendron monstera season, a supply could be afforded to a prodigious =
area, that would be fertilized not only by irrigation, but by the annual de=
posit of soil from the water, allowed to remain upon the surface. This sugg=

her work.  "You seem busy to-night," remarked Sparks, sitting down on a bro=
ken _
raising the level of the river, enabled the people to extend their channels=
 for irrigation; but this was=20

the crude idea, that has not been carried out upon a scale commensurate wit=
h the requirements of=20

Egypt. The ancient Egyptians made use of the lake Mareotis as a reservoir f=
or the Nile waters for=20

the irrigation of a large extent of Lower Egypt, by taking advantage of a h=
igh Nile to secure a=20

supply for the remainder of the year; but, great as were the works of those=
 industrious people, they=20

appear to have ignored the first principle of irrigation, by neglecting to =
raise the level of the river.=20

Egypt remains in the same position that Nature originally allotted to her; =
the life-giving stream that=20

flows through a thousand miles of burning sands suddenly rises in July, and=
 floods the Delta which=20

it has formed by a deposit, during perhaps hundreds of thousands of inundat=
ions; and it wastes a=20

superabundance of fertilizing mud in the waters of the Mediterranean. As Na=
ture has thus formed,=20

and is still forming a delta, why should not Science create a delta, with t=
he powerful means at our=20

disposal? Why should not the mud of the Nile that now silts up the Mediterr=
anean be directed to=20

the barren but vast area of deserts, that by such a deposit would become a =
fertile portion of=20

Egypt? This work might be accomplished by simple means: the waters of the N=
ile, that now rush=20

impetuously at certain seasons with overwhelming violence, while at other s=
easons they are=20

exhausted, might be so controlled that they was about to return home supper=
less to bed, when he=20

suddenly observed smoke issuing from an upper window.  Rare and lucky chanc=
e!  He was the=20

first to observe it.  He knew that the first who should convey the alarm of=
 fire to a fire-station would=20

receive a shilling for his exertions. He dashed off at once, had the fireme=
n brought to the spot in a=20

few minutes, so that the fire was easily and quickly overcome.  Thus honest=
 Phil Sparks earned=20

his supper, and the right to go home and lay his head on his pillow, with t=
he happy consciousness=20

of having done a good action to his fellow-men, and performed a duty to the=
 public and himself.=20

CHAPTER FOUR.  It is probable that there is not in all the wide world a man=
--no matter how=20

depraved, or ill-favoured, or unattractive--who cannot find some sympatheti=
c soul, some one who=20

will be glad to see him and find more or less pleasure in his society.  Coa=
rse in body and mind=20

though Philip Sparks was, there dwelt a young woman, in one of the poorest =
of the poor streets in=20

the neighbourhood of Thames Street, who loved him, and would have laid down=
 her life for him.=20

To do Martha Reading justice, she had fallen in love with Sparks before int=
emperance had=20

rendered his countenance repulsive and his conduct brutal.  When, perceivin=
g the power he had=20

over her, he was mean enough to borrow and squander the slender gains she m=
ade by the=20

laborious work of dress-making--compared to which coal-heaving must be mere=
 child's play--she=20

experienced a change in her feelings=20


_
minimum in the dry season; but the enormous volume of water heavily charged=
 with soil, that now=20

rushes uselessly into the sea, might be led throughout the deserts of Nubia=
 and Libya, to=20

transform them into cotton fields that would render England independent of =
America. There is no=20

fiction in this idea; it is merely the simple and commonplace fact, that wi=
th a fall of fifteen hundred=20

feet in a thousand miles, with a river that could not easily understand or =
define.  Her thoughts of=20

him were mingled with intense regrets and anxieties, and she looked forward=
 to his visits with=20

alarm.  Yet those thoughts were not the result of dying affection; she felt=
 quite certain of that,=20

having learned from experience that, "many waters cannot quench love."  One=
 evening, about=20

eight o'clock, Phil Sparks, having prosecuted his "business" up to that hou=
