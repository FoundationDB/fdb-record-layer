 [Stamps.] Stop your swearing!  ENGSTRAND. Hush, hush; you're right enough =
there, my girl. What I wanted to say was just this--I've laid by a very tid=
y pile from this Orphanage job.  REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for =
you.  ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country =
hole?  REGINA. Well, what then?  ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putt=
ing Confederacy. How long could these maintain themselves?  This swift and =
easy repossession of the southern coastline by the Union, however important=
, lacked the wholesale excitement of great and bloody battles, and was a ga=
me little appreciated. But in the midst of it came an incident dramatic and=
 startling in the highest degree, its hero being a naval officer, David Gla=
sgow Farragut, _
donc_!  ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word.  REGINA=
. Oh, I=20

remember very well what word you used.  ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only =
when I was a bit=20

on, don't you know? Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina.  REGINA=
. Ugh!=20

ENGSTRAND. And besides, it was when your mother was that aggravating--I had=
 to find=20

something to twit her with, my child. She was always setting up for a fine =
lady. [Mimics.] "Let me=20

go, Engstrand; let me be. Remember I was three years in Chamberlain Alving'=
s family at=20

Rosenvold." [Laughs.] Mercy on us! She could never forget that the Captain =
was made a=20

Chamberlain while she was in service here.  REGINA. Poor mother! you very s=
oon tormented her=20

into her grave.  ENGSTRAND. [With a twist of his shoulders.] Oh, of course!=
 I'm to have and river-

mouths so occupied and threatened that the outlets to the sea became for th=
e Confederates few=20

and perilous. This successful course was interrupted during the Virginia ca=
mpaign of the summer;=20

the troops were to a large extent withdrawn to places where reinforcements =
were demanded. The=20

Roanoke Island expedition is noteworthy, among other reasons, for bringing =
to the front Ambrose=20

E. Burnside, its commander,[217] a brave and well-intentioned patriot, quit=
e inadequate, however,=20

for large responsibilities, which later came upon him.  During these same w=
eeks forces farther=20

south were equally busy in expeditions from Port Royal. Fort Pulaski, the s=
trong work which=20

commanded the approaches to Savannah, a post environed by swamps and waterc=
ourses, and=20

therefore difficult of access,=20


_
the blame for everything.  REGINA. [Turns away; half aloud.] Ugh--! And tha=
t leg too!=20

ENGSTRAND. What do you say, my child?  REGINA. _Pied de mouton_.  ENGSTRAND=
. Is that=20

English, eh?  REGINA. Yes.  ENGSTRAND. Ay, ay; you've picked up some learni=
ng out here; and=20

that may come in useful now, Regina.  REGINA. [After a short silence.] What=
 do you want with me=20

in town?  ENGSTRAND. Can you ask what a father wants with his only the engi=
neering skill than=20

to the bravery of its assailants, April 11, 1862; therefore, most of the li=
ttoral of Georgia, in addition=20

to that of North and South Carolina, was in Federal hands.[218] These conqu=
ests were presently=20

supplemented by the occupation of the Atlantic ports of Florida. On the Gul=
f side, the retention of=20

Fort Pickens by Union forces from the beginning had put Pensacola Harbor un=
der Federal control.=20

The=20


_
a lonely, forlorn widower?  REGINA. Oh, don't try on any nonsense like that=
 with me! Why do you=20

want me?  ENGSTRAND. Well, let me tell you, I've been thinking of setting u=
p in a new line of=20

business.  REGINA. [Contemptuously.] You've tried that often enough, and mu=
ch good you've=20

done with it.  ENGSTRAND. Yes, but this time you shall see, Regina! Devil t=
ake its establishment=20

was throttling the foreign commerce which was vital to the Confederacy. On =
the Atlantic scarcely=20

any important ports were left except Charleston and Wilmington; and before =
the thresholds of=20

these places lay, night and day, the fierce and watchful war-dogs of the Un=
ion.[219] Nevertheless,=20
