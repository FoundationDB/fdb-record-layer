 The night was not a good one for definition, but I was very much pleased i=

Like vagrant tendrils, tossed     Dark hair about her brows. And quaintly c=

  DEAR SIR,=E2=80=94I like the 18-inch=20

speculum, and I think it as good as it can be, and if the larger one is as =
good I shall be delighted=20

with it. It gives beautiful star images: I see Sirius as a brilliant dot, a=

"Yet soft, as through     Some pleasant dream, the summer's spicy air     S=

seaward gardens fair,     In southland hid; so, gently, Eve straightway    =
 To Adam's life unbidden=20

came, to stay     Forever there. Sure entrance then made she     Into that =
heart untenanted by=20

thee.       "So, to some olden house, from whose shut doors     One went er=
ewhile, another comes.=20

 roof, the casements left=20
