Clan   Lorna had never realized before how much of life can be compressed i=
nto a few days. The interval between her father's departure for Naples and =
his return for the week-end was spent almost entirely with her friends. It =
marked for her an altogether new phase of existence. She had read in books =
about jolly families of brothers muscle; and that the mere simple contact o=

 is said, that the electric _
it up and dropped it again, all were turned to sapphire, while articles und=
er the sea gleamed with a=20

beautiful silver shade. The girls bared their arms and enjoyed dipping them=
 to obtain this effect.=20

The glorious blue of the cave was indescribable.  "I feel like a mermaid at=
 the bottom of the=20

ocean," exulted Peachy.  "Or a cherub in the sky!" said Jess.  "Why is it b=
lue though?" asked=20

Lorna.  "Because of the refraction of light," explained Mrs. Beverley The p=
resence of gymnoti is=20

also considered as the principal cause of the want of fish in the ponds and=
 pools of the Llanos.=20

They, however, kill many more than they devour: and the Indians told us, th=
at when young=20

alligators and gymnoti are caught at the same time in very strong nets, the=
 latter never show the=20

slightest trace of a wound, because they disable the young alligators befor=
e they are attacked by=20

them. All the inhabitants of the waters dread the=20


_
next boat. "We see a kind of concentrated reflection of the sky sent to us =
under the sea. If it were=20

a gray day outside it would be gray in here too. Some people think that the=
 Mediterranean has=20

risen, and that once the water in this grotto was much lower, so that boats=
 could sail in and out of=20

it quite easily. Do you see that landing-place over there? It leads to some=
 broken steps and a=20

blocked-up passage that tradition says wound up through the cliff right to =
the villa of Tiberius.=20

Perhaps it was a secret way by which he thought he might escape if danger t=
hreatened him."=20

"How I'd love to explore it," sighed Irene.  "It only goes a little way bef=
ore it is blocked. It's hardly=20

worth landing to look at it. Be careful, Renie! If you lean over the edge o=
f the boat so far you'll be=20

upsetting us, and, although we might look very delightful and silvery objec=
ts under the water, I'm=20

not at all anxious to offer myself for the experiment."  "Why don't they en=
large the entrance?"=20

asked Vincent.  "Because nobody is sure whether by doing so they might or m=
ight not spoil the=20

beautiful effect of blue light in the grotto. It's too risky a venture to t=
ry. Besides in present=20

conditions the boatmen make a great deal of money by taking tourists into t=
he grotto. If it were=20

very easy to get in they could not charge so much. It's a little mine of we=
alth to the Capri fisherfolk=20

now, though years ago they used to say the place was haunted, and tell terr=
ible tales about it.=20

They said fire and smoke had been seen issuing from the gymnoti. Lizards, t=
ortoises, and frogs,=20

seek pools where they are secure from the electric action. It became necess=
ary to change the=20

direction of a road near Uritucu, because the electric eels were so numerou=
s in one river, that they=20

every year killed a great number of mules, as they forded the water with th=
eir burdens.  Though in=20

the present state of our knowledge we may flatter ourselves with having thr=
own some light on the=20

extraordinary effects of electric fishes, yet a vast number of physical and=
 physiological researches=20

still remain to be made. The brilliant results which chemistry has obtained=
 by means of the Voltaic=20

battery, have occupied all observers, and turned attention for some time fr=
om the examinations of=20

the phenomena of vitality. Let us hope that these phenomena, the most awful=
 and the most=20

mysterious of all, will in their turn occupy the earnest attention of natur=
al philosophers. This hope=20

will be easily realized if they succeed in procuring anew living gymnoti in=
 some one of the great=20

capitals of Europe. The discoveries that will be made on the electromotive =
apparatus of these fish,=20

much more energetic, and more easy of preservation, than the torpedos,* wil=
l extend to all the=20

phenomena of muscular motion subject to volition. (* In order to investigat=
e the phenomena of the=20

living electromotive apparatus in its greatest simplicity, and not to mista=
ke for general conditions=20

circumstances which depend on the degree of energy of the electric organs, =

times, that at night=20

the Sirens sang sweetly there, that any young fishermen who ventured to sai=
l near disappeared=20

and were never seen again, and that the place was full of human bones."  "W=
hat a gruesome=20

record," declared Vincent. "I agree with Renie though, I'd like to explore =
that passage with a strong=20

bicycle lamp, or an electric torch. Who knows what we might find if we look=
ed about--a coin that=20

Tiberius had dropped out of his pocket, or one of the Sirens' hairpins, or =
a crocodile's tooth at=20

least. Yes, I must positively come again, Mater. Just to prove the truth of=
 your stories."  "Silly boy,"=20

laughed his mother. "I fishes most easily tamed. If the gymnoti were not kn=
own, we might=20

suppose, from the observations made on torpedos, that fishes cannot give th=
eir shocks from a=20

distance through very thick strata of water, or through a bar of iron, with=
out forming a circuit. Mr.=20

Williamson has felt strong shocks when he held only one hand in the water, =
and this hand, without=20

touching the gymnotus, was placed between it and the small fish towards whi=
ch the stroke was=20

directed from ten or fifteen inches distance. Philosophical Transactions vo=
lume 65 pages 99 and=20

108. When the gymnotus was enfeebled by bad health, the lateral shock was i=
mperceptible; and in=20

 lose a chance. Now our=20

stay here's limited by the official tariff to a quarter of an hour, and if =
we stop any longer we shall=20

have to pay our dues a second time. If you're ready so am I. Tell the first=
 boat to go on. Don't=20

forget Cavendish, in his ingenious experiments on an artificial torpedo, ha=
d well remarked these=20

differences, depending on the greater or less energy of the charge. Philoso=
phical Transactions=20

1776 page 212.) It will perhaps be found that, in most animals, every contr=
action of the muscular=20

fibre is preceded by a=20
