which not only made him rich for the moment but opened the way to wealth ah=

speaking of what this would mean to them here. He knew how hard it had been=
 for her and how=20

pluckily she had come through without ever asking for anything. But all tha=
t was over now. He had=20

made money! What was the matter? She heard it all in fragments, topsy turvy=
. What was wrong?=20

"Here is a Joe I've never known!" Still staring up into his eyes, she saw t=

the excitement in his husky voice struck into her sensitive departments, ex=

clutch of his hand. She lay wondering why she was not glad, till suddenly s=
he saw in his face his=20

sharp disappointment at the way she was taking his news. With a pang of ala=
rm she roused=20

herself and said:  "Oh, Joe, it's too wonderful! It's so sudden it strikes =
me all of a heap!" And she=20

laughed unsteadily, seized his hand and kissed it, talking rapidly, her eye=
s glistening all the while=20

with foolish tears. Fiercely then she asked herself, "Why can't you enter i=
n and be gay?" But=20

though she was doing better now and had him talking as before, again and ag=
ain she felt he was=20

thinking how different Amy would have been--how in an instant, laughing and=
 crying, she would=20

have thrown herself into his arms!  Yes, indeed, a Joe she had never known,=
 shaped and moulded=20

by the wife who had had him in those early years when a woman can do so muc=
h with a man, can=20

do what sets him in a groove in work and living, tastes, ideals. "And I tho=
ught I had done so=20

much!" But Amy's hand had still been there; he had been her husband, all th=
e time!  It was a relief=20

to have him gone. Alone she could think more clearly. "What are you so frig=
htened about? Of=20

being rich, you little fool?" No, she had always wanted that, money enough =
to forget it existed,=20

money allowed till July 1st, 1891, to comply with the provisions of the act=
 respecting them (_ib._, s.=20

2, as amended Act 1891, c. 109, s. 1).  A person wishing to enter upon the =
practice of medicine=20

must present to the board of medical examiners a diploma from some medical =
college in good=20

standing as provided by sec. 1, or shall present himself to the said board =
for examination upon=20

anatomy, physiology, chemistry, pathology, surgery, obstetrics, and therape=
utics. If the diploma be=20

found genuine, or if the applicant for examination be found worthy and comp=
etent, the board shall=20

issue a certificate which shall entitle the lawful holder to all the privil=
eges of this act (_ib._, s. 3, as=20

amended Act 1891, c. 109, s. 2).  The governor appoints six graduate physic=
ians as a State board=20

of medical examiners; the three schools allopathic, hom=C5=93opathic, and e=
clectic must be=20

represented on the board; five constitute a quorum and a majority of those =
present are necessary=20

to reject an applicant, but such rejection shall not bar a re-examination a=
fter the lapse of three=20

months; provided the members representing each school shall have the right =
to examine all=20

applicants of that school, and the board shall issue the certificate to app=
licants who are=20

too young! And he'll=20

expect so much of me now. There'll be no excuse for holding back, for going=
 slow till I find what I=20

want. He'll expect me to find friends at once! But where shall I find them =
all of a sudden? It isn't as=20

though we were millionaires, really big ones, all in a minute. The newspape=
rs won't be very=20

excited; the town will take it quite calmly, quite! And for the life of me =
I don't see any friends=20

rushing at us! And yet he'll expect it! So much he'll expect! He'll give an=
d give and give me things=20

and then wonder why I don't get anywhere!" The angry tears leaped in her ey=
es. "Because he's=20

different now, he's changed! All bursting with his big success, his 'strike=
,' his business--money=20

mad! Oh, how I hate his business--and that detestable partner, too!"  A wav=
e of rebellion swept=20

over her at the way she had been caught, tangled member or members of the b=
oard who belong=20

inconvenience two=20

members of the board may grant a temporary license to any applicant if the =
applicant has not been=20

refused a license by the board within six months, which shall be in force t=
ill the next regular=20

meeting of the board (_ib._, s. 5).  The members of the board shall not be =
members of the State=20

board of health, nor any medical faculty (_ib._, s. 6).  The regular meetin=
g of the board shall be=20

once in each year at such time and place as the board may decide, but the p=
resident of the board=20

may call a special meeting when demanded by public necessity (_ib._, s. 7).=
  Every person holding=20

a certificate must have it recorded in the office of the county court clerk=
 where he resides, and the=20

date of record must be indorsed thereon. Until such record is made the hold=

se and tears, from=20

which she fell into a deep sleep. And when she awoke she found the nurse wa=
s waiting with the=20

baby.  And the days which followed with their peace, their slow return of h=
ealth and strength,=20

brought assurance, too, and she laughed at herself for having been such a f=
oolish child. She=20

could feel how=20

changed he was, it no longer frightened her. She had her wee boy; and Emily=
 Giles and Susette=20

and her nurse kept coming in; and the room grew very gay, as they had littl=
e parties there.  "Who=20

needs friends so all of a sudden!"  But one day Emily came in kind intended=
