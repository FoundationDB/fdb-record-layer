The chief opponents of the levee system advocate the increase of dracaena m=
arginata prisoner, and that the lady must also share that inconvenience, th=
ey again put forth every form of remonstrance. All were useless. The office=
r was inexorable and unbelieving. He rudely expressed his disbelief of must=
 remain a constant expense. More than $90,000,000 have already been spent u=
pon them, and the question is an even more vital one than ever.  The chief =
opponents of the levee system advocate the increase of _
them, which were entered by the rear.  All this looked to me very suspiciou=
s. I determined,=20

however, to pursue my inquiries. There was not yet enough evidence, in my o=
wn opinion, to justify=20

an application for a search-warrant, and less justification for any one's a=
rrest on a criminal charge.=20

Inquiries in the village and neighbourhood elicited not much; but the few s=
craps of fact that we did=20

get tended to fortify a suspicion that here was a depot of the plunder.  Th=
e tradespeople were=20

pumped, but those wells of gossip or scandal were nearly dry. The truth was=
, this cottage neither=20

excited remark by ostentation, nor the reverse. What it required, it ordere=
d and paid for. The trade=20

done with its inmates by the shopkeepers who were honoured with their patro=
nage was not large=20

enough to arouse the envy of their rivals. It may astonish some people, who=
 are tormented by=20

scandal, to know that rumour may be either avoided or "manipulated," if you=
 know how to go about=20

the task.  While I was engaged in these inquiries, with two of my assistant=
s, the man who had the=20

words with the policeman, as described, had another, and what he called "a =
jolly row," with that=20

officer. The matter was, I believe, through this, mentioned at the headquar=
ters of the metropolitan=20

police, and the authorities took it Pointe Coupee, thus much increasing the=
 submerged area. From=20

the items given, and the fact of breaks in east Baton Rouge, and the Nita c=
revasse, and twenty or=20

more below New Orleans, the reader may see that a large portion of eastern =
Louisiana lay more or=20

less under water. By the end of April there was no fear of further danger, =
simply because there=20

was little harm left to do. The continual east wind added to the distress o=
n the lower river by=20

sweeping Lake Pontchartrain and the gulf water across the land, up to the l=
evees on the river.=20

The one peculiar feature of the recent flood is that but few lives were los=
t--perhaps not a dozen, all=20

told. The warning of the Signal Service put people on their guard, and ther=
e was no occasion for=20

surprise.  The damage to property can not be estimated. Three thousand squa=
re miles of land=20

were more or less flooded in Louisiana alone; and while much of this was us=
eless swamp land, the=20

larger part comprised some of the most valuable sugar plantations in the St=
ate. Fifty thousand=20

people were directly affected by the flood in this region. All the railroad=
s in this district suffered=20

severely from wash outs and loss of time and custom. Any estimate of the da=
mage done to=20

planters should include not only real estate and personal property, but als=
o the amount=20


_
An active sergeant of the detective police called upon me, and asked for in=
formation, which I=20

thought myself scarcely at liberty to refuse to give, so gave it. He forthw=
ith set to work, and got=20

warrants to search the premises and arrest the inmates.  The time he select=
ed for pouncing on the=20

suspects was twelve at night.  That evening the shabby brougham turned out =
of the livery-stables,=20

wended its way through slush and traffic along Piccadilly, and at about the=
 usual spot the driver=20

was changed. Away the brougham went again, at a slightly accelerated pace, =
as though the=20

horse's head was lightened. The party alighted at the cottage, and the stab=
le was occupied as=20

before.  About half-past twelve o'clock a body of police effected an entran=
ce into the cottage by=20

the rear. The whole of the small household was aroused. Great was the const=
ernation of Miss=20

Goodwin, and her brother was nearly killed by alarm. Of the rest not much d=
ifferent can be said.=20

Groom and coachman (one person), housekeeper and general servant (also one =
person), who=20

completed the human establishment, were awfully frightened.  The highly int=
elligent sergeant=20

insisted upon ransacking the house, searching the stables, and exploring th=
e garden. In the mean=20

time the lady, gentleman, and servants were told to consider themselves in =
custody.  In vain the=20

gentleman protested against this outrage, and sometimes gently threatened t=
o bring down all the=20

vengeance of the law upon his sister's tormentors. The sergeant treated the=
 threat with disdain,=20

and ridiculed the claim of his prisoner to kinship with Miss Goodwin. All e=
ntreaties, menaces,=20

expostulations, and threats were answered by references to his duty, or int=
imations that he knew=20

what he was about.  The search and exploration revealed to raise the custom=
ary crops. This single=20

item would be very large. But when we consider the terrible havoc committed=
 in other lands and=20

attended by fearful loss of life, we may be devoutly thankful that things w=
ere no worse with us.=20

The levee system is attended by peculiar perils. There must be constant wat=
ching and repairing.=20

At seasons of danger, patrols are needed, even when the levees are  [Illust=
ration: DESERTED=20

FARMHOUSE.]  sound; for human nature is full of rank selfishness, and peopl=
e who find their=20

property endangered are apt to cut the levee upon the opposite side above t=
hem, to relieve=20

themselves by flooding others. Hungry wolves will eat a wounded companion; =
but man is almost=20

the only animal that seeks an opportunity for wounding his fellow that he m=
ay have a pretext for=20

devouring him.  The craw-fish is another persistent enemy of the planter, u=
ndermining levees with=20

his numerous tunnels, and even penetrating the low lying fields at a distan=
ce from the river, not=20

infrequently damaging the roots of growing crops. The ground becomes like a=
 sponge, and water=20

oozes from the levees in countless places.  There are other objections to t=
he levee system; and=20

while the Mississippi River Commission, and a majority of engineers endorse=
 it, there are not a=20

few equally capable men who denounce it as false in theory, and mischievous=
 in practice. The=20

problem remains a puzzling one. If the floods are unrestrained, a large por=
tion of the river bottom=20

becomes uninhabitable a considerable portion of each year. As to controllin=
g them, a man of much=20

experience said at the time of the flood in 1882, =E2=80=9CI have lived on =
the river for thirty years, and I=20

have studied it, for it was my business to do so. I have been steam-boating=
 all that time. I am now=20

certain=20


_
disappointed, but not yet discomfited. He saw that, at all events, he was s=
afe if he went on, and=20

that if he turned back he might expose himself to the charge of negligence.=
 There was enough that=20

was wrong, more than sufficient that was mysterious, to cover any excess of=
 vigilance, or any=20

stretch of duty. So on he resolved to go.  When Mr. Goodwin was told that h=
e must accompany the=20

what ought to be done to it.=E2=80=9D  Another said, =E2=80=9CWhen God put =
the river into this valley, He told it to go=20

wherever it pleased, and it always has done so, and always will.=E2=80=9D  =
Yet, the problem can not be=20

considered hopeless, though mere experiments are dangerous. There is little=
 doubt that the levees=20

would have withstood the unprecedented high water of the present year, had =
it not been=20
