 added doubtfully.  "How=20

much did you hear of what she said? Did you understand?"  "I came back dire=

thought she _sounded_ cross. Mummy was afraid when people were cross; she l=

the boy--not Peter's boy, our boy--he was rude to Mummy. He did not dare to=
 touch me because I=20

, very earnest, with an=20

exceedingly pink nose, for the wind was keen. He had never before said so m=
uch at one time.=20

"Shall I go back and beat her?" he asked again.  "Certainly not," Jan cried=
, clutching Tony lest he=20

should fly off there and then. "We don't _do_ such things here at home. Nob=
ody is beaten, ever.=20

I'm sure Peter never beats his servants."  "No," Tony allowed. "A big sahib=
 must not strike a=20

servant, but I can, and I do if they are rude. She was rude about Meg."  "S=
he didn't mean to be=20

rude."  "She found fault with her clothes and her hair. She is a very proud=
 and impudent cook."=20

"Tony dear, you really don't understand. She wasn't a bit rude. She was afr=

obstinately.  "Not really, Tony; she didn't mean to scold."  Tony looked ve=
ry hard at Jan.  In silence=20

they stared at one another for quite a minute. Jan got up off the seat.  "L=

 up. His cot was placed so=20

that he could see into Jan's room, and the door between was always left ope=
n. She was standing=20

before the dressing-table, taking down her hair.  Unlike the bedrooms at th=
e flat, the room was not=20

cold though both the windows were open. Wren's End was never cold, though a=
lways fresh, for=20

one of Anthony's earliest improvements had been a boiler-house and central =
heating, with=20

radiators set under the windows, so that they could always stand open.  Jan=
 had not put on her=20

dressing-gown, and her night-dress had rather short, loose sleeves that fel=
l back from her arms as=20

she raised them.  He watched the white arm wielding the brush with great pl=
easure; he decided he=20

liked to look at it.  "Auntie Jan!"  She turned and flung her hair back fro=
m her face in a great silver=20

cloud.  "You awake, sonny! Did I make a noise?"  "No, I just woke. Auntie J=
an, will Daddie ever=20

come here?"  "I expect so."  "Well, listen. If he does, he shan't take your=
 things, your pretty twinkly=20

things. I won't let him."  Jan stood as if turned to stone.  "He took Mummy=
's. I saw him; I couldn't=20

stop him, I was so little. But she _said_--she said it twice before she wen=
t away from that last=20

bungalow--she said: 'Take care of Auntie Jan, Tony; don't let Daddie take h=
er things.' So I won't."=20

Tony was sitting up. His room was all in darkness; two candles were lit on =
Jan's dressing-table. He=20

could see her, but she couldn't see him.  She came to him, stooped over him=
, and laid her cheek=20

against his so that they were both veiled with her hair. "Darling, I don't =
think poor Daddie would=20

want to take my things. You must try not to think hardly of Daddie."  Tony =
parted the veil of hair=20



with a gentle hand so that they could both see the candles.  "You don't kno=
w my Daddie ... much,"=20

he said, "do you?"  Jan shuddered.  "I saw him," he went on in his queer li=
ttle unemotional voice. "I=20

saw him take all her pretty twinkly things; and her silver boxes. I'm glad =
I sleep here."  "Did she=20

mind much?" Jan whispered.  "I don't know. She didn't see him take them, on=
ly me. She hadn't=20

come to bed. She never said nothing to me--only about you."  "I don't expec=
t," Jan made a great=20

effort to speak naturally, "that Daddie would care about my things ... It's=
 different, you see."  "I'm=20

.  Tony was changing=20

this view.  He was not yet at all talkative, but every now and then when he=
 was alone with her he=20

became frank and communicative, as reserved people often will when suddenly=
 they let=20

themselves go. And his very simplicity gave force to his revelations.  Duri=
ng their last year together=20

in India it was evident that downright antagonism had existed between Hugo =
Tancred and his little=20

son. Tony had weighed his father and found him wanting; and it was clear th=
