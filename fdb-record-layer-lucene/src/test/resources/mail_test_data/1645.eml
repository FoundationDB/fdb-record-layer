each carrying the story of their father's simple but beautiful work and the=
 remembrance of their=20

mother's message.  Not one from that home but did well his or her work in t=

greater, some smaller, but each left behind the traces of a life well spent=
.  And, as all good work is=20

n and one woman,=20

whose life on that little Dutch island changed its barren rocks to a bower =
of verdure, a home for the=20

birds and the song of the nightingale.  The grandchildren have gone to the =

others in Africa; still=20

others in our own land of America.  But each has tried, according to the ta=

BOY FIFTY YEARS AFTER   CHAPTER I  THE FIRST DAYS IN AMERICA  The leviathan=
 of the=20

Atlantic Ocean, in 1870, was _The Queen_, and when she was warped into her =
dock on=20

September 20 of that year, she discharged, among her passengers, a family o=
f four from the=20

Netherlands who were to make an experiment of Americanization.  The father,=
 a man bearing one=20

of the most respected names in the Netherlands, had acquired wealth and pos=
ition for himself;=20

unwise investments, however, had swept away his fortune, and in preference =
to a new start in his=20

own land, he had decided to make the new beginning in the United States, wh=
ere a favorite=20

brother-in-law had gone several years before.  But that, never a simple mat=
ter for a man who has=20

reached forty-two, is particularly difficult for a foreigner in a strange l=
and.  This fact he and his wife=20

were to find out.  The wife, also carefully reared, had been accustomed to =
a scale of living which=20

she had now to abandon.  Her Americanization experiment was to compel her, =
for the first time in=20

her life, to become a housekeeper without domestic help.  There were two bo=
ys: the elder,=20

William, was eight and a half years of age; the younger, in nineteen days f=
rom his landing-date,=20

was to celebrate his seventh birthday.  This younger boy was Edward William=
 Bok.  He had,=20

according to the Dutch custom, two other names, but he had decided to leave=
 those in the=20

Netherlands.  And the American public was, in later years, to omit for him =
the "William."  Edward's=20

first six days in the United States were spent in New York, and then he was=
 taken to Brooklyn,=20

where he was destined to live for nearly twenty years.  Thanks to the lingu=
istic sense inherent in=20

the Dutch, and to an educational system that compels the study of languages=
, English was already=20

familiar to the father and mother.  But to the two sons, who had barely lea=
rned the beginnings of=20

their native tongue, the English language was as a closed book.  It seemed =
a cruel decision of the=20

father to put his two boys into a public-school in Brooklyn, but he argued =
that if they were to=20

become Americans, the sooner they became part of the life of the country an=
