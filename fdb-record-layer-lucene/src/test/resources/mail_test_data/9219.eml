dracaena marginata senator found a little chunk of 'Twin Buttes' that he di=

strong to be doubted; and now there was an added blow from the hand of his =
father. He wheeled short upon the lumber-king.  "Who sent you to me, Mr. Ha=

he first officer.  "Heave it up," replied the captain, and went to the pilo=
t-house.  The "Big Four" had gone on board of the Maud, and she got under w=

 for the little steamer, which was regarded as the tender. Captain Scott ha=

"Let me be quite clear upon that point," said Blount; and if Hathaway had h=
ad eyes to see, he=20

would have observed that the young lawyer's attitude was becoming more judi=
cial with every fresh=20

questioning. "Let me be quite sure that I understand. You mean that you are=
 allowed to charge the=20

railroad company more than the market price on the material it buys?"  Hath=
away nodded. "Yes,=20

that's the way of it."  "And this preferential rate is still in force?"  "I=
t is."  "You're sure you have had=20

no notice of its withdrawal--say within the past few weeks?"  It was at thi=
s point that the lumber=20

lord began to fear that some one had slipped a cog in sending him to first =
one and then another,=20

and finally to young Blount.  "Of course, it hasn't been withdrawn!" he ret=
orted. And then: "You=20

seem to think there is something off color in the deal, Mr. Blount, and I d=
on't know whether you're=20

stringing me or whether you're too new in the railroad game to have the dop=
e. If you're going into=20

this political knock-down-and-drag-out, you ought to have the dope. There i=
sn't a big interest in=20

this State--ore-shippers, power people, irrigation companies, or any of 'em=
--that ain't getting a=20

rake-off. I guess you of subjects he believed in; and he had a sort of mild=
 contempt for one who=20

could discourse learnedly over a polype, and did not know the difference be=
tween a sea mile and=20

a statute mile.  "Do you believe in the explanation of that Dutchman you me=
ntioned, Captain=20

Ringgold?" asked Mr. Woolridge, at the close of the conference.  "What Dutc=
hman?" inquired the=20

commander. "I do not remember that I alluded to any Dutchman."  "I mean the=
 man who says that=20

Pharaoh's army perished in the lake where the weeds and papyrus grew," the =
magnate explained.=20

"Brugsch? He was not a Dutchman; he was a German."  "It is all the same thi=
ng; I have been in=20

the habit of calling a German a Dutchman."  "If you will excuse me, Mr. Woo=
lridge, I think it is a=20

very bad habit," added the commander with a deprecatory smile. "A German is=
 not a Dutchman,=20

any more than a Dutchman is a German; and I should as soon think of calling=
 a full-blooded=20

American a Chinaman, as a German a Dutchman."  "Of course you are right, Ca=
ptain, though I am=20

not alone in the use of the word," replied the magnate.  "But it is more co=
mmon among=20

uneducated people than with people of even fair education. I do not accept =
Brugsch's explanation,=20


_
_are_ stringing me; I guess you know all this a good deal better than I do.=
 If you don't, I can tell=20

you that it's a fact; not a 'has-been', but an 'is'! Ask Gantry; he'll tell=
 you, if he tells the truth. We=20

ain't asking or getting anything that other people ain't getting!"  "I see,=
" said Blount soberly. "What=20

do you expect me to do, Mr. Hathaway?"  "I want you to set the wheels in mo=
tion so that we can=20

have our rate made good for another two years--on the same terms as before.=
 You're going to=20

need every vote you can get this year, and you can't afford to turn us down=
." Then the lumber-king=20

shifted again to his own necessities. "It's the only way we can live and do=
 business nowadays.=20

Like every other large corporation, we've got an army of little investors t=
o look out for: widows,=20

orphans, charitable institutions, and trustees' accounts. I've got a list o=
f our stockholders right=20

here, and I'd like to have you look it over."  Blount took the paper mechan=
ically, and quite as=20

mechanically ran his eye down the list of names. At the bottom of it, writt=
en in with a pen, was the=20

name of Patricia's father, with his residence and occupation. While he was =
staring at the pen-

written name, Hathaway went on, eloquently emphasizing the disastrous resul=
ts which would fall=20

upon the people for whom he was, in the larger sense, a guardian and a trus=
tee--the disaster=20

hinging upon the withdrawal of the preferential rate.  Blount broke him abr=
uptly in the midst of the=20

special plea. "I see you have recently added one new name to this list: the=
 name of Professor=20

Anners. How--"  "Yes," interrupted the Twin Buttes diplomatist hastily, fea=
ring that this legal-

minded young man would presently be asking questions too hard to be answere=
d; "now there's a=20

case in point: Mr. Anners is a good example of our smaller stockholders. Me=
n like Anners, college=20

professors, preachers, and so on, buy stocks, when they buy 'em at all, for=
 an investment--for the=20

income--and they pay for 'em out of their hard-earned savings."  "I know," =
said Bible story as I=20

learned it in my childhood. I don't think Brugsch's explanation comes under=
 the head of what is=20

called the 'higher criticism,' or that it places him in the column of those=
 who represent the=20

'advanced thought' of the present time; for he follows the Scripture record=
, and does not seek to=20

invalidate it. But we are going to run into the basin, and it is time we we=
re moving," added the=20

commander, as he called the first officer, and ordered the anchor to be wei=
ghed.  "Do you have to=20

pay to go through the canal, Captain Ringgold?" asked Mrs. Belgrave, after =
the commander had=20

given his orders.  "Of course we do," replied the captain; and about all th=
e party gathered around=20

him to hear what he had to say. "As Mr. Woolridge said, the canal is good p=
aying stock to the=20

holders of the shares. It cost a vast sum of money, and it is worked and ke=
pt in running order at an=20

immense expense."  "I asked a foolish question, and I might have known bett=
er," said the lady.=20

"Every vessel that goes through to Suez has to pay a round sum for the priv=
ilege."  "Do all ships=20

have to pay the same amount?"  "Certainly not; for that would be very unfai=
r. They pay by the ton;=20

and every vessel carries a register, in which her tonnage is given. The Gua=
rdian-Mother's is 624=20

tons. About everything is French in this locality; and the rate charged is =
ten francs a ton, or a little=20

less than two dollars. I shall have to pay a bill of $1,248 in our money." =
 "That looks like an=20

enormous price," suggested Mrs. Woolridge.  "In addition to this charge, we=
 have to pay from ten=20

to twenty francs for a pilot, depending upon the tonnage, and the same for =
each passenger.=20

Through the greater portion of the canal the speed of steamers is limited t=
o five miles an hour;=20

otherwise the swash of the propeller would injure the embankments on either=
 side. It takes=20

steamers about sixteen hours to go through to Suez."  "But that is over six=
 miles an hour," Uncle=20

Moses objected.  "The three lakes, making nearly thirty miles of the distan=
ce,=20


_
diverted from his purpose by any conversational dust-throwing, he pressed t=
he question cut off by=20

the hasty interruption. "What I was going to ask was how you happen to have=
 added Professor=20

Anners's name to your list--recently, it seems?"  The lumberman was reduced=
 to the necessity of=20

inventing a ready lie. He had obeyed his instructions blindly, on the suppo=
sition that young Blount=20

would know and understand.  "Anners? Oh, he knows a good thing when he sees=
 it; and I guess=20

maybe your father put enough and deep enough to permit steamers to go ahead=
 at full speed,=20

which will more than make up the difference, and include the stay at Ismail=
ia. There are=20

sometimes unavoidable delays. A vessel may get aground, and bar the passage=
 for a day or two.=20

The canal is not in all places wide enough for one large steamer to pass an=
other, and there are=20

sidings, as on a single track railroad, where it can be done, a little more=
 than three miles apart.=20

Posts are set up every five kilometres to indicate the=20
