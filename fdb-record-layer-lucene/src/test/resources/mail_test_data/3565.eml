 we must think of nothing but your affairs. We must return instantly. The w=
hip will be an _
interchange of compliments; the sheik assured us that our unexpected arriva=
l among them was=20

"like the blessing of a new moon," the depth of which expression no one can=
 understand who has=20

not experienced life in the desert, where the first faint crescent is greet=
ed with such enthusiasm.=20

After a long conversation we were led to an excellent mat tent that had bee=
n vacated by one of his=20

sons, and shortly afterwards an admirable dinner of several dishes was sent=
 to us, while with=20

extreme good taste we were left undisturbed by visitors until the following=
 morning. Our men had=20

been regaled with a fat sheep, presented by the sheik, and all slept conten=
tedly.  At sunrise we=20

were visited by Abou Sinn. It appeared that, after our conversation of the =
preceding evening, he=20

had inquired of Mahomet concerning my future plans and intentions; he now c=
ame specially to=20

implore us not to proceed south at this season of the year, as it would be =
perfectly impossible to=20

travel; he described the country as a mass of mud, rendered so deep by the =
rains that no animal=20

could move; that the fly called the "seroot" had appeared, and that no dome=
stic said St.=20

Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CAnd so should I,=E2=80=9D whispered Bertram to Euphros=
yne, =E2=80=9Cwith the same companions.=E2=80=9D=20

When they had returned to the consulate, they found the post from England h=
ad arrived during=20

their absence. There were dispatches for all. It is an agitating moment=E2=
=80=94that arrival of letters in a=20

distant land. Lord St. Aldegonde seemed much disturbed when he tore open an=
d perused his. His=20

countenance became clouded; he dashed his hand through his dishevelled lock=
s; he pouted; and=20

then he said to Bertram, =E2=80=9CCome to my room.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnyth=
ing wrong at home?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot at home,=E2=80=9D said St.=20

Aldegonde. =E2=80=9CBertha is all right. But a most infernal letter from Gl=
yn=E2=80=94most insolent. If I do return I=20

will vote against them. But I will not return. I have made up my mind to th=
at. People are so selfish,=E2=80=9D=20

exclaimed St. Aldegonde, with indignation. =E2=80=9CThey never think of any=
 thing but themselves.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShow=20

me his letter,=E2=80=9D said Bertram. =E2=80=9CI have got a letter too; it =
is from the duke.=E2=80=9D  The letter of the=20

Opposition whip did not deserve the epithets ascribed to it by St. Aldegond=
e. It was urgent and=20

courteously peremptory; but, considering the circumstances of the=20


_
survive its attack; he declared that to continue our route would be mere in=
sanity: and he concluded=20

by giving us a most hospitable invitation to join his people on their road =
to the healthy country at=20

Gozerajup, and to become his guests for three or four months, until travell=
ing would be feasible in=20

the south, at which time he promised to assist me in my explorations by an =
escort of his own=20

people, who were celebrated elephant hunters, and knew the entire country b=
efore us. This was=20

an alluring programme; but after thanking him for his kindness, I explained=
 how much I disliked to=20

retrace my steps, which I should do by returning to Gozerajup; and that as =
I had heard of a=20

German who was living at the village of Sofi, on the Atbara, I should prefe=
r to pass the season of=20

the rains at that place, where I could gather information, and be ready on =
the spot to start for the=20

neighbouring Base country when the change of season should permit. After so=
me hesitation he=20

consented to this plan, and promised not only to mount us on our journey, b=
ut to send with us an=20

escort commanded by one of his grandsons. Sofi was about seventy-eight mile=
s distant.  Abou=20

Sinn had arranged to move northwards on the following day; we therefore agr=
eed to pass one day=20

in his camp, and to leave for Sofi the next morning. The ground upon which =
the Arab encampment=20

was situated was a tolerably flat surface, like a shelf, upon the slope of =
the Atbara valley, about=20

thirty or forty feet below the rich table lands; the surface of this was pe=
rfectly firm, as by the=20

constant rains it had been entirely denuded of the loam that had formed the=
 upper stratum. This=20

formed a charming place for the encampment of a large party, as the ground =
was perfectly clean,=20

a mixture of quartz pebbles upon a hard white sandstone. Numerous mimosas a=
fforded a shade,=20

beneath which the Arabs sat in groups, and at the bottom of the valley flow=
ed the Paired to Easter=20

by great indulgence, St. Aldegonde was passing Whitsuntide at Jerusalem. Th=
e parliamentary=20

position was critical, and the future of the Opposition seemed to depend on=
 the majority by which=20

their resolutions on the Irish Church were sent up to the House of Lords.  =
=E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said Bertram. =E2=80=9CI=20

see nothing to complain of in that letter. Except a little more urgency, it=
 is almost the same=20

language as reached us at Cairo, and then you said Glyn was a capital fello=
w, and seemed quite=20

pleased.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, because I hated Egypt,=E2=80=9D said St. A=
ldegonde. =E2=80=9CI hated the pyramids, and I was=20

disappointed with the dancing-girls; and it seemed to me that, if it had no=
t been for the whip, we=20

never should have been able to escape. But things are very different now.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, they are,=E2=80=9D said=20

Bertram, in a melancholy tone.  =E2=80=9CYou do not think of returning?=E2=
=80=9D said St. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CInstantly,=E2=80=9D=20

replied Bertram. =E2=80=9CI have a letter from the duke which is peremptory=
. The county is dissatisfied with=20

my absence. And mine is a queer constituency; very numerous and several lar=
ge towns; the=20

popularity of my family gained me the seat, not their absolute influence.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy constituents never=20

trouble me,=E2=80=9D said St. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CYou have none,=E2=80=9D =
said Bertram.  =E2=80=9CWell, if I were member for a=20

metropolitan district I would not budge. And I little thought you would hav=
e deserted me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D=20

sighed Bertram. =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re discontented, because your amusemen=
ts are interrupted. But think of my=20

position, torn from a woman whom I adore.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, you know=
 you must have left her sooner or=20

later,=E2=80=9D urged St. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D asked Bertram.=
  =E2=80=9CYou know what Lothair told us. She is=20

engaged to her cousin the Prince of Samos, and=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C=
If I had only the Prince of Samos to deal=20

with, I should care little,=E2=80=9D said Bertram.  =E2=80=9CWhy, what do y=
ou mean?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat Euphrosyne is mine, if=20

my family will sanction our union, but not otherwise.=E2=80=9D  St. Aldegon=
de gave=20


_
This tribe, which was peculiarly that of Abou Sinn, and from which he had s=
prung, was the=20

Shookeriyah, one of the most powerful among the numerous tribes of Upper Eg=
ypt.  From Korosko=20

to this point we had already passed the Bedouins, Bishareens, here. She is =
the only person I know=20

who has a head.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou see, my dear Granville, while you ar=
e talking of your little disappointments,=20

I am involved in awful difficulties.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are sure about =
the Palace of Samos?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CClear your head=20

of that. There is=20


_
Shookeriyahs. On the west of our present position were the Jalyns, and to t=
he south near Sofi=20

were the Dabainas. Many of the tribes claim a right to the title of Bedouin=
s, as descended from=20

that race. The customs of all the Arabs are nearly similar, and the distinc=
tion in appearance is=20

confined to a peculiarity in dressing the hair; this is a matter of great i=
mportance among both men=20

and women. It would be tedious to describe the minutiae of the various coif=
fures, but the great him=20

and Euphrosyne. The visit to the island was only a preliminary ceremony=E2=
=80=94just to show himself.=20

No doubt the father wishes the alliance; nor is there any reason to suppose=
 that it would be=20

disagreeable to the son; but, I repeat it=E2=80=94no engagement exists.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf I were not your brother-in-law,=20

I should have been very glad to have married Euphrosyne myself,=E2=80=9D sa=
id St. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CYes, but=20

what am I to do?=E2=80=9D asked Bertram, rather impatiently.  =E2=80=9CIt w=
ill not do to write to Brentham,=E2=80=9D=20
