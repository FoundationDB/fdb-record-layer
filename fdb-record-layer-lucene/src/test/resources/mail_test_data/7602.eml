philodendron monstera plow. On the other hand, the general tone of the agreements suggests that two or more people were participating in an enterprise in which each contributed to the the claws of the cat, and suddenly aroused from a profound sleep, imagined he was attacked by some wild beast of the forest.

On the other hand, the general tone of the agreements suggests that two or more people were participating in an enterprise in which each contributed to the the claws of the cat, and suddenly aroused from a profound sleep, imagined he was attacked by some wild beast of the forest. We ran to him on hearing his cries, _
were utterly shattered, and a sudden violent impulse urged him to return to Naples.  "Capri is not 

large enough to hold myself and David Beverley," he declared. "We'll go back by the night boat, 

Lorna. Meantime we'll borrow Signor Verdi's skiff and paddle about among the rocks. I feel easier 

on water than on land. I like the sense of a space of ocean round me. You can't suddenly meet a 

man when you've plenty of sea-room, can you?"  "No, no, Dad!" said Lorna, trying to soothe him. 

"We can walk down the steps to the cove and get the skiff, and be quite away from everybody 

once we are on the sea."  She was ready to humor his every whim, for in the blackness of her 

trouble nothing seemed at present to really matter. The whirling eddies of her thoughts rushed 

through her brain in a perpetual series of questions and answers. Must hate strike the death knell 

of love? Surely the only thing to do with an injury is to forgive it. Would revenge wipe out the wrong 

or in any way solve anything? No, there would only be one more wrong done in the world, to go on 

in ever-widening circles of hatred and misery. Curses, like chickens, come home to roost, and 

"getting even" may bring its own punishment.  "Our only chance is to go away and start afresh in a 

new country," she sobbed. "At the other side of the Pacific we might forget--but no! Renie! Renie! 

If I go to the back of beyond I shan't forget you, and all you've been to me. The memory of you, 

darling, will last until the end of my life."  Mr. Carson found Signor Verdi working in his allotment, 

obtained leave from him to use the skiff, and climbing down the flight of steep steps cut in the rock, 

reached the cove where the boat was beached on the shingle. He had been an expert oarsman 

from his college days, and understood Neapolitan waters, so in a short time he and Lorna were 

skimming gently over the surface of the blue sea, keeping well away from rocks and out of 

currents, but within reasonable distance of the land. Sometimes they rowed and sometimes they 

drifted, hardly caring in what direction they steered so long as they circled round the island. Their 

only object was to stop out on the sea, and, as they had brought a picnic basket with them, there 

was nothing to urge their return until sunset. In the course of the afternoon they had coasted below 

Monte Solaro, and found themselves approaching the entrance that led to the Blue Grotto. In the 

mornings, when the steamer brought its crowd of tourists, there was generally quite a little fleet of 

skiffs to be seen here, but now, with the exception of a solitary boat, the famous cavern was 

deserted. To avoid passing too near to even this one craft Mr. Carson steered away from the 

shore, but turned his head in consternation, for loud and unmistakable cries of "help" were ringing 

over the water, and the occupants, frantically waving handkerchiefs, were evidently doing their 

utmost to attract his attention. Common humanity demanded that he must at least go and see 

what was the matter, so he reluctantly altered his course.  In a boat close to the entrance of the 

grotto were several young people, and Lorna instantly recognized Angus, Stewart, Jess, Michael, 

and Peachy. They appeared in much anxiety, and directly they were within hailing distance they 

called out their news:  "Mr. Beverley and Vincent and Irene have gone inside the grotto, and they 

don't seem able to get out again. We can hear them shouting for help."  The party, in their British 

imprudence, had not brought a boatman, and they were uncertain what to do. Their own barque 

was too large to go through the narrow opening into the cavern, and they looked hopefully at Mr. 

Carson's little skiff.  "We don't know what's happened," gulped Jess.  "They went in to explore the 

Roman passage."  "Just by themselves."  "They've been gone such a long time," volunteered the 

others.  "Listen," said Peachy.  For from out the low entrance of the grotto floated a faint far-off 

echoing ghost of a shout.  Lorna glanced imploringly at her father. He did not hesitate for a 



moment. The man who had injured him was inside the cavern, perhaps in deadly danger, and he 

was going to risk his own life and his daughter's to save him. And risk there undoubtedly was. A 

breeze had arisen and agitated the surface of the water, so that the ingress was smaller than ever 

and more difficult to compass. When waves lashed the tideless Mediterranean even the Capri 

fishermen shunned entering the grotto, for they knew its perils only too well. Telling Lorna to lie flat 

on her back Mr. Carson took the same position, and with infinite difficulty managed to maneuver 

the skiff into the rocky entrance. There was barely room, for each wave bumped it against the roof, 

but by clinging to the chain he worked his way along and shot through into the lake within. On the 

right of the cavern three figures, holding a light, stood on a kind of landing-place, while a skiff 

drifting far off in the shadows told its own tale.  Mr. Carson rowed at once to retrieve the truant 

boat, and towed it back to its owners.  "We thought we had tied it securely," explained Mr. 

Beverley. "We were utterly aghast when we came back and found it had drifted. It would have 

been a horrible experience to stay here all night. If the sea rose we might even have been 

imprisoned for days. We were fools to come, but I didn't realize the danger."  "The sea is much 

rougher already," said Mr. Carson. "It'll be a ticklish matter to get out again, and the sooner we do 

it the better. Will you go first and I'll follow on after?"  "It's like you, Lorna, to come to rescue us. I 

always called you my good angel," choked Irene, as she entered the skiff. "I thought just now I 

was never going to see you again in this world. Let's get out of this horrible place as fast as we 

can. It's like Dante's Inferno. I've never been so frightened in all my life."  One after the other the 

two skiffs started on their risky exit from the grotto, scraping and bumping against the roof with the 

water on a level with the gunwale; one wave indeed overflowed and soused them, but the next 

moment they sighted the sky and grazing through the entrance they gained the open water.  It was 

only when, in the clear afternoon daylight he turned to thank his rescuer that a flash of recognition 

flooded Mr. Beverley's face.  "Cedric Houghten! You! You!" he stammered, as if almost 

disbelieving the evidence of his own eyes.  "Yes, it is I; but having seen me, forget me," returned 

Mr. Carson, his dark face flushed and his hand on the oar. "It's the one favor you can do me for 

saving you. Let me vanish as I came, and don't try to follow me. I only hope we may never cross 

each other's paths again."  "Cedric! Come back!" yelled Mr. Beverley, as the skiff shot away. "Man 

alive! We've been searching for you for years. Don't you know that we've proved your innocence! 

Come back, I say, and let me tell you."         *       *       *       *       *  It was late that evening, after a 

very long talk with Mr. Beverley, that Lorna's father explained to her the circumstances that had 

cleared his name.  "David had no more embezzled the money than I, and, thank God, he has no 

idea I ever distrusted him. When a further sum went, Mr. Fenton set a trap, and discovered to his 

infinite grief that it was his own son who had been robbing the firm. It practically broke him, and he 

has retired from all active share in the business now. They packed young Fenton off to New 

Zealand to try farming instead of finance, but he's not doing any good there. Mr. Fenton, it seems, 

was most anxious to find me and right the injustice done me, but I had hidden myself so well under 

an assumed name in Naples that it was impossible for them to trace me. They advertised in the 

Agony column of _The Times_, but I avoided English papers, so never saw the advertisements. 

My efforts to escape notice were only too successful, and, although I didn't know it, I was actually 

defeating my own ends by my caution. If, as I intended, I had started for a new continent, I might 

so completely have broken all links with my old life that I might have gone to my grave in 



ignorance that my innocence was proved. It was only the marvelous chance of this afternoon's 

meeting that cleared up the tangle. I can look the world in the face again, now, and not fear the 

sight of an Englishman. Oh, the joy of having got one's honor back untarnished! Next best to that 

is to know it was not my friend who had wronged me. The belief in his treachery was half the 

bitterness of those dreadful years. Capri has been a fortunate island for us, Lorna. It's truly called 

the 'Mascot of Naples,' and I shall love it to the end of my days. I can take my old name again now 

and be proud of it. You're Lorna Houghten in future, not Lorna Carson. What a triumph to write to 

our relations and tell them the glorious news. I feel like a man let loose from slavery."  To Lorna 

also this happy consummation of all their troubles seemed a relief almost too great for expression. 

That Irene, her own Renie, should be the daughter of her father's favorite friend, and therefore a 

hereditary as well as a chosen chum, was a special delight, for it welded the links that bound them 

together. The future shone rosy, and she felt that wherever her life might be cast the Beverleys 

would always remain part and parcel of it. Perhaps the triumph she appreciated most of all was 

the introduction of her father to the Cameron Clan. No more hiding in out-of-the-way corners and 

avoiding the very sound of a British voice; henceforth they might hold up their heads with the rest 

and take again their true position. She was proud of her father: now that the black cloak of despair 

had dropped away from him, his old happier nature shone out and he seemed suddenly ten years 

younger. To present him into the intimate circle of her friends realized her dearest wish.  "It's been 

a wonderful week-end," said Peachy, standing with her girl friends on the quay to wave good-by to 

the Monday morning steamer that bore some of their relations back to Naples and business. 

"Here's Lorna with a new name, and Renie with a fresh cousin. Haven't you heard? Why, Captain 

Preston popped the question last night, and he and Marjorie announced their engagement at the 

breakfast table. Not the most romantic place to glean up congratulations, but, of course, that's just 

as you think about it. When _I_ get engaged it shall be announced by moonlight, so that I can hide 

my blushes. I don't ever want the holidays to end. Capri's the dandiest place in Italy, and if Dad 

doesn't buy a villa here I'll never forgive him. You want one too, Lorna? Hooray! We'll make a 

Colony of Camellia Buds on the little island and spend the summer here. We may be globe-trotters 

and all the rest of it, but I vote we get up a good old Anglo-Saxon League and stick together for 

better or for worse. I'll buy a Union Jack to-day if the Cameron Clan will promise to wave the Stars 

and Stripes, and sing 'Yankee Doodle' with 'Auld Lang Syne.'"  "We've welded America already 

into the clan, dear bairn," smiled Mrs. Cameron. "No other visitor keeps us alive like you do." 

"Pronounce thy wishes, O Peach of the West," laughed Stewart. "We rechristen thee Queen of the 

South."  "Then I summon you all some day to come back to this, my kingdom by the sea. School is 

school and I've got to have another term there, but I want to feel this happy island is waiting for us 

to return to it. You promise? Thanks! Here's a new version then of the old song--composed by 

Miss Priscilla Proctor, please!            'Should auld adventures be forgot            And ne'er provoke a 

smile?            Should auld adventures be forgot            Upon this happy isle?            For auld lang 

syne, my dears, for auld lang syne,            We'll all return to Capri's shore for auld lang syne.' 

H'm--a poor thing, but mine own!"  "There are two of us at any rate who won't forget to come 

back," said Lorna, linking her arm fondly in Irene's as they walked away from the quay.   THE 

END.           *       *       *       *       *    Transcriber's Notes:     Obvious punctuation errors repaired.

hygrometer of Deluc was at 53 degrees, the centigrade thermometer 23.7 degrees, and 

Saussure's hygrometer 87.5 degrees. The electrometer gave no sign of electricity. As the storm 

gathered, the blue of the sky changed at first to deep azure and then to grey. The vesicular vapour 

became visible, and the thermometer rose three degrees, as is almost always the case, within the 

tropics, from a cloudy sky which reflects the radiant heat of the soil. A heavy rain fell. Being 

sufficiently habituated to the climate not to fear the effect of tropical rains, we remained on the 

shore to observe the electrometer. I held it more than twenty minutes in my hand, six feet above 

the ground, and observed that in general the pith-balls separated only a few seconds before the 

lightning was seen. The separation was four lines. The electric charge remained the same during 

several minutes; and having time to determine the nature of the electricity, by approaching a stick 

of sealing-wax, I saw here what I had often observed on the ridge of the Andes during a storm, 

that the electricity of the atmosphere was first positive, then nil, and then negative. These 

oscillations from positive to negative were often repeated. Yet the electrometer constantly 

denoted, a little before the lightning, only E., or positive E., and never negative E. Towards the end 

of the storm the west wind blew very strongly. The clouds dispersed, and the thermometer sunk to 



22 degrees on account of the evaporation from the soil, and the freer radiation towards the sky.  I 

have entered into these details on the electric charge of the atmosphere because travellers in 

general confine themselves to the description of the impressions produced on a European newly 

arrived by the solemn spectacle of a tropical storm. In a country where the year is divided into 

great seasons of drought and wet, or, as the Indians say in their expressive language, of sun* (* In 

the Maypure dialect camoti, properly the heat [of the sun]. The Tamanacs call the season of 

drought uamu, the time of grasshoppers.) and rain* (* In the Tamanac language canepo. The year 

is designated, among several nations, by the name of one of the two seasons. The Maypures say, 

so many suns, (or rather so many heats;) the Tamanacs, so many rains.), it is highly interesting to 

follow the progress of meteorological phenomena in the transition from one season to another. We 

had already observed, in the valleys of Aragua from the 18th and 19th of February, clouds forming 

at the commencement of the night. In the beginning of the month of March the accumulation of the 

vesicular vapours, visible to the eye, and with them signs of atmospheric electricity, augmented 

daily. We saw flashes of heat-lightning to the south; and the electrometer of Volta constantly 

displayed, at sunset, positive electricity. The pith balls, unexcited during the day, separated to the 

width of three or four lines at the commencement of the night, which is triple what I generally 

observed in Europe, with the same instrument, in calm weather. Upon the whole, from the 26th of 

May, the electrical equilibrium of the atmosphere seemed disturbed. During whole hours the 

electricity was nil, then it became very strong, and soon after was again imperceptible. The 

hygrometer of Deluc continued to indicate great dryness (from 33 to 35 degrees), and yet the 

atmosphere appeared no longer the same. Amidst these perpetual variations of the electric state 

of the air, the trees, divested of their foliage, already began to unfold new leaves, and seemed to 

feel the approach of spring.  The variations which we have just described are not peculiar to one 

year. Everything in the equinoctial zone has a wonderful uniformity of succession, because the 

active powers of nature limit and balance each other, according to laws that are easily recognized. 

I shall here note the progress of atmospherical phenomena in the islands to the east of the 

Cordilleras of Merida and of New Grenada, in the Llanos of Venezuela and the Rio Meta, from four 

to ten degrees of north latitude, wherever the rains are constant from May to October, and 

comprehending consequently the periods of the greatest heats, which occur in July and August.* 

(* The maximum of the heat is not felt on the coast, at Cumana, at La Guayra, and in the 

neighbouring island of Margareta, before the month of September; and the rains, if the name can 

be given to a few drops that fall at intervals, are observed only in the months of October and 

November.)  Nothing can equal the clearness of the atmosphere from the month of December to 

that of February. The sky is then constantly without clouds; and if one should appear, it is a 

phenomenon that engages the whole attention of the inhabitants. A breeze from the east, and 

from east-north-east, blows with violence. As it brings with it air always of the same temperature, 

the vapours cannot become visible by cooling.  About the end of February and the beginning of 

March, the blue of the sky is less intense, the hygrometer indicates by degrees greater humidity, 

the stars are sometimes veiled by a slight stratum of vapour, and their light is no longer steady and 

planetary; they are seen twinkling from time to time when at 20 degrees above the horizon. The 

breeze at this period becomes less strong, less regular, and is often interrupted by dead calms. 

The clouds accumulate towards south-south-east, appearing like distant mountains, with outlines 



strongly marked. From time to time they detach themselves from the horizon, and traverse the 

vault of the sky with a rapidity which little corresponds with the feeble wind prevailing in the lower 

strata of the air. At the end of March, the southern region of the atmosphere is illumined by small 

electric explosions. They are like phosphorescent gleams, circumscribed by vapour. The breeze 

then shifts from time to time, and for several hours together, to the west and south-west. This is a 

certain sign of the approach of the rainy season, which begins at the Orinoco about the end of 

April. The blue sky disappears, and a grey tint spreads uniformly over it. At the same time the heat 

of the atmosphere progressively increases; and soon the heavens are no longer obscured by 

clouds, but by condensed vapours. The plaintive cry of the howling apes begins to be heard before 

sunrise. The atmospheric electricity, which, during the season of drought, from December to 

March, had been constantly, in the day-time, from 1.7 to 2 lines, becomes extremely variable from 

the month of March. It appears nil during whole days; and then for some hours the pith-balls 

diverge three or four lines. The atmosphere, which is generally, in the torrid as well as in the 

temperate zone, in a state of positive electricity, passes alternately, for eight or ten minutes, to the 

negative state. The season of rains is that of storms; and yet a great number of experiments made 

during three years, prove to me that it is precisely in this season of storms we find the smallest 

degree of electric tension in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Are storms the effect of this 

unequal charge of the different superincumbent strata of air? What prevents the electricity from 

descending towards the earth, in air which becomes more humid after the month of March? The 

electricity at this period, instead of being diffused throughout the whole atmosphere, appears 

accumulated on the exterior envelope, at the surface of the clouds. According to M. Gay-Lussac it 

is the formation of the cloud itself that carries the fluid toward its surface. The storm rises in the 

plains two hours after the sun has passed the meridian; consequently a short time after the 

moment of the maximum of diurnal heat within the tropics. It is extremely rare in the islands to 

hear thunder during the night, or in the morning. Storms at night are peculiar to certain valleys of 

rivers, having a peculiar climate.  What then are the causes of this rupture of the equilibrium in the 

electric tension of the air? of this continual condensation of the vapours into water? of this 

interruption of the breezes? of this commencement and duration of the rainy seasons? I doubt 

whether electricity has any influence on the formation of vapours. It is rather the formation of these 

vapours that augments and modifies the electrical tension. North and south of the equator, storms 

or great explosions take place at the same time in the temperate and in the equinoctial zone. Is 

there an action propagated through the great aerial ocean from the temperate zone towards the 

tropics? How can it be conceived, that in that zone where the sun rises constantly to so great a 

height above the horizon, its passage through the zenith can have so powerful an influence on the 

meteorological variations? I am of opinion that no local cause determines the commencement of 

the rains within the tropics; and that a more intimate knowledge of the higher currents of air will 

elucidate these problems, so complicated in appearance. We can observe only what passes in the 

lower strata of the atmosphere. The Andes are scarcely inhabited beyond the height of two 

thousand toises; and at that height the proximity of the soil, and the masses of mountains, which 

form the shoals of the aerial ocean, have a sensible influence on the ambient air. What we 

observe on the table-land of Antisana is not what we should find at the same height in a balloon, 

hovering over the Llanos or the surface of the ocean.  We have just seen that the season of rains 



and storms in the northern equinoctial zone coincides with the passage of the sun through the 

zenith of the place,* (* These passages take place, in the fifth and tenth degrees of north latitude 

between the 3rd and the 16th of April, and between the 27th of August and the 8th of September.) 

with the cessation of the north-east breezes, and with the frequency of calms and bendavales, 

which are stormy winds from south-east and south-west, accompanied by a cloudy sky. I believe 

that, in reflecting on the general laws of the equilibrium of the gaseous masses constituting our 

atmosphere, we may find, in the interruption of the current that blows from an homonymous pole, 

in the want of the renewal of air in the torrid zone, and in the continued action of an ascending 

humid current, a very simple cause of the coincidence of these phenomena. While the north-

easterly breeze blows with all its violence north of the equator, it prevents the atmosphere which 

covers the equinoctial lands and seas from saturating itself with moisture. The hot and moist air of 

the torrid zone rises aloft, and flows off again towards the poles; while inferior polar currents, 

bringing drier and colder strata, are every instant taking the place of the columns of ascending air. 

By this constant action of two opposite currents, the humidity, far from being accumulated in the 

equatorial region, is carried towards the cold and temperate regions. During this season of 

breezes, which is that when the sun is in the southern signs, the sky in the northern equinoctial 

zone is constantly serene. The vesicular vapours are not condensed, because the air, unceasingly 

renewed, is far from the point of saturation. In proportion as the sun, entering the northern signs, 

rises towards the zenith, the breeze from the north-east moderates, and by degrees entirely 

ceases. The difference of temperature between the tropics and the temperate northern zone is 

then the least possible. It is the summer of the boreal pole; and, if the mean temperature of the 

winter, between 42 and 52 degrees of north latitude, be from 20 to 26 degrees of the centigrade 

thermometer less than the equatorial heat, the difference in summer is scarcely from 4 to 6 

degrees. The sun being in the zenith, and the breeze having ceased, the causes which produce 

humidity, and accumulate it in the northern equinoctial zone, become at once more active. The 

column of air reposing on this zone, is saturated with vapours, because it is no longer renewed by 

the polar current. Clouds form in this air saturated and cooled by the combined effects of radiation 

and the dilatation of the ascending air. This air augments its capacity for heat in proportion as it 

rarefies. With the formation and collection of the vesicular vapours, electricity accumulates in the 

higher regions of the atmosphere. The precipitation of the vapours is continual during the day; but 

it generally ceases at night, and frequently even before sunset. The showers are regularly more 

violent, and accompanied with electric explosions, a short time after the maximum of the diurnal 

heat. This state of things remains unchanged, till the sun enters into the southern signs. This is the 

commencement of cold in the northern temperate zone. The current from the north-pole is then re-

established, because the difference between the heat of the equinoctial and temperate regions 

augments daily. The north-east breeze blows with violence, the air of the tropics is renewed, and 

can no longer attain the degree of saturation. The rains consequently cease, the vesicular vapour 

is dissolved, and the sky resumes its clearness and its azure tint. Electrical explosions are no 

longer heard, doubtless because electricity no longer comes in contact with the groups of vesicular 

vapours in the high regions of the air, I had almost said the coating of clouds, on which the fluid 

can accumulate.  We have here considered the cessation of the breezes as the principal cause of 

the equatorial rains. These rains in each hemisphere last only as long as the sun has its 



declination in that hemisphere. It is necessary to observe, that the absence of the breeze is not 

always succeeded by a dead calm; but that the calm is often interrupted, particularly along the 

western coast of America, by bendavales, or south-west and south-east winds. This phenomenon 

seems to demonstrate that the columns of humid air which rise in the northern equatorial zone, 

sometimes flow off toward the south pole. In fact, the countries situated in the torrid zone, both 

north and south of the equator, furnish, during their summer, while the sun is passing through their 

zenith, the maximum of difference of temperature with the air of the opposite pole. The southern 

temperate zone has its winter, while it rains on the north of the equator; and while a mean heat 

prevails from 5 to 6 degrees greater than in the time of drought, when the sun is lower.* (* From 

the equator to 10 degrees of north latitude the mean temperatures of the summer and winter 

months scarcely differ 2 or 3 degrees; but at the limits of the torrid zone, toward the tropic of 

Cancer, the difference amounts to 8 or 9 degrees.) The continuation of the rains, while the 

bendavales blow, proves that the currents from the remoter pole do not act in the northern 

equinoctial zone like the currents of the nearer pole, on account of the greater humidity of the 

southern polar current. The air, wafted by this current, comes from a hemisphere consisting almost 

entirely of water. It traverses all the southern equatorial zone to reach the parallel of 8 degrees 

north latitude; and is consequently less dry, less cold, less adapted to act as a counter-current to 

renew the equinoctial air and prevent its saturation, than the northern polar current, or the breeze 

from the north-east.* (* In the two temperate zones the air loses its transparency every time that 

the wind blows from the opposite pole, that is to say, from the pole that has not the same 

denomination as the hemisphere in which the wind blows.) We may suppose that the bendavales 

are impetuous winds which, on some coasts, for instance on that of Guatimala, (because they are 

not the effect of a regular and progressive descent of the air of the tropics towards the south pole, 

but they alternate with calms), are accompanied by electrical explosions, and are in fact squalls, 

that indicate a reflux, an abrupt and instantaneous rupture, of equilibrium in the aerial ocean.  We 

have here discussed one of the most important phenomena of the meteorology of the tropics, 

considered in its most general view. In the same manner as the limits of the trade-winds do not 

form circles parallel with the equator, the action of the polar currents is variously felt in different 

meridians. The chains of mountains and the coasts in the same hemisphere have often opposite 

seasons. There are several examples of these anomalies; but, in order to discover the laws of 

nature, we must know, before we examine into the causes of local perturbations, the average state 

of the atmosphere, and the constant type of its variations.  The aspect of the sky, the progress of 

the electricity, and the shower of the 28th of March, announced the commencement of the rainy 

season; we were still advised, however, to go from San Fernando de Apure by San Francisco de 

Capanaparo, the Rio Sinaruco, and the Hato de San Antonio, to the village of the Ottomacs, 

recently founded near the banks of the Meta, and to embark on the Orinoco a little above 

Carichana. This way by land lies across an unhealthy and feverish country. An old farmer named 

Francisco Sanchez obligingly offered to conduct us. His dress denoted the great simplicity of 

manners prevailing in those distant countries. He had acquired a fortune of more than 100,000 

piastres, and yet he mounted on horseback with his feet bare, and wearing large silver spurs. We 

knew by the experience of several weeks the dull uniformity of the vegetation of the Llanos, and 

preferred the longer road, which leads by the Rio Apure to the Orinoco. We chose one of those 



very large canoes called lanchas by the Spaniards. A pilot and four Indians were sufficient to 

manage it. They constructed, near the stern, in the space of a few hours, a cabin covered with 

palm-leaves, sufficiently spacious to contain a table and benches. These were made of ox-hides, 

strained tight, and nailed to frames of brazil-wood. I mention these minute circumstances, to prove 

that our accommodations on the Rio Apure were far different from those to which we were 

afterwards reduced in the narrow boats of the Orinoco. We loaded the canoe with provision for a 

month. Fowls, eggs, plantains, cassava, and cacao, are found in abundance at San Fernando. 

The good Capuchin, Fray Jose Maria de Malaga, gave us sherry wine, oranges, and tamarinds, to 

make cooling beverages. We could easily foresee that a roof constructed of palm-tree leaves 

would become excessively hot on a large river, where we were almost always exposed to the 

perpendicular rays of the sun. The Indians relied less on the provision we had purchased, than on 

their hooks and nets. We took also some fire-arms, which we found in general use as far as the 

cataracts; but farther south the great humidity of the air prevents the missionaries from using 

them. The Rio Apure abounds in fish, manatees, and turtles, the eggs of which afford an aliment 

more nutritious than agreeable to the taste. Its banks are inhabited by an innumerable quantity of 

birds, among which the pauxi and the guacharaca, which may be called the turkeys and 

pheasants of those countries, are found to be the most useful. Their flesh appeared to be harder 

and less white than that of the gallinaceous tribe in Europe, because they use much more 

muscular exercise. We did not forget to add to our provision, fishing-tackle, fire-arms, and a few 

casks of brandy, to serve as a medium of barter with the Indians of the Orinoco.  We departed 

from San Fernando on the 30th of March, at four in the afternoon. The weather was extremely hot; 

the thermometer rising in the shade to 34 degrees, though the breeze blew very strongly from the 

south-east. Owing to this contrary wind we could not set our sails. We were accompanied, in the 

whole of this voyage on the Apure, the Orinoco, and the Rio Negro, by the brother-in-law of the 

governor of the province of Varinas, Don Nicolas Soto, who had recently arrived from Cadiz. 

Desirous of visiting countries so calculated to excite the curiosity of a European, he did not 

hesitate to confine himself with us during seventy-four days in a narrow boat infested with 

mosquitos. His amiable disposition and gay temper often helped to make us forget the sufferings 

of a voyage which was not wholly exempt from danger. We passed the mouth of the Apurito, and 

coasted the island of the same name, formed by the Apure and the Guarico. This island is in fact 

only a very low spot of ground, bordered by two great rivers, both of which, at a little distance from 

each other, fall into the Orinoco, after having formed a junction below San Fernando by the first 

bifurcation of the Apure. The Isla del Apurito is twenty-two leagues in length, and two or three 

leagues in breadth. It is divided by the Cano de la Tigrera and the Cano del Manati into three 

parts, the two extremes of which bear the names of Isla de Blanco and Isla de los Garzitas. The 

right bank of the Apure, below the Apurito, is somewhat better cultivated than the left bank, where 

the Yaruros, or Japuin Indians, have constructed a few huts with reeds and stalks of palm-leaves. 

These people, who live by hunting and fishing, are very skilful in killing jaguars. It is they who 

principally carry the skins, known in Europe by the name of tiger-skins, to the Spanish villages. 

Some of these Indians have been baptized, but they never visit the Christian churches. They are 

considered as savages because they choose to remain independent. Other tribes of Yaruros live 

under the rule of the missionaries, in the village of Achaguas, situated south of the Rio Payara. 



The individuals of this nation, whom I had an opportunity of seeing at the Orinoco, have a stern 

expression of countenance; and some features in their physiognomy, erroneously called Tartarian, 

belong to branches of the Mongol race, the eye very long, the cheekbones high, but the nose 

prominent throughout its whole length. They are taller, browner, and less thick-set than the 

Chayma Indians. The missionaries praise the intellectual character of the Yaruros, who were 

formerly a powerful and numerous nation on the banks of the Orinoco, especially in the environs of 

Cuycara, below the mouth of the Guarico. We passed the night at Diamante, a small sugar-

plantation formed opposite the island of the same name.  During the whole of my voyage from San 

Fernando to San Carlos del Rio Negro, and thence to the town of Angostura, I noted down day by 

day, either in the boat or where we disembarked at night, all that appeared to me worthy of 

observation. Violent rains, and the prodigious quantity of mosquitos with which the air is filled on 

the banks of the Orinoco and the Cassiquiare, necessarily occasioned some interruptions; but I 

supplied the omission by notes taken a few days after. I here subjoin some extracts from my 

journal. Whatever is written while the objects we describe are before our eyes bears a

shore till noon. We saw a part of some cane-fields laid waste by the effect of a conflagration which 

had spread from a neighbouring forest. The wandering Indians everywhere set fire to the forest 

where they have encamped at night; and during the season of drought, vast provinces would be 

the prey of these conflagrations if the extreme hardness of the wood did not prevent the trees from 

being entirely consumed. We found trunks of desmanthus and mahogany which were scarcely 

charred two inches deep.  Having passed the Diamante we entered a land inhabited only by tigers, 

crocodiles, and chiguires; the latter are a large species of the genus Cavia of Linnaeus. We saw 

flocks of birds, crowded so closely together as to appear against the sky like a dark cloud which 

every instant changed its form. The river widens by degrees. One of its banks is generally barren 

and sandy from the effect of inundations; the other is higher, and covered with lofty trees. In some 

parts the river is bordered by forests on each side, and forms a straight canal a hundred and fifty 

toises broad. The manner in which the trees are disposed is very remarkable. We first find bushes 

of sauso,* (* Hermesia castaneifolia. This is a new genus, approaching the alchornea of Swartz.) 

forming a kind of hedge four feet high, and appearing as if they had been clipped by the hand of 

man. A copse of cedar, brazilletto, and lignum-vitae, rises behind this hedge. Palm-trees are rare; 

we saw only a few scattered trunks of

Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm corozo. The large quadrupeds 

of those regions, the jaguars, tapirs, and peccaries, have made openings in the hedge of sauso 

which we have just described. Through these the wild animals pass when they come to drink at 

the river. As they fear but little the approach of a boat, we had the pleasure of viewing them as 

they paced slowly along the shore till they disappeared in the forest, which they entered by one of 

the narrow passes left at intervals between the bushes. These scenes, which were often repeated, 

had ever for me a peculiar attraction. The pleasure they excite is not owing solely to the interest 

which the naturalist takes in the objects of his study, it is connected with a feeling common to all 

men who have been brought up in the habits of civilization. You find yourself in a new world, in the 

midst of untamed and savage nature. Now the jaguar--the beautiful panther of America--appears 

upon the shore; and now the hocco,* (* Ceyx alector, the peacock-pheasant; C. pauxi, the 

cashew-bird.) with its black plumage and tufted head, moves slowly along the sausos. Animals of 

the most different classes succeed each other. "Esse como en el Paradiso," "It is just as it was in 

Paradise," said our pilot, an old Indian of the Missions. Everything, indeed, in these regions recalls 

to mind the state of the primitive world with its innocence and felicity. But in carefully observing the 

manners of animals among themselves, we see that they mutually avoid and fear each other. The 

golden age has ceased; and in this Paradise of the American forests, as well as everywhere else, 

sad and long experience has taught all beings that benignity is seldom found in alliance with 

strength.  When the shore is of considerable breadth, the hedge of sauso remains at a distance 



from the river. In the intermediate space we see crocodiles, sometimes to the number of eight or 

ten, stretched on the sand. Motionless, with their jaws wide open, they repose by each other, 

without displaying any of those marks of affection observed in other animals living in society. The 

troop separates as soon as they quit the shore. It is, however, probably composed of one male 

only, and many females; for as M. Descourtils, who has so much studied the crocodiles of St.

fighting during the season of their loves. These monstrous creatures are so numerous, that 

throughout the whole course of the river we had almost at every instant five or six in view. Yet at 

this period the swelling of the Rio Apure was scarcely perceived; and consequently hundreds of 



crocodiles were still buried in the mud of the savannahs. About four in the afternoon we stopped to 

measure a dead crocodile which had been cast ashore. It was only sixteen feet eight inches long; 

some days after M. Bonpland found another, a male, twenty-two feet three inches long. In every 

zone, in America as in Egypt, this animal attains the same size. The species so abundant in the 

Apure, the Orinoco,* (* It is the arua of the Tamanac Indians, the amana of the Maypure Indians, 

the Crocodilus acutus of Cuvier.) and the Rio de la Magdalena, is not a cayman, but a real 

crocodile, analogous to that of the Nile, having feet dentated at the external edges. When it is 

recollected that the male enters the age of puberty only at ten years, and that its length is then 

eight feet, we may presume that the crocodile measured by M. Bonpland was at least twenty-eight 

years old. The Indians told us, that at San Fernando scarcely a year passes, without two or three 

grown-up persons, particularly women who fetch water from the river, being drowned by these 

carnivorous reptiles. They related to us the history of a young girl of Uritucu, who by singular 

intrepidity and presence of mind, saved herself from the jaws of a crocodile. When she felt herself 

seized, she sought the eyes of the animal, and plunged her fingers into them with such violence, 

that the pain forced the crocodile to let her go, after having bitten off the lower part of her left arm. 

The girl, notwithstanding the enormous quantity of blood she lost, reached the shore, swimming 

with the hand that still remained to her. In those desert countries, where man is ever wrestling with 

nature, discourse daily turns on the best means that may be employed to escape from a tiger, a 

boa, or a crocodile; every one prepares himself in some sort for the dangers that may await him. "I 

knew," said the young girl of Uritucu coolly, "that the cayman lets go his hold, if you push your 

fingers into his eyes." Long after my return to Europe, I learned that in the interior of Africa the 

negroes know and practise the same means of defence. Who does not recollect, with lively 

interest, Isaac, the guide of the unfortunate Mungo Park, who was seized twice by a crocodile, and 

twice escaped from the jaws of the monster, having succeeded in thrusting his fingers into the 

creature's eyes while under water. The African Isaac, and the young American girl, owed their 

safety to the same presence of mind, and the same combination of ideas.  The movements of the 

crocodile of the Apure are sudden and rapid when it attacks any object; but it moves with the 

slowness of a salamander, when not excited by rage or hunger. The animal in running makes a 

rustling noise, which seems to proceed from the rubbing of the scales of its skin one against 

another. In this movement it bends its back, and appears higher on its legs than when at rest. We 

often heard this rattling of the scales very near us on the shore; but it is not true, as the Indians 

pretend, that, like the armadillo, the old crocodiles "can erect their scales, and every part of their 

armour." The motion of these animals is no doubt generally in a straight line, or rather like that of 

an arrow, supposing it to change its direction at certain distances. However, notwithstanding the 

little apparatus of false ribs, which connects

crocodiles can turn easily when they please. I often saw young ones biting their tails; and other 

observers have seen the same action in crocodiles at their full growth. If their movements almost 

always appear to be straight forward, it is because, like our small lizards, they move by starts. 

Crocodiles are excellent swimmers; they go with facility against the most rapid current. It appeared 

to me, however, that in descending the river, they had some difficulty in turning quickly about. A 

large dog, which had accompanied us in our journey from Caracas to the Rio Negro, was one day

Deere in 1837 invented a plow that could be used     successfully in the sticky, root-filled soil of the 

prairie.     It was called a steel plow. Actually, it appears that only the     cutting edge, the share, on 

the first Deere plows was steel.     The moldboard was smoothly ground wrought iron._ 

_Deere's invention succeeded because, as the durable steel     share of the plow cut through the 

heavy earth, the sticky soil     could find no place to cling on its polished surfaces._  Americans 

moving westward in the beginning of the 19th century soon encountered the prairie lands of what 

we now call the Middle West. The dark fertile soils promised by an enormous crocodile. The latter 

had nearly reached its prey, when the dog escaped by turning round suddenly and swimming 

against the current. The crocodile performed the same movement, but much more slowly than the 

dog, which succeeded in gaining the shore.  The crocodiles of the Apure find abundant food in the 

chiguires (thick-nosed tapirs),* which live fifty or sixty together in troops on the banks of the river. 

(* Cavia capybara, Linn. The word chiguire belongs to the language of the Palenkas and the 

Cumanagotos. The Spaniards call this animal guardatinaja; the Caribs, capigua; the Tamanacs, 

cappiva; and the Maypures, chiato. According to Azara, it is known at Buenos Ayres by the Indian 

names of capiygua and capiguara. These various denominations show a striking analogy between 

the languages of the Orinoco and those of the Rio de la Plata.) These animals, as large as our 

pigs, have no weapons of defence; they swim somewhat better than they run: yet they become the 

prey of the crocodiles in the water, and of the tigers on land. It is difficult to conceive, how, being 

thus persecuted by two powerful enemies, they become so numerous; but they breed with the 

same rapidity as the little cavies or guinea-pigs, which come to us from Brazil.  We stopped below 

the mouth of the Cano de la Tigrera, in a sinuosity called la Vuelta del Joval, to measure the 

velocity of the water at its surface. It was not more than 3.2 feet* in a second, which gives 2.56 

feet for the mean velocity. (* In order to measure the velocity of the surface of a river, I generally 

measured on the beach a base of 250 feet, and observed 


_
these regions, but also posed certain problems. First was the breaking of the tough prairie sod. 

The naturalist John Muir describes the conditions facing prairie farmers when he was a boy in the 

early 1850's as he tells of the use of the big prairie-breaking plows in the following words:[1] 

They were used only for the first ploughing, in breaking up     the wild sod woven into a tough 

mass, chiefly by the cord-like     roots of perennial grasses, reinforced by the tap roots of oak 

and hickory bushes, called "grubs," some of which were more     than a century old and four or five 

inches in diameter.... If     in good trim, the plough cut through and turned over these     grubs as if 

the century-old wood were soft like the flesh of     carrots and turnips; but if not in good trim the 

grubs     promptly tossed the plough out of the ground.  The second and greater problem was that 

the richer lands of the prairie bottoms, after a few years of continuous cultivation, became so 

sticky that they clogged the moldboards of the plows. Clogging was such a factor in prairie plowing 

that farmers in these regions carried a wooden paddle solely for cleaning off the moldboard, a task 

which had to be repeated so frequently that it seriously interfered with plowing efficiency. It seems 

probable that by the 1830's blacksmiths in the prairie country were beginning to solve the problem 

of continuous cultivation of sticky prairie soil by nailing strips of saw steel to the face of wooden 

moldboard of the traditional plows. Figure 1 is a photograph of an 18th century New England plow 

in the collection of the U. S. National Museum. This is one type of plow which was brought west by 

the settlers. It contributed to the development of the prairie breaker shown in figure 2. The first 

plow on record with strips of steel on the moldboard is attributed to John Lane in Chicago in 

1833.[2] Steel presented a smoother surface which shed the sticky loam better than the 

conventional wooden moldboards covered with wrought iron, or the cast iron moldboards of the 

newer factory-made plows then coming into use.  It is generally accepted as historical fact that 

John Deere made his first steel plow in 1837 at Grand Detour, Illinois. The details of the 

construction of this plow have been variously given by different writers. Ardrey[3] and Davidson[4] 

describe Deere's original plow as having a wooden moldboard covered with strips of steel cut from 

a saw, in the manner of the John Lane plow.  [Sidebar: THE AUTHOR:  _Edward C. Kendall is 

curator of agriculture, Museum of History and Technology, in the Smithsonian Institution's United 

States National Museum._]  In recent years the 1837 Deere plow has been pictured quite 

differently. This has apparently come about as the result of the discovery of an old plow identified 

as one made by John Deere at Grand Detour in 1838 and sold to Joseph Brierton from whose 

farm it was obtained in 1901 by the maker's son, Charles H. Deere. He brought it to the office of 

Deere & Company at Moline, Illinois, for preservation and display. This plow is shown in figures 7 

and 9. In 1938 Deere & Company presented it to the U. S. National Museum, where it is on 

display. It can be seen that the moldboard is made of one curved diamond-shaped metal slab. 

This plow bottom conforms to the description of the "diamond" plows manufactured by Deere in 

the 1840's.[5] The Company states that according to its records, this was one of three plows made 

by Deere in 1838 body, abandoned to the current, required to reach this distance.) The height of 

the barometer indicated barely a slope of seventeen inches in a mile of nine hundred and fifty 

toises. The velocity is the simultaneous effect of the slope of the ground, and the accumulation of 

the waters by the swelling of the upper parts of the river. We were again surrounded by chiguires, 

which swim like dogs, raising their heads and necks above the water. We saw with surprise a 

large crocodile on the opposite shore, motionless, and sleeping in the midst of these nibbling 



animals. It awoke at the approach of our canoe, and went into the water slowly, without frightening 

the chiguires. Our Indians accounted for this indifference by the stupidity of the animals, but it is 

more probable that the chiguires know by long experience, that the crocodile of the Apure and the 

Orinoco does not attack upon land, unless he finds the object he would seize immediately in his 

way, at the instant when he throws himself into the water.  Near the Joval nature assumes an 

awful and extremely wild aspect. We there saw the largest jaguar we had ever met with. The 

natives themselves were astonished at its prodigious length, which surpassed that of any Bengal 

tiger I had ever seen in the museums of Europe. The animal lay stretched beneath the shade of a 

large zamang.* (* A species of mimosa.) It had just killed a chiguire, but had not yet touched its 

prey, on which it kept one of its paws. The zamuro vultures were assembled in great numbers to 

devour the remains of the jaguar's repast. They presented the most curious spectacle, by a 

singular mixture of boldness and timidity. They advanced within the distance of two feet from the 

animal, but at the least movement he made they drew back. In order to observe more nearly the 

manners of these creatures, we went into the little skiff that accompanied our canoe. Tigers very 

rarely attack boats by swimming to them; and never but when their ferocity is heightened by a long 

privation of food. The noise of our oars led the animal to rise slowly, and hide itself behind the 

sauso bushes that bordered the shore. The vultures tried to profit by this moment of absence to 

devour the chiguire; but the tiger, notwithstanding the proximity of our boat, leaped into the midst 

of them, and in a fit of rage, expressed by his gait and the movement of his tail, carried off his prey 

to the forest. The Indians regretted that they were not provided with their lances, in order to go on 

shore and attack the tiger. They are accustomed to this weapon, and were right in not trusting to 

our fire-arms. In so excessively damp an atmosphere muskets often miss fire.  Continuing to 

descend the river, we met with the great herd of chiguires which the tiger had put to flight, and 

from which he had selected his prey. These animals saw us land very unconcernedly; some of 

them were seated, and gazed upon us, moving the upper lip like rabbits. They seemed not to be 

afraid of man, but the sight of our dog put them to flight. Their hind legs being longer than their 

fore legs, their pace is a slight gallop, but with so little swiftness that we succeeded in catching two 

of them. The chiguire, which swims with the greatest agility, utters a short moan in running, as if its 

respiration were impeded. It is the largest of the family of rodentia or gnawing animals. It defends 

itself only at the last extremity, when it is surrounded and wounded. Having great strength in its 

grinding 


_
was probably substantially identical with the first one made in 1837.[6] It may be difficult to prove 

that the Museum's specimen was made in 1838, but a comparison of this plow (fig. 7) with the 

1847 moldboard (fig. 5) and the 1855 plow (fig. 6) suggests that the Museum's plow is the earliest 

of the three, since there is particularly evident an evolution of the shape of the moldboard from a 

simple, almost crude form to a more sophisticated shape.  [Illustration: Figure 1.--NEW ENGLAND

AND ANDRUS  Writers of the 20th century describing the making of the first John Deere steel 

plow have in mind the 1838 plow. One[7] has John Deere pondering the local plowing problem 

and getting an idea from the polished surface of a tear the paw of a tiger, or the leg of a horse, 

with its bite. (* We counted eighteen on each side. On the hind feet, at the upper end of the 

metatarsus, there is a callosity three inches long and three quarters of an inch broad, destitute of 

hair. The animal, when seated, rests upon this part. No tail is visible externally; but on putting 

aside the hair we discover a tubercle, a mass of naked and wrinkled flesh, of a conical figure, and 

half an inch long.) Its flesh has a musky smell somewhat disagreeable; yet hams are made of it in 

this country, a circumstance which almost justifies the name of water-hog, given to the chiguire by 

some of the older naturalists. The missionary monks do not hesitate to eat these hams during 

Lent. According to their zoological classification they place the armadillo, the thick-nosed tapir, and 

the manatee, near the tortoises; the first, because it is 


_
Leonard Andrus, the founder and leading figure of Grand Detour and part owner of the sawmill, 

conceived the design of the plow and employed Deere, the blacksmith newly arrived from 

Vermont, to build it. This idea may have originated with and was certainly promoted by the late 

Fred A. Wirt, as advertising manager of the J. I. Case Company. It is difficult, at this distance, to 

determine the parts played at the beginning by Deere and Andrus.  [Illustration: Figure 2.--LARGE 

PRAIRIE-BREAKING PLOW, MID-19TH CENTURY. Wheels underneath the beam regulate the 

depth of plowing; large wheel runs in the furrow, small wheel on the land. The colter is braced at 

the bottom as well as at the top. The share cuts a broad, shallow strip of sod which the long, 

gently curving moldboard turns over unbroken.]  The earliest existing partnership agreement 

involving Andrus and Deere is dated March 20, 1843.[9] The existing copy is unsigned, but its 

conditions are the same as those in the agreements executed during the next few years. It began 

by stating that Deere and Andrus had agreed "to become copartners together in the art and trade 

of Blacksmithing, ploughmaking and all things thereto belonging at the said Grand Detour, and all 

other business that the said parties may hereafter deem necessary for their mutual interest and 

benefit ..." One of the terms was that the copartnership should continue from the date of the 

agreement "under the name and firm of Leonard Andrus."  A second agreement dated October 26, 

1844,[10] which brought in a third partner, Horace Paine, described the business as "the art and 

trade of Blacksmithing Plough Making Iron Castings and all things thereto belonging ..." and stated 

that the copartnership should be conducted "under the name and firm of L. Andrus and Co." The 

third agreement, dated October 20, 1846, in which another man appeared in place of Paine, gave 

the name of the firm as Andrus, Deere, and Lathrop.[11] This carried an addendum dated June 22, 

1847, in which Andrus and Deere bought out Lathrop's interest in the business and agreed to 

continue under the name of Andrus and Deere. This is the only mention of the firm of Andrus and 

Deere. It could only have lasted a few months because it was in others because they are 

amphibious. The chiguires are found in such numbers on the banks of the rivers Santo Domingo, 

Apure, and Arauca, in the marshes and in the inundated savannahs* of the Llanos, that the 

pasturages suffer from them. (* Near Uritucu, in the Cano del Ravanal, we saw a flock of eighty or 

one hundred of these animals.) They browze the grass which fattens the horses best, and which 

bears the name of chiguirero, or chiguire-grass. They feed also upon fish; and we saw with 

surprise, that, when scared by the approach of a boat, the animal in diving remains eight or ten 

minutes under water.  We passed the night as usual, in the open air, though in a plantation, the 

proprietor of which employed himself in hunting tigers. He wore scarcely any clothing, and was of 

a dark brown complexion like a Zambo. This did not prevent his classing himself amongst the 

Whites. He called his wife and his daughter, who were as naked as himself, Dona Isabella and 

Dona Manuela. Without having ever quitted the banks of the Apure, he took a lively interest in the 

news of Madrid--enquiring eagerly respecting those never-ending wars, and everything down 

yonder (todas las cosas de alla). He knew, he said, that the king was soon to come and visit the 

grandees of the country of Caracas, but he added with some pleasantry, as the people of the court 

can eat only wheaten bread, they will never pass beyond the town of Victoria, and we shall not see 

them here. I had brought with me a chiguire, which I had intended to have roasted; but our host 

assured us, that such Indian game was not food fit for nos otros caballeros blancos, (white 

gentlemen like ourselves and him). Accordingly he offered us some venison, which he had killed 



the day before with an arrow, for he had neither powder nor fire-arms.  We supposed that a small 

wood of plantain-trees concealed from us the hut of the farm; but this man, so proud of his nobility 

and the colour of his skin, had not taken the trouble of constructing even an ajoupa, or hut of palm-

leaves. He invited us to have our hammocks hung near his own, between two trees; and he 

assured us, with an air of complacency, that, if we came up the river in the rainy season, we 

should find him beneath a roof 


_
there.  [Illustration: Figure 3.--RECONSTRUCTIONS OF JOHN DEERE'S 1837 PLOW. For a 

discussion of the position and attachment of the handles see p. 24. (_Deere & Company photo_.)] 

These agreements suggest that Leonard Andrus was the capitalist of the young community of 

Grand Detour, as well as its founder. The dominance of the name Andrus tends to back up the 

opinion which holds that Andrus was the leading figure in the complain of a system of philosophy 

which is indulgent to indolence, and renders a man indifferent to the conveniences of life. A furious 

wind arose after midnight, lightnings flashed over the horizon, thunder rolled, and we were wet to 

the skin. During this storm a whimsical incident served to amuse us for a moment. Dona Isabella's 

cat had perched upon the tamarind-tree, at the foot of which we lay. It fell into the hammock of one
