assistance of a spirit of whatever nature it may be? Or is it for having be=
lieved in transmigration=20

(reincarnation)? It is still believed in (by millions) in our day. No one h=
as any idea of the number of=20

the men of Science who long for the re- establishment of the Druidical Reli=
gion and of the=20

Mysteries of Pythagoras. Or is it for having exorcised the demons and the p=
lague? The Egyptians,=20

the Etruscans and all the Roman Pontiffs had done so long before.(244) For =
having conversed=20

with the dead? We do the same to-day, or believe we do so--which is all the=
 same. For having=20

believed in the Empuses? Where is the Demonologist that does not know that =
the Empuse is the=20

"south demon" referred to in David's _Psalms_, and dreaded then as it is fe=
ared even now in all=20

Northern Europe?(245) For having made himself invisible at will? It is one =
of the achievements of=20

mesmerism. For having appeared after his (supposed) death to the Emperor Au=
relian above the=20

city walls of Tyana, and for having compelled him thereby to raise the sieg=
e of that town? Such=20

was the mission of every hero beyond the tomb, and the reason of the worshi=
p vowed to the=20

Manes.(246) For having descended into the famous den of Trophonius, and tak=
en from it an old=20

book preserved for years after by the Emperor Adrian in his Antium library?=
 The trustworthy and=20

sober Pausanias had descended into the same den before Apollonius, and came=
 back no less a=20

believer. For having disappeared at his death? Yes, like Romulus, like Vota=
n, like Lycurgus, like=20

Pythagoras,(247) always under the most mysterious circumstances, ever atten=
ded by apparitions,=20

revelations, etc. Let us stop here and repeat once more: had the life of Ap=
ollonius been simple=20

_romance_, he would never have attained such a celebrity during his lifetim=
e or created such a=20

numerous sect, one so enthusiastic after his death.  And, to add to this, h=
ad all this been a=20

romance, never would a Caracalla have raised a herooen to his memory(248) o=
r Alexander,=20

Severus have placed his bust between those of two Demi-Gods and of the true=
 God,(249) or an=20

Empress have corresponded with him. Hardly rested from the hardships of the=
 siege at Jerusalem,=20

Titus would not have hastened to write to Apollonius a letter, asking to me=
et him at Argos and=20

adding that his father and himself (Titus) owed all to him, the great Apoll=
onius, and that, therefore,=20

his first thought was for their benefactor. Nor would the Emperor Aurelian =
have built a temple and=20

a shrine to that great Sage, to thank him for his apparition and communicat=
ion at Tyana. That=20

_posthumous_ conversation, as all knew, saved the city, inasmuch as Aurelia=
n had in=20

consequence raised the siege. Furthermore, had it been a romance, History w=
ould not have had=20

Vopiscus,(250) one of the most trustworthy Pagan Historians, to certify to =
it. Finally, Apollonius=20

would not have been the object of the admiration of such a noble character =
as Epictetus, and even=20

of several of the Fathers of the Church; Jerome for instance, in his better=
 moments, writing thus of=20

To end the subject, had Apollonius been a simple hero of a romance, dramati=
