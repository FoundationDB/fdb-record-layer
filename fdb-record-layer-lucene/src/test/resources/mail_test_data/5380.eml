 Section  2.=20

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm=
 is synonymous with=20

the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest=
 variety of computers=20

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because =
of the efforts of=20

hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Vol=
unteers and financial=20

support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, never to be un=
dervalued; and he felt=20

sure that many men who had been kept under, in a state of neutrality, at le=
ast, by Torrance's=20

rough and brutal partisanship--would now be free to take the popular side, =
as they had always=20

wished to do. The influence of Tinto, which he thus appropriated, more than=
 doubled his own in a=20

moment. There could not have been a more perfect godsend to him than Torran=
ce's death.  But=20

the more he perceived and felt the importance of this, the more did the pre=
sence of Beaufort=20

disturb and alarm him. It became daily a more urgent subject in the family.=
 When Lord Lindores=20



got vague information that Carry had met somewhere her old lover on the roa=
dside--which=20

somebody, of course, saw and reported, though it did not reach his ears til=
l long after--his dim=20

apprehensions blazed into active alarm. He went to his wife in mingled ange=
r and terror. To him,=20

as to so many husbands, it always appeared that adverse circumstances were =
more or less his=20

wife's fault. He told her what he had heard in a tempest of indignation. "Y=
ou must tell her it won't=20

do. You must let her know that it's indecent, that it's shameful. Good heav=
ens, just think what you=20

are doing!--letting your daughter, your own daughter, disgrace herself in t=
he sight of the whole=20

county. Talk about the perceptions of women! They have no perceptions--they=
 have no moral=20

sense, I believe. Tell Carry I will not have it. If you don't, I must inter=
fere." Lady Lindores received=20

this fulmination with comparative silence. She scarcely said anything in he=
r own defence. She was=20

afraid to speak lest she should betray that she had known more than her hus=
band knew, and was=20

still more deeply alarmed than he was. She said, "You are very unjust," but=
 she said no more. That=20

evening she wrote an anxious note to John Erskine; the next day she drove t=
o Tinto with more=20

anxiety than hope. Already a great change had come over that ostentatious p=
lace. The great=20

rooms were shut up; the less magnificent ones had already begun to undergo =
a transformation.=20

The large meaningless ornaments were being carried away. An air of home and=
 familiar habitation=20

had come about the house. Carry, in her widow's cap, had begun to move ligh=
tly up and down with=20

a step quite unlike the languor of her convalescence. She was not convalesc=
ent any longer, but=20

had begun to bloom with a soft colour and subdued air of happiness out of t=
he cloud that had=20

enveloped her so long. To see her so young (for her youth seemed to have co=
me back), so fresh=20

and almost gay, gave a wonderful pang of mingled pain and delight to her mo=
ther's heart: it=20

showed what a hideous cloud that had been in which her life had been swallo=
wed up, and to=20

check her in her late and dearly bought renewal of existence was hard, and =
took away all Lady=20

Lindores's courage. But she addressed herself to her task with all the stre=
ngth she could muster.=20

"My darling, I am come to--talk to you," she said.  "I hope so, mother dear=
; don't you always talk to=20

me? and no one so sweetly," Carry said, with her lips upon her mother's che=
ek, in that soft=20

forestalling of all rebuke which girls know the secret of. Perhaps she susp=
ected something of what=20

was coming, and would have stopped it if she could.  "Ah, Carry! but it is=
