SOME REASONS FOR SECRESY.   The fact that the Occult Sciences have been wit=
hheld from=20

the world at large, and denied by the Initiates to Humanity, has often been=
 made matter of=20

complaint. It has been alleged that the Guardians of the Secret Lore were s=
elfish in withholding the=20

"treasures" of Archaic Wisdom; that it was positively criminal to keep back=
 such knowledge--"if=20

any"--from the men of Science, etc.  Yet there must have been some very goo=
d reasons for it,=20

since from the very dawn of History such has been the policy of every Hiero=
phant and "Master."=20

Pythagoras, the first Adept and real Scientist in pre-Christian Europe, is =
accused of having taught=20

in public the immobility of the earth, and the rotatory motion of the stars=
 around it, while he was=20

declaring to his privileged Adepts his belief in the motion of the Earth as=
 a planet, and in the=20

heliocentric system. The reasons for such secresy, however, are many and we=
re never made a=20

mystery of. The chief cause was given in _Isis Unveiled_. It may now be rep=
eated.       From the=20

very day when the first mystic, taught by the first     Instructor of the "=
divine Dynasties" of the early=20

races, was     taught the means of communication between this world and the=
     worlds of the=20

invisible host, between the sphere of matter and     that of pure spirit, h=
e concluded that to=20

abandon this mysterious     in the tympanum, retina, nose, epiglottis, lary=
nx, trachea, thymus,=20

pericardium, in the parietal pleura, along the intercostal vessels, rarely =
the peritoneum, in the=20

stomach, and sometimes the intestines; and in other parts of the body, espe=
cially the face, base of=20

neck, and front of chest; in convulsive affections, as eclampsia and epilep=
sy, and in the=20

convulsions of strychnia and prussic acid poisoning there may be suffusion =
and congestion of the=20

lungs though not the punctated spots.  Mackenzie, in thirteen cases of suff=
ocation from various=20

causes, failed to find the Tardieu spots either externally or internally. B=
riand and Chaud=C3=A9[918]=20

state that they are less constant and characteristic in those who have been=
 buried in pulverulent=20

substances.  Ogston[919] holds that in infants that are smothered the ecchy=
moses are found in=20

greater number in the thymus gland; while in adults dying from other forms =
of asphyxia they were=20

found only once in that gland. The spots are found in clusters in infants t=
hat are smothered, but=20

only single and scattered in adults who die from drowning, hanging or disea=
se. They were wanting=20

in the lungs of but one infant.  They may be recognized as long as the lung=
 tissue is unchanged.=20

The apoplectic spots in the lungs seen in strangulation are not found in su=
ffocation.   Tardieu[920]=20

from experiments on animals and examination of  twenty-three new-born infan=
ts who showed=20

traces of violence around the  mouth, found the=20


_
rabble--was to lose it. An abuse of it might lead mankind to speedy     des=
truction; it was like=20

surrounding a group of children with     explosive substances, and furnishi=
ng them with matches.=20

The first     divine Instructor initiated but a select few, and these kept =
    silence with the multitudes.=20

They recognised _their_ "God" and     each Adept felt the great "SELF" with=
in himself. The Atman,=20

the     Self, the mighty Lord and Protector, once that man knew him as the =
    "I am," the "Ego=20

Sum," the "Asmi," showed his full power to him     who could recognise the =
"still small voice." From=20

the days of the     primitive man described by the first Vedic poet, down t=
o our     modern age,=20

there has not been a philosopher worthy of that name,     who did not carry=
 in the silent sanctuary=20

of his heart the grand     and mysterious truth. If initiated, he learnt it=
 as a sacred     science; if=20

otherwise, then, like Socrates, repeating to himself     as well as his fel=
low-men, the noble=20

injunction, "O man, know     thyself," he succeeded in recognising his God =
within himself. "Ye=20

are Gods," the king-psalmist tells us, and we find Jesus reminding     the =
scribes that this=20

expression was addressed to other mortal     men, claiming for themselves t=
he same privilege=20

without any     blasphemy. And as a faithful echo, Paul, while asserting th=
at we     are all "the=20

temple of the living God," cautiously remarked     elsewhere that after all=
 these things are only for=20

the "wise," and     it is "unlawful" to speak of them.(97)   Some of the re=
asons for this secresy may=20

here be given.  The fundamental law and master-key of practical Theurgy, in=
 its chief applications=20

to the serious study of  well marked. All the deaths were rapid. In cases o=
f compression of  chest=20

and abdomen[921] the congestion of the lungs was extensive,  and pulmonary =
apoplexy frequent;=20

more so than in other forms of  suffocation. He gave strychnia to animals w=
hich died in=20

convulsions,  and found very irregular and partial congestions, generally n=
ot  marked because=20

death was so prompt; blood always fluid; no subpleural  ecchymoses.  The LI=
VER, SPLEEN, and=20

KIDNEYS are generally congested; the kidney more than the other organs name=
d. The spleen is=20

said to be often an=C3=A6mic. Semen has sometimes been found, unexpelled, i=
n the urethra.=20

Page[922] experimented on three kittens, suffocating them in cinders.  The =
post-mortem=20

examinations showed the veins engorged, left side  of heart empty, right si=
de full of dark, half-

clotted blood. Lungs  distended, much congested, color violet; many small f=
luid hemorrhages  in=20

substance; no subpleural ecchymoses. Frothy mucus tinged with blood  in tra=
chea and bronchi;=20

bronchi congested. Brain and abdominal organs  normal.   PROOF OF DEATH BY=
=20

SUFFOCATION.  It is sometimes difficult in a given case to state WHETHER DE=
ATH IS DUE TO=20

SUFFOCATION. There is no lesion which of itself could be accepted as proof.=
 But a collation of=20

the lesions found taken in connection with the surroundings of the body wil=
l in many if not in most=20

cases lead to a definite conclusion.  Infants have been found alive four an=
d five hours after having=20

been buried in the earth.[923] If the pulverulent material has penetrated i=
nto the =C5=93sophagus and=20

stomach, the burial has occurred during life. Exceptionally when burial has=
 occurred after death=20

and traces of the material are found in the air-passages,=20


_
spiritual, mysteries was, and still is, that which was called by the Greek =
Neoplatonists=20

"Theophania." In its generally-accepted meaning this is "communication betw=
een the Gods (or=20

God) and those initiated mortals who are spiritually fit to enjoy such an i=
ntercourse." Esoterically,=20

however, it signifies more than this. For it is not only the presence of a =
God, but an actual--howbeit=20

temporary--incarnation, the blending, so to say, of the personal Deity, the=
 Higher Self, with man--

its representative or agent on earth. As a general law, the Highest God, th=
e Over-soul of the=20

human being (Atma-Buddhi), only overshadows the individual during his life,=
 for =C5=93sophagus or=20

stomach.   The committee on =E2=80=9CSuffocation,=E2=80=9D of the New York =
Med. Leg. Soc.,  reported[924] the=20

following group of appearances as evidences of  death by suffocation: The g=
eneral venous=20

character of the blood, the  turgidity of the larger veins, the congestion =
of the parenchymatous=20

organs, especially at the base of the brain, the lungs congested in  a vari=
able degree and=20

=C5=93dematous, frothy mucus in the bronchi, the  right side of the heart a=
lways fuller than the left.=20

Fitz[925] holds  that suffocation is a condition composed of a group of sym=
ptoms and=20

appearances due most probably to accumulation of carbon dioxide in  the blo=
od and a=20
