BRAHE, at Vilna. Besides, there is something in his face which I cannot des=
cribe, but which=20

haunts and troubles while it touches me. It seems to remind me of some othe=
r face known long=20

ago. We must go and see him again to-morrow, and bring him some little toke=
n of our gratitude.=20

What do you think he would like, Cl=C3=A9mence?=E2=80=9D  But they did _not=
_ see Ivan on the morrow; for=20

Madame de Talmont was too ill to rise from her bed, and Cl=C3=A9mence, even=
 if she had been willing=20

to leave her, could not go to the hospital alone. When, after an interval o=
f three or four days, they=20

made their appearance once more, the courteous Russian surgeon gave them qu=
ite a warm=20

welcome.  =E2=80=9CM. Pojarsky has been watching for you, mesdames,=E2=80=
=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYou will do him more=20

good than any of our medicines.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPojarsky!=E2=80=9D Madam=
e de Talmont repeated, as one in a dream--

=E2=80=9C_Pojarsky!_=E2=80=9D  Cl=C3=A9mence was amazed to find her mother=
=E2=80=99s ready and graceful courtesy fail her=20

completely for once. By way of supplying her unaccountable omission she ven=
tured upon an=20



inquiry for the invalid.  =E2=80=9CHe has been very feverish, and has suffe=
red a good deal since,=E2=80=9D the=20

surgeon admitted. =E2=80=9CBut he is much better to-day. Will you come to h=
im at once, mesdames?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWillingly, monsieur, if you will be kind enough to distribute thes=
e oranges amongst those who=20

need them most,=E2=80=9D said Cl=C3=A9mence, placing a large bag in the han=
ds of the surgeon; for her=20

mother=E2=80=99s continued silence forced her to take the initiative. =E2=
=80=9CMother,=E2=80=9D she whispered, as they=20

passed into the ward where Ivan lay--=E2=80=9Cdear mother, what ails you?=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat name awakens old=20

associations--not happy ones,=E2=80=9D Madame de Talmont answered.  Ivan re=
ceived his friends with a=20

bright, glad smile of welcome. Since their last visit he had beguiled his h=
ours of loneliness and=20

pain by endeavouring to recall every word, every look of Henri=E2=80=99s, a=
s a drop to be added to the cup=20

of comfort he was bearing to the lips of Henri=E2=80=99s mother and sister.=
 Very pleasant had the=20

recognition been to him. Well could he imagine how the solitary invalid far=
 away in the hospital at=20

Vilna must have longed for those sweet faces, for the gentle touch of those=
 kind hands. What=20

would _he_ give for such a mother, such a sister, to tend and care for him!=
 But then his thoughts=20

would revert once more, with a thrill of thankful joy, to the triumph of th=
e Czar. How could he wish=20

for anything else in the world when Alexander was in Paris, and the flames =
of Moscow were=20

avenged?  At first Madame de Talmont seemed embarrassed, and a faint pink f=
lush lent unwonted=20

colour to her pale cheek. But Ivan=E2=80=99s detailed description of his in=
terview with Henri at Vilna=20

arrested and held her with its absorbing interest.  =E2=80=9CM. de Pojarsky=
,=E2=80=9D she said, uttering the name=20

with a little hesitation, perhaps even reluctance, =E2=80=9Cif _you_ have a=
 mother living, I pray God to=20
