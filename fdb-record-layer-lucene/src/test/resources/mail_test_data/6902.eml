recognize the same stamp on all the arts, and an intercourse between all studies, and so they 

more readily comprehend them all. This is what led one of the ancient architects, Pytheos, the 

celebrated builder of the temple of Minerva at Priene, to say in his Commentaries that an architect 

ought to be able to accomplish much more in all the arts and sciences than the men who, by their 

own particular kinds of work and the practice of it, have brought each a single subject to the 

highest perfection. But this is in point of fact not realized.  13. For an architect ought not to be and 

cannot be such a philologian as was Aristarchus, although not illiterate; nor a musician like 

Aristoxenus, though not absolutely ignorant of music; nor a painter like Apelles, though not 

unskilful in drawing; nor a sculptor such as was Myron or Polyclitus, though not unacquainted with 

the plastic art; nor again a physician like Hippocrates, though not ignorant of medicine; nor in the 

other sciences need he excel in each, though he should not be unskilful in them. For, in the midst 

of all this great variety of subjects, an individual cannot attain to perfection in each, because it is 

scarcely in his power to take in and comprehend the general theories of them.  14. Still, it is not 

architects alone that cannot in all matters reach perfection, but even men who individually practise 

specialties in the arts do not all attain to the highest point of merit. Therefore, if among artists 

working each in a single field not all, but only a few in an entire generation acquire fame, and that 

with difficulty, how can an architect, who has to be skilful in many arts, accomplish not merely the 

feat--in itself a great marvel--of being deficient in none of them, but also that of surpassing all 

those artists who have devoted themselves with unremitting industry to single fields?  15. It 

appears, then, that Pytheos made a mistake by not observing that the arts are each composed of 

two things, the actual work and the theory of it. One of these, the doing of the work, is proper to 

men trained in the individual subject, while the other, the theory, is common to all scholars: for 

example, to physicians and musicians the rhythmical beat of the pulse and its metrical movement. 

But if there is a wound to be healed or a sick man to be saved from danger, the musician will not 

call, for the business will be appropriate to the physician. So in the case of a musical instrument, 

not the physician but the musician will be the man to tune it so that the ears may find their due 

pleasure in its strains.  16. Astronomers likewise have a common ground for discussion with 

musicians in the harmony of the stars and musical concords in tetrads and triads of the fourth and 

the fifth, and with geometricians in the subject of vision (in Greek [Greek: logos optikos]); and in all 

other sciences many points, perhaps all, are common so far as the discussion of them is 

concerned. But the actual undertaking of works which are brought to perfection by the hand and its 

manipulation is the function of those who have been specially trained to deal with a single art. It 

appears, therefore, that he has done enough and to spare who in each subject possesses a fairly 

good knowledge of those parts, with their principles, which are indispensable for architecture, so 

that if he is required to pass judgement and to express approval in the case of those things or arts, 

he may not be found wanting. As for men upon whom nature has bestowed so much ingenuity, 

acuteness, and memory that they are able to have a thorough knowledge of geometry, astronomy, 

music, and the other arts, they go beyond the functions of architects and become pure 

mathematicians. Hence they can readily take up positions against those arts because many are 

the artistic weapons with which they are armed. Such men, however, are rarely found, but there 

have been such at times; for example, Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum, 

Apollonius of Perga, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, and among Syracusans Archimedes and Scopinas, 



who through mathematics and natural philosophy discovered, expounded, and left to posterity 

many things in connexion with mechanics and with sundials.  17. Since, therefore, the possession 

of such talents due to natural capacity is not vouchsafed at random to entire nations, but only to a 

few great men; since, moreover, the function of the architect requires a training in all the 

departments of learning; and finally, since reason, on account of the wide extent of the subject, 

concedes that he may possess not the highest but not even necessarily a moderate knowledge of 

the subjects of study, I request, Caesar, both of you and of those who may read the said books, 

that if anything is set forth with too little regard for grammatical rule, it may be pardoned. For it is 

not as a very great philosopher, nor as an eloquent rhetorician, nor as a grammarian trained in the 

highest principles of his art, that I have striven to write this work, but as an architect who has had 

only a dip into those studies. Still, as regards the efficacy of the art and the theories of it, I promise 

and expect that in these volumes I shall undoubtedly show myself of very considerable importance 

not only to builders but also to all scholars.     CHAPTER II  THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 

OF ARCHITECTURE   1. Architecture depends on Order (in Greek [Greek: taxis]), Arrangement 

(in Greek [Greek: diathesis]), Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and Economy (in Greek [Greek: 

oikonomia]).  2. Order gives due measure to the members of a work considered separately, and 

symmetrical agreement to the proportions of the whole. It is an adjustment according to quantity 

(in Greek [Greek: posotes]). By this I mean the selection of modules from the members of the work 

itself and, starting from these individual parts of members, constructing the whole work to 

correspond. Arrangement includes the putting of things in their proper places and the elegance of 

effect which is due to adjustments appropriate to the character of the work. Its forms of expression 

(Greek [Greek: ideai]) are these: groundplan, elevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by 

the proper successive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for the plane 

surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front of a building, set upright and properly 

drawn in the proportions of the contemplated work. Perspective is the method of sketching a front 

with the sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the centre of a circle. All 

three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion is careful and laborious thought, and watchful 

attention directed to the agreeable effect of one's plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the solving 

of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by means of brilliancy and versatility. 

These are the departments belonging under Arrangement.  3. Eurythmy is beauty and fitness in 

the adjustments of the members. This is found when the members of a work are of a height suited 

to their breadth, of a breadth suited to their length, and, in a word, when they all correspond 

symmetrically.  4. Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and 

relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain 

part selected as standard. Thus in the human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony 

between forearm, foot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is without slackening his pace, 

and said, "Now, Jim, you an' I shall go and pay _another_ wisit."  They traversed several small 

streets, which seemed to be influenced by a tendency to gravitate towards the Thames; while the 

river, as if in sympathy, appeared to meet them more than half way in the shape of mud. As they 

proceeded, huge warehouses frowned above, having doors high up on their blank faces where 

windows ought to have been, with no steps leading thereto, but in some cases with huge block 

tackles pendent therefrom, suggestive of the idea that the owners were wont to drop the enormous 



hooks and fish for passers-by.  These streets naturally became more nautical in some respects as 

they neared the river.  Old bits of timber lay here and there among old cordage in little yards, 

where the owners appeared to deal in small-coal and miscellaneous filth. Elsewhere, worn-out 

anchors held tenaciously to the mud, as if afraid of being again pressed into service and carried off 

to sea.  Everything was cold, dismal, dreary, disreputable; and here, in the dirtiest corner of the 

smallest possible yard, the Bloater found a half-concealed door that might have been the portal to 

a dog-kennel or pig-sty.  Opening it he entered, and Little Jim followed.  The aspect of things 

inside was not attractive.  Dirt, damp, and rubbish prevailed in the room, which was just big 

enough to permit of a tall man lying down, but not high enough to admit of his standing up.  An 

uncommonly small four-post bed almost filled the apartment, at the foot of which, on the floor and 

half-reclining against one of the posts, lay Phil Sparks, either dead-drunk or asleep, or both.  The 

Bloater glanced back at Little Jim with a look of satisfaction, and held up his finger to enjoin 

silence.  Peering round the room, which was lighted by a farthing candle stuck in the neck of a pint 

bottle, he observed a piece of rope lying among some rubbish.  "Ha! this'll do," he whispered, as 

he took it up, and, with wonderful rapidity, made a loop on it.  "Now, Jim, you be ready to cut and 

run if he should waken before I 'ave 'im fast.  Don't mind me; I'll look arter myself.  An' wotever you 

do, _don't holler for the bobbies_.  Mind that, else I'll strangle you."  With this advice and caution, 

the Bloater advanced toward the recumbent man, and passed the rope softly round his body, 

including his arms and the bedpost in the coil.  Drawing it suddenly tight, he hastily made it fast; 

but there was no occasion for haste, for the sleep of the man was so profound that the action did 

not awake him.  "Hall right--fus' rate," said the Bloater aloud, as he wound the rope round and 

round Sparks, so as to make him doubly secure.  "Nothin' could be better.  Now, Jim, I'm goin' for 

to preach a sermon to-night--a sort o' discoorse.  You never heard me preach, did you?"  Little 

Jim, who, despite his love of mischief, was somewhat alarmed at the strange proceedings of his 

friend and patron, looked at him with a mingled expression of fear and glee, and shook his head. 

"Well, you shall 'ear.  Moreover, I 'ope that you'll profit by wot you 'ears."  Saying this, he advanced 

his hand towards the sleeping man's face, and, causing his thumb to act as a trigger to his middle 

finger, gave him such a flip on the point of his nose, that he awoke with a tremendous roar. 

Suddenly he became pale as death--supposing, no doubt, that he had betrayed himself--and 

glanced towards the door with a bewildered stare.  "Oh, you needn't alarm yourself," said the 

Bloater, placing a stool in front of his victim, and sitting down thereon, with a hand on each knee, 

"it ain't the bobbies.  If you keep quiet, there's no fear of _them_ in this neighbourhood.  I can call 

'em w'en I wants 'em.  There's nobody but me and Little Jim 'ere--your friends, you know." 

Becoming suddenly convinced of the truth of this, Phil Sparks, who was very drunk, made so 

desperate an effort to free himself that he nearly overturned the bed.  "Oh, you are anxious to see 

the bobbies, are you?  Well, go an' call 'em in, Jim."  Jim rose to obey, and the man became 

instantly quiet.  "Ho! you're reasonable now, are you?  That's well.  You needn't call 'em in yet, 

Jim.  We'll grant 'im a reprieve.  Fetch that stool, an' sit down beside me--there.  Now, Mr Sparks, 

_alias_ Blazes, no doubt _you're_ a precious specimen of hinnocent 'unmanity, ain't you?"  Sparks 

made no reply, but scowled at the boy with a look of deadly hatred.  "Well, upon my word," 

resumed the Bloater, with a smile, "if I kep' a menagerie, I'd offer you five 'undred a year to 

represent a Tasmanian devil.  But look 'ere, now, I've no time to waste with you; I come 'ere to 



give you a bit of my mind.  You're a fire-raiser, you are.  Ah! you may well wince an' grow w'ite. 

You'd grow w'iter still, with a rope round your neck, if you wos left to _my_ tender mercies, you 

w'ite livered villain! for I knows you; I've watched you; I've found you hout; an' I've only got to 'old 

up my little finger to cut your pretty little career prematoorly short.  You don't seem to like that? 

No, I didn't expect you would.  This young man, whose 'art is big, if 'is body's small, knows as 

much about you as I do.  Two witnesses, you see; but you _ain't_ left to _our_ tender mercies; and 

if you wants to know who delivered you from us, and from the maginstrates, and Jack Ketch, 

_alias_ Calcraft, I replies, _Martha Reading_.  Ha! you look surprised. Quite nat'ral.  You've 

deserved very different treatment from that young ooman, an' didn't expect that she'd return good 

for evil, I s'pose. That's because you don't know 'er; you don't understand 'er, you miserable lump 

of selfish stoopidity.  'Ows'ever, as I said before, I ain't a-goin' to waste no more time with you.  But 

let me, before biddin' you adoo, give you a caution.  Remember, that _I've got my eye on you_. 

Just one word more.  W'en you thinks of _me_, don't think of one as 'as got any tender mercies, 

for I ain't got none; not a scrap of 'em, nor nothin' of the sort.  W'en you wants to know the true 

cause of your bein' let off, just think of two words--_Martha Reading_!  She knows nothin' o' wot 

I'm doin', nevertheless, _she's_ done it!  Let 'er name ring in your ears, an' thunder in your brain, 

and burn in your 'art, till it consooms your witals or your willany!  Now, Jim," concluded the Bloater, 

rising and opening a large clasp-knife, "you go to the door, open it wide, an' stan' by to cut, and 

run.  This gen'lm'n ain't to be trusted w'en free.  Are you ready?"  "Hall ready," replied Jim.  The 

Bloater cut the cord that bound Phil Sparks, and darted from the room.  Before the man could 

disentangle himself from its coils, the boys were safe from pursuit, quietly wending their way 

through the crowded thoroughfares of the great city.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  Several months passed 

away.  During this period Phil Sparks kept in close hiding, because, although the Bloater, true to 

his promise, refrained from giving information against him, there were others who knew and 

suspected him, and who had no visions of an imploring Martha to restrain them in their efforts to 

deliver him into the hands of justice.  During this period, also, Ned Crashington recovered his 

wonted health and vigour, while his wife, to some extent, recovered her senses, and, instead of 

acting as an irritant blister on her husband, began really to aim at unanimity.  The result was, that 

Ned's love for her, which had only been smothered a little, burst forth with renewed energy, and 


_
buildings. In the case of temples, symmetry may be calculated from the thickness of a column, 

from a triglyph, or even from a module; in the ballista, from the hole or from what the Greeks call 

the [Greek: peritretos]; in a ship, from the space between the tholepins [Greek: (diapegma)]; and in 

other things, from various members.  5. Propriety is that perfection of style which comes when a 

work is authoritatively constructed on approved principles. It arises from prescription [Greek: 

(thematismo)], from usage, or from nature. From prescription, in the case of hypaethral edifices, 

open to the sky, in honour of Jupiter Lightning, the Heaven, the Sun, or the Moon: for these are 

gods whose semblances and manifestations we behold before our very eyes in the sky when it is 

cloudless and supposed that Maggie was cured all at once.  She was not an angel--only an 

energetic and self-willed woman.  She therefore broke out now and then in her old style; but, on 

the whole, she was much improved, and the stalwart fireman no longer sought martyrdom in the 

flames.  During this period, too, the men of the Red Brigade held on the even tenor of their furious 

fiery way; not, indeed, scatheless, but with a much smaller amount of damage to life and limb than 

might have been expected in a service where the numerical strength was so low--only about 380 

men--and where the duty, night and day, was so severe and hazardous.  About this time, their 

Chief's "Report" for the past year was issued, and it revealed a few facts which are worthy of 

record.  It stated that there had been 


_
Minerva, Mars, and Hercules, will be Doric, since the virile strength of these gods makes 

daintiness entirely inappropriate to their houses. In temples to Venus, Flora, Proserpine, Spring-

Water, and the Nymphs, the Corinthian order will be found to have peculiar significance, because 

these are delicate divinities and so its rather slender outlines, its flowers, leaves, and ornamental 

volutes will lend propriety where it is due. The construction of temples of the Ionic order to Juno, 

Diana, Father Bacchus, and the other gods of that kind, will be in keeping with the middle position 

which they hold; for the building months; that is, an average of a little more than five fires every 

twenty-four hours.  Of these 1670 had been slight, while 276 were serious.  In these fires 186 

persons had been seriously endangered, of whom 153 were rescued by the men of the Red 

Brigade, while 33 perished, despite the most gallant efforts to save them.  The Report showed, 

further, that there were in London at that time, (and it is much the same still), 50 fire-engine 

stations, 25 land steam fire-engines, 85 manual fire-engines, 2 floating steam fire-engines on the 

Thames, and 104 fire-escapes.  The number of journeys made by the fire-engines 


_
appropriate combination of the severity of the Doric and the delicacy of the Corinthian.  6. 

Propriety arises from usage when buildings having magnificent interiors are provided with elegant 

entrance-courts to correspond; for there will be no propriety in the spectacle of an elegant interior 

approached by a low, mean entrance. Or, if dentils be carved in the cornice of the Doric 

entablature or triglyphs This, the reader will observe, implies an enormous amount of labour 

performed by the 380 heroes who constitute the Red Brigade, and who, although thus heavily 

overtaxed, were never heard to murmur or complain. That they suffered pretty frequently and 

severely might have been expected.  In truth, it is a marvel that they did not suffer more.  The 

Report showed that, among them all in the course of the year, they
