ins folle femme du monde, car, de femme sage il n'y en a point_ (she is the=
 least foolish woman in the world; there are no wise ones). The cynical old=
 king, Louis XI., sums up for us in this epigram his estimate of the daught=
er whom he loved and trusted more than any other _
will represent it; Walter Pater was expressing one phase of Victorian Engla=
nd when he wrote=20

_Marius the Epicurean_. But the artist hopes to appeal to more than the pre=
sent generation; even=20

the most contemporary of our contemporaries, who read no books of which the=
 authors are not=20

living, cherish some ambition to have their own works read after they thems=
elves are gone. And=20

since the fame of a book depends on its ability to meet the interest of rea=
ders over a long period of=20

time, the life of our works will depend on two things=E2=80=94on our gift f=
or selecting the matter which is=20

permanently interesting to men, and on the willingness or unwillingness of =
any generation to be=20

interested in the same things as its predecessors. If readers are now broug=
ht up to neglect as a=20

matter of course any works of literature that once were loved, there will b=
e no fame for any one=20

hereafter, and no masters of the art, but only in each publishing season a =
nine days=E2=80=99 wonder. But if=20

human nature still asserts its primal interests, in spite of mistaken teach=
ing, and continues to like=20

in the long run the same things that have been loved in the past, then the =
writer will finally be=20

reckoned great herself in acknowledgment of the betrothal, and a diamond se=
nt by her as a token.=20

Then Marie, to the utter dismay of the intriguers, quietly replied, of her =
own accord: "I wrote that=20

letter by the wish and command of my lord and father, and sent that diamond=
; I own to the=20

contents."  Marie and Maximilian were formally married on April 27th, and t=
he people, weary of the=20

state of uncertainty in which they had been kept, seemed content to make th=
e best of the=20

marriage. The prince was a German, did not speak their language or understa=
nd their customs;=20

but then he was prepossessing, and would doubtless make as good a defender =
of their liberties as=20

could be found. With the marriage, Marie practically ceased to appear as a =
direct participant in=20

political affairs. Her new husband was devoted to her, and for a time thing=
s looked more=20

encouraging for this last scion of a great race. True, Louis sent his barbe=
r-surgeon, Olivier, to=20

protest, in the name of the suzerain, against the marriage of his feudal wa=
rd without his consent.=20

But the Flemish nobles and their lady laughed at the barber, who really cam=
e more to spy than in=20

the hope that this mediaeval protest would avail aught.=20


_
not the mood of his hour, but the spirit of those constant demands. He will=
 get his inspiration from=20

life as he knows it; he will express it in an eternal form, as we say=E2=80=
=94at least in a form so durable=20

that instead of our understanding his work through the incident that inspir=
ed it, we shall know of=20

the incident through the work. Moli=C3=A8re has so immortalized one moment =
of his times in his=20

_Pr=C3=A9cieuses Ridicules_; without the play, would we know much of the te=
mporary affectation? And=20

to be quite frank, has not something died in the play, along with what was =
contemporary in it, so=20

that we enjoy it now with an historical effort not needed to be at home, le=
t us say, with Falstaff?=20

Tennyson really immortalized the Charge of the Light Brigade, for the incid=
ent on so many=20

grounds has since proved regrettable that we should be glad to forget it, b=
ut for the poem, and we=20

begin to be sorry that the poem is anchored to so much that was transitory.=
 Our own civil war poet,=20

Henry Howard Brownell, true genius if we ever had one, wrote his verses on =
the very scene, after=20

the fights he had passed through as Farragut=E2=80=99s secretary on the fla=
gship, and the virulence of=20

contemporary passion is in his work forever, an embarrassing alloy. But of =
the danger of being=20

contemporary, Dante is the great illustration. It is not hard to see what a=
n impact his great poem=20

must have made on his first hearers, it was so immediate in its reference t=
o persons, places,=20

incidents, crimes and disasters which Florence, Rome and Italy well knew; b=
ut what an effort it is=20

now to recover all those allusions to the times, indeed how impossible! We =
wrestle with them, if at=20

all, because the greatness of the poem bears up their leaden weight; and th=
e poem is great for=20

what is least contemporary in it, for the vision which Dante drew from his =
masters, and which he=20

handed on to the future in images of the French army under the traitor Lord=
 Crevecoeur, at=20

Guinegatte, August 7, 1479.  Meanwhile, a son had been born to the young co=
uple, and their=20

domestic happiness was unclouded. Fortune was not to smile on them long, ho=
wever, for the=20

Flemings were constitutionally rebellious, now refusing to grant Maximilian=
 supplies necessary for=20

defence, till he actually had to pawn his wife's jewels, now blaming all th=
eir misfortunes on this=20

foreigner, now distracting his attention from the still encroaching French =
king by riots and revolts.=20

In the unequal contest the French were destined to win; and ere Marie had b=
een married five=20

years an accident cost her her life and left Maximilian almost as helpless =
in the hands of the=20

Flemings as she had been. She had been hunting, a sport of which both she a=
nd Maximilian were=20

passionately fond, when her horse threw her. The injuries might not have pr=
oved fatal if medical=20

aid had been resorted to in time; but Marie, with pitiful false modesty, re=
fused to submit to the=20

examination of the surgeons, and died, after lingering three weeks, March 2=
6, 1482. Her infant=20

son, Philippe le Beau, remained as the nominal heir of Burgundy; but the gu=
arding of the duchy=20

was a hopeless task when a regency must control affairs, and so with Marie =
passed away the last=20

independent ruler of the house of Burgundy, whose greatness was to be trans=
mitted to and=20

surpassed by the son of this Philippe, the great Emperor Charles V.  The br=
ief and troubled life of=20

Marie de Bourgogne affords but little opportunity for an estimate of her ca=
pabilities. She was=20

reared under conditions the most unfavorable to the development of independ=
ence, self-reliance,=20

and capacity for practical affairs; for feudalism, even at its best, as we =
have seen, produced but=20

few women who were capable of ruling a nation, and the spectacular chivalry=
 of the Burgundian=20

court=20


_
The impulse to be contemporary is in our time, and perhaps always was, an i=
mpulse to tell the=20

news. This impulse is felt perhaps in all the arts, but most in books and i=
n the theatre, less in=20

music, still less in painting, and least in architecture and sculpture. Fro=
m these last we can learn, if=20

we need a reminder, what are the conditions of enduring art, and what, in c=
ontrast to popularity, is=20

fame. Sculpture and architecture, from the substantial nature of their medi=
um, must submit to be=20

looked at more than once, to be lived with, finally to be judged spectator =
of its great shows, one=20

infinitely removed by every detail of her education and of her social life =
from the sordid cares of life=20

and of politics. Marie was not of that rare type that might, even under suc=
h conditions, rise to=20

power; she was not strong enough of will to mark out a policy of her own an=
d bend men and=20

conditions to serve that policy. In not one of her public acts as duchess c=
an we find that she was=20

uninfluenced by those around her; she was indeed swayed first by one set of=
 counsellors, then by=20

another, the natural result being=20


_
opinions of many men over a long period of time; and a good opinion of such=
 work, so lived with,=20

will depend less on the first impression than on habitual contact. For such=
 work popularity is=20

difficult, if not impossible. A book about the war may be a popular book; t=
he Farragut statue in=20

Madison Square is not a popular statue. What statue is popular? It can have=
 only the better kind of=20

success, if any; like the Farragut, it can be famous, loved and returned to=
 over an indefinite length=20

of time. For we can read a book once and throw it aside, or hear music or s=
ee a play but once, and=20

then criticize it; it lies entirely in our choice whether we shall read or =
hear twice. How different our=20

criticism would be if it were based on at least half a dozen duplicity, and=
 inefficiency. But where the=20

mere woman appears, where there is room for the operation of impulses purel=
y personal, as in the=20

case of Hugonet and Humbercourt and in the selection of her husband, Marie =
displays nobler=20

feelings; and though the cause of civilization was to be advanced by the di=
smemberment of the=20

heterogeneous Burgundian duchy and the annexation of the greater part of it=
 to France, our=20

sympathy is not with the spider who sat spinning his meshes of intrigue in =
the den at Plessis-lez-

Tours, but with the generous, impulsive young ruler whom we know he will fa=
tally entangle. With=20

Marie in Burgundy, as with the passionate and unhappy Marguerite of Anjou i=
n England, we are=20

inclined to forgive the ruler who could not rule, or=20


_
and hearings! But the bronze and the building are not easily removed or ign=
ored, and even the=20

painting has a good chance of being looked at more than once. It is not sur=
prising then that the=20

sculptor, like the architect or the painter, attends to the infamous means =
in her struggles to rule,=20

when we remember that both were women brought face to face with tremendous =
problems and=20

made the sport of crafty, cruel, unscrupulous foes and faithless friends.  =
