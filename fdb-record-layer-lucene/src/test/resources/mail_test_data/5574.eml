arly industrious. They are=20

great drunkards, very quarrelsome, and are bad servants, as, although they =
will work hard for=20

themselves, they will do as little as they can for their master. They are s=
eldom unemployed; and,=20

while the Arab may be seen lazily stretched under the shade of a tree, the =
Tokroori will be=20

have frequently seen my men gather the cotton from some deserted bush, and =
immediately=20

improvise a spindle, by sticking a reed through a piece of camel-dung, with=
 which they would spin=20

the wool into thread, as they walked with the caravan. My Tokrooris had nev=

time they had been in my service, but they were at work in present at their=
 first meeting to take=20

part in their happiness. There were a lot of guests from Besztercebanya too=
, among them the=20

mother of the bridegroom, in a black silk dress, the President of the Court=
s, the mayor, and lots of=20

others. Then there were the Urszinyis from Kopanyica, two young ladies from=
 Lehota in pink=20

dresses, and Mrs. Muencz from Babaszek, with lovely golden earrings on.  Th=
ere were so many=20

Dear me, what a lovely procession it was too; the peasants stood and gazed =
open-mouthed at all=20

the people in their beautiful dresses, but most of all at the bride, who wa=

procession in a lovely white dress with a long veil and a wreath of orange-=
blossoms. Oh, how=20

pretty she was!  But the=20

kinds of articles they had manufactured. On the following morning I found t=
