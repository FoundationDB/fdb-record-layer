 good luck."  Under the circumstances, since there was nothing else to do a=
nd also because he was partly convinced of the truth of Thea's speech, Dr. =
Raymond agreed with her request. A few moments later, climbing up the hill,=
 they rejoined the other guests.  From the ground, smiling up at her in a t=
easing fashion usual in their relation to each other, Carlo at the same tim=
e was saying to Bianca Zoli:  "Sure you are not especially glad to be going=
 home, Bianca, chiefly because I am so soon to follow you? I've an idea you=
 would be very unhappy if we were parting for any length of time. Nicht war=
?"  Bianca shook her head, smiling and at the same time frowning.  "Under t=
hose circumstances, I should simply have tried to bear my departure       r=

eeded the call and came--   Came forth to the sweet wise silence where soul=
   _
extremely kind to me during my illness and both Sonya and I have learned to=
 understand her=20

better. Besides, I was prejudiced perhaps because of you," Bianca ended fra=
nkly.  But Carlo made=20

no comment.  Never did it fail to interest him Bianca's strange combination=
 of childishness and=20

womanhood. But today she seemed almost altogether childlike.  At this insta=
nt getting up Carlo=20

walked over to the mantel where he put down his tea cup and then stood look=
ing down on Bianca.=20

"Then we are friends, aren't we, Bee? And I hope we may never misunderstand=
 each other again.=20

I have been worried over your being ill and our not being fond of each othe=
r in the old way. You=20

may have to forgive me many things and perhaps I may have other friends in =
the future of whom=20

you may not approve, but you must not think they will make me forget my loy=
alty to you."  Bianca=20

was about to reply, but before this was possible Sonya Clark had opened the=
 door and re-entered=20

the room.  She glanced at Carlo Navara with a slight frown and then walked =
over and laid her=20

hand on Bianca's fair hair.  "Bee is looking better than you expected to fi=
nd her, isn't she, Carlo,=20

and more like a little girl? I for one am glad her illness has turned her y=
oung again. The war in=20

France has made most of us older than we were intended to be, but all the p=
ain and struggle of it=20

was especially hard upon a girl young as Bianca. I am going to take her bac=
k to New York as soon=20

as Dr. Clark is able to return and after a year at school I mean to bring h=
er out into New York=20

society as my grown-up daughter. I have always wanted a real one and Bianca=
 will be a lovely=20

substitute. Don't you think she will probably have   The cheap applause, th=
e blatant mob,     The=20

praise of underlings!    Praise ... praise ... was ever man so filled,     =
So avid still, of praise?   So=20

hungry for the crowd's acclaim,     The sycophantic phrase?    O you whom G=
reatness beckoned=20

to ...     O swollen Littleness   Who turned from Immortality     To fawn u=
pon Success!    O blind=20

with love of self, who led     Youth's vision to defeat,   Bawling and braw=
ling for rewards,     Loud,=20

in the common street!    O you who were so quick to judge--     Leader, and=
 loved, of yore--   Hear=20

now the judgment of our youth:     _Leader and Chief no more!_     THE BAYO=
NET    (1914)=20

THE great guns slay from a league away, the death-bolts       fly unseen,  =
 And bellowing hill=20

replies to hill, machine to brute       machine,   But still in the end whe=
n the long lines bend and=20

the battle hangs in doubt   They take to the steel in the same old way that=
       their fathers fought it=20

out--   It is man to man and breast to breast and eye       to bloodshot ey=
e   And the reach and twist=20

of the thrusting wrist, as       it was in the days gone by!    Along the s=
haken hills the guns their=20

drumming       thunder roll--   But the keen blades thrill with the lust to=
 kill       that leaps from the=20

slayer's soul!    For hand and heart and living steel, one pulse of       h=
ate they feel.   Is your clan=20

afraid of the naked blade?  Does it       flinch from the bitter steel?   P=
erish your dreams of=20

conquest then, your swollen       hopes and bold,   For empire dwells with =
the stabbing blade, as it=20

did in the days of old!     THE BUTCHERS AT PRAYER    (1914)    EACH nation=
 as it draws the=20

sword     And flings=20


_
Carlo looked a little annoyed.  "I thought you had finer ideals for Bianca,=
 Sonya, than to turn her=20

into a society woman!" he answered with a slight change of manner. "But of =
course she will be=20

charming. She is that already. And no doubt so many people will admire her =
that she will learn the=20

pleasant art of forgetting her old friends. I shall probably be in New York=
 only a part of each year.=20

Yet somehow, Bianca, I hope you will always remain the Bianca I have known =
for the past three=20

years. The war has made the time seem ever so much longer."  Again Bianca w=
as about to reply,=20

but Sonya glanced up at a little clock on the mantel.  "I am sorry, Carlo, =
but Bianca is not allowed=20

to see any one but a half hour at a time. I know she regrets having to say =
farewell to you, but we=20

are under orders. As for my ideals for Bianca, you need not fear. I mean to=
 do all I can to help=20

make her a gracious and lovely woman. And no one is ever to take Bianca for=
 granted, Carlo, not=20

even you. I think it may be good for her to know that there will be many pe=
rsons who will think her=20

attractive, as she has too humble an opinion of herself. Besides, every gir=
l has a right to a few=20

years of society and a little admiration. I am sure you agree with me?"  An=
d Carlo was obliged to=20

acquiesce.  Going back to his quarters, after saying goodby to Bianca, he r=
ealized what Sonya's=20

words and manner must have meant.  She considered that he had been too care=
less of Bianca=20

and perhaps thought her affection something which he could possess or lay a=
side at his own=20

convenience. But if Carlo were angered at this idea, he also realized that =
there was a certain truth=20

in Sonya's impression. However, in the future he meant to be more appreciat=
ive of Bianca's=20

affection, and kinder to the young girl for whom he felt a brotherly affect=
ion.     CHAPTER XIX  _A=20

Warning_   SOONER than he had hoped Major Hersey had an opportunity for a t=
alk alone with=20

Nora Jamison.  The passing days had wrought no change in his impression tha=
t there was=20

something of a suspicious nature taking place in the German household in wh=
ich he was billeted,=20

a something which was extremely disquieting. Nevertheless, so far he really=
 had no tangible=20

evidence which made it possible for him to go to one of his superior office=
rs. Unless he had some=20

foundation in fact for his suspicion, it would scarcely be fair or just to =
involve the members of the=20

Liedermann family in unnecessary notoriety and espionage. He must therefore=
 watch and wait=20

until he had discovered some justification for what at present was merely a=
 vague idea.  However,=20

there was nothing to prevent his suggesting to a girl, particularly one who=
 was an American Red=20

Cross nurse, that she try to avoid any appearance of intimacy or even frien=
dliness with a German=20

family, who might later be involved in a serious difficulty with the United=
 States military forces in=20

command of the occupied city of Coblenz.  Three days after reaching this de=
cision, Major James=20

Hersey was leaving the Liedermann house one afternoon just as Nora Jamison =
was in the act of=20

entering it. Their meeting took place as Major Hersey was about to open the=
 tall iron gate which=20

led into the yard. Indeed he stood aside in order to allow Nora Jamison to =
enter.  Their=20

acquaintance was a slight one, so that it is possible Nora Jamison may have=
 been surprised to=20

hear the young officer say to her in a hurried and confused fashion.  "Miss=
 Jamison, I must speak=20

to you for a few moments. Will you meet me in an hour under the big linden =
tree in the park where=20

Freia and Gretchen tell me you are in the habit of playing with them? I am =
sorry to trouble you but I=20

have what seems to me an important reason for wishing to talk to you."  In =
return, after studying=20

the young officer's face for a moment with her large grey eyes, Nora Jamiso=
n quietly acquiesced.=20

The next instant she disappeared inside the Liedermann house, the door bein=
g opened for her=20

almost instantly by Frau Liedermann herself.  It was possible that the Germ=
an lady may have=20



observed their brief conversation, yet Jimmie Hersey had no suspicion of Fr=
au Liedermann, who=20

struck him as being an outsider in the family of her husband.  An hour late=
r, when Major Hersey=20

sought the place he had chosen for their appointment, he discovered Nora Ja=
mison was there=20

before him.  She was sitting on a small bench under a   Petitions piously t=
he Lord--     Vexing the=20

void abyss with prayer.    O irony too deep for mirth!     O posturing apes=
 that rant, and dare   This=20

antic attitude!  O Earth,     With your wild jest of wicked prayer!    I da=
re not laugh ... a rising swell=20

Of laughter breaks in shrieks somewhere--   No doubt they relish it in Hell=
,     This cosmic jest of=20

Earth at prayer!       SHADOWS        HAUNTED    (THE GHOST SPEAKS)    A GH=
OST is the=20

freak of a sick man's brain?     Then why do ye start and shiver so?   That=
's the sob and drip of a=20

leaky drain?     But it sounds like another noise we know!     The heavy dr=
ops drummed red and=20

slow,   The drops ran down as slow as fate--     Do ye hear them still?--it=
 was long ago!--   But here=20

in the shadows I wait, I wait!    Spirits there be that pass in peace;     =
Mine passed in a whorl of=20

wrath and dole;   And the hour that your choking breath shall cease     I w=
ill get my grip on your=20

naked soul--     Nor pity may stay nor prayer cajole--   I would drag ye wh=
ining from Hell's own=20

gate:     To me, to me, ye must pay the toll!   And here in the shadows I w=
ait, I wait!    The dead=20

they are dead, they are out of the way?     And a ghost is the whim of an a=
iling mind?   Then why=20

did ye whiten with fear to-day     When ye heard a voice in the calling win=
d?     Why did ye falter=20

and look behind   At the creeping mists when the hour grew late?     Ye wou=
ld see my face were=20

ye stricken blind!   And here in the shadows I wait, I wait!    Drink and f=
orget, make merry and=20

boast,     But the boast rings false and the jest is thin--   In the hour t=
hat I meet ye ghost to ghost,=20

Stripped of the flesh that ye skulk within,     Stripped to the coward soul=
 'ware of its sin,   Ye shall=20

learn, ye shall learn, whether dead men         hate!     Ah, a weary time =
has the waiting been,   But=20

here in the shadows I wait, I wait!     A NIGHTMARE    LEAGUES before me, l=
eagues behind,=20

Clamor warring wastes of flood,   All the streams of all the worlds     Flu=
ng together, mad of mood;=20

Through the canon beats a sound,     Regular of interval,   Distant, drummi=
ng, muffled, dull,=20

Thunderously rhythmical;    Crafts slip by my startled soul--     Soul that=
 cowers, a thing apart--=20

They are corpuscles of blood!     That's the throbbing of a heart!   God of=
 terrors!--am I mad?--=20

Through my body, mine own soul,   Shrunken to an atom's size,     Voyages t=
oward an unguessed=20

goal!     THE MOTHER    THE mother by the gallows-tree,     The gallows-tre=
e, the gallows-tree,=20

(While the twitching body mocked the sun)   Lifted to Heaven her broken hea=
rt     And called for=20

sympathy.    Then Mother Mary bent to her,     Bent from her place by God's=
 left side,   And=20

whispered: "Peace--do I not know?--     My son was crucified!"    "O Mother=
 Mary," answered she,=20

"You cannot, cannot enter in   To my soul's woe--you cannot know--     For =
your son wrought no=20

sin!"    (And men whose work compelled them there,     Their hearts were st=
ricken dead;    They=20

heard the rope creak on the beam;     I thought I heard the frightened ghos=
t     Whimpering=20

overhead.)    The mother by the gallows-tree,     The gallows-tree, the gal=
lows-tree,   Lifted to=20

Christ her broken heart     And called in agony.    Then Lord Christ bent t=
o her and said:     "Be=20

comforted, be comforted;   I know your grief; the whole world's woe     I b=
ore upon my head."=20

"But O Lord Christ, you cannot know,     No one can know," she said, "no on=
e"--   (While the=20

quivering corpse swayed in the wind)--   "Lord Christ, no one can understan=
d     Who never had a=20

son!"     IN THE BAYOU    LAZY and slow, through the snags and trees     Mo=

dark tides creep--   How deep is the bayou beneath the trees?   "Knee-deep,=
           Knee-deep,=20

Knee-deep,                           Knee-deep!"   Croaks the big bullfrog =
of Reelfoot Lake   From his=20

hiding-place in the draggled brake.    What is the secret the slim reeds kn=
ow   That makes them to=20

shake and to shiver so,   And the scared flags quiver from plume to foot?--=
   The frogs pipe=20

solemnly, deep and slow:   "Look under           the root!                 =
  Look under                           the=20

root!"    The hoarse frog croaks and the stark owl hoots   Of a=20


_
flowering blossoms which scented the air with a delicious fragrance.  Evide=
ntly she was thinking=20

deeply.  Nora Jamison's exceptional appearance did not attract the young of=
ficer, although she did=20

interest and puzzle him.  Her short hair, her slender, almost boyish figure=
, the queer elfin look in=20

her face, which made one wonder what she was _really_ thinking even at the =
time she was talking=20

in a perfectly natural fashion, had a tantalizing rather than a pleasant ef=
fect upon some persons.=20

Yet once seated beside her Major Jimmie felt less embarrassment than he had=
 anticipated. One=20

had to believe in any human being for whom children cared as they did for t=
his American girl.=20

"Freia and Gretchen talk about you always," he began a little awkwardly. "I=
 thought at the=20

beginning of our acquaintance that I was to be their favored friend, but so=
on found you had=20

completely won their allegiance. But where is your usual companion, the lit=
tle French girl?"  "I left=20

her at the hospital today, Major Hersey; for a special reason I wished to m=
ake a call upon Frau=20

Liedermann alone. But please do not let us talk about Freia and Gretchen at=
 present though they=20

are dear little girls. You have something you specially want to say to me a=
nd I must be back at my=20

work at the hospital in another half hour."  Major Hersey was a soldier and=
 Nora's directness=20

pleased him.  "Yes, it is absurd of me to waste your time," he returned. "T=
he fact is simply this. As=20

I am billeted in their house for the present I cannot very well have failed=
 to notice that you are=20

developing what looks like a personal intimacy with the Liedermann family. =
I presume you know=20

that the Americans in Coblenz, who have anything to do with the United Stat=
es army, are not=20

supposed to fraternize with the Germans. You may regard it as impertinent o=
f me to recall this fact=20

to your attention. I presume you consider that this advice should come from=
 some one in more=20

direct authority over you, but I assure you I only mean to be friendly. I h=
ave no real evidence for=20

my statement, but I am under the impression that certain members of Colonel=
 Liedermann's family=20

are still extremely hostile to their conquerors. Moreover, you yourself rea=
lize that as the terms of=20

peace are delayed there is not merely a sense of irritation and discontent =
with the present German=20

government, but attempts are being made both secretly and openly to overthr=
ow it. I have=20

mentioned my suspicion to no one except you, Miss Jamison, which of course =
shows my=20

confidence in you, but it has occurred to me as a possibility that Colonel =
Liedermann, or his invalid=20

son, may be less reconciled to existing conditions in Germany than they pre=
fer to pretend. Later, if=20

a discovery of this character should be made, I would regret to have any on=
e of our American Red=20

Cross nurses drawn into such an uncomfortable situation."  Annoyed with his=
 own confused=20

method of stating a situation, Major Jimmie Hersey paused, coloring in his =
usual annoying fashion,=20

as if he were a tongue-tied boy.  Yet his companion was looking at him with=
out any suggestion of=20

offense, and rather as if she too were pondering some important matter.  "T=
hank you for your=20

advice, Major Hersey," she replied the next moment. "Now I am going to ask =
you to trust me. I=20

have a reason for going to the Liedermann house and I must go there perhaps=
 several times=20

within the next few days. Afterwards I may be able to explain to you my rea=
son. Will you trust me=20

and not report my actions to any one for the present?"  With Nora Jamison's=
 eyes facing his=20

directly, although against his own judgment, there was nothing the young of=
ficer felt able to do but=20

agree to her request. Yet it was out of order and it appeared to him that N=
ora Jamison was being=20

vague and mysterious. It were wiser if she attended strictly to her Red Cro=
ss nursing. Surely some=20

one of the other Red Cross nurses had told him that this Miss Jamison was n=
ot inclined to be=20

especially intimate with any of them.  That same afternoon after several ho=
urs of indoor work,=20



making out a report for his superior officer, Major James Hersey felt that =
he was rewarded for the=20

day's duties by an afternoon ride with the Countess Charlotta.  As they had=
 no other chaperon for=20

their ride, Miss Susan Pringle had consented to accompany them, rather to M=
ajor Jimmie's=20

consternation. He feared that she was taking an incredible risk with her ow=
n health and safety in=20

order that her adored young countess should not be disappointed. Yet it was=
 soon evident that the=20

middle-aged English spinster was an accomplished horsewoman.  Along the Rhi=
ne that afternoon=20

in the late April sunshine the water shone like rusty gold. High on the opp=
osite hills the old feudal=20

castles looked to Major Jimmie like the castles he had read of in the fairy=
 stories of his childhood.=20

Moreover, it was easy even for a prosaic soldier, such as Major James Herse=
y considered himself=20

to be, to think of the little Countess Charlotta Scherin as the heroine of =
almost any    Was it love=20

turned hate?  Was it friend turned foe?   Only the frogs and the gray owl k=
now,     For the white=20

moon shrouded her face in a mist   At the spurt of a pistol, red and bright=
--   At the sound of a=20

shriek that stabbed the night--     And the little reeds were frightened an=
d whist;   But always the=20

CHAPTER XX  _Nora Jamison Explains_   IT was toward the end of the same wee=
k that a note=20

arrived for Major James Hersey from Sonya Clark. She asked him to make an a=
ppointment with=20

Colonel Winfield in order that he might see her and one of her Red Cross nu=
rses as soon as=20

possible. Would Major Hersey also try to be present? There was a reason, wh=
ich he would=20

understand, why his presence might be necessary.  Colonel Winfield and Sony=
a Clark were great=20

friends, as the colonel had been one of the commanders of a regiment statio=
ned near the Red=20

Cross hospital in the neighborhood of Chateau-Thierry for many months befor=
e the close of the=20

war.  The colonel, however, was not in his library at the moment of Major H=
ersey's arrival. Sonya=20

Clark and Nora Jamison were there awaiting his appearance.  "We are a few m=
oments early; I=20

suppose the colonel will be here directly," Sonya remarked. "You may not ap=
prove of our having=20

come first to the colonel's quarters instead of seeing one of the heads of =
our secret service," she=20

continued, "but since neither Miss Jamison nor I knew exactly what we shoul=
d do, we decided to=20

make a report directly to you. Then you will know what should be done. Secr=
ecy seemed to us of=20

first importance."  During Sonya's speech Colonel Winfield had come into hi=
s room and now=20

apologized for his delay.  Nora Jamison had never met the distinguished off=
icer before, and=20

therefore looked a little frightened, but a glance at Major Jimmie's intere=
sted face reassured her.=20

After all he was the one person who would substantiate the story she had to=
 tell, for even if he had=20

no positive evidence at least his suspicions would coincide with her knowle=
dge.  "You are sure=20

there is no one who may overhear us, Colonel Winfield?" she asked a little =
timidly. "I think when I=20

tell you what I am about to that you will understand why one still has reas=
on to suspect almost any=20

one in Germany, although the good of course must suffer with the evil."  Co=
lonel Winfield nodded.=20

"I understood from Mrs. Clark that you wished to talk to me on a private ma=
tter and I have one of=20

my orderlies stationed at the door. There is no chance of being overheard. =
As for continuing to feel=20

suspicion of the enemy, while the American army is policing the Rhine it is=
 our business to take=20

every precaution against treachery. At present I wish I could be more certa=
in that the state of mind=20

among the inhabitants of Coblenz is what it appears upon the surface. Tell =
me what information=20

you have and how you have acquired it. There is a possibility that I may no=
t be so much in the=20

dark as you at present suspect, Miss Jamison."  "If you don't mind, may I t=
ake off my hat while I=20

talk?" Nora Jamison asked. "It is boyish of me, I suspect, but I can talk b=
etter with my hat off. Do=20

you happen to know, Colonel Winfield, that there are persons in Germany who=
 are friendly to the=20

Kaiser in spite of all that he has made them endure? Actually they do not s=
eem to realize that he is=20

chiefly responsible for the tragedy of their country and her present positi=
on as an outcast among=20

the nations."  "Yes, I quite understand that fact," Colonel Winfield return=
ed drily.  "Then do you=20

also know, Colonel, that there are men and women in Germany today who are a=
nxious to rescue=20

the Kaiser from his fate. They would make any possible sacrifice to save hi=
m from being tried by=20

an international court in case the Allies decide upon this course. But perh=
aps I had best tell my=20

story from the beginning and you must forgive me if some of it appears conf=
used."  At this instant,=20

clasping her hands together in her lap, Nora Jamison sat staring straight a=
head, but looking at=20

nothing in the room, rather at some mental picture.  "When I came to Europe=
 I hoped to be of=20

service as a Red Cross nurse, but by the time I arrived the war was over an=
d the armistice about=20

to be signed. Still I hoped I had not come altogether in vain and persuaded=
 Dr. Clark to bring me=20

with him as a member of his Red Cross staff who were to serve with the Amer=
ican Army of=20



Occupation in Coblenz.  "I felt a good deal of bitterness in coming into Ge=
rmany. The young man=20

to whom I was engaged was killed by the Germans near Chateau-Thierry. I kno=
w it was wrong and=20

yet I felt as if I would like to revenge myself upon them for all I have su=
ffered. I must apologize for=20

telling you this, but you will see that it does bear upon my story.  "Well,=
 after I came to Germany,=20

although I discovered that I did dislike and distrust the German people, ye=
t I could not make up my=20

mind not to feel affection for the little German kinder, who after all were=
 in no way responsible for=20

the war. I always nursed children before I joined the Red Cross and have a =
special fondness for=20

them. The little French Louisa and I, who are always together except when I=
 am at work, made=20

friends with a number of the German children. Among them were two little gi=
rls, whom Major=20

Hersey will tell you are especially attractive. But if I seemed to single o=
ut these two children and=20

especially the older one, Freia, it was not because she so greatly attracte=
d me. Early in our=20

acquaintance the little girl told me an anecdote which struck me as extraor=
dinary and almost=20

immediately aroused my suspicion. Please don't think I found out at once wh=
at I am trying to tell=20

you, I at first had to piece things together.  "Freia told me that her brot=
her, Captain Ludwig=20

Liedermann, who had been wounded, had recovered, but would not leave his ro=
om and did not=20

wish any one to know he was well. Freia received the impression that he did=
 not wish to be seen=20

by any of the American officers or soldiers in Coblenz. He once told little=
 Freia that he hated to=20

meet the men who had defeated their Emperor and driven him into exile."  Th=
e Colonel nodded.=20

"Yes, well, that strikes me as if alone it might be a sufficient reason. I =
would not be surprised if=20

there were other German officers and soldiers hiding from us with this same=
 excuse. However, we=20

shall remain on duty in Germany until both the military and the civilians f=
ind it wiser not to seek=20

cover in order to escape the consequences of their past."  "Yes, I know, bu=
t this did not seem to=20

me all there was in Freia's story," Nora continued. "So I confess I made fr=
iends with the little girl=20

largely in order to gain her further confidence. She afterwards told me oth=
er things that were=20

puzzling. I knew that the Germans in Coblenz were not allowed to hold secre=
t meetings, but Freia=20

insisted that officers who had been old friends of her brother's came const=
antly to their house and=20

that     I    MORNING    WE stood among the boats and nets;     We saw the =
swift clouds fall,   We=20

watched the schooners scamper in     Before the sudden squall;--   The joll=
y squall strove lustily=20

To whelm the sheltered street--   The merry squall that piled the seas   Ab=
out the patient=20

headland's knees     And chased the fishing fleet.    She laughed; as if wi=
th wings her mirth   Arose=20

and left the wingless earth     And all tame things behind;   Rose like a b=
ird, wild with delight=20

Whose briny pinions flash in flight     Through storm and sun and wind.    =
Her laughter sought=20

those skies because     Their mood and hers were one,   For she and I were =
drunk with love=20

And life and storm and sun!    And while she laughed, the Sun himself     L=
eapt laughing through=20

the rain   And struck his harper hand along   The ringing coast; and that w=
ind-song     Whose joy is=20

mixed with pain   Forgot the undertone of grief     And joined the jocund s=
train,   And over every=20

hidden reef   Whereon the waves broke merrily   Rose jets and sprays of mel=
ody     And leapt and=20

laughed again.     II    MOONLIGHT    We stood among the boats and nets ...=
     We marked the=20

risen moon   Walk swaying o'er the trembling seas     As one sways in a swo=
on;    The little stars,=20

the lonely stars,     Stole through the hollow sky,   And every sucking edd=
y where   The waves=20

lapped wharf or rotten stair   Moaned like some stricken thing hid there   =
And strangled with its=20

own despair     As the shuddering tide crept by.    I loved her, and I hate=
d her--     Or did I hate=20



myself because,     Bound by obscure, strong, silken laws,   I felt myself =
the worshiper     Of beauty=20

never wholly mine?   With lures most apt to snare, entwine,   With bonds to=
o subtle to define,   Her=20

lighter nature mastered mine;   Herself half given, half withheld,   Her le=
sser spirit still compelled=20

Its tribute from my franker soul:     So--rebel, slave, and worshiper!--   =
  I loved her and I hated her.=20

I gazed upon her, I, her thrall,     And musing, murmured, _What if death_ =
   _Were just the answer=20

to it all?--     Suppose some dainty dagger quaffed     Her life in one dee=
p eager draught?--=20

Suppose some amorous knife caressed   The lovely hollow of her breast?"_-- =
  She turned a=20

mocking look to mine:   She read the thought within my eyne,     She held m=
e with her look--and=20

laughed!    Now who may tell what stirs, controls,     And shapes mad fanci=
es into facts?   What=20

trivial things may quicken souls     To irrevocable, swift acts?   Now who =
has known, who=20

understood,     Wherefore some idle thing     May stab with deadlier sting =
  Than well-considered=20

insult could?--   May spur the languor of a mood   And rouse a tiger in the=
 blood?--    Ah, Christ!--

had she not laughed just when   That fancy came! ... for then ... and then =
...     A sudden mist=20

dropped from the sky,    A mist swept in across the sea ...   A mist that h=
id her face from me ...     A=20

weeping mist all tinged with red,   A dripping mist that smelt like blood .=
..     It choked my throat, it=20

burnt my brain ...   And through it peered one sallow star,     And through=
 it rang one shriek of pain=20

...   And when it passed my hands were red,     My soul was dabbled with he=
r blood;   And when it=20

passed my love was dead     And tossed upon the troubled flood.     III    =
MOONSET    But see! ...=20

the body does not sink;     It rides upon the tide   (A starbeam on the dag=
ger's haft),     With staring=20

eyes and wide ...   And now, up from the darkling sea,     Down from the fa=
iling moon,   Are come=20

strange shapes to mock at me ...   All pallid from the star-pale sea,     W=
hite from the paling moon=20

...    Or whirling fast or wheeling slow   Around, around the corpse they g=
o,   All bloodless o'er the=20

sickened sea     Beneath the ailing moon!    And are they only wisps of fog=
     That dance along the=20

waves?   Only shapes of mist the wind     Drives along the waves?   Or are =
they spirits that the sea=20

Has cheated of their graves?   The ghosts of them that died at sea,   Of mu=
rdered men flung in the=20

sea,     Whose bodies had no graves?--   Lost souls that haunt for evermore=
   The sobbing reef=20

and hollowed shore     And always-murmuring caves?    Ah, surely something =
more than fog,=20

More than starlit mist!   For starlight never makes a sound     And fogs ar=

 her sister Hedwig's=20

hatred of the Americans. It seems that Fraulein Liedermann and I have at le=
ast one experience in=20

common. The German captain to whom she was engaged was also killed in the w=
ar. Hedwig was=20

angry because her little German half-sisters were willing to make friends w=
ith Major Hersey and=20

me. But I must not take so long to come to my point. I also made friends wi=
th Frau Liedermann.=20

Often I went to her house, although always I was afraid that the fact would=
 be reported. If I was=20

found to be fraternizing with the Germans I would have been forced to end m=
y acquaintance with=20

the Liedermanns, as you know.  "I   Where Wit keeps tryst with Folly, at   =
  The Tavern of Despair.=20

And we have come by divers ways     To keep this merry tryst,   But few of =
us have kept within=20

The Narrow Way, I wist;   For we are those whose ampler wits     And hearts=
 have proved our=20

curse--   Foredoomed to ken the better things     And aye to do the worse! =
   Long since we=20

learned to mock ourselves;     And from self-mockery fell    To heedless la=

They are so dead and cold;   We flout the things we might=20


_
discovered is this: Captain Liedermann, the colonel his father, and a numbe=
r of other German=20

officers have for weeks been making a secret effort to have the Kaiser spir=
ited away from Holland.=20

Their plan is to conceal him in some spot where the Allies will be unable t=
o discover him. Then,=20

when the resentment against him dies down the Kaiser will be rescued and br=
ought back to=20

Germany. Captain Liedermann has been trying for a long time to get out of C=
oblenz. But I cannot=20

tell you anything more than this bare outline of the German plan."  Breathl=
ess and shaking a little=20

from fatigue and excitement, Nora Jamison now paused.  "You mean to tell me=
 that you have=20

made this extraordinary discovery during your occasional visits to the Lied=
ermann home, when I=20

who have been billeted there for months have learned nothing?" Major Hersey=
 demanded,=20

coloring in his habitual fashion, but this time partly from admiration of t=
he girl beside him and partly=20

from annoyance with himself.  "Yes, but our positions have been entirely di=
fferent, Major Hersey,"=20

Nora explained. "Every precaution was taken to see that you found out nothi=
ng. Indeed you were=20

apparently welcomed into the Liedermann household so that your presence the=
re might be a blind.=20

What I found out was owing to my intimacy with the two little girls and lat=
er with Frau Liedermann.=20

I hope for her sake it may never be discovered just how much she did confid=
e to me. I sometimes=20

think she almost wanted me to report what I knew, she is so weary of war an=
d intrigue and=20

deception, and is almost as much of a child as her two little girls. I thin=
k this is all I have to tell at=20

present. If our Intelligence Department should wish to ask me questions lat=
er, why I may be able=20

to answer them."  Colonel Winfield rose and walked over to Nora.  "You have=
 given me=20

extraordinarily valuable information, Miss Jamison. I shall see that it rea=

under the circumstances I feel that I have the right to tell you this. We d=
id know something of this=20

plot you have just unveiled. What we did not know was where to find the cen=
tre of the conspiracy=20

in Coblenz. I think you need have no uneasiness, the Kaiser will never be s=
aved from the=20

consequences of his acts while the allied armies are policing the Rhine. Ho=
wever, Miss Jamison I=20

am glad to have had you in Coblenz and think you have justified your coming=
 to Germany. May I=20

congratulate a Red Cross girl for another variety of service to her country=
. Now you are tired, shall=20

I not send you back to the hospital in my car?"  But Sonya Clark shook her =
head.  "No, thank you,=20

Colonel Winfield. Dr. Clark is to have one of the Red Cross automobiles com=
e for us, which is=20

probably now waiting around the corner. We wished our visit to you to be kn=
own to as few persons=20

as possible. Major Hersey will see us to the car. Goodby."     CHAPTER XXI =
 _The Rainbow=20

Bridge_   ONE afternoon in May, Sonya Clark was entertaining a number of fr=
iends among the=20

American officers and soldiers in Coblenz in the garden back of the America=
n Red Cross hospital.=20

During the early spring the Red Cross girls had devoted many leisure hours =
to digging and=20

planting flower seed on the level space just behind the old building and ov=
erlooking the banks of=20

the Rhine.  This afternoon this spot was gay with spring flowers, also ther=
e were old rose vines=20

climbing high on the grey stone walls, now a delicate green but promising a=
 rich bloom in June.=20

These were troubled days in Germany, the most troubled since the arrival of=
 the American Army of=20

Occupation. A short time before the allied peace terms had been presented t=
o the German=20

delegates in Versailles; since then all Germany had been crying aloud prote=
sts against a just=20

retribution. Germany was in official mourning.  Yet the Americans in Coblen=
z, soldiers and civilians=20

alike, were undisturbed, knowing Germany would sign the terms when the fina=
l moment arrived.=20



Today something of greater importance was taking place among Sonya Clark's =
and Dr. David=20

Clark's friends. This little reception was their farewell. In a short time =
they were returning to New=20

York taking with them a number of their staff of Red Cross nurses. Several =
days before a new unit=20

of Red Cross workers had arrived in Coblenz, relieving former members who d=
esired to return=20

home.  The afternoon was a lovely one, now and then occasional light clouds=
 showed in the sky,=20

but away off on the opposite bank of the Rhine there were lines of blue hil=
ls, then purple, fading at=20

last to a dim grey.  Sonya and Dr. Clark were standing among a little group=
 of friends. Nona Davis=20

and Mildred Thornton were beside them. Both of the original Red Cross girls=
 were wearing=20

decorations which they had lately received from the French government and t=
he United States=20

government in recognition of their     Had self to self proved true,   We m=

We mock the garnered rue;    The fates that gibe have lessoned us;     Ther=

earth   No madder crew of wastrels than     This fellowship of mirth....   =
(Of mirth ... drink, fools!--

nor let it flag     Lest from the outer mist   Creep in that other company =
    Unbidden to the tryst.=20

We're grown so fond of paradox     Perverseness holds us thrall,   So what =
each jester loves the=20

best     He mocks the most of all;   But as the jest and laugh go round,   =
  Each in his neighbor's=20

eyes   Reads, while he flouts his heart's desire,     The knowledge that he=
 lies.    Not one of us but=20

had some pearls     And flung them to the swine,   Not one of us but had so=
me gift--     Some spark=20

of fire divine--   Each might have been God's minister     In the temple of=
 some art--   Each feels=20

d Azrael to Him now=20

And bade Death bend the bow   Against the saddest heart that beats     Here=
 on this earth below,=20

Not any sobbing breast would gain     The guerdon of that barb--    The sad=
dest ones are those=20

that wear     The jester's motley garb.    Whose shout aye loudest rings, a=
nd whose     The=20

maddest cranks and quips--   Who mints his soul to laughter's coin     And =
wastes it with his lips--=20

Has grown too sad for sighs and seeks     To cheat himself with mirth;   We=
 fools self-doomed to=20

motley are     The weariest wights on earth!    But yet, for us whose brain=
s and hearts     Strove=20

aye in paths perverse,   Doomed still to know the better things     And sti=
ll to do the worse,--   What=20

else is there remains for us     But make a jest of care   And set the raft=

E.    So young,=20

but already the splendor     Of genius robed him about--   Already the dang=
erous, tender     Regard=20

of the gods marked him out--    (On whom the burden and duty     They bind,=
 at his earliest breath,=20

Of showing their own grave beauty,     They love and they crown with death.=

holds in thrall--    Quick visions that served and attended,     Elusive an=
d hovering things,   With a=20

quiver of joy in the splendid     Wild sweep of their luminous wings;    He=
 dwelt in an alien glamor,=20

He wrought of its gleams a crown,--   But the world, with its cruelty and c=
lamor,     Broke him and=20

beat him down;    So he passed; he was worn, he was weary,     He was slain=
 at the touch of life;--=20

With a smile that was wistful and eerie     He passed from the senseless st=
rife;--    So he ceased=20

(is their humor satiric,     These gods that make perfect and blight?)--   =

They were leaving with Sonya and Dr. Clark for the United States and were e=
xpecting to be=20

was congratulating them=20

and at the same time lamenting their departure from Coblenz.  "I wonder if =
you will tell me just=20

what members of Dr. Clark's staff are going with him?" he inquired. "I fear=
 I shall feel a stranger=20

and an outsider at the American Red Cross hospital when so many of you sail=
 for home who were=20

with me in the neighborhood of Chateau-Thierry, caring for our wounded Amer=
ican boys. May your=20

married life be as happy as you deserve."  Slipping one hand through the el=

Nona Davis suggested to him and to Mildred Thornton:  "Suppose we take a li=
