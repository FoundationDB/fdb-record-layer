Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Pr=
oject Gutenberg=20

Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporati=
on organized under the=20

laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Inter=
nal Revenue Service.=20

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Co=
ntributions to the=20

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the ful=
l extent permitted by=20

U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's principal office=
 is in Fairbanks, Alaska,=20

with the mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its volun=
teers and employees=20



are scattered  But, however this may be, it is a principle of professional =
ethics, which has almost=20

acquired the authority of legal doctrine, that a physician in charge of a c=
ase should obtain the full=20

assent of a patient, or of his family and friends, if he is too ill to give=
 his own consent, to the calling=20

of another physician in consultation.  _No Other Stranger can be Called int=
o Sick-Room without=20

Assent of Patient._=E2=80=94A limitation upon the authority and right of an=
 attending physician is, that if he=20

desires or attempts to call in a stranger not a physician, he must obtain h=
is patient=E2=80=99s consent. The=20

obligation of a physician toward his patient of secrecy and confidence is r=
egarded as very strict,=20

and if a physician should call in a student or other stranger, without firs=
t consulting his patient, or=20

those who are in some measure related to him and connected with him, it wou=
ld be a very severe=20

stretch of morals and possibly of law. In fact, in a recent case in Michiga=
n, a physician was held=20

liable for damages who called in a stranger, an unmarried man, who was an u=
nprofessional man,=20

to be with him while he was in attendance on a confinement case. In that ca=
se both the physician=20

and the person so called in, and who was present at that time, were held li=
able in damages; and it=20

was further held that the right to recover was not affected by the fact tha=
t the patient supposed that=20

the person so called in was a medical man, and therefore submitted to his p=
resence without=20

objection.[174]  The statutes which create the privilege as to professional=
 communications and=20

information necessary to enable the physician to prescribe, might not apply=
 to students or other=20

strangers, and this is probably the reason for the rule of law laid down in=
 the Michigan case. The=20

obligation to preserve inviolate a communication as a privileged communicat=
ion, including in the=20

meaning of the word =E2=80=9Ccommunication=E2=80=9D all knowledge or inform=
ation received while in attendance=20

upon a case, would be held to have been broken by the act of the physician =
in bringing in a=20

stranger who would not be privileged from testifying.   MEASURE OF RECOVERY=
 FOR=20

SERVICES RENDERED.  _Terms of Express Contract Govern=E2=80=94Reasonable Wo=
rth the Rule in=20

Implied Contracts._=E2=80=94In case of an express contract its terms necess=
arily measure the amount of=20

the charges. In the absence of an express contract fixing the value of the =
services to be rendered,=20

the measure of damages for breach of payment is like that in any other case=
 of personal services,=20

the reasonable worth and value of the services performed. So likewise if me=
dicines or appliances=20

are furnished, which are not reasonably to be expected and furnished, accor=
ding to the custom of=20

the school to which the physician or surgeon belongs, the reasonable worth =
and value at the time=20

of furnishing them, and at the place of furnishing them, is the measure fix=
ed by the law to=20

determine what shall be recovered for them.[175]  _Value=E2=80=94How Proved=
._=E2=80=94When the medical=20

man is compelled to go into court to enforce payment for his services, it h=
as been questioned=20

whether he can testify to the services rendered, and the facts and circumst=
ances surrounding the=20

patient at the time of the treatment, because it has been claimed that he c=
ould not do so without=20

violating the statute against the disclosure by physicians of information r=
eceived which is=20

necessary to enable them to prescribe. The tendency of the later decisions,=
 however, seems to be=20

that the breach of the patient=E2=80=99s contract to pay relieves the physi=
cian from his obligation of=20

secrecy, and consequently, that if it is necessary for him to go into court=
 and prove the value of his=20

services, he may testify, within reasonable limitations, to all matters nec=
essary to inform the court=20

fully as to the nature and extent of the disease or injuries of the patient=
, in order that he may show=20

the responsibility imposed upon him and the extent of the services that he =
has rendered. This=20
