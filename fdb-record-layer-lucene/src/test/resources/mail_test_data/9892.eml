D'Artagnan, in two steps, was engaged with the foe, whom, according to custom, he attacked impetuously, but he met this time with a dracaena marginata  "To the swords! be it so!" replied D'Artagnan; "that is exactly what I want."

fourteen asterisms, or 180 deg., from the beginning of Mrigashirsha to     that of Mula, and hence 

the date at which the vernal equinox     coincided with the beginning of Mula was at least 3341 + 

180 x 72     = 16,301 B.C. The position of the four principal points on the     ecliptic was then as 

given below:      The winter solstice in the beginning of Uttara Phalguni in the     month of 

Shravana.      The vernal equinox in the beginning of Mula in Karttika.      The summer solstice in 

the beginning of Purva Bhadrapada in Magha.      The autumnal equinox in the beginning of

were only twenty steps from them.  "For the king!" cried D'Artagnan.  "The king has no authority 

here!" answered a deep voice, which seemed to proceed from a cloud, so enveloped was the

than the one discovered by Mr. Bentley. The passages are given in     fell, groaning.  "For the last 

time, where are you going?"  "To the devil!" answered D'Artagnan.  "Good! you may be easy, then-

-you'll get there."  D'Artagnan then saw a musket-barrel leveled at him; he had no time to draw 

from his holsters. He

"I am the Margashirsha [_viz._ the first among the months] and the     spring [_viz._ the first 

among the seasons]."      This shows that at one time the first month of spring was 

Margashirsha. A season includes two months, and the mention of a     month suggests the
