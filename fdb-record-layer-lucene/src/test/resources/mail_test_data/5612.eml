philodendron monstera prowling cautiously after a deer family, consisting o=
f a buck, two does, and three fawns, he made the acquaintance of another ca=
t, much larger and more supple than the lynx.  The deer were moving slowly =
from point to point, browsing as physical force, than ever was known. I hav=

 cautiously after a deer family, consisting of a buck, two does, and three =
fawns, he made the acquaintance of another cat, much larger and more supple=
 than the lynx.  The deer were moving slowly from point to point, browsing =
as physical force, than ever was known. I have heard that from the highest =
authority. For my own part, I think I am prepared to die for Divine truth. =
I have examined myself severely, but I do not think I should falter. Indeed=
, can there be _
watching and waiting.  The same afternoon he saw the mother, wild-eyed and =
bleating, racing=20

wildly up and down the forest, asking, by terrified looks and actions, "Hav=
e you seen my little=20

dappled fawn?  He is gone and there is strong bear-scent about the tree-top=
 where I hid him."  For=20

several days she haunted the region and her anxiety and heedlessness of her=
 own safety nearly=20

caused her to fall a victim to the wary hunter, but she finally disappeared=
 altogether.  It was not=20

until the full glory of mid-summer was over the land that Black Bruin met W=
hite Nose in a blueberry=20

patch upon a barren hillside. At first she would have nothing to do with hi=
m, but he followed her so=20

persistently that she was at last obliged to take notice.  For a long time =
something in earth and air=20

had been calling to Black Bruin,--something that he craved above all other =
things; but what it was=20

he never knew until he rubbed muzzles with White Nose and felt her warm bre=
ath in his face.=20

Then he knew that he had found what he wanted and that the old loneliness w=
ould not haunt him=20

again.  But there was one thing about him that made his mate most suspiciou=
s and it took much=20

patient coaxing upon Black Bruin's part to overcome her misgivings.  This w=
as the strong leather=20

collar that the former dancing-bear still wore about his neck.  It was the =
collar into which Pedro had=20

fastened the chain during the latter part of the bear's captivity.  This Wh=
ite Nose could not=20

understand.  In all her experience she had never seen a bear wearing such a=
 thing as this.  The=20

man-scent about it, too, made it still more alarming.  But at last her prej=
udice was overcome, and=20

the two came and went together during the rest of the summer and the early =
autumn.  From her=20

Black Bruin learned many of the secrets of the woods that had hitherto been=
 hidden from him.=20

White Nose had been reared in the wild, so all her senses were keen and the=
 woods and waters=20

were her hunting-ground.  Together they caught salmon at a shallow point in=
 the stream where all=20

they had to do was to sit upon a rock and knock them out on the bank as the=
y passed.  Together,=20

in the early autumn, they raided a beaver colony, breaking into the houses =
and killing several of=20

the members. Black Bruin thought he had never tasted anything in his life q=
uite so delicious as=20

beaver-meat.  White Nose also taught him how to lie in wait for the deer in=
 a clump of bushes by=20

some pathway that they were in the habit of following, or by the lick, or p=
erhaps by a spring where=20

they often came to drink, and then, before they suspected their presence, t=
o make a sudden rush.=20

She showed him a hollow birch-stub, in which a family of raccoons dwelt, an=
d together they set to=20

work to destroy the household of their own smaller brother.  They dug and t=
ore at the base of the=20

stub until they had undermined it, and then together pushed it over.  At fi=
rst the raccoon family=20

were much astonished and terrified at the commotion outside their dwelling,=
 and when finally the=20

house came down, three sleek raccoons fled in as many directions.  White No=
se secured one and=20

Black Bruin another, while the third escaped.  The last thing in the autumn=
, before they denned up,=20

the two bears made a long journey of several days to the nearest settlement=
, where they killed=20

several sheep, and also carried off two small pigs.  In this stealing, Blac=
k Bruin took the lead, for=20

he knew much better the ways of man, and the danger from his thunder and li=
ghtning than did his=20

companion.  Upon this good supply of mutton and pork they laid on the final=
 layers of fat, and then=20

returned to their wilderness and denned up for the winter.     CHAPTER XII =
 THE KING OF THE=20

MOUNTAIN  The following spring, when Black Bruin came forth from hibernatio=
n, he went one=20

day's journey nearer to the settlements and took up headquarters in a rugge=
d and heavily=20

timbered series of mountains, which were admirably adapted to his purpose. =
 Whenever he awoke=20

during his winter nap he still tasted pork and mutton from the autumn raid.=
  Henceforth he must=20



have more of that diet.  So the reason for his changing his base of operati=
ons will be readily seen.=20

One day's journey would carry him back into the wilderness, with its fine r=
esources for fishing and=20

hunting, while a day's travel in the opposite direction would bring him to =
the outskirts of the=20

settlements, within easy striking distance of plunder.  At his first meetin=
g with White Nose, he=20

found her most unresponsive to his advances, considering the fact that they=
 had come and gone=20

together all through the autumn.  The reason for her indifference was soon =
discovered, for Black=20

Bruin saw that she had two little fuzzy cubs in tow;--one with a smutty whi=
te nose like her own, and=20

the other with a dark muzzle like Black Bruin's.  If Black Bruin knew that =
these were his offspring,=20

he did not evince much interest in them, while White Nose would hardly let =
him go near them.=20

Perhaps she was afraid that he might eat them, or maybe it was only materna=
l jealousy, which is=20

always strong in wild mothers.  For several days after taking up his abode =
in the mountains, Black=20

Bruin contented himself with a vegetarian diet, varied with fish and small =
game, but the blood-lust=20

soon came upon him and he began prowling about the settlements.  At first, =
his reconnoitering=20

was unsuccessful; but one day he discovered an animal four or five times as=
 large as a deer,=20

feeding in an open field near the woods.  This would not have interested hi=
m much had not the=20

distinguished man, and the alliance is of the happiest. Never was such mutu=
al devotion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am not=20

surprised,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, wonderfully relieved.  =E2=80=9CHer siste=
r Euphrosyne is in the room,=E2=80=9D continued=20

Mrs. Giles, =E2=80=9Cthe most extraordinary resemblance to her. There is ju=
st the difference between the=20

matron and the maiden; that is all. They are nearly of the same age, and be=
fore the marriage=20

might have been mistaken for each other. The most charming thing in the wor=
ld is to hear the two=20

sisters sing together. I hope they may to-night. I know the family very wel=
l. It was Mrs.=20

Cantacuzene who introduced me to Theodora. You know it is quite en r=C3=A8g=
le to call her Theodora.=20

All the men call her Theodora; =E2=80=98the divine Theodora=E2=80=99 is, I =
believe, the right thing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd do you call=20

her Theodora?=E2=80=9D asked Lothair, rather dryly.  =E2=80=9CWhy, no,=E2=
=80=9D said Mrs. Giles, a little confused. =E2=80=9CWe are=20

not intimate, at least not very, Ms. Campian has been at my house, and I ha=
ve been here two et=20

three times; not so often as I could wish, for Mr. Giles, you see, does not=
 like servants and horses=20

to be used on Sundays=E2=80=94and no more do I=E2=80=94and on weekdays he i=
s too much engaged or too tired=20

to come out this distance; so you see=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  The singing had ce=
ased, and Theodora approached=20

them. Addressing Lothair, she said: =E2=80=9CThe Princess of Tivoli wishes =
that you should be presented to=20

her.=E2=80=9D  The Princess of Tivoli was a Roman dame of one of the most i=
llustrious houses, but who=20

now lived at Paris. She had in her time taken an active part in Italian pol=
itics, and had sacrificed to=20

the cause to which she was devoted the larger part of a large fortune. What=
 had been spared,=20

however, permitted her to live in the French capital with elegance, if not =
with splendor; and her=20

saloon was the gathering roof, in Paris, of almost every one who was celebr=
ated for genius or=20

accomplishments. Though reputed to be haughty and capricious, she entertain=
ed for Theodora an=20

even passionate friendship, and now visited England only to see her.  =E2=
=80=9CMadame Campian has=20

been telling me of all the kind things you did for her at Oxford,=E2=80=9D =
said the princess. =E2=80=9CSome day you=20

must show me Oxford, but it must be next year. I very much admire the free =
university life. Tell me=20

now, at Oxford you still have the Protestant religion?=E2=80=9D  Lothair ve=
ntured to bow assent.  =E2=80=9CAh! that is=20

well,=E2=80=9D continued the princess. =E2=80=9CI advise you to keep it. If=
 we had only had the Protestant religion in=20

Italy, things would have been very different. You are fortunate in this cou=
ntry in having the=20

Protestant religion and a real nobility. Tell me now, in your constitution,=
 if the father sits in the=20



Upper Chamber, the son sits in the Lower House=E2=80=94that I know; but is =
there any majorat at=20

attached to his seat?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot at present.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CYou sit in the Lower House, of course?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am not old=
=20

enough to sit in either House,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut when I a=
m of age, which I shall be when I have=20

the honor of showing Oxford to your highness, I must sit in the Upper House=
, for I have not the=20

blessing of a living father.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh! that is a great thing i=
n your country,=E2=80=9D exclaimed the princess, =E2=80=9Ca=20

man being his own master at so early an age.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI thought i=
t was a =E2=80=98heritage of woe,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D said Lothair.=20

=E2=80=9CNo, no,=E2=80=9D said the princess; =E2=80=9Cthe only tolerable th=
ing in life is action, and action is feeble without=20

youth. What if you do not obtain your immediate object?=E2=80=94you always =
think you will, and the detail=20

of the adventure is full of rapture. And thus it is the blunders of youth a=
re preferable to the=20

triumphs of manhood, or the successes of old age.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, =
it will be a consolation for me to=20

remember this when I am in a scrape,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9COh! y=
ou have many, many scrapes awaiting=20

you,=E2=80=9D said the princess. =E2=80=9CYou may look forward to at least =
ten years of blunders=E2=80=94that is,=20

illusions=E2=80=94that is, happiness. Fortunate young man!=E2=80=9D  Theodo=
ra had, without appearing to intend it,=20

relinquished her seat to Lothair, who continued his conversation with the p=
rincess, whom he liked,=20

but who, he was sorry to hear, was about to leave England, and immediately=
=E2=80=94that very night.=20

=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cit is my last act of devotion. Yo=
u know, in my country we have saints and shrines.=20

All Italians, they say, are fond, are superstitious; my pilgrimage is to Th=
eodora. I must come and=20

worship her once a year.=E2=80=9D  A gentleman bowed lowly to the princess,=
 who returned his salute with=20

pleased alacrity. =E2=80=9CDo you know who that is?=E2=80=9D said the princ=
ess to Lothair. =E2=80=9CThat is Baron Gozelius,=20

one of our great reputations. He must have just arrived. I will present you=
 to him; it is always=20

agreeable to know a great man,=E2=80=9D she added=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cat least=
 Goethe says so!=E2=80=9D  The philosopher, at her=20

invitation, took a chair opposite the sofa. Though a profound man, he had a=
ll the vivacity and=20

passion which are generally supposed to be peculiar to the superficial. He =
had remarkable=20

conversational power, which he never spared. Lothair was captivated by his =
eloquence, his=20

striking observations, his warmth, and the flashing of his southern eye.  =
=E2=80=9CBaron Gozelius agrees=20

with your celebrated pastor, Dr. Cumming,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, with a ti=
nge of demure sarcasm, =E2=80=9Cand=20

believes that the end of the world is at hand.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd for t=
he same reasons?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair.  =E2=80=9CNot=20

exactly,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cbut in this instance science and =
revelation have arrived at the same=20

result, and that is what all desire.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll that I said was=
,=E2=80=9D said Gozelius, =E2=80=9Cthat the action of the sun=20

had become so irregular that I thought the chances were in favor of the des=
truction=20


_
kind.  He never would have thought of attacking the mother, but the calf wa=
s easily within his=20

scope and he began shadowing them with the persistence of a good hunter.  B=
lack Bruin knew=20

that these creatures were the property of men.  He had often watched the ca=
ttle feeding when he=20

lived near the scene of the great bear-hunt, but with the exception of the =
calf he had killed upon=20

that eventful morning, he had never molested them.  Even now, he associated=
 the killing of the calf=20

with the baying of hounds and danger, but he was now much wiser and stronge=
r.  He felt that he=20

could get away to the mountains long before men would discover their loss. =
 He could even fight if=20

need be.  Of all the bears in the region he was easily the strongest and he=
aviest and his life with=20

White Nose the fall before had taught him many things.  One morning the you=
ng heifer hid her little=20

red calf in a thicket just as the doe had her fawn and went to feed in the =
open near by.  This was=20

Black Bruin's opportunity, and swift and sure like the good hunter he had n=
ow become, he=20

approached.  The deer mother had not offered to attack him and he did not t=
hink this one would,=20

so he did not pay much attention to her.  He crept as near as he could with=
out scaring the game=20

and then with a swift pounce was upon it.  He struck the calf a blow that s=
hould have broken its=20

neck, but the calf moved at just the critical moment and received a glancin=
g stroke.  With a bleat of=20

pain and fear it sprang up and fled toward its mother.  It took only two ju=
mps, for a second blow=20

laid it low, with just enough life left to kick.  Black Bruin seized the pr=
ize by the head and began=20

dragging it into the bushes.  But he had not gone far when the heifer was u=
pon him like a=20

whirlwind.  He aimed a blow at her head which deprived her of one horn, but=
 this did not stop her=20

charge.  She caught him fairly in the chest and sent him sprawling.  Her re=
maining horn ploughed=20

a deep wound in his shoulder and the force of the contact knocked the breat=
h out of him, but it=20

also aroused his fighting blood and put him upon his guard.  When the heife=
r came for him the=20

second time, he ripped open her nose and eluded her charge, but in no way d=
ampened her=20

fighting ardor.  Ordinarily she would have fled from the bear like the wind=
, but her maternal=20

affection had been aroused and wounded and no matter how timid the wild mot=
her, it will usually=20

fight desperately when its young are assailed.  Now that the bear was upon =
his guard, the not=20

insure it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYet the risk would not be very great under th=
ose circumstances,=E2=80=9D said Theodora.  =E2=80=9CThe=20

destruction of this worlds foretold,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cthe st=
ars are to fall from the sky; but while I credit,=20

I cannot bring my mind to comprehend, such a catastrophe.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CI have seen a world created and a=20

world destroyed,=E2=80=9D said Gozelius. =E2=80=9CThe last was flickering t=
en years, and it went out as I was=20

watching it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd the first?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair, a=
nxiously.  =E2=80=9CDisturbed space for half a century=E2=80=94a=20

great pregnancy. William Herschel told me it would come when I was a boy, a=
nd I cruised for it=20

through two-thirds of my life. It came at last, and it repaid me.=E2=80=9D =
 There was a stir. Euphrosyne was=20

going to sing with her sister. They swept by Lothair in their progress to t=
he instrument, like the=20

passage of sultanas to some kiosk on the Bosporus. It seemed to him that he=
 had never beheld=20

any thing so resplendent. The air was perfumed by their movement and the ru=
stling of their=20

wondrous robes. =E2=80=9CThey must be of the Aryan race,=E2=80=9D thought L=
othair, =E2=80=9Cthough not of the Phidian=20

type.=E2=80=9D They sang a Greek air, and their sweet and touching voices b=
lended with exquisite=20

harmony. Every one was silent in the room, because every one was entranced.=
 Then they gave=20

their friends some patriotic lay which required chorus, the sisters, in tur=
n, singing a stanza. Mr.=20

Phoebus arranged the chorus in a moment, and there clustered round the pian=
o al number of=20

gentlemen almost as good-looking and as picturesque as himself. Then, while=
 Madame Phoebus=20



was singing, Euphrosyne suddenly, and with quickness, moved away and approa=
ched Theodora,=20

and whispered something to her, but Theodora slightly shook her head, and s=
eemed to decline.=20

Euphrosyne regained the piano, whispered something to Colonel Campian, who =
was one of the=20

chorus, and then commenced her own part. Colonel Campian crossed the room a=
nd spoke to=20

Theodora, who instantly, without the slightest demur, joined her friends. L=
othair felt agitated, as he=20

could not doubt Theodora was going to sing. And so it was; when Euphrosyne =
had finished, and=20

the chorus she had inspired had died away, there rose a deep contralto soun=
d, which, though=20

without effort, seemed to Lothair the most thrilling tone he had ever liste=
ned to. Deeper and richer,=20

and richer and deeper, it seemed to become, as it wound with exquisite faci=
lity through a=20

symphony of delicious sound, until it ended in a passionate burst, which ma=
de Lothair=E2=80=99s heart beat=20

so tumultuously that for=20


_
him, for he could usually elude her charges and punish her sorely at each r=
ush; but one thing was=20

certain: It would be no easy matter to carry off the dead calf, and carry o=
n such a fight as this at=20

the same time.  In five minutes the cow was covered with blood and her hide=
 had been deeply=20

lacerated in many places, while Black Bruin still had but one wound, that i=
n his shoulder.  Little by=20

little the heifer's frenzy was worn out, until at last she retired to a dis=
tance and pawed the ground=20

and bellowed.  But when Black Bruin sought to carry off the calf, she was b=
ack again fighting every=20

inch of the ground and often causing him to abandon the carcass for a time.=
  When she stood over=20

the dead calf, licking the blood from its wounds and caressing and nosing i=
t, trying in her dumb=20

way to bring it back to life, she was a pathetic picture of wild motherhood=
, fighting and ready to=20

fight to the end if need be for its offspring.  Finally toward night she se=
emed to understand that the=20

calf was dead and no longer of value to her, so, after driving Black Bruin =
far from the spot, she=20

abandoned the fight and left him conqueror and in full possession of the fi=
eld.  When he had made=20

sure that she had returned to the pasture, he dragged the calf far up the m=
ountainside into his=20

fastness and gorged upon it as long as it lasted.  As the pasture in which =
Black Bruin had=20

committed his depredation was a mile from the settler's house and not often=
 visited except to salt=20

the young stock kept in it, the real offender was not discovered, although =
it was apparent to the=20

farmer that the heifer had been attacked by some wild beast.  The rains, ho=
wever, had so=20

obliterated the signs that it is doubtful if he could have read them rightl=
y, even had he discovered=20

the scene of the battle.  About a week later Black Bruin was climbing the m=
ountainside on the way=20

to his fastness when the wind brought him a new scent that he had sometimes=
 smelled before, but=20

what to attribute it to he had never known.  The scent was very strong and =
Black Bruin knew that=20

the intruder of his domain was near at hand.  At last he made out a dim gra=
y shape, near the trunk=20

of a tree.  Its color so blended with its surroundings that he might not ha=
ve noticed it at all, had it=20

not been for two yellow phosphorus eyes that glowed full at him.  The creat=
ure was about the size=20

of a large raccoon, but it was no raccoon.  Its head was large and round, a=
nd surmounted by long=20

ears with hairy tassels at the end.  Its forearm was longer and stronger th=
an that of a raccoon and=20

the tail was short and not much of an ornament.  Whatever the animal was, i=
t was small and=20

possibly good to eat, so Black Bruin made a rush at it; but quick as he was=
, he was not half as=20

quick as the lynx, which with a snarl and a spit scratched up the tree in a=
 manner that made the=20

bear's own accomplishments at tree-climbing look mean indeed.  So the stran=
ger could climb=20

trees?  Well, so could Black Bruin.  Up he scratched after it.  He would fo=
llow it to the top and then=20

bat it off with his paw.  When the cat had nearly reached the top of the tr=
ee, it turned around and=20

looked back.  Its enemy was close upon it and something heroic must be done=
.  The cat measured=20

the  =E2=80=9CI never heard any thing so fine in my life,=E2=80=9D said Lot=
hair to the French philosopher.  =E2=80=9CAh! if you=20

had heard that woman sing the Marseillaise, as I did once, to three thousan=
d people, then you=20

would know what was fine. Not one of us who would not have died on the spot=
 for her!=E2=80=9D  The=20

concert was over. The Princess of Tivoli had risen to say farewell. She sto=
od apart with Theodora,=20

holding both her hands, and speaking with earnestness. Then she pressed her=
 lips to Theodora=E2=80=99s=20

forehead, and said, =E2=80=9CAdieu, my best beloved; the spring will return=
.=E2=80=9D  The princess had=20

disappeared, and Madame Phoebus came up to say good-night to her hostess.  =
=E2=80=9CIt is such a=20

delicious night,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cthat I have ordered our s=
trawberries-and-cream on the terrace.=20

You must not go.=E2=80=9D  And so she invited them all to the terrace. Ther=
e was not a breath of air, the=20



garden was flooded with moonlight, in which the fountain glittered, and the=
 atmosphere was as=20

sweet as it was warm.  =E2=80=9CI think the moon will melt the ice to-night=
,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, as she led=20

Madame Phoebus to a table covered with that innocent refreshment in many fo=
rms, and pyramids=20

of strawberries, and gentle drinks which the fancy of America could alone d=
evise.  =E2=80=9CI wonder we=20

did not pass the whole evening on the terrace,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=
=80=9COne must sing in a room,=E2=80=9D said=20

Euphrosyne, =E2=80=9Cor the nightingales would eclipse us.=E2=80=9D  Lothai=
r looked quickly at the speaker, and=20

caught the glance of a peculiar countenance=E2=80=94mockery blended with Io=
nian splendor.  =E2=80=9CI think=20

strawberries-and-cream the most popular of all food,=E2=80=9D said Madame P=
hoebus, as some touched=20

her beautiful lips.  =E2=80=9CYes; and one is not ashamed of eating it,=E2=
=80=9D said Theodora.  Soon there was that=20

stir which precedes the breaking up of an assembly. Mrs. Giles and some oth=
ers had to return to=20

town. Madame Phoebus and Euphrosyne were near neighbors at Roehampton, but =
their carriage=20

had been for some time waiting. Mr. Phoebus did not accompany them. He chos=
e to walk home=20

on such a night, and descended into the garden with his remaining friends. =
 =E2=80=9CThey are going to=20

smoke,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CIs it your habit?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CNot yet.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not dislike it in the air and at a dist=
ance;=20

but I banish them the terrace. I think smoking must be a great consolation =
to a soldier;=E2=80=9D and, as=20

she spoke, she moved, and, without formally inviting him, he found himself =
walking by her side.=20

Rather abruptly he said, =E2=80=9CYou wore last night at the opera the same=
 ornament as on the first time I=20

had the pleasure meeting you.=E2=80=9D  She looked at him with a smile, and=
 a little surprised. =E2=80=9CMy solitary=20

trinket; I fear you will never see any other.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut you do=
 not despise trinkets?=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9COh=20

no; they are very well. Once I was decked with jewels and ropes of pearls, =
like Titian=E2=80=99s Queen of=20

Cyprus. I sometimes regret my pearls. There is a reserve about pearls which=
 I like=E2=80=94something=20

soft and dim. But they are all gone, and I ought not to regret them, for th=
ey went in a good cause. I=20

kept the star, because it was given to me by a hero; and once we flattered =
ourselves it was a=20

symbol.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wish I were a hero!=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =
=E2=80=9CYou may yet prove one.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd if I do, may I give=
=20

you a star?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf it be symbolical.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut =
of what?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf=20


_
down the mountainside; then the top of the tree in which it squatted sprang=
 back and the gray form=20

shot through the air and alighted gracefully in the distant tree-top.  It w=
as a great jump, and so=20

astonished Black Bruin that he forgot to be furious at seeing his game esca=
pe.  This was his first=20

experience with a Canadian lynx, but he saw them often, once he had learned=
 their ways.  He=20

discovered that they too were fishermen, and hunters of small game.  He oft=
en found them hunting=20

upon his preserves, but their broad paws fell so lightly upon the forest ca=
rpet and their gray forms=20

were so unobtrusive in the woods that he did not often come to close quarte=
rs with them.  A few=20

days later, one  =E2=80=9CBut what is an heroic purpose?=E2=80=9D exclaimed=
 Lothair. =E2=80=9CInstead of being here to-

night, I ought, perhaps, to have been present at a religious function of th=
e highest and deepest=20

import, which might have influenced my destiny, and led to something heroic=
. But my mind is=20

uncertain and unsettled. I speak to you without reserve, for my heart alway=
s entirely opens to you,=20

and I have a sort of unlimited confidence in your judgment. Besides, I have=
 never forgotten what=20

you said at Oxford about religion=E2=80=94that you could not conceive socie=
ty without religion. It is what I=20

feel myself, and most strongly; and yet there never was a period when relig=
ion was so assailed.=20

There is no doubt the atheists are bolder,=20
