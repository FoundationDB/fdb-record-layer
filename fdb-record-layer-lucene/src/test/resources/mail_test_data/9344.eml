the whole party went on to the main camp, Will riding behind Jack, for the =
latter's horse would=20

carry double.  "My, but you certainly are doing this up in style," remarked=
 the ragged lad as he saw=20

the fine tents and noted how comfortably Jack and his chums lived, in spite=
 of the fact that they=20

were far from civilization. His arrival created quite a sensation.  "Oh, wh=
en Jack Ranger does a=20

thing, it's done good and proper," said Bony. "It's the first outing out of=
 the gun club, and he wants=20

to make a record, I guess."  "I want you all to have a good time, that's al=
l I want," was Jack's reply.=20

Some better clothes were found for Will, and after a good meal some of the =
hopelessness faded=20

from his face. He told of his wanderings in the mountains, and how he had w=
orked his way from=20

camp to camp, and from stage station to stage station.  "But you're done tr=
amping around now,"=20

said Jack.  "Have you--have you got room for me here?" faltered Will.  "Hav=
e we? Well, I guess!"=20

was Jack's hearty answer. "You can stay here as long as you like, or until =
you find your uncle.=20

You've accepted my invitation to come camping, after all, and I guess your =
guardian would be=20

surprised if he could see you now."  "I guess he would," remarked Will with=
 a smile.  There was=20

plenty of room in the big sleeping tent, and a bed was made up for the wand=
erer. It was the first=20

good night's rest he had of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the pre=
cious life. Can a man=20

take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot =
coals, and his feet not=20

be burned? So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whosoever toucheth h=
er shall not be=20

innocent. . . . Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understandin=
g: he that doeth it=20

destroyeth his own soul. A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproac=
h shall not be wiped=20

away. . . . Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom =
of God? Be not deceived:=20

neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themsel=
ves with mankind shall=20

inherit the kingdom of God. . . . But fornication, and all uncleanness, let=
 it not be once named=20

among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor=
 jesting, which are not=20

convenient: but rather giving thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger=
, nor unclean person=20

hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceiv=
e you with vain words:=20

for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di=
sobedience. Be not ye=20

therefore partakers with them. . . . Whoremongers shall have their part in =
the lake which burneth=20

with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. . . . For without are w=
horemongers. . . ."  These=20

are a few of the threatenings and warnings contained=20

nearly a week, he said.  As they had plenty of fresh meat in camp they did =
not go hunting for=20

several days, but Jack and his chums could not remain inactive, so they all=
, including Will, went on=20

short jaunts about the camp. A gun was provided for the newcomer, and he pr=
oved that he was a=20

good shot, at least on jack-rabbits, which abounded in that region.  About =
a week after Will had=20

joined his former chums they went on an all-day hunt. The luck fell to Bony=
 and Sam this trip, for=20

each of them killed a fine mountain ram, the horns of which were equal in s=
ize to the one slain by=20

Jack.  Nat Book, up to its closing chapter. It speaks plainly, without comp=
romise.  MARRIAGE=20

AND THE HOME.  This commandment is God's bulwark around marriage and the ho=
me. Marriage=20

is one of the institutions that existed in Eden; it is older than the fall.=
 It is the most sacred=20

relationship that can exist between human beings, taking precedence even of=
 the relationship of=20

the parent and child. Some one has pointed out that as in the beginning God=
 created one man and=20

one woman, this is the true order for all ages. Where family ties are disre=
garded and dishonored,=20

the results are always fatal. The home=20
