the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of m=

membrance in his treatises. Secondly, he must have a I'm told, appointed a =

principles of proportion.  2. It follows, therefore, that architects who ha=
ve aimed at acquiring=20

manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position o=
f authority to=20

correspond to their pains, while those who relied only upon theories and sc=
holarship were=20

obviously hunting the shadow, not the substance. But those who have a thoro=
ugh knowledge of=20

nd carried authority with=20

them.  3. In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are these=
 two points:--the thing=20

signified, and that which gives it its significance. That which is signifie=
d is the subject of which we=20

may be speaking; and that which gives significance is a demonstration on sc=
ientific principles. It=20

appears, then, that one who professes himself an architect should be well v=
ersed in both=20

directions. He ought, therefore, to be both naturally gifted and amenable t=
o instruction. Neither=20

natural ability without instruction nor instruction without "Well, as I was=
 sayin', there's another class=20

o' men, not so bad as the first, but bad enough, who are indooced to go in =
for this crime of fire-

raisin'--arson they calls it, but why so is beyond me to diskiver. A needy =
tradesman, for instance,=20

when at his wits'-end for money, can't help thinkin' that a lucky spark wou=
ld put him all right."  "But=20

how could the burning of his goods put him all right?" demanded Mary.  "W'y=
, 'e don't want goods,=20

you know, 'e wants to sell 'is goods an' so git _money_; but nobody will bu=

money, yet money must be 'ad, for creditors won't wait.  Wot then?  All the=
 goods are insured=20
