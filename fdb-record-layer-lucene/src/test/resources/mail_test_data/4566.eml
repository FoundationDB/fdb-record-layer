CATARACT.  WITHOUT troubling the public with a description of that portion =
of the Nile to the=20

north of the first cataract, or with a detailed account of the Egyptian rui=
ns, that have been visited=20

by a thousand tourists, I will commence by a few extracts from my journal, =
written at the close of=20

the boat voyage from Cairo :--  "May 8, 1861.--No air. The thermometer 104 =
degrees Fahr.; a=20

stifling heat. Becalmed, we have been lying the entire day below the ruins =
of Philae. These are the=20

most imposing monuments of the Nile, owing to their peculiar situation upon=
 a rocky island that=20

commands the passage of the river above the cataract. The banks of the stre=
am are here=20

hemmed in by ranges of hills from 100 to 250 feet high; these are entirely =
destitute of soil, being=20

composed of enormous masses of red granite, piled block upon block, the rud=
e masonry of Nature=20

that has walled in the river. The hollows between the hills are choked with=
 a yellow sand, which,=20

drifted by the wind, has, in many difficult not to be interested by the ing=
enious fancy by which it=20

was worked out, that every thing that was true and sacred in heaven had its=
 symbol and=20

significance in the qualities and accidents of earth.  After a month passed=
 in this manner, the=20

surgeons having announced that Lothair might now prepare to rise from his b=
ed, a veiled=20

attendant said to him one day, =E2=80=9CThere is a gentleman here who is a =
friend of yours, and who would=20

like to see you. And perhaps you would like to see him also for other reaso=
ns, for you must have=20

much to say to God after all that you have suffered. And he is a most holy =
man.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have no wish=20

to see any one. Are you sure he is not a stranger?=E2=80=9D asked Lothair. =
 =E2=80=9CHe is in the next room,=E2=80=9D said=20

the attendant. =E2=80=9CHe has been here throughout your illness, conductin=
g our services; often by your=20

bedside when you were asleep, and always praying for you.=E2=80=9D  The vei=
led attendant drew back and=20

waved her hand, and some one glided forward, and said in a low, soft voice,=
 =E2=80=9CYou have not=20

forgotten me?=E2=80=9D  And Lothair beheld Monsignore Catesby.  =E2=80=9CIt=
 is a long time since we met,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, looking at him with some scrutiny, and then all interest died away=
, and he turned away his=20

vague and wandering eyes.  =E2=80=9CBut you know me?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI k=
now not where I am, and I but faintly=20

comprehend what has happened,=E2=80=9D murmured Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYou are =
among friends,=E2=80=9D said the=20

monsignore, in tones of sympathy. =E2=80=9CWhat has happened,=E2=80=9D he a=
dded, with an air of mystery, not=20

unmixed with a certain expression of ecstasy in his glance, =E2=80=9Cmust b=
e reserved for other times,=20

when you are stronger, and can grapple with such high themes.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CHow long have I been here?=E2=80=9D=20

inquired Lothair, dreamily.  =E2=80=9CIt is a month since the Annunciation.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat Annunciation?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHush!=E2=80=9D=20



said the monsignore, and he raised his finger to his lip. =E2=80=9CWe must =
not talk of these things=E2=80=94at least=20

at present. No doubt, the same blessed person that saved you from the jaws =
of death is at this=20

moment guarding over your recovery and guiding it; but we do not deserve, n=
or does the Church=20

expect, perpetual miracles. We must avail ourselves, under Divine sanction,=
 of the beneficent=20

tendencies of Nature; and in your case her=20


_
filled the narrow valleys. Upon either side of the Nile are vestiges of anc=
ient forts. The land=20

appears as though it bore the curse of Heaven; misery, barrenness, and the =
heat of a furnace are=20

its features. The glowing rocks, devoid of a trace of vegetation, reflect t=
he sun with an intensity=20

that must be felt to be understood. The miserable people who dwell in villa=
ges upon the river's=20

banks snatch every sandbank from the retiring stream, and immediately plant=
 their scanty garden=20

with melons, gourds, lentils, &c. this being their only resource for cultiv=
ation. Not an inch of=20

available soil is lost; but day by day, as the river decreases, fresh rows =
of vegetables are sown=20

upon the newly-acquired land. At Assouan, the sandbanks are purely sand bro=
ught down by the=20

cataracts, therefore soil must be added to enable the people to cultivate. =
They dig earth from the=20

ruins of the ancient town; this they boat across the river and spread upon =
the sandbank, by which=20

excessive labour they secure sufficient mould to support their crops.  In t=
he vicinity of Philae the=20

very barrenness of the scenery possesses a charm. The iron-like sterility o=
f the granite rocks,=20

naked except in spots where the wind has sheeted them with sand; the groves=
 of palms springing=20

unexpectedly into view in this desert wilderness, as a sudden bend of the r=
iver discovers a village;=20

the ever blue and never clouded sky above, and, the only blessing of this b=
lighted land, the Nile,=20

silently flowing between its stern walls of rocks towards the distant land =
of Lower Egypt, form a=20

total that produces a scene to be met with nowhere but upon the Nile. In th=
is miserable spot the=20

unfortunate inhabitants are taxed equally with those of the richer district=
s--about fivepence=20

annually for each date palm.  "May 9.--A good breeze, but excitement, excep=
t, indeed, the glow of=20

gratitude for celestial aid, and the inward joy which must permeate the bei=
ng of any one who feels=20

that he is among the most favored of men.=E2=80=9D  From this time Monsigno=
re Catesby scarcely ever=20

quitted Lothair. He hailed Lothair in the morn, and parted from him at nigh=
t with a blessing; and in=20

the interval Catesby devoted his whole life, and the inexhaustible resource=
s of his fine and skilled=20

intelligence, to alleviate or amuse the existence of his companion. Sometim=
es he conversed with=20

Lothair, adroitly taking the chief burden of the talk; and yet, whether it =
were bright narrative or=20

lively dissertation, never seeming to lecture or hold forth, but relieving =
the monologue, when=20

expedient, by an interesting inquiry, which he was always ready in due time=
 to answer himself, or=20

softening the instruction by the playfulness of his mind and manner. Someti=
mes he read to Lothair,=20

and attuned the mind of his charge to the true spiritual note by melting pa=
ssages from Kempis or=20

Chrysostom. Then he would bring a portfolio of wondrous drawings by the med=
iaeval masters, of=20

saints and seraphs, and accustom the eye and thought of Lothair to the form=
s and fancies of the=20

court of heaven.  One day, Lothair, having risen from his bed for the first=
 time, and lying on a sofa=20

in an adjoining chamber to that in which he had been so long confined, the =
monsignore seated=20

himself by the side of Lothair, and, opening a portfolio, took out a drawin=
g and held it before=20

Lothair, observing his countenance with a glance of peculiar scrutiny.  =E2=
=80=9CWell!=E2=80=9D said Catesby, after=20

some little pause, as if awaiting a remark from his companion.  =E2=80=9C=
=E2=80=98Tis beautiful!=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CIs it=20

by Raffaelle?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo; by Fra Bartolomeo. But the countenance=
, do you remember ever having met=20

such a one?=E2=80=9D=20


_
and the curtains of the cabin are continually wetted, and the Venetian blin=
ds are closed, the=20

thermometer, at 4 P.M., stood at 105 degrees in the shade; and upon deck, 1=
37 degrees in the=20

sun. This day we passed the ruins of several small temples. The country is =
generally rocky, with=20

intervals of ten or twelve miles of desert plains.  "May 10.--Fine breeze, =
the boat sailing well.=20

Passed several small temples. The henna grows in considerable quantities on=
 the left bank of the=20

river. The leaf resembles that of the myrtle; the blossom has a powerful fr=
agrance; it grows like a=20

feather, about eighteen inches long, forming a cluster of small yellow flow=
ers. The day pleasantly=20

cool; thermometer, 95 degrees.  "May 11.--At 5 A.M. we arrived at Korosko; =
lat. 22 degrees 50=20

minutes N.; the halting-place for subject, the Blessed Virgin. =E2=80=9CBy =
Giulio,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore, and=20

he watched the face of Lothair, but it was listless.  Then he showed Lothai=
r another, and another,=20

and another. At last he held before him one which was really by Raffaelle, =
and by which Lothair=20

was evidently much moved. His eye lit up, a blush suffused his pale cheek, =
he took the drawing=20

himself, and held it before his gaze with a trembling hand.  =E2=80=9CYes I=
 remember this,=E2=80=9D he murmured,=20

for it was one of those faces of Greek beauty which the great painter not i=
nfrequently caught up at=20

Rome. The monsignore looked gently round and waved his hand, and immediatel=
y arose the=20

hymn to the Virgin in subdued strains of exquisite melody.  On the next mor=
ning, when Lothair=20

woke, he found on the table, by his side, the drawing of the Virgin in a=20
