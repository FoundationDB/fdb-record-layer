philodendron monstera his mother. And no one can take a mother's place, wit=
h a boy like that. No one could understand him, and make allowances for him=
, and explain things to him, as his own mother could. I've been thinking ab=
out that, all afternoon as I ironed his waists and his blue flannellet paja=
mas with frogs on like his dad's. And I've been thinking of it all evening =
as I patched his brown corduroy knickers and darned his little stockings an=
d balled them up in a neat little row. I saviour appeared. On May 10th, in =
the eventful year 1860, the Republican State Convention of Illinois, by acc=
lamation, and amidst great enthusiasm, nominated Lincoln for the Presidency=
. One who saw him receive the nomination says, "I then thought him one of t=
he most diffident and most plagued of men I ever saw." We may depend upon i=
t, however, that his diffidence of manner was accompanied by no reluctance =
of heart. The splendid prize which he had won had been the philodendron mon=

suggesting that we send Elmer through to him, to go to school in the East. =
He says the boy can=20

attend Montclair Academy, that he can be taken there and called for every d=

Fisher, in the cabriolet, and that on Sunday he can be toted regularly to S=
t. Luke's Episcopal=20

Church, and occasionally go into New York for some of the better concerts, =
and even have a=20

governess of his own, if he'd care for it. And in case I should be quietly =
made the pledge, and they=20

voted for him." He came out, however, square enough, and in the very nick o=
f time with his "house=20

divided against itself" speech, which took the wind out of the sails of Sew=
ard with his "irrepressible=20

conflict." Douglas, whom Lincoln regarded with intense personal rivalry, wa=

of astute interrogations, the answers to which hopelessly embroiled him wit=

condition and the activities of the child," as the letter expresses it. It =
sounds very appealing, but=20

mother. He'd come back to me a stranger. He'd come back a little ashamed of=
