PROPER TO LITERATURE      187     PREFACE   The following chapters were fir=
st published=20

serially in _The North American Review_, from November, 1922, to March, 192=
3. For their=20

reappearance in this volume I have made slight changes in them all, and hav=
e inserted in the=20

fourth chapter a few paragraphs written for _The Bookman_ of July, 1922. Th=
e editors of both=20

magazines have my thanks for permission to reprint.  The title of the book =
will disclose at once the=20

critical theory underlying these essays; they are studies in the discipline=
 which literature imposes=20

on those who cultivate it as an art, and their doctrine is that language as=
 a medium of expression=20

has certain limitations which the writer must respect, and that the psychol=
ogy of his audience limits=20

him also in what he may say, if he would gain a wide hearing and keep it. T=
o know what can be=20

said in words, and what effect it will have on your readers, is the inward =
art of writing, much more=20

important even than the management of a sentence or the shaping of a paragr=
aph.  I write here of=20

literature as an art. Since I mean to exclude, as not art, many books of un=
doubted importance and=20

of wide appeal, I must attempt at least to defend a distinction that to cer=
tain readers will seem=20

arbitrary. A book may tell us of a life we already know about, or of a life=
 we as yet do not know; the=20

pleasure it gives us will be of recognition or of curiosity satisfied. Of c=
ourse no books fall=20

absolutely into one or the other of such extremes, but it is fairly accurat=
e to say that every=20

successful book does give us information, a new experience, or brings back =
an old experience to=20

recognize. Though both kinds of books may be equally well written, we are i=
nclined to ask only=20

instruction from the one kind, but permanent enjoyment from the other. One =
is a document in=20

history or sociology, in ethics or psychology; the other, as I understand i=
t, is a work of art. If our=20

country has not proved a favorable birth-place for literary works of art, t=
he reason probably lies in=20



our history rather than in lack of able writers. Ours has always been, and =
still is, an unknown land;=20

the reader of American works has primarily been looking for information abo=
ut America. The early=20

visitors from Europe wrote us up for the enlightenment of their friends at =
home, and since our=20

world has changed rapidly, we still write up ourselves, for our own enlight=
enment. The too brief=20

flourishing of literature as an art in New England was possible only becaus=
e life there for one=20

moment in our history was so stable that a considerable body of readers had=
 much experience in=20

common; having had their curiosity satisfied as to their own life, they cou=
ld recognize it and reflect=20

upon the literary portrait of it. But the New England moment in our literat=
ure proved an exception,=20

and we are so accustomed now to read novels and poems, not as art, but as b=
ulletins of=20

information from the west, the northwest, the middle west or the south, tha=
t we are losing the=20

sense of living art in the New England writers themselves, and are consider=
ing them more and=20

more as documents in a past civilization. Since we have so great need of do=
cuments, I realize that=20

I prejudice myself with many readers when I say that my chief interest is i=
n literature as art=E2=80=94in the=20

books which reflect the unchanging aspects of human experience, rather than=
 in the reports of our=20

temporary condition.  If literature in our country has suffered from our pa=
ssion for information, I=20

believe it has also been damaged in our day by a bad philosophy of esthetic=
s which has=20

encouraged the writer to think much of himself and little of his audience. =
Literature is an art of=20

expression, we say in the old phrase, and it expresses life. But whose life=
? The writer=E2=80=99s, of course,=20

replies the philosophy I happen not to like. No; if a book ever becomes fam=
ous, it is because it=20

expresses the experience of the reader. The writer=E2=80=99s personality wi=
ll pervade it, but we must be=20

able to recognize ourselves in it before we can admit that it portrays life=
 truly.  The function of=20

criticism, as I understand it, is to discover, in the past experience of th=
e race, what books have=20

won a secure place in men=E2=80=99s affections, and to find out if possible=
 why men have been=20

permanently fond of them. A great critic would be a scientist, observing th=
e behavior of the reader=20

in the presence of certain stories or poems, and recording the kind of effe=
ct produced by various=20

arrangements of character and plot, or by different employments of language=
. Such a critic was=20

Aristotle in the _Poetics_. The art of literature has never had an observer=
 more accurate or more=20

penetrating, and those who return constantly to his wise pages will underst=
and why I have quoted=20

him so often, and often have drawn upon him for aid when I have not used hi=
s name.  I must=20

record my gratitude to two living philosophers also, towers of strength to =
those of us who love=20

books as works of art=E2=80=94George Santayana and Frederick J. E. Woodbrid=
ge. The first has taught=20

me through his books=E2=80=94are any books more beautiful than his written =
in English today? The=20

second has enriched me with his daily companionship and with those spoken w=
ords, grave or gay=20

but always wise, which his friends and disciples learn to save up for remem=
brance.  And I have=20

offered this book in my dedication to our one poet-critic in America who ha=
s spent his genius in the=20

service of literature as art, and as art alone. I do not know whether what =
I have written will be=20

altogether acceptable to him, and if I put his honored name in the forefron=
t of my pages, it is not to=20

shield me from deserved criticism. But writing on this theme, I must bear w=
itness to his leadership=20

among all in this country who in my lifetime have known how to prize the im=
mortal things in great=20

books=E2=80=94imagination, ideal humanity, beauty, and the kind of truth th=
at is beauty. In a day when=20

literary criticism has been contentious and personal, more like a political=
 campaign in a tough ward=20

than anything that Spenser or Sidney or Shelley would recognize as a pilgri=
mage to wisdom, Mr.=20



Woodberry has written nothing ungenerous or harsh of new arrivals less of F=
air Women_ are the=20

greatest examples: the present work itself, indeed, is a record of this nat=
ure. But that which=20

Chaucer and Tennyson treat poetically, imaginatively, with all the art of m=
inds supremely artistic,=20

Christine treats in a rather matter-of-fact way; that is, she is concerned =
to tell such anecdotes of=20

famous women as will support her thesis of the essential nobility of the fe=
minine character. In this=20

way she has accumulated a considerable amount of evidence showing the patie=
nce, the devotion,=20

the fidelity, the heroism of which women are capable under all circumstance=
s of life. The heroines=20

of antiquity are not alone in eliciting Christine's praises; for she devote=
s some attention to the=20

patterns of virtue in her own day, to princesses, and to simple bourgeoises=
, and to one Anastasia,=20

who is of peculiar interest to us because she was a fine illuminator, and m=
ay have been the artist=20

who executed the beautiful illuminations in the manuscripts of Christine's =
own works.  The second=20

of the prose works in behalf of women is the _Livre des Trois Vertus_, or _=
Tresor de la Cite des=20

Dames_, a book of sage counsel to women of all classes and full of informat=
ion most valuable for=20

the historian of manners. It is from this book that one receives the best i=
mpression of the fine=20

moral character and catholicity of view of this woman living a life of hard=
ship and struggle in the=20

dark days of the mad king. She is no prude, but simple and charitable in he=
r conception of the=20

problems of life. Though herself a literary woman, she does not place too g=
reat stress upon=20

learning for her sex: "This woman in love with scholarship intends, to be s=
ure, that woman should=20

acquire learning; but it must be for the purpose of developing her intellig=
ence, of raising her heart=20

to higher things, not of widening her field of ambitions, dethroning man an=
d reigning in his stead."=20

The prodigious activity of this authoress can best be appreciated by refere=
nce to her own=20

statement that, by the year 1405, she had "produced fifteen works of import=
ance, without counting=20

other special little _ditties_, which together fill about seventy sheets of=
 large size." The chief part of=20

her work was already done; for the disturbed condition of the kingdom after=
 the murder of Louis=20

d'Orleans (1407) interrupted her labors. She had thoroughly naturalized her=
self in her adopted=20

country, and this fervent patriot, who grieved that she was helpless to sav=
e France, must have=20

suffered intensely during the dark years that followed. In 1410, she wrote =
a _Lamentation_ upon=20

the horrors of civil war, and two years later, after the overthrow of the c=
ommunist government of=20

Paris, the Cabochiens, she wrote a _Livre de la Paix_, full of harsh but ju=
st criticisms upon those=20

butchers and bakers who would reform the whole world if first allowed to de=
stroy it. Then came the=20

greater sorrows of Agincourt and the English conquest. Christine fled from =
Paris, no longer the=20

home of those princes who had favored her, and found refuge in a convent, p=
robably the convent=20

at Poissy to which her daughter had already retired. It was the breaking up=
 of her little family, her=20

two sons going back to Italy to seek a more favorable field for their peace=
ful talents, and the=20

mother remaining in seclusion for eleven years.  It was probably not long b=
efore her death, of=20

which we do not know the precise date, that the good lady heard in her cloi=
ster the glad news of=20

the coming of the Maid of Orleans and of the consecration of the king at Rh=
eims. All her love for=20

her dear land of France welled up in her heart, and in gladness and wonder =
she sang the _Dittie=20

de Jeanne d'Arc_, the praise of this "girl of sixteen years... before whom =
enemies fly, not one dare=20

stand.... Oh! what honor to our sex! our sex, that God loves, it would seem=
." We cannot better=20

conclude this account of a pure and noble woman--of one who loved her husba=
nd, her children=20

and her country, and who, above all, preserved respect for herself and for =
her womanhood in an=20



evil age--than in the words of her triumphant song of joy which proclaims t=
hat France is saved, and=20

that it is a woman who saves France:          "Chose est bien digne de memo=
ire         Que Dieu par=20

une vierge tendre         Sur France si grand' grace estendre.         Tu J=
ohanne, de bonne heure=20

 fut (elle) envoyee         Au roi=20

pour sa provision;         Son fait n'est pas illusion,         Car bien a =
ete eprouvee....         Par conseil=20

en conclusion         A l'effet la chose est prouvee,         Et sa belle v=
ie, par (ma) foi,         Par quoi=20

(laquelle) on ajoute plus (de) foi         A son fait, quoi qu'elle fasse, =
        Toujours en Dieu devant=20

la face....         Hee! quel honneur au feminin         Sexe! que Dieu l'a=
ime, il appert!"     CHAPTER=20

XII  THE SAVIOR OF FRANCE  _Cettelle ne vient pas de la terre; elle est env=
oyee du ciel._ Thus=20

it is that a contemporary, a great politician and satirist, Alain Chartier,=
 expresses his convictions=20

regarding the Maid of Orleans. To Christine de Pisan, too, she seemed, as w=
e have seen, a=20

messenger from God. It was a time when all good patriots wept, when the fai=
r land of France was=20

a prey to the spoiler, when Armagnac, Bourguignon, and hated Saxon roamed a=
t will over the land=20

and laid it waste. In one of Alain Chartier's political satires, _Le Quadri=
loge invectif_, the three=20

estates of the realm nobles, clergy, commons are in turn appealed to by La =
France, to "have pity=20

of their common mother." The commons, or _Peuple_, replies: "It is the labo=
r of my hands that=20

feeds and clothes these cowardly loafers, and they oppress me with famine a=
nd the sword.... They=20

live upon me, and I am slowly dying under them.... The banners of the host =
are raised, they say,=20

against our enemies, but no deeds are done except against me." It was a com=
plaint but too true,=20

as was that in Chartier's _Livre de I'Esperance_: "The nights are too short=
 for the shameless=20

pleasures (of the gentlemen at court), and the days too short for sleeping.=
... It would seem that=20

noble estate means no more than license to do wrong and yet go unpunished."=
  In this disregard=20

of the moral law as well as of patriotic duties the dauphin himself led the=
 way. One hardly knows=20

what verdict to pass upon this man, for his character was a blend of qualit=
ies that might have=20

made greatness and that yet resulted in nothing but meanness, littleness of=
 soul, and ingratitude.=20

It is not the acid meanness of Louis XI, his son, for that had a purpose; w=
hat in Louis XI was true=20

vinegar, sharp and biting, had not yet gone through the full process of fer=
mentation in Charles VII.=20

and was simply a fluid evil to the taste, with no useful properties. Reared=
 at a court where pleasure=20

was the only law, under the evil influence of Isabeau de Baviere--whenever =
she thought to trouble=20

herself about him--and, later, of the savage and unscrupulous Bernard d'Arm=
agnac, who wished to=20

retain power for himself and hence debauched the young prince, it is not su=
rprising to find Charles=20

a libertine, and one easily controlled by any favorite who happened to be i=
n the ascendant. As a=20

boy of sixteen he had been made an accomplice, whether constructively guilt=
y or not of the actual=20

crime, in the murder of Duke Jean de Bourgogne. At nineteen he was proclaim=
ed King of France=20

by his handful of followers, while the victorious English were proclaiming =
Henry VI. in Paris (1422).=20

Defeat followed defeat for his armies, owing partly to the demoralization o=
f the troops, partly to the=20

inability of the leaders to maintain any sort of discipline among the bands=
 of half savage men at=20

arms from Gascony, Brittany, Scotland, and even Italy and Spain. Yet for mo=
st of the disasters,=20

Charles himself was to blame, since he continued to lead a life of slothful=
 pleasure, making no=20

serious efforts to control himself or to take an active part in the affairs=
 of his ruined kingdom.  The=20

salvation of France was to come from a woman, one as nearly a saint as mort=
al can be; but some=20

part of the preparation for the coming of that saint was made by other wome=
n, not by any means=20



saintly. The wife of Charles VII. was Marie d'Anjou, who, with her husband,=
 was=20


_
less chivalrous than himself. He has      Let the younger and unskilled go =
by     To win his honour=20

and to make his name.  Indeed, more than anyone else among us, he has kept =
his faith that youth,=20

given time enough, will discover art as it will find out other incarnations=
 of beauty, and will achieve=20

new miracles in its worship. Twenty-five years ago he taught us to love the=
 masters in poetry=E2=80=94no=20

easier thing to do for boys then than it is now. We have still to acquire h=
is hospitality toward the=20

future, to look on with his good humor and sympathy while the immature in t=
he world of art, as=20

elsewhere, try to rearrange the universe, not knowing that it has been here=
 for some time and is=20

set in its ways.                                                           =
           J. E.     THE LITERARY DISCIPLINE=20

I  DECENCY IN LITERATURE   I  The quarrel with indecent art is an old one, =
and the present=20

discussion of improper books, with threats of censorship, begins to rally i=
tself in two familiar=20

camps=E2=80=94on one side the moralists, showing in the heat of debate less=
 understanding of art than=20

they probably have, and on the other side the writers, showing in the same =
heat somewhat less=20

concern for morals than it is to be hoped they feel. The censorious seem di=
sposed to suppress on=20

the ground of indecency almost any kind of book they happen not to like; th=
e writers seem at times=20

to argue that all books are equally good, or, at least, should be free and =
equal. These are the old=20

exaggerations of the quarrel. Yet in two important respects the present dis=
cussion is quite novel=20

and more than usually interesting; for one thing, the attack now is less on=
 obscenity, about which=20

there are no two opinions, than on indecency, of which we have at the momen=
t no adequate=20

definition; for another thing, the writers themselves, perhaps for the firs=
t time in history, have no=20

definition of literary decency to offer, and seem not greatly interested in=
 forming one.  Censorships=20

are usually exercised for the protection of religious or political doctrine=
, and whatever may be said=20

against the method, at least in the field of religion or politics the censo=
r knows clearly what he=20

wishes to protect. But if we now would protect decency, we must first defin=
e the term. It is not=20

enough to have a moral conviction on the subject; we must have also some pr=
inciple outside of=20

our emotional prejudices, based on something more lasting than fashion. In =
the present welter of=20

contradictions and opprobrium it is sometimes thought indecent to wear bobb=
ed hair or short=20

skirts; for the morals of the school, teachers have been dismissed who roll=
ed their stockings below=20

the knee. Obviously, these are not great faults in decency, if faults at al=
l; a good deal of camel=20

must have been swallowed before justice could be done to these gnats. Some =
of our neighbors=20

wish to suppress certain plays; others wish to suppress the theatre. Some w=
ish to suppress=20

Swinburne and Baudelaire, with one hand as it were, while distributing with=
 the other copies of the=20

Bible containing the _Song of Songs_. A minister of this type, earnest in h=
is work for decency and=20

quite muddled as to what it is, told me that he could not give his approval=
 to the _Spoon River=20

Anthology_, brilliant though it was; he could approve of no book that portr=
ayed fornication. Yet he=20

must have read the story of Lot=E2=80=99s daughters and their behavior with=
 their father. He approved of=20

the Bible, and he would probably not call it indecent. What is decency, the=
n, or its opposite?  At=20

this point the writers ought to stand up and answer. In other ages they wou=
ld have done so; they=20

would have thought no one so competent as the artist to define decency in h=
is own field, and they=20

would have stated their definition from the point of view of art. They woul=
d have called it =E2=80=9Cdecorum=E2=80=9D=20

instead of =E2=80=9Cdecency=E2=80=9D, but they would have meant the same th=
ing=E2=80=94fitness or propriety in the=20

particular art they practised. When Milton made his famous plea on ethical =
grounds for freedom of=20

the press, he went on, as an artist, to say that of course there are good a=
nd bad books, and when=20



a book has had its chance, it must submit to the judgment of the competent.=
 He was writing in an=20

age when the reader might be expected to have some training in artistic def=
initions of decorum. If=20

books are to enjoy freedom of publication now, it seems incumbent upon the =
writers to define the=20

decency of their art, and to spread the knowledge of the definition, as wid=
ely as possible, that the=20

competent reader of today may have a standard by which to judge.   II  It o=
ught to be possible=20

now, as it once was, to define decency in terms outside our emotions, not v=
ariable with our private=20

taste but fixed in the conditions of the artist=E2=80=99s work. When man is=
 inspired by the world he sees to=20

make some lasting record of his feeling about it, and selects a medium to e=
xpress himself=20

in,=E2=80=94wood, stone, metal, color, language,=E2=80=94he immediately enc=
ounters certain problems and=20

difficulties in his medium, certain limitations in it which he must submit =
to, if he would convey his=20

meaning with precision. The limitations of his medium, therefore, dictate t=
o the artist his first=20

lessons in decorum. For if you will not respect those limitations, you will=
 find yourself saying what=20

you did not intend; instead of beauty, you will convey some effect humorous=
 or grotesque or ugly.=20

It is at least bearable to see actual garments on the wax figures in shop-w=
indows; we dress up=20

dolls. But not even the shop window could tolerate a marble statue with clo=
thes on. When the artist=20

learns that some things, though excellent in themselves, do not come out in=
 his medium with the=20

effect he desires, his good sense and the sincerity of his art compel him t=
o leave these subjects for=20

other mediums. The themes he thus abandons are not indecent in the sense of=
 obscenity or filth,=20

not bad in themselves, but they do not fit his art=E2=80=94or, as writers u=
sed to say, do not belong to its=20

decorum.  The decorum of art may seem to the moralist far less important th=
an the decency his=20

own strong emotions feel after, but the moralist is wrong. The decorum of a=
rt is the deeper kind of=20

decency, for it is based on lasting principles, and it leads to an understa=
nding of the positive good=20

in art, to beauty, as the moralist=E2=80=99s concern for decency often does=
 not. You cannot explain on=20

moral grounds why the glorification of the body in Walt Whitman, let us say=
, is sometimes=20

disconcerting, yet the glorification of it in Greek sculpture seems not onl=
y decent but noble. The=20

artist could explain the matter if he understood the decorum of artistic me=
diums. In so far as he=20

does not understand it, he adds to the confusion of the arts in our time; h=
e fills our magazines, for=20

example, with photographs of Greek dances, and is himself, let us hope, dis=
turbed by the=20

grotesque contortions he has perpetuated. The dance was probably a graceful=
 flow of motion; of=20

all that flow, however, only a few moments would be in the decorum of the c=
amera=E2=80=94moments of=20

poise, in which motion might be suggested but not represented. But the phot=
ographer was=20

charmed by the moments of motion, which are the essence of dance decorum, a=
nd he gives us a=20

picture of grim-faced ladies suspended in the air, with frantic gestures of=
 fingers and toes.  In=20

literature, since the domination of her mother, Yolande d'Aragon, one of th=
ose active, able, but=20

unscrupulous women who rule by intrigue, who are content to let others clai=
m the glory so long as=20

the real secret of power is theirs. Queen Yolande, anxious to preserve the =
dignity of the house of=20

Anjou for her son Rene, needed the support of France, and she hated England=
. She gained a=20

remarkable ascendency over Charles VII., and used this most wisely for the =
good of France,=20

though some of her methods may seem of a sort to disconcert prevailing opin=
ions.  Seeing that=20

Charles was by nature a libertine, she determined to make use of that side =
of his character,=20

although at the expense of her own daughter. It was she who presented to Ch=
arles that famous=20

and lovely _Dame de beaute_, Agnes Sorel. The role played by this mistress =
of the king is truly=20



admirable as well as remarkable. Agnes was no vulgar woman, but an Aspasia =
of her time, of=20

noble birth, beautiful, and of a character gentle as well as essentially go=
od. It is no paradox to=20

pronounce her good, though she led a life condemned by moral laws; for the =
laxity of the age must=20

be considered, as well as the methods of the mistress herself. Even the wif=
e of her royal lover=20

respected Agnes Sorel, and there was friendship between them. So far from s=
eeking to surround=20

herself with idle and vicious companions and encouraging Charles in offendi=
ng useful friends or=20

wise counsellors, she used her influence, in conjunction with Yolande, to e=
stablish the credit of the=20

Constable de Richemont, the most useful of Charles's allies at this time.  =
Legend has gilded her=20

portrait for us, and much that is told of her is not susceptible of proof, =
but the tendency of her=20

influence is shown by one little incident. Charles, unable to win back his =
kingdom, unable to=20

maintain himself in it north of the Loire, unable to find money to pay his =
troops, was yet able to=20

build a chateau at Loches for Agnes Sorel. Here he was basking in her smile=
s and heedless of the=20

distress of France, when accident gave Agnes a chance to rouse his nobler f=
eelings. Charles had,=20

to amuse the passing hour, called a fortune teller to the chateau, and stoo=
d by while the man told=20

the fortune of his well-beloved Agnes. The mountebank, with the cunning of =
his kind, thought to=20

flatter this vain and lovely lady by prophesying: "Some day thou shalt be t=
he wife of the greatest=20

king on earth." Agnes, with ready wit, rose at once to her occasion. "If th=
at be my true fortune,"=20

said she to the dauphin, "I must leave you this instant and go marry the Ki=
ng of England; for I see=20

that, in the sloth that confines you here, you will not long be King of Fra=
nce." The shot told, and=20

Charles was stung into momentary activity. Throughout her life Agnes contin=
ued to exert a=20

salutary influence upon him; and when she died,--poisoned, it was said, by =
the then dauphin,=20

afterward Louis XI,--evil favorites soon replaced the wise counsellors at t=
he king's board, and his=20

last years were as full of misery as had been those before Jeanne came myst=
eriously out of the=20

east and gave him his crown.  It was not Charles, the miserable, ungrateful=
 voluptuary whose=20

character we have attempted to show, that was loved and saved by Jeanne d'A=
rc; it was France,=20

represented to her in the person of the dauphin. For her, Charles was a sym=
bol, a mere incarnate=20

_patrie_ for whose salvation she was commissioned by the Lord of Hosts; the=
 man himself was=20

nothing; in her simple peasant's heart, she hardly thought of him as a man,=
 rather as a sort of=20

divinity that could do no wrong, that must be worshipped, that must first o=
f all be saved and set up=20

safely in its tabernacle of Rouen. Unworthier idol never was created than t=
his insensible thing=20

called the dauphin, with as little care for the victims crushed beneath him=
 as if he had been in very=20

truth a mere wooden Juggernaut or Mumbo Jumbo; but all of us worship unwort=
hy idols and are=20

quite unconscious of their unworthiness. And, as in the case of Jeanne, if =
worship and worshipper=20

be pure, what matter if the idol be a little unsteady on the pedestal to wh=
ich our blind devotion has=20

raised it?  The worship of Jeanne for the dauphin had begun in very childho=
od, when this dream-

guided little maid of Lorraine hardly knew what "king" or "kingdom" meant. =
Writers have remarked,=20

as De Quincey and Michelet, upon the fact that Jeanne was born in a border =
land, on the marches=20

of Lorraine and Champagne, in the debatable land between the great parties =
of Orleans and=20

Burgundy; but the mere situation of this little village of Domremy upon the=
 great Franco-German=20

highway is a geographical fact that could be conned over and over, and then=
 forgotten, without our=20

being one whit the better or the worse. The dead fact is nevertheless a fru=
itful seed of thought, if=20

we but allow it to come to germination. We may recall that in the present d=
ay the most enthusiastic=20



of those patriots of France who are ever clamoring misguidedly for war are =
the people of this one-

time border of France. However misguided may be the demonstrations of the c=
rowds who annually=20

drape in mourning the statue of Strasbourg on the Place de la Concorde, an =
enthusiastic=20

patriotism is their inspiration. "The outposts of France, as one may call t=
he great frontier=20

provinces," De Quincey says, "were of all localities the most devoted to th=
e Fleurs de Lys. To=20

witness, at any great crisis, the generous devotion to these lilies of the =
little fiery cousin (Lorraine)=20

that in gentler weather was forever tilting at the breast of France, could =
not but fan the zeal of=20

France's legitimate daughters; whilst to occupy a post of honour on the fro=
ntiers against an old=20

hereditary enemy of France would naturally stimulate this zeal by a sentime=
nt of martial pride, by a=20

sense of danger always threatening, and of hatred always smouldering.... Th=
e eye that watched=20

for the gleams of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier, the ear that l=
istened for the groaning of=20

wheels, made the highroad itself, with its relations to centres so remote, =
into a manual of patriotic=20

duty."  Nursed in an atmosphere of patriotism, therefore, the little Jeanne=
 had the horrors of war=20

brought vividly before her when a band of brigands, nominally English or Bu=
rgundian partisans,=20

rushed down upon Domremy, sacked the town, burned the church, and drove man=
y of the=20

inhabitants, including Jeanne's family, into temporary exile. The family ca=
me back again, and the=20

immediate ravages of the soldiers were repaired, but Jeanne never forgot, a=
nd told in after years=20

how she would shiver with horror and then weep from sheer pity at seeing he=
r village friends come=20

back wounded and bleeding from some affray with the English.  Jeanne, the d=
aughter of one who=20

is described as a _simple laboureur_ (which may mean that he was an indepen=
dent farmer in a=20

small way, not a mere laborer), was born in 1412, and was therefore old eno=
ugh to see and to=20

appreciate the worst of the miseries of France and to understand the tales =
of war and of English=20

outrages brought to her father's door by many a traveller on the great high=
way that passed=20

through Domremy; and her heart was filled with pity for the poor dauphin, r=
epudiated by his own=20

mother, exiled from his kingdom by the English, wandering aimlessly from pr=
ovince to province=20

where the arms of his enemies=20


_
limitations and capacities of words. The great limitation of language is th=
at it must be heard or read=20

one word at a time, though most of the things we wish to speak of in this w=
orld should be thought=20

of or seen all at once, and their true outline and their total effect may b=
e dislocated by piecemeal=20

expression. To represent in language a landscape or a person, a building or=
 him to pass. The=20

child's mind could but be stirred and filled with those vague, generous dre=
ams of sacrifice, of=20

heroism, of impossible achievements, which, like other visions, fade "into =
the light of common day"=20

with most of us. Not so with Jeanne, in whom from the start there was somet=
hing mystical,=20

something that set her apart from other children.  With her work-a-day life=
=20


_
speaking, impossible; we can merely make statements, carefully selected, ab=
out the subject, and=20

trust that no matter how dismembered in the telling, it will somehow come t=
ogether again in the=20

hearer=E2=80=99s mind, thanks largely to the hearer=E2=80=99s imagination. =
Where the suggestion is so slight and=20

the collaboration so great, the writer is under some obligation to be preci=
se and conscientious in=20

what he suggests. His responsibility might perhaps seem less when he is tel=
ling a story; if her=20

family who stand for none of the things of the spirit for which she was to =
serve. Her father, of=20

whom even tradition has been able to make neither a monster nor a hero, was=
 merely a=20

commonplace peasant, apparently amiable and kindly, but manifestly incapabl=
e of sympathy with=20

things ethereal and supernatural; we need not go so far as De Quincey and d=
eny him patriotism:=20

"He would greatly have preferred... the saving of a pound or so of bacon to=
 saving the Oriflamme=20

nce of time. But even in=20

the recital of events, language has to name separately in an artificial ord=
er events which actually=20

coincide, and the reader=E2=80=99s imagination must put the fragments toget=
her again. _=E2=80=9CIndeed,=E2=80=9D replied=20

Mr. Jones_, or, _Mr. Jones replied, =E2=80=9CIndeed!=E2=80=9D_ Neither form=
ula quite represents what happened. In=20

life, when we heard the =E2=80=9CIndeed!=E2=80=9D the sound would tell us n=
ot only what was said but also who said=20

it. No wonder the poets have so often thought of the drama as the most sati=
sfying literary form, for=20

with her brothers, Jean and Pierre; though ennobled by the king, and though=
 doubtless very good=20

fellows, they were certainly very far from being noble in spirit, or in any=
 way comparable to their=20

sister. For Jeanne's nobility was based upon no accident of birth or favor =
of a prince: it was the gift=20

of God.  The life of Jeanne d'Arc was probably not essentially different fr=
om that of other girls of=20

her class, at least up to her fourteenth or fifteenth year. From the testim=
ony of those who recalled=20

the childhood of the heroine long after she had become a heroine we must tu=
rn with some distrust;=20

for motives the most diverse may have induced, and doubtless did induce, th=
em to conceal or=20

ak to the eye while the voice=20

is speaking to the ear.  Because words must be spoken one after another, th=
ere are not only some=20

things which are hard to say in that medium, but others which in things in =
this simple story. But=20

there seems to be no doubt that Jeanne tended sheep, like her sister and ot=
her children of the=20

neighborhood, that she learned all the simple little domestic arts, and "wa=
