Gutenberg License included with this inquiries regarding his plans.  This p=
roved Bok's instinct to=20

be correct as to the public willingness to accept such designs; upon this p=
roof he succeeded in=20

winning over two additional architects to make plans.  He offered his reade=
rs full building=20

specifications and plans to scale of the houses with estimates from four bu=
ilders in different parts=20

of the United States for five dollars a set.  The plans and specifications =
were so complete in every=20

detail that any builder could build the house from them.  A storm of critic=
ism now arose from=20

architects and builders all over the country, the architects claiming that =
Bok was taking "the bread=20

out of their mouths" by the sale of plans, and local builders vigorously qu=
estioned the accuracy of=20

the estimates.  But Bok knew he was right and persevered.  Slowly but surel=
y he won the approval=20

of the leading architects, who saw that he was appealing to a class of hous=
e-builders who could=20

not afford to pay an architect's fee, and that, with his wide circulation, =
he might become an=20

influence for better architecture through these small houses.  The sets of =
plans and specifications=20

sold by the thousands.  It was not long before the magazine was able to pre=
sent small-house=20

plans by the foremost architects of the country, whose services the average=
 householder could=20

otherwise never have dreamed of securing.  Bok not only saw an opportunity =
to better the exterior=20

of the small houses, but he determined that each plan published should prov=
ide for two essentials;=20

every servant's room should have two windows to insure cross-ventilation, a=
