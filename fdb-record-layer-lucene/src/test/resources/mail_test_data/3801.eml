body as it did the earthly=20

one. Wherefore the ancients say that       there is a celestial body always=
 joined with the soul,=20

which is       immortal, luminous and star-like." It becomes natural then, =
that the       "aerial body" of=20

an Adept should have no such second dying, since it       has been cleansed=
 of all its natural=20

impurity before its separation       from the physical body. The high Initi=

his man would not escape him, he recovered his usual tranquillity. He turne=
d up his cuffs neatly=20

and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor, but did not fail, howev=
er, to remark that Mordaunt=20

was looking about him in a singular manner.  "Are you ready, sir?" he said =
at last.  "I was waiting=20

for you, sir," said Mordaunt, raising his head and casting at his opponent =
a look it would be=20

impossible to describe.  "Well, then," said the Gascon, "take care of yours=
elf, for I am not a bad=20

hand at the rapier."  "Nor I either."  "So much the better; that sets my mi=
nd at rest. Defend=20

"No, but to set my mind=20

at rest, as you observed just now."  "It is for something else than that, I=
 imagine," muttered=20

D'Artagnan, shaking his head doubtfully.  "On the honor of gentlemen," said=
 Aramis and Porthos.=20

"In that case, gentlemen, have the kindness to retire into the corners, so =
as to give us ample room.=20

We shall require it."  "Yes, gentlemen," said D'Artagnan, "we must not leav=
e this person the=20

slightest pretext for behaving badly, which, with all due respect, I fancy =
he is anxious still to do."=20

This new attack made no impression on Mordaunt. The=20

rifle with his=20

of satisfaction.  And without losing a minute, thinking he saw an opening, =
