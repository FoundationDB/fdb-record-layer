 =E2=80=9CThe press of the heaving,=20

as I can estimate time,=20

from the moment I saw the front of the angry torrent it was upon us. The gr=

I walked rapidly to the southeast window, and saw the front of the brick dw=

adjoining mine, crushed to rubbish. Several persons were floating directly =
down Main street, in=20

saw a number of ladies, one of whom held an infant in her arms; there was a=
 crash, a sensation of=20

falling, a consciousness that I was in the water, and all was dark. A momen=

my relief and aided me in getting upon a fragment of the slate roof. A mome=
nt after, a little boy=20

whom I had sheltered, appeared and informed me that my wife was drowned; he=
 had barely made=20

this announcement when I saw my only daughter, June, rise up out of the wat=
er among the debris=20

to perhaps her waist, and immediately sink out of sight. As she sank, I saw=
 my wife rise out of the=20

water to about her waist, and almost immediately sink out of sight; a momen=
t after, they rose=20

together, and I saw my son Winter, a lad of twenty years, a strong, robust =
person, and heard him=20

say, =E2=80=98Ma, hold on to me, and I can save you.=E2=80=99 I was lying o=
n my side, perhaps twenty or twenty-five=20

feet distant from where my wife, daughter and son were struggling, the skin=
 torn from the right side=20

of my face, the blood flowing profusely from the wound, the skin torn from =
the back of my left=20

hand, my right collar-bone broken, my shoulder-blade fractured, the ribs cr=
ushed in upon my lung,=20

my right arm from shoulder to wrist lying limp on my side, powerless to giv=
e aid or assistance to=20

my loved ones. At this moment a young man seemed to shoot up and out of the=
 debris at my side;=20

I realized that he was an acquaintance, but could not name him. I at once, =
however, addressed=20

him, saying, =E2=80=98Young man, won=E2=80=99t you go and help Winter save =
my wife and daughter? I am=20

helpless; my whole right side and arm are crushed.=E2=80=99 He made no repl=
y, but  [Illustration: THE=20

BATTLE WITH THE WATERS.]  at once hastened across the debris, and aided in =
relieving my=20

wife from the timbers in which she was pinioned. Then he immediately disapp=
eared from my sight;=20

but I afterward learned he was Harry Philips, who was reared in Johnstown, =
was then practicing=20

his profession of dentistry in Pittsburg; was home on a visit, and in the h=
ouse of Dr. L. T. Beam,=20

and was the only person who escaped with his life, while his mother, niece,=
 nephew and brother-

in-law were lost in the flood. My eldest son had disappeared. I believed I =
had heard his dying=20

moan. All the other inmates of my house at the time it was struck, were now=
 floating on different=20

fragments of houses, and being rushed with fearful velocity in a westerly c=
ourse to and across the=20

Stony Creek River.  =E2=80=9CThey saw a stout roof on the edge of the debri=
s and succeeded in reaching it;=20

an old lady on bended knees and holding with her hands, floated by on a shu=
tter, and Winter=20

assisted her to gain the roof; the current suddenly turned and swept them r=
apidly up Stony Creek,=20

a distance of half a mile; they came to rest above Morris street in the Fif=
th Ward, and lay for a=20

considerable time; some inexplicable force then carried them across the riv=
er, and they lay for a=20

while in the mouth of Franklin street; the Catholic church was on fire, and=
 the town clock struck=20

five; a cold and pitiless rain poured down upon them; the current now chang=
ed and buildings and=20

wreckage were borne rapidly down the stream; as houses were broken to piece=
s, clinging=20

wretches with wild shrieks sank to watery graves; the two sons were separat=
ed from the remainder=20

of the family on the roof; it drifted once more down the stream, was struck=
 by a heavier building=20



and pushed upon the bank; over various drift they climbed till they reached=
 a three-story brick=20

which stood intact; they entered it just as the town clock struck six--two =
awful hours, and yet no=20

member of the family lost. Happier far their fate than that of many others.=
 The two boys returned to=20

their parents at four o=E2=80=99clock the next day.=E2=80=9D  These inciden=
ts will suffice. Thousands of the same=20

sort might be given. No wonder that many were crazed with grief. One woman,=
 wife and mother,=20

sole survivor of a happy family, was found sitting in the wreck, holding in=
 her arms her family clock=20

which she had found. She told her story without a tear. Her mind was unbala=
nced. A man who had=20

never been known to touch liquor was found the day after the flood, reeling=
 to the bridge, drunk=20

and raving, determined to drown himself. In agony at the loss of all he hel=
d dear, he had taken to=20

drink, that he might remember his misery no more; but in vain: whisky could=
 not destroy his terrible=20

memories. Talmage in a letter to the New York _World_, said: =E2=80=9CSuch =
an avalanche of horrors=20

never slipped upon any American city. Horrors piled on horrors, woe augment=
ing woe; bankruptcy,=20

orphanage, widowhood, childlessness, obliterated homesteads, gorged cemeter=
ies and scenes so=20

excruciating it is a marvel that any one could look upon them and escape in=

work of devastation as great as I supposed? Far worse. Types can not tell i=

caused by the sudden=20

departure of so many can be open only to one eye, and that the All-Seeing. =

         PREFACE   In the=20

present volume, a brief outline of events in Filipinas during the period 18=
01-40 serves as a=20

background and setting for the following surveys of political, social, and =
economic conditions in the=20

islands during that period. Of these, one is made by an English naval offic=
er who had visited the=20

islands, another by a Spanish official of long experience, and a third (pre=
sented in synopsis) by a=20

merchant familiar with the commerce of the Orient and the Americas. These d=
ifferent accounts=20

(written at nearly the same time) furnish most valuable knowledge of the Ph=
ilippines and their=20

people, and their needs and possibilities; and at the same time they reflec=
t the more enlightened=20

and liberal ideas of policy and administration which had gained a foothold =
in Spain, and which the=20

recent loss of her other colonies had made her more willing to put in pract=
ice in Filipinas.  The=20

leading events in Philippine history during the first four decades of the n=
ineteenth century are=20

briefly epitomized from Montero y Vidal's Historia de Filipinas. Governor A=
guilar opposes the=20

appointment of native secular priests to the curacies, regarding them as un=
fit for these posts.=20

During his term, he introduces public street-lighting, paved sidewalks, and=
 vaccination in Manila,=20

and various other beneficial measures; he attempts, but with little success=
, to check the piracies of=20

the Moros, and is compelled to desist therefrom by news of the war between =
England and Spain,=20

and the consequent danger to number placed above them and are recorded in t=
he undertaker=E2=80=99s=20

rooms with a description of the body and clothes.=E2=80=9D  On many a life =
a shadow has been cast that=20

will never be lifted. Many a heart will ache until it breaks. One who had l=
ost wife and children and=20

was alone, whose verses and whose name the world has never heard, more than=
 thirty years ago=20

wrote the following most touchingly beautiful lines, which will find an ech=
o in the hearts of=20

thousands of survivors of the Johnstown flood, as well as among countless m=
illions of others in=20

every age of the world:      Down by the cedar sitting,       Lonely and sa=
d and still,     Watching the=20

shadows flitting       Over the distant hill.     Yearning for by-gone hour=
s,       Never again to come;=20

Longing for beauteous flowers,       Never again to bloom.      Ever there =
flits before me       A=20

shadowy form and face;     Ever it hovers o=E2=80=99er me,       Wearing a =
nameless grace.     Above my=20

brow there lingers       A breath like summer air;     Unseen and loving fi=
ngers       Stray through my=20

tangled hair.      Silence, slow creeping nigh me,       Out from the leafy=
 shade,     Bringeth the=20

dead hours by me,       And rests on the darkening glade.      O ye beloved=
 of spring time,       Can=20

ye come back no more?     Bending I trace your footsteps       Over the dis=
tant shore;     Down to=20

the misty river,       Into the depths of death,     Seeking your presence =
ever,       Praying with=20



sobbing breath,     =E2=80=9CCan ye come back no more?=E2=80=9D       Echoi=
ng clear from the unseen shore,=20

Answer sweet voices =E2=80=9CNo more, no more!=E2=80=9D      O for the pear=
ly gates       Of the golden nightless=20

plain,     Where your gentle spirit waits       For the hour we meet again.=
      Out from the darkness,=20

soft and plain,     Comes the glad echo, =E2=80=9C_We meet again_.=E2=80=9D=
     CHAPTER XVIII.  RELIEF=20

MEASURES.      =E2=80=9CAbou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase)      Awoke =
one night from a deep=20

dream of peace,      And saw within the moonlight of his room,      Making =
it rich and like a lily in=20

bloom,      An angel writing in a book of gold:      Exceeding peace had ma=
de Ben Adhem bold,=20

And to the presence in the room he said,     =E2=80=9CWhat writest thou?=E2=
=80=9D The vision raised its head,=20

And with a look made all of sweet accord,      Answered: =E2=80=9CThe names=
 of those who love the Lord.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CAnd is mine one?=E2=80=9D said Abou. =E2=80=9CNay, not so,=E2=80=
=9D      Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,      But=20

cheerily still, and said, =E2=80=9CI pray thee then      Write me as one wh=
o loves his fellow men.=E2=80=9D       The=20

angel wrote and vanished. The next night      It came again with a great wa=

becomes governor ad interim; he strengthens the fortifications of Manila, a=
nd quells a revolt in=20

Ilocos. He is succeeded (March 4, 1810) by the new proprietary governor, Go=

promotes cattle-raising in the provinces, quells another insurrection in Il=

newspaper in Filipinas, and proclaims the Spanish constitution of 1812. In =
1813 arrives his=20

successor, Jos de Gardoqui, whose rule is by no means easy; for he is oppos=
