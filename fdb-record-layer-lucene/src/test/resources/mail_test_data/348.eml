philodendron monstera for lands on the American bottoms. In 1865 a general =
act was passed. All these enactments were under the constitution of 1848 wh=
ich was silent on drainage, and the courts annulled most of these as uncons=
titutional. In 1870 the new constitution was framed containing a brief prov=
ision on drainage. The late Mr. Browning, a leading member of that conventi=
on, drafted a drainage bill which was enacted into a law without change. La=
rge enterprises were organized and got well started; but again some is read=
ily observed between prairies, properly so called, and those bogs.  But to =
prove farther that water had no agency in bringing the prairies into existe=
nce, we may mention those on and near the summit of the Alleghany mountains=
, (principally in Alleghany County.[47]) Many of those prairies are ten or =
twelve miles in length, and three or four in width. Will it be pretended th=
at the sides of those mountains were also lakes? Farther--the most extensiv=
e prairies known, are the very high philodendron monstera for lands on the =
American bottoms. In 1865 a general act was passed. All these enactments we=

Attached to it, and following the mole, is a carrier 200 feet long, made co=

 or hole of required depth;=20

when the carrier is drawn in full length a hole is dug just back of the cou=

down to the tile, a stop placed in front of the tile, the machine is starte=

they are found in equal or greater quantities all over America, in the side=

the Alleghany mountains; on the Andes, in South America, and the Alps, in E=
urope. The=20

resemblance which the soil, in the low prairies, and not in the high, bears=
 to the _alluvial_, can=20

justly be attributed, it is presumed, to the leaves and other vegetables an=
d light materials of which=20

they are composed, having been washed by heavy rains, for ages past, from t=
he higher to the=20

lower places. This will also account for the circumstance of trees growing =
upon the summits of the=20

hills of steep ascent: being thin and poor, the grass neither grows suffici=
ently long or thick to kill=20

the timber when fired. They _could not_ have been islands in this=20


_
and of this there seems to be no question, if we may believe the testimony =
of those who have=20

seen it in operation.  DRAINAGE LAWS.  The following by Senator Whiting, of=
 Bureau county, was=20

read by the Secretary:  Illinois is a good State as nature made her, and dr=
ainage is destined to add=20

wealth almost inestimable. Drainage enterprises are everywhere seen--in ext=
ent from the small=20

work beginning and ending in the same field, to the levees of Sny Carte, an=
d the canal-like=20

channels through the Winnebago swamps. Drainage is naturally divided into t=
wo classes:  1.=20

Individual drainage, where the land-owner has his own outlet independent of=
 others.  2. Combined=20

drainage where one can not drain without joining with others.  The smallest=
 of these combined=20

works is where two only are concerned. The Hickory Creek ditch now in progr=
ess in Bureau and=20

Henry counties is thirteen miles long, has a district of about 15,000 acres=
, owned by over seventy-

five persons. lake; because their summits are frequently much _lower_ than =
high prairie flats a few=20

miles distant. These are facts which will be recollected by those who have =
ever travelled through a=20

prairie country of any extent.  But suppose it to have been proved, that th=
e waters of Lake Erie=20

once overspread the state of Ohio, from its present shore to Chillicothe, (=
a supposition which I=20

trust has however been shown to be visionary) does it follow that the prair=
ies were occasioned by=20

such overflowing? If the water, by covering the country, prevented the timb=
er from growing, should=20

we not naturally look for the largest timber on the higher grounds which wo=
uld be first forsaken by=20

the waters, and for small timber on the low grounds, where the water remain=
ed longest? If this be=20

true, (and it is unquestionable) we should then look for prairies on the lo=
w grounds bordering on=20

Lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan; and the thickly timbered country would be =
on the high land,=20


_
public works. For this class the constitution has been twice amended, and m=
any elaborate laws=20

have been enacted. These laws have had their vicissitudes, and are not yet =
free from=20

complications. The first drainage legislation commenced forty years ago, by=
 a special act, to drain=20

some wet contrary is absolutely the fact: we find heavy timbered land, and =
no _prairies_, in the low=20

countries north of the lakes, and none south, either in Michigan territory =
or elsewhere, until we=20

arrive near the sources of the rivers. It is true, that the water standing =
in ponds will prevent the=20
