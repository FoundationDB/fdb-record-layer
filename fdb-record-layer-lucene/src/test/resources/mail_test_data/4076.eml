and naturally the owners don't want their houses pulled down, whatever treasures in the way of 

Greek or Roman antiquities may lie buried underneath. Isn't the view of the Bay of Naples 

beautiful from here?"  "Yes, and the flowers. It's like fairyland."  At Pugliano the party left the train, 

and after a long and tiresome wait at the station changed to the light electric railway that was to 

take them up Vesuvius. The little carriage resembled a tramcar, and its wide glass windows 

afforded excellent views of the scenery _en route_. Up--up--up they went, gradually getting higher 

and higher. It was marvelous how the vegetation altered as they ascended. The cactuses, olives, 

almonds, and peach orchards gave way to hillsides covered with small chestnut, oak, or poplar 

trees, and the poppies and daisies were succeeded by broom bushes and clumps of rosemary. 

They were getting on to the region of the lava, and all the ground was brown, like newly turned 

peat. Men were busy digging terraces in the volcanic earth, to plant vines, working calmly as if the 

great cone above them had never belched forth fire and ashes.  "How _dare_ they live here?" 

shuddered Peachy, pointing to the tiny dwellings which had been reared here and there. "When 

they see all the ruin round them, aren't they afraid? What makes them go back?"  "The ground is 

so rich," explained Miss Morley. "Nothing grows vines so splendidly as volcanic earth. The people 

get fatalistic, and think it worth risking their lives to have these fruitful little farms. They say the 

mountain may not be angry again for years, and they will take their chance."  "It's smoking now," 

said Lorna.  "I suppose it's safe?" asked Delia anxiously.  "Perfectly safe to-day or we shouldn't 

have been allowed to go up in the electric railway. Do you see that big building--the observatory? 

Careful investigations are made every day of the crater, and the results telegraphed down to 

Naples. If there were the slightest hint of danger the trains would be stopped and tourists turned 

back."  The journey was ever upwards, over great wastes of rough brown lava, which looked as if 

some giant, in play, had squeezed out the contents of enormous tubes of oil paint on to the mighty 

palette of the mountain side. The air had grown fresh and cold, for they were at an altitude 

approaching 4000 feet, and, but for the scenery, might have imagined themselves in Wales or 

Scotland.  The light railway ended at a small station, where there was the observatory and a hotel. 

All round were masses of enormous cinders, and above, a grim sight, towered the immense cone 

of Vesuvius. To scale the tremendous incline to the summit there was a funicular railway, to which 

our party now transferred themselves, sitting on seats raised one above another as in the gallery 

of a theater. It was here that, if the events of the day are to be truly chronicled, we must record a 

scrimmage between Irene and her chum, Peachy. The conductor of the light railway had gathered 

a bunch of rosemary _en route_, and he now approached the funicular and bestowed his offering 

upon Peachy, who happened to be sitting nearest to the end. She was immensely gratified at the 

attention, sniffed the fragrant nosegay, and handed it on for admiration to Lorna, who, after also 

burying her nose in it, passed it to Irene. The latter ought to have realized it was not her own 

property, but unfortunately didn't. She calmly appropriated the bunch, and distributed it in portions 

to those nearest her. Peachy's cheeks flamed. She was a hot-tempered little soul underneath her 

gay banter.  "Well! Of all cool cheek," she exploded. "That was _my_ bouquet. It was given to 

_me_, not to you, Renie Beverley. Next time you start being charitable use your own flowers, not 

mine. You haven't left me a single piece."  "I'm sorry," blushed Irene, trying to collect some portion 

at least of her offerings to hand back to the lawful owner. "I thought they were given to me."  "No, 

you didn't, you simply bagged them," snapped Peachy. "I'm not friends with you, so don't talk to 



me any more," and Peachy turned a red offended face out of the carriage window.  Irene might 

have apologized further, but the funicular gave a mighty jerk at that moment, and the carriage 

started. Up--up went the little train, working on wire ropes like a bucket coming out of a well. 

Higher and higher and higher it the course of my travels, I confess there are few that have made 

so powerful an impression on me as the aspect of the cow-tree. Whatever relates to milk or to 

corn, inspires an interest which is not merely that of the physical knowledge of things, but is 

connected with another order of ideas and sentiments. We can scarcely conceive how the human 

race could exist without farinaceous substances, and without that nourishing juice which the breast 

of the mother contains, and which is appropriated to the long feebleness of the infant. The 

amylaceous matter of corn, the object of religious veneration among so many nations, ancient and 

modern, is diffused in the seeds, and deposited in the roots of vegetables; milk, which serves as 

an aliment, appears to us exclusively the produce of animal organization. Such are the 

impressions we have received in our earliest infancy: such is also the source of that astonishment 

created by the aspect of the tree just described. It is not here the solemn shades of forests, the 

majestic course of rivers, the mountains wrapped in eternal snow, that excite our emotion. A few 

drops of vegetable juice recall to our minds all the powerfulness and the fecundity of nature. On 

the barren flank of a rock grows a tree with coriaceous and dry leaves. Its large woody roots can 

scarcely penetrate into the stone. For several months of the year not a single shower moistens its 

foliage. Its branches appear dead and dried; but when the trunk is pierced there flows from it a 

sweet and nourishing milk. It is at the rising of the sun that this vegetable fountain is most 

abundant. The negroes and natives are then seen hastening from all quarters, furnished with large 

bowls to receive the milk, which grows yellow, and thickens at its surface. Some empty their bowls 

under the tree itself; others carry the juice home to their children.  In examining the physical 

properties of animal and vegetable products, science displays them as closely linked together; but 

it strips them of what is marvellous, and perhaps, therefore, of a part of their charms. Nothing 

appears isolated; the chemical principles that were believed to be peculiar to animals are found in 

plants; a common chain links together all organic nature.  Long before chemists had recognized 

small portions of wax in the pollen of flowers, the varnish of leaves, and the whitish dust of our 

plums and grapes, the inhabitants of the Andes of Quindiu made tapers with the thick layer of wax 

that covers the trunk of a palm-tree.* (* Coroxylon andicola.) It is but a few years since we 

discovered, in Europe, caseum, the basis of cheese, in the emulsion of almonds; yet for ages past, 

in the mountains of the coast of Venezuela, the milk of a tree, and the cheese separated from that 

vegetable milk, have been considered as a salutary aliment. How are we to account for this 

singular course in the development of knowledge? How have the unlearned inhabitants of one 

hemisphere become cognizant of a fact which, in the other, so long escaped the sagacity of the 

scientific? It is because a small number of elements and principles differently combined are spread 

through several families of plants; it is because the genera and species of these natural families 

are not equally distributed in the torrid, the frigid, and the temperate zones; it is that tribes, excited 

by want, and deriving almost all their subsistence from the vegetable kingdom, discover nutritive 

principles, farinaceous and alimentary substances, wherever nature has deposited them in the 

sap, the bark, the roots, or the fruits of vegetables. That amylaceous fecula which the seeds of the 

cereal plants furnish in all its purity, is found united with an acrid and sometimes even poisonous 



juice, in the roots of the arums, the Tacca pinnatifida, and the Jatropha manihot. The savage of 

America, like the savage of the South Sea islands, has learned to dulcify the fecula, by pressing 

and separating it from its juice. In the milk of plants, and in the milky emulsions, matter extremely 

nourishing, albumen, caseum, and sugar, are found mixed with caoutchouc and with deleterious 

and caustic principles, such as morphine and hydrocyanic acid.* (* Opium contains morphine, 

caoutchouc, etc.) These mixtures vary not only in the different families, but also in the species 

which belong to the same genus. Sometimes it is

which opened to admit the passengers on to the summit. Here the guides were waiting, and after 

some parleying in Italian, Miss Morley engaged a couple of them to escort her party. Led by these 

men, who knew characterises the vegetable milk, as in some papaverous plants; sometimes it is 

caoutchouc, as in the hevea and the castilloa; sometimes albumen and caseum, as in the cow-

tree.  The lactescent plants belong chiefly to the three families of the euphorbiaceae, the urticeae, 

and the apocineae.* (* After these

the crater of the volcano. A cinder path had been made along the edge of the cone, having on the 

left side a steep ridge of ashes, and on the right a sheer drop of many thousand feet. From this 

strange road there were weird and beautiful effects--for it was above the region of the clouds, 

which floated below, sometimes hiding the landscape, and sometimes revealing glorious stretches 

of country, with gleams of sunshine falling on the white houses of towns miles below, and blue 

reaches of sea with mountains beyond. Great volumes of smoke kept coming great families follow 

the papaveraceae, the chicoraceae, the lobeliaceae, the campanulaceae, the sapoteae, and the 

cucurbitaceae. The hydrocyanic acid is peculiar to the group of rosaceo-amygdalaceae. In the 

monocotyledonous plants there is no milky juice; but the perisperm of the palms, which yields such 

sweet and agreeable milky emulsions, contains, no doubt, caseum. Of what nature is the milk of 

mushrooms?) Since, on examining the distribution of vegetable forms over the globe, we find that 

those three families are more numerous in species in the

few minutes and forming again. There were booming sounds like the firing of cannons that 

seemed to issue from the smoke.  Very much awed by these impressive surroundings the party 

kept close together. The guides, in their gray uniforms and caps with red bands, that a very 

elevated temperature contributes to the elaboration of the milky juices, to the formation of 

caoutchouc, albumen, and caseous matter. The sap of the palo de vaca furnishes unquestionably 

the most striking example of a vegetable milk in which the

the girls would have been too much scared to proceed. Delia was clinging to Peachy, and Lorna 

held Irene's arm tightly. Miss Morley, who had been before, kept assuring everybody that there 

was no danger, and after a few minutes they grew sufficiently accustomed to the scene to 

thoroughly enjoy the magnificent effects of the clouds circling below them. But the guides were 

calling "Haste," for the mist was clearing, and it would be possible to get a view of the crater. They 

deleterious principle is not united with albumen, caseum, and caoutchouc: the genera euphorbia 

and asclepias, however, though generally known for their caustic properties, already present us 

with a few species, the juice of which is sweet and harmless. Such are the Tabayba dulce of the 

Canary Islands, which we have already mentioned,* (* Euphorbia balsamifera. The milky juice of 

the Cactus mamillaris is equally sweet.) and the Asclepias lactifera of Ceylon. Burman relates
