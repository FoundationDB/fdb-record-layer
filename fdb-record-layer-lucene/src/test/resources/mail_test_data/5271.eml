Princess Anne honoring the second daughter of James II by his first wife Anne Hyde, and the 

sister of Queen Mary. Later Princess Anne became a very popular Queen, Fluvanna County, the 

Rivanna River, the North Anna and South Anna and the Rapidan River all being named for her. At 

the same time that Princess Anne was formed, the name of Lower Norfolk was changed to Norfolk 

County.   RICHMOND AND ESSEX FROM OLD RAPPAHANNOCK  Settlers had long found the 

Rappahannock River area attractive. The county of this name, established in 1656, and lying on 

both sides of the river, had grown steadily and its population was sufficient to support two county 

governments. It was enacted that the river be the dividing line, "that part which is now on the north 

side thereof be called and known by the name Richmond County and that that which is now on the 

south side thereof be the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any 

Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project 

Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  Section 2. Information about the Mission of 

Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic 

works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged 

and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from 

people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the 

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the 

Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the

was further ordered "that the records belonging to the county court of Rappahannock before this 

division be kept in Essex County, that belonging wholly to their majesties and the other to the 

proprietors of the North Neck." This was a seemingly casual reference to the grant Charles II had 

made to some of his supporters while he was in exile and had confirmed on his coming to the 

throne; it comprised over five million acres lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers 

from their headsprings to the Chesapeake Bay. Not until the colony became independent was the 

Proprietary abolished.  In 1702 another division was created. The land lying between the 

Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers, known as Pamunkey Neck was taken from King and Queen and 

became King William County. This honored the reigning monarch, King William, now a widower 

since the death of Queen Mary in 1694.  King William died the same year his namesake county 

was formed and his sister-in-law, Queen Anne came to the throne. The first county formed 

thereafter honored her husband, the Prince Consort, George of Denmark. The new county, Prince 

George, embraced that portion of Charles City lying on the south side of James River. The estate, 

"Brandon," and the third oldest church building in Virginia known as Merchants Hope, are within its 

confines.  After a reign of twelve years Queen Anne died and the Elector of Hanover ascended the 

throne as King George I of England. and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

this, the Tangier-born Alexander Spotswood was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and 

took up his residence in Williamsburg. Williamsburg had become the capital in 1699. It was on 

higher land than malarial Jamestown and a more healthful place to live.  Governor Spotswood was 

active and eager to explore the resources of the colony. One of his achievements was spread 

public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain 

and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the
