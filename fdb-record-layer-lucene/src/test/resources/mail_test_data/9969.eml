before it and went to besiege and capture other places in Brittany. Jeanne de Montfort had not 

sufficient troops to make head against him in these enterprises, and had to look on from 

Hennebon while he took Dinan, Vannes, Auray, and other places, in spite of the diversions created 

by Sir Walter de Manny and the English allies. After the capitulation of Carhaix, Charles de Blois 

returned to the attack upon Hennebon, where he was joined by his lieutenant, Louis of Spain,

upon securing aid to win back her husband's patrimony in Brittany, now all overrun by the 

adherents of Charles de Blois. At length Edward did grant her plea, and she set sail for Brittany 

with a force of men at arms under command of Robert d'Artois.  Louis of Spain, with a fleet of 

Genoese ships, was waiting for the English off the coast of Guernsey, where a great naval battle 

was fought. As the ships neared each other, the Genoese crossbowmen hailed arrows upon the 

English, who hastened to grapple. "And when the lords, knights, and squires came

hand-to-hand contest, but both sides were glad to draw off in the night. The elements roused to 

battle, and a great tempest wrought much havoc among the ships. After having some of their 

stores captured and ships wrecked, the English "took a little haven not far from the city of Vannes, 

whereof they were right glad."  The first task of the countess and her allies was the capture of 

Vannes, which was accomplished without serious loss. Leaving Robert d'Artois with a garrison to
