context clearly requires the=20

omitted words, was neglected.    [Footnote 6: I have observed another error=
 in the Cambridge=20

edition, 1818, p. 115., last line but five, "domum manere" instead   of the=
 original and classical=20

reading, "domi manere." That   misprint of 1818 is followed by the Oxford e=
dition of 1848, vol.   iv.=20

p. 77. l. 12., Apol. pars vi. cap. 8. div. 1.]  I have said that the Oxford=
 Jewel of 1848 professes to=20

follow the Latin Apology of 1562, as a copy of the Latin title, with the da=
te 1562, is prefixed to the=20

Oxford edition, vol. iv. p. 1.: but the colophon appended to that reprint, =
p. 95., is strangely dated=20

1567. Was there any Latin edition of the Apology printed in that year? And,=
 if so, why are different=20

dates given for the title and colophon of the Oxford reprint? One can only =
conclude that the date=20

1567 is itself an error.  The following is printed in vol. viii. p. 290., l=
. 11., from Lady Bacon's=20

translation of Jewel's Apology, 1564, part ii. ch. 7. div. 5.: "As touching=
 the Bishop of Rome, for all=20

his parasites state and ringly sing those words in his ears, 'To thee will =
I give the keys of the=20

kingdom of heaven,'" &c. This case is different from those mentioned above,=
 in the respect that the=20

words "state and ringly" do occur in the printed edition of 1564; but it sc=
arcely need be observed=20

that the words "state & ringly" are a misprint for "flatteringly," when it =
is added that Jewel himself,=20

in his revised edition of Lady Bacon's translation, in the _Defence of the =
Apology_, 1567 and=20

1570, reads: "for all that his flattering parasites sing these words in his=
 ears." The original Latin is=20

"quamvis illi suaviter cantilentur illa verba a parasitis suis."  There are=
 also various errors and=20

several omissions in the Oxford Jewel, in the verification of the numerous =
references. Among=20

various notes (I would however add) which are inaccurate, and several that =
appear to me=20

superfluous, there are some which are most useful, as, for example, that in=
 vol. ii. p. 195., on the=20

Gloss in the Canon Law, "Our Lord God the Pope."      COLET.   ANAGRAMS.  Y=
ou have now=20

completed the third volume of "NOTES AND QUERIES," and, to the no small sur=
prise of all lovers=20

of "jeux de mots," not a single specimen of the genus Anagram has found its=
 way into your=20

columns. To what are we to ascribe such a circumstance? The ancients were n=
ot ashamed to=20

indulge in this intellectual pastime, and their anagrams, says Samuel Maund=
er, occasionally=20

contained some happy allusion. The moderns have given unequivocal proofs of=
 their fecundity in=20

the same line, and the anagrammatic labours of the French nation alone woul=
d form several=20

volumes. Indeed, to that nation belongs the honour of having introduced the=
 anagram; and such is=20

the estimation in which "the art" was held by them at one time, that their =
kings were provided with=20

a salaried Anagrammatist, as ours are with a pensioned Laureate. How comes =
it then that a=20

species of composition, once so popular, has found no representative among =
the many learned=20

correspondents of your popular periodical? Has the anagram become altogethe=
r extinct, or is it=20

only awaiting the advent of some competent genius to restore it to its prop=
er rank in the republic of=20

letters?  To me it is clear that the real cause of the prevailing dearth of=
 anagrams is the great=20

difficulty of producing good ones. Good anagrams are, to say the least of i=
t, quite as scarce as=20

good epic poems; for, if it be true that the utmost efforts of the human in=
tellect have not given birth=20

to more than six good epic poems, it is no less true that the utmost exerti=
on of human ingenuity=20

has not brought forth more than half a dozen good anagrams. Some critics ar=
e of opinion that we=20

do possess six good epic poems. Now, where shall we find six good anagrams?=
 If they exist, let=20

them be _exhibited_ in the pages of "NOTES AND QUERIES."  Indeed, it may be=
 said that the=20

anagram and the epic poem are the alpha and omega of  All gifts, those of t=
he holiday season=20



included, should be promptly acknowledged, and never by a card marked =E2=
=80=9CThanks.=E2=80=9D If a present is=20

worth any acknowledgment, it is worth courteous notice. When one says =E2=
=80=9CThank you!=E2=80=9D either=20

verbally or by letter, it should be uttered with sincerity, and from the he=
art. To omit the expression=20

of cordial gratitude is a breach of good breeding.     CHAPTER XVII  BACHEL=
OR HOSPITALITY=20

THE day is past when the bachelor is supposed to have no home, no mode of e=
ntertaining his=20

friends, no lares and penates, and no =E2=80=9Cain fireside.=E2=80=9D He is=
 now an independent householder,=20

keeping house if he choose to do so, with a corps of efficient servants, pr=
esided over by a=20

competent housekeeper,=E2=80=94or, in a simpler manner having a small apart=
ment of his own, attended=20

by a manservant or maid, if he takes his meals in his apartment. Oftener, h=
owever, he prefers to=20

dispense with housekeeping cares and live in a tiny apartment of two or thr=
ee rooms, going out to=20

a restaurant for his meals. He is then the most independent of creatures. I=
f he can afford to have a=20

man to take care of his rooms and his clothes, well and good. If not, he pa=
ys a woman to come in=20

regularly to clean his apartment, and she takes charge of his bed-making an=
d dusting or,=E2=80=94if he be=20

very deft, systematic and industrious,=E2=80=94he does this kind of thing h=
imself.  [Sidenote: THE=20

BACHELOR=E2=80=99S TEA]  In any of the cases just cited he is at liberty to=
 entertain. He may have an=20

afternoon tea, or a reception, or an after-theater chafing-dish supper. Unl=
ess he has his own suite=20

of dining-room, kitchen and butler=E2=80=99s pantry, he can not serve a reg=
ular meal in his rooms. But there=20

are many informal, Bohemian affairs to which he can invite his friends. For=
 the after-theater=20

supper, for instance, he may engage a man to assist him and to have everyth=
ing in readiness=20

when the host and his party arrive at the apartment. The host, himself, wil=
l prepare the chafing-

dish dainty, and with this may be passed articles supplied by a near-by cat=
erer, such as=20

sandwiches, ices and cakes. He may make his own coffee in a Vienna coffee-p=
ot. The whole=20

proceeding is delightful, informal and Bohemian in the best sense of the wo=
rd.         *       *       *=20

*       *  A sine qua non to all bachelor entertaining is a chaperon. The m=
arried woman can not be=20

dispensed with on such occasions. The host may be gray-headed and old enoug=
h to be a=20

grandfather many times over, but, as an unmarried man, he _must_ have a cha=
peron for his=20

women guests. If he object to this, he must reconcile himself to entertaini=
ng only those of his own=20

sex.  The age of this essential appendage to the social party makes no diff=
erence, so long as the=20

prefix =E2=80=9CMrs.=E2=80=9D is attached to her name. She may be a bride o=
f only a few weeks=E2=80=99 standing,=E2=80=94but the=20

fact that she is married is the essential.  [Sidenote: ENGAGING THE CHAPERO=
N]  The host,=20

then, first of all, engages his chaperon,=E2=80=94asking her as a favor to =
assist him in his hospitable=20

efforts. She should accept graciously, but the man will show by his manner =
that he is honored by=20

her undertaking this office for him. She must be promptly at his rooms at t=
he hour mentioned, as it=20

would be the height of impropriety for one of the young women to arrive the=
re before the matron. If=20

she prefer she may accompany a bevy of the girls invited. To her the host d=
efers, from her he asks=20

advice, and to her he pays special deference. If there is tea to be poured,=
 as at an afternoon=20

function, it is she who is asked to do it, and she may, with a pretty air o=
f assuming responsibility,=20

manage affairs somewhat as if in her own home, still remembering that she i=
s a guest. In this=20

matter tact and a knowledge of the ways of the world play a large part. The=
 chaperon is bound to=20

remain until the last girl takes her departure, after which it is quite _en=
 r=C3=A8gle_ for the host to offer=20

his escort, unless she accompanies the last guest, or a carriage be awaitin=
g her. The host thanks=20

her cordially for her kind offices, and she in turn=20


_
juxtaposition the contrast may have the effect of disparaging the anagram. =
The epic poem will=20

naturally enough suggest the idea of the sublime, and the anagram, as natur=
ally, that of the=20

ridiculous: and then it will be said that between the two there is but a st=
ep. But let any gentleman=20

make the experiment, and he will find that, instead of a step, the intermed=
iate space will he has=20

paid her.  [Sidenote: INVITING THE GUESTS]  Perhaps the simplest form of en=
tertainment for the=20

unmarried man to give in his own quarters is the afternoon tea in some of i=
ts various forms. For=20

this function the man must not issue cards, but must write personal notes, =
or ask his guests orally.=20

He may invite several friends who will supply music. If he have some friend=
 who=20


_
co-extensive with the wide field of modern mediocrity. As for myself, I hav=
e ransacked in search of=20

anagrams every hole and corner in ancient and modern literature, and have f=
ound very few=20

samples worthy of the name. Reserving the ancients for future consideration=
, let us see what the=20

moderns have to boast of in this respect.  And first, what says Isaac Disra=
eli? Anagrams being=20

literary curiosities, one would naturally expect to meet with some respecta=
ble samples of them in=20

that writer's _Curiosities of Literature_. Yet, what do we find? Among abou=
t a score which he=20

quotes, there is not one that can be reckoned a tolerable anagram, while by=
 far the greater=20

number are no anagrams at all. An anagram is the change of a word or senten=
ce into another=20

word or sentences by an _exact_ transposition of the letters. Where a singl=
e letter is either omitted=20

or added, the anagram is incomplete. Of this description are the following,=
 cited by Disraeli:--=20

"Thomas Overburie,       "O! O! base murther."        "Charles James Stewar=
t,       "Claims Arthur's=20

Seat."        "Martha Nicholson,       "Soon calm at heart."  I next turned=
 to Samuel Maunder and his=20

_Scientific and Literary Treasury_, little suspecting that, in a repertory =
bearing so ambitious a title,=20

I should fail to discover the object of my search. True, he quotes the anag=
ram made by Dr. Burney=20

after the battle of the Nile:        "Horatio Nelson,       "Honor est a Ni=
lo."  And this, it must be=20

confessed, is one of the best on record. The transposition is complete, and=
 the allusion most=20

apposite. But with that exception, what does this pretended _Treasury_ disc=
lose? A silly attempt to=20

anagrammatise the name of our beloved queen; thus:        "Her most graciou=
s Majesty=20

Alexandrina Victoria,       "Ah! my extravagant joco-serious radical musica=
lly, and whom he would=20

gladly bring before the eyes of the public, he may make the presence of thi=
s friend an excellent=20

reason for this afternoon reception. After having secured the chaperon=E2=
=80=99s acceptance he may write=20

some such note as the following:      =E2=80=9CMy dear Miss Brown:      =E2=
=80=9CI shall be delighted if you, with a=20

few other choice     spirits, will take tea with me in my apartment next   =
  Tuesday afternoon about=20

four o=E2=80=99clock. I shall have     with me at that time my friend, Mr. =
Frank Merrill,     who sings, I think,=20

passing well. I want my friends     who appreciate music and to whom his vo=
ice will give=20

pleasure to hear him in my rooms at the time mentioned.     Do come!=20

=E2=80=9CHenry Barbour.      =E2=80=9CAugust the tenth, 1905.=E2=80=9D  The=
re should, if possible, be a maid, or a man in=20

livery to attend the door, but, if this is not practicable, and the affair =
be very informal, the host may=20

himself admit his guests, and escort them to the door when they leave.     =
    *       *       *       *       *=20

[Sidenote: SERVING THE REFRESHMENTS]  The only refreshments necessary are t=
hin bread=20

and butter, and some dainty sandwiches, small cakes and tea with sugar, cre=
am and thin slices of=20

lemon. These things are arranged upon a prettily set table in one corner of=
 the room, and are=20

presided over by the chaperon, who also, when the opportunity affords, move=
s about among the=20

guests, chatting to each and all as if she were in her own drawing-room. If=
 the man has several=20

rooms, one may be opened as a dressing-room in which the women may lay thei=
r wraps. The men=20

guests may leave their coats and hats on the hall table or rack.  When the =
guests depart it is pretty=20

and deferential for the host to thank the women for making his apartment br=
ight and attractive for=20

the=20


_
coupled with the admission that nothing can be more ridiculous or inapplica=
ble, and that one-half=20

of the anagrams in existence are not a whit less absurd. And yet, for this =
piece of absurdity, as=20

well as for another of the same calibre, on--        "His Grace the Duke of=
 Wellington,       "Well=20

fought, K--! no disgrace in thee,"  Mr. Maunder claims the merit of origina=
