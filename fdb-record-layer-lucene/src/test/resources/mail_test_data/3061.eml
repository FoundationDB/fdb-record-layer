rom the Viceroy he=20

could not do otherwise, and that I must believe him to be my truest friend.=
 "Save me from my=20

friends," was an adage quickly proved. I could not procure a cook, neither =
any Romans, and the=20

enlightened administration of the Holy Father. According to Cardinal Grandi=
son, all the great=20

modern improvements in the administration of hospitals and prisons originat=
ed in the eternal city;=20

to my rescue, and sent immediately the promised Turkish soldiers, who were =
to act in the double=20

capacity of escort and servants. They were men of totally opposite characte=
rs. Hadji Achmet was=20

a hardy, powerful, dare-devil-looking Turk, while Hadji Velli was the perfe=
ction of politeness, and=20

as gentle as a lamb. My new allies procured me three donkeys in addition to=
 the necessary=20

baggage camels, and we started from the pleasant garden of Halleem Effendi =
on the evening of=20

the 10th of June for the junction of the Atbara river with the Nile.   CHAP=

were several Englishmen of pith, Sixteen named Thompson, and nineteen named=
 Smith." DON=20

JUAN.  MAHOMET, Achmet, and Ali are equivalent to Smith, Brown, and Thompso=
n. Accordingly,=20

of my few attendants, my dragoman was Mahomet, and my principal guide was A=
chmet; and=20

subsequently I had a number of Alis. Mahomet was a regular Cairo dragoman, =
a native of=20

Dongola, almost black, but exceedingly tenacious regarding his shade of col=
our, which he=20

declared to be light brown. He spoke very bad English, was excessively conc=
eited, and irascible to=20

a degree. No pasha was so bumptious or overbearing to his inferiors, but to=
 me and to his=20

mistress while in Cairo he had the gentleness of the dove, and I had engage=
d him at 5l. per month=20

to accompany me to the White Nile. Men change with circumstances; climate a=
ffects the health=20

and temper; the sleek and well-fed dog is amiable, but he would be vicious =
when thin and hungry;=20

the man in luxury and the man in need are not equally angelic. Now Mahomet =
was one of those=20

dragomen who are accustomed to the civilized expeditions of the British tou=
rist to the first or=20

second cataract, in a Nile boat replete with conveniences and luxuries, upo=
n which the dragoman=20

is monarch supreme, a whale among the minnows, who rules the vessel, purcha=
ses daily a host of=20

unnecessary supplies, upon which he clears his profit, until he returns to =
Cairo with his pockets=20

filled sufficiently to support him until the following Nile season. The sho=
rt three months' harvest,=20

from November until February, fills his system, the reformatory. And yet th=
ese were nothing=20

compared with the achievements of the Pontifical Government in education. I=
n short, complete=20

popular education only existed at Rome. Its schools were more numerous even=
 than its fountains.=20

Gratuitous instruction originated with the ecclesiastics; and from the nigh=
t-school to the university=20

here might be found the perfect type.  =E2=80=9CI really believe,=E2=80=9D =
said the cardinal, =E2=80=9Cthat a more virtuous, a=20

more religious, a more happy and contented people than the Romans never exi=
sted. They could=20

all be kept in order with the police of one of your counties. True it is, t=
he Holy Father is obliged to=20

garrison the city with twelve thousand men of arms, but not against the Rom=
ans, not against his=20

own subjects. It is the secret societies of atheism who have established th=
eir lodges in this city,=20

entirely consisting of foreigners, that render these lamentable precautions=
 necessary. They will not=20

rest until they have extirpated the religious principle from the soul of ma=
n, and until they have=20

reduced him to the condition of wild beasts. But they will fail, as they fa=
iled the other day, as=20

Sennacherib failed. These men may conquer zouaves and cuirassiers, but they=
 cannot fight=20

against Saint Michael and all the angels. They may do mischief, they may ag=
gravate and prolong=20

the misery of man, but they are doomed to entire and eternal failure.=E2=80=
=9D       CHAPTER 65 Lady St.=20

Jerome was much interested in the accounts which the cardinal and Lothair g=
ave her of their=20

excursions in the city and their visits.  =E2=80=9CIt is very true,=E2=80=
=9D she said, =E2=80=9CI never knew such good people;=20

and they ought to be so favored by Heaven, and leading a life which, if any=
 thing earthly can, must=20

give them, however faint, some foretaste of our joys hereafter. Did your em=
inence visit the=20



Pellegrini?=E2=80=9D This was the hospital, where Miss Arundel had found Lo=
thair.  The cardinal looked=20

grave. =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D he replied. =E2=80=9CMy object was to secure f=
or our young friend some interesting but not=20

agitating distraction from certain ideas which, however admirable and trans=
cendently important,=20

are nevertheless too high and profound to permit their constant contemplati=
on with impunity to our=20

infirm natures.=20


_
for the year. Under such circumstances the temper should be angelic. But ti=
mes had changed: the=20

luxurious Mahomet had left the comfortable Nile boat at Korosko, and he had=
 crossed the burning=20

desert upon a jolting camel; he had left the well-known route where the dra=
goman was supreme,=20

and he found himself among people who treated him in the light of a common =
servant. "A change=20

came o'er the spirit of his dream;" Mahomet was no longer a great man, and =
his temper changed=20

with circumstances; in fact, Mahomet became unbearable, and still he was ab=
solutely necessary,=20

as he was the tongue of the expedition until we should accomplish Arabic. T=
o him the very idea of=20

exploration was an absurdity; he had never believed in it from the first, a=
nd he now became=20

impressed with the fact that he was positively committed to an undertaking =
that would end most=20

likely in his death, if not in terrible difficulties; he determined, under =
the circumstances, to make=20

himself as disagreeable as possible to all parties. With this amiable resol=
ution Mahomet adopted a=20

physical infirmity in the shape of deafness; in reality, no one was more ac=
ute in hearing, but as=20

there are no bells where there are no houses, he of course could not answer=
 such a summons,=20

and he was compelled to attend to the call of his own name--"Mahomet! Mahom=
et!" No reply,=20

although the individual was sitting within a few feet, apparently absorbed =
in the contemplation of=20

his own boots. "Mahomet!" with an additional emphasis upon the second sylla=
ble. Again no=20

response. "Mahomet, you rascal, why don't you answer?" This energetic addre=
ss would effect a=20

change in in a lower, but still distinct tone, =E2=80=9CI was myself unwill=
ing to visit in a mere casual manner=20

the scene of what I must consider the greatest event of this century.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CBut you have been there?=E2=80=9D=20

inquired Lady St. Jerome.  His eminence crossed himself.  In the course of =
the evening=20

Monsignore Catesby told Lothair that a grand service was about to be celebr=
ated in the church of=20

St. George: thanks were to be offered to the Blessed Virgin by Miss Arundel=
 for the miraculous=20

mercy vouchsafed to her in saving the life of a countryman, Lothair. =E2=80=
=9CAll her friends will make a=20

point of being there,=E2=80=9D added the monsignore, =E2=80=9Ceven the Prot=
estants and some Russians. Miss=20

Arundel was very unwilling at first to fulfil this office, but the Holy Fat=
her has commanded it. I know=20

that nothing will induce her to ask you to attend; and yet, if I were you, =
I would turn it over in your=20

mind. I know she said that she would sooner that you were present than all =
her English friends=20

together. However, you can think about it. One likes to do what is proper.=
=E2=80=9D  One does; and yet it is=20

difficult. Sometimes, in doing what we think proper, we get into irremediab=
le scrapes; and often,=20

what we hold to be proper, society in its caprice resolves to be highly imp=
roper.  Lady St. Jerome=20

had wished Lothair to see Tivoli, and they were all consulting together whe=
n they might go there.=20

Lord St. Jerome who, besides his hunters, had his drag at Rome, wanted to d=
rive them to the=20

place. Lothair sat opposite Miss Arundel, gazing on her beauty. It was like=
 being at Vauxe again.=20

And yet a great deal had happened since they were at Vauxe; and what? So fa=
r=20


_
mild and lamb-like dragoman of Cairo would suddenly start from the ground, =
tear his own hair from=20

his head in handfuls, and shout, "Mahomet! Mahomet! Mahomet! always Mahomet=
! D--n=20

Mahomet! I wish he were dead, or back in Cairo, this brute Mahomet!" The ir=
ascible dragoman=20

would then beat his own head unmercifully with his fists, in a paroxysm of =
rage.  To comfort him I=20

could only exclaim, "Well done, Mahomet! thrash him; pommel him well; punch=
 his head; you=20

know him best; he deserves it; don't spare him!" This what should create or=
 confirm relations of=20

confidence and affection. Whatever may have been the influence of others on=
 his existence, hers=20

at least had been one of infinite benignity. She had saved his life; she ha=
d cherished it. She had=20

raised him from the lowest depth of physical and moral prostration to healt=
h and comparative=20

serenity. If at Vauxe he had beheld her with admiration, had listened with =
fascinated interest to the=20

fervid expression of her saintly thoughts, and the large purposes of her he=
roic mind,=20


_
natural perversity of his disposition, generally soothed him, and he ceased=
 punching his head.=20

This man was entirely out of his place, if not out of his mind, at certain =
moments, and having upon=20

one occasion smashed a basin by throwing it in the face of the cook, and up=
on another occasion=20

narrowly escaped homicide, by throwing an axe at a man's head, which missed=
 by an inch, he=20

became a notorious character in the little expedition.  We left Berber in t=
he evening at sunset; we=20

were mounted upon he had witnessed her lofty and consecrated spirit in acti=
on, and when that=20

action in his own case had only been exercised for his ineffable advantage.=
  =E2=80=9CYour uncle cannot go=20

to-morrow,=E2=80=9D continued Lady St. Jerome, =E2=80=9Cand on Thursday I a=
m engaged.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd on Friday=E2=80=94,=E2=80=9D said=20

Miss Arundel, hesitating.  =E2=80=9CWe are all engaged,=E2=80=9D said Lady =
St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI should hardly wish to go=20

out before Friday anywhere,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel, speaking to her aun=
t, and in a lower tone.  Friday=20

was the day on which the=20


_
donkeys, while our Turkish attendants rode upon excellent dromedaries that =
belonged to their=20

regiment of irregular cavalry. As usual, when ready to start, Mahomet was t=
he last; he had piled a=20

huge mass of bags and various luggage upon his donkey, that almost obscured=
 the animal, and=20

he sat mounted upon this pinnacle dressed in gorgeous clothes, with a brace=
 of handsome pistols=20

in his belt, and his gun slung across his shoulders. Upon my remonstrating =
with him upon the=20

cruelty of thus overloading the donkey, he flew into a fit of rage, and cel=
ebrated in the Jesuit=20

church of St. George of Cappadocia. Lothair knew this well enough and was e=
mbarrassed: a=20

thanksgiving for the mercy vouchsafed to Miss Arundel in saving the life of=
 a fellow-countryman,=20

an that fellow-countryman not present! All her Protestant friends would be =
there, and some=20

Russians. And he not there! It seemed, on his part, the most ungracious and=
 intolerable conduct.=20

And he knew that she would prefer his presence to that of all her acquainta=
nces together. It was=20

more than ungracious on his part; it was ungrateful,=20
