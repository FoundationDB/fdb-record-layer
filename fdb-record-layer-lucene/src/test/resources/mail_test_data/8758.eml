philodendron monstera it was. There's only one thing to do."  "What's that?=
" asked Sam.  "Try and find out what it was."  "How can we?"  "Well, I've g=
ot two plans. One is to make another trip on the other side of the mountain=
, and go farther next time. We can search for some sort of a camp."  "And t=
he other plan?" asked Will.  "Is to keep watch, and see if same is a perfec=
t man, and able also to bridle the whole body:" Just as a doctor looks at t=
he tongue and can tell the condition of the bodily health, so a man's words=
 are an index of what is within. Truth will spring from a good heart: false=
hood and deceit from a corrupt heart. When Ananias kept back part of the pr=
ice of the land, philodendron monstera it was. There's only one thing to do=
."  "What's that?" asked Sam.  "Try and find out what it was."  "How can we=
?"  "Well, I've got two plans. One is to make another trip on the other sid=
e of the mountain, and go farther next time. We can search for some sort of=
 a camp."  "And the other plan?" asked Will.  "Is to keep watch, and see if=
 same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body:" Just as a =

 so a man's words are an index of what is within. Truth will spring from a =
good heart: falsehood and deceit from a corrupt heart. When Ananias kept ba=
ck part of the price of the land, _
here, and they end over there, as if they had dropped down from the clouds =
and had gone up=20

again on the back of the big bird."  Jack looked more thoughtful. As Sam ha=
d said, there were no=20

marks of the men coming or going, and they could not have reached the level=
 place, nor departed=20

from it, without leaving some marks in the tell-tale snow.  "I give it up!"=
 exclaimed Jack. "Let's get=20

back to camp. It's getting late."  They started, talking of nothing on the =
way but the mystery, and=20

becoming more and more tangled the more they discussed it.  It was getting =
dusk when they came=20

in sight of the camp fire, and they saw Budge and the Indian busy at someth=
ing to one side of the=20

blaze.  "I wonder what they're up to now?" said Jack.  "Oh, probably Budge =
is teaching Long Gun=20

how to chew gum," was Nat's opinion.  A moment later something happened. Bu=
dge seemed to=20

shoot through the air, as if blown up in an explosion. He shot over the top=
 of a small tree, and=20

coming down on the other side, hung suspended by one foot.  "Help me down! =
Help me down!" he=20

cried.  "What's the matter?" called Jack, spurring his horse forward.  "I'm=
 caught!" answered=20

Budge.  "It certainly does look so," spoke Nat, and he could not refrain fr=
om laughing at the odd=20

spectacle Budge presented as he hung by one leg in a rope that was fast to =
the top of a tree,=20

which bent like a bow with his weight.  "Take me down!" wailed the unfortun=
ate one.  "How did it=20

happen?" asked Sam.  "Long Gun made a spring trap," gasped Budge, "and--and=
----"  "And you=20

wanted to try it," finished Jack, as he went to his chum's aid.     CHAPTER=
 XXVII  ORDERED=20

BACK   "Hurry up and get me down!" pleaded Budge, as he tried to grasp the =
sapling with his=20

hands, to ease the strain on his foot.  "I'm coming," replied Jack, who was=
 laughing heartily.=20

"Guess I'll have to cut the tree down, though."  "No; I have a better plan =
than that," spoke Will. "I'll=20

show you."  In another moment he was climbing up the thin trunk of the hick=
ory that served to hold=20

Budge Rankin suspended. Then Will's plan was apparent. As he climbed up far=
ther, his weight,=20

added to that of Budge, caused the sapling to sway toward the ground.  "Gra=
b me and cut the=20

rope!" cried Budge.  "All right," replied Jack, and when his queer chum was=
 near enough to him,=20

Jack seized him around the waist. Nat, with his hunting knife, severed the =
thongs of deer sinew=20

from which Long Gun had made the loop. Then Budge was released, and he assu=
med an upright=20

position on the ground, while Will dropped from the bending tree, which str=
aightway sprang back=20

to its place.  "Hu!" grunted Long Gun, with just the it must be trustworthy=
. Words must command=20

confidence. Anything which undermines the truth takes (as it were) the mort=
ar out of the building=20

and if general, must mean ruin. Paul said--"Wherefore putting away lying, s=
peak every man truth=20

to his neighbor: for we are members one of another." Note the reason given-=
-"we are members=20

one of another." All community, all union and fellowship would be shattered=
 if a man did not know=20

whether to believe his neighbor or not.  The transgressions of this command=
ment are very varied=20

in form, and very frequent. Men and women of all ages have to guard against=
 them. They include=20

some of the most besetting sins. David said in his haste--"All men are liar=
s." Some one has=20

remarked that if he had been living nowadays, he might say it without haste=
 and not be very far=20

wide of the truth.  PERJURY.  The bearing of false witness is forbidden, bu=
t this must not be=20

limited merely to testimony given in the law court or under oath. Isn't it =
a condemnation that men=20

have to be put under oath in order to make sure of their speaking the truth=
? As a legal offence,=20

_perjury_--the bearing of false witness when under oath--is one of the most=
 serious crimes that=20

can be committed. Nearly every civilized nation visits it with heavy punish=
ment. Unless promptly=20

checked, it would shake the very foundations of justice.  _Lying_--uttering=
 or acting falsehood--and=20



_slander_--the spreading of false reports tending to destroy the reputation=
 of another--are two of=20

the most common violations of this commandment.  LYING.  We have got nowada=
ys so that we=20

divide lies into white lies and black lies, society lies, business lies, et=
c. The Word of God knows no=20

such letting-down of the standard. A lie is a lie, no matter what are the c=
ircumstances under which=20

it is uttered, or by whom. I have heard that in Siam they sew up the mouth =
of a confirmed liar. I am=20

afraid if that was the custom in America, a good many would suffer. Parents=
 should begin with=20

their children while they are young and teach them to be strictly truthful =
at all times. There is a=20

proverb: "A lie has no legs." It requires other lies to support it. Tell on=
e lie and you are forced to tell=20

others to back it up.  SLANDER.  You don't like to have any one bear false =
witness against you, or=20

help to ruin your character or reputation: then why should you do it to oth=
ers? How public men are=20

slandered in this country! None escape, whether good or bad. Judgment is pa=
ssed upon them,=20

their family, their character, by the press and by individuals who know lit=
tle or nothing about them.=20

If one tenth that is said and written about our public men=20


_
copper-colored face. "Boy go up heap fast."  "'Sright," admitted Budge, whi=
le he began hunting=20

through his pockets for a piece of gum.  "What in the world did you ever pu=
t your foot in that trap=20

for?" asked Jack, when it was ascertained that Budge had not been injured. =
 "Well," he said, "I'll=20

tell you. You see, I asked Long Gun to show me how to make a murder." Sland=
erers are=20

compared to flies that always settle on sores, but do not touch a man's goo=
d parts.  If the=20

archangel Gabriel should come down to earth and mix in human affairs, I bel=
ieve his character=20

would be assailed inside of forty-eight hours. Slander called Christ a glut=
tonous man and a=20

winebibber. He claimed to be the Truth, but instead of=20


_
back home. He showed me, and made one. But it didn't look to me as if it wo=
uld work. So I just=20

touched the trigger with my foot, and--and----"  "We saw the rest," finishe=
d Bony. "Cracky! But I=20

thought at first you were giving us an exhibition of a human skyrocket."  "=
Or trying to imitate the=20

gigantic bird that left the marks in the snow," added Sam. "Let's tell Budg=
e about it."  Which they=20

did; and as Him, men took Him and crucified Him.  When any one spoke evil o=
f another in the=20

presence of Peter the Great, he used promptly to stop him, and say:  "Well,=
 now, has he not got a=20

bright side? Tell me what you know good of him. It is easy to splash mud, b=
ut I would rather help a=20

man to keep his coat clean."  I need not stop to run through the whole cata=
logue of sins that are=20

related to these three.=20


_
conclusions, Jack asked him what he thought it was that had made the myster=
ious prints in the=20

snow.  "It must have been a roc, one of those birds you read about in the '=
Arabian Nights,'"=20

declared Budge.  "There never were such birds," objected Jack.  "Sure there=
 were," declared=20

Budge. "It says so in the book."  "No one ever saw one," objected Sam.  "No=
, and you never saw=20

George Washington," spoke Budge quickly. "But you're sure he was here once,=
 ain't you?"  "This=20

is different," remarked Bony.  "'Sallright. You'll find that's a big bird, =
like a roc," declared Budge,=20

while he began to help the Indian get supper.  They discussed, until quite =
late that night, the cause=20

of the mysterious noises they had heard, and also what peculiar bird or bea=
st had had the struggle=20

with the men. Then Jack finally declared:  --insinuation--gossip--equivocat=
ion--holding back of the=20

truth when it is due and right to tell it--disparagement--perversion of mea=
ning: these are common=20

transgressions of this ninth commandment, differing in form and degree of g=
uilt according to the=20

motive or manner of their expression. They bear false witness against a man=
 before the tribunal of=20

public opinion--a court whose judgment none of us escape. As so much of our=
 life is passed in=20

public view, any untruth that leads to a false judgment is a grievous wrong=
.  A TEST OF TRUE=20

RELIGION.  Government of the tongue is made the test of true religion by Ja=
mes. "If any man=20

among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth =
his own heart, this=20

man's religion is vain. . . . For in many things we offend all. If any man =
offend not in word,=20
