Know the corresponding numbers of the fundamental principle of every element and its sub-

elements, learn their interaction and behaviour on the occult side of manifesting Nature, and the 

law of correspondences will lead you to the discovery of the greatest mysteries of macrocosmical 

life.  But to cardinal, raising his hands clasped toward her, exclaimed, "Ah, madame, madame, 

how little you know me, mon Dieu!"  But Queen Henrietta, without even turning toward him who 

made these hypocritical pretensions, crossed the cabinet, opened the door for herself and passing

_i.e._, you must study MAN, the microcosm--in this case as physical science does--inductively, 

proceeding from particulars to universals. At the same time, however, since a key-note is required 

to analyze and comprehend any combination of differentiations of sound, we must never lose sight 

of the Platonic method, which starts with one general view of all, and descends from the universal 

to the individual. This is the method adopted in Mathematics--the only _exact_ science that exists 

in our day.  Let us study Man, therefore; but if we separate him for one moment from the Universal 

Whole, or view him in isolation, from a single aspect, apart from the "Heavenly Man"--the Universe 

symbolized by Adam Kadmon or his equivalents in every Philosophy--we shall either land in Black 

Magic or fail most ingloriously in our attempt.  Thus the mystic sentence, "_Om Mani Padme 

Hum_," when courtiers eager to pay homage, the luxurious show of a competing royalty, she went 

and took the hand of De Winter, who stood apart in isolation. Poor queen, already fallen! Though 

all bowed before her, as etiquette required, she had now but a single arm on which she could lean. 

"It signifies little," said Mazarin, when he was alone. "It gave me pain and it was an ungracious 

part to play, but I have said nothing either to the one or to the other. Bernouin!"  Bernouin entered. 

"See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair, who was with me just now, is still 

in the palace."  Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges, who was on guard.  "Your 

eminence," said Comminges, "as I was re-conducting the young man for whom you have asked, 

he approached the glass door of the gallery, and gazed intently upon some object, doubtless the 

picture by Raphael, which

instead of being composed of the almost meaningless words, "Oh the Jewel in the Lotus," 

contains a reference to this indissoluble union between Man and the Universe, rendered in seven 

different ways, and having the capability of seven different applications to the stairs. I believe I saw 

him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court. But is not your eminence going to the queen?" 

"For what purpose?"  "Monsieur de Guitant, my uncle, has just told me that her majesty had 

received news of the army."  "It is well; I

and action.  From whatever aspect we examine it, it means: "I am that I am": "I am in thee and 

thou art in me." In this conjunction and close union the good and pure man becomes a God. 

Whether consciously or unconsciously, he will bring about, or innocently cause to happen, 

unavoidable results. In the first case, if an Initiate (of course an Adept of the Right-hand Path 

alone is meant), he  Comminges had seen rightly, and Mordaunt had really acted as he had 

related. In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery, he perceived De Winter, who was 

waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation.  At this sight the young man stopped short, 

not in admiration of Raphael's picture, but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object. His 

eyes dilated and a
