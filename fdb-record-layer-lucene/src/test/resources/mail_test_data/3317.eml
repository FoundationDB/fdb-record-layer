from the accounts of its own pillage rendered by the Federal Reserve System=

lobbyists who ever enchained a people's industry log-rolled through a piece=

alone pouched on it a profit varying from 211 to 83 per cent! That's the re=
cord and those are the=20

facts--hidden and concealed from you and draped in a mantle of silence. Fed=

Federal Reserve propaganda, Federal Reserve publicity--all paid for from yo=
ur money--is too=20

astute to "toot" anent this legalized sandbaggery. Do you, the stockholders=

greed of Federal Reserve sandbaggery? If the law--cleverly lobbied through =

 this in your brainery and=20

look further.  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote 1: The average paid in capital for 192=
0 was $94,234,000=20

and total net earnings were $151,408,031. This is 160.7% profit and so stat=
ed on pages 153 and=20

154 of Federal Reserve Bulletin of February, 1921. When the net average of =
the individual banks=20

are footed and colony remained untouched. Uncas and Ninigret continued frie=
ndly; even the=20

Narragansets, in spite of so many former provocations, had not yet taken up=
 arms. But they were=20

strongly suspected of intention to do so, and were accused by Uncas of givi=
ng, notwithstanding=20

their recent assurances, aid and shelter to the hostile tribes.  An attempt=
 had lately been made to=20

revive the union of the New England colonies. At a meeting of commissioners=
, on September 9,=20

1675, those from Plymouth presented a narrative of the origin and progress =
of the present=20

hostilities. Upon the strength of this narrative the war was pronounced =E2=
=80=9Cjust and necessary,=E2=80=9D and a=20

resolution was passed to carry it on at the joint expense, and to raise for=
 that purpose a thousand=20

men, one-half to be mounted dragoons. If the Narragansets were not crushed =
during the winter, it=20

was feared they might break out openly hostile in the spring; and at a subs=
equent meeting a=20

thousand men were ordered to be levied to co-operate in an expedition speci=
ally against them.=20

The winter was unfavorable to the Indians; the leafless woods no longer con=
cealed their lurking=20

attacks. The frozen surface of the swamps made the Indian fastnesses access=
ible to the colonists.=20

The forces destined to act against the Narragansets--six companies from Mas=
sachusetts, under=20

Major Appleton; two from Plymouth, under Major Bradford; and five from Conn=
ecticut, under Major=20

Treat--were placed under the command of Josiah Winslow, Governor of Plymout=
h since Prince=E2=80=99s=20

death--son of that Edward Winslow so conspicuous in the earlier history of =
the colony. In=20



December the Massachusetts and Plymouth forces marched to Petasquamscot, on=
 the west shore=20

of Narragansett Bay, where they made some forty prisoners. Being joined by =
the troops from=20

Connecticut, and guided by an Indian deserter, after a march of fifteen mil=
es through a deep snow,=20

they approached a swamp in what is now the town of South Kingston, one of t=
he ancient=20

strongholds of the Narragansets. Driving the Indian scouts before them, and=
 penetrating the=20

swamp, the colonial soldiers soon came in sight of the Indian fort, built o=
n a rising ground in the=20

morass, a sort of island of two or three acres, fortified by a palisade, an=
d surrounded by a close=20

hedge a rod thick. There was but one entrance, quite narrow, defended by a =
tree thrown across it,=20

with a block-house of logs in front and another on the flank. It=20


_
Reservists--not us--to explain.]     CHAPTER IV  THE STUFFING OF THE LEVIAT=
HAN   YOU=20

have seen the framework and skeleton of the monster--the commandeering of t=
he capital for the=20

operation of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks in each one of the satrapies.=
 You have seen that=20

the Federal Reserve oligarchs not only never put up one thin dime of their =
own for the capital for=20

their System but obtained that capital--practically in perpetuity--at a pal=
try 6 per cent interest or=20

dividend charge. This capital would naturally fluctuate somewhat--but ever =
upward--as new=20

National Banks were commandeered into the jack-pot. By January 1, 1922, the=
 paid-in capital=20

legally sandbagged into the twelve regional Shylockeries was as follows:   =
 Boston=20

$7,935,500   New York          27,114,000   Philadelphia       8,736,500   =
Cleveland         11,134,000=20

Richmond           5,428,500   Atlanta            4,189,500   Chicago      =
     14,307,000   St. Louis=20

4,603,000   Minneapolis        3,569,000   Kansas City        4,570,000   D=
allas             4,203,000=20

San Francisco      7,374,500                   ------------   Total        =
   $103,165,000  This is the=20

assembled capital commandeered from National Banks in each one of the Feder=
al Reserve=20

satrapies. This is the framework or skeleton of the leviathan. Observe now =
how adroitly by another=20

provision of the Federal Reserve legal grabbery and graftery this skeleton =
is stuffed and over-

stuffed. A bank without depositors would be like a railroad without shipper=
s, a store without=20

customers, a hotel without guests or a doctor without patients--a mere expe=
nse account. But the=20

same astuteness which could commandeer into its maw over a hundred millions=
 of capital wouldn't=20

falter for lack of deposits--you know that. If the Federal Reserve System c=
ould--as it could--

commandeer capital, couldn't it commandeer and conscript deposits? Certainl=
y it could and=20

certainly it did. Every National Bank in the United States is compelled to =
carry in the Federal=20

Reserve Bank in its satrapy or dependency a reserve account, i.e., the amou=
nt of money which=20

the law compels it to carry in its reserve against its deposit liabilities.=
 That sum of money is of=20

course enormous and at this writing at the close of business on May 10, 192=
2, amounts to the=20

stupendous sum of $1,806,464,000! This is the mightiest mound of massed dep=
osits on this=20

planet. And every dollar of that gigantic sum has been conscripted and comm=
andeered into the=20

hands of Federal Reserve oligarchs--without the capital investment on their=
 part of one penny for=20

its security! By a few strokes of a pen or taps of a typewriter Midas was m=
ade a piker, Aladdin's=20

lamp was made but a tallow dip and Croesus was made a small change artist. =
What generations=20

of toil and astute commercialism couldn't accomplish in centuries in the ba=
nking business adept=20

Federal Reserve oligarchical lobbyists could accomplish--and did accomplish=
--by a few pen=20

strokes! You don't know which to admire most--their supernal gall or their =
astute lobbying ability!=20

But hang your cap of admiration on either horn of the dilemma which you cho=
ose you find the=20

mightiest single mass of money on this planet swept into Federal Reserve co=
ffers without toil,=20

without effort, without one penny of capital contributed by them and withou=
t one scintilla of ability=20

proven by them--except the ability of accomplished and astute lobbyists!  B=
ut did they stop there--

after commandeering over $100,000,000 of capital and after conscripting ove=
r $1,800,000,000 of=20

deposits? Little you know those birds if you think it. After they had got t=
heir beaks into that capital=20

and their claws firmly fixed on those deposits they spread their wings and =
took a financial flight=20

hitherto absolutely untried--even by the boldest buzzardry of finance. Here=
 it is, scan it, take a look=20

at it. For generations of banking the reserve deposits of banks have always=
 drawn a minimum rate=20

of at least 2 per cent per annum. Why? Because of their size and because of=
 their stability.=20



Experience of generations had demonstrated the fairness and the wisdom of t=
hat usage. Reserve=20

deposits rarely fluctuate--except upwards.  But at a few strokes of a pen F=
ederal Reserve=20

oligarchs reversed the custom of generations and _conscripted this mass of =
deposits--the largest=20

on earth--into their coffers without interest_! Tie a towel about your thro=
bbing brow so that you=20

won't get dizzy, seize your trusty pencil and "figger" a moment. You will f=
ind that on this one item=20

alone at 2 per cent interest on $1,800,000,000 Federal Reserve satrapists a=
nd oligarchs and=20

legalized tyrants sweep just $36,000,000 a year into their profit pouch. It=
's $36,000,000 a year that=20

National Banks and their stockholders and their depositors used to get that=
 they don't get and that=20

Federal Reserve predacity does get! If you and a few hundred of your friend=
s could, by astute=20

lobbying ability, get the titanic sum of $1,800,000,000 placed in your hand=
s, the =E2=80=9CLord=E2=80=99s day,=E2=80=9D but=20

that did not hinder the attack. As the captains advanced at the heads of th=
eir companies, the=20

Indians opened a galling fire, under which many fell. But the assailants pr=
essed on, and forced the=20

entrance. A desperate struggle ensued. The colonists were once driven back,=
 but they rallied and=20

returned to the charge, and, after a two hours=E2=80=99 fight, became maste=
rs of the fort. Fire was put to=20

the wigwams, near six hundred in number, and all the horrors of the Pequot =
massacre were=20

renewed. The corn and other winter stores of the Indians were consumed, and=
 not a few of the old=20

men, women, and children perished in the flames. In this bloody contest, lo=
ng remembered as the=20

=E2=80=9CSwamp Fight,=E2=80=9D the colonial loss was terribly severe. Six c=
aptains, with two hundred and thirty=20

men, were killed or wounded; and at night, in the midst of a snow-storm; wi=
th a fifteen miles=E2=80=99=20

march before them, the colonial soldiers abandoned the fort, of which the I=
ndians resumed=20

possession. But their wigwams were burned; their provisions destroyed; they=
 had no supplies for=20

the winter; their loss was irreparable. Of those who survived the fight, ma=
ny perished of hunger.=20

Even as a question of policy, this attack on the Narragansets was more than=
 doubtful. The starving=20

and infuriated warriors, scattered through the woods, revenged themselves b=
y attacks on the=20

frontier settlements. On February 10, 1676, Lancaster was burned, and forty=
 of the inhabitants=20

killed or taken; among the rest, Mrs. Rolandson, wife of the minister, the =
narrative of whose=20

captivity is still preserved. Groton, Chelmsford, and other towns in that v=
icinity were repeatedly=20

attacked. Medfield, twenty miles from Boston, was furiously assaulted, and,=
 though defended by=20

three hundred men, half the houses were burned. Weymouth, within eighteen m=
iles of Boston,=20

was attacked a few days after. These were the nearest approaches which the =
Indians made to that=20

capital. For a time the neighborhood of the Narraganset country was abandon=
ed. The Rhode=20

Island towns, though they had no part in undertaking the war, yet suffered =
the consequences of it.=20

In March, Warwick was burned, and Providence was partially destroyed. Most =
of the inhabitants=20

sought refuge in the islands, but the aged Roger Williams accepted a commis=
sion as captain for=20

the defence of the town he had founded. Walter Clarke was presently chosen =
governor in=20

Coddington=E2=80=99s place, the times not suiting a Quaker chief magistrate=
.  The whole colony of=20

Plymouth was overrun. Houses were burned in almost every town, but the inha=
bitants, for the=20

most part, saved themselves in their garrisons, a shelter with which all th=
e towns now found it=20

necessary to be provided. On March 26 Captain Pierce, with fifty men and so=
me friendly Indians,=20

while endeavoring to cover the Plymouth towns, fell into an ambush and was =
cut off. That same=20

day, Marlborough was set on fire; two days after Rehoboth was burned. The I=
ndians seemed to be=20

everywhere. On April 18 Captain Wadsworth, marching to the relief of Sudbur=
y, fell into an=20



ambush, and perished with fifty men. The alarm and terror of the colonists =
reached again a great=20

height. But affairs were about to take a turn. The resources of the Indians=
 were exhausted; they=20

were now making their last efforts.  A body of Connecticut volunteers, unde=
r Captain Denison, and=20

of Mohegan and other friendly Indians, Pequots and Niantics, swept the enti=
re country of the=20

Narragansets, who suffered, as spring advanced, the last extremities of fam=
ine. Canonchet, the=20

chief sachem, said to have been a son of Miantonimoh, but probably his neph=
ew, had ventured to=20

his old haunts to procure seed-corn with which to plant the rich intervals =
on the Connecticut,=20

abandoned by the colonists. Taken prisoner, he conducted himself with all t=
hat haughty firmness=20

esteemed by the Indians the height of magnanimity. Being offered his life o=
n condition of bringing=20

about a peace, he scorned the proposal. His tribe would perish to the last =
man rather than become=20

servants to the English. When ordered to prepare for death, he replied, =E2=
=80=9CI like it well; I shall die=20

before my heart is soft, or I shall have spoken anything unworthy of myself=
.=E2=80=9D Two Indians were=20

appointed to shoot him, and his head was cut off and sent to Hartford.  The=
 colonists had suffered=20

severely. Men, women, and children had perished by the bullets of the India=
ns, or fled naked=20

through the wintry woods by the light of their blazing houses, leaving thei=
r goods and cattle a spoil=20

to the assailants. Several settlements had been destroyed, and many more ha=
d been abandoned;=20

but the oldest and wealthiest remained untouched. The Indians, on the other=
 hand, had neither=20

provisions nor ammunition. On May 12, while attempting to plant corn and ca=
tch fish at Montague=20

Falls, on the Connecticut River, they were attacked with great slaughter by=
 the garrison of the=20

lower towns, led by Captain Turner, a Boston Baptist, and at first refused =
a commission on that=20

account, but as danger=20


_
in perpetuity, without interest, you could do quite a bit with it, couldn't=
 you? You could, as do those=20

Federal Reserve oligarchs, wield the mightiest scepter of power which ever =
ruled man. And you=20

could do it with "other people's money"--every penny of it--just as they do=
 and you could do it=20

without the investment of a penny of your own--just as they do it!  Here th=
ey are: the Federal=20

Reserve Board at Washington, really a Central Bank, dominating and domineer=
ing over the whole=20

Federal Reserve System; the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, each one dominati=
ng and=20

domineering over its own zone or regional satrapy; the commandeered and con=
scripted National=20

Banks in each satrapy and finally their stockholders and depositors--workin=
g and toiling--at the=20

base of the pyramid!  You have seen the birth of the Federal Reserve monste=
r, you have seen the=20

skeleton or framework of the monster and you have seen the stuffing of the =
monster. The Invisible=20

Empire were the accomplished accoucheurs at its Congressional birth; they c=
onscripted the=20

capital, the framework of the monster; they commandeered the stuffing, the =
leviathan deposits, for=20

the monster; it is in their keeping and now what do they do with it, whom d=
o they "do" and how do=20

they do it? Keep right on reading and you will find out.     CHAPTER V  CHE=
CK COLLECTION=20

BANDITRY   YOU have seen the birth of the monster; you have seen how it con=
scripted its capital=20

at a petty six per cent interest rate; you have seen how it commandeered--a=
t no interest rate--the=20

mightiest mass of deposits ever gathered together on earth and you have see=
n how it did these=20

things by its absolute control over the money and over the destinies of the=
 National Banks in the=20

United States. It could and it did and it does practically control their af=
fairs.  But it could not--except=20

by intimidation, by oppression or by practical banditry--control the State =
Banks of the United=20

States. It could not legislate them into its sheep pen for shearing, but it=
 could attempt to intimidate,=20

bulldoze and banditize them. This it attempted to do in this wise:  One of =
the chief specialties of=20

this Federal Reserve System of applied banditry is to attempt to force ever=
y bank in the United=20

States--whether a member of its Shylockery or not--to collect checks for it=
s benefit and advantage=20

for nothing. In other words, where it couldn't conscript nor commandeer--pu=
rely for its own sordid=20

profit--it proceeded to bulldoze.  There are just two ways to collect money=
 on accept it. Yet this=20

enterprise was not without its drawbacks. As the troops returned, Captain T=
urner fell into an=20

ambush and was slain, with thirty-eight men. Hadley was attacked on a lectu=
re day, June 12, while=20

the people were at meeting; but the Indians were repulsed by the bravery of=
 Goffe, one of the=20

fugitive regicides, long concealed in that town. Seeing this venerable unkn=
own man come to their=20

rescue, and then suddenly disappear, the inhabitants took him for an angel.=
  Major Church, at the=20

head of a body of two hundred volunteers, English and Indians, energeticall=
y hunted down the=20

hostile bands in Plymouth colony. The interior tribes about Mount Wachusett=
 were invaded and=20

subdued by a force of six hundred men, raised for that purpose. Many fled t=
o the north to find=20

refuge in Canada--guides and leaders, in after years, of those French and I=
ndian war parties by=20

which the frontiers of New England were so terribly harassed. Just a year a=
fter the fast at the=20

commencement of the war, a thanksgiving was observed for success in it.  No=
 longer sheltered by=20

the River Indians, who now began to make their peace, and even attacked by =
bands of the=20

Mohawks, Philip returned to his own country, about Mount Hope, where he was=
 still faithfully=20

supported by his female confederate and relative, Witamo, squaw sachem of P=
ocasset. Punham,=20

also, the Shawomet vassal of Massachusetts, still zealously carried on the =
war, but was presently=20

killed. Philip was watched and followed by Church, who surprised his camp o=
n August 1st, killed=20



upward of a hundred of his people, and took prisoners his wife and boy. The=
 disposal of this child=20

was a subject of much deliberation. Several of the elders were urgent for p=
utting him to death. It=20

was finally resolved to send him to Bermuda, to be sold into slavery--a fat=
e to which many other of=20

the Indian captives were subjected. Witamo shared the disasters of Philip. =
Most of her people=20

were killed or taken. She herself was drowned while crossing a river in her=
 flight; but her body was=20

recovered, and the head, cut off, was stuck upon a pole at Taunton, amid th=
e jeers and scoffs of=20

the colonial soldiers, and the tears and lamentations of the Indian prisone=
rs.  Philip still lurked in=20

the swamps, but was now reduced to extremity. Again attacked by Church, he =
was killed by one of=20

his own people, a deserter to the colonists. His dead body was beheaded and=
 quartered, the=20

sentence of the English law upon traitors. One of his hands was given to=20


_
them at the counter of the bank on which they are drawn and getting the cas=
h and the other by=20

sending them through the mail for remittance by draft drawn on some large c=
ity depository. The=20

latter method obtains in 99 per cent of the hundreds of millions of checks =
drawn. The bank upon=20

which the appointed for a public thanksgiving, his head was carried in triu=
mph to Plymouth.  The=20

popular rage against the Indians was excessive. Death or slavery was the pe=

ederal Reserve System,=20

with its customary greed, insists upon sandbagging this service for nothing=
. This arrogant rule--

purely for its own sordid profit--it could and did and does enforce against=
 its conscripted and=20

commandeered National Banks. But State Banks--not wearing the Federal Reser=
ve yoke of=20

bondage--were at liberty to make the usual collection charge of one tenth o=
f one per cent.=20

Thereupon the Federal Reserve System had a series of fits and foundation fo=
r sentence of death,=20

and that, too, notwithstanding they had intimated an opinion that the origi=
n of the war would not=20

bear examination. The other captives who fell into the hands of the colonis=
ts were distributed=20

among them as ten-year servants. Roger Williams received a boy for his shar=
e. Many chiefs were=20

executed at Boston and Plymouth on the charge of rebellion; among others, C=
aptain Tom, chief of=20

the Christian Indians at Natick, and Tispiquin, a noted warrior, reputed to=
 be invulnerable, who had=20

surrendered to Church on an implied promise of safety. A large body of Indi=
ans, assembled at=20

Dover to treat=20

fell into them. From an enormous number of its banditries three typical one=
s are selected for your=20

observation--merely straws showing whence blow the most arrogant winds of o=
ppression.  First=20

take a look at the Cones State Bank of Pierce, Nebraska. "I don't want a sm=
ug lot of experts to sit=20

down behind closed doors in Washington and play Providence to me." That is =
what President=20

Wilson said--on page 60 of his book, "The New Freedom"--before he, himself,=
 was sitting tight=20

"behind closed doors in Washington."  That is just exactly how Wood Cones, =
president of the=20

Cones State Bank of Pierce, Nebraska, feels about a smug coterie of banking=
 oligarchs known as=20

the Federal Reserve Board at Washington and the Federal Reserve Bank at Oma=
ha, Nebraska.=20

First, read the subjoined affidavit about "hard boiled and armed" Federal W=
aldron, who=20

commanded there. Some two hundred of these Indians, claimed as fugitives fr=
om Massachusetts,=20

were sent by water to Boston, where some were hanged, and the rest shipped =
off to be sold as=20

slaves. Some fishermen of Marblehead having been killed by the Indians at t=
he eastward, the=20

women of that town, as they came out of meeting on a Sunday, fell upon two =
Indian prisoners who=20

had just been brought in, and murdered them on the spot. The same ferocious=
 spirit of revenge=20

which governed the contemporaneous conduct of Berkeley in Virginia toward t=
hose concerned in=20

Bacon=E2=80=99s rebellion, swayed the authorities of New England in their t=
reatment of the conquered=20

Indians. By the end of the year the contest was over in the South, upward o=
f two thousand Indians=20

having been killed or taken. But some time elapsed before a=20
