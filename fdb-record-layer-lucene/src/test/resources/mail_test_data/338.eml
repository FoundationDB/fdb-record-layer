it up from all the natural kingdoms around, and is the intermediary between the kingdoms of Pranic 

and physical life.  Life cannot come immediately from the subjective to the objective, for Nature 

goes gradually through each sphere. Therefore the Linga Sharira is the intermediary between 

Prana and our physical body, and pumps in the life.  The spleen is consequently a very delicate 

organ, but the physical spleen is only a cover for the real spleen.  Now Life is in reality Divinity, 

Parabrahman. But in order to manifest on the Physical Plane it must be assimilated; and as the 

purely physical is too gross, it must have a medium, _viz._, the Astral. Astral matter is not 

homogeneous, and the Astral Light is nothing but the shadow of the real Divine Light; it is however 

not molecular.  Those (Kamarupic) entities which are below the Devachanic Plane are in Kama 

Loka and only possess intelligence like monkeys. There are no entities in the four lower kingdoms 

possessing intelligence which can communicate with men, but the Elementals have instincts like 

animals. It is, however, possible for the Sylphs (the Air Elementals, the wickedest things in the 

world) to communicate, but they require to be propitiated.  Spooks (Kamarupic entities) can only 

give the information they see immediately before them. They see things in the Aura of people, 

although the people may not be aware of them themselves.  Earth-bound spirits are Kamalokic 

entities that have been so materialistic that they cannot be dissolved for a long time. They have 

only a glimmering of consciousness and do not know why they are held, some sleep, some 

preserve a glimmering of consciousness and suffer torture.  In the case of people who have very 

little Devachan, the greater part of the consciousness remains in Kama Loka, and may last far 

beyond the normal period of one hundred and fifty years and remain over until the next 

reincarnation of the Spirit. This then becomes the Dweller on the Threshold and fights with the 

new Astral.  The acme of Kama is the sexual instinct, _e.g._, idiots have such desires and also 

food appetites, etc., and nothing else.  Devachan is a state on a plane of spiritual consciousness; 

Kama Loka is a place of physical consciousness. It is the shadow of the animal world and that of 

instinctual feelings. When the consciousness thinks of spiritual things, it is on a spiritual plane.  If 

one's thoughts are of nature, flowers, etc., then the consciousness is on the material plane.  But if 

thoughts are about eating, drinking, etc., and the passions, then the consciousness is in the 

Kamalokic plane, which is the plane of animal instincts pure and simple.      [Transcriber's Note: 

Obvious printer's errors have been corrected.]       FOOTNOTES       1 The majority of the Pandits 

know nothing of the Esoteric Philosophy       now, because they have lost the key to it; yet not one 

of these, if       honest, would deny that the _Upanishads_, and especially the       _Puranas_, are 

allegorical and symbolical; nor that there still       remain in India a few great scholars who could, if 

they would, give       them the key to such interpretations. Nor do they reject the actual 

existence of Mahatmas--initiated Yogis and Adepts--even in this age of       Kali Yuga.      2 This 

assertion is clearly corroborated by Plato himself, who writes:       "You say that in my former 

discourse I have not sufficiently       explained to you the nature of the First. I purposely spoke 

enigmatically, that in case the tablet should have happened with any       accident, either by sea or 

land, a person without some previous       knowledge of the subject might not be able to 

understand its       contents." (Plato, _Ep._, ii. 312; Cory, _Ancient Fragments_, p.       304.)      3 

_Isis Unveiled_, i. 287, 288.      4 _The Dialogues of Plato_, translated by B. Jowett, Regius 

Professor       of Greek at the University of Oxford, iii. 523.      5 _Op. cit._, p. 561.      6 _Op. cit._, 

p. 591.      7 This definition places (unwittingly, of course), the ancient       "physical philosopher" 



many cubits higher than his modern "physical"       _confrere_, since the _ultima thule_ of the latter 

is to lead       mankind to believe that neither universe nor man have any cause at       all--not an 

intelligent one at all events--and that they have sprung       into existence owing to blind chance 

and a senseless whirling of       atoms. Which of the two hypotheses is the more rational and 

logical       is left to the impartial reader to decide.      8 Italics are mine. Every tyro in Eastern 

Philosophy, every Kabalist,       will see the reason for such an association of persons with ideas, 

numbers, and geometrical figures. For number, says Philolaus, "is       the dominant and self-

produced bond of the eternal continuance of       things." Alone the modern Scholar remains blind 

to the grand truth.      9 Here again the ancient Philosopher seems to be ahead of the modern. 

For he only "confuses ... first and final causes" (which confusion       is denied by those who know 

the spirit of ancient scholarship),       whereas his modern successor is confessedly and absolutely 

ignorant       of both. Mr. Tyndall shows Science "powerless" to solve a single one       of the final 

problems of Nature and "disciplined [read, modern       materialistic], imagination retiring in 

bewilderment from the       contemplation of the problems" of the world of matter. He even 

doubts whether the men of present Science possess "the intellectual       elements which would 

enable them to grapple with the ultimate       structural energies of Nature." But for Plato and his 

disciples, the       lower types were but the concrete images of the higher abstract       ones; the 

immortal Soul has an arithmetical, as the body has a       geometrical, beginning. This beginning, 

as the reflection of the       great universal Archaeus (_Anima Mundi_), is self-moving, and from 

the centre diffuses itself over the whole body of the Macrocosm.     10 _Op. cit._, p. 523.     11 

Nowhere are the Neoplatonists guilty of such an absurdity. The       learned Professor of Greek 

must have been thinking of two spurious       works attributed by Eusebius and St. Jerome to 

Ammonius Saccas, who       wrote nothing; or must have confused the Neoplatonists with Philo 

Judaeus. But then Philo lived over 130 years before the birth of the       founder of Neoplatonism. 

He belonged to the School of Aristobulus       the Jew, who lived under Ptolemy Philometer (150 

years B.C.), and is       credited with having inaugurated the movement which tended to prove 

that Plato and even the Peripatetic Philosophy were derived from the       "revealed" Mosaic 

Books. Valckenaer tries to show that the author of       the _Commentaries on the Books of 

Moses_, was not Aristobulus, the       sycophant of Ptolemy. But whatever he was, he was not a 

Neoplatonist, but lived before, or during the days of Philo Judaeus,       since the latter seems to 

know his works and follow his methods.     12 Only Clemens Alexandrinus, a Christian 

Neoplatonist and a very       fantastic writer.     13 The labour of reconciling the different systems of 

religion.     14 _New Platonism and Alchemy_, by Alex. Wilder, M.D. pp. 7, 4.     15 It is well-known 

that, though born of Christian parents, Ammonius       had renounced the tenets of the Church--

Eusebius and Jerome       notwithstanding. Porphyry, the disciple of Plotinus, who had lived 

with Ammonius for eleven years together, and who had no interest for       stating an untruth, 

positively declares that he had renounced       Christianity entirely. On the other hand, we know 

that Ammonius       believed in the bright Gods, Protectors, and that the Neoplatonic 

Philosophy was as "pagan" as it was mystical. But Eusebius, the most       unscrupulous forger 

and falsifier of old texts, and St. Jerome, an       out-and-out fanatic, who had both an interest in 

denying the fact,       contradict Porphyry. We prefer to believe the latter, who has left       to 

posterity an unblemished name and a great reputation for honesty.     16 Two works are falsely 



attributed to Ammonius. One, now lost, called       _De Consensu Moysis et Jesu_, is mentioned 

by the same "trustworthy"       Eusebius, the Bishop of Caesaraea, and the friend of the Christian 

Emperor Constantine, who died, however, a heathen. All that is known       of this pseudo-work is 

that Jerome bestows great praise upon it       (_Vir. Illust._,  55; and Euseb., _H. E._, vi. 19). The 

other       spurious production is called the _Diatesseron_ (or the "Harmony of       the Gospels"). 

This is partially extant. But then, again, it exists       only in the Latin version of Victor, Bishop of 

Capua (sixth       century), who attributed it himself to Tatian, and as wrongly,       probably, as later 

scholars attributed the _Diatesseron_ to       Ammonius. Therefore no great reliance can be placed 

upon it, nor on       its "esoteric" interpretation of the Gospels. Is it this work, we       wonder, which 

led Prof. Jowett to regard the Neo-platonic       interpretations as "absurdities"?     17 _Op. cit._, p. 

7.     18 _Op. cit._, iii, 524.     19 "Imperfect knowledge" of what? That Plato was ignorant of many 

of       the modern "working hypotheses"--as ignorant as our immediate       posterity is sure to be 

of the said hypotheses when they in their       turn after exploding join the "great majority"--is 

perhaps a blessing       in disguise.     20 _Op. cit._, p. 524.     21 _Histoire Critique du 

Gnosticisme_, by M. J. Matter, Professor of       the Royal Academy of Strasburg, "It is in 

Pythagoras and Plato that       we find, in Greece, the first elements of [Oriental] Gnosticism," he 

says. (Vol. i, pp. 48 and 50.)     22 _Asiat. Trans._, i, 579.     23 _New Platonism and Alchemy_, p.

in number--lived in days       preceding the Vedic period. They are now known as Sages and held 

in       reverence like demigods. But they may now be shown as something more       than merely 

mortal Philosophers. There are other groups of ten,       twelve and even twenty-one in number. 

Haug shows that they occupy in       the Brahmanical religion a position answering to that of the 

twelve       sons of Jacob in the Jewish _Bible_. The Brahmans claim to descend       directly from 

the Rishis.     32 _Isis Unveiled_, i. 90.     33 See Muenter "On the most Ancient Religions of the

Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvi. 6.     35 "The date of the hundreds of pyramids in the Valley of the 

Nile is       impossible to fix by any of the rules of modern science; Herodotus       informs us that 

each successive king erected one to commemorate his       reign, and serve as his sepulchre. But, 

Herodotus did not tell all,       although he knew that the real purpose of the pyramid was very 

different from that which he assigns to it. Were it not for his       religious scruples, he might have 

added that, externally, it       symbolized the creative principle of Nature, and illustrated also 

the principles of geometry, mathematics, astrology and astronomy.       Internally, it was a majestic 

fane, in whose sombre recesses were       performed the Mysteries, and whose walls had often 

witnessed the       initiation scenes of members of the royal family. The porphyry       sarcophagus, 

which Professor Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal of       Scotland, degrades into a corn-bin, was 

the baptismal font, upon       emerging from which, the neophyte was 'born again,' and became an 



adept." (_Isis Unveiled_, i. 518, 519.)     36 Diog. Laert., in "Democrit. Vit."     37 _Satyric_, ix. 3.

what some of them are preparing to do, and many a       "mysterious page" in sacred and profane 

history are touched on in       these pages. Whether or not their explanations will be accepted--is 

another question.     42 _Ibid._     43 This is incorrectly expressed. The true Adept of the "Right 

Hand"       never punishes anyone, not even his bitterest and most dangerous       enemy; he 

simply leaves the latter to his put your pistols in your saddle-bags, take out the horses and lead 

them to the street below this, so that there will be nothing to do but mount them; all the rest is my 

business."  Porthos made no remark, but obeyed, with the sublime confidence he had in his friend. 

"I go," he said, "only, shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are?"  "No, it is not worth 

while."  "Well, do me the kindness to take my purse, which I left on the mantelpiece."  "All right." 

He then proceeded, with his usual calm gait, to the stable and went into the very midst of the 

soldiery, who, foreigner as he was, could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength 

of his great limbs.  At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him. 

D'Artagnan, meantime, went into the house, whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos 

went away.  "My dear Athos, I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced. I am sorry to 

have had anything to do with this matter. As you say, Mazarin is a knave. I have resolved to fly 

with you, not a word--be ready. Your swords are in the corner; do not forget them, they are in 

many circumstances very useful; there is Porthos's purse, too."  He put it into his pocket. The two 

friends were perfectly stupefied.  "Well, pray, is there anything to be so surprised at?" he said. "I 

was blind; Athos has made me see, that's all; come here."  The two friends went near him.  "Do 

you see that street? There are the horses. Go out by the door, turn to the right, jump into your 

saddles, all will be right; don't be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal. That will be the 

signal when I call out--Jesus Seigneur!"  "But give us your word that you will come too, 

D'Artagnan," said Athos.  "I swear I will, by Heaven."  "'Tis settled," said Aramis; "at the cry 'Jesus 

Seigneur' we go out, upset all that stands in our way, run to our horses, jump into our saddles, 

spur them; is that all?"  "Exactly."  "See, Aramis, as I have told you, D'Artagnan is first amongst us 

all," said Athos.  "Very true," replied the Gascon, "but I always run away from compliments. Don't 

forget the signal: 'Jesus Seigneur!'" and he went out as he came in, whistling the self-same air. 

The soldiers were playing or sleeping; two of them were singing in a corner, out of tune, the psalm: 

"On the rivers of Babylon."  D'Artagnan called the sergeant. "My dear friend, General Cromwell 

has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me. Guard the prisoners well, I beg of you."  The sergeant 

made a sign, as much as to say he did not understand French, and D'Artagnan tried to make him 

comprehend by signs and gestures. Then he went into the stable; he found the five horses 

saddled, his own amongst the rest.  "Each of you take a horse by the bridle," he said to Porthos 

and Mousqueton; "turn to the left, so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the window." 

"They are coming, then?" said Porthos.  "In a moment."  "You didn't forget my purse?"  "No; be 

easy."  "Good."  Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their 

post.  Then D'Artagnan, being alone, struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder, mounted his 

horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers. There, caressing as he pretended, the 

animal with his hand, he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear. It was necessary to be as good a 

horseman as he was to risk such a scheme, for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder 



than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad.  The soldiers, whom 

he was nearly trampling, ran away.  "Help! help!" cried D'Artagnan; "stop--my horse has the 

staggers."  In an instant the horse's eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam.  "Help!" 

cried D'Artagnan. "What! will you let me be killed? Jesus Seigneur!"  No sooner had he uttered this 

cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed out. The coast, owing to the Gascon's 

stratagem, was clear.  "The prisoners are escaping! the prisoners are escaping!" cried the 

sergeant.  "Stop! stop!" cried D'Artagnan, giving rein to his famous steed, who, darting forth, 

overturned several men.  "Stop! stop!" cried the soldiers, and ran for their arms.  But the prisoners 

were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate.  In the middle of the street 

they saw Grimaud and Blaisois, who were coming to find their masters. With one wave of his hand 

Athos made Grimaud, who followed the little troop, understand everything, and they passed on like 

a whirlwind, D'Artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice.  They passed through the 

gate like apparitions, without the guards thinking of detaining them, and reached the open country. 

All this time the soldiers were calling out, "Stop! stop!" and the sergeant, who began to see that he 

was the victim of an artifice, was almost in a frenzy of despair. Whilst all this was going on, a 

cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching. It was Mordaunt with the order in his hand.  "The 

prisoners!" he exclaimed, jumping off his horse.  The sergeant had not the courage to reply; he 

showed him the open door, the empty room. Mordaunt darted to the steps, understood all, uttered 

a cry, as if his very heart was pierced, and fell fainting on the stone steps.     59. Noble Natures 

never lose Courage, nor good Stomachs their Appetites.   The little troop, without looking behind 

them or exchanging a word, fled at a rapid gallop, fording a little stream, of which none of them 

knew the name, and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham. At last they 

came in sight of a small wood, and spurring their horses afresh, rode in its direction.  As soon as 

they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of 

any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together. The two grooms held the 

horses, that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled, and Grimaud was posted as 

sentinel.  "Come, first of all," said Athos to D'Artagnan, "my friend, that I may shake hands with 

you--you, our rescuer--you, the true hero of us all."  "Athos is right--you have my adoration," said 

Aramis, in his turn pressing his hand. "To what are you not equal, with your superior intelligence, 

infallible eye, your arm of iron and your enterprising mind!"  "Now," said the Gascon, "that is all 

well, I accept for Porthos and myself everything--thanks and compliments; we have plenty of time 

to spare."  The two friends, recalled by D'Artagnan to what was also due to Porthos, pressed his 

hand in their turn.  "And now," said Athos, "it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen, but 

we must map up our campaign. What shall we do?"  "What are we going to do, i'faith? It is not 

very difficult to say."  "Tell us, then, D'Artagnan."  "We are going to reach the nearest seaport, 

unite our little resources, hire a vessel and return to France. As for me I will give my last sou for it. 

Life is the greatest treasure, and speaking candidly, ours hangs by a thread."  "What do you say to 

this, Du Vallon?"  "I," said Porthos, "I am entirely of D'Artagnan's opinion; this is a 'beastly' country, 

this England."  "You are quite decided, then, to leave it?" asked Athos of D'Artagnan.  "Egad! I 

don't see what is to keep me here."  A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.  "Go, 

then, my friends," said the former, sighing.  "How, go then?" exclaimed D'Artagnan. "Let us go, 

you mean?"  "No, my friend," said Athos, "you must leave us."  "Leave you!" cried D'Artagnan, 



quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement.  "Bah!" said Porthos, "why separate, since we 

are all together?"  "Because you can and ought to return to France; your mission is accomplished, 

but ours is not."  "Your mission is not accomplished?" exclaimed D'Artagnan, looking in 

astonishment at Athos.  "No, my friend," replied Athos, in his gentle but decided voice, "we came 

here to defend King Charles; we have but ill defended him--it remains for us to save him!"  "To 

save the king?" said D'Artagnan, looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos.  Aramis contented 

himself by making a sign with his head.  D'Artagnan's countenance took an expression of the 

deepest compassion; he began to think he had to do with madmen.  "You cannot be speaking 

seriously, Athos!" said he; "the king is surrounded by an army, which is conducting him to London. 

This army is commanded by a butcher, or the son of a butcher--it matters little--Colonel Harrison. 

His majesty, I can assure you, will be tried on his arrival in London; I have heard enough from the 

lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to expect."  A second look was exchanged between Athos 

and Aramis.  "And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into 

execution," continued D'Artagnan.  "And to what penalty do you think the king will be 

condemned?" asked Athos.  "The penalty of death, I greatly fear; they have gone too far for him to 

pardon them, and there is nothing left to them but one thing, and that is to kill him. Have you never 

heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at 

Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned?"  "What did he say?" asked Porthos. 

"'Princes must be knocked on the head.'"  "I remember it," said Athos.  "And you fancy he will not 

put his maxim into execution, now that he has got hold of the king?"  "On the contrary, I am certain 

he will do so. But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so 

threatened."  "Athos, you are becoming mad."  "No, my friend," Athos gently replied, "but De 

Winter sought us out in France and introduced us, Monsieur d'Herblay and myself, to Madame 

Henrietta. Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband. We engaged our word; our 

word included everything. It was our strength, our intelligence, our life, in short, that we promised. 

It remains now for us to keep our word. Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?"  "Yes," said Aramis, "we 

have promised."  "Then," continued Athos, "we have another reason; it is this--listen: In France at 

this moment everything is poor and paltry. We have a king ten years old, who doesn't yet know 

what he wants; we have a queen blinded by a belated passion; we have a minister who governs 

France as he would govern a great farm--that is to say, intent only on turning out all the gold he 

can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention; we have princes who set up a personal and 

egotistic opposition, who will draw from Mazarin's hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds 

of power granted as bribes. I have served them without enthusiasm--God knows that I estimated 

them at their real value, and that they are not high in my esteem--but on principle. To-day I am 

engaged in a different affair. I have encountered misfortune in a high place, a royal misfortune, a 

European misfortune; I attach myself to it. If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good; if 

we die for him it will be grand."  "So you know beforehand you must perish!" said D'Artagnan.  "We 

fear so, and our only regret is to die so far from both of you."  "What will you do in a foreign land, 

an enemy's country?"  "I traveled in England when I was young, I speak English like an 

Englishman, and Aramis, too, knows something of the language. Ah! if we had you, my friends! 

With you, D'Artagnan, with you, Porthos--all four reunited for the first time for twenty years--we 

would dare not only England, but the three kingdoms put together!"  "And did you promise the 



queen," resumed D'Artagnan, petulantly, "to storm the Tower of London, to kill a hundred 

thousand soldiers, to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man, 

and when that man is Cromwell? Do not exaggerate your duty. In Heaven's name, my dear Athos, 

do not make a useless sacrifice. When I see you merely, you look like a reasonable being; when 

you speak, I seem to have to do with a madman. Come, Porthos, join me; say frankly, what do you 

think of this business?"  "Nothing good," replied Porthos.  "Come," continued D'Artagnan, who, 

irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts, "you 

have never found yourself the worse for my advice. Well, then, believe me, Athos, your mission is 

ended, and ended nobly; return to France with us."  "Friend," said Athos, "our resolution is 

irrevocable."  "Then you have some other motive unknown to us?"  Athos smiled and D'Artagnan 

struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could 

discover; but to all these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm, sweet smile 

and Aramis by nodding his head.  "Very well," cried D'Artagnan, at last, furious, "very well, since 

you wish it, let us leave our bones in this beggarly land, where it is always cold, where fine 

weather is a fog, fog is rain, and rain a deluge; where the sun represents the moon and the moon 

a cream cheese; in truth, whether we die here or elsewhere matters

fails to do so, sooner or later.     44 _Op. cit._, ii. 239, 241, 240.     45 See, in this connection, 

_Pneumatologie des Esprits_, by the Marquis       de Mirville, who devotes six enormous volumes 

to show the absurdity       of those who deny the reality of Satan and Magic, or the Occult 

Sciences--the two being with him synonymous.     46 We think we see the sidereal phantom of the 

old Philosopher and       Mystic--once of Cambridge University--Henry More, moving about in the 

astral mist over the old moss-covered roofs of the ancient town in       which he wrote his famous 

letter to Glanvil about "witches." The       "soul" seems restless and indignant, as on that day of 

May, 1678,       when the doctor complained so bitterly to the author of _Sadducismus 

Triumphatus_ of Scot, Adie and Webster. "Our new inspired saints,"       the soul is heard to 

mutter, "sworn advocates of the witches ... who       against all sense and reason ... will have no 

Samuel but a       confederate knave ... these in-blown buffoons, puffed up with ...       ignorance, 

vanity and stupid infidelity!" (See "Letter to Glanvil,"       and _Isis Unveiled_, i. 205, 206.)     47 

_Etudes Religieuses._     48 _Etudes Historiques._     49 _Memoire_ read at the Academie des 

Inscriptions des Belles Lettres,       in 1859.     50 See Alfred Maury's _Histoire des Religions de la 

Grece_, i. 248; and       the speculations of Holzmann in _Zeitschrift fuer Vergleichende       Sprach 

forschung_, ann. die."  "Only reflect, my good fellow," said Athos, "it is but dying rather sooner." 

"Pooh! a little sooner or a little later, it isn't worth quarreling over."  "If I am astonished at anything," 

remarked Porthos, sententiously, "it is that it has not already happened."  "Oh, it will happen, you 

may be sure," said D'Artagnan. "So it is agreed, and if Porthos makes no objection----"  "I," said 

Porthos, "I will do whatever you please; and besides, I think what the Comte de la Fere said just 

now is very good."  "But your future career, D'Artagnan--your ambition, Porthos?"  "Our future, our 

ambition!" replied D'Artagnan, with feverish volubility. "Need we think of that since we are to save 

the king? The king saved--we shall assemble our friends together--we will head the Puritans--

reconquer England; we shall re-enter London--place him securely on his throne----"  "And he will 

make us dukes and peers," said Porthos, whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect. 

"Or he will forget us," added D'Artagnan.  "Oh!" said Porthos.  "Well, that has happened, friend 

Porthos. It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that 

which to-day we are trying to perform for Charles I.; but, none the less, Anne of Austria has 

forgotten us for twenty years."  "Well, in spite of that, D'Artagnan," said Athos, "you are not sorry 

that you were useful to her?"  "No, indeed," said D'Artagnan; "I admit even that in my darkest 

moments I find consolation in that

same belief as the Nazarenes and       the Sabaeans, honoured John the Baptist, and used 

Baptism. (See _Isis       Unveiled_, ii. 127; Munck, _Palestine_, p. 525; Dunlap, _Sod, the       Son 

of Man_, etc.)     53 i. 535.     54 By Hargrave Jennings.     55 See De Mirville's _Pneumatologie_,

535, 536.     58 The forty-two Sacred Books of the Egyptians, mentioned by Clement of 

Alexandria as having existed in his time, were but a portion of the       Books of Hermes. 

Iamblichus, on the authority of the Egyptian priest       Abammon, attributes 1,200 of such books to 

Hermes, and Manetho       36,000. But the testimony of Iamblichus as a Neoplatonist and 

Theurgist is of course rejected by modern critics. Manetho, who is       held by Bunsen in the 

highest consideration as a "purely historical       personage," with whom "none of the later native 

historians can be       compared" (see _Egypte_, i. 97), suddenly becomes a Pseudo-Manetho, 

as soon as the ideas propounded by him clash with the scientific       prejudices against Magic and 

the Occult knowledge claimed by the       ancient priests. However, none of the Archaeologists 

doubt  "You see, then, D'Artagnan, though princes often are ungrateful, God never is."  "Athos," 

said D'Artagnan, "I believe that were you to fall in with the devil, you would conduct yourself so 

well that you would take him with you to Heaven."  "So, then?" said Athos, offering his hand to 

D'Artagnan.  "'Tis settled," replied D'Artagnan. "I find England a charming country, and I stay--but 

on one condition only."  "What is it?"  "That I am not forced to learn English."  "Well, now," said 

Athos, triumphantly, "I swear to you, my friend, by the God who hears us--I believe that there is a 

power watching over us, and that we shall all four see France again."  "So be it!" said D'Artagnan, 

"but I--I confess I have a contrary conviction."  "Our good D'Artagnan," said Aramis, "represents 

among us the opposition in parliament, which always says no, and always does aye."  "But in the 

meantime saves the country," added Athos.  "Well, now that everything is decided," cried Porthos, 

rubbing his hands, "suppose we think of dinner! It seems to me that in the most critical positions of 

our lives we have always dined."  "Oh! yes, speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat 

boiled mutton, and as a treat drink beer. What the devil did you come to such a country for, Athos? 

But I forgot," added the Gascon, smiling, "pardon, I forgot you are no longer Athos;

moment the almost incredible antiquity of the Hermetic books.       Champollion shows the greatest 

regard for their authenticity and       truthfulness, corroborated as it is by many of the oldest 

monuments.       And Bunsen brings irrefutable for dinner, Porthos."  "My plan!"  "Yes, have you a 

plan?"  "No! I am hungry, that is all."  "Pardieu, if that is all, I am hungry, too; but it is not 

everything to be hungry, one must find something to eat, unless we browse on the grass, like our

researches, for instance, we learn that there was a line of sixty-       one kings before the days of 

Moses, who preceded the Mosaic period       by a clearly-traceable civilization of several thousand 

years. Thus       we are warranted in believing that the works of Hermes Trismegistus       were 

extant many ages before the birth of the Jewish law-giver.       "Styli and inkstands were found on 

monuments of the  "Ah!" exclaimed Aramis, who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of 

the earth as Athos, "do you remember, when we were at Parpaillot, the beautiful oysters that we 

ate?"  "And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes," said Porthos, smacking his lips.  "But," 

suggested D'Artagnan, "have we not our friend Mousqueton, who managed for us so well at 

Chantilly, Porthos?"  "Yes," said Porthos, "we have Mousqueton,
