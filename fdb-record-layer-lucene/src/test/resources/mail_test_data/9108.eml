philodendron monstera onions came up all right and made a good crop.  As so=
on as the shoots make their appearance above the ground a good raking with =
a fine steel rake can be given. This will give them a good start and destro=
y the young weeds that will begin to make their appearance at the same time=
. After the onions start to grow, cultivation is the making of the crop, an=
d the cleaner they are kept and of the planter. Generally, within one mile =
from the river, there is an impenetrable morass. The country has every wher=
e the appearance of an origin comparatively recent. Not a rock on which you=
 can stand, and no mountain to gladden the eye; you seem to have left the o=
lder parts of creation to witness the encroachments which the earth is cont=
inually making upon the empire of the sea; philodendron monstera onions cam=

arance above the ground a good raking with a fine steel rake can be given. =
This will give them a good start and destroy the young weeds that will begi=
n to make their appearance at the same time. After the onions start to grow=
, cultivation is the making of the crop, and the cleaner they are kept and =
of the planter. Generally, within one mile from the river, there is an impe=
netrable morass. The country has every where the appearance of an origin co=
mparatively recent. Not a rock on which you can stand, and no mountain to g=
ladden the eye; you seem to have left the older parts of creation to witnes=
s the encroachments which the earth is continually making upon the empire o=
f the sea; _
Stiff, clayey, or hard, poor land can be made a great deal better for the o=
nion crop by a heavy=20

application of ashes or well rotted bagasse. I prefer to apply ashes as a t=
op dressing in the spring,=20

working it in the surface, as I find by experience that they are not only v=
aluable as a fertilizer when=20

used in this way, but are also of great benefit in keeping down the weeds. =
 A plot of ground that is=20

seeded with crab-grass should not be selected, as the pulling up of the gra=
ss injures the growth of=20

the onions. Onions feed near the surface; in fact, the larger portion of th=
e bulb grows on top of the=20

soil, and as a natural consequence the plant food should be well worked in =
the surface. Of course=20

it is too late now to talk about fall preparation. If we want a crop of oni=
ons from seed this spring,=20

whatever preparation there is must be done between now and seeding. I shoul=
d plow or spade up=20

the soil as soon as possible, if there is a thaw out either the last of thi=
s or any part of next month.=20

If you can save up and rot a supply of poultry manure and leaves, you can h=
ave the very best=20

manure for a good onion crop.  Another important point in raising a good cr=
op of onions is to have=20

good seed and sow it early. The first favorable time in the spring must be =
taken advantage of, if=20

you would have the best success with your crop. As good seed is necessary i=
n any crop, so it is=20

with onions. Test your seed before risking your entire crop, as by the time=
 you plant once and fail,=20

and procure seed and plant again, it will be too late to make a good crop. =
I always take advantage=20

of the first chance in March to sow my onion seed. We usually have a few wa=
rm days sometime=20

about country. But I have two facts, of a geological kind, to mention, both=
 of which go to confirm=20

the opinion.  1. A well was dug in the Choctaw nation, at the agency of the=
 United States, in the=20

year 1812 or 1813, under the direction of Silas Dinsmore, Esq. the agent. T=
he excavation was=20

continued to the depth of one hundred and seventy-two feet. No water was fo=
und. At no great=20

distance from the surface, marine exuvi=C3=A6 were found in abundance. The =
shells were small, and=20

imbedded in a soft clay, similar to marine earth. This formation continued =
till the excavation=20

ceased. Dispersed through it, were found lumps of selenite, or foliated gyp=
sum, some of which=20

were half as large as a man's fist. Specimens of the earth, the exuvi=C3=A6=
, and the selenite, have=20

been transmitted for your examination. This excavation was made one hundred=
 and twenty miles=20

north northeast of Natchez. The Pearl River is four miles to the east of th=
e place, and is the only=20

considerable stream in this part of the country.  2. In the Chickasaw natio=
n, one hundred and=20

seventy miles north of the Choctaw agency, commence beds of oyster-shells, =
which continue to=20

be seen at intervals for twelve miles. Four miles from the first bed, you c=
ome to what is called=20

"Chickasaw Old Town," where they are observed in great abundance. They are =
imbedded in low=20

ridges of a white marl. They appear to be of two kinds. Specimens of each, =
and also of the marl,=20

you have received. "Chickasaw Old Town," is a name now appropriated to a pr=
airie, on a part of=20

which there formerly stood a small village of Chickasaws. The prairie is tw=
enty miles long, and four=20

wide. The shells occur in three places as you cross it, and again, on two=
=20


_
of the month when this work can be done. Of course I do not say that this i=
s the case every year.=20

The first favorable opportunity should be taken advantage of, is what I wan=
t to impress upon those=20

who expect to make a crop; let this time come when it will, any time early =
in the spring. If the=20

ground has been plowed or spaded well during the winter, a good harrowing o=
r raking should be=20

given. If you have the poultry manure, now is the best time to apply it, wo=
rking it on top of the soil=20

with a rake. If you have not the poultry manure and have ashes, give a good=
 strong dressing of=20

ashes, raking it, at the distance of four miles. They do not cover the surf=
ace merely. They form a=20

constituent part of the hills or plains in which they are found. Wherever t=
he earth has been washed=20

so as to produce deep gutters, they are seen in greatest abundance. Nor are=
 they petrifactions,=20

such as are found in rocks. They have the same appearance as common oyster-=
shells, they lie=20

loose in the earth, and thus indicate a comparatively recent origin. They o=
ccur _three hundred=20

miles_ northeast of Natchez, and but _sixty_ miles south of the Dividing Ri=
dge.  If the country=20

north of Natchez is alluvial, no=20


_
in drills twelve inches apart, and not more than one inch deep; lay off the=
 drills as narrow and as=20

straight as possible, and then drill the seed evenly. Try to keep them in a=
 straight row, as it will aid=20

much in the cultivation. Cover lightly, but press the soil firmly upon the =
seed. They will withstand=20

considerable cold, damp weather before rotting.  Last year I sowed my onion=
 seed on the 23d of=20

March; the next ten days were cold, rainy, dark, dismal days, with two or t=
hree it is so from this=20

place to the Gulf of Mexico. At Baton Rouge, one hundred and forty miles no=
rth of New Orleans,=20

you meet the first elevated land in ascending from the gulf. The banks of t=
he Mississippi are higher=20

than the interior, and would be annually overflowed by the river, but for a=
 narrow embankment of=20

earth about six feet high, called the Levee. By means of this, a narrow str=
ip of land, from half a=20

mile to a mile in width, is redeemed, and cultivated with cotton and the=20
