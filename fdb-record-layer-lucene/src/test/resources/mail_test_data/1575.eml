 "Who says so?" demanded the adventurer, boldly. "It is true I brought one =
here to sell, but it has belonged to me for years."  "You are mistaken, Mr.=
 Montgomery," said Paul, who had come up unperceived. "You stole that ring =
from me (Belad-el-Jerid), the refuge of the true Ishmaelite; for in the des=
ert, learning, good faith, and hospitality can still be found=E2=80=94at le=
ast, so Arabs say.  Orange and azofaifa trees, with almonds, sweet limes an=
d walnuts, stood up against the waning light, outlined in the clear atmosph=
ere almost so sharply as to wound the eye.  Around the well goats and sheep=
 lay, whilst a girl led a camel round the Noria track; women sat here and t=
here and gossiped, with their tall earthenware jars _
any too soon. My money is pretty low."  He walked across the City Hall Park=
, and at Barclay street=20

entered a University place car.  "Evenin' paper, mister?" said a ragged new=
sboy, whose garments=20

were constructed on the most approved system of ventilation.  "What have yo=
u got?"  "Evenin'=20

Post, Mail, Express!"  "Give me an Express. Here's ten cents."  "I haven't =
got but three cents=20

change, mister."  "Never mind the change," said Mr. Montgomery, in a fit of=
 temporary generosity,=20

occasioned by his good luck.  "Thank you, sir," said the newsboy, regarding=
 Mr. Montgomery as a=20

philanthropist worthy of his veneration.  Felix Montgomery leaned back in h=
is seat, and, with a=20

benevolent smile, ran his eyes over the columns of the Express. Among the p=
aragraphs which=20

attracted his attention was one relating to a comrade, of similar professio=
n, who had just been=20

arrested in Albany while in the act of relieving a gentleman of his pocketb=
ook.  "Jerry always was a=20

bungler," said Mr. Montgomery, complacently, to himself. "He can't hold a c=
andle to me. I flatter=20

myself that I know how to manage a little affair, like this, for instance, =
as well as the next man. It'll=20

take a sharp detective to lay hold of me."  It might have been thought that=
 the manner in which he=20

had gained possession of the ring would have troubled Mr. Montgomery, but i=
t was many years=20

since he had led an honest life. He had made a living by overreaching other=
s, and his conscience=20

had become so blunted as to occasion him little trouble. He appeared to thi=
nk that the world owed=20

him a living, and that he was quite justified in collecting the debt in any=
 way he could.  About=20

twenty minutes brought the car to Amity street and Mr. Montgomery signaled =
the conductor, and,=20

the car being stopped, he got out.  He walked a few rods in a westerly dire=
ction, and paused=20

before a three-story brick house, which appeared to have seen better days. =
 It was now used as a=20

boarding, or rather lodging-house. The guests were not of a very high chara=
cter, the landlady not=20

being particular as long as her rent was paid regularly. Mr. Montgomery asc=
ended the steps in a=20

jaunty way, and, opening the door with a passkey, ascended the front stairc=
ase. He paused before=20

a room on the third floor, and knocked in a peculiar manner.  The door was =
opened by a tall=20

woman, in rather neglected attire.  "So you're back," she said.  "Yes, my d=
ear, home again. As the=20

poet says, 'There is no place like home.'"  "I should hope there wasn't," s=
aid Mrs. Montgomery,=20

looking about her disdainfully. "A very delightful home it makes with such =
a charming prospect of=20

the back yard. I've been moping here all day."  "You've found something to =
console you, I see,"=20

said her husband, glancing at the table, on which might be seen a bottle of=
 brandy, half-emptied,=20

and a glass.  "Yes," said Mrs. Montgomery; "I felt so bad I had to send out=
 for something. It took=20

every cent I had. And, by the way, Mrs. Flagg sent in her bill, this mornin=
g, for the last two weeks'=20

board; she said she must have it."  "My dear," said Mr. Montgomery, "she sh=
all have it."  "You=20

don't mean to say you've got the money, Tony!" exclaimed his wife, in surpr=
ise.  "No, I haven't got=20

the money; but I've got what's just as good."  "What have you got?"  "What =
do you say to this?"=20

and Mr. Montgomery drew from his pocket the diamond ring, whose loss was so=
 deeply felt by our=20

hero.  "Is that genuine?" asked the lady.  "It's the real thing."  "What a =
beauty! Where did you get=20

it?"  "It was kindly presented me by a young man of the tender age of fifte=
en or thereabouts, who=20

had no further use for it."  "You did him out of it, that is. Tell me how y=
ou did it."  Mr. Montgomery=20

told the story. His wife listened with interest and appreciation.  "That wa=
s a smart operation, Tony,"=20

she said.  "I should say it was, Maria."  "How much is the ring worth?"  "T=
wo hundred and fifty=20

dollars."  "Can you get that for it?"  "I can get that for it."  "Tony, you=
 are a treasure."  "Have you=20

just found that out, my dear?"    CHAPTER XX  THE THIEF IN DISGUISE  It wil=
l be inferred, from=20



the preceding conversation, that Mrs. Montgomery was not likely to be shock=
ed by the lack of=20

honesty in her husband. Her conscience was as elastic as his; and she was p=
erfectly willing to=20

help him spend his unlawful gains.  "How soon are you going to sell the rin=
g?" she asked.  "I=20

should like to dispose of it at once, Maria."  "You will need to. Mrs. Flag=
g wants her bill paid at=20

once."  "I quite understand the necessity of promptness, my dear. Only, you=
 know, one has to be=20

cautious about disposing of articles obtained in this way."  "You say you l=
eft the boy locked up. It=20

seems to me, you'd better sell the ring before he has a chance to get out a=
nd interfere."  "I don't=20

know but you're right, my dear. Well, we'll get ready."  "Do you want me to=
 go with you?"  "Yes; it=20

will disarm suspicion if you are with me. I think I'll go as a country pars=
on."  "Country parsons are=20

not apt to have diamond rings to dispose of."  "Very true, my dear. The rem=
ark does credit to your=20

good judgment and penetration. But I know how to get over that."  "As how?"=
  "Be a little more=20

particular about your speech, my dear. Remember, you are a minister's wife,=
 and must use refined=20

expressions. What is easier than to say that the ring was given me by a ben=
evolent lady of my=20

congregation, to dispose of for the benefit of the poor?"  "Well thought of=
, Tony. You've got a good=20

head-piece."  "You're right, my dear. I don't like to indulge in self-prais=
e, but I believe I know a=20

thing or two. And now for the masquerade. Where are the duds?"  "In the bla=
ck trunk."  "Then we'd=20

better lose no time in putting them on."  Without describing the process of=
 transformation in detail,=20

it will be sufficient to say that the next twenty minutes wrought a decided=
 change in the=20

appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Felix Montgomery. The former was arrayed in a su=
it of canonical=20

black, not of the latest cut. A white neckcloth was substituted for the mor=
e gaudy article worn by=20

the jeweler from Syracuse, and a pair of silver-bowed spectacles, composed =
of plain glass, lent a=20

scholarly air to his face. His hair was combed behind his ears, and, so far=
 as appearance went, he=20

quite looked the character of a clergyman from the rural districts.  "How w=
ill I do, my dear?" he=20

asked, complacently.  "Tiptop," answered the lady. "How do I look?"  Mrs. M=
ontgomery had put on=20

a dress of sober tint, and scant circumference, contrasting in a marked man=
ner with the mode then=20

prevailing. A very plain collar encircled her neck. Her hands were incased =
in brown silk gloves,=20

while her husband wore black kids. Her bonnet was exceedingly plain, and he=
r whole costume=20

was almost Quaker-like in its simplicity.  Her husband surveyed her with sa=
tisfaction.  "My dear,"=20

he said, "you are a fitting helpmeet for the Rev. Mr. Barnes, of Hayfield C=
entre. By Jove, you do=20

me credit!"  "'By Jove' is not a proper expression for a man of your profes=
sion, Mr. Barnes," said=20

the new minister's wife, with a smile.  "You are right, my dear. I must esc=
hew profanity, and=20

cultivate a decorous style of speech. Well, are we ready?"  "I am."  "Then =
let us set forth on our=20

pilgrimage. We will imagine, Mrs. Barnes, that we are about to make some pa=
storal calls."  They=20

emerged into the street. On the way downstairs they met Mrs. Flagg, the lan=
dlady, who bowed=20

respectfully. She was somewhat puzzled, however, not knowing when they were=
 let in.  "Good-

morning, madam," said Mr. Barnes. "Are you the landlady of this establishme=
nt?"  "Yes, sir."  "I=20

have been calling on one of your lodgers--Mr. Anthony Blodgett (this was th=
e name by which Mr.=20

Felix Montgomery was known in the house). He is a very worthy man."  Now, t=
o tell the truth, Mrs.=20

Flagg had not been particularly struck by the moral worth of her lodger, an=
d this testimony led her=20

to entertain doubts as to the discernment of her clerical visitor.  "You kn=
ow him, then?"  "I know=20

him as myself, madam. Have you never heard him mention the name of Rev. Mr.=
 Barnes, of=20

Hayfield Centre, Connecticut?"  "I can't say I have," answered the landlady=
.  "That is singular. We=20



were always very intimate. We attended the same school as boys, and, in fac=
t, were like Damon=20

and Pythias."  Mrs. Flagg had never heard of Damon and Pythias, still she u=
nderstood the=20

comparison.  "You're in rather a different line now," she remarked, dryly. =
 "Yes, our positions are=20

different. My friend dwells in the busy metropolis, while I pass a quiet, p=
eaceful existence in a=20

secluded country village, doing what good I can. But, my dear, we are perha=
ps detaining this=20

worthy lady from her domestic avocations. I think we must be going."  "Very=
 well, I am ready."  The=20

first sound of her voice drew the attention of the landlady. Mrs. Felix Mon=
tgomery possessed a thin=20

somewhat shrill, voice, which she was unable to conceal, and, looking atten=
tively at her, Mrs.=20

Flagg penetrated her disguise. Then, turning quickly to the gentleman, aide=
d by her new=20

discovery, she also recognized him.  "Well, I declare," said she, "if you d=
idn't take me in=20

beautifully."  Mr. Montgomery laughed heartily.  "You wouldn't know me, the=
n?" he said.  "You're=20

got up excellent," said Mrs. Flagg, with a slight disregard for grammar. "I=
s it a joke?"  "Yes, a little=20

practical joke. We're going to call on some friends and see if they know us=
."  "You'd do for the=20

theatre," said the landlady, admiringly.  "I flatter myself I might have do=
ne something on the stage,=20

if my attention had been turned that way. But, my dear, we must be moving, =
or we shan't get=20

through our calls."  "I wonder what mischief they are up to now," thought M=
rs. Flagg, as she=20

followed them to the door. "I know better than to think they'd take the tro=
uble to dress up that way=20

just to take in their friends. No, they're up to some game. Not that I care=
, as long as they get=20

money enough to pay my bill."  So the worldly-wise landlady dismissed them =
from her thoughts,=20

and went about her work.  Mr. Barnes and his wife walked up toward Broadway=
 at a slow,=20

decorous pace, suited to the character they had assumed. More than one who =
met them turned=20

back to look at what they considered a perfect type of the country minister=
 and his wife. They=20

would have been not a little surprised to learn that under this quiet garb =
walked two of the most=20

accomplished swindlers in a city abounding in adventurers of all kinds.  Mr=
. Barnes paused a=20

moment to reprove a couple of urchins who were pitching pennies on the side=
walk.  "Don't you=20

know that it's wrong to pitch pennies?" he said gravely.  "None of your ver=
y kindliness which those=20

living in what appear more favourable surroundings so often lack.  Born som=
ewhere in the=20

Yorkshire Dales (these he remembered well), and as he thought =E2=80=9Cback=
 somewhere in the=20

twenties,=E2=80=9D he had suffered all his life from the strange fever whic=
h impels some men to search for=20

gold.  Not on the Stock Exchange, or any of those places where it might rea=
sonably be expected=20

to be found, but in Australia, California, Mexico, in short wherever life w=
as hard, death easy, and=20

experience to be gathered, he sought with pick and shovel, rocker and pan a=
nd cradle, the =E2=80=9Cyellow=20

iron,=E2=80=9D as the Apaches used to call it, which sought and found after=
 the fashion of his kind, enriches=20

some one else. From California he had drifted to Peru, from thence to Chile=
, but finding silver-

mining too laborious or too lucrative for his conversing, and hearing of a =
fertile diggings opened in=20

the Republic of Uruguay, had migrated there, and arrived somehow in Paragua=
y to find that the=20

enchantment of his life was done, and settled down to live.  Tall, and with=
 long grey hair hanging in=20

Western fashion down his back, a careful horseman after the style of the tr=
appers of the West, his=20

pale blue eyes looked out upon the world as with an air of doubt; yet he ha=
d served in San=20

Francisco as a =E2=80=9Cvigilante,=E2=80=9D sojourned with Brigham Young in=
 Salt Lake City, leaving as he=20

confessed two or three wives among the saints, sat in Judge Lynch=E2=80=99s=
 court a dozen times, most=20

probably had killed a man or two; still, to my fancy, if the meek are to in=
herit any portion of the=20



earth, his share should not be small.  He made us welcome, and his wife wai=
ted upon us, never=20

presuming to sit down and eat, but standing ready with a napkin fringed wit=
h lace, to wipe our=20

hands, pressing the food upon us, and behaving generally as if she found he=
rself in the presence=20

of some strange beings of an unfamiliar race.  He said he had no children a=
nd was glad of it, for=20

he explained that =E2=80=9CJuaneeter was a good woman, but =E2=80=98uneddic=
ated,=E2=80=99 and he had never taken=20

thoroughly to half-caste pups, though he remembered some born of a Pi-Ute w=
oman, way back=20

somewhere about the fifties, who he supposed by now were warriors, and had =
taken many=20

scalps.=E2=80=9D  His wife stood by, not understanding any English and but =
little Spanish, which he himself=20

spoke badly, and their talk was held in a strange jargon mixed with Guarani=
, without a verb,=20

without a particle, and yet sufficient for the two simple creatures whom a =
strange fate, or a=20

discerning, ever-watchful Providence, had thus ordained to meet.  No books =
were in the place,=20

except a Bible, which he read little of late years, partly from failing sig=
ht, and partly, as he said,=20

because he had detected what seemed to him =E2=80=9Cexaggerations,=E2=80=9D=
 chiefly in figures and as to the=20

number of the unbelievers whom the Chosen People slew.  Two days or more, f=
or time was taken=20

no account of in his house, we waited with him, talking late every night of=
 Salt Lake, Brigham=20

Young, the Mountain-meadows Massacre, Kit Carson, Cochise and Mangas Colora=
das, and=20

matters of that kind which interested him, and which, when all is said, are=
 just as interesting to=20

those attuned to them, as is polemical theology, theories of art, systems o=
f jurisprudence, the=20

origin of the Atoll Islands, or any of the wise futilities with which men s=
tock their minds.  We parted=20

on the third or fourth, or perhaps the fifth or sixth day, knowing that we =
should never meet again,=20

and taking off my silver spurs I gave them to him, and he presented me with=
 a light summer=20

poncho woven by his wife.  Much did he thank me for my visit, and made me s=
wear never to pass=20

the district without stopping at his house.  This I agreed to do, and if I =
pass again either by=20

Caballero Punta or by Caapuc=C3=BA, I will keep faith; but he, I fear, will=
 have deceived me, and in the=20

churchyard of the =E2=80=9Ccapilla,=E2=80=9D under a palm-tree, with a roug=
h cross above him, I shall find my simple=20

friend.  Three or four days of jogging steadily, passing by Quindy, and thr=
ough the short =E2=80=9Cestero=E2=80=9D of=20

Acaai, which we passed splashing for several hours up to the girths, brough=
t us to Paraguari,=20

which, with its saddle-shaped mountain overhanging it, stood out a mark for=
 leagues upon the=20

level plain.  Seldom in any country have I seen a railway so fall into the =
landscape as did the line=20

at the little terminus of this the only railway in all Paraguay.  The war h=
ad left the country almost in=20

ruins, business was at a standstill, food was scarce, and but for a bale or=
 two of tobacco, and a=20

hide-sack or two of yerba, the train went empty to and fro.  But as the peo=
ple always wanted to go=20

to the capital in search of work, six or eight empty trucks were always sen=
t with every train.  On=20

them the people (mostly women) swarmed, seated like flies, upon the top and=
 sides, dangling their=20

legs outside like people sitting on a wharf, talking incessantly, all dress=
ed in white, and every one,=20

down to the smallest children, smoking large cigars.  Six hours the passage=
 took, if all went well,=20

the distance being under fifty miles.  If aught went wrong, it took a day o=
r more, and at the bridges=20

the trucks were all unhooked and taken over separately, so rotten was the s=
tate of the whole line,=20

and in addition every here and there bridges had been blown away during the=
 war, and roughly=20

rendered serviceable by shoring up with wood. To meet a train labouring and=
 puffing through the=20

woods, the people clustering like bees upon the trucks, the engineer seated=
 in shirt-sleeves, whilst=20

some women stoked the fire, was much the same as it is to meet a caravan me=
andering across=20



the sands.  If you desired to talk with any one the train incontinently sto=
pped, the passengers got=20

out, relit their cigarettes, the women begged, the time of day was passed, =
and curiosity thus=20

satisfied you passed on upon the road, and the =E2=80=9CMaquina-guazu,=E2=
=80=9D {78} as it was called, pursued=20

contentedly the jolting and uneven tenor of its way.  We naturally despised=
 it, though the=20

conductor, scenting business, offered to take us and our horses at almost a=
ny price we chose.  By=20

the Laguna Ypocarai we took our way; skirting along its eastern shores, the=
n desolate, and the=20

whole district almost depopulated, we passed by palm-groves and deserted ma=
ndioca patches,=20

reed cottages in ruins, watched the flamingoes fishing in the lake, the all=
igators lying motionless,=20

and saw an Indian all alone in a dug-out canoe, casting his line as placidl=
y as he had lived before=20

the coming of the Spaniards to the land.  A red-blue haze hung on the water=
s of the lake, reflected=20

from the bright red earth, peeping between the trees, and on the islands dr=
ifts of mist gave an=20

effect as if the palms were parachutes dropped from balloons, or perhaps de=
spatched from earth=20

to find out whether in the skies there could be anything more lovely than t=
his quiet inland sea.=20

Close to the top end of the lake stands Aregua, once under the Mercenary fr=
iars of Asuncion, who,=20

as Azara says, having made the people of the place work for them for near t=
wo hundred years,=20

began to think they were indeed their slaves, till an official sent from Sp=
ain in 1783 gave them their=20

liberty, and the Mercenaries (as he says) at once retreated in disgust.  He=
re we fell in with a=20

compatriot, who at our time of meeting him was drunk.  He told us that he p=
assed his time after the=20

fashion of the patriarchs in the Old Testament, and on arriving at his hous=
e it seemed he was=20

provided with several wives, but of the flocks and herds, and other trade-m=
arks of his supposed=20

estate, we saw no trace.  Still he was hospitable, setting the women to cut=
 down pindo for the=20

horses, take them to water, bathe them, and finally to cook some dinner for=
 ourselves. His chief=20

complaint was that his wives were Catholics, and now and then trudged off t=
o mass, and left him=20

without any one to cook his food.  I doubted personally if a change of cree=
d would better things,=20

but held my peace, seeing the man set store by the faith which he had learn=
t in youth and still said=20

he practised, but, as far as I could see, only by cursing the religion of t=
he people of the place.  We=20

left his house without regret, though he was hospitable and half drunk for =
nearly all the time that=20

we were there, and started on our last day=E2=80=99s march considerably ref=
reshed by meeting one who in=20

a foreign land, far from home ties and moral influences, yet still pursued =
the simple practice of the=20

faith which he had learned at home.  Luque, upon its little hill, the Campo=
 Grande, like a dry lake,=20

surrounded by thick woods on every side, and then the Recoleta, we passed, =
and entering the red=20

sandy road made at the conquest to move troops upon, we saw the churches of=
 Asuncion only a=20

league away.  And yet we lingered, walking our horses slowly in the deep re=
d sand, passing the=20

strings of countrywomen with baskets on their heads, driving their donkeys =
packed with sugar-

cane, and smoking as they went; we lingered, feeling that the trip was done=
; not that we minded=20

that our fortunes were not made, but vaguely felt that for the last five mo=
nths we had lived a time=20

which in our lives we should not see again, and fearing rather than looking=
 forward to all the=20

approaching change.  The horses too were fat, in good condition, had become=
 old friends, knew=20

us so well we never tied them, but all night in camp left them to feed, bei=
ng certain that they would=20

not stray; and thus to leave them at the end of a long trip seemed as unrea=
sonable as to part from=20

an old friend simply because death calls.  The road grew wider, passed thro=
ugh some scattered=20

houses, buried in orange and guayaba trees, ran through some open patches w=
here grew wild=20



indigo and castor-oil plants, with a low palm-scrub, entered a rancheria ju=
st outside the town, and=20

then turned to a sandy street which merged in a great market, where, as it =
seemed, innumerable=20

myriads were assembled, all chattering at once, or so it struck us coming f=
rom the open solitary=20

plains and the dark silent woods.  The lowness of the river having stopped =
the Brazilian mail-boat=20

from coming down from Corumba, we put up at the =E2=80=9CCasa Horrocks,=E2=
=80=9D the resort of all the waifs and=20

strays storm-bound in Paraguay.  The town buried in vegetation, the sandy s=
treets, all of them=20

watercourses after a night=E2=80=99s rain, the listless life, the donkeys s=
traying to and fro, the white-robed=20

women, with their hair hanging down their backs, and cut square on the fore=
head after the style so=20

usual amongst Iceland ponies, the great unfinished palaces, the squares wit=
h grass five or six=20

inches high, and over all the reddish haze blending the=20


_
irreverently. "When did you come from the country, old Goggles?"  "My son, =
you should address=20

me with more respect."  "Just get out of the way, mister! I don't want to h=
ear no preachin'."  "I am=20

afraid you have been badly brought up, my son."  "I ain't your son, and I w=
ouldn't be for a shillin'.=20

Just you go along, and let me alone!"  "A sad case of depravity, my dear," =
remarked Mr. Barnes to=20

his wife. "I fear we must leave these boys to their evil ways."  "You'd bet=
ter," said one of the boys.=20

"They're smart little rascals!" said Mr. Montgomery, when they were out of =
hearing of the boys. "I=20

took them in, though. They thought I was the genuine article."  "We'd bette=
r not waste any more=20

time," said his wife. "That boy might get out, you know, and give us troubl=
e."  "I don't believe he=20

will get out in a hurry. I locked the door and he'd have to pound some time=
 before he could make=20

any one hear, I declare, I should like to see how he looked when he recover=
ed from his stupor,=20

and realized that his ring was gone."  "What sort of boy was he, Tony?"  "B=
etter not call me by that=20

name, my dear. It might be heard, you know, and might not be considered in =
character. As to your=20

question, he was by no means a stupid boy. Rather sharpish, I should say." =
 "Then how came he=20

to let you take him in?"  "As to that, I claim to be rather sharp myself, a=
nd quite a match even for a=20

smart boy. I haven't knocked about the world forty-four years for nothing."=
  They were now in=20

Broadway. Turning the corner of Amity street, they walked a short distance =
downtown, and paused=20

before the handsome jewelry store of Ball & Black.  "I think we had better =
go in here," said Felix=20

Montgomery--(I hesitate a little by which of his numerous names to call him=
).  "Why not go to=20

Tiffany's?"  "I gather from what the boy told me that the ring has already =
been offered there. It=20

would be very likely to be recognized and that would be awkward, you know."=
  "Are you sure the=20

ring has not been offered here? asked his wife.  "Quite sure. The boy would=
 have mentioned it,=20

had such been the case."  "Very well. Let us go in then."  The Rev. Mr. Bar=
nes and his wife, of=20

Hayfield Centre; entered the elegant store, and ten minutes later Paul Hoff=
man entered also, and=20

took his station at the counters wholly unconscious of the near proximity o=
f the man who had so=20

artfully swindled him.    CHAPTER XXI  PAUL IS CHECKMATED  On entering the =
large jewelry=20

store Mr. Montgomery and his wife walked to the rear of the store, and adva=
nced to the counter,=20

behind which stood a clerk unengaged.  "What shall I show you?" he inquired=
  "I didn't come to=20

purchase," said Mr. Montgomery, with suavity, "but to sell. I suppose you p=
urchase jewelry at=20

times?"  "Sometimes," said the clerk. "Let me see what you have."  "First,"=
 said the adventurer, "let=20

me introduce myself. I am the Rev. Mr. Barnes, of Hayfield Centre, Connecti=
cut. You perhaps=20

know the place?"  "I don't think I remember it," said the clerk, respectful=
ly.  "It is a small place,"=20

said Mr. Montgomery, modestly, "but my tastes are plain and unobtrusive, an=
d I do not aspire to a=20

more conspicuous post. However, that is not to the purpose. A lady parishio=
ner, desiring to donate=20

a portion of her wealth to the poor, has placed in my hand a diamond ring, =
the proceeds to be=20

devoted to charitable objects. I desire to sell it, and, knowing the high r=
eputation of your firm feel=20

safe in offering it to you. I know very little of the value of such things,=
 since they are not in my line,=20

but I am sure of fair treatment at your hands."  "You may depend upon that,=
" said the clerk,=20

favorably impressed with the appearance and manners of his customer. "Allow=
 me to see the=20

ring."  The brilliant was handed over the counter.  "It is quite valuable,"=
 said he, scrutinizing it=20

closely.  "So I supposed, as the lady is possessed of wealth. You may rely =
upon its being=20

genuine."  "I am not authorized to purchase," said the clerk, "but I will s=
how it to one of the firm."=20

Just at that moment, Mr. Montgomery, chancing to look toward the door, was =
startled by seeing=20



the entrance of Paul Hoffman. He saw that it would be dangerous to carry th=
e negotiation any=20

farther and he quickly gave a secret signal to his wife.  The hint was inst=
antly understood and=20

acted upon.  Mrs. Montgomery uttered a slight cry, and clung to her husband=
's arm.  "My dear,"=20

she said, "I Chaco into a copper-coloured whole at sunset, rise to my memor=
y like the reflection of=20

a dream.  A dream seen in a convex mirror, opening away from me as years ha=
ve passed, the=20

actual things, men, actions, and occurrences of daily life seem swollen in =
it at the far end of some=20

perspective, but the impression of the whole fresh and clear-cut in memory,=
 standing out as boldly=20

as the last day when on the =E2=80=9CPateador=E2=80=9D I had a farewell gal=
lop on the beach.  Adios, =E2=80=9CPateador,=E2=80=9D or=20

=E2=80=9Ctill so long=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94horses will be born as good, better,=
 ten thousand times more valuable, and dogs will=20

eat them, but for myself, and for the owner of the =E2=80=9CBayo Overo,=E2=
=80=9D not all the coursers of the sun=20

could stir the reminiscences of youth, of lonely camping-grounds, long nigh=
ts in drenching rain,=20

struggles with wind, wild gallops in the dark; the hopes and fears of the f=
ive months when we went=20

fortune-seeking, and by God=E2=80=99s mercy failed in our search, as the me=
re mention of those names=20

forgotten to all the world except ourselves.  Eight or ten days had passed =
away, and we grew quite=20

familiar with the chief features of the place, having made acquaintance wit=
h the Brazilian officers=20

of the army and the fleet, the German apothecary, with Dr. Stewart, the chi=
ef European of the=20

place, when news came that the Brazilian mail-boat had at last arrived.  We=
 bade our friends=20

good-bye, entrusted both our horses to the care of Horrocks, fed them ourse=
lves for the last time,=20

and went on board the ship; a coppery haze hung over everything, the heat r=
aising a faint=20

quivering in the air, the thick yellowish water of the stream lapping again=
st the vessel=E2=80=99s sides like=20

oil, the boat shoved off, our friends perspiring in the sun raising a washe=
d-out cheer.  The vessel=20

swung into the stream, her paddles turned, the great green flag with the or=
ange crown imperial=20

flapped at the jackstaff, and the town dropped rapidly astern.  A quarter o=
f a league and the church=20

towers, tall palm-trees, the unfinished palaces, and the great theatre bega=
n to fade into the haze.=20

Then sheering a little to the Left bank, the vessel passed a narrow tongue =
of land covered with=20

grass, whereon two horses fed.  As we drew nearer I saw they were our own, =
and jumping on the=20

taffrail shouted =E2=80=9CAdios,=E2=80=9D at which they raised their heads,=
 or perhaps raised them but at the=20

snorting steamer, and as they looked we passed racing down stream, and by d=
egrees they=20

became dimmer, smaller, less distinct, and at the last melted and vanished =
into the reddish haze.=20

IN A GERMAN TRAMP   THE tall, flaxen-haired stewardess Matilda had finished=
 cutting=20

Schwartzbrod and had gone to bed.  The Danish boarhound slept heavily under=
 the lee of the=20

chicken-coops, the six or seven cats were upon the cabin sofa, and with the=
 wind from the south-

west, raising a terrific sea, and sending showers of spray flying over the =
tops of the black rocks=20

which fringed the town, the S.S. _Oldenburg_ got under way and staggered ou=
t into the gut.  The=20

old white city girt on the seaward side by its breakwater of tall black roc=
ks, the houses dazzlingly=20

white, the crenelated walls, the long stretch of sand, extending to the bel=
t of grey-green scrub and=20

backed in the distance by the sombre forest, lay in the moonlight as distin=
ct and clear as it had=20

been mid-day.  Clearer perhaps, for the sun in a sandy landscape seems to b=
lur the outlines which=20

the moon reveals; so that throughout North Africa night is the time to see =
a town in all its beauty of=20

effect.  The wind lifting the sand, drifted it whistling through the standi=
ng rigging of the tramp,=20

coating the scarce dried paint, and making paint, rigging, and everything o=
n board feel like a piece=20

of shark-skin to the touch.  The vessel groaned and laboured in the surface=
 sea, and on the port=20



quarter rose the rocks of the low island which forms the harbour, leaving a=
n entrance of about half-

a-mile between its shores and the rocks which guard the town.  West-south-w=
est a little westerly,=20

the wind ever increased; the sea lashed on the vessel=E2=80=99s quarter, an=
d in spite of the dense volumes=20

of black smoke and showers of sparks flying out from the salt-coated smoke-=
stack, the tramp=20

seemed to stand still.  Upon the bridge the skipper screamed hoarsely in Pl=
att-Deutsch down his=20

connection-tube to the chief engineer; men came and went in dirty blue chec=
k cotton clothes and=20

wooden shoes; occasionally=20


_
quickly.  "My wife is suddenly taken sick," said Mr. Montgomery, hurriedly.=
  "She is subject to fits. If=20

you will give me the ring, I will return to-morrow and negotiate for its sa=
le."  "I am very sorry," said=20

the clerk, with sympathy, handing back the ring. "Can I get anything for th=
e lady?"  "No, thank you.=20

The best thing to do is to get her into the open air. Thank you for your ki=
ndness."  "Let me help=20

you," said the clerk, and coming from behind the counter he took one arm of=
 Mrs. Montgomery,=20

who, leaning heavily on her husband and the clerk, walked, or rather was ca=
rried, to the street=20

door.  Of course, the attention of all within the store was drawn to the pa=
rty.  "What was the=20

matter?" inquired a fellow-clerk, as the salesman returned.  "It was a cler=
gyman from Connecticut,=20

who wished to sell a diamond ring, given to him for charitable purposes. Hi=
s wife was taken=20

suddenly sick. He will bring it back to-morrow."  "Was the ring a valuable =
one?"  "It must be worth=20

in the neighborhood of three hundred dollars."  Paul listened to this expla=
nation, and a sudden=20

light flashed upon him, as he heard the estimated value of the ring. There =
had been something=20

familiar in the appearance of the adventurer, though, on account of his suc=
cessful disguise and his=20

being accompanied by a lady, he had not before felt any suspicion as to his=
 identity with the man=20

who had swindled him. Now he felt convinced that it was Mr. Felix Montgomer=
y, and that it was his=20

own appearance which had led to the sudden sickness and the precipitate dep=
arture.  "That trick=20

won't work, Mr. Montgomery," he said to himself. "I've got on your track so=
oner than I anticipated,=20

and I mean to follow you up."  Reaching the sidewalk, he caught sight of Mr=
. and Mrs.=20

Montgomery just turning the corner of a side street. The pair supposed they=
 were safe, not=20

thinking that our hero had recognized them, and the lady no longer exhibite=
d illness, and was=20

walking briskly at her husband's side. Paul hurried up and tapped the adven=
turer on the shoulder.=20

Mr. Montgomery, turning, was annoyed on finding that he had not yet escaped=
. He determined,=20

however, to stick to his false character, and deny all knowledge of the mor=
ning's transaction.=20

"Well, my young friend," he said, "do you want me? I believe I have not the=
 pleasure of your=20

acquaintance."  "You are mistaken there, Mr. Felix Montgomery," said Paul, =
significantly.  "By what=20

name did you address me?" said the swindler, assuming a tone of surprise.  =
"I addressed you as=20

Mr. Felix Montgomery."  "You have made a mistake, my good friend. I am an h=
umble clergyman=20

from Connecticut. I am called the Rev. Mr. Barnes. Should you ever visit Ha=
yfield Centre, I shall=20

be glad to receive a call from you."  "When I last met you, you were a jewe=
ler from Syracuse," said=20

Paul, bluntly.  Mr. Montgomery laughed heartily.  "My dear," he said, turni=
ng to his wife, "is not this=20

an excellent joke? My young friend here thinks he recognizes in me a jewele=
r from Syracuse."=20

"Indeed, you are quite mistaken," said the lady. "My husband is a country m=
inister. We came up to=20

the city this morning on a little business."  "I understand on what busines=
s," said Paul. "You=20

wanted to dispose of a diamond ring."  Mr. Montgomery was disposed to deny =
the charge, but a=20

moment's reflection convinced him that it would be useless, as Paul had dou=
btless been informed=20

in Ball & Black's of his business there. He decided to put on a bold front =
and admit it.  "I suppose=20

you were in Ball & Black's just now," he said.  "I was."  "And so learned m=
y business there? But I=20

am at a loss to understand why you should be interested in the matter."  "T=
hat ring is mine," said=20

Paul. "You swindled me out of it this morning."  "My young friend, you must=
 certainly be insane,"=20

said Mr. Montgomery, shrugging his shoulders. "My dear, did you hear that?"=
  "He is an impudent=20

boy," said the lady. "I am surprised that you should be willing to talk to =
him."  "If you leave here I=20

will put a policeman on your track," said Paul.  He looked so determined th=
at Mr. Montgomery=20



found that he must parley.  "You are under a strange hallucination, my youn=
g friend," he said. "If=20

you will walk along with me, I think I can convince you of your mistake."  =
"There is no mistake=20

about the matter," said Paul, walking on with them. "The ring is mine, and =
I must have it."  "My=20

dear, will you explain about the ring? He may credit your testimony."  "I d=
on't see that any=20

explanation is necessary," said the lady. "However, since you wish it, I wi=
ll say that the ring was=20

handed you by Mrs. Benton, a wealthy lady of your parish, with instructions=
 to sell it, and devote=20

the proceeds to charitable purposes."  "Is that explanation satisfactory?" =
asked Mr. Montgomery.=20

"No, it is not," said Paul, resolutely. "I don't believe one word of it. I =
recognize you in spite of your=20

dress. You gave me chloroform this morning in a room in Lovejoy's Hotel, an=
d when I was=20

unconscious you made off with the ring which I expected to sell you. You ha=
d better return it, or I=20

will call a policeman."  "I am not the person you take me for," said Felix =
Montgomery.  "You are the=20

jeweler from Syracuse who swindled me out of my ring."  "I never was a jewe=
ler, and never lived in=20

Syracuse," said the adventurer, with entire truth.  "You may be right, but =
that is what you told me=20

this morning."  "I wish you would go away, and cease to annoy us," said the=
 lady, impatiently.  "I=20

want my ring."  "We have no ring of yours."  "Show me the ring, and if it i=
s not mine I will go away."=20

"You are a very impudent fellow, upon my word," said Mrs. Montgomery, sharp=
ly, "to accuse a=20

gentleman like my husband of taking your ring. I don't believe you ever had=
 one."  "My dear,"=20

interposed her husband, mildly, "I dare say my young friend here really thi=
nks we have his ring. Of=20

course it is a great mistake. Imagine what our friends in Hayfield Centre w=
ould think of such a=20

charge! But you must remember that he is unacquainted with my standing in t=
he community. In=20

order to satisfy his mind, I am willing to let him see the ring."  "To let =
him see the ring?" repeated=20

the lady, in surprise.  "Yes. Here, my lad," taking the ring from his pocke=
t, "this is the ring. You will=20

see at once that it is not yours."  "I see that it is mine," said Paul, tak=
ing the proffered ring, and=20

preparing to go, astonished at his own good fortune in so easily recovering=
 it.  "Not so fast!"=20

exclaimed Mr. Montgomery, seizing him by the shoulder. "Help! Police!"  An =
officer had turned the=20

corner just before, and it was this that had suggested the trap. He came up=
 quickly, and, looking=20

keenly from one to the other, inquired what was the matter.  "This boy has =
just purloined a ring=20

from my wife," said Mr. Montgomery. "Fortunately I caught him in the act." =
 "Give up the ring, you=20

young scoundrel!" said the officer, imposed upon by the clerical appearance=
 of the adventurer.  "It=20

is mine," said Paul.  "None of your gammon! Give up the ring, and come with=
 me."  The ring was=20

restored to Mr. Montgomery, who overwhelmed the officer with a profusion of=
 thanks.  "It is not a=20

diamond, only an imitation," he said, "but my wife values it as the gift of=
 a friend. Don't be too hard=20

on the boy. He may not be so bad as he seems."  "I'll attend to him," said =
the policeman,=20

emphatically. "I'll learn him to rob ladies of rings in the street. Come al=
ong, sir!"  Paul tried to=20

explain matters, but no attention was paid to his protestations. To his ang=
er and mortification he=20

saw the swindler make off triumphantly with the ring, while he, the wronged=
 owner, was arrested=20

as a thief.  But at the station-house he had his revenge. He was able to pr=
ove to his captor that he=20

had lodged information against Mr. Montgomery, and the policeman in turn wa=
s mortified to think=20

how readily he had been imposed upon. Of course Paul was set free, but the =
officer's blundering=20

interference seemed to render the recovery of the ring more doubtful than e=
ver.    CHAPTER XXII=20

A MAN OF RESOURCES  "Well, that was a narrow escape," said Mr. Montgomery, =
with a sigh of=20

relief. "I think I managed rather cleverly, eh?"  "I wanted to box the boys=
 ears," said Mrs.=20



Montgomery, sharply.  "It wouldn't have been in character, my dear. Ha, ha!=
" he laughed, softly,=20

"we imposed upon the officer neatly. Our young friend got rather the worst =
of it."  "Why don't you=20

call things by their right names? He isn't much of a friend."  "Names are o=
f no consequence, my=20

dear."  "Well, what are you going to do next?" asked the lady, abruptly.  "=
About the ring?"  "Of=20

course."  "I hardly know," said Mr. Montgomery, reflectively. "If it were n=
ot for appearing too=20

anxious, I would go back to Ball & Black's now that our young friend is oth=
erwise engaged, and=20

can't interrupt us."  "Suppose we go?"  "Well, you see, it might be conside=
red rather soon for you=20

to recover from your fit. Besides, I don't know what stories this boy may h=
ave thought fit to tell=20

about us."  "He didn't have time to say anything."  "Perhaps you are right.=
"  "We want to dispose of=20

the ring as soon as possible, and leave the city."  "That is true. Well, if=
 you say so, we will go=20

back."  "It seems to me now is the best time. The boy will tell his story t=
o the officer and we may be=20

inquired for."  "Then, my dear, I will follow your advice."  Mr. and Mrs. M=
ontgomery turned, and=20

directed their steps again toward Broadway. The distance was short, and fif=
teen minutes had=20

scarcely elapsed since they left the store before they again entered it. Th=
ey made their way to the=20

lower end of the store and accosted the same clerk with whom they had befor=
e spoken.  "Is your=20

wife better?" he asked.  "Much better, thank you. A turn in the air always =
relieves her, and she is=20

quite herself again. I have returned because it is necessary for me to leav=
e the city by the evening=20

train, and my time is, therefore, short. Will you be kind enough to show th=
e ring to your employer,=20

and ask him if he will purchase?"  The clerk returned, and said that the fi=
rm would pay two=20

hundred and fifty dollars, but must be assured of his right to dispose of i=
t.  "Did you mention my=20

name?" asked the adventurer.  "I mentioned that you were a clergyman. I cou=
ld not remember the=20

name."  "The Rev. Mr. Barnes, of Hayfield Centre, Connecticut. I have been =
preaching there for--is=20

it six or seven years, my dear?"  "Seven," said his wife.  "I should think =
that would be sufficient.=20

You may mention that to Mr. Ball or Mr. Black, if you please. I presume aft=
er that he will not be=20

afraid to purchase."  Mr. Montgomery said this with an air of conscious res=
pectability and high=20

standing, which might readily impose upon strangers. But, by bad luck, what=
 he had said was=20

heard by a person able to confute him.  "Did you say you were from Hayfield=
 Centre?" asked a=20

gentleman, standing a few feet distant.  "Yes," said Mr. Montgomery.  "I th=
ink you said your name=20

was Barnes?"  "Yes, sir."  "And that you have been preaching there for the =
last seven years?"=20

"Yes, sir," answered Mr. Montgomery, but there was rather less confidence i=
n his tone. In fact he=20

was beginning to feel uneasy.  "It is very strange," said the other. "I hav=
e a sister living in Hayfield=20

Centre, and frequently visit the place myself, and so of course know someth=
ing of it. Yet I have=20

never heard of any clergyman named Barnes preaching there."  Mr. Montgomery=
 saw that things=20

looked critical.  "You are strangely mistaken, sir," he said. "However, I w=
ill not press the sale. If=20

you will return the ring (to the clerk) I will dispose of it elsewhere."  B=
ut the clerk's suspicions had=20

been aroused by what had been said.  "I will first speak to Mr. Ball," he s=
aid.  "There is no=20

occasion to speak to him. I shall not sell the ring to-day. To-morrow, I wi=
ll come with witnesses=20

whose testimony will outweigh that of this gentleman, who I suspect never w=
as in Hayfield Centre=20

in his life. I will trouble you for the ring."  "I hope you don't intend to=
 give it to him," said the=20

gentleman. "The presumption is that, as he is masquerading, he has not come=
 by it honestly."  "I=20

shall not deign to notice your insinuations," said Mr. Montgomery, who conc=
ealed beneath a=20

consequential tone his real uneasiness. "The ring, if you please."  "Don't =
give it to him."  As the=20



clerk seemed disinclined to surrender the ring, Mr. Montgomery said: "Young=
 man, you will find it=20

to be a serious matter to withhold my property."  "Perhaps I had better giv=
e it to him," said the=20

clerk, imposed upon by the adventurer's manner.  "Require him to prove prop=
erty. If it is really his,=20

he can readily do this."  "My dear," said the Rev. Mr. Barnes, "we will lea=
ve the store."  "What, and=20

leave the ring?"  "For the present. I will invoke the aid of the police to =
save me from being robbed=20

in this extraordinary manner."  He walked to the street door, accompanied b=
y his wife. He was=20

deeply disappointed at the failure of the sale, and would gladly have wreak=
ed vengeance upon the=20

stranger who had prevented it. But he saw that his safety required an immed=
iate retreat. In=20

addition to his own disappointment, he had to bear his wife's censure.  "If=
 you had the spirit of a=20

man, Mr. Montgomery," she commenced, "you wouldn't have given up that ring =
so easily. He had=20

no business to keep it."  "I would have called in a policeman if I dared, b=
ut you know I am not on=20

the best of terms with these gentlemen."  "Are we to lose the ring, then?" =
 "I am afraid so, unless I=20

can make them believe in the store that I am really what I pretend to be." =
 "Can't you do it?"  "Not=20

very easily, unless stay, I have an idea. Do you see that young man?"  He d=
irected his wife's=20

attention to a young man, evidently fresh from the country, who was approac=
hing, staring open-

eyed at the unwonted sights of the city. He was dressed in a blue coat with=
 brass buttons, while=20

his pantaloons, of a check pattern, terminated rather higher up than was in=
 accordance with the=20

fashion.  "Yes, I see him," said Mrs. Montgomery. "What of him?"  "I am goi=
ng to recover the ring=20

through his help."  "I don't see how."  "You will see."  "How do you do?" s=
aid the adventurer,=20

cordially, advancing to the young man, and seizing his hand.  "Pretty smart=
," said the countryman,=20

looking surprised.  "Are your parents quite well?"  "They're so's to be aro=
und."  "When did you=20

come to the city?"  "This mornin'."  "Do you stay any length of time?"  "I'=
m goin' back this=20

afternoon."  "You didn't expect to meet me now, did you?" asked Mr. Montgom=
ery.  "I s'pose I'd=20

orter know you," said the perplexed youth, "but I can't think what your nam=
e is."  "What! Not know=20

Mr. Barnes, the minister of Hayfield Centre? Don't you remember hearing me =
preach for your=20

minister?"  "Seems to me I do," answered the young man, persuading himself =
that he ought to=20

remember.  "Of course you do. Now, my young friend, I am very glad to have =
met you."  "So am I,"=20

said the other, awkwardly.  "You can do me a favor, if you will."  "Of cour=
se, I will," said Jonathan,=20

"if it's anything I can do."  "Yes, you will have no trouble about it. You =
see, I went into a jeweler's=20

near by to sell a valuable ring, and they wanted to make sure I was really =
a minister, and not=20

intending to cheat them. If you will go in with me, and say that you have o=
ften heard me preach,=20

and that I am the Rev. Mr. Barnes, of Hayfield Centre, I won't mind paying =
you five dollars for your=20

trouble."  "All right; I'll do it," said the rustic, considering that it wo=
uld be an unusually easy way of=20

earning few dollars.  "You'll remember the name, won't you?"  "Yes--Parson =
Barnes, of Hayfield=20

Centre."  "That is right. The store is near by. Walk along with us, and we =
will be there in five=20

minutes."    CHAPTER XXIII  A NEW EXPEDIENT  "I believe your name is Peck?"=
 said Mr.=20

Montgomery, hazarding a guess.  "No, it's Young, Ephraim Young."  "Of cours=
e it is. I remember=20

now, but I am apt to forget names. You said your parents were quite well?" =
 "Yes, they're pretty=20

smart."  "I am glad to hear it; I have the pleasantest recollections of you=
r excellent father. Let me=20

see, didn't you call there with me once, Mrs. Barnes?"  "Not that I remembe=
r."  "You must go with=20

me the next time. I want you to know the parents of our young friend. They =
are excellent people.=20

Do you go back this afternoon, Mr. Young?"  "Yes, I guess so. You don't kno=
w of any sitooation I=20



could get in a store round here, do you?"  "Not at present, but I have some=
 influential friends to=20

whom I will mention your name. Suppose, now, I could obtain a situation for=
 you, how shall I direct=20

the letter letting you know?"  "Just put on the letter 'Ephraim Young.' Eve=
rybody in Plainfield knows=20

me."  "So he lives in Plainfield," said Mr. Montgomery to himself. "It's as=
 well to know that." Then=20

aloud: "I won't forget, Mr. Young. What sort of business would you prefer?"=
  "Any kind that'll pay,"=20

said the gratified youth, firmly convinced of his companion's ability to fu=
lfill his promise. "I've got=20

tired of stayin' round home, and I'd like to try York a little while. Folks=
 say it's easy to make money=20

here."  "You are right. If I were a business man, I would come to New York =
at once. For a smart=20

young man like you it offers a much better opening than a country village."=
  "That's what I've told=20

dad often," said the rustic, "but he's afraid I wouldn't get nothing to do =
and he says it's dreadful=20

expensive livin' here."  "So it is expensive, but then you will be better p=
aid than in the country.=20

However, here we are. You won't forget what I told you?"  "No--I'll remembe=
r," said the young=20

man.  The reappearance of Mr. Barnes and wife so soon excited some surprise=
 in the store, for it=20

had got around, as such things will, that he was an impostor, and it was su=
pposed that he would=20

not venture to show his face there again. The appearance of his rustic comp=
anion likewise=20

attracted attention. Certainly, Mr. Montgomery (it makes little difference =
what we call him) did not=20

exhibit the slightest appearance of apprehension, but his manner was quite =
cool and self-

possessed. He made his way to that part of the counter attended by the cler=
k with whom he had=20

before spoken. He observed with pleasure and relief that the man who had qu=
estioned his identity=20

with any of the ministers of Hayfield Centre was no longer in the store. Th=
is would make the=20

recovery of the ring considerably easier.  "Well, sir," he said, addressing=
 the clerk, "I suppose you=20

did not expect to see me again so soon?"  "No, sir."  "Nor did I expect to =
be able to return for the=20

ring before to-morrow, not supposing that I could bring witnesses to prove =
that I was what I=20

represented. But fortunately I met just now a young friend, who can testify=
 to my identity, as he=20

has heard me preach the hatch, and looking seaward for a moment, scooped of=
f the sweat from=20

his forefinger, muttered, =E2=80=9CGott freduma,=E2=80=9D and went below; e=
ven the Arab deck-hands, roused into=20

activity, essayed to set a staysail, and the whole ship, shaken between the=
 storm and the=20

exertions of the crew, trembled and shivered in the yeasty sea.  Nearer the=
 rocks appeared, and=20

the white town grew clearer, more intensely white, the sea frothed round th=
e vessel, and the=20

skipper advancing to a missionary seated silently gazing across the water w=
ith a pallid sea-green=20

face, slapped him upon the back, and with an oath said, =E2=80=9CMister, wi=
ll you have one glass of beer?=E2=80=9D=20

The Levite in partibus, clad in his black alpaca Norfolk jacket, grey greas=
y flannel shirt and paper=20

collar, with the whole man surmounted by the inevitable pith soup-tureen-sh=
aped hat, the trade-

mark of his confraternity, merely pressed both his hands harder upon his di=
aphragm and groaned.=20

=E2=80=9COne leetel glass beer, I have it from Olten, fifty dozen of it.  P=
erhaps all to be wasted; have a=20

glass beer, it will do your shtomag good.=E2=80=9D  The persecuted United P=
resbyterian ambulant broke=20

silence with one of those pious ejaculations which do duty (in the congrega=
tions) for an oath, and=20

taking up his parable, fixing the pith tureen upon his head with due precau=
tion, said, =E2=80=9CCaptain, ye=20

see I am a total abstainer, joined in the Whifflet, and in addeetion I feel=
 my stomach sort o=E2=80=99=20

discomposed.=E2=80=9D  And to him again, good Captain Rindelhaus rejoined, =
=E2=80=9CWell, Mister Missionary, do=20

you see dat rocks?=E2=80=9D  The Reverend Mr. McKerrochar, squinting to lee=
ward with an agonizing stare,=20

admitted that he did, but qualified by saying, =E2=80=9Cthere was sic a hal=
gh, he was na sure that they were=20



rocks at all.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot rocks!  Kreuz-Sacrament, dose rocks yo=
u see are sharp as razors, and the=20

back-wash off them give you no jance; I dell you, sheep=E2=80=99s-head prea=
cher, dat point de way like=20

signboard and not follow it oop himself, you better take glass beer in time=
, for if the schip not=20

gather headway in about five minutes you perhaps not get another jance.=E2=
=80=9D  After this dictum, he=20

stood looking into the night, his glass gripped in his left hand, and in hi=
s right a half-smoked-out=20

cigar, which he put to his mouth mechanically now and then, but drew no smo=
ke from it.  The=20

missionary too looked at the rocks with increased interest, and the Arab pi=
lot staggering up the=20

ladder to the bridge stolidly pointed to the surf, and gave us his opinion,=
 that =E2=80=9Che, the captain and=20

the faqui would soon be past the help of prayer,=E2=80=9D piously adding, =
=E2=80=9Cthat it seemed Allah=E2=80=99s will;=20

although he thought the Kaffirs, sons of burnt Kaffirs, in the stoke-hole w=
ere not firing up.=E2=80=9D  With=20

groans and heavings, with long shivers which came over her as the sea struc=
k her on the beam,=20

the vessel fought for her life, belching great clouds of smoke out into the=
 clear night air.  Captain=20

and missionary, pilot and crew, stood gazing at the sea; the captain now an=
d then yelling some=20

unintelligible Platt-Deutsch order down the tube; the missionary fumbling w=
ith a Bible lettered=20

=E2=80=9CPolyglot,=E2=80=9D covered in black oil-cloth; and the pilot passi=
ng his beads between the fingers of his=20

right hand, his eyes apparently not seeing anything; and it seemed as if an=
other twenty minutes=20

must have seen them all upon the rocks.  But Allah perhaps was on the watch=
; and the wind falling=20

for an instant, or the burnt Kaffirs in the stoke-hole having struck a bett=
er vein of coal, the rusty=20

iron sea-coffin slowly gathered headway, staggered as the engines driven to=
 the highest pressure=20

seemed to tear out her ribs, and forged ahead.  Then lurching in the sea, t=
he screw occasionally=20

racing with a roar, and the black decks dripping and under water, the scupp=
ers being choked with=20

the filth of years, she sidled out to sea, and rose and fell in the long ro=
llers outside the harbour,=20

which came in from the west.  Rindelhaus set her on her course, telling the=
 Arab helmsman in the=20

pigeon-English which served them as a means of interchanging their few idea=
s, =E2=80=9Cto keep her head=20

north and by west a little northerly, and let him know when they were abrea=
st of Jibel Hadid;=E2=80=9D=20

adding a condemnation of the Arab race in general and the particular sailor=
, whom he=20

characterized as a =E2=80=9Ctamned heaven dog, not worth his kraut.=E2=80=
=9D  The sailor, dressed in loose Arab=20

trousers and a blue jersey, the whole surmounted by a greasy fez, replied: =
=E2=80=9CYes, him know Jibel=20

Hadid, captain, him keep her head north and by west all right,=E2=80=9D and=
 probably also consigned the=20

captain and the whole Germanic race to the hottest corner of Jehannum, and =
so both men were=20

pleased.  The boarhound gambolled on the deck, Matilda peeped up the compan=
ion, her dripping=20

wooden shoes looking like waterlogged canoes, and the Scotch missionary beg=
an to walk about,=20

holding his monstrous hat on with one hand and hugging the oilskin-covered =
=E2=80=9CPolyglot=E2=80=9D under his=20

left arm.  Crossing the skipper in his walk, in a more cheerful humour he v=
entured to remark: =E2=80=9CEh!=20

captain, maybe I could mak=E2=80=99 a shape at yon glass of beer the now.=
=E2=80=9D  But things had changed, and=20

Rindelhaus looked at him with the usual uncondescending bearing of the seam=
an to the mere=20

passenger, and said: =E2=80=9CNein, you loose your obbordunity for dat glas=
s beer, my friend, and now I=20

have to navigate my ship.=E2=80=9D  The _Oldenburg_ pursued the devious ten=
or of her way, touching at=20

ports which all were either open roadsteads or had bars on which the surf b=
oiled with a noise like=20

thunder; receiving cargo in driblets, a sack or two of marjoram, a bale of =
goatskins or of hides, two=20

or three bags of wool, and sometimes waiting for a day or two unable to com=
municate until the surf=20

went down.  The captain spent his time in harbour fishing uninterestedly, c=
atching great bearded=20



spiky-finned sea-monsters which he left to die upon the deck.  Not that he =
was hard-hearted, but=20

merely unimaginative, after the way of those who, loving sport for the plea=
sure it affords=20

themselves, hotly deny that it is cruel, or that it can occasion inconvenie=
nce to any participator in a=20

business which they themselves enjoy.  So the poor innocent sea-monsters fl=
oundered in slimy=20

agony upon the deck; the boarhound and the cats taking a share in martyring=
 them, tearing and=20

biting at them as they gasped their lives away; condemned to agony for some=
 strange reason, or=20

perhaps because, as every living thing is born to suffer, they were endurin=
g but their fair=20

proportion, as they happened to be fish.  Pathetic but unwept, the tragedy =
of all the animals, and=20

we but links in the same chain with them, look at it all as unconcerned as =
gods.  But as the=20

bearded spiky fish gasped on the deck the missionary tried to abridge their=
 agony with a belaying-

pin; covering himself with blood and slime, and setting up the back of Capt=
ain Rindelhaus, who=20

vowed his deck should not be hammered =E2=80=9Clike a skidel alley, all for=
 the sake of half-a-dozen fish,=20

which would be dead in half-an-hour and eaten by the cats.=E2=80=9D  The ma=
rvels of our commerce, in the=20

shape of Waterbury watches, scissors and looking-glasses, beads, Swiss cloc=
ks, and musical-

boxes, all duly dumped, and the off-scouring of the trade left by the large=
r ships duly received on=20

board, the _Oldenburg_ stumbled out to sea if the wind was not too strong, =
and squirmed along=20

the coast.  Occasionally upon arrival at a port the sound of psalmody was h=
eard, and a missionary=20

boat put off to pass the time of God with their brother on the ship.  Then =
came the greetings, as=20

the whole party sat on the fiddlee gratings jammed up against the funnel; t=
he latest news from the=20

Cowcaddens and the gossip from along the coast was duly interchanged.  Gaun=
t-featured girls,=20

removed by physical conditions from all temptation, sat and talked with scr=
aggy, freckled, and pith-

hatted men.  It was all conscience, and relatively tender heart, and as the=
 moon lit up the dirty=20

decks, they paraded up and down, happy once more to be secure even for a br=
ief space from=20

insult, and to feel themselves at home.  Dressed in white blouses, innocent=
 of stays, with skirts=20

which no belt known to milliners could ever join to the body or the blouse;=
 with smaller-sized pith=20

hats, sand-shoes and spectacles; their hands in Berlin gloves, and freckles=
 reaching far down=20

upon their necks, they formed a crushing argument in their own persons agai=
nst polygamy.  Still,=20

in the main, all kindly souls, and some with a twinkle in their white-eyela=
shed steel-grey eyes, as=20

of a Congregationalist bull-terrier, which showed you that they would gladl=
y suffer martyrdom=20

without due cause, or push themselves into great danger, out of sheer ignor=
ance and want of=20

knowledge of mankind.  Life=E2=80=99s misfits, most of them; their hands ea=
rly inured to typewriting=20

machines, their souls, as they would say, =E2=80=9Csair hodden doon in pray=
er;=E2=80=9D carefully educated to be=20

ashamed of any scrap of womanhood they might possess. Still they were sympa=
thetic, for=20

sympathy is near akin to tears, and looking at them one divined they must h=
ave shed tears=20

plentifully, enough to wash away any small sins they had committed in their=
 lives.  The men,=20

sunburnt yet sallow, seemed nourished on tinned meats and mineral table-wat=
ers; their necks=20

scraggy and red protruded from their collars like those of vultures; they c=
arried umbrellas in their=20

hands from early habit of a wet climate, and seemed as if they had been cho=
sen after much=20

cogitation by some unskilled commission, for their unfitness for their task=
.  They too, dogged and=20

narrow-minded as they were, were yet pathetic, when one thought upon their =
lives.  No hope of=20

converts, or of advancement in the least degree, stuck down upon the coast,=
 far off from Dorcas=20

meetings, school-feasts, or anything which in more favoured countries while=
s away the Scripture-



reader=E2=80=99s time; they hammered at their self-appointed business day b=
y day and preached=20

unceasingly, apparently indifferent to anything that passed, so that they g=
ot off their due quantity=20

of words a day.  In course of time, and after tea and bread-and-butter had =
been consumed, they=20

got into their boat, struck up the tune of =E2=80=9CSidna Aissa Hobcum,=E2=
=80=9D and from the taffrail McKerrochar=20

saw them depart, joining in the chorus lustily and waving a dirty handkerch=
ief until they faded out=20

of sight.  Mr. McKerrochar, one of those Scottish professional religionists=
, whom early training or=20

their own =E2=80=9Cdamnable iteration=E2=80=9D has convinced of all the doc=
trine that they preach, formed a last=20

relic of a disappearing type.  The antiquated out-and-out doctrine of Hellf=
ire and of Paradise, the=20

jealous Scottish God, and the Mosaic Dispensation which he accepted whole, =
tinged slightly with=20

the current theology of Airdrie or Coatbridge, made him a formidable advers=
ary to the trembling=20

infidel, in religious strife.  In person he was tall and loosely built, his=
 trousers bagging at the knees=20

as if a horse=E2=80=99s hock had been inside the cloth.  Wrong-headed as be=
fits his calling, he yet saw=20

clearly enough in business matters, and might have marked a flock of heathe=
n sheep had he=20

applied his business aptitude to his religious work, or on the other hand h=
e might have made a=20

fortune had he chanced to be a rogue.  He led a joyless stirring life, stri=
ving towards ideals which=20

have made the world a quagmire; yet worked towards them with that simple fa=
ith which makes a=20

man ten thousand times more dangerous, in his muddle-headed course.  Abstra=
ctions which he=20

called duty, morality, and self-sacrifice, ruled all his life; forcing him =
ever onward to occupy himself=20

with things which really he had no concern with; and making him neglect him=
self and the more=20

human qualities of courtesy and love.  And so he stood, waving his pocket-h=
andkerchief long after=20

the strains of =E2=80=9CSidna Aissa Hobcum=E2=80=9D had melted into the nig=
ht air; his arms still waving as the sails=20

of windmills move round once or twice, but haltingly, after the wind has dr=
opped.  Perhaps that=20

class of man seldom or never chews the cud either of sweet or bitter recoll=
ection; and if, as in=20

McKerrochar=E2=80=99s case, he is deprived of whisky in which to drown his =
cares, the last impression=20

gone, his mind hammers away, like the keys of a loose typewriter under a we=
ary operator=E2=80=99s hands,=20

half aimlessly, till circumstances place new copy under its roller, and it =
starts off again to work.  He=20

might have gone on waving right through the dog-watch had not the captain w=
ith a rough=20

ejaculation stopped his arm.  =E2=80=9CHimmel, what for a semaphore, Herr m=
issionary, is dat; and you gry=20

missionary.=E2=80=9D  The two sat looking at nothing, thinking in the painf=
ul ruminant way of semi-educated=20

men, the captain=E2=80=99s burly North-German figure stretched on a cane de=
ck-chair.  About a captain=E2=80=99s=20

age he was, that is, his beard had just begun to grizzle, and his nose was =
growing red, the=20

bunions on his feet knotted his boots into protuberances, after the style o=
f those who pass their=20

lives about a deck.  In height above six feet, broad-shouldered and red-fac=
ed, his voice of the kind=20

with which a huntsman rates a dog, his clothes bought at a Bremerhaven slop=
-shop, his boots=20

apparently made by a portmanteau-maker, and in his pocket was a huge silver=
 keyless watch=20

which he said was a =E2=80=9Cgronometer,=E2=80=9D and keep de Bremen time. =
 Instant in prayer and cursing; pious=20

yet blasphemous; kindly but brutal in the Teutonic way; he kicked his crew =
about as they had all=20

been dogs, and yet looked after the tall stewardess Matilda as she had been=
 his child; guarding=20

her virtue from the assaults of passengers, and though alone with her in th=
e small compass of a=20

ship, respecting it himself.  After an interval he broke into his subject, =
just as a phonograph takes=20

up its interrupted tale, as if against its will.  =E2=80=9CSo ja, yes, Olde=
nburg, pretta place; I not see it often=20

though.  In all eight years I never stay more to my house than from de morn=
ing Saturday to=20

Monday noon, and dat after a four months=E2=80=99 trip.  =E2=80=9CMeine wif=
e, she getting little sdout, and not mind=20

much, for she is immer washing; washing de linen, de house, de steps; she w=
ash de whole ship=20

oop only I never let her come to see.  The Gretchen she immer say, =E2=80=
=98Father, why you not stop to=20

home?=E2=80=99  You got no littel Gretchen, eh?  . . . Well, perhaps better=
 so.  Last Christmas I was at=20

Oldenburg. Christmas eve I buy one tree, and then I remember I have to go t=
o sea next morning=20

about eleven o=E2=80=99clock.  So I say nodings all the day, and about four=
 o=E2=80=99clock the agent come and tell=20

me that the company not wish me leave Oldenburg upon de Christmas day.  The=
n I was so much=20

glad I think I wait to eat meine Christmas dinner with meine wife, and talk=
 with Gretchen in the=20

evening while I smoke my pipe.  The stove was burning, and the table stand =
ready mit sausage=20

and mit bread and cheese, beer of course, and lax, dat lax they bring from =
Norway, and I think I=20

have good time.  Then I think on de company, what they say if I take favour=
 from them and go not=20

out to sea; they throw it in my teeth for ever, and tell me, =E2=80=98Rinde=
lhaus, you remember we was so=20

good to you upon that Christmas day.=E2=80=99  I tell the agent thank you, =
but say I go to sea.  Meine wife:=20

she gry and I say nodings, nodings to Gretchen, and sit down to take my tea=
. Morning, I tell my=20

littel girl, then she gry bitterly and say, =E2=80=98What for you go to sea=
?=E2=80=99  I kiss meine wife and walk down=20

to the quay; it just begin to snow; I curse the schelm sailors, de pilot co=
me aboard, and we begin=20

to warp into the stream.  Just then I hear a running on the quay, like as a=
 Friesland pony come=20

clattering on the stones.  I look up and see Gretchen mit her little wooden=
 shoes.  She run down to=20

the ship, and say, =E2=80=98Why you go sea, father, upon Christmas day?=E2=
=80=99 and I not able to say nodings but=20

just to wave my hand.  We warp out into the stream, and she stand grying ti=
ll she faded out of=20

sight.  Sometimes I feel a liddel sorry about dat Christmas day . . .  But =
have another glass beer,=20

Herr missionary, it always do me good.=E2=80=9D  Wiping the froth from his =
moustache with his rough hand=20

he went below, leaving the missionary alone upon the deck.  The night desce=
nded, and the ship=20

shrouded in mist grew ghostly and unnatural, whilst great drops of moisture=
 hung on the backstays=20

and the shrouds.  The Arab crew lay sleeping, huddled round the windlass, l=
ooking mere masses=20

of white dirty rags; the seaman keeping the anchor-watch loomed like a gian=
t, and from the shore=20

occasionally the voices of the guards at the town prison came through the m=
ist, making the=20

boarhound turn in his sleep and growl.  The missionary paced to and fro a l=
ittle, settling his pith=20



tureen-shaped hat upon his head, and fastening a woollen comforter about hi=
s neck.  Then going=20

to the rail, he looked into the night where the boat bearing off his brethr=
en had disappeared; his=20

soul perhaps wandering towards some Limbo as he gazed, and his elastic-side=
d boots fast glued=20

to the dirty decks by the half-dried-up blood of the discarded fish.     TH=
E GOLD FISH   OUTSIDE=20

the little straw-thatched _caf=C3=A9_ in a small courtyard trellised with v=
ines, before a miniature table=20

painted in red and blue, and upon which stood a dome-shaped pewter teapot a=
nd a painted glass=20

half filled with mint, sat Amarabat, resting and smoking hemp.  He was of t=
hose whom Allah in his=20

mercy (or because man in the Blad-Allah has made no railways) has ordained =
to run.  Set upon=20

the road, his shoes pulled up, his=20


_
Plainfield, where he resides. Mr. Young, will you be kind enough to tell th=
is gentleman who I am?"=20

"Parson Barnes, of Hayfield Centre," said the youth, confidently.  "You hav=
e heard me preach,=20

have you not, in Plainfield?"  "Yes," said the young man, fully believing t=
hat he was telling the=20

truth.  "And I have called on your parents?"  "Yes."  "I think," said the a=
dventurer, "that will be=20

sufficient to convince you that I am what I appear."  It was hard to doubt,=
 in the face of such=20

evidence. Ephraim Young was so unmistakably from the rural districts that i=
t would have been=20

absurd to suspect him of being an artful city rogue. Besides, Mr. Barnes hi=
mself was got up so=20

naturally that all the clerk's doubts vanished at once. He concluded that t=
he customer who had=20

questioned his genuineness must be very much mistaken.  "I ought to apologi=
ze to you, sir," he=20

said, "for doubting your word. But in a city like this you know one has to =
be very careful."  "Of=20

course," said the adventurer, blandly, "I do not blame you in the least. Yo=
u only did your duty,=20

though it might have cost me some trouble and inconvenience."  "I am sorry,=
 sir."  "No apologies, I=20

beg. It has all turned out right, and your mistake was a natural one. If yo=
u will kindly return me the=20

ring, I will defer selling it, I think, till another day."  The clerk broug=
ht the ring, which he handed=20

back to Mr. Montgomery. The latter received it with so much the more satisf=
action, as he had=20

made up his mind at one time that it was gone irrevocably, and put it away =
in his waistcoat pocket.=20

"I had intended to buy some silver spoons," he said, "but it will be necess=
ary to wait until I have=20

disposed of the ring. However, I may as well look at some, eh, Mrs. Barnes?=
"  "If you like,"=20

assented the lady.  So the pair examined some spoons, and fixed upon a doze=
n, which they said=20

they would return and buy on the next day, and then, with a polite good-by,=
 went out of the store,=20

leaving behind, on the whole, a favorable impression.  Ephraim Young accomp=
anied them out,=20

and walked along beside them in the street. He, too, was in good spirits, f=
or had not his=20

companion promised him five dollars for his services, which he had faithful=
ly rendered? Five=20

dollars to the young man from the rural districts was a very considerable s=
um of money--quite a=20

nugget, in fact--and he already enjoyed in advance the pleasure which he an=
ticipated of telling his=20

friends at home how easily he had earned such a sum in "York." He walked al=
ong beside the=20

adventurer, expecting that he would say something about paying him, but no =
allusion was made=20

by the adventurer to his promise. Indeed, five dollars was considerably mor=
e than he had in his=20

possession. When they reached Amity street, for they were now proceeding up=
 Broadway, he=20

sought to shake off the young man, whose company he no longer desired.  "Th=
is is our way," he=20

said. "I suppose you are going further. I am very glad to have met you, Mr.=
 Young. I hope you will=20

give our regards to your excellent parents;" and he held out his hand in to=
ken of farewell.  "Ain't=20

you goin' to pay me that money?" said Ephraim, bluntly, becoming alarmed at=
 the prospect of=20

losing the nugget he had counted on with so much confidence.  "Bless me, I =
came near forgetting=20

it! I hope you will excuse me," and to Ephraim's delight he drew out his po=
cketbook. But the=20

prospect of payment was not so bright as the young man supposed.  "I don't =
think I have a five-

dollar bill," said Mr. Montgomery, after an examination of the pocketbook. =
"Mrs. Montgomery, do=20

you happen to have a five with you?"  "No, I haven't," said the lady, promp=
tly. "I spent all my=20

money shopping this morning."  "That is unfortunate. Our young friend has r=
endered us such a=20

service I don't like to make him wait for his money."  Ephraim Young looked=
 rather blank at this=20

suggestion.  "Let me see, I have a hundred-dollar bill here," said Mr. Mont=
gomery. "I will go into=20

the next store, and see if I can't get it changed. Mr. Young, will you be k=
ind enough to remain with=20



my wife?"  "Certain," said Ephraim, brightening up.  Mr. Montgomery went in=
to a shop near by, but=20

made no request to have a hundred-dollar bill changed. He was rather afraid=
 that they might=20

comply with his request, which would have subjected him to some embarrassme=
nt. He merely=20

inquired if he could use a pen for a moment; request which was readily gran=
ted. In less than five=20

minutes he emerged into the street again. Ephraim Young looked toward him e=
agerly.  "I am sorry=20

to say, my young friend," he remarked, "that I was unable to get my bill ch=
anged. I might get it=20

changed at a bank, but the banks are all closed at this hour."  The country=
man looked disturbed.=20

"I am afraid," continued Mr. Montgomery, "I must wait and send you the mone=
y in a letter from=20

Hayfield Centre."  "I'd rather have it now," said Ephraim.  "I am sorry to =
disappoint you," said the=20

adventurer smoothly; "but after all you will only have a day or two to wait=
. To make up to you for=20

the delay I have decided to send you ten dollars instead of five. Finding I=
 could not change my bill,=20

I wrote a note for the amount, which I will hand you."  Ephraim received th=
e paper, which the other=20

handed him, and read as follows:  NEW YORK, Sept 15, 18--.  Three days from=
 date I promise to=20

pay Mr. Ephraim Young ten dollars.  JOTHAM BARNES, of Hayfield Centre.  "Ho=
w will that do?"=20

asked the adventurer. "By waiting three days you double your money."  "You'=
ll be sure to send it,"=20

said Ephraim, doubtfully.  "My young friend, I hope you do not doubt me," s=
aid the Rev. Mr.=20

Barnes, impressively.  "I guess it's all right," said Ephraim, "only I thou=
ght I might like to spend the=20

money in the city."  "Much better save it up," said the other. "By and by i=
t may come in useful."=20

Ephraim carefully folded up the note, and deposited it in an immense wallet=
, the gift of his father.=20

He would have preferred the money which it represented: but three days woul=
d soon pass, and=20

the ten dollars would be forwarded to him. He took leave of his new acquain=
tances, Mr.=20

Montgomery shaking his hand with affectionate warmth, and requesting him to=
 give his best=20

respects to his parents. When Ephraim was out of sight he returned to his w=
ife, with a humorous=20

twinkle in his eye, and said:  "Wasn't that cleverly done, old lady?"  "Goo=
d enough!" remarked the=20

lady. "Now you've got the ring back again, what are you going to do with it=
?"  "That, my dear, is a=20

subject which requires the maturest consideration. I shall endeavor to conv=
ert it as soon as=20

possible into the largest possible sum in greenbacks. Otherwise I am afraid=
 our board bill, and the=20

note I have just given to my rural friend, will remain unpaid."    CHAPTER =
XXIV  MR.=20

MONTGOMERY'S ARREST  Having shaken off his country acquaintance, of whom he=
 had no=20

further need, Mr. Montgomery started to return to his lodgings. On the whol=
e, he was in good=20

spirits, though he had not effected the sale of the ring. But it was still =
in his possession, and it had=20

a tangible value.  "I am sorry you did not sell the ring," said Mrs. Montgo=
mery.  "So am I," said her=20

husband. "We may have to sell it in some other city."  "We can't leave the =
city without money."=20

"That's true," returned her husband, rather taken aback by what was undenia=
bly true.  "We must=20

sell the ring, or raise money on it, in New York."  "I don't know but you a=
re right. The trouble is,=20

there are not many places where they will buy so expensive an article. Besi=
des, they will be apt to=20

ask impertinent questions."  "You might go to a pawnbroker's."  "And get fl=
eeced. If I got a quarter=20

of the value from a pawnbroker, I should be lucky."  "We must do something =
with it," said Mrs.=20

Montgomery, decidedly.  "Right, my dear. We must get the sinews of war some=
where. Richard will=20

never be himself again till his pocketbook is lined with greenbacks. At pre=
sent, who steals my=20

purse steals trash."  "Suppose you try Tiffany's?"  "The ring has already b=
een offered there. They=20

might remember it."  "If they do, say that he is your son."  "A good though=
t," answered the=20



husband. "I will act upon it. But, on the whole, I'll doff this disguise, a=
nd assume my ordinary=20

garments. This time, my dear, I shall not need your assistance."  "Well, th=
e sooner it's done the=20

better. That's all I have to say."  "As soon as possible."  Mr. Montgomery =
returned to his lodgings=20

in Amity street, and, taking off his clerical garb, appeared in the garb in=
 which we first made his=20

acquaintance. The change was very speedily effected.  "Wish me good luck, M=
rs. M.," he said, as=20

he opened the door. "I am going to make another attempt."  "Good luck to yo=
u, Tony! Come back=20

soon."  "As soon as my business is completed. If I get the money, we will l=
eave for Philadelphia=20

this evening. You may as well be packing up."  "I am afraid the landlady wo=
n't let us carry away=20

our baggage unless we pay our bill."  "Never mind! Pack it up, and we'll ru=
n our chance."  Felix=20

Montgomery left the house with the ring carefully deposited in his vest poc=
ket. To judge from his=20

air of easy indifference, he might readily have been taken for a substantia=
l citizen in excellent=20

circumstances; but then appearances are oftentimes deceitful, and they were=
 especially so in the=20

present instance.  He made his way quickly to Broadway, and thence to Tiffa=
ny's, at that time not=20

so far uptown as at present. He entered the store with a nonchalant air, an=
d, advancing to the=20

counter, accosted the same clerk to whom Paul had shown the ring earlier in=
 the day.  "I have a=20

valuable ring which I would like to sell," he said. "Will you tell me its v=
alue?"  The clerk no sooner=20

took it in his hand than he recognized it.  "I have seen that ring before,"=
 he said, looking at Mr.=20

Montgomery keenly.  "Yes," said the latter, composedly; "this morning, wasn=
't it?"  "Yes."  "My boy=20

brought it in here. I ought not to have sent him, for he came very near los=
ing it on the way home. I=20

thought it best to come with it myself."  This was said so quietly that it =
was hard to doubt the=20

statement, or would have back, and in it bread, some hemp, a match or two (=
known to him as el=20

spiritus), and a letter to take anywhere, crossing the plains, fording the =
streams, struggling along=20

the mountain-paths, sleeping but fitfully, a burning rope steeped in saltpe=
tre fastened to his foot,=20

he trotted day and night=E2=80=94untiring as a camel, faithful as a dog.  I=
n Rabat as he sat dozing,=20

watching the greenish smoke curl upwards from his hemp pipe, word came to h=
im from the Khalifa=20

of the town.  So Amarabat rose, paid for his tea with half a handful of def=
aced and greasy copper=20

coins, and took his way towards the white palace with the crenelated walls,=
 which on the cliff,=20

hanging above the roaring tide-rip, just inside the bar of the great river,=
 looks at Salee.  Around the=20

horseshoe archway of the gate stood soldiers, wild, fierce-eyed, armed to t=
he teeth, descendants,=20

most of them, of the famed warriors whom Sultan Muley Ismail (may God have =
pardoned him!)=20

bred for his service, after the fashion of the Carlylean hero Frederic; and=
 Amarabat walked through=20

them, not aggressively, but with the staring eyes of a confirmed hemp-smoke=
r, with the long stride=20

of one who knows that he is born to run, and the assurance of a man who wai=
ts upon his lord.=20

Some time he waited whilst the Khalifa dispensed what he thought justice, c=
haffered with Jewish=20

pedlars for cheap European goods, gossiped with friends, looked at the anti=
cs of a dwarf, or priced=20

a Georgian or Circassian girl brought with more care than glass by some ric=
h merchant from the=20

East.  At last Amarabat stood in the presence, and the Khalifa, sitting upo=
n a pile of cushions=20

playing with a Waterbury watch, a pistol and a Koran by his side, addressed=
 him thus:=E2=80=94=20

=E2=80=9CAmarabat, son of Bjorma, my purpose is to send thee to Tafilet, wh=
ere our liege lord the Sultan=20

lies with his camp.  Look upon this glass bowl made by the Kaffir, but clea=
r as is the crystal of the=20

rock; see how the light falls on the water, and the shifting colours that i=
t makes, as when the Bride=20

of the Rain stands in the heavens, after a shower in spring. Inside are sev=
en gold fish, each scale=20



as bright as letters in an Indian book.  The Christian from whom I bought t=
hem said originally they=20

came from the Far East where the Djin-descended Jawi live, the little yello=
w people of the faith.=20

That may be, but such as they are, they are a gift for kings.  Therefore, t=
ake thou the bowl.  Take it=20

with care, and bear it as it were thy life.  Stay not, but in an hour start=
 from the town. Delay not on=20

the road, be careful of the fish, change not their water at the muddy pool =
where tortoises bask in=20

the sunshine, but at running brooks; talk not to friends, look not upon the=
 face of woman by the=20

way, although she were as a gazelle, or as the maiden who when she walked t=
hrough the fields=20

the sheep stopped feeding to admire.  Stop not, but run through day and nig=
ht, pass through the=20

Atlas at the Glaui; beware of frost, cover the bowl with thine own haik; up=
on the other side shield=20

me the bowl from the Saharan sun, and drink not of the water if thou pass a=
 day athirst when=20

toiling through the sand.  Break not the bowl, and see the fish arrive in T=
afilet, and then present=20

them, with this letter, to our lord.  Allah be with you, and his Prophet; g=
o, and above all things see=20

thou breakest not the bowl.=E2=80=9D  And Amarabat, after the manner of his=
 kind, taking the bowl of gold=20

fish, placed one hand upon his heart and said: =E2=80=9CInshallah, it shall=
 be as thou hast said.  God gives=20

the feet and lungs.  He also gives the luck upon the road.=E2=80=9D  So he =
passed out under the horseshoe=20

arch, holding the bowl almost at arm=E2=80=99s length so as not to touch hi=
s legs, and with the palmetto=20

string by which he carried it, bound round with rags.  The soldiers looked =
at him, but spoke not,=20

and their eyes seemed to see far away, and to pass over all in the middle d=
istance, though no=20

doubt they marked the smallest detail of his gait and dress.  He passed bet=
ween the horses of the=20

guard all standing nodding under the fierce sun, the reins tied to the cant=
les of their high red=20

saddles, a boy in charge of every two or three: he passed beside the camels=
 resting by the well,=20

the donkeys standing dejected by the firewood they had brought: passed wome=
n, veiled white=20

figures going to the baths; and passing underneath the lofty gateway of the=
 town, exchanged a=20

greeting with the half-mad, half-religious beggar just outside the walls, a=
nd then emerged upon the=20

sandy road, between the aloe hedges, which skirts along the sea.  So as he =
walked, little by little=20

he fell into his stride; then got his second wind, and smoking now and then=
 a pipe of hemp, began,=20

as Arabs say, to cat the miles, his eyes fixed on the horizon, his stick st=
uck down between his shirt=20

and back, the knob protruding over the left shoulder like the hilt of a two=
-handed sword.  And still=20

he held the precious bowl from Franquestan in which the golden fish swam to=
 and fro, diving and=20

circling in the sunlight, or flapped their tails to steady themselves as th=
e water danced with the=20

motion of his steps.  Never before in his experience had he been charged wi=
th such a mission,=20

never before been sent to stand before Allah=E2=80=99s vicegerent upon eart=
h.  But still the strangeness of=20

his business was what preoccupied him most.  The fish like molten gold, the=
 water to be changed=20

only at running streams, the fish to be preserved from frost and sun; and t=
hen the bowl: had not=20

the Khalifa said at the last, =E2=80=9CBeware, break not the bowl=E2=80=9D?=
  So it appeared to him that most=20

undoubtedly a charm was in the fish and in the bowl, for who sends common f=
ish on such a=20

journey through the land?  Then he resolved at any hazard to bring them saf=
e and keep the bowl=20

intact, and trotting onward, smoked his hemp, and wondered why he of all me=
n should have had=20

the luck to bear the precious gift.  He knew he kept his law, at least as f=
ar as a poor man can keep=20

it, prayed when he thought of prayer, or was assailed by terror in the nigh=
t alone upon the plains;=20

fasted in Ramadan, although most of his life was one continual fast; drank =
of the shameful but=20

seldom, and on the sly, so as to give offence to no believer, and seldom lo=
oked upon the face of=20



the strange women, Daughters of the Illegitimate, whom Sidna Mohammed himse=
lf has said,=20

avoid.  But all these things he knew were done by many of the faithful, and=
 so he did not set=20

himself up as of exceeding virtue, but rather left the praise to God, who h=
elped his slave with=20

strength to keep his law.  Then left off thinking, judging the matter was o=
rdained, and trotted,=20

trotted over the burning plains, the gold fish dancing in the water as the =
miles melted and passed=20

away.  Duar and Kasbah, castles of the Caids, Arabs=E2=80=99 black tents, s=
uddra zaribas, camels=20

grazing=E2=80=94antediluvian in appearance=E2=80=94on the little hills, the=
 muddy streams edged all along the=20

banks with oleanders, the solitary horsemen holding their long and brass-ho=
oped guns like spears,=20

the white-robed noiseless-footed travellers on the roads, the chattering st=
orks upon the village=20

mosques, the cow-birds sitting on the cattle in the fields=E2=80=94he saw, =
but marked not, as he trotted=20

on.  Day faded into night, no twilight intervening, and the stars shone out=
, Soheil and Rigel with=20

Betelgeuse and Aldebaran, and the three bright lamps which the cursed Chris=
tians know as the=20

Three Maries=E2=80=94called, he supposed, after the mother of their Prophet=
; and still he trotted on.  Then=20

by the side of a lone palm-tree springing up from a cleft in a tall rock, a=
n island on the plain, he=20

stopped to pray; and sleeping, slept but fitfully, the strangeness of the b=
usiness making him=20

wonder; and he who cavils over matters in the night can never rest, for thu=
s the jackal and the=20

hyena pass their nights talking and reasoning about the thoughts which fill=
 their minds when men=20

lie with their faces covered in their haiks, and after prayer sleep.  Risin=
g after an hour or two and=20

going to the nearest stream, he changed the water of his fish, leaving a li=
ttle in the bottom of the=20

bowl, and dipping with his brass drinking-cup into the stream for fear of a=
ccidents.  He passed the=20

Kasbah of el Daudi, passed the land of the Rahamna, accursed folk always in=
 =E2=80=9Csiba,=E2=80=9D saw the=20

great snowy wall of Atlas rise, skirted Marakesh, the Kutubieh, rising firs=
t from the plain and=20

sinking last from sight as he approached the mountains and left the great w=
hite city sleeping in the=20

plain.  Little by little the country altered as he ran: cool streams for mu=
ddy rivers, groves of=20

almond-trees, ashes and elms, with grape-vines binding them together as the=
 liana binds the=20

canela and the urunday in the dark forests of Brazil and Paraguay.  At mid-=
day, when the sun was=20

at its height, when locusts, whirring through the air, sank in the dust as =
flying-fish sink in the=20

waves, when palm-trees seem to nod their heads, and lizards are abroad drin=
king the heat and=20

basking in the rays, when the dry air shimmers, and sparks appear to dance =
before the traveller=E2=80=99s=20

eye, and a thin, reddish dust lies on the leaves, on clothes of men, and up=
on every hair of horses=E2=80=99=20

coats, he reached a spring.  A river springing from a rock, or issuing afte=
r running underground,=20

had formed a little pond.  Around the edge grew bulrushes, great catmace, w=
ater-soldiers, tall=20

arums and metallic-looking sedge-grass, which gave an air as of an outpost =
of the tropics lost in=20

the desert sand.  Fish played beneath the rock where the stream issued, fli=
tting to and fro, or=20

hanging suspended for an instant in the clear stream, darted into the dark =
recesses of the sides;=20

and in the middle of the pond enormous tortoises, horrid and antediluvian-l=
ooking, basked with=20

their backs awash or raised their heads to snap at flies, and all about the=
m hung a dark and fetid=20

slime.  A troop of thin brown Arab girls filled their tall amphora whilst w=
ashing in the pond.  Placing=20

his bowl of fish upon a jutting rock, the messenger drew near.  =E2=80=9CGa=
zelles,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cwill one of you=20

give me fresh water for the Sultan=E2=80=99s golden fish?=E2=80=9D  Laughin=
g and=20


_
the ring had been stolen.  "Yes, boys are careless," assented the clerk, no=
t caring to arouse Mr.=20

Montgomery's suspicions. "You wish to sell the ring, I suppose."  "Yes," an=
swered the other; "I=20

don't like to carry a ring of so great value. Several times I have come nea=
r having it stolen. Will=20

you buy it?"  "I am not authorized to make the purchase," said the clerk. "=
I will refer the matter to=20

Mr. Tiffany."  "Very well," said Mr. Montgomery. "I am willing to accept wh=
atever he may=20

pronounce a fair price."  "No doubt," thought the clerk.  He carried the ri=
ng to his employer, and=20

quickly explained the circumstances.  "The man is doubtless a thief. He mus=
t be arrested," said=20

the jeweler.  "If I go for an officer, he will take alarm."  "Invite him to=
 come into the back part of the=20

shop, and I will protract the negotiation while you summon a policeman."  T=
he clerk returned, and=20

at his invitation Mr. Montgomery walked to the lower end of the store, wher=
e he was introduced to=20

the head of the looked at the bowl, had never seen such fish.  =E2=80=9CAll=
ah is great; why do you not let=20

them go in the pond and play a little with their brothers?=E2=80=9D And Ama=
rabat with a shiver answered,=20

=E2=80=9CPlay, let them play! and if they come not back my life will answer=
 for it.=E2=80=9D  Fear fell upon the girls,=20

and one advancing, holding the skirt of her long shift between her teeth to=
 veil her face, poured=20

water from her amphora upon the fish.  Then Amarabat, setting down his prec=
ious bowl, drew from=20

his wallet a pomegranate and began to eat, and for a farthing buying a piec=
e of bread from the=20

women, was satisfied, and after smoking, slept, and dreamed he was approach=
ing Tafilet; he saw=20

the palm-trees rising from the sand; the gardens; all the oasis stretching =
beyond his sight; at the=20

edge the Sultan=E2=80=99s camp, a town of canvas, with the horses, camels, =
and the mules picketed, all in=20

rows, and in the midst of the great =E2=80=9Cduar=E2=80=9D the Sultan=E2=80=
=99s tent, like a great palace all of canvas,=20

shining in the sun.  All this he=20


_
establishment. Sharp though he was, he suspected no plot.  "You are the own=
er of this ring?"=20

asked Mr. Tiffany.  "Yes, sir," said the adventurer. "It has been in our fa=
mily for a long time."  "But=20

you wish to sell it now?"  "Yes; I have come near losing it several times, =
and prefer to dispose of it.=20

What is its value?"  "That requires some consideration. I will examine it c=
losely."  Mr. admitted to=20

the sacred tent, or at least paid by a vizier, as one who has performed his=
 duty well.  The slow=20

match blistering his foot, he woke to find himself alone, the =E2=80=9Cgaze=
lles=E2=80=9D departed, and the sun=20

shining on the bowl, making the fish appear more magical, more wondrous, br=
ighter, and more=20

golden than before.  And so he took his way along the winding Atlas paths, =
and slept at Demnats,=20


_
while the jeweler appeared to be engaged in a close examination of the ring=
. He congratulated=20

himself that no questions had been asked which it might have been difficult=
 for him to answer. He=20

made up his mind that after due examination Mr. Tiffany would make an offer=
, which he=20

determined in advance to accept, whatever it might be, since he going to th=
e south.  Passing=20

through groves of chestnuts, walnut-trees, and hedges thick with blackberri=
es and travellers=E2=80=99 joy,=20

he climbed through vineyards rich with black Atlas grapes, and passed the f=
lat mud-built Berber=20

villages nestling against the rocks.  Eagles flew by and moufflons gazed at=
 him from the peaks,=20

and from the thickets of=20


_
consider himself fortunate to dispose of it at even two-thirds of its value=
.  Meanwhile the clerk=20

quietly slipped out of the store, and at a short distance encountered a pol=
iceman, upon whom he=20

called for assistance. At the same moment Paul and Mr. Preston came up. Our=
 hero, on being=20

released from arrest, had sought Mr. Preston, and the latter obligingly agr=
eed to go with him to=20

Tiffany's, and certify to his honesty, that, if the ring and dwarf arbutus =
wild boars appeared,=20

grunted, and slowly walked across the path, and still he climbed, the icy w=
ind from off the snow=20

chilling him in his cotton shirt, for his warm Tadla haik was long ago wrap=
ped round the bowl to=20

shield the precious fish.  Crossing the Wad Ghadat, the current to his chin=
, his bowl of fish held in=20

one hand, he struggled on. The Berber tribesmen at Tetsula and Zarkten, har=
d-featured, shaved=20

but for a=20


_
not recognize the clerk, but the latter at once remembered him.  "Are you n=
ot the boy that brought=20

a diamond ring into our store this morning?" he asked.  "Into Tiffany's?"  =
"Yes."  "Have you seen=20

anything of it?" asked our hero, eagerly. "I am the one who brought it in."=
  "A man just brought it=20

into the store," said the clerk.  "Is he there now?"  "He is talking with M=
r. Tiffany. I came out for a=20

policeman. He will be arrested at once."  "Good!" ejaculated Paul; "I am in=
 luck. I thought I should=20

never see the ring again. What sort of a man is he?"  From the description,=
 Paul judged that it was=20

Felix Montgomery himself, and, remembering what a trick the adventurer had =
played in the skirt,=20

saw he was a =E2=80=9Crekass,=E2=80=9D or thought the fish not worth their =
notice, so gave him a free road.  Night=20

caught him at the stone-built, antediluvian-looking Kasbah of the Glaui, pe=
rched in the eye of the=20

pass, with the small plain of Teluet two thousand feet below.  Off the high=
 snow-peaks came a=20

whistling wind, water froze solid in all the pots and pans, earthenware jar=
s and bottles throughout=20

the castle, save in the bowl which Amarabat, shivering and miserable, wrapp=
ed in his haik and=20

held close to the embers, hearing the muezzin at each call to prayers; pray=
ing himself to keep=20

awake so that his fish might live.  Dawn saw him on the trail, the bowl wra=
pped in a woollen=20


_
Lovejoy's Hotel, he felt no little satisfaction in the thought that the tra=
pper was himself trapped at=20

last.  "I'll go along with you," he said. "I want to see that man arrested.=
"  "You had better stay=20

outside just at first, until we have secured him."  Meanwhile Mr. Tiffany, =
after a prolonged=20

examination, said: "The ring is worth two hundred and fifty dollars."  "Tha=
t will be satisfactory," said=20

Mr. Montgomery, promptly.  "Shall I give you a check for the amount?" asked=
 the jeweler.  "I=20

should prefer the money, as I am a stranger in the city, and not known at t=
he banks."  "I can make=20

the check payable to bearer, and then you will have no difficulty in gettin=
g it cashed."  While this=20

conversation was going on, the clerk entered the store with the policeman, =
but Mr. Montgomery's=20

back was turned, and he was not aware of the fact till bread-crumbs, but hi=
mself hungry and his=20

head swimming with want of sleep, with smoking =E2=80=9Ckief,=E2=80=9D and =
with the bitter wind which from El Tisi=20

N=E2=80=99Glaui flagellates the road.  Right through the valley of Teluet h=
e still kept on, and day and night=20

still trotting, trotting on, changing his bowl almost instinctively from ha=
nd to hand, a broad leaf=20

floating on the top to keep the water still, he left Agurzga, with its twin=
 castles, Ghresat and Dads,=20

behind.  Then rapidly descending, in a day reached an oasis between Todghra=
 and Ferkla, and=20

rested at a village for the night. Sheltered by palm-trees and hedged round=
 with cactuses and=20

aloes, either to keep out thieves or as a symbol of the thorniness of life,=
 the village lay, looking=20

back on the white Atlas gaunt and mysterious, and on the other side towards=
 the brown Sahara,=20

land of the=20
