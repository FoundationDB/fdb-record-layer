_
the largest whale I ever saw." Turning to the third officer, he added, "And=
 I killed it in the good old-

fashioned hand-lance style, and didn't touch the new-fangled bomb-gun that =
the owners put in all=20

our boats."  As the boats separated, I turned and watched the dying whale. =
It was slowly=20

swimming around in a large circle, and the blood was just oozing from its s=
pout-holes as it came to=20

the surface to breathe.  The sun was about a handspike high from the horizo=
n. There was=20

considerable water left in the boat, which, empty of men, now floated high;=
 so I took a bucket and=20

busied myself in bailing it out. After bailing awhile, I leaned back agains=
t the thwarts and took=20

another look at the whale. The creature was not dead yet, and there did not=
 seem to be any blood=20

coming from its spout-holes. In fact, it seemed to be spouting all right, a=
nd was not circling around=20

any more, but was swimming slowly ahead. What did it mean? Could Captain Co=
ffin have=20

fastened me to the wrong whale? I asked myself. I began to feel frightened,=
 for all of a sudden the=20

monster began to beat the water again with its flukes, and the boat was goi=
ng at a faster rate of=20

speed.  The sun had now reached the water's edge, and I could not see any b=
oat coming. What=20

should I do if the whale turned on me? I looked round for a knife to cut th=
e whale-line, but could=20

not find one. The crew had taken all the knives with them. The whale had di=
sappeared, and the=20

line was fast running out of its tub. Faster and faster it ran, until, with=
 a jerk, the end flew from the=20

tub, and I thought I was free.  But alas, no! for when the crew were being =
changed one of  He=20

smiled more and more confidentially. His gaze was charged with a secret mea=
ning. He seemed to=20

be suggesting unspeakable matters to Priam. That bright face wore an expres=
sion which such=20

faces wear on such occasions--an expression cheerfully insinuating that aft=
er all there is no right=20

and no wrong--or at least that many things which the ordinary slave of conv=
ention would consider=20

to be wrong are really right. So Priam read the expression.  "The dirty ras=
cal wants me to=20

manufacture imitations of myself for him!" Priam thought, full of sudden, h=
idden anger. "He's=20

known all along that there's no difference between what I sold him and the =
picture he's already=20

had. He wants to suggest that we should come to terms. He's simply been pla=
ying a game with me=20

up to now." And he said aloud, "I don't know that I _advise_ you to do anyt=
hing. I'm not a dealer,=20

Mr. Oxford."  He said it in a hostile tone that ought to have silenced Mr. =
Oxford for ever, but it did=20

not. Mr. Oxford curved away, like a skater into a new figure, and began to =
expatiate minutely upon=20

the merits of the Volterra picture. He analyzed it in so much detail, and l=
auded it with as much=20

justice, as though the picture was there before them. Priam was astonished =
at the man's=20

exactitude. "Scoundrel! He knows a thing or two!" reflected Priam grimly.  =
"You don't think I=20

overpraise it, do you, _cher maitre?_ Mr. Oxford finished, still smiling.  =
"A little," said Priam.  If only=20

Priam could have run away! But he couldn't! Mr. Oxford had him well in a co=
rner. No chance of=20

freedom! Besides, he was over fifty and stout.  "Ah! Now I was expecting yo=
u to say that! Do you=20


_
fastened the small tub, which is used for a drag, in the end of the line, a=
nd it was yanked under the=20

bow thwart and jammed there.  The boat now shot ahead with furious speed. I=
t was growing=20

darker, and I could scarcely make out the ship. In vain I looked for the bo=
at. Would it never come!=20

To add to my trouble, the rest of the whales had joined the old bull, and w=
ere hoarsely spouting=20

and leaping out of the water all around me. In fact, there were whales ever=
ywhere, on both sides=20

of the boat, and down beneath it. I could dimly see their greenish-white re=
flections as they swam=20

just beneath the surface.  One old cow whale and her calf were close beside=
 me, and as they=20

came up to spout I could feel the water from the splash of the little one's=
 flukes. As a boy on=20

shipboard I had often longed for a little whale to play with, but the desir=
e had all left me now, for I=20

crouched down in the boat and covered my face with my hands.  Oh, if the ca=
ptain would only=20

come and take me out of that boat! I would never go to sea again, I thought=
.  Suddenly the boat=20

stopped with a jerk, and uncovering my face, I saw a sight that made me scr=
eam with fright. Right=20

in front of me was a large sperm-whale's head, with its jaws wide open, and=
 its long row of white,=20

glistening teeth shining from the phosphorescent brightness of the water. W=
ith a snap its mouth=20

closed, and it sank period you painted it?" Mr. Oxford inquired, very bland=
ly, though his hands=20

were clasped in a violent tension that forced the blood from the region of =
the knuckle-joints.  This=20

was the crisis which Mr. Oxford had been leading up to! All the time Mr. Ox=
ford's teethy smile had=20

concealed a knowledge of Priam's identity!         *       *       *       =
*       *     CHAPTER X   _The=20

Secret_   "What do you mean?" asked Priam Farll. But he put the question we=
akly, and he might=20

just as well have said, "I know what you mean, and I would pay a million po=
unds or so in order to=20

sink through the floor." A few minutes ago he would only have paid five hun=
dred pounds or so in=20

order to run simply away. Now he wanted Maskelyne miracles to happen to him=
. The universe=20

seemed to be caving in about the ears of Priam Farll.  Mr. Oxford was still=
 smiling; smiling,=20

however, as a man holds his breath for a wager. You felt that he could not =
keep it up much longer.=20

"You _are_ Priam Farll, aren't you?" said Mr. Oxford in a very low voice.  =
"What makes you think=20

I'm Priam Farll?"  "I think you are Priam Farll because you painted that pi=
cture I bought from you=20

this morning, and I am sure that no one but Priam Farll could have painted =
it."  "Then you've been=20

playing a game with me all morning!"  "Please don't put it like that, _cher=
 maitre_," Mr. Oxford=20

whisperingly pleaded. "I only=20


_
out of sight, while I, falling on my knees, asked God to save me.  After th=
at I felt better, and=20

managed to crawl under the stem-sheets for shelter, for I was chilled throu=
gh. It was quite dark,=20

although the stars shone brightly. The whale seemed to have got free, for t=
he boat was idly=20

rocking on the water.  In changing my cramped form to an upright position, =
my hand came against=20

a hard, round piece of iron. A feeling of security, of advantage, of longin=
g for battle ran through me=20

as my hand rested on the cold steel. It was one of the captain's bomb-guns,=
 which was so=20

despised by him, but which might be the means of saving me from an awful de=
ath. I pulled it from=20

its socket, and fondled it in my excitement and relief at supposed to have =
been buried in=20

Westminster Abbey. But for me the existence of that picture of Putney High =
Street, obviously just=20

painted, is an absolute proof that he is not buried in Westminster Abbey, a=
nd that he still lives. It is=20

an amazing thing that there should have been a mistake at the funeral, an u=
tterly amazing thing,=20

which involves all sorts of consequences! But that's not my business. Of co=
urse there must be=20

clear reasons for what occurred. I am not interested in them--I mean not pr=
ofessionally. I merely=20

argue, when I see a certain picture, with the paint still wet on it: 'That =
picture was painted by a=20

certain painter. I am an expert, and I stake my reputation on it' It's no u=
se telling me that the=20

painter in=20
