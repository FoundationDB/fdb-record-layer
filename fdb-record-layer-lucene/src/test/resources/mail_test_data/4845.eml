General Terms of Use chansons some outbreak of instinctive feeling may be occasionally present; 

but, as the amorous metaphysics developed, what came to be admired was the skill shown in 

manipulating a conventional sentiment; the lady became an abstraction of exalted beauty, the 

lover an interpreter of the theory of love; the most personal of passions lost the character of 

individuality. Occasionally, as in the poems of the Chatelain de Couci, of Conon de Bethune, of 

Thibaut de Champagne, and of Adam de la Halle, something personal to the writer may be 

discerned; but in general the poetry is that of a doctrine and of a school.  In some instances the 

reputation of the lyrical trouvere was founded rather on his music than his verse. The metrical 

forms were various, and were gradually reduced to rule; the _ballette_, of Provencal origin, was a 

more elaborate _rondet_, consisting of stanzas and refrain; the _estampie_ (_stampon_, to beat 

the ground with the foot) was a dancing-song; the lyric _lai_, virtually identical with the _descort_, 

consisted of stanzas which varied in structure; the _motet_, a name originally applied to pieces of 

church music, was freer in versification, and occasionally dealt with popular themes. Among forms 

which cannot be included under the general title of chansons, are those in dialogue derived from 

the Provencal literature; in the _tenson_ or _debat_ the two interlocutors put forth their opinions on 

what theme they may please; in the _jeu parti_ one of the imagined disputants proposes two 

contrary solutions of some poetical or amorous question, and defends whichever solution his 

associate refuses to accept; the earliest _jeu parti_, attributed to Gace Brule and Count Geoffroi of 

Brittany, belongs to the second half of the twelfth century. The _serventois_ were historical poems, 

and among them songs of the crusades, or moral, or religious, or satirical pieces, directed against 

woman and the worship of woman. To these various species we should add the songs in honour 



of the saints, the sorrows of the Virgin uttered at the foot of the cross, and other devout lyrics 

which lie outside the _poesie courtoise_. With the close of the thirteenth century this fashion of 

artificial love-lyric ceased: a change passed over the modes of thought and feeling in aristocratic 

society, and other forms took the place of those found in the _poesie courtoise_.   II FABLES, 

AND RENARD THE FOX  The desire of ecclesiastical writers in the Middle Ages to give 

prominence to that part of classical literature which seemed best suited to the purpose of 

edification caused the fables of Phaedrus and Avianus to be regarded with special honour. 

Various renderings from the thirteenth century onwards were made under the title of _Isopets_,[1] 

a name appropriated to collections of fables whether derived from AEsop or from other sources. 

The twelfth-century fables in verse of Marie de France, founded on an English collection, include 

apologues derived not only from classical authors but from the tales of popular tradition. A great 

collection made about 1450 by Steinhoewel, a physician of Ulm, was translated into French, and 

became the chief source of later collections, thus appearing in the remote ancestry of the work of 

La Fontaine. The aesthetic value of the mediaeval fables, including those of Marie de France, is 

small; the didactic intention was strong, the literary art was feeble.  [Footnote 1: The earlier

otherwise with the famous beast-epic, the ROMAN DE RENARD. The cycle consists of many 

parts or "branches" connected by a common theme; originating and obscurely developed in the 

North, in Picardy, in Normandy, and the Isle of France, it suddenly appeared in literature in the 

middle of the twelfth century, and continued to receive additions and variations during nearly two 

hundred years. The spirit of the _Renard_ poems is essentially bourgeois; the heroes of the 

_chansons de geste_ achieve their wondrous deeds by strength and valour; Renard the fox is 

powerful by skill and cunning; the greater beasts--his chief enemy the wolf, and others--are no 

match for his ingenuity and endless resources; but he is powerless against smaller creatures, the 

cock, the crow, the sparrow. The names of the personages are either significant names, such as 

Noble, the lion, and Chanticleer, the cock, or proper names, such as Isengrin, the wolf, Bruno, the 

bear, Tibert, the cat, Bernard, the ass; and as certain of these proper names are found in the 

eastern district, it has been conjectured that a poet of Lotharingia in the tenth century first told in 

Latin the wars of fox and wolf, and that through translations the epic matter, derived originally from 

popular tradition, reached the trouveres of the North. While in a certain degree typical figures, the 

beasts are at the same time individual; Renard is not the representative merely of a species; he is 

Renard, an individual, with a personality of

1.E.1.  The a wolf, he is the particular wolf Isengrin; each is an epic individual, heroic and undying. 

Classical fable remotely exerted an influence on certain branches of the Romance; but the vital 

substance of the epic is derived from the stores of popular tradition in which material from all 

quarters--the North of Europe and the Eastern world--had been gradually fused. In the artistic 

treatment of such material the chief difficulty lies in preserving a just measure between the beast-

character and the imported element of humanity. Little by little the anthropomorphic features were 

developed at the expense of verisimilitude; the beast forms became a mere masquerade; the 

romances were converted into a satire, and the satire lost rather than gained by the inefficient 

disguise.  The earliest branches of the cycle have reached us only in a fragmentary way, but they 

can be in part reconstructed from the Latin _Isengrinus_ of Nivard of Ghent (about 1150), and 

from the German _Reinhart Fuchs_, a rendering from the French by an Alsatian, Henri le 

Glichezare (about 1180). The wars of Renard and Isengrin are here sung, and the failure of 

Renard's trickeries against the lesser creatures; the spirit of these early branches is one of frank 

gaiety, untroubled by a didactic or satirical intention. In the branches of the second period the 

parody of human

known as the Branch of the Judgment is masterly--an ironical comedy, in which, without sacrifice 

of the primitive character of the beast-epic, the spirit of mediaeval life is transported into the animal 

world. Isengrin, the accuser of Renard before King Noble and his court, is for a moment worsted; 

the fox is vindicated, when suddenly enters a funeral cortege--Chanticleer and his four wives bear 

upon a
