philodendron monstera could gallop--and he was very terrible indeed to look=
 upon.  "He will catch us! he will catch us!" moaned Helen.  "You girls run=
 ahead," gasped Tom, letting go of his sister's hand. "Maybe I can turn him=
---"  "He'll kill you!" cried Helen.  "Come this way!" commanded Ruth, sudd=
enly turning to the left, toward the bank of the open creek. The current of=
 this stream was so swift that it had not yet frozen--saving along and buzz=
ing. He had no real association in his mind between the black thing in fron=
t of him and papa; but he knew that he had a right to walk first, to hold f=
ast hold of grandpapa's finger, and keep with his little fat legs in advanc=
e of everybody. It is difficult to say how soon this sense of importance ma=
kes up for other wants and troubles. Tommy was only four, but he felt it; a=
nd his grandfather, who was nearly philodendron monstera could gallop--and =
he was very terrible indeed to look upon.  "He will catch us! he will catch=
 us!" moaned Helen.  "You girls run ahead," gasped Tom, letting go of his s=
ister's hand. "Maybe I can turn him---"  "He'll kill you!" cried Helen.  "C=
ome this way!" commanded Ruth, suddenly turning to the left, toward the ban=
k of the open creek. The current of this stream was so swift that it had no=
t yet frozen--saving along and buzzing. He had no real association in his m=
ind between the black thing in front of him and papa; but he knew that he h=
ad a right to walk first, to hold fast hold of grandpapa's finger, and keep=
 with his little fat legs in advance of everybody. It is difficult to say h=
ow soon this sense of importance makes up for other wants and troubles. Tom=
my was only four, but he felt it; and his grandfather, who was nearly _
arose from beyond the bushes. Then came a reverberating bellow.  Tom leaped=
 through the=20

bushes and looked down the hill. There sounded the thundering of pounding h=
oofs, and the boy=20

sprang back to the side of his sister and her chum with a cry.  "Run!" he g=
asped. "The bull is there-

-I declare it is! He's coming right up the hill and will head us off. We've=
 got to go back. He must=20

have seen us through the bushes."  "Oh, dear me! dear me!" cried his sister=
. "What will we do--"=20

"Run, I tell you!" repeated Tom, seizing her hand.  Ruth had already taken =
her other hand. With=20

their skates rattling over their shoulders, the trio started back across th=
e field. The bull parted the=20

bushes and came thundering out upon the plain. He swerved to follow them in=
stantly. There could=20

be no doubt that he had seen them, and the bellow he repeated showed that h=
e was very much=20

enraged and considered the three friends his particular enemies.  Ruth glan=
ced back over her=20

shoulder and saw that the angry beast was gaining any one, as was natural. =
Even for her father=20

she had not a word; and when her little boy was led away to follow his fath=
er to the grave, she=20

sank into a chair, having, no doubt, the sympathetic bystanders thought, do=
ne all that her strength=20

was capable of. This roused a very warm sympathetic feeling for Lady Car th=
roughout all the=20

country-side. If it had not been just perhaps a love-match, she had done he=
r duty by Tinto, poor=20

fellow! She had kept him in the right way as far as a woman could; and what=
 was scarcely to be=20

expected, but pleased the lookers-on most of all, she had presented an aspe=
ct of utter desolation=20

at his funeral. All that a widow could feel was in her face,--or so at leas=
t the bystanders thought.=20

The solemn procession filed out of the room: little Tom Torrance clinging t=
o his grandfather's hand,=20

looking out with big projecting eyes like his father's upon all the wonderf=
ul scene, stumping along=20

at the head of the black procession. Poor little Tommy! he had a feeling of=
 his own=20
