night!  It must have been after two in the morning, when we saw the Eager S=
oul and the Gilded=20

Youth walking around the court as they used to pace the deck together. Once=
 or twice they=20

passed our window, and we heard their voices. They were having some sort of=
 a tall talk on=20

philosophical matters, which annoyed Henry. The ocean and onion soup and ph=
ilosophical=20

theorizing never seemed reasonable, normal expressions of anything properly=
 in the cosmos to=20

Henry; he professed to believe that persons who tolerated these things woul=
d sooner or later be=20

caught using the words "group" and "reaction" and "hypothesis," and he woul=
d have none of them.=20

But for all that she used the word group and once confessed that she was a =
subscriber to the New=20

Republic, Henry did like the Eager Soul; so he waked me up from a doze to s=
ay: "Bill, she's putting=20

him through the eye of the needle all right. And he's sliding through slick=
 as goose-grease. I heard=20

him telling her a minute ago that the war isn't for boundaries and geograph=
y; but for a restatement=20

of human creeds. Then she said that steam and electricity have over-capital=
ized the world; that we=20

are paying too highly for superintendence and that the price of superintend=
ence must come down,=20

and wages must come up. Then he said that he and his class will go in the f=
ires burning out there--

melted like wax. And she told him that they both had a lot of stolen goods =
on them--bodies and=20

minds, and hearts cultivated at the expense of their fellow creatures whose=
 lives had been=20

narrowed that theirs might be broadened. And you should have heard her talk=
 about the Young=20

Doctor--a self-made man, who had earned his way through college and medical=
 school, and made=20

his own place professionally. She said he was the Herald of the New Day. Bi=
ll," sighed Henry,=20

"what would you give if you could talk like that--again?" But from me, drow=
sily, came this: "Henry--

do you suppose she will get around to that slapping tonight she promised hi=
m on the boat? That=20

would be worth staying up to see!"  "She'll never slap him. He'll never nee=
d it. She's talked him=20

clear out of the mood!"  "Yes, she has--yes, she has," came from me. And He=
nry insisted:  "She=20

may have to slap the Doctor; but she has steered this boy out of the danger=
 zone into the open=20

sea of friendship."  "Oh, yes, she has; oh, yes, she has," came the echo fr=
om the other bed! And=20

Henry subsided.  But the buzzing about the hospital would not let us sleep.=
 At three o'clock=20

evidently they were serving tea to the nurses, or lunch of some kind. The m=
oon was shining=20

straight down into the court; the Gilded Youth and the Eager Soul had gone =
in, and another=20

couple, a stenographer and a hospital orderly were using it as a parlour.  =
"Queer, queer business,=20

this love-making under the rustle of the wings of death," said Henry. A Fre=
nch plane flying across=20

had filled the compound for a moment. But everyone soon recognized its pecu=
liar buzz. Then for a=20

few seconds from afar came the low ominous hum of the German planes. But th=
ey circled away=20

from us. Perhaps the French drove them back. However, it was the excitement=
 in the court that=20

caused Henry's remark. For the young people did not deflect their monotonou=
s course about the=20

compound, when the sky-gazers had returned indoors. Around and around they =
went, talking,=20

talking, talking, with the low insistent murmur of deeply interested people=
. Their nerves were taut;=20

emotion was raw; they were young, and their blood moved riotously. And ther=
e was the moon, the=20

moon that, since man could turn his face upward, has been the symbol of the=
 thing called love.=20

And now all over that long line slashed across the face of Europe, the moon=
 is the herald of death.=20

Men see it rise in terror, for they know that the season of the moon is the=
 season of slaughter. Yet=20

there they walked in the hospital yard, two unknown lovers, who were true t=
o the moon.  Henry's=20

next remark was: "Bill, fancy when you were young doing your courting out t=
here where a shell is=20



liable to wipe you out any second. We at least had the advantage of elm tre=
es to protect us from=20

the shafts of death."  "Do you suppose, Henry," answered his friend, "that =
they miss the drip of=20

oars, the shade of the overhanging willows, the suggestive whisper of water=
s frisking over the=20

ripples at the ford? How can they make love in such a place?"  "'Gold,'" re=
plied Henry, quoting=20

from Solomon, who was wise, "'is where you find it!'" Then we heard the ins=
istence of the lovers'=20

babble drawing near us again. As they turned a corner, Henry heaved a sigh =
at the perversity of=20

youth in the flaunting neglect of sleep and death, which ever are vital to =
middle years. We both=20

looked out to the white courtyard, heard the snarl of another plane, obviou=
sly French, but still=20

disconcerting, saw the slow even pace of the lovers, unaffected by the appr=
oaching growl of the=20

plane, and it came to me to quote one wiser even than Solomon: "O death, wh=
ere is thy sting!"=20

We took but a cat-nap that night, and in the morning set down the score on =
our love affair. The=20

record indicates that during the day Henry had lost; during the night he ha=
d won. He put it down in=20

his black book against the time when we should get to Paris, where money wo=
uld buy things. For=20

we ate at camps, slept in hospitals or in barns or in mess rooms of the amb=
ulance men, and day=20

by day and night after night we saw much misery and were "acquainted with g=
rief." There are so=20

many kinds of hospitals in France! The great streams of broken men that flo=
w unceasingly down=20

from the front are divided as they reach the base hospitals and field hospi=
tals into scores of=20

smaller currents, each flowing to a separate place, where specialists treat=
 the various cases. The=20

blind go one way; those dumb with shell-shock go another; jaw cases separat=
e from men with=20

scalp wounds, and hip fractures are divided from shoulder fractures as the =
sheep from the goats.=20

Travelling about among the hospitals one picks up curious unrelated and une=
xplained bits of=20

information; as, for instance, that the British Tommy is the most patient m=
an in Europe under pain.=20

He likes to distinguish between himself and his wound and is likely to repl=
y to the doctor any fine=20

morning, "Me? Oh, I'm right at the top form, Sir; but my leg is bothering m=
e a bit, Sir!" The=20

Canadian isn't so game under a roof as he is under the open sky and in the =
charge. And the=20

American grunts more than he should. But here is a queer thing. The French =
tubercular soldier is=20

despondent. With Americans, tuberculosis breeds hope. Perhaps it is the buo=
yancy of the young=20

blood of our country; but no American feels he is ever going to die with tu=
berculosis. He feels he is=20

hit hard; that it may take six months or a year to get on his feet; after t=
hat--he goes on dreaming=20

his dream. But the tubercular French soldiers are the saddest looking men i=
n Europe.  Back in=20

Kansas last spring we had heard a story to the effect that the Germans were=
 inoculating the=20

French and Belgians behind the lines of the allies with tubercular bacteria=
. We asked French and=20

American and British doctors about that story, and they all answered that t=
here was nothing to it.=20

The doctors told us that the Germans have a cheaper and better way to fill =
France with=20

tuberculosis than by wasting serum on their enemies. And then, one day in a=
 tuberculosis hospital=20

we picked up this story, which explained what the doctors meant.  We met a =
young man from Lille.=20

It was his birthday; Henry bought him a bouquet. He told us his story. He s=
aid:  "Three years ago=20

when the war broke out I was 19 years old and was living in Lille with my p=
arents. The Germans=20

came to our house one day with their guns and took me away. They took me to=
 a town in=20

Germany; I think it was Essen, where they made me work in an iron or steel =
mill. I worked fourteen=20

hours a day, slept on straw outside the works in a shed, had only the cloth=
es they took me in and=20

had only bran to eat!"  "Only bran?" we asked, doubting it.  "Only bran," t=
he interpreter repeated,=20



and from half a dozen cots near by, where others who had suffered as he had=
, heard our question,=20

came the echo of his confirmation, "Only bran to eat!" He soon caught cold,=
 and soon the "cold"=20

became tuberculosis, and after three years of this his sick days exceeded h=
is work days, and in=20

due course he and five hundred others were assembled, put on a train and sh=
ipped out of=20

Germany through Switzerland to Evian in France. Three hundred thousand of t=
hese poor husks,=20

men, women, and children, have been dumped into France in the last seven mo=
nths. Two=20

trainloads of them arrive at Evian every day. The men and women, mostly tub=
ercular, do not tarry.=20

They push on into France, a deadly white stream.  In time the week ended th=
at marked our first=20

trip to the French front. During that week we lived almost entirely in the =
war zone, and under war=20

conditions. The food was good--better than good, it was excellent, but not =
plentiful, and the beds=20

were clean and full of sleep. The only physical discomfort we found was in =
the lack of drinking=20

water. We were warned against all local water.  My feelings on the subject =
of the French coffee=20

and milk were something like Henry's antipathy to onion soup. But we both l=
oved water with our=20

meals. We had been vaccinated against typhoid, and we were rather insistent=
 that we could drink=20

any kind of water, if it was reasonably clean. But men said "this country i=
s no place to drink water.=20

It has been a battle-ground and a cemetery for three years." Still we insis=
ted, and then, Mr.=20

Norton, head of the American ambulance, told us this one: "Out behind a bar=
rage once near the=20

Champagne; helping the stretcher bearers; nasty weather, rain, and cold. Bu=
t there we were. We=20

couldn't get in. We ducked from shell hole to shell hole. Finally I found a=
 nice deep one, with water=20

in the bottom--oh, maybe five feet of water in a fifteen foot hole, and I s=
tayed there; two days and=20

nights. My canteen went dry, and for a day or two I scooped water out of th=
e shell hole and drank=20

it. Good enough tasting water so far as that goes, and fresh too! But at th=
e end of the third day, I=20

decided it wasn't agreeing with me and quit."  "Why?" we asked. "Did you le=
ave the shell hole?"=20

"No--oh, no. It was a good shell hole. I stayed. But you know Fritzie came =
up!" he answered.  So=20

our taste for water with our meals, which is America's choicest privilege, =
passed. Henry could=20

drink the coffee, but it didn't taste good to me. The brackish red wine the=
y served with the army=20

ration tasted like diluted vinegar and looked like pokeberry ink. It seemed=
 only good to put in our=20

fountain pens. A tablespoonful would last me all day. Our week's trip ended=
 at Monter-en-Der,=20

where there was a hotel and an Ambulance corps unit that had been over to v=
isit the American=20

troops and had brought back from the commissary department much loot. Among=
 other things was=20

water--bottled water, pure unfermented water. And when we sat at table they=
 brought me a bottle.=20

Try going seven days on pokeberry ink and boiled coffee yourself and note t=
he reaction. Your=20

veins will be dry; your stomach will crackle as it grinds the food. The wat=
er in that bottle, a quart=20

bottle, evaporated. They brought another. It disappeared. They brought a th=
ird. The waiters in the=20

hotel were attracted by the sight. No Frenchman ever drinks water with his =
meals, and the=20

spectacle of this American sousing himself with water while he ate was a ra=
re sight. The waiters=20

gathered in the corner to watch me. Henry saw them, and motioned toward me,=
 and tapped his=20

forehead. They went and brought other waiters and men from the bar. He was =
a rare bird; this=20

American going on a big drunk on water. So they peered in doors, through wi=
ndows and stood in=20

the diningroom corners to watch the fourth bottle go down. And when at the =
end of the meal the=20

American rose, and walked through the crowd, they made way for him. A despe=
rate man at least=20

commands respect, whatever his delusion may be.  And that night we left the=
 French front, and=20



nosed our car toward Paris.  There we made preparations to go to the headqu=
arters of the=20

American Army. In Paris also we got into our new regulation Red Cross unifo=
rms. Ever since man=20

first pinned a buffalo tail to the back of his belt, and stuck a rooster fe=
ather in his matted hair, he=20

has been proud of his uniform. Sex vanity expresses itself most gorgeously =
in a uniform, and when=20

they put Henry and me into uniforms, even carefully repressed Red Cross uni=
forms, open at the=20

neck and with blue dabs on our coat lapels to distinguish us from the "firs=
t class fighting man," we=20

were so proud that often five or six consecutive minutes passed when we wer=
en't afraid of what=20

our wives would say about the $124 each had spent for the togs. At times ou=
r attitude toward our=20

wives was not unlike that of drunken rabbits hunting brazenly for the dogs!=
 But when we slipped=20

into citizen clothes, sobriety and remorse covered us, and we shook sad hea=
ds. We wore the=20

uniforms little about Paris; for our Sam Browne belts kept us returning sal=
utes until our arms hurt.=20

They couldn't break me of the habit of saluting with a newspaper or a packa=
ge or a pencil in my=20

hand. And my return of the interminable round of salutes from French, Briti=
sh, and Italian soldiers=20

who throng Paris, probably insulted--all unbeknownst to me--hundreds of our=
 allies, and made=20

them sneer at our flag. So it seemed best for us to wear these uniforms onl=
y where soldiers=20

congregated who would know us for the gawks that we were and forgive us our=
 military=20

trespasses. Then a real day came when our Red Cross duties took us to Gener=
al Pershing's=20

headquarters.  [Illustration: He was a rare bird; this American going on a =
big drunk on water]  For=20

Americans during the year 1918, "Somewhere in France," will mean the Joan o=
f Arc country. It is=20

not in the war zone, but lies among the hills of Central France, a four or =
five hours' auto ride from=20

Paris. To reach the American "Somewhere in France" from Paris, one crosses =
the battle-field of=20

the Marne, and we passed it the day after the third anniversary, when all t=
he hundreds of roadside=20

graves that marked the French advance were a-bloom and a-flutter with the t=
ri-colour. Great=20

doings were afoot the day before on that battle-field. Bands had played tri=
umphant songs, and=20

orators had spoken and the leaders of France--soldier and civilian--had com=
e out and wept and=20

France had released her emotions and was better for it. We passed through M=
eaux and hurried on=20

east to St. Dizier, where we stopped for the night. We put up at a dingy li=
ttle inn, filled to=20

overflowing with as curious a company as ever gathered under one roof. Of c=
ourse there were=20

French soldiers--scores of them, mostly officers in full dress, going to th=
e line or coming from it.=20

Then there were fathers and mothers of soldiers and sisters and sweethearts=
 of soldiers and wives=20

of soldiers bound for the front or coming home. And there we were, the only=
 Americans in the=20

house, with just enough French to order "des oeufs" and coffee "au lait" an=
d "ros bif and jambon=20

and pain" and to ask how much and then make them say it slowly and stick th=
e sum up on their=20

fingers. We were having engine trouble. And our car was groaning and coughi=
ng and muttering in=20

the gloomy little court of the inn. Around the court ran the sleeping rooms=
, and under one end,=20

forty feet from the diningroom, was what was once the stable, and what now =
is the garage.=20

Frenchmen wandered up, looked at our chauffeur (from Utica, N. Y.) tried to=
 diagnose the case,=20

found we did not understand and then moved away. But it was a twelve-cylind=
er American=20

machine and the Frenchmen, discovering that, kept coming back to it. As we =
sat on the cement=20

platform of the tavern, kicking our heels against it and bemoaning the foll=
ies of youth which had=20

corrupted our Freshman and Sophomore French, there came and sat beside us a=
 pretty woman.=20

She had black snappy eyes, fresh dark skin, and jet black hair, so curly th=
at it was almost frowsy.=20



She listened to us for a moment, then hopped aboard our talk like a boy fli=
pping a street car:=20

"Kansas--eh? I once lived in Oklahoma City. My father ran the Bee Hive!"  "=
Angels of mercy,=20

angels of light!" This from me. "Say, will you interpret for us?"  "Sure mi=
ke! sir," she said. And then=20

added: "And if it's engine trouble my husband upstairs is a chauffeur. Shal=
l I get him?" And when=20

she returned with him, he fell to, glad enough to get a look into a twelve-=
cylinder American car.=20

Henry stood by him, and with the woman acting as interlocutor, between our =
driver and her=20

husband we soon had the trouble located and the dissimulator--Henry maintai=
ns that all engine=20

trouble is connected in some way with a dissimulator--rectified, and while =
the job was going on, he=20

expounded the twelve cylinders to the French, puffed on his dreadnaught pip=
e, and left the lady=20

from Oklahoma City to me. She was keen for talk. Between her official commu=
niques to her=20

husband and our driver, she got in this:  "Yes, I know Frank Wickoff in Okl=
ahoma City--knew him=20

when he was poor as Job's turkey, and then my folks used to borrow money at=
 his bank. Before=20

we came to Oklahoma City we lived in Austin. We ran the Good Luck, or was i=
t the Fair; no, we=20

ran the Fair in Dallas." At a quick look at her face from me she laughed an=
d said: "Oh, yes, I'm=20

Jew all right. No," she returned to a query, "I never was in Wichita. But w=
hen we moved to=20

Blackwell we used to take the Beacon!"  "Henry, come here," came the call f=
rom me. "Here is old=20

Subscriber and Constant Reader!" Then Henry came up and the subsequent proc=
eedings=20

interested me no more. For Henry took the witness. And the three of us, kic=
king our heels on the=20

cement wall below us, sat swapping yarns about mutual friends in the Southw=
est. It seems that in=20

France the lady is a pedlar who goes from town to town on market day with n=
otions and runs a=20

little notion wagon through the country between times. She told us of an ai=
r raid of the night before=20

on St. Dizier where eleven people had been killed and urged us to stay for =
the funeral the next=20

day. It was to be a sight worth seeing. Most of the dead were women and chi=
ldren. There was=20

nothing military in the little town but the two hotels that housed soldiers=
 and their friends and=20

relatives going to the front and coming back. Yet the Germans had come, dro=
pped a score of=20

bombs on the town, then had flown away for another town, dropping their hat=
eful eggs across=20

country as they went. Luneville had lost half a dozen, Fismes half a score,=
 and other towns of the=20

neighbourhood, accordingly--all civilians, mostly women and children; and n=
ot a town raided had=20

any military works or if it had a munition factory, the bombs had hit miles=
 from the plants.=20

[Illustration: Henry puffed on his dreadnaught pipe and left the lady from =
Oklahoma City to me]=20

We were beginning to realize slowly what a hell of torture and disease and =
expression, which has=20

struck us by its simple candour: they are, no doubt, my relations; I unders=
tand them when they=20

speak to me. But these very savages detest all who are not of their family,=
 or their tribe; and hunt=20

the Indians of a neighbouring tribe, who live at war with their own, as we =
hunt game. They know=20

the duties of family ties and of relationship, but not those of humanity, w=
hich require the feeling of=20

a common tie with beings framed like ourselves. No emotion of pity prompts =
them to spare the=20

wives or children of a hostile race; and the latter are devoured in prefere=
nce, at the repast given at=20

the conclusion of a battle or warlike incursion.  The hatred which savages =
for the most part feel for=20

men who speak another idiom, and appear to them to be of an inferior race, =
is sometimes=20

rekindled in the missions, after having long slumbered. A short time before=
 our arrival at=20

Esmeralda, an Indian, born in the forest* behind the Duida, travelled alone=
 with another Indian,=20

who, after having been made prisoner by the Spaniards on the banks of the V=
entuario, lived=20



peaceably in the village, or, as it is expressed here, within the sound of =
the bell (debaxo de la=20

campana.) (* En el monte. The Indians born in the missions are distinguishe=
d from those born in=20

the woods. The word monte signifies more frequently, in the colonies, a for=
est (bosque) than a=20

mountain, and this circumstance has led to great errors in our maps, on whi=
ch chains of mountains=20

(sierras) are figured, where there are only thick forests, (monte espeso.))=
 The latter could only=20

walk slowly, because he was suffering from one of those fevers to which the=
 natives are subject,=20

when they arrive in the missions, and abruptly change their diet. Wearied b=
y his delay, his fellow-

traveller killed him, and hid the body behind a copse of thick trees, near =
Esmeralda. This crime,=20

like many others among the Indians, would have remained unknown, if the mur=
derer had not made=20

preparations for a feast on the following day. He tried to induce his child=
ren, born in the mission=20

and become Christians, to go with him for some parts of the dead body. They=
 had much difficulty=20

in persuading him to desist from his purpose; and the soldier who was poste=
d at Esmeralda,=20

learned from the domestic squabble caused by this event, what the Indians w=
ould have concealed=20

from his knowledge.  It is known that cannibalism and the practice of human=
 sacrifices, with which=20

it is often connected, are found to exist in all parts of the globe, and am=
ong people of very different=20

races;* but what strikes us more in the study of history is to see human sa=
crifices retained in a=20

state of civilization somewhat advanced; and that the nations who hold it a=
 point of honour to=20

devour their prisoners are not always the rudest and most ferocious. (* Som=
e casual instances of=20

children carried off by the negroes in the island of Cuba have led to the b=
elief, in the Spanish=20

colonies, that there are tribes of cannibals in Africa. This opinion, thoug=
h supported by some=20

travellers, is not borne out by the researches of Mr. Barrow on the interio=
r of that country.=20

Superstitious practices may have given rise to imputations perhaps as unjus=
t as those of which=20

Jewish families were the victims in the ages of intolerance and persecution=
.) The painful facts=20

have not escaped the observation of those missionaries who are sufficiently=
 enlightened to reflect=20

on the manners of the surrounding tribes. The Cabres, the Guipunaves, and t=
he Caribs, have=20

always been more powerful and more civilized than the other hordes of the O=
rinoco; and yet the=20

two former are as much addicted to anthropophagy as the latter are repugnan=
t to it. We must=20

carefully distinguish the different branches into which the great family of=
 the Caribbee nations is=20

divided. These branches are as numerous as those of the Mongols, and the we=
stern Tartars, or=20

Turcomans. The Caribs of the continent, those who inhabit the plains betwee=
n the Lower Orinoco,=20

the Rio Branco, the Essequibo, and the sources of the Oyapoc, hold in horro=
r the practice of=20

devouring their enemies. This barbarous custom,* at the first discovery of =
America, existed only=20

among the Caribs of the West Indies. (* See Geraldini Itinerarium page 186 =
and the eloquent tract=20

of cardinal Bembo on the discoveries of Columbus. "Insularum partem homines=
 incolebant feri=20

trucesque, qui puerorum et virorum carnibus, quos aliis in insulus bello au=
t latrociniis cepissent,=20

vescebantur; a feminis abstinebant; Canibales appellati." "Some of the isla=
nds are inhabited by a=20

cruel and savage race, called cannibals, who eat the flesh of men and boys,=
 and captives and=20

slaves of the male sex, abstaining from that of females." Hist. Venet. 1551=
. The custom of sparing=20

the lives of female prisoners confirms what I have previously said of the l=
anguage of the women.=20

Does the word cannibal, applied to the Caribs of the West India Islands, be=
long to the language of=20

this archipelago (that of Haiti)? or must we seek for it in an idiom of Flo=
rida, which some traditions=20

indicate as the first country of the Caribs?) It is they who have rendered =
the names of cannibals,=20



Caribbees, and anthropophagi, synonymous; it was their cruelties that promp=
ted the law=20

promulgated in 1504, by which the Spaniards were permitted to make a slave =
of every individual of=20

an American nation which could be proved to be of Caribbee origin. I believ=
e, however, that the=20

anthropophagy of the inhabitants of the West India Islands was much exagger=
ated by early=20

travellers, whose stories Herrera, a grave and judicious historian, has not=
 disdained to repeat in=20

his Decades historicas. He has even credited that extraordinary event which=
 led the Caribs to=20

renounce this barbarous custom. The natives of a little island devoured a D=
ominican monk whom=20

they had carried off from the coast of Porto Rico; they all fell sick, and =
would never again eat monk=20

or layman.  If the Caribs of the Orinoco, since the commencement of the six=
teenth century, have=20

differed in their manners from those of the West India Islands; if they are=
 unjustly accused of=20

anthropophagy; it is difficult to attribute this difference to any superior=
ity of their social state. The=20

strangest contrasts are found blended in this mixture of nations, some of w=
hom live only upon fish,=20

monkeys, and ants; while others are more or less cultivators of the ground,=
 more or less occupied=20

in making and painting pottery, or weaving hammocks or cotton cloth. Severa=
l of the latter tribes=20

have preserved inhuman customs altogether unknown to the former. "You canno=
t imagine," said=20

the old missionary of Mandavaca, "the perversity of this Indian race (famil=
ia de Indios). You=20

receive men of a new tribe into the village; they appear to be mild, good, =
and laborious; but suffer=20

them to take part in an incursion (entrada) to bring in the natives, and yo=
u can scarcely prevent=20

them from murdering all they meet, and hiding some portions of the dead bod=
ies." In reflecting on=20

the manners of these Indians, we are almost horrified at that combination o=
f sentiments which=20

seem to exclude each other; that faculty of nations to become but partially=
 humanized; that=20

preponderance of customs, prejudices, and traditions, over the natural affe=
ctions of the heart. We=20

had a fugitive Indian from the Guaisia in our canoe, who had become suffici=
ently civilized in a few=20

weeks to be useful to us in placing the instruments necessary for our obser=
vations at night. He=20

was no less mild than intelligent, and we had some desire of taking him int=
o our service. What was=20

our horror when, talking to him by means of an interpreter, we learned, tha=
t the flesh of the=20

marimonde monkeys, though blacker, appeared to him to have the taste of hum=
an flesh. He told=20

us that his relations (that is, the people of his tribe) preferred the insi=
de of the hands in man, as in=20

bears. This assertion was accompanied with gestures of savage gratification=
. We inquired of this=20

young man, so calm and so affectionate in the little services which he rend=
ered us, whether he still=20

felt sometimes a desire to eat of a Cheruvichahena. He answered, without di=
scomposure, that,=20

living in the mission, he would only eat what he saw was eaten by the Padre=
s. Reproaches=20

addressed to the natives on the abominable practice which we here discuss, =
produce no effect; it=20

is as if a Brahmin, travelling in Europe, were to reproach us with the habi=
t of feeding on the flesh of=20

animals. In the eyes of the Indian of the Guaisia, the Cheruvichahena was a=
 being entirely=20

different from himself; and one whom he thought it was no more unjust to ki=
ll than the jaguars of=20

the forest. It was merely from a sense of propriety that, whilst he remaine=
d in the mission, he=20

would only eat the same food as the Fathers. The natives, if they return to=
 their tribe (al monte), or=20

find themselves pressed by hunger, soon resume their old habits of anthropo=
phagy. And why=20

should we be so much astonished at this inconstancy in the tribes of the Or=
inoco, when we are=20

reminded, by terrible and well-ascertained examples, of what has passed amo=
ng civilized nations=20

in times of great scarcity? In Egypt, in the thirteenth century, the habit =
of eating human flesh=20



pervaded all classes of society; extraordinary snares were spread for physi=
cians in particular.=20

They were called to attend persons who pretended to be sick, but who were o=
nly hungry; and it=20

was not in order to be consulted, but devoured. An historian of great verac=
ity, Abd-allatif, has=20

related how a practice, which at first inspired dread and horror, soon occa=
sioned not even the=20

slightest surprise.* (* "When the poor began to eat human flesh, the horror=
 and astonishment=20

caused by repasts so dreadful were such that these crimes furnished the nev=
er-ceasing subject of=20

every conversation. But at length the people became so accustomed to it, an=
d conceived such a=20

taste for this detestable food, that people of wealth and respectability we=
re found to use it as their=20

ordinary food, to eat it by way of a treat, and even to lay in a stock of i=
t. This flesh was prepared in=20

different ways, and the practice being once introduced, spread into the pro=
vinces, so that=20

instances of it were found in every part of Egypt. It then no longer caused=
 any surprise; the horror=20

it had at first inspired vanished; and it was mentioned as an indifferent a=
nd ordinary thing. This=20

mania of devouring one another became so common among the poor, that the gr=
eater part=20

perished in this manner. These wretches employed all sorts of artifices, to=
 seize men by surprise,=20

or decoy them into their houses under false pretences. This happened to thr=
ee physicians among=20

those who visited me; and a bookseller who sold me books, an old and very c=
orpulent man, fell=20

into their snares, and escaped with great difficulty. All the facts which w=
e relate as eye-witnesses=20

fell under our observation accidentally, for we generally avoided witnessin=
g spectacles which=20

inspired us with so much horror." Account of Egypt by Abd-allatif, physicia=
n of Bagdad, translated=20

into French by De Sacy pages 360 to 374.)  Although the Indians of the Cass=
iquiare readily return=20

to their barbarous habits, they evince, whilst in the missions, intelligenc=
e, some love of labour,=20

and, in particular, a great facility in learning the Spanish language. The =
villages being, for the most=20

part, inhabited by three or four tribes, who do not understand each other, =
a foreign idiom, which is=20

at the same time that of the civil power, the language of the missionary, a=
ffords the advantage of=20

more general means of communication. I heard a Poinave Indian conversing in=
 Spanish with a=20

Guahibo, though both had come from their forests within three months. They =
uttered a phrase=20

every quarter of an hour, prepared with difficulty, and in which the gerund=
 of the verb, no doubt=20

according to the grammatical turn of their own languages, was constantly em=
ployed. "When I=20

seeing Padre, Padre to me saying;"* (* "Quando io mirando Padre, Padre me d=
iciendo.") instead=20

of, "when I saw the missionary, he said to me." I have mentioned in another=
 place, how wise it=20

appeared to me in the Jesuits to generalize one of the languages of civiliz=
ed America, for instance=20

that of the Peruvians,* (* The Quichua or Inca language, Lengua del Inga.) =
and instruct the Indians=20

in an idiom which is foreign to them in its roots, but not in its structure=
 and grammatical forms. This=20

was following the system which the Incas, or king-priests of Peru had emplo=
yed for ages, in order=20

to humanize the barbarous nations of the Upper Maranon, and maintain them u=
nder their=20

domination; a system somewhat more reasonable than that of making the nativ=
es of America=20

speak Latin, as was gravely proposed in a provincial concilio at Mexico.  W=
e were told that the=20

Indians of the Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro are preferred on the Lower Ori=
noco, and especially=20

at Angostura, to the inhabitants of the other missions, on account of their=
 intelligence and activity.=20

Those of Mandavaca are celebrated among the tribes of their own race for th=
e preparation of the=20

curare poison, which does not yield in strength to the curare of Esmeralda.=
 Unhappily the natives=20

devote themselves to this employment more than to agriculture. Yet the soil=
 on the banks of the=20



Cassiquiare is excellent. We find there a granitic sand, of a blackish-brow=
n colour, which is=20

covered in the forests with thick layers of rich earth, and on the banks of=
 the river with clay almost=20

impermeable to water. The soil of the Cassiquiare appears more fertile than=
 that of the valley of=20

the Rio Negro, where maize does not prosper. Rice, beans, cotton, sugar, an=
d indigo yield rich=20

harvests, wherever their cultivation has been tried.* (* M. Bonpland found =
at Mandavaca, in the=20

huts of the natives, a plant with tuberous roots, exactly like cassava (yuc=
ca). It is called cumapana,=20

and is cooked by being baked on the ashes. It grows spontaneously on the ba=
nks of the=20

Cassiquiare.) We saw wild indigo around the missions of San Miguel de Davip=
e, San Carlos, and=20

Mandavaca. No doubt can exist that several nations of America, particularly=
 the Mexicans, long=20

before the conquest, employed real indigo in their hieroglyphic paintings; =
and that small cakes of=20

this substance were sold at the great market of Tenochtitlan. But a colouri=
ng matter, chemically=20

identical, may be extracted from plants belonging to neighbouring genera; a=
nd I should not at=20

present venture to affirm that the native indigoferae of America do not fur=
nish some generic=20

difference from the Indigofera anil, and the Indigofera argentea of the Old=
 World. In the coffee-

trees of both hemispheres this difference has been observed.  Here, as at t=
he Rio Negro, the=20

humidity of the air, and the consequent abundance of insects, are obstacles=
 almost invincible to=20

new cultivation. Everywhere you meet with those large ants that march in cl=
ose bands, and direct=20

their attacks the more readily on cultivated plants, because they are herba=
ceous and succulent,=20

whilst the forests of these countries afford only plants with woody stalks.=
 If a missionary wishes to=20

cultivate salad, or any culinary plant of Europe, he is compelled as it wer=
e to suspend his garden=20

in the air. He fills an old boat with good mould, and, having sown the seed=
, suspends it four feet=20

above the ground with cords of the chiquichiqui palm-tree; but most frequen=
tly places it on a slight=20

scaffolding. This protects the young plants from weeds, worms, and those an=
ts which pursue their=20

migration in a right line, and, not knowing what vegetates above them, seld=
om turn from their=20

course to climb up stakes that are stripped of their bark. I mention this c=
ircumstance to prove how=20

difficult, within the tropics, on the banks of great rivers, are the first =
attempts of man to appropriate=20

to himself a little spot of earth in that vast domain of nature, invaded by=
 animals, and covered by=20

spontaneous plants.  During the night of the 13th of May, I obtained some o=
bservations of the=20

stars, unfortunately the last at the Cassiquiare. The latitude of Mandavaca=
 is 2 degrees 4 minutes=20

7 seconds; its longitude, according to the chronometer, 69 degrees 27 minut=
es. I found the=20

magnetic dip 25.25 degrees (cent div), showing that it had increased consid=
erably from the fort of=20

San Carlos. Yet the surrounding rocks are of the same granite, mixed with a=
 little hornblende,=20

which we had found at Javita, and which assumes a syenitic aspect. We left =
Mandavaca at half-

past two in the morning. After six hours' voyage, we passed on the east the=
 mouth of the Idapa, or=20

Siapa, which rises on the mountain of Uuturan, and furnishes near its sourc=
es a portage to the Rio=20

Mavaca, one of the tributary streams of the Orinoco. This river has white w=
aters, and is not more=20

than half as broad as the Pacimoni, the waters of which are black. Its uppe=
r course has been=20

strangely misrepresented on maps. I shall have occasion hereafter to mentio=
n the hypotheses that=20

have given rise to these errors, in speaking of the source of the Orinoco. =
 We stopped near the=20

raudal of Cunuri. The noise of the little cataract augmented sensibly durin=
g the night, and our=20

Indians asserted that it was a certain presage of rain. I recollected that =
the mountaineers of the=20

Alps have great confidence in the same prognostic.* (* "It is going to rain=
, because we hear the=20



murmur of the torrents nearer," say the mountaineers of the Alps, like thos=
e of the Andes. The=20

cause of the phenomenon is a modification of the atmosphere, which has an i=
nfluence at once on=20

the sonorous and on the luminous undulations. The prognostic drawn from the=
 increase and the=20

intensity of sound is intimately connected with the prognostic drawn from a=
 less extinction of light.=20

The mountaineers predict a change of weather, when, the air being calm, the=
 Alps covered with=20

perpetual snow seem on a sudden to be nearer the observer, and their outlin=
es are marked with=20

great distinctness on the azure sky. What is it that causes the want of hom=
ogeneity in the vertical=20

strata of the atmosphere to disappear instantaneously?) It fell before sunr=
ise, and the araguato=20

monkeys had warned us, by their lengthened howlings, of the approaching rai=
n, long before the=20

noise of the cataract increased.  On the 14th, the mosquitos, and especiall=
y the ants, drove us=20

from the shore before two in the morning. We had hitherto been of opinion t=
hat the ants did not=20

crawl along the cords by which the hammocks are usually suspended: whether =
we were correct in=20

this supposition, or whether the ants fell on us from the tops of the trees=
, I cannot say; but certain=20

it is that we had great difficulty to keep ourselves free from these troubl=
esome insects. The river=20

became narrower as we advanced, and the banks were so marshy, that it was n=
ot without much=20

labour M. Bonpland could get to a Carolinea princeps loaded with large purp=
le flowers. This tree is=20

the most beautiful ornament of these forests, and of those of the Rio Negro=
. We examined=20

repeatedly, during this day, the=20


_
tuberculars in her homes, spreading poison there; two million homeless refu=
gees quartered=20

beyond the war zone; millions of soldiers living in the homes fifty miles b=
ack from the line, every=20

month bringing new men to these homes left by their comrades returning to t=
he battle front; air=20

raids by night slaying women and babies; commerce choked with the offering =
to the war god;=20

soldiers filling the highways; food, clothing and munitions taking all the =
space upon the railroads;=20

fuel almost prohibitively high; food scarce; and always talk of the war--of=
 nothing, absolutely=20

nothing but the war and its horrors. That France has held so long under thi=
s curse proves the=20

miracle of her divine courage! As we sat under the shrouded torches in the =
inn courtyard and=20

considered what life really means to the men and women of St. Dizier, once =
more we wondered=20

how we at home would react under the terrific punishment which these people=
 are taking; what=20

would Wichita do with her houses bombed, her homes crowded with refugees; h=
er parks and=20

schools and public buildings turned into barracks, her stores filled with g=
aping empty shelves, her=20

railroad yards clogged with munitions, and ever the mourners going about th=
e street and man to=20

his long home. How would Emporia act with the pestilence that stalketh in d=
arkness for ever near=20

her; with her women and children slaughtered, merely to break the morale of=
 the people and=20

cause them to plead for peace; with cripples from the war hidden away in a =
hundred sad homes,=20

with fatherless children and children born out of wedlock among the things =
that one had to face=20

daily? Perhaps our young Jewish friend thought we were wearying of her. For=
 she rose and said,=20

"Well, good-night, gents--pleasant dreams!"  Pleasant dreams--indeed!  But =
in the morning we=20

arose refreshed and hurried along a misty plain, forty miles or so from the=
 American troops.=20

Always in the background were great bushy trees, and lush green grass, and =
the thing was=20

composed. How the French manage to compose their landscape is too much for =
me. But at any of=20

a thousand points the scene might have been photographed for a Corot, by ge=
tting a few good-

looking girls in nighties to dance on the grass of the middle distance! Ame=
rican landscape has to=20

be picked apart to have its picture taken; a tree selected here, a hill the=
re, a brook yonder, and if=20

ladies in nighties are needed, they are brought from afar! They are not ind=
igenous to the soil. But=20

one feels that in France they might come sidling out from behind any willow=
 clump with their toes=20

rouged ready for the dance!  The road that morning seemed traversing a grea=
t picture gallery,=20

unwinding into life as from a dream within a dream! And then, after two hou=
rs of joyous landscape,=20

we waked and saw America! Now America was not a vision; it was substantial,=
 if not beautiful. As=20

we switched around a bend in the road we came upon America full-sized and b=
lood raw--a farmer=20

boy--bronzed, milk-eyed, good-natured, with the Middle West written all ove=
r him. He wore a=20

service hat at a forward pitch over his eyes; in his hands, conched to trem=
ulo the sound, he held=20

an harmonica; his eyes were aslit in the ecstasy of his own music; from the=
 crook of his arm=20

dangled a bridle, and he sat cross-legged high up on the quarter deck of a =
great four-story, full-

rigged Missouri mule. He didn't salute us but called "Hi" as we passed, and=
 then we knew that "our=20

flag was still there" and that we were near our troops.  The boys must be p=
opular in the=20

neighbourhood. For in the next village, which by the way was a town of ten =
thousand, our=20

American Red Cross uniforms were treated with distinguished courtesy. Henry=
 wanted a match.=20

He could talk no French but a little boy at the inn, seeing him fumbling th=
rough his clothes with an=20

unlighted pipe, came running to us with a little blue box of matches. Henry=
 gave the boy a franc--

more to be amiable than anything else. The boy flashed home to his mother p=
roud as Punch! And=20



just as we were pulling out of the village the boy came running to us with =
another little blue box of=20

matches. We thought the boy had discovered that matches would bring a franc=
 a box from=20

Americans and was preparing to make his fortune. So Henry took the box, and=
 as the car was=20

moving handed the boy another franc. We noticed him waving his hands and sh=
aking his head.=20

And when we were a mile out of the village Henry opened his second box and =
found his original=20

franc in it. The boy's mother was ashamed that he should have taken any mon=
ey for a box of=20

matches, and had made him bring back the money with another box to show how=
 much the=20

French appreciate the Americans coming to France. We met many instances lik=
e that.  Soon the=20

road was cluttered up with American soldiers. They were driving motors, wha=
cking mules,=20

stringing along the by-paths and sweating copiously under the autumn sun. W=
e wondered in=20

passing what an American farmer boy and his self-respecting mule thought of=
 the two-wheeled=20

French carts they were using. Then we turned the corner and came into a new=
 view; we saw our=20

first troop of American soldiers quartered in a French village. They were b=
usy building barracks.=20

We stopped and visited them, and they showed us their quarters: In barns, i=
n lofts of houses, in=20

cellars, in vacant stores--everywhere that human beings could slip in, the =
American soldiers had=20

installed themselves. The Y.M.C.A. hut was finished, and in it a score of b=
oys were writing letters,=20

playing rag-time on the pianos, and jollying the handsome, wise-looking Ame=
rican women at the=20

counter across one end of the room. An Irish Catholic padre in a major's un=
iform was in charge of=20

the sports of the camp and he literally permeated the Y.M.C.A. hut. He was =
the leader of the men.=20

The little village where this troop lived faded into the plain and we rode =
again for five miles or so,=20

and then came to another and another and still another. At that time thirte=
en villages in an arc of=20

forty miles or so contained most of our American troops. We stopped many ti=
mes on our long=20

day's journey. Once we stopped for mid-day dinner and there came to Henry a=
nd me our first=20

estrangement. It is curious, as the poet sings, "how light a thing may move=
 dissension between=20

hearts that love--hearts that the world in vain has tried and sorrow but mo=
re closely tied." Well--the=20

thing that came between us was cooking--cooking that has parted more soul m=
ates than any other=20

one thing in the world! For two weeks more or less we had been eating in th=
e French mess, or=20

eating at country hotels or country homes in France, eating good French cou=
ntry cooking, and it=20

was excellent. A mid-day meal typically was a melon, or a clear soup, or on=
ion soup, brown and=20

strong; a small bit of of the river was only 24 degrees (when the air was a=
t 25.6 degrees.) This is=20

nearly the temperature of the Rio Negro, but four or five degrees below tha=
t of the Orinoco. After=20

having passed on the west the mouth of the Cano Caterico, which has black w=
aters of=20

extraordinary transparency, we left the bed of the river, to land at an isl=
and on which the mission of=20

Vasiva is established. The lake which surrounds this mission is a league br=
oad, and=20

communicates by three outlets with the Cassiquiare. The surrounding country=
 abounds in marshes=20

which generate fever. The lake, the waters of which appear yellow by transm=
itted light, is dry in the=20

season of great heat, and the Indians themselves are unable to resist the m=
iasmata rising from the=20

mud. The complete absence of wind contributes to render the climate of this=
 country more=20

pernicious.  From the 14th to the 21st of May we slept constantly in the op=
en air; but I cannot=20

indicate the spots where we halted. These regions are so wild, and so littl=
e frequented, that with=20

the exception of a few rivers, the Indians were ignorant of the names of al=
l the objects which I set=20

by the compass. No observation of a star helped me to fix the latitude with=
in the space of a=20



degree. After having passed the point where the Itinivini separates from th=
e Cassiquiare, to take=20

its course to the west towards the granitic hills of Daripabo, we found the=
 marshy banks of the river=20

covered with bamboos. These arborescent gramina rise to the height of twent=
y feet; their stem is=20

constantly arched towards the summit. It is a new species of Bambusa with v=
ery broad leaves. M.=20

Bonpland fortunately found one in flower; a circumstance I mention, because=
 the genera Nastus=20

and Bambusa had before been very imperfectly distinguished, and nothing is =
more rare in the New=20

World, than to see these gigantic gramina in flower. N. Mutis herborised du=
ring twenty years in a=20

country where the Bambusa guadua forms marshy forests several leagues broad=
, without having=20

ever been able to procure the flowers. We sent that learned naturalist the =
first ears of Bambusa=20

from the temperate valleys of Popayan. It is strange that the parts of fruc=
tification should develop=20

themselves so rarely in a plant which is indigenous, and which vegetates wi=
th such extraordinary=20

rigour, from the level of the sea to the height of nine hundred toises, tha=
t is, to a subalpine region=20

the climate of which, between the tropics, resembles that of the south of S=
pain. The Bambusa=20

latifolia seems to be peculiar to the basins of the Upper Orinoco, the Cass=
iquiare, and the=20

Amazon; it is a social plant, like all the gramina of the family of the nas=
toides; but in that part of=20

Spanish Guiana which we traversed it does not grow in those large masses wh=
ich the Spanish=20

Americans call guadales, or forests of bamboos.  Our first resting-place ab=
ove Vasiva was easily=20

arranged. We found a little nook of dry ground, free from shrubs, to the so=
uth of the Cano=20

Curamuni, in a spot where we saw some capuchin monkeys.* (* Simia chiropote=
s.) They were=20

recognizable by their black beards and their gloomy and sullen air, and wer=
e walking slowly on the=20

horizontal branches of a genipa. During the five following nights our passa=
ge was the more=20

troublesome in proportion as we approached the bifurcation of the Orinoco. =
The luxuriance of the=20

vegetation increases in a manner of which it is difficult even for those ac=
quainted with the aspect=20

of the forests between the tropics, to form an idea. There is no longer a b=
ank: a palisade of tufted=20

trees forms the margin of the river. You see a canal two hundred toises bro=
ad, bordered by two=20

enormous walls, clothed with lianas and foliage. We often tried to land, bu=
t without success.=20

Towards sunset we sailed along for an hour seeking to discover, not an open=
ing (since none=20

exists), but a spot less wooded, where our Indians by means of the hatchet =
and manual labour,=20

could clear space enough for a resting-place for twelve or thirteen persons=
. It was impossible to=20

pass the night in the canoe; the mosquitos, which tormented us during the d=
ay, accumulated=20

toward evening beneath the toldo covered with palm-leaves, which served to =
shelter us from the=20

rain. Our hands and faces had never before been so much swelled. Father Zea=
, who had till then=20

boasted of having in his missions of the cataracts the largest and fiercest=
 (las mas feroces)=20

mosquitos, at length gradually acknowledged that the sting of the insects o=
f the Cassiquiare was=20

the most painful he had ever felt. We experienced great difficulty, amid a =
thick forest, in finding=20

wood to make a fire, the branches of the trees in those equatorial regions =
where it always rains,=20

being so full of sap, that they will scarcely burn. There being no bare sho=
re, it is hardly possible to=20

procure old wood, which the Indians call wood baked in the sun. However, fi=
re was necessary to=20

us only as a defence against the beasts of the forest; for we had such a sc=
arcity of provision that=20

we had little need of fuel for the purpose of preparing our food.  On the 1=
8th of May, towards=20

evening, we discovered a spot where wild cacao-trees were growing on the ba=
nk of the river. The=20

nut of these cacaos is small and bitter; the Indians of the forest suck the=
 pulp, and throw away the=20



nut, which is picked up by the Indians of the missions, and sold to persons=
 who are not very nice=20

in the preparation of their chocolate. "This is the Puerto del Cacao" (Caca=
o Port), said the pilot; "it=20

is here our Padres sleep, when they go to Esmeralda to buy sarbacans* (* Th=
e bamboo tubes=20

furnished by the Arundinaria, used for projecting the poisoned arrows of th=
e natives. See Views of=20

Nature page 180.) and juvias ( Brazil nuts). Not five boats, however, pass =
annually by the=20

Cassiquiare; and since we left Maypures (a whole month previously), we had =
not met one living=20

soul on the rivers we navigated, except in the immediate neighbourhood of t=
he missions. To the=20

south of lake Duractumuni we slept in a forest of palm-trees. It rained vio=
lently, but the pothoses,=20

arums, and lianas, furnished so thick a natural trellis, that we were shelt=
ered as under a vault of=20

foliage. The Indians whose hammocks were placed on the edge of the river, i=
nterwove the=20

heliconias and other musaceae, so as to form a kind of roof over them. Our =
fires lighted up, to the=20

height of fifty or sixty feet, the palm-trees, the lianas loaded with flowe=
rs, and the columns of white=20

smoke, which ascended in a straight line toward the sky. The whole exhibite=
d a magnificent=20

spectacle; but to have enjoyed it fully, we should have breathed an air cle=
ar of insects.  The most=20

depressing of all physical sufferings are those which are uniform in their =
duration, and can be=20

combated only by long=20


_
browned potatoes or carrots, a vegetable entree--peas, spinach, served dry =
and minced, or string=20

beans; then raw fruit, and cheese. The bread, of course, was black war brea=
d, but crusty and fine.=20

That was my idea of a lunch for the gods. What we got at the American mess =
was this: a thick,=20

frowsy, greasy soup--a kind of larded dishwater; thin steak fried hard as n=
ails, boiled beans with=20

fried bacon laid on the beans--not pork and beans, but called pork and bean=
s--with the beans=20

slithery and hard and underdone; lettuce, cabbage, and onions soused in vin=
egar, white bread cut=20

an inch thick, soft and spongy, boiled potatoes that had stood in the water=
 after they were cooked=20

done, and then bread pudding, made by pouring water on bread, sticking in s=
ome raisins, stirring=20

in an egg, and serving a floury syrup over it for sauce! There was enough, =
of course, to keep soul=20

and body together. But the cooking had spoiled a lot of mighty good food. A=
nd Henry liked it!=20

There were two preachers with us, and they bragged about the "good old Amer=
ican cooking!" And=20

when they heard me roar they said, "He is insulting the star-spangled banne=
r," and Henry=20

threatened to take my pajamas out of his black valise!  [Illustration: And =
he sat cross legged]  After=20

passing through many villages crowded with our troops we came to the headqu=
arters of the=20

American Expeditionary forces. We found General Pershing in a long brick bu=
ilding--two or three=20

stories high, facing a wide white parade ground. The place had been used ev=
idently as a barracks=20

for French soldiers in peace times, and was fitted to the uses of our army.=
 We met a member of=20

his staff, a sort of outer guard, and with scarcely a preliminary halt were=
 taken to the general. He=20

seems easy of access, which is a sign that he plays no favourites and has n=
o court. Anyone with=20

business can see him. He met us in a plain bare room with a square new Amer=
ican-looking desk=20

in the midst of it. He sat behind the desk, cordial enough but with the air=
 of one who will be=20

pleased to have business start, and politenesses stop. So we plunged straig=
ht to the business in=20

hand. We were from the American Red Cross in Paris, and our leader had come=
 to get a definite=20

idea of what part the Red Cross was to play in the recreation activities of=
 the army. The Y. M. C. A.=20

was spending millions upon recreation problems. The Red Cross had millions =
to spend.  It is=20

probable, that in the exhalations of the forests of the Cassiquiare M. Bonp=
land imbibed the seeds=20

of a severe malady, under which he nearly sunk on our arrival at Angostura.=
 Happily for him and=20

for me, nothing led us to presage the danger with which he was menaced. The=
 view of the river,=20

and the hum of the insects, were a little monotonous; but some remains of o=
ur natural=20

cheerfulness enabled us to find sources of relief during our wearisome pass=
age. We discovered,=20

that by eating small portions of dry cacao ground without sugar, and drinki=
ng a large quantity of=20

the river water, we succeeded in appeasing our appetite for several hours. =
The ants and the=20

mosquitos troubled us more than the humidity and the want of food. Notwiths=
tanding the privations=20

to which we were exposed during our excursions in the Cordilleras, the navi=
gation from=20

Mandavaca to Esmeralda has always appeared to us the most painful part of o=
ur travels in=20

America. I advise those who are not very desirous of seeing the great bifur=
cation of the Orinoco, to=20

take the way of the Atabapo in preference to that of the Cassiquiare.  Abov=
e the Cano=20

Duractumuni, the Cassiquiare pursues a uniform direction from north-east to=
 south-west. We were=20

surprised to see how much the high steep banks of the Cassiquiare had been =
undermined on=20

each side by the sudden risings of the water. Uprooted trees formed as it w=
ere natural rafts; and=20

being half-buried in the mud, they were extremely dangerous for canoes. We =
passed the night of=20

the 20th of May, the last of our passage on the Cassiquiare, near the point=
 of the bifurcation of the=20



Orinoco. We had some hope of being able to make an astronomical observation=
, as falling-stars of=20

remarkable magnitude were visible through the vapours that veiled the sky; =
whence we concluded=20

that the stratum of vapours must be very thin, since meteors of this kind h=
ave scarcely ever been=20

seen below a cloud. Those we now beheld shot towards the north, and succeed=
ed each other at=20

almost equal intervals. The Indians, who seldom ennoble by their expression=
s the wanderings of=20

the imagination, name the falling-stars the urine; and the dew the spittle =
of the stars. The clouds=20

thickened anew, and we discerned neither the meteors, nor the real stars, f=
or which we had=20

impatiently waited during several days.  We had been told, that we should f=
ind the insects at=20

Esmeralda still more cruel and=20


_
clubs, houses where American soldiers can go while in Paris on leave of abs=
ence. The Red Cross=20

had one single donation of one million dollars to be devoted to a club for =
American soldiers in=20

Paris. The Y. M. C. A had started to equip two or three great Parisian hote=
ls as clubs. The Red=20

Cross were going up; nevertheless we indulged the hope of at length sleepin=
g in a spot that was=20

inhabited, and of taking some exercise in herbalizing. This anticipation wa=
s, however, disturbed at=20

our last resting-place on the Cassiquiare. Whilst we were sleeping on the e=
dge of the forest, we=20

were=20


_
recreation purposes in camp. The Y. M. C. A. believed it should control the=
 camp and Parisian=20

recreation activities of the American troops.  We stated our case about as =
briefly as it is here=20

written, and in three minutes. In two minutes more General Pershing had ass=
ured us that there=20

would be no need to spend money for hotels or clubs in Paris, that few sold=
iers would be given=20

leave to go to Paris, and that the lavish expenditure of American money in =
Paris would be bad for=20

America's standing in France.  And then he allotted the recreation problems=
 of men in the=20

hospitals to the Red Cross, and the recreation enterprises for men outside =
of hospitals to the Y. M.=20

C. A.  He was brief, exact, candid and final. He stood for the most part, a=
s he talked; spoke low,=20

fumbled for no word, and looked into his hearers' eyes. The politician look=
s over their shoulders.=20

We spoke for two or three minutes with him about the work of our troops thi=
s winter, and were=20

impressed with the decision of the man. He seemed--perhaps subconsciously--=
afraid that public=20

opinion at home would demand that night, that they heard very near us the c=
ries of a jaguar.=20

These cries, they alleged, came from the top of some neighbouring trees. Su=
ch is the thickness of=20

the forests in these regions, that scarcely any animals are to be found the=
re but such as climb=20

trees; as, for instance, the monkeys, animals of the weasel tribe, jaguars,=
 and other species of the=20

genus Felis.  As our fires burnt brightly, we paid little attention to the =
cries of the jaguars. They had=20

been attracted by the smell and noise of our dog. This animal (which was of=
 the mastiff breed)=20

began at first to bark; and when the tiger drew nearer, to howl, hiding him=
self below our=20

hammocks. how great was our grief, when in the morning, at the moment of re=
-embarking, the=20

Indians informed us that the dog had disappeared! There could be no doubt t=
hat it had been=20

carried off by the jaguars.* (* See Views of Nature page 195.) Perhaps, whe=
n their cries had=20

ceased, it had wandered from the fires on the side of the beach; and possib=
ly we had not heard its=20

moans, as we were in a profound sleep. We have often heard the=20


_
own sector too early. He evidently believed that during our first winter th=
e men should go in by=20

squads and perhaps companies or later in regimental units for educational p=
urposes, working with=20

the English and the French learning the trench game. But we felt clearly th=
at he believed strongly=20

that it would be spring before we should occupy any portion of the line our=
selves. There was a=20

firmness about him, not expressed in words. No one could say that he had sa=
id what we thought=20

he had conveyed to us. Yet each of us was sure that the General would not b=
e moved from his=20

decision. He breathes confidence in him into people's hearts. He never seem=
s confidential; though=20

he is entirely candid. Again one feels sure that there is no court around h=
im. He seems wise with=20

his own wisdom, which is constantly in touch with the wisdom of everyone wh=
o may have business=20

with him. He will not be knocked off his feet; he will do no military stunt=
s. The American soldiers=20

will not go into action until we have enough troops to hold our part of the=
 line and we will not start=20

an offensive until we can back it up. This all came glowing out of the firm=
, kind, wise, soldierly face=20

of General Pershing, and it needed no words to verify it. Superfluous words=
 might have=20

contradicted the message of his mien; for they might have added boast to si=
mple statement.  It is=20

all so orderly, so organized, so American, this thing we are doing in Franc=
e. It is like the effective=20

manipulation of a great trust. The leadership of the American the Orinoco a=
nd the Rio Magdalena=20

affirm, that the oldest jaguars will carry off animals from the midst of a =
halting-place, cunningly=20

grasping them by the neck so as to prevent their cries. We waited part of t=
he morning, in the hope=20

that our dog had only strayed. Three days after we came back to the same pl=
ace; we heard again=20

the cries of the jaguars, for these animals have a predilection for particu=
lar spots; but all our=20

search was vain. The dog, which had accompanied us from Caracas, and had so=
 often in=20

swimming escaped the pursuit of the crocodiles,* had been devoured in the f=
orest. (* Ibid page=20

198.)  On the 21st May, we again entered the bed of the Orinoco, three leag=
ues below the mission=20

of Esmeralda. It was now a month since we had left that river near the mout=
h of the Guaviare. We=20

had still to proceed seven hundred and fifty miles* (* Of nine hundred and =
fifty toises each, or two=20

hundred and fifty nautical leagues.) before reaching Angostura, but we shou=
ld go with the stream;=20

and this consideration lessened our discouragement. In descending great riv=
ers, the rowers take=20

the middle of the current, where there are few mosquitos; but in ascending,=
 they are obliged, in=20

order to avail themselves of the dead waters and counter-currents, to sail =
near the shore, where=20

the proximity of the forests, and the remains of organic substances accumul=
ated on the beach,=20

harbour the tipulary insects. The point of the celebrated bifurcation of th=
e Orinoco has a very=20

imposing aspect. Lofty granitic mountains=20


_
and in the Red Cross and the Y. M. C. A. is made up of men known all over t=
he United States; the=20

names of those leaders who are soldiers may not be mentioned. They have dro=
pped out of=20

American civilian life so quietly that they are scarcely missed. Yet them a=
re discovered at a=20

distance the Maraguaca and the Duida. There are no mountains on the left ba=
nk of the Orinoco,=20

west or east of the bifurcation, till opposite the mouth of the Tamatama. O=
n that spot stands the=20

rock Guaraco, which is said to throw=20
