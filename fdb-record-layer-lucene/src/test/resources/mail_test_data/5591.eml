philodendron monstera of this interesting and important statement, the accu=
racy of which you yourself would for a moment dispute.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CW=
hat is there said about me at Mentana makes me doubt of all the rest,=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, we will not dwell on Mentana,=E2=80=9D sa=
id the cardinal, with a sweet philodendron monstera of this interesting and=
 important statement, the accuracy of which you yourself would for a moment=
 dispute.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat is there said about me at Mentana makes m=
e doubt of all the rest,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, we will not=
 dwell on Mentana,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, with a sweet _
and mat bags to convey the flesh. In half an hour at least three hundred Ar=
abs were on the spot;=20

the hippo had been hauled to shore by ropes, and, by the united efforts of =
the crowd, the heavy=20

carcase had been rolled to the edge of the water. Here the attack commenced=
; no pack of hungry=20

hyaenas could have been more savage. I gave them permission to take the fle=
sh, and in an instant=20

a hundred knives were at work: they fought over the spoil like wolves. No s=
ooner was the carcase=20

flayed than the struggle commenced for the meat; the people were a mass of =
blood, as some=20

stood thigh-deep in the reeking intestines wrestling for the fat, while man=
y hacked at each other's=20

hands for coveted portions that were striven for as a bonne bouche. I left =
the savage crowd in their=20

ferocious enjoyment of flesh and blood, and I returned to camp for breakfas=
t, my Turk, Hadji=20

Achmet, carrying some hippopotamus steaks.  That morning my wife and I brea=
kfasted upon our=20

first hippo, an animal that was destined to be our general food throughout =
our journey among the=20

Abyssinian tributaries of the Nile. After breakfast we strolled down to the=
 pool to search for the=20

hippopotamus No. 1. This we at once found, dead, as it had risen to the sur=
face, and was floating=20

like the back of a turtle a few inches above the water. The Arabs had been =
so intent upon the=20

division of their spoil that they had not observed their new prize; accordi=
ngly, upon the signal being=20

given, a general rush took place, and in half an hour a similar scene was e=
nacted to that of hippo=20

No. 2.  The entire Arab camp was in commotion and full of joy at this unloo=
ked-for arrival of flesh.=20

Camels laden with meat and hide toiled along the sandy bed of the river; th=
e women raised their=20

long and shrill cry of delight; and we were looked upon as general benefact=
ors for having brought=20

them a supply of good food in this season of distress. In the afternoon I a=
rranged my tackle, and=20

strolled down to the pool to fish. There was a difficulty in procuring bait=
; a worm was never heard=20

of in the burning deserts of Nubia, neither had I a net to catch small fish=
; I was therefore obliged to=20

bait with pieces of hippopotamnus. Fishing in such a pool as that of the At=
bara was sufficiently=20

exciting, as it was impossible to speculate upon what creature might accept=
 the invitation; but the=20

Arabs who accompanied me were particular in guarding me against the positio=
n I had taken under=20

a willow-bush close to the water, as they explained, that most probably a c=
rocodile would take me=20

instead of the bait; they declared that accidents had frequently happened w=
hen people had sat=20

upon the bank either to drink with their hands, or even while watching thei=
r goats. I accordingly=20

fished at a few feet distant from the margin, and presently I had a bite; I=
 landed a species of perch=20

about two pounds' weight; this was the "boulti," one of the best Nile fish =
mentioned by the traveller=20

Bruce. In a short time I had caught a respectable dish of fish, but hithert=
o no monster had paid me=20

the slightest attention; accordingly I changed my bait, and upon a powerful=
 hook, fitted upon=20

treble-twisted wire, I fastened an enticing strip of a boulti. The bait was=
 about four ounces, and=20

glistened like silver; the water was tolerably clear, but not too bright, a=
nd with such an attraction I=20

expected something heavy. My float was a large-sized pike-float for live ba=
it, and this civilized sign=20

had been only a few minutes in the wild waters of the Atbara, when, bob! an=
d away it went! I had a=20

very large reel, with nearly three hundred yards of line that had been spec=
ially made for monsters;=20

down went the top of my rod, as though a grindstone was suspended on it, an=
d, as I recovered its=20

position, away went the line, and the reel revolved, not with the sudden da=
sh of a spirited fish, but=20

with the steady determined pull of a trotting horse. What on earth have I g=
ot hold of? In a few=20

minutes about a hundred yards of line were out, and as the creature was ste=
adily but slowly=20

travelling down the centre of the channel, I determined to cry "halt!" if p=
ossible, as my tackle was=20



extremely strong, and my rod was a single bamboo. Accordingly, I put on a p=
owerful strain, which=20

was replied to by a sullen tug, a shake, and again my rod was pulled sudden=
ly down to the water's=20

edge. At length, after the roughest handling, I began to reel in slack line=
, as my unknown friend=20

had doubled in upon me; and upon once on angelic hearts, when he found hims=
elf in the embrace=20

of spirits of another sphere.  In what a position of unexampled pain did he=
 not now find himself! To=20

feel it your duty to quit the faith in which you have been bred must involv=
e an awful pang; but to be=20

a renegade without the consolation of conscience, against your sense, again=
st your will, alike for=20

no celestial hope and no earthly object=E2=80=94this was agony mixed with s=
elf-contempt.  He=20

remembered what Lady Corisande had once said to him about those who quitted=
 their native=20

church for the Roman communion. What would she say now? He marked in imagin=
ation the cloud=20

of sorrow on her imperial brow and the scorn of her curled lip.  Whatever h=
appened, he could=20

never return to England=E2=80=94at least for many years, when all the thing=
s and persons he cared for=20

would have disappeared or changed, which is worse; and then what would be t=
he use of=20

returning? He would go to America, or Australia, or the Indian Ocean, or th=
e interior of Africa; but=20

even in all these places, according to the correspondence of the Propaganda=
, he would find=20

Roman priests, and active priests. He felt himself a lost man; not free fro=
m faults in this matter, but=20

punished beyond his errors. But this is the fate of men who think they can =
struggle successfully=20

with a supernatural power.  A servant opened a door and said, in a loud voi=
ce, that, with his=20

permission, his eminence, the English cardinal, would wait on him.       CH=
APTER 68 It is=20

proverbial to what drowning men will cling. Lothair, in his utter hopelessn=
ess, made a distinction=20

between the cardinal and the conspirators. The cardinal had been absent fro=
m Rome during the=20

greater portion of the residence of Lothair in that city. The cardinal was =
his father=E2=80=99s friend, an=20

English gentleman, with an English education, once an Anglican, a man of th=
e world, a man of=20

honor, a good, kind-hearted man. Lothair explained the apparent and occasio=
nal cooperation of=20

his eminence with the others, by their making use of him without a due cons=
ciousness of their=20

purpose on his part. Lothair remembered how delicately his former guardian =
had always treated=20

the subject of religion in their conversations. The announcement of his vis=
it, instead of aggravating=20

the distresses of Lothair, seemed, as all these considerations rapidly occu=
rred to him, almost to=20

impart a ray of hope.  =E2=80=9CI see,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, as he en=
tered serene and graceful as usual, and=20

glancing at the table, =E2=80=9Cthat you have been reading the account of o=
ur great act of yesterday.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CYes; and I have been reading it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, reddening,=
 =E2=80=9Cwith indignation; with alarm; I should=20

add, with disgust.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow is this?=E2=80=9D said the cardin=
al, feeling or affecting surprise.  =E2=80=9CIt is a tissue of=20

falsehood and imposture,=E2=80=9D continued Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand I will ta=
ke care that my opinion is known of it.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CDo nothing rashly,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CThis is an=
 official journal, and I have reason to believe that=20

nothing appears in it which is not drawn up, or well considered, by truly p=
ious men.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou yourself,=20

sir, must know,=E2=80=9D continued Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthat the whole of this=
 statement is founded on falsehood.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CIndeed, I should be sorry to believe,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, =
=E2=80=9Cthat there was a particle of misstatement,=20

or even exaggeration, either in the base or the superstructure of the narra=
tive.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGood God!=E2=80=9D=20

exclaimed Lothair. =E2=80=9CWhy, take the very first allegation, that I fel=
l at Mentana, fighting in the ranks of=20

the Holy Father. Everyone knows that I fell fighting against him, and that =
I was almost slain by one=20

of his chassepots. It is notorious; and though, as a matter of taste, I hav=
e not obtruded the fact in=20

the society in which I have been recently living, I have never attempted to=
 conceal it, and have not=20



the slightest doubt that it must be as familiar to every member of that soc=
iety as to your=20

eminence.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI know there are two narratives of your relati=
ons with the battle of Mentana,=E2=80=9D=20

observed the cardinal, quietly. =E2=80=9CThe one accepted as authentic is t=
hat which appears in this=20

journal; the other account, which can only be traced to yourself, bears no =
doubt a somewhat=20

different character; but considering that it is in the highest degree impro=
bable, and that there is not=20

a tittle of confirmatory or collateral evidence to extenuate its absolute u=
nlikelihood, I hardly think=20

you are justified in using, with reference to the statement in this article=
, the harsh expression,=20

which I am persuaded, on=20


_
her, as it might be, I perceived a great swirl in the water, about twenty y=
ards from the rod. The=20

tackle would bear anything, and I strained so heavily upon my adversary, th=
at I soon reduced our=20

distance; but the water was exceedingly deep, the bank precipitous, and he =
was still invisible. At=20

length, after much tugging and counter-tugging, he began to show; eagerly I=
 gazed into the water=20

to examine my new acquaintance, when I made out something below, in shape b=
etween a coach-

wheel and a sponging-bath; in a few moments more I brought to the surface a=
n enormous turtle,=20

well hooked. I felt like the old lady who won an elephant in a lottery: tha=
t I had him was certain, but=20

hastily used.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with a kin=
dling eye and a burning cheek, =E2=80=9Cthat I am the best=20

judge of what I did at Mentana.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, well,=E2=80=9D sai=
d the cardinal, with dulcet calmness, =E2=80=9Cyou=20

naturally think so; but you must remember you have been very ill, my dear y=
oung friend, and=20

laboring under much excitement. If I were you=E2=80=94and I speak as your f=
riend, I hope your best=20

one=E2=80=94I would not dwell too much on this fancy of yours about the bat=
tle of Mentana. I would myself=20

always deal tenderly with a fixed idea: harsh attempts to terminate halluci=
nation are seldom=20

successful. Nevertheless, in the case of a public event, a matter of fact, =
if a man finds that he is of=20

one=20


_
I to do with my prize? It was at the least a hundred pounds' weight, and th=
e bank was steep and=20

covered with bushes; thus it was impossible to land the monster, that now t=
ugged and dived with=20

the determination of the grindstone that his first pull had suggested. Once=
 I attempted the gaff but=20

the trusty weapon that had landed many a fish in Scotland broke in the hard=
 orders of society of=20

another, he should not be encouraged to dwell on a perverted view; he shoul=
d be gradually=20

weaned from it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou amaze me!=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =
=E2=80=9CNot at all,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CI am sure you wil=
