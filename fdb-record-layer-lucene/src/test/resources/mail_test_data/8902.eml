that is to say the most of them; those which are bad should be       abolis=

and application of the Gospel is the       best means for effecting this. 2=
8.28. The Devil himself=20

could not have worked greater harm than have the       Spaniards, by their =
tyranny and cruel=20

greed; they have treated the       Indians like beasts, worked them to deat=

who       have wished to learn from the friars, even more than others. 29.2=

the Indians in encomienda and repartimiento is       absolutely contrary to=
 the royal commands=20

issued by Queen Isabella       to Columbus and his successors during her re=
ign.  The Queen=20

ordered       all Indians who had been brought to Spain as slaves, to be se=
nt back       and set free.=20

What would she think could she but witness the       present state of thing=
s?  The present=20

sovereign has been kept in       ignorance of the true condition, and his l=
ong journeys and=20

absences       have prevented him from informing himself. 30.30. It follows=
, therefore, from these=20

propositions that all the       conquests, acquisitions of territory, invas=
ions, and usurpations,=20

whether by the Crown officials or by the colonists and individuals,       a=
re illegal, because all have=20

been accomplished contrary to the       orders of the Spanish sovereigns an=
d in defiance of their=20

authority.       (68)  Without pausing to examine the origin or trace the d=
evelopment of the papal=20

claim to dispose of the western hemisphere, which Las Casas admits in these=
 Thirty Propositions,=20

50 minutes, and the=20

Sidereal day is 23 hours 56 minutes.  Apparent Solar Time is shown by the s=
undial, and therefore=20

depends upon the motion of the sun. Mean Solar Time is shown by a correct c=
lock. The difference=20

between Mean Time and Apparent Time, that is, between the time shown by the=
 clock and the=20

sundial, is called the Equation of Time, and in the _Nautical Almanack_, a =
Government=20

publication, there are tables showing these differences.  =3DDay and Night.=
=3D--Obviously the hours of=20

darkness offered a greater problem to the horologist than the hours of ligh=
t. His sundial was of no=20

use at night and of little use on cloudy days. The hour-glass was not a pie=
ce of mechanism a man=20

would wish to employ to record the night watches. Some other self-acting me=
chanism had to be=20

devised.  The interval between sunset and sunset, or sunrise and sunrise, o=
r noon and noon, was=20

divided by the Babylonians, who had a love for the duodenary system, into t=
wenty-four hours. It is=20

curious to read that "until the eighteenth century in England the hour was =
commonly reckoned as=20

the twelfth part of the time between sunrise and sunset, or between sunset =
and sunrise, and=20

hence was of varying durations" (_Webster's New International Dictionary_, =
1914).  The hour was=20

further divided, also by the Babylonians, into periods of sixty minutes. It=
 was the Babylonians who=20

first divided the circle into 360 degrees, and Ptolemy followed this divisi=
on.  The dial of a clock was=20

at first termed the _hour-plate_, as only hours were engraved upon it and o=
nly one hand was=20

employed. Later, another hand was added, the minute hand, which travelled a=
 complete circuit=20

while the hour hand was travelling between two hour numerals. Later, again,=
 a new sub-dial was=20

added, and a seconds hand recorded the sixty seconds which made the minute.=
 The term=20

"second" was at first called "second-minute," denoting that it was the seco=
nd division=20

VI. made no unusual exercise of his prerogative in so doing, nor was there =
anybody, whether=20

philosopher, jurist, or statesman, who, at that time, contested his pretens=
ion; arguments which Las=20

Casas presented as almost axiomatic are now obsolete, and of interest merel=
y as illustrating the=20

political doctrines of his times.  He was, perhaps, the first to limit the =
exercise of the papal power=20

by describing it as conditional, and in denying that the bull gave the sove=
reigns of Castile any=20

property rights in the New World.  According to his doctrines, the Pope was=
 exercising his purely=20

spiritual power.  Charged by the Founder of Christianity with the obligatio=
n to cause the Gospel to=20

be preached to every creature, he might delegate to the sovereign of his ch=
oice the right, or rather=20

the duty of sending his subjects to convert the heathen within a prescribed=
 portion of the Indies--

but for no other purpose.  Equally clear is the limitation he places to the=
 action of the prince.  The=20

latter receives no authorisation from the Pope to invade, occupy, or govern=
 territory in America.=20

His mission is exclusively religious, and any advantage accruing to himself=
 must be merely=20

incidental.  Since he may not rightfully use force to establish his rule ov=
er the Indians, the rights of=20

sixty. The learned John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, that extraordinary old =
savant, writes in 1650:=20

"Four flames of an equal magnitude will be kept alive the space of sixteen =
_second-minutes_,=20

though one of these flames alone, in the same vessel, will not last at most=
 above twenty-five or=20

thirty seconds."  These dry facts may serve to whet the curiosity of the st=
udent in regard to the=20

measurement of time and its origin. They add a piquancy to the clock dial a=
s we now know it.=20

Scientific it is, as one of man's most exact recorders of natural phenomena=
. That an exact=20

timekeeper should be found in the pocket of every schoolboy would seem an a=
stounding miracle=20

to our ancestors two hundred years ago, or even less than a hundred years a=
go:      'Tis with our=20

judgments as our watches, none     Go just alike, yet each believes his own=
,  writes Pope in his=20

_Essay on Criticism_ in 1725.  This is a damning indictment of the accuracy=
 of watches in the=20

early eighteenth century, but Dickens in _Dombey and Son_ suggests equally =
faulty mechanism=20

not in true accord with the mean solar day:  "Wal'r ... a parting gift, my =
lad. Put it back half an hour=20

every morning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon, and it's a =
watch that'll do you=20

credit."  That the civil day has taken precedence=20


_
by the Bull, only become effective in cases where the native rulers, after =
their conversion,=20

voluntarily acknowledge them.  In these definitions, Las Casas had gone far=
, but his adversaries=20

despite their subtlety were impotent either to force or inveigle him into a=
 position, where even the=20

recent legislation in regard to Summer Time. "The Sabbath was made for man =
and not man for the=20

Sabbath," may be applied to the clock dial. By an Act of Parliament, in spi=
te of science and the=20

earth's revolution on its axis, the hands straightway mean something else. =
