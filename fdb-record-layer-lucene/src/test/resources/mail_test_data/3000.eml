We are by the side of a free moorland water, gliding and gurgling and whisp=

bed of rugged and weeded crags, with trees that make a chequered network of=
 the sunlight. It is a=20

paradise of coolness and peace, where there are mossy boulders on which we =
can rest, or=20

couches of fern and turf on which we can lie. The constant yet changeful mu=
