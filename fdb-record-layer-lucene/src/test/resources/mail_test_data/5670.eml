CHAPTER XI  HIGHER EDUCATION   The development of the schools and churches =
established=20

for these transplanted freedmen made more necessary than ever a higher educ=
ation to develop in=20

them the power to work out their own salvation. It was again the day of tho=
rough training for the=20

Negroes. Their opportunities for better instruction were offered mainly by =
the colonizationists and=20

abolitionists.[1] Although these workers had radically different views as t=
o the manner of elevating=20

the colored people, they contributed much to their mental development. The =
more liberal=20

colonizationists endeavored to furnish free persons of color the facilities=
 for higher education with=20

the hope that their enlightenment would make them so discontented with this=
 country that they=20

would emigrate to Liberia. Most southern colonizationists accepted this pla=
n but felt that those=20

permanently attached to this country should be kept in ignorance; for if th=
ey were enlightened,=20

they would either be freed or exterminated. During the period of reaction, =
when the elevation of the=20

race was discouraged in the North and prohibited in most parts of the South=
, the colonizationists=20

continued to secure to Negroes, desiring to expatriate themselves, opportun=
ities for education=20

which never would have been given those expecting to remain in the United S=
tates.[2]  [Footnote=20

1: The views of the abolitionists at that time were well expressed by Garri=
son in his address to the=20

people of color in the convention assembled in Philadelphia in 1830. He enc=
ouraged them to get=20

as much education as possible for themselves and their offspring, to toil l=
ong and hard for it as for=20

a pearl of great price. "An ignorant people," said he, "can never occupy an=
y other than a degraded=20

place in society; they can never be truly free until they are intelligent. =
It is an old maxim that=20

knowledge is power; and not only is it power but rank, wealth, dignity, and=
 protection. That capital=20

brings highest return to a city, state, or nation (as the case may be) whic=
h is invested in schools,=20

academies, and colleges. If I had children, rather than that they should gr=
ow up in ignorance, I=20

would feed upon bread and water: I would sell my teeth, or extract the bloo=
d from my veins." See=20

_Minutes of the Proceedings of the Convention for the Improvement of the Fr=
ee People of Color_,=20

1830, pages 10, 11.]  [Footnote 2: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._=
, 1871, pp. 213-214;=20

and _The African Repository_, under the captions of "Education in Liberia,"=
 and "African=20

Education Societies," _passim_.]  The policy of promoters of African coloni=
zation, however, did not=20

immediately become unprogressive. Their plan of education differed from pre=
vious efforts in that=20

the objects of their philanthropy were to be given every opportunity for me=
ntal growth. The=20

colonizationists had learned from experience in educating Negroes that it w=
as necessary to begin=20

with the youth.[1] These workers observed, too, that the exigencies of the =
time demanded more=20

advanced and better endowed institutions to prepare colored men to instruct=
 others in science and=20

religion, and to fit them for "civil offices in Liberia and Hayti."[2] To e=
xecute this scheme the=20

leaders of the colonization movement endeavored to educate Negroes in "mech=
anic arts,=20

agriculture, science, and Biblical literature."[3] Exceptionally bright you=
ths were to be given special=20

training as catechists, teachers, preachers, and physicians.[4] A southern =
planter offered a=20

plantation for the establishment of a suitable institution of learning,[5] =
a few masters sent their=20



slaves to eastern schools to be educated, and men organized "education soci=
eties" in various=20

parts to carry out this work at shorter range. In 1817 colonizationists ope=
ned at Pasippany, New=20

Jersey, a school to give a four-year course to "African youth" who showed "=
talent, discretion, and=20

piety" and were able to read and write.[6] Twelve years later another effor=
t was made to establish=20

a school of this kind at Newark in that State,[7] while other promoters of =
that faith were=20

endeavoring to establish a similar institution at Hartford, Connecticut,[8]=
 all hoping to make use of=20

the Kosciuszko fund.[9]  [Footnote 1: _African Repository_, vol. i., p. 277=
.]  [Footnote 2: _African=20

Repository_, vol. ii., p. 223.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vol. xxviii., pp. 27=
1, 347; Child, _An Appeal_, p.=20

144.]  [Footnote 4: _African Repository_, vol. i., p. 277.]  [Footnote 5: _=
Report of the Proceedings=20

at the Organization of the African Education Society_, p. 9.]  [Footnote 6:=

frican Repository_, vol. iv.,=20

Education Society_, p. 7.]  [Footnote 8: _Ibid_., pp. 7 and 8 and _African =
Repository_, vol. iv., p.=20

375.]  [Footnote 9: What would become of this plan depended upon the changi=
ng fortunes of the=20

men concerned. Kosciuszko died in 1817; and as Thomas Jefferson refused to =
take out letters=20

testamentary under this will, Benjamin Lincoln Lear, a trustee of the Afric=
an Education Society,=20

who intended to apply for the whole fund, was appointed administrator of it=
. The fund amounted to=20

about $16,000. Later Kosciuszko Armstrong demanded of the administrator tur=
ned to look his last=20

upon the brown cottages of Nicolofsky, he could scarcely see them through h=
is tears.  =E2=80=9CBut the=20

winds of the morn blew away the tear.=E2=80=9D By-and-by Ivan cheered up a =
little. He roused himself to=20

listen to his companion=E2=80=99s stories of the great city, and began to b=
e interested, and even to ask=20

questions.  There was not much in the incidents of their journey to engage =
or rivet his attention.=20

They crossed the Oka upon a raft--horse, kibitka, and all--but not at the s=
pot so well remembered=20

by Ivan as the scene of his adventure. After that came the long monotonous =
Moscow road, where=20

everything seemed to Ivan always the same. Only that his senses assured him=
 he was moving,=20

and that rapidly, he would have fancied himself fixed in the centre of the =
same horizon, which was=20

revolving around him eternally and unchangingly. Plains of sand, forests of=
 birch or pine, went by=20

in endless succession, merely diversified here and there by some pasture la=
nds, or by a brown=20

village built upon the pattern of Nicolofsky. On one occasion, however, the=
y passed a company of=20

horsemen carrying long lances, and clad in gray cloaks, with ample hoods dr=
awn over their heads.=20

=E2=80=9CWho are these?=E2=80=9D Ivan asked with interest.  =E2=80=9CCossac=
ks. I suppose they are going to join the army.=20

They had better have stayed at home now that peace is being made with the F=
rench. That unlucky=20

peace!=E2=80=9D he grumbled, touching his horse rather unnecessarily with h=
is long whip.  =E2=80=9CWhy do you say=20

that? I thought peace was always a good thing. We have a proverb in Nicolof=
sky, =E2=80=98A bad peace is=20

better than a good quarrel.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA bad peace with yo=
ur enemies sometimes means a worse quarrel=20

with your best friends.--On, my little pope! Now, now, my beauty, my darlin=
g, mind what you are=20

about. Gee up, you barbarian!=E2=80=9D This to his horse, the wheel of the =
kibitka having stuck fast in a=20

deep rut. A touch of the whip, this time in earnest, and the horse bounded =
on, freeing the wheel=20

with a jolt that brought Ivan to his feet, and shook peace and war alike ou=
t of his thoughts. But=20

Petrovitch, more accustomed to the ordinary incidents of travel, presently =
resumed the thread of=20

his discourse.  =E2=80=9CWhat does peace with France mean? War with England=
, for one thing. And that--

what does that mean? Our ports shut up, our trade destroyed. No market for =
our timber, our corn,=20



our tallow, our furs. Ruin, ruin!=E2=80=9D groaned the merchant.  =E2=80=9C=
I have heard of France,=E2=80=9D said Ivan. =E2=80=9CBut=20

England--what is that?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEngland is a great, rich, beautif=
ul country, with the sea like a wall of=20

defence built by the hand of God all around it. The King of England hates N=
apoleon, and has=20

sworn before the picture of his saint never to make peace with him.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI have heard of Napoleon=20

too,=E2=80=9D said Ivan. =E2=80=9CThe recruits who left our village said th=
ey were going to fight against him. Pope=20

Nikita thinks he is a magician.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPope Nikita thinks truly=
. It is said he has for his wife a beautiful=20

lady named Josephine, who transforms herself at will into the likeness of a=
 white dove, flies into=20

the midst of his enemies, hears all they say, and comes back and tells her =
lord.[10] No one can=20

resist him; the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia are both at his =
feet, and he has=20

conquered all the other kings and dukes of the Nyemtzi, except the King of =
England.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the=20

Czar--why does not the Czar send his soldiers and tell them to kill him?=E2=
=80=9D queried Ivan.  =E2=80=9CNot so=20

easy!=E2=80=9D Petrovitch answered with a short laugh. =E2=80=9CHowever, th=
ere is little to be said after all. Russia=20

has fought him long and well. If the devil helps his own, what can good ort=
hodox Christians do?=20

Think of Austerlitz, Eylau, Friedland--blood and tears have flowed in torre=
nts. I know a widow who=20

lost her two sons at Austerlitz. Another;--but why speak of these things? W=
ar is always terrible.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThen why don=E2=80=99t you wish for peace?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA _g=
ood_ peace might be very desirable, but save us from=20

a peace that will ruin our commerce!=E2=80=9D cried Petrovitch with energy.=
 =E2=80=9CThe Czar has evil counsellors=20

around him who are persuading him to that sort of peace. Perhaps, indeed, N=
apoleon has=20

bewitched him with his sorceries. Who knows?=E2=80=9D  Having thus uttered,=
 not merely his own=20

sentiments, but those of Moscow and her merchants upon the subject of the T=
reaty of Tilsit, at that=20

time in progress, Petrovitch relapsed into silence. The only part of his di=
scourse that greatly=20

impressed Ivan happened also to be the only part of it which had not at lea=
st a considerable=20

substratum of truth--the story of the beautiful lady who could transform he=
rself into a white dove.=20

The rest he understood very partially.  After a journey of many days, a hap=
py change came over=20

the spirit of what had almost seemed to Ivan a long and dismal dream. The d=
reary expanse of=20

sandy waste was succeeded by a green, fertile, well-cultivated plain, diver=
sified by the gentle=20

slope of wooded hills and the gleam of a winding river.  At last, one eveni=
ng, they reached the=20

summit of a lofty eminence. Petrovitch, who was on foot leading the horse, =
turned suddenly to=20

Ivan, and said in a tone of solemnity, =E2=80=9CTake off thy cap, Ivan Barr=
inka, take off thy cap, and thank=20

God for thy first sight of holy Moscow!=E2=80=9D  Any traveller might have =
thanked God for the beauty of=20

that sight. Dome and cupola, minaret and tower, shone beneath them in the e=
vening sunshine,=20

giving back its rays with dazzling brightness from their gilded tops; and s=
ome there were which=20

flamed like balls of fire suspended in the air. The brightest and most vari=
ed of colours--green,=20

purple, crimson, blue--relieved and diversified the gleaming gold of the cu=
polas and the burnished=20

lead of the roofs, which looked like silver. Beyond the bewildering glories=
 of the Kremlin, whose=20

feet were kissed by the bright waters of the winding Moskva, the great city=
 stretched away into=20


_
in a will alleged to have been executed in Paris in 1806. The bill was dism=
issed by the Circuit=20

Court of the District of Columbia, and the decision of the lower Court was =
confirmed by the United=20

States Supreme Court in 1827 on the grounds that the said will had not been=
 admitted to probate=20

anywhere. To make things still darker just about the time the trustees of t=
he African Education=20

Society were planning to purchase a farm and select teachers and mechanics =
to instruct the=20

youth, the heirs of General Kosciuszko filed a bill against Mr. Lear in the=
 Supreme Court of the=20

United States on the ground of the invalidity of the will executed by Kosci=
uszko in 1798. The death=20

of Mr. Lear in 1832 and that of William Wirt, the Attorney-General of the U=
nited States, soon=20

thereafter, caused a delay in having the case decided. The author does not =
know exactly what use=20

was finally made of this fund. See _African Repository_, vol. it., pp. 163,=
 233; also 7 Peters, 130,=20

and 8 Peters, 52.]  The schemes failed, however, on account of the unyieldi=
ng opposition of the=20

free Negroes and abolitionists. They could see no philanthropy in educating=
 persons to prepare for=20

doom in a deadly climate. The convention of the free people of color assemb=
led in Philadelphia in=20

1830, denounced the colonization movement as an evil, and urged their fello=
ws not to support it.=20

Pointing out the impracticability of such schemes, the convention encourage=
d the race to take=20

steps toward its elevation in this country.[1] Should the colored people be=
 properly educated, the=20

prejudice against them would not continue such as to necessitate their expa=
triation. The delegates=20

hoped to establish a Manual Labor College at New Haven that Negroes might t=
here acquire that=20

"classical knowledge which promotes genius and causes man to soar up to tho=
se high intellectual=20

enjoyments and acquirements which place him in a situation to shed upon a c=
ountry and people=20

that scientific grandeur which is imperishable by time, and drowns in obliv=
ion's cup their moral=20

degradation."[2]  [Footnote 1: Williams, _History of the Negro Race_, p. 67=
.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid._,=20

p. 68; and _Minutes of the Proceedings of the Third Convention for the Impr=
ovement of the Free=20

People of Color_, pp. 9, 10, and 11.]  Influential abolitionists were also =
attacking this policy of the=20

colonizationists. William Jay, however, delivered against them such diatrib=
es and so wisely=20

exposed their follies that the advocates of colonization learned to conside=
r him as the arch enemy=20

of their cause.[1] Jay advocated the education of the Negroes for living wh=
ere they were. He could=20

not see how a Christian could prohibit or condition the education of any in=
dividual. To do such a=20

thing was tantamount to preventing him from having a direct revelation of G=
od. How these=20

"educators" could argue that on account of the hopelessness of the endeavor=
s to civilize the=20

blacks they should be removed to a foreign country, and at the same time un=
dertake to provide for=20

them there the same facilities for higher education that white men enjoyed,=
 seemed to Jay to be=20

facetiously inconsistent.[2] If the Africans could be elevated in their nat=
ive land and not in America,=20

it was due to the Caucasians' sinful condition, for which the colored peopl=
e should not be required=20

to suffer the penalty of expatriation.[3] The desirable thing to do was to =
influence churches and=20

schools to admit students of color on terms of equality with all other race=
s.  [Footnote 1: Reese,=20

_Letters to Honorable William Jay._]  [Footnote 2: Jay, _Inquiry_, p. 26; a=
nd _Letters_, p. 21.]=20

[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, p. 22.]  Encountering this opposition, the institutio=
ns projected by the=20

colonization society existed in name only. Exactly how and why the organiza=
tion failed to make=20

good with its educational policy is well brought out by the wailing cry of =
one of its promoters. He=20

asserted that "every endeavor to divert the attention of the community or e=
ven a portion of the=20

means which the present so imperatively calls for, from the colonization so=
ciety to measures=20



calculated to bind the colored population to this country and seeking to ra=
ise them to a level with=20

the whites, whether by founding colleges or in any other way, tends directl=
y in the proportion that it=20

succeeds, to counteract and thwart the whole plan of colonization."[1] The =
colonizationists,=20

therefore, desisted from their attempt to provide higher education for any =
considerable number of=20

the belated race. Seeing that they could not count on the support of the fr=
ee persons of color, they=20

feared that those thus educated would be induced by the abolitionists to re=
main in the United=20

States. This would put the colonizationists in the position of increasing t=
he intelligent element of=20

the colored population, which was then regarded as a menace to slavery. Con=
sequently these=20

timorous "educators" did practically nothing during the reactionary period =
to carry out their plan of=20

establishing colleges.  [Footnote 1: Hodgkin, _Inquiry into the Merits of t=
he Am. Col. Soc._, p. 31.]=20

Thereafter the colonizationists found it advisable to restrict their effort=
s to individual cases. Not=20

much was said about what they were doing, but now and then appeared notices=
 of Negroes who=20

had been privately prepared in the South or publicly in the North for profe=
ssional work in Liberia.=20

Dr. William Taylor and Dr. Fleet were thus educated in medicine in the Dist=
rict of Columbia.[1] In=20

the same way John V. DeGrasse, of New York, and Thomas J. White,[2] of Broo=
klyn, were=20

allowed to complete the Medical Course at Bowdoin in 1849. Garrison Draper,=
 who had acquired=20

his literary education at Dartmouth, studied law in Baltimore under friends=
 of the colonization=20

cause, and with a view to going to Liberia passed the examination of the Ma=
ryland Bar in 1857.[3]=20

In 1858 the Berkshire Medical School graduated two colored doctors, who wer=
e gratuitously=20

educated by the American Colonization Society. The graduating class thinned=
 out, however, and=20

one of the professors resigned because of their attendance.[4]  [Footnote 1=
: _Special Report of the=20

U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, and _African Repository_, vol. x., p. 10.]  [Footn=
ote 2: _Niles Register_,=20

vol. lxxv., p. 384.]  [Footnote 3: _African Repository_, vol. xxxiv., pp. 2=
6 and 27.]  [Footnote 4:=20

_Ibid._, p. 30.]  Not all colonizationists, however, had submitted to this =
policy of mere individual=20

preparation of those emigrating to Liberia. Certain of their organizations =
still believed that it was=20

only through educating the free people of color sufficiently to see their h=
umiliation that a large=20

number of them could be induced to leave this country. As long as they were=
 unable to enjoy the=20

finer things of life, they could not be expected to appreciate the value an=
d use of liberty. It was=20

argued that instead of remaining in this country to wage war on its institu=
tions, the highly=20

enlightened Negroes would be glad to go to a foreign land.[1] By this argum=
ent some=20

colonizationists were induced to do more for the general education of the f=
ree blacks than they=20

had considered it wise to do during the time of the bold attempts at servil=
e insurrection.[2] In fact,=20

many of the colored schools of the free States were supported by ardent col=
onizationists.=20

[Footnote 1: Boone, _The History of Education in Indiana_, p. 237; and _Afr=
ican Repository_, vol.=20

xxx., p. 195.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 195.]   The later plan of most col=
onizationists, however, was=20

to educate the emigrating Negroes after they settled in Liberia. Handsome s=
ums were given for=20

the establishment of schools and colleges in which professorships were endo=
wed for men=20

educated at the expense of churches and colonization societies.[1] The firs=
t institution of=20

consequence in this field was the Alexander High School. To streets and squ=
ares and gardens,=20

he gazed like one entranced on the scene before him.  =E2=80=9CUpon God=E2=

PETROVITCH.    =E2=80=9COh, but soon ye read in stories     Of the men of l=
ong ago;   And the pale,=20

bewildering glories     Shining farther than ye know.=E2=80=9D   Our travel=
lers had still a long drive before=20

them after they entered the stately gate called =E2=80=9Cthe Gate of Triump=
h.=E2=80=9D The ancient capital of the=20

Czars enclosed, within the vast circumference of its painted walls, gardens=
, orchards, terraces,=20

even parks and pleasure-grounds, in this as in other ways resembling an Eas=
tern city. In due time,=20

however, the merchants=E2=80=99 quarter was reached, and Ivan Petrovitch dr=
ew rein before the gateway=20

of a long, low, wooden building, or rather range of buildings, painted in v=
arious colours. He was=20

evidently expected and watched for; quite a crowd of men, women, and childr=
en, servants or=20

members of the family, hurried out to meet him, and his young companion sha=
red the welcome=20

and the greetings that followed. Ivan Petrovitch, however, took him by the =
hand, saying to those=20

who were pressing around them, =E2=80=9CStand back, brothers and sisters; n=
o one should speak to the=20

little lord until he has been presented to our father.=E2=80=9D  He led Iva=
n into a spacious room or hall, of=20

which the furniture, though far from answering to Western ideas of comfort,=
 showed conclusively=20

that wealth was not lacking, for vessels of silver, rugs of costly fur, and=
 rich Turkish carpets were=20

there in abundance. But Ivan scarcely noticed anything, except the great ar=
m-chair at the upper=20

end and the venerable figure of its occupant. =E2=80=9CMy father,=E2=80=9D =
said the younger Petrovitch, as he gently=20

placed the boy directly in front of him, =E2=80=9CI have brought thee our l=
ittle lord.=E2=80=9D  The old man rose slowly=20

from his chair, leaning upon his staff. His hair was white as snow, and so =
was the beard which=20

reached nearly down to his waist. His large, dark eyes, once so full of fir=
e, were dim with age, but=20

an ardent soul glanced forth from them even yet, and they had, moreover, a =
wistful, pathetic look,=20

as if seeking the light which was fading from them. =E2=80=9CGod be graciou=
s to thee, Prince Ivan=20

Ivanovitch Pojarsky,=E2=80=9D he said solemnly, laying his hand on the youn=
g fair head which was bowed=20

before him in instinctive reverence. Then he kissed the boy, and having sea=
ted himself once more=20

in his chair, drew him close and examined his features. =E2=80=9CLike his g=
randfather, my dear friend and=20

master,=E2=80=9D he said at last.  It was evident, from the silence which f=
ollowed, that thoughts of other=20

days came crowding fast upon the old man=E2=80=99s memory. But he soon arou=
sed himself from his=20

reverie to bid Ivan welcome to Moscow, and to commend him to the care of th=
e members of his=20

family who had gathered around them.  These now came forward, drew Ivan gen=
tly away, and=20

lavished upon him every kindness and attention that could be devised. He wa=
s charmed with his=20

new friends, and quickly and easily took his place as the honoured guest of=
 the great=20

heterogeneous household united beneath the roof of its venerable head. Ther=
e were sons and=20

sons=E2=80=99 sons, daughters-in-law and grand-daughters, and quite a tribe=
 of servants, forming=20

altogether a little clan rather than a family. This large household had all=
 the necessaries of life in=20

abundance, and many of its luxuries, though only such as the old Muscovite =
manners and=20

traditions fully sanctioned. For Petrovitch was an autocrat in his own hous=
e, though usually a just=20

and generous one. Woe to the son or grandson of his who should presume to =
=E2=80=9Cdeface the image=20



of God=E2=80=9D by shaving his beard, to exchange his caftan for a French p=
alet=C3=B4t, or to lose his roubles=20

and peril his soul at the fashionable game of loto! This strong personal go=
vernment was the secret=20

of the domestic peace which, on the whole, prevailed in the household, notw=
ithstanding the many=20

different elements of which it was composed.  There was only one person who=
 ventured to take=20

liberties with the patriarch--to tease him, coax him, sometimes even jest w=
ith him, always to claim=20

his caresses as a matter of right, not, like the others, as a rare, occasio=
nal favour. This was little=20

Feodor, a bright, black-eyed boy about three years younger than Ivan. The m=
other of this favourite=20

grandson had been the only daughter of Petrovitch, and she was dead. Much o=
f the old man=E2=80=99s=20

heart was in the grave with her, nor could his seven brave and prosperous s=
ons wholly supply her=20

place.  Ivan=E2=80=99s first days in Moscow were spent in viewing its wonde=
rs, under the guidance of one=20

or other of the Petrovitch family. Feodor was often with him, and soon beca=
me his particular friend;=20

for his playfellows at Nicolofsky having been dull and slow, the overflowin=
g merriment of his new=20

acquaintance was a welcome change. He was shown the marvels of the Kremlin,=
--its palace, its=20

three cathedrals, its bell-tower of Ivan Veliki, to the top of which he asc=
ended and beheld the=20

panorama of the city stretched out beneath him like a picture. He saw also =
the great Cathedral of=20

St. Basil, in the =E2=80=9CBeautiful=E2=80=9D Place outside the Kremlin wal=
l. He saw the Chinese city and the=20

dwellings of the Tartars; he wandered through the streets and rows of the G=
rand Bazaar. In fact,=20

he saw so many wonderful things that his power of wondering was exhausted, =
and he soon=20

ceased to be much impressed by any of them.  Each time that he returned fro=
m one of these=20

expeditions, old Petrovitch would call him to his side, and make him sit wh=
ere he could see his=20

face. One evening he said to him, =E2=80=9CGod make thee as brave and true =
as thine ancestor, the great=20

Prince Pojarsky, who delivered Moscow from the Poles.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWh=
o was he? I have never heard of=20

him,=E2=80=9D said Ivan.  =E2=80=9CIs that possible? Poor child! did no one=
 ever tell thee that story, so glorious for=20

thee and thine? Know, then, that about two hundred years ago the Poles conq=
uered holy Russia.=20

The whole country was at their feet, in great misery and trouble, and no ma=
n dared resist them.=20

Prince Pojarsky lay on his bed in his own castle, sick as it seemed unto de=
ath. But God put it into=20

the heart of a poor man working at his trade in Moscow, a butcher named Min=
im, to save his=20

country. He first went to all the great people of the city and of the surro=
unding country, and got=20

them to promise men and money. Then he went to Prince Pojarsky, and stood b=
efore him like a=20

messenger from God. =E2=80=98Rise,=E2=80=99 he said; =E2=80=98go forth and =
conquer the Poles. God will strengthen thee.=E2=80=99=20

=E2=80=98But soldiers are needed, and arms,=E2=80=99 said the prince. =E2=
=80=98All are ready,=E2=80=99 answered the courageous=20

citizen. The prince arose from his bed of sickness, and, trusting in God, p=
ut himself at the head of=20

the men of Moscow. He gained a glorious victory, and the sword of the Poles=
 was broken for ever=20

in Muscovy. That is the man whose name you bear, and whose blood is flowing=
 in your veins,=20

Prince Ivan Pojarsky!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe was splendid!=E2=80=9D said Iva=
n with kindling eyes; =E2=80=9CI am proud to bear his=20

name.=E2=80=9D  Petrovitch felt shocked by the disclosure of Ivan=E2=80=99s=
 ignorance of the history=20


_
school many of the prominent men of Liberia owed the beginning of their lib=
eral education. The=20

English High School at Monrovia, the Baptist Boarding School at Bexley, and=
 the Protestant=20

Episcopal High School at Cape Palmas also offered courses in higher branche=
s.[2] Still better=20

opportunities were given by the College of West Africa and Liberia College.=
 The former was=20

founded in 1839 as the head of a system of schools established by the Metho=
dist Episcopal=20

Church in every county of the Republic.[3] Liberia College was at the reque=
st of its founders, the=20

directors of the American Colonization Society, incorporated by the legisla=
ture of the country in=20

1851. As it took some time to secure adequate funds, the main building was =
not completed, and=20

students were not admitted before 1862.  [Footnote 1: _African Repository_,=
 under the caption of=20

"Education in Liberia" in various volumes; and Alexander, _A History of Col=
._, pp. 348, 391.]=20

Though the majority of the colored students scoffed at object of proud and =
passionate love.  =E2=80=9CCan=20

beards, threatening to cut off their heads if they refused. =E2=80=98God wi=

he said; =E2=80=98but will he do the same for your heads?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D=
  Petrovitch built a long and interesting narrative=20

upon this very meagre foundation of historical knowledge. He had little Feo=
dor for a listener as=20

well as Ivan, and the intelligent questions of the boys drew out the inform=
ation he loved to impart.=20

Especially graphic was his account of the Swedish defeat at Pultowa, and th=
e horrors of the retreat=20

that followed--horrors that seem to have prefigured those of a yet more awf=
ul retribution near at=20

hand, though still wrapped in the mysterious veil of the future.    =E2=80=

preparing for work in Liberia their education for service in the United Sta=
tes was not encouraged.=20

No Negro had graduated from a college before 1828, when John B. Russworm, a=
 classmate of=20

Hon. John P. Hale, received his degree from Bowdoin.[1] During the thirties=
 and forties, colored=20

persons, however well prepared, were generally debarred from colleges despi=
te the protests of=20

prominent men. We have no record that as many as fifteen Negroes were admit=
ted to higher=20

institutions in this country before 1840. It was only after much debate tha=
t Union College agreed to=20

accept a colored student on condition that he should swear that he had no N=
egro blood in his=20

veins.[2]    Thought of his home, and closed it with a sigh:   Imperial pri=
de looked sullen on his=20

plight,   And Charles beheld, nor shuddered at the sight.=E2=80=9D  Then, g=
radually bringing down the=20

narrative to more recent times, he told of the great Czarina Catherine--of =
the splendours of her=20

court and the triumphs of her arms--especially of the conquest of Poland, i=
n his partial eyes only a=20

just retribution for the past wrongs, and a glorious achievement of the pro=
wess of holy Russia. At=20

last, though with some reserve, he spoke of the short, sad reign of the Cza=
r Paul. =E2=80=9CGod sent him=20

for our sins,=E2=80=9D he said.  This reserve only piqued the curiosity of =
the boys.  =E2=80=9CIt is true he=20

had such a little to=20

encourage them to expect a general admission into northern institutions, fr=
ee blacks and=20

abolitionists concluded that separate colleges for colored people were nece=
ssary. The institution=20

demanded for them was thought to have an advantage over the aristocratic co=
llege in that labor=20

would be combined with study, making the stay at school pleasant and enabli=
ng the poorest youth=20

to secure an education.[1] It was the kind of higher institution which had =
already been established=20

in several States to meet the needs of the illiterate whites. Such higher t=
raining for the Negroes=20

was considered necessary, also, because their intermediate schools were aft=
er the reaction in a=20

languishing state. The children of color were able to advance but little on=
 account of having=20

nothing to stimulate them. The desired college was, therefore, questions; =
=E2=80=9Cbut still his heart was=20

good. It was his head that went astray. Oh, my children, there are sorrows =
in the world darker than=20

you have ever dreamed of! Seems it sad to you to sit as I do now, and see t=
he beautiful light of=20

God=E2=80=99s world fading from me day by day? What is that to the desolati=

lays his hand upon the immortal light within and turns it into darkness? Th=
e Czar Paul was not=20

son and threatened his=20

life--ay, even the life of the Empress. His true self fought long against t=
he demon that possessed=20

him. Many a time did he listen to his son, though he never loved him, when =
he dared bravely to=20

plead for and shelter the victims of his wrath. More than once he said regr=
etfully, after some=20

unusual outburst of violence, =E2=80=98I wish I had consulted the Grand Duk=
