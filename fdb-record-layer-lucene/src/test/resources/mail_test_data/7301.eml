At the moment Ruth heard voices shouting from the frozen stream. The boys w=
ere skating back=20

toward the pond, and had heard the rifle shots.  "Oh, wait till they come!"=
 Ruth cried.  "No. I'm off--

and don't any of you try to stop me," said the boy, threateningly.  He slip=
ped on the snowshoes=20

which he had kicked off when he sprang for the rifle, and at once started a=
way from the clearing.=20

"Don't go!" begged Ruth. "Oh, dear! wait! Let me thank you."  "I don't want=
 your thanks. I hate the=20

whole lot of you!" returned the boy, looking back over his shoulder.  The n=
ext moment he had=20

disappeared, and Ruth was left alone. She made a detour of the spot where t=
he dead panther lay=20

and called to Reno. The mastiff dragged himself from under a bush. He was b=
adly cut up, but=20

licked her hand when she knelt beside him.  "Hello! who's shooting over the=
re?" cried Tom=20

Cameron from the stream.  "Oh, Tom! Tom! Come and help me!" replied Ruth, a=
nd in half a=20

minute the three boys, having kicked off their skates, were in the glade.  =
"Merciful goodness!"=20

gasped Bob Steele. "See what a beast that is!"  Tom, with a cry of pain, da=
shed forward and fell=20

beside Ruth to examine the mastiff.  "My poor dog!" he cried. "Is he badly =
hurt? What's happened=20

to him?"  "Did she shoot that panther?" demanded Isadore Phelps. "Look at i=
t, Tom!"  "Reno isn't=20

so badly hurt, Tom," Ruth declared. "I believe he has a broken leg and thes=
e cuts. He dashed right=20

in and attacked the panther. What a brave dog he is!"  "But he never killed=
 the beast," said Bob.=20

"Who did that?"  "Who was shooting here? Where's the gun, Ruth?" Tom demand=
ed, now giving=20

some attention to the dead animal.  Ruth related the affair in a few words,=
 while she helped Tom=20

bind up Reno's wounds. The young master tore up his handkerchiefs to do dut=
y as bandages for=20

the wounded dog.  "We'll carry him to camp--we can do it, easily enough, ol=
d man," said Bob=20

Steele.  "And what about the panther? Don't we want his pelt?" cried Isador=
e.  "We'll send Long=20

Jerry after that," Tom said. "I wish that fellow hadn't run away with the r=
ifle. But you couldn't help it,=20

Ruth."  "He certainly is a bad boy," declared the girl. "Yet--somehow--I am=
 sorry for him. He must=20

be all alone in these woods. Something will happen to him."  "Never mind. W=
e can forgive him,=20

and hope that he'll pull through all right, after he saved you, Ruthie," To=
m said. "Come on, now,=20

Bobbins. Lend a hand with the poor dog."  Tom had removed his coat and in t=
hat, for a blanket,=20

they carried Reno through the woods to the camp. It was a hard journey, for=
 in places the snow=20

had drifted and was quite soft. But in less than an hour they arrived at th=
e Edith herself, happy in=20

having so successfully surmounted the incident Millefleurs, yet greatly dis=
turbed and excited about=20

the coming events as concerned John Erskine, and doubtful whether she ought=
 to have written to=20

him so very frank and undisguised a letter,--there was as much pain as plea=
sure. As for Carry,=20

when she woke in the gloomy magnificence of Tinto, and all the warmth and g=
lowing hopes of=20

yesterday came back to her mind with a bound, there was nothing in her thou=
ghts which prevented=20

her lying still upon her pillows and letting the flood of light sweep into =
her heart, in a luxury of=20

happiness and peace which was past describing. She did not for the moment e=
ven need to think of=20

the meeting to come. Blessedness seemed suddenly to have become habitual to=
 her once more.=20

She woke to the delight of life. "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive." T=
he past had flown away like=20

a dream: was it a dream altogether, a nightmare, some dark shadow of fear a=
nd pain, from which=20

the oppressed soul, having at last awoke, was free? Beaufort at Dalrulzian =
got up a similar feeling.=20

He had been obliged to find himself something of a failure--but he, too, se=
emed to be restored to=20

the hopes and the standing-ground of youth. He would now have no excuse to =
himself for his=20

absence of energy and ambition. His youthful strength was still unimpaired,=
 though he had made=20



so much less of it than he ought. And now here were all the occasions for a=
 fresh beginning--

sympathy to support him and to inspire him. Not only would he be happy, but=
 at last he would do=20

something--he would carry out all hopes and prophecies of him now.  This wa=
s the brighter side--

but in Lindores the sentiments of the chief personages in the house were no=
t so pleasant. Lord=20

Lindores was angry and humiliated, furious with his daughter and still more=
 with his wife, who, he=20

had no doubt, with her ridiculous romance, had filled the girl's head with =
follies--and not much less=20

with Millefleurs, who had thus suffered himself to be foiled. But his distu=
rbed cogitations were as=20

nothing to the tumult of pain and alarm which rose up in Rintoul's mind whe=
n he opened his eyes=20

to the morning light. When the young man awoke he had first a moment of bew=
ildered=20

consideration, what was the meaning of the confused sense of disaster of wh=
ich he became=20

instantly conscious--and then he sprang from his bed unable to rest, eager =
for movement or=20

anything which would counterbalance the fever of the crisis. This was the d=
ay. He could delay no=20

longer; he could not trifle with the situation, or leave things to chance a=
fter to-day. It would be a=20

new beginning in his life. Hitherto all had gone on=20


_
The men had come in with the wood by that time, and Mr. Cameron with them. =
Mrs. Murchiston=20

and the girls were greatly worried over Ruth's absence and the absence, too=
, of the three boys.=20

But the death of the catamount, and the safety of all, quickly put a better=
 face upon the situation.=20

Ruth was praised a good bit for her bravery. And Mr. Cameron said:  "There'=
s something in that=20

poor boy whom we tried to return to his friends--if the Hatfields _are_ his=
 friends. He does not lack=20

courage, that is sure--courage of a certain kind, anyway. I must see to his=
 business soon. I believe=20

the Hatfields live within twenty miles of this place, and in a day or two I=
 will ride over and see=20

them."  "Oh! let us all go, father," urged Helen. "Can't we go in the sleig=
hs we came over in from=20

Scarboro?"  "Don't take them, sir," said Mrs. Murchiston. "I shan't feel sa=
fe for them again until we=20

get out of these woods."  "Why, Mis' Murchiston," drawled Long Jerry, who h=
ad come into the hall=20

with a great armful of wood, "there ain't a mite of danger now. That panthe=
r's killed--deader'n last=20

Thanksgivin's turkey. There may not be another around here for half a score=
 of years."  "But they=20

say there are bears in the woods," cried the governess.  "Aw, shucks!" retu=
rned the woodsman.=20

"What's a b'ar? B'ar's is us'ally as skeery as rabbits, unless they are mig=
hty hungry. And ye don't=20

often meet a hungry bear this time o' year. They are mostly housed up for t=
he winter in some=20

warm hole."  "But what would these girls do if they met a bear, Mr. Todd?" =
asked Mr. Cameron,=20

laughing.  "Why, this here leetle Ruth Fielding gal, _she'd_ have pluck eno=
ugh to shoot him, I=20

reckon," chuckled Long Jerry. "And she wouldn't be the first girl that's sh=
ot a full growed b'ar right=20

in this neighborhood."  "I thought you said there wasn't any around here, J=
erry?" cried Helen.=20

"This happened some time ago, Miss," returned the woodsman. "And it happene=
d right over yon at=20

Bill Bennett's farm--not four mile from here. Sally Bennett was a plucky on=
e, now I tell ye. And=20

pretty--wal, I was a jedge of female loveliness in them days," went on Long=
 Jerry, with a sly grin.=20

"Ye see, I was lookin' 'em all over, tryin' to make up my mind which one of=
 the gals I should pick=20

for my partner through life. And Sally was about the best of the bunch."  "=
Why didn't you pick her=20

then?" asked Tom.  "She got in her hand pickin' first," chuckled Jerry. "An=
d she picked a feller from=20

town. Fac' is, I was so long a-pickin' that I never got nary wife at all, s=
o have lived all my life an old=20

bachelder."  "But let's hear about Sally and the bear," proposed Ruth, eage=
rly, knowing what a=20

resourceful story-teller Long Jerry was.  "Come Jerry, sit down and let's h=
ave it," agreed Mr.=20

Cameron, and the party of young folk drew up chairs, before the fire. Long =
Jerry squatted down in=20

his usual manner on the hearth, and the story was begun.     CHAPTER XVII  =
LONG JERRY'S=20

STORY   "Ol' man Bennett," began Jerry Todd, "warn't a native of this neck =
o' woods. He come up=20

from Jarsey, or some such place, and bringed his fam'bly with him, and Sall=
y Bennett. She was his=20

sister, and as he was a pretty upstandin' man, so was she a tall, well-buil=
t gal. She sartain made a=20

hit up here around Scarboro and along Rollin' River.  "But she wasn't backw=
oods bred, and the=20

other girls said she was timid and afraid of her shadder," chuckled Long Je=
rry. "She warn't afraid=20

of the boys, and mebbe that's why the other gals said sharp things about he=
r," pursued the=20

philosophical backwoodsman. "You misses know more about that than I do--sur=
e!  "Howsomever,=20

come the second spring the Bennetts had been up here, Mis' Bennett, old Bil=
l's wife, was called=20

down to see her ma, that was sick, they said, and that left Miss Sally to k=
eep house. Come the first=20

Saturday thereafter and Bennett, _he_ had to go to Scarboro to mill.  "You =
know jest how=20

lonesome it is up here now; 'twas a whole sight wuss in them days. There wa=
rn't no telephone,=20

and it was more than 'two hoots and a holler,' as the feller said, betwixt =
neighbors.  "But Old Bill's=20



going to mill left only Miss Sally and the three little boys at home. Benne=
tt had cleared a piece=20

around the house, scratched him a few hills of corn betwixt the stumps the =
year before, and this=20

spring was tryin' to tear out the roots and small stumps with a pair o' ste=
ers and a tam-harrer.=20

gone with the stream, he had never set himself in opposition to the world o=
r its ways, never done=20

anything to draw men's eyes upon him. But after to-day all would be changed=
. To-morrow his=20

name would be telegraphed over all the world in newspaper paragraphs; to-mo=
rrow every fellow=20

he had ever known would be saying: "Rintoul! what Rintoul? You never can me=
an?----" No, they=20

would all feel it to be impossible. Rintoul who was so safe, who never got =
into scrapes, whom they=20

even laughed at as a canny Scot, though he did not feel a Scot at all. It w=
ould be incredible to all=20

who had ever known him. And what a scandal, what an outcry it would make! I=
n his own family=20

even! Rintoul knew that Carry was not a broken-hearted widow, and yet it se=
emed to him that,=20

after she knew, she would never speak to him again. It made his heart sink =
to think of all the=20

changes that in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, would become inevitab=
le. His father, with=20

what rage, and misery, and confusion of all his plans and hopes, would he h=
ear it! with what=20

consternation his mother and sister! As for himself, everything would be in=
terrupted and set aside,=20

his life in every way turned upside-down, his ambition checked, his hopes d=
estroyed. And all this=20

to save John Erskine from a certain amount of inconvenience! That was how a=
t least it appeared=20

to him--really from inconvenience, nothing more. John was not a man of rank=
 like himself, full in=20

the eyes of the world--he was not responsible to a proud and ambitious fath=
er. A short term of=20

imprisonment to him would be like a disagreeable visit, nothing more. Many =
people had to spend a=20

certain part of every year, for instance, with an old uncle or aunt, somebo=
dy from whom they had=20

expectations. It really would be little or nothing more than this. And it w=
as not as if it had been=20

anything disgraceful. The county would not think the worse of him; it was a=
n accident, a thing that=20

might have happened to any one. But to Rintoul how much more terrible! he t=
he brother-in-law of=20

the man, with a sort of interest in his death. He would have to leave his r=
egiment. All his projects=20

for life would be interrupted. By the time he was free again, he would be f=
orgotten in society, and=20

his name would be _fltri_ for ever. These thoughts sent him pacing about hi=
s room with hasty=20

steps, the perspiration standing on his forehead. All to save John Erskine,=
 who was just as much=20

to blame as he was--for the first quarrel was the one which had excited tha=
t unfortunate fellow; all=20

to save from a little inconvenience another man!  Perhaps if he had been pl=
aced simply in front of=20

the question whether he would let another man be punished for what he had d=
one, Rintoul would=20

have had spirit enough to say No; certainly if it had been put to him quick=
ly for an instant decision,=20

without time to think, he would have said No, and held by his honour. But s=
omething else more=20

determined than himself stood before him. Nora! He might use sophistries fo=
r the confusing of his=20

own intellect--but not hers. She would look at him, he knew how. She would =
turn away from him,=20

he knew how. The anticipation of that glance of high scorn and unspoken con=
demnation made=20

Rintoul tremble to the depths of his being. When he thought of it he braced=
 himself up with a=20

rapidity and certainty much unlike the previous hesitating strain of his th=
oughts. "It must be done,"=20

he said to himself. He might beguile himself with argument, but he could no=
t beguile _her_. The=20

thought might intrude upon him whether he had been wise to let her know--wh=
ether it might not=20

have been better to keep it to himself; but, having done it, the question w=
as now not only whether=20

he was content to lose Nora--but if he was content to put up with her scorn=
 and immeasurable=20



contempt.  They all remarked how pale he was when he came to breakfast--gha=
stly pale, lines=20

under his eyes, the corners of his mouth drooping; his hair, which he had t=
ried hard to brush as=20

usual, hung limp, and would not take its accustomed curl. Lady Lindores tor=
tured him by useless=20

inquiries about his health. "You are ill--I am sure you are ill. You must l=
et me send for the doctor."=20

"For goodness' sake, mother, let a fellow alone. I am as well as you are," =
had been his amiable=20

answer. He all but swore at the servants, all but kicked the dog, who thrus=
t with confiding=20

importunity his head under his master's arm.=20


_
virgin forest all about her, while she was a-movin' about the room getting =
dinner for the young 'uns.=20

While she was at work the littlest feller, Johnny, who was building a cobho=
use on the floor, yelps=20

up like a terrier:  "'Aunt Sally! Aunt Sally! Looker that big dog!"  "Miss =
Sally, she turns around, an'=20

what does she see but a big brown bear--oh, a whackin' big feller!--with hi=
s very nose at the open=20

door."  "Oh!" squealed Helen.  "How awful!" cried Belle Tingley.  "A mighty=
 onexpected visitor,"=20

chuckled Jerry. "But, if she was scar't, she warn't plumb stunned in her tr=
acks--no, sir! She gave a=20

leap for the door and she swung it shut right against Mr. B'ar's nose. And =
then she barred it."=20

"Brave girl," said Mrs. Murchiston.  "I reckon so, ma'am," agreed the guide=
. "And then she=20

remembered that Tom and Charlie, the other two boys, were gone down the hil=
l to a spring for a=20

bucket of fresh water.  "There were two doors to the cabin, directly opposi=
te each other, and they'd=20

both been open. The spring was reached from the other door and Miss Sally f=
lew to it and saw the=20

boys just comin' up the hill.  "'Run, boys, run!' she screams. 'Never mind =
the water! Drop it and=20

run! There's a b'ar in the yard! Run! Run!'  "And them boys _did_ run, but =
they held fast to their=20

bucket and brought most of the water inter the house with 'em. Then Miss Sa=
lly barred that door,=20

too, and they all went to the winder and peeped out. There was Mister B'ar =
snoopin' about the=20

yard, and lookin' almost as big as one of the steers.  "He went a-sniffin' =
about the yard, smellin' of=20

everything like b'ars do when they're forragin', s'archin' for somethin' te=
r tempt his appetite.=20

Suddenly he stood stock still, raised his big head, and sniffed the air kee=
n-like. Then he growled=20

and went straight for the pig-pen.  "'Oh, the pigs! the pigs!' squealed one=
 of the boys. 'The nice=20

pigs! He'll eat 'em all up!'  "And there was a good reason for their takin'=
 on," intolerable to him--his=20

thoughts were buzzing in his ears and all about him, so that he did not hea=
r what the other people=20

said; and they talked--with what frivolous pertinacity they talked!--about =
nothing at all, about the=20

most trivial things; while he was balancing something that, in his exciteme=
nt, he felt inclined to call=20

life or death.  But, indeed, Rintoul's impressions as to the gaiety and liv=
ely conversation going on=20

were as far as possible from the truth. There was scarcely any conversation=
, but a general=20

embarrassment. Millefleurs was the only one who said much. He bore his disa=
ppointment so=20

sweetly, and was so entirely master of the situation, that Lord Lindores gr=
ew more and more=20

angry. He made various sharp replies, but the little Marquis took no heed. =
He gushed forth, like a=20

flowing stream, a great many pleasant details about his going home. He was =
going home in a day=20

or two. His visit to Lindores was one which he could never forget; it had g=
ained him, he hoped,=20

friends for life. Wherever he went he would carry with him the recollection=
 of the kindness he had=20

received. Thus he flowed forth, doing his best, as usual, to smooth down th=
e embarrassment of=20

the others. But the hour of the repast was somewhat terrible to everybody. =
Decorum required that=20

they should all sit a certain time at the table, and make a fashion of eati=
ng. People have to eat will=20

they nill they, that they may not betray themselves. They all came to the s=
urface, so to speak, with=20

a gasp, as Millefleurs said in his round and velvety voice, "I suppose you =
are going to Dunearn to=20

this examination, Lord Lindores?"  "It is a private affair, not an open cou=
rt; but to show an interest,=20

I suppose I ought to be somewhere near----" was the answer; and there arose=
 at that moment a=20

howl of fright and pain from the dog, upon whom Rintoul had spilt a cup of =
tea. He got up white=20

and haggard, shaking off the deluge from his clothes. "These brutes get=20


_
their next winter's meat was in that pen--a sow and five plump little porke=
rs.  "'Oh, Aunty Sally,'=20

cries one of the bigger boys, 'What shall we do? What'll father say when he=
 comes back and finds=20

the pigs killed?'  "Ye see," continued Long Jerry, shaking his head, "it wa=
s a tragedy to them. You=20

folks livin' in town don't understand what it means for a farmer to lose hi=
s pigs. "why can we never=20

have a meal without a swarm of them about?"  The proceedings had begun at D=
unearn before any=20

of the party from Lindores arrived there. Rintoul, who was the first to set=
 out, walked, with a sort of=20

miserable desire of postponing the crisis; and Lord Lindores, with a kind o=
f sullen friendliness=20

towards John, followed in his phaeton. They were both late, and were=20


_
meat ain't like hog-meat, anyway. If the b'ar got those porkers them young =
'uns would go mighty=20

hungry the next winter.  "Miss Sally, she knew that, all right, and when th=
e boy says: 'What shall=20

we do?' she made up her mind pretty quick that she'd got to _try_ ter do su=
mpin'--yes, sir-ree! She=20

run for her brother's rifle that hung over the other door.  "'I'm goin' to =
try and shoot that b'ar, boys,'=20

says she, jest as firm as she could speak.  "'Oh, Aunt Sally! you can't,' s=
ays Tom, the oldest.  "'I=20

don't know whether I can or not till I try,' says she. She felt like Miss R=
uthie did--eh?" and the long=20

guide chuckled. "No tellin' whether you kin do a thing, or not, till you ha=
ve a whack at it.  "'Don't=20

you try it, Aunt Sally,' says Charlie. 'He might kill you.'  "'I won't give=
 him a chance at me,' says=20

she. 'Now boys, let me out and mind jest what I say. If anything _does_ hap=
pen to me, don't you=20

dars't come out, but go in and bar the door again, and stay till your fathe=
r comes back. Now,=20

promise me!'  "She made 'em promise before she ventured out of the door, an=
d then she left 'em=20

at the open door, jest about breathless with suspense and terror, while Mis=
s Sally sped across the=20

yard toward the pig-pen. Mister Ba'r, he'd torn down some of the pine slabs=
 at one corner and got=20

into the pen. The old sow was singin' out like all Kildee, and the little f=
ellers was a-squealin' to the=20

top o' their bent. The b'ar smacked one o' the juicy little fellers and beg=
un to lunch off'n him jest as=20

 he didn't notice=20

nothin' but his very different from Miss Barbara, who, wound up by anxiety =
to an exertion which=20

she could not have believed herself capable of, had walked from her house, =
leaning on Nora's=20

arm, and was waiting on the spot when John was driven up in a shabby old fl=
y from Dunnottar.=20

The old lady was at the door of the fly before it could be opened, putting =
out her hand to him. "My=20

bonnie lad, you'll come to your luncheon with me at half-past one; and mind=
 that you're not late,"=20

she said, in a loud, cheerful, and confident voice, so that every one could=
 hear. She took no notice=20

of the lookers-on, but gave her invitation and her greeting with a fine dis=

along the Lindores road. "Who are you looking for, Nora?" Miss Barbara had =
already asked half-a-

suffering, yet touched by a perception of some anxiety in her. "You are not=
 to be unhappy about=20

John Erskine," she said at last. These words came to Nora's ears vaguely, t=
