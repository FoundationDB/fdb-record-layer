 I take it a wife's not like a red Indian, tied to a stake."  "No," replied=
 Persis, smiling; "rather like a vine fastened to a supporting, sheltering =

ached him. "That's a cruel word. The question is--I'm worn out. I don't thi=

That's a cruel word. The question is--I'm worn out. I don't think I shall b=
e able to eat supper. My maid will want to put me to bed, the minute I get =
home. Poor old Marianne! She's such a tyrant, when _
together!"  "O Ned," exclaimed Persis, "how fearful it is to think what mul=
titudes are lost in that=20

whirlpool! God grant that poor Nancy be rescued in time!"  "We'll not forge=
t her in our prayers,"=20

said Ned Franks.  On the following day John Sands started for London, with =
a heavy, anxious=20

heart, only lightened by the thought that the sailor was certain to keep hi=
s word. Sands lingered at=20

the door of his home, with his carpet-bag in his hand, turning half round i=
n a hesitating manner, as=20

if he fancied that something might have been forgotten.  "I suppose that yo=
u've left your papers=20

behind, or maybe your purse," said Nancy, who stood on the threshold to see=
 her husband start=20

on his journey.  "No, it's not that, my dear," half stammered the clerk; "i=
t's that I'm not just easy in=20

mind leaving you here all alone."  "I don't care three farthings for being =
alone," cried the=20

ungracious wife; "I can find occupation enough, and amusement enough, if I =
choose."  "That's it,=20

that's just it; I wanted you to promise, dear,--while I'm away, just while =
I'm away, you understand,--

that you--you won't step over to the 'Chequers.'"  "I'll not promise that t=
o you, nor to nobody," said=20

Nancy, with a toss of her head and a snort of disdain; "a pretty pass it's =
come to, indeed, if I=20

mayn't go and have a gossip with a friend. Mrs. Fuddles of the 'Chequers,' =
was my school-fellow;=20

you know that as well as I do."  John Sands drew a heavy sigh, and wished f=
rom the bottom of his=20

heart that Mrs. Fuddles and the "Chequers" were somewhere at the other side=
 of the world,=20

instead of down in the dell, just beyond the mill. He felt, however, that t=
here was no use in his=20

saying anything more; so Sands set off on his walk to the nearest station, =
and Nancy stood at the=20

door watching him, as long as the prim figure dressed in black remained wit=
hin sight. Then she=20

went back into her parlor and sat down, resting her hands on her knees, and=
 gazing with a fixed,=20

dull, joyless stare on the opposite wall. Nancy felt very desolate at that =
moment, for she had=20

parted with the only being in all the world who really loved her. Mrs. Sand=
s knew that she was=20

already "the talk of the village;" that her neighbors, who had once looked =
on her as "a thriving,=20

well-to-do woman," now regarded her with contempt; she knew that she was lo=
wered in the eyes=20

of all; and, though she would not have owned that she was so, Nancy was low=
ered in her own.=20

She scorned, she despised herself for the very vice to which she clung so s=
trongly. She could not=20

bear to be alone with her thoughts; she must drown them in the fiery poison=
 which was already=20

consuming her credit, her happiness, and her peace. Nancy rose, walked up t=
o the cupboard, and=20

took out of it a bottle and a glass. Just as she had pulled out the cork fr=
om the former, she heard a=20

soft tap at the door.  "Why, Mrs. Franks, who would have thought of seeing =
you! and you've=20

brought the baby!" exclaimed Nancy, her face relaxing into an expression of=
 something like=20

pleasure; for she was gratified by the unexpected visit of one whose charac=
ter stood so high in the=20

village, at a time when her own had so grievously sunk.  Persis took the se=
at which was offered to=20

her, and listened complacently to the praise of her beautiful boy, and when=
 she marked the shade=20

of sadness in Nancy's tone as she said, "Oh! I know what a mother feels wit=
h her first-born babe in=20

her arms," she was glad that she had come on her errand of kindness to the =
lonely and tempted=20

woman.  "I did not think as you'd have walked as far as this, Mrs. Franks, =
leastways carrying the=20

child, for you're not over strong," said Mrs. Sands. "You've not been here =
for a long time; we met=20

oftener when you were Persis Meade."  "Yes, you came to see me in the dell.=
 I remember well=20

your kindness in bringing broth to my poor old grandfather; excellent broth=
 it was; I've no doubt=20

that it did him good."  This little acknowledgment of a single act of past =
kindness had more effect=20

in thawing the heart of Nancy Sands than Persis could have expected. Nancy'=
s pride would have=20



rebelled at the idea of really was!  "Darling," he said, "you were wonderfu=
l. And how proud I was of=20

you--how proud I am. I thought it would be impossible to worship you more t=
han I did. But I love=20

you a thousand times more than ever to-night."  It was true, I knew. I coul=
d see it in his eyes, hear=20

it in his voice. Since his dreadful misfortune in losing the diamonds, sinc=
e I had comforted him for=20

their loss, and insisted on giving him all I had to help him out of his tro=
uble, he had seen in me the=20

angel of his salvation. To-night his heart was almost breaking with love fo=
r me, who so ill deserved=20

it. Now, I had news for him, which would make him long to shout for joy. If=
 I chose, I could tell him=20

that the jewels were safe. He would love me still more passionately in his =
happiness, which I had=20

given, than in his grief; and I would take all his love as if it were my ri=
ght, hiding the secret of my=20

treachery as long as I could. But how long would that be? How could I be su=
re that the theft of the=20

treaty had not already been discovered, and that the avalanche of ruin was =
not on its way to blot=20

us for ever out of life and love?  The fear made me nestle nearer to him, a=
nd cling tightly, because=20

I said to myself that perhaps I might never be in his arms again: that this=
 might be the last time that=20

his eyes--those eyes that are not cold--might look at me with love in them,=
 as now.  "Suppose all=20

these people out there had hated and hissed me, instead of applauding?" I a=
sked. "Would you still=20

be proud of me, still care for me?"  "I'd love you better, if there could b=
e a 'better,'" he answered,=20

holding me very close.  "You know, dearest one, most beautiful one, that I'=
m a jealous brute. I=20

can't bear you to belong to others--even to the public that appreciates you=
 almost as much as you=20

deserve to be appreciated. Of course I'm proud that they adore you, but I'd=
 like to take you away=20

from them and adore you all by myself. Why, if the whole world turned again=
st you, there'd be a=20

kind of joy in that for me. I'd be so glad of the chance to face it for you=
, to shield you from it=20

always."  "Then, what _is_ there would make you love me less?" I went on, d=
welling on the subject=20

with a dreadful fascination, as one looks over the brink of a precipice.  "=
Nothing on God's earth--

while you kept true to me."  "And if I weren't true--if I deceived you?"  "=
Why, I'd kill you--and myself=20

after. But it makes me see red--a blazing scarlet--even to think of such a =
thing. Why should you=20

speak of it--when it's beyond possibility, thank Heaven! I know you love me=
, or you wouldn't make=20

such noble sacrifices to save me from ruin."  I shivered: and I shall not b=
e colder when they lay me=20

in my coffin. I wished that I had not looked over that precipice, down into=
 blackness. Why dwell on=20

horrors, when I might have five minutes of happiness--perhaps the last I sh=
ould ever know? I=20

remembered the piece of good news I had for Raoul. I would have told him th=
en, but he went on,=20

saying to me so many things sweet and blessed to hear, that I could not bea=
r to cut him short, lest=20

never after this should he speak words of love to me. Then--long before it =
ought, so it seemed--the=20

clock in mydressing-room struck, and I knew that I hadn't another instant t=
o spare. On some first=20

nights I might have been willing to risk keeping the curtain down (though I=
 am rather conscientious=20

in such ways), but to-night I wanted, more than anything else, to have the =
play over, and to get=20

home by midnight or before, so that my suspense might be ended, and I might=
 know the worst--or=20

best.  "I must go. You must leave me, dear," I said. "But I've some good ne=
ws for you when there's=20

time to explain, and a great surprise. I can't give you a minute until the =
last, for you know I've=20

almost to open the third and fourth acts. But when the curtain goes down on=
 my death scene,=20

come behind again. I shan't take any calls--after dying, it's too inartisti=
c, isn't it? And I never do. I'll=20

see you for just a few more minutes here, in this room, before I dress to g=
o home."  "For a few=20

minutes!" Raoul caught me up. "But afterwards? You=20


_
wife conferring any favor upon her, but her owning herself to be the oblige=
d party set Mrs. Sands=20

at once at her ease. She liked to talk over past days, happy days as she no=
w thought them, when=20

her own poor boy was living. No one who had only seen Nancy Sands on that m=
orning, sitting=20

chatting with Persis Franks, would have thought of her as the "tigress" who=
se temper, especially=20

when she was under the influence of drink, made her the terror of her neigh=
bors.  "I'm glad of your=20

visit," she observed after a while; "I was feeling a bit dull all alone."  =
"I hope that you will return my=20

visit," said Persis; "could you not come over this evening at seven to tea?=
"  "I suppose your man's=20

out?" said Nancy, shortly. "I warrant you he'd not care to see me."  "Oh, n=
o, my clear husband will=20

be at home; he knew that I was going to invite you. I never do me long ago =
that I should have=20

supper with you at your house--just you and I alone together--on the first =
night of the new play."=20

My heart gave a jump as he reminded me of this promise. Never before had I =
forgotten an=20

engagement with Raoul. But this time I had forgotten. There had been so man=
y miserable things=20

to think of, that they had crowded the one pleasant thing out of my torture=
d brain. I drew away=20

from him involuntarily with a start of surprise.  "You'd forgotten!" exclai=
med Raoul, disappointed=20

and hurt.  "Only for the instant," I said, "because I'm hardly myself. I'm =
tired and excited, unstrung,=20

as I always am on first nights. But--"  "Would you rather not be bothered w=
ith me?" he asked=20

wistfully, as I paused to think what I should do.  His eyes looked as if th=
e light had suddenly gone=20

out of them, and I couldn't bear that. It might too=20
