Salutation to you, O Princes, who stand in the presence of     Osiris.... S=
end me the grace to have=20

my sins destroyed, as you     have done for the seven spirits who follow th=
eir Lord!(612)=20

Brahma's head is ornamented with seven rays, and he is followed by the seve=
n Rishis, in the=20

seven Svargas. China has her seven Pagodas; the Greeks had their seven Cycl=
opes, seven=20

Demiurgi, and the Mystery Gods, the seven Kabiri, whose chief was Jupiter-S=
aturn, and with the=20

Jews, Jehovah. Now the latter Deity has become chief of all, the highest an=
d the one God, and his=20

old place is taken by Mikael (Michael). He is the "Chief of the Host" (_tsa=
ba_); the "Archistrategus=20

of the Lord's army"; the "Conqueror of the Devil"--Victor diaboli--and the =
"Archisatrap of the Sacred=20

Militia," he who slew the "Great Dragon." Unfortunately astrology and symbo=
logy, having no=20

inducement to veil old things with new masks, have preserved the real name =
of Mikael--"that was=20

Jehovah"--Mikael being the Angel of the face of the Lord,(613) "the guardia=
n of the planets," and=20

the living image of God. He represents the Deity in his visits to earth, fo=
r as it is well expressed in=20

Hebrew, he is one {~HEBREW LETTER MEM~}{~HEBREW LETTER YOD~}{~HEBREW LETTER=
=20

KAF~}{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}{~HEBREW LETTER LAMED~}, who is as God, or who i=
s like=20

unto God. It is he who cast out the serpent.(614)  Mikael, being the regent=
 of the planet Saturn, is--

_Saturn_.(615) His mystery-name is Sabbathiel, because he presides over the=
 Jewish Sabbath,=20

as also over the astrological Saturday. Once identified, the reputation of =
the Christian conqueror of=20

the devil is in still greater danger from further identifications. Biblical=
 angels are called Malachim,=20

the messengers between God (or rather _the gods_) and men. In Hebrew {~HEBR=
EW LETTER=20

MEM~}{~HEBREW LETTER KAF~}{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}{~HEBREW LETTER LAMED~}=20

Malach, is also "a King," and Malech or Melech was likewise Moloch, or agai=
n Saturn, the Seb of=20

Egypt, to whom _Dies Saturni_, or the Sabbath, was dedicated. The Sabaeans =
separated and=20

distinguished the planet Saturn from its God far more than the Roman Cathol=
ics do their angels=20

from their stars; and the Kabalists make of the Archangel Mikael the patron=
 of the seventh work of=20

magic.       In theological symbolism ... Jupiter [the Sun] is the risen an=
d     glorious Saviour, and=20

Saturn, God the Father, or the Jehovah of     Moses,(616)   says Eliphas Le=
vi, who _ought_ to=20

know. Jehovah and the Saviour, Saturn and Jupiter, being thus one, and Mika=
el being called the=20

living image of God, it does seem dangerous for the Church to call Saturn, =
Satan--_le dieu=20

mauvais_. However, Rome is strong in casuistry and will get out of this as =
she got out of every=20

other identification, with glory to herself and to her own full satisfactio=
n. Nevertheless all her=20

dogmas and rituals seem like so many pages torn out from the history of Occ=
ultism, and then=20

distorted. The extremely thin partition that separates the Kabalistic and C=
haldaean Theogony from=20

the Roman Catholic Angelology and Theodicy is now confessed by at least one=
 Roman Catholic=20

writer. One can hardly believe one's eyes in finding the following (the pas=
sages italicized by us=20

should be carefully noticed):       One of the most utter, the remembrance =
of you my last thought."=20

Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion, and regained with hurried s=
teps the porch where=20

Olivain was waiting with the horses.  "Olivain," said Athos, showing the se=
rvant Raoul's shoulder-

belt, "tighten the buckle of the sword, it falls too low. You will accompan=
y monsieur le vicomte till=20

Grimaud rejoins you. You know, Raoul, Grimaud is an old and zealous servant=
; he will follow you."=20

"Yes, sir," answered Raoul.  "Now to horse, that I may see you depart!"  Ra=
oul obeyed.  "Adieu,=20

Raoul," said the count; "adieu, my dearest boy!"  "Adieu, sir, adieu, my be=
loved protector."  Athos=20

waved his hand--he dared not trust himself to speak: and Raoul went away, h=
is head uncovered.=20



Athos remained motionless, looking after him until he turned the corner of =
the street.  Then the=20

count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant, remounted =
the steps, went into the=20

cathedral, there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray.     23. One =
of the Forty Methods of=20

Escape of the Duc de Beaufort.   Meanwhile time was passing on for the pris=
oner, as well as for=20

those who were preparing his escape; only for him it passed more slowly. Un=
like other men, who=20

enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of =
execution approaches,=20

the Duc de Beaufort, whose buoyant courage had become a proverb, seemed to =
push time before=20

him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action. In his escape alo=
ne, apart from his=20

plans for the future, which, it must be admitted, were for the present suff=
iciently vague and=20

uncertain, there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart. In th=
e first place his escape=20

would be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny, whom he hated for th=
e petty persecutions=20

he owed to him. It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin, whom he execr=
ated for the greater=20

offences he had committed. It may be observed that there was a proper propo=
rtion in his=20

sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister--toward the s=
ubordinate and the=20

master.  Then Monsieur de Beaufort, who was so familiar with the interior o=
f the Palais Royal,=20

though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the car=
dinal, pictured to=20

himself, in his prison, all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when=
 the rumor should run=20

from the minister's cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria: "Monsieur de=
 Beaufort has=20

escaped!" Whilst saying that to himself, Monsieur de Beaufort smiled pleasa=
ntly and imagined=20

himself already outside, breathing the air of the plains and the forests, p=
ressing a strong horse=20

between his knees and crying out in a loud voice, "I am free!"  It is true =
that on coming to himself=20

he found that he was still within four walls; he saw La Ramee twirling his =
thumbs ten feet from him,=20

and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante-chamber. The only thing th=
at was pleasant to him=20

in that odious tableau--such is the instability of the human mind--was the =
sullen face of Grimaud,=20

for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his ho=
pe. Grimaud seemed=20

to him an Antinous. It is needless to say that this transformation was visi=
ble only to the prisoner's=20

feverish imagination. Grimaud was=20


_
_the calculated discretion used in the enunciation of the     mysteries les=
s directly useful to=20

salvation_.... Thus, beyond     those "myriads of myriads" of angelic creat=
ures just noticed(617)=20

and all these prudently elementary divisions, there are certainly     many =
others, whose very=20

names have not yet reached us.(618) "For,"     excellently says St. John Ch=
rysostom, "there are=20

doubtless, (_sine     dubio_,) many other _Virtues_ [celestial beings] whos=
e     denominations we=20

are yet far from knowing.... The nine orders are     not by any means the o=
nly populations in=20

heaven, where, on the     contrary, _are to be found numberless tribes_ of =
inhabitants     infinitely=20

varied, and of which it would be impossible _to give     the slightest idea=
_ through human=20

tongue.... Paul, who _had     learned their names_, reveals to us their exi=
stence." (_De=20

Incomprehensibili Natura Dei_, Bk. IV.)....      It would thus amount _to a=
 gross mistake to see=20

merely errors_ in     the Angelology of the Kabalists and Gnostics, so seve=
rely treated     by the=20

Apostle of the Gentiles, for his imposing censure reached     confidence of=
 his superior, La Ramee,=20

who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself, for, as we have said=
, La Ramee felt at=20

the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort.  And s=
o the good La Ramee=20

made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner. He had but one fau=
lt--he was a gourmand; he=20

had found the pates good, the wine excellent. Now the successor of Pere Mar=
teau had promised=20

him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl, and Chambertin wine inste=
ad of Macon. All this,=20

set off by the presence of that excellent prince, who was so good-natured, =
who invented so droll=20

tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin, made=
 for La Ramee the=20

approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year. He therefor=
e looked forward to six=20

o'clock with as much impatience as the duke himself.  Since daybreak La Ram=
ee had been=20

occupied with the preparations, and trusting no one but himself, he had vis=
ited personally the=20

successor of Pere Marteau. The latter had surpassed himself; he showed La R=
amee a monstrous=20

pate, ornamented with Monsieur de Beaufort's=20


_
more, _the application of those noble_ titles _to the miserable     persona=
lities of demoniacal=20

usurpers_.(619) Often nothing so     resemble each other as _the language o=
f the judges and that=20

of the     convicts_ [of saints and Occultists]. One has to penetrate deepl=
y     into this _dual_ study=20

[of creed and profession] and what is still     better, _to trust blindly t=
o the authority of the tribunal_=20

[the     Church of Rome, of course] to enable oneself to seize precisely   =
  the point of the error.=20

The _Gnosis_ condemned by St. Paul     remains, nevertheless, for him as fo=
r Plato the supreme=20

knowledge     of all truths, and of the _Being par excellence_, {~GREEK SMA=

the duke's chamber=20

rubbing his hands. To crown his happiness, Monsieur de Chavigny had started=
 on a journey that=20

morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputy-governor of the chateau.  As=
 for Grimaud, he=20

seemed more sullen than ever.  In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Be=
aufort had a game of=20

tennis with La Ramee; a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert. Grimaud, go=
ing in advance,=20

followed the course which they were to take in the evening. The game was pl=
ayed in an inclosure=20

called the little court of the chateau, a place quite deserted except when =
Monsieur de Beaufort=20

was playing; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous, the wall was =
so high.  There were=20

three gates to open before reaching the inclosure, each by a different key.=
 When they arrived=20

Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall, letting his=
 legs dangle outside. It=20

was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached.  This manoeuvre,=

 game at tennis, which,=20

upon a sign from Grimaud, Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play, began=
 in the afternoon.=20

The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely.  Four of the gu=

constantly near the prisoner, assisted in picking up the tennis balls. When=
