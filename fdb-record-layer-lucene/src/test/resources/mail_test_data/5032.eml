crises in our history than that of Revolutionary times. That was, of course=
, the greatest of all, and=20

never to be forgotten, as it marks the definite transition of thirteen colo=
nies into thirteen States,=20

organized for war purposes as a nation. There had been over a year of war, =
beginning with the=20

skirmish at Lexington and the British retreat, followed quickly by Ticonder=
oga, Bunker Hill, and the=20

investment of Boston. During the fall and winter there were the episodes of=
 the burning of=20

Portland; the capture of Montreal (later relinquished); the capture of Norf=
olk in December; Arnold's=20

heartbreaking expedition to Quebec through Maine forests in the dead of win=
ter; the battle of=20

Moore's Creek, N. C., early in 1776, called the "Southern Lexington," and, =
to crown all, the=20

evacuation of Boston. These events and their concomitants, say the historia=
ns, made inevitable=20

the Declaration of Independence, though the struggle began only as one for =
greater colonial self-

government and modification of the taxing system. It was our first "birth o=
f Freedom," which has=20

been re-born more than once since.  I said the date marked other great cris=
es in our history, and=20

take time to mention two of them, both in the memory of living men. The fir=
st, and the greater, was=20

in the midst of our Civil War, when the news of the twin victories of Getty=
sburg and Vicksburg=20

flashed over the land. Dark days were still to come, and men were still dis=
couraged; the war was=20

to be proclaimed a failure by a great political party, but the power of the=
 Rebellion was broken,=20

and, after July 4, 1863, the setbacks to the cause of nationality were but =
temporary usual for=20

stewing; and then with a little Salt and Pepper, with their own Liquor stew=
 them in a Sauce-Pan till=20

they are a little tender; then pour them into a Cullendar, and when they ar=
e drain'd well from the=20

Liquor, boil some White Wine, with Water, half one, and half the other, wit=
h whole Pepper; and=20

when the Liquor is cold, put the Cucumbers into a Gally-pot, and pour the L=
iquor over them: and, if=20

you put a little Oil upon the Liquor, I am persuaded they will keep several=
 Months. I wish it may be=20

try'd, for I have thought of it; and according to my Judgment it may be fit=
 to use, any time in the=20

Winter, for stewing.  When you use these, pour away all the Liquor, and let=
 them pass through a=20

Saucepan with a little Salt and Water, till they are tender, as you would h=
ave them; then drain=20

them again in a Cullendar, and fry them brown, with burnt Butter, first flo=
uring them, and a little=20

Pepper; and when they are enough, put in a Glass of Claret, or a Glass of W=
hite Wine.     _I am,=20

Your humble Servant._       S. F.     _Pippin_ Tart. From the same.  Cut so=
me golden Pippins in=20

halves, pare them, and take out the Cores; then stew them with half their w=
eight of Sugar, and=20

some Lemon-Peel, cut in thin long Slices, and Water enough to cover them. W=
hen they are clear,=20

they are enough; then set them by to cool, and strain off the Liquor, or Sy=
rup, and put that in a Pan=20

to stew gently, with some candy'd Lemon and Orange-Peel, in slices; then ha=
ve a sweet Paste=20

prepared in a Dish, and lay in your Pippins, and pour the Syrup, and Sweetm=
eats, over them, and=20

bake them in a gentle Oven; and when it is hot, pour some Cream=20


_
second great crisis was safely passed.  The third great Independence Day, g=
reat for what it=20

brought to others than ourselves, was thirty-five years later, when the tre=
mendous news came that=20

the Spanish squadron, practically all remaining efficient of Spain's navy, =
had been destroyed off=20

Santiago. That day marked the downfall of Spanish power on this continent, =
and the liberation of=20

oppressed peoples in both hemispheres; the culmination of a righteous war a=
gainst a civilized and=20

honorable foe, whose principal shortcoming was a hopelessly antiquated poin=
t of view and inability=20

to deal intelligently with modern conditions.  These great anniversaries al=
l marked the definite=20

passing of crises; the present one rather falls within a over them, and ser=
ve them to the Table.=20

To Pickle _Marygold-Flowers._ From Mr. _T._ of _Buckingham._  Though the Ma=
rygold Flower is=20

of old date in Pottage; yet it continues still its stand among the useful t=
hings of the Kitchen, and=20

cannot more easily be worn out, according to the custom of the Country, whe=
n the Country Folks=20

make Broth. Mint with Pease, Fennel with Mackarel, and such like, cannot be=
 forgot. And as the=20

Marygold-Flowers are used in Porridge, I send the Receipt how to pickle the=
m. Strip the Flower-

leaves off, when you have gather'd the Flowers, at Noon, or in the Heat of =
the Day, and boil some=20

Salt and Water; and when that is cold, put your Marygold-Flower Leaves in a=
 Gallypot, and pour=20

the Salt and Water=20


_
the passing of one. If we were to celebrate the anniversary of the greatest=
 crisis of recent times, I=20

should name July 18th, 1918, when, as most of those here will remember, the=
 glad peals of the=20

bell above us sounded the news that the great allied offensive had opened. =
Of this more in a few=20

minutes.  But July 4 as a date does not even mark the signing of the peace =
treaty. It is suggestive,=20

however, of two things to be borne in mind at this time: the genius of our =
country as a lover of=20

liberty and fair play, and the relation of that genius concretely to the pr=
oblems of the recent past,=20

and the present, and the immediate future.  The announcement of such a subj=
ect gives me pause,=20

for it is one for mature consideration and careful discussion by the best o=
f statesmen. But there=20

are some close till you use them, and they will be of a fine Colour, and mu=
ch fitter for Porridge=20

than those that are dry'd.    Seed-Cake. From the same.  Make some Paste of=
 fine Flour, such as=20

you would make for light Bread, with Yeast. Take five Pounds of this Dough,=
 Without Salt in it, and=20

cover it before a Fire for half an Hour, to make it rise; then take two Pou=
nds and a half of fresh=20

Butter melted, and five Eggs beaten well with half a Pound of fine _Lisbon_=
 Sugar. Mix these well=20

with your Paste, and work it till it is as light as possible; and when your=
 Oven is very hot and clean,=20

strew into your Cake a Pound of smooth Caraway Comfits; then put some Butte=
r on the Sides and=20

Bottom of your Pan, and put in your Cake, and one Hour and a quarter will b=
ake it. When it comes=20

out of the Oven,=20
