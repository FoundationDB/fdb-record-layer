all in that great big fire,=20

and to make the boys go away? But don't mind him, don't mind him, Ned Frank=
s. I'll work with you,=20

if they won't work. I can carry a brick all by myself!" and she suited the =
action to the word.=20

"There's a brave little lass!" said Franks, stooping to pat her curly head.=
 "You won't be daunted by=20

difficulties, nor bullied into baseness by a"--he stopped short; the sight =
of the still burning pile=20

recalled to him Persis's simile of the fire-ships. He felt the fierce glow =
rising hotter in his heart than=20

the flame from the branches which scorched his brow. He must not trust hims=
elf to say more, even=20

to the child, lest he should utter words which he might in vain desire to r=
ecall.  Ned returned to his=20

work, and labored with even greater energy than usual. Perhaps the strong e=
fforts of the arm=20

relieved the pressure on the spirits, or perhaps the hard blows which desce=
nded on pillar and post=20

were an outward expression of the struggle going on within, to strike down,=
 and then to keep=20

down, the stubborn passions of the natural heart.     XXXIII.  Watching for=
 Souls.   The evil effects=20

of Sir Lacy's residence at the Hall were soon seen in the village school. F=
ranks found that his boys=20

became less regular in attendance, and less respectful in manner. He more t=
han once, when=20

giving a serious reproof, heard, from a distant corner of the room a whispe=
r, in which "twaddle"=20

and "donkey's ears" were the only words to be distinguished. Few of his jov=
ial crew now ever=20

worked in Wild Rose Hollow; it was not the fashion to do so. Franks would s=
ee little rustics, instead=20

of engaging in healthful labor, sauntering about with their hands in their =
pockets and smoking. The=20

great ambition of the boys was to get a cigar; and half-used ones, thrown a=
way It is very sure that=20

they are nimble Messengers, for by experience it is found, that one of thes=
e Pigeons will fly three=20

Miles in a Minute, or from _St. Albans_ to _London_ in seven Minutes, which=
 has been try'd; and I=20

am inform'd, that they have been sent of a much longer Message: however, th=
ey might certainly=20

be made very useful in Dispatches, which required speed, if we were to trai=
n them regularly=20

between one House and another. We have an account of them passing and repas=
sing with=20

Advices between _Hirtius_ and _Brutus_, at the Siege of _Modena_, who had, =
by laying Meat for=20

them in some high Places, instructed their Pigeons to fly from place to pla=
ce for their Meat, having=20

before kept them hungry, and shut up in a dark Place. These are about the s=
ize of common=20

Pigeons, and of a dark blue or blackish Colour, which is one way of disting=
uishing them from other=20

sorts: they are also remarkable for having their Eyes compass'd about with =
a broad Circle of=20

naked spungy Skin, and for having the upper Chap of their Beak cover'd more=
 than half from the=20

Head with a double Crust of the like naked fungous Body. The Bill, or Beak,=
 is moderately long,=20

and black. These Birds are of that Nature, that tho' they are carried many =
Miles from the place=20

where they were bred, or brought up, or have themselves hatch'd, or bred up=
 any young ones,=20

they will immediately return home as soon as we let them fly. Perhaps this =
may, in some measure,=20

depend upon the Affection the Male or Female bear to one another. When they=
 are to be used as=20

Carriers, two Friends must agree to keep them, one in _London_, and the oth=
er at _Guilford_, or=20

elsewhere; the Person that lives at _Guilford_ must take two or three Cocks=
 or Hens that were=20

bred at his Friend's at _London_, and the other two or three that were bred=
 at _Guilford_; when=20

the good old invalid=20

Vicar of Colme, great the vexation of Mr. Leyton, his curate, when it was g=
iven out that Sir Lacy=20

would have a cricket-match every Sunday afternoon on his lawn, and treat th=
e boys to strong ale,=20

or, as it was rumored, to something stronger. The vicar and curate held anx=
ious consultations=20

together in the study, Paper, and tie it gently with a small String pass'd =
thro'it about the Pigeon's=20

Neck. But it must be observ'd before, that the Pigeons you design to send w=
ith a Message, be=20

kept pretty much in the dark, and without Meat, for eight or ten Hours befo=
re you turn them out,=20

and they will then rise and turn round till they have found their way, and =
continue their Flight till=20

they have got home. With two or three=20

 you will see here," said=20

the vicar, handing a letter to his nephew. "I have tried to write as temper=
ately as I could. But would=20

it not be well, Claudius, as you are the baronet's near relation, that you =
should go and speak to=20

him yourself on the subject? He may be rather careless than actually wicked=
. We know that=20

"'Evil is wrought       By want of thought     As well as by want of heart.=

his head sadly. "I have not a Correspondence might be carried on in a very =

that has set out on a Journey early in the Morning, where it was judged to =
