"Here are the horse's hoofs again, it seems, Athos," he said carelessly.  "Yes, indeed, the marks are recent."  _
of these efforts at throwing off the trammels of the past [Popery     and Ecclesiasticism] occurred. 

Hence the opposition of the losing     party, and their virulence against anything mysterious or 

unknown.     They freely organised pseudo-Rosicrucian and Masonic societies in     return; and 

these societies were instructed to irregularly entrap     the weaker brethren of the True and 

Invisible Order, and then     triumphantly betray anything they might be so inconsiderate as to 

communicate to the superiors of these transitory and unmeaning     associations. Every wile was 

adopted by the authorities, fighting     in self-defence against the progress of truth, to engage, by 

persuasion, interest or terror, such as might be cajoled into     receiving the Pope as Master--when 

gained, as many converts to that     faith know, but dare not own, they are treated with neglect, 

and     left to fight the battle of life as best they may, not even being     admitted to the knowledge 

of such miserable aporrheta as the     Romish faith considers itself entitled to withhold.   But if 

Masonry has been spoiled, none is able to crush the real, invisible Rosicrucian and the Eastern 

Initiate. The symbolism of Vishvakarma and Surya Vikarttana has survived, where Hiram Abiff was 

indeed murdered, and we Dame; could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos? Again, the 

moderate fortune which Athos possessed, concealed as it was, so skillfully, seemed to show a 

regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused. The clear 

and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man 

would be. He would enter into the minister's schemes with the more ardor, because his natural 

activity would be doubled by necessity.  Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on 

the following day, D'Artagnan, in spite of his fatigue, prepared for an attack and determined that it 

should take place after breakfast. He determined to cultivate the good-will of the youth Raoul and, 

either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting, to extract from his simplicity some information 

which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the present. But D'Artagnan at the 

same time, being a man of extreme caution, was quite aware what injury he should do himself, if 

by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of 

Athos. Besides, to tell truth, whilst D'Artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against 

the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos, he was ashamed to equivocate 


_
most solemn rite, an inheritance from the Archaic Mysteries that has crossed the ages and is used 

to this day. It typifies a whole drama of the Cycle of Life, of progressive incarnations, and of 

psychic as well as of physiological secrets, of which neither the Church nor Science knows 

anything, though it is this rite that has led the former to the greatest of its Christian Mysteries. 

SECTION XXX. THE MYSTERY "SUN OF INITIATION."   The antiquity of the Secret Doctrine 

may be better realised when it is shown at what point of history its Mysteries had already been 

desecrated, by being made subservient to the personal ambition of despot-ruler and crafty priest. 

These profoundly philosophical and scientifically composed religious dramas, in which were 

enacted the grandest truths of the Occult or Spiritual Universe and the hidden lore of learning, had 

become subject to persecution long before the days when Plato and even Pythagoras flourished. 

Withal, primal revelations given to Mankind have not died with the Mysteries; they are still 

preserved as heirlooms for future and more spiritual generations.  It has been already stated in 

_Isis Unveiled_,(511) that so far back as in the days of Aristotle, the great Mysteries had already 

lost their primitive grandeur and solemnity. Their rites had fallen into desuetude, and they had to a 

great degree degenerated into mere priestly speculations and had become religious shams. It is 

useless to state when they first appeared in Europe and Greece, since recognised history may 

almost be said to begin with Aristotle, everything before him appearing to be in an inextricable 

chronological confusion. Suffice it to say, that in Egypt the Mysteries had been known since the 

days of Menes, and that the Greeks received them only when Orpheus introduced them from 

India. In an article "Was writing known before Panini?"(512) it is stated that the Pandus had 

acquired universal dominion and had taught the "sacrificial" Mysteries to other races as far back 

as 3,300 B.C. Indeed, when Orpheus, the son of Apollo or Helios, true-hearted, open Athos. It 

seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy, 

they would like him all the better for it; but that Athos, on the contrary, would despise him.  "Ah! 

why is not Grimaud, the taciturn Grimaud, here?" thought D'Artagnan, "there are so many things 

his silence would have told me; with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence!"  There 

reigned a perfect stillness in the house. D'Artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters 

barred; the dogs became in their turn silent. At last a nightingale, lost in a thicket of shrubs, in the 

midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep. Not 

a sound was heard in the castle, except of a footstep up and down, in the chamber above--as he 

supposed, the bedroom of Athos.  "He is walking about and thinking," thought D'Artagnan; "but of 

what? It is impossible to know; everything else might be guessed, but not that."  At length Athos 

went to bed, apparently, for the noise ceased.  Silence and fatigue together overcame D'Artagnan 

and sleep overtook him also. He was not, however, a good sleeper. Scarcely had dawn gilded his 

window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows. Somebody, he perceived, 

was in the courtyard, moving stealthily. True to his custom of never passing anything over that it 

was within his power to know, D'Artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red 

coat and brown hair of Raoul.  The young man was opening the door of the stable. He then, with 

noiseless haste, took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening, saddled and 

bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen-garden, opened a side 

door which conducted him to a bridle road, shut it after him, and D'Artagnan saw him pass by like 

a dart, bending, as he went, beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia. The 



road, as D'Artagnan had observed, was the way to Blois.  "So!" thought the Gascon "here's a 

young blade who has already

lyre, symbolical of the sevenfold mystery of Initiation--these Mysteries were already hoary with age 

in Central Asia and India. According to Herodotus it was Orpheus who brought them from India, 

and Orpheus is far anterior to Homer and Hesiod. Thus even in the days of Aristotle few were the 

true Adepts left in Europe and even in Egypt. The heirs of those who had been dispersed by the 

conquering swords of various invaders of old Egypt had been dispersed in their turn. As 8,000 or 

9,000 years earlier the stream of knowledge had been slowly running down from the tablelands of 

Central Asia into India and towards Europe and Northern Africa, so about 500 years B.C. it had 

begun to flow backward to its old home affair, who doesn't at all agree with Athos in his hatred to 

the fair sex. He's not going to hunt, for he has neither dogs nor arms; he's not going on a 

message, for he goes secretly. Why does he go in secret? Is he afraid of me or of his father? for I 

am sure the count is his father. By Jove! I shall know about that soon, for I shall soon speak out to 

Athos."  Day was now advanced; all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened, one 

after the other. The bird on the branch, the dog in his kennel, the sheep in the field, the boats 

moored in the Loire, even, became alive and vocal. The latter, leaving the shore, abandoned 

themselves gaily to the current. The Gascon gave a last twirl to his 


_
birthplace. During the two thousand subsequent years the knowledge of the existence of great 

Adepts nearly died out in Europe. Nevertheless, in some secret places the Mysteries were still 

enacted in all their primitive purity. The "Sun of Righteousness" still blazed high on _the midnight 

sky_; and, while darkness was upon the face of the profane world, there was the eternal light in 

the Adyta on the nights of Initiation. The _true_ Mysteries were never hat with the sleeve of his 

doublet, and went downstairs. Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he 

saw Athos bent down toward the ground, as if he were looking for a crown-piece in the dust. 

"Good-morning, my dear host," cried D'Artagnan.  "Good-day to you; have you slept well?" 

"Excellently, Athos, but what are you looking for? You are perhaps a tulip fancier?"  "My dear 

friend, if I am, you must not laugh at me for being so. In

mystery God--mistaken by our Symbologists for the Sun--who was He? Everyone who has any 

idea of the ancient Egyptian exoteric faith is quite aware that for the multitudes Osiris was the Sun 

in Heaven, country people alter; one gets to like, without knowing it, all those beautiful objects that 

God causes to spring from the earth, which are despised in cities. I was looking anxiously for 

some iris roots I planted here, close to this reservoir, and which some one has trampled upon this 

morning. These gardeners are the most careless people in the world; in bringing the horse out to 

the water they've allowed him to walk over the border."  D'Artagnan began to smile.  "Ah! you think 

so, do you?"  And he took his
