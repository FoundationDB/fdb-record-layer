philodendron monstera golden crowns?"  "It is worth your promise to the chi=
ldren of Kisington, Your Majesty," said Harold. "It is a gift from them to =
your little Princess whose name is Hope. The children hope you will remembe=
r your promise to them."  "I am a King. I do not forget," said Red Rex haug=
htily.  "Nevertheless, Kings do forget sometimes," murmured Harold. "But th=
is reform of the Protestant religion, and for the addition of a fortieth ar=
ticle to the existing thirty-nine. If I can carry it through both Houses of=
 Parliament, all the convocations in Christendom cannot prevent the nation =
from accepting it as absolute divine truth; and I shall have the extreme sa=
tisfaction of feeling that I am manufacturing a creed for the philodendron =
monstera golden crowns?"  "It is worth your promise to the children of Kisi=
ngton, Your Majesty," said Harold. "It is a gift from them to your little P=
rincess whose name is Hope. The children hope you will remember your promis=

rtheless, Kings do forget sometimes," murmured Harold. "But this reform of =
the Protestant religion, and for the addition of a fortieth article to the =

all the convocations in Christendom cannot prevent the nation from acceptin=

 feeling that I am manufacturing a creed for the _

l Your Majesty promise=20

me one other thing, beside the truce, till my return?" begged Harold, looki=
ng up in his face with a=20

winning smile.  Red Rex frowned and tried to look very wicked and cruel.  "=
Well, what is it now?"=20

he growled.  "Promise me, Your Majesty, for the sake of your little dear da=
ughter, whose name is=20

Hope, that when you fight again you will spare that part of the city where =
the schoolhouse stands.=20

Robert and Richard and all my friends are there."  "What part of the city i=
s that?" asked Red Rex=20

sullenly.  "It is the west while the smoke loses itself in the depths of hi=
s thick beard, which he is=20

obliged to wear because of his delicate throat. There is a force and an eas=
e in his mode of dealing=20

with inspiration at such a moment which you feel must give him an immense a=
scendancy over the=20

native mind.  He possesses what may be termed a dry ecclesiastical humour, =
differing entirely=20

from Chundango's, whose theological fun takes rather the form of Scriptural=
 riddles, picked up=20

while he was a catechist. Neither he nor Broadhem smoke, so we had Wog and =
the Bishop to=20

ourselves for half an hour before going to bed. "You must come and=20


_
direction from that in which he had declared the Wonder-Garden to have been=
.  "Very well; I=20

promise," said the Red King. "_Noblesse oblige_."  Harold had no difficulty=
 in getting a lion-doll for=20

the Red King. Indeed, when they knew for what purpose it was intended, and =
what Harold had=20

gained by his clever winning of the promise from Red Rex, every child in to=
wn wanted to send his=20

or her lion-doll to the little princess, whose name was Hope.  They came to=
 Harold's home from all=20

parts of the city, bringing their dolls, until the High Street was crowded.=
 But the Librarian and the=20

Lord Mayor were unwilling to accept any of these, for none of them morning =
in Piccadilly to meet=20

my interesting friend Brother Chrysostom, my lord," said I.  I always like =
to give a bishop his title,=20

particularly a missionary bishop; it is a point of ecclesiastical etiquette=
 about which I have heard=20

that the propagators of Christianity were very particular.  "If you will al=
low me, sir, I will join the=20

party," said Mr Wog, before the Bishop could reply; "and as I don't know wh=
ere Piccadilly is, I'll just=20

ask the Bishop to bring me along. There is a good deal of law going on betw=
een your bishops just=20

now," our American friend went on, "and I should like to know the rights of=
 it. We in our country=20

consider that=20


_
fresh and new. Most of them had an arm or a leg dislocated, or bald spots o=
n their yellow fur;=20

which proved how fond the children were of these noble pets, how much they =
hugged and fondled=20

and frayed them.  The Lord Mayor himself went to the largest shop in Kising=
ton and in the name of=20

the children of Kisington purchased a royal lion-doll, nearly as big as a r=
eal baby lion, with a patent=20

voice inside which made it cry "_Gr-r! Gr-r!_" when you twisted its luxuria=
nt tail. And this was to be=20

the toy of the little Princess Hope.  With this wonderful toy under one arm=
 and a basket under the=20

other, which contained among Christian land. Why sir, law is strictly prohi=
bited in a certain place;=20

and it seems to me that you might as well talk of a good devil as a religio=
us court. If it is wrong for=20

a layman to go to law, it must be wrong for a bishop. What's sauce for the =
goose is sauce for the=20

gander; that proverb holds good in your country as well as mine, don't it?"=
  "The Ecclesiastical=20

Court is a court of discipline and doctrine rather than of law," said Dicki=
efield.  "Well, it's a court=20

anyhow you fix it; and your parsons must be a bad lot to want a set of lawy=
ers reg'larly trained to=20

keep them in order."  "Perhaps Parson Brownlow=20

library, Harold kissed his mother and went once more to the camp of Red Rex=
. He found the=20

monarch there alone, save for his bodyguard. His soldiers had gone to enjoy=
 themselves in the=20

neighboring woods, glad indeed of their continued holiday.  When Red Rex sa=
w the great lion-doll=20

he clapped his hands on kind," said the Bishop. "It seems to me that to be =
a minister of the Gospel=20

at one moment, a colonel at another, and the Governor of a State at a third=
, illustrates the abuses=20

which arise when such courts don't exist. With us, now, when a man once tak=
es orders, he=20

remains in them for the rest of his life."=20


_
and roared with laughter. And it was the first time Harold had heard the Wa=
r-Lord laugh,--a terrible=20

sound! But when Harold showed how to make the lion itself roar, by screwing=
 its tail, the Red King=20

fell over on his back and nearly died of laughing.  "Oh! Oh!" he cried, wip=
ing the tears from his=20

bronze cheeks. "How the little Princess will squeal when I twist that lion'=
s tail! How she will laugh=20

when she hears the creature roar!" And he went off in another fit.  Harold =
stood by grinning and=20

saying nothing.  The Red King took out a huge purse from his girdle. "And n=
ow, what shall I pay=20

you for this wonderful toy?" he asked. "I  "Even after he has concluded not=
 to obey them, eh?"=20

asked Mr Wog.  "Ah, Mr Wog," I interrupted, "before you return to the oil r=
egions, you must make=20

yourself acquainted with the enormous advantages connected with a State Chu=
rch. You must=20

grasp the idea that it is founded chiefly upon Acts of Parliament--that the=
 clergy are only a paid=20

branch of the Civil Service, exercising police functions of a very lofty an=
d important character. The=20

'orders' come from the Queen, the 'Articles' are interpreted by the Privy C=
ouncil, and 'England=20

expects every clergyman to do his duty.' As I think some of the late doctri=
nal decisions of the=20
