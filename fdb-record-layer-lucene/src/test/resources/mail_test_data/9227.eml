By W. T. Hornaday   Little Cyclone is a grizzly cub from Alaska, who earned=
 his name by the vigor=20

of his resistance to ill treatment. When his mother was fired at, on a timb=
ered hillside facing Chilkat=20

River, he and his brother ran away as fast as their stumpy little legs coul=
d carry them. When they=20

crept where they had last seen her, they thought her asleep; and cuddling u=
p close against her yet=20

warm body they slept peacefully until morning.  Before the early morning su=
n had reached their=20

side of the mountains, the two orphans were awakened by the rough grasp of =
human hands.=20

Valiantly they bit and scratched, and bawled aloud with rage. One of them m=
ade a fight so fierce=20

and terrible that his nervous captor let him go, and that one is still stat=
ely as ever.  You have seen=20

him before?"  "Yes," I said, turning away; "I have seen him--years ago."  "=
You have heard of his=20

marriage?"  I shook my head.  The clerk chuckled, rubbed his hands, and shr=
ugged his shoulders.=20

"An extraordinary affair," he said.  "Made a tremendous esclandre at the ti=
me.  He married his=20

mistress--quite a common, vulgar girl--a Genoese--very handsome; but not re=
ceived, of course.=20

Nobody visits her."  "Married her!" I exclaimed.  "Impossible."  "True, I a=
ssure you."  I put my hand=20

to my head.  I felt as if I had had a fall or a blow.  "Does she--does she =
go to-night?" I faltered.  "O=20

dear, yes--goes everywhere with him--never lets him out of her sight. You'l=
l see her--la bella=20

Duchessa!"  With this my informant=20

Although the other cub fought just as desperately, his captor seized him by=
 the hind legs, dragged=20

him backwards, occasionally swung him around his head, and kept him general=
ly engaged until=20

ropes were procured for binding him. When finally established, with collar,=
 chain and post, in the=20

rear of the saloon in Porcupine City, two-legged animals less intelligent t=

and violently prodded the little grizzly with a long pole to his office.  T=
he day went by, I scarcely=20

know how, except that my whole soul was in a tumult of rage and bitterness.=
  I returned from my=20

afternoon's work about 7.25, and at 10.30 I was once again at the station. =
 I had examined the=20

engine; given instructions to the Fochista, or stoker, about the fire; seen=
 to the supply of oil; and=20

got all in readiness, when, just as I was about to compare my watch with th=
e clock in the ticket-

office, a hand=20

scued by the friendly=20

hands of the Zoological Society's field agent, placed in a comfortable box,=
 freed from all=20

annoyance, and shipped to New York.  He was at that time as droll and rogui=
sh-looking a grizzly=20

cub as ever stepped. In a grizzly-gray full moon of fluffy hair, two big bl=
ack eyes laid upon my arm,=20

and a voice in my ear said:  "Are you the engine-driver who is going on wit=
h this special train?"  I=20

had never seen the speaker before.  He was a small, dark man, muffled up ab=
out the throat, with=20

blue glasses, a large black beard, and his hat drawn low upon his eyes.  "Y=
ou are a poor man, I=20

suppose," he said, in a quick, eager whisper, "and, like=20
