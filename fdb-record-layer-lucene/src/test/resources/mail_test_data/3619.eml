II. The Lost of Bleak, or in _August_ a much larger parcel in Shoals. These=
 Fish are soft, tender,=20

and oily, and much better than Sprats to make any imitation of Anchovies fr=
om. Take these, and=20

clean them, and cut off their Heads, and lay them in an earthen glazed Pan,=
 with a Layer of Bay-

Salt under them, and another over, a single Row of them; then lay a fresh r=
ow of Fish, and Bay-

Salt over that; and so continue the same _Stratum super Stratum_, till the =
Vessel is full, and in a=20

Month you may use them, and afterwards put Vinegar to them. But they will b=
e like Anchovies=20

without Vinegar, only the Vinegar will keep them. Turn them often the first=
 Fortnight.    _Apple-

Dumplings_ in an extraordinary way. From Mrs. _Johnson._  Take Golden-Renne=
ts ripe, pare=20

them, and take out their Cores; then cut the Apples into small pieces, and =
with a large Grater,=20

grate in a Quince, when it has been pared and cored: for if you was to slic=
e in a Quince, to your=20

Apples, in large pieces, the Quince would not be boil'd equally with the Ap=
ples; for the Quince is of=20

a tough Nature, and will not boil under twice the time that the Apples will=
: therefore to grate them,=20

will be enough to give their flavour to the Apple, and make all enough at o=
ne time. Put what Sugar=20

you think proper into each Dumpling, when you take it up, and the necessary=
 quantity of Butter. It=20

will then cat like a Marmalade of Quince.  _Note_, The Crust, or Paste, for=
 these Dumplings, must=20

be of a Puff-Paste made with Butter, rubb'd into Flour, and for some other =
Parts of the Butter,=20

break them into the Paste, and roll them three times, and put in the Apples=
 to the Crust, tying them=20

into a Cloth well=20
