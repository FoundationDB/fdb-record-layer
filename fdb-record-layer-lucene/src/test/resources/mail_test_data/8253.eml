 night and day, and with the impression among them that _

vated color sense and=20

a fine control over his instrument he was from first to last essentially an=
 illustrator. It was difficult=20

for him to omit any detail that would add to the piquancy or fulness of his=
 story, however much the=20

omission might have done for his general effect. He said himself, "There sh=
ould be no=20

unessentials for the artist," and he conditions. His report, made November =
11th, revealed the=20

military inefficiency almost inseparable from a post so neglected and ill-m=
anned, and subject to the=20

lazy peace conditions of the period. He said: =E2=80=9CThe unguarded state =
of the fort invites attack, if such=20

design exists, and much discretion and prudence are required on the part of=
 the commander to=20

restore the proper security without exciting a community prompt to=20


_
all. This passion for completeness rarely accompanies a strong feeling for =
the romantic aspects of=20

nature or for atmospheric subtleties. Neither does the painter who observes=
 human nature closely=20

and represents it with a detailed commentary upon its characteristics usual=
ly convey the=20

impression of any subjective emotion.  Menzel is no exception to this rule.=
 In his work he appears=20

as emotionless as a machine, but his accomplishment is not mechanical. It i=
s, on the contrary, the=20

record of a busy, highly individualized, accurate mind. A Berlin man, he ha=
d the alertness, the=20

clear-cut effectiveness, the energy, and the coldness typical of a cosmopol=
itan product. If we=20

compare his "Ball Supper" in which the glare of lights, the elaboration of =
costume, the rapacity and=20

shallow glittering superficiality of a Court festivity are presented almost=
 as though in hackneyed=20

phrases, so devoid is the picture of any meaning beyond the obvious, with t=
he "Steel Foundry" in=20

which the unsentimental acceptance of labor as a necessary factor in civili=
zation is conspicuous, it=20

is clear that his mind was free from dreams and visions whichever side of s=
ociety he looked upon.=20

In this respect his influence is salutary. It is like a cool and wholesome =
breeze blowing away all=20

miasmic vapors, and there is a positively exhilarating quality in his firm =
assumption of the power of=20

the human being over be effected by a proper commander without checking in =
the slightest the=20

progress of the engineer in completing the works of defence.=E2=80=9D Major=
 Porter continues with a most=20

significant phrase, =E2=80=9CAll could have been easily arranged a few week=
s since, when the danger was=20

foreseen by the present commander.=E2=80=9D[148]  November 15th, Anderson w=
as ordered to the=20

command. A Kentuckian by birth, his wife a Georgian, his views in sympathy =
with those of General=20

Scott, he appeared to be and, as results proved, was in many respects parti=
cularly fitted for the=20

post; by November 23d he was able to report that in two weeks the outer def=
ences of Moultrie=20

would be finished and the guns mounted, and that Sumter was ready for the c=
omfortable=20

accommodation of one company, and, indeed, for the temporary reception of i=
ts proper garrison.=20

=E2=80=9CThis,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cis the key to the entrance to thi=
s harbor; its guns command this work [Moultrie]=20

and could drive out its occupants. It should be garrisoned at once.... So i=
mportant do I consider the=20

holding of Castle Pinckney by the government that I recommend, if the troop=
s asked for cannot be=20

sent at once, that I be authorized to place an engineer detachment [of an o=
fficer and thirty=20

workmen] ... to make the repairs needed there.... If my force was not so ve=
ry small, I would not=20

hesitate to send a detachment at once to garrison that work. Fort Sumter an=

nt handling of the great=20

bars of metal with admiration as we should in life, and we note what in mod=
ern times is not always=20

present for notation, the intelligence and interest in their faces. In one =
corner of the room, behind a=20

screen or partition, a little group is devouring luncheon. Here we strike o=
nce more the note of the=20

ballroom supper in the munching eagerness of the eaters, but seen in juxtap=
osition with the=20

physical force and effort of the workers it ceases to be revolting, and see=
ms to symbolize the lusty=20

joy of living with a sympathetic zest of realization.  In all of Menzel's w=
ork we have this sense of=20

physical and mental competency. It shows nothing of the abnormal or decaden=
t, and it must also=20

be admitted that only in a few instances does it show anything of esthetic =
beauty. He was able to=20

paint crowds of people and he managed to get a remarkable unity of effect i=
n spite of his devotion=20

to detail, but his masses of light and shade are not held in that noble har=
monious relation achieved=20

by the peasant Millet who was Menzel's contemporary, his lines have no rhyt=
hmic flow, his color,=20

though often charming, is seldom held together in a unified tone. Some one =
has called him "the=20

conscience of German painting," but he is more than that. He is both consci=
ence and brain. It is=20

always possible to obtain an intellectual satisfaction from his point of vi=
ew. What is lacking is=20

emotion.  We feel this lack in other Berlin masters. Professor Max Lieberma=
nn is one of the most=20

distinguished of the modern group, garrisoned immediately if the government=
 determines to keep=20

command of this harbor.=E2=80=9D  Anderson proceeded to give advice which s=
ane judgment and every=20

sentiment of national honor demanded. After mentioning his anxiety to avoid=
 collision with the=20

citizens of South Carolina, he said: =E2=80=9CNothing, however, will be bet=
ter calculated to prevent=20

bloodshed than our being found in such an attitude that it would be madness=
 and folly to attack us.=20

There is not so much feverish excitement as there was last week, but that t=
here is a settled=20

determination to leave the Union, and obtain possession of this work, is ap=
parent to all.... The=20

clouds are threatening, and the storm may break upon us at any moment. I do=
, then, most=20

earnestly entreat that a reinforcement be immediately sent to this garrison=
, and that at least two=20

companies be sent at the same time to Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney.=E2=
=80=9D Anderson also stated=20

his belief that as soon as the people of South Carolina learned that he had=
 demanded=20

reinforcements they would occupy Pinckney and attack Moultrie; and therefor=
e it was vitally=20

important to embark the troops in war steamers and designate them for other=
 duty as a blind.[149]=20

Captain Foster, November 24th, reported the whole of the barbette tier of S=
umter ready for its=20

armament and as presenting an excellent appearance of preparation and stren=
gth equal to=20

seventy per cent. of its efficiency when finished.[150] He said, November 3=
0th, =E2=80=9CI think more troops=20

should have been sent here to guard the forts, and I believe that no seriou=
s demonstration on the=20

part of the populace would have met such a=20


_

xhibition by a portrait of=20

Dr. Bode, a vigorous little composition called "The Polo-players," the "Fla=
x Barn at Laren," and=20

"The Lace Maker." The last two were especially typical of his steady detach=
ment from his subject.=20

The old lace maker, bending over her bobbins, suggests only absorption in h=
er task. There is no=20

ennobling of her form, no idealizing of her features, no enveloping of her =
occupation with=20

sentiment, nothing but the direct statement of her personality which is nei=
ther subtle nor complex=20

and the description of what she is doing. But she is intensely real, more r=
eal, even, than Menzel's=20

, of course, well=20

known to the people of Charleston, and that at Moultrie, at least, subject =
to daily inspection by=20

many visitors. There was still no restriction =E2=80=9Cupon any intercourse=
 with Charleston, many of whose=20

citizens were temporary residents of Sullivan=E2=80=99s Island. The activit=
y about the fort drew to it a large=20

number of visitors daily, and the position of the garrison and the probable=
 action of the state in=20

regard to the forts were constant subjects of discussion. There was as yet =
no unfriendly feeling=20

manifested, and the social intercourse between the garrison and their frien=
ds in Charleston was=20

uninterrupted. But as the days went on the feeling assumed a more definite =
shape, and found=20

expression in many ways.... It was openly announced, both to the commanding=
 officer and to his=20
