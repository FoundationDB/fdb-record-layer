work harmoniously with the Council which was necessary for success.  At the=

Goochland was formed another new county came into being. This was described=

Caroline County." The name derives from Caroline of Anspach, Queen of Georg=
e II who had=20

succeeded his father, George I as King the year before. It will be recalled=
 that Queen Caroline=20

gave money to Thomas Lee to aid him in building "Stratford" when his former=
 house had been=20

burned by criminals whom he, as a magistrate, had sentenced for their misde=
eds. Caroline County=20

was not an expansion of settlements as most of the other counties had been =
for it was bounded=20

completely by already established governments. Its creation, however, was i=
n line with the thesis=20

already laid down "to make justice accessible to all", and made court atten=
dance more convenient=20

for dwellers in the northwest portions of Essex, King and Queen and King Wi=
lliam.  Three years=20

later, in 1731, a new county was created from the northwest portions of Sta=
fford and King George=20

River and a=20

southwest line to be made from the head of the north branch of the said cre=

 by this title,=20

William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the King's brother. He was later know=
n as "The Butcher of=20

Culloden" because of the ferocity of his treatment of the Scotch Highlander=
s after the battle of=20

Culloden in 1745. This battle, so sanguinary and devastating in its effects=
, wiped out the Stuart=20

sympathizers and there were no further attempts to depose the Hanoverian dy=
nasty from the=20

British throne. The county seat is Manassas, near which were   been left un=
changed. The Table of=20

Contents for this issue is correct.   This error is noted in an Addendum, F=

_
of the Civil War.   BRUNSWICK AND MIGRATION SOUTHWARD  In 1720, the Assembl=
y passed=20

an act to be effective in 1721, creating Spotsylvania County as has been me=
ntioned. At the same=20

time, there was an act to form a county from the southern part of Prince Ge=
orge County and name=20

it Brunswick for the Duchy of Brunswick which was then a possession of the =
Electorate of=20

Hanover. The description is as follows: that Brunswick County should begin =
"on the south side of=20

the River Roanoke at the place where the line lately run for ascertaining t=
he uncontroverted=20

bounds of this colony towards North Carolina intersects the said river Roan=
oke and to be bounded=20

by the direction of the governor with consent of council so as to include t=
he southern pass." No=20

steps were taken for carrying out this act because of the small number of s=
ettlers in the area, until=20

May 1732, when it was enacted that the earlier legislation become effective=
 the first of January=20

ADVERTISEMENT.  In the following plan of this Work, we trust it will be und=
erstood, that we do=20

not pledge ourselves that all the subjects mentioned shall be touched upon =
_in every Number_.=20

This is plainly impossible, unless every article should be very short and i=
mperfect. All that the=20

Public are entitled to expect is, that in the progress of the Journal, the =
various subjects mentioned=20

may occupy such an extent as our communications and resources shall permit.=
  We have been=20

honoured by such a list of names of gentlemen who are willing to be conside=
red as contributors to=20

this Journal, that the publication of it would afford us no ordinary gratif=
ication, did we not feel that it=20

is more decorous to allow their names to appear with their communications, =
without laying them=20

under a=20


_
Setting up the county government had been made possible by adding parts of =
Surry and Isle of=20

Wight, thus increasing the number of tithables and lessening the amount of =
taxes each would pay.=20

The preamble to the act expresses this thought in more precise phrase when =
it says "whereas by=20

reason of the small number of tithables in the county of Brunswick the poll=
 taxes must necessarily=20

be very grievous and burthensome to them, which by an addition of parts of =
the counties of Surry=20

and Isle of Wight would be remedied, and divers of the inhabitants of the t=
wo last mentioned=20

counties would thereby also be freed from hardships and inconveniences whic=
h at present they=20

labour under."  The reference to the line lately run "between Virginia and =
North Carolina" is the=20

famous survey made by Col. William Byrd, Major William Mayo, John Irvine an=
d others which=20

forms the subject of _The History of the Dividing Line_ written by Colonel =
Byrd. The Mayo River in=20

Patrick and Henry Counties perpetuates the name of Major Mayo, the skilled =
surveyor in the party.=20

The entire boundary was not surveyed then, in fact it was a good many years=
 later before it was=20

necessary to have a clear limit between the two colonies for the entire are=
a.  [Illustration: Virginia=20

his Journal is=20

intended to embrace the circle of THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES, with their applica=
tion to THE=20

ARTS, and to every useful purpose.  It is designed as a deposit for _origin=
al American=20

communications_; it will contain also occasional selections from Foreign Jo=
urnals, and notices of=20

the progress of Science in other countries. Within its plan are embraced  N=
ATURAL HISTORY, in=20

its three great departments of MINERALOGY, BOTANY, and ZOOLOGY.  CHEMISTRY =
and=20

NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, and their various branches: and MATHEMATICS, pure and m=
ixed.  It=20

will be a leading object to illustrate AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY, and especi=
ally our=20

MINERALOGY and GEOLOGY.  The APPLICATIONS of these sciences are obviously a=
s=20

numerous as _physical arts_, and _physical wants_; for no one of these arts=
 or wants can be=20

named which is not connected with them.  While SCIENCE will be cherished _f=
or its own sake_,=20

and with a due respect for its own _inherent_ dignity; it will also be empl=
oyed as the _hand-maid to=20

the Arts_. Its numerous applications to AGRICULTURE, the earliest and most =
important of them:=20

to MANUFACTURES, both mechanical and chemical; and, to DOMESTIC ECONOMY, wi=

 Journal to receive=20

communications likewise on MUSIC, SCULPTURE, ENGRAVING, PAINTING, and gener=
ally on=20
