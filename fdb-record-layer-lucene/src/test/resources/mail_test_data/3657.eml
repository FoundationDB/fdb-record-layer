It was a tall cross borne by a beadle. In the wake of the cross there came =
to view gorgeous ecclesiastics in pairs, and then a robed man walking backw=
ards and gesticulating in the manner of some important, excited official of=
 the Salvation Army; and after this violet robe arrived _
sympathy with it, I repeated the remark aloud. 'Yes, we'll have a delightfu=
l swim, you and I=20

together,' I said. 'A grand swim, my old lad'; and I clapped his back as I =
spoke, and encouraged=20

him, as I was in the habit of doing, to express his feelings without steamy=
 vibrations, and, as it=20

were, sudden escapes of gas; and comprehended that these were the hoarse re=
sponses of the 32=20

and 64 foot pipes, laid horizontally along the roof of the screen, to the s=
ummoning fingers of the=20

organist. It was all uncanny, weird,=20


_
But, rather to my surprise, instead of wagging his tail, and wrinkling his =
nose, and performing any=20

of his usual antics, the creature only lifted up his face and began to whin=
e. He had lain, for the=20

quarter of an hour while I had been resting, at the edge of the little clif=
f, with his head dropped over=20

it; but whether he had been taking a sleep in that position, or had been de=
moniacal if you will--it=20

was part of the secret and unsuspected mechanism of a vast emotional pagean=
t and spectacle. It=20

unnerved Priam, especially when the organist, a handsome youngish man with =
lustrous eyes, half=20

turned and winked at one of his companions.  The thrilling voices of the ch=
oristers grew louder,=20

and as they grew louder Priam Farll was conscious of=20


_
by watching the waves, was more than I knew. He was a capital one for sleep=
ing even then, and=20

generally made a point of snatching a doze at every convenient opportunity;=
 so I had naturally=20

troubled my head very little about him, taking it for granted that he was a=
t his usual occupation.=20

But, whether he had been asleep before or not, at any rate he was wide awak=
e now, and, as it=20

seemed to me, in a very odd humor indeed.  "'What's the matter, old fellow?=
' I said to him, when=20

he set up this dismal howl. 'Don't you want to have a swim? Well, you needn=
't unless you like, only=20

_I_ mean to have one; so down with you, and let me get my clothes off.' But=
, instead of getting=20

down, the creature began to conduct himself in the most incomprehensible wa=
y, first seizing me by=20

the trousers with his teeth and pulling me to the edge of the rock, as if h=
e wanted me to plunge in=20

dressed as I was; then catching me again and dragging me back, much as thou=
gh throat, which=20

shut and opened of itself convulsively. To divert his attention from his th=
roat, he partially rose from=20

the windsor chair, and peeped over the parapet of the screen into the choir=
, whose depths were=20

candlelit and whose altitudes were capriciously bathed by the intermittent =
splendours of the sun.=20

High, high up, in front of him, at the summit of a precipice of stone, a li=
ttle window, out of the=20

sunshine, burned sullenly in a gloom of complicated perspectives. And far b=
elow, stretched round=20

the pulpit and disappearing among the forest of statuary in the transept, w=
as a floor consisting of=20

the heads of the privileged--famous, renowned, notorious, by heredity, tale=
nt, enterprise, or=20

hazard; he had read many of their names in the _Daily Telegraph_. The voice=
s of the choristers=20

had become piercing in their beauty. Priam frankly stood up, and leaned ove=
r the parapet. Every=20

gaze was turned to a point under him which he could not=20
