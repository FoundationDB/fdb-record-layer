"Is that where the whistle cord is?" asked a man. "I was looking for a bell=
 cord."  The train backed=20

across the switch, and was soon on another track, and one not blocked by a =
disabled freight.=20

"Say," remarked Nat to Jack, "you're getting to be a regular railroad man."=
  "Well, I'm in a hurry to=20

get out to camp and take the trail," replied Jack. "That's why I'm helping =
'em run this road."=20

CHAPTER XV  JACK MEETS A GIRL   The train soon began to move forward again,=
 but it had to=20

proceed slowly, as it was on the wrong track, and a flagman had to precede =
it to prevent a=20

collision. It was tiresome traveling, and nearly every one grumbled--that i=
s, all save the boys. To=20

them the affair was novel enough to be interesting.  Finally they reached a=
nd passed the disabled=20

freight train. As they puffed past it a girl, who had come in from some car=
 ahead with an elderly=20

gentleman, took a seat with him just across from where Jack sat.  "There, d=
addy," said the girl in a=20

sweet, resonant voice that made Jack look up quickly, "there's the train th=
at made all the trouble.=20

Now we'll go more quickly."  "Are you sure, Mabel?" he asked.  "Why, yes, d=
addy. Didn't the=20

conductor say that as soon as we passed the broken freight train we would g=
et on our regular=20

track? You heard him."  "Yes, I know, but you can't always believe what the=
se railroad men tell=20

you. They'd say anything to keep a passenger quiet. I'm nervous riding in t=
hese cars. There may=20

be a collision when we're on the wrong track. Don't you think so?" he asked=
, turning to Jack.=20

"Why, no. I don't believe we're in any danger," replied our hero, and his h=
eart beat faster at the=20

grateful look which the pretty girl flashed at him from her brown eyes. "Th=
ere is a flagman ahead=20

of us, and we'll soon be on the right track. There is no danger."  "I'm sur=
e I hope so," went on the=20

aged man. "I'm not used to this way of traveling. A wagon, a horse, or hitt=
ing the trail for mine. I=20

came out of the front car, because I thought it would be safer here in case=
 of a collision. Don't you=20

think so?" he asked anxiously.  "Of course," answered Jack reassuringly, an=
d again the girl looked=20

gratefully at him.  "My name's Pierce," went on the timid man. "Dan Pierce.=
 What's yours?"  "Oh,=20

daddy!" exclaimed the girl. "Perhaps the young gentleman doesn't want to te=
ll his name."  "Why=20

shouldn't he?" asked Mr. Pierce quickly. "Every one ought to be proud of hi=
s name. I'm proud of=20

mine. Dan Pierce it is. I'm an old Western hunter, and this is my daughter =
Mabel. We've been East=20

on a visit, and we're going back. I'm glad of it, too. What's your name?" h=
e went on.  "Father,"=20

expostulated the girl, "perhaps he doesn't wish to tell."  "Oh, I haven't t=
he least objection,"=20

answered our hero. "I'm Jack Ranger, and these are some friends of mine."  =
"I'd like to know 'em,"=20

said Mr. Pierce quickly, and Jack introduced the boys, the old hunter, in t=
urn, presenting his me:=20

"Mr. Moody, I would give the world if I had your faith, your consolation, t=
he hope you have with=20

your religion."  Isn't that a proof that their rock is not as our Rock?  So=
me years ago I went into a=20

man's house, and when I commenced to talk about religion he turned to his d=
aughter and said:=20

"You had better leave the room. I want to say a few words to Mr. Moody." Wh=
en she had gone, he=20

opened a perfect torrent of infidelity upon me. "Why did you send your daug=
hter out of the room=20

before you said this?" I asked. "Well," he replied, "I did not think it wou=
ld do her any good to hear=20

what I said."  Is his rock as our Rock? Would he have sent his daughter out=
 if he really believed=20

what he said?  NO CONSOLATION EXCEPT IN GOD.  No. There is no satisfaction =
for the soul=20

except in the God of the Bible. We come back to Paul's words, and get conso=
lation for time and=20

eternity:--"We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is=
 none other God but one.=20

For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (a=
s there be gods many,=20

and lords many,) yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are al=
l things, and we in Him;=20



and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him."  My frie=
nd, can you say that=20

sincerely? Is all your hope centred on God in Christ? Are you trusting Him =
alone? Are you ready to=20

step into the scales and be weighed against this first commandment?  WHOLE-=
HEARTED=20

ALLEGIANCE.  God will not accept a divided heart. He must be absolute monar=
ch. There is not=20

room in your heart for two thrones. Christ said: "No man can serve two mast=
ers; for either he will=20

hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despis=
e the other. Ye cannot=20

serve God and Mammon." Mark you, He did not say--"No man _shall_ serve. . .=
 . Ye _shall_ not=20

serve. . . .", but "No man _can_ serve. . . . Ye _can_ not serve. . . ." Th=
at means more than a=20

command; it means that you cannot mix the worship of the true God with the =
worship of another=20

god any more than you can mix oil and water. It cannot be done. There is no=
t room for any other=20

throne in the heart if Christ is there. If worldliness should come in, godl=
iness would go out.  The=20

road to heaven and the road to hell lead in different directions. Which mas=
ter will you choose to=20

follow? Be an out-and-out Christian. "Him only shalt thou serve." Only thus=
 can you be well=20

pleasing to God. The Jews were punished with seventy years of captivity bec=
ause they=20

worshipped false gods. They have suffered nearly nineteen hundred years bec=
ause they rejected=20

the Messiah. Will you incur God's displeasure by rejecting Christ too? He d=
ied to save you. Trust=20

him with your whole heart, for with the heart man believeth unto righteousn=
ess.  I believe that=20

when Christ has the first place in our hearts--when the kingdom of God is f=
irst in everything--we=20

shall have power, and we shall not have power=20


_
blushed more than ever. But Jack thought her ever so much prettier when the=
 color surged up into=20

her brown, olive-tinted cheeks.  "Going far?" asked Mr. Pierce.  "We're tak=
ing a hunting trip to the=20

Shoshone Mountains," replied Jack.  "You don't say so? Why, that's where I =
lived and hunted for=20

forty years!" exclaimed Mr. Pierce. "That's where me and my daughter live. =
About ten miles from=20

Pryor's Gap. But my hunting days are over," he said a bit sadly. "I have to=
 settle down now and=20

live in a house with Mabel here."  Jack thought that was not at all a bad a=
rrangement, and he stole=20

a glance at the girl. He caught her looking at him, and he felt the blood m=
ounting to his face, while=20

he saw the blush spread again over her cheeks.  "How long are you going to =
stay?" asked Mr.=20

Pierce.  Then Jack told of the formation of the gun club, and how it happen=
ed that they had a=20

chance to come West on a late fall hunting trip.  "It makes me feel young a=
gain," declared Mr.=20

Pierce as his eyes lighted up. "I declare, I've a good notion to hit the tr=
ail again."  "Oh, you mustn't=20

think of that, daddy!" exclaimed Mabel. "Remember, you promised me you woul=
d stay home now=20

and rest."  "Rest? I guess you mean rust," said Mr. Pierce, his deep-set ey=
es sparkling with fun. "I=20

sure would like to hit the trail again."  "We would be very glad to have yo=
u come along with us,"=20

said Jack. "We have plenty of shelter tents, and lots of grub."  "I'd like =
it--I'd like it," said Mr. Pierce=20

musingly. some false god come in and steal our love away from the God of he=
aven, we shall have=20

no peace or power.    Second Commandment  "Thou shalt not make unto thee an=
y graven image,=20

or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the ear=
th beneath, or that is in the=20

water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve t=
hem: for I the Lord thy=20

God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the childre=
n unto the third and=20

fourth generation of them that hate Me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of=
 them that love Me,=20

and keep My commandments."  The first commandment, which we have just consi=
dered, points=20

out the one true object of worship; this commandment is to tell us the righ=
t way in which to=20

worship. The former commands us to worship God alone; this calls for purity=
 and spirituality as we=20

approach Him. The former condemns the worship of false gods; this prohibits=
 false forms. It=20

relates more especially to outward acts of worship; but these are only the =
expression of what is in=20

the heart.  Perhaps you will say that there is no trouble about this weight=
. We might go off to other=20

ages or other lands, and find people who make images and bow down to them; =
but we have none=20

here. Let us see if this is true. Let us step into the scales and see if we=
 can turn them when=20

weighed against this commandment.  I believe this is where the battle is fo=
ught. Satan tries to=20

keep us from worshipping God aright, and from making=20


_
"Daddy!" expostulated his daughter.  She shot a somewhat indignant glance a=
t Jack for proposing=20

such a thing, but she was not angry.  "There, there, Mabel, of course I won=
't go," said her father.=20

"I'll stay home. My hunting days are over, I reckon, but I sure would like =
a chance to wrassle with a=20

bear or draw a bead on a mule deer or a fine big-horn sheep. Say, if you bo=
ys ever get near=20

Pryor's Gap I'll feel mortal offended if you don't stop off and see us."  "=
We'll stop," promised Jack=20

heartily, and he looked into Mabel's eyes, whereat she blushed again, and J=
ack felt his heart=20

strangely beating.  "Masquerading mud-turtles! but that's a If I let some i=
mage made by man get=20

into my heart and take the place of God the Creator, it is a sin. I believe=
 that Satan is willing to=20

have us worship anything, however sacred,--the Bible, the crucifix, the chu=
rch,--if only we do not=20

worship God Himself.  You cannot find a place in the Bible where a man has =
been allowed to bow=20

down and worship any one but the God of heaven and Jesus Christ His Son. In=
 the Book of=20

Revelation, when an angel came down to John, he was about to fall down and =
worship him, but=20

the angel would not let him. If an angel from heaven is not to be worshippe=
d, when you find people=20

bowing down to pictures, to images,=20


_
Nat, who was looking from a window. "You can see fifty miles, I'll wager." =
 Mabel laughed heartily.=20

"What a funny expression!" she said. "Where did you get it?"  "Oh, he makes=
 them up as he goes=20

along," explained Jack, while Nat was in some confusion.  "It must be some =
tiresome," observed=20

Mr. Pierce, while his eyes twinkled humorously. "But we sure do have fine v=
iews out here. You=20

needn't be in a hurry to look at 'em. There's plenty where you're going. Bu=
t I meant to ask you=20

boys how do you calculate to travel after you get to Fort Custer? I believe=
 you said you were going=20

there first."  "We are," worship the cross, _it is a sin_. There are a grea=
t many who seem to be=20

carried away with these things. "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me." =
"Thou shalt not bow=20

down thyself to any graven image." God wants us to worship Him only, and if=
 we do not believe=20

that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh we should not worship Him. I=
 have no more doubt=20

about the divinity of Christ than I have that I exist.  Worship involves tw=
o things: the internal belief,=20

and the external act. We transgress in our hearts by having a wrong concept=
ion of God and of=20

Jesus Christ before ever we give public expression in=20


_
to Sage Creek and across Forty-mile Desert."  "That's a good route," observ=
ed Mr. Pierce. "Who=20

was you depending on to tote your stuff across the desert?"  "Why, a man na=
med Isaac Blender,"=20

answered Jack. "I wrote to him on the advice of my father, who heard of him=
 through As some one=20

has said, it is wrong to have loose opinions as well as to be guilty of loo=
se practices. That is what=20

Paul meant when he said: "We ought not to _think_ that the Godhead is like =
unto gold or silver or=20

stone, graven by art or man's device." The opinions that some=20
