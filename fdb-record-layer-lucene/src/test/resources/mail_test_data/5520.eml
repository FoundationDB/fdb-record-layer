slaughtered. Here they are. Look 'em over and don't overlook the hands that=
 killed them.  In 1921=20

there were 19,625 business failures as compared with 6,451 in 1919, or an i=
ncrease of 13,174--

more than three for one. And the liabilities reached the stupendous total o=
f $627,401,000, an=20

increase of $514,000,000 over 1919, more than five for one. In the so-calle=

the high tide of business failures, liabilities were only $197,000,000, as =
against $627,000,000 in=20

1921. Why, if 1907 was a "panic year," 1921 was a pandemic year!  And here =
is another=20



destruction meter, absolutely infallible--the suicides. In the first six mo=
nths of 1921 there were=20

4,527 men suicides, as against 1,810 for the same period in 1920; 1,982 wom=
en as against 961;=20

214 boys as against 88 and 293 girls as against 137--7,016 suicides for the=
 first six months of=20

1921 as against 2,996 for the same period of 1920. The enormous increase in=
 men suicides--over=20

two and one-half for one--tells its own story. They came from all classes, =
bankers, merchants,=20

farmers, laborers and professional men. None know how many of this enormous=
 increase, the=20

largest since statistics have been kept, were driven to desperation and to =
death from hunger, from=20

unemployment, from the loss of life's toil or from the failure of enterpris=
es in which they had spent=20

their lives. No statistics can summarize human emotions, but they can tell =
and they do tell of the=20

greatest holocaust of suicides ever ravaging this land--undoubtedly due to =
industrial tragedies=20

staged by the cold blooded butchery of production. This much is certain. Ne=
ver before in a given=20

time in this land has there been such a holocaust of failures, of suicides =
and of unemployment.=20

Never before in this land were such sacrifices laid on the twin altars of M=
oloch and of Mammon.=20

And they precisely correspond in time with the Tragedy of Drastic Deflation=
!  During all this time=20

and particularly beginning with the late summer and early fall of 1920, ind=
ividuals, associations,=20

committees and organizations representing farmers, planters, cattlemen, man=
ufacturers, bankers=20

and merchants--in short, representatives of all industries--were entreating=
 and beseeching=20

Governor Harding of the Federal Reserve Board and his associates to be more=
 mild and more=20

lenient and more reasonable in their drastic tragedy of destruction. They m=
ight as well have=20

besought a cyclone or entreated a tornado or prayed to an earthquake. Cold-=
bloodedly,=20

relentlessly and wantonly loans were called, extensions were refused, renew=
als were tabooed and=20

bank credit put on the chopping block. The very people whose toil and whose=
 labor and whose=20

real wealth were building the magnificent palaces wherein these Shylockerie=
s were housed and=20

were paying the exorbitant salaries of these money despots were being ruine=
d by their servants!=20

The Federal Reserve System at that very time had a loaning ability of over =
$2,000,000,000 more=20

than it then used and not only wouldn't use it, but contracted its loans by=
 $2,005,149,000 and=20

currency by over $932,000,000. Instead of aiding production, it throttled i=
t. And instead of aiding=20

the producers of commodities to carry them it forced producers to market th=
em at most ruinous=20

losses! Instead of dropping the curtain on this Tragedy of Drastic Destruct=
ion, it ran it to its close! It=20

staged the greatest debacle of blasted credit, number of failures, magnitud=
e of liabilities, suicides=20

and unemployment ever witnessed in this land. It did it deliberately, ruthl=
essly and as per program=20

too.  Go back over these figures, all taken from official records--all unde=
nied and undeniable--and=20

ask widely different points of view of Englishmen and Americans, we must ex=
amine their systems=20

of representative government.  In electing members to the House of Commons =
in England certain=20

ancient counties and boroughs were entitled to representation, each sending=
 two members,=20

regardless of the number of people within its territory. For a century and =
a half before the=20

American Revolution only four new members were added to the fixed number in=
 Parliament.=20

Meanwhile, great cities had grown up which had no representation, though ce=
rtain boroughs, once=20

very properly represented, had become uninhabited, and the lord who owned t=
he ground elected=20

the members to Parliament, taking them, not from the district represented, =
but from any part of the=20

kingdom. The franchise was usually possessed either by the owners of the fa=
vored pieces of land=20

or in the boroughs chiefly by persons who inherited certain rights which ma=
rked them as freemen.=20



A man had as many votes as there were constituencies in which he possessed =
the qualifications.=20

In the colonial assemblies there was a more distinct territorial basis for =
representation, and=20

changes of population brought changes of representation. New towns sent new=
 members to the=20

provincial assembly, and held the right to be of great value. All adult men=
--even negroes in New=20

England--owning a certain small amount of property could vote for these mem=
bers. In the South=20

only the landholders voted, but the supply of land was not limited, as in E=
ngland, and it was easily=20

acquired. Finally, the voter and the representative voted for must, as a ru=
le, be residents of the=20

same district. From the first the colonial political ideals were affected b=
y new conditions. When=20

they established representative government they had no historic places sanc=
tified by tradition to=20

be the sole breeding-places of members of Parliament.  Backed by such diver=
gent traditions as=20

these, the two parts of the British empire, or, more accurately, the domina=
nt party in each section=20

of the empire, faced each other upon a question of principle. Neither could=
 believe in the honesty=20

of the other, for each argued out of a different past. The opponents of the=
 Stamp Act could not=20

understand the political thinking which held them to be represented in the =
British Parliament. =E2=80=9CNo=20

taxation without representation=E2=80=9D meant for the colonist that taxes =
ought to be levied by a legislative=20

body in which was seated a person known and voted for by the person taxed. =
An Englishman only=20

asked that there be =E2=80=9Cno taxation except that voted by the House of =
Commons.=E2=80=9D He was not=20

concerned with the mode of election to that house or the interests of the p=
ersons composing it.=20

The colonists called the Stamp Act tyranny, but the British government cert=
ainly intended none, for=20

it acted upon the theory of virtual representation, the only kind of repres=
entation enjoyed by the=20

great mass of Englishmen either at home or in the colonies. On that theory =
nothing was taxed=20

except by the consent of the virtual representatives of those taxed. But, r=
eplied an American, in=20

England the interests of electors and non-electors are the same. Security a=
gainst any oppression=20

of non-electors lies in the fact that it would be oppressive to electors al=
so; but Americans have no=20

such safeguard, for acts oppressive to them might be popular with English e=
lectors.[56]  When the=20

news of the Stamp Act first came oversea there was apparent apathy. The day=
 of enforcement=20

was six months away, and there was nothing to oppose but a law. It was the =
fitting time for an=20

agitator. Patrick Henry, a gay, unprosperous, and unknown country lawyer, h=
ad been carried into=20

the Virginia House of Burgesses on the public approval of his impassioned d=
enial, in the =E2=80=9CParson=E2=80=99s=20

Cause=E2=80=9D (1763), of the king=E2=80=99s right to veto a needed law pas=
sed by the colonial legislature. He now=20

offered some resolutions against the stamp tax, denying the right of Parlia=
ment to legislate in the=20

internal affairs of the colony.[57] This =E2=80=9Calarum bell to the disaff=
ected,=E2=80=9D and the fiery speech which=20

secured its adoption by an irresolute assembly, were applauded everywhere. =
Jefferson said of=20

Henry, that he =E2=80=9Cspoke as Homer wrote.=E2=80=9D  As soon as the name=
s of the appointed stamp-

distributers were made known (August 1, 1765) the masses expressed their di=
spleasure in a way=20

unfortunately too common in America. Throughout the land there was rifling =
of stamp-collectors=E2=80=99=20

houses, threatening their lives, burning their records and documents, and e=
ven their houses. Their=20

offices were demolished and their resignations compelled--in one case under=
 a hanging effigy,=20

suggestive of the result of refusal. The more moderate patriots cancelled t=
heir orders with British=20

merchants, agreed not to remit their English debts, and dressed in homespun=
 to avoid wearing=20

imported clothes.  On the morning that the act went into effect (November 1=
, 1765) bells tolled the=20

death of the nation. Shops were shut, flags hung at half-mast, and newspape=

ed them and the=20

governors sanctioned their omission. None could be used, because none could=
 be obtained. All=20

America endorsed the declaration of rights of the Stamp-Act Congress, which=
 met in New York,=20

October, 1765. It asserted that the colonists had the same liberties as Bri=
tish subjects.=20

Circumstances, they declared, prevented the colonists from being represente=
d in the House of=20

Commons, therefore no taxes could be levied except by their respective legi=
slatures.[58]  This=20

great ado was a complete surprise to the British government. On the passage=
 of the Stamp Act,=20

Walpole had written,[59] =E2=80=9CThere has been nothing of note in Parliam=
ent but one slight day on the=20

American taxes.=E2=80=9D That expressed the common conception of its import=
ance; and when the=20

Grenville ministry fell (July, 1765), and was succeeded by that of Rockingh=
am, the American=20

situation had absolutely nothing to do with the change. The new ministry wa=
s some months in=20

deciding its policy. The king was one of the first to realize the situation=
, which he declared =E2=80=9Cthe=20

most serious that ever came before Parliament=E2=80=9D (December 5, 1765). =
Weak and unwilling to act as=20

the new ministry was, the situation compelled attention. The king at first =
favored coercion of the=20

rebellious colonies, but the English merchants, suffering from the suspende=
d trade, urged=20

Parliament to repeal the act. Their demand decided the ministry to favor re=
traction, just as formerly=20

their influence had forced the navigation laws and the restrictions on colo=
nial manufactures. If the=20

king and landed gentry were responsible for the immediate causes of the Rev=
olution, the influence=20

of the English commercial classes on legislation was the more ultimate caus=
e.  After one of the=20

longest and most heated debates in the history of Parliament, under the adv=
ice of Benjamin=20

Franklin, given at the bar of the House of Commons,[60] and with the powerf=
ul aid of Pitt and=20

Camden, the Stamp Act was repealed. Another act passed at the same time ass=
erted Parliament=E2=80=99s=20

power to legislate for the colonies in all cases whatsoever.[61] Thus the f=
irebrand was left=20

smouldering amid the inflammable colonial affairs; and Burke was quick to p=
oint out that the right=20

to tax, or any other right insisted upon after it ceased to harmonize with =
prudence and expediency,=20

would lead to disaster.[62]  It is plain to-day that the only way to keep u=
p the nominal union=20

between Great Britain and her colonies was to let them alone. The colonies =
felt strongly the ties of=20

blood, interest, and affection which bound them to England.[63] They would =
all have vowed, after=20

the repeal of the Stamp Act, that they loved their parent much more than th=
ey loved one another.=20

They felt only the normal adult instinct to act independently. Could the Br=
itish government have=20

given up the imperial idea to which it so tenaciously clung, a federal unio=
n might have been=20

preserved.  The genius of dissolution, however, gained control of the minis=
try which next came=20

into power. When illness withdrew Pitt from the =E2=80=9CMosaic Ministry,=
=E2=80=9D which he and Grafton had=20

formed, Townshend=E2=80=99s brilliant talents gave him the unquestioned lea=
d. This man, who is said to=20

have surpassed Burke in wit and Chatham in solid sense, determined to try a=
gain to tax the=20

colonies for imperial purposes.[64] He ridiculed the distinction between ex=
ternal and internal tax;=20

but since the colonists had put stress on the illegality of the latter he l=
aid the new tax on imported=20

articles, and prepared to collect at the customhouses. The income was to pa=
y the salaries of=20

colonial governors and judges, and thus render them independent of the tyra=
nnical and=20

contentious assemblies. Writs of assistance, so effective in enforcing the =
revenue laws but so=20

hated by the colonists, were legalized. The collection of the revenue was f=
urther aided by=20



admiralty courts, which should try the cases without juries, thus preventin=
g local sympathy from=20

shielding the violators of the law.[65]  All the indifference into which Am=
erica had relapsed, and=20

which the agitators so much deplored, at once disappeared. The right of tri=
al by jury was held to=20

be inalienable. The control of the judiciary and executive by the people wa=
s necessary to free=20

government, asserted the pamphleteers. Parliament could not legalize =E2=80=
=9Cwrits of assistance,=E2=80=9D they=20

rashly cried. The former stickling at an internal tax was forgotten, and th=
ey objected to any tax=20

whatever--a more logical position, which John Dickinson, of Pennsylvania, s=
upported by the=20

assertion =E2=80=9Cthat any law, in so far as it creates expense, is in rea=
lity a tax.=E2=80=9D Samuel Adams drew up=20

a circular letter, which the Massachusetts assembly dispatched to the other=
 colonial assemblies,=20

urging concerted action against this new attack on colonial liberties.[66] =
The British government,=20

through the colonial governors, attempted to squelch this letter, but the M=
assachusetts assembly=20

refused to rescind, and the other colonies were quick to embrace its cause.=
  Signs were not=20

wanting that the people as well as the political leaders were aroused. When=
 the customs officials,=20

in 1768, seized John Hancock=E2=80=99s sloop _Liberty_ for alleged evasion =
of the customs duties, there=20

was a riot which so frightened the officers that they fled to the fort and =
wrote to England for=20

soldiers.  This and other acts of resistance to the government led Parliame=
nt to urge the king to=20

exercise a right given him by an ancient act to cause persons charged with =
treason to be brought=20

to England for trial. The Virginia assembly protested against this, and sen=
t their protest to the other=20

colonies for approval.[67] The governor dissolved the assembly, but it met =
and voted a non-

importation agreement, which also met favor in the other colonies. This eco=
nomic argument again=20

proved effective, and the Townshend measures were repealed, except the tax =
on tea; Parliament=20

thus doing everything but remove the offence--=E2=80=9Cfixing a badge of sl=
avery upon the Americans=20

without service to their masters.=E2=80=9D[68] The old trade regulations al=
so remained to vex the colonists.=20

In order that no disproportionate blame may be attached to the king or his =
ministry for the bringing=20

on of the Revolution, it must be noted that the English nation, the Parliam=
ent, and the king were all=20

agreed when the sugar and stamp acts were passed; and though Parliament mus=
tered a good-

sized minority against the Townshend acts, nevertheless no unaccustomed inf=
luence in its favor=20

was used by the king. Thus the elements of the cloud were all gathered befo=
re the king=E2=80=99s=20

personality began to intensify the oncoming=20


_
history the industries and credit of a successful nation and successful in =
the greatest War ever=20

waged, too, were so butchered? These figures indict and convict the Federal=
 Reserve System, as=20

it has been maladministered, as the arch betrayer of a people's trust. It i=
ndicts and convicts them=20

as juggling with the symbols of value to the destruction of real values. No=
 sane man can read this=20

record, frozen into Government statistics, and defend the oligarchs who mad=
e it. It never was=20

"deflation." That is just a sonorous euphemism to disguise sandbaggery. It =
was destruction to=20

scores of thousands and to hundreds of thousands of the real producers of r=
eal wealth. Billions of=20

dollars of real values were annihilated, not by the trend of the markets, b=
ut by artificial "bear"=20

markets artificially created by the throttling of credit. You can't withdra=
w literally billions of credit=20

and currency--almost three billions of them--the very life-blood of commerc=
e from industry and=20

have it thrive any more than you can tap a man's jugular vein and have him =
live! That's what really=20

happened in this Tragedy of Drastic Destruction.  And upon whom did this Tr=
agedy bear the=20

hardest? Upon those least able to endure its fearful pressure--the farmers.=
 Bear in mind that=20

farming is not only the largest industry in the U.S.A., but it is the only =
absolutely basic industry--the=20

keystone upon which rests the entire industrial superstructure.  Here is wh=
at this Tragedy of=20

Drastic Deflation did to the farmer as measured for the years of 1919, 1920=
 and 1921.    Value in=20

1919   $13,500,000,000   Value in 1920     9,000,000,000   Value in 1921   =
  5,675,000,000  In=20

each of these years there was practically the same acreage under cultivatio=
n, 350,000,000 acres.=20

In 1919, farm products were worth $39 per acre, in 1920, $26 per acre and i=
n 1921, $16 per acre.=20

Here is where the Federal Reserve credit crusher pulpified the finest--at t=
he very foundation of all=20

industry! The production of these basic farm products--the real foundation =
of all this Federal=20

Reserve splendor--was practically the same in volume for these three years,=
 but the Federal=20

Reserve credit crusher crushed it from $39 to $26 to $16 per acre measured =
by its purchasing=20

value! That's the Tragedy of Drastic Deflation in its final analysis batter=
ing down the money value=20

of America's basic industry almost two-thirds! But the profits of the Feder=
al Reserve System--and=20

its exorbitant expense account and its lavish salary rolls--kept off the to=
boggan down which slid all=20

the others!     CHAPTER X  THE PALACES OF THE MONSTER   FEDERAL Reserve Oli=
garchy=20

houses itself most palatially. There is nothing in Government annals or in =
corporate prodigality=20

private or public to anywhere approximate the absolute squandermania of Fed=
eral Reserve=20

obsession for luxurious quarters.  If you want in your city a Post Office B=
uilding, a Federal Court=20

Building or a Custom House Building you must lobby and beseech and petition=
 and "trade" and=20

pull wires in Congress until you do--or don't--get it. But it's different w=
ith Federal Reserve satraps.=20

By merely a Federal Reserve ukase or decree or resolution or order an Aladd=
in's Palace arises=20

like magic--paid for by your money. No such squandermaniac obsession has ev=
er before been=20

seen in this country in prodigality of buildings, in luxuriance of equipmen=
t or in splendor of=20

quarters. And not only that, but the speed with which enormous sums have be=
en "charged off"=20

from building accounts is absolutely appalling. Take a look at some of the =
items of this profligacy.=20

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank bought a building for $600,000 and sp=
ent in "remodeling"=20

it $1,099,638, making a total cost to September 30, 1921, of $1,699,638, an=
d then "charged off" to=20

"depreciation allowance" the enormous sum of $1,166,848! In other words, af=
ter spending=20

$1,099,638 in "remodeling" its building it "charges off" for "depreciation"=
 $1,166,848, or $67,210=20

more than it cost to "remodel" it! So that after spending $1,099,638 on "re=
modeling" the whole=20



property is worth only $532,790, or $67,210 less than it cost before "remod=
eling." Either=20

Philadelphia real estate depreciates with lightning-like rapidity or Federa=
l Reserve judgment isn't=20

worth a picayune or this huge "charge out" for "depreciation" is a mere cam=
ouflage or deception.=20

Take your choice. It's either damphoolishness or incompetency's height of d=
eception. And that's all=20

you can make it.  The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank spent originally i=
n "original=20

investment" for a building $520,785, spent $232,895 for "remodeling," spent=
 $448,776 for "new=20

building" operations, making a total cost to September 30, 1921, of $1,202,=
456 and then "charged=20

off" for "depreciation allowance" $530,795, so that after spending $681,671=
 on "remodeling" and=20

new buildings on an original purchase of $520,785, it emerges with a value =
of but $671,661! Or in=20

other words, after spending $681,671 on a $520,785 purchase it claims the g=
ross value to be but=20

$671,661, or but $150,876 more than the original purchase! Or in other word=
s, it got but $150,876=20

of value for an expenditure of $681,671! Does San Francisco real estate dep=
reciate as fast as=20

that, or are Federal Reserve business oligarchs futile wastrels, or is this=
 method of accountancy=20

just a camouflage? Figure it out for yourself.  The St. Louis Federal Reser=
ve Bank made an=20

"original investment" in building of $1,311,197, spent $560 on "remodeling"=
 and "charged off"=20

$685,000 for "depreciation allowance," emerging with a value of $626,575 fo=
r an expenditure of=20

$1,311,757! Another case of swift shrinkage in value or wastrelcy in expend=
iture or camouflage in=20

accountancy. Figure it to suit yourself.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank=
 paid $4,797,882 for=20

its site, spent up to September 30, 1921, $758,072 on building operations, =
making a total=20

expenditure of $5,555,954 and immediately charged off to "depreciation" the=
 enormous sum of=20

$1,841,618! Did it pay too much for its site or does real estate in the hea=
rt of the greatest city on=20

earth depreciate almost 40 per cent almost immediately after purchase? Figu=
re it for yourself.=20

Later on reference will be made to this New York oligarchical palace of spl=
endor.  Up to=20

September 30, 1921, Federal Reserve satrapists had spent $36,158,056 on its=
 twelve building=20

operations and had "charged off" as "depreciation allowance" the gigantic s=
um of $6,684,213! In=20

other words, in a very few years, and in most cases practically at once, it=
 depreciated its own=20

building accounts by about eighteen per cent!  Incidentally up to the same =
date it had spent=20

$3,212,349 on its Branch Bank buildings and had depreciated them by $346,36=
9. In its Helena=20

Branch it made an "original investment" of $15,000, blew in $161,438 on the=
 purchase and then=20

"charged off" for "depreciation allowance" $77,738 when it got through, or =
about 45 per cent on the=20

whole transaction.  Up to September 30, 1921, Federal Reservists, including=
 branch banks, had=20

"reserved" $39,370,405 of your money in building operations and had them "d=
epreciated" by the=20

enormous sum of $7,030,582, or about 18 per cent, almost immediately. You a=
re entitled to draw=20

your own conclusions as to the necessity for these palaces, for the splendo=
r of their equipment=20

and for the real motive of so speedily "charging off" such enormous sums fo=
r "depreciation=20

allowance." You are entitled to draw your own conclusions as to the wisdom =
of allowing a coterie=20

of bureaucrats to spend such huge sums for their personal comfort or conven=
ience or splendor=20

unsupervised and unhindered. You are entitled to ponder on the proposition =
that these huge=20

expenditures aren't obtained by legislation from Congress, but are made to =
suit the whim or=20

ambition or convenience or extravagant ideas of an appointive body.  The Ne=
w York Federal=20

Reserve Bank in cost, in expenditure, in equipment, in splendors purely for=
 the convenience of its=20

occupants is intended to surpass any like building on earth. Its cost has b=
een estimated at from=20



$17,000,000 to $20,000,000. Its corner stone--amid speeches and plutocratic=
 glorifications--was=20

laid on May 31, 1922. The fees of architects and engineers alone amounted t=
o the stupendous=20

sum of $1,106,000. It is intended to house 5,000 employees--about 2,500 mor=
e than it now has.=20

Make right here some comparisons.  In the first week of May, 1922, the loan=
s and discounts of the=20

New York Federal Reserve Bank amounted to $89,956,248, and it must have a $=
17,000,000=20

building and equipment to handle its activities. On the same date the loans=
 and discounts of the=20

National City Bank of New York amounted to $506,840,494, and its bank build=
ings to but=20

$6,060,000. On the same date the loans and discounts of the National Bank o=
f Commerce of New=20

York amounted to $259,165,930, and its bank building to but $4,000,000. Fig=
ure it for yourself. It=20

makes some difference whose money is being spent, doesn't it? Private busin=
ess is one thing, and=20

public business is another thing, when it comes to housing it, isn't it? Co=
mpare the volume of the=20

loans of these banks, compare their building costs and draw your own conclu=
sions.  In addition to=20

veined marble and polished brass and in addition to a mass of luxurious equ=
ipment the New York=20

Federal Reserve Bank has, or will have on completion, a beautiful auditoriu=
m, a gymnasium, a=20

club room for men, a club room for women, and a restaurant.  It will doubtl=
ess gratify farmers on=20

the prairies, workmen all over the land, merchants, and manufacturers and p=
rofessional men to=20

know that their toil, their efforts and their earnings are in effect being =
levied upon to provide this=20

modern palace equipped with an auditorium, a gymnasium, two clubs and a res=
taurant.  It will=20

doubtless gratify the stockholders in National Banks, whose money is comman=
deered to capitalize=20

this leviathan, to know that their money, or its proceeds, or its earnings,=
 is being used to erect and=20

equip a veritable Temple of Mammon with all these attendant luxuries--which=
 they themselves=20

cannot afford in their places of business!  If you, who read these lines, c=
ould commandeer over a=20

hundred millions of dollars for capital at 6 per cent and could conscript o=
ver $1,800,000,000 of=20

deposits at no per cent you could transact your business in a palace in the=
 heart of New York with=20

an auditorium and club rooms and a gymnasium and a restaurant, couldn't you=
? But as you can't=20

commandeer your neighbor's capital nor conscript for nothing the deposits o=
f the public, you find=20

yourselves compelled to work and to provide the wherewithal for those who c=
an!  You can=20

measure these lavish expenditures for buildings and equipments and luxuries=
 by any known=20

measure, by volume of business, or by like buildings for like purposes and =
it is as clear as day that=20

these Federal Reserve Palaces are a monument of needless extravagance and o=
f wanton=20

wastage--pulled off by the ukase of enthroned bureaucracy spending "other p=
eople's money!"=20

That's all you can make of the Monster's Palaces.     CHAPTER XI  THE MONST=
ER'S=20

EXPENSES   YOU are going now to look over--and not overlook--the most stupe=
ndous, wasteful=20

and exorbitant bank expense account ever entered on bank ledgers on this ea=
rth. You are going to=20

look at the details of an expense account where the items run by millions, =
where expenses have=20

no legal limit and where they are incurred, paid and audited without any su=
pervisory authority. You=20

are going to gaze at an expense account where the "sky is the limit."  Take=
 first a look at the New=20

York Federal Reserve Bank's expense account. That one is the most arrogant,=
 wasteful and=20

prodigal of all the twelve regional satrapies.  In 1917 the entire salary a=
nd wages account of the=20

New York Federal Reserve Bank was $970,580 and their total loans and discou=
nts were=20

$399,078,000. Mark that down--salaries and wages of $970,580 and loans and =
discounts (which=20

really measure the business of a bank) of $399,078,000, or $1 of expense to=
 every $413 of loans=20



and discounts.  On January 25, 1922, the salary and wages account of the Ne=
w York Federal=20

Reserve Bank was $4,988,703, with loans and discounts of $146,526,938, or $=
1 of expense to=20

every $29 of loans and discounts!  Ask any practical banker, any administra=
tive business man, any=20

expert accountant or any efficient expert if it is possible to justify any =
such expense ratio. One to=20

four hundred and thirteen in 1917 and one to twenty-nine in 1921--fourteen =
to one raise!  In 1917=20

there were 12 officers of that bank to administer loans of $399,078,000. In=
 1921 there were 40=20

officers of that bank to administer loans of $146,526,938. In other words, =
you get 28 more officers=20

to administer a business shrunken down over sixty per cent! In other words,=
 you get over a two=20

hundred per cent increase in officers to administer a sixty per cent busine=
ss shrinkage!  And now=20

incidentally the pay of those 40 officers--administering a sixty per cent s=
hrunken business--

amounted to more money than the salaries of the President of the United Sta=
tes, the Vice=20

President of the United States, half the United States Senate and the Gover=
nors of twelve=20

American States besides! If that isn't bottomless bureaucratic greed expres=
sed mathematically,=20

you express it yourself!  Look further into the depths of this golden pool =
of New York Federal=20

Reserve expense plunderbund. You are helping pay it and you are entitled to=
 scrutinize the salary=20

items. Take 'em as they come.  J. Crane entered the bank at a yearly salary=

salary of $2,250 and now receives a yearly salary of $7,200, or an increase=
 of 220 per cent.=20

and now receives a yearly salary of $5,500, or an increase of 205 per cent.=
  L.H. Hendricks=20

entered the bank on a yearly salary of $6,000 and now receives a yearly sal=
ary of $18,000, or an=20

increase of 200 per cent.  Incidentally Benjamin Strong, the governor of th=
e New York Federal=20

Reserve Bank, has had his salary increased from $30,000 per year to $50,000=
 per year--more=20

than six times the pay of a United States Senator!  Ask any corporate manag=
er, any practical=20

banker, or any efficiency expert if they permit, or if they know of any suc=
h stupendous salary=20



increases--increased and maintained in a time of general disaster and enfor=
ced economies. If this=20

isn't strutting bureaucracy running amuck with public money, what is it?  T=
ake now a look at the=20

total expense account--which you are helping to pay--of the Federal Reserve=
 System for the year=20

1921. It amounted to the stupendous sum of $36,066,065, or an average of $3=
,005,500 for each=20

one of the twelve regional satrapies! You can't measure it--because there i=
s nowhere on earth any=20

other banking expense account by which to measure it! Like an Andean peak i=
t towers aloft in=20

solitary splendor. But you can look at some of the items. Here they are. Th=
e New York Federal=20

Reserve Bank heads the list of extravagance with an expense account of $8,1=
67,780, and the=20

Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank was the most modest--and not any too modes=
t at that--with an=20

expense account of $1,325,867. It cost you for bank officers' salaries $2,3=
83,994, for clerk hire=20

$15,201,393, for special officers and watchmen $789,879 and for "all other"=
 $1,102,984. What that=20

"all other" item of $1,102,984 really is, is deep buried in Federal Reserve=
 archives. When you get=20

through with bank officers, bank clerks, special officers and watchmen, you=
 would think that=20

included about all possible bank employees, but Federal Reserve ingenuity s=
lips over $1,102,984=20

under the cloak of "all other!"  It cost you $7,750 for Federal Reserve Gov=
ernors to "confer,"=20

$4,443 for Federal Reserve Agents to "confer" and $10,522 for the Federal A=
dvisory Council--

whatever that is--to "confer." "Conferences"--in bureaucracy--come high, do=
n't they? And it cost=20

you $168,556 to hold directors' meetings with 173 out of 254 of them living=
 in the same town=20

where the bank or its branch is located. Traveling expenses cost you $357,9=
62--some travelers=20

these Federal Reserve tourists are!  These bureaucratic "expenses" of a par=
asitical system=20

hooked on to your banking system are stupendous, titanic, gigantic! They ar=
e indefensible--and=20

undefended too--from any possible standpoint of efficiency, economy or nece=
ssity. Look them over=20

in cold blood. Look over the stupendous salary raises--both in amounts and =
in percentages--in the=20

New York Federal Reserve satrapy and compare them with any private business=
 on earth. Private=20

stockholders--not commandeered by law and not chained by act of Congress--w=
ould drive out any=20

such maladministration of extravagance. You know it.  Who is responsible--d=
irectly, morally and=20

legally responsible--for this orgy of Federal Reserve extravagance absolute=
ly unequaled in the=20

history of the world or in the history of banking? Why, the Federal Reserve=
 Board at Washington is=20

responsible. What makes them responsible? Here is the exact language. Read =
it. "Any=20

compensation that may be provided by Boards of Directors of Federal Reserve=
 Banks for=20

directors, officers or employees shall be subject to the approval of the Fe=
deral Reserve Board."=20

That's plain, isn't it? If the Federal Reserve Board at Washington doesn't =
"approve" these huge=20

compensations, they can not be paid. It is the Federal Reserve Board at Was=
hington--and no=20

other authority on earth--which is responsible for the greatest orgy of exp=
ense ever strapped on=20

the backs of staggering business. It's their ukase, it's their decree, it's=
 their order which registers=20

these titanic expenses--every penny of which is wrung from American produce=
rs of wealth! And=20

they are political appointees--not elected, but appointed. The Federal Rese=
rve Board at=20

Washington really wields a power greater than any sceptered monarch ever sw=
ayed. At their nod=20

or at their beck every Federal Reserve employee holds his job, for if they =
don't "approve" his=20

"compensation" he can't attach his lips to the public teat with its golden =
flow of "compensation!" It's=20

the Federal Reserve Board at Washington--unsupervised and with legally limi=
tless power--which is=20

responsible for this Federal Reserve expense orgy.     CHAPTER XII  WHAT TH=
E MONSTER=20



DOES WITH ITS LOOT   THIS chapter is going to be like a tack--short but poi=
nted. Federal=20

Reserve apologists--on and off the floor of Congress--when driven into thei=
r last retreat always=20

take their final stand and make their last play in the "franchise tax" stro=
nghold. Their assertion is in=20

effect that no the conduct of the king had the sole purpose of overcoming r=
esistance to established=20

government. Most of these coercive acts, though no part of the original pol=
icy, were perfectly=20

constitutional even in times of peace. They must be considered in their his=
torical setting, however,=20

just as President Lincoln=E2=80=99s extraordinary acts in a time of like na=
tional peril. Henceforth we are=20

dealing with the natural, though perhaps ill-judged, efforts of a governmen=
t to repress a rebellion.=20

After the riot which followed the seizure of the _Liberty_ (June, 1768), tw=
o regiments of British=20

soldiers were stationed in Boston. The very inadequacy of the force made it=
s relations with the=20

citizens strained, for they resented without fearing it. After enduring mon=
ths of jeering and=20

vilification, the soldiers at last (March 5, 1770) fired upon a threatening=
 mob, and four men were=20

killed. Much was made of the =E2=80=9Cmassacre,=E2=80=9D as it was called, =
because it symbolized for the people=20

the substitution of military for civil government. A Boston jury acquitted =
the soldiers, and, after a=20

town-meeting, the removal of the two regiments was secured.  A period of qu=
iet followed until the=20

assembly and the governor got into a debate over the theoretical rights of =
the colonists. To spread=20

the results of this debate, Samuel Adams devised the =E2=80=9Ccommittees of=
 correspondence,=E2=80=9D[69] which=20

kept the towns of Massachusetts informed of the controversy in Boston. This=
 furnished a model for=20

the colonial committees of correspondence, which became the most efficient =
means for=20

revolutionary organization. They created public opinion, set war itself in =
motion, and were the=20

embryos of new governments when the old were destroyed.  The first provinci=
al committee that=20

met with general response from the other colonies was appointed by Virginia=
, March 12, 1773, to=20

keep its assembly informed of the =E2=80=9C_Gaspee_ Commission.=E2=80=9D[70=
] The _Gaspee_ was a sort of=20

revenue-cutter which, while too zealously enforcing the Navigation Acts, ra=
n aground (June 9,=20

1772) in Narragansett Bay. Some Providence men seized and burned the vessel=
, and the British=20

government appointed a commission to inquire into the affair.[71] The commi=
ssion met with=20

universal opposition and had to report failure.  From this time on the chai=
n of events that led to=20

open rebellion consists of a series of links so plainly joined and so well =
known that they need only=20

the barest mention in this brief introduction to the actual war. The Britis=
h government tried to give=20

temporary aid to the East India Company by permitting the heavy revenue on =
tea entering English=20

ports, through which it must pass before being shipped to America, and by l=
icensing the company=20

itself to sell tea in America.[72] To avoid yielding the principle for whic=
h they had been contending,=20

they retained at colonial ports the threepenny duty, which was all that rem=
ained of the Townshend=20

revenue scheme. Ships loaded with this cheap tea came into the several Amer=
ican ports and were=20

received with different marks of odium at different places. In Boston, afte=
r peaceful attempts to=20

prevent the landing proved of no avail, an impromptu band of Indians threw =
the tea overboard, so=20

that the next morning saw it lying like seaweed on Dorchester beach.  This =
outrage, as it was=20

viewed in England, caused a general demand for repressive measures, and the=
 five =E2=80=9Cintolerable=20

acts=E2=80=9D were passed and sent oversea to do the last irremediable misc=
hief.[73] Boston=E2=80=99s port was=20

closed until the town should pay for the tea. Massachusetts=E2=80=99 charte=
r was annulled, its town-

meetings irksomely restrained, and its government so changed that its execu=
tive officers would all=20

be under the king=E2=80=99s control. Two other acts provided for the care a=
nd judicial privileges of the=20



soldiers who soon came to enforce the acts. Finally, great offence was give=
n the Protestant=20

colonies by granting religious freedom to the Catholics of Quebec, and the =
bounds of that colony=20

were extended to the Ohio River,[74] thus arousing all the colonies claimin=
g Western lands.=20

Except in the case of Virginia, there was no real attack on their territori=
al integrity, but in the=20

excitement there seemed to be.  Some strong incentive for the colonies to a=
ct together had long=20

been the only thing needed to send the flame of rebellion along the whole s=
ea-coast. When the=20

British soldiers began the enforcement of the punishment meted to Boston, s=
ympathy and fear=20

furnished the common bond. After several proposals of an intercolonial cong=
ress, the step was=20

actually taken on a call from oppressed Massachusetts (June 17, 1774).[75] =
Delegates from every=20

colony except Georgia met in Philadelphia in September, 1774. Seven of the =
twelve delegations=20

were chosen not by the regular assemblies, but by revolutionary conventions=
 called by local=20

committees; while in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, three of=
 the remaining five=20

states, the assemblies that sent the delegates were wholly dominated by the=
 revolutionary=20

element. Local committees may therefore be said to have created the congres=
s, and they would=20

now stand ready to enforce its will.  The assembled congress adopted a decl=
aration of rights, but=20

their great work was the forming an American association to enforce a non-i=
mportation and non-

consumption agreement.[76] Local committees were to see that all who traded=
 with England or=20

refused to associate were held up as enemies of their country. The delegate=
s provided for a new=20

congress in the following May, and adjourned.  Meanwhile, General Gage and =
his =E2=80=9Cpretorian=20

guard=E2=80=9D in Boston were administering the government of Massachusetts=
 with noteworthy results. A=20

general court of the colony was summoned by Gage, who, repenting, tried to =
put it off; but it met,=20

formed a provincial congress, and, settling down at Cambridge, governed the=
 whole colony=20

outside of Boston. It held the new royal government to be illegal, ordered =
the taxes paid to its own=20

receiver instead of Gage=E2=80=99s, and organized a militia. Gage at last d=
etermined to disarm the=20

provincials. His raid to destroy the stores at Concord (April 19, 1775) res=
ulted in an ignominious=20

retreat and the loss of two hundred and seventy-three men, to say nothing o=
f bringing sixteen=20

thousand patriots swarming about Boston.   II  THE OUTBREAK OF WAR, 1775  T=
hough mainly=20

social and economic forces brought the revolution to the stage of open warf=
are, a Massachusetts=20

politician had so used these forces that both his friends and enemies thoug=
ht the blame or the=20

honor to be his. Samuel Adams began to desire independence as early as 1768=
. From that time it=20

was his unwearying effort to keep alive the opposition to the British minis=
try. For years he sought=20

to instil in the minds of rising youths the notion of independence. His adr=
oit mind, always awake=20

and tireless, toiled for but one end; and he was narrow-minded enough to be=
 a perfect politician.=20

Two opposing views could never occupy his mind at the same time. For sharp =
practices he had no=20

aversion, but he used them for public good, as he saw it, and not for priva=
te gain. He was a public=20

servant, great or small, from his earliest manhood--as inspector of chimney=
s, tax-collector, or=20

moderator of town-meetings. He was ever a failure in business; in politics,=
 shrewd and able. The=20

New England town-meeting was the theatre of his action;[77] he directed the=
 Boston meetings,=20

and the other towns followed. His tools were men. He was intimate with all =
classes, from the ship-

yard roustabouts to the ministers of the gospel. In the canvass and caucus =
he was supreme.=20

Others were always in the foreground, thinking that theirs was the glory. A=
n enemy said that he=20

had an unrivalled =E2=80=9Ctalent for artfully and fallaciously insinuating=
=E2=80=9D malice into the public mind. A=20



friend dubbed him the =E2=80=9CColossus of debate.=E2=80=9D He was ready in=
 tact and cool in moments of=20

excitement; his reasoning and eloquence had a nervous simplicity, though th=
ere was little of fire,=20

and he was sincere rather than rhetorical.  Adams was of medium stature, bu=
t in his most intense=20

moments he attained to a dignity of figure and gesture. His views were clea=
r and his good sense=20

abundant, so that he always received profound attention. Prematurely gray, =
palsied in hand, and=20

trembling in voice, yet he had a mental audacity unparalleled. He was daunt=
less himself, and thus=20

roused and fortified the people. Nor were his efforts confined to the town-=
meeting, for he was also=20

a voluminous newspaper writer. He showed no tolerance for an opponent, and =
his attacks were=20

keenly felt. =E2=80=9CDamn that Adams. Every dip of his pen stings like a h=
orned snake,=E2=80=9D cried an enemy.=20

Thus he went on canvassing, caucusing, haranguing, and writing until the ma=
ddened Gage=20

attempted to seize him and the munitions of war which he and his fellow-pol=
iticians had induced=20

the colony to collect. Concord and Lexington and the pursuit into Boston we=
re the results.  At the=20

close of that long day of fighting (April 19, 1775) it was plain that war h=
ad begun, and the=20

Massachusetts politicians who had pushed matters to that stage may well hav=
e had misgivings. A=20

single colony could have no hope of success, and there was little in the pa=
st to make one believe=20

that the thirteen colonies would unite even to defend their political liber=
ties. Franklin gave a vivid=20

picture of their different forms of government, different laws, different i=
nterests, and, in some=20

instances, different religious persuasions and different manners.[78] Their=
 jealousy of one another=20

was, he declared, =E2=80=9Cso great that, however necessary a union of the =
colonies has long been for=20

their common defence, ... yet they have never been able to effect such a un=
ion among=20

themselves.=E2=80=9D They were more jealous of each other than of England, =
and though plans for union=20

had been proposed by their ablest statesmen, they had refused to consider t=
hem.[79] There were=20

long-standing disputes between neighboring colonies over boundaries, over r=
elations with the=20

Indians, and over matters of trade.  The greatest danger, however, that con=
fronted the American=20

cause was political division on the subject of the relations with England. =
As the quarrel with the=20

mother-country grew more bitter, it was seen that the British government ha=
d many friends in=20

America who, if they did not defend the action of the ministry, at least fr=
owned upon the violent=20

opposition to it. They believed that America=E2=80=99s best interests lay i=
n the union with Great Britain. The=20

aristocracy of culture, of dignified professions and callings, of official =
rank and hereditary wealth=20

tended to side with the central government.[80] The more prosperous and con=
tented men had no=20

grievances, and conservatism was the character one would expect in them. Th=
ey denounced the=20

agitators as demagogues and their followers as =E2=80=9Cthe mob.=E2=80=9D  =
Through the long ten years of unrest=20

preceding the Revolution, these Tories, as they were called, had suffered a=
t the hands of mobs,=20

and now, when Gage was powerless outside of Boston, an active persecution o=
f them began.[81]=20

Millers refused to grind their corn, labor would not serve them, and they c=
ould neither buy nor sell.=20

Men refused to worship in the same church with them. They were denounced as=
 =E2=80=9Cinfamous=20

betrayers of their country.=E2=80=9D Committees published their names, =E2=
=80=9Csending them down to posterity=20

with the infamy they deserve.=E2=80=9D After the siege of Boston had begun,=
 those who were even=20

suspected of Toryism, as their support of the king was called, were regarde=
d as enemies in the=20

camp. The Massachusetts committees compelled them to sign recantations or c=
onfined them in=20

jails for refusal. If they escaped they were pursued with hue and cry.  Som=
e fled to other colonies,=20

but found that, =E2=80=9Clike Cain, they had some discouraging mark upon th=
em.=E2=80=9D In exile they learned that=20



the patriot wrath visited their property: their private coaches were burned=
 or pulled in pieces. A rich=20

importer=E2=80=99s goods were destroyed or stolen, and his effigy was hung =
up in sight of his house during=20

the day and burned at night. Beautiful estates, where was =E2=80=9Cevery be=
auty of art or nature, every=20

elegance, which it cost years of care and toil in bringing to perfection,=
=E2=80=9D were laid waste. Looking=20

upon this work of ruin, a despairing loyalist cried that the Americans were=
 =E2=80=9Cas blind and mad as=20

Samson, bent upon pulling the edifice down upon their heads to perish in th=
e ruins.=E2=80=9D  The violence=20

of the patriots=E2=80=99 attack upon the loyalists seemed for a time to eli=
minate the latter from the struggle.=20

The friends of royal power in America expected too much, and while the king=
=E2=80=99s enemies were=20

organizing they waited for him to crush the rising rebellion. They looked o=
n with wonder as the=20

signal flew from one local committee to another over thirteen colonies, who=
 now needed only a=20

glowing fact like Lexington to fuse them into one defensive whole. The news=
 reached Putnam=E2=80=99s=20

Connecticut farm in a day; Arnold, at New Haven, had it the next day, and i=
n four days it had=20

reached New York.[82] Unknown messengers carried it through Philadelphia, p=
ast the=20

Chesapeake, on to Charleston, and within twenty days the news in many garbl=
ed forms was=20

evoking a common spirit of patriotism from Maine to Georgia. It was commonl=
y believed that=20

America must be saved from =E2=80=9Cabject slavery=E2=80=9D by the bands of=
 patriots encompassing Boston.  The=20

farmers and mechanics who had hurried from their work to drive the British =
from Concord into=20

Boston were not an army. They settled down in a great half-circle around th=
e port with a common=20

purpose of compelling Gage to take to his ships, but with no definite plan.=
 Confusion was=20

everywhere. Men were coming and going, and there were no regular enlistment=
s.[83] A few=20

natural leaders were doing wonders in holding them together.[84] Among them=
 the brave and=20

courteous Joseph Warren, the warm friend of Samuel Adams and zealous comrad=
e in the recent=20

work of agitation, was conquering insubordination by the manly modesty and =
gentleness of his=20

character. Others who were old campaigners of the French and Indian wars wo=
rked ceaselessly to=20

bring order out of chaos.  Yet not even the fanatic zeal of the siege could=
 banish provincial=20

jealousies. There were as many leaders as there were colonies represented. =
New Hampshire men=20

were led by John Stark, a hero of the French war; Connecticut men were unde=
r Israel Putnam,=20

more picturesque as a wolf-slayer than able as a leader. Nathanael Greene, =
the philosophic and=20

literary blacksmith, commanded the Rhode Island militia.[85] It was with di=
fficulty that =E2=80=9Cthe grand=20

American army,=E2=80=9D as the Massachusetts congress called it, finally in=
trusted the chief command to=20

General Artemas Ward, who, in turn, was controlled by the Massachusetts com=
mittee of safety.=20

Even with some organization and a leader there was little outward semblance=
 of an army. In the=20

irregular dress, brown and green hues were the rule. Uniforms like those of=
 the British regulars,=20

the hunting-shirt of the backwoodsman, and even the blankets of savages wer=
e seen side by side=20

in the ranks of the first patriot armies. There was little distinction betw=
een officer and private.[86]=20

Each company chose its own officers out of the ranks,[87] and the private c=
ould not understand=20

why he should salute his erstwhile friend and neighbor or ask his permissio=
n to go home. The=20

principle of social democracy was carried into military life to the great d=
etriment of the service.=20

Difference in rank was ignored by the officers themselves, who in some case=
s did menial work=20

about camp to curry favor with their men.  Fortunately, there was in this r=
aw militia a good leaven=20

of soldiers seasoned and trained in the war with France. These men led expe=
ditions to the islands=20

of Boston Harbor in the effort to get the stock before it should be seized =
by the British.[88]=20



Numerous slight engagements resulted, turning favorably, as a rule, for the=
 patriots, and the new=20

recruits gained courage with experience. Thus nearly two months passed away=
, and an elated=20

patriot wrote that =E2=80=9Cdanger and war are become pleasing, and injured=
 virtue is now aroused to=20

avenge herself.=E2=80=9D  The only way to drive Gage out of Boston was to s=
eize one of the commanding=20

hill-tops either in Dorchester or Charlestown, whence they might open a can=
nonade on the city.=20

Gage saw this danger, and with the arrival of reinforcements under Howe, Cl=
inton, and Burgoyne=20

a plan was made to get control of the dangerous hill-tops. With ten thousan=
d well-equipped=20

soldiers to pit against an ill-trained and poorly commanded multitude of fa=
rmers the task seemed=20

easy. After trying to terrify the rebels by threatening with the gallows al=
l who should be taken with=20

arms, and offering to pardon those who would lay them down, Gage prepared t=
o execute this plan.=20

The patriots forestalled him by sending twelve hundred men under the vetera=
n Colonel Prescott to=20

seize Bunker Hill, in Charlestown.     VII  THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL, 1775=
.   In May, 1775,=20

the British force in Boston had increased by fresh arrivals from England an=
d Ireland to ten=20

thousand men. The man-of-war _Cerberus_ arrived on the 25th with Generals H=
owe, Clinton, and=20

Burgoyne--three officers experienced in the military tactics of Europe, but=
 little prepared for service=20

here. They were surprised at the aspect of affairs, and Gage was reproached=
 for his apparent=20

supineness. However, unity of action was necessary, and the new-comers hear=
tily co-operated=20

with Gage in his plans, such as they were, for dispersing the rebel host th=
at hemmed him in. He=20

issued a proclamation on June 12 insulting in words and menacing in tone. I=
t declared martial law;=20

pronounced those in arms and their abettors =E2=80=9Crebels, parricides of =
the Constitution,=E2=80=9D and offered a=20

free pardon to all who would forthwith return to their allegiance, except J=
ohn Hancock and Samuel=20

Adams, who were outlawed, and for whose apprehension as traitors a reward w=
as offered. This=20

proclamation, so arrogant and insulting, served only to exasperate the peop=
le. In the mean while=20

several skirmishes had occurred between parties of the British regulars and=
 the provincials, upon=20

some of the cultivated islands that dot the harbor of Boston.  At this time=
 (May, 1775) but little=20

progress had been made by the Americans in erecting fortifications. Some br=
eastworks had been=20

thrown up at Cambridge, near the foot of Prospect Hill, and a small redoubt=
 had been formed at=20

Roxbury. The right wing of the besieging army, under General Thomas, was at=
 Roxbury,=20

consisting of four thousand Massachusetts troops, including four artillery =
companies, with field-

pieces and a few heavy cannon. The Rhode Island forces, under Greene, were =
at Jamaica Plains,=20

and near there was a greater part of General Spencer=E2=80=99s Connecticut =
regiment. General Ward=20

commanded the left wing at Cambridge, which consisted of fifteen Massachuse=
tts regiments, the=20

battalion of artillery under Gridley, and Putnam=E2=80=99s regiment, with o=
ther Connecticut troops. Most of=20

the Connecticut forces were at Inman=E2=80=99s farm. Paterson=E2=80=99s reg=
iment was at the breastwork on=20

Prospect Hill, and a large guard was stationed at Lechmere=E2=80=99s Point.=
 Three companies of Gerrish=E2=80=99s=20

regiment were at Chelsea; Stark=E2=80=99s regiment was at Medford, and Reid=
=E2=80=99s at Charlestown Neck, with=20

sentinels reaching to Penny Ferry and Bunker Hill.  It was made known to th=
e Committee of Safety=20

that General Gage had fixed upon the night of June 18 to take possession of=
 and fortify Bunker Hill=20

and Dorchester Heights. This brought matters to a crisis, and measures were=
 taken to perfect the=20

blockade of Boston. The Committee of Safety ordered Colonel Prescott, with =
a detachment of one=20

thousand men, including a company of artillery, with two field-pieces, to m=
arch at night and throw=20

up intrenchments upon Bunker Hill, an eminence just within the peninsula of=
 Charlestown, and=20



commanding the great northern road from Boston, as well as a considerable p=
ortion of the town.=20

Bunker Hill begins at the isthmus, and rises gradually for about three hund=
red yards, forming a=20

round, smooth hill, sloping on two sides toward the water, and connected by=
 a ridge of ground on=20

the south with the heights now known as Breed=E2=80=99s Hill. This was a we=
ll-known public place, the=20

name, =E2=80=9CBunker Hill,=E2=80=9D being found in the town records and in=
 deeds from an early period. Not so=20

with =E2=80=9CBreed=E2=80=99s Hill,=E2=80=9D for it was not named in any=20


_
and extravagances of this system the "big money" gets back to the Governmen=
t in the shape of=20

the mythical "franchise tax." Here is where you get the facts precisely as =
they are. What became=20

of the lootage of the Federal Reserve System for the year 1921 and what pro=
portion of it did your=20

Government get?  The gross takings of the Federal Reserve System--extracted=
 from American=20

production and industry--amounted to $122,864,605. That's what it euphoniou=
sly calls its=20

"earnings." First there came out the gigantic expense account, of which you=
 have already read, of=20

$36,066,065, leaving $86,798,540, which the monster calls its "current net =
earnings." There is=20

then added to this $360,856, which in previous years had been deducted 1775=
, and appears to=20

have been called after the owners of the pastures into which it was divided=
, rather than by the=20

common name of Breed=E2=80=99s Hill. Thus, Monument Square was called Russe=
ll=E2=80=99s Pasture; Breed=E2=80=99s=20

Pasture lay farther south, and Green=E2=80=99s Pasture was at the head of G=
reen Street. The easterly and=20

westerly sides of this height were steep. On the east, at its base, were br=
ick-kilns, clay-pits, and=20

much sloughy land. On the west side, at the base, was the most settled part=
 of the town. Moulton=E2=80=99s=20

Point, a name coeval with the settlement of the town, constituted the south=
eastern corner of the=20

peninsula. A part of this tract formed what is called Morton=E2=80=99s Hill=
. Bunker Hill was one hundred and=20

ten feet high, Breed=E2=80=99s Hill=20


_
finally "depreciate." There is also added $131,536 under an "all other" bla=
nket--much favored in=20

the Federal Reserve System vocabulary. You now have $87,290,932 "current ne=
t earnings." From=20

this are deducted $1,251,675 for "depreciation allowance on bank premises;"=
 $2,861,500 for=20

"reserve for possible losses" which probably won't occur; $400,000 "reserve=
 for self insurance"--

whatever that is; $49,295 "reserve for depreciation on U.S. Bonds"--which p=
robably won't=20

depreciate now that they have been sandbagged out of the hands of the origi=
nal purchasers;=20

$641,237 sandbagged out under the favorite "all other" Federal Reserve blan=
ket. Here are=20

$5,203,707 gone out in mere bookkeeping entries with the real money which t=
hese entries=20

represent still in Federal Reserve custody. This leaves $82,087,225. From t=
his is deducted a petty=20

$6,119,673 dividends paid on the capital commandeered. From this is deducte=
d $15,993,086 to be=20

added to the already swollen Federal Reserve Surplus Account. And there is =
left just $59,974,466=20

for the much touted franchise tax.  If you have followed these figures you =
have seen that in order=20

to get a petty "franchise tax" of $59,974,466 into the hands of your Govern=
ment, it cost you just=20

exactly $62,890,139 to collect it--the precise difference between the Feder=
al Reserve "earnings"=20

and the amount paid into the Government. Ask yourself, is a tax of $59,974,=
466, which costs=20

$62,896,139 to collect a "painless tax?" Is there any more painful tax levi=
ed on American industry?=20

That's what this ballyhooed "franchise tax" amounted to in 1921 and all it =
amounted to--a tax of=20

$59,974,466, which cost $62,890,139 to collect!     CHAPTER XIII  THE CAMOU=
FLAGE OF THE=20

MONSTER   DON'T check your brains at the portals of the Federal Reserve "Bu=
nking" System.=20

That is what its touters and ballyhooers want you to do. Federal Reserve bu=
reaucrats and its=20

beneficiaries and its hirelings and an artfully subsidized press have reall=
y put the "prop" in=20

propaganda.  They would have you believe--and literally hundreds of columns=
 of inspired writings=20

have been used to make you believe--that the Federal Reserve System is comp=
osed of twelve=20

independent Federal Reserve Banks, each one especially devoted to fostering=
 industry in its own=20

regional territory.  Such is not the fact. The fact is that the Federal Res=
erve System is in truth a=20

huge Central Bank, managed, manipulated, directed and operated from Washing=
ton by the=20

Federal Reserve Board. There sits the spider and there the web is woven--sp=
reading all over the=20

U.S.A.--in which are enmeshed the victims.  You can read--if you want to wa=
ste your time--oodles=20

of language about how the Boards of Directors of these twelve Federal Reser=
ve Banks are seated=20

in office and how part of them are elected by member banks and how part of =
them are appointed=20

by the Federal Reserve Board. You can--if you want to waste more of your ti=
me--absorb messes=20

of artfully worded verbiage about the duties of the Boards of Directors. Bu=
t it's all "gammon and=20

spinach," it's all artful camouflage. _The real government of the Federal R=
eserve Banking System=20

and of its twelve Federal Reserve Banks and branches is in the absolute dic=
tatorial control of the=20

Federal Reserve Board at Washington._ It is all contained in one little jok=
er of just thirty words.=20

Here it is. Read it. "_Any compensation that may be provided by Boards of D=
irectors of Federal=20

Reserve Banks for directors, officers or employees shall be subject to the =
approval of the Federal=20

Reserve Board._" In every one of the twelve Federal Banks every director, e=
very Governor, every=20

one of the Deputy Governors, Federal Reserve Agents, Cashiers, Assistant Ca=
shiers, Controllers,=20

Secretary, Counsel, Assistant Counsel, Clerks, Stenographers, Messengers an=
d Watchmen--in=20

short, the whole horde of Federal Reserve bureaucratic parasites--are subje=
ct to the approval of=20

the Federal Reserve Board at Washington because _their compensation is subj=
ect to the approval=20



of the Federal Reserve Board_. You know that the hands that hold the money =
rule the enterprise.=20

You know that approval or disapproval of compensation is in effect "hiring =
and firing." You know=20

that "approval of compensation" is simply a euphonious bit of language or s=
moke screen behind=20

which really sits an enthroned autocracy. No matter how many "conferences" =
are held between=20

Governors of Federal Reserve Banks, between Federal Reserve Agents and with=
 the Federal=20

Advisory Council--"conferences" which during 1921 cost you $22,716--the Fed=
eral Reserve Board=20

at Washington is the supreme and final dictator of the personnel and of the=
 pay of its 10,313=20

employees and of its 231 officers. The Federal Reserve Board as to the comp=
ensation of this=20

horde--and hence as to its personnel--is an absolute autocracy from whose o=
rder there is no=20

appeal! It draws its expense account from a practically bottomless treasury=
 without let, hindrance,=20

supervision or veto! Kaiserdom and Czardom in their palmiest days drew from=
 no such lake of=20

liquid gold as draws the Federal Reserve Board at Washington. Set that down=
 on your mental=20

tablets and proceed to the next camouflage station.  Here it is. Federal Re=
serve propaganda--with=20

a practical limitless expense account to further it--would have you believe=
 that its favored coterie of=20

231 officials are top notch bankers. Take a look at this as it really is. T=
he bankers whom you know=20

and with whom you do your business and to whom you entrust your money and f=
rom whom you=20

borrow your money have taken their own money and the money of their associa=
tes and=20

contributed the capital of their banks and put it at risk. They wager their=
 own money that they are=20

good bankers. They have initiative and confidence in their own ability and =
they prove that they=20

have by putting up their own money before they ask you to entrust yours to =
their keeping. The=20

officers of the Federal Reserve Banks don't put up a copper cent, a plugged=
 nickel, or a thin dime=20

of capital. The capital which they manipulate is commandeered by law for th=
eir use at a petty six=20

per cent rate. They may charge--and they have charged--as high as eighty-se=
ven per cent in one=20

of their Shylockeries, but six per cent is all that those who furnish the c=
apital can claim. In 1919 the=20

Federal Reserve System sandbagged out of other people's money a profit of 1=
10 per cent, in 1920=20

160 per cent and in 1921 79 per cent. In 1919 its stockholders received 104=
 per cent less than=20

their capital really earned, in 1920 154 per cent less than their capital r=
eally earned, and in 1921=20

73 per cent less than their capital really earned. For the three years of 1=
919, 1920 and 1921 the=20

average net profits of the Federal Reserve System were 116 per cent and the=
 real owners of the=20

capital were gypped legally--but none the less gypped--out of an average of=
 110 per cent for each=20

of those three years. Do you suppose that officers of any bank not legally =
so buttressed could "get=20

away" with any such proposition? You know they couldn't--and hold their job=
s. No body of=20

stockholders in the U.S.A., unless legally chained, would endure a profit o=
f 116 per cent and a=20

dividend of but 6 per cent! And no bank officers in the U.S.A., unless lega=
lly permitted, would=20

attempt to "put over" any such proposition. You know it. Peg that and proce=
ed to the next=20

proposition.  What is the absolute, final and unquestionable test of a good=
 banker, a real top=20

notcher in his business? It is the volume of deposits which he attracts. Th=
at is the ultimate test of=20

his ability and integrity--the confidence he inspires in his Hill thirty-fi=
ve feet. The principal street of=20

the peninsula was Main Street, which extended from the Neck to the ferry. A=
 road ran over Bunker=20

Hill, around Breed=E2=80=99s Hill, to Moulton=E2=80=99s Point. The westerly=
 portions of these eminences contained=20

fine orchards.  A portion of the regiments of Prescott, Frye, and Bridge, a=
nd a fatigue party of two=20

hundred Connecticut troops with intrenching tools, paraded in the Cambridge=
 camp at six o=E2=80=99clock=20



in the evening. They were furnished with packs and blankets, and ordered to=
 take provisions for=20

twenty-four hours. Samuel Gridley=E2=80=99s company of artillery joined the=
m, and the Connecticut troops=20

were placed under the command of Thomas Knowlton, a captain in Putnam=E2=80=
=99s regiment, who was=20

afterward killed in the battle on Harlem Heights. After an impressive praye=
r from the lips of=20

President Langdon, of Harvard College, Colonel Prescott and Richard Gridley=
, preceded by two=20

servants with dark lanterns, commenced their march, at the head of the troo=
ps, for Charlestown. It=20

was about nine o=E2=80=99clock at night, the sky clear and starry, and the =
weather very warm. Strict silence=20

was enjoined, and the object of the expedition was not known to the troops =
until they arrived at=20

Charlestown Neck, where they were joined by Major Brooks, of Bridge=E2=80=
=99s regiment, and General=20

Putnam. A guard of ten men was placed in Charlestown, and the main body mar=
ched over Bunker=20

Hill. A council was held, to select the best place for the proposed fortifi=
cation. The order was=20

explicit, to fortify Bunker Hill; but Breed=E2=80=99s Hill being nearer Bos=
ton, and appearing to be a more=20

eligible place, it was concluded to proceed to fortify it, and to throw up =
works, also, on Bunker Hill,=20

to cover a retreat, if necessary, across Charlestown Neck. Colonel Gridley =
marked out the lines of=20

the proposed fortifications, and, at about midnight, the men, having thrown=
 off their packs and=20

stacked their arms, began their perilous work--perilous, because British se=
ntinels and British=20

ships-of-war were almost within sound of their picks.  Officers and men lab=
ored together with all=20

their might, with pickaxes and spades, and were cheered on in their work by=
 the distant signals of=20

safety--=E2=80=9CAll=E2=80=99s well!=E2=80=9D--that came from the shipping =
and the sentinels at the foot of Copp=E2=80=99s Hill. It=20

proclaimed that they were still undiscovered; and at every cry of =E2=80=9C=
All=E2=80=99s well!=E2=80=9D they plied their tools=20

with increased vigor. When the day dawned, at about four o=E2=80=99clock, t=
hey had thrown up=20

intrenchments six feet high; and a strong redoubt, which was afterward the =
admiration of the=20

enemy, loomed up on the green height before the wondering eyes of the aston=
ished Britons like a=20

work of magic. The British officers could hardly be convinced that it was t=
he result of a few hours=E2=80=99=20

labor only, but deemed it the work of days. Gage saw at once how foolish he=
 had been in not=20

taking possession of this strong point, as advised, while it was in his pow=
er to do so.  The=20

fortification was first discovered at dawn, by the watchmen on board the Br=
itish man-of-war=20

_Lively_. Without waiting for orders, the captain put springs upon his cabl=
es, and opened a fire on=20

the American works. The noise of the cannon aroused the sleepers in Boston,=
 and when the sun=20

arose on that bright morning, every eminence and roof in the city swarmed w=
ith people,=20

astonished at the strange apparition upon Breed=E2=80=99s Hill. The shots f=
rom the _Lively_ did no harm,=20

and, defended by their intrenchments, the Americans plied their tools in st=
rengthening their works=20

within, until called to lay aside the pick and shovel for gun and knapsack.=
  [Illustration: PLAN OF=20

THE REDOUBT ON BREED=E2=80=99S HILL]  On June 17 Admiral Graves, the naval =
commander at=20

Boston, ordered the firing to cease; but it was soon renewed, not only by t=
he shipping, but from a=20

battery of six guns upon Copp=E2=80=99s Hill in the city. Gage summoned a c=
ouncil of war early in the=20

morning. As it was evident that the Americans were rapidly gaining strength=
, and that the safety of=20

the town was endangered, it was unanimously resolved to send out a force to=
 drive them from the=20

peninsula of Charlestown and destroy their works on the heights. It was dec=
ided, also, to make the=20

attack in front, and preparations were made accordingly. The drums beat to =
arms, and Boston was=20

soon in a tumult. Dragoons galloping, artillery trains rumbling, and the ma=
rching and=20

countermarching of the regulars and loyalists, together with the clangor of=
 the church bells, struck=20



dismay into many a heart before stout in the presence of British protectors=
. It is said that the=20

danger which surrounded the city converted many Tories into patriots; and t=
he selectmen, in the=20

midst of that fearful commotion, received large accessions to their list of=
 professed friends from the=20

ranks of the timid loyalists.  Toward noon between two and three thousand p=
icked men from the=20

British army, under the command of General Sir William Howe and General Pig=
ot, embarked in=20

twenty-eight barges, part from the Long Wharf and some from the North Batte=
ry, in Boston, and=20

landed at Morton=E2=80=99s, or Moulton=E2=80=99s Point, beyond the eastern =
foot of Breed=E2=80=99s Hill, covered by the=20

guns of the _Falcon_ and other vessels.  The Americans had worked faithfull=
y on their=20

intrenchments all the morning, and were greatly encouraged by the voice and=
 example of Prescott,=20

who exposed himself, without care, to the random shots of the battery on Co=
pp=E2=80=99s Hill. He=20

supposed, at first, that the enemy would not attack him, but, seeing the mo=
vements in the city, he=20

was convinced to the contrary, and comforted his toiling troops with assura=
nces of certain victory.=20

Confident of such a result himself, he would not at first send to General W=
ard for a reinforcement;=20

but between nine and ten o=E2=80=99clock, by advice of his officers, Major =
Brooks was dispatched to=20

headquarters for that purpose. General Putnam had urged Ward early in the m=
orning to send fresh=20

troops to relieve those on duty; but only a portion of Stark=E2=80=99s regi=
ment was allowed to go, as the=20

general apprehended that Cambridge would be the principal point of attack. =
Convinced otherwise,=20

by certain intelligence, the remainder of Stark=E2=80=99s regiment, and the=
 whole of Reed=E2=80=99s corps, on the=20

Neck, were ordered to reinforce Prescott. At twelve o=E2=80=99clock the men=
 in the redoubt ceased work,=20

sent off their intrenching tools, took some refreshments, hoisted the New E=
ngland flag, and=20

prepared to fight. The intrenching tools were sent to Bunker Hill, where, u=
nder the directions of=20

General Putnam, the men began to throw up a breastwork. Some of the more ti=
mid soldiers made=20

the removal of the tools a pretext for leaving the redoubt, and never retur=
ned.  It was between=20

twelve and one o=E2=80=99clock when the British troops, consisting of the f=
ifth, thirty-eighth, forty-third, and=20

fifty-second battalions of infantry, two companies of grenadiers, and two o=
f light infantry, landed,=20

their rich uniforms and arms flashing and glittering in the noonday sun, ma=
king an imposing and=20

formidable display. General Howe reconnoitred the American works, and, whil=
e waiting for=20

reinforcements, which he had solicited from Gage, allowed his troops to din=
e. When the=20

intelligence of the landing of the enemy reached Cambridge, two miles dista=
nt, there was great=20

excitement in the camp and throughout the town. The drums beat to arms, the=
 bells were rung,=20

and the people and military were speedily hurrying in every direction. Gene=
ral Ward used his own=20

regiment, and those of Paterson and Gardner and a part of Bridge=E2=80=99s,=
 for the defence of=20

Cambridge. The remainder of the Massachusetts troops were ordered to=20


_
by the volume of money entrusted to it! That volume of deposits must be obt=
ained, retained and=20

increased in the face of the hottest kind of hot competition. It is the abs=
olute ability and integrity=20

meter of a successful banker. There is no other. Are these strutting, preen=
ing, vociferating and=20

vociferous Federal Reserve bankers measured--or measurable--by that standar=
d? Do they battle=20

for their deposits and by those deposits and the volume of them win their s=
purs? They do not.=20

Their mass of deposits--the largest on earth--are dumped into their banks b=
y law, conscripted into=20

their coffers. They are not won in competition. Federal Reserve bankers don=
't prove their ability by=20

competition--they smugly admit it. At this writing over $1,800,000,000 of d=
eposits are in their=20

coffers, conscripted there as were soldiers in the World War by law!  And n=
ot only that, but that=20

vast mass of deposits--the hugest on earth--is handed to them free of inter=
est charge. All other=20

banks in large American cities not only compete with each other for the dep=
osits of country banks,=20

but pay interest on them at a minimum of 2 per cent per General Putnam cond=
ucted those of=20

Connecticut.  At about two o=E2=80=99clock the reinforcement for Howe arriv=
ed, and landed at the present=20

navy-yard. It consisted of the Forty-seventh battalion of infantry, a batta=
lion of marines, and some=20

grenadiers and light infantry. The whole force (about four thousand men) wa=
s commanded and=20

directed by the most skilful British officers then in Boston; and every man=
 preparing to attack the=20

undisciplined provincials was a drilled soldier, and quite perfect in the a=
rt of war. It was an hour of=20

the deepest anxiety among the patriots on Breed=E2=80=99s Hill. They had ob=
served the whole martial=20

display, from the time of the embarkation until the forming of the enemy=E2=
=80=99s line for battle. For the=20

Americans, as yet, very little succor had arrived. Hunger and thirst annoye=
d them, while the labors=20

of the night and morning weighed them down with excessive fatigue. Added to=
 this was the=20

dreadful suspicion that took possession of their minds, when only feeble re=
inforcements arrived,=20

that treachery had placed them there for the purpose of sacrifice. Yet they=
 could not doubt the=20

patriotism of their principal=20


_
Government. If a National Bank wants Government deposits it must put up the=
 unquestioned=20

security to get them and then must pay interest on them, but Federal Reserv=
e bankers do neither!=20

Not much competition for Federal Reserve bankers there, is there? Peg that =
proposition and look=20

at the next one.  Here it is. The loans of a bank are the life of a bank. F=
rom the interest upon them=20

comes practically the sole earnings of a bank and upon their repayment depe=
nds the solvency of a=20

bank. The credit department of a bank is its solar plexus. Loans must be su=
ccessfully made to=20

men engaged in every variety of industry, some secured, some unsecured and =
in amounts varying=20

from a few hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In May,=
 1922, the loans and=20

discounts of the National City Bank of New York amounted to $506,840,494--l=
arger by over=20
