"What's that?" cried Mr. Pierce.  "Brake's busted!" shouted Mr. Blender. "N=

horses with a crack like that of a rifle.  "Go on!" he yelled. "Go on! Run!=

CHAPTER XVII  THIRSTY ON THE DESERT   "Hold fast, everybody!" called out Ta=

swear by their friends, their fathers or mothers, their wives or children. =
They want to show how=20

they despise God's law.  A great many men think there is nothing in swearin=

God sees something wrong in it, and He says He will not hold men guiltless,=
 even though society=20
