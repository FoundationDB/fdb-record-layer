I've been reading up about hunting big game," went on Jack, and art found w=

en he must step into the balances and be weighed, he would have laughed at =
the thought. But the vital hour had come.  The weighing was soon over. The =
verdict was announced, and the sentence carried out. "In that night was Bel=
shazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain, _
regret to inform you that the fire last night has damaged the boiler in suc=
h a way that it is=20

impossible to get up steam. I have just made an investigation, and the boil=
er will have to have=20

extensive repairs. It will take some time to make them, and, I regret to sa=
y it, but I will have to=20

close the school until after the holidays----"  "Hurray!" yelled Nat.  The =
doctor looked shocked.=20

Then he smiled.  "Such feeling is perhaps natural," he said, "and I would r=
esent it, only I know that=20

Nat Anderson is a good pupil, who loves his school, as, I hope, you all do.=
 But we cannot hold=20

sessions in cold rooms. Now I suggest that you all retire to the general as=
sembly room. There is a=20

large fireplace there, and I will have the janitor build a blaze in it. You=
 can at least have a warm=20

breakfast, and discuss future plans."  There was a buzz of excitement at on=
ce, and the lads made=20

a rush for the assembly room. There, a little later, somewhat warmed by a b=
ig log fire, they ate=20

breakfast. The fire of the night previous, it was learned, had been caused =
by spontaneous=20

combustion among some oiled rags, and the damage was only in the boiler-roo=
m. There had been=20

no need for the fire department from the village, and though Sam had summon=
ed it, the order had=20

been countermanded before the apparatus started, so there was no damage by =
water to the=20

school. Some smoke-begrimed walls were the only evidence in the upper stori=
es of the fire.=20

"Well," remarked Nat Anderson, as Jack and several of his chums gathered ar=
ound in a warm=20

corner, "no more school for a couple of months, anyhow. Solidified snowball=
s! but I wonder what=20

we'll do all that time?"  "Go home and rest up," suggested Bony Balmore as =
he cracked a couple=20

of finger knuckles just to keep in practice.  "Rest! Why, we just had one d=
uring the summer=20

vacation, Bony," remarked Fred Kaler.  "Oh, I can use more," said Bony. "Wh=
at are you going to=20

do, Jack?"  "I'm going hunting and camping," announced Jack quietly.  "Hunt=
ing?" questioned Nat.=20

"Camping?" cried Sam Chalmers.  "Sure," went on Jack. "I've been thinking o=
f it for some time, but=20

labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord=
 thy God: in it thou shalt=20

not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor t=
hy maidservant, nor thy=20

cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord=
 made heaven and earth, the=20

sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lor=
d blessed the Sabbath=20

day and hallowed it.  V. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days ma=
y be long upon the land=20

which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  VI. Thou shalt not kill.  VII. Thou sh=
alt not commit adultery.=20

VIII. Thou shalt not steal.  IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against =
thy neighbour.  X. Thou=20

shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's=
 wife, nor his=20

manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing tha=
t is thy neighbour's.=20

Weighed in the Balances  In the fifth chapter of Daniel we read the history=
 of King Belshazzar.=20

One chapter tells us all we know about him. One short sight of his career i=
s all we have. He bursts=20

in upon the scene and then disappears.  THE EASTERN FEAST.  We are told tha=
t he made a=20

great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before them. In thos=
e days a feast would=20

sometimes last for six months in Eastern countries. How long this feast had=
 been going on we are=20

not told, but in the midst of it, he "commanded to bring the golden and sil=
ver vessels which his=20

father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; t=
hat the king, and his=20

princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. Then they brou=
ght the golden vessels=20

that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusale=
m; and the king, and=20

his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine,=
 and praised the gods=20

of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone."  While t=
his impious act was being=20



committed, "in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote =
over against the=20

candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's=20


_
didn't see any opportunity of doing it. I'm going camping and hunting after=
 big game out West, and=20

I wish some of you fellows would go along."  "We haven't any guns--that is,=
 such as would do for=20

big game," objected Nat.  "We can get 'em," declared Jack. "I was thinking =
we fellows who went=20

camping before might organize a sort of gun club and take a trip. Now that =
the school is to close, it=20

will give us just the chance we want."  "A gun club," mused Nat. "Say, but =
that's a fine idea!=20

Petrified pedestrians! but we'll call it Jack Ranger's Gun Club! That will =
be a dandy name."  "You'll=20

do nothing of the sort," said Jack quickly. "It won't be my gun club any mo=
re than it will be yours or=20

Bony's or Sam's."  "But you're organizing it."  "That doesn't make any diff=
erence. Every fellow will=20

pay his own way. We'll just call it a gun club."  But, in spite of Jack's o=
bjection, when the=20

organization was perfected a little later, every one thought of it as Jack =
Ranger's club, the part of=20

the hand that wrote." We are not told at what hour of the day or the night =
it happened. Perhaps it=20

was midnight. Perhaps nearly all the guests were more or less under the inf=
luence of drink; but=20

they were not so drunk but that they suddenly became sober as they saw some=
thing that was=20

supernatural--a handwriting on the wall, right over the golden candlestick.=
  Every face turned=20

deathly pale. "The king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts trouble=
d him, so that the=20

joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another." =
In haste he sent for his=20

wisest men to come and read that handwriting on the wall. They came in one =
after another, and=20

tried to make it out; but they could not interpret it. The king promised th=
at whoever could read it=20

should be made the third ruler in the kingdom; that he should have gifts, a=
nd that a gold chain=20

should be put round his neck. But the wise men tried in vain. The king was =
greatly troubled.  At=20

last, in=20


_
they didn't say so.  "Where could we go hunting?" asked Nat. "There's no bi=
g game around here."=20

"I guess you're right," admitted Jack, "but I know where there is some, and=
 I'm going."  "Where?"=20

"Out in the Shoshone Mountains, in the 'bad lands' district of Wyoming. The=
re's the finest hunting=20

in the United States."  "Hurrah for the gun club!" cried Nat. "I'm going, t=
oo."  "Well, don't leave me=20

behind," pleaded Sam. "I guess you can count me in." told the monarch, if h=
e would only send for=20

one who used to interpret the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, he could read the w=
riting and tell him=20

the interpretation thereof. So Daniel was sent for. He was very familiar wi=
th it. He knew his=20

Father's handwriting.  "This is the writing that was written, _Mene, Mene, =
Tekel, Upharsin_. This is=20

the interpretation of the thing: _Mene_--God hath numbered thy kingdom and =
finished it. _Tekel_--

Thou art weighed in=20
