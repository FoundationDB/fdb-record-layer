 England was exile to her now.  Just at this moment M. Martin-Roget in his =
restless wanderings once more passed by.  "M. Martin-Roget!" all?"  "The up=
shot of it," answered the seaman, "was that I've never touched a drop o' st=

England--his heart smote him for all the wrong he had done to his only chil=

the gentle and patient wife who lay at rest in the churchyard of Kernogan, =
for he feared that with=20

his that was so partikler--but, I say, Archie, them buffalo runners has got=

showin' us their heels, I fear."  "Never fear," returned the boy, rising in=
 his stirrups and shading his=20

eyes to look ahead.  "They do seem to be leavin' us a bit, but you see by t=

exposure--the discomfort of the long sea-journey in this rough trading ship=
 had somewhat damped=20

M. de Kernogan's pride and obstinacy: his loyalty to the cause of his King =
had paled before the=20

demands of a father's duty toward his helpless daughter.   II  It was close=
 on six o'clock and the=20

night, after the turbulent and capricious alternations of rain and sunshine=
, promised to be=20

beautifully clear, though very cold. The pale crescent of the moon had just=
 emerged from behind=20

the thick veil of cloud and mist which still hung threateningly upon the ho=
rizon: a fitful sheen of=20

silver danced upon the waves.  M. le duc stood beside his daughter. He had =
inquired after her=20

health and well-being and received her monosyllabic reply with an impatient=
 sigh. M. Martin-Roget=20

was pacing up and down the deck with restless and vigorous strides: he had =
just gone by and=20

made a loud and cheery comment on the weather and the beauty of the night. =
 Could Yvonne=20

Dewhurst have seen her father's face now, or had she cared to study it, she=
 would have perceived=20

that he was gazing out to sea in the direction to which the schooner was he=
ading with an intent=20

look of puzzlement, and that there was a deep furrow between his brows. Hal=
f an hour went by=20

and he still stood safe to catch them up.  They're doin' good work, as the =
carcasses we've passed=20

and the rattle o' shots clearly show.  But get on wi' your story, Jenkins."=
  "Well, it ain't much of a=20

story, lad.  What Morel had to say was that he'd arranged wi' an agent o' L=
ord Selkirk to come out=20

to this country; an' he was goin' out wi' a lot o' his relations, an' was b=
eatin' up for a few good=20

hands, an' he liked the look o' me, an' would I agree to go wi' him?  "Well=
, as you may believe, this=20

was a poser, an' I said I'd think over it, an' let him know next day.  You =
see, I didn't want to seem=20

to jump at it too eager-like, though I liked the notion, an' I had neither =
wife, nor sweetheart, nor=20

father or mother, to think about, for I'm a orphing, you see, like yourself=
, Archie--only a somewhat=20

bigger one.  "Well, when we'd finished all the coffee, an' all the buns, an=

began to advise me not to ha' nothin' more to do wi' grog-shops.  I couldn'=

he said--no, nor the quarter--but he made such a impression on me that I wa=

convinced.  To say truth, I was so choke-full o' coffee an' buns, an' etcet=
erers, that I don't believe I=20

could ha' swallowed another drop o' liquor.  "`Where are ye goin' now?' say=
s he, when we'd done.=20

"`Back to my ship,' says I.  "`Come an' ha' tea to-morrow wi' me an'=20


_
suddenly a curious exclamation escaped his lips: he stooped and seized his =
daughter by the wrist.=20

"Yvonne!" he said excitedly, "tell me! am I dreaming, or am I crazed?"  "Wh=
at is it?" she asked=20

coldly.  "Out there! Look! Just tell me what you see?"  He have another tal=
k about Rupert's Land.'=20

"`I will,' says I.  "`Six o'clock, sharp,' says he.  "`Sharp's the word,' s=
ays I.  "An', sure enough, I=20

went to his house sharp to time next day, an' there I found him an' his sis=
ter.  She was as pretty a=20

craft as I=20


_
that she dragged herself to her feet and looked out to sea in the direction=
 to which he was=20

pointing.  "Tell me what you see," he reiterated with ever-growing exciteme=
nt, and she felt that the=20

hand which held her wrist trembled violently.  "The light from a lighthouse=
, I think," she said.  "And=20

besides that?"  "Another light--a much smaller one--considerably higher up.=
 It must be eyes on, wi'=20

a modest look an' long fair ringlets--just borderin' on nineteen or thereaw=
ay--but you know her,=20

Archie, so I needn't say no more."  "What! is that the same woman that's ke=
eping house for him=20

now in Red River?"  "Woman!" repeated the sailor, vehemently; "she's not a =
woman--she's a angel=20

is Elise Morel.  Don't speak disrespectful of her, lad."  "I won't," return=
ed Archie=20
