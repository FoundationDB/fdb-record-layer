 1868 Barye was=20

made Member of the Institute, although two years earlier he had been humili=
ated by having his=20

application refused. And from America, in addition to numerous proofs of th=
e esteem in which he=20

was held there by private amateurs, he received through Mr. Walters in 1875=
 an order to supply=20

the Corcoran Gallery at Washington with an example of every bronze he had m=
ade. This last=20

tribute moved him to tears, and he replied, "Ah! Monsieur Walters, my own c=
ountry has never=20

done anything like that for me!" These certainly were far from being trivia=
l satisfactions, and Barye=20

had also reaped a harvest of even subtler joys. One likes to think of him a=

[Illustration: From the collection of the late Cyrus J. Lawrence, Esq.  A L=
IONESS  _From a bronze=20

by Barye_]  In what does the extraordinary quality of this work consist? Th=
e question is not difficult=20

to answer, since, like most of the truly great artists, Barye had clear-cut=
 characteristics among=20

which may be found those that separate him from and raise him above his con=
temporaries.=20

Scientific grasp of detail and artistic generalization are to be found in a=
ll his work where an animal=20

is the subject, and this combination is in itself a mark of greatness. If w=
e should examine the=20

exceptionally fine collection of Barye bronzes belonging to the late Mr. Cy=
rus J. Lawrence, and=20

consisting of more than a hundred beautiful examples, or the fine group in =
