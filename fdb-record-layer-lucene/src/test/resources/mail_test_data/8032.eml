dracaena marginata injunctions to treat the Indians humanely, to provide for their conversion and instruction by pacific means, and on no account to employ force save for self-defence.  Las Casas  But--the word of warning cannot be too strongly sounded to all possessors of old clocks. Every year fine examples of old work are ruined for ever by ignorant repairers and dracaena marginata injunctions to treat the Indians humanely, to provide for their conversion and instruction by pacific means, and on no account to employ force save for self-defence.

diligence therein.  They shall not consent, or furnish occasion that the Indian natives and 

inhabitants of the said islands and and terra-firma, sustain any injury, either in their persons or 

their belongings, but they shall rather order that they be well and justly treated.  And if they [the 

Indians] have received any injury, they shall correct it and shall take measures to prevent what is

exceeded."  Reviewing the conditions in the colonies, Las Casas described the richness of the soil 

and the vast resources of the Indies, declaring that what was wanted there, were industrious, 

honest, and frugal emigrants, who would develop the agricultural sources of wealth, instead of the 

horde of rapacious adventurers and dissolute soldiery then engaged in depopulating and ruining 

them.  One by one he stripped Sepulveda's propositions of their brilliant rhetoric, exposing the 

hollowness and sham beneath the specious reasoning, with which the latter sought to cloak his 

poverty of facts. Las Casas closed his case with the following brilliant and prophetic peroration: 

"The injuries and loss which have befallen the Crown of Castile and Leon will be visited likewise 

on all Spain, because the tyranny wrought by their devastations, massacres, and slaughters is so 

monstrous, that the blind may see it, the deaf hear it, and the dumb recount it, while after our brief 

existence, the wise shall judge and condemn it.  I invoke all the hierarchies and choirs of angels, 

all the saints of the Celestial Court, all the inhabitants of the globe and especially those who may 

live after me, to witness that I free my conscience of all that has been done; and that I have fully 

exposed all these woes to his Majesty; and that if he abandons the government of the Indies to the 

tyranny of the Spaniards, they will all be lost and depopulated--as we see Hispaniola, and other 

islands and three thousand leagues of the continent destitute of inhabitants.  For these reasons, 

God will punish Spain and all her people with inevitable severity. So may it be!"(72)  Language 

worthy of a saint and a statesman, in which there breathed the spirit of prophecy, for the system of 

government, once initiated by the Spanish officials, was persisted in till the end, while one by one 

the great possessions of Spain in the New World were torn from the mother country.  In no land 

where freedom of speech was a recognised right, could an orator have used plainer language, and 

it shows both the Spanish civil and ecclesiastical authorities of that age in a somewhat unfamiliar 

light that Las Casas not only escaped perilous censures but even won a moral victory over his 

talented opponent.  What would have become of the champion of such unpopular doctrines, 

attacking as he did the material interests of thousands of the greatest men in the land, had there 

been daily newspapers in those times, it is not difficult to imagine.  Examples of the defenders of 

forlorn causes are not wanting in our own day, and the fate of those who lead an unpopular 

crusade is the pillory of the press, which spares no less than did the fires of the mediaeval stake. 

The discovery and conquest of the American dominions brought ruin to Spain as a nation; beyond 

the tribute of glory which those early achievements yielded to the Spanish name, the results were 

disastrous to her power. During centuries, much of the best blood of her prolific people was 

drained by the Americas, so that the population of the peninsula to-day is little more numerous 

than in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, whereas her territory and natural resources might 

maintain triple their number.      CHAPTER XXI. - SAN GREGORIO DE VALLADOLID. LAST 

LABOURS.  THE DEATH OF LAS CASAS   Although the forensic encounter with Sepulveda was 

the most dramatic incident in the latter years of the life of Las Casas after his return to Spain, its 

conclusion was not followed either by his disappearance or by any diminution of his activity as 

Protector of the Indians.  His habitual residence from that time on became the College of San 

Gregorio at Valladolid, where he had the companionship of his devoted friend Ladrada and the 

support of an important community of his Order.  Fray Rodrigo, who also acted as confessor to his 

old friend, would seem to have been something of a wag, as it is related of him that when the 

Bishop had become somewhat deaf, the confessor might be heard that examples coming in the 



possession of collectors can readily be checked by this list. But the fact that a maker's name is not 

in this directory does not exclude him from recognition as a master, though possibly he may not be 

one of the great masters.  =The Several Branches of a Great Art.=--The timekeeper--whether it be 

the scientific astronomical clock, or the chronometer used by mariners, or the modern watch, 

minute in size but recording time with accuracy, or the bracket or table clock, or the long-case 

clock--has proceeded on parallel lines of development. These types represent the several 

branches of the great art of clockmaking.  Clockmakers and watchmakers very soon specialized 

when the correct standard had been reached, and further inventions effected economy in 

mechanism rather than drastic changes in principle making for further exactitude. Specialization 

may be said to have undone clockmaking. We realize that the clockmaker could not cast the brass 

spandrel ornaments and chase them, or engrave the dial. We do not expect him to, nor did he, lay 

the marquetry, or become a lacquer varnisher in the cases. We cannot call upon him to cast the 

bell in the chiming movement, or to make the catgut which is wound around the drum carrying the 

weights. Nor was he an expert in metal design to pierce the hands and employ delicate ornament 

in so doing. Perhaps we may forgive him employing a special trade to supply him with delicate 

springs. But the factory system of the middle nineteenth century began to eat into the vitals of 

clockmaking in this country as a scientific craft. Makers of wheels, makers of chains, makers of 

every conceivable part of the movement sprang into being. No one of whom was a clockmaker, 

and no unit of any such industry could put a clock together. The clockmaker, and even then there 

is something personal yet remaining, became an assembler of component parts. He certainly 

understood the completed whole and made the wheels move and the hands record exact and 

perfect time. That is something, and it is a very great thing too. But how shorn of his former glory is 

the clockmaker in these conditions!  In this volume we deal with the collecting period, which is the 

stage prior to this, but it is possible to look ahead as well as backward. Factory-made clocks will 

be made, perfect timekeepers without doubt. But there is still the great possibility that the 

clockmaker may seize his own and wrest the laurels from the impersonal syndicate. To him who 

can add personality to a clock--that something which parts put together with mechanical precision 

lack--there awaits a glorious heritage. The soul of the living clock must echo the soul of its human 

maker. The old masters have left to posterity living organisms which will not die. It rests with the 

public to say whether they prefer the gramophone to the singer, the piano-player to the 

accomplished pianist. If the clock of tomorrow is to be a mere soulless machine, the demand will 

be met. But if it is to revert to that higher plane of the old masters of clockmaking, it is for those 

who love beauty and truth to make their desires imperative. For the moment, therefore, the study 

of the old and the perfect claims the loving attention of the collector who sees new lamps, like 

those which the magician in Aladdin's palace proffered for sale, in place of old.  =What to Value 

and what to Collect.=--The appreciation of old clocks is a natural gift. To one his mezzotints, to 

another his Chelsea china, to another his old silver plate. But to all lovers of fine furniture the 

English clock appeals sympathetically. It has a twofold claim to recognition. It is, if it be a fine old 

English clock by an English maker, a reliable piece of mechanism as a timekeeper. It is in certain 

periods representative, in its marquetry or lacquered case, of styles of decoration and design now 

only equalled by copyists. If it is by one of the leading English clockmakers its movements are 

unequalled. It stands as a monument 


_
penitent: "Don't you see, Bishop, that you will finish up in hell because of your want of zeal in 

defending the Indians whom God has placed in your charge?"(73)  The royal India Council 

likewise sat in Valladolid, and this fact may possibly have influenced the indefatigable Bishop's 

choice of that city for his residence.  He had made repeated efforts to obtain from the Council 

some positive proclamation or declaration, affirming the freedom of the Indians as a natural and 

inalienable right, and at this time, he succeeded in moving extinct. The great English clockmakers 

of the first flight "were not of an age but for all time."  Roughly speaking, the first twenty-five years 

of the eighteenth century and the first thirty-five years of the nineteenth century represent two 

periods when the clockmaker was doing splendid work. The clocks of the intervening period are of 

value as representing work of extreme carefulness, and are of course worthy of the attention and 

admiration of the collector.  In the first period a crowd of skilled scientific clockmakers followed 


_
more explicit information on this subject, before reaching a decision.  In response to an order from 

the Council, Las Casas wrote his treatise entitled, _The Liberty of the Enslaved Indians_ (_De la 

libertad de los Indios que han sido reducidos a la esclavitud_) which, for greater convenience, he 

divided into three parts.   The first part treated of the nullity of the title on which such slavery was 

based; the second dealt with the duties of the Spanish sovereign towards the Indians, and the 

third was devoted to the obligations of the bishops of the American dioceses.  In none of his 

writings are the opinions of Las Casas on questions of the rights of man and the functions of 

government more lucidly set forth, and while many of the arguments on which he rested his 

propositions, and which were consonant with the prevalent spirit of his times, would not secure 

universal assent in our day, there is not one of the essential principles of his thesis, that has not 

since been recognised as inherently and indisputably just.  His treatise opened as follows:  "I 

propose in this article to demonstrate three propositions; first, that all the Indians who have been 

enslaved since the discovery of the New World, have been reduced to this sad condition without 

right or justice; second that the majority of Spaniards who hold Indian slaves do so in bad faith; 

and third, that this imputation is also applicable to such Spaniards as have not acquired their 

slaves by right of repartimiento but have obtained them from other Indians."  He combated the 

almost universally accepted theory that justifiable conquest conferred the right of enslaving the 

conquered, and he maintained that the most that might be exacted from a conquered people, even 

from those who had actively resisted, was recognition of the government established by the 

victorious party; taxes were justifiable and must be paid, and prisoners of war might be held until 

the close of hostilities, while extra burdens might be laid upon the country during the period of 

military occupation.  Not one of these principles was at that time acted upon by any Christian 

power engaged in war with uncivilised nations, yet every one of them is now placed beyond 

dispute by the universally accepted principles of international law.  Wars unjustly undertaken, 

according to Las Casas, could confer no rights, because right is not founded upon injustice, and 

he defined war as unjust when undertaken without the sanction of legitimate authority, or even 

when ordered by legitimate authority, but without sufficient motive or provocation.  This touched 

the question of the Indians very closely, for most of the Spanish invasions of the different islands 

and the countries of the mainland were begun without any authority from, or each other in rapid 

succession and brought the art of horology to perfection. During this first period the clock cases 

and the clock dials came under artistic impulses not since equalled. It therefore follows that for 

these two reasons the clocks of the first period are most highly appreciated and are of great value. 

The second period, that is, the first thirty-five years of the nineteenth century, represents an era of 

established and sound technique, exhibiting craftsmanship of a high order struggling for 

supremacy and recognition at a time when factory inventions and factory-made substitutes 

commenced to dominate not only the art of the clockmaker but other personal crafts. During this 

time the case and the dial cannot be said to possess the high artistic qualities found in the earlier 

period. Art was beginning to sink into the Slough of Despond which for half a century 

characterized most European arts, both fine and applied.  =Hints for Beginners.=--To set out to 

buy an old clock is for the tyro like setting out to buy a horse. In the latter case the teeth may be 

filed and the hoofs pared to give a simulation of youth to which possibly the beast could not lay 

claim. In the former, added touches would counterfeit antiquity: here a pair of apparently old 



hands, there an antiquated-looking dial, and an enshrining case of no particular period, but 

seeming to bear Time's own impress of age, till one is inclined to say, to quote the _Merchant of 

Venice_: "I never knew so young a body with so old a head."  The following chapters will indicate 

the outline of a complex and intricate subject. The case, the dial, the hands, all have to be studied 

with no little skill in comparison and deduction in regard to errors in clumsy repairers or unskilled 

restorers, who with vandal hands have destroyed the balance of fine work and introduced 

component parts which are harlequin to the trained collector's eye. This much for the _visible_. 

Then there is the movement, that is, the mechanism which makes the clock a clock. This is 

unseen by the average snapper-up of old clocks, or when seen not understood. There are those 

collectors who stop short in their requirements. A clock is an ornament to a well appointed home, 

in the hall, in the smoking-room, or in the dining-room. They are unconcerned as to whether it is a 

timekeeper or a monument, "long to be patient and silent to wait like a ghost that is speechless." 

One longs to call aloud to such an encumbrance with its dead wheels and its atrophied hands: 

"Watchman! What of the night?" It is a servant that serves no longer. It is like a poor relation 

thrusting his company upon his fellow-guests with dumb tongue and a solemn demeanour telling 

of former glories.  But the sane modern collector wants an old clock 


_
knowledge of the Spanish government.  No Spanish sovereign ever authorised the invasion or 

conquest of any of the countries, on which their distant and self-styled representatives embarked, 

for motives of personal aggrandisement or in a pure spirit of adventure.  Both Velasquez in Cuba 

and Cortes in Mexico were destitute of any royal authority for their undertakings, and only the 

splendour of their successes sufficed to condone their license, when they were able to confront 

the King with a profitable fait accompli. The royal instructions to all governors and but because he 

rightly has assumed that there are certain qualities of the old clockmaker's art which are not to be 

found in later periods. Wise in his generation, he places himself not in the hands of a dealer who 

has sold a thousand clocks, but in the hands of a practical clockmaker who has made one. A 

trained man having a knowledge of old movements, and to whom they are something more than 

inanimate objects, will advise the collector. To such a man a clock is something with a soul. To 

him one goes who will set the silent wheels moving and endow the dead clockmaker's
