philodendron monstera will hear another tale, even in that noble home of bo=

s," said Harold with a twinkle in his eye. "Your Majesty tells a tale so we=
ll, I fain to leave you for a few moments. I will go and say good-night to =

 the room, but did not raise my head, and indeed only slowly comprehended t=
he purport of her last speech. As it dawned upon me, the hopelessness of _
gently, and crept in. I flashed my lantern upon the shelves. Ah! There they=
 were,--six beautiful,=20

brown, luscious apple pies, as you had said. Um! Um! I could hardly wait to=
 begin. I pulled out my=20

dagger and attacked one of them. It melted in the mouth like magic! Just th=
en I heard a hullabaloo=20

from your bedroom. What lungs you have, you rascal!"  "I yelled as loudly a=
s I could," said Harold=20

modestly. "But Robert can make more noise."  "I hope I may never hear him, =
then!" cried Red Rex.=20

"Well; I heard the key turn in the lock, and knew you had trapped me, you d=
og! I heard steps on=20

the stair, and knew I had no time to waste. Hastily I put the five remainin=
g pies in my basket and=20

made for the window. I knew it would never do for me to be caught in Kising=
ton! To be sure, there=20

was a truce. But I did not know how your Magistrates might regard the right=
 of a King to take his=20

own way with a truce. What triumph for your city to capture me, the besiegi=
ng War-Lord! It might=20

not be. But your pantry window is of a smallness! I nearly perished in my a=
ttempt to squeeze=20

through. The glass cut my hand and my forehead. I thought once I was stuck =
for good. Some one=20

clutched at my enough."  "You can surely have no difficulty in finding some=
 one who would lend=20

you the money, provided you were to pay a sufficiently high rate of interes=
t."  The tinge which had=20

not left Lady Broadhem's cheek deepened as she answered me, "Frank, it was =
on no hasty=20

impulse that I telegraphed for you. I do not feel bound to enter into all t=
he details of my private=20

affairs, but I do feel that if there is one man in the world upon whom, at =
such a crisis, I have a right=20

to rely, it is he to whom I have promised my daughter, and who professes to=
 be devotedly attached=20

to her."  "In short, Lady Broadhem," said I, rising and taking up my hat, "=
you are willing to part with=20

your daughter to me on condition of my paying a first instalment of L27,000=
 down, with the=20

prospect of 'calls' to an unlimited extent looming in the background. I dou=
bt whether you will find=20

Chundango prepared to go into such a very hazardous speculation, but I shou=
ld recommend you=20

to apply to him."  At that moment I heard Lady Ursula's voice in the hall, =
and the rustle of her dress=20

as she went up-stairs. I was on my way to the door, but I stopped abruptly,=
 and turned upon Lady=20

Broadhem. She was saying=20


_
priceless, woven tissue of the East; but I let it go."  "We have it safe," =
said Harold.  "I shall never=20

claim it," asserted Red Rex. "Well, soon I was safe outside. I found myself=
 in your back garden, on=20

the city wall. You folk are so careless,--to build houses on a city wall! F=
rom there one can drop into=20

safety without any trouble. I did so. It is your own fault if fugitives esc=
ape from your city,--say I.=20

Whatever happens to you, it is your own fault,--say I!"  "Then it will be y=
our own fault if I tell this=20

tale of you to our City Fathers to-morrow,--say I." Harold looked at Red Re=
x mischievously.  "Nay,"=20

said the Red King hastily. "You must not betray me. This tale must not beco=
me common history.=20

No one will understand my point of view. I begin to think that no one will =
see my bravery in making=20

this attempt. So few persons are open-minded and generous! You will not tel=
l your City Fathers,=20

Harold? _Noblesse oblige_, remember. You are my guest, and I have told you =
a tale in return for=20

yours. I could detain you by force, breaking the truce yet once more. But I=
 will not do so. I suppose=20

I am a fool!"  Harold had been thinking hard. "No; I will not tell the stor=
y,--but on two conditions."=20

"What are they?" asked Red and silenced as I looked at her fixedly. If a gl=
ance can convey=20

meaning, I flatter myself my eyes were not devoid of expression at that mom=
ent. "What!" I thought,=20

"is it reserved for the mother of the girl I love to make me call her 'a ha=
zardous speculation'?" It is=20

impossible for me to describe the intensity of the hatred which I felt at t=
his moment for the woman=20

who had caused me for one second to think of Ursula as a marketable commodi=
ty, who should be=20

offered for purchase to an Oriental adventurer. The only being I despised m=
ore than Lady=20

Broadhem was myself;--because she chose to take my angel off the pedestal o=
n which I had=20

placed her and throw her into the dirt, was I calmly to acquiesce in the pr=
oceeding? The storm=20

raging within me seemed gradually to blind me to external objects; my great=
 love was battling with=20

remorse, indignation, and despair; and I stood wavering and distracted, loo=
king, as it were, within=20

for rest and without for comfort, till the light seemed to leave my eyes, a=
nd the fire which had=20

flashed from them for a moment became suddenly extinguished.  I was recalle=
d to consciousness=20

by an exclamation from Lady Broadhem. "Heavens, Frank, don't stare so wildl=
y--you quite frighten=20

me! I have only=20


_
"The first is this," said Harold. "For the sake of the pies you stole (one =
of which was your own),=20

during the siege of Kisington you shall spare from force or damage that par=
t of the city in which=20

stands my mother's little house."  "Gladly will I promise that," agreed the=
 Red King.  "Spare the=20

_north_, then," said Harold, pointing. "You must not aim any weapons agains=
t the north."  "The=20

north is safe," repeated Red Rex. "I agree not to point weapon or aim force=
 against the north=20

section of your city."  "Then all Kisington is saved!" cried Harold. "Alrea=
dy, before now, Your=20

Majesty has promised to spare the _east_,--for the sake of Gerda's garden; =
the _west_,--for the=20

children's school, in the name of your Hope. Now you promise to spare the _=
north_. The south=20

only remains,--and that is _here_, Your Majesty, outside the walls!"  Red R=
ex grinned sheepishly.=20

"Harold," he said. "You have outwitted me, and outplayed me. Kisington is i=
ndeed safe from me. I=20

have no choice now but to raise the siege and go my way home. And to tell y=
ou the truth, I shall=20

not be sorry to spare the town. Since visiting, even so briefly, within you=
r walls, seeing the kind-

faced people, the in a manner which nothing but the excitability of your te=
mperament can excuse. I=20

assure you I am worried enough without having my cares added to by your unk=
indness. There, if=20

you want to know the exact state of my affairs, look through my papers--you=
 will find I am a=20

woman of business; and I have got an accurate list which I shall be able to=
 explain. Of course all=20

the more important original documents are at my solicitor's."  I sat moodil=
y down without=20

answering this semi-conciliatory, semi-plaintive speech. I did not even tak=
e the trouble to analyse=20

it. I felt morally and physically exhausted. The long journey, the suspense=
, and this=20

_denouement_, had prostrated me. I took up the papers Lady Broadhem offered=
 me, and turned=20

them vacantly over. I read the list, but failed to attach any meaning to th=
e items over which my=20

gaze listlessly wandered. I felt that Lady Broadhem was watching me curious=
ly, but every effort I=20

made to grasp the details before me failed hopelessly. At last I threw the =
packet down in despair,=20

and, leaning over the table, clasped my bursting forehead with my hands.  "=
Dear Frank," said Lady=20

Broadhem, and for the first time her voice betrayed signs=20


_
and especially the noble library, I have conceived an affection for the pla=
ce. I am glad of an=20

excuse not to destroy it. If it were possible, indeed, I would that I might=
 see the interior of that=20

house of books. I would fain know more of the Chronicles of Kisington."  "W=
hy may it not be, Your=20

Majesty?" said Harold. "We will say nothing of this night's adventure. Come=
 to-morrow with a flag=20

of truce and be our guest, even as I have been yours. I will show you our b=
ut I did it all for the best.=20

You can understand now why I hesitated to tell you everything at first. You=
 don't know how much it=20

has cost me, and to what means I am obliged to resort to keep up my courage=
; besides, I have got=20

into such a habit of concealment that I could not bear that even you should=
 know the desperate=20

state of our affairs, though I had no idea that in so short a time you coul=
d have unravelled such=20

complicated accounts and arrived at the=20
