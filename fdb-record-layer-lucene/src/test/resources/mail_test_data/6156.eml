ruins; for "build Thou the walls" would be no less appropriate a petition i=
f the fortifications were=20

unfinished (as we know they were in David's time) than if they had been bro=
ken down. Nor do the=20

words contradict the view of sacrifice just given, for the use of the symbo=
l and the conviction of its=20

insufficiency co-existed, in fact, in every devout life, and may well be ex=
pressed side by side. But=20

the transition from so intensely personal emotions to intercession for Zion=
 seems almost too=20

sudden even for a nature as wide and warm as David's. If the closing verses=
 are his, we may,=20

indeed, see in them the king re-awaking to a sense of his responsibilities,=
 which he had so long=20

neglected, first, in the selfishness of his heart, and then in the morbid s=
elf-absorption of his=20

remorse; and the lesson may be a precious one that the first thought of a p=
ardoned man should be=20

for others. But there is much to be said, on the other hand, in favour of t=
he conjecture that these=20

verses are a later addition, probably after the return from captivity, when=
 the walls of Zion were in=20

ruins, and the altar of the temple had been long cold. If so, then our psal=
m, as it came from=20

David's full heart, would be all of a piece--one great gush of penitence an=
d faith, beginning with,=20

"Have mercy upon me, O God," ending with the assurance of acceptance, and s=
o remaining for all=20

ages their sacredly quiet time, or it might have been through the larger as=
sociation of the words=20

with the Redeemer's presence beside the bedridden; but here her dexterous f=
ingers came to a=20

stop on the lace-pillow, and clasped themselves round his neck as he bent d=
own. There was great=20

natural sensibility in both father and daughter, the visitor could easily s=
ee; but each made it, for the=20

other's sake, retiring, not demonstrative; and perfect cheerfulness, intuit=
ive or acquired, was either=20

the first or second nature of both.  In a very few moments, Lamps was takin=
g another rounder with=20

his comical features beaming, while Phoebe's laughing eyes (just a glisteni=
ng speck or so upon=20

their lashes) were again directed by turns to him, and to her work, and to =
Barbox Brothers.  "When=20

my father, sir," she said brightly, "tells you about my being interested in=
 other people even though=20

they know nothing about me--which, by-the-by, I told you myself--you ought =
to know how that=20

comes about. That's my father's doing."  "No, it isn't!" he protested.  "Do=
n't you believe him, sir;=20

yes, it is.  He tells me of everything he sees down at his work.  You would=
 be surprised what a=20

quantity he gets together for me every day.  He looks into the carriages, a=
nd tells me how the=20

ladies are drest--so that I know all the fashions!  He looks into the carri=
ages, and tells me what=20
