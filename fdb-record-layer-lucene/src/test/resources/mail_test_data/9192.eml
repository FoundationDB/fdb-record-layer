exasperate him.  "What were you going to say?" I quietly inquired.  "Oh, hell!" he exclaimed, with 

quite unexpected vigor.  "I hope the children are out of hearing," I reminded him, solemn-eyed. 

"Yes, the children!" he cried, catching at the word exactly as a drowning man catches at a lifebelt. 

"The children! That's just the root of the whole intolerable situation. This hasn't been a home for 

the last three or four years; it's been nothing but a nursery. And about all I've been is a retriever for 

a _creche_, a clod-hopper to tiptoe about the sacred circle and see to it there's enough flannel to 

cover their backs and enough food to put into their stomachs. I'm an accident, of course, an 

intruder to be faced with fortitude and borne with patience."  "This sounds quite disturbing," I 

interrupted. "It almost leaves me suspicious that you are about to emulate the rabbit and devour 

your young."  Dinky-Dunk fixed me with an accusatory finger.  "And the fact that you can get 

humor out of it shows me just how far it has gone," he cried with a bitterness which quickly enough 

made me sober again. "And I could stand being deliberately shut out of your life, and shut out of 

their lives as far as you can manage it, but I can't see that it's doing either them or you any 

particular good."  "But I am responsible for the way in which those children grow up," I said, quite 

innocent of the _double entendre_ which brought a dark flush to my husband's none too happy 

face.  "And I suppose I'm not to contaminate them?" he demanded.  "Haven't you done enough 

along that line?" I asked.  He swung about, at that, with something dangerously like hate on his 

face.  "Whose children are they?" he challenged.  "You are their father," I quietly acknowledged. It 

rather startled me to find Dinky-Dunk regarding himself as a fur coat and my offspring as moth-

eggs which I had laid deep in the pelt of his life, where we were slowly but surely eating the glory 

out of that garment and leaving it as bald as a prairie dog's belly.  "Well, you give very little 

evidence of it!"  "You can't expect me to turn a cart-wheel, surely, every time I remember it?" was 

my none too gracious inquiry. Then I sat down. "But what is it you want me to do?" I asked, as I 

sat studying his face, and I felt sorriest for him because he felt sorry for himself.  "That's exactly 

the point," he averred. "There doesn't seem anything to do. But this can't go on forever."  "No," I 

acknowledged. "It seems too much like history repeating itself."  His head went down, at that, and 

it was quite a long time before he looked up at me again.  "I don't suppose you can see it from my 

side of the fence?" he asked with a disturbing new note of humility in his voice.  "Not when you 

force me to stay on the fence," I told him. He seemed to realize, as he sat there slowly moving his 

head up and down, that no further advance was to be made along that line. So he took a deep 

breath and sat up.  "Something will have to be done about getting a new teacher for that school," 

he said with an appositeness which was only too painfully apparent.  "I've already spoken to two of 

the trustees," I told him. "They're getting a teacher from the Peg. It's to be a man this time." 

Instead of meeting my eye, he merely remarked: "That'll be better for the boy!"  "In what way?" I 

inquired.  "Because I don't think too much petticoat is good for any boy," responded my lord and 

master.  "Big or little!" I couldn't help amending, in spite of all my good intentions.  Dinky-Dunk 

ignored the thrust, though it plainly took an effort.  "There are times when even kindness can be a 

sort of cruelty," he patiently and somewhat platitudinously pursued.  "Then I wish somebody would 

ill-treat me along that line," I interjected. And this time he smiled, though it was only for a moment. 

"Supposing we stick to the business, in shaking the confidence of the people. With laughable 

infatuation he sedulously employed every opportunity of proving to the world the hopeless 

incapacity which made it impossible for him to seize the natural connection between cause and 



effect. With a rare _naivete_ he confessed publicly and without hesitation the mistaken 

conclusions he had come to in the weightiest affairs of State; mistakes with the commonest 

understanding could have discovered, which filled the impartial with pitying astonishment, and 

caused terror and consternation even among the host of his flatterers and partisans. Yet, so great 

and so strong was the preconceived opinion of the people in his favour, that only the irresistible 

proofs furnished by the man's own actions could gradually shake this opinion. It required the full 

force and obstinacy of this strange self-deception in Wellington, it required the full measure of his 

activity and iron persistency, in order at last, by a perpetual reiteration of errors and mistakes, to 

create in the people the firm conviction that the Duke of Wellington was one of the least adroit and 

most mischievous Ministers that England ever had."  Stockmar formed a more favourable opinion 

afterwards, when the Duke had ceased to be a party leader, and become the Nestor of the State. 

But it must be allowed that Wellington's most intimate associates and warmest friends thought him 

a failure as a politician. To the last he seemed incapable of understanding the position of a 

constitutional minister, and talked of sacrificing his convictions in order to support the Government, 

as though he were not one of the Government that was to be supported. Nor did he ever 

appreciate the force of opinion or the nature of the great European movement with which he had 

to deal.  It seems clear from Stockmar's statement, that Wellington used his influence over 

Charles X to get the Martignac Ministry, which was moderately liberal, turned out and Polignac 

made Minister. In this he doubly blundered. In the first place Polignac was not friendly but hostile 

to England, and at once began to intrigue against her; in the second place he was a fool, and by 

his precipitate rashness brought on the second French Revolution, which overthrew the 

ascendency of the Duke's policy in Europe, and had no small influence in overthrowing the 

ascendency of his party in England. It appears that the Duke was as much impressed with the 

"honesty" of Talleyrand, as he was with the "ability" of Polignac.  A certain transitional phase of the 

European Revolution created a brisk demand for kings who would "reign without governing." 

Having backed out of Greece, Leopold got Belgium. And here we enter, in these Memoirs, on a 

series of chapters giving the history of the Belgian Question, with all its supplementary 

entanglements, as dry as saw-dust, and scarcely readable, we should think, at the present day, 

even to diplomatists, much less to mortal men. Unfortunately the greater part of the two volumes is 

taken up with similar dissertations on various European questions, while the personal touches, 

and details which Stockmar could have given us in abundance, are few and far between. We 

seldom care much for his opinions on European questions even when the questions themselves 

are still alive and the sand-built structures of diplomacy have not been swept away by the 

advancing tide of revolution. The sovereigns whose wirepuller he was were constitutional, and 

themselves exercised practically very little influence on the course of events.  In the Belgian 

question however, he seems to have really played an active part. We get from him a strong 

impression of the restless vanity and unscrupulous ambition of France. We learn also that Leopold 

practised very early in the day the policy which assured him a quiet reign--that of keeping his trunk

"Of course," I agreed. "And since you've brought the matter up I can't help telling you that I always 

felt that my love for my children is the one redeeming thing in my life."  "Thanks," said my 

husband, with a wince.  "Please don't misunderstand me. I'm merely trying to say that a mother's 

love for her children has to be one of the strongest and holiest things in this hard old world of ours. 

And it seems only natural to me that a woman should consider her children first, and plan for 

understand that if they were tired of him he was ready to take the next train and leave them to 

enjoy the deluge.  Stockmar found employment especially suited to him in settling the question of 

Leopold's English annuity, which was given up on the Price's election to the Crown of Belgium, but 

with certain reservations, upon which the Radicals made attacks, Sir Samuel Whalley, a physician 

leading the van. In the course of the struggle Stockmar received a characteristic letter from 

Palmerston.

has to."  "It's so natural, in fact," remarked Dinky-Dunk, "that it has been observed in even the 

Bengal tigress."  "It is my turn to thank you," I acknowledged, after giving his statement a moment 

or two of thought.  "But we're getting away from the point again," proclaimed my husband. "I've 

been trying to tell you that children are like rabbits: It's only fit and proper they should be cared for,
