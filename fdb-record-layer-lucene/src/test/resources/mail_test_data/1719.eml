dracaena marginata Gantry in the corridor. Blount strolled on by himself, and, finding the smoking-room unoccupied, went to lounge in a lazy-chair standing in a little crowding into her without any order or method in their movements.

that settles it!"  Gantry was plainly shocked. "You're not trying to make me believe that you've got 

nerve enough to buck the old m--your father, I mean? Why, great cats, Evan! you don't know what 

that stands for in the greasewood hills!"  "And I don't care, Dick. Up to this present moment I am a 

free moral agent; I haven't surrendered any right of decision to my father, or to any one else, so far 

as I am aware."  Gantry's eyes dropped to his plate, and his rejoinder was not wholly free from 

guile.  "Will you authorize me to contradict the talk as I can?" he asked, without looking up.  Blount 

was still warm enough to be peremptory.  "Yes, you may contradict it. You may say that it is 

entirely unauthorized--that I have told you so myself." Then he remembered the claims of 

friendship. "I'll be frank with you, Dick; this thing has been mentioned any orders the commander 

had to give him. The collision had been a surprise to him. It had not occurred to him that Captain 

Scott would resort to such an extreme measure, though he had hinted at something of the kind 

early in the morning.  "I suppose we may consider the battle as ended, Louis," said Scott, as the 

other took his place on the opposite side of the wheel, where he could see out of the front window 

on the port.  "I should say that it was decidedly ended, and in the most decisive manner," replied 

Louis, though his thoughts were not a little scattered and confused by the exciting events of the 

last few moments. "What next?"  "If the pirates undertake to board us with their boats, we must be 

ready to repel them," replied Scott.  "Board us! Why, the water is pouring into that hole in her side 

as through a mill-sluice!" exclaimed Louis.

didn't even promise to take it under advisement."  Among those who knew him only externally, Mr. 

Richard Gantry had the reputation of owning a loose tongue. But none recognized more justly than 

the real Richard Gantry the precise instant at which to bridle the loose tongue or when to make it 

wag away from the subject which has reached its nicely calculated climax. While the  "But they are 

lowering their boats; and it remains to be seen what they intend to do with them."  All the hands on 

board of the Fatime appeared to be Moors, for they were all dressed in Oriental costume. By this 

time she was letting off steam with a tremendous racket. The crew were casting loose the boats at 

the quarter davits. If there was an English engineer on board of her,

still making him ashamed that he had shown so much warmth, Blount found himself gossiping with 

his table companion over a social function two days old; and subsequently, when the waiter 

brought the cigars, Gantry was congratulating himself that the danger-point, if any there were, was 

safely past.  It was after the club luncheon, and while the two young men were on their way 

clothed himself in Moorish costume, for no one in a European dress could be seen.  "She is 

settling in the water," said Louis, as he observed the condition of the disabled vessel.  "In a word, 

Louis, she is going to the bottom!" exclaimed Captain Scott. "Do you see anything of Mazagan?" 

"I have been looking for him, but I can't make him out," replied Louis.  By this time
