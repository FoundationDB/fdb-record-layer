philodendron monstera tempter of souls, knew well enough that there was som=

rst thing in the morning, the day after a ball at a house where he met the =
British Secretary for Foreign _
as ever again.  Mrs. Fuddles's manner was an utter contrast to that of the =
visitor just before her.=20

She was excited and flurried in her greeting; she declared that she was del=
ighted to see her dear=20

old friend again, and looking well, wonderfully well, all things considered=
; only she'd need to take=20

plenty of good nourishing stuff to get up her strength again, after such a =
terrible illness. "A little=20

drop of something, taken hot, just the first thing in the morning, my dear;=
 I've known it work=20

wonders," said the publican's wife, who doubtless spoke from personal exper=
ience.  "You forget=20

I've taken the pledge," replied Nancy, who needed no explanation as to the =
nature of the "drop"=20

recommended.  "Now, really, I heard something about it, but I could not bel=
ieve it. A sensible=20

woman like you! But people do get round sick folks, and wheedle, and coax, =
and frighten them=20

so!"  "No one ever wheedled, or coaxed, or frightened _me_," replied Nancy,=
 sternly; "what I did, I=20

did of my own free will, and I'll hold to it too."  "To be best I can for y=
ou." (I could see that my tears=20

had moved him.) "A grief to you would be a blow to Paris. Yet--well, as you=
 have been frank, I owe=20

it to you to be equally so on my side. I should before this have sent--quit=
e privately and in a=20

friendly way, to question you about this Mr. Dundas, who passed under anoth=
er name at the hotel=20

where you called upon him; but I received a request from a very high quarte=
r to wait before=20

communicating with you. Now, as you have come to me, I suppose I may speak.=
"  "Ask me any=20

questions you choose," I said, "and I'll answer them."  "Then, to begin wit=
h, since you are engaged=20

to Monsieur du Laurier, how do you explain the statement you made at the ho=
tel, concerning Mr.=20

Dundas?"  "That is one of the many things I have come here on purpose to te=
ll you," I answered=20

him; "for I am going to give you my whole confidence. I throw myself upon y=
our mercy."  "You do=20

me a great honour. Will you speak without my prompting?"  "Yes. I would pre=
fer it. In England, a=20

year ago, I had a little=20


_
against your wishes," cried Mrs. Fuddles, instantly changing her ground; "y=
ou don't know how I've=20

been cut up about you,--and to think of its having happened after your leav=
ing my house, though I=20

said, and always will say, _that_ had nothing to do with a slip of the foot=
; any one might have a slip=20

of the foot; the parson himself might have tumbled into the mill-stream! Bu=
t you won't keep away=20

from the old house, Nancy, my dear," continued the publican's wife in a faw=
ning tone, edging her=20

chair nearer to that on which Mrs. Sands was seated; "you and I won't give =
up our pleasant chats=20

over a--a cup of tea, if you like it; I won't press you to anything to put =
your husband out, or to=20

offend the young parson; I'll offer you nothing stronger than tea, unless, =
of course, it was good for=20

your health?"  Mrs. Fuddles thought that she saw symptoms of yielding in he=
r of whom she dared=20

to call other. We exchanged a few silly letters, and I forgot all about the=
m until I fell in love with=20

Raoul and promised to marry him--only a short time ago. Then I couldn't bea=
r to think that I had=20

written these foolish letters, and that, perhaps, Mr. Dundas might have kep=
t them. I wrote and=20

asked if he had. He answered that he had every one, and valued them immense=
ly, but if I wished,=20

he would either burn all, or bring them to me, whichever I chose. I chose t=
o have him bring them,=20

and I told him that I'd meet him at the Elysee Palace Hotel on a certain ev=
ening, to receive the=20

letters from him."  "He came, as I said, under another name. Why was that, =
Mademoiselle, since=20

there was nothing for him to be ashamed of?"  "He also is in love, and just=
 engaged to be married=20

to an American girl who lives with relations in London, in a very high posi=
tion. He didn't want the=20

girl to know he was coming to=20
