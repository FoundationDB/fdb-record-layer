long time to stick to one woman, 'specially w'en you be'n lookin' over so many 'fore makin' up yo'

handed it over, and there was a suspicious softness in the lines of his wrinkled old face, as he 

looked fondly at the likeness of the stolid, dark features.  "Hit be'n mighty lonesome since she 

done lef' dis worl' fo' year ago," he said with feeling, as he carefully wrapped up the picture and put 

it away.  Uncle Dave has definite ideas of his own regarding domestic economy. "Trouble wid

weight of years has at last cooled the hot blood, but a hint of departed swashbuckling days still 

glistens in the old eyes as he sits on his narrow porch and recalls scenes of the old days.  To one 

interested in the psychology of the Southern negro, this shriveled old man, with his half-bantering, 

half-pathetic attitude offers an interesting study. Borrowed from a page of history, he seems a 

curiosity, like a fossil magically restored to life, endowed with the power of speech, telling of 

events so deeply buried in the past that they seem almost unreal.     FEDERAL WRITERS' 

PROJECT American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)  Pearl Randolph, Field Worker Jacksonville, 

Florida November 35, 1936  ACIE THOMAS   Mr. Thomas was at home today. There are many 

days when one might pass and repass the shabby lean-to that is his home without seeing any 

signs of life. That is because he spends much of his time foraging about the streets of Jacksonville 

for whatever he can get in the way of food or old clothes, and perhaps a little money.  He is a 

heavily bearded, bent old man and a familiar figure in the residential sections of the city, where he 

earns or begs a very meager livelihood. Many know his story and marvel at his ability to relate 

incidents that must have occured when he was quite small.  Born in Jefferson County, Florida on 

July 26, 1857, he was one of the 150 slaves belonging to the Folsom brothers, Tom and Bryant. 

His parents, Thomas and Mary, and their parents as far as they could remember, were all a part of 

the Folsom estate. The Folsoms never sold a slave except he merited this dire punishment in 

some way.  Acie heard vague rumors of the cruelties of some slave owners, but it was unknown 

among the Folsoms. He thinks this was due to the fact that certain "po white trash" in the vicinity of 

their plantation owned slaves. It was the habit of the Folsoms to buy out these people whenever 

they could do so by fair means or foul, according to his statements. And by and by there were no 

poor whites living near them. It was, he further stated like "damning a nigger's soul, if Marse Tom 

or Marse Bryant threatened to sell him to some po' white trash. And it allus brung good results--

better than tearing the hide off'n him woulda done."  As a child Acie spent much of his time 

roaming over the broad acres of the Folsom plantation with other slave children. They waded in 

the streams, fished, chased rabbits and always knew where the choicest wild berries and nuts 



grew. He knew all the wood lore common to children of his time. This he learned mostly from 

"cousin Ed" who was several years older than he and quite willing to enlighten a small boy in these 

matters.  He was taught that hooting owls were very jealous of their night hours and whenever 

they hooted near a field of workers they were saying: "Task done or no done--night's my time--go 

home!" Whippoorwills flitted about the woods in cotton picking time chattering about Jack marrying 

a widow. He could not remember the story that goes with this. Oppossums were a "sham faced" 

tribe who "sometimes wandered onto the wrong side of the day and got caught." They never 

overcame this shame as long as they were in captivity.  All bull rushes and tree stumps were to be 

carefully searched. One might find his baby brother there at any time.  When Acie "got up some 

size" he was required to do small tasks, but the master was not very exacting. There were the 

important tasks of ferreting out the nests of stray hens, turkeys, guineas and geese. These nests 

were robbed to prevent the fowls from hatching too far from the hen house. Quite a number of 

these eggs got roasted in remote corners of the plantation by the finders, who built fires and 

wrapped the eggs in wet rags and covered them with ashes. When they were done a loud pop 

announced that fact to the roaster. Potatoes were cooked in the same manner and often without 

the rags. Consequently these two tasks were never neglected by the slave children. Cotton picking 

was not a bad job either--at least to the young.  Then there was the ride to the cotton house at the 

end of the day atop the baskets and coarse burlap sheets filled with the day's pickings. Acie's 

fondest ambition was to learn to manipulate the scales that told him who had done a good day's 

work and who had not. His cousin Ed did this envied task whenever the overseer could not find the 

time.  Many other things were grown here. Corn for the cattle and "roasting ears," peanuts, 

tobacco and sugar cane. The cane was ground on the plantation and converted into barrels of 

syrup and brown sugar. The cane grinding season was always a gala one. There was always 

plenty of juice, with the skimmings and fresh syrup for all. Other industries were the blacksmith 

shop where horses and slaves were shod. The smoke houses where scores of hogs and cows 

were prepared and hung for future use. The sewing was presided over by the mistress. Clothing 

were made during the summer and stored away for the cool winters. Young slave girls were kept 

busy at knitting cotton and woolen stockings. Candles were made in the "big house" kitchen and 

only for consumption by the household of the master. Slaves used fat lightwood knots or their 

open fireplaces for lighting purposes.  There was always plenty of everything to eat for the slaves. 

They had white bread that had been made on the place. Corn meal, rice, potatoes, syrup 

vegetables and home-cured meat. Food was cooked in iron pots hung over the fireplace by rings 

made of the same metal. Bread and pastries were made in the "skillet" and "spider."  Much work 

was needed to supply the demands of so large a plantation but the slaves were often given time 

off for frolics (dances), (quilting-weddings). These gatherings were attended by old and young 

from neighboring plantations. There was always plenty of food, masters vying with another for the 

honor of giving his slaves the finest parties.  There was dancing and music. On the Folsom 

plantation Bryant, the youngest of the masters furnished the music. He played the fiddle and liked 

to see the slaves dance "cutting the pigeon wing."  Many matches were made at these affairs. The 

women came "all rigged out in their best" which was not bad at all, as the mistresses often gave 

them their cast off clothes. Some of these were very fine indeed with their frills and hoops and 

many petticoats. Those who had no finery contented themselves with scenting their hair and 



bodies with sweet herbs, which they also chewed. Quite often they were rewarded by the attention 

of some swain from a distant plantation. In this case it was necessary for their respective owners 

to consent to a union. Slaves on the Folsom plantation were always married properly and quite 

often had a "sizeable" wedding, the master and mistress often came and made merry with their 

slaves.  Acie knew about the war because he was one of the slaves commandeered by the 

Confederate army for hauling food and ammunition to different points between Tallahassee and a 

city in Virginia that he is unable to remember. It was a common occurrence for the soldiers to visit 

the plantation owners and command a certain number of horses and slaves for services such as 

Acie did.  He thinks that he might have been about 15 years old when he was freed. A soldier in 

blue came to the plantation and brought a "document" that Tom, their master read to all the slaves 

who had been summoned to the "big house" for that purpose. About half of them consented to 

remain with him. The others went away, glad of their new freedom. Few had made any plans and 

were content to wander about the country, living as they could. Some were more sober minded, 

and Acie's father was among the latter. He remained on the Folsom place for a short while; he 

then settled down to share-croping in Jefferson County. Their first year was the hardest, because 

of the many adjustments that had to be made. Then things became better. By means of hard work 

and the co-operation of friendly whites the slaves in the section soon learned to shift for 

themselves.  Northerners came South "in swarms" and opened schools for the ex-slaves, but Acie 

was not fortunate enough to get very far in his "blue back Webster." There was too much work to 

be done and his father trying to buy the land. Nor did he take an interest in the political meetings 

held in the neighborhood. His parents shared with him the common belief that such things were 

not to be shared by the humble. Some believed that "too much book learning made the brain 

weak."  Acie met and married Keziah Wright, who was the daughter of a woman his mother had 

known in slavery. Strangely enough they had never met as children. With his wife he remained in 

Jefferson County, where nine of their thirteen children were born.  With his family he moved to 

Jacksonville and had been living here "a right good while" when the fire occurred in 1903. He was 

employed as a city laborer and helped to build street car lines and pave streets. He also helped 

with the installation of electric wiring in many parts of the city. He was injured while working for the 

City of Jacksonville, but claims that he was never in any manner remunerated for this injury.  Acie 

worked hard and accumulated land in the Moncrief section and lives within a few feet of the spot 

where his house burned many years ago. He was very sad as he pointed out this spot to his 

visitor. A few scraggly hedges and an apple tree, a charred bit of fence, a chimney foundation are 

the only markers of the home he built after years of a hard struggle to have a home. His land is all 

gone except the scant five acres upon which he lives, and this is only an expanse of broom straw. 

He is no longer able to cultivate the land, not even having a kitchen garden.  Kaziah, the wife, died 

several years ago; likewise all the children, except two. One of these, a girl, is "somewhere up 

Nawth". The son has visited him twice in five years and seems never to have anything to give the 

old man, who expresses himself as desiring much to "quit die unfriendly world" since he has 

nothing to live for except a lot of dead memories.  "All done left me surely losing the footing which 

he has won on the higher round of the industrial ladder and lapsing back into penury and despair? 

What if instead of gaining he is really losing in manhood and real independence? I see nothing 

shocking in the fact that a mechanic's wages are now equal to those of a clergyman, or an officer 



in the army who has spent perhaps thousands of dollars on his education. Every man has a right 

to whatever his labour will fetch. But I do see something shocking in the appearance of the highly 

paid mechanic, whenever hard times come, as a mendicant at the door of a man really poorer 

than himself. Not only that English poor-law, of which we spoke, but all poor-laws, formal or 

informal, must cease when the labourer has the means, with proper self-control and prudence, of 

providing for winter as well as summer, for hard times as well as good times, for his family as well 

as for himself. The tradition of a by-gone state of society must be broken. The nominally rich must 

no longer be expected to take care of the nominally poor. The labourer has ceased to be in any 

sense a slave. He must learn to be, in every sense, a man.  It is much easier to recommend our 

neighbours to change their habits than to change our own, yet we must never forget, in discussing 

the question between the working man and his employer, or the community, that a slight change in 

the habits of the working men, in England at least, would add more to their wealth, their happiness 

and their hopes, than has been added by all the strikes, or by conflicts of any kind. In the life of Mr. 

Brassey, we are told that the British workman in Australia has great advantages, but wastes them 

all in drink. He does this not in Australia alone. I hate legislative interference with private habits, 

and I have no fancies about diet. A citizen of Maine, who has eaten too much pork, is just as great 

a transgressor against medical rules, and probably just as unamiable, as if he had drunk too much 

whisky. But when I have seen the havoc--the ever increasing havoc-- which drink makes with the 

industry, the vigour, the character of the British workman, I have sometimes asked myself whether 

in that case extraordinary measures might not be justified by the extremity of its dangers.  The 

subject is boundless. I might touch upon perils distinct from Unionism, which threaten industry, 

especially that growing dislike of manual labour which prevails to an alarming extent in the United 

States, and which some eminent economists are inclined to attribute to errors in the system of 

education in the common schools. I might speak of the duties of government in relation to these 

disturbances, and of the necessity, for this as well as other purposes, of giving ourselves a 

government of all and for all, capable of arbitrating impartially between conflicting interests as the 

recognised organ of the common good. I might speak, too, of the expediency of introducing into 

popular education a more social element, of teaching less rivalry and discontent, more knowledge 

of the mutual duties of different members of the community and of the connection of those duties 

with our happiness. But I must conclude. If I have thrown no new light upon the subject, I trust that 

I have at least tried to speak the truth impartially, and that I have said nothing which can add to the 

bitterness of the industrial conflict, or lead any of my hearers to forget that above all Trade Unions, 

and above all combinations of every kind, there is the great union of Humanity.     "WHAT IS 

CULPABLE LUXURY?"   A phrase in a lecture on "The Labour Movement," published in the 

_Canadian Monthly_, has been the inconsiderable cause of a considerable controversy in the 

English press and notably of a paper by the eminent economist and moralist Mr. W.R. Greg, 

entitled "What is Culpable Luxury?" in the _Contemporary Review_.  The passage of the lecture in 

which the phrase occurred was: "Wealth, real wealth, has hardly as yet much reason to complain 

of any encroachment of the Labour Movement on its rights. When did it command such means 

and appliances of pleasure, such satisfaction for every appetite and every fancy, as it commands 

now? When did it rear such enchanted palaces of luxury as it is rearing in England at the present 

day? Well do I remember one of those palaces, the most conspicuous object for miles round. _Its 



lord was I dare say consuming the income of some six hundred of the poor labouring families 

round him_. The thought that you are spending on yourself annually the income of six hundred 

labouring families seems to me about as much as a man with a heart and a brain can bear. 

Whatever the rich man desires, the finest house, the biggest diamond, the reigning beauty for his 

wife, social homage, public honour, political power, is ready at his command" &c, &c.  The words 

in italics have been separated from the context and taken as an attack on wealth. But the whole 

passage is a defence of labour against the charge of encroachment brought against it by wealth. I 

argue that, if the labouring man gets rather more than he did, the inequalities of fortune and the 

privileges of the rich are still great enough. In the next paragraph I say that "wealth well made and 

well spent is as pure as the rill that runs from the mountain side." An invidious turn has also been 

given to the expression "the income of six hundred labouring families," as though it meant that the 

wealthy idler is robbing six hundred labouring families of their income. It means no more than that 

the income which he is spending on himself is as large as six hundred of their incomes put 

together.  Mr. Greg begins with what he calls a retort courteous. He says that if the man with L30 

000 is doing this sad thing so is the man with L3000 or L300 and everyone who allows himself 

anything beyond the necessaries of life; nay, that the labouring man when he lights his pipe or 

drinks his dram is as well as the rest consuming the substance of one poorer than himself. This 

argument appears to its framer irrefutable and a retort to which there can be no rejoinder. I 

confess my difficulty is not so much in refuting it as in seeing any point in it at all. What parallel can 

there be between an enormous and a very moderate expenditure or between prodigious luxury 

and ordinary comfort? If a man taxes me with having squandered fifty dollars on a repast is it an 

irrefutable retort to tell him that he has spent fifty cents? The limited and rational expenditure of an 

industrious man produces no evils economical, social or moral. I contend in the lecture that the 

unlimited and irrational expenditure of idle millionaires does; that it wastes labour, breeds luxury, 

creates unhappiness by propagating factitious wants, too often engenders vice and is injurious for 

the most part to real civilization. I have observed and I think with truth that the most malignant 

feelings which enter into the present struggle between classes have been generated by the 

ostentation of idle wealth in contrast with surrounding poverty. It would of course be absurd to say 

this of a man living on a small income in a modest house and in a plain way.  If I had said that 

property or all property beyond a mere sustenance is theft there would be force in Mr. Greg's 

retort, but as I have said or implied nothing more than that extravagant luxury is waste and 

contrasted with surrounding poverty grates on the feelings, especially when those who waste are 

idle and those who want are the hardest working labourers in the world, I repeat that I can see no 

force in the retort at all.  Mr. Greg proceeds to analyse the expenditure of the millionaire and to 

maintain that its several items are laudable.  First he defends pleasure grounds, gardens, 

shrubberies and deer parks. But he defends them on the ground that they are good things for the 

community and thereby admits my principle. It is only against wasteful self indulgence that I have 

anything to say. No doubt, says Mr. Greg, if the land of a country is all occupied and cultivated, 

and if no more land is easily accessible, and if the produce of other lands is not procurable in 

return for manufactured articles of exchange, then a proprietor who shall employ a hundred acres 

in growing wine for his own drinking, which might or would otherwise be employed in growing 

wheat or other food for twenty poor families who can find no other field for their labour, may fairly 



be said to be consuming, spending on himself, the sustenance of those families. If, again, he, in 

the midst of a swarming population unable to find productive or remunerative occupation, insists 

upon keeping a considerable extent of ground in merely ornamental walks and gardens, and, 

therefore, useless as far as the support of human life is concerned, he may be held liable to the 

same imputation--even though the wages he pays to the gardeners in the one case, and the vine-

dressers in the other, be pleaded in mitigation of the charge. Let the writer of this only allow, as he 

must, that the moral, social and political consequences of expenditure are to be taken into account 

as well as the economical consequences, and he will be entirely at one with the writer whom he 

supposes himself to be confuting. I have never said, or imagined, that "all land ought to be 

producing food." I hold that no land in England is better employed than that of the London parks 

and the gardens of the Crystal Palace, though I could not speak so confidently with regard to a 

vast park from which all are excluded but its owner. Mr. Greg here again takes up what seems to 

me the strange position that to condemn excess is to condemn moderation. He says that whatever 

is said against the great parks and gardens of the most luxurious millionaire may equally be said 

against a tradesman's little flower-garden, or the plot of ornamental ground before the cottage 

windows of a peasant. I must again say that, so far from regarding this argument as irrefutable, I 

altogether fail to discover its cogency. The tradesman's little bit of green, the peasant's flower- 

bed, are real necessities of a human soul. Can the same thing be said of a pleasure-ground which 

consumes the labour of twenty men, and of which the object is not to refresh the weariness of 

labour but to distract the vacancy of idleness?  Mr. Greg specially undertakes the defence of deer-

parks. But his ground is that the deer-forests which were denounced as unproductive have been 

proved to be the only mode of raising the condition and securing the well-being of the ill-fed 

population. If so, "humanitarians" are ready to hold up both hands in favour of deer-forests. Nay, 

we are ready to do the same if the pleasure yielded by the deer-forests bears any reasonable 

proportion to the expense and the agricultural sacrifice, especially if the sportsman is a worker 

recruiting his exhausted brain, not a sybarite killing time.  From parks and pleasure-grounds Mr. 

Greg goes on to horses; and here it is the same thing over again. The apologist first sneers at 

those who object to the millionaire's stud, then lets in the interest of the community as a limiting 

principle, and ends by saying: "We may then allow frankly and without demur, that if he (the 

millionaire) maintains more horses than he needs or can use, his expenditure thereon is strictly 

pernicious and indefensible, precisely in the same way as it would be if he burnt so much hay and 

threw so many bushels of oats into the fire. He is destroying human food." Now Mr. Greg has only 

to determine whether a man who is keeping a score or more of carriage and saddle horses, is 

"using" them or not. If he is, "humanitarians" are perfectly satisfied.  Finally Mr. Greg comes to the 

case of large

Moncrief Road Jacksonville, Florida     FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT American Guide, (Negro 

Writers' Unit)  Martin Richardson, Field Worker South Jacksonville, Florida December 8, 1936 

SHACK THOMAS, Centenarian   Beady-eyed, grey-whiskered, black little Shack Thomas sits in 

the sun in front of his hut on the Old Saint Augustine Road about three miles south of Jacksonville, 

102 years old and full of humorous reminiscences about most of those years. To his frequent 

visitors he relates tales of his past, disjointedly sometimes but with a remarkable clearness and 

conviction.  The old ex-slave does not remember the exact time of his birth, except that it was in 

the year 1834, "the day after the end of the Indian War." He does not recall which of the Indian 

wars, but says that it was while there were still many Indians in West Florida who were very hard 

for him to understand when he got big enough to talk, to them.  He was born, he says on "a great 

big place that b'longed to Mister Jim Campbell; I don't know just exactly how big, but there was a 

lot of us working on it when I was a little fellow." The place was evidently one of the plantations 

near Tallahassee; Thomas remembers that as soon as he was large enough he helped his 

parents and others raise "corn, peanuts, a little bit of cotton and potatoes. Squash just grew wild in 

the woods; we used to eat them when we couldn't get anything else much."  The centennarian 

remembers his parents clearly; his mother was one Nancy and his father's name was Adam. His 

father, he says, used to spend hours after the candles were out telling him and his brothers about 

his capture and subsequent slavery.  Adam was a native of the West Coast of Africa, and when 

quite a young man was attracted one day to a large ship that had just come near his home. With 

many others he was attracted aboard by bright red handkerchiefs, shawls and other articles in the 

hands of the seamen. Shortly afterwards he was securely bound in the hold of the ship, to be later 

sold somewhere in America. Thomas does not know exactly where Adam landed, but knows that 

his father had been in Florida many years before his birth. "I guess that's why I can't stand red 

things now," he says; "my pa hated the sight of And here, having set out with intentions most 

adverse to my theory, he "blesses it altogether." "Perhaps," he says, "of all the branches of a 

wealthy nobleman's expenditure, that which will be condemned with most unanimity, and 

defended with most difficulty, is the number of ostentatious and unnecessary servants it is 

customary to maintain. For this practice I have not a word to say. It is directly and indirectly bad. It 

is bad for all parties. Its reflex action on the masters themselves is noxious; it is mischievous to the 

flunkies who are maintained in idleness, and in enervating and demoralizing luxury; it is pernicious 

to the community at large, and especially to the middle and upper middle classes, whose 

inevitable expenditure in procuring fit domestic service--already burdensomely great--is thereby 

oppressively enhanced, till it has become difficult not only to find good household servants at 

moderate wages, but to find servants who will work diligently and faithfully for any wages at all." 

How will Mr. Greg keep up the palaces, parks, and studs, when he has taken away the retinues of 

servants? If he does not take care, he will find himself wielding the bosom of sumptuary reform in 

the most sweeping manner before he is aware of it. But let me respectfully ask him, who can he 

suppose objects to any expenditure except on the ground that it is directly and indirectly bad; bad 

for all parties, noxious to the voluptuary himself, noxious to all about him, and noxious to the 



community? So long as a man does no harm to himself or to anyone else, I for one see no 

objection to his supping like a Roman Emperor, on pheasants' tongues, or making shirt-studs of 

Koh-i-noors.  "It is charity," says Mr. Greg, hurling at the system of great establishments his last 

and bitterest anathema--"It is charity, and charity of the bastard sort--charity disguised as 

ostentation. It feeds, clothes, and houses a number of people in strenuous and pretentious 

laziness. If almshouses are noxious and offensive to the economic mind, then, by parity of 

reasoning, superfluous domestics are noxious also." And so it would seem, by parity of reasoning, 

or rather _a fortiori_, as being fed, clothed, and housed far more expensively, and in far more 

strenuous and pretentious laziness, are the superfluous masters of flunkeys. The flunkey does 

some work, at all events enough to prevent him from becoming a mere fattened animal. If he is 

required to grease and powder his head, he does work, as it seems to me, for which 


_
Thomas spent all of his enslaved years on the Campbell plantation, where he describes pre-

emancipation conditions as better than "he used to hear they was on the other places." Campbell 

himself is described as moderate, if not actually kindly. He did not permit his slaves to be beaten 

to any great extent. "The most he would give us was a 'switching', and most of the time we could 

pray out of that."  "But sometimes he would get a hard man working for him, though," the old man 

continues. "One of them used to 'buck and gag' us." This he describes as a punishment used 

particularly with runaways, where the slave would be gagged and tied in a squatting position and 

left in the sun for hours. He claims to have seen other slaves suspended by their thumbs for 

varying periods; he repeats, though, that these were not Campbell's practices.  During the years 

before  As I have said already, let Mr. Greg take in the moral, political, and social evils of luxury, 

as well as the material waste, and I flatter myself that there will be no real difference between his 

general view of the responsibilities of wealth and mine. He seems to be as convinced as I am that 

there is no happiness in living in strenuous and pretentious laziness by the sweat of other men's 

brows.  Nor do I believe that even the particular phrase which has been deemed so fraught with 

treason to plutocracy would, if my critic examined it closely, seem to him so very objectionable. His 

own doctrine, it is true, sounds severely economical. He holds that "the natural man and the 

Christian" who should be moved by his natural folly and Christianity to forego a bottle of 

champagne in order to relieve a neighbour in want of actual food, would do a thing "distinctly 


_
he says. Each year around New Years, itinerant "speculators" would come to his vicinity and either 

hold a public sale, or lead the slaves, tied together, to the plantation for inspection or sale.  "A 

whole lot of times they wouldn't sell 'em, they'd just trade 'em like they did horses. The man
