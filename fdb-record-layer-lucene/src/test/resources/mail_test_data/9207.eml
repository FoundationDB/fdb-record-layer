Dyers=E2=80=99 Materials. Trans. by have generally looked at the policy of =
the enactments, and have=20

construed them so as to preserve inviolably the confidence existing between=
 physician and=20

patient, without narrowing their effect to a strict interpretation of their=
 language.  In Indiana, under=20

a former law which protected matters _confided_, it was said that the statu=
te should be given a=20

broader scope than the word _confided_ in a strict sense imports, so as to =
cover matters learned=20

by observation and examination.[230] But, though the statute in terms absol=
utely prohibits a=20

disclosure, it has been said, in Indiana, that it gives no right to the phy=
sician to refuse to testify=20

where the patient waives the privilege,[231] and that it creates no absolut=
e incompetency,=20

because to hold otherwise would result in obstructing justice without subse=
rving the purpose of the=20

statute.[232] In Missouri, there is a dictum that the privilege should be c=
arefully limited to what the=20

statute requires, not so much because it is in derogation of the common law=
 as because it is in=20

exclusion of the best evidence, on the ground of privilege;[233] but in thi=
s very case, the real=20

question was whether the word _oral_ should be construed into the statute s=
o as to exclude from=20

its protection information acquired=20

subsequently the disposition to make a liberal construction was shown by th=
e highest court of the=20

State, although a general rule of interpretation was not announced.[235] In=
 New York, the rule that=20

a statute in derogation of the common law is strictly construed does not ap=
ply to the Code of Civil=20

Procedure.[236] But before the enactment of this statutory rule[237] there =
was a tendency to=20
