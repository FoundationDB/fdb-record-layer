dracaena marginata Thompson is not only an extraordinary dancer, but she is=

them were, until yesterday morning."  "That's not the way they tell it," Cr=

Carlo ceased speaking at last and in response Bianca gave a little sigh and=
 then murmured.  "I=20

wonder, Carlo, if you will ever learn to think or talk of any one except yo=
urself?"  Bianca's reply=20

was so unexpected that Carlo started and then stared at her, aggrieved and =
slightly irritated.  "But,=20

Bianca, I thought that we were such intimate friends that I could talk to y=
ou about myself, and=20

certainly of my musical ambitions. I am sorry my vanity has bored you."  Th=
e young girl shook her=20

head.  "All persons possessed of any genius are supposed to be vain, aren't=
 they, Carlo? I have=20

known no other than you. But as for our being intimate friends, why, I do n=
ot feel that we are=20

occasions to get rid of both of them."  "I am?" Melroy looked at Crandall c=
uriously, wondering if the=20

latter were serious, and deciding that he was. "You must believe _anything_=
 those people tell you.=20

Well, they lied to you if they told you that."  "Naturally that's what you'=
d say," Crandall replied. "But=20

how do you account for the fact that those two men, and only those two men,=
 were dismissed for=20

alleged deficient intelligence?"  "The tests aren't all made," Melroy repli=
ed. "Until they are, you=20

can't say that they are the only ones disqualified. And if you look over th=
e records of the tests,=20

you'll see where Koffler and Burris failed and the others passed. Here." He=
 laid the=20


_
longer. After all, Carlo, I cannot give all the affection and it seems to m=
e that is what you expect.=20

When we first knew each other and I wanted to help you because I understood=
 that you cared for=20

Sonya in a way which she could not return, and afterwards when you were wou=
nded and I tried to=20

find you in Chateau-Thierry, I did not think or care, besides Sonya was Son=
ya! But now things are=20

different."  For a few seconds Carlo studied the little cold, pure profile =
of the girl beside him. One=20

had a habit of forgetting that Bianca was approaching eighteen, and then su=
ddenly in some=20

unexpected fashion she reminded you that she was by no means a child.  "I s=
uppose you are=20

referring to my friendship with Miss Thompson since our arrival in Coblenz,=
 Bianca, or if not to our=20

friendship at least to the fact that we have been dancing together nearly e=
very afternoon when we=20

both have leave. Can't you understand, Bianca, that it is sometimes pretty =
dull for one here in=20

Coblenz summary and evaluation sheets on the desk. "Here's Koffler's, and h=
ere's Burris'; these=20

are the ones of the men who passed the test. Look them over if you want to.=
"  Crandall examined=20

the forms and summaries for the two men who had been discharged, and compar=
ed them with=20

several random samples from the satisfactory pile.  "Why, this stuff's a lo=
t of gibberish!" he=20

exclaimed indignantly. "This thing, here: ... five Limerick oysters, six pa=
irs of Don Alfonso=20

tweezers, seven hundred Macedonian warriors in full battle array, eight gol=
den crowns from the=20

ancient, secret crypts of Egypt, nine lymphatic, sympathetic, peripatetic o=
ld men on crutches, and=20

ten revolving heliotropes from the Ipsy-Wipsy Institute!' Great Lord, do yo=
u actually mean that=20

you're using this stuff as an excuse for depriving men of their jobs?"  "I =
warned you that you=20

should have brought a professional psychologist along," Melroy reminded him=
. "And maybe you=20

ought to get Koffler and Burris to=20

struggle for the allied victory is past? And now and then it seems to me I =
can scarcely endure=20

waiting to return to the United States and begin to work again on my music.=
 And yet one must=20

prove as good a soldier at one time as another. Yet what is the harm in my =
amusing myself? I=20

have thought They took the same tests, in the same manner, as any of the ot=
hers. They just didn't=20

have the mental equipment to cope with them and the others did. And for tha=
t reason, I won't run=20

the risk of having them working on this job."  "That's just your word again=
st theirs," Crandall=20

insisted=20
