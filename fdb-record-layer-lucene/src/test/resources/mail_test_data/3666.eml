deep valley is therefore the receptacle not only for the water that oozes f=
rom its sides, but=20

subterranean channels, bursting as land-springs from all parts of the walls=
 of the valley, wash=20

down the more soluble portions of earth, and continually waste away the soi=
l. Landslips occur daily=20

during the rainy season; streams and Shechem, and Esdraelon, have recovered=
; they are as=20

fertile and as fair as in old days; it is the hill-culture that has been de=
stroyed, and that is the culture=20

on which Jerusalem mainly depended. Its hills were terraced gardens, vineya=
rds, and groves of=20

olive-trees. And here it is that we find renovation. The terraces=20


_
beneath in a swollen torrent, the friable banks topple down into the stream=
 and dissolve. The=20

Atbara becomes the thickness of pea-soup, as its muddy waters steadily perf=
orm the duty they=20

have fulfilled from age to age. Thus was the great river at work upon our a=
rrival on its bank at the=20

bottom of the valley. The Arab name, "Bahr el Aswat" (black river) was well=
 bestowed; it was the=20

black mother of Egypt, still carrying to her offspring the nourishment that=
 had first formed the=20

Delta.  At this point of interest, the journey had commenced; the deserts w=
ere passed, all was=20

fertility and life: wherever the sources of the Nile might be, the Atbara h=
eights, and the eye is=20

frequently gladdened with young plantations. Fruit-trees, the peach and the=
 pomegranate, the=20

almond and the fig, offer gracious groups; and the true children of the lan=
d, the vine and the olive,=20

are again exulting in their native soil.  There is one spot, however, which=
 has been neglected, and=20

yet the one that should have been the first remembered, as it has been the =
most rudely wasted.=20

Blessed be the hand which plants trees upon Olivet! Blessed be the hand tha=
t builds gardens=20

about Sion!  The most remarkable creation, however, in modern Jerusalem is =
the Russian=20

settlement which within a few years has risen on the=20


_
my first impression, to be proved hereafter.   CHAPTER V.  THE STORM.  A VI=
OLENT=20

thunderstorm, with a deluge of rain, broke upon our camp upon the banks of =
the Atbara,=20

fortunately just after the tents were pitched. We thus had an example of th=
e extraordinary effects=20

of the heavy rain in tearing away the soil of the valley. Trifling watercou=
rses were swollen to=20

torrents; banks of earth became loosened and fell in, and the rush of mud a=
nd water upon all sides=20

swept forward into the river with a rapidity which threatened the destructi=
on of the country, could=20

such a tempest endure for a few days. In a couple of hours all was over. Th=
e river was narrower=20

than in its passage through the desert, but was ground on the western side =
of the city. The Latin,=20

the Greek, and the Armenian Churches had for centuries possessed enclosed e=
stablishments in=20

the city, which, under the name of monasteries, provided shelter and protec=
tion for hundreds=E2=80=94it=20

might be said even thousands=E2=80=94of pilgrims belonging to their respect=
ive rites. The great scale,=20

therefore, on which Russia secured hospitality for her subjects was not in =
reality so remarkable as=20

the fact that it seemed to indicate a settled determination to separate the=
 Muscovite Church=20

altogether from the Greek, and throw off what little dependence is still ac=
knowledged on the=20

Patriarchate of Constantinople. Whatever the motive, the design has been ac=
complished on a=20


_
opposite bank was Goorashee, with which a means of communication had been e=
stablished by a=20

ferry-boat belonging to our friend and late host, Malem Georgis, the Greek =
merchant of Cassala.=20

He had much trouble in obtaining permission from the authorities to introdu=
ce this novelty, which=20

was looked upon as an innovation, as such a convenience had never before ex=
isted. The=20

enterprising proprietor had likewise established a cotton farm at Goorashee=
, which appeared to=20

succeed admirably, and was an undeniable example of what could be produced =
in this fertile=20

country were the spirit of improvement awakened. Notwithstanding the advant=
age of the ferry-

boat, many of the Arabs preferred to swim their camels across the river to =
paying a trifle to the=20

ferryman. A camel either cannot or will not swim unless it is supported by =
inflated skins: thus the=20

passage of the broad river Atbara (at this spot about 300 yards wide) are a=
 caravanserai, a=20

cathedral, a citadel. The consular flag crowns the height and indicates the=
 office of administration;=20

priests and monks are permanent inhabitants, and a whole caravan of Muscovi=
te pilgrim and the=20

trades on which they depend can be accommodated within the precinct.  Mr. P=
hoebus, his family=20

and suite, were to be the guests of the Russian consul, and every preparati=
on was made to insure=20

the celebrated painter a becoming reception. Frequent telegrams had duly im=
pressed the=20

representative of all the Russias in the Holy Land with the importance of h=
is impending visitor.=20

Even the qualified and strictly provisional acceptance of the Russian propo=
sition by Mr. Phoebus=20

had agitated the wires of Europe scarcely less than a suggested conference.=

always remember what he owes to posterity and his profession,=E2=80=9D said=
 Mr. Phoebus to Lothair, as=20
