That is why I have kept her at my sister's house these three days."  "Bah! you grave but pleased look.  "So it seems.  But I say, Oke, I want to ask a favour of you.  Dan Davidson tells me you want me to go a-hunting with you.  Well, I'm your man if you'll let me take Little Bill with me.  Will you?"
