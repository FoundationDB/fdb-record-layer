 The plow was made of point iron with a wooden handle, not like plows of to=
day for they are of cast iron and steel.  Chickens, ducks and geese were ra=
ised in abundance and money rate of two in five minutes. Consider how that =
service is done by the myriads of men employed, and this in all seasons and=
 weathers in overwhelming heat, in numbing cold, in blinding storm, in midn=
ight darkness. Is not this an army pretty well disciplined, though its obje=
ct is not bloodshed? If we see masses full of practical energy and good sen=
se, but wanting in culture, let us take our culture to them, and perhaps th=

after freedom. They intimidated the Negroes and threatened them with loss o=
f life if they did not=20

stay and work for their former masters. Doctor Miller did not want any of h=
is slaves treated in such=20

manner. He told them they were free and could take whatever name they desir=
ed.  Robert Lee,=20

during slavery was Robert Miller, as were all of the doctor's slaves. After=
 slavery was ended he=20

chose the name Lee. His brother Aaron took the name Alexander not thinking =
how it looked for=20

two brothers of the same parents to have different surnames. There are sons=
 of each brother living=20

in Palatka now, one set Lees and the others, Alexander.  Randall, as was fo=
rmerly stated, spent a=20

very little time in slavery. Most of his knowledge concerning customs which=
 long ago have been=20

abandoned and replaced by more modern ones, is of early reconstruction days=
. Just after the Civil=20

War, when his father began farming on his own plantation, his mother remain=
ed home and cared=20

for her house and children. She was of fair complexion, having been the dau=
ghter of a half-breed=20

Indian and mind will be satisfied, if he has a mind to be satisfied and not=
 only a fancy to run away=20

with him. There was fraud beneath the cross of the Crusader, and there was =
forgery in the cell of=20

the Monk. In comparing the general quality of work we must remember that it=
 is the best work of=20

those times that has survived. I think I could prove from history that medi=
aeval floors sometimes=20

gave way even when there was no St. Dunstan there. You will recollect that =
the floor miraculously=20

fell in at a synod, and killed all St. Dunstan's opponents; but sceptics, w=
ho did not easily believe in=20

miracles, whispered that the Saint from his past habits, knew how to handle=
 tools. We are told by=20

those whose creed is embodied in "Past and Present" that this age is one va=
st anarchy, industrial=20

and social; and that nothing but military discipline--that is the perpetual=
 cry--will restore us to=20

anything like order as workers or as men. Well, there are twenty thousand m=
