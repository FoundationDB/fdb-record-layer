development of the intellect, but laying stress upon the quickening of man's conscience and the 

regeneration of his soul. In the States, however, where the prohibitory laws were not so rigidly 

enforced, the instruction received in various ways from workers of these denominations often 

turned out to be more than religion without letters.[2]  [Footnote 1: Matlack, _History of 

Methodism_, etc., p. 132; Benedict, _History of the Baptists_, p. 212.]  [Footnote 2: Adams, 

_South-side View_, p. 59.]  The Presbyterians found it more difficult to yield on this point. For 

decades they had been interested in the Negro race and had in 1818 reached the acme of 

antislavery sentiment.[1] Synod after synod denounced the attitude of cruel masters toward their 

slaves and took   Crush'd by the weight of a leaden-gray sky.    Is this the whole of it? is this the 

end?   Life finish'd off by a heartless Amen?   When will you write to me? when will you send? 

When shall I follow you, Harry?--Ah when?    I wander'd far from my hateful abode;   The hour was 

becoming a little late;   Just there a gate open'd into a road,   And a boy was leaning upon the 

gate.    Faithful old Rover, who follow'd me out,   Went perfectly frantic beholding this boy,   Sniff'd 

at his coat, leaping wildly about,   And danced like a dog that dances for joy.    He was a stripling 

both slender and tall   (My idle eyes vacantly take the view),   His coat was too large, or he was 

too small,   His nose was a snub, and his eyes were blue.   Angry I felt to see

public sentiment and reactionary legislation made the instruction of the Negroes of the South 

impracticable the Presbyterians of New York and New Jersey were active in devising schemes for 

the education of the colored people at points in the North.[3] Then came the crisis of the prolonged 

abolition agitation which kept the Presbyterian Church in an excited state from 1818   But he 

suddenly stopp'd, began to quake,   And howl'd in a most deplorable voice,   As if his dog-heart 

was ready to break.    Then the boy, stooping down, _something_ slipp'd in   (The something was 

little and square and white)   Between the steel collar and hairy skin,   Saw that I saw it, and so 

took to flight.    Wagging his tail, a hurrah in each beat,   Expanding his chest with a gesture grand,
