philodendron monstera love and the season of happiness. Dinkie and Poppsy and I are going out to gather prairie-crocuses. They are thick now in the prairie-sod, soft blue and lavender and sometimes mauve. We must dance to the vernal saraband while we can: Spring is so short in this norland country of ours. It comes philodendron monstera love and the season of happiness. Dinkie and Poppsy and I are going out to gather prairie-crocuses. They are thick now in the prairie-sod, soft blue and lavender and sometimes mauve. We must dance to the vernal saraband while we can: Spring is so short in this norland country of ours. It comes _
suspiciously like a gypsy-queen who'd been politely requested by the local constabulary to move 

on.  It wasn't until we reached the open country that my spirits revived. Then the prairie seemed to 

reach out its hand to me and give me peace. We camped, that first night, in the sheltering arm of a 

little coulee threaded by a tiny stream. We cooked bacon and eggs and coffee while Whinnie out-

spanned his team and put up his tent.  I sat on an oat-sack, after supper, with Poppsy between my 

knees, watching the evening stars come out. They were worlds, I remembered, some of them 

worlds perhaps with sorrowing men and women on them. And they seemed very lonely and far-

away worlds, until I heard the drowsy voice of my Poppsy say up through the dusk: "In two days 

more, Mummy, we'll be back to Dinkie, won't we?"  And there was much, I remembered, for which 

a mother should be thankful.     _Sunday the Fourteenth_   _Dark, and true, and tender is the 

North._ Heaven bless the rhymster who first penned those words. Spring is stealing also a good 

way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes our cataloguers produce obviously 

take a while after an announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

(one page)  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The time it takes us, a 

rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, 

copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our projected audience is one 

hundred million readers.  If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 

$2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text files per month:  1240 more 

eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+ We are

and our world is a world of beauty. The sky to-day is windrowed with flat-bottomed cumulus-

clouds, tier beyond tier above a level plane of light, marking off the infinite distance like receding 

mile-stones on a world turned over on its back. Occasionally If they reach just 1-2% of the world's 

population then the total will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.  The Goal 

of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks! This is ten thousand titles each to one 

hundred million

a wild duck, pumping north with a black throb of wings, melts away to a speck in the opaline air. 

Back among the muskeg reeds the waders are courting and chattering, and early this morning I 

heard the plaintive winnowing call-note of the Wilson snipe, and later the _punk-e-lunk_ love-cry of 

a bittern to his mate. There's an eagle planing in lazy circles high in the air, even now, putting a 

soft-pedal on the noise of the coots and grebes as he circles over their rush-lined cabarets. And 

somewhere out on the range a bull is lowing. It is the which is only about 4% of the present 

number of computer users.  Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
