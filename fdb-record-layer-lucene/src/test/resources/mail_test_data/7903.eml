ps, as Mr. Stevens had=20

suggested, these two had escaped down the alley when the young Chinese whom=
 they had=20

encountered in the upper room gave his cry of warning. The only significant=
 incident had been=20

when the four Chinese had shown excitement on viewing the mark on Teeny-bit=
s' back.  "Of=20

course, we could swear out a warrant and have the police investigate this w=
hole matter," said Mr.=20

Stevens, "but I am afraid that that would get us nowhere, for as you say, i=
t would be pretty difficult=20

for you to identify those men and we couldn't even prove that it was at Chu=
an Kai's place that you=20

were held prisoner. I guess the next thing for us to do is to wait for some=
 word to come from=20

Tracey Campbell."  But no word of explanation came. For a few days Tracey C=
ampbell lay in a=20

semiconscious condition; he then grew rapidly better and at the end of the =
week was removed to=20

the Campbell home.  The leather dealer, who had been away on a business tri=
p at the time of the=20

Ridgley-Jefferson game, had, of course, been summoned back to Greensboro by=
 telegram. Twice=20

he came to Ridgley School for a conference with Doctor Wells. His attitude =
on the occasion of his=20

first visit was one of indignation and arrogance. He indicated to the Head =
that Ridgley School was=20

responsible for the whole tragic incident and that explanations were in ord=
er. When he learned that=20

his son was under accusation and that there was evidence to give weight to =
the case, his attitude=20

underwent somewhat of a change. He was still in a warlike mood, however, an=
d left Doctor Wells=20

with the promise of getting at the root of the whole matter and exonerating=
 his son. On the=20

occasion of his second visit, however, his attitude was quite different. He=
 now wished to hush up=20

the whole affair and treat the thing as an unfortunate incident which could=
 not be too quickly=20

forgotten. Tracey Campbell would not return to Ridgley School. As soon as h=
e recovered=20

sufficiently to travel his father intended to send him to Florida. From cer=
tain remarks that the=20

leather dealer made, it was evident to Doctor Wells that Tracey had confess=
ed his part in the theft=20

of the trinkets and money. In regard to the charge of being implicated in t=
he kidnapping of Teeny-

bits, Mr. Campbell declared that nothing had been proved against his son an=
d in his opinion it was=20

doubtless "all a story made up by that young Teeny-bits fellow in order to =
curry favor and win=20

popularity."  And so the matter was left as far as the Campbells were conce=
rned, though it was=20

said that Mrs. Campbell called Doctor Wells on the telephone and in her shr=
ill voice denied=20

vigorously that her son had acted in any manner unbecoming to "the son of a=
 gentleman" and that=20

for her part she thought that the school was a poor one and that she wished=
 they wouldn't have=20

such games as football "which work the boys up to excitement and get them i=
nto a dangerous=20

state of mind." No one took the pains to ascertain whether Tracey Campbell =
was actually expelled=20

from the school or had merely been withdrawn. At any rate Ridgley School wo=
uld see him no more=20

and as the days went on, it seemed less and less worth while to investigate=
 the circumstances=20

which preceded the Jefferson game by calling upon Tracey Campbell to confes=
s further details.=20

The visit of Bassett Senior to the school--Blow-Hard Bassett as he was know=
n in certain sections=20

of the West--was sadder and more pathetic. He was a big man who dressed gau=
dily; even the=20

tragedy had not served to remove wholly from his appearance the garish qual=
ity that proclaimed=20

his type. To Mr. Stevens and Doctor Wells his visit was a startling exempli=
fication of that old=20

saying: "Like father, like son." When they talked to him it was as if they =
were talking to Whirlwind=20

Bassett grown into a man of fifty. His visit was an unpleasant incident,--h=
e showed so plainly that=20

he had made a failure of his duties as a father and he groped so helplessly=
 in his grief for the=20



reason why his boy, whose body he would carry back to the West, had by his =
own acts brought an=20

unhappy termination to his career.  "I never understood him," he said to Do=
ctor Wells, "and I=20

suppose I haven't been just the right kind of father for him. He didn't hav=
e any mother after he was=20

four years old, and even when he was a little feller I never seemed to have=
 much luck in making=20

him mind me. He was always doing something to cause a commotion of some sor=
t, like running=20

away or getting into mix-ups--nothing very bad, you know, just such things =
as young fellers are apt=20

to do. Sometimes I talked to him but it never made much impression."  As Bl=
ow-Hard Bassett=20

looked out of Doctor Wells' shaded windows there was a hint of moisture in =
his eyes. "He was a=20

determined little feller," he remarked after a moment, "and when he'd get a=
 notion in his head it=20

seemed like nothing would shake it out. I remember one time when a mongrel =
dog that they had=20

out on a ranch where we were staying bit him on the wrist and the little ch=
ap--I guess he was only=20

eight years old--came bawling to me and says, 'He bit me, Pa; you've got to=
 kill him!'  "I said, 'Don't=20

you see, it was your fault; the dog wouldn't of bit you if you hadn't been =
teasin' him,' but he kept on=20

begging me to kill the mongrel and when I wouldn't do it, he decided to tak=
e matters into his own=20

hands--and what do you suppose he done? He got a six-shooter out of a holst=
er that one of the=20

cowboys had left lyin' around an' come up behind that dog while he was sunn=
in' himself beside the=20

ranch house and blowed out his brains! You see, he just made up his mind to=
 settle with that dog,=20

and nothing that any of us could say made a bit of difference. I the spot w=
here the disruption=20

appears, and saw the water in considerable agitation, with much bubbling, a=
nd at short intervals it=20

was thrown up in several places to the height of 3 or 4 feet. They saw no r=
upture in the earth,=20

although they came within two or three rods of the spot, and state the wate=
r to have been two feet=20

deep. About one o'clock on the morning of March 4th, Mr. Seth Sheldon and f=
amily, living one mile=20

south from this spot, and being awake, were alarmed by a loud report from t=
he north, by which=20

their house and furniture were much shaken. They compared the sound, though=
 louder by far than=20

they had ever heard from this cause, to that of a cracking in the earth by =
frost in severe weather.=20

Some others living rather nearer the spot, were awakened by the same report=
. That the rupture in=20

the earth was made at that time is probable, though not certain.  It may be=
 proper to state, that=20

during the flood, no ice, except a few loose masses, was carried over, or n=
ear the spot where the=20

disruption appears. This, therefore, could not have produced it.  [Illustra=
tion: Disruption of the=20

ection, taken with a=20

are all the facts I am able at present to collect concerning this phenomeno=
n. I have been particular=20

as to the temperature of the air, and the situation of the adjacent country=
, from an idea that frost=20

was a principal agent in producing it; and that, therefore, these circumsta=
nces would be important=20

in fixing a theory. I will not, however, hazard any hypothesis on the subje=
ct; but if you deem the=20

fact of sufficient importance, your opinion, Sir, is respectfully solicited=

EDWARD HITCHCOCK.    _Deerfield, Mass. March 26th, 1818._         *       *=

_Deerfield, June 3d, 1818._    SIR,  Since I sent you a description of a si=
ngular disruption in the=20

earth in this town, another has been observed in the same meadows, about on=
e mile from the=20

former. This is less than the one of which I sent you an account, but its s=
ituation is almost exactly=20

similar; it being on a small elevation, on the sides of which, at a few rod=
s distant, is low wet=20

ground. Indeed, the _general_ description which I sent you will answer for =
this smaller disruption.=20

The diameters of this last, are only 7 and 8 paces, and the curve is not pe=
rfect. There appears to=20

have been an expansion of the earth's surface around both these spots, or d=
isruptions, by which it=20

was forced to give way at the point where there was the least resistance, w=
hich, of course, would=20

be on the highest ground. The more I observe of this phenomenon, the more I=
 am inclined to=20

impute it to the agency of frost.  It may be proper to observe, that in nei=
ther of these disruptions=20

has the general mass of the hills sunk in the least. Had this been the case=
, it might perhaps have=20

accounted for them. It is also certain, that the soil below where it was fr=
ozen the past winter, has=20

not been moved. I mentioned this fact in my first communication, though wit=
h some suggested=20

doubt.   REMARKS.  An opinion having been requested by Mr. Hitchcock on the=
 above facts, it=20

may be observed, that there appears in the statement sufficient evidence th=
at the phenomenon=20

(as the author has suggested) is attributable to frost.  It is a fact, esta=
blished equally by common=20

experience and by numerous experiments, that water, in freezing, expands. I=
t is generally=20

estimated that 8 cubic inches of water, become 9 by the act of congealing. =
The expansion is=20

attributed, with sufficient evidence, to a crystalline arrangement arising =
from a kind of polarity in=20

the particles of water exerted when they are near congealing, by which they=
 attract one another in=20

certain points, and not in others. Dr. Black, with his usual felicity, has =
illustrated this tendency, by=20

supposing a great number of small magnetized needles, thrust through corks,=
 so that they will float=20

parallel to the surface of water, to be thrown promiscuously into a vessel =
of that fluid. They will not=20

remain in the situation in which they are thrown in, but, in consequence of=
 their polarity, attractions=20

and repulsions will be immediately exerted; they will rush together, with a=
 force equal to the=20

overcoming of a certain resistance; they will arrange themselves in pairs a=
nd groups, and finally, in=20

a connected assemblage.  The particles of water attract each other with a p=
rodigious force, when=20

resistance is opposed; for it is well known that domestic utensils, trees, =
rocks, and even cannon,=20

and bomb-shells, are burst with explosion, when water confined within them =
is frozen.  There is=20

force enough then exerted by the expansion of freezing water, to produce al=
l the mechanical=20

violence, whose effects were so striking in the instance at Deerfield.  In =
the common cracking of=20

the ground by frost, so extensively observed in cold climates, the effect a=
ppears to result in the=20

following manner. The water contained in the ground, (that is, in that part=
 which is within the reach=20

of a freezing temperature) by congealing, expands and demands more space; a=
 movement must=20


_
close to him, so to speak. It was just as if he belonged to some other man,=
 and now, of course, I=20

can't help wishing that I had somehow got to understand him better."  There=
 was not much that=20

Doctor Wells could say after that except to extend his sympathy and to expr=
ess the wish that=20

resistance; this will evidently be upward, because the atmosphere, the only=
 counteracting power in=20

this direction, cannot resist the expansion of the freezing water as much a=
s it is resisted by the=20

earth below the freezing stratum. Consequently, the freezing earth is force=
d upward,=20


_
for others as well as the father to understand and help the youth who had c=
ome to his untimely=20

end.  November, with each day crisper than the last, slipped into December =
and one morning the=20

school awoke to find a thin sifting of snow over the brown grass of the cam=
pus and the bare=20

branches of the maple trees. The Christmas vacation suddenly became the sub=
ject of=20

conversation, and to Teeny-bits it seemed that every one had a plan that pr=
omised pleasure and=20

recreation. He felt a little lonely at the thought of seeing all these frie=
nds of his depart for the=20

holidays and leave him to spend the vacation alone in the quiet little vill=
age of Hamilton; and then=20

one evening after the last mail, Neil Durant came into his room with two op=
ened letters in his hand.=20

"A couple of invitations," he said. "It's all fixed up, Teeny-bits. You're =
going home for Christmas=20

with me and we're going up to places, it cracks at the weakest spot; and th=
e earth, for some=20

distance on the sides of the fissure, is thrown into the position of two pl=
anes gently inclined, their=20

relative position resembling that of a very flat roof, and the more they ar=
e lifted by frost, the more=20

they will decline from one another, and the wider will be the fissure.  But=
 why, in the instance=20

which Mr. Hitchcock has related, did they overlap? The explanation appears =
to result from the=20

circumstances of the case, as far as they can be understood without ocular =
inspection of the=20

ground.  The elevated spot which cracked in so remarkable a manner, being n=
early surrounded by=20

a _belt_ of low wet ground, the congelation of the water in this ground by =
the intense cold, would=20

of course produce a very great expansive effort towards the elevated ground=
. This, not only on=20

account of its elevation, but from its containing less=20
