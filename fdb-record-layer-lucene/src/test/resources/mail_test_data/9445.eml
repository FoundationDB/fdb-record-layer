then he dodged behind the wagon to get out of Jack's reach.  Two days later=
 they were at Pryor's=20

Gap, and Mr. Pierce was glad to see them. He insisted that they stay severa=
l days at his house, to=20

which Jack agreed. But his host did not see much of our hero, for, somehow,=
 there were many=20

sights of interest about the Gap, and no one seemed able to point them out =
to Jack, save a certain=20

brown-eyed maiden--but there, what's the use of rubbing it in?  "Well, I ho=
pe you lads will come=20

camping out here again, soon," said Mr. Pierce, as the members of the gun c=
lub prepared to take=20

their leave.  "I hope we can," said Jack. "We have enjoyed the hospitality =
of you and your daughter=20

very much."  "Especially the daughter," put in Nat, in a voice intended onl=
y for Jack's ear. "You old=20

duffer, you monopolized her."  "Humph!" exclaimed Jack. "Who had a better r=
ight?"  "Good-by,=20

boys!" called Mr. Pierce.  "Good-by," chorused the members of Jack Ranger's=
 gun club.  "Good-

by," spoke Mabel, with a blush, but she only looked at Jack. "Come again." =
 "We will," said our=20

hero decidedly, as he held her hand at parting a little longer than perhaps=
 was strictly necessary.=20

But, as we asked before, what's the use of rubbing it in?  "We certainly ha=
d a great time,"=20

observed Will, as they started off from Pryor's Gap.  "The best ever," agre=
ed the others.  "I wonder=20

what we'll do next year," spoke Sam.  But what they did will be told in the=
 next volume of this=20

series, to be entitled "Jack Ranger's Treasure Box; or, The Outing of the S=
choolboy Yachtsmen."=20

In that story we shall meet all our old friends again and learn the particu=
lars of a most unusual=20

mystery, and how it was solved.  A few days later the boys were in a train =
that was swiftly taking=20

them back East, and to Washington Hall, which institution, as Jack learned =
in a letter from his=20

curious indeed as to what I might be going to hear. My heart wasn't beating=
 so thickly now. I could=20

think almost calmly again.  "I thank you for your trust in me," said Ivor. =
 "A little diplomatic errand,"=20

repeated the Foreign Secretary. "In itself the thing is not much: that is, =
on the face of it. And yet, in=20

its relation with other interests, it becomes a mission of vast importance,=
 incalculable importance.=20

When I have explained, you will see why I apply to you. Indeed, I came to m=
y cousin Mountstuart's=20

house expressly because I was told you would be at his wife's ball. My regr=
et is, that the news=20

which brought me in search of you didn't reach me earlier, for if it had I =
should have come with my=20

wife, and have got at you in time to send you off--if you agreed to go--to-=
night. As it is, the matter=20

will have to rest till to-morrow morning. It's too late for you to catch th=
e midnight boat across the=20

Channel."  "Across the Channel?" echoed Ivor. "You want me to go to France?=
"  "Yes."  "One=20

could always get across somehow," said Ivor, thoughtfully, "if there were a=
 great hurry."  "There is-

-the greatest. But in this case, the more haste, the less speed. That is, i=
f you were to rush off,=20

order a special train, and charter a tug or motor boat at Dover, as I suppo=
se you mean, my object=20

would probably be defeated. I came to you because those who are watching th=
is business=20

wouldn't be likely to guess I had given you a hand in it. All that you do, =
however, must be done=20

quietly, with no fuss, no sign of anything unusual going on. It was natural=
 I should come to a ball=20

given by my wife's sister, whose husband is my cousin. No one knows of this=
 interview of ours: I=20

believe I may make my mind easy on that score, at least. And it is equally =
natural that you should=20

start on business or pleasure of your own, for Paris to-morrow=20

repaired, and was ready for the students.  "Oh, dear, to think of going bac=
k to studies again,"=20

sighed Nat, as he thought of the fun they had had.  "Never mind, we'll have=
 some sport yet,"=20

consoled Jack. "Professors Socrat and Garlach are still available."  "Yes, =
and think of the=20

experience we have had," said Will.  "Oh, well, we always have some sort of=
 queer experience=20

when we go out with Jack Ranger," added Nat. "All out for Pryor's Gap," he =
shouted, as the train=20

pulled into a station. Then he ducked down behind a seat to escape a wad of=
 paper that Jack=20

threw at him.  THE END     THE COLLEGE SPORTS SERIES  By LESTER CHADWICK  _=

 _Mr. Chadwick has=20

" exclaimed Ivor,=20

off his guard for an instant, and showing plainly that he was taken aback. =
 "Isn't she a friend of=20

yours?" asked the Foreign Secretary rather sharply. Though I couldn't see h=
im, I knew exactly how=20

he would be looking at Ivor, his keen grey eyes narrowed, his clean-shaven =
lips drawn in, the long,=20

well-shaped hand, of which he is said to be vain, toying with the pale Malm=
aison pink he always=20

wears in his buttonhole.  "Yes, she is a friend of mine," Ivor answered. "B=
ut--"  "A 'but' already!=20

Perhaps I'd better tell you that the mission has to do with Mademoiselle de=
 Renzie, and, directly,=20

with no one else. She has acted as my agent in Paris."  "Indeed! I didn't d=
ream that=20
