Besides, many of the small island crafts burn kerosene in their motors. We'=
ll have a drum up from=20

below at once."  "One thing I want to know," said the Commander, "and that'=
s the range of this=20

ship. I've heard they're hard on fuel. We'll have the boys rig up a belly t=
ank on your jet plane. Then=20

you and I will give the ship a good tryout together."  "That's okay with me=
, sir," said Jack.  "It's not=20

just for fun, or to try out a new toy. I want to warn you," said the Comman=
der, "that if this jet plane=20

has enough range she'll be the first scout sent out over Mindanao. It's goi=
ng to be very important=20

that we have accurate information regarding ships in the harbor. With this =
plane you should be=20

able to get that information and come back alive."  "It will be a great hon=
or, sir!" Jack replied=20

soberly.  When the belly tank had been rigged and the jet plane fueled, the=
y took off.  "If I were=20

sure of the oxygen equipment, sir," said Jack as he set the jet plane climb=
ing, "I'd take you to the=20

stratosphere. There we'd really have distance aplenty."  "That can wait," w=
as the answer. "Climb to=20

five thousand, level off, then follow the course the task force has just co=
vered. Our fighters are=20

maintaining a night watch for snoopers, but if our fuel holds out we'll cov=
er a much greater=20

distance than they."  Jack followed instructions, then, having set the ship=
 at an economical speed,=20

settled back to think of many things--of the island they had left, of the t=
hree Japs, and of the=20

German who had gone over the cliff. He could easily imagine what had happen=
ed to them.=20

However, to guess how they had come into possession of this American-made j=
et plane was not=20

so easy.  He thought of Mary Brown and Ted. Mary was a good-looking girl--w=
ith her island brown=20

off and a touch of an American lady's war paint on. He thought Ted had rath=
er fallen for her. Had=20

he done the same? There was Patsy. There was always Patsy back home.  "How'=
s your fuel,=20

Jack?" the Commander asked.  "I'll have a look, sir." Jack studied his gaug=
e. "Not bad," he=20

reported. "Under present conditions we should do eight hundred miles."  "Th=
at's all anyone can=20

hope for. How do you account for this ship's efficiency?" the Commander ask=
ed.  "Well, you see,=20

sir, it's my understanding that a new alloy has been developed that will wi=
thstand a very high=20

temperature. Then the jets are deflected by setting them at right angles to=
 the air stream. Of=20

course," he demurred, "I only learned a little--I read it in a scrapbook. A=
ll I really know is that this=20

plane's got speed and can carry enough fuel to take you places and permit y=
ou to do things," Jack=20

laughed happily. "That's all I ask of any plane."  "It's all anyone can ask=
," said the Commander.=20

"But let me tell you one thing, son, if a cannon ball or even a slug from a=
 machine gun ever=20

penetrates the wall neuritis and neuro-retinitis are sometimes found; and w=
e have sometimes optic=20

atrophy. Structural changes in the choroid may also be caused by lightning.=
 Rupture of the=20

choroid, hemorrhage from the choroid and retina, and partial detachment of =
the retina may occur=20

from the shock without the patient being struck by the lightning and withou=
t rupture of the external=20

tissues.  _Ears._=E2=80=94Perforation of the tympanum is reported in more t=
han one case.   AUTOPSIES.=20

We shall consider here the pathological conditions found in deaths from ele=
ctricity, whether due to=20

artificial or to atmospheric sources. The results are or may be the same in=
 either, so far as we now=20

know, and it is probable that the action of the electricity is practically =
the same in either case, only=20

varying as regards the strength and tension of the current.  =3DRigor Morti=
s.=3D=E2=80=94This has generally=20

been found in cases of death from artificial electricity. In the case of Ju=
gigo, who was executed by=20

electricity, it was present four and one-half hours after death. As regards=
 its occurrence in death=20

by lightning and the rapidity of its onset, there has been much discussion.=
 It is certainly present in=20

many cases, and the probability is there is nothing diagnostic in regard to=
 it in deaths by lightning.=20



When absent, its absence is probably due to the presence of some external f=
actor and has no=20

relation to the form of death. We have, on the other hand, no proof that th=
e rapidity of its onset is=20

increased.  =3DCoagulation of the Blood.=3D=E2=80=94It has been observed fr=
equently that the blood of=20

persons struck by lightning does not coagulate readily. Sullivan states tha=
t in certain cases of=20

complete disorganization after lightning shock the blood is left fluid and =
incoagulable and its color=20

changed to a deep black. In one of the cases of death from artificial elect=
ricity reported by Grange,=20

the heart was found sixty-two hours after death to be filled with liquid bl=
ood of a rosy vermilion=20

color, which quickly became darker on contact with the air. A spectroscopic=
 examination of the=20

blood showed the normal lines of oxidized blood reducible by sulphydrate of=
 ammonium. In a case=20

reported by Matzinger the blood as submitted was black and perfectly fluid,=
 the corpuscles, both=20

red and white, were normal, and no fibrin was detected. In those executed b=
y electricity the blood=20

seems to have been fluid and not in any way remarkable.  There seems to be =
no evidence that the=20

bodies of those dying from electricity in any form suffer unusually rapid d=
ecomposition.  The only=20

absolute sign of death from electricity is decomposition of the tissues, bu=
t the usual signs are to be=20

relied upon to the same extent as in ordinary cases of death.  =3DInternal =
Organs.=3D=E2=80=94In the cases of=20

death from mechanical electricity no changes in the internal organs other t=
han those due to=20

that heat she'll burn like a match!"  "It's protected partially, at least, =
with steel plate, sir," Jack=20

replied soberly. "But why let the enemy get a crack at you when you've got =
a ship like this?"  "Why,=20

indeed?" agreed the Commander. "All you have to do is turn on the oxygen an=
d climb for the stars.=20

You--"  The Commander broke off to listen intently. "Jack!" he said. "Shut =
off that squeal and drift=20

down a bit."  Jack silenced his engine. Then he heard it. The thunder of a =
powerful plane.  "A=20

snooper!" he exclaimed.  "He's up ahead some distance." The Commander liste=
ned again.=20

"Coming this way. That's my judgment."  "He's a good two hundred and fifty =
miles from our task=20

force, sir," Jack suggested.  "Too close. Start your motor."  Jack obeyed. =
"And now, sir?"  "Pick up=20

speed. We're going after that big Jap plane."  "But, sir! You are a key fig=
ure! A hundred planes,=20

hundreds of men operate at your direction! There's time enough to get back =
and send out a=20

patrol!"  "We're taking no chances!" the traumata have been found, except a=
 considerable degree=20

of congestion and sometimes minute hemorrhages in the heart substance benea=
th the=20

pericardium and into the pulmonary air-vesicles and pleura. In one of Grang=
e=E2=80=99s cases the heart=20

was filled with liquid blood; in the other it was completely empty, the rig=
ht ventricle collapsed, the=20

walls of the left ventricle hard and contracted.  Careful autopsies were ma=
de in the cases of the=20

criminals executed by electricity, but no important changes caused by the e=
lectric current have=20

been detected either macroscopically or microscopically. A few petechial sp=
ots (Tardieu=E2=80=99s spots)=20

are apt to be found underneath the pericardium in the heart tissue and some=
times beneath the=20

pleura. The organs were not extremely congested. In the case of Jugigo the =
vessels of the spinal=20

cord and its membranes contained if anything less blood than usual. In this=
 case the amount of=20

blood found in the brain seems to have been about normal, the vessels of th=
e dura were=20

moderately dilated=20


_
important. If I were unwilling to risk going with you in a flight of this n=
ature, I should not be worthy=20

of commanding a bomber, let alone all the planes of a carrier."  "How's thi=
s gun I have here?" he=20

asked in a casual tone.  "It's first-class, sir. The same type of gun we us=
e in our own planes, and in=20

top condition."  "And your gun?" asked the Commander.  "There are two fifty=
-millimeter guns in=20

fixed position. Having no propeller simplifies things, sir. I've never foug=
ht in this plane, sir, but I=20

think we shall take them."  "Even if we can't shoot the beggars down," the =
Commander laughed,=20

"the wail of this plane should frighten them to death."  After that they ho=
wled on through the night.=20

Twice Jack silenced his motor. Each time the rumble was louder.  "We're on =
the right track," was=20

the Commander's comment.  The third time, Jack said, "Very close, sir."  "A=
bove or beneath us?"=20

"Beneath, I believe, sir," Jack answered.  "Good! We'll run right above the=
m. Then we'll swing=20

about and down, so we can get them in the light of the moon."  Jack was fol=
lowing instructions and=20

was, he thought, just about over the snooper, when a strange thing happened=
. A dim light shot=20

squarely across his path.  "Did you see that, sir?" he exclaimed.  "See cas=
e of Kemmler the=20

portion of the intracranial contents underneath the head-electrode was some=
what affected directly=20

by the heat, the meningeal vessels in the dura were carbonized, and the bra=
in cortex was sensibly=20

hardened to one-sixth of its depth, =E2=80=9Cwhere there was a broken line =
of vascularity.=E2=80=9D The post-

mortem temperature in this case seems to have remained unusually high, bein=
g 97=C2=B0 F. in the=20

fourth ventricle and 99=C2=B0 F. at the back of the neck three hours after =
death in a room where the=20

temperature was only 83=C2=B0.  In autopsies after death by lightning the r=
esults are in general=20

analogous. The brain and its membranes may be an=C3=A6mic or congested. Eff=
usions of blood may=20

be found beneath the dura or in the brain substance itself, due to the lace=
ration or injury of=20

vessels. Rupture of the brain is said to have occurred, and Phayre reports =
a case in which the left=20

hemisphere was entirely destroyed and changed into a dark gray homogeneous =
fluid mass, only a=20

small portion of the corpus callosum remaining. No extravasation of blood, =
laceration of the=20

vessels or membranes, or injury of the bones was detected.  Ecchymotic spot=
s are frequently=20

found beneath the serous membranes, pericardium, pleura, and peritoneum.  S=
chmitz states that=20
