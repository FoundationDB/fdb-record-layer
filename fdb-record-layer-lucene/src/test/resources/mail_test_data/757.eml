dracaena marginata bathers get anointed merely by the water. Likewise there=
 is a lake in Ethiopia which anoints people who swim in it, and one in Indi=
a which emits a great quantity of oil when the sky is clear. At Carthage is=
 a spring that has oil swimming on its surface and smelling like sawdust fr=
om citrus wood, with which oil sheep are anointed. In Zacynthus and about D=
yrrachium and Apollonia are springs which discharge a great quantity of pit=
ch with their water. In Babylon, a lake of very great and barbarian, and th=
at now I am indifferent and take no heed of the dawn. When a man has not in=
 him what is loftier and mightier than all external impressions a bad cold =
is really enough to upset his equilibrium and make him begin to see an owl =
in every bird, to hear a dog howling in every sound. And all his pessimism =
or optimism with his thoughts great and small have at such times significan=
ce as symptoms and nothing more.  I am vanquished. If it is so, it is usele=
ss to think, it is dracaena marginata bathers get anointed merely by the wa=
ter. Likewise there is a lake in Ethiopia which anoints people who swim in =
it, and one in India which emits a great quantity of oil when the sky is cl=
ear. At Carthage is a spring that has oil swimming on its surface and smell=
ing like sawdust from citrus wood, with which oil sheep are anointed. In Za=

 is so, it is useless to think, it is _
settles down again to its proper level. So it is with the sources of spring=
s. As long as they are=20

confined in narrow channels, the currents of air in the water rush up in bu=
bbles to the top, but as=20

soon as they are given a wider outlet, they lose their air on account of th=
e rarity peculiar to water,=20

and so settle down and resume their proper level.  4. Every hot spring has =
healing properties=20

because it has been boiled with foreign substances, and thus acquires a new=
 useful quality. For=20

example, sulphur springs cure pains in the sinews, by warming up and burnin=
g out the corrupt=20

humours of the body by their heat. Aluminous springs, used in the treatment=
 of the limbs when=20

enfeebled by paralysis or the stroke of any such malady, introduce warmth t=
hrough the open=20

pores, counter-acting the chill by the opposite effect of their heat, and t=
hus equably restoring the=20

limbs to their former condition. Asphaltic springs, taken as purges, cure i=
nternal maladies.  5.=20

There is also a kind of cold water containing natron, found for instance at=
 Penne in the Vestine=20

country, at Cutiliae, and at other similar places. It is taken as a purge a=
nd in passing through the=20

bowels reduces scrofulous tumours. Copious springs are found where there ar=
e mines of gold,=20

silver, iron, copper, lead, and the like, but they are very harmful. For th=
ey contain, like hot springs,=20

sulphur, alum, asphalt,... and when it passes into the body in the form of =
drink, and spreading=20

through the veins reaches the sinews and joints, it expands and hardens the=
m. Hence the sinews,=20

swelling with this expansion, are contracted in length and so give men the =
cramp or the gout, for=20

the reason that their veins are saturated with very hard, dense, and cold s=
ubstances.  6. There is=20

also a sort of water which, since it contains... that are not perfectly cle=
ar, and it floats like a flower=20

on the surface, in colour like purple glass. This may be seen particularly =
in Athens, where there=20

are aqueducts from places and springs of that sort leading to the city and =
the port of Piraeus, from=20

which nobody dying in a strange bed, in misery, in utter loneliness. Of cou=
rse, no one is to blame=20

for that; but I in my foolishness dislike my popularity. I feel as though i=
t had cheated me.  At ten=20

o'clock I fall asleep, and in spite of the tic I sleep soundly, and should =
have gone on sleeping if I=20

had not been awakened. Soon after one came a sudden knock at the door.  "Wh=
o is there?"  "A=20

telegram."  "You might have waited till tomorrow," I say angrily, taking th=
e telegram from the=20

attendant. "Now I shall not get to sleep again."  "I am sorry. Your light w=
as burning, so I thought=20

you were not asleep."  I tear open the telegram and look first at the signa=
ture. From my wife.=20

"What does she want?"  "Gnekker was secretly married to Liza yesterday. Ret=
urn."  I read the=20

telegram, and my dismay does not last long. I am dismayed, not by what Liza=
 and Gnekker have=20

done, but by the indifference with which I hear of their marriage. They say=
 philosophers and the=20

truly wise are indifferent. It is false: indifference is the paralysis of t=
he soul; it is premature death.  I=20

go to bed again, and begin trying to think of something to occupy my mind. =
What am I to think=20

about? I feel as though everything had been thought over already and there =
is nothing which could=20

hold my attention now.  When daylight comes I sit up in bed with my arms ro=
und my knees, and to=20

pass the time I try to know myself. "Know thyself" is excellent and useful =
advice; it is only a pity=20

that the ancients never thought to indicate the means of following this pre=
cept.  When I have=20

wanted to understand somebody or myself I have considered, not the actions,=
 in which everything=20

is relative, but the desires.  "Tell me what you want, and I will tell you =
what manner of man you=20

are."  And now I examine myself: what do I want?  I want our wives, our chi=
ldren, our friends, our=20

pupils, to love in us, not our fame, not the brand and not the label, but t=
o love us as ordinary men.=20

Anything else? I should like to have had helpers and successors. Anything e=
lse? I should like to=20



wake up in a hundred years' time=20


_
mentioned, but they use them for bathing and so forth, and drink from wells=
, thus avoiding their=20

unwholesomeness. At Troezen it cannot be avoided, because no other kind of =
water at all is=20

found, except what the Cibdeli furnish, and so in that city all or most of =
the people have diseases=20

of the feet. At the city of Tarsus in Cilicia is a river named Cydnus, in w=
hich gouty people soak=20

their legs and find relief from pain.  7. There are also many other kinds o=
f water which have=20

peculiar properties; for example, the river Himera in Sicily, which, after =
leaving its source, is=20

divided into two branches. One flows in the direction of Etruria and has an=
 exceedingly sweet taste=20

on account of a sweet juice in the soil through which it runs; the other ru=
ns through a country=20

where there are salt pits, and so it has a salt taste. At Paraetonium, and =
on the road to Ammon,=20

and at Casius in Egypt there are marshy lakes which are so science. I shoul=
d have liked to have=20

lived another ten years... What further? Why, nothing further. I think and =
think, and can think of=20

nothing more. And however much I might think, and however far my thoughts m=
ight travel, it is=20

clear to me that there is nothing vital, nothing of great importance in my =
desires. In my passion for=20

science, in my desire to live, in this sitting on a strange bed, and in thi=
s striving to know myself--in=20

all the thoughts, feelings, and ideas I form about everything, there is no =
common bond to connect=20

it all into one whole. Every feeling and every thought exists apart in me; =
and in all my criticisms of=20

science, the theatre, literature, my pupils, and in all the pictures my ima=
gination draws, even the=20

most skilful analyst could not find what is called a general idea, or the g=
od of a living man.  And if=20

there is not that, then there is nothing.  In a state so poverty-stricken, =
a serious=20


_
surface. In many other places there are springs and rivers and lakes which =
are necessarily=20

rendered salt because they run through salt pits.  8. Others flow through s=
uch greasy veins of soil=20

that they are overspread with oil when they burst out as springs: for examp=
le, at Soli, a town in the=20

influences of circumstance and men were enough to turn upside down and scat=
ter in fragments all=20

which I had once looked upon as my theory of life, and in which I had seen =
the meaning and joy of=20

my existence. So there is nothing surprising in the fact that I have over-s=
hadowed the last=20
