"Bless ye, deary!" crooned the little old woman, enfolding Ruth in her arms=
. "Go and have the best=20

of times with your young friends. We'll be thinkin' of ye here--and don't r=
un into peril up there in the=20

woods. Have a care."  "Oh, we won't get into any trouble," Ruth declared, h=
appily, with no=20

suspicion of what was before the party in the backwoods. "Goodbye!"  "Good-=
bye, Ruthie--Oh, my=20

back and oh, my bones!" groaned Aunt Alvirah, as she hobbled into the house=
 again, while Ruth=20

ran down to the car, leaped aboard, and the chauffeur started immediately. =
Ben, the hired man,=20

had gone on to Cheslow with Ruth's trunk early in the morning, and now the =
automobile sped=20

quickly over the smooth road to the railroad station.  By several different=
 ways--for Cheslow was a=20

junction of the railroad lines--the young folk who had been invited to Snow=
 Camp had gathered at=20

the station to meet the Camerons and Ruth Fielding. Nobody noticed Fred Hat=
field, saving Mr.=20

Cameron and Ruth herself; but the runaway found no opportunity of leaving t=
he party. Tom had no=20

attention to give the Scarboro boy as he welcomed his own chums.  "Here's o=
ld Bobbins and Busy=20

Izzy!" he cried, seeing Bob Steele and his sister, with Isadore Phelps, pac=
ing the long platform as=20

the car halted.  Bob Steele was a big, yellow-haired boy, rosy cheeked and =
good-natured, but not=20

a little bashful. As Madge, his sister, was a year and a half would go the =
length of downright=20

disobedience. I have met with nothing of the kind yet----"  "I think you ar=
e likely to meet with it=20

now," said Rintoul; and then he added, hastily, "Carry has not been an enco=
uraging example."=20

"Carry!" said Lord Lindores, opening his eyes. "I confess that I do not und=
erstand. Carry! why,=20

what woman could have a nobler position? Perfect control over a very large =
fortune, a situation of=20

entire independence--too much for any woman. That Carry's unexampled good f=
ortune should be=20

quoted against me is extraordinary indeed."  "But," cried Rintoul, taken by=
 surprise, "you could not=20

hold up to Edith the hope of what might happen if--Millefleurs were to----"=
  "Break his neck over a=20

scaur," said Lord Lindores, almost with a sneer. He felt his son shrink fro=
m him with an inarticulate=20

cry, and with instant perception remedied his error in taste, as he thought=
 it. "I ought not to speak=20

so after such a tragedy; you are right, Rintoul. No: Millefleurs is a very =
different person; but of=20

course it is always a consolation to know that whatever happens, one's chil=
d will be abundantly=20

and honourably provided for. My boy, let us look at the other matter. It is=
 time you thought of=20

marrying, as I say."  Rintoul flung himself against the side of the carriag=
e with a muttered curse.=20

"Marrying!--hanging is more what I feel like!" he cried.  "Rintoul!"  "Don'=
t torture me, father.=20


_
small boy indeed.  "Now, Master Cameron!" she cried, when Tom appeared, "do=
n't muss his nice=20

clean clothes. Be careful he doesn't get into anything. Be a good boy, Bobb=
ie, and the choo-choo=20

cars will soon come."  Isadore Phelps was a sharp-looking boy, with red hai=
r and so many freckles=20

across the bridge of his nose and under his eyes that, at a little distance=
, he looked as though he=20

wore a brown mask. Isadore seldom spoke without asking a question. He was a=
 walking=20

interrogation point. Perhaps that was one reason why he was known among his=
 mates as "Busy=20

Izzy," being usually busy about other people's business.  "What do you let =
her nag you for that=20

way, Bob?" he cried. "I'd shake her, if she was my sister--wouldn't you, To=
m?"  "No," said Tom,=20

boldly, for he considered Madge Steele quite a young lady. "She's too big t=
o shake--isn't she,=20

Bobbins?"  But Bob only smiled in his slow way, and said nothing. The girls=
 were in a group by=20

themselves--Helen and Ruth, Belle and Lluella, Jennie Stone (who rejoiced i=
n the nickname of=20

"Heavy" because of her plumpness) and Madge Steele. Mr. Cameron had gone to=
 the ticket=20

window to make an inquiry. It was Ruth who saw Fred Hatfield making across =
the tracks to where=20

a freight train was being face of the earth. Link an innocent woman's name =
with mine? Ask a girl=20

to?----For heaven's sake let me alone--let me be!"  "What is the meaning of=
 this?" Lord Lindores=20

cried. "Are you mad, Rintoul? I am altogether unprepared for heroics in you=
."  The young man=20

made no reply. He put his head out to the rushing of the night air and the =
soft darkness, through=20

which the trees and distant hills and rare passengers were all like shadows=
. He had looked stolidly=20

enough upon all the shows of the external world all his life, and thought n=
o more of them than as=20

he saw them.      "A primrose by the river's brim,     A yellow primrose wa=
s to him."  There had=20

been no images or similitudes in light or darkness; but now another world h=
ad opened around him.=20

He had a secret with the silence--the speechless, inanimate things about kn=
ew something of him=20

which nobody else knew: and who could tell when they might find a voice and=
 proclaim it to the=20

world? He uncovered his head to the air which blew upon him and cooled his =
fever. The touch of=20

that cool fresh wind seemed the only thing in earth or heaven in which ther=
e was any consolation.=20

As for Lord Lindores, he sat back in his corner, more angry than concerned,=
 and more=20

contemptuous than either. A=20

south.  "Tom!" she cried to Helen's brother, and he turned and saw her glan=
ce.  "By George,=20

fellows!" exclaimed Tom, with some disgust. "There's that chap sneaking off=
 again. We've got to=20

watch him. Come on!"  He ran after the runaway. Busy Izzy was at his ear in=
 a moment:  "What's=20

the matter with him? Who is he? What's he been doing? Is he trying to get a=
board that freight?=20

What do you want of him?"  "Oh, hush! hush!" begged Tom. "Your clatter woul=
d deafen one." Then=20

he shouted to Hatfield: "Hold on, there! the train will be in soon. Come ba=
ck!"  Hatfield stopped=20

and turned back with a scowl. Tom grinned at him cheerfully and added:  "Mi=
ght as well take it=20

easy. Dad says you're to go along with us, so I advise some excuse for nerv=
es; but that his son,=20

upon whose plain understanding he could always rely, and whose common-sense=
 was always=20

alive to the importance of substantial arguments, should thus relapse into =
tragedy like his sisters,=20

was more than he could tolerate. He would not even contemplate the idea tha=
t there was any=20

cause for it. Rintoul had always been well behaved. He was in no fear of an=
y secrets that his son=20

might have to reveal.  "Rintoul," he said, after a pause, "if you have got =
into any scrape, you=20

should know well enough that I am not the sort of man to take it tragically=
. I have no faith in=20

making molehills into mountains. I don't suppose you have done anything dis=
graceful. You must=20

be off your head,=20


_
"Pleasant-looking young dog," said Bob, in an undertone. "What's he done?" =
 "I don't know that he=20

has done anything," returned Tom, in the same low tone. "But we're going to=
 take him with us to=20

Scarboro. That is the place he has run away from."  "Did he run away from h=
ome?" demanded=20

Isadore Phelps. "What for?"  "I don't know. But don't you ask him!" command=
ed Tom. "He wouldn't=20

tell you, anyway; he won't tell father. But don't nag him, Izzy."  To the g=
reat surprise of the young=20

folks, when the train bound north came along, there was a private car attac=
hed to it, and in that car=20

the Cameron party were to travel. One of the railroad officials had lent hi=
s own coach to the=20

Cheslow merchant, and he and his party had the car to themselves.  There wa=
s a porter and a=20

steward aboard--both colored men; and soon after the train started odors fr=
om the tiny kitchen=20

assured the girls and boys that they were to have luncheon think. What is i=
t? You have been out of=20

sorts for some time past."  These words came like beatings of a drum to Rin=
toul's ears, as he leant=20

out into the rushing and sweep of the night air. There was a composure in t=
hem which brought him=20

to himself. Anything disgraceful meant cheating at cards, or shirking debts=
 of honour, or=20

cowardice. Practically, these were about the only things disgraceful that a=
 young man could do. An=20

"entanglement," a heavy loss at cards or on the turf, any other minor vice,=
 could be compounded=20

for. Lord Lindores was not alarmed by the prospect of an explanation with h=
is son. But that Rintoul=20

should become melodramatic, and appeal to earth and heaven, was contemptibl=
e to his father.=20

This cool and common-sense tone had its natural effect, Lord Lindores thoug=
ht. Rintoul drew in his=20

head, sat back in his corner, and was restored to himself.  "I have been ou=
t of sorts," he said--"I=20

suppose=20


_
"Isn't it delightful?" sighed Heavy, gustily, in Ruth's ear. "Riding throug=
h the country on this fast=20

train and being served with our meals--Oh, dear! why weren't _all_ fathers =
born rich?"  "It's lucky=20

your father isn't any richer than he is, Jennie Stone!" whispered Madge Ste=
ele, who heard this. "If=20

he was, you'd do nothing but eat all the livelong day."  "Well, I might do =
a deal worse," returned=20

Heavy. "Father says that himself. He says he wishes my reports were better =
at Briarwood; but he=20

can't expect me to put on flesh and gain much learning at the same time--no=
t when the days are=20

only twenty-four hours long."  They all laughed a good deal at Heavy, but s=
he was so good-

natured that the girls all liked her, too. What they should do when they re=
ached Snow Camp was=20

the principal topic of conversation. As the train swept northward the snow =
appeared. It was piled in=20

fence everything _en noir_. All this business--seeing to things--the black,=
 the house shut up----"=20

"Let me warn you, Rintoul; don't cultivate your susceptibilities," said his=
 father. "What is black more=20

than blue or any other colour? This sort of thing is all very well for a wo=
man; but I know what it is.=20

It's stomach--that is really at the bottom of all tragedy. You had better s=
peak to the doctor. And=20

now, thank heaven, this Tinto business is over; we can get back to the affa=
irs of life."  The rest of=20

the drive passed in complete silence. And all the time they were together, =
Rintoul said not a word=20

to his father about John Erskine. His situation was altogether ignored betw=
een them. It was not=20

that it was forgotten. If these two men could have opened Dunnottar jail--n=
ay, could they have=20

swept John Erskine away into some happy island where he would have been too=
 blessed to think=20


_
were thickly mantled in the white covering.  Mr. Cameron read his papers or=
 wrote letters in one=20

compartment; Mrs. Murchiston was the girls' companion most of the time, whi=
le Tom and his two=20

chums had a gay time by themselves. They tried to get Fred Hatfield would h=
ave done it,--the one=20

with joyous alacrity, the other with satisfaction at least. This gloomy inc=
ident was over, and Lord=20

Lindores had no desire to hear any more of it. It was just the end that any=
body might have=20

expected Torrance to come to. Why could=20
