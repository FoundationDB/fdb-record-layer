CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF=20

THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR=20

REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of=
 receiving it, you can=20

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written=
 explanation to the person=20

you received the work from.  If you received the work on a physical medium,=
 you must return the=20

medium with your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided y=
ou with the defective=20

work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.  If you r=
eceived the work=20

electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give=
 you a second opportunity=20

to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy=
 is also defective, you may=20

demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem=
.  1.F.4.  Except for the=20

limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this w=
ork is provided to you 'AS-

IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, of lime, turns it into nitrate of=
 potash. The=20

precipitated lime gives the mass a whitish colour, and the consistence of c=
urdled milk. By allowing=20

it to stand in a large trough, the precipitate, which is principally lime, =
subsides, and the=20

superincumbent fluid, now an alkaline, instead of an earthy nitrate, is car=
efully removed and boiled=20

for some time in iron kettles, till it is ready to crystallize. It is then =
removed again to a large trough,=20

in which it shoots into crystals. It is now called "rough shot-petre." In t=
his state it is sent to market,=20

and sells usually for sixteen dollars per hundred weight. Sometimes it is d=
issolved in water,=20

reboiled, and recrystallized, when it is called refined, and sells for twen=
ty dollars per hundred. One=20

bushel of the clay dirt yields from 3 to 5lbs. and the black dirt from 7 to=
 10lbs. of the rough shot-

petre. The same dirt, if returned to the cave, and scattered on the rocks, =
or mingled with the new=20

earth, becomes impregnated with the nitrate again, and in a few months may =
be thrown into the=20

hopper, and be subjected to a new process.  The causes which have produced =
the nitric salts of=20

these caves, may not yet have been fully developed. But it is highly probab=
le, they are to be=20

ascribed to the decomposition of animal substances.  It is reasonable to su=
ppose, that in an=20

uncultivated country they would become the abodes of wild animals, and even=
 of savage men.=20



That they have been used by the natives as burial places, is certain. In on=
e which I entered, I=20

counted a hundred human skulls, in the space of twenty feet square. All the=
 lesser and more=20

corruptible parts of each skeleton had mouldered to dust, and the whole lay=
 in the greatest=20

confusion. I have heard of many such caves, and to this day some of the Ind=
ians are known to=20

deposit their dead in them. From the decomposition of such substances, it i=
s well known the acid=20

of the nitric salts arises, and it would of course unite with the lime ever=
y where present, and form=20

nitrate of lime.   _Mounds._  4. I have but one more article of curiosity t=
o mention under this=20

division. It is one of those artificial _mounds_ which occur so frequently =
in the western country. I=20

have seen many of them, and read of more. But never of one of such dimensio=
ns as that which I=20

am now to describe.  It is situated in the interior of the Cherokee nation,=
 on the north side of the=20

limitation of certain types=20

of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement vio=
lates the law of the state=20

agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent =
or employee of the=20

called _River Bottom_. I visited it in company with eight Indian chiefs. Th=
e first object which=20

excited attention was an excavation about twenty feet wide, and in some par=
ts ten feet deep. Its=20

course is nearly that of a semicircle; the extremities extending towards th=
e river, which forms a=20

small elbow. I had not time to examine it minutely. An Indian said it exten=
ded each way to the=20

river, and had several unexcavated parts, which served for passages to the =
area which it=20

encloses. To my surprise, I found no embankment on either side of it. But I=
 did not long doubt to=20

what place the earth had been removed; for I had scarcely proceeded two hun=
dred yards, when,=20
