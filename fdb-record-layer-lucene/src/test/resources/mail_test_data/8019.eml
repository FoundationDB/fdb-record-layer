"S.P. Hathaway lose out? Not on your life, my young friend! You say he was =
askin' for advice?=20

You've done stirred up my curiosity a whole heap, and I reckon you'll have =
to tell me who you are=20

before it'll ca'm down again."  Blount laughed. "Mr. Hathaway thinks I am a=
 special agent for the=20

Government, travelling on business for the Forest Service."  "The hell he d=
oes!" exploded the big=20

man. Then he reached over and laid a swollen finger on Blount's knee. "Say,=
 boy, before you or=20

him ever gets off this train--Sufferin' Moses! what was that?"  The break c=
ame upon a thunderous=20

crash transmitting itself from car to car, and the long, heavy train came t=
o a juggling stop. The=20

ranchman sprang to his feet with an alacrity surprising in so huge a body a=
nd ducked to look out of=20

the open window.  "Twin Buttes!" he gurgled. "And, say, it's a wreck! We've=
 hit something right=20

slap in the middle of the yard! Let's make a break for the scene of the con=
fliggration till we see=20

who's killed!"  Blount followed the ranchman's lead, but shortly lost sight=
 of the burly figure in the=20

crowd of curious passengers pouring from the hastily opened vestibules. See=
n at closer range, the=20

accident appeared to be disastrous only in a material sense. The heavy "Pac=
ific-type" locomotive=20

had stumbled over the tongue of a split switch, leaving the rails and makin=
g a blockading barrier of=20

itself across the tracks. Nobody was hurt; but there would be a delay of so=
me hours before the=20

track could be cleared.  Finding little to hold him in the spectacle of the=
 derailed locomotive, Blount=20

strolled In 1570 the Turks obtained possession of it, and have practically =
held it ever since.  "The=20

ruins of Salamis may be seen at the other end of the island. In the Book of=
 Acts we read that Paul=20

came over here. 'And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of G=
od in the=20

synagogues of the Jews.' Then the account informs us that they went 'throug=
h the isle' to Paphos;=20

and doubtless the place was near Point Papho, which I find on my chart. Don=
't forget to tell Mrs.=20

Blossom, Flix, that you have been to an island visited by Paul and Barnabas=
 in their missionary=20

travels.  "The island has about the same productions as Egypt. Carobs, or l=
ocust beans, figure up=20

to about $300,000. But I fear you will not remember any more figures if I s=
hould give them; and I=20

see there is something like a movement on board of the pirate."  "You must =
repeat that lecture on=20

board of the ship when we get back to her," added the captain. "It was tell=
ing us just what I wanted=20

to know."  "I could have done better if I had had the library of the Guardi=
an-Mother for reference,"=20

replied Louis, as all hands fixed their attention on the Fatime.  "They are=
 getting out a boat, sir,"=20

said Don, who had gone to the hurricane deck to obtain a better view.  "Tha=
t means that they=20

intend to pay us a visit; and as I intend to retain the command of the Maud=
 until I am relieved by=20

Captain Ringgold, I shall allow no one from the pirate to come on board," s=
aid Captain Scott in his=20

most decided tones. "All hands except Felipe will arm with breech-loaders a=
nd revolvers, with a=20

supply of ammunition, and=20

town. He remembered the place chiefly by its name. In his boyhood it had be=
en the nearest=20

railroad forwarding-point for the mines at Lewiston, thirty miles beyond th=
e Lost Hills. Now, as it=20

appeared, it had become a lumber-shipping station. To the left of the railr=
oad there were=20

numerous sawmills, each with its mountain of waste dominated by a black chi=
mney, screen-

capped. For the supply of logs an enormous flume led down from the slopes o=
f the forested range=20

on the south, a trough-like water-chute out of which, the port gangway."  T=
his order was promptly=20

executed, and the force collected at the place designated. This gangway was=
 concealed from the=20

enemy by the house on deck. Louis had two revolvers, and he loaned one to D=
on. Scott had=20

carried out a handsaw which was kept in the pilot-house in readiness for an=
y emergency, as well=20

as an axe and a hatchet. The captain had used this same saw with decided ef=
fect upon some=20

smugglers who attempted to obtain possession of the little steamer in the B=
ay of Gibraltar, and he=20

placed=20
