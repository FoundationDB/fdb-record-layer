en the first to challenge. Is there any other?=E2=80=9D  The aged leader tu=
rned his _
married to some one else--a condition exceedingly disagreeable to the first=
 husband; and required=20

four witnesses to prove a charge of adultery against a wife--a merciful pro=
vision, difficult to be=20

fulfilled. The evil permitted by Mohammad in leaving the number of wives fo=
ur instead of insisting=20

on monogamy was not great. Without considering the sacrifice of family peac=
e which the=20

possession of a large harem entails, the expense of keeping several wives, =
each of whom must=20

have a separate suite of apartments or a separate house, is so great that n=
ot more than one in=20

twenty can afford it. It is not so much in the matter of wives as in that o=
f concubines that=20

Mohammad made an irretrievable mistake. The condition of the female slave i=
n the East is indeed=20

deplorable. She is at the entire mercy of her master, who can do what he pl=
eases with her and her=20

companions; for the Muslim is not restricted in the number them, standing l=
onely and aloof in the=20

place of honor under the big tree. His lordly head, with its great spread o=
f antlers, was held high,=20

so that some of those who had come to scoff and laugh at him felt a sudden =
awe. There was none=20

of the meekness and humility of a fallen leader in his attitude.  Black Buc=
k and the other older=20

bucks, who had long years before contended with Father Buck for leadership,=
 were impressed by=20

his looks, and they took their places in the semi-circle in uneasy silence.=
 Suppose Father Buck=20

should challenge again for leadership despite his failure of the previous d=
ay! Could any of them=20

win in a mighty battle with him? They, too, were growing old, and their lim=
bs and eyes were not as=20

strong and sure as when they were young.  =E2=80=9CYou know the law of the =
herd, and of my people,=E2=80=9D=20

Father Buck announced when all the deer were there. =E2=80=9CYesterday I fa=
iled you. It was the first time=20

since I=20


_
in that of his wives. The female white slave is kept solely for the master'=
s sensual gratification, and=20

is sold when he is tired of her, and so she passes from master to master, a=
 very wreck of=20

womanhood. Her condition is a little improved if she bear a son to her tyra=
nt; but even then he is at=20

liberty to refuse to acknowledge the child as his own, though it must be ow=
ned he seldom does=20

this. Kind as the Prophet was himself towards bondswomen, one cannot forget=
 the unutterable=20

brutalities which he suffered his followers to inflict upon conquered natio=
ns in the taking of slaves.=20

The Muslim soldier was allowed to do as he pleased with any 'infidel' woman=
 he might meet with=20

on his victorious march. When one thinks of the thousands of women, mothers=
 and daughters,=20

who must have suffered untold shame and dishonour by this license, he canno=
t find words to=20

express his horror. And this cruel indulgence has left its mark on the Musl=
im character, nay, on the=20

whole character of Eastern life. Now, as at the first, young Christian girl=
s are dragged away from=20

their homes and given over to the unhallowed I challenge for it again, and =
win it by my might.=E2=80=9D  He=20

swung his antlered head around at the half circle of older bucks. There was=
 a menace and=20

challenge in the beautiful eyes.  =E2=80=9CWe want a new leader!=E2=80=9D b=
ellowed Black Buck angrily. =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t=20

lead us again, Father Buck! You have failed in the chase. Twice you failed =
within a day. A new=20

leader is what we demand!=E2=80=9D  There was a chorus of approvals, and Bl=
ack Buck gained courage by=20

the backing his words received, but Father Buck cut him off short.  =E2=80=
=9CBe silent!=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CI am still=20

leader, and my word is law! If I choose to challenge again, the right is mi=
ne. It is the law of the=20

herd. Who speaks otherwise?=E2=80=9D  There was no disputing this. The law =
of the herd was very simple,=20

and it had to be obeyed. Even Black Buck knew this, and if he chose Father =
Buck could challenge=20

and prove his right to remain leader if he proved himself better than all o=
thers.  =E2=80=9CIf you challenge=20

again,=E2=80=9D began Black Buck, =E2=80=9Cyou must do battle with the youn=
g bucks as well as the others. That=E2=80=99s=20

the law isn=E2=80=99t it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is!=E2=80=9D replied Father=

and weak, my eyes may=20

With Mohammad's views of women, we could hardly expect him to do better; bu=
t, on the other=20

hand, he could scarcely have done worse. There are, however, one or two all=
eviating=20

circumstances. One is the fact that the canker has not eaten into the whole=
 of Eastern society; it is=20

chiefly among the rich that the evil effects of the system are felt. And an=
other fact which shows=20

that the Mohammadan system, bad as it is, is free from a defect which socia=
l systems better in=20

other respects than Mohammad's are subject to is the extreme rarity of pros=
titution in Muslim=20

towns. The courtesan forms a very small item in the census of a Mohammadan =
city, and is=20

retained more for strangers from Europe than for the Muslim inhabitants. In=
stances are frequently=20

occurring in the Indian law courts which this challenge. Come and accept it=
. I will fight for the=20

leadership!=E2=80=9D  An uneasy thrill swept the multitude. Each turned to =
look the other in the eye. Who=20

would accept Father Buck=E2=80=99s challenge? Black Buck hesitated, measuri=
ng the sturdy limbs of the=20

leader with his own, and comparing the thick-set neck and head of antlers w=
ith those of his=20

immediate neighbors. There was not one qualified to enter the lists and hop=
e to carry off the=20

honors.  =E2=80=9CI hear no one!=E2=80=9D shouted Father Buck. =E2=80=9CThe=
 challenge is not accepted. So be it! Then we=20

come to the second challenge. Here, too, the law gives me the right to figh=
t with the younger=20

bucks for leadership. We have many of them=E2=80=94young, sturdy, bright-ey=
ed offsprings of ours who=20

will some day win honors in the chase. They have eyes as keen as ours were=

exists on the subject among the Mohammadans of India. They consider it quit=
e inconceivable that=20

a Muslim should have illicit intercourse with a free Muslimeh woman, and th=
is inconceivableness=20

of the action is urged as evidence in trials of the legitimacy of children.=
 But whilst admitting the=20

importance of this remarkable feature in Islam, it must not be forgotten th=
at the liberty allowed by=20

their law to Muslims in the matter of concubines does not very materially d=
iffer from prostitution,=20

and whilst the latter is directly forbidden by the dominant religion of Eur=
ope, concubinage is as=20

directly permitted by Islam.  One would think that long intercourse with Eu=
ropeans might have=20

somewhat raised the estimation of women in the East; but either because tra=

.=E2=80=9D  He stopped and=20

gazed around at the big assembly. His words and commanding figure had made =
even Father=20

Buck=E2=80=99s worst enemies respectful. The outcome of the meeting was sti=
ll uncertain and wrapped in=20

mystery.  =E2=80=9CTherefore,=E2=80=9D the leader continued after a pause, =

Who of the younger ones challenges for the high honor of leader to take my =

excitement passed around, for the crucial moment had now arrived. Father Bu=

Western morality, or because the Eastern mind has an unequalled aptitude fo=

then halted before Father=20

Buck.  =E2=80=9CI, Young Black Buck, son of Black Buck of Dismal Swamp, cha=
