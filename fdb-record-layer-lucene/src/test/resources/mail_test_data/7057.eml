I am busy.  _Director._ But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself. Besides, you shall 

have a present.  _The voice._ I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me?  _Director._ He 

says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman.                                                           [_Exit._ 

END OF THE PROLOGUE     ACT THE FIRST  THE GEMS ARE LEFT BEHIND   [_Enter, with a 

cloak in his hand, Maitreya._]  _Maitreya._  "You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy." 

And yet I really ought to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of 

affairs! When good Charudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill of the most deliciously 

fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of 

the courtyard, where I was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his 

paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them aside. I would stand 

chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, 

and everywhere, and come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this jasmine-scented 

cloak, which Charudatta's good friend Jurnavriddha has sent him. He bade me give it to 

Charudatta, as soon as he had finished his devotions. So now I will look for Charudatta. [_He 

walks about and looks around him._] Charudatta has finished his devotions, and here he comes 

with an offering for the divinities of the house.  [_Enter Charudatta as described, and Radanika._] 

_Charudatta._ [_Looking up and sighing wearily._]      Upon my threshold, where the offering 

Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,     The grass grows now, and these poor 

seeds I fling       Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains.      9  [_He walks about 

very slowly and seats himself._]  _Maitreya_. Charudatta is here. I must go and speak to him. 

[_Approaching._] My greetings to you. May happiness be yours.  P. 13.1]  _Charudatta._ Ah, it is 

my constant friend Maitreya. You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.  _Maitreya._ 

Thank you. [_He seats himself._] Well, comrade, here is a jasmine-scented cloak which your good 

friend Jurnavriddha has sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions. 

[_He presents the cloak. Charudatta takes it and remains sunk in thought._] Well, what are you 

thinking about?  _Charudatta._ My good friend,      A candle shining through the deepest dark 

Is happiness that follows sorrow's strife;     But after bliss when man bears reader through chivalric 

exaltations to vulgar disillusion. The writer was not insensible to the charm of the ideals of the 

past, but he presents them only in the end to cover them with disgrace. The anonymous farce of 

_Pathelin_, and the _Chronique de petit Jehan de Saintre_, are perhaps the most instructive 

documents which we possess with respect to the moral temper of the close of the Middle Ages; 

and there have been critics who have ventured to ascribe both works to the same hand.   II THE 

DRAMA  The mediaeval drama in France, though of early origin, attained its full development only 

when the Middle Ages were approaching their term; its popularity continued during the first half of 

the sixteenth century. It waited for a public; with the growth of industry, the uprising of the middle 

classes, it secured its audience, and in some measure filled the blank created by the 

disappearance of the _chansons de geste_. The survivals of the drama of the twelfth and 

thirteenth centuries are few; the stream, as we know, was flowing, but it ran underground.  The 

religious drama had its origin in the liturgical offices of the Church. At Christmas and at Easter the 

birth and resurrection of the Saviour were dramatically recited to the people by the clergy, within 

the consecrated building, in Latin paraphrases of the sacred text; but, as yet, neither Jesus nor His 

mother appeared as actors in the drama. By degrees the vernacular encroached upon the Latin 



and displaced it; the scene passed from the church to the public place or street; the action 

developed; and the actors were priests supported by lay-folk, or were lay-folk alone.  The oldest 

surviving drama written in French (but with interspersed liturgical sentences of Latin) is of the 

twelfth century--the _Representation d'Adam_: the fall of man, and the first great crime which 

followed--the death of Abel--are succeeded by the procession of Messianic prophets. It was 

enacted outside the church, and the spectators were alarmed or diverted by demons who darted 

to and fro amidst the crowd. Of the thirteenth century, only two religious pieces remain. Jean 

Bodel, of Arras, was the author of _Saint Nicholas_. The poet, himself about to assume the cross, 

exhibits a handful of Crusaders in combat with the Mussulmans; all but one, a supplicant of the 

saint, die gloriously, with angelic applause and pity; whereupon the feelings of the audience are 

relieved by the mirth and quarrels of drinkers in a tavern, who would rob St. Nicholas of the 

treasure entrusted to his safeguard; miracles, and general

His body lives a very death-in-life.                       10  _Maitreya._ Well, which would you rather, be 

dead or be poor?  _Charudatta._ Ah, my friend,      Far better death than sorrows sure and slow; 

Some passing suffering from death may flow,     But poverty brings _Theophile_, the ambitious 

priest who pawned his soul to Satan, and through our Lady's intercession recovered his written 

compact, is by the trouvere Rutebeuf. These are scanty relics of a hundred years; yet their literary 

value outweighs that of the forty-two _Miracles de Notre Dame_ 


_
_Maitreya._ My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has been conveyed to them you 

love, and like the moon, after she has yielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an 

added charm.  _Charudatta._ Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But      This is my 

sorrow. They whom I     Would greet as guests, now pass me by.     "This is a poor man's house," 

they cry.      As flitting bees, the season o'er,     Desert the elephant, whose store     Of ichor[30] 

spent, attracts no more.                        12  _Maitreya._ Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not 

worth thinking about. It is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it doesn't stay anywhere 

where it is used for food.  [8.5. S.  _Charud._ Believe me, friend. My sorrow does not spring 

From simple loss of gold;     For fortune is a fickle, changing thing,       Whose favors do not hold; 

But he whose sometime wealth has taken wing,       Finds bosom-friends grow cold. 

13  Then too:      A poor man is a man ashamed; from shame     Springs want of dignity and 

worthy fame;     Such want gives rise to insults hard to bear;     Thence comes despondency; and 

thence, despair;     Despair breeds folly; death is folly's fruit--     Ah! the lack of money is all evils 

root!                     14  _Maitreya._ But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and be more 

cheerful.  _Charudatta._ My friend, the poverty of a man is to him      A home of cares, a shame 

that haunts the mind,     Another form of warfare with mankind;     The abhorrence of his friends, a 

source of hate     From strangers, and from each once-loving mate;     But if his wife despise him, 

then 't were meet     In some lone wood to seek a safe retreat.     The flame of sorrow, torturing his 

soul,     Burns fiercely, yet contrives to leave him whole.            15  Comrade, I have made my 

offering to the divinities of the house. Do you too go and offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a 

place where four roads meet.  _Maitreya._ No!  _Charudatta._ Why not?  _Maitreya._ Because the 

gods are not gracious to you even trivial, often absurd in their incidents, with mystic extravagance 

sanctifying their vulgar realism. They formed, with two exceptions, the dramatic repertory of some 

mediaeval _puy_, an association half-literary, half-religious, devoted to the Virgin's honour; their 

rhymed octosyllabic verse--the special dramatic form--at times borders upon prose. One drama, 

and only one, of the fourteenth century, chooses another heroine than our Lady--the _Histoire de 

Griselidis_, which presents, with pathos and intermingling mirth, those marvels of wifely patience 

celebrated for other lands by Boccaccio, by Petrarch, and by Chaucer.  The fifteenth-century 

Mystery exhibits the culmination of the mediaeval sacred drama. The word _mystere_,[2] first 

appropriated to tableaux vivants, is applied to dramatic performances in the royal privilege which 

in 1402 conferred upon the association known as the _Confrerie de la Passion_ the right of 

performing the plays of our Redemption. Before this date the Blessed Virgin and the infant Jesus 

had appeared upon the scene. The Mystery presents the course of sacred story, derived from the 

Old and the New Testaments, together with the lives of the saints from apostolic times to the days 

of St. Dominic and St. Louis; it even includes, in an extended sense, subjects from profane history-

-the siege of Orleans, the destruction of Troy--but such subjects are of rare occurrence during the 

fifteenth century.  [Footnote 2: Derived from _ministerium_ (_metier_), but doubtless often drawing 

to itself a sense suggested by the _mysteries_ of religion.]  For a hundred years, from 1450 

onwards, an unbounded enthusiasm for the stage possessed the people, not of Paris merely, but 

of all France. The _Confreres de la Passion_, needing a larger repertoire, found in young 

ARNOUL GREBAN, bachelor in theology, an author whose vein was copious. His _Passion_, 

written about the middle of the fifteenth century, embraces the entire earthly life of Christ in its 



thirty-four thousand verses, which required one hundred and fifty performers and four crowded 

days for the delivery. Its presentation was an unprecedented event in 


_
thus honored. So what is the use of worshiping?  P. 16.8]  _Charudatta._ Not so, my friend, not so! 

This is the constant duty of a householder.      The gods feel ever glad content     In the gifts, and 

the self-chastisement,     The meditations, and the prayers,     Of those who banish worldly cares. 

16  Why then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.  _Maitreya._ No, I'm not 

going. You must send somebody else. Anyway, everything seems to go wrong with me, poor 

Brahman that I am! It's like a was rehandled and enlarged by Jean Michel, and great was the 

triumph when it was given at Angers in 1486. Greban was not to be outdone either by his former 

self or by another dramatist; in collaboration with his brother Simon, he composed the yet more 

enormous _Actes des Apotres_, in sixty-two thousand lines, demanding the services of five 

hundred performers. When presented at Bourges as late as 1536, the happiness of the spectators 

was extended over no fewer than forty days. The Mystery of the Old Testament, selecting 

whatever was supposed to

left, and the left becomes the right. Besides, at this hour of the evening, people are abroad upon 

the king's highway--courtezans, courtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take me now for 

fair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the mouse in his path. But what will 

you do sitting here?  _Charudatta._ Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions.         *       * 

*       *       *  _Voices behind the scenes._ Stop, Vasantasena, stop!  [_Enter Vasantasena, 

pursued by the courtier, by Sansthanaka, and the servant._]  _Courtier._ Vasantasena! Stop, less 

vast, and is not less incoherent. Taken together, the Mysteries comprise over a million verses, and 

what remains is but a portion of what was written.  Though the literary value of the Mysteries is 

slight, except in occasional passages of natural feeling or just characterisation, their historical 

importance was great; they met a national demand--they constituted an animated and moving 

spectacle of universal interest. A certain unity they possessed in the fact that everything revolved 

around the central figure of Christ and the central theme of man's salvation; but such unity is only
