  [Sidenote: ADMITTING NEW MEMBERS]=20

Members should be taken into a club because they have qualifications which =
will add to the=20

pleasure and profit of the membership at large. One should not vote for or =
against a candidate for=20

purely personal reasons. Many kind people, who are yet ignorant of the prop=
er law for limiting the=20

membership of a club, consider it an act of enmity to blackball a candidate=
 for membership=20

whether she be fitted for that membership or not. This is a mistaken and a =
sentimental theory. It is=20

indeed disagreeable to blackball, but it is sometimes necessary. Those who =
propose members for=20



a club should feel the responsibility of such proposals and thus, as far as=
 lies within their power,=20

avoid for the membership, or committee controlling this matter, the unpleas=
ant necessity of=20

refusing or blackballing a candidate.  [Sidenote: ADDRESSING THE PRESIDENT]=
  The new=20

member should be received with courtesy by the older members of the club. H=

necessary, are made. For=20

=E2=80=99s part should be a=20

tates Senate that the new=20

senator does not speak on any matter of importance for a year after his ele=
ction. Exactly so,=20

modesty demands that the new member in a woman=E2=80=99s club, unless speci=

THE CAUSE AND CURE OF=20

SICKNESS   BY DAVID V. BUSH  What is the kink in your mind? Does your subco=
nscious mind=20

warrant the expenditure, a club should rent a convenient and acceptable pla=
ce, where its regular=20

meetings can be held.  [Sidenote: THE CLUB BREAKFAST]  Once a year, usually=
 at the=20

beginning of the president=E2=80=99s term of office, it is customary for th=
e club to give some sort of=20

entertainment for its members. This may be a luncheon or breakfast, a high =
tea or merely an=20

afternoon reception, where salad, ices and coffee are served. At this festi=
vity, after the menu has=20

been served, the retiring president bids good-by to her office and introduc=
es her successor, who=20

acts as toast-mistress for the occasion. The toasts should be few in number=
, not more than five or=20

six, and the time occupied by each should be from five to seven minutes. Co=
mmonly, the subjects=20

for toasts should be of a lively pleasing nature, and should be treated in =
a manner to correspond.=20

To take advantage of a festive occasion for the delivery of a lamentation o=
r a sermon is in very=20

bad taste. It should be remembered by the speaker that she is expected to e=
ntertain and not to=20

instruct.  [Sidenote: UNWISE CRITICISM]  The spirit of the members toward c=
lub performances=20

should be kindly and genial, if good=20


_
thoughts of fear, sickness, poverty, unhappiness--do you lack courage--have=
 you been hampered=20

in reaching your success goal--do you want to be master of self and your ow=
n destiny? Do you=20

wish to conquer disease--strengthen your personality--be more and do more? =
 Here then is a way=20

to overcome all these mental handicaps and develop within yourself construc=
tive action. Dr. Bush,=20

through his vast experience in handling thousands of cases, has proven beyo=
nd a doubt that all=20

sickness, poverty and unhappiness is caused by "KINKS" in the mind. When th=
e store house of=20

the intellect, the subconscious mind, becomes clogged up with morbid though=
ts and destructive=20

suggestions the physical being refuses to work in harmony.  Dr. Bush tells =
you how to train your=20

subconscious mind along the path of creative thinking. He points out the me=
ans of attaining the=20

very things in life that your better self has longed for. He explains how y=
ou make your "Dreams of=20

success come true" and he gives you actual examples.  The secret of success=
, health and=20

prosperity will no longer remain a secret for you, if you will read and fol=
low the instructions of this=20

wonderful teacher.  If you are sick this book tells you why you are sick--i=
t explains the mental=20

processes that react on your physical nature--it places within your reach t=
he means of curing=20

yourself and the face of ill-natured criticism. The standard of work can on=
ly be raised by each=20

member doing her best, and keeping an open mind for the performances of her=
 acquaintances.=20

Frequently a special advantage in hearing club papers lies in one=E2=80=99s=
 acquaintance with the writer,=20

which makes it possible for one to interpret much more richly than would be=
 possible in the printed=20

page of a personally unknown author. This is the =E2=80=9Cunearned incremen=
t=E2=80=9D of club membership, one=20

of the best returns for its fellowship; and, in order to get the most out o=
f one=E2=80=99s connection with a=20

literary club where, in the nature of things, one can not be expecting lite=
rary masterpieces, one=20

must be on the lookout for this personal quality which adds so largely to t=
he written and spoken=20

words heard there.     CHAPTER XXXV  CHARITIES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE   CHARIT=
Y begins=20

at home, but it is a great mistake to suppose that it should end there. Ind=
eed, in the last analysis,=20

to do for one=E2=80=99s own family is not charity, but a form of selfishnes=
s. The truly generous spirit can not=20

resist the call to help the poor and needy, the outcast and degraded.  One=
=E2=80=99s relation to charity=20

should not be accidental, but should form a part of the plan of one=E2=80=
=99s life. It is not very creditable to=20

is ashamed to say=20

L IN=20

VISUALIZING   RULES FOR VISUALIZATION  To visualize and concentrate success=
fully, certain=20

definite principles underlying the laws that control the functions of the m=
ind must be understood=20

and applied. My experience in thousands of cases shows that failure is ofte=
n due to the wrong=20

application of these laws--to a misunderstanding of the mental processes ne=
cessary to properly=20

focus the thought waves upon some definite desire and the urge of the consc=
ious mind for too=20

hasty action.  The laws of visualization and concentration are well defined=
 and when properly=20

exercised are without limitation as to success, but to accomplish results o=
ne must understand and=20

use these laws properly.  You will more readily grasp the principle that go=
verns the laws of=20

visualization and concentration after reading this little booklet.  In it D=
r. David Bush has gone right=20

down to bed rock--he thoroughly explains these necessary laws--he puts you =
right and shows you=20

your mistakes--he starts you off on the right foot so that for their first =
discussion of finance, of how=20

much they shall spend for house, for clothes, how much for food, how much f=
or amusement and=20

so on, this question of what shall be done for those poorer than themselves=
 should have a place.=20

No matter how small the sum possible, something should be given to philanth=
ropic work.  The=20

woman of the family is very often, directly or indirectly, the dispenser of=
 the money devoted to=20

charity. She is the one who decides into what channels it shall go. She has=
 the time for=20

investigating the needs of societies and of individuals. The work, too, tha=
t accompanies gifts of=20

charity more often falls to her lot than to a man. This is a department of =
service properly belonging=20

to her. She has natural rights in this section of the world=E2=80=99s work,=
 of which she should be proud.=20

*       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: TWO KINDS OF CHARITIES]  Char=
ities, broadly, are of two=20

kinds, public and private; and activity in one should not preclude activity=
 in the other. The ideal=20

administration of charity would consist in every person comfortably establi=
shed, having among his=20

real friends several poor persons or poor families from whom he himself rec=
eived a broadening=20

knowledge of life, as well as to whom he gave of physical necessities. In t=
he absence of this ideal=20

situation, he must avail himself of the best means open to him. He must tak=
e advantage of the=20

splendid organization of modern charities, but he must not forget also to b=
e on the lookout for=20

individual cases of need that are not likely to appear before the board of =
any philanthropic=20

organization.  [Sidenote: BUILDING UP CHARACTER]  We hear it from the pulpi=
t and the platform=20

continually, yet not too often, that organized charitable work is one of th=
e finest achievements of=20

our present civilization. Narrow-minded people sometimes say that our grand=
mothers got along=20

very well without it, and did as much good as the women of the present day.=
 They got on without it=20



only because they did=20


_
these laws for your benefit and profit.  Dr. Bush believes, from his own va=
st experience, that more=20

people fail on concentration and visualization than on any other operation =
of the laws of mind now=20

being studied or applied, because they only partly understand these laws. I=
n this pamphlet he=20

shows _why_ the vast majority of people fail in visualizing. There are natu=
ral laws which are very=20

often cross-circuited by well intentioned people trying to operate them for=
 their good, all because=20

they fail to understand the right way. You will understand visualization af=
ter you read "Why Some=20

People Fail in Visualization."  Send for this book today--you will understa=
nd this subject after=20

reading it--you need it now---send 25c in stamps or coin.     THE INFLUENCE=
 OF SUGGESTION=20

AND AUTO-SUGGESTION  In this little booklet Dr. David V. Bush discusses Sug=
gestion and=20

Auto-Suggestion from a different angle than that in "Practical Psychology a=
nd Sex Life" and=20

"Applied Psychology and Scientific cope with. It is not possible, no matter=
 how good the intentions=20

of the individuals concerned, that as valuable work can be done without mod=
ern methods as with=20

them. In these days, each charity of a city or town attempts to cover one f=
ield, and to cover it as=20

thoroughly and from as many different points of view as possible. Wherever =
possible, the aim of=20

such organizations is to help people to help themselves. The idea is not on=
ly to tide the=20

beneficiaries over temporary difficulties, but to aid them in building up c=
haracter by means of self-

respecting effort.  Membership in such organizations brings opportunity for=
 action and knowledge=20

also of the bearings of one=E2=80=99s action. It makes charity something mo=
re than a matter of sentimental=20

impulse. The opportunity to do good offered by these societies is not only =
an opportunity to help=20

the poor, but to help one=E2=80=99s self, and even in other ways than the o=
ne generally acknowledged of=20

broadening one=E2=80=99s sympathies and cultivating one=E2=80=99s=20


_
Living." He takes the practical side of Suggestion and points out its value=
 and usefulness. He=20

explains the limitations of Suggestion and deals in a different way with th=
e mental laws that control=20

this powerful factor for your success. No matter what thought you have give=
n to this interesting=20

subject--no matter how much you studied Suggestion, you will be surprised a=
nd delighted with the=20

concert with other women is of inestimable value. This discipline is someti=
mes accompanied by=20

vexations, as discipline commonly is, but, taken in the right spirit, it is=
 broadening.         *       *       *=20

*       *  Charitable societies are often made up largely of women whose id=
eas of business are=20

chaotic, whose capacity for speech is not at all equal to their capacity fo=
r work.=20


_
which Dr. Bush explains this mental phenomena.  This is a different angle o=
f Suggestion than in=20

either "Applied Psychology and Scientific Living" or "Practical Psychology =
and Sex Life." Also a=20

different angle than has been printed in the fifty-cent series by the same =
author under "The=20

Subconscious Mind." This pamphlet not only deals differently with the law o=
f Suggestion as=20

mentioned above, but it discussion at business meetings is wearing, but it =
is not altogether=20

unprofitable. The better trained women must do what they can to improve the=
 situation. When they=20

can not improve it, they must grin and bear it. Even with the drawbacks nam=
ed, organization pays.=20

The experience of many is a richer thing than the experience of one; and, w=
hen it comes to action,=20

concerted action is a more powerful=20
