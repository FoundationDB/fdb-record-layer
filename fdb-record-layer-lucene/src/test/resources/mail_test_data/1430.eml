new Bishop's first disciplinary acts was to summon the three vagrant priests to Ciudad Real, 

where he might constrain them to a more sacerdotal life under his immediate authority.  Las Casas 

lived according to the strict rule of his Order, eating only fish, eggs, and vegetables, and, though 

he permitted meat to the others who sat at his table, there was so little to tickle the palate of the 

epicure that two out of the three renounced allegiance to their Bishop and betook themselves 

beyond the confines of his diocese where they speedily fell into evil ways.  His life at this period 

was one of truly apostolic simplicity; although seventy years old, his habits were as frugal and 

austere as those of any anchorite.  Towards the Spanish colonists he at first  Then Nefert turned 

to a large group of the girls, who were sorting plants, and said: "Do you, children, know the origin 

of all these wholesome, healing herbs?  The good Horus went out to fight against Seth, the 

murderer of his father, and the horrible enemy wounded Horus in the eye in the struggle; but the 

son of Osiris conquered, for good always conquers evil.  But when Isis saw the bad wound, she 

pressed her son's head to her bosom, and her heart was as sad as that of any poor human mother 

that holds her suffering child in her arms.  And she thought: 'How easy it is to give wounds, and 

how hard it is to heal them!' and so she wept; one tear after another fell on the earth, and 

wherever they wetted the ground there sprang up a kindly healing plant."  "Isis

affectionate sentiments, which blinded them so entirely to the indomitable energy and fearless 

spirit that animated him, that they, on their part, showed themselves obsequious and generous. 

The deception was mutual, and disillusion only awaited the moment when the material interests of 

the Spaniards should be touched, to declare itself.  Slavery flourished throughout the diocese, to 

the great affliction of the Bishop: he first sought by private conversations with the principal persons 

of the colony, by arguments, explanation of the New Laws and of the Emperor's wishes, to effect 

the liberation of the Indians, but failing in this, he next preached publicly on the subject.  No 

headway was made by one or the other means employed, while shocking cruelties were of daily 

occurrence and the Indians, who recognised the Bishop as their only protector and advocate, 

brought him tales of their sufferings which left him no choice but to have recourse to stronger 

measures.  The Easter loves children when they are good."  "Your mother is right," replied Nefert. 

"Isis herself has her dear little son Horus; and every human being that dies, and that was good, 

becomes a child again, and the Goddess makes it her own, and takes it to her breast, and nurses 

it with her sister Nephthys till he grows up and can fight for his father."  Nefert observed that while 

she spoke one of the women was crying.  She went up to her, and learned that her husband and 

her son were both dead, the former in Syria, and the latter after his return to Egypt.  "Poor soul!" 

said Nefert.  "Now you will be very careful, that the wounds of others may be healed.  I will tell you 

something more about Isis.  She loved her husband Osiris dearly, as you did your dead husband, 

and I my husband Mena, but he fell a victim to the cunning of Seth, and she could not tell where to 

find the body that had been carried away, while you can visit your husband in his grave.  Then Isis

precept of confession, which marks the farthermost frontier of Catholic observance, within which 

even the most lax must remain under penalty of excommunication ipso facto, afforded the Bishop 

his opportunity. He withdrew from all his clergy, except the dean and canon of his cathedral 

church, their faculties for granting absolution, reserving to himself all questions fruitfulness from 

Osiris.  The sacred Nile was dried up, and not a blade of verdure was green on its banks.  The 

Goddess grieved over this beyond words, and one of her tears fell in the bed of the river, and 

immediately it began to rise.  You know, of course, that each inundation arises from a tear of Isis. 

Thus a widow's sorrow may bring blessing to millions of human
