condescended to admit that I had exceptionally good eyes. For that star, he=
 explained, was Alcor,=20

and Alcor was Arabic for "the proof," and for centuries and centuries the a=
bility to see that star had=20

been accepted as the proof of good vision.  Then did not understand. It doe=

work of Adam Smith, or any work upon political economy, currency, or any fi=

into the hands of the student who was destined to conduct the most tremendo=

of the first and second magnitude, and pointed out Sirius, in whose honor g=
reat temples had once=20

been built in Egypt, and Arcturus, the same old Arcturus that a Hebrew poet=
 by the name of Job=20

had sung about, and Vega and Capella and Rigel, which he said sent out eigh=
t thousand times=20

more light than our sun, and is at least thirty-four thousand times as big.=
  But it only made me=20

dizzy and staggered my mind. I war. Black Hawk was an Indian Chief of great=
 craft and power,=20

and, apparently, of fine character, who had the effrontery to object to bei=
ng improved off the face=20

of creation, an offence which he aggravated by an hereditary attachment to =
the British. At a muster=20

of the Sangamon company at Clary's Grove, Lincoln was elected captain. The =
election was a=20

proof of his popularity, but he found it rather hard to=20


_
the distances he was talking about. I just couldn't make it, any more than =
a bronco that had been=20

used to jumping a six-barred gate could vault over a windmill tower. And I =
had to tell Gershom that=20

it didn't do a bit of good informing me that Sirius was comparatively close=
 to us, as it stood only=20

nine light-years away. I remembered how he had explained that light travels=
 one hundred and=20

eighty-six thousand miles a second, and that there are thirty million secon=
ds in a year, so that a=20

light-year is about five and a half million million of miles. But when he s=
tarted to tell me that some=20

of the so-called photographic stars are thirty-two thousand light-years awa=
y from us my=20

imagination just curled up and died. It didn't mean constituents in the fie=
ld. One morning on the=20

march the Captain commanded his orderly to form the company for parade; but=
 when the orderly=20

called "parade," the men called "parade" too, but could not fall into line.=
 They had found their way=20

eave the company=20

behind. About ten o'clock the company set out to follow; but when it had ma=
rched two miles "the=20

drunken ones lay down and slept their drink off." Lincoln, who seems to hav=

st it was rather bewildering.=20

Then it grew into something touched with grandeur. Then it took on an aspec=

from that it grew into a sort of ghastliness, until the machinery of the mi=

enemy. Something like this was probably the state of things in the Northern=
 army at the beginning=20

of the civil war, before discipline had been enforced by disaster. The camp=
