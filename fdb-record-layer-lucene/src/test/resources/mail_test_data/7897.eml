equivalent to what is to be the perimeter at the bottom, and in it inscribe four equilateral triangles, 

at equal distances apart and touching the boundary line of the circle, as the astrologers do in a 

figure of the twelve signs of the zodiac, when they are making computations from drawing-room 

and thence into the dining-room. Dymov, with his waistcoat unbuttoned and no coat, was sitting at 

the table sharpening a knife on a fork; before him lay a grouse on a plate. As Olga Ivanovna went 

into the flat she was convinced that it was essential to hide everything

these triangles whose side is nearest to the scaena, let the front of the scaena be determined by 

the line where that side cuts off a segment of the circle (A-B), and draw, through the centre, a 

parallel line (C-D) set off from that position, to separate the platform of the stage from the space of 

the orchestra.  2. The platform has to be made deeper than that of the Greeks, because all our 

artists perform on the stage, while the orchestra contains the places reserved for the seats of 

senators. The height of this platform must be not more than five feet, in order that those who sit in 

the orchestra may be able to see the performances of all the actors. The sections (cunei) for 

spectators in the theatre should be so divided, that the angles of the triangles which run about the 

circumference of the circle may give the direction for the flights of steps between the sections, as 

far as up to the first curved cross-aisle. Above this, the upper sections are to be laid out, midway 

husband, and that she would have the strength and skill to do so; but now, when she saw his 

broad, mild, happy smile, and shining, joyful eyes, she felt that to deceive this man was as vile, as 

revolting, and as impossible and out of her power as to bear false witness, to steal, or to kill, and in 

a flash she resolved to tell him all that had happened. Letting him kiss and embrace her, she sank 

down on her knees before him and hid her face.  "What is it, what is it, little mother?" he asked 

tenderly. "Were you homesick?"  She raised her face, red with shame, and gazed at him with a 

guilty and imploring look, but fear and shame prevented her from telling him the truth.  "Nothing," 

she said; "it's just nothing...."  "Let us sit down," he said, raising her and seating her at the table. 

"That's right, eat the grouse. You are starving, poor darling."  She eagerly breathed in the 

atmosphere of home and ate the grouse, while he watched her with tenderness and laughed with 

delight.

with alternating passage-ways.  3. The angles at the bottom, which give the directions for the 

flights of steps, will be seven in number (C, E, F, G, H, I, D); the other five angles will determine 

the arrangement of the scene: thus, the angle in the middle ought to have the "royal door" (K) 

opposite to it; the angles to the right and left (L, M) will designate the position of the doors for 

guest chambers; and the two outermost  VI   Apparently, by the middle of the winter Dymov began 

to suspect that he was being deceived. As though his conscience was not clear, he could not look 

his wife straight in the face, did not smile with delight when he met her, and to avoid being left 

alone with her, he often brought in to dinner his colleague, Korostelev, a little close-cropped man 

with a wrinkled face, who kept buttoning and unbuttoning his reefer jacket with
