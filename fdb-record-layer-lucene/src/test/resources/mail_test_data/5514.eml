d _
ecclesiastical gesture, and his voice became a deep boom.  "6SN7, 6ac5, six=
 and seven millivolts=20

are running down the line, E equals R times A, that's the way it goes, go r=
ound the other way,=20

Subhas Chandra BOSE!"  Afterward, Mr. Rapp was never quite sure exactly wha=
t happened. He=20

had an impression of a flash of light, and an odd, indefinite sound rather =
like the dropping of a=20

cosmic garbage can lid. But possibly neither the light nor the sound actual=
ly happened; at any=20

rate, there were no complaints from the neighbors later on. However, the li=
ghted screen was=20

certainly doing something.  "Crazy!" the repairman said, in awed tones.  Mr=
. Rapp, his view partly=20

blocked by the repairman, could not see exactly what was happening on the s=
creen. However, he=20

caught a brief glimpse of the newscaster's face. It was right side up, but =
no longer smiling. Instead,=20

the pictured face wore a look of profound alarm, and the newsman was appare=
ntly leaning far=20

forward, his face almost out of focus because of its nearness to the lens. =
Just for a moment, Mr.=20

Rapp could have sworn he saw a chair floating _up_, past the agonized expre=
ssion on the screen.=20

Then the screen want gray, and a panel of lettering appeared, shaking sligh=
tly.  OUR PICTURE=20

HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED. NORMAL SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED AS=20

SOON AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE STAND BY.  "I was going to give you a bill," the r=
epairman said.=20

"Only maybe we better just charge it up to customer relations."  The letter=
s remained steady on=20

the screen, and Mr. Rapp studied them. They were right side up.  "You fixed=
 it," Mr. Rapp said, a=20

little uncertainly. "I mean, it's working. I ought to pay...."  "I goofed,"=
 the repairman said. He picked=20

up his tools, and moved toward the door. "Like, I won't mention it to anybo=
dy if you in from all=20

quarters. The American loss was only fourteen killed and forty-two wounded.=
  Just at the moment=20

when a turn in the affairs of the Northern Department became fully apparent=
, the two brigades=20

from the Highlands having arrived, and the militia fast pouring in, Schuyle=
r, much to his=20

mortification, was superseded by Gates on August 22d. He still remained, ho=
wever, at Albany, and=20

gave his assistance toward carrying on the campaign. The day after Gates as=
sumed the=20

command, Morgan arrived with his rifle corps, five hundred strong, to which=
 were presently added=20

two hundred and fifty picked men under Major Dearborn, of Scammell=E2=80=99=
s New Hampshire regiment.=20

The victory of Stark had a magical effect in reviving the spirits of the pe=
ople and the courage of the=20

soldiers. Indignation was also aroused by the cruelties reported of Burgoyn=
e=E2=80=99s Indian allies. A most=20

pathetic story was told of one Jenny McRea, murdered by Indians near Fort E=
dward. Her family=20

were Loyalists; she herself was engaged to be married to a Loyalist officer=
. She was dressed to=20

receive her lover, when a party of Indians burst into the house, carried of=
f the whole family to the=20

woods, and there murdered, scalped, and mangled them in the most horrible m=
anner. Such, at=20

least, was the story as told in a letter of remonstrance from Gates to Burg=
oyne. Burgoyne, in his=20

reply, gave, however, a different account. According to his version, the mu=
rder was committed by=20

two Indians sent by the young lady=E2=80=99s lover to conduct her for safet=
y to the British camp. They=20

quarrelled on the way respecting the division of the promised reward, and s=
ettled the dispute by=20

killing the girl. Even this correction hardly lessened the effect of the st=
ory or diminished the=20

detestation so naturally felt at the employment of such=20


_
goofed, all right. Didn't you see the picture?"  "But whatever you did ... =
it worked," Mr. Rapp said.=20

"The picture's right side up."  "I know," the repairman said. "Only somewhe=
re ... there's a studio=20

that's upside down. I just goofed, Pops, that's all."  He closed the door b=
ehind him, leaving Mr.=20

Rapp still staring at the immobile, right-side-up message on the glowing sc=
reen.  [Illustration]  The=20

displaying or  The artful Arnold, while on his march for the relief of Fort=
 Schuyler, had sent into St.=20

Leger=E2=80=99s camp a very exaggerated account of his numbers. The Indians=
, who had suffered severely=20

in the battle with Herkimer, and who had glutted their vengeance by the mur=
der of prisoners,=20

seized with a sudden panic, deserted in large numbers. On August 22d, two d=
ays before Arnold=E2=80=99s=20

arrival, St. Leger himself precipitately retired, leaving his tents standin=
g and the greater part of his=20

stores and baggage to fall into Arnold=E2=80=99s hands. On returning to Gat=
es=E2=80=99 camp, Arnold received the=20

command of the left wing.  These checks were not without their effect on th=
e Six Nations.=20

Burgoyne=E2=80=99s Indians began to desert him--an example which the Canadi=
ans soon followed. The=20

Onondagas and some of the Mohawks joined the Americans. Through the influen=
ce of the=20

missionary Kirkland, the Oneidas had all along been favorably disposed. It =
was only the more=20

western clans, the Cayugas, Tuscaroras, and Senecas, which adhered firmly d=
uring the war to the=20

British side.  The American army being now about six thousand strong, besid=
es detached parties=20

of militia under General Lincoln, which hung upon the British rear, Gates l=
eft his island camp, and=20

presently occupied Behmus=E2=80=99 Heights, a spur from the hills on the we=
st side of the Hudson, jutting=20

close upon the river. By untiring efforts, Burgoyne had brought forward thi=
rty days=E2=80=99 provisions, and,=20

having thrown a bridge of boats over the Hudson, he crossed to Saratoga. Wi=
th advanced parties=20

in front to repair the roads and bridges, his army slowly descended the Hud=
son--the Germans on=20

the left, by a road close along the river; the British, covered by light in=
fantry, provincials, and=20

Indians, by the high ground on the right.  Gates=E2=80=99 camp on the brow =
of Behmus=E2=80=99[90] Heights formed=20

a segment of a circle, convex toward the enemy. A deep intrenchment extende=
d to the river on the=20

right, covered not only by strong batteries, but by an abrupt and thickly w=
ooded ravine descending=20

to the river. From the head of this ravine, toward the left, the ground was=
 level and partially=20

cleared, some trees being felled and others girdled. The defences here cons=
isted of a breastwork=20

of logs. On the extreme left, a distance of three-quarters of a mile from t=
he river, was a knoll, a=20

little in the rear, crowned by strong batteries, and there was another batt=
ery to the left of the=20

centre. Between the two armies were two more deep ravines, both wooded. An =
alarm being given=20

about noon of September 19th that the enemy was approaching the left of the=
 encampment,=20

Morgan was sent forward with his riflemen. Having forced a picket, his men,=
 in the ardor of pursuit,=20

fell unexpectedly upon a strong British column, and were thrown into tempor=
ary confusion. Cilley=E2=80=99s=20

and Scammell=E2=80=99s New Hampshire regiments were ordered out to reinforc=
e him. Hale=E2=80=99s regiment of=20

New Hampshire, Van Courtlandt=E2=80=99s and Henry Livingston=E2=80=99s of N=
ew York, and two regiments of=20

Connecticut militia were successively led to the field, with orders to exte=
nd to the left and support=20

the points where they perceived the greatest pressure. About three o=E2=80=
=99clock the action became=20

general, and till nightfall the fire of musketry was incessant. The British=
 had four field-pieces; the=20

ground occupied by the Americans, a thick wood on the borders of an open fi=
eld, did not admit the=20

use of artillery. On the opposite side of this field, on a rising ground, i=
n a thin pine wood, the British=20

troops were drawn up. Whenever they advanced into the open field, the fire =
of the American=20

marksmen drove them back in disorder; but when the Americans followed into =
the open ground=20

the British would rally, charge, and force them to fall back. The field was=
 thus lost and won a=20



dozen times in the course of the day. At every charge the British artillery=
 fell into possession of the=20

Americans, but the ground would not allow them to carry off the pieces, nor=
 could they be kept=20

long enough to be turned on the enemy. Late in the afternoon, the British l=
eft being reinforced from=20

the German column, General Learned was ordered out with four regiments of M=
assachusetts and=20

another of New York. Something decisive might now have occurred, but the ap=
proach of night=20

broke off the contest, and the Americans withdrew to=20
