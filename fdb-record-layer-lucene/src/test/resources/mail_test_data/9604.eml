philodendron monstera and conversation of the friars, of which they seem never to have tired. Fray Luis now joined Las Casas at Rabinal, from whence he repeated his former visits to various places reconnoitring-expedition, and a victorious conclusion to every struggle in which the Mohar might engage.  The high-priest then pledged him, and thanked him emphatically in the philodendron monstera and conversation of the friars, of which they seem never to have tired.

commending the Emperor's condemnation of slavery in his American possessions. 

[Illustration: Paul III..]                                  Paul III.     From an engraving by Vincenzo Crispino 

after the portrait by Titian.   The satisfaction of Las Casas with this authoritative pronouncement 

from the supreme head of Christendom may be easily imagined, for it reads not unlike some of his 

own compositions.  He translated the Latin text into Spanish and supplied copies to all the signed 

to the one next to him to come a little nearer, the pioneer imagined that each would endeavor to 

avoid having him for his neighbor, and with an angry glance he turned his back on the table where 

the warriors sat.  The Mohar was not, in fact, a welcome boon-companion.  "The wine turns sour 

when that churl looks at it," said the general.  The eyes of all the guests turned on Paaker, who 

looked round for a seat, and when no one beckoned him to one he felt his blood begin to boil.  He 

would have liked to leave the banqueting hall at once with a swingeing curse.  He had indeed 

turned towards

those colonies, so that the decision and commands of the Pontiff might be perfectly understood by 

every one.  To one of his projects for civilising and converting the Indians more rapidly, the 

cacique was very reluctant to agree; this was that they should quit their semi-nomadic life and their 

custom of living in small scattered groups throughout the country, and come together in towns and 

villages.  They were so much attached to the independence and freedom of their mountains, that it 

was easier for the natives to renounce their religion, to which indeed they seemed to have little 

attachment, exchanged a few whispered words with Ameni, called to him, requested him to take 

the place that had been reserved for him, and pointed to the seat by his side, which had in fact 

been intended for the high-priest of the temple of Amon.  Paaker bowed low, and took the place of 

honor, hardly daring to look round the table, lest he should encounter looks of surprise or of 

mockery.  And yet he had pictured to himself his grandfather Assa, and his father, as somewhere 

near this place of honor, which had actually often enough been given up to them.  And was he not 

their descendant and heir?  Was not his

abandon the ancient customs of their race.  Their resistance to this innovation risked losing all that 

had been accomplished, for they were prepared rather to fight than to yield on this point.  By his 

quiet persistence, however, Las Casas succeeded in starting a village of one hundred houses at a 

place called Rabinal, whose familiar name he wisely refrained from changing, and little by little, 

even the natives of Coban, who were the least amenable, were attracted by the novelty, and came 

to inspect the new system, with which those who had adopted it were delighted, as they could Seti 

more indebted to him than to any one?  A servant laid a garland of flowers round his shoulders, 

and another handed him wine and food.  Then he raised his eyes, and met the bright and 

sparkling glance of Gagabu; he looked quickly down again at the table.  Then the Regent spoke to 

him, and turning to the other guests mentioned that Paaker was on the point of starting next day 

for Syria, and resuming his arduous labors as Mohar.  It seemed to Paaker that the Regent was 

excusing himself for having given him so high a place of honor.  Presently Ani raised his wine-cup, 

and drank
