done the work."  He ran from the shack to the place where the rock pile had been, and picked up 

several small fragments.  "Busted all to pieces!" exulted Tom Swift. "Not a piece left as big as a 

hickory nut. That's going some! I've got the right mixture at last. If an ounce did that, a few 

hundred pounds ought to knock that Andes tunnel through the mountain in no time. I'll telegraph to 

Mr. Titus."  Leaving Koku and Rad to collect the wires and firing apparatus, there being no danger 

now, as no explosive was left in the shack, Tom made his way back to the house. His father met 

him.  "Well, Tom," he asked, "another failure?"  "No, Dad! Success! This time I turned the trick. I 

seem to have gotten just the right mixture. Look, these are some of the pieces left from the big 

rock--one of the samples Mr. Titus sent me. It was all cracked up as small as this," and he held out 

the fragments he had picked up in the field.  Mr. Swift regarded them for a few moments.  "That's 

better, Tom," he said. "I didn't think you could get an explosive that would successfully shatter that 

hard rock, but Te Deum and reciting mass, the victors set out on {90} the return march.  They had 

burned the food of the Mohawks, who they knew must now feel the dread pangs of hunger. 

Terrible was the blow, and the Mohawks suffered much that winter.  Their pride was humbled.  By 

these means was a treaty of peace between the French and all the Iroquois declared, and for 

twenty years Canada enjoyed the sweets of peace.  Old Marquis de Tracy had done his work well, 

and could now go back to France with his resplendent bodyguard, his four pages, and his six 

valets, and leave Courcelle and Talon to rule Canada alone.  After this, when they went amongst 

the Iroquois, cross and breviary in hand, Jesuit missionaries met with no danger or refusal.  They 

made many converts.  Not content with their labours amongst the tribes close at hand, they 

pierced the distant forests north of Lake Superior, established permanent missions at 

Michilimackinac and Sault Ste. Marie, which joins the Lakes Huron and Michigan.  On the banks of 

the St. Lawrence a new era began.  For when the Carignan-Callires regiment was

to have done it. Have you the formula all worked out?"  "All worked out, Dad. I only made a small 

quantity, but the same proportions will hold good for the larger amounts.  I'm going to start in and 

make it now. And then--Ho! for Peru!"  Tom struck an attitude, such as some old discoverer might 

have assumed, and then he hurried into the house to telephone a telegram to the Shopton office. 

The message was to Mr. Titus, and read:   "Explosive success. Start making it at once. Ready for 

Peru in month's time."   "Thirteen words," repeated Tom, as the operator called them back to him. 

"I hope ploughshares, and the wise and prudent Intendant, Talon, had the satisfaction of seeing 

farms arise in the wilderness and yield abundant harvests.  Talon's hand was seen everywhere; 

he spared no pains to make Canada prosperous and self-supporting.  He set about establishing 

the fisheries in the St. Lawrence river and gulf, and encouraged the seal-hunts, by which much oil 

was obtained and exported to France.  He ordered the people to grow hemp, and taught the 

women to spin wool.  He also devoted much attention to the {91} timber trade, and to him is owing 

the first tannery seen in Canada.

The experiment which Tom Swift had just brought to a successful conclusion was one of many he 

had conducted, extending over several wearying weeks.  As soon as Tom had received the 

samples of the rock he had begun to experiment. First he tried some of the explosive that was so 

successful in the giant cannon. As he had feared, it was not what was needed. It cracked the rock, 

but did not disintegrate it, and that was what was needed.  The hard rock must be broken up into 

fragments that could be easily handled. Merely to crack it necessitated further explosions, which 

would only serve to split it more and perhaps wedge it fast in the tunnel.  So Tom tried different 

mixtures, using various chemicals, but none seemed to be just right. The trials were not without 

danger, either. Once, in mixing some ingredients, there was an explosion that injured one man, 

and blew Tom some distance away. Fortunately for him, there was an open window in the 

direction in which he was propelled, and he went through that, escaping with only some cuts and 

bruises.  Another time there was a hang-fire, and the explosive burned instead of detonating, so 

that one of the shops caught, and there was no little work in subduing the flames.  But Tom would 

not give up, and finally, after many trials, he hit on what he felt to be the right mixture. This he took 

out to the big lot, and having made a miniature tunnel with some of the sample rock, and having 

put some of the explosive in a hole bored in the big chunk Koku carried, Tom fired the charge. The 

result we have seen. It was a success.  A day after receiving Tom's message Mr. Titus came on 

and a demonstration was given of the By the year 1688 as many as 1100 vessels had in a single 

season anchored in the Quebec roadstead, laden with every kind of merchandise.  According to a 

letter written by one of the chief nuns, "M. Talon studied with the affection of a father how to 

succour the poor and cause the colony to grow; entered into the minutest particulars; visited the 

houses of the inhabitants and caused them to visit him; learned what crop each was raising; 

taught those who had wheat to sell it at a profit; helped those who had none, and encouraged 

everybody."  But in nothing were Talon's efforts so extraordinary to us as in his providing wives for 

the colonists of New France.  In his first few years of office 1200 girls were shipped out from 

France.  These French maidens were chosen from the country rather than from the city, strong 

and accustomed to work.  But there was also a consignment of "select young ladies" as wives for 

the officers.  When they arrived in Quebec or Montreal, the girls, tall and short, blonde or brunette, 

plump and lean, were gathered in a large building, and the young Canadian came and chose a 

wife to his liking.  A priest was in readiness, and they were married on the spot, in batches of thirty 

at a time.  Next day, we are told, the Governor caused the couple to be presented with an ox, a 

cow, a pair of swine, a pair of fowls, two barrels of salted meat, and eleven crowns in money. 

Besides this bounty, twenty livres were given to each youth who married before he was twenty 

years old, and to each girl who married before {92} sixteen.  All bachelors were heavily taxed.  To 

be unmarried was regarded by the Intendant and the King as a crime.  In 


_
"Tom, that's great!" cried the tunnel contractor. "Our troubles are at an end now."  But, had he 

known it, new ones were only just beginning.  Tom at once began preparations for making the 

explosive on a large scale, as much of it would be needed in the Andes tunnel. Then, having 

turned the manufacturing end of it over to his men, Tom began his preparations for going to Peru. 

Mr. Damon was also getting ready, and it was arranged that he, with Tom and Mr. Titus, should 

take a vessel from San Francisco, crossing the continent by train. The supply of explosive would 

follow them by special freight.  "We might have gone by Panama except for the slide in the canal," 

Tom said. "And I suppose I could take you across the continent in my airship, Mr. Titus, if you 

object to railroad travel."  "No, thank you, Tom. If it's just the same to you, I'd rather stay on the 

ground," the contractor said. "I'm more used to it."  A day or so before the start for San Francisco 

was to be made, Tom, passing a store in Shopton, saw something in the window he thought Mary 

Nestor would like. It was a mahogany work-box, of unique design, beautifully decorated, and Tom 

purchased it.  "Shall I have it sent?" asked the clerk.  "No, thank you," Tom answered.  He knew 

the young lady who had waited on him, and, for reasons of his own, he did not want her to know 

that Mary was to get the box.  Carrying the present to his laboratory, Tom prepared to wrap it up 

suitably to send to Mary, with a note. Just, however, as he was looking for a box suitable to 

contain the gift, he received a summons to the telephone. Mr. Titus, in New York, wanted to speak 

to him.  "Here, Rad!" Tom called. "Just box this up for me, like a good fellow, and then take it to 

Miss Nestor at this address; will you?" and Tom handed his man the addressed letter he had 

written to Mary. "Be careful of it," Tom cautioned.  "Oh, I'll be been said, the new settler was found 

by the King, sent over by the King, and supplied by the King with a wife, a farm, and even a house. 

Now amongst free-born Britons all this royal interference would have been resented.  Britons like 

to manage their own private affairs. They would call Louis the Fourteenth's system "paternalism," 

and in truth the system was a failure, because it discouraged the principle of independence.  No 

spirit of self-reliance was stimulated amongst the people.  They looked to the Government for 

everything, not to themselves.  The result was that many of the strongest and most self-reliant 

amongst the young men preferred to live a life of freedom and adventure in the wilderness, 

hunting, fishing, and trading, rather than suffer the constraints imposed upon them by the well-

meaning Talon.  Thus came about the creation of a famous class called the _coureurs de bois_, or 

bushrangers, who at last spread themselves all over Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, 

owning no laws but their own, living like Indians, taking unto themselves Indian wives, and rearing 

half-breed children.  Talon and all the Governors, Intendants, and Bishops were very angry with 

these men, who thus set the wishes of the good King at defiance, and made many laws against 

them.  But in vain!  The bushrangers, valorous, picturesque, and their companions, the 

_voyageurs_, continued to flourish almost until our own day.     {93}  CHAPTER VII  STRANGE 

DOINGS AT PORT ROYAL  We left the loyal, undaunted Charles de la Tour, whom his Huguenot 

father, Sir Claude, had tempted in vain to enter the English service, master once more of Port 

Royal in Acadia, and in high favour with King Louis the Thirteenth.  All Acadia as well as Canada 

was given back to the French by the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, and King Louis and his Court 

were now inclined to abandon their policy of indifference

careful."  And Eradicate was--all too careful.     Chapter VI  Mr. Nestor's Letter   "Got t' git a good 

strong box fo' dish yeah," murmured Eradicate, as he looked at the beautiful mahogany present 

Tom had turned over to him to take to Mary. "Mah Landy! Dat suttinly am nice; Ah! Um! Jest laik 

some ob de old mahogany furniture dat was in our fambily down Souf." Eradicate did not mean his 

family, exactly, but the one in which he had been a slave.  "Yassum, dat shore am nice!" he went 

on, talking to himself as he admired the present. "I shore got t' put dat in a good box! An' dish year 

note, too. Let's see what it done say on de outside."  Eradicate held the envelope carefully upside 

down, and read--or rather pretended to read--the name and address.  Eradicate knew well enough 

where 1632 a nephew of Richelieu's, Captain de Razilly, arrived in Acadia with a shipload of 

colonists, including artisans, farmers, several Capuchin friars, and some gentry.  Amongst the 

latter were Nicholas Denys and an extraordinary person, Charles de Menou, Chevalier de 

Charnisay.  The new Governor-General of Acadia was so struck by the natural beauties of La 

Heve that he fixed his residence there, in preference to Port Royal, which the Scotch had taken 

care to dismantle before sailing away.  Naturally young De la Tour was very jealous at Razilly's 

coming.  He thought the King ought to have appointed him Governor, instead of giving him the 

mere lordship over a limited territory.  {94} With Razilly's death in the following year De la Tour 

thought his chance had come.  But again his
