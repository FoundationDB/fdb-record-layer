which circumstance, perhaps, may be ascribed the fact that he left his dres=

razors loose during his stay at the cottage.  My man was moreover not afrai=

perhaps was fortunate. The window-catch was broken, and the lock of the doo=

that it would have kept no impudent dog or cat from entering, and it afford=

protection against intruding spirits.  One night, about a week after his ar=
rival at the cottage, he had=20

fallen into a sleep,--such a sleep as a man of his profession might be allo=

abruptly enough to produce a quiver or a twitch of skin or muscle,--when th=

  Her step excited the=20

wakefulness of my man as he lay with his face to the door. He gently opened=
 his eyes wide=20

enough to enable him to examine and measure the form of the nocturnal visit=
or, without permitting=20

her to notice the effect of her presence. He saw her glance round the room,=
 which the beams of=20

the moon lighted up sufficiently to exhibit the several articles on the toi=
let-table and elsewhere. My=20

man thought his interrupter's eyes fell upon the loose razors, and he avail=
ed himself of the=20

opportunity afforded by the turning of her face aslant from his bed to dise=
ngage his arms=20

somewhat from the bedclothes. He was now prepared to meet an attack upon hi=
m by her with his=20

own material weapons.  He had misunderstood the woman's object in visiting =
his bedchamber that=20

night.  She turned again in the direction of the bed. He now thought it pru=
dent to let her see that=20

she was noticed. He coolly raised himself up on his haunches, and fixed his=
 eyes upon her.  "What=20

do you want here?" he rather sternly inquired; and the words seemed to alar=
m her.  She replied, in=20

faltering accents and spasmodic sentences, "What? I want to see you. Why do=
 you look at me all=20

day? What do you mean by looking at me as you do? Do you mean to say that I=
 killed Willie? Say=20

any thing against me, and I will ruin you. Promise me you won't say any thi=
ng against me, or I will=20

scream out."  Then steadily glancing at him, she uttered what no doubt were=
 about the only words=20

she had intended to say, "If you don't promise me here, as you are sitting =
in that bed, that you=20

don't suspect me, that you won't say any thing against me, that you won't l=
ook at me as you do=20

and try to make people suspect me, I will cry out. I will say that you have=
 taken improper liberties=20

with me; that you have seduced me; that I have been awakened in my sleep by=
 conscience, and=20

am afraid of your other evil designs."  "Oh, you will, will you? And what t=
hen?"  "What then? Why,=20

mentioned the West India hurricane of 1839, which had, in the Antilles, a d=
iameter of three=20

hundred miles, which increased to five hundred at the Bermudas, and eight h=
undred on the=20

parallel of 50=C2=B0 north latitude.  To draw again upon the illustration o=
f the spinning top, it will be=20

observed that the curvilinear motion is extremely slow in comparison with t=
hat of rotation, but=20

increases as the rotation decreases. The same law applies to the movement o=
f cyclones. The=20

slowest motion forward is usually near the apex of the curve: and the progr=
ess on the ocean is=20

much slower than on the land. Traveling over the latter, the irregularities=
 of surface act in the case=20

of the storm just as a rough surface does in the case of the top. The motio=
n may be accelerated,=20

but its regularity is lessened. So while at sea the parabolic path of the s=
torm is almost absolutely=20

perfect, but on reaching the land its motion is more rapid, and less regula=
r, conforming somewhat=20



to the configuration of the surface.  To illustrate, take the great cyclone=
 of August 16th to 22nd,=20

1888. This started off Point Jupiter, Florida, with a rainfall of 2.2 inche=
s in twelve hours, while the=20

rotary velocity of the wind was sixty miles per hour. Its path across the G=
ulf of Mexico was a=20

perfect semi-parabola, curving northward into western Louisiana; but rapid =
as was the rotary=20

velocity, three and a half days were required for the journey across the gu=
lf. Meanwhile, it was=20

rapidly widening: for within a few hours of its reaching land, its eastern =
edge was assailing Mobile,=20

Alabama, with a south wind of fifty-five miles an hour. Almost at the same =
time the western half=20

was flooding Memphis and Vicksburg with an enormous rainfall--almost four i=
nches in twelve=20

hours, at Memphis. By the morning of August 21st, thirty-six hours after re=
aching land, it was=20

central over middle Tennessee and Kentucky; heavy rains fell over the entir=
e region. But by this=20

time its eastern edge was in collision with the Appalachian chain; while a =
heavy local rain at the=20

northern extremity of that chain created an additional diversion in a new a=
rea of low barometer. So=20

it left the hitherto parabolic route, and shot away nearly at a tangent alo=
ng the western=20

Appalachian slope, passing from Tennessee to Newfoundland in thirty-six hou=
rs, thus moving=20

nearly three times as rapidly as in the Gulf: while its violence, or rotary=
 speed, was vastly=20

lessened.  This storm was one of the most destructive of the recent cyclone=
s that have swept our=20

country, doing immense damage to crops, bridges, houses, herds--in short, e=
verything that can be=20

seriously damaged by wind or flood.  The damage in Louisiana alone was esti=
mated at $500,000.=20

But it was by no means the most destructive of the West India storms.  An e=
xamination of the=20

ded victim, I believe he=20

was so enamoured of the skill of this young woman that he might have offere=
d to take her into a=20

detective partnership, and set up in business with her in opposition to me.=
 But he saw his danger,=20

and did not like being made the object of an experiment with such very fata=
l incidents surrounding=20

it.  He seized her wrists with one hand, and with the other thrust her from=
 the bedside, placed his=20

hands in so doing over her lips, seized one of the razors lying on the tabl=

 hold a much=20
