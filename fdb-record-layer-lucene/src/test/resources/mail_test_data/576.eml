He was obviously saying all this in order to reassure himself, for there wa=
s no doubt that his fears=20

were on the alert. With a febrile gesture he unfastened the shutters, and p=
ushed them open,=20

peering out into the night.  "Hallo!" he called.  But he received no answer=
.  "It has started to rain,"=20

he said more calmly. "I imagine that lout has found shelter in an outhouse =
with the horses."  "Very=20

her with a sneer. "I=20

know them."  To this Martin-Roget vouchsafed no reply.  "How are things at =
Nantes?" he asked.=20

"Splendid! Carrier is like a wild beast let loose. The prisons are over-ful=

approach of the enemy had been announced to those nearest the scene of acti=
on by the women=20

and children of that part of the Settlement, who were seen running about in=
 frantic alarm trying to=20

hide themselves, and some of them seeking refuge in the fort.  Among these =
were two brothers=20

named Sinclair.  One of them, Archie by name, was a stout healthy fellow of=
 twelve or=20

thereabouts, the other was a thin delicate boy of ten, whose illness, whate=
ver it was, had reduced=20

him to skin and bone, taken all the colour out of his cheeks, and rendered =
him quite unable to run=20

or play like other boys.  They had recently become orphans, their father an=
d mother, who were=20

among the most recent arrivals, having died suddenly within a few weeks of =
each other.  When the=20

curtly.  "He began with a=20
