uld any evil report be spread abroad of them, some one of their subjects mi=

slay Lucifer,=E2=80=94and the assertion that he did so is deserving only of=
 derision; for the slaying of=20

Lucifer is nothing more than the deprivation of the Divine grace, and of th=
e sovereign glory of=20

paradise, whence he was cast out by God for his inordinate pride. O, my lor=
ds! in what book has=20

this advocate learned such theology? I am confounded at  The _examination o=
f the clothing of the=20

deceased_ is of great importance. As we have noticed before, a suicide gene=
rally opens them, a=20

murderer rarely. A suicide is often partly or even wholly undressed when he=
 inflicts the wound,=20

while murder is usually committed on those entirely dressed. The wound of t=
he clothes should=20

correspond to that of=20


_
which it can be found. On the contrary, we see in the epistle of St Jude, t=
hat St Michael dared not=20

to rail against Lucifer, although he had power over him, nor command him to=
 do any thing; but he=20

only said, =E2=80=98Our Lord commands thee;=E2=80=99 and thus it clearly ap=
pears, that the arguments which our=20

adversary has produced are no way applicable to his case, nor can they serv=
e to justify his=20

disloyal and treacherous act.  =E2=80=98I repeat, that such murders as the =
above, which our opponent has=20

brought forward, are not of any the body in case of murder. In suicide the =
wounds of the body and=20

of the clothes may not correspond, especially if there exists a motive to f=
alsely impute the crime.=20

The clothes of the deceased as well as those of the accused may indicate a =
struggle, as we have=20

already noticed. Of course, in regard to the clothes examined, it is necess=
ary to clearly prove that=20

they were worn at the time by the deceased or accused, otherwise serious mi=
stakes may be and=20

sometimes are made. In examining the blood-spots on the=20


_
have been suffered, that are mentioned in the Old Testament, which are now =
forbidden. As for=20

instance, Samuel, as a churchman, put to death the king Amalech,=E2=80=94bu=
t at this day it is not lawful=20

for a churchman to commit such crimes. To Moses was given the power of repu=
diation from the=20

marriage-vow, which is now forbidden. The doctrine, therefore, which is her=
e attempted, and the=20

examples quoted to palliate and even justify this atrocious crime, cannot b=
e patches or sprinkled=20

as by a spurting vessel or by continued violence.  The _body of the accused=
_ may present=20

scratches, marks of nails, contusions, bites, or other wounds indicative of=
 a struggle. It would be=20

well to ask the accused how he received the wounds or scars, to see if his =
explanations tally with=20

the injuries. It is hard to tell when wounds which have cicatrized were inf=
licted; we can only=20

distinguish between old and recent ones, and thus=20
