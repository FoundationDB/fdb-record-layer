Mr. Alving like red or white wine?  OSWALD. Both, if you please.  REGINA. _=

[She goes into the dining-room.]  OSWALD. I may as well help to uncork it. =
[He also goes into the=20

dining room, the door of which swings half open behind him.]  MRS. ALVING. =
[Who has opened=20

the parcel.] Yes, I thought so. Here is the 2d the Second Corps, at the hea=
d of which Gibbon had=20

taken Hancock=E2=80=99s place, and the Third Corps, Sickles, were at hand. =
At noon arrived the Fifth, and=20

soon after the Sixth, Sedgwick having marched his men thirty-four miles in =
eighteen hours.  Two=20

 extend at Gettysburg north=20

and south. The more westerly of these, called, from the Lutheran College th=

MRS. ALVING. Oh, you will get through it somehow.  MANDERS. [Softly, so as =
not to be heard in=20

the dining-room.] Yes; it would not do to provoke scandal.  MRS. ALVING. [U=
nder her breath, but=20

firmly.] No. But then this long, hateful comedy will be ended. From the day=
 after to-morrow, I shall=20

act in every way as though he who is dead had never lived in this house. Th=
ere shall be no one=20

here but my the main Confederate position. The eastern ridge, terminated at=
 its northern end by=20

the town cemetery, close to which Howard so fortunately stationed Steinwehr=
 on the first day,=20

became the Federal stronghold. Cemetery Ridge was really shaped like a fish=
hook, its line curving=20

eastward to the abrupt and wooded Culp=E2=80=99s Hill, the barb of the hook=
. At the curve the ridge was=20

steep and rough with ledges and bowlders; as it ran southward its height di=
minished until, after a=20

SWALD is heard laughing=20

and humming. A bottle is uncorked.]  MANDERS. [Agitated.] What can be the m=
