of dew, and we live entirely in the open air beneath the shade of a tree in=
 the day, and under a=20

roof of glittering stars at night. The guns never rust, although lying upon=
 the ground, and we are as=20

independent as the antelopes of the desert, any bush affording a home withi=
n its limit of shadow.=20

During the rainy season hunting and travelling would be equally impossible;=
 the rifles would=20

constantly miss fire. The mud is in most places knee-deep, and a malignant =
fever would shortly=20

settle the hunter. The rains cease early in September, after which we are t=
o expect a complete=20

vapour-bath until the end of October, by which time the fiery sun will have=
 evaporated the moisture=20

from the sodden earth; that interval will be the most unhealthy season.  "A=
s this fertile country can=20

depend upon three months' periodical rain, from the middle of June until Se=
ptember there is no=20

reason for unproductiveness; it would produce a large revenue if in industr=
ious hands.=20

"September 2.--For many days past we have seen large herds of giraffes and =
many antelopes on=20

the opposite side of the river, about two miles distant, on the borders of =
the Atbara, into which=20

valley the giraffes apparently dared not descend but remained on the table =
land, although the=20

antelopes appearmed to prefer the harder soil of the valley slopes. This da=
y a herd of twenty-eight=20

giraffes tantalized me by descending a short distance below the level flats=
, and I was tempted at=20

all hazards across the river. Accordingly preparations were immediately mad=
e for a start. The=20

sheik of the village and several of the Arabs were hippopotami hunters by p=
rofession; these=20

fellows could swim like otters, and, despite the crocodiles, they seemed as=
 much at home in the=20

water as on land. We prepared an impromptu raft. My angarep (bedstead) was =
quickly inverted;=20

six water-skins were inflated, and lashed, three on either side. A shallow =
packing-case, lined with=20

tin, containing my gun, was fastened in the centre of the angarep, and two =
tow-lines were attached=20

to the front part of the raft, by which swimmers were to draw it across the=
 river. Two men were to=20

hang on behind, and, if possible, keep it straight in the rapid current.  "=
The Arabs were full of=20

mettle, as their minds were fixed upon giraffe venison. A number of people,=
 including my wife,=20

climbed upon the mosquito platforms, to obtain a good view of the projected=
 hunt, and we quickly=20

carried our raft to the edge of the river. There was not much delay in the =
launch. I stepped=20

carefully into my coffin-shaped case, and squatted down, with a rifle on ei=
ther side, and my=20

ammunition at the bottom of the tin-lined water-proof case; thus, in case o=
f an upset, I was ready=20

for a swim. Off we went! The current, running at nearly five miles an hour,=
 carried us away at a=20

great pace, and the whirlpools caused us much trouble, as we several times =
waltzed round when=20

we should have preferred a straight course, but the towing swimmers being w=
ell mounted and=20

stately trees of his parks and pleasaunces seemed, at the same time, to soo=
the and gladden his=20

perturbed spirit. Muriel was still new to him, and there was much to examin=
e and explore for the=20

first time. He found a consolation also in the frequent remembrance that th=
ese scenes had been=20

known to those whom he loved. Often in the chamber, and often in the bower,=
 their forms arose;=20

sometimes their voices lingered in his ear; a frolic laugh, or whispered wo=
rds of kindness and=20

enjoyment. Such a place as Muriel should always be so peopled. But that is =
impossible. One=20

cannot always have the most agreeable people in the world assembled under o=
ne=E2=80=99s roof. And yet=20

the alternative should not be the loneliness he now experienced. The analyt=
ical Lothair resolved=20

that there was no happiness without sympathy.  The most trying time were th=
e evenings. A man=20

likes to be alone in the morning. He writes his letters and reads the newsp=
apers, attempts to=20

examine his steward=E2=80=99s accounts, and if he wants society can gossip =
with his stud-groom. But a=20



solitary evening in the country is gloomy, however brilliant the accessorie=
s. As Mr. Phoebus was=20

not present, Lothair violated the prime principles of a first-class Aryan e=
ducation, and ventured to=20

read a little. It is difficult to decide which is the most valuable compani=
on to a country eremite at=20

his nightly studies, the volume that keeps him awake or the one that sets h=
im a-slumbering.  At the=20

end of a week Lothair had some good sport on his moors=E2=80=94and this rem=
inded him of the excellent=20

Campian, who had received and answered his letter. The colonel, however, he=
ld out but a faint=20

prospect of returning at present to Europe, though, whenever he did, he pro=
mised to be the guest=20

of Lothair. Lothair asked some of his neighbors to dinner, and he made two =
large parties to=20

slaughter his grouse. They were grateful and he was popular, but =E2=80=9Cw=
e have not an idea in=20

common,=E2=80=9D thought Lothair, as, wearied and uninterested, he bade his=
 last guest his last good-

night. Then Lothair paid a visit to the lord-lieutenant, and stayed two nig=
hts at Agramont Castle.=20

Here he met many county notables, and =E2=80=9Cgreat was the company of the=
 preachers;=E2=80=9D but the talk=20

was local or ecclesiastical, and, after the high-spiced condiments of the c=
onversation to which he=20

was accustomed, the present discourse was insipid even to nausea. He sought=
 some relief in the=20

society of Lady Ida Alice, but she blushed when she spoke to him, and titte=
red when he replied to=20

her; and at last he found refuge in pretty Mrs. Ardenne, who concluded by a=
sking him for his=20

photograph.  On the morrow of his return to Muriel, the servant bringing in=
 his letters, he seized=20

one in the handwriting of Bertram, and, discarding the rest, devoured the c=
ommunication of his=20

friend, which was eventful.  It seems that the Phoebus family had returned =
to England, and were at=20

Brentham, and had been there a week. The family were delighted with them, a=
nd Euphrosyne was=20

an=20


_
ambatch-wood, swam across in fine style, and after some difficulty we arriv=
ed at the opposite=20

bank, and scrambled through thick bushes, upon our hands and knees, to the =
summit.  "For about=20

two miles' breadth on this side of the river the valley is rough broken gro=
und, full of gullies and=20

ravines sixty or seventy feet deep, beds of torrents, bare sandstone rocks,=
 bushy crags, fine=20

grassy knolls, and long strips of mimosa covert, forming a most perfect loc=
ality for shooting.  "I had=20

observed by the telescope that the giraffes were standing as usual upon an =
elevated position, from=20

whence they could keep a good look-out. I knew it would be useless to ascen=
d the slope direct, as=20

their long necks give these animals an advantage similar to that of the man=
 at the mast-head;=20

therefore, although we had the wind in our favour, we should have been obse=
rved. I therefore=20

determined to make a great circuit of about five miles, and thus to approac=
h them from above, with=20

the advantage of the broken ground for stalking. It was the perfection of u=
neven country: by=20

clambering broken cliff, wading shoulder-deep through muddy gullies, slidin=
g down the steep=20

ravines, and winding through narrow bottoms of high grass and mimosas for a=
bout two hours,=20

during which we disturbed many superb nellut (Ant. strepsiceros) and tetel =
(Ant. Bubalis), we at=20

length arrived at the point of the high table land upon the verge of which =
I had first noticed the=20

giraffes with the telescope. Almost immediately I distinguished the tall ne=
ck of one of these=20

splendid animals about half a mile distant upon my left, a little below the=
 table land; it was feeding=20

on the bushes, and I quickly discovered several others near the leader of t=
he herd. I was not far=20

enough advanced in the circuit that I had intended to bring me exactly abov=
e them, therefore I=20

turned sharp to my right, intending to make a short half circle, and to arr=
ive on the leeward side of=20

the herd, as I was now to windward: this I fortunately completed, but I had=
 marked a thick bush as=20

my point of cover, and upon arrival I found that the herd had fed down wind=
, and that I was within=20

two hundred yards of the great bull sentinel that, having moved from his fo=
rmer position, was now=20

standing directly before me. I lay down quietly behind the bush with my two=
 followers, and=20

anxiously watched the great leader, momentarily expecting that it would get=
 my wind. It was=20

shortly joined by two others, and I perceived the heads of several giraffes=
 lower down the incline,=20

that were now feeding on their way to the higher ground. The seroot fly was=
 teasing them, and I=20

remarked that several birds were fluttering about their heads, sometimes pe=
rching upon their=20

noses and catching the fly that attacked their nostrils, while the giraffes=
 appeared relieved by their=20

attentions: these were a peculiar species of bird that attacks the domestic=
 animals, and not only=20

relieves them of vermin, but eats into the flesh, and establishes dangerous=
 sores. A puff of wind=20

now gently fanned the back of my neck; it was cool and delightful, but no s=
ooner did I feel the=20

refreshing breeze than I knew it would convey our scent direct to the giraf=
fes. A few seconds=20

afterwards, the three grand obelisks threw their heads still higher in the =
air, and fixing their great=20

black eyes upon the spot from which the danger came, they remained as motio=
nless as though=20

carved from stone. From their great height they could see over the bush beh=
ind which we were=20

lying at some paces distant, and although I do not think they could disting=
uish us to be men, they=20

could see enough to convince them of hidden enemies.  "The attitude of fixe=
d attention and=20

surprise of the three giraffes was sufficient warning for the rest of the h=
erd, who immediately filed=20

up from the lower ground, and joined their comrades. All now halted, and ga=
zed steadfastly in our=20

direction, forming a superb tableau; their beautiful mottled skins glancing=
 like the summer coat of a=20

thoroughbred horse, the orange-coloured statues standing out in high relief=
 from a background of=20



dark-green mimosas.  "This beautiful picture soon changed; I knew that my c=
hance of a close shot=20

was hopeless, as they would presently make a rush, and be off; thus I deter=
mined to get the first=20

start. I had previously studied the ground, and I concluded that they would=
 push forward at right=20

angles with my position, as they had thus ascended the hill, and that, on r=
eaching the higher=20

ground, they would turn to the right, in order to reach an immense tract of=
 high grass, as level as a=20

billiard-table, from which no danger could approach them unobserved.  "I ac=
cordingly with a gentle=20

movement of my hand directed my people to follow me, and I made a sudden ru=
sh forward at full=20

speed. Off went the herd; shambling along at a tremendous pace, whisking th=
eir long tails above=20

their hind quarters, and taking exactly the direction I had anticipated, th=
ey offered me a shoulder=20

shot at a little within two hundred yards' distance. Unfortunately, I fell =
into a deep hole concealed=20

by the high grass, and by the time that I resumed the hunt they had increas=
ed their distance, but I=20

observed the leader turned sharp to the right, through some low mimosa bush=
, to make direct for=20

the open table land. I made a short cut oblquely at my best speed, and only=
 halted when I saw that=20

I should lose ground by altering my position. Stopping short, I was exactiy=
 opposite the herd as=20

they filed by me at right angles in full speed, within about a hundred and =
eighty yards. I had my old=20

Ceylon No. 10 double rifle, and I took a steady shot at a large dark-colour=
ed bull: the satisfactory=20

sound of the ball upon his hide was followed almost immediately by his blun=
dering forward for=20

about twenty yards, and falling heavily in the low bush. I heard the crack =
of the ball of my left-hand=20

barrel upon another fine beast, but no effects followed. Bacheet quickly ga=
ve me the single 2-

ounce Manton rifle, and I singled out a fine dark-coloured bull, who fell o=
n his knees to the shot,=20

but recovering, hobbled off disabled, apart from the herd, with a foreleg b=
roken just below the=20

shoulder. Reloading immediately, I ran up to the spot, where I found my fir=
st giraffe lying dead,=20

with the ball clean through both shoulders: the second was standing about o=
ne hundred paces=20

distant; upon my approach he attempted to move, but immediately fell, and w=
as despatched by my=20

eager Arabs. I followed the herd for about a mile to no purpose, through de=
ep clammy ground and=20

high grass, and I returned to our game.  "These were my first giraffes, and=
 I admired them as they=20

lay before me with a hunter's pride and satisfaction, but mingled with a fe=
eling of pity for such=20

beautiful and utterly helpless creatures. The giraffe, although from sixtee=
n to twenty feet in height,=20

is perfectly defenceless, and can only trust to the swiftness of its pace, =
and the extraordinary=20

power of vision, for its means of protection. The eye of this animal is the=
 most beautiful=20

exaggeration of that of the gazelle, while the colour of the reddish-orange=
 hide, mottled with darker=20

spots, changes the tints of the skin with the differing rays of light, acco=
rding to the muscular=20

movenment of the body. No one who has merely seen the giraffe in a cold cli=
mate can form the=20

least idea of its beauty in its native land. By the time that we had skinne=
d one of the aninmals, it=20

was nearly six o'clock, and it was necessary to hurry forward to reach the =
river before night; we=20

therefore arranged some thorny boughs over the bodies, to which we intended=
 to return on the=20

following morning.  "When about half-way to the river, as we were passing t=
hrough grass about=20

four feet high, three tetel bounded from a ravine, and, passing directly be=
fore us, gave me a=20

splendid shot at about sixty yards. The Ceylon No. 10 struck the foremost t=
hrough the shoulder,=20

and it fell dead after running a few yards. This was also my first tetel (A=
ntelopus Bubalis); it was in=20

splendid condition, the red coat was like satin, and the animal would weigh=
 about five hundred=20

pounds live weight.  "I had made very successful shots, having bagged three=
 out of four large=20



game; this perfectly delighted the Arabs, and was very satisfactory to myse=
lf, as I was quite aware=20

that my men would be only too willing to accompany me upon future excursion=
s.  "It was quite=20

dark before we reached the river; we had been much delayed by repeated fall=
s into deep holes,=20

and over hidden stones; thus I was well satisfied to find myself once more =
at home after having=20

crossed the river, in pitchy darkness, in a similar manner as before. Every=
 person in the village=20

had had a good view of the stalk; therefore, as two giraffes had been seen =
to fall, the Arabs were=20

waiting on the bank in expectation of meat.  "September 3.--This morning I =
crossed the river with=20

about twenty men, some swimming with inflated skins, and others supported b=
y logs of ambatch.=20

A number of swimmers were holding on to a pole to which four inflated girba=
s were attached; this=20

is an excellent plan for assisting soldiers to cross a river, as they can l=
and together in parties,=20

instead of singly, with their guns dry, should the opposite bank be occupie=
d by an enemy. I sat in=20

my gun-case, with the two rifles that I used yesterday, in addition to the =
little Fletcher; heaps of=20

clothes and sandals belonging to the swimmers formed my cargo; while, in ca=
se of accident, I had=20

taken off my belt and shoes, and tied my ammunition within an inflated skin=
. Neptune in his car=20

drawn by dolphins was not more completely at home than I in my gun-case, to=
wed by my fish-like=20

hippopotami hunters. After pirouetting in several strong whirlpools, during=
 which time a crowd of=20

women on the Sofi side of the river were screaming to Allah and the Prophet=
 to protect us from=20

crocodiles, we at length arrived.  "We took a direct course towards the ani=
mals I had shot on the=20

previous evening, meeting with no game except a large troop of dog-faced ba=
boons=20

(Cynocephali), until we reached the body of the tetel (Antelopus Bubalis), =
which lay undisturbed;=20

leaving people to flay it carefully, so that the skin should serve as a wat=
er or corn sack, we=20

continued our path towards the dead giraffes.  "I had not proceeded far, be=
fore I saw, at about a=20

mile distant, a motionless figure, as though carved from red granite; this =
I felt sure was a giraffe=20

acting as sentry for another party that was not yet in view; I therefore se=
nt my men on towards the=20

dead giraffes, while, accompanied by Florian's black servant Richarn,* who =
was a good=20

sportsman, and a couple of additional men, I endeavoured to stalk the giraf=
fe. It was impossible to=20

obtain a favourable wind, without exposing ourselves upon flat ground, wher=
e we should have=20

been immediately perceived; I therefore arranged that my men should make a =
long circuit and=20

drive the giraffe, while I would endeavour to intercept it. This plan faile=
d; but shortly after the=20

attempt, I observed a herd of about a hundred of these splendid creatures, =
browsing on the=20

mimosas about half a mile distant. For upwards of three hours I employed ev=
ery artifice to obtain a=20

shot, but to no purpose, as upon my approach to within a quarter of a mile,=
 they invariably chose=20

open ground, leaving a sentry posted behind the herd, while two or three ke=
pt a look-out well in=20

advance. No animal is so difficult to approach as the giraffe; however, by =
great patience and=20

caution, I succeeded in reaching a long and deep ravine, by which I hoped t=
o arrive within a close=20

shot, as many of the herd were standing upon the level table-ground, from w=
hich this natural=20

trench suddenly descended. I believe I should have arrived within fifty yar=
ds of the herd by this=20

admirable approach, had it not been for the unlucky chance that brought me =
vis-a-vis with two=20

tetel, that by galloping off attracted the attention of the giraffes. To ad=
d to my misfortune, after a=20

long and tedious crawl on hands and knees up the narrow amid steep extremit=
y of the gully, just=20

as I raised my head above the edge of the table land, expecting to see the =
giraffes within fifty=20

paces, I found three gazelles feeding within ten yards of me, while three m=
agnificent giraffes were=20



standing about a hundred and fifty yards distant.    * This faithful black,=
 a native of the White Nile=20

regions,     subsequently became my servant, and, for four years     accomp=
anied us honestly and=20

courageously through all     our difficulties to the Albert N'yanza.  "Off =
bounded the gazelles the=20

instant that we were perceived; they of course gave the alarm immediately, =
and away went the=20

giraffes; but I took a quick shot at the great leader as he turned to the r=
ight, and he staggered a=20

few paces and fell headlong into the bush. Hurrah for the Ceylon No. 10!--h=
owever, neither the=20

second barrel, nor a shot with the Manton 2-ounce, produced any effect. It =
was a glorious sight to=20

see the herd of upwards of a hundred of these superb animals close up at th=
e alarm of the shots,=20

and pelt away in a dense body through the dark green mimosa bush that hardl=
y reached to their=20

shoulders; but pursuit was useless. My giraffe was not quite dead, and, the=
 throat having been cut=20

by the Arabs and Richarn, we attempted to flay our game; this was simply im=
possible. The seroot=20

fly was in swarms about the carcase, thousands were buzzing about our ears =
and biting like bull-

dogs: the blood was streaming from our necks, and, as I wore no sleeves, my=
 naked arms=20

suffered terribly. I never saw such an extraordinary sight; although we had=
 killed our giraffe, we=20

could not take possession; it was no wonder that camels and all domestic an=
imals were killed by=20

this horrible plague, the only wonder was the possibility of wild animals r=
esisting the attack. The=20

long tails of the giraffes are admirable fly-whippers, but they would be of=
 little service against such=20

a determined and blood-thirsty enemy as the seroot. They were now like a sw=
arm of bees, and we=20

immediately made war upon the scourge, by lighting several fires within a f=
ew feet to windward of=20

the giraffe; when the sticks blazed briskly, we piled green grass upon the =
tops, and quickly=20

produced a smoke that vanquished the enemy.  "It was now about 3 P.M. and i=
ntensely hot; I had=20

been in constant exercise since 6 A.M., therefore I determined upon luncheo=
n under the shade of=20

a welcome mimosa upon which I had already hung my water-skin to cool. We cu=
t sonne long thin=20

strips of flesh from the giraffe, and lighted a fire of dry babanoose wood =
expressly for cooking.=20

This species of wood is exceedingly inflammable, and burns like a torch; it=
 is intensely hard, and in=20

colour and grain it is similar to lignum vitae. The festoons of giraffe fle=
sh were hung upon forked=20

sticks, driven into the ground to leeward of the fire, while others were si=
mply thrown upon the=20

embers by my men, who, while the food was roasting, employed themselves in =
skinning the=20

animal, and in eating the flesh raw. The meat was quickly roasted, and was =
the best I have ever=20

tasted, fully corroborating the praises I had frequently heard of giraffe m=
eat from the Arab hunters.=20

It would be natural to suppose that the long legs of this animal would furn=
ish the perfection of=20

marrow bones, but these are a disappointment, as the bones of the giraffe a=
re solid, like those of=20

the elephant and hippopotamus; the long tendons of the legs are exceedingly=
 prized by the Arabs=20

in lieu of thread for sewing leather, also for guitar strings.  "After lunc=
heon, I took my little Fletcher=20

rifle, and strolled down to the spot from whence I had fired the shot, as I=
 wished to measure the=20

distance, but no sooner had I arrived at the place than I observed at about=
 a quarter of a mile=20

below me, in the valley, a fine tetel; it was standing on the summit of one=
 of the numerous knolls,=20

evidently driven fronm the high grass by the flies. I stalked it very caref=
ully until I arrived within=20

about a hundred yards, and just as I reached the stem of a tree that I had =
resolved upon as my=20

covering-point, the tetel got my wind, and immediately bounded off, receivi=
ng the bullet in the right=20

hip at the same moment. After a few bounds it fell, and I ran forward to se=
cure it, but it suddenly=20

sprang to its feet, and went off at a surprising rate upon three legs. I be=
lieved I missed it, as I fired=20



a quick shot just as it disappeared in the thick bushes. Whistling for my p=
eople, I was now joined=20

by Bacheet and Richarn, my other men remaining with the giraffe. For about =
four miles we=20

followed on the track through the broken valley of the Atbara, during which=
 we several times=20

disturbed the tetel, but could not obtain a good shot, on account of the hi=
gh grass and thick=20

bushes. Several times I tried a snap shot, as for a moment I caught sight o=
f its red hide galloping=20

through the bush, but as it ran down wind I had no chance of getting close =
to my game. At length,=20

after following rapidly down a grassy ravine, I presently heard it pelting =
through the bushes; the=20

ravine made a bend to the right, therefore, by taking a short cut, I arrive=
d just in time to catch sight=20

of the tetel as it passed over an open space below me; this time the little=
 Fletcher bagged him. On=20

examination I found that I had struck it four times. I had fired five shots=
, but as three of those had=20

been fired almost at random, when the animal was in full speed through the =
bushes, one had=20

missed, and the others were badly placed.  "Fortunately this long hunt had =
been in the direction of=20

Sofi, to which we were near; still more fortunately, after we had marked th=
e spot, we shortly met=20

my first party of Arabs returning towards the village, heavily laden with g=
iraffe's flesh, and the hide=20

of one that I had killed yesterday. It appeared that during the night, lion=
s and hyaenas had=20

completely devoured one of the giraffes, not even leaving a vestige of skin=
 or bone, but the=20

immediate neighbourhood of the spot where it lay had been trampled into mud=
 by the savage=20

crowd who had left their footprints as witnesses to the robbery; the hide a=
nd bones had evidently=20

been dragged away piecemeal.  "On arrival at the river we were all busy in =
preparing for the=20

passage with so large a quantity of meat. The water-skins for the raft were=
 quickly inflated, and I=20

learnt from the Arabs an excellent contrivance for carrying a quantity of f=
lesh across a river,=20

without its becoming sodden. The skin of the tetel was nearly as capacious =
as that of an Alderney=20

cow; this had been drawn off in the usual manner, so as to form a sack. The=
 Arabs immediately=20

proceeded to tie up the neck like the mouth of a bag, and to secure the ape=
rtures at the knees in=20

like manner; when this operation was concluded, the skin became an immense =
sack, the mouth=20

being at the aperture left at the hind-quarters. The No. 10 bullet had gone=
 completely through the=20

shoulders of the tetel, thus the two holes in the hide required stopping; t=
his was dexterously=20

performed by inserting a stone into either hole, of a size so much larger t=
han the aperture, that it=20

was impossible to squeeze them through. These stones were inserted from the=
 inside of the sack;=20

they were then grasped by the hand from the outside, and pulled forward, wh=
ile a tight ligature=20

was made behind each stone, which effectually stopped the holes. The skin o=
f the tetel was thus=20

converted into a waterproof bag, into which was packed a quantity of flesh =
sufficient to fill two-

thirds of its capacity; the edges of the mouth were then carefully drawn to=
gether, and secured by=20

tying. Thus carefully packed, one of the foreleg ligatures was untied, and =
the whole skin was=20

inflated by blowing through the tube formed by the skin of the limb; the in=
flation completed, this=20

was suddenly twisted round and tied. The skin thus filled looked like an ex=
aggerated water-skin;=20

the power of flotation was so great, that about a dozen men hung on to the =
legs of the tetel, and to=20

each other's shoulders, when we launched it in the river. This plan is well=
 worthy of the attention of=20

military men; troops, when on service, are seldom without bullocks; in the =
absence of boats or=20

rafts, not only can the men be thus safely conveyed across the river, but t=
he ammunition can be=20

packed within the skins, wrapped up in straw, and will be kept perfectly dr=
y.  "The Arabs were=20

much afraid of crocodiles this night, as it was perfectly dark when we had =
completed our=20



preparations, and they feared that the snmell of so large a quantity of raw=
 flesh, more especially=20

the hide of the giraffe, which must be towed, would attract these beasts to=
 the party; accordingly I=20

fired several shots to alarm them, and the men plunged into the river, amid=
st the usual yelling of=20

the women on the opposite side. Fires had been lighted to direct us, and al=
l passed safely across.=20

"The sport upon the Abyssinian side of the river had been most satisfactory=
, and I resolved upon=20

the first opportunity to change my quarters, and to form an encampment upon=
 that bank of the=20

Atbara until the proper season should arrive for travelling. I had killed t=
hree giraffes and two tetel in=20

only two excursions. Florian, who was ill, had not been able to accompany m=
e; although he had=20

been shooting in this neighbourhood for two years he had never killed a gir=
affe. This want of=20

success was owing to the inferiority of his weapons, that were not adapted =
to correct shooting at a=20

range exceeding a hundred yards.  "On the following morning about fifty Ara=
bs crossed the river=20

with the intention of bringing the flesh of the giraffe, but they returned =
crestfallen in the evening, as=20

again the lions and hyaenas had been before them, and nothing was left. I t=
herefore resolved not=20

to shoot again until I should be settled in my new camp on the other side o=
f the river, as it was a=20

wasteful expenditure of these beautiful animals unless the flesh could be p=
reserved.  "The rainy=20

season was drawing to a close, and I longed to quit the dulness of Sofi.  "=
September 12.--The river=20

has fallen nearly eighteen feet, as the amount of rain has much decreased d=
uring the last week.=20

Immense crocodiles are now to be seen daily, basking upon the muddy banks. =
One monster in=20

particular, who is well known to the Arabs as having devoured a woman a few=
 months ago,=20

invariably sleeps upon a small island up the river.  "This evening I counte=
d seven elephants on the=20

east side of the river on the table lands.  "To-day the Arabs kept one of t=
heir holy feasts;=20

accordingly, a sheep was slaughtered as a sacrifice, with an accompaniment =
of music and singing,=20

i.e. howling to several guitars.  "The Arab system of an offering is peculi=
ar. Should a friend be=20

dangerously ill, or rain be demanded, or should any calamity befall them, t=
hey slaughter an ox if=20

they possess it, or a sheep or goat in the absence of a larger animal, but =
the owner of the beast=20

SELLS the meat in small portions to the assembled party, and the whole affa=
ir of sacrifice resolves=20

itself into a feast; thus having filled thenmselves with good meat, they fe=
el satisfied that they have=20

made a religious sacrifice, and they expect the beneficial results. The gui=
tar music and singing that=20

attend the occasion are simply abominable. Music, although beloved like dan=
cing by both the=20

savage and civilized, varies in character according to the civilization of =
the race; that which is=20

agreeable to the uneducated ear is discord to the refined nerves of the edu=
cated. The uutuned ear=20

of the savage can no more enjoy the tones of civilized music than his palat=
e would relish the=20

elaborate dishes of a French chef de cuisine. As the stomach of the Arab pr=
efers the raw meat=20

and reeking liver taken hot from the animal, so does his ear prefer his equ=
ally coarse and=20

discordant music to all other. The guitar most common is made of either the=
 shell of a large gourd,=20

or that of a turtle; over this is stretched an untanned skin, that of a lar=
ge fish being preferred;=20

through this two sticks are fixed about two feet three inches in length; th=
e ends of these are=20

fastened to a cross piece upon which are secured the strings; these are str=
etched over a bridge=20

similar to those of a violin, and are either tightened or relaxed by rings =
of waxed rag fastened upon=20

the cross piece--these rings are turned by the hand, and retain their posit=
ion in spite of the strain=20

upon the strings. Nothing delights an Arab more than to sit idly in his hut=
 and strum this wretched=20

instrument from morning until night."  I was thoroughly tired of Sofi, and =
I determined to move my=20



party across the river to camp on the uninhabited side; the rains had almos=
t ceased, therefore we=20

should be able to live in the tent at night, and to form a shady nook benea=
th some mimosas by=20

day; accordingly we busily prepared for a move.   CHAPTER IX.  FORM A RAFT =
WITH THE=20

SPONGING BATH.  ON the 15th September the entire male population of Sofi tu=
rned out to assist=20

us in crossing the river, as I had promised them a certain sum should the m=
ove be effected without=20

the loss or destruction of baggage. I had arranged a very superior raft to =
that I had formerly used,=20

as I now had eight inflated skins attached to the bedstead, upon which I la=
shed our large circular=20

sponging bath, which, being three feet eight inches in diameter, and of the=
 best description, would=20

be perfectly safe for my wife, and dry and commodious for the luggage. In a=
 very short time the=20

whole of our effects were carried to the water's edge, and the passage of t=
he river commenced.=20

The rifles were the first to cross with Bacheet, while the water-tight iron=
 box that contained the=20

gunpowder was towed like a pinnace behind the raft. Four hippopotami hunter=
s were harnessed=20

as tug steamers, while a change of swimmers waited to relieve them every al=
ternate voyage. The=20

raft answered admirably, and would easily support about three hundred pound=
s. The power of=20

flotation of the sponging bath alone I had proved would support a hundred a=
nd ninety pounds, thus=20

the only danger in crossing was the chance of a crocodile making a dash eit=
her at the inflated=20

skins in mistake for the body of a man, or at the swimmers themselves. All =
the usual necessaries=20

were safely transported, with the tents and personal baggage, before I cros=
sed myself, with a=20

number of Arabs. We quickly cleared the grass from the hard pebbly soil of =
a beautiful plateau on=20

the summit of a craggy sandstone cliff, about eighty feet above the river; =
here we pitched the=20

tents, close to some mimosas of dense foliage, and all being in order, I we=
nt down to the river to=20

receive the next arrival. My wife now came across the ferry, and so perfect=
ly had this means of=20

transport succeeded, that by the evening, the whole of our stores and bagga=
ge had been=20

delivered without the slightest damage, with the exception of a very heavy =
load of corn, that had=20

caused the sponging bath to ship a sea during a strong squall of wind. The =
only person who had=20

shown the least nervousness in trusting his precious body to my ferry-boat =
was Mahomet the=20

dragoman, who, having been simply accustomed to the grand vessels of the Ni=
le, was not=20

prepared to risk himself in a voyage across the Atbara in a sponging bath. =
He put off the=20

desperate attempt until the last moment, when every other person of my part=
y had crossed; I=20

believe he hoped that a wreck would take place before his turn should arriv=
e, and thus spare him=20

the painful necessity, but when at length the awful moment arrived, he was =
assisted carefully imito=20

the bath by his servant Achmet and a number of Arabs, all of whom were deli=
ghted at his=20

imbecility. Perched nervously in the centre of the bath, and holding on tig=
ht by either side, he was=20

towed across with his travelling bag of clothes, while Achmet remained in c=
harge of his best=20

clothes and sundry other personal effects, that were to form the last cargo=
 across the ferry. It=20

appeared that Achmet, the dearly beloved and affectionate relative of Mahom=
et, who had engaged=20

to serve him for simple love instead of money, was suddenly tempted by Sata=
n, and seeing that=20

Mahomet and the entire party were divided from him and the property in his =
charge, by a river two=20

hundred yards wide, about forty feet deep, with a powerful current, he made=
 up his mind to bolt=20

with the valuables; therefore while Mahomet, in a nervous state in the ferr=
y-bath, was being towed=20

towards the east, Achmet turned in another direction and fled towards the w=
est. Mahomet having=20

been much frightened by the nautical effort he had been forced to make, was=
 in an exceedingly=20



bad temper upon the arrival on the opposite bank, and having at length succ=
eeded in climbing up=20

the steep ascent, in shoes that were about four sizes too large for him, he=
 arrived on the lofty=20

plateau of our camp, and doubtless would like ourselves have been charmed w=
ith the view of the=20

noble river rushing between the cliffs of white sandstone, had he only seen=
 Achmet his fond=20

relative with his effects on the opposite bank. Mahomet strained his eyes, =
but the blank was no=20

optical delusion; neither Achmet nor his effects were there. The Arabs, who=
 hated the unfortunate=20

Mahomet for his general overbearing conduct, now comforted him with the sug=
gestion that Achmet=20

had run away, and that his only chance was to re-cross the river and give c=
hase. Mahomet would=20

not have ventured upon another voyage to the other side and back again, for=
 the world, and as to=20

giving chase in boots (highlows) four sizes too big, and without strings, t=
hat would have been as=20

absurd as to employ a donkey to catch a horse. Mahomet could do nothing but=
 rush frantically to=20

the very edge of the cliff, and scream and gesticulate to a crowd of Arab w=
omen who had passed=20

the day beneath the shady trees by the Faky's grave, watching our passage o=
f the Atbara. Beating=20

his own head and tearing his hair were always the safety valves of Mahomet'=
s rage, but as hair is=20

not of that mushroom growth that reappears in a night, he had patches upon =
his cranium as bald=20

as a pumpkin shell, from the constant plucking, attendant upon losses of te=
mper; he now not only=20

tore a few extra locks from his head, but he shouted out a tirade of abuse =
towards the far-distant=20

Achmet, calling him a "son of a dog," cursing his father, and paying a few =
compliments to the=20

memory of his mother, which if only half were founded upon fact were sad bl=
ots upon the morality=20

of the family to which Mahomet himself belonged, through his close relation=
ship to Achmet, whom=20

he had declared to be his mother's brother's cousin's sister's mother's son=
.  A heavy shower of=20

rain fell shortly after our camp was completed, when fortunately the baggag=
e was under cover; this=20

proved to be the last rain of the season, and from that moment the burning =
sun ruled the sodden=20

country, and rapidly dried up not only the soil but all vegetation. The gra=
ss within a few days of the=20

cessation of the rain assumed a tinge of yellow, and by the end of October =
there was not a green=20

spot to relieve the eye from the golden blaze of the landscape, except the =
patches of grass and=20

reeds that sprang from the mud banks of the retiring river. The climate was=
 exceedingly unhealthy,=20

but we were fortunately exceptions to the general rule, and although the in=
habitants of Sofi were=20

all sufferers, our camp had no invalids, with the exception of Mahomet, who=
 had upon one=20

occasion so gorged himself with half-putrid fish, that he nearly died in co=
nsequence. It would be=20

impossible to commence our explorations in the Base until the grass should =
be sufficiently dry to=20

burn; there were two varieties: that upon the slopes and hollows of the sto=
ny soil of the Atbara=20

valley had been a pest ever since it had ripened; as the head formed three =
barbed darts, these=20

detached themselves from the plant with such facility, that the slightest t=
ouch was sufficient to=20

dislodge them; they immediately pierced the clothes, from which they could =
not be withdrawn, as=20

the barbed heads broke off and remained. It was simply impossible to walk i=
n this grass as it=20

became ripe, without special protection; I accordingly tanned some gazelle =
skins, with which my=20

wife constructed stocking gaiters, to be drawn over the foot and tied above=
 and below the knee;=20

thus fortified I could defy the grass, and indulge in shooting and explorin=
g the neighbourhood until=20

the season should arrive for firing the country. The high grass upon the ta=
ble lands, although=20

yellow, would not be sufficiently inflammable until the end of November.  T=
he numerous=20

watercourses that drained the table lands during the rainy season were now =
dry. No sooner had=20



the grass turned yellow, than the pest of the country, the seroot fly, disa=
ppeared; thus the=20

presence of this insect may be dated from about 10th July to 10th October. =
As the fly vanished,=20

the giraffes also left the neighbourhood. By a few days' exploration, I fou=
nd that the point of land=20

from the junction of the Settite river with the Atbara, formed a narrow pen=
insula which was no=20

wider than eight miles across from our encampment: thus the herds of game r=
etreating from the=20

south before the attacks of the seroot, found themselves driven into a cut-=
de-sac upon the strip of=20

land between the broad and deep rivers the Settite and Atbara, which in the=
 rainy season they=20

dared not cross. All this country being uninhabited, there were several var=
ieties of game at all=20

seasons, but the three rainy months insure a good supply of elephants and g=
iraffes; these retreat=20

about thirty miles farther south, when permitted by the cessation of the fl=
ies to return to their=20

favourite haunts.  My camp was in a very commanding position, as seems that=
 Mr. Cantacuzene=20

had been down to Brentham, and stayed, which he never did anywhere, a coupl=
e of days. And the=20

duke was particularly charmed with Mr. Cantacuzene. This gentleman, who was=
 only in the earlier=20

term of middle age, and looked younger than his age, was distinguished in a=
ppearance, highly=20

polished, and singularly acute. He appeared to be the master of great wealt=
h, for he offered to=20

make upon Euphrosyne any settlement which the duke desired. He had no son, =
and did not wish=20

his sons-in-law to be sighing for his death. He wished his daughters, there=
fore, to enjoy the bulk of=20

their inheritances in his lifetime. He told the duke that he had placed one=
 hundred thousand=20

pounds in the names of trustees on the marriage of Madame Phoebus, to accum=
ulate, =E2=80=9Cand when=20

the genius and vanity of her husband are both exhausted, though I believe t=
hey are inexhaustible,=E2=80=9D=20

remarked Mr. Cantacuzene, =E2=80=9Cit will be a nest=E2=80=99s-egg for them=
 to fall back upon, and at least save=20

them from penury.=E2=80=9D The duke had no doubt that Mr. Cantacuzene was o=
f imperial lineage. But the=20

latter portion of the letter was the most deeply interesting to Lothair. Be=
rtram wrote that his mother=20

had just observed that she thought the Phoebus family would like to meet Lo=
thair, and begged=20

Bertram to invite him to Brentham. The letter ended by an urgent request, t=
hat, if disengaged, he=20

should arrive immediately.  Mr. Phoebus highly approved of Brentham. All wa=
s art, and art of a=20

high character. He knew no residence with an aspect so thoroughly Aryan. Th=
ough it was really a=20

family party, the house was quite full; at least, as Bertram said to Lothai=
r on his arrival, =E2=80=9Cthere is=20

only room for you=E2=80=94and you are in your old quarters.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThat is exactly what I wished,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.=20

He had to escort the duchess to dinner. Her manner was of old days. =E2=80=
=9CI thought you would like to=20

meet your friends,=E2=80=9D she said.  =E2=80=9CIt gives me much pleasure, =
but much more to find myself at=20

Brentham.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere seems every prospect of Bertram being ha=
ppy. We are enchanted with the=20

young lady. You know her, I believe, well? The duke is highly pleased with =
her father, Mr.=20

Cantacuzene=E2=80=94he says one of the most sensible men he ever met, and a=
 thorough gentleman,=20

which he may well be, for I believe there is no doubt he is of the highest =
descent=E2=80=94emperors they=20

say, princes even now. I wish you could have met him, but he would only sta=
y eight-and-forty=20

hours. I understand his affairs are vast.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have always =
heard a considerable person; quite the=20

head of the Greek community in this country=E2=80=94indeed, in Europe gener=
ally.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI see by the morning=20

papers that Miss Arundel has taken the veil.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI missed my=
 papers to-day,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, a little=20

agitated, =E2=80=9Cbut I have long been aware of her intention of doing so.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLady St. Jerome will miss her=20

very much. She was quite the soul of the house.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt must =
be a great and painful sacrifice,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut, I believe, long meditated. I remember when I was at =
Vauxe, nearly two years ago,=20



that I was told this was to be her fate. She was quite determined on it.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI saw the beautiful crucifix=20

you gave her, at Mr. Ruby=E2=80=99s.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was an homage to=
 her for her great goodness to me when I was=20

ill at Rome=E2=80=94and it was difficult to find any thing that would pleas=
e or suit her. I fixed on the=20

crucifix, because it permitted me to transfer to it the earth of the holy p=
laces, which were included=20

in the crucifix, that was given to me by the monks of the Holy Sepulchre, w=
hen I made my=20

pilgrimage to Jerusalem.=E2=80=9D  In the evening St. Aldegonde insisted on=
 their dancing, and he engaged=20

himself to Madame Phoebus. Bertram and Euphrosyne seemed never separated; L=
othair was=20

successful in inducing Lady Corisande to be his partner.  =E2=80=9CDo you r=
emember your first ball at=20

Crecy House?=E2=80=9D asked Lothair. =E2=80=9CYou are not nervous now?=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI would hardly say that,=E2=80=9D said Lady=20

Corisande, =E2=80=9Cthough I try not to show it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was =
the first ball for both of us,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CI have not=
=20

danced so much in the interval as you have. Do you know, I was thinking, ju=
st now, I have danced=20

oftener with you than with any one else?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre not you gla=
d about Bertram=E2=80=99s affair ending so=20

well?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery; he will be a happy man. Every body is happy,=
 I think, except myself.=E2=80=9D  In the course=20

of the evening, Lady St. Aldegonde, on the arm of Lord Montairy, stopped fo=
r a moment as she=20

passed Lothair, and said: =E2=80=9CDo you remember our conversation at Lord=
 Culloden=E2=80=99s breakfast? Who=20

was right about mamma?=E2=80=9D  They passed their long summer days in ramb=
ling and riding, and in=20

wondrous new games which they played in the hall. The striking feature, how=
ever, were the=20

matches at battledore and shuttlecock between Madame Phoebus and Lord St. A=
ldegonde, in=20

which the skill and energy displayed were supernatural, and led to betting.=
 The evenings were=20

always gay; sometimes they danced; more or less they always had some delici=
ous singing. And=20

Mr. Phoebus arranged some tableaux most successfully.  All this time, Lotha=
ir hung much about=20

Lady Corisande; he was by her side in the riding-parties, always very near =
her when they walked,=20

and sometimes he managed unconsciously to detach her from the main party, a=
nd they almost=20

walked alone. If he could not sit by her at dinner, he joined her immediate=
ly afterward, and=20

whether it were a dance, a tableau, or a new game, somehow or other he seem=
ed always to be=20

her companion.  It was about a week after the arrival of Lothair, and they =
were at breakfast at=20

Brentham, in that bright room full of little round tables which Lothair alw=
ays admired, looking, as it=20

did, upon a garden of many colors.  =E2=80=9CHow I hate modern gardens!=E2=
=80=9D said St. Aldegonde. =E2=80=9CWhat a=20

horrid thing this is! One might as well have a mosaic pavement there. Give =
me cabbage-roses,=20

sweet-peas, and wall-flowers. That is my idea of a garden. Corisande=E2=80=
=99s garden is the only sensible=20

thing of the sort.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COne likes a mosaic pavement to look l=
ike a garden,=E2=80=9D said Euphrosyne, =E2=80=9Cbut not=20

a garden like a mosaic pavement.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe worst of these mosa=
ic beds,=E2=80=9D said Madame Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cis,=20

you can never get a nosegay, and if it were not for the kitchen-garden, we =
should be destitute of=20

that gayest and sweetest of creations.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCorisande=E2=80=
=99s garden is, since your first visit to Brentham,=E2=80=9D=20

said the duchess to Lothair. =E2=80=9CNo flowers are admitted that have not=
 perfume. It is very old-

fashioned. You must get her to show it you.=E2=80=9D  It was agreed that af=
ter breakfast they should go and=20

see Corisande=E2=80=99s garden. And a party did go=E2=80=94all the Phoebus =
family, and Lord and Lady St.=20

Aldegonde, and Lady Corisande, and Bertram, and Lothair.  In the pleasure-g=
rounds of Brentham=20

were the remains of an ancient garden of the ancient house that had long ag=
o been pulled down.=20

When the modern pleasure-grounds were planned and created, notwithstanding =
the protests of=20

the artists in landscape, the father of the present duke would not allow th=
is ancient garden to be=20

entirely destroyed, and you came upon its quaint appearance in the dissimil=
ar world in which it=20



was placed, as you might in some festival of romantic costume upon a person=
 habited in the=20

courtly dress of the last century. It was formed upon a gentle southern slo=
pe, with turfen terraces=20

walled in on three sides, the fourth consisting of arches of golden yew. Th=
e duke had given this=20

garden to Lady Corisande, in order that she might practise her theory, that=
 flower-gardens should=20

be sweet and luxuriant, and not hard and scentless imitations of works of a=
rt. Here, in their=20

season, flourished abundantly all those productions of Nature which are now=
 banished from our=20

once delighted senses; huge bushes of honey-suckle, and bowers of sweet-pea=
 and sweet-brier,=20

and jessamine clustering over the walls, and gillyflowers scenting with the=
ir sweet breath the=20

ancient bricks from which they seemed to spring. There were banks of violet=
s which the southern=20

breeze always stirred, and mignonette filled every vacant nook. As they ent=
ered now, it seemed a=20

blaze of roses and carnations, though one recognized in a moment the presen=
ce of the lily, the=20

heliotrope, and the stock. Some white peacocks were basking on the southern=
 wall, and one of=20

them, as their visitors entered, moved and displayed its plumage with scorn=
ful pride. The bees=20

were busy in the air, but their homes were near, and you might watch them l=
aboring in their glassy=20

hives.  =E2=80=9CNow, is not Corisande quite right?=E2=80=9D said Lord St. =
Aldegonde, as he presented Madame=20

Phoebus with a garland of woodbine, with which she said she would dress her=
 head at dinner. All=20

agreed with him, and Bertram and Euphrosyne adorned each other with carnati=
ons, and Mr.=20

Phoebus placed a flower on the uncovered head of Lady St. Aldegonde, accord=
ing to the=20

principles of high art, and they sauntered and rambled in the sweet and sun=
ny air amid a blaze of=20

butterflies and the ceaseless hum of bees.  Bertram and Euphrosyne had disa=
ppeared; and the=20

rest were lingering about the hives while Mr. Phoebus gave them a lecture o=
n the apiary and its=20

marvellous life. The bees understood Mr. Phoebus, at least he said so, and =
thus his friends had=20

considerable advantage in this lesson in entomology. Lady Corisande and Lot=
hair were in a distant=20

corner of the garden, and she was explaining to him her plans; what she had=
 done and what she=20

meant to do.  =E2=80=9CI wish I had a garden like this at Muriel,=E2=80=9D =
said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYou could easily make one.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CIf you helped me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have told you all my plans,=
=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande.  =E2=80=9CYes; but I was thinking of=20

something else when you spoke,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThat was no=
t very complimentary.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not wish=20

to be complimentary,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cif compliments mean le=
ss than they declare. I was not thinking=20

of your garden, but of you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhere can they have all gone=
?=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande, looking round.=20

=E2=80=9CWe must find them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd leave this garden?=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CAnd I without a flower, the only one=20

without a flower? I am afraid that is significant of my lot.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CYou shall choose a rose,=E2=80=9D said Lady=20

Corisande.  =E2=80=9CNay; the charm is, that it should be your choice.=E2=
=80=9D  But choosing the rose lost more=20

times and, when Corisande and Lothair reached the arches of golden yew, the=
re were no friends=20

in sight.  =E2=80=9CI think I hear sounds this way,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =
and he led his companion farther from=20

home.  =E2=80=9CI see no one,=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande, distressed, and=
 when they had advanced a little way.=20

=E2=80=9CWe are sure to find them in good time,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=
=80=9CBesides, I wanted to speak to you about the=20

garden at Muriel. I wanted to induce you to go there and help me to make it=
. Yes,=E2=80=9D he added, after=20

some hesitation, =E2=80=9Con this spot=E2=80=94I believe on this very spot=
=E2=80=94I asked the permission of your mother=20

two years ago to express to you my love. She thought me a boy, and she trea=
ted me as a boy.=20

She said I knew nothing of the world, and both our characters were unformed=
. I know the world=20

now. I have committed many mistakes, doubtless many follies=E2=80=94have fo=
rmed many opinions, and=20

have changed many opinions; but to one I have been constant, in one I am un=
changed=E2=80=94and that=20



is my adoring love to you.=E2=80=9D  She turned pale, she stopped, then, ge=
ntly taking his arm, she hid her=20

face in his breast.  He soothed and sustained her agitated frame, and seale=
d with an embrace her=20

speechless form. Then, with soft thoughts and softer words, clinging to him=
, he induced her to=20

resume their stroll, which both of them now wished might assuredly be undis=
turbed. They had=20

arrived at the limit of the pleasure-grounds, and they wandered into the pa=
rk and its most=20

sequestered parts. All this time Lothair spoke much, and gave her the histo=
ry of his life since he=20

first visited her home. Lady Corisande said little, but, when she was more =
composed, she told him=20

that from the first her heart had been his, but every thing seemed to go ag=
ainst her hopes.=20

Perhaps at last, to please her parents, she would have married the Duke of =
Brecon, had not=20

Lothair returned; and what he had said to her that morning at Crecy House h=
ad decided her=20

resolution, whatever might be her lot; to unite it to no one else but him. =
But then came the=20

adventure of the crucifix, and she thought all was over for her, and she qu=
itted town in despair.=20

=E2=80=9CLet us rest here for a while;=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cunde=
r the shade of this oak;=E2=80=9D and Lady Corisande=20

reclined against its mighty trunk, and Lothair threw himself at her feet. H=
e had a great deal still to=20

tell her, and, among other things, the story of the pearls, which he had wi=
shed to give to Theodora.=20

=E2=80=9CShe was, after all, your good genius,=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande=
. =E2=80=9CI always liked her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, now,=E2=80=9D said=
=20

Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthat case has never been opened. The year has elapsed, bu=
t I would not open it, for I had=20

always a wild wish that the person who opened it should be yourself. See, h=
ere it is.=E2=80=9D And he gave=20

her the case.  =E2=80=9CWe will not break the seal,=E2=80=9D said Corisande=
. =E2=80=9CLet us respect it for her=20

sake=E2=80=94ROMA!=E2=80=9D she said, examining it; and then they opened th=
e case. There was the slip of paper=20

which Theodora, at the time, had placed upon the pearls, and on which she h=
ad written some=20

unseen words. They were read now, and ran thus:  =E2=80=9CTHE OFFERING OF T=
HEODORA TO=20

LOTHAIR=E2=80=99S BRIDE.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet me place them on you now,=
=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI will wear them as your=20

chains,=E2=80=9D said Corisande.  The sun began to tell them that some hour=
s had elapsed since they=20

quitted Brentham House. At last a soft hand, which Lothair retained, gave h=
im a slight pressure,=20

and a sweet voice whispered: =E2=80=9CDearest, I think we ought to return.=
=E2=80=9D  And they returned almost in=20

silence. They rather calculated that, taking advantage of the luncheon-hour=
, Corisande might=20

escape to her room, but they were a little too late. Luncheon was over, and=
 they met the duchess=20

and a large party on the terrace.  =E2=80=9CWhat has become of you, my good=
 people?=E2=80=9D said her grace;=20

=E2=80=9Cbells have been ringing for you in every direction. Where can you =
have been?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have been in=20

_
front by the Atbara, and on the left by a perpendicular ravine about eighty=
 feet deep, at the bottom=20

of which flowed the rivulet called by the Arabs the "Till;" this joined the=
 river immediately below our=20

plateau. On our right was a steep and rugged incline covered with rocks of =
the whitest sandstone,=20

through which ran veins of rich iron ore from four to five feet in width. I=
 found a considerable=20

quantity of fossil wood in the sandstone, and I had previously discovered o=
n the Sofi side of the=20

river, the fossil stem of a tree about twelve feet long; the grain appeared=
 to be exceedingly close,=20

but I could not determine the class to which the tree had belonged.  As the=
 Atbara had fallen to the=20

level of the small tributary, the Till, that stream was nearly exhausted, a=
nd the fish that inhabited=20

its deep and shady waters during the rainy season were now fast retiring to=
 the parent river. At the=20

mouth of the stream were a number of rocks, that, as the water of the Atbar=
a retreated, daily=20

increased in size; these were evidently blocks that had been detached from =
the cliffs that walled in=20

the Till. As we were now entirely dependent upon the rod and the rifle for =
the support of our party, I=20

determined to try for a fish, as I felt quite certain that some big fellows=
 in the main river would be=20

waiting to receive the small fry that were hurrying away from the exhausted=
 waters of the Till.  I=20

had a good supply of tackle, and I chose a beautifully straight and taperin=
g bamboo that had been=20

brought down by the river floods. I cut off the large brass ring from a gam=
e-bag, which I lashed to=20

the end of my rod; and having well secured my largest winch, that carried u=
pwards of 200 yards of=20

the strongest line, I arranged to fish with a live bait upon a set of trebl=
e hooks. In one of the rocks=20

at the water's edge was a circular hole about three feet in diameter and fi=
ve or six feet deep; this=20

appeared like an artificial well, but it was simply the effect of natural b=
oring by the joint exertions of=20

the strong current conmbined with hard sand and gravel. This had perhaps ye=
ars ago settled in=20

some slight hollow in the rock, and had gradually worked out a deep well by=
 perpetual revolutions.=20

I emptied this natural bait box of its contents of sand and rounded pebbles=
, and having thoroughly=20

cleaned and supplied it with fresh water, I caught a large number of excell=
ent baits by emptying a=20

hole in the Till; these I consigned to my aquarium. The baits were of vario=
us kinds: some were=20

small "boulti" (a species of perch), but the greater number were young fish=
 of the Silurus species;=20

these were excellent, as they were exceedingly tough in the skin, and so ha=
rdy in constitution, that=20

they rather enjoyed the fun of fishing. I chose a little fellow about four =
inches in length to begin=20

with, and I delicately inserted the hook under the back fin. Gently droppin=
g my alluring and lively=20

little friend in a deep channel between the rocks and the mouth of the Till=
, I watched my large float=20

with great interest, as, carried by the stream, it swept past the corner of=
 a large rock into the open=20

river; that corner was the very place where, if I had been a big fish, I sh=
ould have concealed=20

myself for a sudden rush upon an unwary youngster. The large green float sa=
iled leisurely along,=20

simply indicating, by its uneasy movement, that the bait was playing; and n=
ow it passed the point=20

of the rock and hurried round the corner in the sharper current towards the=
 open river. Off it went!--

Down dipped the tip of the rod, with a rush so sudden that the line caught =
somewhere, I don't=20

know where, and broke!  "Well, that was a monster!" I exclaimed, as I recov=
ered my inglorious=20

line; fortunately the float was not lost, as the hooks had been carried awa=
y at the fastening to the=20

main line; a few yards of this I cut off, as it had partially lost its stre=
ngth from frequent immersion.  I=20

replaced the lost hooks by a still larger set, with the stoutest gimp and s=
wivels, and once more I=20

tried my fortune with a bait exactly resembling the first. In a short time =
I had a brisk run, and=20

quickly landed a fish of about twelve pounds: this was a species known by t=
he Arabs as the=20



"bayard;" it has a blackish green back, the brightest silver sides and bell=
y, with very peculiar back=20

fins, that nearest to the tail being a simple piece of flesh free from rays=
. This fish has four long=20

barbules in the upper jaw, and two in the lower: the air-bladder, when drie=
d, forms a superior=20

quality of isinglass, and the flesh of this fish is excellent. I have frequ=
ently seen the bayard sixty or=20

seventy pounds' weight, therefore I was not proud of my catch, and I recomm=
enced fishing.=20

Nothing large could be tempted, and I only succeeded in landing two others =
of the same kind, one=20

ces."=20

for Invalids," Etc., Etc.=20

Introductory.   In the second and third centuries three mighty Hindoo kings=
 were renowned for their=20

cookery. They were Nala, the king of Nishadhades, whose fame for dressing a=
nd preparing=20

excellent dishes made his kingdom famous. He reigned in the second age.  Th=
e second was=20

Bhima, who reigned in the third age. He was so devoted to the culinary art =
that for a whole year he=20

served in the capacity of Valala, or cook to Virat Rajah, King of Panchala =
Nagur.  The third was=20

King Pakasasana, who was not only superintendent of the preparation of cele=
stial food, but was=20

also a distinguished chef.  The secret of the cuisine of these noted cooks =
was a mysterious=20

powder, which, when added to their dishes, cured disease, as well as appeas=
ed the appetite.=20

Those who partook of their food died only of extreme old age or by accident=
. No record can be=20

found where the fevers of the country carried them off.  In an ancient cook=
ery book printed in the=20

Sanscrit language, are preserved many of the formulas and recipes used by t=
hese kingly cooks=20

and their successors. The "mysterious powders" which they used were a combi=
nation of various=20

fruits, spices, condiments, roots, seeds, etc., which were either pounded t=
ogether dry or worked to=20

a paste and dried afterwards. There were hundreds of these preparations whi=
ch were used in=20

different dishes; each dish had its own separate powder. They are known to =
modern civilization as=20

Curry powders.  To-day almost every nation has its own appropriate Curry po=
wder and its own=20

Curry formulas.  The Curry powders of England are particularly suited to th=
e damp, foggy weather=20

of that country, but they are no more suited for this climate than are the =
heavily brandied=20

Champagnes which are of a necessity used in England and Russia.  A short ti=
me ago the=20

members of the famous New York Chafing Dish Club decided to hold a series o=
f practical sessions=20

in Curry cookery, with a view to determining which Curry powder on the New =
York market was the=20

most appropriate for the United States, at the same time was made of the pu=
rest and most=20

wholesome ingredients.  Over forty different Curry powders were tasted. A n=
umber of=20

distinguished English epicures were present and took part in the contest, w=
ith a view to=20

demonstrate that the English preparations were the best. The different bott=
les were wrapped in=20

paper so that the labels of the powders could not be seen. Each package was=
 numbered, and it=20

was the universal opinion of the experts that Number 7 was the best of the =
lot. When the wrapper=20

was removed Number 7 was found to be the Curry powder of JAMES P. SMITH & C=
OMPANY,=20

Park Place, New York.  THE AUTHOR.     [Illustration]  [Illustration]     C=
urry Oil.   One of the=20

agreeable and at the same time useful oils which should find a place on the=
 shelf of every kitchen=20

or butler's pantry, is known as Curry Oil. It is made by putting into a six=
-ounce, large-mouthed,=20

glass stopper bottle two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, then=
 filling up the bottle with=20



Antonini Olive Oil. In a week it will be ready for use. A few drops of it s=
hould be added to sauces=20

and salads.     Curry Vinegar.   Put into a pint of good cider or wine vine=
gar a tablespoonful of J. P.=20

Smith's Curry Powder, shake it well from time to time, and in ten days it w=

excellent for flavoring soups, etc.     Curry Essence.   Add three ounces o=
f J. P. Smith's Curry=20

Powder to a quart of white wine vinegar. Put the bottle into a pot of warm =
water and cork it the=20

same as in cooking beef tea; let it boil an hour, then place at one side to=
 cool and settle. When=20

thoroughly settled pour off the clear liquid and use for flavoring soups an=

_
trial to use a much larger bait, and I returned to camp with my fish for di=
nner.  The life at our new=20

camp was charmingly independent; we were upon Abyssinian territory; but, as=
 the country was=20

uninhabited, we considered it as our own. I had previously arranged with th=
e sheik of Sofi that,=20

whenever the rifle should be successful and I could spare meat, I would hoi=
st the English flag=20

upon my flagstaff; thus I could at any time summon a crowd of hungry visito=
rs, who were ever=20

ready to swim the river and defy the crocodiles in the hope of obtaining fl=
esh. We were=20

exceedingly comfortable, having a large stock of supplies; in addition to o=
ur servants we had=20

acquired a treasure in a nice old slave woman, whom we had hired from the s=
heik at a dollar per=20

month to grind the corn. Masara (Sarah) was a dear old creature, the most w=
illing and obliging=20

specimen of a good slave; and she was one of those bright exceptions of the=
 negro race that=20

would have driven Exeter Hall frantic with enthusiasm. Poor old Masara! she=
 had now fallen into=20

the hands of a kind mistress, and as we were improving in Arabic, my wife u=
sed to converse with=20

her upon the past and present; future had never been suggested to her simpl=
e mind. Masara had=20

a weighty care; her daily bread was provided; money she had none, neither d=
id she require it;=20

husband she could not have had, as a slave has none, but is the common prop=
erty of all who=20

purchase her: but poor Masara had a daughter, a charming pretty girl of abo=
ut seventeen, the=20

offspring of one of the old woman's Arab masters. Sometimes this girl came =
to see her mother,=20

and we arranged the bath on the inflated skins, and had her towed across fo=
r a few days. This was=20

Masara's greatest happiness, but her constant apprehension; the nightmare o=
f her life was the=20

possibility that her daughter should be sold and parted from her. The girl =
was her only and all=20

absorbing thought, the sole object of her affection: she was the moon in he=
r mother's long night of=20

slavery; without her, all was dark and hopeless. The hearts of slaves are c=
rushed and hardened by=20

the constant pressure of the yoke; nevertheless some have still those holy =
feelings of affection that=20

nature has implanted in the human mind: it is the tearing asunder of those =
tender chains that=20

renders slavery the horrible curse that it really is; human beings are redu=
ced to the position of=20

animals, without the blessings enjoyed by the brute creation--short memorie=
s and obtuse feelings.=20

Masara, Mahomet, Wat Gamma, and Bacheet, formed the establishment of Ehetil=
la, which was=20

the Arab name of our locality. Bacheet was an inveterate sportsman and was =
my constant and=20

sole attendant when shooting; his great desire was to accompany me in eleph=
ant-hunting, when=20

he promised to carry one of my spare rifles as a trusty gun-bearer, and he =
vowed that no animal=20

should ever frighten him.  A few extracts from my journal written at that t=
ime will convey a tolerable=20

idea of the place and our employments.  "September 23.--Started for the Set=
tite river. In about four=20

hours' good marching N.N.E. through a country of grass and mimosa bush that=
 forms the high=20

land between that river and the Atbara, I reached the Settite about a mile =
from the junction. The=20

river is about 250 yards wide, and flows through a broken valley of innumer=
able hillocks and deep=20

ravines of about five miles in width, precisely similar in character to tha=
t of the Atbara; the soil=20

having been denuded by the rains, and carried away by the floods of the riv=
er towards the Nile.=20

The heat was intense; there was no air stirring; a cloudless sky and a sun =
like a burning-glass. We=20

saw several nellut (Taurotragus strepsiceros), but these superb antelopes w=
ere too wild to allow a=20

close approach. The evening drew near, and we had nothing to eat, when fort=
unately I espied a=20

fine black-striped gazelle (Gazella Dorcas), and with the greatest caution =
I stalked it to within=20

about a hundred paces, and made a successful shot with the Fletcher rifle, =
and secured our=20



dinner. Thus provided, we selected a steep sugarloaf-shaped hill, upon the =
peak of which we=20

intended to pass the night. We therefore cleared away the grass, spread bou=
ghs upon the ground,=20

lighted fires, and prepared for a bivouac. Having a gridiron, and pepper an=
d salt, I made a grand=20

dinner of liver and kidneys, while my men ate a great portion of the gazell=
e raw, and cooked the=20

remainder in their usual careless manner by simply laying it upon the fire =
for a few seconds until=20

warmed half through. There is nothing like a good gridiron for rough cookin=
g; a frying-pan is good=20

if you have fat, but without it, the pan is utterly useless. With a gridiro=
n and a couple of iron=20

skewers a man is independent:--the liver cut in strips and grilled with pep=
per and salt is excellent,=20

but kabobs are sublime, if simply arranged upon the skewer in alternate pie=
ces of liver and kidney=20

cut as small as walnuts, and rubbed with chopped garlic, onions, cayenne, b=
lack pepper, and salt.=20

The skewers thus arranged should be laid either upon the glowing embers, or=
 across the gridiron.=20

"Not a man closed his eyes that night--not that the dinner disagreed with t=
hem--but the=20

mosquitoes! Lying on the ground, the smoke of the fires did not protect us;=
 we were beneath it, as=20

were the mosquitoes likewise; in fact the fires added to our misery, as the=
y brought new plagues in=20

thousands of flying bugs; with beetles of all sizes and kinds: these, becom=
ing stupified in the=20

smoke, tumbled clumsily upon me, entangling themselves in my long beard and=
 whiskers, crawling=20

over my body, down my neck, and up my sleeping-drawers, until I was swarmin=
g with them; the=20

bugs upon being handled squashed like lumps of butter, and emitted a perfum=
e that was=20

unbearable. The night seemed endless; it was passed in alternately walking =
to and fro, flapping=20

right and left with a towel, covering my head with a pillow-case, and gaspi=
ng for air through the=20

button-hole, in an atmosphere insufferably sultry.  "At length morning dawn=
ed, thank Heaven! I=20

made a cup of strong coffee, ate a morsel of dhurra bread, and started alon=
g the high ground=20

parallel with the course of the Settite river up stream.  "After walking fo=
r upwards of four hours=20

over ground covered with tracks of giraffes, elephants, and antelopes about=
 a fortnight old, I saw=20

four tetel (Antelopus Bubalis), but I was unfortunate in my shot at a long =
range in high grass. We=20

had been marching south-east, and as I intended to return to camp, we now t=
urned sharp to the=20

west. The country was beautiful, composed of alternate glades, copses, and =
low mimosa forest. At=20

length I espied the towering head of a giraffe about half a mile distant; h=
e was in the mimosa=20

forest, and was already speculating upon our party, which he had quickly ob=
served. Leaving my=20

men in this spot to fix his attention, I succeeded in making a good stalk t=
o within one hundred and=20

twenty yards of him. He was exactly facing me, and I waited for him to turn=
 and expose the flank,=20

but he suddenly turned so quickly that I lost the opportunity, and he recei=
ved the bullet in his back=20

as he started at full speed; for the moment he reeled crippled among the mi=
mosas, but,=20

recovering, he made off. I could not fire the left-hand barrel on account o=
f the numerous trees and=20

bushes. I called my men, and followed for a few hundred yards upon his trac=
k, but as this was=20

directly in an opposite direction to that of my camp I was forced to give u=
p the hunt.*    * We found=20

the remains of the Giraffe a few days later.  "About an hour later I hit a =
tetel with both barrels of the=20

little Fletcher, at full gallop; but although we followed the blood-track f=
or sonme distance, we did=20

not recover it. At this season the grass is in most places from seven to te=
n feet high, and being=20

trodden by numerous old tracks of animals, it is difficult to find a wounde=
d beast without the=20

assistance of a dog. The luck was against me to-day; I could only shoot wel=
l enough to hit=20

everything, but to bag nothing, owing to a sleepless night. I killed a guin=
ea-fowl to secure dinner=20



upon my return, and we at length reached the welcome Atbara within two mile=
s of my head-

quarters. My men made a rush to the river, and threw themselves into the wa=
ter, as all were more=20

or less exhausted by the intense heat of the long day's work after a restle=
ss night. I took a good=20

drink through my gazelle shank-bone, which I wear suspended from my neck fo=
r that purpose, and=20

I went on alone, leaving my bathing party to refresh themselves. I reached =
the tent a little after 4=20

P.M. after more than ten hours' continual walking in the burning sun. I fel=
t almost red hot, but my=20

bath and clean linen being ready, thanks to the frequently; the sauce will =
be ready for use in ten=20

days. These sauces may be purchased at the grocer's, or the mushroom catsup=
 may be made as=20

follows from field mushrooms:  Cover the bottom of a porcelain or crockery =
dish with fresh=20

mushrooms, sprinkle over them a liberal quantity of salt; on top of the sal=
t place another layer of=20

mushrooms, then another thin layer of salt, and so on until the mushrooms a=
re used up. Let the=20

dish stand twelve to fifteen hours, then rub the pulp through a sieve. Put =
it into a stone jar, place=20

the latter in a pan of water and let it simmer until the quantity is reduce=
d one half. To keep it add a=20

gill of brandy to every quart of sauce. To make it into a delightful table =
sauce add two=20

tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder to each pint; shake frequently=
; when cool, put away=20

in well-corked bottles.     [Illustration]     A Refreshing Tonic.   One of=
 the most delicious of=20

refreshing tonics is prepared with an overflowing teaspoonful of Maggi Boui=
llon, half a pint of=20

boiling water, seasoned with a pinch of J. P. Smith's inimitable Curry Powd=
er. A great many object=20

to the peculiar taste which prepared bouillon, beef extracts, etc., usually=
 possess, but with the=20

addition of this particular Curry it is an impossibility for even the most =
exacting palate not to=20

appreciate the compound.     Mulligatawny Soup.   Put into a frying pan a t=
ablespoonful of Antonini=20

Olive Oil; when hot add a cut up red onion and fry brown; next add a tables=
poonful of J. P. Smith's=20

Curry Powder, cook a moment and add a pint of chicken broth or a pint of ho=
t water and a=20

tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillon. Pour the contents of the frying pan into t=
wo quarts of rich chicken=20

broth, thicken slightly with a tablespoonful of rice flour, taste for salt,=
 and serve. This is the family=20

method of making this excellent soup. The meat of a chicken cut into square=
s may be used in this=20

soup.     Curried Apples.   Apples thus prepared are more toothsome than th=
e ordinary spiced=20

apples. Peel and core six large Greening apples. Mix together half a pound =
of butter, half a pound=20

of brown sugar, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith=
's Curry Powder; fill the=20

holes with the mixture, put them in a buttered tin, and bake. When cold ser=
ve with cold meats.=20

Crab apples boiled in sugar and flavored with Curry, form an agreeable reli=
sh for cold game.=20

[Illustration]     A Dainty Shrimp Curry.   Put into a chafing dish, or fry=
ing pan, a tablespoonful of=20

Antonini Olive Oil, a teaspoonful of chopped onion and fry a delicate brown=
, then add a=20

teaspoonful of James P. Smith's Curry Powder. Allow the powder to cook a mo=
ment, then add a=20

pint of water and a tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillon. If the latter is not t=
o be had, then add a pint of=20

beef stock instead of the water; simmer ten minutes, and add a teaspoonful =
of rice flour dissolved=20

in cold water. Let boil until it thickens slightly, then strain into anothe=
r dish. Open a can of=20

Barataria Shrimps, rinse them off with cold water, add them to the Curry sa=
uce, warm up the dish,=20

then pour over it three tablespoonfuls of fresh orange juice, a teaspoonful=
 of dry sherry, and serve.=20

Boiled Rice for Curry Dishes.   Alas! how very few can say they can boil ri=
ce properly. It is a most=20

difficult feat to many an expert cook, and yet it is very simple, when one =
knows how. The essential=20

point to be gained is that after boiling, each grain must be distinct and u=
nbroken, yet tender and to=20



every appearance fairly ready to burst. To accomplish this a small quantity=
 of rice must be cooked=20

in a large volume of water. An ordinary half pint cup full of rice should b=
e boiled in at least a gallon=20

of water. It will surprise the uninitiated when they compare the bulk of th=
e rice before and after=20

cooking. The rice should be first well washed in several waters; reject all=
 husks and imperfect=20

grains, put the rice into cold water slightly salted, and boil about twenty=
-five minutes. Old rice=20

requires a little longer cooking. The grains should occasionally be tested,=
 and when a slight=20

pressure will crush them they are done. If boiled until the grains burst, t=
he rice is spoiled for=20

serving with Curry. If boiled in a small volume of water the rice is also r=
endered useless, as the=20

grains will stick together. After boiling the rice should be placed over th=
e range where it will throw=20

off the moisture absorbed in the boiling. Should any water remain it should=
 be carefully kept for=20

soups, sauces, etc., as it is quite as nutritious as the rice itself.     S=
hrimp Curry, No. 2.   Fry a=20

minced onion with a tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil; when brown add a h=
eaping tablespoonful=20

of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, a teaspoonful of rice flour, and a heaping s=
altspoonful of salt. Stir to=20

prevent burning, add a pint of hot water or broth. Cook until the sauce thi=
ckens slightly, strain and=20

add a square of sugar, a heaping tablespoonful of either Chutney, currant j=
elly, apple, or cranberry=20

sauce. Put into the sauce a can of shrimps, let the whole warm through thor=
oughly. Arrange on a=20

platter a border of boiled rice, put the Curried shrimp in the centre, sque=
eze over the shrimp the=20

juice of a lime, and over the rice sprinkle the juice of an orange.     Cur=
ry of Cray Fish.   Crayfish=20

are to be had in the New York market at all seasons. They inhabit fresh wat=
er streams almost=20

everywhere, but the West furnishes the best and largest which are sent to t=
he New York market. In=20

the fall, large quantities of them are put into cold storage houses for win=
ter use. They are usually=20

sold already boiled and shelled, but in summer are to be had alive. The for=
mer is the most=20

advantageous way of buying them, as they require but little preparation. Se=
rved as a Curry they=20

are excellent. To cook them follow instructions for shrimp Curry, substitut=
ing crayfish for shrimps.=20

Curry of Prawns.   The prawn, although resembling the shrimp and the crayfi=
sh, is larger than=20

either of the other Crustacea. They have a more pronounced flavor, and are =
at their best served=20

as Curry. Select a quart of boiled prawns, pick them over carefully to see =
that all shell has been=20

removed, rinse in cold water a moment, and dry them in a napkin. Put into a=
 frying pan a heaping=20

tablespoonful of butter; when hot add a chopped spring onion or a young lee=
k, cook a few=20

moments, and add a heaping teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder; stir =
to prevent burning,=20

allow it to cook a moment, and add half a pint of hot water, or beef stock,=
 one small sour apple,=20

peeled, and cut into dice, a square of sugar, and a teaspoonful of Epicurea=
n Sauce. Cover and=20

simmer until the apple is cooked, then add another half pint of beef broth,=
 or hot water containing a=20

tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillon, stir well and rub through a small strainer=
; add the prawns to the=20

sauce, heat them through, season with a small quantity of salt and a tables=
poonful of tomato=20

catsup, pour the Curry onto a hot platter, surround it with a border of boi=
led rice, squeeze over the=20

Curry the juice of half a lemon, and serve.     Curry of Scallops.   Wash, =
drain, and scald, a pint of=20

scallops; put them into a saucepan, add half a teaspoonful of salt, small p=
iece of a bay-leaf, three=20

whole cloves, and a pint and a half of milk; boil thirty minutes. In a fryi=
ng pan prepare a Curry=20

sauce as follows: Put into the pan a tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil in=
 which a few cloves of=20

garlic had been steeped, add two teaspoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder=
, a chopped sweet=20

Spanish pepper and a gill of beef broth, or hot water containing a teaspoon=
ful of Maggi Bouillon;=20



cover and cook five minutes. Add a pint more of the liquid, a teaspoonful o=
f rice flour dissolved in=20

cold water, two tablespoonfuls of mild Chutney, and the grated outside peel=
 of a lemon; stir and=20

simmer a few moments. Drain the scallops, put them in the centre of a hot p=
latter, surround them=20

with the sauce _without pouring any of it over them_; around the outer edge=
 arrange a neat border=20

of hot boiled rice, and send to table with a sauce-boat full of fresh orang=
e juice.     Curry of Frogs.=20

Proceed as per recipe for Curry of Scallops, with the exception that the fr=
ogs require one hour's=20

cooking in the milk. They may then be served the same as the scallops, or p=
ut into the sauce and=20

warmed up in it. A much plainer Curry sauce may be prepared if so desired. =
    Curry of Oysters.=20

Put into a frying pan two tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil, add a scant=
 tablespoonful of J. P.=20

Smith's Curry Powder, a chopped Bermuda onion, and cook until the onions ar=
e quite brown; stir=20

frequently to prevent burning. Add a pint of oyster liquor, a saltspoonful =
of salt, simmer until=20

reduced one-third, then=20


_
and sat down with a lion's appetite to good curry and rice, and a cup of bl=
ack coffee.  "September=20

25.--Having nothing to eat, I took my fishing-rod and strolled down to the =
river, and chose from my=20

aquarium a fish of about half a pound for a live bait; I dropped this in th=
e river about twenty yards=20

beyond the mouth of the Till, and allowed it to swim naturally down the str=
eam so as to pass=20

across the Till junction, and descend the deep channel between the rocks. F=
or about ten minutes I=20

had no run; I had twice tried the same water without success, nothing would=
 admire my charming=20

bait; when, just as it had reached the favourite turning-point at the extre=
mity of a rock, away=20

dashed the line, with the tremendous rush that follows the attack of a heav=
y fish. Trusting to the=20

large raw oysters. When they are thoroughly heated through and the gills be=
gin to curl, they will be=20

cooked sufficiently. Serve with hot boiled rice.     Curry of Crab.   Prepa=
re a plain Curry sauce as=20

for Oyster Curry, and in the sauce put the contents of a can of crab meat; =
when warmed through it=20

is ready to serve. The fresh crab meat from the shells is of course superio=
r to the canned article,=20

but it is more troublesome to prepare. Before sending to table squeeze over=
 the dish the juice of a=20

fresh lime.     Soft Shell Crabs Curried.   Select half a dozen fine large =
soft shell crabs, remove the=20

sand-pouch and the feathery gill like parts found under the side points of =
the shells. Mix together=20

to a paste in a mortar a clove of garlic, a heaping tablespoonful of butter=

acquaintance thoroughly, but off he dashed down the stream for about fifty =
yards at one rush,=20

making for a narrow channel between two rocks, through which the stream ran=
 like a mill-race.=20

Should he pass this channel, I knew he would cut the line across the rock; =
therefore, giving him=20

the butt, I held him by main force, and by the great swirl in the water I s=
aw that I was bringing him=20

to the surface; but just as I expected to see him, my float having already =
appeared, away he=20

darted in another direction, taking sixty or seventy yards of line without =
a check. I at once=20

observed that he must pass a shallow Powder, a tablespoonful of Epicurean S=
auce, and the juice=20

of a lemon. If the paste is too thick, thin out with orange juice; cover th=
e crabs with this paste, dip=20

them in beaten egg, then in cracker or bread crumbs and fry like doughnuts.=
 To be eaten cold.=20

Curry of Lobster.   Kill two live lobsters, remove the meat from the tails,=
 split each tail piece in two=20

lengthwise, and remove the entrail found therein; cut the meat into inch pi=
eces. Put into a frying=20

pan two tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil, when hot add the lobster, tos=
s the pieces about a few=20

moments, and strew over the meat a tablespoonful of=20


_
favourable for landing a heavy fish; I therefore checked him as he reached =
this spot, and I followed=20

him down the bank, reeling up line as I ran parallel with his course. Now c=
ame the tug of war! I=20

knew my hooks were good and the line sound, therefore I was determined not =
to let him escape=20

beyond the favourable ground; and I put a strain upon him, that after much =
struggling brought to=20

the surface a great shovel-head, followed by a pair of broad silvery sides,=
 as I led him gradualhy=20

into shallow water. Bacheet now cleverly secured him by the gills, and drag=
ged him in triumph to=20

the shore. This was a splendid bayard, at least forty pounds' weight.  "I l=
aid my prize upon some=20

green reeds, and covered it carefully with the same cool material. I then r=
eplaced my bait by a=20

lively fish, and once more tried the river. In a very short time I had anot=
her run, and landed a small=20

fish of about nine pounds of the same species. Not wishing to catch fish of=
 that size, I put on a=20

large bait, and threw it about forty yards into the river, well up the stre=
am, and allowed the float to=20

sweep the water in a half circle, thus taking the chance of different dista=
nces from the shore. For=20

about half an hour nothing moved; I was just preparing to alter my position=
, when out rushed my=20

line, and striking hard, I believed I fixed the old gentleman himself, for =
I had no control over him=20

whatever; holding him was out of the question; the line flew through my han=
ds, cutting them till the=20

blood flowed, and I was obliged to let the fish take his own way: this he d=
id for about eighty yards,=20

when he suddenly stopped. This Curry Powder. Cook fifteen minutes, stirring=
 continually; add the=20

juice of two Florida oranges, then quickly remove the pan from the fire and=
 when the agitation in=20

the pan ceases, serve on toast. Dainty rice croquettes may be served with t=
he dish.     Curry of=20

Lobster, No. 2.   Use the meat of two boiled lobsters, cut it into neat pie=
ces; take all green fat and=20

coral, and set them aside; mix the green fat with a heaping spoonful of J. =
P. Smith's Curry Powder.=20

Squeeze out the juice of three limes, and add to it half a teaspoonful of p=
owdered sugar. Put into a=20

frying pan an ounce of butter; when creamed add a teaspoonful of minced oni=
on, brown it a little,=20

now add the mixed Curry Powder; dissolve a teaspoonful of rice flour in col=
d water, add this to a=20

pint of hot water or soup stock, stir into the pan, and simmer till thick; =
now add the lobster, and=20

simmer fifteen minutes longer. Wash and dry the coral, separate it. Prepare=
 a border of rice on a=20

dish, and over it sprinkle the coral and eggs, if any--put the Curry in the=
 centre, and serve.     Curry=20

of Clams.   Both the Little Neck and the paper shell clams are very good se=
rved as a Curry; only=20

the body part of the soft clam should be used, as the remainder is somewhat=
 tough. The Little=20

Necks, if cooked too much, will be tough. Serve them with a plain Curry sau=
ce.     Curry of=20

Salmon.   Fresh cold boiled salmon may be served as a Curry, and a salmon s=
teak, cooked in a=20

Curry sauce until it is done, is very good eating, but there is no better w=
ay of serving canned=20

salmon than as a Curry. The only point is to be sure to buy the best known =
brand of=20


_
itself, having no check-wheel, and the slack bends of the line caught the h=
andle just as he again=20

rushed forward, and with a jerk that nearly pulled the rod from my hands he=
 was gone! I found one=20

of my large hooks broken short off; the confounded reel! The fish was a mon=
ster!  "After this bad=20

luck I had no run until the evening, when putting on a large bait, and fish=
