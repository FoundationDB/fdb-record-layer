gained. She had never known it, until he had flung wide the gates. She had =
sought for it, and=20

never found it until now, and her senses doubted it. It was a paradise of l=
ove, to be sure; but one,=20

too, of duty. Duty made it real. Work was there, and fulfilment of the purp=
ose of life itself. And if his=20

days hitherto had been useless, hers had in truth been barren.  It was only=
 of late, after a life-long=20

groping, that she had discovered their barrenness. The right to happiness! =
Could she begin anew,=20

and found it upon a rock? And was he the rock?  The question startled her, =
and she drew away=20

from him first her hand, and then she turned her body, staring at him with =
widened eyes. He did=20

not resist the movement; nor could he, being male, divine what was passing =
within her, though he=20

watched her anxiously. She had no thought of the first days,--but afterward=
s. For at such times it is=20

the woman who with the business, and running through the accounts."  "I hav=
e been working very=20

hard," said Jeremiah.  "That is it. When I did the work myself I also used =
to sit up night after night=20

poring over the books. An anxious mind, Jeremiah--an anxious mind. And you =
resemble me--oh,=20

how you resemble me! What does a late night now and then matter to the youn=
g and strong? They=20

can bear it; it leaves no ill effects behind. _I_ could bear it once; _I_ w=
as once young and strong=20

as you are; _I_ was once filled with hope and enthusiasm. And now, look at =
me. I am a wreck, a=20

feeble wreck, scarcely able to contend with an infant. My strength gone, my=
 hope and enthusiasm=20

gone, my confidence gone in every being in the world with the exception of =
you and your mother.=20

No reward can be too great for service so faithful! You are affected. I tha=
nk you, Jeremiah--I thank=20

you! That sympathizing look, those genuine tears, testify to the friendship=
 you bear toward me."  In=20

point of fact, Jeremiah had taken=20


_
the veil of the future. How long would that beacon burn which flamed now in=
 such prodigal waste?=20

Would not the very springs of it dry up? She looked at him, and she saw the=
 Viking. But the Viking=20

had fled from the world, and they--they would be going into it. Could love =
prevail against its=20

dangers and pitfalls and--duties? Love was the word that rang out, as one c=
alling through the=20

garden, and her thoughts ran molten. Let love overflow--she gloried in the =
waste! And let the lean=20

years come,--she defied them to-day.  "Oh, Hugh!" she faltered.  "My deares=
t!" he cried, and=20

would have seized her in his arms again but for a look of supplication. Tha=
t he had in him and had=20

dabbed his forehead with it, and it was this action which Miser Farebrother=
 chose to construe into=20

an exhibition of sympathy. Jeremiah's face was damp with perspiration; he w=
as bewildered by the=20

flow of words which fell like honey from the miser's lips; bewildered also =
by the presence of the=20

master he had wronged and robbed, of the man who held his fate in his hands=
. Lying back in his=20

chair, Miser Farebrother seemed to have scarcely an hour's life in him; his=
 strength seemed to be=20

ebbing away, and death to be fast approaching. What if he were to die there=
, within the hour, while=20

Jeremiah was in the room? Then all would be well. He could obtain=20


_
unsuspected chivalry filled her with an exquisite sweetness.  "You will--pr=
otect me?" she asked.=20

"With my life and with my honour," he answered. "Honora, there will be no h=
appiness like ours."  "I=20

wish I knew," she sighed: and then, her look returning from the veil, reste=

and his mother would have little difficulty in finding. Yes; then all would=
 be well. Before he had=20

presented himself to his master, he had confided to his mother all the part=
iculars of the danger=20

which threatened him, and they had debated what=20

had she believed herself to have had this sensation, and Farebrother were o=
ut of the way," and=20

then had paused. If Miser Farebrother were out of the way! That is, if he w=
ere dead! Yes; if he=20

were dead! "What then?" Jeremiah had asked, after a terrible silence, durin=
g which their minds=20

were threading labyrinths of awful possibilities of action which would extr=
icate Jeremiah from his=20

peril. "What then, mother?" Jeremiah had asked. "Why, then," his mother had=
 replied, "we could=20
