 _Judge._ Here.=20

_Maitreya._ My friend, I wish you happiness.  _Charudatta._ It will be mine=
.  _Maitreya._ And=20

peace.  _Charudatta._ That too will be mine.  _Maitreya._ My friend, why do=
 you seem so=20

exceedingly troubled? And why were you summoned?  _Charudatta._ My friend, =
     A scoundrel I,=20

who bear the blame,       Nor seek in heaven to be blest;     A maid--or go=
ddess--'t is the same--=20

But _he_ will say the rest.                                30  _Maitreya._ =
What? what?  _Charudatta._=20

[_Whispers._] That is it.  _Maitreya._ Who says that?  _Charudatta._ [_Indi=
cating Sansthanaka._]=20

This poor fellow is the instrument that fate uses to accuse me.  [131.12. S=
.  _Maitreya._ [_Aside to=20

Charudatta._] Why don't you simply say that she went home?  _Charudatta._ T=
hough I say it, it is=20

not the Hotel de Bourgogne. The play was received with hisses, but Moliere =
did not fear to laugh=20

at what was comic, whether he laughed according to the rules or against the=
m. A month later, at a=20

court performance, Louis XIV. laughed loudly; the courtiers quickly discove=
red Racine's wit, and=20

the laughter was echoed by all loyal citizens. In truth, there is laughing =
matter in the play; the=20

professional enthusiasm of Dandin, the judge, who wears his robe and cap ev=
en in bed, the rage=20

and rapture of litigation in Chicanneau and the Countess, have in them some=
thing of nature=20

beneath the caricature; in the buffoonery there is a certain extravagant gr=
ace.  _Les Plaideurs_,=20

however, was only an interlude between graver efforts. _Britannicus_ (1669)=
, founded on the=20

Annals of Tacitus, exhibits with masterly power Nero's adolescence in crime=
; the young tiger has=20

grace and strength, but=20


_
my condition.  _Maitreya._ But gentlemen! He adorned the city of Ujjayini w=
ith mansions, cloisters,=20

parks, temples, pools, and fountains, and he should be mad enough to commit=
 such a crime--and=20

for a mere trifle? [_Wrathfully._] You offspring of a loose wench, you brot=
her-in-law of the king,=20

Sansthanaka, you libertine, you slanderer, you buffoon, you gilded monkey, =
say it before me! This=20

friend of mine does n't even draw a flowering jasmine creeper to himself, t=
o gather the blossoms,=20

for fear that a twig might perhaps be injured. How should he commit a crime=
 like this, which=20

heaven and earth call accursed? Just wait, you son of a bawd! Wait till I s=
plit your head into a=20

hundred pieces with this staff of mine, as crooked as your heart.  _Sanstha=
naka._ [_Angrily._] to=20

be awakened within him. Agrippine is a superb incarnation of womanly ambiti=
on, a Roman sister of=20

Athalie. The play was at first coldly received; Corneille and his cabal did=
 not spare their censures.=20

In a preface Racine struck back, but afterwards repented of his bitter word=
s and withdrew them.=20

The critics, as he says in a later preface, disappeared; the piece remained=
. His conception of=20

tragedy in contrast with that of Corneille was defined by him in memorable =
words--what is natural=20

should be sought rather than what is extraordinary; the action should be si=
mple, "chargee de peu=20

de matiere"; it should advance gradually towards the close, sustained by th=
e interests, sentiments,=20

and passions of the personages.  The sprightly Henrietta of England, Duches=
s of Orleans,=20


_
quarrel, or a lawshuit, with Charudatta. What right has a man with a pate t=
hat looks like a caret, to=20

shplit my head into a hundred pieces? Not much! You confounded rashcal! [_M=
aitreya raises his=20

staff and repeats his words. Sansthanaka rises angrily and strikes him. Mai=
treya strikes back.=20

During the scuffle the jewels fall from Maitreya's girdle._]  _Sansthanaka.=
_ [_Picks up the jewels=20

and examines them. Excitedly._] Look, gentlemen, look! These are the poor g=
irl's jewels!=20

[_Pointing to Charudatta._] For a trifle like thish he murdered her, and ki=
lled her too. [_The=20

magistrates all bow their heads._]  _Charudatta._ [_Aside to Maitreya._]   =
   'T is thus my fate=20

would vent its gall,     That at this moment they conceived the idea of bri=
nging the rivalry between=20

the old dramatic poet and his young successor to a decisive test. She propo=
sed to each, without=20

the other's knowledge, a subject for a tragedy--the parting, for reasons of=
 State policy, of two royal=20

lovers, Titus, Emperor of Rome, and Berenice, Queen of Palestine. Perhaps H=
enrietta=20

mischievously thought of the relations of her friend Marie de Mancini with =
Louis XIV. The plays=20

appeared almost simultaneously in November 1670; Corneille's was before lon=
g withdrawn;=20

Racine's _Berenice_, in which the penetrating voice of La Champmesle interp=
reted the sorrows of=20

the heroine, obtained a triumph. Yet the elegiac subject is hardly suited t=
o tragedy; a situation=20

rather=20
