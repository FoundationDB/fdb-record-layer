'to be white' [or rather, 'to whiten' clothes], and suppose the apostles we=
re so called either from the=20

_candour_ and _sincerity_ of their minds, or because they were princes and =
wore white garments,=20

or else because they were by trade fullers.--(B., Jelal.) According to whic=
h last opinion, their=20

vocation is thus related: That as Jesus passed by the sea-side, he saw some=
 fullers at work, and,=20

accosting them, said, 'Ye cleanse these clothes, but cleanse not your heart=
s;' upon which they=20

believed on him. But the true etymology seems to be from the Ethiopic verb =
'hawyra,' 'to go;'=20

whence 'hawarya' signifies 'one that is sent,' a 'messenger,' or 'apostle.'=
--S.  [336] The person=20

crucified some will have to be a spy that was sent to entrap him; others th=
at it was one Titian, who=20

by the direction of Judas entered in at a window of the house where Jesus w=
as; to kill him; and=20

others that it was Judas himself, who agreed with the rulers of the Jews to=
 betray him for thirty=20

pieces of silver, and led those who were sent to take him.--They add, that =
Jesus, after his=20

crucifixion in _effigy_, was sent down again to the earth to comfort his mo=
ther and disciples and=20

acquaint them how the Jews were deceived, and was then taken up a second ti=
me into heaven.  It=20

is supposed by several that this story was an original invention of Mohamma=
d's; but they are=20

certainly mistaken: for several sectaries held the same opinion long before=
 his time. The=20

Basilidians, in the very beginning of Christianity, denied that Christ hims=
elf suffered, but [asserted]=20

that Simon the Cirenean was crucified in his  (Rising at five, dining at ni=
ne, supping at five,=20

sleeping at nine, makes one live to ninety-and-nine.) Sometimes, instead of=
 rising at five and=20

dining at nine, it is rising at six and dining at ten, supping at six and t=
o bed by ten; but we are not,=20

in this case, promised the ninety-and-nine years of life. Dinner between ni=
ne and ten, and other=20

meals at suitable hours, seems to have been the rule in France even until t=
he sixteenth century.=20

Breakfast was a very uncertain meal (think of breakfast before a nine o'clo=
ck dinner!), but supper=20

was almost as elaborate as dinner. As candles and lamps were very expensive=
, being regarded as=20

almost a luxury, there was some reason in the early hours for meals. For th=
e same reason, in=20

summer, when there were no fires to supply light, most people went to bed a=
s soon as it grew=20

dark. The lady of the house is told, in a French housekeeper's book of the =
fourteenth century, to=20

see that the candles are not wasted. She must go around to see that all fir=
es are out and the=20

house properly closed and that the servants are in bed. These latter are to=
 place the candle=20

allowed them on the floor, at a safe distance from the bed, and the lady mu=
st take care "to teach=20

them to put out their candle with the mouth, or with the hand before gettin=
g in bed, and not by=20

throwing their chemises over it"--servants, mistress, and all, be it rememb=
ered, slept naked.  The=20

kind of life we have been describing, the washing of hands, the plentiful f=
ood, the wine, the=20

amusements, the rich costumes--all these are things belonging to the lady. =

Corinthians before them, and the Carpocratians next (to name no more of tho=
se who affirmed=20

Jesus to have been a mere man), did believe the same thing, that it was not=
 himself, but one of his=20

followers, very like him, that was crucified. Photius tells us that he read=
 a book entitled 'The=20

Journeys of the Apostles,' relating the acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas=
, and Paul; and among=20

other things contained therein this was one, that Christ was not crucified,=
 but another in his stead,=20

and that therefore he laughed at his crucifiers, or those who thought they =
had crucified him.--S.=20

[337] This miracle is thus related by the commentators. Jesus having at the=
 laboring woman, had=20

no such comforts; lucky was she, indeed, if she had enough of coarse food a=
nd coarse clothing for=20

herself and children. The mediaeval moralists noted the inequality of the c=
lasses, and one of them=20

compares the fare of the rich, which we have mentioned, with that of the po=
or: "There was not one=20

among them, great or small, who did not have a fine appetite for dry (black=
) bread, and garlic, and=20

salt; nor did they eat anything else with these, neither mutton, nor beef, =
nor a bit of goose or young=20

spring chicken. And after the meal they took up the basin with both hands, =
and drank water."=20

rose up, and, having made the ablution, prayed, and then took off the cloth=
 which covered the=20

period. As a late biographer, Elie Berger, _Histoire de Blanche de Castille=
_, says: "Her life, during=20

a great part of the thirteenth century, is the life of France itself, the F=
rance to which she gave=20
