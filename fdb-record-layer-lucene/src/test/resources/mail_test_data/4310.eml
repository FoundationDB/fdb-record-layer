"Principles" And "Aspects."   Speaking metaphysically and philosophically, =
on strict Esoteric lines,=20

man as a complete unit is composed of Four basic Principles and their Three=
 Aspects on this=20

earth. In the semi-esoteric teachings, these Four and Three have been calle=
d Seven Principles, to=20

facilitate the comprehension of the masses.  The Eternal Basic Principles. =
 1. _Atma_, or _Jiva_,=20

"the One Life," which permeates the _Monadic Trio_. (One in three and three=
 in One.)  2. _Auric=20

Envelope_; because the substratum of the Aura around man is the universally=
 diffused primordial=20

and pure Akasha, the first film on the "For what?"  "For everything."  "Is =
there any signal for the=20

general rally?"  "A knot of straw in the hat."  "Very good. Adieu, my lord.=

who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foreg=
oing dialogue, "you will=20

see whether I am too old to be a man of action."  It was half-past nine o'c=
lock and the coadjutor=20

required half an hour to go from the archbishop's palace to the tower of St=
. Jacques de la=20

Boucherie. He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windo=
ws of the tower.=20

"Good," said he, "our syndic is at his post."  He knocked and the door was =
opened. The vicar=20

4. _Manas_ (the Higher=20

Ego); for it proceeds from Mahat, the first product or emanation of Pradhan=
a which contains=20

_potentially_ all the Gunas (attributes). Mahat is Cosmic Intelligence, cal=
led the "Great=20

Principle."(821)  Transitory Aspects Produced by the Principles.  1. _Prana=
_, the Breath of Life,=20

the same as _Nephesh_. At the death of a living being, Prana re-becomes Jiv=
a.(822)  2. _Linga=20

Sharira_, the Astral Form, the transitory emanation of the Auric Egg. This =
form precedes the=20

formation of the living Body, and after death clings to it, dissipating onl=
y with the disappearance of=20

its last atom (the skeleton excepted).  3. Lower Manas, the Animal Soul, th=
e reflection or shadow=20

of the Buddhi- Manas, having the potentialitie of both, but conquered gener=
ally by its association=20

with the Kama elements.  As the lower man is the combined product of two as=
pects--physically, of=20

his Astral Form, and psycho-physiologically of Kama-Manas--he is not looked=
 upon even as an=20

aspect, but as an illusion.  The Auric Egg, on account of its nature and ma=
nifold functions, has to=20

coadjutor might be able to find it on his return, and went down again. Alth=
ough the key was in the=20

door the coadjutor knocked.  "Come in," said a voice which he recognized as=
 that of the=20

mendicant, whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed. He rose on the ent=
rance of the=20

coadjutor, and at that moment ten o'clock struck.  "Well," said Gondy, "hav=
e you kept your word=20

with me?"  "Not exactly," replied the mendicant.  "How is that?"  "You aske=
d me for five hundred=20

men, did you not? Well, I have ten thousand for you."  "You are not boastin=
g?"  "Do you wish for a=20

proof?"  "Yes."  There were three candles alight, each of which burnt befor=
e a window, one looking=20

upon the city, the other upon the Palais Royal, and a third upon the Rue Sa=
int Denis.  The man=20

went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other.=
  "What are you doing?"=20

asked the coadjutor.  "I have given the signal."  "For what?"  "For the bar=
ricades. When you leave=20

_
the collective symbol of the Seven Universal Forces, so the Auric Egg conta=
ins, and is directly=20

related to, both the divine and the physical man. In its essence, as said, =
it is eternal; in its constant=20

correlations and transformations, during the reincarnating progress of the =
Ego on this earth, it is a=20

kind of perpetual motion machine.  As given out in our second volume, the E=
gos or Kumaras,=20

incarnating in man, at the end of the Third Root-Race, are not human Egos o=
f this earth or plane,=20

but become such only from the moment they ensoul the Animal Man, thus endow=
ing him with his=20

Higher Mind. Each is a "Breath" or Principle, called the Human Soul, or Man=
as, the Mind. As the=20

teachings say:  _"__Each is a pillar of light. Having chosen its vehicle, i=
t expanded, surrounding=20

with an Akashic Aura the human animal, while the Divine (Manasic) Principle=
 settled within that=20

human form.__"_  Ancient Wisdom teaches us, moreover, that from this first =
incarnation, the Lunar=20

Pitris, who had made men out of their Chhayas or Shadows, are absorbed by t=
his Auric Essence,=20

and a distinct Astral Form is now produced for each forthcoming personality=
 of the reincarnating=20

series of each Ego.  Thus the Auric Egg, reflecting all the thoughts, words=
 and deeds of man, is:=20

(_a_) The preserver of every Karmic record.  (_b_) The storehouse of all th=
e good and evil powers=20

of man,  "Good! there is your money, the same sum as that you have received=
 already. Now=20

remember that you are a general and do not go and drink."  "For twenty year=
s I have tasted=20

nothing but water."  The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor, =
who heard the sound=20

of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces.  "Ah! ah!" said the c=
oadjutor, "you are=20

avaricious, my good fellow."  The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag. =
 "Must I always be=20

the same?" said he, "and shall I never succeed in overcoming the old leaven=
? Oh, misery, oh,=20

vanity!"  "You take it, however."  "Yes, but I make hereby a vow in your pr=
esence, to employ all=20

that remains to me in pious works."  His face was pale and drawn, like that=
 of a man who had just=20

undergone some inward struggle.  "Singular man!" muttered Gondy, taking his=
 hat to go away; but=20

on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door. His first ide=
a was that this man=20

intended to do him some harm, but on the contrary he saw him fall on his kn=
ees before him with=20

his hands clasped.  "Your blessing, your holiness, before you go, I beseech=
 you!" he cried.  "Your=20

holiness!" said Gondy; "my friend, you take me for some one else."  "No, yo=
ur holiness, I take you=20

for what you are, that is to say, the coadjutor; I recognized you at the fi=
rst glance."  Gondy smiled.=20

"And you want my blessing?" he said.=20


_
giving out at his will--nay, at his very thought--every potentiality, which=
 becomes, then and there,=20

an acting potency: this Aura is the mirror in which sensitives and clairvoy=
ants sense and perceive=20

the real man, and see him _as he is_, not as he appears.  (_c_) As it furni=
shes man with his Astral=20

Form, around which the physical entity models itself, first as a foetus, th=
en as a child and man, the=20

y, such earnest=20

repentance, that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benedictio=
n with all the=20

unction of which he was capable.  "Now," said Gondy, "there is a communion =
between us. I have=20

blessed you and you are sacred to me. Come, have you committed some crime, =
pursued by=20

human justice, from which I can protect you?"  The beggar shook his=20
