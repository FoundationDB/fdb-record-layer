dear, you three have=20

tried bravely to help yourselves, and you have--yes, I must say it, dear--y=
ou have failed. Primrose=20

cannot spend her life as continual reader to Mrs. Mortlock; you see now, my=
 dear little girl, that you=20

are much too young to earn anything by your pen, and little Daisy--ah! Jasm=
ine, how thankful we=20

ought to be that we have our little Daisy still with us--but Daisy must nev=
er again have her peace=20

of mind so seriously imperilled. Jasmine, you three girls want two things--=
you want education, and=20

you want protection. You want to be thoroughly educated, first of all, in t=
hose general matters=20

which all cultivated women ought to know about; and secondly, in the specia=
l matter which each of=20

you has a taste for. That special taste or talent ought to be developed to =
the very uttermost, so=20

that bye-and-bye each of you girls can take up a profession and earn her li=
ving usefully to others,=20

and with ease and comfort to herself. If Primrose feels that she can after =
a time paint very=20

exquisitely and very beautifully on porcelain, she ought to be apprenticed =
to one of the best=20

houses, and there properly learn her trade; and you, Jasmine, whether you e=
ventually earn your=20

bread by writing beautiful stories, or lovely poems, or whether the artist =
within you develops into a=20

love for making painted pictures instead of word pictures, you must for man=
y years to come be=20

taught to think and have your little mind and vivid imagination fed on the =
wise and great thoughts=20

of others. Daisy's future we none of us can talk about, but I have no doubt=
 she also has her=20

special gift.  "Now, Jasmine, what a long, long lecture I am giving you, on=
ly the sum and=20

substance of it all is, dear, that I want to protect you, and Mrs. Ellswort=
hy is willing and anxious to=20

advance a sufficient sum of money to have you all properly educated. When y=
ou go to bed to-night=20

I am going to write very fully to Primrose on the subject."  "I wonder if s=
he will refuse," said=20

Jasmine, speaking in a very thoughtful tone; "she is very, very determined.=
 You think she will=20

regard it as a 'Hill Difficulty' which she ought to climb. I think she will=
 regard it as a fearful, dreadful=20

temptation which she ought to put away."  Miss Egerton smiled, for Jasmine'=
s sunny little face=20

looked so grave and anxious, and there was such a disturbed frown between h=
er brows.  "At any=20

rate, dear," continued the governess, "you will not oppose my scheme. You w=
ill see, dear, that the=20

greatest strength sometimes shows itself in yielding. Jasmine, dear, are yo=
u not quite tired of=20

having your own way?"  "A little," answered Jasmine. "I mean," she added, "=
that I never again will=20

   CHAPTER L.  A=20

DAZZLING DAY.   Mrs. Ellsworthy felt very much excited when Miss Egerton le=
ft her. She paced=20

up and down her pretty boudoir, her cheeks were flushed and her pretty eyes=
 bore traces of tears.=20

Miss Egerton had told the good little lady for the first time the sad story=
 of Daisy's terrible=20

adventure with Mr. Dove. All the poor little child's terror, and her final =
flight into the country, were=20

graphically described by the good woman.  "She went to find me, little darl=
ing, little darling,"=20

repeated Mrs. Ellsworthy, tears running down her cheeks. "Oh, my dear littl=
e girl! to think of her=20

being turned away from my very gates."  When Miss Egerton at last took her =
leave Mrs. Ellsworthy=20

felt too much excited to stay quiet; and when her husband came into the roo=
m he found her much=20

perturbed.  "Joseph," she said, running up to him, "I have such a story for=
 you," and then she once=20

again repeated little Daisy's adventure.  "And Joseph," she added, "Miss Eg=
erton and I have quite=20

agreed that you and I are to educate the girls; and, Joseph, the dear good =
creature is resolved that=20

they shall stay with her in town, and that you and I are only to have the p=
leasure of spending any=20

amount of money on them; but I will not have it. Joseph, I am resolved that=
 they shall come to us=20



at Shortlands, and have the instructions of the very best governess I can p=
rocure for them, and=20

then in the spring the darlings shall come up to town, and have masters for=
 every conceivable sort=20

of accomplishment. Oh, Joseph, we shall have our Jasmine yet, as our very o=
wn."  Mr. Ellsworthy=20

smiled, kissed his wife, patted her on the cheek, told her to do just what =
she liked, and went=20

downstairs to his beloved books. But Mrs. Ellsworthy's excitement kept her =
on thorns for the=20

greater part of the evening.  That night she dreamt of the Mainwarings; dre=
amt that she saw=20

Daisy's piteous little face when she was turned away from her gates; dreamt=
 again a brighter=20

dream, that Jasmine had her arms round her neck, and was calling her mother=
; that Primrose, with=20

none of her sweet dignity abated, was smiling at her, and saying gratefully=
, "I accept your=20

kindness; I will gladly take your money; I will come and live with you at S=
hortlands, and be to you=20

as a daughter." And Daisy was saying, in that funny little sententious voic=
e of hers which she=20

sometimes used, "Weren't we all naughty, and aren't we good now, and is it =
not a good thing that=20

our pride should have a fall?"  Mrs. Ellsworthy sighed deeply when she awok=
e from this beautiful=20

dream.  "It was but a dream," she said to herself, and she went downstairs =
sadly and soberly to=20

her breakfast.  Mr. Ellsworthy had breakfasted at a much earlier hour, and =
the little lady had her=20

beautifully-appointed table to herself.  "Now, if the girls were all here,"=
 she thought, "how pleasant=20

and cheerful it would be! Primrose should sit just opposite to me, and pour=
 out the coffee; she=20

would do it very nicely and deftly, and would look so sweet      Project Gu=

suppose she would keep the same seat two mornings running, and I should hav=
e to tell her over=20

and over not to jump up every moment to rush to the window. Daisy would sit=
 near me, and, of=20

course, I should have to have a special chair made for that funny kitten of=
 hers. I would dress the=20

three girls in white--white is so sweet for girls--and how Jasmine and Dais=
y would chatter; their=20

voices are very sweet in tone, and they never talk too fast, so as to make =
one's head ache. I often=20

fancy I hear Jasmine talking to me now, her voice is so bright--and--oh, de=
ar! is not that very like=20

her voice? Who is that asking for me in the hall? Surely, surely, it must b=
e Jasmine Mainwaring.=20

No other voice that I know has such a ring about it."  Mrs. Ellsworthy half=
 rose from her seat, half=20

sat down again, and the color of eager anticipation flushed her cheeks.  Th=
e eager voice outside=20

came nearer, light steps sounded in the hall, and the next moment Jasmine h=
ad her arms round=20

her friend's neck, and was kissing her, while both woman and girl wept.  "I=
 had to come to you,"=20

said Jasmine, while she wiped some bright falling tears away. "I have not c=
ome to stay, nor to give=20

you our address, nor to do anything of which Primrose would not approve; bu=
t after Miss Egerton=20

told me last night all that you wanted to do for us, and how you still love=
d us, I just had to run=20

round and thank you and kiss you. Primrose and Daisy are still in the count=
ry, and Daisy is better.=20

Aren't you glad she will be all right again soon?"  "Have breakfast with me=
, Jasmine," said Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy. "I was thinking so much about you, and so longing to see you, a=
nd to have you in the=20

room seems like a beautiful dream realized. Sit down now and have some brea=
kfast with me."  "I=20

did not have any at home, so I will," answered Jasmine. "I stayed awake hal=
f the night thinking=20

about you. Oh, you are a real, real friend!"  "And I spent the greater part=
 of the night dreaming=20

about you three girls," said Mrs. Ellsworthy. "Have some buttered toast, Ja=
smine, and some of this=20

apricot preserve."  "Did you dream about us last night?" asked Jasmine. "Di=
d you really? You must=20

love us very much."  "I believe I do. Now, Jasmine, I will not ask you for =
your address. I will do=20

nothing more to really help you until we get Primrose's letter, but I want =
you all the same to spend=20

this whole long day with me."  Jasmine smiled, and her cheeks flushed.  "It=
 would be very=20

luxurious," she said, "and such a change from our attics, although Daisy do=
es call them a Palace=20

Beautiful. Will you take me for a drive, if I stay, Mrs. Ellsworthy, and wi=
ll you let me imagine myself=20

quite a rich little girl all day long? You must not give me any presents, y=
ou know, for Primrose=20

would not like that; but I can imagine I have got all kinds of things, and =
I wonder, oh! I wonder, if=20

we might call to see Poppy this afternoon?"  "We will take her too for a dr=
ive in the Park," said Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy. "I have heard a great deal of that Poppy of yours, and I think =
she is quite a splendid=20

kind of girl."  Thus a very delightful programme was unexpectedly realized =
by two little hard-

working London girls, for Mrs. Ellsworthy gave herself up to be enchanting,=
 and took Poppy away=20

from her work of drudgery, and from the astonished ladies of the boarding-h=
ouse.  Poppy, in her=20

dazzlingly brilliant hat, and with her cheeks quite flaming with excitement=
, stepped into the=20

carriage, and drove away, facing Mrs. Ellsworthy and Jasmine, to the great =
scandal of the=20

footman, who was obliged, sorely against his will, to assist her to her pla=
ce.  Mrs. Ellsworthy took=20

the girls all round the Park, and then to a place of amusement, and finally=
 she presented Poppy=20

with a very neat brown dress and jacket, and hat to match, saying, as she d=
id so, that really=20

Jasmine, even though she forbade her to offer her any presents, could not l=
ay a like embargo with=20

regard to her friends.  "It's of all the dazzlings, the most blindingly bea=
utiful," was Poppy's oft-

reiterated comment. "Oh! won't I have something to tell them ladies about b=
ye-and-bye! Oh, my!=20



Miss Jasmine, what a neat hat, miss! I don't mind denuding this one now, fo=
r I has got a 'at from a=20

West End shop what beats anything that Miss Slowcum wears for gentility."  =
Finally, Jasmine and=20

Poppy both returned to their respective homes, tired, but wonderfully happy=
 little girls.  Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy also laid her head that night on her pillow with a wonderful sen=
se of satisfaction.  "Even=20

if they do not come to me--although they must come," she soliloquized, "I a=
m glad--I shall all my=20

life be glad that I gave Jasmine a happy day."     CHAPTER LI.  A LETTER.  =
 A morning or two=20

after this, when Daisy had greatly advanced towards convalescence, and was =
sitting up in=20

Hannah's tiny little sitting-room to partake of a very dainty little breakf=
ast, Primrose received a long=20

letter from Miss Egerton. This was what it contained:--  "MY DEAR PRIMROSE,=
  "You of course=20

know that that wicked man Dove has received the sentence which he so richly=
 deserves. Alas, we=20

cannot get back all the stolen money, but we must manage without it, dear, =
and you are never=20

even to talk of repaying me for the furnishing of dear little Daisy's Palac=
e Beautiful. It has been a=20

joy to me to have you, dear, and I hope you will be able to bring Daisy bac=
k with you, and to live=20

here in peace and comfort next winter. Dear Primrose, it is more and more e=
vident to me that=20

young girls should not venture to come to London alone. You showed much bra=
very in your=20

undertaking; but, my dear girl, the pitfalls you exposed yourselves to were=
 awful to contemplate. I=20

don't want to make you unhappy, dear, after all you have suffered with rega=
rd to Daisy, but I must=20

now tell you of a little adventure which our poor dear Jasmine has had. You=
 know how very=20

anxious she has been to see herself in print. Of course, I could not consci=
entiously encourage her,=20

for although she may have talent (this I am not prepared to say), yet she i=
s a great deal too young=20

to have anything printed. All books worth anything should teach, and surely=
 our dear little girl is=20

only at the age to be taught herself.  "Well, Primrose, the little maid was=
 fired with the strongest=20

ambition. She wrote her novel in secret, and one day, accompanied by that g=
ood-natured Poppy=20

Jenkins and sweet little Daisy, went Citywards, and simply plunged--for I c=
an use no other word--

into the unknown and to me rather awful realm of publishers.  "Poor child, =
of course none of the=20

good houses would even look at her immature productions; but she was taken =
in by a man who=20

professed himself to be the editor of a monthly paper--_The Joy-bell_ was i=
ts silly title. On an=20

understanding that her story was to be printed in the pages of _The Joy-bel=
l_--of course I've never=20

seen the paper, and should not dream of reading anything so rubbishy--poor =
Jasmine was induced=20

to subscribe two pounds five shillings, or, in other words, to undertake to=
 buy one hundred copies=20

of _The Joy-bell_. Of course she imagined that her printed words would imme=
diately bring her=20

fame. She paid her money, and looked out for her story."  "Where did she ge=
t the money from?"=20

thought the anxious reader.  "Primrose, how wrinkled up your brows are;" ca=
lled out little Daisy.=20

Primrose sighed, and resumed her perusal of the closely-written sheets.  "O=
n the very evening our=20

little Daisy ran away Jasmine received her first proofs. They were barbarou=
sly printed on wretched=20

paper, but the poor child was in such trouble then that she scarcely notice=
d them. Afterwards she=20

did read them with care, and was surprised to find what a very small portio=
n of her story had been=20

printed.  "You know that I was unexpectedly detained in the country by the =
serious illness and=20

death of my poor cousin. Jasmine was not doing as well as we supposed by he=
r profession of=20

dressing dinner-tables. The dear child was determined not to ask help from =
any one, not even=20

from you, Primrose, and she made a valiant effort to support herself on her=
 tiny earnings. Alas, her=20

purse was all too soon emptied, and she had also upon her the awful load of=
 debt, for Poppy=20



Jenkins it seems, lent her the money to get that rubbishy story published. =
In her despair she=20

thought of _The Joy-bell_, and went off to see the editor.  "She was met at=
 the office (poor child,=20

how she could venture there alone is a mystery to me) with the intelligence=
 that _The Joy-bell_=20

had ceased to exist, and the editor had decamped with poor Poppy's wages.  =
"Luckily I came=20

home that evening, and found your poor little sister in sad trouble. I am t=
hankful to say I have been=20

able to relieve her present necessities without the slightest inconvenience=
 to myself. Jasmine has=20

been greatly shaken, but she is better again now, and is most anxious that =
you should not be=20

troubled. I only tell you this much, dear Primrose, because I consider it m=
y bounden duty that you=20

should know how matters really stand. Rest happy about Poppy; her money has=
 been returned to=20

her, and Jasmine has sufficient for her present necessities. On second thou=
ghts, I had better=20

perhaps let you into my little secret. I have borrowed ten pounds for Jasmi=
ne on that valuable=20

Spanish lace of her mother's. Do not imagine that the lace is gone; it will=
 be returned to Jasmine=20

whenever she can refund the money. It was necessary, dear Primrose, to take=
 it, and I acted as I=20

am sure you would think right in the matter. Poppy had to be paid her wages=
.  "Now, dear=20

Primrose, I want to talk with you very seriously on another matter. You mus=
t own, dear, that=20

though you have tried bravely you have not yet, any of you, succeeded in ea=
rning your living. It is=20

almost a year since you began to try, and you have made, I fear, but small =
headway. You,=20

Primrose, have done best, and have made fewer mistakes than your sisters, b=
ut even you would=20

not care to spend all your life in continual reading to Mrs. Mortlock. Jasm=
ine can only earn a=20

precarious and uncertain living by dressing dinner-tables. Of course, no on=
e even expects dear=20

little Daisy to contribute to the family purse at present, but at the same =
time she need not put us=20

into terrible frights, nor be in the power of wicked and designing people. =
My dear girls have had a=20

trial of their own way; and now I think they ought to take the advice of th=
ose older and wiser than=20

themselves.  "If, dear Primrose, you want to earn your living well--and not=
hing makes a woman=20

braver and better than being able to support herself--you must be educated =
to take up some one=20

profession in an efficient manner. Money must be spent for this purpose, an=
d you must not be too=20

proud to accept money from those who really love you. I have been to see Mr=
s. Ellsworthy, and=20

she and I had a long, long talk about you girls. She is full of kindness, a=
nd she really and truly=20

loves you. It would be worse than folly, it would be wicked, to throw such =
friendship away. Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy tells me that she has been consulting your old friend Mr. Danesf=
ield about you. Both he=20

and Mrs. Ellsworthy are arranging plans which they trust you will all liste=
n to with patience. These=20

plans shall be fully disclosed to you on your return to town, but I may as =
well mention here that it=20

will be absolutely necessary that you should give up your present lives, an=
d should enter seriously=20

on the great work of education. Money must be spent for this object; but wh=
en you are able to earn=20

well, bye-and-bye it will be in your power to repay the money to the kind f=
riends whose happiness=20

it is now to lend it to you.         "Dear Primrose,      "I am, yours affe=
ctionately,          "AGNES=20

EGERTON."   There was much in this letter to pain Primrose, and a year befo=
re she might have=20

torn it up and determined in no way to be guided by it; but a year had brou=
ght her some very=20

strange and some very sad experiences. She was troubled and shocked to thin=
k that Jasmine=20

should have taken poor Poppy's hard earnings. She was deeply distressed at =
owing herself so=20

much to Miss Egerton, and now also so large a debt to Arthur Noel. She had =
worked hard, and=20

had done wonderfully well considering, but nevertheless at the present mome=
nt, owing to adverse=20



circumstances, she was plunged in debt in many directions, and saw little h=
ope of repaying what=20

she owed. Life seemed very difficult to Primrose just then, and hot tears r=
ose to her eyes.  Should=20

she go still farther in debt, and give up the great struggle to be independ=
ent? Oh, no, she could=20

not--she could not. Her pride rose up in rebellion; her passionate longing =
to be free and her own=20

mistress, to be beholden to no one for the necessaries of life, was too str=
ong to be easily crushed.=20

Better the dullest life, better be a "continual reader" all her days than t=
ake the money of strangers.=20

This was her feeling, and it grew so strong moment by moment, that she migh=
t have sat down to=20

answer Miss Egerton's letter there and then but for a rather innocent littl=
e remark made by Daisy.=20

"Dear Primrose, I forgot it in all the other great trouble, but I do want t=
o send fifteen shillings as=20

soon as possible to dear good Poppy. She lent me fifteen shillings to buy a=
 single third to come to=20

Rosebury, and I forgot all about it. Please, Primrose, try and spare me fif=
teen shillings to send to=20

Poppy."  "So you too are in debt, Daisy," said Primrose. "Oh, dear, what sh=
all I do? Daisy, dear,=20

forgive me, I ought not to mind anything now you are growing better, but my=
 heart is heavy, and I=20

feel almost crushed. Yes, Daisy, dear Poppy must have her money. I won't wr=
ite to Miss Egerton=20

until to-morrow."  Here Primrose wiped some tears from her sweet brown eyes=
, but she took good=20

care not to allow Daisy to see that she was crying.     CHAPTER LII.  "I LO=
VE MRS.=20

ELLSWORTHY."   The next afternoon, to the surprise of both Primrose and Dai=
sy, Noel arrived.=20

Daisy greeted her Prince with rapture, but refused to hear any particulars =
of Dove's trial.  "I want to=20

forget him," she said. "You say he is in the dungeon now. I don't want to t=
hink of it. If I think of it=20

long I shall begin to be so sorry for him."  "We will talk of something bet=
ter and pleasanter," said=20

Noel. "How soon are you coming back to your Palace Beautiful, little Prince=
ss?"  Daisy looked=20

anxiously across the room at Primrose. Primrose was bending over some needl=
ework, and a ray=20

of sunlight was shining on her fair head. She did not raise her eyes or res=
pond in any way to the=20

little sister's glance.  "We did think of coming back to Miss Egerton's in =
the autumn," said Daisy,=20

"but last night Primrose--May I tell, Primrose?"  Primrose put down her wor=
k suddenly and came=20

up to where Noel and Daisy were sitting.  "It is just this," she said; "Dai=
sy did not know she had=20

such a proud and obstinate sister. We had made our plans for the autumn--at=
 least we simply=20

intended to struggle on, and hope and watch for brighter days--but yesterda=
y I had a letter from=20

Miss Egerton, and some of its contents troubled me a good deal. Daisy saw t=
hat I was unhappy,=20

and I told her what Miss Egerton wanted. I thought the dear little one woul=
d object, but she only=20

said, 'Oh, let us be brave, Primrose; our Palace Beautiful will be all the =
brighter if we really earn it.'=20

Then she added, 'I am beginning to wish to earn a little money myself, for =
I want to give a very=20

kind person back what he gave me.'"  Noel gave Daisy's thin little hand a s=
queeze. Primrose=20

looked at the two, and stopped speaking. After a moment's pause she said su=
ddenly--  "I don't like=20

the plan; I never can like it. Mrs. Ellsworthy is all that is kind, but she=
 is no relation of ours. She=20

lived in the same place with us for years, and she never even called on our=
 mother. Oh, I don't=20

blame her; she naturally thought that people who lived in an humble little =
cottage at Rosebury=20

were not ladies, but you see we are ladies, and we cannot help feeling sore=
. I may agree to the=20

plan--I may be forced to agree to it for Jasmine's and Daisy's sakes--but I=
 can never, never like it."=20

Here Primrose went out of the room.  "She was crying for a long time last n=
ight," whispered Daisy;=20

"it hurts her dreadfully to take Mrs. Ellsworthy's money. I don't suppose I=
 mind it so much, because=20

I was coming to Mrs. Ellsworthy to ask her for some money. I did not find h=
er, and I was miserable=20



until you found me and helped me, Prince. Then I love Mrs. Ellsworthy, and =
so does Jasmine."=20

"That is it, Eyebright," answered Noel; "we do not mind receiving kindnesse=
s and favors from=20

those we love. Yes, I am very sorry for Primrose; I wish matters could be d=
ifferently arranged for=20

her."  While Noel was speaking Hannah came into the room with a cup of beef=
-tea for the little=20

invalid.  "You have done her a sight of good already, sir," she said, peeri=
ng with her short-sighted=20

eyes into the young man's face. "I don't know what we'd have done for her i=
f you hadn't come that=20

day, and talked to her, and got her to tell you what that most villainous p=
erson in London was=20

after."  "Oh, don't, Hannah," said Daisy, "he's in a dungeon now--poor, poo=
r Mr. Dove; I must not=20

think about him if I mean to get well."  Here Daisy shivered, and added und=
er her breath, with her=20

little pale face working--  "I did promise it very faithfully that I would =
never tell about the=20

sweetmeats."  "He was a bad man, Daisy, and he richly deserves his punishme=
nt," said Noel, in=20

an almost stern voice, for he wished to check any unhealthy sentimentality =
on the part of the=20

delicate child. "You must think of what you and your sisters have suffered,=
 and be glad he has=20

been prevented doing any more mischief."  "Drink up your beef-tea, missy," =
said Hannah. "Please,=20

Mr. Noel, sir, will you hold the cup for little miss? Oh, my heart alive, w=
hat--what is that?"  "I don't=20

see anything," said Noel, "what has frightened you, Hannah?"  But Hannah ha=
d grown white, and=20

looked very queer, and a moment after she hurried out of the room.  "I neve=
r knew your servant=20

was nervous," said Noel to Daisy.  "Nervous?" she repeated, laughing merril=
y. "Is it Hannah? why=20

she always says she hasn't a nerve in her whole body. She's sometimes almos=
t cross with me for=20

being nervous, Mr. Prince."  Noel stayed some little time longer with the s=
isters, and then returned=20

to Rosebury in time to catch the evening train to London. When he got there=
 he went straight to=20

Mrs. Ellsworthy's house. That little lady was anxiously expecting him, and =
plied him with many=20

questions on the spot.  "How is she taking it, Arthur?" she asked. "I have =
been forming and=20

maturing my plans, and I now think a resident governess at Shortlands would=
 be the nicest=20

arrangement for the girls. They cannot be parted, that is very evident, and=
 as Primrose must be=20

more than eighteen she would not care to go to school. Yes, a resident gove=
rness seems the plan=20

of plans. I would take them up to London early in the spring, and give them=
 the advantage of the=20

very best masters."  "Primrose seems very unhappy about it," replied Noel. =
"She may in the end=20

consent to some scheme for perfecting her education, but I'm quite sure she=
 will not go, nor allow=20

her sisters to go to Shortlands to live a life of simple luxury. I am sorry=
 for you, Mrs. Ellsworthy, but=20

I know Primrose will never consent to that."  "I don't think you are sorry =
for me, Arthur," answered=20

the pretty little lady. "In your heart of hearts you quite agree with that =
naughty, bad Primrose. You=20

had rather the girls lived in their attic, and encountered another dreadful=
 Mr. Dove, and fell into the=20

hands of another designing publisher, than have them safe and happy at Shor=
tlands. Oh, it is a=20

plot between you all to deprive me of my great pleasure. Oh, why will girls=
, and young men, too,=20

be so perverse?"  Noel smiled.  "I am sorry for both you and Primrose," he =
said. "I am convinced=20

she will never agree to your present scheme, although she may allow you to =
help her to perfect=20

her education."     CHAPTER LIII.  TELEGRAPH WIRES.   Daisy was quite right=
 when she said=20

that Hannah was not subject to nervous attacks. Hannah scorned nerves, and =
did not believe in=20

them. When she was told that the human body was as full of nerves as an ele=
ctric battery was full=20

of electricity, that nerves, in short, were like numberless telegraphic-wir=
es, prevailing the whole=20

human frame, she stared at the speakers, and pronounced them slightly daft.=
  Yet Hannah went=20



out of her own little sitting-room on that summer afternoon with, as she ex=
pressed it, trembling=20

sensations running down her back, and causing her fingers to shake when she=
 handled her cups=20

and saucers.  "Dear, dear," she said to herself, "one would think I had som=
e of those awful=20

telegrams in me which Miss Primrose said was the nervous system. Why, I'm a=
ll upset from top to=20

toe. I never had a good view of him before, for I didn't pay no heed to nob=
ody when my dear little=20

Miss Daisy was so ill; but I do say that the cut of the hand and the turn o=
f the head is as like--as=20

like as two peas. Now I do wonder--no, no, it can't be. Well, anyhow, my na=
me ain't Hannah Martin=20

if I don't find out where he comes from, and who he really is. Well, well, =
well--why this trembling=20

won't leave me, and I don't dare go back into the room. I suppose I have go=
t a few telegraphs, and=20

I mustn't never laugh at poor little Miss Daisy again when she says she's n=
ervous."  Hannah sat=20

and rested for about half an hour--then she drank off a glass of cold water=
--then she washed her=20

face and hands--then she said aloud that the telegrams should not get the b=
etter of her, and then=20

she prepared as nice a little dinner as she could for Noel and the two sist=
ers.  That evening, after=20

Daisy was in bed, she came into the room where Primrose was quietly reading=
.  "You haven't=20

never come across no one the least like that brother of yours in the London=
 streets, Miss=20

Primrose?" she asked. "London's a big place, and strange things happen ther=
e--yes, very, very=20

strange things."  "Oh, Hannah, how you startle me!" said Primrose. "I come =
across my poor little=20

brother Arthur? How could I? Why, he must be dead for many and many a year.=
"  "Not a bit of=20

him," said Hannah; "I don't believe he's dead. He was a fine, hearty, stron=
g child, and nothing ever=20

seemed to ail him. Oh, it rises up before me now what a beautiful picture h=
e made when he stood=20

in his little red velvet dress by your mamma's knee, and she so proud of hi=
m! There's no mistake,=20

but he was the very light of her eyes. She took him up to London, and a nur=
semaid--not me, you=20

may be quite sure--took him out. She went into a big shop, and the child wa=
s by her side. She kept=20

him standing by her as she ordered some things across the counter, and, I s=
uppose, she turned=20

her head for a minute, for when she looked round again he was gone. From th=
at day to this he=20

was never heard of, though everything you can think of was done. Oh, my poo=
r, poor mistress,=20

what she did suffer!"  "Hannah, how excited you look!" said Primrose. "Why,=
 you are all trembling.=20

It is a terrible story, but as I say to Daisy about Mr. Dove, don't let us =
think of it."  "Right you are,=20

honey," said Hannah; "what can't be cured, you know. If you don't mind, Mis=
s Primrose, I'll just sit=20

down for a minute. I'm not to say quite myself. Oh, it ain't nothing, deari=
e; just a bit of the trembles,=20

and to prove to old Hannah that she is getting on in years. I nursed you al=
l, darling--him, my=20

beautiful boy, and you three. Miss Primrose, dear, how old would you say th=
at Mr. Noel was. I=20

didn't have a fair look at him until to-day, and he seems quite a young sor=
t of man."  "Miss Egerton=20

says that he is twenty-six, Hannah."  "Twenty-six," answered Hannah; "don't=
 interrupt me for a=20

minute, dear. I'm comparing dates--twenty-six--twenty-six. Law, goodness gr=
acious me! You=20

haven't never noticed, Miss Primrose, that he have a kind of a mole--long-s=
haped, and rather big,=20

a little way up his left arm? Have you, now, dearies?"  "No, really, Hannah=
, I've never seen Mr.=20

Noel's arm without his coat-sleeve. How very queerly you are speaking, Hann=
ah."  "Not at all,=20

dearie; it's only because I've got the trembles on me. Well, love, and so y=
ou don't want to be under=20

no compliments to that Mrs. Ellsworthy, who never took no notice of your po=
or dear ma?"=20

Primrose sighed.  "I feel sore about it, Hannah," she said. "But I must try=
 not to be too proud. I will=20

ask God to help me to do what is really right in the matter."  "That's it, =
honey, and maybe you won't=20



have to do it after all. I wonder, now, dear, if Mr. Noel is well off."  "R=
eally, Hannah, I think you=20

have got Mr. Noel on the brain! Yes, I have heard Miss Egerton say that he =
is a rich man. He was=20

the adopted son of a very wealthy person, who left him all his property."  =
"Adopted, was he?" said=20

Hannah. "On my word, these tremblings are terrible! Miss Primrose, dear, I =
have come in to say=20

that I may be going a little journey in the morning. I'll be off by the fir=
st dawn, so as to be back by=20

night, and the shop needn't be opened at all to-morrow. There's a nice cold=
 roast fowl for you and=20

Miss Daisy, and a dish of strawberries which I gathered with my own hands n=
ot an hour back, so=20

you'll have no trouble with your dinner. You see that Miss Daisy eats plent=
y of cream with her=20

strawberries, dear, for cream's fattening; and now good-night."     CHAPTER=
 LIV.  A DISCOVERY.=20

Hannah Martin had never been much of a traveller. It was years since she se=
t her foot inside a=20

railway carriage. She often boasted of her abnormal lack of nerves, but she=
 was also heard to say=20

that accidents by rail were fearful and common, and likely to happen at any=
 moment. She sighed=20

for the old coaching days, and hated the thought of all locomotives propell=
ed by steam.=20

Nevertheless, early in the morning of the day following her interview with =
Primrose, Hannah, in her=20

usual neat print dress, was seen to enter the little railway station at Ros=
ebury, was observed to=20

purchase for herself a third-class return ticket, and after carefully selec=
ting her carriage, to depart=20

for London.  In the afternoon of that same day Hannah reached her destinati=
on, and securing the=20

first porter whose attention she could arrest, she placed a bit of paper in=
 his hand, and asked him=20

to direct her to the address written upon it. The man screwed up his eyes, =
stared at the paper, and=20

suggested that Hannah should place herself in a hansom, and direct the driv=
er to take her to Park=20

Lane. Hannah had not an idea what a hansom meant; she had never visited Lon=
don since her=20

early days. She stared with horror at the proposed vehicle, and finally sel=
ecting the creakiest and=20

most uninviting of the four-wheelers, drove off to her destination.  Mrs. E=
llsworthy was enjoying=20

some very fragrant tea in her little boudoir when a servant announced that =
a person of the name of=20

Martin had come up from the country in a four-wheeler, and would be glad to=
 see her as soon as=20

possible.  "What kind of person, Henry?" asked the little lady. "I am very =
tired just now, and I must=20

go out to dinner in less than two hours. A person from the country in a fou=
r-wheeler? What can=20

she want with me?"  "She seems a respectable sort of body, ma'am," answered=
 the footman, "but=20

nervous and shaky, and mortal afraid to step out of the cab; the cabby and =
me we had both to lend=20

her a hand in alighting, ma'am. She's sitting now in a chair in the hall, a=
nd I can see she's upset=20

with her journey, but _respectable_; there's no word for the neatness of he=
r person, ma'am."  "She=20

is probably poor, and wants me to help her," replied Mrs. Ellsworthy. "I ha=
te seeing beggars, for I=20

find it absolutely impossible to say _no_ to them. Show her up, Henry, and =
give her a hint that I'm=20

going out to dinner, and can only spare her a very few moments."  Hannah co=
uld not certainly be=20

accused when she entered Mrs. Ellsworthy's room, of any want of nerves. Her=
 hands were=20

shaking, her lips were tremulous, and her face, as she entered the room, be=
came perfectly white.=20

"You'll excuse me, ma'am," she said. "I'm most sorry to trouble you, but I'=
m that anxious, I scarce=20

know what I'm doing. I undertook a railway journey--which I don't think rig=
ht--and I came here=20

through most crowded streets in a dreadful vehicle, for I just wanted to as=
k you a single question,=20

ma'am."  "Sit down, my poor woman," said Mrs. Ellsworthy, who, the moment s=
he looked at=20

Hannah, began to have a dim sort of idea that she had seen her before, and =
also became full of=20

pity for her. "Sit down. How you tremble! I am sorry to see you are so nerv=
ous."  "Nervous,=20



ma'am!" echoed Hannah. "That I should hear that said of me! No, ma'am, it a=
in't nervous I am, but=20

I'm rather worried with the tremblings during the last few hours. I've come=
 to ask you a plain=20

question, ma'am, plain and direct. It's about the young man Mr. Noel. Have =
he, ma'am, or have he=20

not, a mole on his left arm? I'd like yes or no, ma'am."  "A mole on his le=
ft arm!" echoed Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy. "My good woman, what a very extraordinary question; you really =
quite startle me. Has=20

Arthur Noel a mole on his left arm? Yes, of course he has; I used to notice=
 it when he was a child.=20

I suppose people don't outgrow moles, so he probably has it still. Why, Mrs=
. Martin--I am told your=20

name is Martin--how very white you are. Would you--would you like a glass o=
f wine?"  "Thank you,=20

ma'am--no wine, thank you, ma'am. I'm a bit upset. Yes, I'm a bit upset, fo=
r I believe Mr. Arthur=20

Noel is my long-lost baby."  The footman downstairs had given Mrs. Martin c=
areful directions not to=20

occupy more than a moment or two of his mistress's valuable time; but thoug=
h he waited on the=20

stairs and lingered about in the entrance-hall, no bell number is 64-622154=

David Widger with the help of Derek Andrew's text from January 1992 and the=
 work of Bryan=20

Taylor in November 2002.      Book 28        Hosea  28:001:001 The word of =
the LORD that came=20

unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,            in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Aha=
z, and Hezekiah, kings of=20

Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of            Isr=
ael.  28:001:002 The=20

beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD            said to=
 Hosea, Go, take unto=20

thee a wife of whoredoms and            children of whoredoms: for the land=
 hath committed great=20

whoredom, departing from the LORD.  28:001:003 So he went and took Gomer th=
e daughter of=20

Diblaim; which            conceived, and bare him a son.  28:001:004 And th=
e LORD said unto him,=20

Call his name Jezreel; for yet a            little while, and I will avenge=
 the blood of Jezreel upon the=20

house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the            house =
of Israel.  28:001:005 And=20

it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the            bow of =
Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.=20

28:001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said      =
      unto him, Call=20

her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have            mercy upon the house=
 of Israel; but I will=20

utterly take them            away.  28:001:007 But I will have mercy upon t=
he house of Judah, and will=20

save            them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, =
nor            by sword, nor=20

by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.  28:001:008 Now when she had weaned =
Loruhamah, she=20

conceived, and bare a            son.  28:001:009 Then said God, Call his n=
ame Loammi: for ye are=20

not my people,            and I will not be your God.  28:001:010 Yet the n=
umber of the children of=20

Israel shall be as the sand            of the sea, which cannot be measured=
 nor numbered; and it=20

shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto            the=
m, Ye are not my people,=20

there it shall be said unto them,            Ye are the sons of the living =
God.  28:001:011 Then shall=20



the children of Judah and the children of Israel be            gathered tog=
ether, and appoint=20

themselves one head, and they            shall come up out of the land: for=
 great shall be the day of=20

Jezreel.  28:002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, =
Ruhamah.  28:002:002=20

Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither            a=
m I her husband: let her=20

therefore put away her whoredoms out            of her sight, and her adult=
eries from between her=20

breasts;  28:002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that=
 she was            born,=20

and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry            land, and s=
lay her with thirst.=20

28:002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the    =
        children of=20

whoredoms.  28:002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that co=
nceived            them=20

hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my            lovers, t=
hat give me my bread and my=20

water, my wool and my            flax, mine oil and my drink.  28:002:006 T=
herefore, behold, I will=20

hedge up thy way with thorns, and            make a wall, that she shall no=
t find her paths.=20

28:002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not        =
    overtake them; and she=20

shall seek them, but shall not find            them: then shall she say, I =
will go and return to my first=20

husband; for then was it better with me than now.  28:002:008 For she did n=
ot know that I gave her=20

corn, and wine, and oil,            and multiplied her silver and gold, whi=
ch they prepared for=20

Baal.  28:002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the tim=
e            thereof, and my=20

wine in the season thereof, and will recover            my wool and my flax=
 given to cover her=20

nakedness.  28:002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of=
 her            lovers, and=20

none shall deliver her out of mine hand.  28:002:011 I will also cause all =
her mirth to cease, her=20

feast days, her            new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn =
feasts.  28:002:012 And I=20

will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she            hath said,=
 These are my rewards that=20

my lovers have given me:            and I will make them a forest, and the =
beasts of the field=20

shall eat them.  28:002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, w=
herein she            burned=20

incense to them, and she decked herself with her            earrings and he=
r jewels, and she went=20

after her lovers, and            forgat me, saith the LORD.  28:002:014 The=
refore, behold, I will allure=20

her, and bring her into the            wilderness, and speak comfortably un=
to her.  28:002:015 And I=20

will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley            of Achor=
 for a door of hope: and she=20

shall sing there, as in            the days of her youth, and as in the day=
 when she came up out=20

of the land of Egypt.  28:002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LO=
RD, that thou shalt=20

call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.  28:002:017 For I will take =
away the names of Baalim=20

out of her mouth, and            they shall no more be remembered by their =
name.  28:002:018 And=20

in that day will I make a covenant for them with the            beasts of t=
he field and with the fowls of=20

heaven, and with the            creeping things of the ground: and I will b=
reak the bow and            the=20

sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them            to lie=
 down safely.  28:002:019=20

And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth            th=
ee unto me in righteousness,=20

and in judgment, and in            lovingkindness, and in mercies.  28:002:=
020 I will even betroth thee=20

unto me in faithfulness: and thou            shalt know the LORD.  28:002:0=
21 And it shall come to=20

pass in that day, I will hear, saith the            LORD, I will hear the h=
eavens, and they shall hear the=20

earth;  28:002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the=
 oil;            and they=20

shall hear Jezreel.  28:002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; an=
d I will have mercy=20

upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them            whi=
ch were not my people,=20



Thou art my people; and they shall            say, Thou art my God.  28:003=
:001 Then said the LORD=20

unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of            her friend, yet an adul=
teress, according to the=20

love of the            LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to othe=
r gods,            and love=20

flagons of wine.  28:003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of si=
lver, and for an=20

homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:  28:003:003 And I said unto h=
er, Thou shalt abide for=20

me many days; thou            shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not=
 be for another            man:=20

so will I also be for thee.  28:003:004 For the children of Israel shall ab=
ide many days without a=20

king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and            without=
 an image, and without an=20

ephod, and without teraphim:  28:003:005 Afterward shall the children of Is=
rael return, and seek=20

the            LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LOR=
D            and his=20

goodness in the latter days.  28:004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye chil=
dren of Israel: for the=20

LORD            hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, becaus=
e            there is no truth,=20

nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the            land.  28:004:002 By swea=
ring, and lying, and=20

killing, and stealing, and            committing adultery, they break out, =
and blood toucheth blood.=20

28:004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth     =
       therein shall=20

languish, with the beasts of the field, and with            the fowls of he=
aven; yea, the fishes of the=20

sea also shall be            taken away.  28:004:004 Yet let no man strive,=
 nor reprove another: for=20

thy people are            as they that strive with the priest.  28:004:005 =
Therefore shalt thou fall in the=20

day, and the prophet also            shall fall with thee in the night, and=
 I will destroy thy=20

mother.  28:004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because =
thou            hast=20

rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou            shalt be =
no priest to me: seeing thou=20

hast forgotten the law            of thy God, I will also forget thy childr=
en.  28:004:007 As they were=20

increased, so they sinned against me: therefore            will I change th=
eir glory into shame.=20

28:004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on   =
         their iniquity.=20

28:004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will        =
    punish them for their ways,=20

and reward them their doings.  28:004:010 For they shall eat, and not have =
enough: they shall=20

commit            whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left =
off            to take heed to=20

the LORD.  28:004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.  =
28:004:012 My=20

people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff            declareth un=
to them: for the spirit of=20

whoredoms hath caused            them to err, and they have gone a whoring =
from under their=20

God.  28:004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn   =
         incense upon=20

the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,            because the shadow t=
hereof is good: therefore=20

your daughters            shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall com=
mit adultery.=20

28:004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,     =
       nor your=20

spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are            separated =
with whores, and they=20

sacrifice with harlots:            therefore the people that doth not under=
stand shall fall.  28:004:015=20

Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah            offend; =
and come not ye unto Gilgal,=20

neither go ye up to            Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.  28:00=
4:016 For Israel slideth=20

back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD            will feed them as a l=
amb in a large place.=20

28:004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.  28:004:018 Their dri=
nk is sour: they have=20

committed whoredom continually:            her rulers with shame do love, G=
ive ye.  28:004:019 The=20

wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be            ashamed b=
ecause of their=20



sacrifices.  28:005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of I=
srael; and            give ye=20

ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,            because ye=
 have been a snare on=20

Mizpah, and a net spread upon            Tabor.  28:005:002 And the revolte=
rs are profound to make=20

slaughter, though I            have been a rebuker of them all.  28:005:003=
 I know Ephraim, and=20

Israel is not hid from me: for now, O            Ephraim, thou committest w=
horedom, and Israel is=20

defiled.  28:005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their Go=
d: for            the spirit of=20

whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have            not known the L=
ORD.  28:005:005 And=20

the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore            shall Is=
rael and Ephraim fall in their=20

iniquity: Judah also            shall fall with them.  28:005:006 They shal=
l go with their flocks and with=20

their herds to seek            the LORD; but they shall not find him; he ha=
th withdrawn            himself=20

from them.  28:005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for =
they have=20

begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with            th=
eir portions.  28:005:008=20

Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry            alou=
d at Bethaven, after thee,=20

O Benjamin.  28:005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: amo=
ng the            tribes=20

of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.  28:005:010 The pri=
nces of Judah were=20

like them that remove the bound:            therefore I will pour out my wr=
ath upon them like water.=20

28:005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he         =
   willingly walked=20

after the commandment.  28:005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a mo=
th, and to the house=20

of Judah as rottenness.  28:005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda=
h saw his wound,=20

then            went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet  =
          could he not heal=20

you, nor cure you of your wound.  28:005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as =
a lion, and as a young=20

lion to            the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I =
will            take away, and none=20

shall rescue him.  28:005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they a=
cknowledge their=20

offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek            me=
 early.  28:006:001 Come, and=20

let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and            he will heal =
us; he hath smitten, and he=20

will bind us up.  28:006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third=
 day he will            raise us=20

up, and we shall live in his sight.  28:006:003 Then shall we know, if we f=
ollow on to know the=20

LORD: his            going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall c=
ome unto            us as the=20

rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.  28:006:004 O Ephraim, =
what shall I do unto=20

thee? O Judah, what shall I do            unto thee? for your goodness is a=
s a morning cloud, and as=20

the            early dew it goeth away.  28:006:005 Therefore have I hewed =
them by the prophets; I=20

have slain them            by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are =
as the light            that=20

goeth forth.  28:006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the kn=
owledge of            God=20

more than burnt offerings.  28:006:007 But they like men have transgressed =
the covenant: there=20

have            they dealt treacherously against me.  28:006:008 Gilead is =
a city of them that work=20

iniquity, and is polluted            with blood.  28:006:009 And as troops =
of robbers wait for a man, so=20

the company of            priests murder in the way by consent: for they co=
mmit            lewdness.=20

28:006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is  =
          the whoredom of=20

Ephraim, Israel is defiled.  28:006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harve=
st for thee, when I=20

returned the captivity of my people.  28:007:001 When I would have healed I=
srael, then the iniquity=20

of Ephraim            was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for th=
ey commit=20

falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers            spo=
ileth without.  28:007:002=20



And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all            their =
wickedness: now their own=20

doings have beset them about;            they are before my face.  28:007:0=
03 They make the king=20

glad with their wickedness, and the princes            with their lies.  28=
:007:004 They are all=20

adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who            ceaseth from rai=
sing after he hath=20

kneaded the dough, until it            be leavened.  28:007:005 In the day =
of our king the princes=20

have made him sick with            bottles of wine; he stretched out his ha=
nd with scorners.=20

28:007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they  =
          lie in wait: their=20

baker sleepeth all the night; in the            morning it burneth as a fla=
ming fire.  28:007:007 They=20

are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;            all thei=
r kings are fallen: there is=20

none among them that            calleth unto me.  28:007:008 Ephraim, he ha=
th mixed himself among=20

the people; Ephraim is a            cake not turned.  28:007:009 Strangers =
have devoured his=20

strength, and he knoweth it not:            yea, gray hairs are here and th=
ere upon him, yet he=20

knoweth            not.  28:007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to h=
is face: and they do=20

not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.  28:007:011 Ep=
hraim also is like a silly=20

dove without heart: they call to            Egypt, they go to Assyria.  28:=
007:012 When they shall go, I=20

will spread my net upon them; I will            bring them down as the fowl=
s of the heaven; I will=20

chastise            them, as their congregation hath heard.  28:007:013 Woe=
 unto them! for they have=20

fled from me: destruction unto            them! because they have transgres=
sed against me: though I=20

have            redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.  28:00=
7:014 And they have=20

not cried unto me with their heart, when they            howled upon their =
beds: they assemble=20

themselves for corn and            wine, and they rebel against me.  28:007=
:015 Though I have=20

bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they            imagine mischief =
against me.  28:007:016=20

They return, but not to the most High: they are like a            deceitful=
 bow: their princes shall fall by=20

the sword for the            rage of their tongue: this shall be their deri=
sion in the land            of Egypt.=20

28:008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle         =
   against the house of=20

the LORD, because they have transgressed            my covenant, and trespa=
ssed against my law.=20

28:008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.  28:008:003 Isra=
el hath cast off the=20

thing that is good: the enemy shall            pursue him.  28:008:004 They=
 have set up kings, but not=20

by me: they have made princes,            and I knew it not: of their silve=
r and their gold have they=20

made them idols, that they may be cut off.  28:008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria,=
 hath cast thee off;=20

mine anger is kindled            against them: how long will it be ere they=
 attain to            innocency?=20

28:008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it  =
          is not God: but the=20

calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.  28:008:007 For they have sown t=
he wind, and they shall=20

reap the            whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no mea=
l: if            so be it yield, the=20

strangers shall swallow it up.  28:008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shal=
l they be among the=20

Gentiles            as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.  28:008:009 For the=
y are gone up to Assyria, a=20

wild ass alone by himself:            Ephraim hath hired lovers.  28:008:01=
0 Yea, though they have=20

hired among the nations, now will I            gather them, and they shall =
sorrow a little for the burden=20

of            the king of princes.  28:008:011 Because Ephraim hath made ma=
ny altars to sin, altars=20

shall be            unto him to sin.  28:008:012 I have written to him the =
great things of my law, but=20

they            were counted as a strange thing.  28:008:013 They sacrifice=
 flesh for the sacrifices of=20

mine offerings, and            eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now=
 will he remember=20



their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to            Egypt=
.  28:008:014 For Israel hath=20

forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and            Judah hath multip=
lied fenced cities: but I will=20

send a fire            upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces the=
reof.  28:009:001 Rejoice not,=20

O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast            gone a whoring=
 from thy God, thou hast=20

loved a reward upon            every cornfloor.  28:009:002 The floor and t=
he winepress shall not=20

feed them, and the new            wine shall fail in her.  28:009:003 They =
shall not dwell in the=20

LORD's land; but Ephraim shall            return to Egypt, and they shall e=
at unclean things in=20

Assyria.  28:009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neith=
er shall            they be=20

pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them            as the br=
ead of mourners; all that eat=20

thereof shall be            polluted: for their bread for their soul shall =
not come into            the house=20

of the LORD.  28:009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day =
of the feast            of=20

the LORD?  28:009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt =
shall            gather=20

them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places            for their =
silver, nettles shall possess=20

them: thorns shall be            in their tabernacles.  28:009:007 The days=
 of visitation are come, the=20

days of recompence are            come; Israel shall know it: the prophet i=
s a fool, the            spiritual=20

man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and            the great h=
atred.  28:009:008 The=20

watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a            snare =
of a fowler in all his=20

ways, and hatred in the house of            his God.  28:009:009 They have =
deeply corrupted=20

themselves, as in the days of            Gibeah: therefore he will remember=
 their iniquity, he will=20

visit their sins.  28:009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness;=
 I saw your            fathers as=20

the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:            but they went t=
o Baalpeor, and separated=20

themselves unto that            shame; and their abominations were accordin=
g as they loved.=20

28:009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from    =
        the birth, and from the=20

womb, and from the conception.  28:009:012 Though they bring up their child=
ren, yet will I bereave=20

them,            that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them =
when            I depart from=20

them!  28:009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: =
but            Ephraim=20

shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  28:009:014 Give them, O LO=
RD: what wilt thou=20

give? give them a            miscarrying womb and dry breasts.  28:009:015 =
All their wickedness is in=20

Gilgal: for there I hated them: for            the wickedness of their doin=
gs I will drive them out of mine=20

house, I will love them no more: all their princes are            revolters=
.  28:009:016 Ephraim is=20

smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no            fruit: yea, =
though they bring forth, yet will I=20

slay even the            beloved fruit of their womb.  28:009:017 My God wi=
ll cast them away,=20

because they did not hearken unto            him: and they shall be wandere=
rs among the nations.=20

28:010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:  =
          according to the=20

multitude of his fruit he hath increased the            altars; according t=
o the goodness of his land=20

they have made            goodly images.  28:010:002 Their heart is divided=
; now shall they be found=20

faulty: he            shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their i=
mages.  28:010:003 For now=20

they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not            the LORD;=
 what then should a king=20

do to us?  28:010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a =
covenant:=20

thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the            fiel=
d.  28:010:005 The=20

inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of            Betha=
ven: for the people thereof=20

shall mourn over it, and the            priests thereof that rejoiced on it=
, for the glory thereof,=20



because it is departed from it.  28:010:006 It shall be also carried unto A=
ssyria for a present to king=20

Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be            ashamed =
of his own counsel.=20

28:010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the        =
    water.  28:010:008 The=20

high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be            destroyed:=
 the thorn and the thistle shall=20

come up on their            altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Co=
ver us; and to            the=20

hills, Fall on us.  28:010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of =
Gibeah: there they=20

stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity            did=
 not overtake them.=20

28:010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people  =
          shall be gathered=20

against them, when they shall bind            themselves in their two furro=
ws.  28:010:011 And=20

Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to            tread out =
the corn; but I passed over=20

upon her fair neck: I            will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plo=
w, and Jacob shall=20

break his clods.  28:010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in me=
rcy; break up=20

your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he            com=
e and rain righteousness=20

upon you.  28:010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; y=
e have            eaten=20

the=20


_
visitor. An hour passed away, an hour and a half, and still Mrs. Martin rem=
ained in close=20

conversation with Mrs. Ellsworthy. At the end of the hour and a half Henry =
looked earnestly at the=20

clock, sighed, and felt that it was his duty to go into the room to let Mrs=
. Ellsworthy know that she=20

would be late for her dinner-party. He found that good lady sitting by her =
writing-table with very=20

flushed cheeks and tearful eyes, and Hannah standing in quite a familiar at=
titude by her side.=20

"Give this note to Mr. Ellsworthy when he comes in, Henry, and order the ca=
rriage to be brought=20

round directly. I am not going to dine out to-night. I will just go upstair=
s to change my bonnet. And=20

Henry, take Mrs. Martin down to the servants' hall, and give her some dinne=
r. She is coming out=20

with me in the carriage, so be quick, please."  As Mrs. Ellsworthy stood be=
fore her glass re-

arranging her toilet her maid saw her wiping some tears from her pretty eye=
s.  "Oh, my bonny=20

Arthur," she said under her breath. "Oh, what your poor, poor mother must h=
ave suffered."  When=20

the carriage came to the door Mrs. Ellsworthy gave the coachman Noel's addr=
ess, and the two=20

women drove there at once. They were fortunate in finding the young man wit=
hin. He too was=20

engaged to dine out that night, but he did not go. Hannah, Mrs. Ellsworthy,=
 and he had a long=20

conference, which lasted until late in the evening, and when Mr. Ellsworthy=
 joined them he was=20

told a very wonderful story. Hannah returned to Devonshire on the following=
 morning very well=20

pleased with her successful expedition.  "If there had been any doubt," she=
 said to herself, as she=20

was being whirled homewards in her third-class carriage, "if there had been=
 any doubt after the=20

sight of that mole on his dear, blessed arm, why, the little shirt which Mr=
s. Ellsworthy showed me,=20

and which she took off his            in the multitude of thy mighty men.  =
28:010:014 Therefore shall a=20

tumult arise among thy people, and all thy            fortresses shall be s=
poiled, as Shalman spoiled=20

Betharbel in            the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces =
upon her            children.=20

28:010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:   =
         in a morning=20

shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.  28:011:001 When Israel was a =
child, then I loved him, and=20

called my son            out of Egypt.  28:011:002 As they called them, so =
they went from them: they=20

sacrificed            unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.  28=
:011:003 I taught Ephraim=20

also to go, taking them by their arms; but            they knew not that I =
healed them.  28:011:004 I=20

drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was            to =
them as they that take off=20

the yoke on their jaws, and I            laid meat unto them.  28:011:005 H=
e shall not return into the=20

land of Egypt, and the Assyrian            shall be his king, because they =
refused to return.=20

28:011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his  =
          branches, and=20

devour them, because of their own counsels.  28:011:007 And my people are b=
ent to backsliding=20

from me: though they            called them to the most High, none at all w=
ould exalt him.=20

28:011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,    =
        Israel? how shall I=20

make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee            as Zeboim? mine heart i=
s turned within me, my=20

repentings are            kindled together.  28:011:009 I will not execute =
the fierceness of mine anger,=20

I will not            return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man;=
 the Holy            One in the=20

midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.  28:011:010=20


_
that he's my own boy. Could I ever forget marking that shirt in cross-stitc=
h, and making such a=20

bungle over the A, and thinking I'd put Mainwaring in full, and then gettin=
g lazy, and only making=20

the mark A.M.? Well, I was served out for that piece of laziness, for my bo=
y might have been=20

brought back to his mother but for it. Dear, dear! Well, there's no mistaki=
ng my own A.M., and=20

when I peered close with my glasses on I could even see where I unpicked th=
e A. and did it over=20

again. Dear, dear, shall I ever forgive myself for not doing the surname in=
 full--his poor, poor=20

mother! Well, I mustn't think of that--it's a merciful Providence that has =
led me to him now, and=20

he's as darling and elegant a young man as ever I clapped eyes on, and as f=
ond of the young=20

ladies as can be even now.  "'I always felt somehow as if they were my sist=
ers,' he said to me.=20

Well, well, God be praised for his mercies."     CHAPTER LV.  AN INVITATION=
 FOR THE LADIES=20

OF PENELOPE MANSION.   "There are limits to all things," said Mrs. Mortlock=
; "there's a time, as=20

the blessed Bible says, to sorrow, and a time to rejoice, and what I say to=
o is, that there is a time=20

when a woman's patience may be exhausted. Yes, Mrs. Dredge, you may look at=
 me with as=20

round eyes as you please--I know they are round though I can't see them, bu=
t I will say, if it's my=20

last dying breath, that the moment for my 'continual reader' to return has =
arrived. Miss Slowcum,=20

no doubt you'll corroborate what I say, ma'am."  "It's hot weather for youn=
g bright flowers to shed=20

their fragrance on the London streets," replied Miss Slowcum; "it's the kin=
d of weather when=20

flowers fade. I should imagine, Mrs. Mortlock, that your 'continual reader'=
 was doing better for=20

herself in the country."  Mrs. Mortlock's face became very red.  "Better fo=
r herself, is she?" she=20

said, "and is that all the thanks I get for keeping my post vacant, and liv=
ing through days the=20

weariness of which none may know. If Miss Primrose Mainwaring is doing bett=
er for herself in the=20

country she is welcome to stay there. The post is a good one, a light and a=
n easy one, and I can=20

get many another lass to fill it."  "I think, ma'am," said Mrs. Dredge, who=
se face had grown=20

wonderfully smooth and pleasant of late, "that the dear girls will all be i=
n town this week, and most=20

likely Miss Primrose will come to pay you a visit. Oh, they are nice girls,=
 pretty, elegant girls, just=20

the kind of girls my good man would like to have been papa to. I can't help=
 shivering, even now=20

when I think of that wicked man Dove, and what a state he put dear little D=
aisy into."  "If praises of=20

the Mainwarings is to begin," answered Mrs. Mortlock in her tartest voice, =
"what I say is, let me=20

retire. It's all very well for them as has right to talk well of the absent=
, but when one of the absent=20

ones is neglecting her duty the lady who has weak eyes feels it. Miss Slowc=
um, ma'am, have you=20

any objection to moving with me into the drawing-room? I can lend you that =
pattern you admired=20

so much for tatting if you read me the latest gossip from the evening paper=
s, ma'am."  Mrs.=20

Mortlock rose from her chair, and, accompanied by Miss Slowcum, left the ro=
om. Miss Slowcum=20

took a ladylike interest in all kinds of needlework, and the desire to poss=
ess the tatting pattern=20

overcame her great reluctance to read aloud to the very tart old lady.  Mrs=
. Mortlock placed herself=20

in the most comfortable arm-chair the room afforded, and having secured her=
 victim, began=20

instantly to tyrannize over her.  "Now, Miss Slowcum, read up chirrupy and =
cheerful please. None=20

of your drawling, by way of genteel voice, for me--I like my gossip crisp. =
I will say this of that dear=20

girl Primrose Mainwaring, that she did her gossip crisp."  "You really are =
a very unaccountable=20

person, Mrs. Mortlock," replied Miss Slowcum. "You begin by abusing Primros=
e Mainwaring, and=20

then you praise her in the most absurd manner. I hope the refined reading o=
f a cultivated lady is=20

not to be compared to the immature utterances of a school-girl. If that is =
so, Mrs. Mortlock, even=20



for the sake of the tatting pattern, I cannot consent to waste my words on =
you."  "Oh, my good=20

creature," said Mrs. Mortlock, who by no means wished to be left to solitud=
e and herself, "you read=20

in a very pretty style of your own--obsolete it may be--h'm--I suppose we m=
ust expect that--mature=20

it certainly is; yes, my dear, quite mature. If I praise Primrose Mainwarin=
g, and a good girl she was=20

when she was with me--yes, a good, painstaking girl, thankful for her merci=
es--it's no=20

disparagement to you, Miss Slowcum. You're mellow, my dear, and you can't h=
elp being mellow,=20

and Primrose Mainwaring is crisp, and she can't help being crisp. Oh, goodn=
ess gracious me!=20

what sound is that falls on my ear?"  "An old friend's voice, I hope, Mrs. =
Mortlock," said a pleasant=20

girlish tone, and Primrose Mainwaring herself bent down over the old lady a=
nd kissed her.=20

Notwithstanding all her grumbling Mrs. Mortlock had taken an immense fancy =
to Primrose. She=20

returned her embrace warmly, and even took her hand and squeezed it.  "I'd =
like to see you, dear,"=20

she said, "but I'm getting blinder and blinder. Have you come back to your =
continual reading,=20

dear? I hope so, for you do the gossip in a very chirruping style."  While =
Mrs. Mortlock was=20

speaking to Primrose Miss Slowcum had taken Daisy in her arms, and covered =
her sweet little=20

face with kisses, for Miss Slowcum was not all sour and affected, and she h=
ad shed some bitter=20

tears in secret over the child's unaccountable disappearance. Mrs. Dredge a=
nd Mrs. Flint had both=20

surrounded Jasmine, who, in a white summer frock, was looking extremely pre=
tty, and was=20

entertaining them with some animated conversation.  "Yes," said Primrose to=
 Mrs. Mortlock, "I will=20

come to read to you as often as ever I can. I shall know my plans better af=
ter to-morrow. We three=20

girls returned to London a couple of days ago, and we received a letter fro=
m our kind friend Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy. You don't know her, perhaps, but she is a very kind friend of o=
urs. She is making some=20

plans for us, but we don't quite know what they are. She has written us a l=
etter, however, and it is=20

on account of that letter that we have all come to you to-night. She has in=
vited us to come to her=20

to-morrow, and she wants all the friends who were kind to us, and who helpe=
d us in every way=20

during our year in London, to come in the evening to hear what the plans ar=
e. Even if you can't=20

see, Mrs. Mortlock, it will amuse you to come, and I hope so much you will =
do so. I will try to stay=20

close to you myself when you do come, so you need not feel lonely."  "My de=
ar, you are very=20

kind," said Mrs. Mortlock, and the other ladies also said the Mainwarings w=
ere kind, and they sent=20

their dutiful respects to Mrs. Ellsworthy and were pleased to accept. Accor=
dingly, Primrose gave=20

them full directions with regard to the right address, and the hour at whic=
h they were to be present;=20

and finally the girls left Mrs. Flint and her three lady boarders in a stat=
e of considerable excitement=20

and so deeply interested in what was about to occur that they forgot to gru=
mble at each other.=20

CHAPTER LVI.  A PALACE BEAUTIFUL.   Hannah Martin had come up with her youn=
g ladies to=20

London, and she also was invited by Mrs. Ellsworthy to come to her house. T=
he girls all thought=20

Hannah very much altered; they could not understand her queer illusions, or=
 her mysterious little=20

nods, or in particular the way she used to stare at Jasmine, and say under =
her breath, "Yes, yes,=20

as like as two peas. What a blind old woman I was not to see it when I clap=
ped eyes on him."  "I=20

cannot make out what Hannah is always muttering," Jasmine said to her siste=
rs. "Who is it I am so=20

remarkably like. To judge from the way Hannah frowns and shakes her head, a=
nd then smiles, the=20

fact of this accidental likeness seems to have a very disturbing effect upo=
n her."  "I know whom=20

you are like, Jasmine," said little Daisy. "I've seen it for a long time. Y=
ou are the very image of my=20

dear Prince. You have got just the same colored eyes, and just the same cur=
ly hair, and both your=20



foreheads are broad and white. It's perfectly natural," continued Daisy, "f=
or you are both geniuses,=20

and all geniuses must have a look of each other."  Hannah had old-fashioned=
 ideas on many=20

subjects. One of these was that people could not remain too long in mournin=
g. She liked very deep=20

black, and wished those who had lost relations to wear it for a long, long =
time. The girls, therefore,=20

were quite amazed when she suggested that they should all go to Mrs. Ellswo=
rthy in white. They=20

began to consider her quite an altered Hannah; but Jasmine took her advice,=
 and bought many=20

yards of soft flowing muslin, which the old servant helped her dear        =
    when he shall roar, then=20

the children shall tremble from the            west.  28:011:011 They shall=
 tremble as a bird out of=20

Egypt, and as a dove out            of the land of Assyria: and I will plac=
e them in their houses,=20

saith the LORD.  28:011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the =
house of Israel=20

with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful            with=
 the saints.  28:012:001=20

Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he            d=
aily increaseth lies and=20

desolation; and they do make a            covenant with the Assyrians, and =
oil is carried into Egypt.=20

28:012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish    =
        Jacob according=20

to his ways; according to his doings will he            recompense him.  28=
:012:003 He took his=20

brother by the heel in the womb, and by his            strength he had powe=
r with God:  28:012:004=20

Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and            ma=
de supplication unto=20

him: he found him in Bethel, and there            he spake with us;  28:012=
:005 Even the LORD God=20

of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.  28:012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy =
God: keep mercy and=20

judgment and            wait on thy God continually.  28:012:007 He is a me=
rchant, the balances of=20

deceit are in his hand: he            loveth to oppress.  28:012:008 And Ep=
hraim said, Yet I am=20

become rich, I have found me out            substance: in all my labours th=
ey shall find none iniquity=20

in            me that were sin.  28:012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God =
from the land of Egypt=20

will yet            make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of th=
e            solemn feast.=20

28:012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied       =
     visions, and used=20

similitudes, by the ministry of the            prophets.  28:012:011 Is the=
re iniquity in Gilead? surely=20

they are vanity: they            sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their a=
ltars are as heaps            in the=20

furrows of the fields.  28:012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria=
, and Israel served=20

for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.  28:012:013 And by a prophet the =
LORD brought Israel=20

out of Egypt, and by            a prophet was he preserved.  28:012:014 Eph=
raim provoked him to=20

anger most bitterly: therefore shall            he leave his blood upon him=
, and his reproach shall his=20

LORD            return unto him.  28:013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, =
he exalted himself in=20

Israel;            but when he offended in Baal, he died.  28:013:002 And n=
ow they sin more and=20

more, and have made them molten            images of their silver, and idol=
s according to their own=20

understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say            of =
them, Let the men that=20

sacrifice kiss the calves.  28:013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morni=
ng cloud and as the=20

early            dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with th=
e            whirlwind out of the=20

floor, and as the smoke out of the            chimney.  28:013:004 Yet I am=
 the LORD thy God from=20

the land of Egypt, and thou            shalt know no god but me: for there =
is no saviour beside me.=20

28:013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great         =
   drought.  28:013:006=20

According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were            fille=
d, and their heart was exalted;=20

therefore have they            forgotten me.  28:013:007 Therefore I will b=
e unto them as a lion: as a=20



leopard by the            way will I observe them:  28:013:008 I will meet =
them as a bear that is=20

bereaved of her whelps, and            will rend the caul of their heart, a=
nd there will I devour=20

them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.  28:013:009 O Israel, tho=
u hast destroyed thyself;=20

but in me is thine            help.  28:013:010 I will be thy king: where i=
s any other that may save thee=20

in            all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a=
            king and princes?=20

28:013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my       =
     wrath.  28:013:012=20

The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.  28:013:013 The sorrow=
s of a travailing woman=20

shall come upon him: he is            an unwise son; for he should not stay=
 long in the place of the=20

breaking forth of children.  28:013:014 I will ransom them from the power o=
f the grave; I will=20

redeem            them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave,=
 I            will be thy=20

destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine            eyes.  28:013:015=
 Though he be fruitful=20

among his brethren, an east wind shall            come, the wind of the LOR=
D shall come up from the=20

wilderness,            and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain sh=
all be            dried up: he=20

shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.  28:013:016 Samaria shall=
 become desolate; for=20

she hath rebelled against            her God: they shall fall by the sword:=
 their infants shall be=20

dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped            up.=
  28:014:001 O israel,=20

return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen            by thine iniq=
uity.  28:014:002 Take with=20

you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take            away all ini=
quity, and receive us=20

graciously: so will we            render the calves of our lips.  28:014:00=
3 Asshur shall not save us;=20

we will not ride upon horses:            neither will we say any more to th=
e work of our hands, Ye are=20

our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.  28:014:004 I will heal=
 their backsliding, I will=20

love them freely: for            mine anger is turned away from him.  28:01=
4:005 I will be as the dew=20

unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,            and cast forth his roots=
 as Lebanon.  28:014:006 His=20

branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the            olive tree=
, and his smell as Lebanon.=20

28:014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall       =
     revive as the corn, and=20

grow as the vine: the scent thereof            shall be as the wine of Leba=
non.  28:014:008 Ephraim=20

shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I            have heard h=
im, and observed him: I am=20

like a green fir tree.            From me is thy fruit found.  28:014:009 W=
ho is wise, and he shall=20

understand these things? prudent,            and he shall know them? for th=
e ways of the LORD are=20

right,            and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors sh=
all            fall therein.      ***=20

them with marked tenderness, but said, in an almost confused manner, and by=

afternoon's=20

other house is very pretty, but it is smaller than mine."  The other house =
was quite close to Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy's luxurious mansion. It was built more in the cottage shape, was=
 much smaller, and had=20

a charming little garden and grounds round it. The hall door opened into a =
porch, which was=20

covered with roses, so that though the house was really in London, the effe=
ct was quite that of the=20

country. Standing in the porch, and looking extremely pretty in its flicker=
ing light and shade, stood=20

Poppy Jenkins, in the neatest of handmaiden's attire, and as the girls all =
came into the shade of=20

the cool porch, Noel himself, looking somewhat pale, and with a curious agi=
tation in his manner,=20

came out to meet them.  "This is my house," he said, "and Poppy is engaged =
as one of the=20
