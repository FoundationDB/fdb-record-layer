we had got to windward, and slowly and tediously we toiled along the crumbling soil, stumbling 

among the crevices, that were nearly invisible in the moonlight.  Thus we crept onwards; I had 

found riding impracticable, therefore the horses were led, with much difficulty, as they constantly 

slipped up to their knees in the numerous fissures. It was difficult to recognise our position in the 

moonlight, and we were doubtful whether we had not missed our route to the camp. My watch told 

me that it was past nine o'clock, and we had been sixteen hours in hard work without the slightest 

rest. We halted to confer about the direction of the camp, when suddenly I heard the report of a 

gun to our right; we immediately turned, and hastened towards the welcome sound; presently I 

heard a distant shout. As we approached, this was repeated, and as I hurried forward, I 

recognised my own name shouted in an agonised voice. I ran on alone at my best speed, after 

giving a loud shrill whistle upon my fingers. This was quickly replied to, and I repeated the well-

known signal, until in about ten minutes I met my wife, who had been wandering about the country 

half distracted for hours, searching for me in every direction, as my horse Aggahr had returned to 

the camp with the bridle broken, and the empty saddle scratched by the boughs of trees; she had 

naturally concluded that some accident had happened. She had immediately armed herself with 

the little Fletcher that had been left in the camp, being too small for elephants; with this, and 

several of the Arabs armed with swords and lances, she had been hunting throughout this wild 

country during the night in a state of terrible anxiety. It was fortunate that she had fired the shot to 

direct our attention, otherwise we might have passed each other without being seen. "All's well 

that ends well:" we were about three miles from camp, but the distance appeared short to 

everybody, as we now knew the true direction, and we at length perceived the glare of a large fire 

that our people had lighted as a beacon.  The horse, Aggahr, must have found his way without 

difficulty, as he had arrived a little before sunset. This curious instinct, that enables a horse to find 

the direction to its last halting-place in a wild and pathless country, was thoroughly appreciated by 

the Arabs, who had comforted me with the assurance, that no Abyssinian horse would lose his 

way to the spot where he had last passed the night, if separated from his rider.   CHAPTER XIX. 

SEND A PARTY TO RECONNOITRE.  I HAD thoroughly explored the beautiful country of the 

Salaam and Angrab; it was the 11th of April, and I intended to push on to Gallabat, the frontier 

market-town of Abyssinia. We had no guide, as the fellow that had been supplied by Mek Nimmur 

had absconded the day after our arrival at the Salaam, but during the march he had pointed out a 

blue outline of a distant mountain in the south, that was called Nahoot Guddabi, or the Saddle of 

Guddabi. This was an unmistakeable landmark, as it exactly resembled an Arab saddle; at the foot 

of this mountain was the Tokroori village of Guddabi, the first habitation, at a distance of about fifty 

miles from the Bahr Salaam. Although, from the experience I had had in this neighbourhood, I had 

little doubt of the supply of water on the road, I sent three of my Tokrooris upon as many camels 

with water-skins, to reconnoitre before I should move the camp.  On the second day they returned, 

and reported the existence of several small streams, all of which produced excellent water.  We 

started on the following afternoon, and, with Hassan as our guide, and Taher Noor upon a camel, 

my wife and I cantered ahead of the main body, over a high ridge of stony, and accordingly firm 

ground. Upon arrival at the summit, we had a lovely view of the surrounding country, and we 

commenced a gentle descent into a vast plain sparsely covered with small trees. In the extensive 

prospect before us, the dark green veins of foliage in the otherwise yellow surface of withered 



grass marked out distinctly the course of small rivulets. We hurried on, sometimes over blackened 

ashes, where the fire had swept all before it, at other times through withered grass, that had been 

saved from destruction through the intervention of some ravine. At 7.30 P.M. we arrived at an 

excellent halting place, by a beautiful but small stream of water, shaded by a fringe of dome 

palms; this was by dead reckoning seventeen miles from our last camp. It had been pleasant 

travelling, as the to possess."  The priest took him by the hand.  "Whatever it may be, it is yours!" 

In another minute they had reached the pear-tree.  "There is my carriage."  The priest looked that 

way, and saw, first a red sunshade, then a black straw hat under it, with some white daisies in it, 

and beneath it a sweet, girlish face. It all seemed so familiar to him, the sunshade, the hat, and the 

face. He rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream, and then exclaimed, catching hold of 

the lawyer's arm:  "Why, that is my Veronica!"  The lawyer smiled quietly and bowed.  "That is," 

went on the priest in his kind, gentle voice, "for the future she is your Veronica, if you wish."  By 

this time Veronica had seen and recognized her brother, had jumped out of the carriage and run to 

meet him, calling out:  "Here we are, safe and sound. How anxious you must have been! And our 

carriage is broken to bits; and oh! if you had only seen the horses! All sorts of things have 

happened, and I have brought Madame Krisbay."  The priest embraced her, and was glad she 

seemed to know nothing of his accident. How sensible of Gyuri not to have mentioned it!  "Yes, 

yes, my darling, you shall tell me everything in order later on."  But Veronica wanted to tell 

everything at once, the carriage accident in Babaszek, the supper at Mravucsans' (oh, yes! she 

had nearly forgotten, Mr. Mravucsan had sent his kind regards), then to-day's journey, the loss of 

her earring and its recovery ...  The priest, who was slowly beginning to understand things, here 

broke in upon her recital.  "And did you give the finder of it a reward?"  She was silent at first at the 

unexpected question, then answered hurriedly:  "No, of course not, how can you think of such a 

thing? What was I to give? Besides, he would not accept anything."  "I am surprised at that, for he 

has since then applied to me for a reward."  "Impossible!" said Veronica, casting a side-glance at 

Gyuri. Strange doubts had arisen in her mind, and her heart began to beat.  "And what does he 

ask for?" she asked in a low voice.  "He wants a good deal. He asks for the earring he found, and 

with it its owner. And I have promised him both!"  Veronica bent her head; her face was suffused 

with burning blushes, her bosom heaved.  "Well? Do you give no answer? Did I do right to 

promise, Veronica?"  Gyuri took a step toward her, and said, in a low, pleading voice:  "Only one 

word, Miss Veronica!" then stood back under the shade of the pear-tree.  "Oh! I am so ashamed!" 

said Veronica trembling, and bursting into tears.  A breeze came up just then across the Brana, 

and shook the pear-tree, which shed its white petals, probably the last the old tree would bear, 

over Veronica's dress.     CHAPTER II.  THREE SPARKS.   Madame sits in the carriage, and can 

understand nothing of what is going on. The young lady entrusted to her charge springs out of the 

carriage, runs up to a strange man in a long black coat, throws her arms round his neck, and then 

they all begin to talk with excited gestures, standing under the pear-tree. Then her pupil comes 

back to the carriage, mild as a lamb, arm in arm with the young man who had found her earring 

yesterday. All of this is so unexpected, so surprising. And while they are mending the broken shaft 

and reharnessing the horses, the man in the black coat, who turns out to be the girl's brother, 

turns to her and whispers in her ear:  "Your pupil has just engaged herself!"  Good gracious! When 

and where? Why, now, under the tree! Ah, Madame Krisbay, you feel you ought to faint now, 



partly because you are a correct woman, and consequently horrified at the way the event has 

taken place, and partly because you have fallen among such strange people; but your bottle of 

Eau de Cologne is quite at the bottom of your travelling-bag, and so it will be better not to faint 

now. But it is very shocking all the same! For though a tree is suitable for flirting under, or for 

declarations of love, it is not the correct place to ask a parent or guardian for a girl's hand. The 

proper place for that (especially in novels) is a well-furnished drawing-room. If the girl is very shy 

she runs out of the room; if not very shy she falls on her knees and asks the blessing of her 

parents or guardian, as the case may be. But how is one to kneel under a tree? These were the 

thoughts that were troubling Madame Krisbay, not Veronica. She, on the contrary, was thinking 

that one fine day she would return to this spot with her sketch-book, and draw the old tree as a 

souvenir. 


_
therefore it was useless to expect the camels for some hours; we accordingly spread the carpet on 

the ground, and lay down to sleep, with the stocks of the rifles for pillows, as we had frequently 

done on former occasions.  On the following morning I sent a couple of men on camels to 

reconnoitre the country in advance, towards Guddabi, and to return with the report of the supply of 

water. This country abounded with large game, especially with the beautiful antelope already 

described, the maarif; they were as usual extremely wild, but I succeeded in breaking the hip of a 

fine bull at a long range; and, separating him from the herd, I ran the wounded antelope until I was 

thoroughly exhausted in the intense heat of the sun, but I lost it in the thick bush not far from our 

camp. That night we heard a lion roaring close to us, and, upon searching at daybreak I found the 

remains of a maarif, which I imagine must have been my wounded bull.  I mounted my horse 

Tetel, and, with Taher Noor and two of my Tokrooris, Hadji Ali and Hassan, I rode towards a 

pyramidical hill about three miles distant, which I intended to ascend in order to obtain a 

panoramic view of the country. This hill was about three hundred feet no room for the coachman, 

so he had to follow on foot, and Gyuri took the reins into his own hands, Veronica sitting on the 

box beside him. Oh dear! she thought, what would they think of her in the village as they drove 

through?  The road was better now, and they could drive faster, so Gyuri loosened the reins, and 

began to think over the events that had taken place. Was it a dream or not? No, it could not be, for 

there was Veronica sitting near to him, and behind him Father Janos was talking to Madame 

Krisbay in the language of the Gauls. No, it was simple truth, though it seemed stranger than 

fiction. Who would have believed yesterday that before the sun set twice he would find his 

inheritance, and a wife into the bargain? Twenty-four hours ago he had not known of the existence 

of Miss Veronica Belyi. Strange! And now he was trying to imagine what the world had been like 

without her. It seemed impossible that he had not felt the want of her yesterday. But the wheels 

were making such a noise, that he found it difficult to collect his thoughts. Wonders had happened. 

One legend, that of the umbrella, was done away with, but on its ruins another had built itself up. 

Heaven and earth had combined to help him 


_
portion of the grass for several miles around, I should obtain a clear view of all living animals that 

might be in the neighbourhood. Upon arrival at the base of the hill I dismounted, and led my horse 

up the steep inclination of broken basalt that had fallen from the summit. From the top of the peak 

I had a superb panorama of the country, the mountain Nahoot Guddabi bearing S.W. about thirty 

miles distant. I had a complete bird's-eye view of great extent, and I immediately distinguished, in 

various positions, giraffes, buffaloes, tetel, and boars. At this season the trees were leafless, thus 

any animal upon the low ground would be at once discovered from this elevated point. I extract 

from my journal the account of this day's hunt, as it was written immediately upon my return to 

camp.  "I had been observing the country for some time from my high station, when I suddenly 

perceived two rhinoceros emerge from a ravine; they walked slowly through a patch of high grass, 

and skirted the base of the hill upon which we were standing: presently they winded something, 

and they trotted back and stood concealed in the patch of grass. Although I had a good view of 

them from my present position, I knew that I should not be able to see them in their covert, if on 

the same level; I therefore determined to send to the tent for my other horses, and to ride them 

down, if I could not shoot them on foot; accordingly, I sent a man off, directing him to lead Tetel 

from the peak, and to secure him to a tree at the foot of the hill, as I was afraid the rhinoceros 

might observe the horse upon the sky line. This he did, and we saw him tie the horse by the bridle 

to the branch of a tree below us, while he ran quickly towards the camp. In the mean time I 

watched the rhinoceros; both animals lay down in the yellow grass, resembling masses of stone. 

They had not been long in this position, before we noticed two pigs wandering through the grass 

directly to windward, towards the sleeping rhinoceros; in an instant these animals winded the 

intruders, and starting up, they looked in all directions, but could not see them, as they were 

concealed by the high grass. Having been thus disturbed, the rhinoceros moved their quarters, 

and walked slowly forward, occasionally halting, and listening; one was about a hundred yards in 

advance of the other. They were taking a direction at the base of the hill that would lead them 

directly upon the spot where Tetel was tied to the tree. I observed this to Taher Noor, as I feared 

they would kill the horse. 'Oh, no,' he replied, 'they will lie down and sleep beneath the first tree, as 

they are seeking for shade--the sun is like fire.' However, they still continued their advance, and, 

upon reaching some rising ground, the leading rhinoceros halted, and I felt sure that he had a 

clear view of the horse, that was now about five hundred yards distant, tied to the tree. A ridge 

descended from the hill, parallel with the course the animals were taking; upon this, I ran as 

quickly as the stony slope permitted, keeping my eye fixed upon the leading rhinoceros, who, with 

his head raised, was advancing directly towards the horse. I now felt convinced that he intended to 

attack it. Tetel did not observe the rhinoceros, but was quietly standing beneath the tree. I ran as 

fast as I was able, and reached the bottom of the hill just as the wilful brute was within fifty yards of 

the horse, which now for the first time saw the approaching danger; the rhinoceros had been 

advancing steadily at a walk, but he now lowered his head, and charged at the horse at full speed. 

"I was about two hundred yards distant, and for the moment I was afraid of shooting the horse, but 

I fired one of the Reilly No. 10 rifles; the bullet, missing the rhinoceros, dashed the sand and 

stones into his face, as it struck the to his inheritance. Heaven had sent a dream and earth a 

protector.  His heart swelled as he thought of it. Oh, if the girl next him only knew to what a rich 

man she had promised her hand!  After passing the Kopanyicza Hills, which seem like a screen to 



the entrance of the valley, Glogova, with its little white houses, lay before them.  "We are nearly at 

home now," said Veronica.  "Where is the Presbytery?" asked Gyuri.  "At the end of the village." 

"Tell me when to turn to the right or the left."  "Very well, Mr. Coachman! At present keep straight 

on."  A smell of lavender pervaded the street, and the tidy little gardens were filled with all sorts of 

flowers. In front of the houses children were playing, and in most of the courtyards a foal was 

running about, with a bell tied round its neck. Otherwise the village seemed quite deserted, for all 

who could work were out in the fields, and the women, having cooked the dinner at home, had 

carried it out to their husbands. Only on the grass-plot in front of the school-house was there life; 

there the children were at play, and their greetings to those in the carriage was in Hungarian.  Of 

the villagers only the "aristocratic" were at home. At the threshold of a pretty little stone house 

stood Gongoly, much stouter than some years before. In front of the smithy sat Klincsok, quietly 

smoking, while the smith mended a wheel.  "Hallo!" he called out. "So you've come back! Why, we 

were thinking of looking out for another priest!" Which showed that Father Janos' absence had 

been noticed.  How Glogova had changed in the last few years! There was a tower to the church, 

the like of which was not to be seen except in Losoncz; only that on the tower of Losoncz there 

was a weathercock. In the middle of the village was a hotel, "The Miraculous Umbrella," with 

Virginian creeper climbing all over it, and near it a pretty little white house, looking as though it 

were made of sugar; behind it a garden with a lot of young trees in it.  "Whose house is that?" 

asked Gyuri, turning round.  "The owner is on the box-seat beside you."  "Really? Is it yours, 

Veronica?"  She nodded her head.  "There is a small farm belonging to it," said Father Janos 

modestly.  "Well, we won't take it with us, but leave it here for your brother, shall we, Veronica?" 

Then he turned to the priest again, saying:  "Veronica has a fortune worthy of a countess, but 

neither you nor she knows of it."  Both the priest and Veronica were so surprised at this 

announcement, that they did not notice they were in front of the Presbytery, and Gyuri would have 

driven on if Vistula, the old watch-dog, had not rushed out barking with joy; and old Widow 

Adamecz called out, with the tears rolling down her face:  "Holy Mary! you have heard the prayers 

of your servant!"  "Stop! here we are. Open the gate, Mrs. Adamecz."  The widow wiped away her 

tears, dropped her book, and got up to open the gate.  "Is dinner ready?" asked Father Janos. 

"Dinner? Of course not. Whom was I to cook for? We all thought your reverence was lost. I have 

not even lighted the fire, for my tears would only have put it out again."  "Never mind, Mrs. 

Adamecz. I feel sure you were anxious on my account, but now go and see about some dinner for 

us, for we are dying of hunger."  Veronica had become suspicious at the widow's words, and 

began to storm her brother with questions; then burst out crying and turned her back upon Gyuri, 

declaring they were hiding something from her. So they were obliged to tell her the truth, and her 

poor little heart nearly broke when she thought of what her brother had gone through, and what 

danger he had been in.  While this was going on, Mrs. Adamecz was bustling about in the kitchen, 

and giving every one plenty of work to do. Both the maids were called in to help, and the farm-

servant too.  "Come and 


_
his nose, when he appeared to be just into the unfortunate Tetel. The horse in the same instant 

reared, and, breaking the bridle, it dashed away in the direction of the camp, while the rhinoceros, 

astonished at the shot, and most likely half blinded by the sand and splinters of rock, threw up his 

head, turned round, and trotted back upon the track by which he had arrived. He passed me at 

about a hundred yards distance, as I had run forward to a bush, by which he trotted with his head 

raised, seeking for the cause of his discomfiture. Crack! went a bullet against his hide, as I fired 

my remaining barrel at his shoulder; he cocked his tail, and for a few yards he charged towards 

the shot; but he suddenly changed his course, and ran round several times in a small circle; he 

then halted, and reeling to and fro, he retreated very slowly, and lay down about a hundred yards 

off. Well done, Reilly! I knew that he had his quietus, but I was determined to bag his companion, 

who in alarm had now joined him, and stood looking in all quarters for the source of danger; but 

we were well concealed behind the bush. Presently, the wounded rhinoceros stood up, and 

walking very slowly, followed by his comrade, he crossed a portion of rising ground at the base of 

the hill, and both animals disappeared. I at once started off Hassan, who could run like an 

antelope, in search of Tetel, while I despatched another man to the summit of the peak to see if 

the rhinoceros were in view; if not, I knew they must be among the small trees and bushes at the 

foot of the hill. I thus waited for a long time, until salt. Is the goose plucked? Now, Matyas, don't be 

so lazy, run and pick some parsley in the garden. Dear me! How very thin the good lady is whom 

Miss Veronica has brought home with her. Did you see her? I shall have hard work to feed her up 

and make her decently fat. Give me a saucepan; not that one, the other. And, Borbala, grate me 

some bread-crumbs. But the young man is handsome. I wonder what he wants here? What did 

you say? You don't know? Of course you don't know, silly, if I don't. But this much is certain 

(between ourselves of course), there is something strange in Miss Veronica's eyes. Something 

has happened, but I can't make out what."  Widow Adamecz thought of all sorts of things, both 

good and bad, but her cooking was excellent, and she gave them such a dinner, that even the 

lovers found their appetites.  After dinner, Gyuri sent a man on horseback with a letter to Mr. 

Sztolarik in Besztercebanya.       "MY DEAR GUARDIAN:       "I have great things to communicate 

to you, but at      present can only write the outlines. I have found the      umbrella, partly through 

Mrs. Muencz, partly by chance.      At present I am in Glogova, at the priest's house,      whose 

sister Veronica I have asked in marriage. She is      a very pretty girl; besides, there is no way of 

getting      at the money unless I marry her. Please send me by the      messenger two gold rings 

from Samuel Huszak's shop,      and the certificate of my birth; it must be among your      papers 

somewhere. I should like the banns to be      published the day after to-morrow.       "I remain," etc.

arrived with my messenger from the camp. I tightened the girths of the Arab saddle upon Aggahr, 

and I had just mounted, cursing all Arab stirrups, that are only made for the naked big toe, when 

my eyes were gladdened by the sight of Hassan cantering towards me upon Tetel, but from the 

exact direction the  "I'll hurry, but the horse won't!"  "Well, use your spurs."  "So I would, but there 

are no spurs on sandals!"  The horse was a wretched one, but all the same, next day they heard a 

carriage stop at the door, and who should get out but Sztolarik himself. Great man though he was, 

no one was glad to see him except

taken. 'Quick! quick!' he cried, 'come along! One rhinoceros is lying dead close by, and the other is 

standing beneath a tree not far off.'  "I immediately jumped on Tetel, and, taking the little Fletcher 

rifle, as lighter and handier than the heavy No. 10, I ordered Taher Noor and Hassan to mount the 

other horses, and to follow me with spare rifles. I found the rhinoceros lying dead about two 

hundred Veronica felt frightened. She hardly knew why, but it seemed as though a breath of cold 

air had entered with him. Why had he come here just now?  The old lawyer was very pleasant to 

her.  "So this is little Veronica?" he asked.  "Yes," answered Gyuri proudly.  The old gentleman 

took her small hand in his large one, and pinched her cheek in fatherly fashion. But no amount of 

pinching would bring the roses
