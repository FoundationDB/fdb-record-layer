be balanced and proportioned with regard to decorative and not to realistic=
 effect. His subjects are=20

apt to be fanciful and are executed in a semi-playful spirit not in the lea=
st familiar to an uninventive=20

age, as where the spirit of the Renaissance is represented by a young woman=
 seated high on a=20

 rungs below gazing=20

in adoration, while underneath them all yawns the grave filled with skeleto=
ns, from which the=20

Renaissance has risen.  [Illustration: A PAINTING BY CARL LARSSON]  On the =
subject of home=20

arts and handicrafts Larsson has emphatic ideas and urges on his compatriot=
s through its=20

impossible demands upon the North for protection; the action of the Souther=
n statesmen in the=20

question of petitions; the passage of a fugitive-slave law which drove the =
North itself to=20

nullification; the Kansas-Nebraska act and its outcome of civil war in the =
former territory; the=20

recognition, in the dicta of the supreme court in the Dred Scott case, of t=
he South=E2=80=99s contention of=20

its constitutional right to carry slavery into the territories, and the sta=
nd taken by the North against=20

any further slavery extension. To these visible conflicts were added the un=
conscious workings of=20

the disruptive forces of a totally distinct social organization. The outwar=
d strifes were but the=20

symptoms of a malady in the body politic of the Union which=20


_
national types. "Take care of your true self while time is," he says, "agai=
n become a plain and=20

worthy people. Be clumsy rather than elegant: dress yourselves in furs, ski=
ns, and woolens, make=20

yourselves things that are in harmony with your heavy bodies, and make ever=
ything in bright=20

strong colors; yes, in the so-called gaudy peasant colors which are needed =
contrasts to your deep=20

green pine forests and cold white snow." He has made designs for haute-liss=
e weaving which=20

were executed by the Handicraft Guild and which were practically open air p=
ainting translated into=20

the Gobelin weave. In all that he does he is free from the trammels of conv=
ention; but his chief=20

triumphs are in a field that is sadly neglected in modern art. As a painter=
 of family life he is=20

surpassed by none of his contemporaries.     JAN STEEN     X  JAN STEEN   J=
an Steen was born=20

in Leyden about 1626, which would make him nineteen years younger than Remb=
randt. He is said=20

to have studied first under Nicolas Knuepfer and then possibly under Adriae=
n van Ostade in=20

Harlem, and finally under Jan van Goyen at the Hague. In 1648 he was enroll=
ed in the Painter's=20

Guild at Leyden, and the following year he married Margaretha van Goyen, th=
e daughter of his=20

latest master. His father was a well-to-do merchant and beer-brewer and Ste=
en himself at one=20

time ran a brewery, though apparently not with great success. He incontesta=
bly was familiar with=20

the life of drinking places and houses in which rough merrymaking was the c=
hief business. Many=20

of his subjects are drawn from such sources and his brush brings them befor=
e us with their=20

characteristic features sharply observed and emphasized. He has been accuse=
d of a moralizing=20

tendency and it may at least be said that he permits us to draw our own mor=
al from perverted and=20

unpolished facts. In his least restrained moments he is a kind of Dutch Jor=
daens, less exuberant,=20

less sturdy and florid and gesticulatory; but with the same zest for living=
, the same union of old and=20

young in any festival that includes good meat and good drink with song and =
dance and horse-play.=20

If we compare "_Die Lustige Familie_" at Amsterdam with that ebullient rend=
ering of the same=20

subject by Jordaens entitled "_Zoo de ouden zongen: Zoo pypen de jongen_" t=
hat hangs in the=20

Antwerp Museum, we have no difficulty in perceiving the points of similarit=
y. There even are=20

likenesses in the color-schemes of the two painters, Jordaen's silvery yell=
ows for once meeting=20

their match; but we find in Steen's picture a more subtle discrimination in=
 the characters and=20

temperaments lying beneath the physical features of the gay company.  Often=
times Steen=20

indulges in a gay and harmless badinage as different as possible from the b=
old and keen irony of=20

his wilder themes. In "_Die Katzentanz Stunde_" of the Rijks museum at Amst=
erdam the laughing=20

children putting the wretched little cat through a course of unwelcome inst=
ruction, the excited pose=20

of the dog, the concentration of the girl upon her dance-music, are rendere=
d with joyous freedom=20

and animation, and suggest a childlike mood. The lovely _Menagerie_ of the =
Hague is conceived=20

in a still milder and gentler cause, slavery, should be removed.[135]  The =
president and vice-

president of the Southern Confederacy, in their elaborate defences written =
after the war, have=20

endeavored to rest the cause of the struggle wholly on constitutional quest=
ions. Stephens, whose=20

book, not even excepting Calhoun=E2=80=99s utterances, is the ablest exposi=
tion of the Southern reading of=20

the Constitution, says: =E2=80=9CThe struggle or conflict, ... from its ris=
e to its culmination, was between=20

those who, in whatever state they lived, were for maintaining our Federal s=
ystem as it was=20

established, and those who were for a consolidation of power in the central=
 head.=E2=80=9D[136] Jefferson=20

Davis is even more explicit. =E2=80=9CThe truth remains,=E2=80=9D he says, =
=E2=80=9Cintact and incontrovertible, that the=20

existence of African servitude was in no wise the cause of the conflict, bu=
t only an incident. In the=20



later controversies ... its effect in operating as a lever upon the passion=
s, prejudices, or=20

sympathies of mankind was so potent that it has been spread like a thick cl=
oud over the whole=20

horizon of historic truth.=E2=80=9D[137]  This is but begging the question.=
 The constitutional view had its=20

weight for the South in 1860 as it had for New England in the Jefferson-Mad=
ison period.=20

Jefferson=E2=80=99s iron domination of the national government during his p=
residency, a policy hateful to=20

New England, combined with the fear of being overweighted in sectional infl=
uence by the western=20

extension through the Louisiana purchase, led to pronounced threats of sece=
ssion by men of New=20

England, ardently desirous of escaping from what Pickering, one of its most=
 prominent men,=20

termed the Virginian supremacy.[138] Exactly the same arguments were used, =
_mutatis=20

mutandis_, later by the South.  As we all know, the movement, which never h=
ad any real popular=20

support and which had its last spasm of life in the Hartford Convention at =
the close of the War of=20

1812, came to naught. Freed by the fall of Napoleon and the peace with Engl=
and from the=20

pressure of the upper and nether mill-stones which had so ground to pieces =
our commerce, a=20

prosperity set in which drowned the sporadic discontent of the previous twe=
nty years. The fears of=20

the Eastern states no longer loomed so high and were as imaginary in fact, =
and had as slight a=20

basis, as were, in the beginning of the era of discord, those of the South.=
 Could slavery have been=20

otherwise preserved, the extreme decentralizing ideas of the South would ha=
ve disappeared with=20

equal ease, and Stephens=E2=80=99 _causa causans_--=E2=80=9Cthe different a=
nd directly opposite views as to the=20

nature of the government of the United States, and where, under our system,=
 ultimate sovereign=20

power or paramount authority properly resides,=E2=80=9D would have had no m=
ore intensity of meaning in=20

1860 than to-day.  Divergence of constitutional views, like most questions =
of government, follow=20

the lines of self-interest; Jefferson=E2=80=99s qualms gave way before the =
great prize of Louisiana; one part=20

of the South was ready in 1832 to go to war on account of a protective tari=
ff; another, Louisiana,=20

was at the same time demanding protection for her special industry. The Sou=
th thus simply shared=20

in our general human nature, and=20


_
her pets, feeding her lamb, with her doves flying about her head and the fa=
ithful little Steen dog in=20

the background, is an idyllic figure. Indeed the entire composition has a t=
enderness and almost a=20

religious depth of sentiment that make it unique among the painter's achiev=
ements. Another=20

charming composition in which homely pleasures enjoyed with moderation and =
in a mood of=20

simple merriment are delicately depicted is "_Der Wirtshausgarten_" in Berl=
in, in which the young=20

people and their elders together with the happy dog are having a quiet meal=
 under a green arbor.=20

Family pets play an important part in all these scenes of domestic life; ap=
parently Jan Steen even=20

more than other Dutch painters was interested in the idiosyncrasies of the =
animals about him and=20

was amused by incidents including them. His pictures gain by this a certain=
 suggestion of=20

kindliness and community of good feeling that is refreshing in the midst of=
 the frequent vulgarity of=20

theme and sentiment. Reminiscences of the exquisite feeling shown in "_Die =
Menagerie_"=20

continually occur in such incidents as a girl feeding her parrot, the play =
of children with the friendly=20

dogs and cats of the not for a pure abstraction, as Davis and Stephens, led=
 by Calhoun, would=20

have it, but for the supposed self-interest which its view of the Constitut=
ion protected. Its section,=20

its society, could not continue to develop in the Union under the Northern =
reading of the document,=20

and the irrepressible and certain nationalization, so different from its ow=
n tendencies, to which the=20

North as a whole was steadily moving.  Slavery drove the South into opposit=
ion to the broad,=20

liberal movement of the age. The French Revolution; the destruction of feud=
alism by Napoleon;=20

the later popular movements throughout Europe and South America; the libera=
lizing of Great=20

Britain; the nationalistic ideas of which we have the results in the German=
 empire and the kingdom=20

of Italy, and the strong nationalistic feeling developing in the northern p=
art of the Union itself had=20

but little reflex action in the South because of slavery and the South=E2=
=80=99s consequent segregation and=20

tendency to a feudalistic nationalization.   II  STATUS OF THE FORTS (OCT. =
29, 1860=E2=80=93DEC. 20,=20

1860)  General Scott, with his memories of 1832, was one of those who appre=
ciated the danger=20

hanging over the country, and,=20


_
noisy inn, and especially in the importance given to the expressions and at=
titudes of the dumb=20

creatures. The dog is nearly always in the foreground, invariably character=
ized with the utmost=20

vivacity and clearness, and usually playing his cheerful part in whatever o=
f lively occupation his=20

masters are engaged in. In "_Die Lustige Familie_" he 1860, he wrote from N=
ew York, where he=20

had his headquarters, a letter of great length to the President, which in p=
ompous phrases,=20

conceding the right of secession, and embodying some absurd ideas, such as =
allowing =E2=80=9Cthe=20

fragments of the great republic to form themselves into new confederacies, =
probably four,=E2=80=9D as a=20

smaller evil than war, gave=20


_
joins his voice to the family concert with an expression of canine agony.  =
Frequently the subjects=20

are obviously drawn from the life of his own family circle and the portrait=
s of his children in these=20

canvases are always sympathetic and delightful, giving a peculiarly intimat=
e character to the=20

artist's works in this kind. In "_Das Nikolausfest_" at Amsterdam the littl=
e girl in the foreground--

apparently the little Elisabeth born in 1662, who figures in so many of the=
 later paintings--is a=20

particularly engaging figure.  These simpler "feasts" and family gatherings=
 in which gay laughter=20

reigns in place of brawling, constitute a delightful phase of it as his =E2=
=80=9Csolemn conviction=E2=80=9D that there=20

was, from his knowledge of the Southern population, =E2=80=9Csome danger of=
 an early act of rashness=20

preliminary to secession, viz.: the seizure of some or all of the following=
 posts: Forts Jackson and=20

St. Philip on the Mississippi; Morgan below Mobile, all without garrisons; =
Pickens, McKee at=20

Pensacola, with an insufficient garrison for one; Pulaski, below Savannah, =
without a garrison;=20

Moultrie and Sumter, Charleston harbor, the former with an insufficient gar=
rison, the latter without=20

any; and Fort Monroe, Hampton Roads, with an insufficient garrison.=E2=80=
=9D  He gave it as his opinion=20

that =E2=80=9Call these works should be=20


_
art, yet curiously they are seldom as beautiful in their esthetic qualities=
 as the tavern scenes and=20

incidents of low and vicious life. The picture in the Louvre, however, "_Da=
s Familien Mahl_,"=20

contradicts this generalization in the sheer loveliness of color, in the li=
ght that streams through the=20

window hung with vines, and in the delicately discriminated textures of the=
 gowns and furnishings.=20

In this picture the figure of the woman nursing her child in the background=
 has an amplitude of line=20

and graciousness of pose that places it on a plane with Millet's renderings=
 of similar subjects,=20

while the painting in itself is of a quality never achieved by the poetic F=
renchman.  Occasionally=20

we find compositions by Steen in which only two or three figures are introd=
uced, although as a rule=20

he crowds every inch of his canvas with human beings and still-life. A so g=
arrisoned as to make=20

any attempt to take any one of them by surprise or _coup de main_ ridiculou=
s.=E2=80=9D He did not state=20

the number of men needed, but in a supplementary paper the next day (Octobe=
r 30th) said, =E2=80=9CThere=20

is one (regular) company in Boston, one here (at the Narrows), one at Pitts=
burg, one at Baton=20

Rouge--in all, five companies only within reach.=E2=80=9D[139] These five c=
ompanies, about two hundred=20

and fifty men, were of course absurdly inadequate to garrison nine such pos=
ts, but, had there been=20

a determination in the President=E2=80=99s mind to prevent seizures, enough=
 men could have been brought=20

together to hold the more important points.  For Scott=E2=80=99s statement =
as to the number available was=20

grossly inaccurate, and but serves to show the parlous state of a war depar=
tment in which the=20

general-in-chief can either be so misinformed or allow himself to remain=20
