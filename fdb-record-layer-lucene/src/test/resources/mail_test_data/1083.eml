I presume it is the potential mother in every woman that makes her worth while. And if this war will 

only harness motherhood to the public conscience, the net gain will be worth the war, however it is 

settled."     CHAPTER VIII  IN WHICH WE DISCOVER "A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH" 

Finally our talk left the war and its meaning, and we fell to wondering how the Young Doctor's 

hand was coming on, and we the ancient revolutions of our planet, they attained that height.* (* I 

saw no vein, no hole (four) filled with crystals. The decomposition of granitic rocks, and their 

separation into large masses, dispersed in the plains and valleys in the form of blocks and balls 

with concentric layers, appear to favour the enlarging of these natural excavations, which 

resemble real caverns.) In this tomb of a whole

of the Eager Soul, too, standing so wistfully between love and death and the picture of the Young 

Doctor sitting in the garden among the flowers of early autumn, more poet than soldier or doctor, 

came to both of us as we talked and then Henry stooped to the floor and picked up two folded 

sheets of paper. Clearly they had dropped from the envelope sent to us by the Eager Soul. He 

opened one and remarked:  "Why, Bill, it's poetry. She's written here on the margin, 'Verses by our 

Doctor friend. I thought you'd like to see them. See other sheet for preserved, and regularly 

placed. Every skeleton reposes in a sort of basket made of the petioles of the palm-tree. These 

baskets, which the natives call mapires, have the form of a square bag. Their size is proportioned 

to the age of the dead; there are some for infants cut off at the moment of their birth. We saw them 

from ten inches to three feet four inches long, the skeletons in them being bent together. They are 

all ranged near each other, and are so entire that not a rib or a phalanx is wanting. The bones 

have been prepared in three

that night. He wrote them for me to fit the Doctor's words.'" Then Henry unfolded the other sheet; 

and there, sure enough, was the air, evidently copied by the girl from the melody written by the 

Gilded Youth. And clearly it was the theme of the Tschaicovski melody from the first movement of 

the Sixth Symphony, that dominated the air.[Footnote: For the melody which the Gilded Youth 

wrote to the Young Doctor's verses the reader should see appendix "A."] The fine thoroughbred 

nerve of him, trying to signal that air back to her, and to play the game of courage to us! Henry 

read the verses; they were headed "A Soldier's Song." They were very much such rhymes as we 

wrote when we were young. They ran:     Love, though these hands, that rest in thine so dear, 

Back into dust may crumble with the year;    Love, though these lips, that meet thy lips so true, 

Soon may be grass that stores the morning dew--    O Love, know well, that this fond heart of 

mine,    manners, either whitened in the air and the sun, dyed red with anoto, or, like mummies, 

varnished with odoriferous resins, and enveloped in leaves of the heliconia or of the plantain-tree. 

The Indians informed us that the fresh corpse is placed in damp ground, that the flesh may be 

consumed by degrees; some months afterwards it is taken out, and the flesh remaining on the 

bones is scraped off with sharp stones. Several hordes in Guiana still observe this custom. 

Earthen vases half-baked are found near the mapires or baskets. They appear to contain the 

bones of the same family. The largest of these vases, or funeral urns, are five feet high, and three 

feet three inches long. Their colour is greenish-grey, and their oval form is pleasing to the eye. The 

handles are made in the shape of crocodiles or serpents; the edges are bordered with painted 

meanders, labyrinths, and grecques, in rows variously combined. Such designs are found in every 

zone among nations 


_
Love, though our dreams shall have no hope but this;    Love, though our faith shall be our rarest 

bliss;    Love, though the years may bring their death and chill,    Love, though our blood shall lose 

its passion, still--    Still, Love, know well that this heart is divine,    It shall be always--always, 

thine!   Henry sat holding the sheet and looking through the wall of the room their respective 

positions on the globe, or to the degree of civilization which they have attained. They still adorn the 

common pottery made by the inhabitants of the little mission of Maypures; they ornament the 

bucklers of the Otaheitans, the fishing-implements of the Esquimaux, the walls of the Mexican 

palace of Mitla, and the vases of ancient Greece.  We could not acquire any
