philodendron monstera situation." He became very solemn, showing that he had at last reached the real point.

and found the whale-line was still attached to the bow. I went back to the stern and sat on the after 

thwart, thinking of the gun. I felt in the bottom of the boat for it, but could not find it. It must have 

fallen overboard when I fell down.  As I was groping, I felt an object in the bottom of the boat that I 

knew at once was the boat's lantern keg, which is kept in all whale-boats. In it are flint, tinder, a 

lantern, candles, and packed all around them are ship's biscuits. Instantly the memory of our 

officers' instructions in reference to their use came to me.  Quickly taking the keg to the stern of 

the boat, I struck its end against the loggerhead. It soon yielded to my pounding, and the head fell 

out. How sweet the hard pilot-bread tasted! It brought to my remembrance the water-keg which is 

also kept in a whale-boat.  I went to the midship thwart, and found the keg there, lashed firmly 

beneath it. I loosened it and drank heartily. Then I took the lantern and tinder from the keg, and 

striking the flint, I soon had one of the candles lighted. I sat down on the after thwart and held the 

light aloft till my arm ached.  Everything about me was made more weird by the gleam of the 

lantern. The swish of the water as it rippled beneath the boat and the to argue, from the mere 

existence of a picture, that a tremendous deceit had been successfully practised upon the most 

formidable of nations, implies rather more than rashness on the part of the arguer.  "But I don't 

want it to get about," said Priam, still in a savage whisper. "And I don't want to talk about it." He 

looked at the nearest midgets resentfully, suspecting them of eavesdropping.  "Precisely," said Mr. 

Oxford, but in a tone that lacked conviction.  "It's a matter that only concerns me," said Priam. 

"Precisely," Mr. Oxford repeated. "At least it _ought_ to concern only you. And I can't assure you 

too positively that I'm the last person in the world to want to pry; but--"  "You must kindly 

remember," said Priam, interrupting, "that you bought that picture this morning simply _as_ a 

picture, on its merits. You have no authority to attach my name to it, and I must ask you not to do 

so."  "Certainly," agreed Mr. Oxford. "I bought it as a masterpiece, and I'm quite content with my 

bargain. I want no signature."  "I haven't signed my pictures for twenty years," said Priam. 

"Pardon me," said Mr. Oxford. "Every square inch of every one is unmistakably signed. You could 

not put a brush on a canvas without signing it. It is the privilege of

floating carcass set me to thinking of the ship, and I wondered if they would see the light and come 

to my rescue. I did not know what time it was, but judged it must he near midnight. I tried to call, 

but my own voice frightened me--it sounded so strange; so once more I relapsed into silence. 

Suddenly something seemed to be the matter with the whale. I thought I heard a sound like some 

one falling letters on the corners of their pictures in order to keep other painters from taking the 

credit for them afterwards. For me, all your pictures are signed. But there are some people who 

want more proof than connoisseurship can give, and that's where the trouble is going to be." 

"Trouble?" said Priam, with an intensification of his misery.  "Yes," said Mr. Oxford. "I must tell 

you, so that you can
