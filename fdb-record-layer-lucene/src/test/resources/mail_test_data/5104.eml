stop them close. Keep this in a dry Place.  It is to be remark'd, that besides this Syrup is very 

cooling; its use is to colour stew'd Apples, or Puddings, or any sweet Preparation made with Flour 

or Fruit: for in itself it carries no Flavour that will be predominant over that of another Fruit.    Of 

_Syrup_ of _Raspberries, Currans,_ or other Fruits. From the same.  These Syrups are made like 

the former, by pressing out the Juice with the Hands; because if the Seeds are broken, they would 

have an ill Taste. Treat these in the making just in the same way as the former, and use them in 

the same manner, to colour any sweet Preparation; but remember, where you put any of the 

Raspberry Syrup, the Flavour of the Raspberry will prevail.    To make a _Raspberry-_Pudding. 

From the same.  Take a Pint of Cream, and grate into it four Penny _Naples_ Biscuits; then take 

the Yolks of eight hard Eggs chopt and broken small; then beat four Eggs and put in two spoonfuls 

of Flour, and as much Powder of double-refined Sugar; then put in as much Syrup of Raspberries 

as you think proper to give it a Flavour and a Colour. If you find that your Composition is not thick 

enough, you may grate in more _Naples_ Biscuit. Mix all this well together, and, if you will, make a 

fine Crust roll'd thin and laid in a Dish, and bake it in a gentle Oven.    _Parsnip-Cakes._ From the 



same.  Scrape some Parsnip-Roots, and slice them thin, dry them in an Oven and beat them to 

Powder; mix them then with an equal quantity of Flour, and make them up with Cream and Spices 

powder'd; then mould them into Cakes, and bake them in a gentle Oven. _N.B._ The sweetness of 

the Parsnip Powder answers the want of Sugar.    To make _Raspberry_ bak'd Cakes. From the 

same.  Take Potatoes and boil them, and when they are peel'd, beat them in a Marble Mortar with 

half the Quantity of fine Sugar powder'd; then put in some of your Raspberry Syrup, till it is 

coloured with it, and make up your Cakes in fine Sugar powder'd. Then dry them, or bake them, in 

a gentle Oven, _Note_, these Cakes should be made thin.    Of _Ortolans._ From Mr. _Renaud._ 

The _Ortolan_ is a Bird brought from _France_, and is fed in large Cages with Canary-Seeds till 

they become a lump of Fat; and when they are fully fatted, they must be killed, or else they will 

feed upon their own Flesh. When we kill them, you must take them by the Beak, and holding it 

close between your Finger and Thumb, the Bird will be stifled in about a Minute; then pick off the 

Feathers even those of the Head, and pass a fine Skewer through them, just under the Wings, and 

roast them quick;

copy, if a defect in the       electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of 

receipt of the work.      - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free       Toasts 

under them to drip upon. Serve them with strong Gravey, and as much White Wine hot, and 

garnish with Slices of Lemon and Raspings of Bread sifted and toasted before the Fire.    To make 

_Sugar Comfits_ of any Sort. From Mrs. _Anne Shepherd_ of _Norwich._  The Seeds which we 

generally make Comfitts of, are Carraways, Coriander and Anise-Seeds; these, when they are 

cover'd with Sugar, are call'd Comfits, (_Confects_).  The Instruments to be employ'd for this Use, 

are first a deep-bottom'd Bason of Bell-Metal, or Brass, well tinn'd, to be hung over some hot 

Coals.  Secondly, You must have a broad Pan to put hot Coals in.  Thirdly, Provide a Brass Ladle 

to pour the Sugar upon the Seeds.  Fourthly, You must have a Brass Slice to scrape off the Sugar 

that may chance to hang upon the side of the hanging Bason.  Then take care that your Seeds are 

dry, or dry them well in your hanging Pan.  To every quarter of a Pound of Seeds use two Pounds 

of fine Sugar beaten; unless to Anise-Seeds, use two Pounds of Sugar to half a Pound of Seeds. 

To begin the Work, put three Pounds of fine Sugar into the Bason with one Pint of Water, to be 

stirr'd well together till

1.E.9.   If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} 

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must 

obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The 

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} 

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.   1.F.   1.F.1.   Project 

Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research 

on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project 

Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE 

MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain 

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a 

copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, 

a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.   1.F.2. 

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the "Right of Replacement or 

Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the 

owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark, and any other party 

distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work under this agreement, 

disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE 

THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF 

WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT it gently, till the Sugar will rope from the 

Ladle like Turpentine, and it is enough. Keep this however warm, upon warm Embers, that it may 

run. freely in a ropy Way from the Ladle upon the Seeds.  When this is ready, move the Seeds 

briskly in the Bason, and fling on them half a ladle-full at a time of the hot Sugar, keeping the 

Seeds moving for some time; which will make them take the Sugar the better, and be sure to dry 

them well after every covering, by moving the Bason, and stirring the Comfits. In an Hour, you may 

make three Pounds of Comfits: you will know when they are coated enough with Sugar, by their 

becoming as large as you would have them. There is no certain Rule, but our own Fancies, for the 

Size of them. _Note_, Till they are as you would have them, cast on more melted Sugar, as at first, 

and keep them stirring and shaking in the Pan, drying them well after every Coat of Sugar.  If you 

would have ragged or rough Comfits, make your Sugar so liquid, that it will run from the Ladle; and 

let it fall upon the Seeds about a Foot and a half high. Let it be very hot, for the hotter it is, the 

rougher will be your Comfits; and for all that, the Comfits will not take so much Sugar as one may 

imagine from their Appearance. Put on at each time only one Ladle-full, and in ten times repeating 

it your Comfits will be perfectly well coated.  For plain Comfits; let not your melted Sugar be too 

hot at first, nor too thick; neither pour it on the Seeds too high: but the last two or three Coverings 

may be thicker and hotter.  As for Coriander-Seeds, which are large, three Pounds of Sugar will 

only cover a quarter of a Pound of them.  While your are at work, you

FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS 

AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, 

CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF 

THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.   1.F.3.   LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person 

you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the 

medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective 

work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work

limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-

IS,' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT 

NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS that it may not gather 

into Lumps, or burn to the bottom of the Pan; and to prevent its growing too thick at any time, put 

to it a spoonful or two of Water, gently stirring it now and then with your Ladle, keeping your Fire 

very clear under your Pan. When your Comfits are made, put them upon Papers in Dishes, and 

set them before the Fire, or in a declining Oven, which will make them look of a Snow white; when 

they are cool, put them in Boxes, or in crystal Bottles.    To make _Comfits_ of various Colours. 

From the same.  If you would have your Comfits of a red Colour, infuse some red Saunders in the 

Water till it is deep colour'd enough; or else take some Cochineel, and infuse it till the Liquor is red 

enough; or put some Syrup of Mulberries with Water to the Sugar.  If of a yellow Colour; use 

Saffron in Water, which you are to mix with the Sugar.  If Green; take the Juice of Spinach, and 

boil it with the Sugar: so will your Comfits be of the several Colours above-mention'd.    To 

preserve _Orange_ and _Lemons-Peels_ in Jelly. From the same.  Cut some of the fairest 

Oranges and Lemons in halves; then scoop out all the Pulp and Inside, and boil them in several 

Waters till they are so tender, that you may pass a Straw through them; then wash them in cold 

Water.  Boil then the following

make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or 

unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining Water to every 

Pound of Peel; and in it some thin Slices of Golden-Pippins, or Golden Rennets, till the Water 

becomes slippery. Then to this Water, add as much Sugar as will boil it to a strong Syrup; then put 

in your Peels and scald them, and set them by till the Day following, and boil them again till the 

Syrup will jelly. Then put your Peels into your Glasses, and put into your Syrup the Juice of three 

large Oranges, and one Lemon strain'd, and boil it till it will make a
