speaking of the tyrant, says, =E2=80=98Shall I call him king? shall I call =
him prince? shall I preserve my=20

allegiance to him? Oh no: he is an enemy to the public welfare. May I emplo=
y conspiracies and=20

open force against him? It is very proper and necessary so to do,=E2=80=94f=
or there is not a more=20

agreeable sacrifice than the blood of a tyrant, and it is insupportable to =
receive blame for having=20

done good.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98I come now to my three authorities from the c=
ivilians. As I am no lawyer, it will suffice=20

if I mention the judgments that have been given without producing them; for=
 in my life I never=20

studied the canon nor civil law more than two years, and twenty years have =
passed since that=20

time, so that what little I may have learnt I have quite forgotten since th=
e period of my studies.=20

=E2=80=98The first authority of the civil law is, That any one may put to d=
eath deserters from the laws of=20

chivalry; and who can be a greater deserter from chivalry than him who dese=
rts the person of his=20

king, the fountain of chivalry, and without whom it cannot long exist?  =E2=
=80=98Secondly, It is lawful for=20

every one to kill thieves and robbers, who infest forests and rob on the hi=
ghways,=E2=80=94because they=20

are particularly the enemies of the public weal, and consequently plotting =
to destroy all travellers:=20

consequently, it is lawful to kill a tyrant, who is continually practising =
against his king, the=20

sovereign lord, and against the public good.  =E2=80=98Thirdly, If it be la=
wful for any one by the civil and=20

imperial law to put to death a thief found by night in a house, it is readi=
ly understood by judge and=20

jurors. Otherwise the usefulness of the medical expert is very much decreas=
ed. The description=20

should also be precise and sufficient to justify the conclusions arrived at=
 as to the cause of a=20

wound, its gravity and results, and the weapon used. With a view to exact s=
tatement in description,=20

it is well to take notes as to the result of the examination and not depend=
 merely on memory. The=20

object of the witness should be to be understood and not to be thought thor=
oughly scientific.=20

WAS THE INJURY INFLICTED BEFORE OR AFTER DEATH?  This is a question which m=
ay=20

often be asked in cases of fatal injuries, and it is one which must be answ=
ered as definitely as we=20

are able, for the defence may rest on the assertion that the wound or injur=
y was post mortem and=20

not ante mortem. What are the means we have to enable us to answer the abov=
e question? The=20

most important factor is the condition of the blood and the changes that it=
 undergoes after death.=20

For some hours after death the body retains its animal heat. As long as thi=
s is retained rigor mortis=20

does not set in and the blood is more or less fluid. This period varies, bu=
t on the average it does=20

not last longer than eight or ten hours. Before this time, however, the blo=
od has begun to undergo=20

certain changes. These changes result in the inability of the blood from a =
post-mortem wound to=20

coagulate completely. At first the greater part may coagulate, but after a =
time coagulation is less=20

and less complete, and the coagula are not as firm as=20


_
slay a tyrant, who day and night devises the death of his sovereign lord. T=
his consequence clearly=20

follows, and will be apparent to any man of sound understanding, if he cons=
ider it, and the=20

antecedent texts from holy writ.  =E2=80=98Before I touch on the three exam=
ples from the holy Scriptures, I=20

wish to reply to some objections that may be made to what I say, in blood o=
f a living person. The=20

period at which these changes occur also varies, but they may generally be =
clearly noticed in from=20

three to four hours after death, or even sooner. In the first two to four h=
ours after death, therefore,=20

as far as the condition of the blood is concerned, it may be difficult or i=
mpossible to say whether a=20

wound was made before or=20
