I have to. They tell me you're handling this end of it for the railroad company, and I'm not going 

around hunting a chance to make enemies. That's all I've got to say"--and he rose to go--"all but 

this: you've got a lot to learn about this something-for-something business, and the quicker you get 

at it, Mr. Blount, the sooner you'll arrive somewhere. About this little matter of ours, there's no 

special hurry. Take your own time to think it over; take it up with McVickar, if you want to. Then, 

when you get things fixed, wire me one word to Twin Buttes. Just say 'Yes,' and sign your name to 

it. That'll be enough."  For a long half-hour after the president of the Twin Buttes Lumber Company 

and its allied corporations had closed the door of the private office behind him, Blount sat rocking 

gently in his pivot-chair. In the fulness of time the bitter thoughts wrought their way into words. 

"So this is what I was hired for!" he mused, "a fence; a wretched mask put up to hide the trickery 

and chicanery and criminality--the crookedness which has never been put aside; which nobody 

ever meant to put aside! My God! they've let me stultify myself in a thousand ways; let me sit here 

day after day with a lie in my mouth, saying things that nobody in this God-forsaken homeland of 

mine has country as they passed through it, and especially the steamers on their way to India and 

China. After dinner the company gathered in the music-room; but it was observed that the 

commander and Dr. Hawkes were absent. They had remained in the cabin, and were in 

conversation.  "What is the present condition of your patient, Doctor?" asked the captain as soon 

as they were alone.  "He is doing very well, and is in a fair way to recover in a short time," replied 

the surgeon.  "After we get through the Red Sea, we strike out on a voyage of ten days or more, 

and I am not anxious to retain this villain on board," continued the captain. "I owe him nothing, 

though I shall treat him with common humanity. In a word, I wish to get rid of him as soon as 

possible."  "There is nothing in his present condition to prevent you from putting him on shore at 

any time,--to-night, if you are so disposed," replied Dr. Hawkes in decided terms.  "You would 

oblige me very much, Doctor, by broaching this subject to him. I suppose he has money, though I 

know nothing about it, and he can pay his way at one of the hotels here," suggested the captain. 

"We had the United States Consul with us at dinner, as you are aware, and he can inform you 

whether or not there is a hospital here. I will see Mazagan at once,

minute! After it's all over, every man who has listened to me will say that I _knew_--that all this talk 

about openness and fair dealing was simply that much dust-throwing to hide the workings of a 

corrupt and criminal machine grinding away in the background!"  in half an hour," said the 

surgeon, as he went forward to the hospital.  Captain Ringgold went to the music-room, where the 

consul was enjoying himself in listening to Miss Blanche, who was giving him some account of the 

voyage; and she had just mentioned "The

weight. The sight gave an added twist to the torture screw and he broke out again.  "I've been 

nothing more than a bit of potter's clay, and the master potter--God help me!--is my own father! It's 

all plain enough now. He saw that I wasn't going to fall in which the consul wished to know more. 

The captain called him aside, and proceeded to question him in regard to the care of the patient in 

the town.  "I have a wounded man on board, and I wish to get rid of him," he began.  "Wounded in 

the battle of which Miss Woolridge was telling me?" asked the official.  "Precisely so; but he is not 

of my party, and is
