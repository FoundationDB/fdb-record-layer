shall be blown, and they that are in the heavens and they that are in the earth shall die, except 

those whom God shall please. Then it shall be blown another time; and lo, they shall arise, 

waiting.  And the earth shall shine with the light of its Lord. And the book shall be placed, and the 

prophets shall be brought and the witnesses, and judgment shall be given between them with 

truth, and they shall not be treated unjustly.  And every soul shall be fully paid _the reward_ of 

what it hath done, and He well knoweth what they do.  And those who have disbelieved shall be 

driven in troops unto hell, until when they come to it, its gates shall be opened, and its guardians 

shall say unto them, 'Did not Messengers from among you come unto you rehearsing the signs of 

your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this your day?' They shall answer, 'Yea:' (But the 

sentence of punishment[138] hath been justly pronounced against the unbelievers:)  It shall be 

said, 'Enter ye the gates of hell to remain therein for ever:' and evil shall be the abode of the 

proud.   And those who have feared their Lord shall be urged on in troops unto paradise, until 

when they come unto it, its gates are already opened, and its guardians say unto them: 'Peace be 

on you! Ye have been good: therefore enter it to abide _therein_ for ever.'  And they shall say, 

'Praise be to God, who hath performed unto us His promise, and hath made us to inherit the land, 

that we may dwell in Paradise wheresoever we please; and how excellent is the reward of the 

workers!'[139]  And thou shalt see the angels encompassing the throne, extolling the perfection

shall be said,'Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds!'     (xxxix. 67-75.)   XLVII.  Paradise shall

_His laws_,  Who hath feared the Compassionate in secret, and come with a penitent heart:  Enter 

it in peace: this is the Day of Eternity.'     (l. 30-33.)   XLVIII.  [+]Fairseeming to men is the love of 

pleasures from women and children, and hoarded riches of gold and silver, and pastured[141] 

horses, and flocks, and corn-fields. Such is the enjoyment of this world's life! But God, goodly is 

the home with Him!  SAY, Shall I tell you of better things than these prepared in the presence of 

their Lord for those that fear [God]? Theirs shall be gardens beneath which rivers run, and in which 

they shall abide for ever, and stainless wives, and acceptance with God: for God regardeth His 

servants,  --Who say, 'O our Lord, verily we have believed; forgive us then our sins, and keep us 

from the torment of the fire,'--  The patient, and the truthful, and the lowly, and the charitable, and 

they who seek pardon at each daybreak.     (iii. 12-15.)   XLIX.  [+]And repute not those slain in 

God's cause[142] to be dead: nay, alive with their Lord, they are provided for;  Joyful in what God 

of His bounty hath vouchsafed them, and rejoicing for those that follow after them, but have not yet 

overtaken them, that on them no fear shall come, neither shall they grieve;  Rejoicing at the favour 

of God and His bounty, and that God suffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish.     (iii. 163-

165.)   L.  Whosoever doeth the things that are right, whether male or female, being a believer,--

these shall enter paradise, and shall not be wronged in the least degree.     (iv. 123.)   LI.  For 

those who have disbelieved in their Lord [is prepared] the punishment of hell; and evil [shall be] 

the journey.[143]  When they shall be cast into it they shall hear it braying,[144] while it boileth, 

well-nigh bursting with fury.     (lxvii. 6-8.)   LII.  If thou shouldst see[145] those who have 

offended[146] when they see the punishment![147]--for power belongeth altogether unto God, and 

God is severe in punishing:  When those who have been followed will declare themselves clear of 

those who have followed [them],[148] when they have seen the punishment, and the ties [that 

bound them together] shall be severed from them:  And those who have followed shall say, 'O that 

there were for us a return _to the world_! then would we declare ourselves clear of them, like as 

they have _now_ declared themselves clear of us!' After this manner will God show them their 

_evil_ works, for which [they shall pour forth] lamentations; and they shall not come forth from the 

fire.     (ii. 160-162.)   LIII.  And the Devil[149] shall say, when the matter shall have been 

determined,[150] 'Verily God promised you the promise of truth;[151] and I promised you,[152] but 

I deceived you: yet had I no power over you;  But I only called you and ye answered me. Therefore 

blame not me, but blame your own selves. I am not a helper of you, neither are ye helpers of me. 

Verily I renounce your having associated me _with God_ heretofore.'     (xiv. 26, 27).   LIV.  Verily 

the hypocrites shall be in the lowest abyss of the fire, and thou shalt not find for them any 

defender.     (iv. 144.)   LV.  They[153] will ask thee respecting the Hour,[154] at what time is its 

coming fixed. SAY, The knowledge of it is only with my Lord: none shall manifest it in its time but 

He. It is grievous in the heavens and in the earth. It shall not come upon you otherwise than 

suddenly.  They will ask thee as though thou wert well acquainted therewith. SAY, The knowledge 

of it is only with God: but the greater number of men know not!  SAY, I possess not for myself 

_power to procure_ advantage nor _to avert_ mischief, save as God pleaseth: and if I knew things 

unseen, I should obtain abundance of good, and evil should not happen unto me. I am only a 

denouncer of threats _unto the unbelievers_, and an announcer of good tidings unto the people 

who believe.     (vii. 186-188.)     _PREDESTINATION._   LVI.  A soul cannot die unless by 

permission of God, according to a writing _of God_, definite _as to time_.     (iii. 139.)   LVII.  They 



say [whose companions were slain at the battle of Ohod], 'If aught of the affair had been 

_submitted_ to us we had not been slain here.'[155] SAY, Had ye been in your houses, those _of 

you_ who were decreed to be States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

CHAMPDIVERS AND CHARLES VI. After the painting by Albrecht de Vriendt. The king, now often 

idiotic when he was not raving,... To amuse and distract him, and also to strengthen the 

Burgundian influence, the Duke of Burgundy provided him with a fair child as playmate and 

mistress. To the sway once held by Valentine over Charles there now succeeded Odette. She was 

little more than a child, but she became mistress as well as playfellow of the mad king. Of humble 

origin (daughter of a horse dealer), she wears in court history a name better than that she was 

born to, Odette de Champdivers; and the people, indulgent of the sin of the mad king, called her 

"la petite reine" She was happy, it seems, and kind to the king, amused him, was loved by him; 

and, more true to him than was quite pleasing to the Burgundians, did not play false to France in 



later years when Burgundy and England were leagued together.]     Woman  In all ages and in all

London    TO M. L. B. AND J. P. B.     PREFACE  IT is the customary privilege of the author to 

meet you at the threshold, as it were, bid you welcome, and in his own person explain more fully 

and freely than he may elsewhere the plan and intent of his book. After you have crossed this

(iii. 148.)   LVIII.  Wheresoever ye be, death will overtake you, although you be in lofty towers. If 

good fortune betide them,[156] they say, 'This is from God!' But if evil betide them, they say, 'This 

is from thee, _O Mohammad_!' SAY, All is from God. And what aileth this people that they are not 

near to understanding what is said _unto them_?  Whatsoever good betideth thee, _O man, it is_ 

from God; and whatsoever evil betideth thee, from thyself _is it_.     (iv. 80, 81.)   LIX.  [+]No soul 

can believe but by the permission of God.     (x. 100.)   LX.  [+]And whoso willeth taketh the way to 

his Lord: But ye shall not will it, unless God will it.     (lxxvi. 29, 30.)   LXI.  [+]Expend in the way of 

God, and throw not yourselves into destruction.[157]     (ii. 191.)   _ANGELS AND JINN._[158] 

LXII.  They say, 'The Compassionate hath yourself, weigh and consider, and condemn even with 

scant regard for the author's feelings; for as a guest it is your privilege. But here outside I am still 

speaking as one with authority and unabashed; for I know not, and will not let myself fancy, how 

the reader will censure me. Though the little that need be said may be said briefly, I trust the 

reader will be a reader gentle enough to permit me graciously this word of general comment upon 

the whole work.  From the mediaeval _Ladies' Book_, of a kind that will be referred to in the 

following pages, to the very latest volume of _Social England_, or more aptly, perhaps, to the most 

local and frivolous _Woman's World_ edited by an Eve in your daily paper, all the little repositories 

of ebbing gossip help immensely in the composition of a picture of the life of any period. They are 

not

His purity! Nay, _they are_ honoured servants.  They prevent Him not in speech,[160] and 

according to His command they act.  He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, 

and they shall not intercede  Save for whom He shall please, and they fear in dread of Him.  And 

him[161] among them who saith, 'I am a god beside Him,' that [angel] We will recompense with 

Hell.     (xxi. 26-30.)   LXIII.  [+]SAY, It hath been revealed to me that a company of the Jinn 

listened [to me] and said, 'Verily we have heard a wonderful discourse[162]  Which guideth unto 

right: wherefore we believed in it, and we will by no means associate any one with our Lord....  We 

tried the heaven, but we found it filled with a mighty garrison and darting flames;  We sat on some 

of its seats to listen, but whosoever listeneth now findeth a darting flame in ambush for him.  We 

know not whether evil be meant for them that are on the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth for 

them a right guidance.  There are among us the good, and among us _those who are_ not so,--we 

are of various ways.     (lxxii. 1, 2, 8-11.)     _TRUE RELIGION AND FALSE._   LXIV.  Verily God 

commandeth justice and the doing of good and the giving unto the relation: and He forbiddeth 

wickedness and iniquity and oppression. He admonisheth you that ye may reflect.     (xvi. 92.)[163] 

LXV.      [+]By the Night when she spreadeth her veil,    By the Day when it appeareth in glory, 

By Him who made male and generations ago they were neglected if not scorned; but more and 

more are they coming to their own as material for history. In like manner the volume hardly claims 

to be a formal history, but rather ancillary to history. It has been the aim to present pictures from 

history, scenes from the lives of historic women, but above and through all to give as definite an 

idea as might be of the life of women at various periods in the history of mediaeval France.  The 

keenness of your appetite for the repast spread will be the measure of the author's success. But 

whether I have been successful or not, the purpose was as has been said. Figures more or less 

familiar in history have been selected as the centrepieces; but scarcely anywhere have I felt 

myself bound to expound at length the political history of France: that was a business in which few 

women had a controlling voice, however lively their interest may have been, however pitifully or 

tragically their fate may have been influenced by battle or politics or mere masculine capricious 

passion.          "Theirs not to reason why;         Theirs but to do or die,"  may be said of the soldier. 

Of these women of mediaeval France, as of all in the good days of old, it might be better said that 

it was not even theirs to do; the relief of action was not theirs; but to suffer and to die, without 

question. Yet the life was not all pain and suffering and sadness, as the scenes depicted will show. 

It is merely that the 


_
Verily your aims are indeed different!    As then for him who giveth [alms] and feareth [God],    And 

yieldeth assent to the Good,    To him will We therefore make easy the path to happiness.    But as 

to him who is covetous and bent on riches,    And calleth the Good a lie,    To him will We make 

easy the path to distress;    And what shall his wealth avail him perishes too often with the age that 

laughed at it--while the tears have left their stain.  With this little hint to the reader I have done, and 

let the book tell him more if he please. To those who helped me in the writing of, nay, who made it 

possible to write this book, my gratitude is none the less strong that I do not write them down in 

the catalogue. Many a
