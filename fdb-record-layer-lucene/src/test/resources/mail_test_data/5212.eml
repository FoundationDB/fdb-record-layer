all is Akasha(828) (followed by [only] four, each of which becomes grosser than its predecessor), if 

made from the Esoteric standpoint, is erroneous. For once Akasha, an almost homogeneous and 

certainly universal Principle, is translated Ether, then Akasha is dwarfed and limited to our visible 

Universe, for assuredly it is not the Ether of Space. Ether, whatever Modern Science makes of it, 

is differentiated Substance; Akasha, having no attributes save one--SOUND, _of which it is the 

substratum_--is no substance even exoterically and in the minds of some Orientalists,(829) but 

rather Chaos, or the Great Spatial Void.(830)  Esoterically, Akasha alone is _Divine_ Space, and 

becomes Ether only on the lowest and last plane, or our visible Universe and Earth. In this case 

the blind is in the word "attribute," which is said to be Sound. But Sound is no attribute of Akasha, 

but its primary correlation, its primordial manifestation, the LOGOS, or Divine Ideation made Word, 

and that "WORD" made "Flesh." Sound may be considered an "attribute" of Akasha only on the 

condition of anthropomorphizing the latter. It is not a characteristic of it, though it is certainly as 

innate in it as the idea "I am _I_" is innate in our thoughts.  Occultism teaches that Akasha 

contains and includes the seven Centres of Force, therefore the six Tattvas, of which it is the 

seventh, or rather their synthesis. But if Akasha be taken, as we believe it is in this case, to 

represent only the exoteric idea, then the author is right; because, seeing that Akasha is 

universally omnipresent, following the Pauranic limitation, _for the better comprehension of our 

finite intellects_, he places its commencement only beyond the four planes of our Earth 

Chain,(831) the two higher Tattvas being as concealed to the average mortal as the sixth and 

seventh senses are to the materialistic mind.  Therefore, while Sanskrit and Hindu Philosophy 

generally speak of five Tattvas only, Occultists name seven, thus making them correspond with 

every septenary in Nature. The Tattvas stand in the same order as the seven macro- and micro-

cosmic Forces: and as taught in Esotericism, are as follows:  (1) ADI TATTVA, the primordial 

universal Force, issuing at the beginning of manifestation, or of the "creative" period, from the 

eternal immutable Sat, the substratum of ALL. It corresponds with the Auric Envelope or Brahma's 

Egg, which surrounds every globe, as well as every man, animal and thing. It is the vehicle 

containing potentially everything--Spirit and Substance, Force and Matter. Adi Tattva, in Esoteric 

Cosmogony, is the Force which we refer to as proceeding from the First or Unmanifested LOGOS. 

(2) ANUPADAKA TATTVA,(832) the first differentiation on the plane of being--the first being an 

ideal one--or that which is born by transformation from something higher than itself. With the 

Occultists, this Force proceeds from the Second LOGOS.  (3) AKASHA TATTVA, this is the point 

from which all _exoteric_ Philosophies and Religions start. Akasha Tattva is explained in them as 

Etheric Force, Ether. Hence Jupiter, the "highest" God, was named after Pater AEther; Indra, once 

the like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake.  The work of revolt 

continued the whole night thus. The next morning, on awaking, Paris seemed to be startled at her 

own appearance. It was like a besieged town. Armed men, shouldering muskets, watched over the 

barricades with menacing looks; words of command, patrols, arrests, executions, even, were 

encountered at every step. Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made 

to cry, "Long live Broussel!" "Down with Mazarin!" and whoever refused to comply with this 

ceremony was hooted at, spat upon and even beaten. They had not yet begun to slay, but it was 

well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting.  The barricades had been pushed as far as 

the Palais Royal. From the Rue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie, from the Rue Saint 



Thomas-du-Louvre to the Pont Neuf, from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte Saint Honore, there were 

more than ten thousand armed men; those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive 

sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal, the gates of which were 

closed behind them, a precaution which made their situation precarious. Among these thousands 

moved, in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred, pale and haggard men, clothed in 

rags, who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words: "Behold the misery of the 

people!" Wherever these men passed, frenzied cries were heard; and there were so many of 

these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions.  The astonishment of Mazarin and of 

Anne of Austria was great when it was announced to them that the city, which the previous 

evening they had left entirely tranquil, had awakened to such feverish commotion; nor would either 

the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them, declaring they would rather rely 

on the evidence of their own eyes and ears. Then a window was opened and when they saw and 

heard they were convinced.  Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the 

populace; but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet, trembling all over, locked up his gold and 

jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers. As for the queen, furious, and left 

to her own guidance, she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many 

men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry.  The marshal was 

ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing; and he had that lofty contempt for 

the populace which army officers usually profess. He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted 

to go out by the Pont du Louvre, but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen, attended by 

more than five hundred men. The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up 

the quay. But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois. This time the marshal charged, 

but he was welcomed by musket shots, while stones fell like hail from all the windows. He left 

there three men.  He beat a retreat toward the market, but there he met Planchet with his 

halberdiers; their halberds were leveled at 


_
heavenly expanse, and so with Uranus, etc. The Christian biblical God, also, is spoken of as the 

Holy Ghost, Pneuma, rarefied wind or air. This the Occultists call the Force of the Third LOGOS, 

the Creative Force in the already Manifested Universe.  (4) VAYU TATTVA, the aerial plane where 

substance is gaseous.  (5) TAIJAS TATTVA, the plane of our atmosphere, from _tejas_, luminous. 

(6) APAS TATTVA, watery or liquid substance or force.  (7) PRITHIVI TATTVA, solid earthly 

substance, the terrestrial spirit or force, the lowest of all.  All these correspond to our Principles, 

and to the seven senses and forces in man. According to the Tattva or Force generated or 

induced in us, so will our bodies act.  Now, what I have to say here is addressed especially to 

those members who are anxious to develop powers by "sitting attempted to ride over those gray 

cloaks, but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore, 

leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle.  The marshal then entered the Rue Saint 

Honore, but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache. They 

were guarded, not only by armed men, but even by women and children. Master Friquet, the 

owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him, had organized a company of 

rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket.  The marshal thought this barrier not so 

well fortified as the others and determined to break through it. He dismounted twenty men to make 

a breach in the barricade, whilst he and others, remaining on their horses, were to protect the 

assailants. The twenty men 


_
what has been already said, that in the development of Raja Yoga, no extant works made public 

are of the least good; they can at best give inklings of Hatha Yoga, something that may develop 

mediumship at best, and in the worst case--consumption. If those who practice "meditation," and 

try to learn "the Science of Breath," will read attentively _Nature's Finer Forces_, they will find that 

it is by utilizing the five Tattvas only that this dangerous science is acquired. For in the exoteric 

Yoga Philosophy, and the Hatha Yoga practice, Akasha Tattva is placed in the head (or physical 

brain) of man; Tejas Tattva in the shoulders; Vayu Tattva in the navel (the seat of all the phallic 

Gods, "creators" of the universe and man); Apas Tattva in the knees; and Prithivi Tattva in the 

feet. Hence the two higher Tattvas and their correspondences are ignored toward the barrier, but 

from behind the beams, from among the wagon-wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible 

fusillade burst forth and at the same time Planchet's halberdiers appeared at the corner of the 

Cemetery of the Innocents, and Louvieres's bourgeois at the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie. 

The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires, but he was brave and made up his 

mind to die where he was. He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the 

crowd. The guards, more skillful, did greater execution; but the bourgeois, more numerous, 

overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron. Men fell around him as they had fallen at 

Rocroy or at Lerida. Fontrailles, his aide-de-camp, had an arm broken; his horse had received a 

bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him, maddened by pain. 


_
and, as these are the chief factors in Raja Yoga, no spiritual or intellectual phenomena of a high 

nature can take place. The best results obtainable will be physical phenomena and no more. As 

the "Five Breaths," or rather the five states of the human breath, in Hatha Yoga correspond to the 

above _terrestrial_ planes and colours, what spiritual results can be obtained? On the contrary, 

they are the very reverse of the plane of Spirit, or the higher macrocosmic plane, reflected as they 

are upside down, in the Astral Light. short, he had reached that supreme moment when the 

bravest feel a shudder in their veins, when suddenly, in the direction of the Rue de l'Arbre-Sec, the 

crowd opened, crying: "Long live the coadjutor!" and Gondy, in surplice and cloak, appeared, 

moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left, 

as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu.  All fell to their knees. The 

marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him.  "Get me out of this, in Heaven's
