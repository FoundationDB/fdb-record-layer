=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan--

=E2=80=9Cno. I was not thinking just then of what I have seen, but of what =
I am about to see.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are=20

man! Of what are you afraid?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf the face of Majesty,=E2=

only answered, with a rather nervous laugh, =E2=80=9CFirst interviews are t=
rying.=E2=80=9D Yet he knew that this was=20

not, for him, a first interview with his sovereign. He felt beneath his dou=
blet for the precious piece=20

of gold, the cherished souvenir of his boyhood, as if to assure himself tha=
t the great Emperor, into=20

whose presence he was going, was really the kind young boyar who had promis=

serve him one day.  =E2=80=9CDear Barrinka,=E2=80=9D pleaded Michael, =E2=

 will serve him _so_=20

d told me I would never make a soldier.=20

But the Czar will listen to _you_.=E2=80=9D  Ivan smiled doubtfully. In his=
 heart he wished that the poor=20

mujik=E2=80=99s child-like idea of his sovereign had been his own also. The=
n he saw Michael take out his=20

beloved picture, and, fastening it before him on the telega, address to it =
his prayers for the=20

success of his young lord=E2=80=99s mission. =E2=80=9CThe saint and the Cza=

=E2=80=9Cand he would address either with equal reverence and equal confide=
nce.=E2=80=9D  His reverie was=20

interrupted by the voice of the isvostchik. =E2=80=9CThis is the square of =
the Admiralty, and there is the=20

great Czar Peter,=E2=80=9D said he, as he pointed out the celebrated equest=
rian statue where the father of=20

modern Russia perpetually climbs the rock and treads the serpent beneath hi=
s horse=E2=80=99s hoofs.=20

They drove to an inn, where Ivan merely delayed to make those changes in hi=
s dress which=20

etiquette imperatively demanded, and then, leaving his companions to await =
his return, took his=20

despatches to the Winter Palace. There he was fortunate enough to find the =
Emperor, who had=20

just returned from Kamenoi-Ostrov.  In less than two hours Ivan came back t=
o the inn. Michael had=20

gone out with the isvostchik, but Adrian was waiting for him, and met him w=
ith an air of some=20

anxiety. =E2=80=9CIs it well?=E2=80=9D he asked briefly.  =E2=80=9CWell?--o=
h yes, _very_ well,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered. He spoke in an=20

abstracted voice, but there was a new light in his eyes, and his face was f=
lushed and excited.  =E2=80=9CI=20

=E2=80=9Cthe half was not told me! He is grand--beautiful! There is only on=
e thing more I want now--_to die=20

for him_.=E2=80=9D  The sorrows of the last two months had done somewhat to=
 deepen the slight nature of=20

Adrian. He was no longer disposed to scoff at everything. =E2=80=9CI guesse=
d =E2=80=98le s=C3=A9duisant,=E2=80=99 as Czernichef=20

calls him, would fascinate you,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CBut, now you _ha=

you better news to bring him than that of the destruction of the Kremlin. E=
vil tidings do not always=20

insure their bearer a good reception.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think he was pre=
pared,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered. =E2=80=9CAt all events he=20

betrayed no emotion; only saying very calmly, =E2=80=98It is the will of Go=
d!=E2=80=99 I think he grew pale, but even=20

of that I cannot speak certainly, as at the beginning of our interview I sc=
arcely dared to raise my=20

eyes to his face. But all changed when he spoke of Moscow, and questioned m=
e about the things I=20

had witnessed there during the Occupation. I could see that much was new to=
 him, and even=20

startling, and that my account of the conflagration moved him deeply. Then =
all fear passed from=20

me, save the fear of giving pain to him. His intense gaze seemed to draw th=
e whole truth from my=20

lips, even in spite of my will; but it was hard to tell of the burnings and=
 plunderings, and of the=20

starved, homeless, despairing people. Once or twice my voice dropped so low=
 that he had to ask=20

me to repeat my words; for you know he is somewhat deaf. But when I told hi=
m of the wounded=20

men whom we found in the cellars and tried to keep alive, his face lighted =
up, and he thanked me--

yes, thanked _me_=E2=80=9D Ivan repeated, raising his head proudly; though =
almost immediately he=20

allowed it to sink again, while a vivid flush passed over his features.  =
=E2=80=9CTell me the rest,=E2=80=9D said Adrian=20

eagerly.  Ivan struggled with some feeling which he would not, perhaps coul=
d not express. =E2=80=9CIt is=20

almost too sacred,=E2=80=9D he said at last. =E2=80=9CBut I will tell you; =
only, never speak to me of it again. Even=20

now I look back upon what I said with amazement. Evidently Count Rostopchin=
e has been=20

generous, and has spoken highly of my services in his letter. His Majesty o=
bserved that heroism=20

and fidelity appear to be hereditary in my family; and asked me whether I w=
as not the=20

representative of the great Prince Pojarsky, the deliverer of Moscow. I ans=
wered, =E2=80=98Sire, I am his=20

descendant; I know not whether I am his representative.=E2=80=99 He inquire=
d my meaning, and thus it=20

came to pass that I talked to him about my father.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAbout=
 your father!=E2=80=9D Adrian repeated in great=20

astonishment. =E2=80=9CYou amaze me! You and I have lived together for six =
years, and never have I=20

heard you so much as name him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo; never to any one arou=
nd me--scarcely even to dear old=20

Petrovitch. Yet to my sovereign, in one hour, the whole secret of my life f=
lashed out, I know not=20

how. I told all;--how ever since I heard the story of my birth in early boy=
hood, I dreamed of that=20

exiled father, dwelling forlorn and solitary in the frozen desert of Siberi=
a; how I longed to seek him=20

out and comfort him, and even dared to cherish the hope that one day I migh=
t win his pardon and=20

restore him to his home. But, even as I spoke thus, a sudden overwhelming s=
ense of the presence=20

in which I stood swept over me. I was confounded, struck dumb, paralyzed wi=
th the sense of my=20

own boldness. At last I stammered, by way of excuse, =E2=80=98I implore of =
your Majesty to pardon me; you=20

can understand how the sad fate of a father must shadow the life of a son!=
=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  Adrian uttered a=20

groan of dismay. =E2=80=9CMost luckless of men!=E2=80=9D he cried. =E2=80=
=9CNever in all your days did you make a blunder=20

until that moment. My friend Ivan, it is clear you are no courtier; you may=
 as well give up the game=20

at once and come back to the camp with me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy so?=E2=80=
=9D asked Ivan, terribly disconcerted. =E2=80=9CWhat=20

have I said amiss? I don=E2=80=99t understand--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou don=
=E2=80=99t understand! Have you forgotten the fate of the=20



Czar Paul, and the unfortunate circumstances under which his majesty began =
his reign?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CUtterly!=E2=80=9D cried the horror-stricken Ivan, growing red and =
pale by turns. =E2=80=9COh, what have I done?--I=20

never dreamed of any sorrow save my own.=E2=80=9D But after a long pause he=
 resumed, with a look of=20

returning composure: =E2=80=9CI think he did not misunderstand me. It is tr=
ue I saw a look of pain pass=20

across his face, and I wondered at it for a moment. But his manner to me gr=
ew even gentler than=20

before. He asked me what my father=E2=80=99s supposed crime had been, and I=
 told him frankly. Then he=20

said, =E2=80=98He shall be sought out and restored to you, if he be not alr=
eady beyond our reach;=E2=80=99 and he=20

added, =E2=80=98Beyond the reach of God he cannot be. Is it not so?=E2=80=
=99 I thought he waited for an answer,=20

and I said, =E2=80=98Yes, sire.=E2=80=99 That was nearly the end. He told m=
e I should receive a communication to-

morrow through the Governor of St. Petersburg, General Soltikoff. Then I ki=
ssed his hand; and the=20

gentleman-in-waiting, who accompanied me to the gate of the palace, asked f=
or my address. Now,=20

Adrian, you know as much as I can tell you. But,=E2=80=9D he added to himse=

tone, the manner, these are mine, mine only. These it is that give me the p=
recious sense that I=20

myself--Ivan Ivanovitch Pojarsky--am recognized, thought of, cared for.=E2=
=80=9D     CHAPTER XIX.  THE=20

CHEVALIER GUARD.    =E2=80=9CI sang the joyful p=C3=A6an clear,   And, sitt=
ing, burnished without fear   The=20

brand, the buckler, and the spear--    =E2=80=9CWaiting to strive a happy s=
trife,   To war with falsehood to=20

the knife,   And not to lose the good of life.=E2=80=9D   The following mor=
ning brought Ivan a request,=20

equivalent of course to a command, that he would wait upon General Soltikof=
f. The Governor of=20

St. Petersburg was a veteran approaching his eightieth year, and much and d=
eservedly respected=20

both by the sovereign and by the people. He received Ivan with remarkable c=
ourtesy. Although the=20

ante-chamber was nearly full of persons awaiting an audience, and some of t=
hem were evidently=20

of high rank, he sent for him almost immediately, and introduced him to his=
 son and to others who=20

were with him in the cabinet as a young nobleman who had acted a most heroi=
c part during the=20

Occupation of Moscow. Then addressing Ivan himself, he said, =E2=80=9CThe E=
mperor has commended=20

you to my particular care. I am authorized to offer you at present a nomina=
tion for the Chevalier=20

Guard.=E2=80=9D  This was a great honour. In this splendid corps every priv=
ate was a noble of the highest=20

birth and a Knight of Malta. Upon state occasions the members formed the mo=
narch=E2=80=99s guard of=20

honour; they had the _entr=C3=A9e_ to the receptions at the palace; they di=
ned at the imperial table.=20

Their uniform, upon which fabulous sums were expended, was a mantle of scar=
let, with a massive=20

silver cuirass bearing a large Maltese cross in relief; and the trappings o=
f their priceless Arabian=20

horses glittered with gold and jewels. Ivan, knowing all this, remained sil=
ent, his face a curious=20

mixture of intense gratification and extreme embarrassment.  The kind old g=
eneral beckoned him=20

nearer and spoke in a lower tone. =E2=80=9CI believe I understand your feel=
ings, my young friend. You are=20

thinking of the expenses the gentlemen of the Chevalier Guard usually take =
pride and pleasure in=20

incurring--of their armour, their horses, and so forth. Upon that ground yo=
u need hesitate no=20

longer. His Imperial Majesty has requested me to attend to all your require=
ments.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHis goodness=20

overpowers me,=E2=80=9D said Ivan with emotion. =E2=80=9CBut, my general, t=

of the Chevalier Guard will soon have the opportunity of acquiring a deeper=
 dye. Already they=20

have received their marching orders, and in a few days they start for the s=

 them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_Wish it!_=E2=80=9D cried=20

Ivan, with kindling eyes. =E2=80=9CWhilst Napoleon--who has spoiled Moscow =
