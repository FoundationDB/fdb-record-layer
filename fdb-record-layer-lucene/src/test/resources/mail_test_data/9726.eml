be kept in suspense; she knew the step of her husband; she saw him enter, l=
ooking paler than she=20

had ever seen him before. Franks seated himself beside his wife, put his ar=
m round her, and drew=20

her tenderly towards him, unwilling to inflict pain, scarcely knowing how t=
o break the news that he=20

was a ruined man. Persis had guessed the truth before Franks said, in a ton=
e which he vainly tried=20

to make cheerful, "Well, sweetheart, you and I will have to set out on our =
travels together."  But=20

when Ned gave his wife a more detailed account of what had occurred; when h=
e told of the absurd=20

questions, the mocking laughter, the insolent taunts which had made his blo=
od boil, even natural=20

anxiety concerning his future prospects was swallowed up for the time in pa=
ssionate indignation. "I=20

longed to strike him," exclaimed the late sailor, "and I had to chain even =
my tongue! Wife--wife--it=20

is no easy matter to endure, or to forgive insults and injuries such as tha=
t man has heaped upon=20

me! To hold me up to the contempt of my own boys,--that was the most intole=
rable wrong of all! I=20

actually heard Sam Barker and Peter Core tittering behind me, the little sn=
eaking--But your fire-

ships are bearing down upon me full sail; I must not trust myself to speak =
on these matters,--I=20

must try not to let my mind brood over them,--would that I could drive the =
whole scene out of my=20

memory forever!"  Persis did not, as most wives would have done, stir up he=
r husband's wrath to a=20

blaze, and heap on it the fuel of her own grief, fears, and regrets. She tr=
ied in her gentle, loving=20

way to make him look parts of Fowls, which are continually in Action, are e=
steem'd the best, for=20

which reason he prefers the Legs of tame Fowls, and what we call the Wings =
in wild Fowl, that is,=20

the fleshy part on the Breast. _Gefner_ and _Aldrovandus_ have both largely=
 treated of the use of=20

the Flesh and Eggs of these Fowls, but I believe some of the following Rece=
ipts for dressing them,=20

will not be unacceptable, they being more adapted to the Taste of our Times=
.  I shall begin with=20

some curious ways of dressing of Eggs, which I had from a Gentleman of _Bru=
ssels_, who had=20

collected them from most parts of _Europe_.    First Way of dressing of Egg=
s.  Boil your Eggs till=20

they are hard, and cut the Whites only into Rings or large pieces; then cut=
 some Parsley and=20

Onions small, and stew them with a little Salt, Pepper, and Nutmeg in half =
a Pint of Water, till the=20

Onion and Parsley is tender; when this is done, put in your Eggs well flowe=
r'd, and as soon as=20

they are hot, put half a Pint of Cream to them, and thicken them for servin=
g at the Table. The=20

Yolks may be fry'd to garnish the Dish.    Second Way of preparing of Eggs.=
  Boil your Eggs hard=20

as before, and cut the Whites likewise as directed in the above Receipt, an=
d then prepare some=20

Gravy, a bunch of sweet Herbs, a little Salt, some Lemon Peel, some _Jamaic=
a_ Pepper beaten=20

small, an Onion shred small, and let these stew together till it is suffici=
ently season'd; after which,=20

strain it off, and put in the Eggs to heat them thoroughly, and then thicke=
n the whole with burnt=20

Butter.    Third Way of preparing of Eggs.  Break some Eggs,=20


_
second causes, to see that the trial--bitter as it was--was sent in wisdom =
and love, and that man=20

could inflict no real injury except by drawing into sin. Persis did not say=
 much, but she looked=20

bright and hopeful, to keep up the spirits of her husband. If they were to =
leave their happy home at=20

Colme, their pleasant occupation in the village, it might be because God ha=
d provided for them=20

something better still, some wider field of usefulness in which they might =
humbly serve him. They=20

were spared to one _Jamaica_ Pepper finely powder'd, then make some Butter =
very hot in a Pan,=20

and pour in the Mixture to fry, till it is hard enough to hold together; th=
en it must be taken out, and=20

cut into several Pieces, and served with the same Sauce directed in the for=
egoing Receipt.=20

Fourth Way of dressing of Eggs.  Take the Hearts of two or three Cabbage-Le=
ttuces, a little Sorrel,=20

Parsley, Cherville, and a large Mushroom, put them in Water over the Fire t=
ill they are tender, then=20

chop them together very small with=20


_
still. "Whilst I have you and our boy," cried Persis, as she rested her hea=
d on her husband's=20

shoulder, "I feel that I could be contented in a hovel, or in a prison."  T=
he news that Ned Franks,=20

the one-armed school-master, had been dismissed by Sir Lacy, spread like wi=
ldfire through=20

Colme. The tidings were received with almost universal regret and indignati=
on, for both Ned and=20

Persis were great favorites in the village. Mrs. Fuddles of the "Chequers,"=
 indeed, observed, as=20

she wiped the dust from a bottle of whiskey, "I Eggs, and season the whole =
with Salt, Pepper, or=20

Nutmeg; and when the Mass is well mixt together, put them in paste, making =
them into small flat=20

Puffs, and fry them. This may be diversify'd, by adding some sweet Herbs ch=
op'd small to the=20

Mixture, before it is put into Paste.    Fifth Way of dressing of Eggs.  Be=
at as many Eggs as you=20

think convenient, and at the same time squeeze the Juice of an Orange among=
 them; being well=20

beaten, season them with a little Salt, then take a Stew-Pan, and if it is =
a Fast-day, put some=20


_
that a sailor that's been spending his life in mopping up decks should know=
 much about=20

hedication." But the publican's wife was almost the only person who did not=
 regret the disgrace of=20

the Frankses. Bat Bell, the miller, declared that to send off an honest fel=
low it and pour in your=20

Eggs, keeping them stirring continually over the Fire till they are enough,=
 then pour them into a=20

Plate upon Sippets. But on Flesh-days, instead of Butter use strong Gravy, =
or on Fish-days some=20

Mushroom-Gravy may be used instead of Butter, or=20
