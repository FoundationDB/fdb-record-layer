dracaena marginata the reviewing tribunal a power now existing in the trial=
 Court; that such an extension of power, provided it does not trespass upon=
 the inherent powers of any other Court, is not unconstitutional. Having de=

hundred years. The Courts wherein he sat, and the present older members of =
the Bar will see to it=20

that his merits are officially pronounced; we can only say now that no eulo=
gy to be given to his=20

memory will do him over-justice. His dignity, fairness and sound legal judg=
ment on the Bench were=20

such that he deserved even greater honors than he received and his private =
life was immaculate.=20

An excellent portrait of the Justice as he appeared in 1905 will be found i=
n the Law Journal of that=20

year (Vol. 28, facing p. 6).                     *       *       *       * =
      *  The following seems almost an=20

impossible propaganda to come even from Germany at this time, but especiall=
y from one of the=20

sources named. The "Pathfinders League," of Stuttgart, we assume to be a So=
cial (practically=20

Soviet) organization, but the "Christian Young People's Societies," must be=
 at least a quasi-

religious body. A circular sent out and published by these organizations on=
 July 22 last says:  "War=20

is the most exalted and holiest expression of human activity. Some day the =
hour of battle will strike=20

for us, too, when we, as officers, go forth against the enemy. The people, =
which is a minor=20

politically, will then fall into line of itself. In the days of secret, hap=
py expectation there then goes=20

from heart to heart the cry: 'With God for King and Fatherland!' Still and =
deep in German hearts=20

there must live the joy of battle and a longing for it. So, let's laugh to =
scorn those old women in=20

men's breeches who fear war and wail that it is horrible and criminal. No a=
nd again, No! War is=20

beautiful, and it is glorious to die for the Fatherland and the hereditary =
ruling house. Our great ally=20

above will lead us splendidly."  In New York City there is a municipal ordi=
nance requiring=20

landlords, who are to give tenants under a lease hot water, to furnish it o=
r be arrested, fined and, if=20

thought wise by the magistrate, imprisoned. Recently a landlord in the Bron=
x was found guilty of=20

failure to supply hot water, and it appeared that the landlord and tenant h=
ad somehow become on=20

unfriendly terms; that there was a special valve in the house which permitt=
ed hot water to go to=20

one apartment and to be shut off from another; and that the landlord closed=
 down the valve to shut=20

off the hot water of the complaining tenant. Thirty days in prison and a fi=
ne of $250 was the=20

penalty imposed by the Justices in Special Sessions.                     * =
      *       *       *       *  Among=20

the important decisions in the Court of Errors and Appeals in this State on=
 Nov. 14th last was one=20

unanimously confirming the conviction of the negro, George Washington Knigh=
t, for the murder of=20

Mrs. Edith Marshall Wilson, the church organist at Perth Amboy, in March la=
st, which murder the=20

prisoner had confessed. (See N. J. L. J., April, 1921, p. 102). Although th=
e Court was unanimous=20

in upholding the conviction of Knight, three of the Judges, Chancellor Wate=
r with some Salt,=20

Pepper, some Lemon-Peel, some Cloves whole, a bunch of sweet Herbs, and cov=
ering the Pan=20

close, let them stew three or four Hours. Then pass the Liquor through a Si=
eve, and pour it over=20

your Ducks; and serve them hot with garnish of Lemon sliced and Raspings of=
 Bread sifted. This=20

Method serves likewise for Easterlings, Widgeons, Teal and such like.    To=
 Stew a salted Brisket=20

of _Beef._ From Mr. _La Fontaine._  To a Pound of common Salt, put one Ounc=
e of Salt-Petre,=20

and rub your Beef well with it, and let it lie a Week; then lard the Skin o=
f it with Bacon-Fat, and lay=20

it in a Stew-pan that will shut close. Cut a Lemon in half with its Rind, a=
nd lay a-part on each side=20

the Beef; then put in a bunch of sweet Herbs, some whole Cloves, half a Nut=
meg sliced, some=20

Pepper, an Onion, or three or four Shallots, half a Pound of Butter, a Pint=
 of Claret, and a Quart of=20

Water; shut your Pan close, and let it stew gently five or six Hours till i=
t is very tender.  Then=20

having some boil'd Turnip cut in dice, flour them and fry them brown; then =
pour off the Liquor the=20

Beef was stew'd in, and having passed it through a Sieve, thicken it with b=
urnt Butter, and mix=20



your fry'd Turnips with it, and pour all together over your Beef; garnish w=
ith Lemon sliced, and=20

Raspings of Bread sifted, and serve it hot, it is an excellent Dish.    Nec=
k of _Mutton_ ragou'd.=20

From the same.  Take a Neck of Mutton clean from Bones, and strip it from t=
he Skin; salt it a little,=20

and let it lie till the next day. In the mean while, bake the Bones with a =
slice or two of fat Bacon, a=20

Faggot of sweet Herbs, some Spice, a little Salt and some Lemon-Peel, with =
half a Pint of Water,=20

and half a Pint of Claret, to cover them; then lay your Mutton in a Pan, an=
d when your baked=20

Gravey is passed through a Sieve, pour it into the Pan to the Mutton; but f=
irst lard the fat Part of=20

the Mutton with Lemon-Peel, and the leaner Part with Fat of Bacon; then str=
ew some grated Bread=20

and Spice over the Mutton, which will not be cover'd with the baked Gravey;=
 and when you have=20

closed your Pan, stew it gently four Hours. Then lay it in the Dish, and wh=
en you have thickned the=20

Sauce with burnt Butter, put a Pint of Mushroom Buttons, either fresh and p=
arboil'd, or pickled, into=20

it, and toss them up till they are hot; then pour them all over your Meat, =
and serve it hot, garnish'd=20

with Lemon sliced, red Beet-Roots pickled and sliced, Capers, and Horse-Rad=
ish scrap'd.=20

Stew'd _Beef_ in _Soup._ From the same.  Take four Pounds of Beef, indiffer=
ently lean, and cut it=20

in eight or ten Pieces. Put these into a Pan that may be close cover'd, and=
 then about three Quarts=20

of Water, and a Pint of White Wine, some Pepper and Salt, some Powder of dr=
y'd sweet=20

Marjoram, a few Cloves powder'd, half a dozen small Turnips cut in Dice, a =
Carrot or two cut in the=20

same manner, the white Part of a large Leek shred small, some Leaves of whi=
te Beet,=20


_
Judge Black, differed with the view of the majority as to the constitutiona=
lity of the Mackay Act of=20

1921 (Laws, Ch. 349), empowering the Court of Errors and Appeals to review =
the sufficiency of the=20

evidence in criminal cases, where the defendant elects to take up the entir=
e record. Mr. Justice=20

Kalisch wrote a minority opinion, concurring in the affirming of the convic=
tion but differing with the=20

majority as to the constitutional question involved. Chief Justice Gummere,=
 in the main opinion,=20

said that the statute of 1921 was not novel, but is similar to an Act passe=
d more than twenty years=20

ago, but subsequently repealed, under which Sallery shred, and a Piece of B=
read-Crust burnt;=20

cover close, and stew this for six Hours, and serve it hot. You may garnish=
 with Lemon sliced.    To=20

dress the _Liver_ and _Crow_ of an _Hog._ From Mrs. _Johnson_ in _Devereux-=
Court._=20

However this Dish may seem dispiseable, yet if it is well dresed, few of th=
e savoury Dishes exceed=20

it. The Liver and Crow of an Hog, with the Sweet-Breads, should be used pre=
sently after the Hog=20

is kill'd, and the Liver cut in Lumps, twice as big as a Walnut, and not in=
 thin Pieces as most do; for=20

then they will become hard in the Dressing. The Crow must likewise be cut i=
n Slips about the=20

breadth of two=20


_
first degree. The first ground of attack was that the Mackay Act violates t=
he provisions of the=20

Constitution relative to trial by jury, which provides that the guilt or in=
nocence of a defendant shall=20

be determined by an impartial jury. The Court said, however, that the quest=
ion of the verdict being=20

in accordance with the weight of the evidence cannot be raised by the State=
, but only by the=20

defendant. Therefore, the Court held, the constitutional protection afforde=
d by a jury trial is not=20

lessened by the law under which the accused may elect to have the evidence =
reviewed. The Court=20

also held that the right given the Court of Errors to order a new trial whe=
re the evidence seemed=20

Sweet-Breads; then parboil the Pieces of Liver, and make a thick Batter of =
Flour, Water and Eggs,=20

mixing a little Salt with it, and prepare some red Sage shred very fine; so=
me grated Bread, and=20

some Pepper beaten: mix these together, and when you have some Butter, or L=
ard, very hot in=20

your Frying-Pan, dip the Crow and Sweet-Bread in the Batter, and immediatel=
y dip your Pieces in=20

the Mixture of Bread, Sage, _&c._ and throw them into the Pan. When these a=
re enough, lay them=20

to drain before the Fire, and then dip the Bits of Liver into the Batter; a=
nd after that, into the=20

crumb'd Bread, and give them a turn or two in the Pan, over a quick Fire: t=
hen drain them like the=20

others, and serve them=20
