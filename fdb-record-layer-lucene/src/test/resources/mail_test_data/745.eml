_Charudatta._ You have said it.  _Sansthanaka._ Lishten, my mashters, lishten! He murdered her! 

No one but him! Doubt is over. Let punishment be inflicted on the body of thish poor Charudatta. 

P. 253.1]  _Judge._ Beadle, we must do as the king's brother-in-law says. Guardsmen, lay hold on 

this Charudatta. [_The guardsmen do so._]  _Mother._ Be merciful, good gentlemen, be merciful! 

[_She repeats what she had said before, beginning_ "When the golden casket:" _page 143._] If 

my daughter is killed, she is killed. Let him live for me--bless him! And besides, a lawsuit is a 

matter between plaintiff and defendant. I am the real plaintiff. So let him go free!  _Sansthanaka._ 

You shlave, get out of the way! What have you got to shay about him?  _Judge._ Go, madam. 

Guardsmen, conduct her forth.  _Mother._ Oh, my child, my son!                    [_Exit weeping._ 

_Sansthanaka._ [_Aside._] I 've done shomething worthy of myshelf. Now I 'll go. 

[_Exit._  _Judge._ Noble Charudatta, the decision lies with us, but the rest depends on the king. 

And yet, beadle, let King Palaka be reminded of this:      The Brahman who has sinned, our laws 

declare,       May not be slain, but banished from the realm,     And with his wealth entire abroad 

may fare.                  39  _Beadle._ Yes, Your Honor. [_He goes out, then reenters in tears._] Oh, 

sirs, I was with the king. And King Palaka says: "Inasmuch as he killed Vasantasena for such a 

trifle, these same jewels shall be hung about his neck, the drum shall be beaten, he shall be 

conducted to the southern burying-ground, and there impaled." And whoever else shall commit 

such a crime, shall be punished with the like dreadful doom.  _Charudatta._ Oh, how wanton is 

this act of King Palaka! Nevertheless,      Although his counsellors may plunge a king       Into 

injustice' dangers great,     Yet he will reap the woe and suffering;       And 't is a righteous fate. 

40  [155.10. S.  And more than this:      They who pervert the king's true bent,       The white crow's 

part who play,     Have slain their thousands innocent,       And slay, and slay, and slay. 

41  My friend Maitreya, go, greet the mother of my son in my name for the last time. And keep my 

son Rohasena free from harm.  _Maitreya._ When the root is cut away, how can the tree be 

saved?  _Charudatta._ No, not so.      When man departs to worlds above,       In living son yet 

liveth he;     Bestow on Rohasena love       No less than that thou gavest me.                          42 

_Maitreya._ Oh, my friend! I will prove myself your friend by continuing the life that you leave 

unfinished.  _Charudatta._ And let me see Rohasena for a single moment.  _Maitreya._ I will. It is 

but fitting.  _Judge._ My good beadle, remove this man. [_The beadle does so._] Who is there? 

Let the headsmen receive their orders. [_The guardsmen loose their hold on Charudatta, and all of 

them go out._]  _Beadle._ Come with me, sir.  _Charudatta._ [_Mournfully repeats the verse, page 

146, beginning_ "My friend Maitreya!" _Then, as if speaking to one not present._]      If you had 

proved my conduct by the fire,       By water, poison, scales, and thus had known       That I 

deserved that saws should bite my bone,     My Brahman's frame, more could I not desire.       You 

trust a foeman, slay me thus? 'T is well.       With sons, and sons' sons, now you plunge to hell! 

43  I come! I come!                                    [_Exeunt omnes._  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote 83: 

Elephants were employed as executioners; and, according to Lalladiksita, the horses served the 

same purpose.]  [Footnote 84: This refers to the fallen jewels.]     ACT THE TENTH  THE END 

[_Enter Charudatta, accompanied by two headsmen._]  _Headsmen._      Then think no longer of 

the pain;     In just a second you 'll be slain.     We understand the fashions new     To fetter you 

and kill you too.     In chopping heads we never fail,     Nor when the victim we impale. 

1  Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! This is the noble Charudatta.      The oleander on his 



brow,     In headsmen's hands you see him now;     Like a lamp whose oil runs nearly dry,     His 

light fades gently, ere it die.                          2  _Charudatta._ [_Gloomily._]      My body wet by 

tear-drops falling, falling;       My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;     Flowers from the graveyard 

torn, my wreath appalling;     For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,       And for the fragrant 

incense of my blood.                  3  _Headsmen._ Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! 

Why gaze upon the good man so?     The ax of death soon lays him low.     Yet good men once 

sought shelter free,     Like birds, upon this kindly tree.                           4  Come, Charudatta, 

come!  _Charudatta._ Incalculable are the ways of human destiny, that I am come to such a plight! 

Red marks of hands in sandal paste     O'er all my body have been placed;     The man, with meal 

and powder strewn,     Is now to beast of offering grown.                           5  [157.19. S.  [_He 

gazes intently before him._] Alas for human differences! [_Mournfully._]      For when they see the 

fate that I must brave,       With tears for death's poor victim freely given,     The citizens cry 

"shame," yet cannot save,--       Can only pray that I attain to heaven.                     6 

_Headsmen._ Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! Why do you gaze upon him?      God 

Indra moving through the sky,[85]       The calving cow, the falling star,     The good man when that 

of Racine. But Racine was in the highest degree sensitive, and such a desperate plot against his 

fame might well make him pause and reflect.  _Phedre_, like _Iphigenie_, is a new creation from 

Euripides. Its singular beauty has been accurately defined as a mingling of horror and 

compassion, of terror and curiosity. It is less a drama than one great part, and that part consists of 

a diseased state of the soul, a morbid conflict of emotions, so that the play becomes overmuch a 

study in the pathology of passion. The greatness of the role of the heroine constitutes the infirmity 

of the play as a whole; the other characters seem to exist only for the sake of deploying the inward 

struggle of which Phedre is the victim. Love and jealousy rage within her; remorse follows, for 

something of Christian sentiment is conveyed by Racine into his classical fable. Never had his 

power as a psychologist in art been so wonderfully exhibited; yet he had elsewhere attained more 

completely the ideal of the drama. In the succession of his profane masterpieces we may say of 

the last that it is lesser than the first and greater. _Phedre_ lacks the balance and proportion of 

_Andromaque_; but never had Racine exhibited the tempest and ravage of passion in a woman's 

soul on so great a scale or with force so terrible.  The cabal might make him pause; his own play, 

profoundly moralised as it was, might cause him to consider. Events of the day, crimes of passion, 

adulteries, poisonings, nameless horrors, might agitate his spirit. Had he not fed the full-blown 

passions of the time? What if Nicole's word that playwrights were public poisoners should be true? 

Probably various causes operated on the mobile spirit of Racine; certainly the Christian, of 

Jansenist education, who had slumbered within him, now awakened. He resolved to quit the world 

and adopt the Carthusian habit. The advice of his confessor was that he should regulate his life by 

marriage. Racine yielded, and found his contentment in a wife who was ignorant of his plays, and 

in children whose inclinations and training were religious. The penitent was happy in his 

household, happy also in his reconciliation with Nicole and Arnauld. To Boileau he remained 

attached. And he did not renounce the court. Was not the King the anointed vicegerent of God, 

who could not be too much honoured? He accepted, with Boileau as fellow-labourer, the position 

of the King's historiographer, and endeavoured to fulfil its duties.  Twelve years after his 

withdrawal from the theatre, Racine, at the request of Madame de Maintenon, composed his 



Biblical tragedy of _Esther_ (1688-89) for her cherished schoolgirls at Saint-Cyr. The subject was 

not unaptly chosen--a prudent and devout Esther now helped to guide the fortunes of France, and 

she was surrounded at Saint-Cyr by her chorus of young daughters of Sion. _Esther_ was 

rendered by the pupils, with graceful splendours, before the King, and the delight was great. The 

confidante of the Persian Queen indeed forgot her words; at Racine's hasty complaint the young 

actress wept, and the poet, weeping with her, wiped away her tears.  _Esther_ is a melodious 

play, exquisite in its refined style and delicate versification; but the characters are faintly drawn. Its 

novelty lay in its lyrical movements and in the poetical uses of its finely-imagined spectacle. 

Madame de Maintenon or her directors feared that the excitement and ambitions of another play in 

costume might derange the spirits of her girls, and when _Athalie_ was recited at Versailles, in 

January 1691, it was little of an event; the play passed almost unnoticed. A noisy reception, 

indeed, would have been no fitting tribute to its solemn beauty. All Racine's religious feeling, all his 

domestic tenderness are united in _Athalie_ with his matured feeling for Greek art. The great 

protagonist is the Divine Being; Providence replaces the fate of the ancient drama. A child (for 

Racine was still an innovator in the French theatre) was the centre of the action; the interests were 

political, or rather national, in the highest sense; the events were, as formerly, the developments of 

inward character; but events and characters were under the presiding care of God. The tragedy is 

lyrical, not merely through the chorus, which expresses common emotions of devout joy and fear, 

indignation, praise, and rapture. The chorus is less developed here, and its chants are less 

impressive than in _Esther_. There is, however, a lyrism, personal and modern, in the prophetic 

inspiration of the High Priest, and Racine anticipated that his boldness in presenting this might be 

censured by his contemporaries. The unity of place, which had been disregarded in _Esther_, is 

here preserved; the scene is the temple at Jerusalem; and by its impressive grandeur, and the 

awful associations of the place, the spectacle may be said to take part in the action of the play. 

Perhaps it would be no exaggeration to assert that grandeur and beauty are nowhere else so 

united in French dramatic art as in _Athalie_; perhaps it might truly be described as flawless in 

majesty and grace.  A light disfavour of the King saddened, and perhaps hastened, the close of 

Racine's life. Port-Royal was regarded as a centre of rebellious heresy; and Racine's piety to his 

early masters was humble and devout. He had further offended by drawing up a memorandum on 

the sufferings of the French people resulting from the wars. Madame de Maintenon assured him 

that the cloud would pass; but the favour of death, accepted with tranquillity, came before the 

returning favour of the poet's master. He died in April 1699, soon after he had entered his sixtieth 

year.  The

These four behold not from afar.                           7  _Goha._ Look, Ahinta! Look, man!      While 

he, of citizens the best,     Goes to his death at fate's behest,     Does heaven thus weep that he 

must die?     Does lightning paint the cloudless sky?                      8  _Ahinta._ Goha, man,      The 

heaven weeps not that he must die,     Nor lightning paints the cloudless sky;     Yet streams are 

falling constantly     From many a woman's clouded eye.                             9  And again:      While 

this poor victim to his death is led,       No man nor woman here but sorely weeps;     And so the 

dust, by countless tear-drops fed,       Thus peacefully upon the highway sleeps.                   10 

_Charudatta._ [_Gazes intently. Mournfully._]      These women, in their palaces who stay, 

From half-shut windows peering, thus lament,     "Alas for Charudatta! Woe the day!"       And pity-

streaming eyes on me are bent.                    11  P. 258.12]  _Headsmen._ Come, Charudatta, 

come! Here is the place of proclamation. Beat the drum and nature--truth, that is, in its 

interpretation and rendering of human passion. Historical accuracy and local colour concerned him 

as far as they were needful with his courtly spectators for verisimilitude. The fluctuations of 

passion he studies to most advantage in his characters of women. Love, in all its varieties, from 

the passion of Roxane or Phedre to the pure devotion of Berenice, Iphigenie, or Monime; maternal 

tenderness or the tenderness of the foster-mother (Andromaque, Clytemnestre, Josabeth); female 

ambition (Agrippine, Athalie)--these are the themes of his exposition. His style has been justly 

characterised as a continual creation; its audacity underlies its suavity; its miracles are 

accomplished with the simplest means. His vocabulary is singularly small, yet with such a 

vocabulary he can attain the rarest effects. From sustained dignity he can pass suddenly, when 

the need arises, to the most direct familiarity. The music of his verse is seldom rich or sonorous; it 

is at once a pure vehicle for the idea and a delicate caress to the senses.     CHAPTER 


_
Listen, good people, listen! This is the noble Charudatta, son of Sagaradatta, and grandson of the 

merchant Vinayadatta. This malefactor enticed the courtezan Vasantasena into the deserted old 

garden Pushpakaranda, and for a mere trifle murdered her by strangling. He was taken with the 

booty, and confessed his guilt. Therefore are we under orders from King Palaka to execute him. 

And if any other commit such a crime, accursed in this world and the next, him too King Palaka 

condemns to the like punishment.  _Charudatta._ [_Despondently. Aside._]      By hundred 

sacrifices purified,         My radiant name     Was once proclaimed by countless altars' side, 

And knew no blame.     Now comes my hour of death, and evil men         Of baser fame     In 

public spots proclaim it once again,         But linked with shame.                                   12  [_He 

looks up and stops his ears._]      Vasantasena! Oh, my beloved!     From thy dear lips, that vied 

with coral's red,       Betraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,     My soul with heaven's 

nectar once was fed.     How can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,       To drink shame's 

poisoned cup BOSSUET AND THE PREACHERS--FENELON   I  "A man set under authority"--

these words, better than any other, define Bossuet. Above him was God, represented in things 

spiritual by the Catholic Church, in things temporal by the French monarchy; below him were the 

faithful confided to his charge, and those who would lead the faithful astray from the path of 

obedience and tradition. Duty to what was above him, duty to those placed under him, made up 

the whole of Bossuet's life. To maintain, to defend, to extend the tradition he had received, was 

the first of duties. All his powers as an orator, a controversialist, an educator were directed to this 

object. He wrote and spoke to dominate the intellects of men and to subdue their wills, not for the 

sake of personal power, but for the truth as he had received it from the Church and from the 

monarchy.  JACQUES-BENIGNE BOSSUET was born in 1627, at Dijon, of a middle-class family, 

distinguished in the magistracy. In his education, pursued with resolute ardour, the two traditions 

of Hellenism and Hebraism were fused together: Homer and Virgil were much to him; but the 

Bible, above all, nourished his imagination, his conscience, 


_
_Headsmen._ Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!      This treasure-house, with pearls of 

virtue stored,       This bridge for good men o'er misfortune's river,     This gem now robbed of all its 

golden hoard,       Departs our town to-day, departs forever.                  14  [159.15. S.  And again: 

Whom fortune favors, find     That all the world is kind;     Whose happy days are ended,     Are 

rarely thus befriended.                                  15  _Charudatta._ [_Looks about him._]      Their faces 

with their garments' hem now hiding,       They stand afar, whom once I counted friends:     Even 

foes have smiles for men with Fortune biding:       But friends prove faithless when good fortune 

ends.        16  _Headsmen._ They are out of the way. The street is cleared. Lead on the 

condemned criminal.  _Charudatta._ [_Sighing._]      My friend Maitreya! Oh, this cruel blow! 

My wife, thou issue of a spotless strain!     My Rohasena! Here am I, laid low     By sternest fate; 

and thou, thou dost not know       That all thy childish games are played in vain.       Thou playest, 

heedless of another's pain!                  (ix. 29)         *       *       *       *       *  _Voices behind the 

scenes._ My father! Oh, my friend!  _Charudatta._ [_Listens. Mournfully._] You are a leader in 

your own caste. I would beg a favor at your hands.  _Headsmen._ From _our_ hands you would 

receive a favor?  _Charudatta._ Heaven forbid! Yet a headsman is neither so wanton nor so cruel 

as King Palaka. That I may be happy in the other world, I ask to see the face of my son. 

_Headsmen._ So be it.  _A voice behind the scenes._ My father! oh, my father! [_Charudatta 

hears the words, and mournfully repeats his request._]  _Headsmen._ Citizens, make way a 

moment. Let the noble Charudatta look upon the face of his son. [_Turning to the back of the 

stage._] This way, sir! Come on, little boy!  P. 261.15]  [_Enter Maitreya, with Rohasena._] 

_Maitreya._ Make haste, my boy, make haste! Your father is being led to his death.  _Rohasena._ 

My father! oh, my father!  _Maitreya._ Oh, my friend! Where must I behold you now? 

_Charudatta._ [_Perceives his son and his friend._] Alas, my son! Alas, Maitreya! [_Mournfully._] 

Ah, woe is me!      Long, too long, shall I thirst in vain       Through all my sojourn dread;     This 

vessel[86] small will not contain       The water for the dead.                                    17  What may I 

give my son? [_He looks at himself, and perceives the sacrificial cord._] Ah, this at least is mine. 

The precious cord that Brahmans hold     Is unadorned with pearls and gold;       Yet, girt 

therewith, they sacrifice     To gods above and fathers[87] old.                           18  [_He gives 

Rohasena the cord._]  _Goha._ Come, Charudatta! Come, man!  _Ahinta._ Man, do you name the 

noble Charudatta's name, and forget the title? Remember:      In happy hours, in death, by night, 

by day,       Roving as free as a yet unbroken colt,     Fate wanders on her unrestricted way. 

19  And again:      Life will depart his body soon;       Shall our reproaches bow his head? 

Although eclipse may seize the moon,       We worship while it seems but dead.                        20 

_Rohasena._ Oh, headsmen, where are you leading my father?  [161.10. S.  _Charudatta._ My 

darling,      About my neck I needs must wear       The oleander-wreath;     Upon my shoulder I 

must bear     The stake, and in my heart the care       Of near-approaching death.     I go to-day to 

meet a dastard's ending,     A victim, at the fatal altar bending.                        21  _Goha._ My boy, 

Not we the headsmen are,       Though born of headsman race;     Thy father's life who mar, 

These, these The celebrity of his scholarship and the flatteries of Parisian _salons_ did not divert 

him from his course. At twenty-five he was a priest and a doctor of the Sorbonne. Six years were 

spent at Metz, a city afflicted by the presence of Protestants and Jews, where Bossuet fortified 

himself with theological studies, preached, panegyrised the saints, and confuted heretics. His 



fame drew him to Paris, where, during ten years, his sermons were among the great events of the 

time. In 1669 he was named Bishop of Condom, but, being appointed preceptor to the Dauphin, 

he resigned his bishopric, and devoted himself to forming the mind of a pupil, indolent and dull, 

who might one day be the vicegerent of God for his country. Bishop of Meaux in 1681, he opened 

the assembly of French clergy next year with his memorable sermon on the unity of the Church, 

and by his authority carried, in a form decisive for freedom while respectful towards Rome, the four 

articles which formulated the liberties of the Gallican Church. The duties of his diocese, 

controversy against Protestantism, the controversy against Quietism, in which Fenelon was his 

antagonist, devotional writings, strictures upon the stage, controversy against the enlightened 

Biblical criticism of Richard Simon, filled his energetic elder years. He ceased from a life of 

glorious labour and resolute combat in April 1704.  The works of Bossuet, setting aside his 

commentaries on Holy Scripture, devotional treatises, and letters, fall into three chief groups: the 

eloquence of the pulpit, controversial writings, and writings designed for the instruction of the 

Dauphin.  Political eloquence could not exist where power was grasped by the hands of one great 

ruler. Judicial eloquence lacked the breadth and elevation which come with political freedom; it 

contented itself with subtleties of argument, decked with artificial flowers of style. The pulpit was 

the school of oratory. St. Vincent de Paul had preached with unction and a grave simplicity, and 

Bossuet, his disciple, felt his influence. But the offering which Bossuet laid upon the altar must 

needs be costly, an offering of all his powers. While an unalterable good sense regulates all he 

wrote, the sweep of his intellect demanded plenitude of expression; his imagination, if it dealt with 

life and death, must needs deal with them at times in the way of magnificence, which was natural 

to it; and his lyrical enthusiasm, fed by the prophetic poetry of the Old Testament, could not but 

find an escape in words. He sought no literary fame; his sermons were acts of faith, acts of duty. 

Out of the vast mass of his discourses he printed one, a sermon of public importance--that on the 

unity of the Church.  At the request of friends, some of the Funeral Orations were published. 

These, with his address on the profession of Louise de La Valliere, were all that could be read of 

Bossuet's pulpit oratory by his contemporaries. His sermons were carefully meditated and 

prepared, but he would not check his power of lofty improvisation by following the words of a 

manuscript. After his death his papers had perilous adventures. By the devotion of his first editor, 

Deforis, nearly two hundred sermons were after many years recovered; later students have 

presented them with as close an approximation as is possible to their original form. Bossuet's first 

manner--that of the years at Metz--is sometimes marred by scholastic subtleties, a pomp of 

quotations, too curious imagery, and a temper rather aggressive than conciliating. During the 

period when he preached in Paris he was master of all his powers, which move with freedom and 

at the same time with a majestic order; his grandeur grows out of simplicity. As Bishop of Meaux 

he exhorted his flock out of the abundance of

_Rohasena._ Then why do you murder my father?  _Goha._ Bless you, 't is the king's orders must

you live long for saying that!  _Charudatta._ [_Tearfully embracing his son._]      This treasure--

love--this taste of heaven,     To the intermediary of written preparation.  He is primarily a doctor of 

the faith: dogma first, determined by authority, and commending itself to human reason; morality, 

not independent, but proceeding from or connected with dogma, and while truly human yet resting 

upon divine foundations. But neither dogma nor morals are

The stake, and in my heart the care       Of living powers by the preacher's awe, adoration, joy, 

charity, indignation, pity; in the large ordonnance of his discourse each passion finds its natural 

place. His eloquence grows out of his theme; his logic is the logic of clear and natural ideas; he is 

lucid,

[_He looks about. Aside._]      Their faces with their garments' hem now hiding,       They stand 

afar, whom once I counted friends:     Even energetic; then suddenly some aspect of his subject
