 We have just come in. My new emplacement is splendid; we've made it shell-=
proof and have it ready for firing. I was coming home this afternoon after =
having been to the fire trenches when I heard a shout: "Keene!" I looked no=
 stronger proof thereof than an occasional slight shrinking under the hand,=
 and an animal smell, which are common to some marine plants.  Whatever be =
the truth on the subject, these doubtful opinions prove that they are of th=
e many connecting links between animals and plants. This is not a proper pl=
ace to decide this controversy; I mean merely to make known new species of =
this tribe _
landed in rear of Trench F 26 and failed to explode."  Sometimes names of s=
hells go through=20

several changes. For example, high explosives in the early part of the war =
were called "black=20

Marias," that being the slang name for the English police patrol wagon. The=
n they were called=20

"Jack Johnsons," then "coal boxes," and finally they were christened "crump=
s" on account of the=20

sound they make, a sort of _cru-ump!_ noise as they explode. "Rum jar" is t=
he trench mortar.=20

"Sausage" is the slow-going aerial torpedo, a beastly thing about six feet =
long with fins like a=20

torpedo. It has two hundred and ten pounds of high explosive and makes a te=
rrible hole. "Whiz=20

bang" is shrapnel.  Shelling is continuous. We have thousands of pieces of =
shells and fuse caps=20

about the premises. I have in front of me a fragment of a shell about fourt=
een incrusted with a=20

coating of _clear, white saltpetre_, that came off in flakes, from a quarte=
r of an inch to an inch or=20

more in thickness. The fracture resembled that of refined sugar, it burnt c=
ompletely away without=20

leaving any residuum; and if dissolved in water, and thus evaporated, cryst=
als of _pure prismatic=20

nitre_ were obtained. This salt, in the _same_ state, is to be met with _un=
der_ the sandstone=20

strata of _many_ of the mountains of Africa; but, perhaps, not in sufficien=
t quantities to be=20

employed as an article of export. There was also in the same cave, running =
down the sides of the=20

rock, a black substance, that was apparently bituminous. The peasants calle=
d it the urine of the=20

das. The dung of this gregarious animal was lying upon the roof of the cave=
rn to the amount of=20

many wagon loads. The putrid animal matter,=20


_
from a German gun. The edges are so sharp that it cuts your hand to hold it=
. I use it as a paper-

weight.                    -------------------------------------  This morn=
ing I experienced a wonderful surprise.=20

I had gone up to one of the North Stafford Batteries to borrow a clinometer=
. The major, while he=20

was getting the instrument for me, casually remarked: "There's yesterday's =
'Times' on the bench if=20

you care to look at it." I turned first to the casualty list and later to t=
he "London Gazette" for the=20

promotions, and wholly by accident perused carefully the Motor Machine Gun =
Service list and=20

there noted the announcement, "Keene, Louis, 2d Lieut., to be 1st Lieut.," =
and for a fact this was=20

the "official" intimation that I had been promoted. I had a couple of spare=
 "pips", rank stars, in my=20

pocket-book, so I got my corporal to sew them on right away.               =
     ---------------------------------

----  We are all very happy at times, very dirty, and covered with stings a=
nd bites; have no idea=20

how long we are to remain up. Getting used to the shell fire, and can sleep=
 through it if it's not too=20

close. When it comes near it makes you very thoughtful. Still working at ni=
ght and resting during=20

the day. Made another emplacement for through the rock, contributed, no dou=
bt, to the formation=20

of the nitre. The Hepatic wells and the native nitre rocks were in the divi=
sion of Agster Sneuwberg,=20

which joins the Tacka to the southwest."  Should I ever visit Kentucky agai=
n, I hope that I shall be=20

able to give a better account of these caverns, which certainly are highly =
deserving of the attention=20

of naturalists.  In Philadelphia you may have an opportunity of seeing some=
 small specimens of=20

the sandrock, containing nitre, now in the cabinet of the Philosophical Soc=
iety.     BOTANY.=20

ART. XI. _Descriptions of species of Sponges observed on the shores of Long=
-Island. By_ C. S.=20

RAFINESQUE, _Esq._   The sponges are one of the most singular productions o=
f nature; and,=20

even to this time, naturalists are divided in opinion respecting their real=
 rank in the scale of=20

organized beings. Some believe that they are animals, belonging to the clas=
s of polyps, next to the=20

genus of _alcyonium_, while many contend that they are not animals, but pla=
nts, of the tribe of=20

_fuci_, or marine vegetables. I am inclined to adopt this latter opinion, s=
ince in all those which I=20

have seen, in Europe and America, no perceptible motion nor sensibility was=
 to be discerned in=20

any stage of their=20
