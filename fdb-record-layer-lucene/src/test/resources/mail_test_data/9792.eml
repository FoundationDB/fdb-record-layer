?" It has been thought=20

that here we have an irreconcilable contradiction with previous narratives,=
 according to which=20

there was close intimacy between him and the king, who "loved him greatly,"=
 and gave him an=20

office of trust about his person. Suppositions of "dislocation of the narra=
tive," the careless adoption=20

by the compiler of two separate legends, and the like, have been freely ind=
ulged in. But it may at=20

least be suggested as a possible explanation of the seeming discrepancy, th=
at when Saul had=20

passed out of his moody madness it is not wonderful that he should have for=
gotten all which had=20

occurred in his paroxysm. It is surely a common enough psychological phenom=
enon that a man=20

restored to sanity has no remembrance of the events during his mental aberr=
ation. And as for=20

Abner's profession of ignorance, an incipient jealousy of this stripling he=
ro may naturally have=20

made the "captain of the host" willing to keep the king as ignorant as he c=
ould concerning a=20

probable formidable rival. There is no need to suppose he was really ignora=
nt, but only that it=20

suited him to say that he was.  With this earliest deed of heroism the peac=
eful private days are=20

closed, and a new epoch of court favour and growing popularity begins. The =
impression which the=20

whole story leaves upon one is well summed up in a psalm which the Septuagi=
nt adds to the=20

Psalter. It is not found in the Hebrew, and has no pretension to be David's=
 work; but, as a=20

_resume_ way, have you the least notion who the Bodwinkles are?"  "Not I," =
replied Larkington. "I=20

did not come here to make their acquaintance, nor I hope did you."  I think=
 Mrs Bodwinkle heard=20

the speech--for it is customary in good society to make remarks about one's=
 neighbours in rather a=20

loud tone--as she coloured a little when she was pointed out to Larkington =
by the fat butler as the=20

person to whom he was expected to bow. Poor woman! she probably thought he =
would be=20

embarrassed when he found out his proximity; but Larkington is above any su=
ch weakness, and=20

sauntered on after Lady Veriphast, with whom he has _affiched_ himself for =
the last few weeks, to=20

the great comfort of Veriphast, who has long been desirous of making his wi=

which has attached to his name for some time past.  "And it is for this, my=
 dear Mrs Bodwinkle," I=20

thought, "that you have given up your villa at Clapham, and the friends tha=

worshipped at the Bodwinkle shrine, who gazed upon you with reverend upturn=

irreverent upturned noses, like the present company! Do you think, when you=
 have blazed for a=20

moment and gone out like a blue-light, that you will know how to find your =
way in the dark back to=20

Clapham, or that you will be able to collect your old congregation? Will no=
