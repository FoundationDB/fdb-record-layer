"Oh, we don't want to trespass," spoke Nat. "We'll go."  "You'd better," was the grim response of 

the man who had first spoken. "Clear out, and don't come here again. We don't want any spies 

around."  "We're not spies," said Jack, wondering that the man should use such a term.  "Well, we 

don't care what you are. Clear out! That's all! Clear out!"  There was nothing to do but turn back. 

Slowly Jack and Nat wheeled their horses, meanwhile narrowly eyeing the men. The trio, though 

roughly dressed, did not appear like hard characters or desperadoes. They looked like miners. 

"You'll have to move faster than that," said the man who had spoken first. "If you don't we may 

have to make you."  There was a movement in the bushes back of him, and Jack and Nat glanced 

in that direction to see who was coming. Another figure stepped into view, the figure of a lad well 

known to Jack and Nat, for it was none other than Jerry Chowden, the former bully of Washington 

Hall.  "Jerry Chowden!" gasped Jack.  "Jack--Jack Ranger!" exclaimed the bully, no less surprised 

than were the two lads on horses.  "Do you know him?" asked one of the men quickly of Jerry. 

"Yes--er--that is----"  "Come on, you! Move away from here if you don't want to get into trouble!" 

fairly shouted one of the men. He advanced toward Jack and Nat, who, deeming discretion the 

better part of valor, clapped spurs to their horses, and raced along the trail to rejoin their 

companions. As they galloped on Jack gave one glance over his shoulder. He saw Jerry Chowden 

in earnest conversation with the three men, and that our hero and Nat was the subject of the talk 

was evident from the manner in which the bully was pointing toward them.     CHAPTER XXVIII 

WILL SAVES JACK'S LIFE   "What do you think of that, Jack?" asked Nat. "Bullyragging bean-

poles! but who would have expected to meet Jerry Chowden out here? What do you make of it?" 

"I don't know," Jack replied. "I'm as much surprised as you are. Not only at seeing him, but at 

meeting those men, and at being ordered back."  "Do you think Jerry had anything to do with them 

making us move away?"  "How do you mean?"  "I mean do you think he told those men lies about 

us? Such as saying we were dangerous characters, and not safe to have around?"  "No, I hardly 

think that. I believe those men have something to conceal, and would order back any one who 

they thought would discover their secret. They ordered us back before Jerry appeared and 

recognized us."  "That's so. But how do you suppose he came to get in with them?"  "I don't know. 

It's all part of the same puzzle, I think--the mysterious sounds, the queer marks in the snow, and 

all that. Of course, Jerry may have met them by accident, and they might have hired him. We 

knew he came out West, you know, after the part he played in kidnapping us, and very likely he 

was willing to do any kind of rascally work these men wanted."  "Yes, that's probable. But what do 

you s'pose it is?"  "I give it up; that is, for the time being. But I'm going to solve this mystery, Nat, if 

it takes all winter. We've got something to do now besides hunt. We'll see what these men are up 

to. Maybe it's something criminal, such as Jonas Lavine and his gang were mixed up in."  "I hardly 

think that."  "What do you think, then?"  "I believe they have some rare kind of animal or bird, or, 

maybe, several of them, and they are going to place them on exhibition. For I'm sure the noise we 

heard, and the marks in the snow, were made by some gigantic bird."  "Oh, you're away off," 

declared Jack. "It isn't possible."  "That's all right. 'Most anything is possible nowadays," answered 

Nat.  They soon rejoined their comrades, and told them what had happened. Sam was for going 

on, defying the men, and administering a sound drubbing to Jerry.  "Then we'll find out what's up," 

he said, "and end all this suspense."  "Yes, and maybe get into trouble," objected Jack. "There 

must be several men in that camp, if it was a camp, and those we saw seemed ready to use their 



guns on us. No, I think we'll have to prospect around a bit first, until we see how the land lays. I'm 

not going to run into danger. We made a mistake by moving too suddenly in the bogus stock 

certificate case, and only because of good luck were the rascals caught. I'm going a little never 

have I heard a man confess that he was guilty of this sin. The Bible does not tell of one man who 

ever recovered from it, and in all my experience I do not recall many who have been able to shake 

it off after it had fastened on them. A covetous man or woman generally remains covetous to the 

very end.  We may say that covetous desire plunged the human race into sin. We can trace the 

river back from age to age until we get to its rise in Eden. When Eve saw that the forbidden fruit 

was good for food and that it was desirable to the eyes, she partook of it, and Adam with her. They 

were not satisfied with all that God had showered upon them, but coveted the wisdom of gods 

which Satan deceitfully told them might be obtained by eating the fruit. She saw,--she desired--

then she took! Three steps from innocence into sin.  A SEARCHING COMMANDMENT.  It would 

be absurd for such a law as this to be placed upon any human statute book. It could never be 

enforced. The officers of the law would be powerless to detect infractions. The outward conduct 

may be regulated, but the thoughts and intents of a man are beyond the reach of human law.  But 

God can see behind outward actions. He can read the thoughts of the heart. Our innermost life, 

invisible to mortal eye, is laid bare before Him. We cannot deceive Him by external conformity. He 

is able to detect the least transgression and shortcoming, so that no man can shirk detection. God 

cannot be imposed upon by the cleanness of the outside of the cup and the platter.  Surely we 

have here another proof that the Ten Commandments are not of human origin, but must be divine. 

This commandment, then, did not, even on the surface, confine itself to visible actions as did the 

preceding commandments. Even before Christ came and showed their spiritual sweep, men had a 

commandment that went beneath public-conduct and touched the very springs of action. It directly 

prohibited--not the wrong act, but the wicked desire that prompted the act. It forbade the evil 

thought, the unlawful wish. It sought to prevent--not only sin, but the desire to sin. In God's sight it 

is as wicked to set covetous eyes, as it is to lay thieving hands, upon anything that is not ours. 

And why? Because if the evil desire can be controlled, there will be no outbreak in conduct. 

Desires have been called "actions in the egg." The desire in the heart is the first step in the series 

that ends in action. Kill the evil desire, and you successfully avoid the ill results that would follow 

upon its hatching and development. Prevention is better than cure.  We must not limit 

covetousness to the matter of money. The commandment is not thus limited; it reads, "Thou shalt 

not covet. . . anything. . . ." That word "anything" is what will condemn us. Though we do not join in 

the race for wealth, have we not sometimes a hungry longing for our neighbor's goodly lands--fine 

houses,--beautiful clothes,--brilliant reputation,--personal accomplishments,--easy circumstances,-

-comfortable surroundings? Have we not had the desire to increase our possessions or to change 

our lot in accordance with what we see in others? If so, we are guilty of having broken this law. 

GODS THOUGHTS ABOUT COVETOUSNESS.  Let us examine a few of the Bible passages that 

bear down on this sin, and see what are God's thoughts about it.  "_Know ye not that the 

unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor 

idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves,_ 

nor covetous, _nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God_." 

Notice that the covetous are named between thieves and drunkards. We lock up thieves, and have 



no mercy on them. We loathe drunkards, and consider them great sinners against the law of God 

as well as the law of the land. Yet there is far more said in the Bible against covetousness than 

against either stealing or drunkenness.  Covetousness and stealing are almost like Siamese twins-

-they go together so often. In fact we might add lying, and make them triplets. "The covetous 

person is a thief _in_ the shell. The thief is a covetous person _out of_ the shell. Let a covetous 

person see something that he desires very much; let an opportunity of taking it be 


_
"Jerry Chowden is certainly going to the bad fast," declared Bony.  "We don't know that he is in 

anything bad this time," said Jack. "It may be all right, and those men may be engaged in some 

regular business. But I admit it looks suspicious."  A sharp snowstorm kept the boys in camp the 

next two days, but on the third, as fresh meat was getting low, they started off again after game, 

leaving Budge and Long Gun, as usual, in charge of the place.  "Boys, we've got to get something 

this time," said Jack. "The place is like Mother Hubbard's cupboard, almost bare, so don't despise 

even jack-rabbits, though, of course, a nice deer or a sheep would go better."  They had been 

directed by Long Gun to take a trail that led obliquely up the side of the mountain, as the Indian 

said it was a likely place for game, and at noon they camped in a little clearing for lunch, having 

had no sight of anything bigger than squirrels, which they would not shoot.  "I tell you what it is," 

said Jack, after thinking the matter over, "I believe we're too closely bunched. We ought to divide 

up, some go one way, and some the other. We'd be more likely to see something then. We can 

make a circle, and work our way around back to camp by nightfall."  "All right," agreed Sam. "Bony 

and I will take the trail to the left, and you can go to the right with Nat and Will. I'll wager we beat 

you, too."  "That's a go," agreed Jack. "Come on."  A little later the two parties of young hunters 

separated, and were soon lost to sight of each other.  For an hour or more Jack, Nat and Will 

slowly urged their horses through the light snow. They kept a sharp lookout for signs of game, but 

were beginning to despair of seeing any, when Jack uttered a cry.  "There's been a deer along 

here," he said. "And not long ago, either, if I'm any judge of the signs Long Gun taught us."  "It 

does look so," admitted Nat. "Easy, now, and maybe we can trail him."  "We'd better leave our 

horses, in his true character as a thief." The Greek word translated "covetousness" means--an 

inordinate desire of getting. When the Gauls tasted the sweet wines of Italy, they asked where 

they came from, and never rested until they had overrun Italy.  "_For this ye know, that no 

whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in 

the kingdom of Christ and God_."  There we have the same truth repeated; but notice that 

covetousness is called idolatry. The covetous man worships Mammon, not God.  "_Moreover thou 

shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth,_ hating 

covetousness; _and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, 

rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens_."  Isn't it extraordinary that Jethro, the man of the desert, should 

have given this advice to Moses? How did he learn to beware of covetousness? We honor men to-

day if they are wealthy and covetous. We elect them to office in church and state. We often say 

that they will make better treasurers just because we know them to be covetous. But in God's sight 

a covetous man is as vile and black as any thief or drunkard. David said: "The wicked boasteth of 

his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth." I am afraid that many 

who profess to have put away wickedness also speak well of the covetous.  A SORE EVIL.  "_He 

that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this 

is also vanity. When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to 

the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? The sleep of the laboring man is 

sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 

There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to 

their hurt_."  Isn't that true? Is the covetous man ever 


_
and they make quite a bit of noise."  "I'll stay with them," volunteered Nat. "I've had my share of 

good shots lately. Let Will have a show. You and he go ahead, Jack."  Jack did not want to leave 

Nat, but his chum insisted that some one had to stay with the animals, and he wanted to do it. So 

Will and Jack started off alone to trail the deer.  They went on about a mile, the trail becoming 

fresher at every step, until Will, who was close behind Jack, gently touched his companion on the 

arm and pointed to the left.  There, framed in a little opening of the trees, pawing the snow off the 

grass in a little glade, stood a noble buck mule deer, the largest Jack had ever seen. The animal 

had not heard nor scented them.  "Take the shot, Will," urged Jack. "You may never get another 

like that."  "No, I'd rather you would."  "Nonsense. I've shot several of 'em. You take it."  "I'd rather 

you would."  "Go on," urged Jack in a whisper. "Wait, though, we'll move forward a bit, and you 

work off to the left. You'll get a better possessions? Aren't they vanity? Does he have peace of 

mind? Don't selfish riches always bring hurt?  The folly of covetousness is well shown in the 

following extract: "If you should see a man that had a large pond of water, yet living in continual 

thirst, nor suffering himself to drink half a draught for fear of lessening his pond; if you should see 

him wasting his time and strength in fetching more water to his pond, always thirsty, yet always 

carrying a bucket of water in his hand, watching early and late to catch the drops of rain, gaping 

after every cloud, and running greedily into every mire and mud in hopes of water, and always 

studying how to make every ditch empty itself into the pond; if you should see him grow grey in 

these anxious labors, and at last end a thirsty life by falling into his own pond, would you not say 

that such a one was not only the author of his own disquiet, but was foolish enough to be 

reckoned among madmen? But foolish and absurd as this character is, it does not represent half 

the 


_
wind's just right."  They went forward a few feet cautiously, until they stood just on the edge of the 

clearing. Then Will, stepping a few paces to the left, raised his rifle. No sooner had he done so 

than, to his surprise and regret, his arms began to shake violently. He had a severe touch of 

disquiets of the covetous man."  I have read of a millionaire in France, who was a miser. In order 

to make sure of his wealth, he dug a cave in his wine cellar so large and deep that he could go 

down into it with a ladder. The entrance had a door with a spring lock. After a time, he was 

missing. 


_
"I--I can't do it. I'm too nervous," he said in a whisper to Jack.  "Nonsense. Wait a minute and aim 

again. You'll be all right in a second. Take a long breath and count five."  Will did as directed, but it 

was no use. The muzzle of his rifle wobbled more than ever when he tried to aim.  "I--I can't," he 

whispered again. "You shoot, Jack."  Then, realizing that Will was too nervous to do it, and not 

wanting to see the buck made, but they could find no trace of him. At last his house was sold, and 

the purchaser discovered this door in the cellar. He opened it, went down, and found the miser 

lying dead on the ground, in the midst of his riches. The door must have shut accidentally after 

him, and he perished miserably.  A TEMPTATION AND A SNARE.  "_They that will be_, (that is, 

desire to be), _rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
