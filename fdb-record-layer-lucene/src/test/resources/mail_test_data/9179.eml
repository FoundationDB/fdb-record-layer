miled and quoth in=20

reply, "No, my child, no, I was not born in a manger, but if they keep on t=
axing me, I fear I shall die=20

in one!"  The Italians have high hopes of harnessing their nine millions of=
 horsepower in Alpine=20

water-falls, running their state-owned railroads and public utilities with =
it, and introducing electricity=20

as an industrial power into Italian homes, thus bringing back to the homes =
of the people the home=20

industries like weaving which steam took away a century ago. But this is on=
ly a dream. Yet=20

sometimes dreams do come true. And dreams are wishes unexpressed; and in th=
is clay of=20

democratic power, a wish with a ballot behind it becomes a will, and soon h=
ardens into a fact. The=20

times are changing. But of course human nature remains much the same. Men u=
nder a given=20

environment will do about the same kind of things under one set of circumst=
ances. But we should=20

not forget in our computations that laws, customs, traditions, the distribu=
tion of wealth, make an=20

entirely new environment, and that circumstances are not the same when envi=
ronment differs.=20

That the surroundings of those people known collectively as "the poor" have=
 changed, and=20

changed permanently by the war, no one who sees them in Europe can doubt. T=
hey are well-fed,=20

well-housed, and are determined to be well-educated. They know that they ca=
n use their ballots to=20

get their share of the wealth they produce. They are never going to be cont=
ent again with crusts.=20

They are motived now by hope rather than by fear, and they are going to rea=
ct strangely during=20

the next ten years on the social structure of this old world. But even the =
new majority will not=20

change everything of course. Grass will grow, water will run down hill, sma=
rt men will lead fools,=20

wise men will have the places of honour and power, in proportion to the pra=
cticality of their=20

wisdom. But for all that, we shall have in a rather large and certainly in =
a keenly interesting degree=20

a new heaven and a new earth.  Now as these speculations upon the new order=
 came to us as our=20

journey drew to its close in England, the war seemed slowly to change its m=
eaning. It became=20

something more than a conflict; it seemed to be a revolution--world-wide, a=
nd all encompassing.=20

Then we thought of "the front" in new his other aliment. It is most surpris=
ing that the Ottomacs do=20

not become lean by swallowing such quantities of earth: they are, on the co=
ntrary, extremely=20

robust. The missionary Fray Ramon Bueno asserts that he never remarked any =
alteration in the=20

health of the natives at the period of the great risings of the Orinoco.  T=
he Ottomacs during some=20

months eat daily three-quarters of a pound of clay slightly hardened by fir=
e, but which they moisten=20

before swallowing it. It has not been possible to verify hitherto with prec=
ision how much nutritious=20

vegetable or animal matter they take in a week at the same time; but they a=
ttribute the sensation=20

of satiety which they feel to the clay, and not to the wretched aliments wh=
ich they take with it=20

occasionally.  No physiological phenomenon being entirely insulated, it may=
 be interesting to=20

examine several analogous phenomena, which I have been able to collect. I o=
bserved everywhere=20

within the torrid zone, in a great number of individuals, children, women, =
and sometimes even full-

grown men, an inordinate and almost irresistible desire of swallowing earth=
; not an alkaline or=20

calcareous earth to neutralize (as it is said) acid juices, but a fat clay,=
 unctuous, and exhaling a=20

strong smell. It is often found necessary to tie the children's hands or to=
 confine them to prevent=20

them eating earth when the rain ceases to fall. At the village of Banco, on=
 the bank of the river=20

Magdalena, I saw the Indian women who make pottery continually swallowing g=
reat pieces of clay.=20

These women were not in a state of pregnancy; and they affirmed that earth =
is an aliment which=20

they do not find hurtful. In other American tribes, people soon fall sick, =
and waste away, when they=20



yield too much to this mania of eating earth. We found at the mission of Sa=
n Borja an Indian child=20

of the Guahiba nation, who was as thin as a skeleton. The mother informed u=
s that the little girl=20

was reduced to this lamentable state of atrophy in consequence of a disorde=
red appetite, she=20

having refused during four months to take almost any other food than clay. =
Yet San Borja is only=20

twenty-five leagues distant from the mission of Uruana, inhabited by that t=
ribe of the Ottomacs,=20

who, from the effect no doubt of a habit progressively acquired, swallow th=
e poya without=20

experiencing any pernicious effects. Father=20


_
We realized that behind the curtain in Germany, a despotic will, scientific=
ally guided, is controlling=20

the food, the munitions, the assembling of men and materials for this war. =
But on this side of the=20

German curtain at the "front" which we knew, a democratic purpose is doing =
these things. The=20

view of that democratic purpose at work, to me at least, was my chief troph=
y of the war. The laws=20

which make food conservation possible, which direct shipping, mobilize rail=
roads, control industry,=20

regulate wages, prescribe many of the habits of life to fit the war, all ri=
se out of the experience of=20

the people. There is a vast amount of the "consent of the governed" in this=
 whole war game, so far=20

as the Allies are concerned. And as it is in democratic finance, so also is=
 it in the taste and talent=20

and capacity for war. That also is democratic. What a wide range of human a=
ctivity is massed in=20

this business of war!  For days and days after we left the continent, in ou=
r minds we could see=20

armies moving into the trenches somewhere along the "far flung battle line,=
" and other armies=20

moving out. The picture haunted us. It seemed to me a cinematograph of demo=
cracy. For the=20

change of an army division from the trenches, tired, worn and bedraggled, m=
oving wearily to its=20

station of rest, with another army division, fresh and eager, moving up fro=
m its station of rest to the=20

front, is indeed a social miracle. It is a fine bit of human machinery. So =
in terms of our modern=20

democracy it may be well to review the interminable panorama of this democr=
atic war. Fifty years=20

ago it would have been a memorable achievement. Waterloo itself was not suc=
h a miracle. Yet=20

somewhere in this war, this wonder is done every day and no record is made =
of it. Imagine=20

hundreds of miles of wide, white roads, hard-surfaced and graded for the wa=
r, leading to a sector=20

of the line. To make and keep these roads, itself is a master's job. Imagin=
e the roads filled all day=20

with two long lines of trucks, passing and repassing; one line carrying its=
 guns and camp outfit, its=20

whole paraphernalia of war, going to the battle front in the hills; another=
 never-ceasing procession=20

with its martial impedimenta coming out of the hills to rest. A few horses =
hauling big gun carriages=20

straggle through the dust. Here and there, but rarely, is a group of marchi=
ng men--generally men=20

singing as they march. Occasionally a troop of German prisoners marching wi=
th the goose step,=20

comes swinging along carrying their shovels at a martial angle--road mender=
s--which proves that=20

we are more than thirty kilos from the firing line; now and then a camp-kit=
chen rattles past. But=20

ever in one's ears is the rich rumble of trucks, recalling the voluptuous s=
ound of the circus wagon=20

on the village street. But always there are two great circus parades, one g=
oing up, one coming=20

down. Lumbering trucks larger than city house-moving vans whirl by in dust =
clouds; oil, or rather=20

the melted fat of the crocodile, when they feel any gastric obstructions; b=
ut the missionary whom=20

we found among them was little disposed to confirm this assertion. It may b=
e asked, why the=20

mania of eating earth is much more rare in the frigid and temperate than in=
 the torrid zones; and=20

why in Europe it is found only among women in a state of pregnancy, and sic=
kly children. This=20

difference between hot and temperate climates arises perhaps only from the =
inert state of the=20

functions of the stomach caused by strong cutaneous perspiration. It has be=
en supposed to be=20

observed that the inordinate taste for eating earth augments among the Afri=
can slaves, and=20

becomes more pernicious when they are restricted to a regimen purely vegeta=
ble and deprived of=20

spirituous liquors.  The negroes on the coast of Guinea delight in eating a=
 yellowish earth, which=20

they call caouac. The slaves who are taken to America endeavour to indulge =
in this habit; but it=20

proves detrimental to their health. They say that the earth of the West Ind=
ies is not so easy of=20

digestion as that of their country. Thibaut de Chanvalon, in his Voyage to =
Martinico, expresses=20



himself very judiciously on this pathological phenomenon. "Another cause," =
he says, "of this pain=20

in the stomach is that several of the negroes, who come from the coast of G=
uinea, eat earth; not=20

from a depraved taste, or in consequence of disease, but from a habit contr=
acted at home in=20

Africa, where they eat, they say, a particular earth, the taste of which th=
ey find agreeable, without=20

suffering any inconvenience. They seek in our islands for the earth most si=
milar to this, and prefer=20

a yellowish red volcanic tufa. It is sold secretly in our public markets; b=
ut this is an abuse which the=20

police ought to correct. The negroes who have this habit are so fond of cao=
uac, that no=20

chastisement will prevent their eating it."  In the Indian Archipelago, at =
the island of Java,=20

Labillardiere saw, between Surabaya and Samarang, little square and reddish=
 cakes exposed for=20

sale. These cakes called tanaampo, were cakes of clay, slightly baked, whic=
h the natives eat with=20

relish. The attention of physiologists, since my return from the Orinoco, h=
aving been powerfully=20

directed to these phenomena of geophagy, M. Leschenault (one of the natural=
ists of the expedition=20

to the Antarctic regions under the command of captain Baudin) has published=
 some curious details=20

on the tanaampo, or ampo, of the Javanese. "The reddish and somewhat ferrug=
inous clay," he=20

says "which the inhabitants of Java are fond of eating occasionally, is spr=
ead on a plate of iron,=20

and baked, after having been rolled into little cylinders in the form of th=
e bark of cinnamon. In this=20

state it takes the name of ampo, and is sold in the public markets. This cl=
ay has a peculiar taste,=20

which is owing to the baking: it is very absorbent, and adheres to the tong=
ue, which it dries. In=20

general it is only=20


_
trucks creak, groan and rumble by. Some of the trucks are mysteriously non-=
committal as to their=20

contents--again reproducing the impression of the circus parade. Probably t=
hey hide nothing more=20

terrible than tents or portable ice plants. But most of the trucks that go =
growling up and come=20

snarling down the great white roads, bear men; singing men, sleeping men, c=
heering men,=20

unshaved men, natty either in the time of pregnancy, or in order to grow th=
in; the absence of=20

plumpness being there regarded as a kind of beauty. The use of this earth i=
s fatal to health; the=20

women lose their appetite imperceptibly, and take only with relish a very s=
mall quantity of food; but=20

the desire of becoming thin, and of preserving a slender shape, induces the=
m to brave these=20

dangers, and maintains the credit=20


_
eating men, smoking men, old men and young men, but always cheerful men--pr=
ivate soldiers=20

hurrying about the business of war; to their trenches or from their trenche=
s, but always cheerful.=20

Sometimes a staff officer's car, properly caparisoned, shuttles through the=
 line like a flashing=20

needle; sometimes a car full of young officers of the line tries to nose ah=
ead of the men of the=20

regiment, but rather meekly do these youngsters try to sneak their advantag=
e, as one swiping an=20

apple; no great special privilege is theirs. Interminable lines of truck-mo=
unted guns rattle along,=20

each great gun festively named, The savage inhabitants of New Caledonia als=
o, to appease their=20

hunger in times of scarcity, eat great pieces of a friable Lapis ollaris. V=
auquelin analysed this=20

stone, and found in it, beside magnesia and silex in equal portions, a smal=
l quantity of oxide of=20

copper. M. Goldberry had seen the negroes in Africa, in the islands of Bunc=
k and Los Idolos, eat=20

an earth of which he had himself eaten, without being incommoded by it, and=
 which also was a=20

white and friable steatite. These examples of earth-eating in the torrid zo=
