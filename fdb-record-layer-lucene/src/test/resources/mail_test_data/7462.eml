because discipline was not over strict these days, and the men sat or lolled about the place; two of 

them were intent on a game of dominoes, another was watching them, whilst the other three were 

settling some sort of quarrel among themselves which necessitated vigorous and emphatic 

gestures and the copious use of expletives. One man, who appeared to be in command, divided 

his time impartially between the domino-players and those who were quarrelling.  The vast place 

was insufficiently lighted by a chandelier which hung from the ceiling and a couple of small oil-

lamps placed in the circular niches in the wall opposite the front door.  No one took any notice of 

Martin-Roget or of Chauvelin as they crossed the hall, and presently the latter pushed open a door 

on the left of the main gates and held it open for his colleague to pass through.  "You missed 

breaking his gun.  Beyond that he was arrested by a tree with such violence that he fell and lay for 

a minute or two, half-stunned. While lying thus, experience began to teach him, and common 

sense to have fair-play.  "A little more of this," he thought, "and I'm a dead man.  Besides, if it is 

difficult for me to traverse the forest in the dark, it is equally difficult for the savages.  My plan is to 

feel my way step by step, with caution.  That will be the quietest way, too, as well as the quickest. 

You're an excited fool, Dan!"  When a man begins to think, and call himself a fool, there is some 

hope of him.  Gathering himself up, and feeling his gun all over carefully, to make sure that it had 

not been broken, he continued to advance with excessive caution, and, in consequence, was ere 

long a considerable distance from the banks of the

"Quite sure," replied the other curtly. "And there is something which I must say to you ... where I 

know that I shall not be overheard."  Then he followed Martin-Roget into the room and closed the 

door behind him. The room was scantily furnished with a square deal table in the centre, two or 

three chairs, a broken-down bureau leaning against one wall and an iron stove wherein a meagre 

fire sent a stream of malodorous smoke through sundry cracks in its chimney-pipe. From the 

ceiling there hung an oil-lamp the light of which was thrown down upon the table, by a large green 

shade hazy idea as to what part of the country he had attained, or whither he was tending.  As the 

first excitement of flight passed away, Dan began to feel uneasy prickings of conscience at having 

so hastily sought safety for himself, though, upon reflection, he could not accuse himself of having 

deserted his comrades.  Okematan and the boys, he had good reason to believe--at least to hope-

-had succeeded in evading the foe, and Fergus he supposed had landed with himself, and was 

even at that moment making good his escape into the forest.  To find him, in the circumstances, 

he knew

Chauvelin drew a chair to the bureau and sat down; he pointed to another and Martin-Roget took a 

seat beside the table. He felt restless and excited--his nerves all on the jar: his colleague's calm, 

sardonic glance acted as a further irritant to his temper.  "What is it that you wished to say be 

impossible, and to shout by way of ascertaining his whereabouts he also knew to be useless as 

well as dangerous, as by doing so he would make his own position known to the enemy.  He also 

began to feel certain pricking sensations in his right leg as well as in his conscience.  The leg grew
