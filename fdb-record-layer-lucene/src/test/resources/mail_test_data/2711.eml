philodendron monstera pupils believed that nothing ever could pass Miss Martineau's observation; nevertheless, after Mrs. Ellsworthy's visit she was _distrait_, she was indifferent to mistakes, and she allowed her naughtiest and most troublesome rooms."  "Indeed, so soon? And do you really mean to go?"  "Certainly. Why not?"  "I suppose there is no reason why you should not. But----" she paused.

children!" exclaimed Mrs. Ellsworthy, "my poor, deluded, silly, obstinate children!" and then the 

good little woman burst into tears.     CHAPTER XV.  IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION.   But although 

Mrs. Ellsworthy wept and continued to stare.  "Let me interduce you," suggested the Captain. 

"Thank you, I'd better run along and help those in the house."  But she failed to suit the action to 

the word, and for the simple reason that the gaze of two perfectly normal young people became 

normally entangled. At length, a flood of

both persuasions and scoldings, and finally left the cottage in a state of deep offence, vowing 

within herself that she would never trouble her head again over the affairs of such silly and 

obstinate girls, she could not in the least shake Primrose's quiet resolve.  Primrose said over and 

over again: "Two things are cheeks, and she smiled.  "I--I beg your pardon for----" began the 

minister.  "Here, young feller," cut in the Captain as Mr. McGowan turned away, "I want to 

interduce you to my best friend, Miss Elizabeth Fox. This here is the new minister, Beth, Mack 

McGowan."  Elizabeth cordially extended her hand. "I've been

indispensable--we must be independent, and we must keep together. I can think of no better plan 

than this--it may fail, but we can but try it--we are certainly going to try it."  Mrs. Ellsworthy kept up 

her offence for twenty-four hours, then she began to soften, and to agree with her husband, whose 

solitary remark was, "My dear, you cannot coerce the children, and upon my word it's a plucky 

notion, and if those girls are brave enough to carry it out they must have real stuff in them."  "They 

may have plenty of stuff, and the plan may be as plucky as you like, Joseph," replied his excitable 

little wife. "I am quite willing to admire it in the abstract, but I am quite determined, if I have any 

influence whatever, to prevent them carrying it through."  Then she went off to Miss Martineau, 

interesting stories about your prowess, Mr. McGowan."  "I trust they are true."  "Indeed, they are. 

Captain Pott told me."  "I did make quite an impression on him," replied Mr. McGowan as he 

looked at the seaman's swollen eyelids. "I fear you've heard prejudiced accounts of me."  "I don't 

like them that way one bit," laughed Elizabeth, "even if a clergyman did do it."  "See here! I ain't 

going to stand this insinuating any longer," interposed the Captain, his good humor fully restored. 

"I cal'late they might want a hand to help swab decks, so I'll be going."  "But, Uncle Josiah,----"  "I 

know, Beth. I've been unpleasant, but being as you have come from the city to help me clean up 

the old craft, I'd otter show my appreciation by bossing the crew."  He seized the pail from the not 

unwilling

the sacred hour when she was engaged with her pupils. Mrs. Ellsworthy carried Miss Martineau 

away from her school, and shutting the door of that lady's little parlor, clasped the governess's thin 

hands, and poured her troubles into her ears.  "Joseph calls it plucky," said Mrs. Ellsworthy at the 

end of her narrative.  But Miss Martineau's face was perfectly aghast.  "Plucky!" she ejaculated. 

"Dear Mrs. Ellsworthy, pardon me, but your husband is a man--what can a man know about the 

intricate workings which go on within the breast of a perverse girl? Plucky!--I call it wicked--I call it

you'll like Little River well enough to wish to remain?" asked Elizabeth.  "Yes, I think I shall. Mr. 

Simpson has been telling me about your brother, and about his far-sightedness in organizing the 

Athletic Club."  "Did Mr. Simpson tell you how the club came to be formed in the first place?"  "No, 

but I think it a splendid idea. I hope the boys will let me be one of them."  She eyed him curiously. 

"Father sees no good in the organization. I do. Most of the boys are Harold's friends,--Harold is my 

brother,--but there are some who are not friendly 


_
Mainwaring has disappointed me deeply; she showed undue temper when I spoke to her here the 

other day--oh yes, this thing must be prevented by main force, if necessary."  Miss Martineau's 

pupils could not imagine what was the matter with her that morning. She was known to be a most 

strict disciplinarian, she was reported to have the sharpest eyes, and the quickest you ought to 

know that the decent ones were one time in the Sunday school, but because some of your church 

members would not try to understand them, they were forced to go to the Inn to set up their 

gymnasium."  "Isn't the Inn as good a place as any?"  "I prefer not to say. You'll doubtless find that 

out for yourself."  "That is one thing I intend to find out. I've
