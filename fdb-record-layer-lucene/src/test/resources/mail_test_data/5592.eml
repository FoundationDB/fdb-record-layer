On the banks of the latter river dwell the Cheruvichahenas, some families of whom I have _
moonrise, and met our ambulance men--mostly young college boys joyously flirting with death 

under the German guns. They were stationed in a tent well outside the big hospital building. They 

gave us a dinner worth while--onion soup, thick rare steak with peas and carrots, some sort of 

pasta--perhaps macaroni or raviolli, a jelly omelet soused in rum, and served burning blue blazes, 

and cheese and coffee--and this from a camp kitchen from a French cook on five minutes' notice, 

an hour after the regular dinner. The ambulance men were under the direct command of a French 

lieutenant--a Frenchman of a quiet, gentle, serious type, who welcomed us beautifully, played host 

graciously and told us many interesting things about the work of the army around him; and told it 

so simply--yet withal so sadly, that it impressed his face and manner upon us long after we had left 

him. Three or four times a day we were meeting French lieutenants who had charge of our 

ambulance men at the front. But this one was different. He was so gentle and so serious without 

being at all solemn. He had been in the September, when the Orinoco decreases and returns into 

its bed, the ducks, warned either by the voices of the most experienced birds of passage, or by 

that internal feeling which, not knowing how to define, we call instinct, return from the Amazon and 

the Rio Branco towards the north. At this period they are too lean to tempt the appetite of the 

Indians of the Rio Negro, and escape pursuit more easily from being accompanied by a species of 

herons (gavanes) which are excellent eating. Thus the Indians eat ducks in March, and herons in 

September. We could not learn what becomes of the gavanes during the swellings of the Orinoco, 

and why they do not accompany the patos careteros in their migration from the Orinoco to the Rio 

Branco. These regular migrations of birds from one part of the tropics towards another, in a zone 

which is during the whole year of the same temperature, are very extraordinary phenomena. The 

southern coasts of the West India Islands receive also every year, at the period of the inundations 

of the great rivers of Terra Firma, numerous flights of the

said quite incidentally, that under the law of averages his time was long past due and he expected 

to go soon. It didn't seem to bother him. He passed the rum omelet with a steady hand. But his 

serious mien had attracted the ambulance boys and upon the room of his office in the big brick 

hospital they had scrawled in chalk, "Defense absolutement de rire!" "It's absolutely forbidden to 

laugh." Evidently American humour got on his nerves. As we dined in the tent, the boys outside 

sang trench songs, and college songs with trench words, and gave other demonstrations of their 

youth.  So we ate and listened to the singing, while the moon rose, and with it came a fog--more 

than a fog--a cloud of heavy mist that hid the moon. We moved our baggage Orinoco, and of its 

tributary streams. We must presume that the variations of drought and humidity in the equinoctial 

zone have the same influence as the great changes of temperature in our climates, on the habits 

of animals. The heat of summer, and the pursuit of insects, call the humming-birds into the 

northern parts of the United States, and into Canada as far as the parallels of Paris and Berlin: in 

the same manner a greater facility for fishing draws the web-footed and long-legged birds from the 

north to the south, from the Orinoco towards the Amazon. Nothing is more marvellous, and 

nothing is yet known less clearly in a geographical point of view, than the direction, extent, and 

term of the migrations of birds.  After having entered

in a vacant ward in the big hospital. We saw in the misty moonlight a great brick structure running 

around a compound. The compound was over 200 feet square, and in the centre of the compound 

was a big Red Cross made of canvas, painted red, on a background of whitewashed stones. It 

was 100 feet square. On each side of the compound a Red Cross blazed from the roof of the 

buildings, under the Geneva lights--lights which the Germans small cataract at the confluence of 

the two rivers, we discovered, at the distance of a quarter of a league, the mission of Maroa. This 

village, containing one hundred and fifty Indians, presented an appearance of ease and prosperity. 

We purchased some fine specimens of the toucan alive; a courageous bird, the intelligence of 

which is developed like that of our domestic ravens. We passed on the right, above Maroa, first
