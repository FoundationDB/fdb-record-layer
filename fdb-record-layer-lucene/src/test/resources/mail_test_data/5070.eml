its east and its west. The west, I have been told, is the aristocratic and expensive quarter, so of 

course we won't go there. In the east, the miserably poor and dirty people live--we won't trouble 

them--therefore our choice must lie between the south and the north. On the whole, I am inclined 

to try the north side of London."       "For dark and true and tender is the North,"  quoted Jasmine 

with enthusiasm. "By all means, Rose, we will go northwards, but how shall we go?"  "We'll inquire 

at the post-office just round this corner," answered Primrose, with decision.  Accordingly, having 

received some rather lucid instructions the girls found themselves in a few moments in an omnibus 

going towards Holloway. About noon they were landed there, and then their search began. Oh, the 

weariness of that long day! Oh, the painful experience of the three! They knew nothing about 

London prices--they had not an idea whether they were being imposed upon or not.  "On one point 

we have quite made up our minds," said Jasmine, sturdily; "we won't go back to the Mansion until 

we have found rooms."  The truth of Mrs. Dredge's prophecy became only too apparent. All the 

apartments that were bright and clean and cheery were quite too expensive for Primrose's slender 

purse. At last she came to a resolution.  "Girls," she said, "we must take rooms that look dirty, and 

make them clean. We have at least been taught how to polish, and how to scrub, and how to 

clean. You know, Jasmine, how shocked Miss Martineau was when she saw you one day with a 

pair of gloves on down on your knees polishing the drawing-room grate at Rosebury. You said you 

liked to do it. How distressed she was! and how that grate did shine!"  "Don't let us talk about 

Rosebury just now," said Jasmine, with a quiver in her voice. "Yes, Primrose darling, of course we 

can make our own rooms clean--we can even re-paper the walls, and we can whitewash the 

ceilings. Now we know exactly what to do. At the very next house where we see 'Apartments to 

Let,' we'll ask for dirty rooms, then of course we'll get them cheap."  "Those attics that we saw at 

that last house?" questioned Primrose, thoughtfully. "They were rather large, and not very dark. If 

we took down that paper, and put up a fresh one, and if we whitened the ceilings and scrubbed the 

floors, why, those rooms might do. They were not very expensive for London--only twelve shillings 

a week."  "A frightful rent!" said Jasmine. "No wonder the people here look careworn, and pinched, 

and old. We'll go back to that house, Primrose. On the whole, the rooms may suit us. What is the 

landlady's name?--Oh, Mrs. Dove. We'll go back to Mrs. Dove and take her rooms."  Accordingly, 

in a funny little street off the Junction Road, the three Mainwaring girls found a nest. It was a queer 

nest, up at the top of a tall and rambling house; but Mrs. Dove appeared good-natured, and had 

no objection to the young ladies doing their own papering and white-washing, and as Primrose 

took the rooms on the spot, and paid a week's rent in advance, she became quite gracious. Every 

morning, as soon as ever breakfast was over at Penelope Mansion, the girls started off to the new 

home they were preparing for themselves. There they worked hard, papering, white-washing, and, 

finally, even painting. By the end of a week Mrs. Dove scarcely knew her attic apartments--elegant 

she now called them--a charming suite. The enthusiasm of the three young workers even infected 

Mrs. Dove, who condescended to clean the windows, and to rub up the shabby furniture, so that 

when, at the end of the week, the attics were ready for occupation, they were by no means so 

unlike Jasmine's ideal London rooms as might have been expected. The girls kept their own 

counsel, and during the week they were preparing for their flight to Eden Street--for No. 10 Eden 

Street would be their future address--they told no one at Penelope Mansion of their little plans. 

The good ladies of the Mansion, Mrs. Flint excepted, were very curious about them; they 



wondered why the girls disappeared every day immediately after breakfast, and came back 

looking hot and tired, and yet with bright and contented faces, at night; but Jasmine had ceased to 

confide in Mrs. Dredge; and Primrose, when she chose to be dignified, had quite power enough to 

keep even Miss Slowcum at a distance. Mrs. Mortlock, who was stout, and rich, and good-

tempered, tried the effect of a little bribery on Daisy, but the sweet, staunch little maid would not 

be corrupted.  "Oh, thank you so much for those delicious chocolate creams," she said. "Yes, I 

_do_ love chocolate creams, and you are so kind to give them to me. Where do we spend our 

day?--but that is Primrose's secret--you would not have me so naughty as to tell!"  So the week 

drew to an end, and the nest, as the girls called their rooms, was finally ready for its inmates. The 

snowy-white muslin curtains were really put up to the now clean windows--the walls, covered with 

a delicate paper, had a soft, rosy glow about them--some of the pretty home ornaments were 

judiciously scattered about, and the rather small bedroom had three very small, but very white, 

little beds in it.  "We'll go in for lots of flowers, you know," said Jasmine. "I don't suppose even in 

London flowers are very dear."  At last there came a morning when the girls went away from 

Penelope Mansion as usual, and only Mrs. Flint and Poppy knew that they were not returning in 

the evening. Mrs. Flint felt rather indignant with the young ladies for deserting her--not that she 

said anything for she always made it a rule not to wear herself out with unnecessary words, or with 

fretting, or with undue excitement; nevertheless, on this occasion she was a little indignant, for 

surely, what place could compare with the Mansion? Poor Poppy bade the young ladies, whom 

she loved, good-bye with an almost breaking heart.  "It's all one, Miss Jasmine," she exclaimed; "if 

it was my dying breath, I'd have to own that London is not what we pictered it--vanities there is, 

and troubles there is, and disappointments most numerous and most biting. But for the one happy 

day I spent out with you dear young ladies, I hasn't known no happiness in London. Oh, Miss 

Jasmine," drawing up short and looking her young lady full in the face--"what dreadful lies them 

novels tells! I read them afore I came, and I made up such wonderful picters; but I will own that 

what with the ladies in this mansion, as worrit me almost past bearing, and what with you going 

away all secret like, and what with me being no longer Poppy the tare, but Sarah Jane the drudge, 

even if I was to get one of the bonnets that they show in the shop windows in Bond Street, why, it 

wouldn't draw a smile from me Miss Jasmine!"     CHAPTER XXI.  HOW TO PAINT CHINA AND 

HOW TO FORM STYLE.   Mrs. Dove had a great many lodgers--she let rooms on each of her 

floors, and she called her lodgers by the name of the floor they occupied--first floor, second floor, 

third floor came and went to 10, Eden Street. The girls were known as "the attics," and Jasmine 

felt very indignant at the name.  "It's almost as bad as being a tare," she said to Primrose. "Dear, 

dear! I never thought I should turn into an attic! What an unpleasant place London is! I begin to 

think Poppy is quite right in what she says of it."  "I begin to suspect," said Primrose, "that London, 

like all places, has its shady  "Maybe he's the one who has made Harry believe it is so. In that 

case, I'm 'feared my views on the subject might set off some real fireworks."  "But you must make 

him believe you! Can't you say something?"  "I ain't sartin but I might say a thing or two, and they 

won't be words fit for a prayer-meeting, either."  "Then, you will speak to him?" she asked eagerly. 

"We'll see, Eadie. Maybe I'll do something, too. But I cal'late we'd best begin as Scripture says, 

right here at home."  "You mean you'll speak to Harry? What will you say?"  "I ain't got it all figured 

out yet being as we're camped on this here sand-heap. If I was aboard ship I'd kick him down the 



deck and up again, then into the hatches for a little tonic for disobeying orders. Beyond that, I ain't 

able to say right offhand."  Mrs. Beaver clutched the back of a chair. "Oh, don't hurt my Harry! He's 

all I've got!"  "He ain't wuth boasting about, Eadie. But being as he is all you've got in the way of 

earthly possession, and being as we're on land, I cal'late I won't do harm. But if I was you I'd steer 

him clear of these channels for a spell till I calm down a mite."  "O dear! I've made a mistake 

coming to you, and I hoped you'd help me. I shouldn't have told you!"  "We won't argue that p'int." 

"Whatever shall I do!"  "The fust thing I'd do,"--suggested the Captain, slowly nodding his head for 

emphasis,--"would be to use a little discipline on your fust mate."  "But I can't make Harry mind 

any more!"  The pitiful figure gave the Captain an uneasy feeling as he tried to return her pathetic 

gaze. He replied kindly:  "Eadie, you've always held a purty tight rein over that husband of yours, 

about the best I ever see drawn over a prancing colt. You'd best tighten up a mite on them reins, 

right sudden-like."  "But I haven't any power over him now. He's that worked up that I can't even 

talk to him. He shuts me right up."  "What's that? You can't handle that little shrimp?"  She uttered 

a cry, and looked past the Captain, through the dining-room door, into the hall. The seaman turned 

in the direction of her wild and distracted gaze. Mr. Beaver, more wild and distracted than his 

spouse, stood in the door, the incarnation of burning passion and pent up fury.  "W-What are you 

d-doing in this m-man's house?" he shouted, his shrill voice breaking into a ferocious shriek, as he 

blinked and pointed at his frightened wife.  Captain Pott was so surprised that he merely gaped at 

the infuriated little man.  "Harry, please don't!" pleaded Mrs. Beaver, drawing back against the 

wainscoting.  "C-Come out of h-here!" hissed her husband. He brought his heel down with such 

vehemence that he chipped off a splinter from the threshold.  "Best stand back, Eadie, and be 

careful not to touch him," advised the Captain, eyeing the human cyclone with amusement and 

amazement. "Looks mighty dangerous, and sort as if he might go off."  Harry met these words with 

a blazing glare.  "Cal'late you'd best come in and cool off a mite, Harry. You seem sort of het up." 

"W-Woman, c-come w-with m-me!" spluttered Mr. Beaver.  He strutted round the room, well out of 

the Captain's reach, and back again toward the door, looking for the world like a young barnyard 

fowl. But his wife did not follow.  "She ain't going just yet. We was having a quiet-like chat when 

you busted in here, and I cal'late we'd best make it three-sided, that is, if you ain't got no 

reasonable objection to raise. Come, you ain't in that rush."  Harry bounded toward the door. So, 

also, did the Captain. A heavy hand fell on the shoulder of the little man and spun him about.  "It's 

real nice of you to come in like this for a friendly conflab," said the seaman, dangerously pleasant. 

"M-Man, t-take your h-hand off m-me! H-How dare y-you a-assault m-me! I'll h-have the law on y-

you!"  "That's all right, Harry." The expression on the Captain's face contrasted sharply with his 

quiet words. "There'll be plenty of time for that. I've been feeling real slighted because you ain't 

been to see me for some time. Cal'late a little conversation will do us both a heap of good, and 

clear up the air a mite."  Mr. Beaver again started for the door, but the Captain reached it first. He 

closed it, turned the key in the lock, and put the key in his pocket.  "Now, suppose you spin the 

yarn to me that you've been spreading round town," he said, slowly filling his pipe and offering the 

pouch to Harry Beaver.  Mr. Beaver spurned the weed of peace with a ferocious glare. With a little 

coaching the Captain brought out the story. The gist of the matter was that Mr. Beaver considered 

McGowan morally lax in the free way he was mixing with the boys at the Inn.  "Let's get this 

straight. Who is the feller you're talking about? Just repeat his name to me."  "M-McGowan!" 



defiantly repeated Mr. Beaver.  "When mentioning him to me,"--requested the Captain in a tone 

that made the other man start with apprehension,--"you'll call him _Mr._ McGowan. Understand 

that?"  Mr. Beaver seemed fully to understand, for he obeyed. When he had finished his yarn of 

sheer nonsense, Captain Pott slowly laid his pipe on the table and his hand on the little man's 

collar. He led him to the door, and opened it. Harry tugged like a bull-pup on the end of a leash, so 

that when the Captain released his hold--with ever so slight a shove--Mr. Beaver described a 

spread-eagle on the cinder path.  "If you repeat that rotten truck to another soul, I ain't going to be 

responsible for what happens to you!" He shot each word at the kicking figure from between set 

teeth, and brushed one hand over the other as though to clean them of filth.  Mrs. Beaver ran to 

her husband, lifted him out of the cinders, and patted the ashes from his clothing. Harry Beaver 

stood irresolutely for a moment, and violently shook his fist at the man standing in the door.  "Y-

You'll p-p-pay for this!" He spit out words and cinders with gasping breath.  Captain Pott went 

inside. He washed his breakfast dishes. He was by no means as calm as he appeared. The whole 

day through he fed the fires of his anger. That night he urged the minister to stay at home. He 

even begged him not to go to the Inn. Mr. McGowan asked the reason for his deep concern. The 

Captain could give none, except to say that the microbes were working overtime. But duty called 

more loudly than his friend's fears, and Mr. McGowan went that evening to the Inn. An hour later 

the Captain's intuition got the upper hand of his judgment, and he followed.     CHAPTER V   An 

ominous murmur of voices, with a deep growling undertone, floated up from the improvised 

gymnasium in the basement as Captain Pott entered the swinging doors of Willow-Tree Inn. This 

was followed by a more ominous silence. The seaman bounded down the steps. The sight that 

met his gaze caused him to stop short. On each side of the low room men and boys were drawn 

up in lines, and the division was as clean cut as though chosen for a tug of war. The doors at the 

far end of the gymnasium swung back, and a stranger, stripped to the waist, stepped gingerly into 

the room. Sim Hicks met the man, and began to tie a pair of boxing gloves to his hands. While the 

Captain looked on in utter amazement, the doors again swung back, and Mack McGowan entered. 

He did not appear surprised at sight of the crowd, as large audiences had become quite the 

common thing during his boxing lessons. Hank Simpson came 


_
present, dear Jasmine--that is all."  Mrs. Dove had not only lodgers who seemed to worry her from 

morning to night--for, unlike her name, she was always fretting or scolding somebody--but she 

also had a husband, and this husband made his presence felt by every lodger in the house. He 

was often away for a whole week at a time, and then comparative peace reigned in No. 10; but he 

would come back at unexpected moments--he would enter the house, singing out, in a loud 

rasping voice--       "Mrs. Dove,      My only love!"  And then poor Mrs. Dove would get flushed and 

uncomfortable and lose what little self-possession she ever had, and would own in confidence to 

the first floor, or the second floor, or the attics, just as they happened to be present, that Mr. 

Dove's honeyed phrases were only words after all, and meant quite the contrary.  The girls were 

not a week at No. 10, Eden Street, before it became very apparent to them that there was little of 

the real Eden to be found in the place. They kept themselves, however, quite apart from the other 

lodgers; they began to get out their books and their employments, and what with housekeeping, 

and what with cleaning their rooms, and going out for long rambling walks in all directions, they 

were busy from morning to night. Primrose said they would spend a fortnight in the attics, and then 

the education which was by-and-by to lead to bread-winning must commence. Never did three 

more ignorant girls gird themselves for the fray. Primrose had a natural love for painting. She had 

none of the knowledge, none of the grounding, which is essential for real success in all 

departments of art in the present day; but she had a quick and correct eye for color, and all that 

Miss Martineau knew she had imparted to her. Primrose looked in at the shop windows, and saw 

the lovely painted china, and resolved to take lessons in this art. After some little difficulty, and 

after questioning first Mrs. Dove, and finally the much-dreaded Mr. Dove, she was directed to a 

teacher, who promised to instruct her at the rate of three pounds three shillings for twelve lessons. 

Primrose did not know whether her teacher was good or bad, or whether she was paying too much 

or too little--she resolved to take the lessons and to spend some of her little capital in buying the 

necessary materials.  "After I've had my twelve lessons Mr. Jones thinks I may begin to offer some 

of my plates and things for sale; he says he will be very glad to put them up in his own shop 

window. He thinks," continued Primrose with her sweet, grave smile, "that I may be able to recoup 

myself for the expense of learning at the end of a few months."  "And now," said Jasmine, "what 

am I to do? It's all settled for you, Primrose--you will be an artist--and you shall paint a breakfast 

set for our nest in your odd moments, and I'll buy it from you when my ship comes home. Oh! and 

we are both going to be very successful, are we not, darling? and we won't have any trouble at all 

in supporting our pet Daisy and her kitty-cat. You know, Primrose, my gifts lie in the poetic and 

novelistic line. I have really thought of a glowing plot for a story since I came to London, and Mr. 

Dove is to be the ruffian of the piece. I'll introduce Mrs. Dredge and poor Miss Slowcum too, and, 

of course, you'll be the heroine, my beautiful sister. I mean to buy some paper, and work away at 

my novel in the evenings next week; but as we have come up to London expressly to have our 

education perfected, and our gifts developed, don't you think I ought to be having some lessons in 

English style? After all, Primrose, I do not think Mrs. Flint's way of speaking was correct. Arthur 

Noel did not talk in the least like her, nor did dear Mrs. Ellsworthy; and after all, they are a real lady 

and gentleman. I wonder, Primrose, who would teach me proper style. I wish I could meet Arthur 

Noel again, that he might tell me!"  "Oh, Jasmine, it is dreadful of you to speak of a perfect 

stranger by his Christian name! Don't do it, dear--I know it is not right."  "He did not seem the least 



like a stranger," said Jasmine, pushing back her curling locks. "Well, Rose, who is to teach me 

style?--you see, if I am to earn money by my pen I must be polished up. I have got a poem now in 

the back of my head which would exactly suit the ---- _Review_. It's almost exactly on the lines of 

one they published not long ago by Tennyson; but I'd rather not send it until I've had a lesson or 

two from some gifted person here--who shall I go to, Primrose?"  "You must go to a school, of 

course," answered Primrose. "There is a seminary for young ladies just round the corner--we will 

call there this afternoon, and find out if the lady can give you lessons."  Miss Egerton, the principal 

of the seminary in question, opened her eyes a good deal at Jasmine's modest request.  "I don't 

want French, nor German, nor music," quoth the young lady, "but I do want to be helped to make 

very smooth and flowing verses, and I want to have the plots of my novels cut up and criticised--

for I don't mind telling you," continued Jasmine, looking full into Miss Egerton's deeply-lined and 

anxious face, "that I mean to live by my pen. My sister is to be an artist, and I am to be a novelist 

and poet."  Miss Egerton owned to herself afterwards that she had never met such extraordinary 

girls; but then they were so pretty, and so fresh, and the times were hard, and the High Schools 

were carrying off all her pupils, so though she knew little or nothing of making up verses or 

developing plots, she promised to receive Jasmine as a pupil, to direct her reading, and to help 

her to the best of her ability. She was a good and kind-hearted woman, and she made a further 

suggestion.  "What is to become of your little sister while you are both so busy, young ladies?" she 

said.  "Oh, Daisy promises to be very good," said Primrose with a tender smile at the little one. 

"Daisy will stay at home, and take care of the Pink, and she is learning to sew very nicely. When 

Daisy is good and stays quietly at home she helps our plan, and does as much for our cause as 

any of us."  Miss Egerton looked straight into Daisy's eyes. Long ago this dry and hard-looking old 

maid had a little sister like Daisy--a pretty little lass, who went away to play in the heavenly 

gardens many and many a year ago. For the sake of little Constance Miss Egerton felt a great 

kindness welling up in her heart towards Daisy Mainwaring.  "Your little sister must not stay at 

home by herself," she said. "She shall come to me. While I am teaching Miss Jasmine, Daisy can 

play or work as she pleases, only not by herself in your lodgings, young ladies, but in the room 

with her sister."  So it was arranged, and the three girls might fairly have been said to commence 

their work.  When Primrose had gone to Mr. Danesfield and asked him to allow her to draw their 

little capital out of his bank, he had made wonderfully few objections. Of all their friends, he was 

the one who had opposed Primrose's scheme the least, and perhaps for that reason she was 

more willing to take his advice, and to be guided by him, than by either Mrs. Ellsworthy or Miss 

Martineau. Mr. Danesfield had said to her: "My dear, you and your sisters are in some particulars 

in a very unique and unfortunate position. You are all three very young, yet you are absolutely 

your own mistresses. No one in all the world has any real control over you. If you ask me for your 

money, I cannot refuse you--I have absolutely no choice in the matter; the money is yours, and 

when you want it you must have it. Now I tell you plainly that Mrs. Ellsworthy and Miss Martineau 

are dreadfully shocked with your scheme. I may be wrong, but I confess I am not shocked. I fancy 

that you are the kind of girls who will come out victorious, and that though you will have rather a 

hard struggle, you will not be beaten; but there is one thing I am most anxious to do for you, and 

that is to keep part of your money. You have exactly two hundred pounds. How much of this little 

capital do you propose to spend a year?"  "As little as ever we can," answered Primrose.  "Yes, 



my dear young lady, but you must have some sort of idea with regard to your expenses. I would 

counsel you on no account to spend more of your capital than seventy pounds a year; by 

restricting yourselves to this sum you will have a very tiny but certain, income for two years, and 

will have something to fall back on even in the third year, if you are not then earning enough. 

Suppose I divide your seventy pounds into four quarterly instalments, and send it to you as you 

require it. You know nothing of keeping a banking account yourself, and it will absolutely not be 

safe for you to live in London lodgings, and have a large sum of money with you. Take my advice 

in this particular, Miss Primrose, and allow me still to be your banker."  "There is one little 

difficulty," said Primrose; "we really want to be independent, and as we know that there will be 

difficulties and discouragements in the career we are marking out for ourselves, and that we may 

often grow faint-hearted and lonely, Jasmine and I feel that we had better put ourselves quite out 

of the way of temptation. We have, therefore, made up our minds not to give our address to any 

one in Rosebury for at least two years. How can you send us the money, Mr. Danesfield, if you 

don't know where to send it?"  "My dear young lady, I fear you are a little bit too headstrong, and 

though I admire your spirit, I cannot quite approve of your cutting yourselves off from all 

communications with your friends. However, it is not for me to interfere. Will this satisfy you, Miss 

Primrose?--shall I give you my solemn promise only to use the address with which you favor me to 

forward your money each quarter, and never to divulge your secret to anybody else?"  Finally this 

plan was adopted, and Primrose received her small quarterly allowance with great regularity. 

CHAPTER XXII.  CROSS PURPOSES.   After his interview with Jasmine in St. Paul's Cathedral, 

Arthur Noel went home to his very luxurious chambers in Westminster, and wrote the following 

letter to Mrs. Ellsworthy:--  "MY DEAR MOTHER-FRIEND,  "The most curious thing has 

happened. I came accidentally to-day across the three girls about whom you were so interested. I 

met them at St. Paul's, and could not help speaking to the second one. The brightness, and yet 

the melancholy, of her little face attracted my attention. She was not with the rest of her party, but 

sat for some of the time on one of the chairs, and then knelt down and covered her face. Poor little 

soul! I think she was crying. My sympathies were roused by her, and I spoke. She flashed up a 

very bright glance at me, and we became friends on the spot. I took her about the cathedral, and 

showed her one or two objects of interest. She was full of intelligence. Then her sisters joined her, 

and your boy came up, and, of course, his name came out; and there was confusion and 

wondering glances, and the girl whom I had spoken to turned first crimson, and then white, and 

her dark grey eyes became full of tears. 'I know the Ellsworthys; they are my dear, dear friends!' 

she exclaimed.  "I found out where the three lived before I left them. They were accompanied by a 

prim-looking maiden lady, who was introduced to me as a Miss Slowcum, and who appeared to be 

taking excellent care of the pretty creatures. All three are delightful, and I have lost my heart to 

them all.  "Can I do anything for them? Of course you have already told me what perverse 

creatures they are, and Miss Jasmine confirmed your story, only, of course, she put her own 

coloring on it. I pity them, and yet, to a certain extent--forgive me, mother-friend--I admire their 

spirit. That eldest girl had a look about her face which will certainly keep every one from being 

rude to her. Such an expression of innocence and dignity combined I have seldom come across. 

Now, can I help them? It is an extraordinary thing, but I have a wonderful fellow-feeling for them. I 

can never forget the old days when I too was alone in London, and you took me up. Do you 



remember how you met me, and took my thin and dirty hands in yours, and looked into my face 

and said: 'Surely this is a gentleman's son, although he is clothed in rags?' I could just remember 

that I was a gentleman's son, and that I used to put my arms round a beautiful lady's neck and kiss 

her, and call her mother. Between her face and me there was a great horror of darkness, and 

suffering, and ill-usage; and my memories were feeble and dream-like. I don't even now recall 

them more vividly. You took me up, and--you know the rest of my history.  "Well, it is a strange 

thing, but those girls, especially that little Jasmine, brought back the memory of the lady whose 

sweet face I used to kiss. Can I do anything for your girls? There are a thousand ways in which I 

could help them without hurting their proud spirits.       "Yours affectionately,      "ARTHUR NOEL." 

In a very short time Mr. Noel received a brief communication from Mrs. Ellsworthy:--  MY DEAR 

ARTHUR,  "Your letter has been an untold relief. It was a special and good Providence that 

directed your steps to St. Paul's on that afternoon. My dear little Jasmine!--she is my pet of all the 

three. My dear Arthur, pray call on the girls at that dreadful Penelope Mansion; they are so 

naughty and so obstinate that they simply must be caught by guile. You must use your influence to 

get them out of that dreadful place. Look for respectable and nice lodgings, and go beforehand to 

the landlady. If she is very nice, confide in her, and tell her she is to look to me for payment, but 

she is on no account to let out this fact to the girls. Kensington is a nice, quiet, respectable 

neighborhood; you might take the drawing-room floor of a very quiet, nice house, and ask the 

landlady to offer it to the girls for five shillings a week, or something nominal of that sort. Primrose 

is so innocent at present that she will think five shillings quite a large sum; but tell the lady of the 

house to let it include all extras--I mean such as gas and firing. I suppose you could not get a 

house with the electric light?--no, of course not; it is not used yet in private dwellings--gas is so 

unwholesome, but the girls might use candles. Tell the landlady to provide them with the best 

candles, and tell her I'll pay her something handsome if she'll go out with them. And, my dear 

Arthur, _don't_ let them go in omnibuses. Do your best, and, above all things, take them away 

from that awful mansion as soon as possible.       "Your affectionate Mother-Friend,      "KATE 

ELLSWORTHY."  But alas! when Arthur Noel, in accordance with Mrs. Ellsworthy's instructions, 

went to see the girls, he was confronted first by Mrs. Flint, who assured him in her soft and 

cushion-like style that the young ladies had left, and as they had been undutiful enough not to 

confide in her she could furnish him with no address. As he was leaving the mansion Poppy 

Jenkins rushed up to him.  "I heard you asking for my young ladies, sir, but it ain't no use, for 

they're gone. Flowers of beauty they was--beautiful in manner and in face--but they ain't to be 

found here no more. The Mansion didn't suit them, and the people in the Mansion didn't suit them, 

and that isn't to be wondered at. I suppose they has gone to a more congenial place, but the 

address is hid from me; no, sir, I know nothing at all about them. Yes, sir, it's quite true--I misses 

them most bitter!"  Here poor Poppy, covering her face with her hands, burst into tears and 

disappeared down the back staircase.  Noel wrote to Mrs. Ellsworthy, and Mrs. Ellsworthy wrote 

back to him, and between them they made many inquiries, and took many steps, which they felt 

quite sure must lead to discovery, but notwithstanding all their efforts they obtained no clue to the 

whereabouts of the Mainwaring girls.     CHAPTER XXIII.  DARK DAYS.   "How bitterly cold it is, 

Primrose!"  The speaker was Jasmine; she sat huddled up to a small, but bright fire, which burned 

in the sitting-room grate.  The girls had now been several months in Eden Street, and all the 



summer weather and the summer flowers had departed, and the evening in question was a very 

dull and foggy one in late November.  The little sitting-room still wore its rose-tinted paper, but the 

white curtains at the windows had assumed a decided and permanent tint of yellow, and the fog 

found its way in through the badly-fitting attic windows, and made the whole room look cloudy. The 

girls' faces, too, had altered with the months. Jasmine had lost a good deal of her vivacity, her 

expression was slightly fretful, and she no longer looked the spruce and sparkling little lass who 

had gone away from Rosebury in the summer. Primrose had lost the faint color which used to 

tinge her cheeks; they were now almost too white for beauty, but her eyes were still clear, calm, 

and sweet; her dress was still the essence of simplicity and neatness, and her bearing was gentle 

and dignified as of old. The alteration in Daisy was less apparent at this moment, for she was 

stretched on two cushions in one corner of the sitting-room, and with a warm rug thrown over her, 

and with the Pink curled up in her arms, was fast asleep.  "How cold it is, Primrose," repeated 

Jasmine; then, as her sister made no reply, but went on calmly darning some stockings, she 

continued, "I think you have really grown stingy. Why can't we have some more coal? this is much 

too small a fire for weather with snow on the ground, and a horrid, odious fog filling every corner." 

"Hush!" said Primrose, laying down her work, and stooping towards her younger sister, who sat on 

the hearthrug, "I am keeping the coal to put on until Daisy wakes. You know, Jasmine, we 

resolved not to run up any bills, and I cannot get in any coal until Mr. Danesfield sends us our next 

quarter's allowance--wrap my fur cloak round you, darling, and then you will be quite warm." 

Jasmine shivered, but rising slowly, she went into the bedroom, and returned in a moment, not 

with the fur cloak, but with a white woolly shawl. "The day for Mr. Danesfield's money will arrive in 

less than a week," she said. "Oh, Primrose! I thought you were going to be a good manager; I did 

not think you were going to bring us to this."  Primrose smiled.  "Jasmine, dear," she said, "you are 

not quite brave to-night, or you would not speak to me in that tone. You forget that we should not 

have been short of money had not that five-pound note been stolen from us. When Mr. 

Danesfield's allowance comes in we shall be able to go on as usual, and then you need not suffer 

from a short allowance of fire. Jasmine, I know what is the matter with you; you did not eat half 

enough dinner to-day. When I was out this afternoon I called to see Miss Egerton, and she gave 

me three delicious new-laid eggs--really new-laid--we'll have them for supper."  "No, we won't," 

said Jasmine, her eyes suddenly filling with tears, and her pettish mood changing to a tender and 

very sad one--"those eggs were given for Daisy, and no one else shall eat them. Do you know, 

Primrose, that Miss Egerton does not think Daisy at all strong?"  "Oh, she is mistaken," said 

Primrose. "No one who does not know her thinks Daisy strong; she has a fragile look, but it is only 

her look. All my courage would go if I thought Daisy were ill--she is not ill; look at her now, what a 

sweet color she has on her cheeks."  "Miss Egerton says she is like a little sister of her own," 

continued Jasmine. Then she stopped suddenly. "Oh! Primrose, you are not going to cry? oh, 

don't; it would be dreadful if you gave way! No, Primrose, she is not like little Constance Egerton; 

she is just our own Daisy, who never looks strong, but who is very strong--she shall never be cold, 

and she shall have all the nourishment--you and I don't mind how plainly we live, do we, Queen 

Rose?"  Primrose had quickly wiped away her sudden tears. She rose to her feet, and, going up to 

Jasmine, gave her a hasty kiss.  "We'll remember our good old resolution," she said brightly, "not 

to grumble, not to fret, not to cry. Ah! here is our dear little birdie waking from her sleep. Now, 



Jasmine on with the coals, and let us have a merry blaze while I see to the supper--porridge for 

you and me, and a nice fresh egg and a cup of warm milk for the Daisy-flower."  "The Pink must 

have some milk too," said Daisy, as she tumbled lazily out of her soft nest of cushions; "the Pink 

isn't half as fat as she used to be--I can feel all the bones down her spine--I know she wants 

cream. Oh, Primrose! I had such a darling dream--I thought the Prince came and found us!"  "The 

Prince, Daisy?"  "Yes; and he had the look of the gentleman we met long, long, long ago at St. 

Paul's Cathedral! Oh, Primrose, I'm so tired of London!"  "Never mind, darling," answered 

Primrose; "I'm always telling you you are only seeing the shady side at present. Only wait till 

Christmas comes, and Mr. Danesfield sends us our money."  "I wrote another poem last night," 

said Jasmine; "I called it 'The Uses of Adversity.' It was very mournful indeed; it was a sort of story 

in blank verse of people who were cold and hungry, and I mixed up London fogs, and attic rooms, 

and curtains that were once white, and had now turned yellow, and sloppy streets covered with 

snow, with the story. It was really very sad, and I cried a great deal over it. I am looking out now 

for a journal which likes melancholy things to send it to. I have not ventured to submit it to Miss 

Egerton, for she is so dreadfully severe, and I don't think much of her taste. She will never praise 

anything I do unless it is so simple as to be almost babyish. Now 'The Uses of Adversity' is as far 

as possible formed on the model of Milton's 'Paradise Lost'--it is strong, but gloomy. Shall I read it 

to you after supper, Primrose?"  "If you like, dear," answered Primrose; "but why do you try to write 

such very sad things, Jasmine?"  "Oh, I don't know; they suit me. Primrose, do you know of a very, 

very melancholy periodical?"  "Several of the periodicals seem to me rather melancholy," 

answered Primrose; "there is one I sometimes see on Mrs. Dove's table--it is called _The Watch_. 

I glanced at it one day, and I thought it seemed very morbid."  "Oh, I know," answered Jasmine; 

"but there is a worse one than that--Mrs. Dove showed it to me. Mrs. Dove is very fond of reading, 

and she told me that she would not give a farthing for any literature that could not draw forth the 

salt and bitter tear; she says the magazine she likes best at present is a new one called _The 

Downfall_. She says it is very little known, but its melancholy is profound. Shall I send my verses 

to _The Downfall_, Primrose?"  "If you like, dear; but I don't at all admire the name, and I really do 

not think Mrs. Dove ought to be your guide in such matters, Jasmine."  "Oh, she has very good 

taste," answered Jasmine; "she says that only real talent is admitted on the staff of _The 

Downfall_. Of course I'd rather write for one of the shilling magazines. Well, if you like, I'll send my 

poem to one of them first."  Before Primrose could answer Jasmine on this weighty point there 

came a knock on the sitting-room door, and Mrs. Dove, with her face wrapped up in a thick 

woollen shawl, entered the room.  "Very sorry to disturb you, young ladies," she said, "but could 

you oblige me with the loan of three and tenpence-halfpenny. Dove has put in no appearance, and 

unless I can pay three and tenpence-halfpenny on account to the baker he refuses positive to 

allow me sufficient bread to see Sunday through."  When Mrs. Dove made this request Primrose's 

face became intensely pale. She was silent for half a minute, then she said--  "I will lend you the 

money this time, Mrs. Dove, but please don't ask me again; you know that at this present moment 

you owe me very nearly two pounds."  "Thank you, my dear Miss Mainwaring," answered Mrs. 

Dove, in a very suave voice, as she hastily pocketed poor Primrose's few shillings. "You are 

always obliging, and this, with the other trifle due, shall be returned the moment Dove comes in--

Dove is on a very good piece of work just at present, and the money is as safe as safe. Oh, Miss 



Jasmine, I have brought you this week's copy of _The Downfall_--the serial in it is really of the 

most powerful order. I have shed a deluge of tears over it. The lowest person of rank in the pages 

is a marquess; but the story mostly deals in ducal families. It was a and reluctantly tied another 

pair of gloves to the hands of Mr. McGowan.  "What in tarnation is the meaning of this damn 

exhibition?" demanded the Captain, turning to Jud Johnson, the plumber.  "It means there's dirty 

work on."  "You mean there's been a crooked deal put over on Mack?"  The plumber nodded. 

"Who in hell----"  "Swearing ain't going to do no good, Cap'n. The parson don't stand for it down 

here," cut in Jud.  "Whose doing is this?"  "We've got a pretty good idea who the cur is, but we 

ain't exactly sure."  "Where'd he come from?"  "The city."  "Who brung him in here?"  "We ain't just 

sure of that, yet."  "What in h---- What's he cal'lating to do?"  "He figures to lick the tar out of the 

parson. And by the blazes of the inferno, if he does----"  It was plain that civil war was to ensue if 

the contest went against Mr. McGowan.  "How'd he git into such a scrape?"  "It looks like the work 

of that d--I wish the parson would let me swear for once--Sim Hicks."  "You mean Hicks brought 

him in?"  "He come in here more'n a week ago and asked Mr. McGowan to give him some 

lessons. Now the devil's to pay, and if we ain't 'way off Hicks happens to be that devil."  "How----" 

"For God's sake stop asking me questions or I'll cut loose and turn the air blue round here." 

"There ain't a feller living that can fight Mack on a week of training," declared the seaman.  "No 

one said he'd had no more'n a week of training."  "I don't give a tinker's dam if he's had all the 

training in creation, he can't lick Mack McGowan and do it fair."  Jud shot the Captain a look of 

approval. "Them kind don't fight fair."  "But, Jud, I don't see the meaning of it, anyway."  "Then 

you're a heap sight blinder'n I thought. This thing's all fixed up to help Hicks get the parson out of 

town. When the news of this fight gets out into the church, they'll oust him like a shot from a 

cannon."  "Then why don't you fellers stop it afore it starts?" blazed the Captain.  "Stop nothing. 

Hank's tried it, already."  Hank Simpson came across the room to where the Captain stood, 

looking woe-begone.  "The minister says our fears ain't got no foundation about that feller being 

crooked, and he won't listen to reason," declared the dejected Hank.  "By the Almighty, he'll listen 

to me!" exclaimed the Captain.  "He wouldn't listen to his own mother if she was here. He says if 

what we suspect is true, he couldn't show the white feather now. He's the best sport I've ever 

seen, and I hate to see him beat up by that white-livered slugger."  "I sha'n't see it!"  Captain Pott 

started toward the ring that was rapidly forming about the boxers. He caught the minister's glance. 

He halted. In that glance there was an expression which the Captain had come to recognize and 

respect. Mack McGowan was going to take his medicine, or give it, and no one was to interfere 

during the dose. The seaman dropped back into the shadow of the stair.  The boxers faced each 

other. There was no doubt left in the minds of the onlookers as to the profession of the stranger as 

he squared off for action. The minister recognized, too, the trap that had been set for him, but he 

gave no evidence of worry. He met the malicious grin of the other with a friendly, but grim smile. 

The stranger lost no time in preliminaries. He thought himself in full possession of the minister's 

boxing ability, and he showed a great amount of over-confidence. He had studied the other's 

speed, he had spied into his style, he had tested his reach. Certainly, with all this knowledge, he 

should have a picnic. He had been very careful on all occasions to appear as nothing more than a 

novice. He was not unmindful of the other's endurance, but hoping to make a quick end of the 

matter, he tried to force the minister under full headway at once. He went at him in a whirlwind 



rush. It seemed to the observers that Mr. McGowan must certainly be swept from the floor.  But 

the minister was not caught off his guard. He quickly guessed the other's intention. With a 

swiftness that took the breath of the onlookers, he stepped aside, drew in his left toe under his 

right heel, and faced to the right. It was done in a flash! With one long step he swung out to the left 

of his adversary. Out of the range of terrific blows, he smiled and made a closer study of his 

opponent, eye and brain alert for information. It took but a moment, and he was facing the stranger 

before the man was ready to meet him.  The Captain had never seen his young friend box with 

greater ease, although the odds were against him in weight. He warded off blow after blow with a 

precision that was maddening to the other. His foot-work was as quick as that of a cat, and as 

sure. Again and again the stranger would rush in with deadly intent, only to find himself blocked, or 

to back away severely punished.  A breathless suspense hushed all rooting. The minister had 

dropped his guard! Even the other boxer hesitated, as though he could not believe his own eyes. 

Mr. McGowan had thrown back his head and shoulders as though he had partially lost his 

foothold. The city boxer rushed in and swung for the other's heart with all his weight behind the 

blow. When it was too late he saw his mistake. He had been led into a trap, and the very 

movement which had drawn the blow made it ineffective. With lightning-like swiftness the minister 

stepped forward, delivered three blows on his opponent's head with bewildering rapidity, and 

recovered himself with ease and without exertion. The stranger recoiled, and for an instant 

appeared to be under the impulse to run. But blind rage seized him as his unexpected punishment 

began to sting, and he came back like a madman. Mr. McGowan shoved aside or blocked the 

terrific shower of fists with a coolness and precision that drove the stranger momentarily insane. 

He bellowed like a mad bull. He began to slug with the force of a pile-driver without any pretense 

to fairness. He leaped from left to right, and back again, like an orangutan stirred to frenzied 

anger. Mr. McGowan tried to stop him by calling time, but with a foul oath he shot a stiff arm into 

the minister's abdomen. Decidedly jarred, Mr. McGowan swayed back under the impact of the 

foul, but recovered his footing in time to meet the other with a blow full in the face. The stranger 

rushed in again, but Mr. McGowan ducked, landed his glove with a heavy jar on his adversary's 

body, and cut the man's lip with a right swing as he sprang to safety.  The sight and smell of his 

own blood sent the city pugilist into a crazed frenzy. He threw his elbow into the minister's throat 

and hurled him against the wall. Holding him there as though in a vise he landed a wicked hook 

under the left ear. Sim Hicks gave an immoderate laugh. A shout went up from the few who 

favored the stranger. A deep growl was the answer from Hank Simpson and his following as they 

sprang forward. They seized Mr. McGowan, tore him away from the maddened pugilist, and led 

him to a box. Hank steadied him while Jud Johnson massaged the bruised neck and bathed the 

bleeding ear. Sim Hicks crossed to where they were at work.  "Have you got enough?" he asked 

with a sneer.  "No! And by thunder, you ain't got all that's coming to you, neither," growled Jud. 

Mr. McGowan leaned heavily against Hank Simpson. As it was apparent that his mind was 

beginning to clear, Sim Hicks came closer.  "Are you ready to call quits and stop your damned 

meddling in my affairs?" persisted the Innkeeper.  Mr. McGowan shook his head, slowly. Then, 

with a start, he straightened. Between the uprights of the stair-banister he had see two faces 

peering down into the room. As his vision cleared a little more he saw that one face was set 

between silky chops.  Captain Pott had not taken his eyes from the minister's face, but now he 



followed the direction of his startled gaze.  "If it ain't that damned menagerie, Fox and Beaver!" 

One of the two figures slipped up and out. The other, deeply engrossed, did not budge. The 

Captain gave a mirthless chuckle and quietly crept up the stair. He seized the heels of Mr. Beaver, 

dragged him bumping down the stair, and dropped him beneath one of the lights. He gripped the 

little man's collar, glanced menacingly into the distorted face, and remarked:  "Paying off some of 

them infernal debts you spoke of?"  "L-Let m-m-me g-go! L-Looking's f-f-free, ain't it?" His thin 

voice rose with each word till it reached a hissing shriek.  "Yes, the show seems to be free. And if 

I'm any judge, it's just begun, so you may as well come down for it all."  Sim Hicks was swearing 

so loudly that the seaman turned in that direction. The Innkeeper was shaking his fist in the 

minister's face. Captain Pott dragged the squirming Beaver across the room.  "See here, Sim, 

you'd best shet that trap-door of yours, it's letting out too much blue smoke, and the dominee don't 

permit swearing among the boys. Cal'late I can give you some assistance if you're needing it," 

said the seaman, coming uncomfortably near. "As for that there slugger of yourn, he's nothing but 

a white-livered cur of a coward."  "You take back those words, or I'll make you swallow them one 

at a time!"  The threat came from the city pugilist, and the Captain swung about to face him.  "This 

here is my friend you hurt,"--the seaman's eyes flashed with fury as he jerked his thumb toward 

the minister,--"and I cal'late you'd best apologize for what you've done to him."  "Why, you 

doddering old idiot! If you didn't want your little pet hurt, you'd best have kept him home. I 

understand he's your special hobby."  "You'd best apologize," repeated the Captain in dangerous 

calm.  The pugilist laughed hoarsely. "When I do it will be in a hotter place than where we are to-

night. I did nothing----"  "Don't lie to me! I see what you done. Either you fight like a man,--even if 

you ain't one,--or by the lord Harry----"  For emphasis he clutched the collar he still held, and Mr. 

Beaver squirmed as though in fear of being hurled bodily into the face of the city boxer. Sim Hicks 

sprang at the Captain's throat with a fierce leap and an angry growl. But Sim picked himself up 

from a corner and rubbed the blood from his streaming nose. The sight of the cringing Innkeeper 

seemed to have a temporary effect upon the pugilist, but he quickly recovered and bristled 

defiantly.  "You damned city cur! If you don't fight fair I'll measure you out on the same spot!"  "You 

go to the devil!" said the man with a sneer.  "When I do I'll take a white-livered, yellow-haired cur 

along. You take that grin off your face and stand up to Mack like a man. I'll act as pilot from now 

on, and if I sight any more of your dirty tricks, may the Lord have mercy on you, for I won't. Pitch 

in!"  The two men obeyed and faced each other. Except for a slight tightening of the lips, Mr. 

McGowan gave no sign of having suffered from the severe punishment because of the other 

man's foul. Those who had been standing about the box, now jostled the other faction out of the 

ring, and pressed closely about the Captain.  During the next fifteen minutes the boxers worked 

swiftly. Although the stranger had publicly defied the seaman's orders to fight fair, yet it was 

apparent to all that he was obeying them. Only once did he attempt a foul. The Captain's quick 

eyes saw, and with a thundering command that shook the room he checked the pugilist's stiff arm 

movement to the throat. Then the end came. Mr. McGowan brought forward his head and 

shoulders with his usual lightning-like swiftness in order to draw a lead before the other was 

prepared for it, and at the same time he accompanied the movement with a quick jerking back of 

his left hand as though suddenly changing his mind. The city man did the rest. He halted. Mr. 

McGowan stepped to the left just as the other delivered his spent blow, and with the added weight 



of his moving body landed his right glove against the stranger's ear. This was quickly followed with 

a crashing upper-cut to the heavy jaw. There was a loud rending and ripping of splintered wood as 

the big man fell through one of the thin panels of the partition. He slid to the floor and lay 

motionless amidst the wreckage.  Sim Hicks bawled at him to get up and go on with the fight. Mr. 

Beaver squirmed and whined under the tightening grip like a beaten pup. The crowd stood dumb 

with amazement. Few of those present had ever witnessed the effect of a knock-out blow.  Mr. 

McGowan was the first to the side of the prostrate man. He lifted him to his feet, and began 

walking him about. As the stranger regained his senses, he smiled faintly at Hicks' repeated 

requests that the fight be finished.  "How long was I out?" asked the pugilist.  Sim caught the 

savage glare in the Captain's eyes, and reluctantly admitted that it had been over a minute.  "But 

this ain't no regular match!" he shouted.  The pugilist looked in the direction of the Captain as he 

drew away from the minister and steadied himself against an upright.  "I guess we'll have to call it 

regular enough to go by rules," declared the city boxer. "I'm beaten, Hicks."  "I was sorry to do it, 

but there seemed no other way. There was too much at stake to run the risk of losing," said the 

minister. "May I say, sir, that you are a good boxer?"  "Mr. McGowan,"--the stranger extended his 

hand with unaffected cordiality,--"it's great of you to say that after what I tried to do to you. I 

refused to apologize when that old fellow tried to make me, but I do it now. I'm ashamed of the 

way I lost my head. If you'll accept my apology, I'll accept your compliment."  "Gladly!" exclaimed 

the minister.  Beneath the rough exterior of this savage fighter there was the spirit of the true 

sportsman. The two men removed their gloves and gripped bare hands in a warm grasp.  "The 

fact of the matter is, you had me outclassed at every turn. Any man who could do what you have 

done to-night, after I'd thought I'd spied on you long enough to secure the key to all your strong 

points, could make his fortune in the ring. I'm heartily ashamed that I made myself a party to this 

plot to put you out. What your old friend has said is true: I'm a cur and a white-livered coward to 

sneak in on you the way I did."  "See here!" shouted Sim Hicks, abandoning all caution, "ain't you 

going to finish this little job you've been paid for?"  "It is finished, but it wasn't stipulated in the 

contract as to who was going to do the finishing."  "You----"  "Shet that trap of yours, Sim. If you 

don't it's li'ble to get another catch," threatened the Captain.  Hicks eyed the seaman, rubbed his 

swollen nose, and backed away.  Mr. Beaver did a corkscrew dance, and tried in vain to release 

the hold on his collar.  "Cap'n Pott!" exclaimed the surprised minister who noticed for the first time 

that the seaman was holding Mr. Beaver. "What on earth are you doing?"  "Well, this little shrimp 

was mighty interested in the boxing, and I thought he might as well come down for a few lessons 

that he wouldn't forget right off. I cal'lated to give him a few myself."  Mr. Beaver's face was purple. 

His words would probably have been of the same hue had there been any possibility of releasing 

them.  "Let him go, Cap'n, you're strangling him."  "He'd otter be choked, if he's as deep in this 

thing as I think he is. But he ain't in no condition for a lesson to-night, he's a mite too worked up. 

Harry, I'll let you off, but if this here yarn gets out into the church through you or through the rest of 

the menagerie, we'll give you the little lesson I spoke about, and it will stick like glue to your 

anatomy. Now, you run along to Eadie, she'll be missing you, and I'd hate to send you home 

mussed up."  Mr. Beaver ran. With a dart he shot for the stair.  The members of the club escorted 

Mr. McGowan to the Captain's home. As he said good night, Hank Simpson came forward.  "Mr. 

McGowan, the fellers want to know if you'll be one of our members in regular standing."  Mr. 



McGowan expressed his delight, and declared he would like nothing better.  "He's 'lected, fellers!" 

shouted Hank.  A ringing cheer went up from the crowd. The Captain said to Elizabeth the next 

morning, when recounting what had taken place, "I was 'feared that Mack would be mad as hops 

the way them fellers carried on, but he wa'n't, not a mite. He seemed tolerable pleased about it. 

When the fellers asked a lot of foolish questions as to what was the matter with Mr. McGowan, 

and then answered them by saying that he was all right, Mack looked as happy as a school kid." 

Hank once more whispered to the minister. The answer was apparently satisfactory, for the boys 

gave a parting cheer, declaring that they would all be present in church the following Sunday. 

CHAPTER VI   The troublesome microbes, of which Captain Pott had so unmelodiously sung, had 

been driven out into the open, and were now doing a war-dance to a jazz tune. Into the domestic 

life of the Captain there wormed the most subtle microbe of all. Just what to do with it, or how to 

meet it, he did not know. But it continued to bob up at every meal time with a clamorous demand 

for attention.  One Monday evening the two men sat in the minister's study, the clergyman 

wrapped in silence, and the Captain in a cloud of tobacco smoke. The seaman was the first to 

break through his cloud.  "Mack, I'm awful sorry to disturb your meditations, but if they ain't a heap 

sight more entertaining than mine, I cal'late you won't mind to give 'em up for a spell."  "It wouldn't 

be much of a sacrifice, Cap'n," acknowledged Mr. McGowan, laughing. "What is troubling you?" 

"Well, it's this,"--the Captain blew a cloud of smoke,--"this here's slow navigating on land without a 

woman's hand on the wheel. We need some one to set things to rights round here once in a 

while."  Mr. McGowan had been lounging lazily before the open fire, but now rose and stretched 

himself.  "The idea is all right, but how can we put it into effect?"  "I ain't just exactly sure."  "You 

must have something to propose, else you wouldn't have mentioned it."  "There ain't going to be 

no proposing, leastwise not by me."  The minister smiled. "Afraid of the fair sex, Cap'n?"  "No. Just 

wise to 'em."  "Why don't you take the suggestion I made some time ago?"  "Meaning, which?" 

"Have some one come in once a week to clean up."  "It needs something more than a cleaner 

round here. What we want is a cook. I cal'late we'd best ship a general housekeeper."  "A 

housekeeper!" exclaimed Mr. McGowan, suddenly breaking off a wide yawn.  The skipper blew a 

cloud of smoke and watched it thin out into the air above his head.  "And you have just declared 

that you didn't intend to propose. I'm afraid----"  "I ain't interested in your fears, young man. I'm too 

old a sea-dog for any of them new-fangled tricks. But being as you're set on staying here I've 

decided that we'll take a woman aboard to look after the mess and swab decks."  The minister 

became serious. "Is that practical in our present position?"  "Practical in our present position? If it 

ain't, then I'd like to know when in the name of all my ancestors such a thing is practical. Mack----" 

"I mean from the financial point of view. The boxing match seems to have hit the pocketbooks of 

the church members harder than the man from the city hit me. At least, something has given them 

almost total paralysis."  "Who's asking you to consarn yourself with a woman's keep? I ain't, be I?" 

"I hope you don't think that I'd permit you to bring a housekeeper in here for me unless you give 

me the privilege of sharing in the expense."  "Mack, this here place ain't your house. Cal'late I'll do 

about as I please on that p'int."  "If I can't stand the expense with part salary, you certainly can't 

stand it with none," persisted the minister.  "I ain't sartin it would cost anything. Leastwise, it won't 

cost much. I ain't sartin,"--repeated the Captain as though in meditation,--"but I think she'll come." 

"Who?"  "Don't let your cur'osity get away with you, young feller. I ain't promising nothing, but I'm 



just thinking, that's all. How'd you like to cruise round the P'int to-morrow, Mack?"  "You have a 

delightful way of changing the subject when it gets too hot. But I'd certainly like the cruise and the 

air."  "I cal'late I ain't changed no subject. We'll go over Riverhead way. It'll be sort of a vacation 

from all this mess, and give me a chance to see about this puzzling woman question."  With this 

declaration, the Captain retreated into a silence which all of Mr. McGowan's questions failed to 

penetrate. The old man was thinking of Clemmie Pipkin!  Clemmie had been the object of his 

boyhood ardor till the day when his dashing half-brother had kidnapped her affections. But no 

sooner had he won her from the Captain than he disappeared, leaving the faithful Miss Pipkin, 

never to return. She had remained unmarried all these years, in spite of the oft-repeated attempt 

on the part of Captain Pott to rekindle her love. He wondered now, as he sat before the dying fire, 

if her presence in his home would change her attitude toward him. This question wakened anew 

the desire of his youth, and after he had retired it kept sleep from his eyes through the long hours 

of the night. He must have Clemmie Pipkin to take care of his house.  Daylight had barely kindled 

her fires over the eastern waters when the two men boarded the _Jennie P._ Mr. McGowan 

noticed that the Captain took particular pains in cleaning and polishing the few brass trimmings. 

They both worked hard till the sun appeared, and then hastily ate a lunch which they had brought 

aboard with them. After finishing the sandwiches, the Captain went forward and dropped a 

measuring-stick into the gasoline tank.  "I'll swan!" he ejaculated. "There ain't a drop of 'ile in that 

there tank. And I left the cans ashore."  "I'll go for them."  "No, you don't, young feller! You stay 

right aboard here," ordered the skipper. "You can be working on the engine, or something. I'll get 

that 'ile myself."  Surprised at the seaman's earnestness, the minister obeyed. He was working 

over the engine, his hands covered with grease, when the dory scraped the side of the boat. He 

came out of the cockpit, and, to his amazement, saw the Captain assisting two young ladies into 

the _Jennie P._ Each carried a large basket. They were no less surprised than he.  "Why, Mr. 

McGowan!" exclaimed Elizabeth, the color flooding her already rosy cheeks.  "Captain Pott!" cried 

Miss Splinter.  Mr. McGowan said nothing. He folded his hands behind him and looked foolish.  "I 

thought maybe a little company might liven up the trip," observed the seaman, looking like a 

schoolboy who had sprung a surprise on his teacher. "Ain't you going to welcome 'em? You'll find 

their name on the roster, and they brought their grub with 'em."  "This is a very delightful surprise," 

faintly declared the minister.  Elizabeth looked troubled, and her discomfort did not add to the 

minister's ease. She had been anything but cordial since the incident at her home when Mr. Fox 

had taken ill. He had not seen her since the fight. He feared that the interpretation placed on that 

by her father had not bettered his standing.  "I didn't go to bed last night right off, Mack, when I 

said I was going," explained the Captain. "I went out and fixed up this little party for a sort of 

surprise to all hands. I stowed that 'ile in the boat-house on purpose so as I could get ashore 

without too many questions."  "I trust that our going will make no difference."  The minister's 

embarrassment had grown painful. With a hopeless gesture he brought out a pair of black grimy 

hands. "Indeed, it will make a difference, Miss Fox, all the difference in the world. If the Captain 

had kept his engine cleaner I'd have been able to give you a more hearty welcome."  The sight of 

the greasy hands broke the tension, and although Mr. McGowan cordially extended them neither 

young lady offered hers in return.  The cruise was a great success, if we take the Captain's word 

for it, which word was given to Mrs. Beaver on their return to Little River. "Them young folks had 



the time of their lives, and I never see a more likely pair than that little Beth and the minister as 

they stood by the wheel together steering the _Jennie P._ through them rollers. Beth takes to 

water just the same way she takes to everything, with her whole soul."  It was noon when they 

cast anchor in the Riverhead Inlet. The men prepared to go ashore while the girls took out the 

lunches. As the baskets were opened, and bundles untied, Mr. McGowan suggested that they 


_
terrible blow to come down to the baker from the duke's ancestral halls--you read it, Miss Jasmine; 

you'll be very much overcome."     CHAPTER XXIV.  DOVE'S JOKE.   Primrose had always been 

considered a very good manager. Her talents for contriving, for buying, and, in short, for making a 

shilling do the utmost that a shilling was capable of, had been observable from her earliest days. 

In the last years of her mother's life Primrose had been entrusted with the family purse, and the 

shopkeepers at Rosebury had known better than not to offer this bright-looking young lady the 

best that they had at the lowest price. Primrose, therefore, when she came to London, had felt 

pretty confident that the talents which she knew she possessed would stand her in good stead. 

She still hoped to find the cheapest shops and to get the best for her money. She laid her plans 

with accuracy and common sense, she divided the little sum which the three had to live on into 

weekly instalments--she resolved not to go beyond these. But, alas! Primrose had never reckoned 

on a certain grave difficulty which here confronted her. Hitherto her dealings had been with honest 

tradespeople; now it was her misfortune, and her sisters', to get into a house where honesty was 

far from practised. In a thousand little ways Mrs. Dove could pilfer from the girls--she would not for 

the world have acknowledged to herself that she would really steal; oh, no--but she did not 

consider it stealing to use their coal instead of her own--of course, by mistake; she by no means 

considered it stealing when she baked a little joint for them in her oven on Sunday to boil it first, 

and in this way secure a very good soup for various hungry young Doves; she did not consider it 

stealing to so confuse the baker's account that some of the loaves consumed by her children were 

paid for by Primrose; nor did she consider it stealing to add water to the milk with which she 

supplied the Mainwarings; above all things, and on this point she was most emphatic, she thought 

it the reverse of stealing to borrow. Primrose had not been a fortnight in her house before she 

began to ask first for the loan of an odd sixpence, then for half-a-crown, for a shilling here, and two 

shillings there. When she returned the half-crown it was generally done in this fashion--  "Oh, if 

you please, miss, I want to settle my little account. Oh, dear, dear! I was certain I had half-a-crown 

in my purse. Well, to be sure, I forgot that Dove took it with him when he went out to his work this 

morning. Please, Miss Mainwaring, will you accept one and sixpence on account, and we'll settle 

the rest in an hour or two. There, miss, that's quite comfortable."  Yes, the arrangement was 

certainly quite comfortable for Mrs. Dove, who could score out the half-crown debt from her slate, 

and quite stare when Primrose ventured to ask her for the odd shilling still owing.  Still, incredible 

as it may sound, Mrs. Dove considered herself a strictly honest woman. Perhaps, had the girls 

only to deal with her they might have struggled on, badly, it is true, but still after a fashion. But, 

alas and alas! if Mrs. Dove considered herself honest, Mr. Dove did not pretend to lay claim to this 

very excellent quality. Poor Primrose little guessed that that lost five-pound note, which had given 

her such trouble, and which had almost brought gray hairs to her bright yellow head, had been 

really taken by Dove, who had come up to the attics when the girls were away, had quietly taken 

the hinges off Primrose's trunk at the back, had lifted the lid, and had helped himself neatly and 

deftly to that solitary note!  When the girls discovered their loss no one had been more indignant 

than Dove. He had come up himself to speak to them about it, had examined the trunk in their 

presence, had told them that he had a cousin of his own in the detective business whom he would 

put on the scent of the thief, and in the meantime he'd be very pleased, although he was a 

remarkably poor man, to lend the young ladies ten shillings.  Although they would not think of 



accepting his loan, the girls thought that Dove had behaved rather kindly on this occasion, and 

they certainly never in the least suspected it was into his pocket their money had gone.  Without 

being at all, therefore, to blame, poor Primrose found herself, as Christmas approached, and the 

days grew short and cold, with very little money in her make for shore before their appetites 

demanded otherwise.  At the landing the men parted, for the Captain had expressed the desire to 

make his visit alone. He did not tell the minister that his destination was the County Farm for fear 

that he, Mr. McGowan, would not understand that Clemmie Pipkin was the matron, and not an 

inmate.  Captain Pott found Miss Pipkin without difficulty. During the past ten years, he had been a 

frequent visitor at the Farm, and many knew him. He went at once to the bare little reception-room 

and made known his presence. As Miss Pipkin entered a slight tinge crept into the hollow of her 

sallow cheeks. She extended a bony hand.  "I'm real glad to see you, Josiah. It's been a long time 

since you called."  "Howdy, Clemmie. It has been a mite long, but I've been purty busy of late 

trying to keep people out of trouble."  "Then you must have changed a lot."  "You ain't looking 

well," he observed solicitously. "Ain't sick, be you?"  "No," she answered with a deep sigh. "That is, 

I ain't real sick. I ain't been feeling quite myself for a spell, but I reckon it will wear off."  "You'll 

wear off if you don't get out of this place," replied the Captain.  Miss Pipkin was far from being a 

beautiful woman. From all appearances she had never been pretty, or even good-looking. Her 

form had a few too many sharp angles where it should have been curved. Her face was long and 

thin, and now age and worry had dug deeply into the homely features, obliterating the last trace of 

middle life. She always dressed in black, and to-day the Captain saw that her clothes were worn 

and faded. He moved uneasily as his quick eye took in the meaning of these signs.  "I cal'late 

they're working you too hard here, Clemmie," he said tenderly. "You'd best get away for a spell." 

"I'd like to have a rest, but I can't leave. There's no one to take my place."  "Pshaw! There's plenty 

who'd be glad for the place."  "Anyhow, I ain't got no place to go."  "That's what I've come to see 

you about, Clemmie."  Miss Pipkin straightened with cold dignity, and her eyes flashed fires of 

warning.  "Josiah Pott! Be you proposing to me _again_?"  "Now, don't get mad, Clemmie. I ain't 

proposing to you," he explained as calmly as possible. "But as I've said afore----"  "I know what 

you've said, learnt it like a book. And you know what I've said, too. My no means NO."  "I cal'late 

you ain't left no room for me to doubt that. You've made that purty tolerable plain. I reckon we're 

getting too old for that now, anyway. Leastwise, I be," he finished hurriedly, noting a rising color in 

her thin cheeks.  "Huh!" she grunted indignantly. "A body'd think you was the grandfather of 

Methuselah to hear you talk."  "I am getting on purty well, Clemmie."  "Josiah Pott! If you come 

over here to talk that nonsense you can go right back."  "I really come on another matter. I want 

you to come over and keep house for me and another man. We're living on the old place, and it 

ain't what you'd call hum sweet hum for two males to live alone in a big house like mine. Thought 

maybe you wouldn't mind keeping the decks swabbed and the galley full of pervisions if I'd only 

pay you the same as you're getting here. I'd----"  "That will be enough!"  "Thought maybe 'twould." 

"I'll not listen to another word from you!" exclaimed the shocked Miss Pipkin. The expression on 

her face gave the Captain the feeling that he had dived into icy water, and had come up suddenly 

against a hidden beam.  "Two of you! And you want me to do your work! Well, of all the nerve!"  "I 

ain't told you yet who the other feller is," suggested the Captain.  "I don't care if he's an angel from 

heaven. I'd think you'd be ashamed of yourself to come here and speak of such a thing."  "But I 



ain't ashamed, Clemmie. A drowning man is willing to grab the first straw he sees. Listen to me, 

Clemmie," he pleaded, as she turned to leave the room.  "Me listen to you proposing for me to 

come over to Little River and start talk that would ruin the town? Not if I know what Clemmie 

Pipkin's doing."  "I tell you I ain't proposing to you, I'm just asking you. As far as that town goes, a 

few things more for it to talk about can't do her no harm."  Miss Pipkin paused on the threshold to 

give a parting shot, but the Captain spoke first and spiked her guns.  "The other feller happens to 

be the new parson."  Her expression changed. Preachers had long been her specialty at the 


_
allowance would soon be due, but some days before it came she had broken into her last 

sovereign. Still, she had a resource which her sisters had forgotten, and which, luckily for her, 

Dove knew nothing at all about--she still had that letter of Mr. Danesfield's. She had never opened 

it, but she always kept it safely locked up in her trunk. Not for worlds would she yet break the seal-

-no, no, this letter was meant for an hour of great need. Primrose fondly and proudly hoped that 

that dark and dreadful hour would never approach and that, having won success, she and her 

sisters might yet return the letter unopened to its kind donor. In these dark days before Christmas 

she kept up her heart, and worked hard at her china-painting, achieving sufficient success and 

power over her art to enable her to produce some pretty, but, alas! as yet unsaleable articles. Mr. 

Jones, her master, assured her, however, that her goods must ere long find a market, and she 

struggled on bravely.  Perhaps, on the whole, Jasmine was more tried by her present life than her 

sister. Jasmine's was a more highly-strung temperament; she could be more easily depressed and 

more easily elated--hers was the kind of nature which pours forth its sweetest and best in 

sunshine; did the cold blasts of adversity blow too keenly on this rather tropical little flower, then 

no expansion would come to the beautiful blossoms, and the young life would fail to fulfil its 

promise. Jasmine was never meant by nature to be poor; she had been born in Italy, and 

something of the languor and the love of ease and beauty of her birthplace seemed always to 

linger round her. She had talents--under certain conditions she might even have developed 

genius, but in no sense of the word was she hardy; where Primrose could endure, and even 

conquer, Jasmine might die.  The little sister, who was too young to acutely feel any change which 

did not part her from Primrose and Jasmine, was, perhaps, the only one of the three whose spirits 

were on a par with what they were in the old Rosebury days; but although Daisy's little mind 

remained tranquil, and she did not trouble herself about ways and means, nor greatly fret over the 

fact that the skies were leaden, and the attic room foggy, still Daisy also suffered in her rather 

delicate little body. She caught cold in the London fogs, and the cold brought on a cough, and the 

cough produced loss of appetite. The two elder sisters, however, were scarcely as yet uneasy 

about her, and it was only Miss Egerton who saw the likeness to little Constance growing and 

growing in Daisy's sweet face. Thus Christmas drew near, and the girls had not yet found their 

mission in life; they were by no means crushed, however, nor was Primrose tired of repeating what 

she firmly believed, that with the New Year some of the sunshine of London life would be theirs. 

The quarterly  "What was that you said, Josiah?"  "The other feller living with me is the minister at 

the brick church."  "The minister living with you!"  "Yes."  "With you? But you ain't got religion."  "I 

cal'late that's the safest guess you ever made, Clemmie, but just now it's cooking, and not religion, 

that's bothering me."  "Lan' sakes! You ain't trying to cook for the minister, be you?" she asked 

incredulously.  "You put it just right, I'm trying to. I don't know how long he'll be able to stand it, but 

he won't go nowhere else."  "Poor thing!" she exclaimed. "Poor thing!"  "Them's my sentiments, 

too, Clemmie."  "And no doubt he's a frail creature, too, and ought to have the best of care. So 

many of them are that way."  A violent fit of coughing seized the Captain.  "Lan' sakes! Now, 

what's the matter with you? Been going out without your rubbers, I'll warrant. Men are worse than 

babies when left to themselves. I do believe they'd die if the women-folks didn't look after them 

once in a while."  "We sartin would," choked out the Captain. "Do you suppose you can arrange it 

to come over?"  "When do you want me?"  "Right now. To-day. I come special for you."  "I'll go," 



decided Miss Pipkin impulsively. "It's plain as day that it's my duty. I am getting wore out in this 

place. They've been putting the work of three on me, and I ain't got the strength."  "It ain't right, 

Clemmie, for you to be wearing yourself out in this kind of work. God intended you for something 

better. I ain't proposing," he hastily added, lest his bird take the sudden notion to wing her way 

back into the bush.  Miss Pipkin gave him a quick look, and left the room. She very soon returned 

carrying a bundle beneath one arm, and clutching a bulging telescope suit-case in the other hand. 

From one end of the bundle protruded the head of a cat.  "What in tarnation you got in there, 

Clemmie?" asked the seaman, pointing toward the bundle.  "You didn't think I was going to leave 

my Tommy behind to be starved and abused, did you?"  "Hadn't thought about that," meekly 

admitted the Captain, as he took the telescope.  "Have you got a trunk to send over?"  "No."  Miss 

Pipkin breathed a deep sigh of relief as they passed out of the gates. She looked back at the 

weather-beaten old buildings of the County Farm into which ten years of her life had gone. But she 

felt no pang on leaving.  The Captain kept up a constant stream of conversation on the way down 

to the wharf. Suddenly, Miss Pipkin stopped, and suspiciously eyed the seaman.  "Josiah, how are 

we going back?"  "In my _Jennie P._"  "In your what?"  "In my power-boat, the _Jennie P._" 

"Josiah Pott! You know I ain't been aboard a boat for more than twenty year, and I ain't going to 

start out on the thing, whatever-you-call-it!"  It appeared as if the Captain would have to come 

another day, in another sort of vehicle, to carry home his 


_
first of the month. On the first of December this year the welcome letter, with its still more welcome 

enclosure, was duly received. The girls celebrated the event with a little breakfast feast--they ate 

water-cresses, and Primrose and Jasmine had a sardine each to add flavor to their bread and 

butter. Whatever happened, Daisy always had her fresh egg, which she shared with the Pink, for 

the Pink had been brought up daintily, and appreciated the tops of fresh eggs. On this occasion 

Mrs. Dove herself brought up Primrose's letter. Letters came so seldom to the girls that Mrs. Dove 

felt it quite excusable to gaze very hard at the inscription, to study the name of the post town which 

had left its mark on the envelope, and lingering a little in the room, under cover of talking to 

Jasmine, to watch Primrose's face as she opened the cover.  trumps.  "The minister come all the 

way over with me to get you."  "He did?"  "Sartin did."  "Poor thing! He's been treated so 

scandalously that he's willing to do 'most anything. Well, it may be the death of me, but I've got 

this far, and I may as well go on."  Mr. McGowan was waiting for them at the end of the wharf. The 

skipper introduced them with a malicious wink at Miss Pipkin as he indicated the physical strength 

of the minister. Her face flushed as nearly crimson as it had in years. When they finally got into the 

dory she leaned close to the Captain and set his staid old heart palpitating. Mr. McGowan was 

engaged, waving to the girls in the _Jennie P._  "You ain't going to tell him what I said about his 

being delicate, and the like, are you, Josiah?"  He answered with a vigorous shake of the head as 

he leaned back to draw the 


_
Jasmine--"Oh, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dove; no I didn't much care for that new story which is 

begun in _The Downfall_."  Mrs. Dove had a habit of dropping little curtseys when she meant to be 

particularly deferential--she now dropped three in succession, and said in a high-pitched, and 

rather biting voice--  "It isn't to be expected that the opinions of young ladies and of women who 

have gone through their world of experience, and therefore know what's what, should coincide. I 

leave you ladies three to read your refreshing news from absent friends."  Mrs. Dove then turned 

her back, and meekly shutting the door behind her, left the girls to themselves.  "Them attics have 

become rather too uppish for my taste," she said to Dove when she got downstairs. "I took them a 

letter just now, and, my word! they had not eyes nor ears for me, though I toiled up all the weary 

stairs, which my shortness of breath don't agree to. It wasn't the eyes of Miss Pipkin. Did he 

imagine it, or did he see there something more than interest in her own question?  Aboard the 

_Jennie P._ the young ladies took charge of Miss Pipkin, and soon they were chatting 

companionably. The girls had removed the door to the cabin, and laying it from seat to seat, had 

improvised a table. Over it they had spread cloths, and on the cloths were plates piled high with 

good things. The odor of coffee greeted the Captain's nostrils, as he came forward after securing 

the dory.  "Well, I'd like to know! Where in tarnation did you get the stove to b'ile the coffee on?" he 

asked, sniffing the air.  "We brought it with us," replied Elizabeth.  "You fetched a stove in them 

baskets?"  "Certainly. Come and see it."  She drew her old friend toward the cockpit. There stood 

the steaming coffee-pot over an alcohol flame.  "Well, I swan!"  Paper plates were scattered about 

over the improvised table, 


_
even 'Thank you very much, Mrs. Dove,' but all three of them, their eyes was fixed on the letter as 

if they'd eat it. It's my belief, Dove, that they're short of funds, for when I went yesterday to ask for 

the trifling loan of tenpence three-farthings to pay the cobbler for Tommy's boots, Miss Mainwaring 

said, as pretty as you please, but very prim and firm--'I haven't really got the money, Mrs. Dove.' 

Well, well, I've done a deal for those girls--elbow grease I've given them, and thought I've given 

them, and books for the improving of their intellecs I've lent them, and that's all the return I get, 

that when I bring up a letter it isn't even 'Thank you, Mrs. Dove.' What I say is this, Dove, shall I 

give the attics notice to quit?"  "By no manner of means," answered Dove--"you mark my words, 

Mrs. Dove, my only love, that why they were so flurried over the letter just received was because 

there was money in it. Don't you turn away nice, genteel, quiet-spoken young ladies from this 

house. There's most likely a postal order in that letter, and my name ain't Dove if I don't get my 

gleanings from it."  "Oh, fie, Dove! you will have your joke," answered his wife; but she said 

nothing further about giving the Mainwarings notice to quit.     CHAPTER XXV.  DAISY'S 

PROMISE.   Mr. Danesfield always forwarded the girls' allowance in such a way that Primrose 

could easily obtain it--he did not trouble her with cheques or bank notes, but sent a money-order, 

which she could cash at the nearest post-office.  The three went out gleefully that day, and 

obtained their much needed money--then Primrose bought a new pair of boots for Daisy, and 

allowed Jasmine to spend sixpence on scribbling paper. Having obtained this delightful 

possession, Jasmine determined to begin her great work of fiction without a moment's delay; she 

felt that she had listened quite long enough to Miss Egerton's gentle warnings--that she had been 

discouraged sufficiently, and that what she had really to do was to prove the stuff which was in 

her, and to take the world by storm. She hesitated a little as to whether her great work was to 

appear before the world in the form of a novel or a poem. She thought that to produce a second 

"Evangeline" would be a matter of but slight difficulty, but on the whole she was inclined to give the 

world her experience in the fiery and untrammelled words piled high on some, sandwiches on 

others, doughnuts, cream-puffs, and apple tarts on still others. Indeed, not a thing had been left 

out, so far as the Captain could see.  "If this ain't the likeliest meal I ever see, then, I'd like to 

know. I feel right now as if I could eat the whole enduring lot, I'm that hungry," declared the 

skipper.  Elizabeth served, moving about as gracefully as a fawn. Mr. McGowan watched her with 

no attempt to hide his admiration. The one question in his mind all day had been: what did she 

think of him for his part in the affair at the Inn? He decided that he would take advantage of the 

first opportunity to prove to her that no other course had been left open for him.  Dinner over, the 

Captain filled his pipe, and stood in the door of the cabin. He smoked quietly, and watched the 

ladies put the things away. Miss Pipkin was folding the cloths, and on her the seaman's gaze 

came to a rest. Would the old home seem different with her in it?  "Hadn't we better start?"  The 

Captain jumped. "I cal'late I'm getting nervous, jumping like that."  "Or in love?"  "Maybe you're 

right, Mack."  "Honest confession?"  "I ain't confessing nothing. I was referring to your idea that 

we'd best be under way," explained the Captain, with a wry smile.  As he spoke he leaned over the 

engine, and gave it a turn. Tommy, Miss Pipkin's black cat, was mincing contentedly at some 

scraps when the chug-chug of the exhaust shot from the side of the boat. Tommy shot from the 

cockpit. He paused on the upper step, a startled glare in his eyes. He forgot the tempting morsels; 

he forgot his rheumatism; he was bent on flight. And fly he did. With a wild yodeling yell he sprang 



forward. Like a black cyclone he circled the deck. On his fourth time round he caught sight of the 

minister's legs. He and Elizabeth were standing at the wheel, ready to steer the boat out of the 

harbor. To the cat's excited glance the man's legs suggested the beginnings of tree trunks, at the 

top of which there was safety and repose from the spitting demon at the side of the boat. Like a 

flying bat he made the leap. But he had misjudged both the distance and his own rheumatic 

muscles. He landed on the girl, and came to a rest half-way to her shoulder. His claws sank into 

the thick folds of her sweater. Elizabeth released her hold on the wheel, and with a cry fell back 

against 


_
"My theme burns within me," she said to herself. "I won't be kept back by metres or rhymes, or 

numbers of feet, or any of those tiresome rules which Miss Egerton tries to instil into me. Oh, I 

shall be happy over my work! I will forget that we are poor, and forget that we live in attics. I will 

work with Miss Egerton in the daytime, and I will help Primrose in her house-keeping, and take 

Daisy for a walk, but morning and evening I will get into my Palace Beautiful, and write away, and 

forget the sordid cares of life."  The little maid had really a certain amount of genius to guide her, 

and although all her ideas were crude and unpractised, she managed to be happy in the castle 

which she built, and her dark eyes grew bright once more, and her pretty face resumed its 

animated and contented arms lost neither time nor opportunity. With a little persuasion Tommy 

saw his mistake, and dropped to the deck. He took up his interrupted flight, finally coming to an 

uncertain rest somewhere aloft.  Elizabeth looked up, smiled, blushed like a peony, took hold the 

wheel, and gently released herself.  "Oh, thank you! Wasn't it stupid of me to let that old cat 

frighten me so?"  Mr. McGowan declared that he was delighted to have been of service, and his 

emotions began to be very evident to him.  It took considerable coaxing on the part of the Captain,
