to you, is based upon what I have been told     by my grandfather, by John =

trunks of trees. It might be imagined that on ground entirely smooth, and w=
here the eye cannot=20

distinguish the least hill, the river would have formed by the force of its=
 current a channel in a=20

 prove the contrary. The=20

st imperceptible=20

inequalities of the level suffice to produce great sinuosities. Yet below t=

the river enlarges a little, it forms a channel that appears perfectly stra=

side by very tall trees. This part of the river is called Cano Rico. I foun=
