I have, therefore, taken each paper as a separate Section, and have arrange=

ers at one end of a=20

cotton _lungi_ (turban) were passed one on each side of the neck and fasten=
ed in a knot under left=20

angle of jaw. The _lungi_ was then passed around the body under the arms, e=
tc., so as to draw=20

upon the neck and be buried deeply in the swollen flesh. Under the bands th=
e skin was blanched;=20

the tissues above the bands were black and much swollen. Lungs, larynx, and=
 trachea much=20

congested. Heart empty.  11. _Ibid._=E2=80=94Cases of strangulation by stic=

English idioms, the papers are as H. P. B. left them, save as otherwise mar=
ked. In a few cases I=20

have filled in a gap, but any such addition is enclosed within square brack=
ets, so as to be=20

distinguished from the text. In "The Mystery of Buddha" a further difficult=
y arose; some of the=20

Sections had been written four or five times over, each version containing =
some sentences that=20

were not in the others; I have pieced these versions together, taking the f=
ullest as basis, and=20

inserting therein everything added in any other versions. It is, however, w=
ith some hesitation that I=20

have included these Sections in the _Secret Doctrine_. Together with some m=
ost suggestive=20

thought, they contain very numerous errors Mucous membrane of larynx and tr=
achea covered with=20

her own authority, and it will be obvious to any instructed reader that she=
 makes--possibly=20

deliberately--many statements so confused that they are mere blinds, and ot=
her statements--

probably inadvertently--that are nothing more than the exoteric misundersta=
ndings of esoteric=20

truths. The reader must here, as everywhere, use his own judgment, but feel=
ing bound to publish=20

these Sections, I cannot let them go to the public without a warning that m=
uch in them is certainly=20

erroneous. Doubtless, had the author herself issued this book, she would ha=
ve entirely re-written=20

the whole of this division; as it was, it seemed best to give all she had s=
aid in the different copies,=20

and to leave it in its rather blood. Heart, dark fluid blood in both sides,=
 mostly in right. Brain and=20
