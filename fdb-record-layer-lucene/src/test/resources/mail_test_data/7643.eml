"What is?"  "To want to go on travelling with you."  "If you're going to ta=
lk nonsense, I shall go to=20

sleep again."  "No, I don't think I can allow you to go to sleep. I want yo=
u to wake up and face=20

facts."  "Facts?"  "A fact."  "Facts are sometimes very unpleasant."  "I ho=
pe the fact I want you to=20

face isn't exactly that--if it is ... then I'm ... a jolly miserable chap. =
Miss Morton--Meg--you must see=20

how it is with me--you must know that you're dearer to me than anything on =
earth. I think your=20

father tumbled to it--and I don't think he minded ... that I should want yo=
u for my wife."  "My poor=20

little papa would be relieved to think that anyone could...."  "Could what?=
"  "Care for me ... in that=20

way."  "Nonsense! But I'm exceedingly glad to have met your father."  "Why?=
"  "Because I wanted=20

to meet him."  "Again, why?"  "Because he's your father."  "Did you observe=
 that Miss Lotty Trent=20

cut you dead at the Queen's to-day?"  "I did notice it, and, like you, I wo=
nder why."  "I can tell you."=20

"I don't think you'd better bother. Miss Trent's opinion of me really doesn=
't matter----"  "It was=20



because you were with me."  "But what a silly reason--if it is a reason."  =
"Captain Middleton, will=20

you answer a question quite truthfully?"  "I'll try."  "What have you heard=
 about me in connection=20

with the Trents?"  "Not much, and that I don't believe."  "But you must bel=
ieve it, some of it. It may=20

not be so bad--as it might have been--but I put myself entirely in the wron=
g. I deceived Mrs. Trent=20

and I did a thing no girl in her senses ought to have done."  "Look here, M=
eg," said Miles, leaning=20

forward. "I don't want to know anything you don't choose to tell me; but si=
nce you _are_ on the=20

subject--what did happen between you and that ... and Walter Brooke?"  Meg,=
 too, leant forward;=20

the express swayed and lurched. Their faces were very near; their eyes met =
and held each other=20

in a long, searching gaze on the one side and an answering look of absolute=
 candour on the other.=20

"I promised to go away with him, and I went away a few miles, and something=
 came over me that I=20

couldn't go any further, and I broke my promise and ran away. Jan knows it'=
s true, for it was to=20

them I went. But the Trents would never believe it, though Mr. Ross saw Mrs=
. Trent herself, and=20

told her exactly what had happened. And I daresay ... they are quite justif=
ied."  "And how many=20

times have you seen him since?"  "Never till the other day, when he nearly =
ran over William."=20

"And how long ago is it since all this happened?"  "Nearly six years."  "Do=
n't you think it's about=20

time you put it all out of your mind?"  "I had put it out of my mind ... ti=
ll ... you came."  "It didn't=20

make any difference to me."  "I shall never forget that," Meg said, so low =
that the rattle of the train=20

wholly drowned her remark, but it couldn't conceal her smile.  Miles lost h=
is head. He kneeled=20

down plump on the floor of that compartment and took her in his arms and ki=
ssed her.         *       *=20

*       *       *       *       *       *  "All the same, I don't believe I=
 can marry you," she said later.  "Why=20

on earth not?"  "Because I don't think I'm a suitable wife for you."  "Sure=
ly I'm the best judge of=20

that."  "No, you're not a judge at all. You think you're in love with me...=
."  "I'm hanged if I do--I=20

_know_."  "Because you're sorry for me----"  "On the contrary, I'm sorry fo=
r myself. I think you're a=20

hard-hearted ... obstinate ... little...."  Mr. Withells would have been sc=
andalised at the conduct of=20

Miles. He would undoubtedly have described it as both "insanitary and impro=
per."  "Oh, please=20

listen!" Meg gasped. "Perhaps a long time hence ... if you're still of the =
same mind...."  "Anyway,=20

may I tell people?"  "Not a soul. I won't have my Jan worried just now. I'v=
e undertaken those=20

children ... and she's having a bad time with that brother-in-law----"  "I =
say, Meg, what is it about=20

that chap Tancred? I can't stick him.... Is he a bad egg, or what?"  "He is=
...."  "Poor Miss Ross! But=20

why does she have him there?"  "Oh, it's a long story--and here we are at t=
he junction, and I'm not=20

going on first to Amber Guiting--so there!"         *       *       *      =
 *       *  Jan in the pony-cart was=20

waiting outside when Meg came from the little station. Captain Middleton fo=
llowed in her train,=20

laden with parcels like a Father Christmas.  He packed her and the parcels =
in, covered both the=20

ladies with the dust-holland, announced that he had bought a charger, and w=
aited to get into the=20

Manor motor till they had driven out of the station.  They neither of them =
spoke till they had turned=20

into the road. Then Jan quoted softly: "When I go to see my poor little pap=
a, I shall go by train _by=20

myself_."     CHAPTER XXV  A DEMONSTRATION IN FORCE   Hugo was dissatisfied=
. So far,=20

beyond a miserable ten pounds to buy some clothes, he had got no money out =
of Jan; and he was=20

getting bored.  To be sure, he still had most of the ten pounds, for he had=
 gone and ordered=20

everything in the market-town, where the name of Ross was considered safe a=
s the Bank of=20

England. So he hadn't paid for anything.  Then there was that fellow Ledgar=
d--what did he want=20

hanging about, pretending to fish? He was after Jan and her money, that was=
 his game.  But=20



however clear Peter Ledgard's nefarious intentions might be, Hugo confessed=
 his sister-in-law=20

puzzled him. She wasn't nearly as much afraid of him as he had expected. Sh=
e was always gentle=20

and courteous, but under the soft exterior he had occasionally felt a rock =
of determination, that=20

was disconcerting.  He had ceased to harp upon the string of his desolation=
. Somehow Jan=20

contrived to show him that she didn't believe in it, and yet she never said=
 one word to which he=20

could take exception.  It was awkward that his own people were all of them =
so unsympathetic=20

about the children. His father and mother declared themselves to be too old=
 to undertake them=20

unless Hugo could pay liberally for their board and for a thoroughly capabl=
e nurse. Neither of his=20

sisters would entertain the idea at all; and both wrote pointing out that u=
ntil Hugo was able to make=20

a home for them himself, he would be most foolish to interfere with the arr=
angements of a devoted=20

aunt who appeared not only willing but anxious to assume their entire maint=
enance.  He had told=20

his people that his health forced him to relinquish his work in India. His =
brothers-in-law, although=20

they had no idea of the real cause, thought there was something fishy about=
 this, and were=20

unsympathetic.  Peter got at the doctor, and the doctor declared sea-air to=
 be the one thing=20

necessary to insure Hugo's complete restoration to health. Jan happened to =
mention that her=20

brother-in-law's people lived in Guernsey, close to the shore. The doctor s=
aid he couldn't do better=20

than go and stay with them, and that the journey wouldn't hurt him a bit.  =
Still Hugo appeared=20

reluctant to leave Wren's End.  Peter came one day and demanded a business =
talk with him. It=20

was a most unpleasant conversation. Peter declared on Jan's behalf that she=
 was quite ready to=20

help him to some new start in life, but that if it meant a partnership in a=
ny rubber plantation, fruit-

farm, or business of any sort whatsoever, the money required must be paid t=
hrough her lawyer=20

directly into the hands of the planter, farmer, or merchant concerned.  Hug=
o declared such an offer=20

to be an insult. Peter replied that it was a great deal better than he dese=
rved or could expect; and=20

that he, personally, thought Miss Ross very silly to make it; but she did m=
ake it, and attached to its=20

acceptance was a clause to the effect that until he could show he was in a =
position to maintain his=20

family in comfort, he was to give their aunt an undertaking that he would n=
ot interfere with her=20

arrangements for the welfare of the children.  "I see no reason," said Hugo=
, "why you should=20

interfere between my sister-in-law and me, but, of course, any fool could s=
ee what you're after.=20

_You_ want her money, and when you've married her, I suppose my poor childr=
en are to be=20

thrown out into the street, and me too far off to see after them."  "Up to =
now," Peter retorted, "you=20

have shown no particular desire to 'see after' your children. Why are you s=
uch a fool, Tancred?=20

Why don't you thankfully accept Miss Ross's generous offer, and try to make=
 a fresh start?"  "It's=20

no business of yours what I do."  "Certainly not, but your sister-in-law's =
peace and happiness is my=20

business, because I have the greatest admiration, respect and liking for he=
r."  "_Les beaux yeux=20

de sa cassette_," growled Hugo.  "You _are_ an ass," Peter said wearily. "A=
nd you know very little=20

of Miss Ross if you haven't seen by this time ..." Peter stopped.  "Well, g=
o on."  "No," said Peter, "I=20

won't go on, for it's running my horses on a rock. Think it over, that's al=
l. But remember the offer=20

does not remain open indefinitely."  "Well, and if I choose to refuse it an=
d go to law and _take_ my=20

children--what then?"  "No court in England would give you their custody." =
 "Why not?"  "Because=20

you couldn't show means to support them, and we could produce witnesses to =
prove that you are=20

not a fit person to have the custody of children."  "We should see about th=
at."  "Well, think it over.=20

It's your affair, you know." And Peter went away, leaving Hugo to curse and=
 bite his nails in=20



impotent rage. Peter really was far from conciliatory.  Jan needed a fright=
, Hugo decided; that's=20

what she wanted to bring her to heel. And before very long he'd see that sh=
e got it. She shouldn't=20

shelter herself for ever behind that supercilious beast, Ledgard. Hugo was =
quite ready to have=20

been pleasant to Jan and to have met her more than half-way if she was reas=
onable, but since=20

she had chosen to bring Ledgard into it, she should pay. After all, she was=
 only a woman, and you=20

can always frighten a woman if you go the right way about it. It was damned=
 bad luck that Ledgard=20

should have turned up just now. It was Ledgard he'd got to thank that Fay h=
ad made that=20

infamously unjust will by which she left the remnant of her money to her ch=
ildren and not to her=20

husband. Oh yes! he'd a lot to thank Ledgard for. Well, he wouldn't like it=
 when Jan got hurt.=20

Ledgard was odd about women. He couldn't bear to see them worried; he could=
n't bear to see Fay=20

worried, interfered then. A blank, blank, blank interfering chap, Ledgard w=
as. _What Jan needed=20

was a real good scare._  They suggested Guernsey. Well, he'd go to Guernsey=
, and he wouldn't=20

go alone. Hugo thoroughly enjoyed a plot. The twilight world that had been =
so difficult and=20

perplexing to poor Fay had for him a sort of exciting charm. Wren's End had=
 become dreadfully=20

dull. For the first week or two, while he felt so ill, it had been restful.=
 Now its regular hours and=20

ordered tranquillity were getting on his nerves. All those portraits of his=
 wife, too, worried him. He=20

could go into no room where the lovely face, with youth's wistful wonder as=
 to what life held, did=20

not confront him with a reminder that the wife he had left to die in Bombay=
 did not look in the least=20

like that.  There were few things in his life save miscalculation that he r=
egretted. But he did feel=20

uncomfortable when he remembered Fay--so trustful always, so ready to help =
him in any difficulty.=20

People liked her; even women liked her in spite of her good looks, and Hugo=
 had found the world=20

a hard, unfriendly place since her death.  The whole thing was getting on h=
is nerves. It was time to=20

shuffle the cards and have a new deal.  He packed his suit-case which had b=
een so empty when=20

he arrived, and waited for a day when Peter had taken Jan, Meg and the chil=
dren for a motor run=20

to a neighbouring town. He took care to see that Earley was duly busy in th=
e kitchen garden, and=20

the maids safely at the back of the house. Then he carried it to the lodge =
gate himself and waited=20

for a passing tradesman's cart. Fortune favoured him; the butcher came up w=
ith (had Hugo known=20

it) veal cutlets for Hugo's own dinner. Hugo tipped the butcher and asked h=
im to leave the suit-

case at the station to be sent on as carted luggage to its address.  Next m=
orning he learned that=20

Tony was to go with Earley to fetch extra cream from Mr. Burgess' farm.  It=
 was unfortunate that=20

he couldn't get any of Tony's clothes without causing comment. He had tried=
 the day before, but=20

beyond a jersey and two little vests (which happened to be little Fay's), h=
e had been unable to find=20

anything. Well, Jan would be glad enough to send Tony's clothes when he let=
 her know where=20

they were to be sent. Tony had changed a good deal from the silent, solemn =
child he had disliked=20

in India. He was franker and more talkative. Sometimes Hugo felt that the c=
hild wasn't such a bad=20

little chap, after all. But the very evident understanding between Jan and =
Tony filled Hugo with a=20

dull sort of jealousy. He had never tried to win the child, but nevertheles=
s he resented the fact that=20

Tony's attitude to Jan and Meg was one of perfect trust and friendliness. H=
e never looked at them=20

with the strange judging, weighing look that Hugo hated so heartily.  He st=
rolled into the drive and=20

waited. Meg and Jan were busy in the day-nursery, making the little garment=
s that were outgrown=20

so fast. Little Fay was playing on the Wren's lawn and singing to herself: =
     The fox went out one=20

moonlight night,     And he played to the moon to give him light,     For h=
e had a long way to tlot=20



that night     Before he could leach his den-oh.  Hugo listened for a minut=
e. What a clear voice the=20

child had. He would like to have taken little Fay, but already he stood in =
wholesome awe of his=20

daughter. She could use her thoroughly sound lungs for other purposes than =
song, and she hadn't=20

the smallest scruple about drawing universal attention to any grievance. No=
w Tony would never=20

make a scene. Hugo recognised and admired that quality in his queer little =
son. He did not know=20

that Tony already ruled his little life by a categorical imperative of thin=
gs a sahib must not do.  At=20

the drive gate he met Earley carrying the can of cream, with Tony trotting =
by his side.  "I'm going=20

into the village, Tony, and Auntie Jan says you may as well come with me fo=
r company. Will you=20

come?"  Tony looked dubious. Still, he remembered that Auntie Jan had said =
he must try and be=20

kind to poor Daddie, who had been so ill and was so sad.  "All right," he s=
aid with a little sigh, and=20

took the hand Hugo held out.  "He'll be quite safe with me, Earley," Hugo s=
aid with a pleasant=20

smile. "Miss Ross knows I'm going to take him."  Nevertheless Earley went t=
o the back door and=20

asked Hannah to inform her mistress that "Mr. Tancred had taken Mazter Tony=
 along of 'im."=20

Hannah was busy, and serene in her conception of Hugo as the sorrowing wido=
wer, did not think=20

the fact that Tony had gone for a walk with his own father was worth a jour=
ney to the day-nursery.=20

"How would you like a ride down to the junction?" Hugo said. "I believe we =
could just catch a train=20

if we take the omnibus at 'The Green Hart.' I want to make inquiries about =
something for Auntie=20

Jan."  Tony loved trains; he had only been twice to the junction since he c=
ame to Wren's End; it=20

was a fascinating place. Daddie seemed in an agreeable mood this morning. A=
untie Jan would be=20

pleased that he should be nice to him.  It all fell out as if the fates had=
 arranged things for Hugo.=20

They saw very few people in the village; only one old woman accompanied the=
m in the bus; he=20

heard his father ask for a ticket to the junction, and they arrived without=
 incident of any kind.  The=20

junction, however, was busy. There were quite a lot of people, and when Hug=
o went to the ticket-

office he had to stand in a queue of others while Tony waited outside the l=
ong row.  Suddenly=20

Tony began to wonder why his father should go to the ticket-office at all t=
o inquire for a parcel.=20

Tony was observant, and just because everything was so different from thing=
s in India small=20

incidents were impressed upon his mind. If his father was going on anywhere=
 else, he wasn't=20

going; for Peter had promised to take them out in his car again that aftern=
oon. When Hugo=20

reached the window of the ticket-office Tony heard something about Paddingt=
on.  That decided=20

him. Nothing would induce him to go to Paddington.  He pushed his way among=
 the crowd and ran=20

for dear life up the stairs, and over the bridge to the other platform wher=
e the train for Amber=20

Guiting was still waiting, lonely and deserted. He knew that train. It went=
 up and down all day, for=20

Amber Guiting was the terminus. No one was on the platform as he ran along.=
 With the sure=20

instinct of the hunted he passed the carriages with their shut doors. Right=
 at the end was a van=20

with empty milk-cans. He had seen a porter putting them in the moment the t=
rain stopped. Tony=20

darted into the van and crouched down between the milk-cans and the wall. H=
e thought of getting=20

into one of them. The story of Morgiana and the Forty Thieves was clear in =
his mind, for Meg had=20

told it to them the night before. But the cans were so high and narrow he d=
ecided that it was=20

impossible. Someone slammed the door of the van. There came a bump and a ja=
r, and the train=20

moved out onto a siding till it should go back to Amber Guiting when the 1.=
30 from London came=20

in. Tony sat quite still in the dark, stuffy van. His little heart was beat=
ing with hammer strokes=20

against his ribs, but his face expressed nothing but scorn.  Again his fath=
er had lied to him. Again=20



he had said he was going to do one thing when he fully intended to do anoth=
er. The pleasantness,=20

the kindliness, the apparent desire for Tony's society were a cheat. Tony s=
poke rapidly to himself=20

in Hindustani, and by the time he had finished expressing his views Hugo Ta=
ncred hadn't a shred=20

of character left.  He didn't know when the train would go back to Amber Gu=
iting. It might not be till=20

evening. Tony could wait. Some time it would go back, and once in that dear=
, safe place all would=20

be well.  He disliked the sound of Paddington; it had to do with London, he=
 knew. He didn't mind=20

London, but he wasn't going there with his father, and no Meg and no Jan an=
d no little Fay and no=20

kind sahibs who were _real_ sahibs.  He was very hungry, and his eyes grew =
a bit misty as he=20

thought of little Fay consuming scones and milk at the "elevens" Meg was al=
ways so careful they=20

should have.  A new and troubling thought perturbed him. Did Auntie Jan kno=
w he had gone at all?=20

Would she be frightened? Would she get that look on her dear face that he c=
ouldn't bear to see?=20

That Auntie Jan loved them both with her whole heart was now one of the fix=
ed stars in Tony's=20

firmament of beliefs. He began to think that perhaps it would be better for=
 Auntie Jan to give his=20

father some of her twinkly things and let him go away and leave them in pea=
ce; but he dismissed=20

that thought as cowardly and unworthy of a sahib.  Oh, dear! it was very lo=
ng sitting in the dark,=20

scrunched up behind those cans. He must tell himself stories to pass the ti=
me; and he started to=20

relate the interminable legend of Cocky-locky and Henny-Penny who by their =
superior subtlety=20

evaded the snares set for them by Toddy-Loddy the fox. He felt a sort of ki=
nship with those harried=20

fowls. Gradually the constant repetition of the various other birds involve=
d, "Juckie-Puckie,=20

Goosie-Loosie, Turkey-lurkey and Swannie-Lonnie," had a soothing effect, an=
d Tony fell asleep.=20

*       *       *       *       *  Meanwhile Hugo had hunted through every =
corner of the four platforms; he=20

had even gone to look for the Amber Guiting train, but was told it always w=
as moved on to a siding=20

directly it had discharged its passengers.  It was mysterious, it was profo=
undly annoying, but it was=20

not, to Hugo, alarming. He suspected that Peter Ledgard was in some way mix=
ed up in it; that he,=20

himself, had been shadowed and that Peter had stolen Tony in the crowd. In =
his mistrustful wrath=20

he endowed Peter with such abnormal foresight and acumen as he certainly di=
d not possess.  It=20

really was an impossible situation. Hugo could not go about asking porters =
and people for a lost=20

child, or the neighbourhood would be roused. He couldn't go back to Wren's =
End without Tony, or=20

there would be the devil to pay. He even got a porter to look in every carr=
iage of the side-tracked=20

train for a mythical despatch-case, and accompanied him in his search. Natu=
rally they didn't seek=20

a despatch-case in the van.  He had lost his train, but there was another, =
very slow, about three-

quarters of an hour later, and this he decided to take. He would telegraph =
to Jan from London.=20

Somehow he was not in the least concerned about the fate of Tony. Peter and=
 Peter's car had=20

something to do with this mysterious disappearance. He was sure of that.  W=
ell, if this particular=20

deal had failed, he must shuffle the cards and deal again. In any case Jan =
should see that where=20

his children were concerned he was not to be trifled with.  He was sorry, t=
hough, he had bought=20

the half-ticket for Tony, and to ask them to take it back might cause comme=
nt.  As the slow train=20

steamed out from the junction Hugo felt a very ill-used man.         *     =
  *       *       *       *  At eleven=20

o'clock Anne Chitt brought in the tray with two cups of milk and a plate of=
 Hannah's excellent=20

scones.  "Please go into the kitchen garden and ask=20

"  Jan laid her sewing=20

on the table and got up.  "Is Earley in the garden?"  "Yes, miss. I ast Ear=
ley an' 'e says the same=20

as 'Annah. Mr. Tancred 'ave took Master Tony with 'im."  Anne went away, an=
d Jan and Meg, who=20

had stopped her machining to listen, stared at each other across the table.=
  "I suppose they'll be=20

back directly," Jan said uneasily. "I'll go and ask Earley when Hugo took T=
ony."  "He got up to=20

breakfast to-day for the first time," Meg remarked irrelevantly.  Jan went =
out into the Wrens'=20

garden and through Anthony's gate. She fumbled at the catch, for her hands =
trembled.  Earley was=20

picking peas.  "What time did Mr. Tancred take Master Tony?" she asked.  "J=
ust as we got back=20



from fetchin' the cream, miss. I should say as it was about 'alf-past nine.=
 He did meet us at the=20

lodge, and took the young gentleman with 'im for company--'e said so."  "Th=
ank you, Earley," Jan=20

said quietly.  Earley looked at her and over his broad, good-natured face t=
here passed a shade of=20

misgiving. "I did tell Hannah to let you know the minute I cum in, miss."  =
"Thank you," Jan said=20

again; "that's quite right."  "Be you feelin' the 'eat, miss?" Earley asked=
 anxiously. "I don't think as=20

you ought to be out without an 'at."  "No, I expect not. I'll go and get on=
e."  By lunch time there was=20

still no sign of Hugo and Tony; and Jan was certainly as much scared as eve=
n Hugo could have=20

wished.  Meg had been down to the village and discovered that Hugo and Tony=
 had gone by bus=20

to the junction in time for the 10.23.  Peter was playing golf with Squire =
Walcote on a little course=20

he had made in some of his fields. It was impossible to go and hunt for Pet=
er without giving away=20

the whole situation, and Jan was loth to do that.  She and Meg stared at on=
e another in dismayed=20

impotence.  Jan ordered the pony-carriage; she would drive to the junction,=
 leaving a note for=20

Peter at "The Green Hart," but it was only too likely he would lunch with t=
he Walcotes.  "You must=20

eat something," said Meg. "There's a train in at a quarter to two; you'd be=
tter meet that before you=20

go to the junction; the guard might be able to tell you something."  At lun=
ch little Fay wept because=20

there was no Tony.     CHAPTER XXVI  IN WHICH SEVERAL PEOPLE SPEAK THEIR MI=
NDS=20

"After all, you know," Meg said, with intent to comfort, "no great harm can=
 happen to Tony. Hugo=20

will only take the child a little way off, to see what he can get out of yo=
u."  "It's the moral harm to=20

Tony that I mind," Jan answered sadly. "He was getting so happy and trustfu=
l, so much more like=20

other children. I know his father has got him to go away by some ruse, and =
he will be miserable=20

and embittered because he has been cheated again."  "Shall you drive to the=
 junction if you hear=20

nothing at the station?"  "Yes, I think so, though I've little hope of lear=
ning anything there. You see,=20

people come there from three directions. They couldn't possibly notice ever=
ybody as they do at a=20

little station like this."  "Wait," said Meg, "don't go to the junction. Ha=
ve you forgotten Mr. Ledgard=20

was to fetch us all at half-past two? He'll run you over in his car in a qu=
arter the time you'd take to=20

go with Placid, and be some use as well. You'd better come straight back he=
re if you get no news,=20

and I'll keep him till you get back if he turns up first."  By this time th=
e pony-cart was at the door.=20

Meg helped Jan in, kissed her, and whispered, "Cheer up; I feel somehow you=
'll hear something,"=20

and Jan drove off. She found a boy to hold the pony when she reached the st=
ation, and went in.=20

The old porter was waiting for the train, and she asked if he happened to n=
otice her little nephew=20

that morning.  "Yes, miss, I did see 'un along with a holder gentleman unbe=
knownst to me."  Jan=20

walked up and down in an agony of doubt and apprehension.  The train came i=
n. There were but=20

few passengers, and among them was Miles, come down again for the week-end.=
  He greeted Jan=20

with effusion. Had she come to meet anyone, or was it a parcel?  To his ast=
onishment Miss Ross=20

broke from him and rushed at the guard right up at the far end of the train=
.  The guard evidently=20

disclaimed all knowledge of the parcel, for Miles saw him shaking his head =
vigorously.  "Any other=20

luggage, sir?" asked the old porter, lifting out Miles' suit-case.  "Yes, a=
 box of rods in the van."=20

The old porter went to the end of the train near where Jan had been to the =
guard three minutes=20

before.  He opened the van door and nearly tumbled backward in astonishment=
, for right in the=20

doorway, blinking at the light, stood "Miss Rass' young gen'leman."  "Well,=
 I am blessed!"=20

exclaimed the porter, and lifted him out.  Tony was dreadfully dirty. The h=
eat, the dust, the tears he=20

had shed when he woke up with the putting in of luggage at the junction and=
 couldn't understand=20



what had happened to him, all combined to make him about the most miserable=
-looking and=20

disreputable small boy you could imagine. He had left his hat behind the mi=
lk-cans.  Jan had gone=20

out of the station. She had passed Miles blindly, and her face caused that =
young man to whistle=20

softly, just once. Then he dashed after her.  "Your haunt bin askin' for yo=
u," the old porter said to=20

Tony. "'Peared to me she was a bit worried-like."  Tony moved stiffly down =
the little station, the old=20

porter following with Miles' luggage on a truck.  The ticket-collector stoo=
d in the doorway. Tony, of=20

course, had none. "Don't you say nothin'," whispered the old porter. "'Is h=
aunt'll make it good;=20

there's some sort of a misteree."  Tony felt queer and giddy. Jan, already =
in her little pony-trap,=20

had started to drive away. Miles, waiting for his baggage beside his uncle'=
s car, saw the dejected=20

little figure appear in the station entrance.  He let fly a real barrack-sq=
uare bellow after Jan, and=20

she pulled up.  She looked back and saw the reason for Captain Middleton's =
amazing roar.  She=20

swung the indignant Placid round, and in two minutes she was out of the pon=
y-trap and had Tony=20

in her strong arms.  Miles tipped the porter and drove off. He, too, realis=
ed that there was some=20

sort of a "misteree," something painful and unpleasant for Miss Ross, and t=
hat she would probably=20

prefer that no questions were asked.  Whatever mischief could that young To=
ny have been after?=20

And dared Miles call at Wren's End that evening, in the hope of a glimpse o=
f Meg, or would it look=20

inquisitive and ill-bred?  Placid turned a mild, inquiring head to discover=
 the reason for this new=20

delay.  When Jan, after paying Tony's fare back from the junction, had driv=
en away, the old porter,=20

the ticket-collector, and the station-master sat in conclave on the situati=
on. And their unanimous=20

conclusion was summed up by the old porter: "Byes be a mishtiful set of you=
ng varmints, an' it=20

warn't no job for a lone 'ooman to 'ave to bring 'em up."  The lone woman i=
n question held her=20

reins in one hand and her other arm very tightly round the dirty little boy=
 on the seat beside her.=20

As they drove through the village neither of them spoke, but when they reac=
hed the Wren's End=20

Road, Tony burst into tears.  "I _am_ so hungry," he wailed, "and I feel so=
 nasty in my inside."=20

*       *       *       *       *  As Meg was putting him to bed that night=
 she inquired if he had done=20

anything with his green jersey, for she couldn't find it.  "No," Tony answe=
red. "I haven't had it for a=20

long time--it's been too warm."  "It's very odd," said Meg. "It has disappe=
ared, and so have two=20

vests of little Fay's that I put in the nursery ottoman to mend. Where can =
they be? I hate to lose=20

things; it seems so untidy."  "I 'spect," said Tony, thoughtfully, "my Dadd=
ie took them. He'd never=20

leave without takin somefin."         *       *       *       *       *  Th=
ere was a dinner-party at the Manor=20

House. Peter had come down from town for it, and this time he was staying a=
t Wren's End. Lady=20

Penelope and her husband were to dine and sleep at the Manor, likewise Mile=
s, who had come=20

down with Peter; and Lady Pen contrived thoroughly to upset her aunt before=
 dinner, by relating=20

how she had met Miles with Miss Morton and her father in Cheltenham. And po=
or Lady Mary had=20

been hoping that the unfortunate affair would die a natural death. She had =
asked the prettiest girl=20

in the neighbourhood for Miles to take in, and now, looking down the table =
at him, she would have=20

said he was as well-pleased with his neighbour as any young man could be. T=
he Freams were=20

there and Mr. Withells, the pretty girl's mamma and a bride and bridegroom-=
-fourteen in all. A=20

dangerous number to ask, the Squire had declared; one might so easily have =
fallen through. No=20

one did, however, and Peter found himself allotted to Lady Penelope, while =
Jan's fate was the=20

bridegroom. "His wife won't be jealous of Miss Ross, you know," Lady Mary h=
ad said while=20

arranging her couples.  It happened that Peter sat opposite to Jan, and he =
surveyed her across=20



the sweet-peas with considerable satisfaction. He had never seen Jan in wha=
t her niece bluntly=20

called "a nekked dless" before. To-night she wore black, in some soft, film=
y stuff from which her=20

fine arms and shoulders and beautiful neck stood out in challenging whitene=
ss. Her hair, too, had=20

"pretty twinkly things" in it, and she wore a long chain of small but well-=
matched pearls, her=20

father's last gift to her. Yes, Jan was undoubtedly distinguished, and oh, =
thank heaven! she _had_=20

a clean face.  Beautiful Lady Pen was painted to the eyes, and her maid was=
 not quite skilful in=20

blending her complexion rightly with her vivid hair; beautiful hair it was,=
 with a large ripple that was=20

most attractive, but Mr. Withells, sitting on the other side of Lady Pen, d=
ecided that he didn't=20

approve of her. She was flamboyant and daring of speech. She made him nervo=
us. He felt=20

sincerely sorry for Pottinger.  Peter found Lady Pen very amusing, and perh=
aps she rather=20

neglected her other neighbour.  The dinner was excellent and long; and afte=
r it the ladies, when=20

they left the men to smoke, strolled about on the terrace, and Jan found he=
rself side by side with=20

Lady Penelope.  "How's your little friend?" she asked abruptly. "I suppose =
you know my cousin's=20

playin' round?"  Jan was a little taller than Lady Pen, and turned her head=
 slowly to look at her:=20

"I'm afraid I don't quite understand," she said.  "Surely," Lady Pen retort=
ed, "you must have seen."=20

"If you mean that Captain Middleton admires Miss Morton, I believe he does.=
 But you see, to say=20

that anyone is 'playing round' rather reflects on me, because she is in my =
charge."=20

, for close upon nine=20

years."  "And you think well of her?"  "It would be difficult to express ho=
w well."  "You're a good=20

friend, Miss Ross. I had occasion to think so once before--now I'm pretty s=
ure of it. What's the=20

sayin'--'Time tryeth thingummy'?"  "Troth?" Jan suggested.  "That's it. 'Ti=
me tryeth troth.' I never=20

was any good at quotations and things. But now, look here, I'd like to ask =
you somethin' rather=20

particular ..." Lady Pen took Jan's arm and propelled her gently down a sid=
e-walk out of earshot of=20

the others. "Suppose you knew folks--and they weren't exactly friends, but =
pleasant, you know,=20

and all that, and you were aware that they went about sayin' things about a=
 third person who also=20

wasn't exactly a friend, but ... well, likeable; and you believed that what=
 the first lot said gave a=20

wrong impression ... in short, was very damaging--none of it any business o=
f yours, mind--would=20

you feel called upon to do anything?"  The two tall women stopped and faced=
 one another.  The=20

moon shone full on Lady Pen's beautiful painted face, and Jan saw, for the =
first time, that the eyes=20

under the delicately darkened eyebrows were curiously like Miles'.  "It's a=
lways tiresome to=20

interfere in other people's business," said Jan, "but it's not quite fair, =
is it, not to stand up for=20

people if you believe an accusation to be untrue--whether you like them or =
not. You see, it may be=20

such a serious thing for the person implicated."  "I believe you're right,"=
 said Lady Pen, "but oh,=20

lord! what a worry it will be."  Lady Mary called to them to come, for the =
bride was going to sing.=20

The bride's singing was not particularly pleasing, and she was followed by =
Miles, who performed=20

"Drake's Drum," to his aunt's rather uncertain accompaniment, in a voice th=
at shook the walls.=20

Poor Mr. Withells fled out by the window, and sat on the step on his carefu=
lly-folded handkerchief,=20

but even so the cold stones penetrated, and he came in again.  And after "D=
rake's Drum" it was=20

time to go home.  Jan and Peter walked back through the scented night, Pete=
r carrying her=20

slippers in a silk bag, for the sternly economical Meg wouldn't hear of was=
ting good suede slippers=20

at 22s. 6d. a pair by walking half a mile in them, no matter how dry it was=
.  When all the guests=20

had gone, Lady Pen seized Miles by the arm and implored him to take her out=
side for a cigarette.=20

"That little Withells had given her the hump."  Lady Mary said it was bed-t=
ime and the servants=20

wanted to lock up. The Squire and Mr. Pottinger melted away imperceptibly t=
o smoke in peace=20

elsewhere.  Lady Pen, still holding Miles in an iron grip, pulled him over =
to the door, which she=20

shut, led him back, and stood in front of Lady Mary, who was just going to =
ring for the servants to=20

shut the windows.  "Wait a minute, Aunt Mary. I've got somethin' to say, an=
d I want to say it before=20

Miles."  "Oh, don't let us go into all that to-night," Lady Mary implored, =
"if what you have to say has=20

anything to do with what you told me before dinner."  "It has and it hasn't=
. One thing I've decided is=20

that I've got to tell the Trents they are liars; and the other thing is tha=
t, though I disapprove with all=20

my strength of the game Miles is playing, I believe that little girl is squ=
are...."  "You see," Lady Pen=20

went on, turning to Miles, "I've repeated things to Aunt Mary that I heard =
from the Trents lately--but=20

I heard a different story at the time--and though I think you, Miles, are t=
hrowing yourself away, I=20

won't be a party to spreadin' lies. Somethin' that _poudree_ woman with the=
 good skin said to-

night made me feel a swab----"  "I'm glad you've spoken up like this, Pen,"=
 Miles said slowly, "for if=20

you hadn't, we couldn't have been friends any more. I promised Meg I wouldn=
't tell anybody--but=20

I've asked her to marry me ... and though she isn't over keen, I believe I'=
ll get her to do it some=20



day."  "Isn't over keen?" Lady Mary repeated indignantly. "Why, she ought t=
o be down on her=20

knees with joy!"  Miles laughed. "She's not a kneeling sort, Aunt Mary. It'=
s I who'll have to do the=20

kneeling, I can tell you."  Lady Pen was looking straight at her cousin wit=
h the beautiful candid=20

eyes that were so like his own. "Just for curiosity," she said slowly, "I'd=
 dearly like to know if Meg=20

Morton ever said anything to you about me--anything rather confidential--I =
won't be offended, I'd=20

just like to know."  "About you?" Miles echoed in a puzzled voice.  "About =
my appearance, you=20

know--my looks."  "I think she called you good-looking, like everybody else=
, but I don't remember=20

that she was specially enthusiastic. To tell you the honest truth, Pen, we'=
ve had other things to talk=20

about than you."  "Now listen, you two," said Lady Pen. "That little girl i=
s straight. You won't=20

understand, Miles, but Aunt Mary will. Meg Morton knew I was against her--a=
bout you, Miles--

women always know these things. And yet she held her tongue when she could =
have said=20

something true that I'd rather not have talked about. You'll hold your tong=
ue, old chap, and so will=20

Aunt Mary. I've got her hair; got it on this minute. That's why she's such =
a croppy."  Lady Mary sat=20

down on the nearest chair and sighed deeply.  "It's been a real satisfactio=
n to me, this=20

transformation, because I know where it came from."  Miles took his cousin'=
s hand and kissed it.=20

"If somebody had to have it, I'm glad it's you," he said.  "Yes, she's stra=
ight," Lady Pen repeated. "I=20

don't believe there's many girls who would have kept quiet--not when the ma=
n they cared about=20

was being got at. You may ring now, Aunt Mary. I'm through. Good night."   =

*       *       *       *  "Do you realise," said Peter as they turned out =
of the dark Manor drive into the=20

moonlit road, "that I've been here on and off over a month, and that we are=
 now nearly at the end=20

of July?"  "You've only just come to _us_," said Jan. "You can't count the =
time you stayed at 'The=20

Green Hart' as a visit."  "And now I have come ... I'm not quite sure I've =
done wisely, unless...."=20

"Unless what?"  "Unless I can put something through that I came back from I=
ndia to do."  Jan did=20

not answer. They walked on in silence, and Peter looked at the moon.  "I th=
ink," he said, "you've=20

always had a pretty clear idea why I came home from India ... haven't you?"=
  "It was time for your=20

leave," Jan said nervously. "It isn't good to stay out there too long."  "I=
 shouldn't have taken leave=20

this year, though, if it hadn't been for you."  "You've always been kind an=
d helpful to me ... I hope it=20

hasn't been very ... inconvenient."  Peter laughed, and stopped in the midd=
le of the road.  "I'm fond=20

of fencing," he said lightly, "and free play's all very well and pretty; bu=
t I've always thought that the=20

real thing, with the buttons off the foils, must have been a lot more sport=
 than anything we get=20

now."  Again Jan was silent.  "You've fenced with me, Jan," he said slowly,=
 "ever since I turned up=20

that day unexpectedly. Now, I want a straight answer. Do you care at all, o=
r have you only=20

friendship for me? Look at me; tell me the truth."  "It's all so=20

She was pulled in this=20

direction and that, and though she knew she had got to depend on Peter to--=
as she put it--"a=20

dreadful extent," yet she hesitated to saddle him with her decidedly explos=
ive affairs, without a=20

great deal more consideration than he seemed disposed to allow her.  Hugo, =
for the present, was=20

quiet. He was in Guernsey with his people, and beyond a letter in which he =
directly accused Peter=20

Ledgard of abducting Tony when his father was taking him to visit his grand=
parents, Jan had=20

heard nothing.  By Peter's advice she did not answer this letter. But they =
both knew that Hugo was=20

only waiting to make some other and more unpleasant demonstration than the =
last.  "You see,"=20



Jan began again, "I've got so many people to think of. The children and Meg=
 and the house and all=20

the old servants.... You mustn't hustle me, dear."  "Yes, I see all that; b=
ut I've got _you_ to think of,=20

and if we're married and anything happens to me you'll get your pension, an=
d I want you to have=20

that."  "And if anything happened to me, you'd be saddled with the care of =
two little children who've=20

got a thoroughly unsatisfactory father, who can always make life hateful fo=
r them and for you. No,=20

Peter, it wouldn't be fair--we must wait and see how things work out."  "At=
 present," Peter said=20

gloomily, "it looks as if things were working out to a fair bust-up all rou=
nd."  This was on the 30th of=20

July.  Peter went up to London, intending to return on the first to stay ov=
er the Bank Holiday, but=20

he did not come. He wanted to be within easy reach of recalling cablegram. =
 Meg got a wire from=20

Miles on Saturday: "Try to come up for to-morrow and Monday I can't leave t=
own must see you."=20

And half an hour after it, came a note from Squire Walcote, asking her to a=
ccept his escort, as he=20

and Lady Mary were going up to the Grosvenor, and hoped Meg would be their =
guest.  It was=20

during their stay in London that Lady Mary and the Squire got the greatest =
surprise of their whole=20

lives.  Miles, looking bigger than ever in uniform, rushed in and demanded =
an interview with Meg=20

alone in their private room. He showed her a special licence, and ordered, =
rather than requested,=20

that she should marry him at once.  "I can't," she said, "it's no use askin=
g me ... I _can't_."  "Listen;=20

have you any objection to me?"  Meg pulled a little away from him and prete=
nded to look him up=20

and down. "No ... in fact ... I love every bit of you--especially your boot=
s."  "Have you thought how=20

likely it is that I may not come back ... if there's war?"  "Don't!" said M=
eg. "Don't put it into words."=20

"Then why won't you marry me, and let me feel that, whether I'm killed or n=
ot, I've had the thing I=20

wanted most in this world?"  "Dear, I can't help it, but I feel if I marrie=
d you now ... you would never=20

come back ... but if I wait ... if I don't try to grasp this wonderful thin=
g too greedily ... it will come to=20

us both. I _daren't_ marry you, Miles."  "Suppose I'm all smashed up ... I =
couldn't ask you then ...=20

suppose I come back minus an arm or a leg, or blind or something?"  "If the=
 least little bit of you=20

comes back, I'll marry that; not you or anyone else could stop me then."  "=
You'd make it easier all=20

round if you'd marry me now...."  "That's it ... I don't want it to be easi=
er. If I was your wife, how=20

could I go on being nurse to those children?"  "I wouldn't stop you--you co=
uld go back to Miss=20

Ross and do just exactly what you're doing. I agree with you--the children =
are cheery----"  Meg=20

shook her head. "No; if I was your wife, it wouldn't do. As it is ... the n=
ursemaid has got her soldier,=20

and that's as it should be."  "Will you marry me the first leave I get, if =
I live to get any?"  "I'll think=20

about that."  He gave her the ring she had refused before. Such an absurd l=
ittle ring, with its one=20

big sapphire set with diamonds, and "no backing to it," Miles said.  And he=
 gave her a very heavy=20

brass-studded collar for William, and on the plate was engraved her name an=
d address.  "You=20

see," he explained, "Miss Ross would never really have him, and I'd like to=
 think he was your dog.=20

And here's his licence."  Then Miles took her right up in his arms and hugg=
ed her close, and set=20

her gently down and left her.  That night he asked his uncle and a brother-=
officer to witness his=20

will. He had left most of his money among his relations, but twenty thousan=
d pounds he had left to=20

Meg absolutely, in the event of his being killed before they were married. =
 His uncle pointed out=20

that there was nothing said about her possible marriage. "She'll be all the=
 better for a little money=20

of her own if she does marry," Miles said simply. "I don't want her to go m=
ourning all her days, but=20

I do want the capital tied up on her so that he couldn't waste it ... if he=
 was an unfortunate sort of=20

chap over money."  The Squire blew his nose.  "You see," Miles went on, "sh=
e's a queer little=20



thing. If I left her too much, she'd refuse it altogether. Now I trust to y=
ou, Uncle Edward, to see that=20

she takes this."  "I'll do my best, my boy, I'll do my best," said the Squi=
re; "but I hope with all my=20

soul you'll make settlements on her yourself before long."  "So do I, but y=
ou never can tell in war,=20

you know. And we must always remember," Miles added with his broad, cheerfu=
l smile, "there's a=20

good deal of target about me."  Miles wrote to the little Major, a very man=
ly, straightforward letter,=20

telling him what he had done, but swearing him to secrecy as regarded Meg. =
 He also wrote to=20

Jan, and at the end, he said, "I am glad she is to be with you, because you=
 really apreciate her."=20

The one "p" in "appreciate" fairly broke Jan down. It was so like Miles.  M=
eg, white-faced and=20

taciturn, went back to Wren's End on Tuesday night. The Squire and Lady Mar=
y remained in town.=20

In answer to Jan's affectionate inquiries, Meg was brief and business-like.=
 Yes; she had seen=20

Miles several times. He was very busy. No, she did not expect to see him ag=
ain before ... he left.=20

Yes; he was going with the First Army.  Jan asked no more questions, but wa=
s quietly, consistently=20

kind. Meg was adorable with her children and surpassed herself in the telli=
ng of stories.  The First=20

Army left England for Flanders with the silence of a shadow.  But Meg knew =
when it left.  That=20

night, Jan woke about one o'clock, conscious of a queer sound that she coul=
d neither define nor=20

locate.  She sat up in bed to listen, and arrived at the conclusion that it=
 came from the day-nursery,=20

which was below her room.  Tony was sleeping peacefully. Jan put on her dre=
ssing-gown and=20

went downstairs. The nursery door was not shut, and a shaft of light shone =
through it into the dark=20

hall. She pushed it open a little way and looked in.  Meg was sitting at th=
e table, making muslin=20

curtains as if her life depended on it. She wore her nightgown, and over it=
 a queer little Japanese=20

kimono of the green she loved. Her bare feet were pillowed upon William, wh=
o lay snoring=20

peacefully under the table.  Her face was set and absorbed. A grave, almost=
 stern, little face. And=20

her rumpled hair, pushed back from her forehead, gave her the look of a Bot=
ticelli boy angel. It=20

seemed to merge into tongues of flame where the lamplight caught it.  The w=
indow was wide open=20

and the sudden opening of the door caused a draught, though the night was s=
ingularly still.  The=20

lamp flickered.  Meg rested her hand on the handle of the sewing-machine, a=
nd the whirring noise=20

stopped. She saw Jan in the doorway.  "Dear," said Jan gently, standing whe=
re she was, half in=20

and half out of the door, "are you obliged to do this?"  Meg looked at her,=
 and the dumb pain in=20

that look went to Jan's heart.  Jan came towards her and drew the flaming h=
ead against her=20

breast.  "I'm sorry I disturbed you," Meg murmured, "but I was _obliged_ to=
 do something."=20

William stirred at the voices, and turning his head tried to lick the littl=
e bare feet resting on his=20

back.  "Dearest, I really think you should go back to bed."  "Very well," s=
aid Meg meekly. "I'll go=20

now."  "He," Jan continued, "would be very angry if he thought you were mak=
ing curtains in the=20

middle of the night."  "He," Meg retorted, "is absurd--and dear beyond all =
human belief."  "You see,=20

he left you in my charge ... what will he say if--when he comes back--he fi=
nds a haggard Meg with=20

a face like a threepenny-bit that has seen much service?"  "All right, I'm =
coming."  When Meg got=20

back to her room, she went and leaned over little Fay sleeping in the cot b=
eside her bed. Rosy and=20

beautiful, warm and fragrant, the healthy baby brought comfort to Meg's str=
icken heart.  Perhaps--

who knows--the tramp of that silent army sounded in little Fay's ears, for =
she stretched out her=20

dimpled arms and caught Meg round the neck.  "Deah Med!" she sighed, and wa=
s still.  William=20

stood at attention.  Presently Meg knelt down by her bed, and according to =
the established ritual=20

he thrust his head into her encircling arm.  "Pray for your master, William=
," Meg whispered. "Oh,=20



William, pray for your master as you never prayed before."         *       =
*       *       *       *       *       *=20

*  The strange tense days went on in August weather serene and lovely as ha=
d not been seen for=20

years. Young men vanished from the country-side and older men wistfully won=
dered what they=20

could do to help.  Peter came down from Saturday to Monday, telling them th=
at every officer and=20

every civilian serving in India was recalled, but he had not yet learned wh=
en he was to sail.  They=20

were sitting in the wrens' garden with the children.  "Earley's going," Ton=
y said importantly.=20

"Earley!" Jan exclaimed. "Going where?"  "To fight, of course," little Fay =
chimed in.  "Oh, poor dear=20

Earley!" Jan sighed.  "Happy, fortunate Earley," said Peter. "I wish I stoo=
d in his shoes."  Earley=20

joined the Gloucesters because, he said, "he couldn't abear to think of the=
m there Germans comin'=20

anigh Mother and them childring and the ladies; and he'd better go and see =
as they didn't."  Mr.=20

Withells called the men on his place together and told them that every man =
who joined would have=20

his wages paid to his wife, and his wife or his mother, as the case might b=
e, could stop on in her=20

cottage. And Mr. Withells became a special constable, with a badge and a tr=
uncheon. But he=20

worried every soldier that he knew with inquiries as to whether there wasn'=
t a chance for him in=20

_some_ battalion: "I've taken great care of my health," he said. "I do exer=
cises every day after my=20

bath; I'm young-looking for my age, don't you think? And anyway, a bullet m=
ight find me instead of=20

a more useful man."  No one laughed then at Mr. Withells and his exercises.=
  Five days after the=20

declaration of war Jan got a letter from Hugo Tancred. He was in London and=
 was already a=20

private in a rather famous cavalry regiment.  "They didn't ask many questio=
ns," he wrote, "so I=20

hadn't to tell many lies. You see, I can ride well and understand horses.=

Rear-guard  Peter went up to town and two days after came down again to "Th=
e Green Hart" to=20

say good-bye. He had got his marching orders and was to sail in the _Somali=
_ from Southampton.=20

Some fifteen hundred civilians and officers serving in India were sailing b=
y that boat and the=20

_Dongola_.  By every argument he could bring forward he tried to get Jan to=
 marry him before he=20

sailed. Yet just because she wanted to do it so much, she held back. She, t=
oo, she kept telling=20

herself, had her job, and she knew that if she was Peter's wife, nothing, n=
ot even her dear Fay's=20

children, could be of equal importance with Peter.  The children and Meg an=
d the household had=20

by much thinking grown into a sort of Frankenstein's monster of duty.  Her =
attitude was=20

incomprehensible to Peter. It seemed to him to be wrong-headed and absurd, =
and he began to=20

lose patience with her.  On his last morning he sought and found her beside=
 the sun-dial in the=20

wrens' garden.  Meg had taken little Fay to see Lady Mary's Persian kittens=
, but Tony preferred to=20



potter about the garden with the aged man who was trying to replace Earley.=
 William was not=20

allowed to call upon the kittens, as Fatima, their mother, objected to him =
vehemently, and Tony=20

cared to go nowhere if William might not be of the party.  Peter came to Ja=
n and took both her=20

hands and held them.  "It's the last time I shall ask you, my dear. If you =
care enough, we can have=20

these last days together. If you don't I must go, for I can't bear any more=
 of this. Either you love me=20

enough to marry me before I sail or you don't love me at all. Which is it?"=
  "I do love you, you know=20

I do."  "Well, which is it to be?"  "Peter, dear, you must give me more tim=
e. I haven't really faced it=20

all. I can't do anything in such a hurry as that."  Peter looked at her and=
 shook his head.  "You=20

don't know what caring is," he said. "I can't stand any more of this. Do yo=
u see that motto on the=20

sun-dial: 'I bide my time'--I've read it and read it, and I've said it over=
 to myself and waited and=20

hoped to move you. Now I can't wait any more."  He kissed her, dropped her =
hand, and turning=20

from her went out through the iron gate and down the drive. For a moment Ja=
n stood by the sun-

dial as though she, too, were stone.  Then blindly she went up the steps in=
to the empty nursery=20

and sat down on an old sofa far back in the room. She leaned face-downward =
against the=20

cushions, and great, tearing sobs broke from her.  Peter was gone. He would=
 never come back.=20

She had driven him from her. And having done so she realised that he was th=
e one person in the=20

world she could not possibly do without.  Tony's own hen had laid an egg. C=
arrying it very carefully=20

in a cabbage-leaf, he went, accompanied by the faithful William, to show it=
 to Auntie Jan,=20

matter?" he asked=20

anxiously. "And why has Peter gone?"  Jan raised her head; pride and shame =
and self-

consciousness were dead in her: "He's gone," she sobbed. "He won't come bac=

did not attempt to=20
