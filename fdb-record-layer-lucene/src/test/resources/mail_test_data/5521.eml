dracaena marginata it aside in disgust, attributing the whole affair to the crass superstition of the ancients. Truly phenomenal and inexplicable must have been the dullness and credulity of that otherwise highly philosophical and civilized nation as you well know."  "'Tis true," replied D'Artagnan. "Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude."  "In that case it would be quite another thing. Come! let's be merciful to every sinner! Besides, you are right in another dracaena marginata it aside in disgust, attributing the whole affair to the crass superstition of the ancients.

"superstition." As Diogenes explains in his _History_:       The Kaldhi, having made long 

observations on the planets and     knowing better than anyone else the meaning of their motions 

and     their influences, predict to people their futurity. They regard     their doctrine of the _five_ 

great orbs--which they call     interpreters, and we, planets--as the most important. And though 

they allege that it is the _sun_ that furnishes them with most of     the predictions for great 

forthcoming events, yet they worship     more particularly Saturn. Such predictions made to a 

number of     kings, especially to Alexander, Antigonus, Seleucus, Nicanor,     etc., ... have been 

so marvellously realised that people were     struck with admiration.(452)   It follows from the 

above that the declaration made seemed to await a comfortable digestion; D'Artagnan, to be 

preparing his exordium. Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly glance. It 

was Aramis who broke the silence.  "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?" he began.  "I was 

thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly 

to the church, and now that you are an abbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a 

musketeer."  "'Tis true; man, as you know," said Aramis, "is a strange animal, made up of 

contradictions. Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but battles."  "That is apparent in your 

surroundings; you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste. Do you still 

fence well?"  "I--I fence as well as you did in the old time--better still, perhaps; I

Chaldaean Adept--to the effect that all that he means to impart in his work to the profane had been 

told by Saturn to the moon, by the latter to her idol, and by that idol, or teraphim, to himself, the 

scribe--no more implied idolatry than did the practice of the same method by King David. One fails 

to perceive in it, therefore, either an apocrypha or a "fairy- tale." The above-named Chaldaean 

Initiate lived at a period far anterior to that ascribed to Moses, in whose day the Sacred Science of 

the sanctuary was still in a flourishing condition. It began to decline only when such scoffers as 

Lucian had been admitted, and the pearls of the Occult Science had been too often thrown to the 

hungry dogs of criticism and ignorance.      SECTION XXVII. EGYPTIAN MAGIC.   Few of our 

students of Occultism have had the opportunity of examining Egyptian papyri--those living, or 

rather re-arisen witnesses that Magic, good and bad, was practised many thousands of years back 

into the night of time. The use of the papyrus prevailed up to the eighth century of our era, when it 

was given up, and its fabrication fell into disuse. The most curious of the exhumed documents 

were immediately purchased and taken away from the country. Yet there are a number of 

beautifully-preserved papyri at Bulak, Cairo, though do nothing else all day."  "And with whom?" 

"With an excellent master-at-arms that we have here."  "What! here?"  "Yes, here, in this convent, 

my dear fellow. There is everything in a Jesuit convent."  "Then you would have killed Monsieur de 

Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you, instead of at the head of twenty men?" 

"Undoubtedly," said Aramis, "and even at the head of his twenty men, if I could have drawn 

without being recognized."  "God pardon me!" said D'Artagnan to himself, "I believe he has 

become more Gascon than I am!" Then aloud: "Well, my dear Aramis, do you ask me why I came 

to seek you?"  "No, I have not asked you that," said Aramis, with his subtle manner; "but I have 

expected you to tell me."  "Well, I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill 

Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please, prince though he is."  "Hold on! wait!" said Aramis; 

"that is an idea!"  "Of which I invite you to take advantage, my friend. Let us see; with your 

thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons, 

are you rich? Answer frankly."  "I? I am as poor as Job, and were you to search my pockets and 

my boxes I don't believe you would find a hundred pistoles."  "Peste! a hundred pistoles!" said 

D'Artagnan to himself; "he calls

read.(453)  Others--those that have been carried away and may be found in the museums and 

public libraries of Europe--have fared no better. In the days of the Vicomte de Rouge, some 

twenty-five years ago, only a few of them "were two-thirds deciphered;" and among those some 

most interesting legends, inserted parenthetically and for purposes of explaining royal expenses, 

are in the Register of the Sacred Accounts.  This may be verified in the so-called "Harris" and 

Anastasi collections, and in some papyri recently exhumed; one of these gives an account of a 

whole series of magic feats performed before the Pharaohs Ramses II. and III. A curious 

document, the first-mentioned, truly. It is a papyrus of the fifteenth century B.C., written during the 

reign of Ramses V., the last king of the eighteenth dynasty, and is the work of the scribe 

Thoutmes, who notes down some of the events with regard to defaulters occurring on the twelfth 

and thirteenth days of the month of Paophs. The document shows that in those days of "miracles" 

in Egypt the taxpayers were not found among the living alone, but every mummy was included. All 

and everything was taxed; and being as poor as Job! If I had them I should think myself as rich as 

Croesus." Then aloud: "Are you ambitious?"  "As Enceladus."  "Well, my friend, I bring you the 

means of becoming rich, powerful, and free to do whatever you wish."  The shadow of a cloud 

passed over Aramis's face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain; but 

quick as it was, it did not escape D'Artagnan's observation.  "Speak on," said Aramis.  "One 

question first. Do you take any interest in politics?"  A gleam of light shone in Aramis's eyes, as 

brief as the shadow that had passed over his face, but not so brief but that it was seen by 

D'Artagnan.  "No," Aramis replied.  "Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you, 

since for the moment you have no master but God?"  "It is possible."  "Have you, my dear Aramis, 

thought sometimes of those happy, happy, happy days of youth we passed laughing, drinking, and 

fighting each other for play?"  "Certainly, and more than once regretted them; it was indeed a 

glorious time."  "Well, those splendidly wild days may chance to come again; I am commissioned 

to find out my companions and I began by you,

punished "by the priest-exorciser, who deprived it of the liberty of action." Now what was the 

Khou? Simply the astral body, or the aerial simulacrum of the corpse or the mummy--that which in 

China is called the Hauen, and in India the Bhut.  Upon reading this papyrus to-day, an very soul 

of our society."  Aramis bowed, rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment.  "To meddle 

in politics," he exclaimed, in a languid voice, leaning back in his easy-chair. "Ah! dear D'Artagnan! 

see how regularly I live and how easy I am here. We have experienced the
