was it the truck?"  "No; some of the people in the street said it was a dog; a coach-dog running 

and jumping at the heads of the fire-horses. In falling you struck your head against the iron grating 

of a sewer inlet."  "Umph!" said Blount, and the face-wrinkling which was meant to be a sardonic 

smile turned itself into a painful grin. "Shot to death by a dog! Blenkinsop or some of the others 

ought to have run that for a head-line." Then, with a twist of the hot eyeballs: "This isn't my room. 

Where am I?"  "You are in the spare room of our suite. Your father had you brought here so that 

we could take care of you properly. But you mustn't talk too much; it's the doctor's orders."  Blount 

lay for a long time watching her as she passed the needle in and out through the bit of snowy linen 

stretched upon the tiny embroidery-ring. She had fine eyes, he admitted; eyes with the little 

downward curve in brow and lid at the outer corners--the curve of allurement, he had heard it 

called. Also, her hands were shapely and pretty. He recalled the saying that a woman may keep 

her age out of her face, but her hands will betray her. Mrs. Honoria's hands were still young; they 

looked almost as young as Patricia's, he decided. At the comparison he broke over the rule of 

silence.  "Does Patricia know?" he asked.  "Certainly. She has been here nearly all morning. She 

wouldn't let anybody else hold your head while the doctor was sewing it up."  "I know," he 

returned; "that is a part of her--of her special training: first aid to the injured, and all that. They

in France and Switzerland.      6. DOWN THE RHINE;         Or, Young America in Germany.  The 

story from its inception and through the twelve volumes (see _Second Series_), is a bewitching 

one, while the information imparted, concerning the countries of Europe and the isles of the sea, is 

not only correct in every particular, but is told in a captivating style. "Oliver Optic" will continue to 

be the boy's friend, and his pleasant books will continue to be read by thousands of American 

boys. What a fine holiday present either or both series of "Young America Abroad" would be for a 

young friend! It would make a little library highly prized by the recipient, and would not be an 

expensive one.--_Providence Press._      End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Asiatic Breezes,
