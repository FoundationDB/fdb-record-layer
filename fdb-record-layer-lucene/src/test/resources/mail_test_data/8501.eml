philodendron monstera principle, the descent and re-ascent of the Spirit, i=

 into a side street to avoid meeting the prince, and so reached the Saint D=

roof of it is," said D'Artagnan, "that he has philodendron monstera princip=

t is drawn downwards as by spiritual gravitation.  Seeking further for the =
cause of this, the students were checked, H. P. B. giving only a suggestion=

meeting the prince, and so reached the Saint Denis gate.  "Is it true," sai=

Paris?"  "Nothing more certain; and the best proof of it is," said D'Artagn=
an, "that he has _
in a room has the instinct to get out, but cannot because its instinct is n=
ot sufficiently rationalized=20

to take the necessary means; whereas a man at once takes in the situation a=
nd extricates himself.=20

The highest degree of this Kama-Manasic consciousness is the psychic. Thus =
there are seven=20

degrees from the instinctual animal to the rationalized instinctual and psy=
chic.    Manasic=20

Consciousness.   From this plane Manas stretches upwards to Mahat.    Buddh=
ic Consciousness.=20

The plane of Buddhi and the Auric Envelope. From here it goes to the Father=
 in heaven, Atma,=20

and reflects all that is in the Auric Envelope. Five and six therefore cove=
r the planes from the=20

psychic to the divine.    Miscellaneous.   Reason is a thing that oscillate=
s between right and wrong.=20

But Intelligence--Intuition--is higher, it is the clear vision.  To get rid=
 of Kama we must crush out all=20

our material instincts--"crush out matter." The flesh is a thing of habit; =
it will repeat mechanically a=20

good impulse as well as a bad one. It is not the flesh which is always the =
tempter; in nine cases=20

out of ten it is the Lower Manas, which, by its images, leads the flesh int=
o temptation.  The highest=20

Adept begins his Samadhi on the Fourth Solar Plane, but cannot go outside t=
he Solar System.=20

When he begins Samadhi he is on a par with some of the Dhyan Chohans, but h=
e transcends=20

them as he rises to the seventh plane (Nirvana).  The Silent Watcher is on =
the Fourth Kosmic=20

Plane.  The higher Mind directs the Will: the lower turns it into selfish D=
esire.  The head should not=20

be covered in meditation. It is covered in Samadhi.  The Dhyan Chohans are =
passionless, pure=20

and mindless. They have no struggle, no passions to crush.  The Dhyan Choha=
ns are made to=20

pass through the School of Life. "God goes to School."  The best of us in t=
he future will be=20

Manasaputras; the lowest will be Pitris. We are seven intellectual Hierarch=
ies here. This earth=20

becomes the moon of the next earth.  The "Pitris" are the Astral overshadow=
ed by Atma-Buddhi,=20

falling into matter. The "Pudding-bags" had Life and Atma-Buddhi, but no Ma=
nas. They were=20

therefore senseless. The reason for all evolution is the gaining of experie=
nce.  In the Fifth Round=20

all of us will play the part of Pitris. We shall have to go and shoot out o=
ur Chhayas into another=20

humanity, and remain until that humanity is perfected. The Pitris have fini=
shed their office in this=20

Round and have gone into Nirvana; but they will return to do the same offic=
e up to the middle point=20

of the Fifth Round. The Fourth or Kamic Hierarchy of the Pitris becomes the=
 "man of flesh."  The=20

astral body is first in the womb; then comes the germ that fructifies it. I=
t is then clothed with matter,=20

as were the Pitris.  The Chhaya is really the lower Manas, the shadow of th=
e higher Mind. This=20

Chhaya makes the Mayavi Rupa. The Ray clothes itself in the highest degree =
of the Astral Plane.=20

The Mayavi Rupa is composed of the astral body as Upadhi, the guiding intel=
ligence from the=20

heart, the attributes and qualities from the Auric Envelope.  The Auric Env=
elope takes up the light=20

of Atma, and overshadows the coronal, circling round the head.  The Auric F=
luid is a combination=20

of the Life and Will principles, the life and the will being one and the sa=
me in Kosmos. It emanates=20

from the eyes and hands, when directed by the will of the operator.  The Au=
ric Light surrounds all=20

bodies: it is  "Good-day, Monsieur Dulaurier," replied D'Artagnan.  Planche=
t stopped short, staring=20

at D'Artagnan. The first row, seeing their sergeant stop, stopped in their =
turn, and so on to the very=20

last.  "These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous," observed D'Artagnan to P=
orthos and went on his=20

way.  Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette, where pr=
etty Madeleine, the=20

hostess, came to him.  "My dear Mistress Turquaine," said the Gascon, "if y=
ou happen to have any=20

money, lock it up quickly; if you happen to have any jewels, hide them dire=
ctly; if you happen to=20

have any debtors, make them pay you, or any creditors, don't pay them."  "W=
hy, prithee?" asked=20



Madeleine.  "Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Ba=
bylon, of which you=20

have no doubt heard tell."  "And are you going to leave me at such a time?"=
  "This very instant."=20

"And where are you going?"  "Ah, if you could tell me that, you would be do=
ing me a service."  "Ah,=20

me! ah, me!  "Have you any letters for me?" inquired D'Artagnan, wishing to=
 signify to the hostess=20

that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better sp=
are him=20

demonstrations of her grief.  "There's one just arrived," and she handed th=
e letter to D'Artagnan.=20

"From Athos!" cried D'Artagnan, recognizing the handwriting.  "Ah!" said Po=
rthos, "let us hear what=20

he says."  D'Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:  "Dear D'Artag=
nan, dear Du Vallon,=20

my good friends, perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear =
from me. Aramis and I=20

are very unhappy; but God, our courage, and the remembrance of our friendsh=
ip sustain us. Think=20

often of Raoul. I intrust to you certain papers which are at Blois; and in =
two months and a half, if=20

you do not hear of us, take possession of them.  "Embrace, with all your he=
art, the vicomte, for=20

your devoted, friend,  "ATHOS."        "I believe, by Heaven," said D'Artag=
nan, "that I shall embrace=20

him, since he's upon our road; and if he is so unfortunate as to        los=
e our dear Athos, from that=20

very day he becomes my son."  "And I," said Porthos, "shall make him my sol=
e heir."  "Let us see,=20

what more does Athos say?"  "Should you meet on your journey a certain Mons=
ieur Mordaunt,=20

distrust him, in a letter I cannot say more."  "Monsieur Mordaunt!" exclaim=
ed the Gascon,=20

surprised.  "Monsieur Mordaunt! 'tis well," said Porthos, "we shall remembe=
r that; but see, there is=20

a postscript from Aramis."  "So there is," said D'Artagnan, and he read:  "=
We conceal the place=20

where we are, dear friends, knowing your brotherly affection and that you w=
ould come and die with=20

us were we to reveal it."  "Confound it," interrupted Porthos, with an expl=
osion of passion which=20

sent Mousqueton to the other end of the room; "are they in danger of dying?=
"  D'Artagnan=20

continued:  "Athos bequeaths to you Raoul, and I bequeath to you my revenge=
. If by any good luck=20

you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt, tell Porthos to take him=
 into a corner and to=20

wring his neck. I dare not say more in a letter.  "ARAMIS."        "If that=
 is all, it is easily done," said=20

Porthos.  "On the contrary," observed D'Artagnan, with a vexed look; "it wo=
uld be impossible."=20

"How so?"  "It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to joi=
n at Boulogne and with=20

whom we cross to England."  "Well, suppose instead of joining this Monsieur=
 Mordaunt we were to=20

go and join=20


_
them, whether they be animal, vegetable, or mineral. It is the light, _e.g.=
_, seen round magnets.=20

Atma-Buddhi-Manas in man corresponds to the three Logoi in Kosmos. They not=
 only correspond,=20

but each is the radiation from Kosmos to Microcosmos. The third Logos, Maha=
t, becomes Manas=20

in man, Manas being only Mahat individualized, as the sun-rays are individu=
alized in bodies that=20

absorb them. The sun-rays give life, they fertilize what is already there, =
and the individual is=20

formed. Mahat, so to say, fertilizes, and Manas is the result.  Buddhi-Mana=
s is the Kshetrajna.=20

There are seven planes of Mahat, as of all else.    The Human Principles.  =
 Here H. P. B. drew two=20

diagrams, illustrating different ways of representing the human principles.=
 In the first=20

[Illustration]  the two have frightened an army.  "I did think of it, but t=
his letter has neither date nor=20

postmark."  "True," said Porthos. And he began to wander about the room lik=
e a man beside=20

himself, gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard.  As =
to D'Artagnan, he=20

remained standing like a man in consternation, with the deepest affliction =
depicted on his face.=20

"Ah, this is not right; Athos insults us; he wishes to die alone; it is bad=
, bad, bad."  Mousqueton,=20

witnessing this despair, melted into tears in a corner of the room.  "Come,=
" said D'Artagnan, "all=20

this leads to nothing. Let us go on. We will embrace Raoul, and perhaps he =
will have news of=20

Athos."  "Stop--an idea!" cried Porthos; "indeed, my dear D'Artagnan, I don=
't know how you=20

manage, but you are always full of ideas; let us go and embrace Raoul."=20


_
account. Remain five, under the radiation of Atma.  In the second:         =
                       [Illustration]=20

the lower Quaternary is regarded as mere matter, objective illusion, and th=
ere remain Manas and=20

the Auric Egg, the higher Principles being reflected in the Auric Egg. In a=
ll these systems=20

remember  "Woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at thi=
s moment," said=20

Mousqueton to himself; "I wouldn't give a farthing for his life."  They set=
 out. On arriving at the Rue=20

Saint Denis, the friends found a vast concourse of people. It was the Duc d=
e Beaufort, who was=20

coming from the Vendomois and=20
