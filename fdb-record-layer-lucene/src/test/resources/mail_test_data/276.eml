fford the separate biographies, so he went to the libraries to find a compe=
ndium that would authoritatively tell him of all _
waist, which contained a small arsenal of knives and revolvers. He hobbled =
about with a heavy=20

crutch constantly under his left arm, and was certainly a pitiable sight to=
 behold.  He too had joined=20

the caravan after it had quitted Cheyenne, his advent taking place about an=
 hour subsequent to=20

that of Fearless Frank. His name he asserted was Nix--Geoffrey Walsingham N=
ix--and where he=20

came from, and what he sought in the Black Hills, was simply a matter of co=
njecture among the=20

miners, as he refused to talk on the subject of his past, present or future=
.  The train was under the=20

command of an irascible old plainsman who had served out his apprenticeship=
 in the Kansas=20

border war, in the Civil War; his father also brought home an occasional co=
py of _Harper's=20

Weekly_ and of _Harper's Magazine_.  He had seen _Harper's Young People_; t=
he name of=20

Harper and Brothers was on some of his school-books; and he pictured in his=
 mind how wonderful=20

it must be for a man to be associated with publishers of periodicals that o=
ther people read, and=20

books that other folks studied.  The Sunday-school superintendent hencefort=
h became a figure of=20

importance in Edward's eyes; many a morning the boy hastened from home long=
 before the hour=20

for school, and seated himself on the steps of the Elkins house under the p=
retext of waiting for Mr.=20

Elkins's son to go to school, but=20


_
was Charity Joe, which, considering his avaricious disposition, was the wro=
ng handle on the wrong=20

man. Charity was the least of all old Joe's redeeming characteristics; char=
ity was the very thing he=20

did not recognize, yet some wag had facetiously branded him Charity Joe, an=
d the appellation had=20

clung to him ever since. He was well advanced in years, yet withal a good t=
railer and an expert=20

guide, as the success of his many late expeditions into the Black Hills had=
 evidenced.  Those who=20

had heard of Joe's skill as a guide, intrusted themselves in his care, for,=
 while for the secret=20

purpose of seeing Mr. Elkins set forth to engage in the momentous business =
of making books and=20

periodicals.  Edward would look after the superintendent's form until it wa=
s lost to view; then, with=20

a sigh, he would go to school, forgetting all about the Elkins boy whom he =
had told the father he=20

had come to call for!  But what with helping his mother, tending the baker'=
s shop in after-school=20

hours, serving his paper route, plying his street-car trade, and acting as =
social reporter, it soon=20

became evident to Edward that he had not much time to prepare=20


_
trip, Charity Joe's train invariably went through all safe and sound. This =
was partly owing to his=20

acquaintance with various bands of Indians, who were the chief cause of ann=
oyance on the trip.=20

So far we see the train toward the land of gold, without their having seen =
sight or sound of hostile=20

red-skins, and Charity is just chuckling over his usual good luck:  "I tell=
 ye what, fellers, we've hed=20

a fa'r sort uv a shake, so fur, an' no mistake 'bout it. Barrin' thar ain't=
 no Sittin' Bulls layin' in wait fer=20

us, behead yander, in ther mounts, I'm of ther candid opinion we'll get thr=
ough wi'out scrapin' a=20

ha'r."  "I hope so," said Fearless Frank, rolling over on the grass and gaz=
ing at the guide,=20

thoughtfully, "but I doubt it. It seems to me that one hears of more butche=
ring, lately, than there=20

was a month ago--all on account of the influx of ruffianly characters into =
the Black Hills!"  "Not all=20

owing to that, chippy," interposed "General" Nix, as he had immediately bee=
n christened by the=20

miners--"not all owing to that. Thar's them gol danged copper-colored guest=
s uv ther government--

they're kickin' up three pints uv the'r rumpus, more or less--consider'bly =
less of more than more o'=20

less. Take a passel uv them barbarities an' shet 'em up inter a prison for =
three or thirteen yeers,=20

an' ye'd see w'at an impression et'd make, now. Thar'd be siveral less mass=
ycrees a week, an' ye=20

wouldn't see a rufyan onc't a month. W'y, gentlefellows, thar'd nevyar been=
 a ruffian, ef et hedn't=20

been fer ther cussed Injun tribe--not _one!_ Ther infarnal critters ar' the=
r instignators uv more=20

deviltry nor a cat wi' nine tails."  "Yes, we will admit that the reds are =
not of effort, he managed to=20

hold his own in his class, but no more. Instinctively, he felt that he was =
not getting all that he might=20

from his educational opportunities, yet the need for him to add to the fami=
ly income was, if=20

anything, becoming greater.  The idea of leaving school was broached to his=
 mother, but she=20

rebelled.  She told the boy that he was earning something now and helping m=
uch.  Perhaps the=20

tide with the father would turn and he would find the place to which his un=
questioned talents=20

entitled him.  Finally the father did.  He associated himself with the West=
ern Union Telegraph=20

Company as translator, a position for which his easy command of languages a=
dmirably fitted him.=20

Thus, for a time, the strain upon the family exchequer was lessened.  But t=
he American spirit of=20

initiative had entered deep into the soul of Edward Bok.  The brother had l=
eft school a year before,=20

and found a place as messenger in a lawyer's office; and when one evening E=
dward heard his=20

father say that the office boy in his department had left, he asked that he=
 be allowed to leave=20

school, apply for the open position, and get the rest of his education in t=
he great world itself.  It=20

was not easy for the parents to see the younger son leave school at so earl=
y an age, but the=20

earnestness of the boy prevailed.  And so, at the age of twelve, Edward Bok=
 left school, and on=20

Monday, August 7, 1876, he became office boy in the electricians' departmen=
t of the Western=20

Union Telegraph Company at six dollars and twenty-five cents per week.  And=
, as such things will=20

fall out in this curiously strange world, it happened that as Edward drew u=
p his chair for the first=20

time to his desk to=20


_
Fearless Frank, with a quiet smile. "In fact I know of several who are far =
from being angels, myself.=20

There is old Sitting Bull, for instance, and Lone Lion, Rain-in-the-Face, a=
nd Horse-with-the-Red-

Eye, and so forth, and so forth!"  "Exactly. Every one o' 'em's a danged de=
scendant o' ther old=20

Satan, hisself."  [Illustration: Ha! ha! ha! isn't that rich, now? Ha! ha! =
ha! arrest Deadwood Dick if=20

you can!]  "Layin' aside ther Injun subjeck," said Charity Joe, forking int=
o the roasted venison, "I=20

move thet we take up a silent debate on ther pecooliarities uv a deer's hin=
d legs; so heer goes!"=20

He cut out a huge slice with his bowie, sprinkled it over with salt, and be=
gan to devour it by very=20

Boston, exactly twelve hours before, a girl-baby who was destined to become=
 his wife.  Thus at=20

the earliest possible moment after her birth, Edward Bok started to work fo=
r her!     CHAPTER III=20

THE HUNGER FOR SELF-EDUCATION  With school-days ended, the question of self=
-education=20

became an absorbing thought with Edward Bok.  He had mastered a schoolboy's=
 English, but six=20

years of public-school education was hardly a basis on which to build the w=
ork of a lifetime.  He=20

saw each day in his duties as office boy some of the foremost men of the ti=
me.  It was the period=20

of William H. Vanderbilt's ascendancy in Western Union control; and the rai=
lroad millionnaire and=20

his companions were objects of=20
