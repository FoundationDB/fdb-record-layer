atio=20

Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a b=
oy in heart and=20

association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834. He was=
 the son of a=20

clergyman, was graduated at Harvard College in 1852, and at its Divinity Sc=
hool in 1860 and was=20

pastor of the Unitarian Church at Brewster, Mass., in 1862-66.  In the latt=
er year he settled in New=20

York and began drawing public attention to the condition and needs of stree=
t boys. He mingled=20

with them, gained their confidence showed a personal concern in their affai=
rs, and stimulated them=20

to honest and useful living. With his first story he won the hearts of all =
red-blooded boys=20

everywhere, and of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies =
were sold during the=20

author's lifetime.  In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, =
bald-headed man, with=20

cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused all who met him. =
He died at Natick,=20

Mass., July 18, 1899.  Mr. Alger's stories are as popular now as when first=
 published, because=20

they treat of real live boys who were always up and about--just like the bo=
ys found everywhere to-

day. They are pure in tone and inspiring in influence, and many reforms in =
the juvenile life of New=20

York may be traced to them. Among the best known are:  Strong and Steady; S=

UL THE=20

PEDDLER  "Here's your prize packages! Only five cents! Money prize in every=
 package! Walk up,=20

gentlemen, and try your luck!"  The speaker, a boy of fourteen, stood in fr=
ont of the shabby brick=20

building, on Nassau street, which has served for many years as the New York=
 post office. In front=20

of him, as he stood with his back to the building, was a small basket, fill=
ed with ordinary letter=20

envelopes, each labeled "Prize Package."  His attractive announcement, whic=
h, at that time, had=20

also the merit of novelty--for Paul had himself hit upon the idea, and manu=
factured the packages,=20

as we shall hereafter explain--drew around him a miscellaneous crowd, compo=
sed chiefly of boys.=20

"What's in the packages, Johnny?" asked a bootblack, with his box strapped =
to his back.  "Candy,"=20

answered Paul. "Buy one. Only five cents."  "There ain't much candy," answe=
red the bootblack,=20

with a disparaging glance.  "What if there isn't? There's a prize."  "How b=
ig a prize?"  "There's a=20

ten-cent stamp in some of 'em. All have got something in 'em."  Influenced =
by this representation,=20

the bootblack drew out a five-cent piece, and said:  "Pitch one over then. =
I guess I can stand it."=20

An envelope was at once handed him.  "Open it, Johnny," said a newsboy at h=
is side. Twenty=20

curious eyes were fixed upon him as he opened the package. He drew out rath=
er a scanty supply=20

of candy, and then turning to Paul, with a look of indignation, said:  "Whe=
re's the prize? I don't see=20

no prize. Give me back my five cents."  "Give it to me. I'll show you," sai=
d the young merchant.  He=20

thrust in his finger, and drew out a square bit of paper, on which was writ=
ten--One Cent.  "There's=20

your prize," he added, drawing a penny from his pocket.  "It ain't much of =
a prize," said the buyer.=20

"Where's your ten cents?"  "I didn't say I put ten cents into every package=
," answered Paul.  "I'd=20

burst up pretty quick if I did that. Who'll have another package? Only five=
 cents!"  Curiosity and=20

taste for speculation are as prevalent among children as with men, so this =
appeal produced its=20

effect.  "Give me a package," said Teddy O'Brien, a newsboy, stretching out=
 a dirty hand,=20

containing the stipulated sum. He also was watched curiously as he opened t=
he package. He drew=20

out a paper bearing the words--Two Cents.  "Bully for you, Teddy! You've ha=
d better luck than I,"=20

said the bootblack.  The check was duly honored, and Teddy seemed satisfied=
, though the amount=20

of candy he received probably could not have cost over half-a-cent. Still, =
he had drawn twice as=20

large a prize as the first buyer, and that was satisfactory.  "Who'll take =
the next?" asked Paul, in a=20

businesslike manner. "Maybe there's ten cents in this package. That's where=
 you double your=20

money. Walk up, gentlemen. Only five cents!"  Three more responded to this =
invitation, one=20

drawing a prize of two cents, the other two of one cent each. Just then, as=
 it seemed doubtful=20

whether any more would be purchased by those present, a young man, employed=
 in a Wall street=20

house, came out of the post office.  "What have you got here?" he asked, pa=
using.  "Prize=20

packages of candy! Money prize in every package! Only five cents!"  "Give m=
e one, then. I never=20

drew a prize in my life."  The exchange was speedily made.  "I don't see an=
y prize," he said,=20

opening it.  "It's on a bit of paper, mister," said Teddy, nearly as much i=
nterested as if it had been=20

his own purchase.  "Oh, yes, I see. Well, I'm in luck. Ten cents!"  "Ten ce=
nts!" exclaimed several of=20

the less fortunate buyers, with a shade of envy.  "Here's your prize, miste=
r," said Paul, drawing out=20

a ten-cent stamp from his vest pocket.  "Well, Johnny, you do things on the=
 square, that's a fact.=20



Just keep the ten cents, and give me two more packages."  This Paul did wit=
h alacrity; but the Wall=20

street clerk's luck was at an end. He got two prizes of a penny each.  "Wel=
l," he said, "I'm not=20

much out of pocket. I've bought three packages, and it's only cost me three=
 cents."  The ten-cent=20

prize produced a favorable effect on the business of the young peddler. Fiv=
e more packages were=20

bought, and the contents eagerly inspected; but no other large prize appear=
ed. Two cents was the=20

maximum prize drawn. Their curiosity being satisfied, the crowd dispersed; =
but it was not long the=20

world; never a more homesick, lonely, and complaining set.  But good nature=
 predominated, and=20

the smile was always upper-most, even when the moment looked the blackest, =
the privations were=20

worst, and the longing for home the deepest.  Bok had been talking to a boy=
 who lived near his=20

own home, who was on his way to the front and "over the top" in the Argonne=
 mess.  Three days=20

afterward, at a hospital base where a hospital train was just discharging i=
ts load of wounded, Bok=20

walked among the boys as they lay on their stretchers on the railroad platf=
orm waiting for bearers=20

to carry them into the huts.  As he approached one stretcher, a cheery voic=
e called, "Hello, Mr.=20

Bok.  Here I am again."  It was the boy he had left just seventy-two hours =
before hearty and well.=20

"Well, my boy, you weren't in it long, were you?"  "No, sir," answered the =
boy; "Fritzie sure got me=20

first thing.  Hadn't gone a hundred yards over the top.  Got a cigarette?" =
(the invariable question).=20

Bok handed a cigarette to the boy, who then said: "Mind sticking it in my m=
outh?"  Bok did so and=20

then offered him a light; the boy continued, all with his wonderful smile: =
"If you don't mind, would=20

you just light it?  You see, Fritzie kept both of my hooks as souvenirs."  =
With both arms amputated,=20

the boy could still jest and smile!  It was the same boy who on his hospita=
l cot the next day said:=20

"Don't you think you could do something for the chap next to me, there on m=
y left?  He's really=20

suffering: cried like hell all last night.  It would be a God-send if you c=
ould get Doc to do=20

something."  A promise was given that the surgeon should be seen at once, b=
ut the boy was=20

asked: "How about you?"  "Oh," came the cheerful answer, "I'm all right.  I=
 haven't anything to hurt.=20

My wounded members are gone--just plain gone.  But that chap has got someth=
ing--he got the=20

real thing!"  What was the real thing according to such a boy's idea?  Bok =
had had enough of war=20

in all its aspects; he felt a sigh of relief when, a few days thereafter, h=
e boarded _The Empress of=20

Asia_ for home, after a ten-weeks' absence.  He hoped never again to see, a=
t first hand, what war=20

meant!     CHAPTER XX  THE THIRD PERIOD  On the voyage home, Edward Bok dec=
ided that,=20

now the war was over, he would ask his company to release him from the edit=
orship of _The=20

Ladies' Home Journal_.  His original plan had been to retire at the end of =
a quarter of a century of=20

editorship, when in his fiftieth year.  He was, therefore, six years behind=
 his schedule.  In October,=20

1919, he would reach his thirtieth anniversary as editor, and he fixed upon=
 this as an appropriate=20

time for the relinquishment of his duties.  He felt he had carried out the =
conditions under which the=20

editorship of the magazine had been transferred to him by Mrs. Curtis, that=
 he had brought them to=20

fruition, and that any further carrying on of the periodical by him would b=
e of a supplementary=20

character.  He had, too, realized his hope of helping to create a national =
institution of service to the=20

American woman, and he felt that his part in the work was done.  He conside=
red carefully where=20

he would leave an institution which the public had so thoroughly associated=
 with his personality,=20

and he felt that at no point in its history could he so safely transfer it =
to other hands.  The position=20

of the magazine in the public estimation was unquestioned; it had never bee=
n so strong.  Its=20

circulation not only had outstripped that of any other monthly periodical, =
but it was still growing so=20



rapidly that it was only a question of a few months when it would reach the=
 almost incredible mark=20

of two million copies per month. With its advertising patronage exceeding t=
hat of any other=20

monthly, the periodical had become, probably, the most valuable and profita=
ble piece of magazine=20

property in the world.  The time might never come again when all conditions=
 would be equally=20

favorable to a change of editorship.  The position of the magazine was so t=
horoughly assured that=20

its progress could hardly be affected by the retirement of one editor, and =
the accession of another.=20

There was a competent editorial staff, the members of which had been with t=
he periodical from ten=20

to thirty years each.  This staff had been a very large factor in the succe=
ss of the magazine.  While=20

Bok had furnished the initiative and supplied the directing power, a large =
part of the editorial=20

success of the magazine was due to the staff.  It could carry on the magazi=
ne without his=20

guidance.  Moreover, Bok wished to say good-by to his public before it deci=
ded, for some reason=20

or other, to say good-by to him.  He had no desire to outstay his welcome. =
 That public had been=20

wonderfully indulgent toward his shortcomings, lenient with his errors, and=
 tremendously inspiring=20

to his best endeavor.  He would not ask too much of it.  Thirty years was a=
 long tenure of office,=20

one of the longest, in point of consecutively active editorship, in the his=
tory of American=20

magazines.  He had helped to create and to put into the life of the America=
n home a magazine of=20

peculiar distinction.  From its beginning it had been unlike any other peri=
odical; it had always=20

retained its individuality as a magazine apart from the others.  It had sou=
ght to be something more=20

than a mere assemblage of stories and articles.  It had consistently stood =
for ideals; and, save in=20

one or two instances, it had carried through what it undertook to achieve. =
 It had a record of worthy=20

accomplishment; a more fruitful record than many imagined.  It had become a=
 national institution=20

such as no other magazine had ever been.  It was indisputably accepted by t=
he public and by=20

business interests alike as the recognized avenue of approach to the intell=
igent homes of America.=20

Edward Bok was content to leave it at this point.  He explained all this in=
 December, 1918, to the=20

Board of Directors, and asked that his resignation be considered.  It was u=
nderstood that he was=20

to serve out his thirty years, thus remaining with the magazine for the bes=
t part of another year.  In=20

the material which _The Journal_ now included in its contents, it began to =
point the way to the=20

problems which would face women during the reconstruction period.  Bok scan=
ned the rather=20

crowded field of thought very carefully, and selected for discussion in the=
 magazine such=20

questions as seemed to him most important for the public to understand in o=
rder to face and solve=20

its impending problems.  The outstanding question he saw which would immedi=
ately face men and=20

women of the country was the problem of Americanization.  The war and its a=
fter-effects had=20

clearly demonstrated this to be the most vital need in the life of the nati=
on, not only for the foreign-

born but for the American as well.  The more one studied the problem the cl=
earer it became that=20

the vast majority of American-born needed a refreshing, and, in many cases,=
 a new conception of=20

American ideals as much as did the foreign-born, and that the latter could =
never be taught what=20

America and its institutions stood for until they were more clearly defined=
 in the mind of the men=20

and women of American birth.  Bok went to Washington, consulted with Frankl=
in K. Lane,=20

secretary of the interior, of whose department the Government Bureau of Ame=
ricanization was a=20

part.  A comprehensive series of articles was outlined; the most expert wri=
ter, Esther Everett Lape,=20

who had several years of actual experience in Americanization work, was sel=
ected; Secretary=20

Lane agreed personally to read and pass upon the material, and to assume th=
e responsibility for=20



its publication.  With the full and direct co-operation of the Federal Bure=
au of Americanization, the=20

material was assembled and worked up with the result that, in the opinion o=
f the director of the=20

Federal Bureau, the series proved to be the most comprehensive exposition o=
f practical=20

Americanization adapted to city, town, and village, thus far published.  Th=
e work on this series was=20

one of the last acts of Edward Bok's editorship; and it was peculiarly grat=
ifying to him that his=20

editorial work should end with the exposition of that Americanization of wh=
ich he himself was a=20

product.  It seemed a fitting close to the career of a foreign-born America=
nized editor.  The scope=20

of the reconstruction articles now published, and the clarity of vision sho=
wn in the selection of the=20

subjects, gave a fresh impetus to the circulation of the magazine; and now =
that the government's=20

embargo on the use of paper had been removed, the full editions of the peri=
odical could again be=20

printed.  The public responded instantly.  The result reached phenomenal fi=
gures.  The last=20

number under Bok's full editorial control was the issue of October, 1919.  =
This number was=20

oversold with a printed edition of two million copies--a record never befor=
e achieved by any=20

magazine.  This same issue presented another record unattained in any singl=
e number of any=20

periodical in the world. It carried between its covers the amazing total of=
 over one million dollars in=20

advertisements.  This was the psychological point at which to stop.  And Ed=
ward Bok did. Although=20

his official relation as editor did not terminate until January, 1920, when=
 the number which=20

contained his valedictory editorial was issued, his actual editorship cease=
d on September 22,=20

1919.  On that day he handed over the reins to his successor.   The announc=
ement of Edward=20

Bok's retirement came as a great surprise to his friends.  Save for one her=
e and there, who had a=20

clearer vision, the feeling was general that he had made a mistake.  He was=
 fifty-six, in the prime=20

of life, never in better health, with "success lying easily upon him"--said=
 one; "at the very summit of=20

his career," said another--and all agreed it was "queer," "strange,"--unles=
s, they argued, he was=20

really ill.  Even the most acute students of human affairs among his friend=
s wondered.  It seemed=20

incomprehensible that any man should want to give up before he was, for som=
e reason, compelled=20

to do so.  A man should go on until he "dropped in the harness," they argue=
d.  Bok agreed that=20

any man had a perfect right to work until he _did_ "drop in the harness."  =
But, he argued, if he=20

conceded this right to others, why should they not concede to him the privi=
lege of dropping with=20

the blinders off?  "But," continued the argument, "a man degenerates when h=
e retires from active=20

affairs."  And then, instances were pointed out as notable examples.  "A ye=
ar of retirement and he=20

was through," was the picture given of one retired man.  "In two years, he =
was glad to come back,"=20

and so the examples ran on.  "No big man ever retired from active business =
and did great work=20

afterwards," Bok was told.  "No?" he answered.  "Not even Cyrus W. Field or=
 Herbert Hoover?"=20

And all this time Edward Bok's failure to be entirely Americanized was brou=
ght home to his=20

consciousness.  After fifty years, he was still not an American!  He had de=
liberately planned, and=20

then had carried out his plan, to retire while he still had the mental and =
physical capacity to enjoy=20

the fruits of his years of labor!  For foreign to the American way of think=
ing it certainly was: the=20

protestations and arguments of his friends proved that to him.  After all, =
he was still Dutch; he had=20

held on to the lesson which his people had learned years ago; that the peop=
le of other European=20

countries had learned; that the English had discovered: that the Great Adve=
nture of Life was=20

something more than material work, and that the time to go is while the goi=
ng is good!  For it=20

cannot be denied that the pathetic picture we so often see is found in Amer=
ican business life more=20



frequently than in that of any other land: men unable to let go--not only f=
or their own good, but to=20

give the younger men behind them an opportunity.  Not that a man should sto=
p work, for man was=20

born to work, and in work he should find his greatest refreshment.  But so =
often it does not occur=20

to the man in a pivotal position to question the possibility that at sixty =
or seventy he can keep=20

steadily in touch with a generation whose ideas are controlled by men twent=
y years younger.=20

Unconsciously he hangs on beyond his greatest usefulness and efficiency: he=
 convinces himself=20

that he is indispensable to his business, while, in scores of cases, the bu=
siness would be distinctly=20

benefited by his retirement and the consequent coming to the front of the y=
ounger blood.  Such a=20

man in a position of importance seems often not to see that he has it withi=
n his power to advance=20

the fortunes of younger men by stepping out when he has served his time, wh=
ile by refusing to let=20

go he often works dire injustice and even disaster to his younger associate=
s.  The sad fact is that=20

in all too many instances the average American business man is actually afr=
aid to let go because=20

he realizes that out of business he should not know what to do.  For years =
he has so excluded all=20

other interests that at fifty or sixty or seventy he finds himself a slave =
to his business, with=20

positively no inner resources. Retirement from the one thing he does know w=
ould naturally leave=20

such a man useless to himself and his family, and his community: worse than=
 useless, as a matter=20

of fact, for he would become a burden to himself, a nuisance to his family,=
 and, when he would=20

begin to write "letters" to the newspapers, a bore to the community.  It is=
 significant that a=20

European or English business man rarely reaches middle age devoid of acquai=
ntance with other=20

matters; he always lets the breezes from other worlds of thought blow throu=
gh his ideas, with the=20

result that when he is ready to retire from business he has other interests=
 to fall back upon.=20

Fortunately it is becoming less uncommon for American men to retire from bu=
siness and devote=20

themselves to other pursuits; and their number will undoubtedly increase as=
 time goes on, and we=20

learn the lessons of life with a richer background. But one cannot help fee=
ling regretful that the=20

custom is not growing more rapidly.  A man must unquestionably prepare year=
s ahead for his=20

retirement, not alone financially, but mentally as well.  Bok noticed as a =
curious fact that nearly=20

every business man who told him he had made a mistake in his retirement, an=
d that the proper life=20

for a man is to stick to the game and see it through--"hold her nozzle agin=
 the bank" as Jim Bludso=20

would say--was a man with no resources outside his business. Naturally, a r=
etirement is a mistake=20

in the eyes of such a man; but oh, the pathos of such a position: that in a=
 world of so much=20

interest, in an age so fascinatingly full of things worth doing, a man shou=
ld have allowed himself to=20

become a slave to his business, and should imagine no other man happy witho=
ut the same claims!=20

It is this lesson that the American business man has still to learn; that n=
o man can be wholly=20

efficient in his life, that he is not living a four-squared existence, if h=
e concentrates every waking=20

thought on his material affairs.  He has still to learn that man cannot liv=
e by bread alone.  The=20

making of money, the accumulation of material power, is not all there is to=
 living.  Life is something=20

more than these, and the man who misses this truth misses the greatest joy =
and satisfaction that=20

can come into his life--service for others.  Some men argue that they can g=
ive this service and be=20

in business, too. But service with such men generally means drawing a check=
 for some worthy=20

cause, and nothing more.  Edward Bok never belittled the giving of contribu=
tions--he solicited too=20

much money himself for the causes in which he was interested--but it is a p=
oor nature that can=20

satisfy itself that it is serving humanity by merely signing checks.  There=
 is no form of service more=20



comfortable or so cheap.  Real service, however, demands that a man give hi=
mself with his check.=20

And that the average man cannot do if he remains in affairs.  Particularly =
true is this to-day, when=20

every problem of business is so engrossing, demanding a man's full time and=
 thought.  It is the=20

rare man who can devote himself to business and be fresh for the service of=
 others afterward.  No=20

man can, with efficiency, serve two masters so exacting as are these.  Besi=
des, if his business has=20

seemed important enough to demand his entire attention, are not the great u=
plift questions equally=20

worth his exclusive thought?  Are they easier of solution than the material=
 problems?  A man can=20

live a life full-square only when he divides it into three periods:  First:=
 that of education, acquiring=20

the fullest and best within his reach and power;  Second: that of achieveme=
nt: achieving for=20

himself and his family, and discharging the first duty of any man, that in =
case of his incapacity=20

those who are closest to him are provided for.  But such provision does not=
 mean an accumulation=20

that becomes to those he leaves behind him an embarrassment rather than a p=
rotection.  To=20

prevent this, the next period confronts him:  Third: Service for others.  T=
hat is the acid test where=20

many a man falls short: to know when he has enough, and to be willing not o=
nly to let well enough=20

alone, but to give a helping hand to the other fellow; to recognize, in a p=
ractical way, that we are=20

our brother's keeper; that a brotherhood of man does exist outside after-di=
nner speeches. Too=20

many men make the mistake, when they reach the point of enough, of going on=
 pursuing the same=20

old game: accumulating more money, grasping for more power until either a n=
ervous breakdown=20

overtakes them and a sad incapacity results, or they drop "in the harness,"=
 which is, of course;=20

only calling an early grave by another name.  They cannot seem to get the t=
ruth into their heads=20

that as they have been helped by others so should they now help others: as =
their means have=20

come from the public, so now they owe something in turn to that public.  No=
 man has a right to=20

leave the world no better than he found it.  He must add something to it: e=
ither he must make its=20

people better and happier, or he must make the face of the world fairer to =
look at.  And the one=20

really means the other.  "Idealism," immediately say some.  Of course, it i=
s.  But what is the matter=20

with idealism?  What really is idealism?  Do one-tenth of those who use the=
 phrase so glibly know=20

its true meaning, the part it has played in the world?  The worthy interpre=
tation of an ideal is that it=20

embodies an idea--a conception of the imagination.  All ideas are at first =
ideals.  They must be.=20

The producer brings forth an idea, but some dreamer has dreamed it before h=
im either in whole or=20

in part.  Where would the human race be were it not for the ideals of men? =
 It is idealists, in a large=20

sense, that this old world needs to-day.  Its soil is sadly in need of new =
seed.  Washington, in his=20

day, was decried as an idealist.  So was Jefferson.  It was commonly remark=
ed of Lincoln that he=20

was a "rank idealist."  Morse, Watt, Marconi, Edison--all were, at first, a=
djudged idealists.  We say=20

of the League of Nations that it is ideal, and we use the term in a derogat=
ory sense.  But that was=20

exactly what was said of the Constitution of the United States. "Insanely i=
deal" was the term used=20

of it.  The idealist, particularly to-day when there is so great need of hi=
m, is not to be scoffed at.  It=20

is through him and only through him that the world will see a new and clear=
 vision of what is right.=20

It is he who has the power of going out of himself--that self in which too =
many are nowadays so=20

deeply imbedded; it is he who, in seeking the ideal, will, through his own =
clearer perception or that=20

of others, transform the ideal into the real.  "Where there is no vision, t=
he people perish."  It was=20

his remark that he retired because he wanted "to play" that Edward Bok's fr=
iends most completely=20

misunderstood.  "Play" in their minds meant tennis, golf, horseback, polo, =
travel, etc.--(curious that=20



scarcely one mentioned reading!).  It so happens that no one enjoys some of=
 these play-forms=20

more than Bok; but "God forbid," he said, "that I should spend the rest of =
my days in a bunker or in=20

the saddle. In moderation," he added, "yes; most decidedly."  But the phras=
e of "play" meant more=20

to him than all this.  Play is diversion: exertion of the mind as well as o=
f the body.  There is such a=20

thing as mental play as well as physical play.  We ask of play that it shal=
l rest, refresh, exhilarate.=20

Is there any form of mental activity that secures all these ends so thoroug=
hly and so directly as=20

doing something that a man really likes to do, doing it with all his heart,=
 all the time conscious that=20

he is helping to make the world better for some one else?  A man's "play" c=
an take many forms.  If=20

his life has been barren of books or travel, let him read or see the world.=
  But he reaches his high=20

estate by either of these roads only when he reads or travels to enrich him=
self in order to give out=20

what he gets to enrich the lives of others.  He owes it to himself to get h=
is own refreshment, his=20

own pleasure, but he need not make that pure self-indulgence.  Other men, m=
ore active in body=20

and mind, feel drawn to the modern arena of the great questions that puzzle=
.  It matters not in=20

which direction a man goes in these matters any more than the length of a s=
tep matters so much=20

as does the direction in which the step is taken.  He should seek those que=
stions which engross=20

his deepest interest, whether literary, musical, artistic, civic, economic,=
 or what not.  Our cities,=20

towns, communities of all sizes and kinds, urban and rural, cry out for men=
 to solve their problems.=20

There is room and to spare for the man of any bent.  The old Romans looked =
forward, on coming=20

to the age of retirement, which was definitely fixed by rule, to a rural li=
fe, when they hied=20

themselves to a little home in the country, had open house for their friend=
s, and "kept bees."=20

While bee-keeping is unquestionably interesting, there are today other and =
more vital occupations=20

awaiting the retired American.  The main thing is to secure that freedom of=
 movement that lets a=20

man go where he will and do what he thinks he can do best, and prove to him=
self and to others=20

that the acquirement of the dollar is not all there is to life.  No man can=
 realize, until on awakening=20

some morning he feels the exhilaration, the sense of freedom that comes fro=
m knowing he can=20

choose his own doings and control his own goings.  Time is of more value th=
an money, and it is=20

that which the man who retires feels that he possesses.  Hamilton Mabie onc=
e said, after his=20

retirement from an active editorial position: "I am so happy that the time =
has come when I elect=20

what I shall do," which is true; but then he added: "I have rubbed out the =
word 'must' from my=20

vocabulary," which was not true.  No man ever reaches that point.  Duty of =
some sort confronts a=20

man in business or out of business, and duty spells "must."  But there is l=
ess "must" in the=20

vocabulary of the retired man; and it is this lessened quantity that gives =
the tang of joy to the new=20

day.  It is a wonderful inner personal satisfaction to reach the point when=
 a man can say: "I have=20

enough."  His soul and character are refreshed by it: he is made over by it=
.  He begins a new life!=20

he gets a sense of a new joy; he feels, for the first time, what a priceles=
s possession is that thing=20

that he never knew before, freedom.  And if he seeks that freedom at the ri=
ght time, when he is at=20

the summit of his years and powers and at the most opportune moment in his =
affairs, he has that=20

supreme satisfaction denied to so many men, the opposite of which comes hom=
e with such cruel=20

force to them; that they have overstayed their time: they have worn out the=
ir welcome.  There is no=20

satisfaction that so thoroughly satisfies as that of going while the going =
is good.  Still----  The=20

friends of Edward Bok may be right when they said he made a mistake in his =
retirement.=20

However----  As Mr. Dooley says: "It's a good thing, sometimes, to have peo=
ple size ye up wrong,=20



Hinnessey: it's whin they've got ye'er measure ye're in danger."  Edward Bo=
k's friends have failed=20

to get his measure,--yet!  They still have to learn what he has learned and=
 is learning every day:=20

"the joy," as Charles Lamb so aptly put it upon his retirement, "of walking=
 about and around=20

instead of to and fro."       *     *     *     *     *  The question now n=
aturally arises, having read this=20

record thus far: To what extent, with his unusual opportunities of fifty ye=
ars, has the=20


_
excellent judgment in selecting the front of the post office as his place o=
f business. Hundreds=20

passed in and out every hour, besides those who passed by on a different de=
stination. Thus many=20

ears caught the young peddler's cry--"Prize packages! Only five cents apiec=
e!"--and made a=20

purchase; most from curiosity, but some few attracted by the businesslike b=
earing of the young=20

merchant, and willing to encourage him in his efforts to make a living. The=
se last, as well as some=20

of the former class, declined to accept the prizes, so that these were so m=
uch gain to Paul.  At=20

length but one package remained, and this Paul was some time getting rid of=
. At last a gentleman=20

came up, holding a little boy of seven by the hand.  "Oh, buy me the packag=
e, papa?" he said,=20

drawing his father's attention.  "What is there in it, boy?" asked the gent=
leman.  "Candy," was the=20

answer.  Alfred, for this was the little boy's name, renewed his entreaties=
, having, like most boys, a=20

taste for candy.  "There it is, Alfred," said his father, handing the packa=
ge to his little son.  "There's=20

a prize inside," said Paul, seeing that they were about to pass.  "We must =
look for the prize by all=20

means," said the gentleman. "What is this? One cent?"  "Yes sir"; and Paul =
held out a cent to his=20

customer.  "Never mind about that! You may keep the prize."  "I want it, pa=
," interposed Alfred,=20

with his mouth full of candy.  "I'll give you another," said his father, st=
ill declining to accept the=20

proffered prize.  Paul now found himself in the enviable position of one wh=
o, at eleven o'clock, had=20

succeeded in disposing of his entire stock in trade, and that at an excelle=
nt profit, as we soon shall=20

see. Business had been more brisk with him than with many merchants on a la=
rger scale, who=20

sometimes keep open their shops all day without taking in enough to pay exp=
enses. But, then, it is=20

to be considered that in Paul's case expenses were not a formidable item. H=
e had no rent to pay,=20

for one thing, nor clerk hire, being competent to attend to his entire busi=
ness single-handed. All his=20

expense, in fact, was the first cost of his stock in trade, and he had so f=
ixed his prices as to insure=20

a good profit on that. So, on the whole, Paul felt very well satisfied at t=
he result of his experiment,=20

for this was his first day in the prize-package business.  "I guess I'll go=
 home," he said to himself.=20

"Mother'll want to know how I made out." He turned up Nassau street, and ha=
d reached the corner=20

of Maiden lane, when Teddy O'Brien met him.  "Did you sell out, Johnny?" he=
 asked.  "Yes,"=20

answered Paul.  "How many packages did you have?"  "Fifty."  "That's bully.=
 How much you=20

made?"  "I can't tell yet. I haven't counted up," said Paul.  "It's better'=
n sellin' papers, I'll bet. I've=20

only made thirty cents the day. Don't you want to take a partner, Johnny?" =
 "No, I don't think I do,"=20

said Paul, who had good reason to doubt whether such a step would be to his=
 advantage.  "Then=20

I'll go in for myself," said Teddy, somewhat displeased at the refusal.  "G=
o ahead! There's nobody=20

to stop you," said Paul.  "I'd rather go in with you," said Teddy, feeling =
that there would be some=20

trouble in making the prize packages, but influenced still more by the know=
ledge that he had not=20

capital enough to start in the business alone.  "No," said Paul, positively=
; "I don't want any partner.=20

I can do well enough alone."  He was not surprised at Teddy's application. =
Street boys are as=20

enterprising, and have as sharp eyes for business as their elders, and no o=
ne among them can=20

monopolize a profitable business long. This is especially the case with the=
 young street merchant.=20

When one has had the good luck to find some attractive article which promis=
es to sell briskly, he=20

takes every care to hide the source of his supply from his rivals in trade.=
 But this is almost=20

impossible. Cases are frequent where such boys are subjected to the closest=
 espionage, their=20

steps being dogged for hours by boys who think they have found a good thing=
 and are determined=20

to share it. In the present case Paul had hit upon an idea which seemed to =
promise well, and he=20



was determined to keep it to himself as long as possible. As soon as he was=
 subjected to=20

competition and rivalry his gains would probably diminish.    CHAPTER II  P=
AUL AT HOME  Paul=20

went up Centre street and turned into Pearl. Stopping before a tenement-hou=
se, he entered, and,=20

going up two flights of stairs, opened a door and entered.  "You are home e=
arly, Paul," said a=20

woman of middle age, looking up at his entrance.  "Yes, mother; I've sold o=
ut."  "You've not sold=20

out the whole fifty packages?" she asked, in surprise.  "Yes, I have. I had=
 capital luck."  "Why, you=20

must have made as much as a dollar, and it's not twelve yet."  "I've made m=
ore than that, mother.=20

Just wait a minute, till I've reckoned up a little. Where's Jimmy?"  "Miss =
Beckwith offered to take=20

him out to walk with her, so I let him go. He'll be back at twelve."  While=
 Paul is making a=20

calculation, a few words of explanation and description may be given, so th=
at the reader may=20

understand better how he is situated.  The rooms occupied by Paul and his m=
other were three in=20

number. The largest one was about fourteen feet square, and was lighted by =
two windows. It was=20

covered with a neat, though well-worn, carpet; a few cane-bottomed chairs w=
ere ranged at the=20

windows, and on each side of the table. There was a French clock on the man=
tel, a rocking chair=20

for his mother, and a few inexpensive engravings hung upon the walls. There=
 was a hanging=20

bookcase containing two shelves, filled with books, partly school books, su=
pplemented by a few=20

miscellaneous books, such as "Robinson Crusoe," "Pilgrim's Progress," a vol=
ume of "Poetical=20

Selections," an odd volume of Scott, and several others. Out of the main ro=
om opened two narrow=20

chambers, both together of about the same area as the main room. One of the=
se was occupied by=20

Paul and Jimmy, the other by his mother.  Those who are familiar with the c=
onstruction of a New=20

York tenement-house will readily understand the appearance of the rooms int=
o which we have=20

introduced them. It must, however, be explained that few similar apartments=
 are found so well=20

furnished. Carpets are not very common in tenement-houses, and if there are=
 any pictures, they=20

are usually the cheapest prints. Wooden chairs, and generally every object =
of the cheapest, are to=20

be met with in the dwellings of the New York poor. If we find something bet=
ter in the present=20

instance, it is not because Paul and his mother are any better off than the=
ir neighbors. On the=20

contrary, there are few whose income is so small. But they have seen better=
 days, and the=20

furniture we see has been saved from the time of their comparative prosperi=
ty.  As Paul is still at=20

his estimate, let us improve the opportunity by giving a little of their ea=
rly history.  Mr. Hoffman, the=20

father of Paul, was born in Germany, but came to New York when a boy of twe=
lve, and there he=20

grew up and married, his wife being an American. He was a cabinetmaker, and=
, being a skillful=20

workman, earned very good wages, so that he was able to maintain his family=
 in comfort. They=20

occupied a neat little cottage in Harlem, and lived very happily, for Mr. H=
offman was temperate=20

and kind, when an unfortunate accident clouded their happiness, and brought=
 an end to their=20

prosperity. In crossing Broadway at its most crowded part, the husband and =
father was run over by=20

a loaded dray, and so seriously injured that he lived but a few hours. Then=
 the precarious nature of=20

their prosperity was found out. Mr. Hoffman had not saved anything, having =
always lived up to the=20

extent of his income. It was obviously impossible for them to continue to l=
ive in their old home,=20

paying a rent of twenty dollars per month. Besides, Paul did not see any go=
od opportunity to earn=20

his living in Harlem. So, at his instigation, his mother moved downtown, an=
d took rooms in a=20

tenement-house in Pearl street, agreeing to pay six dollars a month for apa=
rtments which would=20

now command double the price. They brought with them furniture enough to fu=
rnish the three=20



rooms, selling the rest for what it would bring, and thus obtaining a small=
 reserve fund, which by=20

this time was nearly exhausted.  Once fairly established in their new home,=
 Paul went out into the=20

streets to earn his living. The two most obvious, and, on the whole, most p=
rofitable trades, were=20

blacking boots and selling newspapers. To the first Paul, who was a neat bo=
y, objected on the=20

score that it would keep his hands and clothing dirty, and, street boy thou=
gh he had become, he=20

had a pride in his personal appearance. To selling papers he had not the sa=
me objection, but he=20

had a natural taste for trade, and this led him to join the ranks of the st=
reet peddlers. He began=20

with vending matches, but found so much competition in the business, and re=
ceived so rough a=20

reception oftentimes from those who had repeated calls from others in the s=
ame business, that he=20

gave it up, and tried something else. But the same competition which crowds=
 the professions and=20

the higher employments followed by men, prevails among the street trades wh=
ich are pursued by=20

boys. If Paul had only had himself to support, he could have made a fair li=
ving at match selling, or=20

any other of the employments he took up; but his mother could not earn much=
 at making vests,=20

and Jimmy was lame, and could do nothing to fill the common purse, so that =
Paul felt that his=20

earnings must be the main support of the family, and naturally sought out w=
hat would bring him in=20

most money.  At length he had hit upon selling prize packages, and his firs=
t experience in that line=20

are recorded in the previous chapter. Adding only that it was now a year si=
nce his father's death,=20

we resume our narrative.  "Do you want to know how much I've made, mother?"=
 asked Paul,=20

looking up at length from his calculation.  "Yes, Paul."  "A dollar and thi=
rty cents."  "I did not think it=20

would amount to so much. The prizes came to considerable, didn't they?"  "L=
isten, and I will tell=20

you how I stand:       One pound of candy  . . . . . . . .   .20      Two p=
acks of envelopes . . . . . . .  .10=20

Prize. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .90       ----      That makes . . . =
. . . . . . . . .  $1.20  I sold the fifty=20

packages at five cents each, and that brought me in two dollars and a half.=
 Taking out the=20

expenses, it leaves me a dollar and thirty cents. Isn't that doing well for=
 one morning's work?"  "It's=20

excellent; but I thought your prizes amounted to more than ninety cents."  =
"So they did, but several=20

persons who bought wouldn't take their prizes, and that was so much gain." =
 "You have done very=20

well, Paul. I wish you might earn as much every day."  "I'm going to earn s=
ome more this=20

afternoon. I bought a pound of candy on the way home, and some cheap envelo=
pes, and I'll be=20

making up a new stock while I am waiting for dinner."  Paul took out his ca=
ndy and envelopes, and=20

set about making up the packages.  "Did any complain of the small amount of=
 candy you put in?"=20

"A few; but most bought for the sake of the prizes."  "Perhaps you had bett=
er be a little more liberal=20

with your candy, and then there may not be so much dissatisfaction where th=
e prize is only a=20

penny."  "I don't know but your are right, mother. I believe I'll only make=
 thirty packages with this=20

pound, instead of fifty. Thirty'll be all I can sell this afternoon."  Just=
 then the door opened, and=20

Paul's brother entered.  Jimmy Hoffman, or lame Jimmy, as he was often call=
ed, was a delicate-

looking boy of ten, with a fair complexion and sweet face, but incurably la=
me, a defect which,=20

added to his delicate constitution, was likely to interfere seriously with =
his success in life. But, as=20

frequently happens, Jimmy was all the more endeared to his mother and broth=
er by his misfortune=20

and bodily weakness, and if either were obliged to suffer from poverty, Jim=
my would be spared the=20

suffering.  "Well, Jimmy, have you had a pleasant walk?" asked his mother. =
 "Yes, mother; I went=20

down to Fulton Market. There's a good deal to see there."  "A good deal mor=
e than in this dull=20

room, Jimmy."  "It doesn't seem dull to me, mother, while you are here. How=
 did you make out=20



selling your prize packages?"  "They are all sold, Jimmy, every one. I am m=
aking some more."=20

"Shan't I help you?"  "Yes, I would like to have you. Just take those envel=
opes, and write prize=20

packages on every one of them."  "All right, Paul," and Jimmy, glad to be o=
f use, got the pen and=20

ink, and, gathering up the envelopes, began to inscribe them as he had been=
 instructed.  By the=20

time the packages were made up, dinner was ready. It was not a very luxurio=
us repast. There was=20

a small piece of rump steak--not more than three-quarters of a pound--a few=
 potatoes, a loaf of=20

bread, and a small plate of butter. That was all; but then the cloth that c=
overed the table was neat=20

and clean, and the knives and forks were as bright as new, and what there w=
as tasted good.=20

"What have you been doing this morning, Jimmy?" asked Paul.  "I have been d=
rawing, Paul.=20

Here's a picture of Friday. I copied it from 'Robinson Crusoe.'"  He showed=
 the picture, which was=20

wonderfully like that in the book, for this--the gift of drawing--was Jimmy=
's one talent, and he=20

possessed it in no common degree.  "Excellent, Jimmy!" said Paul. "You're a=
 real genius. I=20

shouldn't be surprised if you'd make an artist some day."  "I wish I might,=
" said Jimmy, earnestly.=20

"There's nothing I'd like better."  "I'll tell you what, Jimmy. If I do wel=
l this afternoon, I'll buy you a=20

drawing-book and some paper, to work on while mother and I are busy."  "If =
you can afford it, Paul,=20

I should like it so much. Some time I might earn something that way."  "Of =
course you may," said=20

Paul, cheerfully. "I won't forget you."  Dinner over, Paul went out to busi=
ness, and was again=20

successful, getting rid of his thirty packages, and clearing another dollar=
. Half of this he invested in=20

a drawing-book, a pencil and some drawing-paper for Jimmy. Even then he had=
 left of his earnings=20

for the day one dollar and eighty cents. But this success in the new busine=
ss had already excited=20

envy and competition, as he was destined to find out on the morrow.    CHAP=
TER III  PAUL HAS=20

COMPETITORS  The next morning Paul took his old place in front of the post =
office. He set down=20

his basket in front, and, taking one of the packages in his hand, called ou=
t in a businesslike=20

manner, as on the day before, "Here's your prize packages! Only five cents!=
 Money prize in every=20

package! Walk up, gentlemen, and try your luck!"  He met with a fair degree=
 of success at first,=20

managing in the course of an hour to sell ten packages. All the prizes draw=
n were small, with the=20

exception of one ten-cent prize, which was drawn by a little bootblack, who=
 exclaimed:  "That's the=20

way to do business, Johnny. If you've got any more of them ten-cent prizes,=
 I'll give you ten cents=20

a piece for the lot."  "Better buy some more and see," said Paul.  "That do=
n't go down," said the=20

other. "Maybe there'd be only a penny."  Nevertheless, the effect of this l=
arge prize was to=20

influence the sale of three other packages; but as neither of these contain=
ed more than two-cent=20

prizes, trade began to grow dull, and for ten minutes all Paul's eloquent a=
ppeals to gentlemen to=20

walk up and try their luck produced no effect.  At this point Paul found th=
at there was a rival in the=20

field.  Teddy O'Brien, who had applied for a partnership the day before, ca=
me up with a basket=20

similar to his own, apparently filled with similar packages. He took a posi=
tion about six feet distant=20

from Paul, and began to cry out, in a shrill voice:  "Here's your bully pri=
ze packages! Best in the=20

market! Here's where you get your big prizes, fifty cents in some of 'em. W=
alk up boys, tumble up,=20

and take your pick afore they're gone. Fifty cents for five!"  "That's a Am=
erican?  These questions,=20

so direct and personal in their nature, are perhaps best answered in a way =
more direct and=20

personal than the method thus far adopted in this chronicle.  We will, ther=
efore, let Edward Bok=20

answer these questions for himself, in closing this record of his Americani=
zation.     CHAPTER XXI=20

WHERE AMERICA FELL SHORT WITH ME  When I came to the United States as a lad=
 of six, the=20



most needful lesson for me, as a boy, was the necessity for thrift.  I had =
been taught in my home=20

across the sea that thrift was one of the fundamentals in a successful life=
.  My family had come=20

from a land (the Netherlands) noted for its thrift; but we had been in the =
United States only a few=20

days before the realization came home strongly to my father and mother that=
 they had brought=20

their children to a land of waste.  Where the Dutchman saved, the American =
wasted.  There was=20

waste, and the most prodigal waste, on every hand.  In every street-car and=
 on every ferry-boat=20

the floors and seats were littered with newspapers that had been read and t=
hrown away or left=20

behind.  If I went to a grocery store to buy a peck of potatoes, and a pota=
to rolled off the heaping=20

measure, the groceryman, instead of picking it up, kicked it into the gutte=
r for the wheels of his=20

wagon to run over.  The butcher's waste filled my mother's soul with dismay=
.  If I bought a scuttle=20

of coal at the corner grocery, the coal that missed the scuttle, instead of=
 being shovelled up and=20

put back into the bin, was swept into the street.  My young eyes quickly sa=
w this; in the evening I=20

gathered up the coal thus swept away, and during the course of a week I col=
lected a scuttleful.=20

The first time my mother saw the garbage pail of a family almost as poor as=
 our own, with the wife=20

and husband constantly complaining that they could not get along, she could=
 scarcely believe her=20

eyes.  A half pan of hominy of the preceding day's breakfast lay in the pai=
l next to a third of a loaf=20

of bread.  In later years, when I saw, daily, a scow loaded with the garbag=
e of Brooklyn=20

householders being towed through New York harbor out to sea, it was an easy=
 calculation that=20

what was thrown away in a week's time from Brooklyn homes would feed the po=
or of the=20

Netherlands.  At school, I quickly learned that to "save money" was to be "=
stingy"; as a young=20

man, I soon found that the American disliked the word "economy," and on eve=
ry hand as plenty=20

grew spending grew.  There was literally nothing in American life to teach =
me thrift or economy;=20

everything to teach me to spend and to waste.  I saw men who had earned goo=
d salaries in their=20

prime, reach the years of incapacity as dependents.  I saw families on ever=
y hand either living=20

quite up to their means or beyond them; rarely within them.  The more a man=
 earned, the more he-

-or his wife--spent.  I saw fathers and mothers and their children dressed =
beyond their incomes.=20

The proportion of families who ran into debt was far greater than those who=
 saved.  When a panic=20

came, the families "pulled in"; when the panic was over, they "let out."  B=
ut the end of one year=20

found them precisely where they were at the close of the previous year, unl=
ess they were deeper=20

in debt.  It was in this atmosphere of prodigal expenditure and culpable wa=
ste that I was to=20

practise thrift: a fundamental in life!  And it is into this atmosphere tha=
t the foreign-born comes=20

now, with every inducement to spend and no encouragement to save.  For as i=
t was in the days of=20

my boyhood, so it is to-day--only worse.  One need only go over the experie=
nces of the past two=20

years, to compare the receipts of merchants who cater to the working-classe=
s and the statements=20

of savings-banks throughout the country, to read the story of how the forei=
gn-born are learning the=20

habit of criminal wastefulness as taught them by the American.  Is it any w=
onder, then, that in this,=20

one of the essentials in life and in all success, America fell short with m=
e, as it is continuing to fall=20

short with every foreign-born who comes to its shores?   As a Dutch boy, on=
e of the cardinal truths=20

taught me was that whatever was worth doing was worth doing well: that next=
 to honesty come=20

thoroughness as a factor in success.  It was not enough that anything shoul=
d be done: it was not=20

done at all if it was not done well.  I came to America to be taught exactl=
y the opposite.  The two=20

infernal Americanisms "That's good enough" and "That will do" were early ta=
ught me, together with=20



the maxim of quantity rather than quality.  It was not the boy at school wh=
o could write the words in=20

his copy-book best who received the praise of the teacher; it was the boy w=
ho could write the=20

largest number of words in a given time.  The acid test in arithmetic was n=
ot the mastery of the=20

method, but the number of minutes required to work out an example.  If a bo=
y abbreviated the=20

month January to "Jan." and the word Company to "Co." he received a hundred=
 per cent mark, as=20

did the boy who spelled out the words and who could not make the teacher se=
e that "Co." did not=20

spell "Company."  As I grew into young manhood, and went into business, I f=
ound on every hand=20

that quantity counted for more than quality.  The emphasis was almost alway=
s placed on how=20

much work one could do in a day, rather than upon how well the work was don=
e.  Thoroughness=20

was at a discount on every hand; production at a premium.  It made no diffe=
rence in what direction=20

I went, the result was the same: the cry was always for quantity, quantity!=
  And into this=20

atmosphere of almost utter disregard for quality I brought my ideas of Dutc=
h thoroughness and my=20

conviction that doing well whatever I did was to count as a cardinal princi=
ple in life.  During my=20

years of editorship, save in one or two conspicuous instances, I was never =
able to assign to an=20

American writer, work which called for painstaking research.  In every inst=
ance, the work came=20

back to me either incorrect in statement, or otherwise obviously lacking in=
 careful preparation.=20

One of the most successful departments I ever conducted in _The Ladies' Hom=
e Journal_ called=20

for infinite reading and patient digging, with the actual results sometimes=
 almost negligible.  I made=20

a study of my associates by turning the department over to one after anothe=
r, and always with the=20

same result: absolute lack of a capacity for patient research.  As one of m=
y editors, typically=20

American, said to me: "It isn't worth all the trouble that you put into it.=
"  Yet no single department=20

ever repaid the searcher more for his pains.  Save for assistance derived f=
rom a single person, I=20

had to do the work myself for all the years that the department continued. =
 It was apparently=20

impossible for the American to work with sufficient patience and care to ac=
hieve a result.  We all=20

have our pet notions as to the particular evil which is "the curse of Ameri=
ca," but I always think that=20

Theodore Roosevelt came closest to the real curse when he classed it as a l=
ack of thoroughness.=20

Here again, in one of the most important matters in life, did America fall =
short with me; and, what is=20

more important, she is falling short with every foreigner that comes to her=
 shores.   In the matter of=20

education, America fell far short in what should be the strongest of all he=
r institutions: the public=20

school.  A more inadequate, incompetent method of teaching, as I look back =
over my seven years=20

of attendance at three different public schools, it is difficult to conceiv=
e.  If there is one thing that I,=20

as a foreign-born child, should have been carefully taught, it is the Engli=
sh language. The=20

individual effort to teach this, if effort there was, and I remember none, =
was negligible.  It was left=20

for my father to teach me, or for me to dig it out for myself.  There was a=
bsolutely no indication on=20

the part of teacher or principal of responsibility for seeing that a foreig=
n-born boy should acquire=20

the English language correctly.  I was taught as if I were American-born, a=
nd, of course, I was left=20

dangling in the air, with no conception of what I was trying to do.  My fat=
her worked with me=20

evening after evening; I plunged my young mind deep into the bewildering co=
nfusions of the=20

language--and no one realizes the confusions of the English language as doe=
s the foreign-born--

and got what I could through these joint efforts.  But I gained nothing fro=
m the much-vaunted=20

public-school system which the United States had borrowed from my own count=
ry, and then had=20

rendered incompetent--either by a sheer disregard for the thoroughness that=
 makes the Dutch=20



public schools the admiration of the world, or by too close a regard for po=
litics.  Thus, in her most=20

important institution to the foreign-born, America fell short.  And while I=
 am ready to believe that=20

the public school may have increased in efficiency since that day, it is, i=
ndeed, a question for the=20

American to ponder, just how far the system is efficient for the education =
of the child who comes to=20

its school without a knowledge of the first word in the English language.  =
Without a detailed=20

knowledge of the subject, I know enough of conditions in the average public=
 school to-day to=20

warrant at least the suspicion that Americans would not be particularly pro=
ud of the system, and of=20

what it gives for which annually they pay millions of dollars in taxes.  I =
am aware in making this=20

statement that I shall be met with convincing instances of intelligent effo=
rt being made with the=20

foreign-born children in special classes.  No one has a higher respect for =
those efforts than I have-

-few, other than educators, know of them better than I do, since I did not =
make my five-year study=20

of the American public school system for naught.  But I am not referring to=
 the exceptional=20

instance here and there.  I merely ask of the American, interested as he is=
 or should be in the=20

Americanization of the strangers within his gates, how far the public schoo=
l system, as a whole,=20

urban and rural, adapts itself, with any true efficiency, to the foreign-bo=
rn child.  I venture to color=20

his opinion in no wise; I simply ask that he will inquire and ascertain for=
 himself, as he should do if=20

he is interested in the future welfare of his country and his institutions;=
 for what happens in=20

America in the years to come depends, in large measure, on what is happenin=
g to-day in the=20

public schools of this country.   As a Dutch boy I was taught a wholesome r=
espect for law and for=20

authority.  The fact was impressed upon me that laws of themselves were fut=
ile unless the people=20

for whom they were made respected them, and obeyed them in spirit more even=
 than in the letter.=20

I came to America to feel, on every hand, that exactly the opposite was tru=
e.  Laws were passed,=20

but were not enforced; the spirit to enforce them was lacking in the people=
.  There was little=20

respect for the law; there was scarcely any for those appointed to enforce =
it.  The nearest that a=20

boy gets to the law is through the policeman.  In the Netherlands a boy is =
taught that a policeman=20

is for the protection of life and property; that he is the natural friend o=
f every boy and man who=20

behaves himself.  The Dutch boy and the policeman are, naturally, friendly =
in their relations.  I=20

came to America to be told that a policeman is a boy's natural enemy; that =
he is eager to arrest=20

him if he can find the slightest reason for doing so.  A policeman, I was i=
nformed, was a being to=20

hold in fear, not in respect.  He was to be avoided, not to be made friends=
 with.  The result was=20

that, as did all boys, I came to regard the policeman on our beat as a dist=
inct enemy.  His=20

presence meant that we should "stiffen up"; his disappearance was the signa=
l for us to "let loose."=20

So long as one was not caught, it did not matter.  I heard mothers tell the=
ir little children that if they=20

did not behave themselves, the policeman would put them into a bag and carr=
y them off, or cut=20

their ears off.  Of course, the policeman became to them an object of terro=
r; the law he=20

represented, a cruel thing that stood for punishment.  Not a note of respec=
t did I ever hear for the=20

law in my boyhood days.  A law was something to be broken, to be evaded, to=
 call down upon=20

others as a source of punishment, but never to be regarded in the light of =
a safeguard.  And as I=20

grew into manhood, the newspapers rang on every side with disrespect for th=
ose in authority.=20

Under the special dispensation of the liberty of the press, which was const=
rued into the license of=20

the press, no man was too high to escape editorial vituperation if his poli=
tics did not happen to suit=20

the management, or if his action ran counter to what the proprietors believ=
ed it should be.  It was=20



not criticism of his acts, it was personal attack upon the official; whethe=
r supervisor, mayor,=20

governor, or president, it mattered not.  It is a very unfortunate impressi=
on that this American lack=20

of respect for those in authority makes upon the foreign-born mind.  It is =
difficult for the foreigner to=20

square up the arrest and deportation of a man who, through an incendiary ad=
dress, seeks to=20

overthrow governmental authority, with the ignoring of an expression of exa=
ctly the same=20

sentiments by the editor of his next morning's newspaper.  In other words, =
the man who writes is=20

immune, but the man who reads, imbibes, and translates the editor's words i=
nto action is=20

immediately marked as a culprit, and America will not harbor him.  But why =
harbor the original=20

cause?  Is the man who speaks with type less dangerous than he who speaks w=
ith his mouth or=20

with a bomb?  At the most vital part of my life, when I was to become an Am=
erican citizen and=20

exercise the right of suffrage, America fell entirely short.  It reached ou=
t not even the suggestion of=20

a hand.  When the Presidential Conventions had been held in the year I reac=
hed my legal majority,=20

and I knew I could vote, I endeavored to find out whether, being foreign-bo=
rn, I was entitled to the=20

suffrage.  No one could tell me; and not until I had visited six different =
municipal departments,=20

being referred from one to another, was it explained that, through my fathe=
r's naturalization, I=20

became, automatically, as his son, an American citizen.  I decided to read =
up on the platforms of=20

the Republican and Democratic parties, but I could not secure copies anywhe=
re, although a week=20

had passed since they had been adopted in convention.  I was told the newsp=
apers had printed=20

them.  It occurred to me there must be many others besides myself who were =
anxious to secure=20

the platforms of the two parties in some more convenient form.  With the ey=
e of necessity ever=20

upon a chance to earn an honest penny, I went to a newspaper office, cut ou=
t from its files the two=20

platforms, had them printed in a small pocket edition, sold one edition to =
the American News=20

Company and another to the News Company controlling the Elevated Railroad b=
ookstands in New=20

York City, where they sold at ten cents each.  So great was the demand whic=
h I had only partially=20

guessed, that within three weeks I had sold such huge editions of the littl=
e books that I had cleared=20

over a thousand dollars.  But it seemed to me strange that it should depend=
 on a foreign-born=20

American to supply an eager public with what should have been supplied thro=
ugh the agency of=20

the political parties or through some educational source.  I now tried to f=
ind out what a vote=20

actually meant.  It must be recalled that I was only twenty-one years old, =
with scant education, and=20

with no civic agency offering me the information I was seeking.  I went to =
the headquarters of each=20

of the political parties and put my query.  I was regarded with puzzled loo=
ks.  "What does it mean=20

to vote?" asked one chairman.  "Why, on Election Day you go up to the ballo=
t-box and put your=20

ballot in, and that's all there is to it."  But I knew very well that that =
was not all there was to it, and=20

was determined to find out the significance of the=20


_
announcement was likely to spoil his trade.  "No, 'tisn't," said Teddy. "If=
 you don't believe it, just=20

buy one and see."  "I'll tell you what I'll do," said Paul, "I'll exchange.=
"  "No," said Teddy; "I ain't a-

goin' to risk givin' fifty cents for one."  "More likely you'd get ten for =
one. You're a humbug."  "Have=20

you really got any fifty-cent prizes?" asked a newsboy, who had sold out hi=
s morning stock of=20

papers, and was lounging about the post office steps.  "Best way is to buy,=
 Johnny," said Teddy.=20

The boy did buy, but his prize amounted to only one cent.  "Didn't I tell y=
ou so?" said Paul.  "Just=20

wait a while and see," said Teddy. "The lucky feller hasn't come along. Her=
e, Mike, jest buy a=20

package!"  Mike, a boy of fifteen, produced five cents, and said, "I don't =
mind if I do."  He selected=20

a package, and, without opening it, slipped it into his pocket.  "Why don't=
 you open it?" said Teddy.=20

"What's the use?" said Mike. "There ain't no fifty cents inside."  However,=
 he drew it out of his=20

pocket, and opened it.  "What's this?" he exclaimed, pulling out a piece of=
 scrip. "Howly St. Patrick!=20

it's I that's in luck, anyhow I've got the fifty cents!"  And he held up to=
 view a fifty-cent scrip.  "Let=20

me look at it," said Paul, incredulously.  But there was no room for doubt.=
 It was a genuine fifty=20

cents, as Paul was compelled to admit.  "Didn't I tell you so?" said Teddy,=
 triumphantly. "Here's=20

where you get fifty-cent prizes."  The appeal was successful. The sight of =
the fifty-cent prize led to=20

a large call for packages, of which Teddy immediately sold ten, while Paul =
found himself=20

completely deserted. None of the ten, however, contained over two cents. St=
ill the possibility of=20

drawing fifty cents kept up the courage of buyers, while Paul's inducements=
 were so far inferior=20

that he found himself wholly distanced.  "Don't you wish you'd gone pardner=
s with me?" asked=20

Teddy, with a triumphant grin, noticing Paul's look of discomfiture. "You c=
an't do business=20

alongside of me."  "You can't make any money giving such big prizes," said =
Paul. "You haven't=20

taken in as much as you've given yet."  "All right," said Teddy. "I'm satis=
fied if you are. Have a=20

package, Jim?"  "Yes," said Jim. "Mind you give me a good prize."  The pack=
age was bought, and,=20

on being opened, proved to contain fifty cents also, to Paul's great amazem=
ent. How Teddy's=20

business could pay, as it was managed, he could not comprehend. One thing w=
as certain,=20

however, his new competitor monopolized the trade, and for two hours Paul d=
id not get a solitary=20

customer.  "There's something about this I don't understand," he pondered, =
thoughtfully. "He must=20

lose money; but he's spoiled my trade."  Paul did not like to give up his b=
eat, but he found himself=20

compelled to. Accordingly he took his basket, and moved off toward Wall str=
eet. Here he was able=20

to start in business without competitors, and succeeded in selling quite a =
number of packages,=20

until a boy came up, and said:  "There's a feller up at the post office tha=
t's givin' fifty-cent prizes. I=20

got one of 'em."  There was a group of half-a-dozen boys around Paul, two o=
f whom were about to=20

invest; but on hearing thus they changed their intention, and walked of in =
the direction of the post=20

office.  Looking up, Paul saw that the boy who had injured his trade was Mi=
ke, who had drawn the=20

first fifty-cent prize from his competitor.  "Can't you stop interfering?" =
he said, angrily. "I've lost two=20

customers by you."  "If you don't like it, you can lump it," said Mike, ins=
olently. "This is a free=20

country, ain't it?"  "It's a mean trick," said Paul, indignantly.  "Say tha=
t ag'in, and I'll upset your=20

basket," returned Mike.  "I'll say it as often as I like," said Paul, who w=
asn't troubled by cowardice.=20

"Come on, if you want to."  Mike advanced a step, doubling his fists; but, =
finding that Paul showed=20

no particular sign of fear, he stopped short, saying: "I'll lick you some o=
ther time."  "You'd better=20

put it off," said Paul. "Have a prize package, sir? Only five cents!"  This=
 was addressed to a young=20

man who came out of an insurance office.  "I don't mind if I do," said the =
young man. "Five cents,=20



is it? What prize may I expect?"  "The highest is ten cents."  "There's a b=
oy around the post office=20

that gives fifty-cent prizes, mister," said Mike. "You'd better buy of him.=
"  "I'll wait till another time,"=20

said the young man. "Here's the money, Johnny. Now for the package."  "Look=
 here," said Paul,=20

indignantly, when his customer had gone away; "haven't you anything to do e=
xcept to drive off my=20

customers?"  "Give me two cents on every package," said Mike, "and I'll tel=
l 'em you give dollar=20

prizes."  "That would be a lie, and I don't want to do business that way." =
 Mike continued his=20

persecutions a while longer, and then turned the corner into Nassau street.=
  "I'm glad he's gone,"=20

thought Paul. "Now there's a chance for me."  He managed after a while to s=
ell twenty of his=20

packages. By this time it was twelve o'clock, and he began to feel hungry. =
He resolved, therefore,=20

to go home to dinner and come out again in the afternoon. He didn't know ho=
w much he had=20

made, but probably about fifty cents. He had made more than double as much =
the day before in=20

less time; but then he did not suffer from competition.  He began to doubt =
whether he could long=20

pursue this business, since other competitors were likely to spring up.  As=
 he walked by the post=20

office he had the curiosity to look and see how his competitor was getting =
along.  Teddy had=20

started, originally, with seventy-five packages; but of those scarcely a do=
zen were left. A group of=20

boys were around him. Among them was Mike, who was just on the point of buy=
ing another=20

package. As before, he put it in his pocket, and it was not till Teddy aske=
d, "What luck, Mike?" that=20

he drew it out, and opening it again, produced fifty cents.  "It's the big =
prize!" he said. "Sure I'm in=20

luck, anyhow."  "You're the boy that's lucky," said Teddy, with a grin.  As=
 Paul witnessed the scene=20

a light broke upon him. Now he understood how Teddy could afford to give su=
ch large prizes. Mike=20

and the other boy, Jim, were only confederates of his--decoy ducks--who kep=
t drawing over again=20

the same prize, which was eventually given back to Teddy. It was plain now =
why Mike put the=20

package into his pocket before opening it. It was to exchange it for anothe=
r packet into which the=20

money had previously been placed, but which was supposed by the lookers-on =
to be the same=20

that had just been purchased. The prize could afterward be placed in a new =
packet and used over=20

again.  "That ain't the same package," said Paul, announcing his discovery.=
 "He had it all the while=20

in his pocket."  "Look here," blustered Mike, "you jest mind your own busin=
ess! That's the best=20

thing for you."  "Suppose I don't?"  "If you don't there may be a funeral t=
o-morrow of a boy about=20

your size."  There was a laugh at Paul's expense, but he took it coolly.  "=
I'll send you a particular=20

invitation to attend, if I can get anybody to go over to the island."  As M=
ike had been a resident at=20

Blackwell's Island on two different occasions, this produced a laugh at his=
 expense, in the midst of=20

which Paul walked off.    CHAPTER IV  TEDDY GIVES UP BUSINESS  "Have you so=
ld all your=20

packages, Paul?" asked Jimmy, as our hero entered the humble room, where th=
e table was=20

already dense ignorance on every hand.  I went to the Brooklyn Library, and=
 was frankly told by=20

the librarian that he did not know of a book that would tell me what I want=
ed to know.  This was in=20

1884.  As the campaign increased in intensity, I found myself a desired per=
son in the eyes of the=20

local campaign managers, but not one of them could tell me the significance=
 and meaning of the=20

privilege I was for the first time to exercise.  Finally, I spent an evenin=
g with Seth Low, and, of=20

course, got the desired information.  But fancy the quest I had been compel=
led to make to acquire=20

the simple information that should have been placed in my hands or made rea=
dily accessible to=20

me.  And how many foreign-born would take equal pains to ascertain what I w=
as determined to=20

find out?  Surely America fell short here at the moment most sacred to me: =
that of my first vote!  Is=20



it any easier to-day for the foreign citizen to acquire this information wh=
en he approaches his first=20

vote?  I wonder!  Not that I do not believe there are agencies for this pur=
pose.  You know there=20

are, and so do I.  But how about the foreign-born?  Does he know it? Is it =
not perhaps like the=20

owner of the bulldog who assured the friend calling on him that it never at=
tacked friends of the=20

family?  "Yes," said the friend, "that's all right.  You know and I know th=
at I am a friend of the=20

family; but does the dog know?"  Is it to-day made known to the foreign-bor=
n, about to exercise his=20

privilege of suffrage for the first time, where he can be told what that pr=
ivilege means: is the means=20

to know made readily accessible to him: is it, in fact, as it should be, br=
ought to him?  It was not to=20

me; is it to him?  One fundamental trouble with the present desire for Amer=
icanization is that the=20

American is anxious to Americanize two classes--if he is a reformer, the fo=
reign-born; if he is an=20

employer, his employees.  It never occurs to him that he himself may be in =
need of=20

Americanization. He seems to take it for granted that because he is America=
n-born, he is an=20

American in spirit and has a right understanding of American ideals. But th=
at, by no means, always=20

follows.  There are thousands of the American-born who need Americanization=
 just as much as do=20

the foreign-born.  There are hundreds of American employers who know far le=
ss of American=20

ideals than do some of their employees.  In fact, there are those actually =
engaged today in the=20

work of Americanization, men at the top of the movement, who sadly need a b=
etter conception of=20

true Americanism.  An excellent illustration of this came to my knowledge w=
hen I attended a large=20

Americanization Conference in Washington.  One of the principal speakers wa=
s an educator of=20

high standing and considerable influence in one of the most important secti=
ons of the United=20

States.  In a speech setting forth his ideas of Americanization, he dwelt w=
ith much emphasis and=20

at considerable length upon instilling into the mind of the foreign-born th=
e highest respect for=20

American institutions.  After the Conference he asked me whether he could s=
ee me that afternoon=20

at my hotel; he wanted to talk about contributing to the magazine. When he =
came, before=20

approaching the object of his talk, he launched out on a tirade against the=
 President of the United=20

States; the weakness of the Cabinet, the inefficiency of the Congress, and =
the stupidity of the=20

Senate.  If words could have killed, there would have not remained a single=
 living member of the=20

Administration at Washington.  After fifteen minutes of this, I reminded hi=
m of his speech and the=20

emphasis which he had placed upon the necessity of inculcating in the forei=
gn-born respect for=20

American institutions.  Yet this man was a power in his community, a strong=
 influence upon others;=20

he believed he could Americanize others, when he himself, according to his =
own statements,=20

lacked the fundamental principle of Americanization.  What is true of this =
man is, in lesser or=20

greater degree, true of hundreds of others.  Their Americanization consists=
 of lip-service; the real=20

spirit, the only factor which counts in the successful teaching of any doct=
rine, is absolutely missing.=20

We certainly cannot teach anything approaching a true Americanism until we =
ourselves feel and=20

believe and practise in our own lives what we are teaching to others.  No l=
aw, no lip-service, no=20

effort, however well-intentioned, will amount to anything worth while in in=
culcating the true=20

American spirit in our foreign-born citizens until we are sure that the Ame=
rican spirit is understood=20

by ourselves and is warp and woof of our own being.   To the American, part=
 and parcel of his=20

country, these particulars in which his country falls short with the foreig=
n-born are, perhaps, not so=20

evident; they may even seem not so very important.  But to the foreign-born=
 they seem distinct=20

lacks; they loom large; they form serious handicaps which, in many cases, a=
re never surmounted;=20



they are a menace to that Americanization which is, to-day, more than ever =
our fondest dream,=20

and which we now realize more keenly than before is our most vital need.  I=
t is for this reason that=20

I have put them down here as a concrete instance of where and how America f=
ell short in my own=20

Americanization, and, what is far more serious to me, where she is falling =
short in her=20

Americanization of thousands of other foreign-born.  "Yet you succeeded," i=
t will be argued.  That=20

may be; but you, on the other hand, must admit that I did not succeed by re=
ason of these=20

shortcomings: it was in spite of them, by overcoming them--a result that al=
l might not achieve.=20

CHAPTER XXII  WHAT I OWE TO AMERICA  Whatever shortcomings I may have found=
 during=20

my fifty-year period of Americanization; however America may have failed to=
 help my transition=20

from a foreigner into an American, I owe to her the most priceless gift tha=
t any nation can offer,=20

and that is opportunity.  As the world stands to-day, no nation offers oppo=
rtunity in the degree that=20

America does to the foreign-born.  Russia may, in the future, as I like to =
believe she will, prove a=20

second United States of America in this respect.  She has the same limitles=
s area; her people the=20

same potentialities.  But, as things are to-day, the United States offers, =
as does no other nation, a=20

limitless opportunity: here a man can go as far as his abilities will carry=
 him.  It may be that the=20

foreign-born, as in my own case, must hold on to some of the ideals and ide=
as of the land of his=20

birth; it may be that he must develop and mould his character by overcoming=
 the habits resulting=20

from national shortcomings.  But into the best that the foreign-born can re=
tain, America can graft=20

such a wealth of inspiration, so high a national idealism, so great an oppo=
rtunity for the highest=20

endeavor, as to make him the fortunate man of the earth to-day.  He can go =
where he will; no=20

traditions hamper him; no limitations are set except those within himself. =
 The larger the area he=20

chooses in which to work, the larger the vision he demonstrates, the more e=
ager the people are to=20

give support to his undertakings if they are convinced that he has their be=
st welfare as his goal.=20

There is no public confidence equal to that of the American public, once it=
 is obtained.  It is fickle,=20

of course, as are all publics, but fickle only toward the man who cannot ma=
intain an achieved=20

success.  A=20


_
simple dinner.  "No," said Paul, "I only sold twenty. I begin to think that=
 the prize-package business=20

will soon be played out."  "Why?"  "There's too many that'll go into it."  =
Here Paul related his=20

experience of the morning, explaining how it was that Teddy had managed to =
distance him in the=20

competition.  "Can't you do the same, Paul?" asked Jimmy. "Mother's got a g=
old dollar she could=20

lend you."  "That might do," said Paul; "but I don't know any boy I could t=
rust to draw it except you,=20

and some of them would know we were brothers."  "I think, Paul, that would =
be dishonest," said=20

Mrs. Hoffman. "I would rather make less, if I were you, and do it honestly.=
"  "Maybe you're right,=20

mother. I'll try it again this afternoon, keeping as far away from Teddy as=
 I can. If I find I can't make=20

it go, I'll try some other business."  "Jimmy, have you shown Paul your dra=
wing?" said his mother.=20

"Here it is, Paul," said Jimmy, producing his drawing-book, from which he h=
ad copied a simple=20

design of a rustic cottage.  "Why, that's capital, Jimmy," said Paul, in re=
al surprise. "I had no idea=20

you would succeed so well." he can in the older European countries, and dep=
end upon the=20

glamour of the past to sustain him or the momentum of success to carry him.=
 Probably the most=20

alert public in the world, it requires of its leaders that they be alert.  =
Its appetite for variety is=20

insatiable, but its appreciation, when given, is full-handed and whole-hear=
ted.  The American=20

public never holds back from the man to whom it gives; it never bestows in =
a niggardly way; it=20

gives all or nothing.  What is not generally understood of the American peo=
ple is their wonderful=20

idealism.  Nothing so completely surprises the foreign-born as the discover=
y of this trait in the=20

American character.  The impression is current in European countries--perha=
ps less generally=20

since the war--that America is given over solely to a worship of the Americ=
an dollar.  While=20

between nations as between individuals, comparisons are valueless, it may n=
ot be amiss to say,=20

from personal knowledge, that the Dutch worship the gulden infinitely more =
than do the Americans=20

the dollar.  I do not claim that the American is always conscious of this i=
dealism; often he is=20


_
"Do you really think so, Paul?" asked the little boy, much pleased.  "I rea=
lly do. How long did it take=20

you?"  "Only a short time--not more than half an hour, I should think," sai=
d Mrs. Hoffman. "I think=20

Jimmy succeeded very well."  "You'll make a great artist some time, Jimmy,"=
 said Paul.  "I wish I=20

could," said the little boy. "I should like to earn some money, so that you=
 and mother need not=20

work so hard."  "Hard work agrees with me. I'm tough," said Paul. "But when=
 we get to be men,=20

Jimmy, we'll make so much money that mother needn't work at all. She shall =
sit in the parlor all=20

day, dressed in silk, with nothing to do."  "I don't think I would enjoy th=
at," said Mrs. Hoffman,=20

smiling.  "Will you be in the candy business, then, Paul?" said Jimmy.  "No=
, Jimmy. It would never=20

do for the brother of a great artist to be selling candy round the streets.=
 I hope I shall have=20

something better to do than that."  "Sit down to dinner, Paul," said his mo=
ther. "It's all ready."  The=20

dinner was not a luxurious one. There was a small plate of cold meat, some =
potatoes, and bread=20

and butter; but Mrs. Hoffman felt glad to be able to provide even that, and=
 Paul, who had the=20

hearty appetite of a growing boy, did full justice to the fare. They had sc=
arcely finished, when a=20

knock was heard at the door. Paul, answering the summons, admitted a stout,=
 pleasant-looking=20

Irishwoman.  "The top of the mornin' to ye, Mrs. Donovan," said Paul, bowin=
g ceremoniously.  "Ah,=20

ye'll be afther havin' your joke, Paul," said Mrs. Donovan, good-naturedly.=
 "And how is your health,=20

mum, the day?"  "I am well, thank you, Mrs. Donovan," said Mrs. Hoffman. "S=
it down to the table,=20

won't you? We're just through dinner, but there's something left."  "Thank =
you, mum, I've jist taken=20

dinner. I was goin' to wash this afternoon, and I thought maybe you'd have =
some little pieces I=20

could wash jist as well as not."  "Thank you, Mrs. Donovan, you are very ki=
nd; but you must have=20

enough work of your own to do."  "I'm stout and strong, mum, and hard work =
agrees with me; but=20

you're a rale lady, and ain't used to it. It's only a thrifle, but if you w=
ant to pay me, you could do a=20

bit of sewin' for me. I ain't very good with the needle. My fingers is too =
coarse, belike."  "Thank=20

you, Mrs. Donovan; on those terms I will agree to your kind offer. Washing =
is a little hard for me."=20

Mrs. Hoffman collected a few pieces, and, wrapping them up in a handkerchie=
f, handed them to=20

her guest.  "And now what have you been doin', Jimmy darlint?" said Mrs. Do=
novan, turning her=20

broad, good-humored face toward the younger boy.  "I've been drawing a pict=
ure," said Jimmy.=20

"Would you like to see it?"  "Now, isn't that illigant?" exclaimed Mrs. Don=
ovan, admiringly, taking=20

the picture and gazing at it with rapt admiration. "Who showed you how to d=
o it?"  "Paul bought me=20

a book, and I copied it out of that."  "You're a rale genius. Maybe you'll =
make pictures some time=20

like them we have in the church, of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints. Do y=
ou think you could draw=20

me, now?" she asked, with curiosity.  "I haven't got a piece of paper big e=
nough," said Jimmy,=20

slyly.  "Ah, it's pokin' fun at me, ye are," said Mrs. Donovan, good-humore=
dly. "Just like my Pat; he=20

run into the room yesterday sayin', 'Mother, there's great news. Barnum's f=
at woman is dead, and=20

he's comin' afther you this afternoon. He'll pay you ten dollars a week and=
 board.' 'Whist, ye=20

spalpeen!' said I; 'is it makin' fun of your poor mother, ye are?' but I co=
uldn't help laughing at the=20

impertinence of the boy. But I must be goin'."  "Thank you for your kind of=
fer, Mrs. Donovan.=20

Jimmy shall go to your room for the sewing."  "There's no hurry about that,=
" said Mrs. Donovan.=20

"I'll jist bring it in meself when it's ready."  "She is very kind," said M=
rs. Hoffman, when Bridget=20

Donovan had gone. "I shall be glad to have her wash. I am apt to feel weak =
after it. What are you=20

going to do this afternoon, Paul?"  "I'll try to sell out the rest of my st=
ock of packages. Perhaps I=20

shan't succeed, but I'll do my best. occur, and the result always shows how=
 close to the surface is=20



his idealism.  And the fact that so frequently he puts over it a thick vene=
er of materialism does not=20

affect its quality.  The truest approach, the only approach in fact, to the=
 American character is, as=20

Viscount Bryce has so well said, through its idealism.  It is this quality =
which gives the truest=20

inspiration to the foreign-born in his endeavor to serve the people of his =
adopted country.  He is=20

mentally sluggish, indeed, who does not discover that America will make goo=
d with him if he=20

makes good with her.  But he must play fair.  It is essentially the straigh=
t game that the true=20

American plays, and he insists that you shall play it too. Evidence there i=
s, of course, to the=20

contrary in American life, experiences that seem to give ground for the bel=
ief that the man=20

succeeds who is not scrupulous in playing his cards.  But never is this tru=
e in the long run.  Sooner=20

or later--sometimes, unfortunately, later than sooner--the public discovers=
 the trickery.  In no other=20

country in the world is the moral conception so clear and true as in Americ=
a, and no people will=20

give a larger and more permanent reward to the man whose effort for that pu=
blic has its roots in=20

honor and truth.  "The sky is the limit" to the foreign-born who comes to A=
merica endowed with=20

honest endeavor, ceaseless industry, and the ability to carry through.  In =
any honest endeavor, the=20

way is wide open to the will to succeed.  Every path beckons, every vista i=
nvites, every talent is=20

called forth, and every efficient effort finds its due reward.  In no land =
is the way so clear and so=20

free.  How good an American has the process of Americanization made me?  Th=
at I cannot say.=20

Who can say that of himself?  But when I look around me at the American-bor=
n I have come to=20

know as my close friends, I wonder whether, after all, the foreign-born doe=
s not make in some=20

sense a better American--whether he is not able to get a truer perspective;=
 whether his is not the=20

deeper desire to see America greater; whether he is not less content to let=
 its faulty institutions be=20

as they are; whether in seeing faults more clearly he does not make a more =
decided effort to have=20

America reach those ideals or those fundamentals of his own land which he f=
eels are in his nature,=20

and the best of which he is anxious to graft into the character of his adop=
ted land?  It is naturally=20

with a feeling of deep satisfaction that I remember two Presidents of the U=
nited States considered=20

me a sufficiently typical American to wish to send me to my native land as =
the accredited minister=20

of my adopted country.  And yet when I analyze the reasons for my choice in=
 both these instances,=20

I derive a deeper satisfaction from the fact that my strong desire to work =
in America for America=20

led me to ask to be permitted to remain here.  It is this strong impulse th=
at my Americanization has=20

made the driving power of my life.  And I ask no greater privilege than to =
be allowed to live to see=20

my potential America become actual: the America that I like to think of as =
the America of Abraham=20

Lincoln and of Theodore Roosevelt--not faultless, but less faulty.  It is a=
 part in trying to shape that=20

America, and an opportunity to work in that America when it comes, that I a=
sk in return for what I=20

owe to her.  A greater privilege no man could have.       EDWARD WILLIAM BO=
