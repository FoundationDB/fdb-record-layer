us--we will but follow in the footsteps of our King and of our Queen and of=
 many whom we care for=20

and whom you and your proconsul and your colleagues have brutally murdered.=
 Shame cannot=20

touch us, and our honour and our pride are so far beyond your reach that yo=
ur impious and blood-

stained hands can never sully them."  She had spoken very slowly and very q=
uietly. There were no=20

heroics about her attitude. Even Martin-Roget--callous brute though he was-=
-felt that she had only=20

spoken just as she felt, and that nothing that he might say, no plea that h=
e might urge, would ever=20

shake her determination.  "Then it seems to me," he said, "that I am only w=
asting my time by trying=20

to make you see reason and common-sense. You look upon me as a brute. Well!=
 perhaps I am. At=20

any rate I am that which your father and you have made me. Four years ago, =
when you had power=20

over me and over mine, you brutalised us. To-day we--the people--are your m=
asters and we make=20

you suffer, not for all--that were impossible--but for part of what you mad=
e us suffer. That, after all,=20

is only bare justice. By making you my wife I would have saved you from dea=
th--not from=20

humiliation, for that you must endure, and at my hands in a full measure--b=
ut I would have made=20

you my wife because I still have pleasant recollections of that kiss which =
I snatched from you on=20

that never-to-be-forgotten night and in the darkness--a kiss for which you =
would gladly have seen=20

me hang then, if you could have laid hands on me."  He paused, trying to re=
ad what was going on=20

behind those fine eyes of hers, with their vacant, far-seeing gaze which se=
emed like another Pine=20

Portage.  The party on foot will have found out, before the canoes reach th=
at, whether Dan has got=20

clear off, and they can rejoin the canoes at the Portage.  So, Fergus, I'll=
 join your party too.  Who=20

else will go?"  Okematan and Jacques Bourassin here stepped forward, but no=
ne of the others=20

seemed disposed to undertake the tramp.  "There iss enough of us--whatever,=
" remarked the=20

Highlander as he and the others put some provisions into their wallets and =
shouldered their guns.=20

"You will be our leader, Antoine Dechamp.  It iss yourself that knows the o=
uts an' ins o' the land=20

better than any of us--except Okematan, may be--but I dar' say he's not as =
weel acquaint wi' the=20

Red River woods as wi' the plains."  The chief bowed a dignified assent to =
this proposition, which,=20

however, he hardly understood.  Dechamp, being accustomed to lead, accepted=
 the position at=20

once, stepped off on the trail of Dan, which had been made distinctly visib=
le when he went=20

crashing through the underwood the day before.  Fergus followed, and Bouras=
sin came third.=20

"Now, then," said Archie, looking into the chief's face, "come along, Oke. =
 You and I will form the=20

rearguard, which is the position of danger and honour in warfare o' this so=
rt--at least if it isn't, it=20

ought to be.  Take care o' yourself, Little Bill.  We'll soon find Dan. Goo=
d-bye."  So saying, the=20

rearguard of the column vanished into the forest, and the others, returning=
 to their canoes, began=20

to descend the river.  Archie was nearer the mark than he imagined when he =
said they would soon=20

find Dan.  The distance which it had taken our hero so long to traverse in=
=20


_
barrier between her and him. At this rough allusion to that moment of horro=
r and of shame, she=20

had not moved a muscle, nor did her gaze lose its fixity.  He laughed.  "It=
 is an unpleasant=20

recollection, eh, my proud lady? The first kiss of passion was not implante=
d on your exquisite lips=20

by that fine gentleman whom you deemed worthy of your hand and your love, b=
ut by Pierre fade=20

when they came to the edge of the wood where Dan had spent the night.  Dech=
amp, of course,=20

was first to come upon his encampment, and the instant he entered it he obs=
erved the open space=20

giving a view of the plain beyond.  He also saw the wolf sitting on his hau=
nches about two hundred=20

yards off.  Quick as the lightning flash his gun flew to his shoulder.  Dec=
hamp was a=20


_
the miller's son, what? a creature not quite so human as your horse or your=
 pet dog. Neither you=20

nor I are like to forget that methinks...."  Yvonne vouchsafed no reply to =
the taunt, and for a=20

moment there was silence in the room, until Chauvelin's thin, suave voice b=
roke in quite gently:=20

"Do not lose your patience with the wench, citizen Martin-Roget. Your time =
is too precious to be=20

wasted in useless recriminations."  "I have finished with her," retorted th=
e other sullenly. "She shall=20

be dealt with now as I think best. I agree with citizen Carrier. He is righ=
t after all. To the Loire with=20

the lot of that foul brood!"  "Nay!" here rejoined Chauvelin with placid ur=
banity, "are you not a little=20

harsh, citizen, with our fair Yvonne? Remember! Women have moods and megrim=
s. What they=20

indignantly refuse to yield to us one day, they will grant with a smile the=
 next. Our beautiful Yvonne=20

is no exception to this rule, I'll warrant."  Even while he spoke he threw =
a glance of warning on his=20

colleague. There was something enigmatic in his manner at this moment, in t=
he strange suavity=20

wherewith he spoke these words of conciliation and of himself in death upon=
 the plain.  Thus was=20

Dan Davidson rescued at almost the eleventh hour.    CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.  H=
OME-COMING=20

AND BARGAINING.  The return of the hunting party to Red River Settlement wa=
s an illustration of=20

the uncertainty of all human affairs.  They went forth rejoicing in all the=
 strength of youth and=20

manhood; they returned in sorrow, with one at least of the strong men reduc=
ed to the last stage of=20

weakness.  We would not be understood to refer to this in a pessimistic spi=
rit.  On the contrary, the=20

optimistic view suggests the very same idea of uncertainty, though in a ple=
asant aspect; for does=20

not many a day that dawns in cloud and rain progress to brilliant sunshine?=
 while equally true it is=20

that many a life which begins in sorrow culminates in joy.  Okematan, who w=
as intensely=20

philosophical and inquisitive, had been carrying on a semi-speculative conv=
ersation with Billie on=20

this very subject while descending the Red River towards Prairie Cottage--m=
uch to the perplexity=20

of the invalid, who scarce knew how to answer the chief's queries, and grea=
tly to the interest of=20

Archie, who wondered at Little Bill's powers of=20
