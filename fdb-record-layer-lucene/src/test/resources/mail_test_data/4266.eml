with the 6-1/2 in.=20

orm you that I have found=20

a most minute crater in Picard _a_, it is much smaller than the test crater=
 (mentioned in Cel. Obj.,=20

by WEBB, page 83) in same formation. I wrote to Mr. WEBB about it, and sinc=

distinctly; it is another proof of the excellence of your telescope.=20

SIR,=E2=80=94After four months use of the telescope I had of you (an 8-1/2 =
in.), I am able to tell you that I=20

am much pleased with its great excellence. The definition of the mirror is =
very fine, and its=20

performance on the Moon being superb, with so high a power as 700. The stan=
d I find very steady=20

 much (5-1/4 in. equatorial); the=20

mirror is, as you say, a gem, and it is quite a treat to look at the myster=
ies above. Saturday was a=20
