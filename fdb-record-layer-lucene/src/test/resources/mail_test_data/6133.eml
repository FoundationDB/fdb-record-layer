importance now. With one sad look of farewell he went his way, and was soon=
 absorbed in=20

preparations for the great and terrible sacrifice which was approaching so =
quickly.  He did not=20

forget to send a messenger to the dwelling of Petrovitch to learn the lates=
t tidings of the heroic old=20

man; and was told that he had left the house, with his grandson Feodor, on =
the first intimation of=20

the approach of the French.  The first regiment of Frenchmen who advanced t=
hat day along the=20

great Smolensko road to the Gate of Triumph could have told Ivan something =
more. Just outside=20

the gate, under a green and spreading oak-tree, sat a venerable old man, wi=
th hair and beard of=20

silver whiteness; while beside him stood a slight, tall stripling of some s=
ixteen summers. The boy=20

held a gun in his hand, and as the French advanced, he took deliberate aim =
at their leader, who=20

was conspicuous on his stately horse, his plumed cap waving in the wind. In=
 a moment more the=20

horse was riderless and the plumes were trailing in the dust.  This was the=
 signal for a dozen=20
