The above is given for the elucidation of that which is to follow. The disciples of Simon Magus 

were numerous, and were instructed by him in Magic. They made use of so-called "exorcisms" (as 

in the _New Testament_), incantations, philtres; believed in dreams and visions, and produced 

them at will; and finally forced the lower orders of spirits to obey them. Simon Magus was called 

"the Great Power of God," literally "the Christophe. Friquet, seeing this fine officer thus walk away, 

followed by two guards, amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as 

the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage.  Hardly had the police 

officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the 

coachman, who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussel's door.

the Deity which is called Great." That which was then termed Magic we now call Theosophia, or 

Divine Wisdom, Power and Knowledge.  His direct disciple, Menander, was also a great Magician. 

Says Irenaeus, among other writers:       The successor of Simon was Menander, a Samaritan by 

birth, who     reached the highest summits in the Science of Magic.   Thus both master and pupil 

are shown as having attained the highest powers in the art of enchantments, powers which can be 

obtained only through "the help of the Devil," as Christians claim; and yet their "works" were 

identical with those spoken of in the _New Testament_, wherein such phenomenal results are 

called divine miracles, and are, therefore, believed in and accepted as coming from and through 

God. But the question is, have these so-called "miracles" of the "Christ" and the Apostles ever 

been explained any more than the magical achievements of so-called Sorcerers and Magicians? I 

say, never. We Occultists do not believe in knocked at the door at the same moment, and Friquet 

was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be opened.  "What dost thou there, rascal?" 

asked Comminges.  "I want to go into Master Broussel's house, captain," replied Friquet, in that 

wheedling way the "gamins" of Paris know so well how to assume when necessary.  "And on what 

floor does he live?" asked Comminges.  "In the whole house," said Friquet; "the house belongs to 

him; he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals; he 

must be at dinner now; it is noon."  "Good," said Comminges.  At this moment the door was 

opened, and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home 

and at dinner.  Broussel was seated at the table with his family, having his wife opposite to him, 

his two daughters by his side, and his son, Louvieres, whom we have already seen when the 

accident happened to the councillor--an accident from which he had quite recovered--at the 


_
us see, then, what is really the sense of the word Magic.  The source and basis of it lie in Spirit 

and Thought, whether on the purely divine or the terrestrial plane. Those who know the history of 

Simon have the two versions before them, that of White and of Black Magic, at their option, in the 

much talked of union of Simon with Helena, whom he called his Epinoia (Thought). Those who, 

like the Christians, had to discredit a dangerous rival, talk of Helena as being a beautiful and 

actual woman, whom Simon had met in a house of ill-fame at Tyre, and who was, according to 

those who wrote his life, the reincarnation of Helen of Troy. How, then, was she "Divine of the 

table. The worthy man, restored to perfect health, was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de 

Longueville had sent to him.  At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved, but seeing him 

bow politely he rose and bowed also. Still, in spite of this reciprocal politeness, the countenances 

of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness; Louvieres became very pale and waited 

impatiently for the officer to explain himself.  "Sir," said Comminges, "I am the bearer of an order 

from the king."  "Very well, sir," replied Broussel, "what is this order?" And he held out his hand.  "I 

am commissioned to seize your person, sir," said Comminges, in the same tone

to say in _Philosophumena_, or the third AEons, being so material, had more badness in them 

than all the others. Poor man, created or emanated from them, had the vice of his origin. What 

was it? Only this: when the third AEons possessed themselves, in their turn, of the Divine Thought 

through the transmission into them of Fire, instead of making of man a complete being, according 

to the universal plan, had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow 

me."  A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people, so peacefully assembled there, 

would not have produced a more appalling effect. It was a horrible thing at that period to be 

imprisoned by the enmity of the king. Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword, which stood 

against a chair in a corner of the room; but
