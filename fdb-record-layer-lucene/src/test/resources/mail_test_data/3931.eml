From Spokane this road presses northward through the Colville Valley to the Columbia, and 

thence to the international boundary line, having previously passed at Deer Park the Arcadia 

orchard, largest commercial apple orchard in the world; Loon Lake, a summer resort; Chewelah, a 

mining town surrounded by a dairying country; and Colville, county seat of Stevens county and 

largest city in this section. A pleasant contrast is this northern extension, regaining the mountains 

and evergreen forests, the swiftly flowing rivers with glorious waterfalls, and the chains of lakes 

adorning irrigated vales and green meadows.   OLYMPIC, NATIONAL PARK AND OTHER 

HIGHWAYS.  The Olympic Highway, when the few miles from Bogachiel to Lake Quiniault, 

overlooking the Pacific Ocean, are completed, will form a complete loop around the Olympic 

Peninsula, from which it in her doorway to welcome them. Mrs. Earley was Earley's mother, and 

Earley was gardener and general factotum at Wren's End. Mrs. Earley looked after the chickens, 

and when she had exchanged the news with Jan, and rather tearfully admired "poor Mrs. 

Tancred's little 'uns," she escorted them all to the orchard to see the cocks and hens and 

chickens. Then they visited the stable, where Placid, the pony, was sole occupant. In former years 

Placid had been kept for the girls to drive in the governess-cart and to pull the heavy lawn-mower 

over the lawns. And Hannah had been wont to drive him into Amesberrow every Sunday, that she 

might attend the Presbyterian church there. She put him up at a livery-stable near her church and 

always paid for him herself. Anthony Ross usually had hired a motor for the summer months. Now

exposes some of the most scenic features of the Sound country, including Hood Canal, the Strait 

of Juan de Fuca, Grays Harbor, and occasionally the Pacific Ocean. The principal cities touched at 

are Shelton, Port Townsend, Port Angeles, Hoquiam, Aberdeen, All round the walled garden did 

they go, and Meg played horses with the children up and down the broad paths while Jan 

discussed vegetables with Earley. And last of all they went to the back door to ask Hannah for milk 

and scones, for the keen, fresh air had made them all hungry.  Refreshed and very crumby, they 

were starting out again when Hannah laid a

[Illustration: ANACORTES ROAD.]  The National Park Highway extends from Tacoma to Rainier 

National Park, whence it bears southward to the headwaters of the Cowlitz, crosses to the 

Chehalis Valley and, after connecting with Chehalis and Centralia, leads southwest, over the low 

coast range to Raymond and South Bend on Willapa Bay, and from there continues to the mouth 

of the Columbia.  Other scenic routes are planned to cross the Cascade mountains. Two are 

nearly completed, viz., the McClellan Pass Highway, paralleling the Sunset as far as North 

Yakima, and  The children and Meg gone, Hannah led the way into the kitchen with an air of great 

mystery; but she did not shut the doors, as Anne Chitt was busy upstairs.  "What is it, Hannah?" 

Jan asked nervously, for she saw that this summons portended something serious.  "It's about 

Miss Morton I want to speak, Miss Jan. I was in hopes she'd never wear they play-acting claes 

down here ..." (when Hannah was deeply earnest she always became very Scotch), "but it seems I 

hoped in vain. And what am I to say to ither folk when they ask me about her?"  "What is there to
