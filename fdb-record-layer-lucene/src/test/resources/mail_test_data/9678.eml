finger-print system, since the advent of Mr. Clemens' book, has sprung into=
 vogue in all parts of=20

the country.  There are to date several authentic cases on record where by =
means of this new=20

method of identification prisoners were acquitted, notwithstanding the fact=
 that circumstantial=20

evidence in the hands of the prosecuting attorney was overwhelmingly agains=
t the accused. One=20

case was that of a man who had broken his parole from a penitentiary. While=
 absolutely innocent,=20

he was arrested and charged with having committed a certain crime. He could=
 offer no proof=20

without divulging the fact that he had violated his parole, (he still had a=
bout two years to serve),=20

but realizing that he was about to be sentenced for eight or ten years on t=
he present charge, he=20

chose the lesser of the two evils and informed the authorities of his ident=
ity. Investigation disclosed=20

the fact that he had not been released from the penitentiary when the alleg=
ed crime was=20

committed. This incident demonstrates conclusively that the finger-print sy=
stem not only detects=20

the wrongdoer, but greatly assists in preventing a miscarriage of justice. =

d   After the operation=20

of taking the new arrival's finger-imprints is completed, and instructions =
are given as to prison=20

discipline, etc., the incoming prisoner is sent to the medical department, =
where he is given a=20

thorough physical examination, and if he is affected with any disease it is=
 noted in a book kept=20

expressly for that purpose. If he needs medical attention he is told to com=
e up to the "sick-call" in=20

the forenoon at nine o'clock. All ailing prisoners can attend this call eac=
h morning.=20

THE PRISONER IS ASSIGNED WORK   By this time the new arrival is, in all pro=
bability,=20

wondering what will happen next, but he is soon enlightened. Work in one of=
 the various=20

departments will be assigned him, for instance, presuming that the shop whe=
re he is to be=20

employed is the twine factory, he is turned over to the guard of that parti=
cular shop. This officer=20

instructs him very minutely as to shop rules and duties that will devolve u=
pon him, and usually=20

accompanies his instructions with some good, sound advice as to how to best=
 get along with the=20

least possible trouble. The shop foreman now takes him in charge and instru=
cts him how to=20

perform the duties required of him.  At the noon hour he must take off his =
apron, wash his hands=20

and face in a bucket of water placed conveniently near the shop runner, and=
 when the guard=20

blows another sharp blast with his whistle form in line with the other men =
and prepare to march to=20

the dining room.  He is now assigned a place in the ranks of his shop crew =
and told to always "fall=20

in" at his place. The guard stamps his cane twice on the floor and the men =
begin to march to=20

dinner.  At first the "fresh fish" makes quite a number of mistakes: In the=
 dining room he is=20

somewhat bewildered as to how to make his wants known to the waiters, as he=
 has been told that=20

talking is strictly forbidden, but upon reading the rules in the library ca=
talogue he easily=20

comprehends the silent method of asking for food. If he wishes bread he mus=
t hold up his right=20

hand; meat, his fork; soup, his spoon; vegetables, his table knife; coffee,=
 his cup, and for water,=20

the rule is to hold up the cup inverted. This form of the sign language is =
fully adequate for the=20

situation.                            THE FIRST NIGHT IN HIS CELL   At the =
close of the first day's work=20

the prisoner is marched to his cell. Just inside the entrance to the cell h=
ouse he is handed his=20

supper in a tin dish, goes to his cell, previously assigned eight Hours; th=
en strain all thro' a fine=20

Hair-Sieve, and put it into a Vessel that will but just hold it, and when i=
t has done working, slop it=20



down close, and let it stand three Weeks or a Month before you bottle it, p=
utting a Lump of Loaf-

Sugar into every Bottle. This Wine is best when it is three Months old. Aft=
er this manner you may=20

make Wine of any other Herb or Flower.         *       *       *       *   =
    *  JUNE.  This Month is a=20

proper Season for making several sorts of Wine, whether it be that of Goosb=
erries, Currants,=20

Cherries, Apricots, or Rasberries, all which are very agreeable and worth t=
he trouble; the Expence,=20

where these Fruits are growing, being very inconsiderable. The following Re=
ceipts are approved to=20

be very excellent.    Preliminaries to the making of Goosberry-Wine.  Goosb=
erry-Wine is one of the=20

richest and strongest Wines made in _England_, it will keep many Years, and=
 improve by keeping,=20

if it be well made; and is not, in my opinion, inferior to Mountain _Malaga=
_.  To make this Wine, we=20

must have regard to the sort of Goosberry we design to use, for there is a =
great deal of difference=20

in the time of one sort's ripening and another: the earliest ripe are the C=
hampaign, the Green, the=20

Black, and Red hairy Goosberries, every one of which has a Flavour distinct=
 from the other sorts,=20

and so will yield each of them a Wine of as different a relish from the res=
t, as one may expect to=20

find among the several Varieties of the _French_ growth. The most forward o=
f these kinds about=20

_London_ ripen early in this Month, if the Season be good; but the later fo=
rts are not generally ripe=20

till the end of the Month, or in _July._ The later sorts are commonly the w=
hite Dutch, the Amber,=20

and the Walnut-Goosberries, each of which has likewise a different fort of =
taste: of the Amber=20

especially I have known an excellent Wine to be made. Again, we must consid=
er, that as to the=20

time of their ripening, the diversity of Situations will forward or retard =
them a Fortnight or three=20

Weeks; and beside, as we have observed above, every Season is not alike, an=
d we must have=20

regard also to the difference of Climate, one part of _Britain_ is three We=
eks sooner or later than=20

another: and when I say in any one of my Kalendars, or Monthly Directories,=
 that any particular=20

Fruit is ripe, or any particular thing is to be done in such a Month, it mu=
st be understood that it is=20

generally so, but will vary now and then, as the Season is more or less for=
ward. There is likewise=20

another thing to be consder'd relating to the ripeness of Fruits, and that =
is, the different Opinions=20

or Tastes of Mankind; some call them ripe when they just begin to turn: but=
 what I mean by=20

ripeness, is, when a Fruit is as tender as it can be, and possessing its hi=
ghest Flavour: And by=20

those Fruits which I call half ripe, I mean such as have their inward Juice=
s sweet, and their=20

outward Parts a little hard and sour. In this state should the Goosberry be=
 gather'd for making of=20

Wine, See the following Receipt.    To make Goosberry-Wine.  Gather your Go=
osberries in dry=20

Weather, when they are half ripe, as I have explained in the above Prelimin=
aries, pick them and=20

bruise them in a Tub, with a wooden Mallet, or other such like Instrument, =
for no Metal is proper;=20

then take about the quantity of a Peck of the bruised Goosberries, put them=
 into a Bag made of=20

Horse-Hair, and press them as much as possible, without breaking the Kernel=
s: repeat this Work=20

till all your Goosberries are press'd, and adding to this press'd Juice, th=
e other which you will find=20

in the Tub, add to every Gallon three Pounds of powder Sugar, for _Lisbon_ =
Sugar will give the=20

Wine a taste which may be disagreeable to some People, and besides it will =
sweeten much more=20

than the dry powder Sugar; stir this together till the Sugar is dissolved, =
and then put it in a Vessel=20

or Cask, which must be quite fill'd with it. If the Vessel holds about ten =
or twelve Gallons, it=20


_
standing with his right hand on the cell door until the evening count of th=
e number of prisoners in=20

the institution has been verified by the deputy warden. If the count is cor=
rect the prisoners are=20

notified by the sounding of a gong near the desk of the cellhouse captain, =
at which signal they are=20

permitted to sit down and amuse themselves as they see fit. Immediately aft=
er the ringing of the=20

gong the gallery men pass around tea for the prisoner's evening meal in add=
ition to what he=20

received when he enters the cellhouse.  Our subject now has an opportunity =
to take a glance at=20

the cell wherein he must spend his "little bit" as the professional crook j=
ocularly terms his=20

sentence. This apartment is not commodious nor supplied with modern improve=
ments of a first-

class hostelry; its dimensions are five by seven, and contains: one Bible, =
two cups, one small=20

mirror, one cuspidor, one spoon, one face towel, one dish towel, one piece =
of soap, one comb,=20

blankets, sheets, pillow cases, matress, bedstead and springs, one wooden c=
hair (for first and=20

second grade), one earthen water jar with cover, one electric light, one sm=
all shelf, one library=20

catalogue and all the library and school books desired. If the occupant is =
of a twenty Gallons, then=20

about four or five Weeks, to settle, in a cool Place: then draw off the Win=
e from the Lee, and after=20

you have discharg'd the Vessel from the Lees, return the clear Liquor again=
 into the Vessel, and=20

let it stand three Months, if the Cask is about ten Gallons; or between fou=
r and five Months, if it be=20

twenty Gallons, and then bottle it off. We must note, that a small Cask of =
any Liquor is always=20

sooner ripe and fit for drinking than the Liquor of a larger Cask will be; =
but a small Body of Liquor=20

will sooner change sour, than that which is in a larger Cask. The Wine, if =
it is truly prepared,=20

according to the above Directions, will improve every Year, and last severa=
l Years.    Preliminaries=20

to the making of Currant Wine.  It is to be noted, that tho' there are two =
sorts of Currants, which=20

may be used for making of Wine, that is, the Red and the White; yet the Tas=
te and Goodness will=20

be the same, whether 'tis made of the White or the Red, for they have both =
the same Qualities,=20

except in the Colour. Observe also, that the Fruit be gather'd in a dry tim=
e, and that if you make a=20

large Quantity, it must stand longer in the Vessel, before bottling, than a=
 small Quantity.    To=20

make Currant Wine.=20


_
mind he will now realize that the way of the transgressor is indeed hard. T=
he first month or two are=20

the most severe upon the new arrival. His environments force him to dwell c=
ontinually upon the=20

depths of degradation to which he has fallen, and he suffers the keenest po=
ssible mental torture;=20

but after passing this period he begins to readjust his viewpoint and adapt=
 himself to his=20

surroundings and Stalks and weigh them, in order to proportion your Water a=
nd Sugar to them.=20

When this is done, bruise them to pieces with your Hands, and add to every =
three Pounds of=20

Currants a Quart of Water, stirring all together, and letting it stand thre=
e Hours, at the end of which=20

time, strain it off gently thro' a Sieve, and put your Sugar into your Liqu=
or, after the rate of a Pound=20

to every three Pounds of=20
