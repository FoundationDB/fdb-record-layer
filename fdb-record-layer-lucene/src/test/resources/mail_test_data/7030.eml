touch of the Holbein Astronomer in it.  "There's lots of boys and girls I like," he noncommittally 

asserted. And I began to see that it was hopeless. My boy had reservations from his own mother, 

reservations which I would be compelled to respect. He was no longer entirely and unequivocally 

mine. There was a wild-bird part of him which had escaped, which I could never recapture and 

cage again. The thing that his father had foretold was really coming about. My laddie would some 

day grow out of my reach. I would lose him. And my happiness, which had been trying its wings for 

the last few days, came down out of the sky like a shot duck. All day long, for Susie's sake, I've 

tried to be light-hearted. But my efforts make me think of a poor old worn-out movie-hall piano 

doing its pathetic level best to be magnificently blithe. It's a meaningless clatter in a meaningless 

world.     _Thursday the Eleventh_   It ought to be winter, according to the almanac, but our 

wonderful Indian Summer weather continues. Susie and I have been "blue-doming" to-day. We 

converted ourselves into a mounted escort for Gershom and the victory is commemorated by the 

White Horse, which forms the subject of a little work by Thomas Hughes, a true representative, if 

any there be, of the liegemen and soldiers of King Alfred. When Ethelbert was showing that in him 

at all events Christianity was not free from the ascetic taint, by continuing to hear mass in his tent 

when the moment had come for decisive action, Alfred charged up-hill "like a wild boar" against 

the heathen, and began a battle which, his brother at last coming up, ended in a great victory. The 

death of Ethelbert, in the midst of the crisis, placed the perilous crown on Alfred's head. Ethelbert 

left infant sons, but the monarchy was elective, though one of the line of Cerdic was always 

chosen; and those were the days of the real king, the ruler judge, and captain of the people, not of 

what Napoleon called the _cochon a l'engrais a cinq millions par an_. In pitched battles, eight of 

which were fought in rapid succession, the English held their own; but they were worn out, and at 

length could no longer be brought into the field. Whether a faint monkish tradition of the

Lake, in the hope of getting a few duck. But the weather was too fine, though I managed to bring 

down a couple of mallard, after one of which Susie, having removed her shoes and stockings, 

waded knee-deep in the slough. She enjoys that sort of thing: it's something so entirely new to the 

child of the city. And Susie, I might add, is already looking much better. She is sleeping soundly, at 

last, and has promised me the people by unpopular courses on the part of the young king has any 

substance of truth we cannot say.  Utter gloom now settled down upon the Christian king and 

people. Had Alfred yielded to his inclinations, he would probably have followed the example of his 

brother-in-law, Buhred of Mercia, and sought a congenial retreat amidst the churches and libraries 

of Rome; asceticism would have afforded him a pretext for
