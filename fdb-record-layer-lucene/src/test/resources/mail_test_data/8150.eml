 Lothair, =E2=80=9Cmy opinions are already formed on every _
through the rule which he had stringently observed since his return to Wall=
s End Castle. For many=20

years no lady had graced the great old house with her presence. It was cons=
iderably to Justice=20

Haggard's astonishment that he heard of the invitation to his son and his s=
on's wife. "Hetton won't=20

like it," he muttered to himself, as with the point of his stick he gently =
titillated the back of one of=20

his favourite black pigs. The animal stood perfectly still, grunting with s=
uppressed delight. "Hetton=20

will be decidedly savage," mused the old gentleman. "I wonder whether Regin=
ald will get=20

something in the will?" pondered his father, his eyes fixed on the black pi=
g's ears. "He's a lucky=20

beggar, Reginald, a very lucky beggar, and Warrender's daughter is more tha=
n he deserves." Few=20

fathers think that any woman is more than their son deserves, particularly =
when that son is an only=20

son, wealthy, and a possible heir to a peerage; but we may take it that Jus=
tice Haggard knew=20

pretty well what his son deserved, and that when he considered Georgie "mor=
e than his son=20

deserved," Justice Haggard was probably right. If the prodigal really had h=
is deserts he would still=20

be chewing husks with the Mexican swine--husks which the magnificent specim=
en of the porcine=20

race who was so delightedly submitting to the caresses of the Justice's sti=
ck would doubtlessly=20

have indignantly rejected. "I wonder why," continued the meditating Justice=
, "Hetton don't marry?"=20

Perhaps Mademoiselle Zizine, of the French theatre, was the reason--who kno=
ws? Hetton didn't=20

go into society, not that society wouldn't have been very glad to receive L=
ord Hetton, being Lord=20

Hetton, even if he had been a Siamese twin or a Spotted Boy, which he wasn'=
t. But Lord Hetton=20

found that society cost money, and only placed an additional barrier betwee=
n him and the object of=20

his ambition--the blue ribbon of the turf. Hence when Lord Hetton sought di=
straction from race=20

meetings and Tattersall's, he found it in the society of Mademoiselle Zizin=
e and her like.  Evidently=20

the question of why Hetton didn't marry perplexed the Justice; he paused in=
 his attentions to the=20

pig; the animal, who was black but comely, missing the accustomed caress, g=
ave a little snort of=20

impatience. "Bother Hetton!" said the Justice, administering a sudden and u=
nexpected prod to that=20

tender but irritable skin. The injured and indignant animal gave vent to a =
succession of eldritch=20

screams. The callous Justice passed on to the next stye, immersed in though=
t.  Great were the=20

preparations at Walls End Castle, and greater still the astonishment of the=
 old housekeeper when=20

she heard that the winter house party was to be graced with the presence of=
 ladies. Not that what=20

were termed the state apartments were in any way disturbed. The old show ro=
oms were left to the=20

mice and ghosts, but the more modern suites were all to be occupied. My lad=
y's own rooms had=20

been allotted to Haggard and his wife. The rather Spartan simplicity of the=
 late Lady Pit Town had=20

made her own rooms sombre, if not grim. It had been a labour of love with t=
he old lord to change=20

all this. The aesthetic gentleman Messrs. Spick and Span, the great upholst=
erers, had sent down,=20

had been severely snubbed by Dr. Wolff; the upholsterer had submitted elabo=
rate coloured=20

pictures of his idea, his firm's idea, of what a suite of rooms should be. =
Part of that idea was sham=20

_bric-a-brac_, the rest was _carte blanche_ to Messrs. Spick and Span. "We =
should like," said that=20

well-dressed and self-satisfied individual, "to turn out a job worthy of ou=
r house's reputation and=20

that of his lordship. We should suggest that the boudoir be hung with Japan=
ese embroideries; of=20

course, there would be an Aubusson carpet, and we should cover the whole fl=
ooring"--which Mr.=20

Veneer contemptuously indicated with his umbrella--"with our patent _parque=
t_; probably a=20

mediaeval pattern would be the most suitable. We should restore the ceiling=
 and liven up the=20

mouldings with a free use of gold; in fact, my advice in the matter is, tha=
t his lordship should place=20



himself entirely in our hands. Of course, money's no object. His lordship c=
annot do better than to=20

rely upon the taste of our Mr. Spick."  "I do not think it shall be so, my =
friend," Wolff had replied.=20

"You will put fresh and pretty papers on the walls. Your hangings must be o=
f chintz, of pretty=20

chintz, and you will put a cheerful carpet on the floor. As for furniture, =
there is plenty of that here,=20

but the chairs and the sofas you shall provide; one thing only you shall re=
member--they shall be=20

comfortable. His lordship will sit in every chair; if it is not comfortable=
 it will go back. As for the=20

ceiling you shall not touch him."  Messrs. Spick and Span's representative =
was wounded in his=20

tenderest point, but his firm carried out the order to the letter. The old =
lord had sat in each chair=20

and was satisfied. The ceiling, which represented the triumph of Venus, by =
Verrio, was left=20

untouched. If we were permitted to penetrate the secret mysteries of the be=
dchamber, we should=20

make the reader's mouth water by telling of the toilet table, which was sta=
mped "Riesener," and=20

bore the mark, "_Meubles de la reine_." We should tell of the ormolu mounts=
 of the little table, and=20

how it really once belonged to Marie Antoinette. All the decorative furnitu=
re of this suite of rooms=20

had been carefully selected by the old lord from the vast accumulation of s=
uch things that Walls=20

End Castle contained. For several weeks he and Dr. Wolff had pottered about=
 the set of rooms=20

that were to be graced by Georgie's presence. When, to Wolff's astonishment=
, the priceless=20

Meissonier, "The Gray Musketeer," was selected as the one picture to adorn =
the boudoir, he=20

attempted a remonstrance.  "Nothing can be too good for her, Wolff," said t=
he earl, as he smiled=20

upon the picture.  Other rooms had been set apart for Lucy, but their arran=
gement had been left to=20

Wolff.  It was evident to the German doctor that his patron looked forward =
to his great-niece's visit=20

with pleasure. On the day of her arrival, for the first time in his life, L=
ord Pit Town failed to visit the=20

new galleries.  At dinner, Hetton himself was surprised at the amount of at=
tention paid to Georgie=20

by the head of the house. Haggard did not attempt to conceal his satisfacti=
on. Lucy Warrender,=20

ever ready for mischief, feigned an intense smoke cigarettes. Lothair felt =
it was time to go, and he=20

broke the circumstance to his friend Bertram.  These two =E2=80=9Cold fello=
ws,=E2=80=9D as they mutually described=20

each other, could not at all agree as to the course to be pursued. Bertram =
looked upon Lothair=E2=80=99s=20

suggestion as an act of desertion from himself. At their time of life, the =
claims of friendship are=20

paramount. And where could Lothair go to? And what was there to do? Nowhere=
, and nothing.=20

Whereas, if he would remain a little longer, as the duke expected and also =
the duchess, Bertram=20

would go with him anywhere he liked, and do any thing he chose. So Lothair =
remained.  In the=20

evening, seated by Lady Montairy, Lothair observed on her sister=E2=80=99s =
singing, and said, =E2=80=9CI never=20

heard any of our great singers, but I cannot believe there is a finer voice=
 in existence.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CCorisande=E2=80=99s is a fine voice,=E2=80=9D said Lady Montairy, =
=E2=80=9Cbut I admire her expression more than her tone;=20

for there are certainly many finer voices, and some day you will hear them.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut I prefer=20

expression,=E2=80=9D said Lothair very decidedly.  =E2=80=9CAh, yes! doubtl=
ess,=E2=80=9D said Lady Montairy, who was=20

working a purse, =E2=80=9Cand that=E2=80=99s what we all want, I believe; a=
t least we married daughters, they say.=20

My brother, Granville St. Aldegonde, says we are all too much alike, and th=
at Bertha St.=20

Aldegonde would be parallel if she had no sisters.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI don=
=E2=80=99t at all agree with Lord St. Aldegonde,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, with energy. =E2=80=9CI do not think it is possible to have t=
oo many relatives like you and your=20

sisters.=E2=80=9D  Lady Montairy looked up with a smile, but she did not me=
et a smiling countenance. He=20

seemed, what is called an earnest young man, this friend of her brother Ber=
tram.  At this moment=20

the duke sent swift messengers for all: to come, even the duchess, to parta=
ke in a new game just=20



arrived from Russia, some miraculous combination of billiard-balls. Some ro=
se directly, some=20

lingering a moment arranging their work, but all were in motion. Corisande =
was at the piano, and=20

disencumbering herself of some music. Lothair went up to her rather abruptl=
y:  =E2=80=9CYour singing,=E2=80=9D he=20

said, =E2=80=9Cis the finest thing I ever heard. I am so happy that I am no=
t going to leave Brentham to-

morrow. There is no place in the world that I think equal to Brentham.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd I love it, too, and no=20

other place,=E2=80=9D she replied; =E2=80=9Cand I should be quite happy if =
I never left it.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 5 Lord=20

Montairy was passionately devoted to croquet. He flattered himself that he =
was the most=20

accomplished male performer existing. He would have thought absolutely the =
most accomplished,=20

were it not for the unrivalled feats of Lady Montairy. She was the queen of=
 croquet. Her sisters=20

also used the mallet with admirable skill, but not like Georgina. Lord Mont=
airy always looked=20

forward to his summer croquet at Brentham. It was a great croquet family, t=
he Brentham family;=20

even listless Lord St. Aldegonde would sometimes play, with a cigar never o=
ut of his mouth. They=20

did not object to his smoking in the air. On the contrary, =E2=80=9Cthey ra=
ther liked it.=E2=80=9D Captain Mildmay, too,=20

was a brilliant hand, and had written a treatise on croquet=E2=80=94the bes=
t going.  There was a great=20

croquet-party one morning at Brentham. Some neighbors had been invited who =
loved the sport.=20

Mr. Blenkinsop a grave young gentleman, whose countenance never relaxed whi=
le he played, and=20

who was understood to give his mind entirely up to croquet. He was the owne=
r of the largest=20

estate in the county, and it was thought would have very much liked to have=
 allied himself with one=20

of the young ladies of the house of Brentham; but these flowers were always=
 plucked so quickly,=20

that his relations with the distinguished circle never grew more intimate t=
han croquet. He drove=20

over with some fine horses, and several cases and bags containing instrumen=
ts and weapons for=20

the fray. His sister came with him, who had forty thousand pounds, but, the=
y said, in some=20

mysterious manner dependent on his consent to her marriage; and it was adde=
d that Mr.=20

Blenkinsop would not allow his sister to marry because he would miss her so=
 much in his favorite=20

pastime. There were some other morning visitors, and one or two young curat=
es in cassocks.  It=20

seemed to Lothair a game of great deliberation and of more interest than ga=
yety, though=20

sometimes a cordial cheer, and sometimes a ringing laugh of amiable derisio=
n, notified a signal=20

triumph or a disastrous failure. But the scene was brilliant: a marvellous =
lawn, the duchess=E2=80=99s=20

Turkish tent with its rich hangings, and the players themselves, the pretti=
est of all the spectacle,=20

with their coquettish hats, and their half-veiled and half-revealed under-r=
aiment scarlet and silver,=20

or blue and gold, made up a sparkling and modish scene.  Lothair, who had l=
eft the players for a=20

while, and was regaining the lawn, met the duchess.  =E2=80=9CYour grace is=
 not going to leave us, I=20

hope?=E2=80=9D he said, rather anxiously.  =E2=80=9CFor a moment. I have lo=
ng promised to visit the new dairy; and I=20

think this a good opportunity.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wish I might be your co=
mpanion,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; and, invited, he=20

was by her grace=E2=80=99s side.  They turned into a winding walk of thick =
and fragrant shrubs, and, after a=20

while, they approached a dell, surrounded with high trees that environed it=
 with perpetual shade; in=20

the centre of the dell was apparently a Gothic shrine, fair in design and f=
inished in execution, and=20

this was the duchess=E2=80=99s new dairy. A pretty sight is a first-rate da=
iry, with its flooring of fanciful tiles,=20

and its cool and shrouded chambers, its stained windows and its marble slab=
s, and porcelain pans=20

of cream, and plenteous platters of fantastically-formed butter.  =E2=80=9C=
Mrs. Woods and her dairy-maids=20

look like a Dutch picture,=E2=80=9D said the duchess. =E2=80=9CWere you eve=
r in Holland?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have never been=20

anywhere,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYou should travel,=E2=80=9D said=
 the duchess.  =E2=80=9CI have no wish,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.=20



=E2=80=9CThe duke has given me some Coreean fowls,=E2=80=9D said the duches=
s to Mrs. Woods, when they had=20

concluded their visit. =E2=80=9CDo you think you could take care of them fo=
r me?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, Grace, I am sure I=20

will do my best; but then they are very troublesome, and I was not fortunat=
e with my Cochin. I had=20

rather they were sent to the aviary, Grace, if it were all the same.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI should so like to see the=20

aviary,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, we will go.=E2=80=9D  And th=
is rather extended their walk, and withdrew them=20

more from the great amusement of the=20


_
guileless bachelor, Mr. Haggard, of the Home Office, proved more amenable t=
o her fascinations;=20

he knew that he should get his rubber after dinner, and Miss Warrender's co=
nversation helped to=20

while away the time until what was to him the real business of life should =
commence. As for the=20

Justice he was in the best of humours, he enjoyed his dinner, he enjoyed  =
=E2=80=9CI wish your grace would=20

do me a great favor,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, abruptly breaking a rather prol=
onged silence.  =E2=80=9CAnd what is=20

that?=E2=80=9D said the duchess.  =E2=80=9CIt is a very great favor,=E2=80=
=9D repeated Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIf it be in my power to grant it,=20

its magnitude would only be an additional recommendation.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, blushing deeply,=20

and speaking with much=20


_
the indignation and despair of his unhappy brother and partner.  The girls =
sang to the old man at=20

his express desire, and Hetton noticed with a feeling of secret indignation=
 that the antiquated=20

Broadwood grand had been replaced by a magnificent Erard.  The place seemed=
 changed. Lord=20

Pit Town appreciated with mingled pleasure and astonishment the brightening=
 influence of the=20

ladies' presence; the party, if not gay, was at least cheerful; the little =
leaven had leavened the=20

whole lump. They broke up early, satisfied with themselves and with each ot=
her. But Hetton's=20

equanimity was again disturbed in the morning when his lordship actually pr=
oposed to drive Mrs.=20

Haggard and her cousin in the park. He retired in disgust to his own quarte=
rs, where he consoled=20

himself by the inspection of his betting book and the reading of his traine=
r's last report. Haggard, of=20

the Home Office, in his own room, with two packs of cards, worked out histo=
rical games of whist=20

and studied the _coups_ of Lachapelle and the other great masters. Dr. Wolf=
f walked aimlessly up=20

and down the new galleries, and stopping before Bab Chudleigh's portrait, s=
oliloquized, as is the=20

manner of =E2=80=9CI would ask your grace=E2=80=99s permission to offer my =
hand to your daughter.=E2=80=9D  The duchess I=20

looked amazed. =E2=80=9CCorisande!=E2=80=9D she exclaimed.  =E2=80=9CYes, t=
o Lady Corisande.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCorisande,=E2=80=9D replied the=20

duchess, after a pause, =E2=80=9Chas absolutely not yet entered the world. =
Corisande is a child; and=20

you=E2=80=94you, my dear friend=E2=80=94I am sure you will pardon me If I s=
ay, so=E2=80=94you are not very much older=20

than Corisande.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have no wish to enter the world,=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair, with much decision.  =E2=80=9CI am not=20

an enemy to youthful marriages,=E2=80=9D said the duchess. =E2=80=9CI marri=
ed early myself, and my children=20

married early; and I am very happy, and I hope they are; but some experienc=
e of society before=20

we settle is most desirable, and is one of the conditions, I cannot but bel=
ieve, of that felicity which=20

we all seek.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI hate society,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=
=80=9CI would never go out of my domestic circle, if it were=20

the circle I contemplate.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy dear young friend,=E2=80=9D=
 said the duchess, =E2=80=9Cyou could hardly have seen=20

enough of society to speak with so much decision.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have=
 seen quite enough of it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.=20

=E2=80=9CI went to an evening party last season=E2=80=94I came up from Chri=
stchurch on purpose for it=E2=80=94and if=20

ever they=20

f all they say be true,=20

Madame Jezebel, you were as bad a woman as lived in your bad old days. Gott=
 in Himmel! but=20

you are very like the leetel Warrender lady. God forbid the leetel lady sha=
ll have a heart like yours.=20

No, I wrong that innocent English _maedchen_. But you are both _wunderschoe=
n_. Hein!" And=20

then the doctor please.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI fear it was a stupid party,=E2=
=80=9D said the duchess, smiling, and glad to turn, if=20

possible, the conversation into a lighter vein.  =E2=80=9CNo, it was a very=
 grand party, I believe, and not=20

exactly stupid=E2=80=94it was not that; but I was disgusted with all I saw =
and all I heard. It seemed to me a=20

mass of affectation, falsehood, and malignity.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh! dear,=
