lvii. 6; lix. 3); they are "lions" (lvii. 4), dogs (lix. 6, 14). He is conscious of nothing which he has 

done to provoke this storm of hatred (lix. 3; lxiv. 4.) The "strength" of God is his hope (liv. 1; lix. 9, 

17). He is sure that retribution will fall upon the enemies (lii. 5; liv. 5; lvi. 7; lvii. 6; lix. 8-15; lxiv. 7, 

8). He vows and knows that psalms of deliverance will yet succeed these plaintive cries (lii. 9; liv.

moment. We have made a great _succes_ by means of _postiche_--there is no denying it. But we 

shall fall to pieces all of a sudden like old Lady Pimlico; and the wrinkles will appear before long in 

the national cheeks in spite of the rouge. Ah, the taunts we shall have to endure when the 

_postiche_ is discovered, from the rivals that have always been jealous and are still under the

same features, and may therefore probably be classed with these as belonging to the time of his 

exile. Such for instance are the seventh and thirty-fourth, which have both inscriptions referring 

them to this period, with others which we shall have to consider presently. The imagery us, for 

they will remember our greed and our pride and our egotism, in the days when we sold our virtue 

for gold, and our honour for a mess of pottage. Is there no one who will cry aloud in the streets 

while there is yet time?--will there not be one man in these coming elections who will have the 

courage to tell the people that their senses are so drugged by prosperity that they

Pitfalls and snares are in his path (vii. 15; xxxi. 4; xxxv. 7). He passionately protests his innocence, 

and the kindliness of his heart to his wanton foes (vii. 3-5; xvii. 3, 4); whom he has helped and 

sorrowed over in their sickness (xxxv. 13, 14)--a reference, perhaps, to his solacing Saul in his

the nation for the last few years, because it has conducted them so pleasantly along those smooth 

and flowery paths that lead to destruction? Be sure, oh my countrymen, that for you collectively, as 

well as individually, there is a broad and a narrow way, and that as surely as a nation ignores its
