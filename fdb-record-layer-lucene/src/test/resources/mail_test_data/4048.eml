in winter but in summer. Then let it lie exposed in an open place. Such sto=
ne as has been=20

damaged by the two years of exposure should be used in the foundations. The=
 rest, which=20

remains unhurt, has passed the test of nature and will endure in those part=
s of the building which=20

are above ground. This precaution should be observed, not only with dimensi=
on stone, but also=20

with the rubble which is to be used in walls.  [Illustration: Photo. Moscio=

INCERTUM. THE CIRCULAR TEMPLE AT TIVOLI]     CHAPTER VIII  METHODS OF BUILD=
ING=20

WALLS   1. There are two styles of walls: "opus reticulatum," now used by e=
verybody, and the=20

ancient style called "opus incertum." Of these, the reticulatum looks bette=
r, but its construction=20

makes it likely to crack, because its beds and builds spread out in every d=
irection. On the other=20

hand, in the opus incertum, the rubble, lying in courses and imbricated, ma=
kes a wall which,=20

though not beautiful, is stronger than the reticulatum.  2. Both kinds shou=
ld be constructed of the=20

smallest stones, so that the walls, being thoroughly puddled with the morta=
r, which is made of lime=20

and sand, may hold together longer. Since the stones used are soft and broo=
ding:  "What can you=20

expect, Pasha? I told you how it would be before. You can judge from our se=
rvants."  My wife,=20

Natalya Gavrilovna, lived on the lower storey, all the rooms of which she o=
ccupied. She slept, had=20

her meals, and received her visitors downstairs in her own rooms, and took =
not the slightest=20

interest in how I dined, or slept, or whom I saw. Our relations with one an=
other were simple and=20

not strained, but cold, empty, and dreary as relations are between people w=
ho have been so long=20

estranged, that even living under the same roof gives no semblance of nearn=
ess. There was no=20

trace now of the passionate and tormenting love--at one time sweet, at anot=
her bitter as=20

wormwood--which I had once felt for Natalya Gavrilovna. There was nothing l=
eft, either, of the=20

outbursts of the past--the loud altercations, upbraidings, complaints, and =
gusts of hatred which=20

had usually ended in my wife's going abroad or to her own people, and in my=
 sending money in=20

small but frequent instalments that I might sting her pride oftener. (My pr=
oud and sensitive wife=20

and her family live at my expense, and much as she would have liked to do s=
o, my wife could not=20

refuse my money: that afforded me=20


_
dry it up. But when there is abundance of lime and sand, the wall, containi=
ng more moisture, will=20

not soon lose its strength, for they will hold it together. But as soon as =
the moisture is sucked out=20

of the mortar by the porous rubble, and the lime and sand separate and disu=
nite, the rubble can no=20

longer adhere to them and the wall will in time become a ruin.  3. This we =
may learn from several=20

monuments in the environs of the city, which are built of marble or dimensi=
on stone, but on the=20

inside packed with masonry between the outer walls. In the course of time, =
the mortar has lost its=20

strength, which has been sucked out of it by the porousness of the rubble; =
and so the monuments=20

are tumbling down and going to pieces, with their joints loosened by the se=
ttling of the material=20

that bound them together.  4. He who wishes to avoid such a disaster should=
 leave a cavity behind=20

the facings, and on the inside build walls two feet thick, made of red my s=
orrow.) Now when we=20

chanced to meet in the corridor downstairs or in the yard, I bowed, she smi=
led graciously. We=20

spoke of the weather, said that it seemed time to put in the double windows=
, and that some one=20

with bells on their harness had driven over the dam. And at such times I re=
ad in her face: "I am=20

faithful to you and am not disgracing your good name which you think so muc=
h about; you are=20

sensible and do not worry me; we are quits."  I assured myself that my love=
 had died long ago,=20

that I was too much absorbed in my work to think seriously of my relations =
with my wife. But, alas!=20

that was only what I imagined. When my wife talked aloud downstairs I liste=
ned intently to her=20

voice, though I could not distinguish one word. When she played the piano d=
ownstairs I stood up=20

and listened. When her carriage or her saddlehorse was brought to the door,=
 I went to the window=20

and waited to see her out of the house; then I watched her get into=20
