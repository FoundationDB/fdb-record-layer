take a look."  He ran back to the engine-room and looked in. He could see the boiler plainly, as the 

place was brightly illuminated by the flames. His eyes sought the steam gage.  "Why!" he cried. 

"There are only twenty pounds of steam on! Socker took it for two hundred. There's no danger. 

That's a low pressure."  Then he raised his voice in a shout:  "Come on, fellows! Help put out the 

fire! There's no danger! The boiler's all right!"  There was an interpreted to make the maximum

Anderson had secured one. Several other students, hearing Jack's reassuring news, rushed into 

the school, and came back with pieces of hand apparatus.  "Now to douse the fire!" yelled Jack, 

again turning on the chemical stream.  "Use snow!" cried Bob Movel. "That will help!"  He scooped 

up some in a water pail that he had emptied, and tossed the mass of white crystals on the edge of 

the flames, which were in one corner of the boiler-room. There was a hissing sound, a cloud of 

steam arose, and the fire at that particular point died out.  "That's the stuff!" cried Jack, and other 

students and some of the teachers followed Bob's example. The fire was fast being gotten under 

control, and Socker, returning to the boiler-room, had attached a small hose to a faucet, and was 

playing water on the flames.  Suddenly, above the noise made by the shouting lads, the hiss of 

snow and water, and the snapping of the flames, there sounded a cry of distress.  "Help! Help! 

Help!"  "Some one is caught by the flames! They must have eaten their way up to the upper 

floors!" cried Dr. Mead.  "It iss dot boy Snaith--he und two odders!" announced Professor Garlach, 

rushing into the boiler-room, his beloved German flag clasped in his arms, where Jack had placed 

it.  "Quick! Sacre! We must not let zem perish!" added Professor Socrat, as he caught up a big fire 

shovel and dashed from the basement. "I will rescue zem!"  "Und me also," added Professor 

Garlach as he grabbed up a long poker.  "There can't be much danger," said Jack. "The fire is 

almost out. Here, Nat, you keep things moving here, and I'll take a look."  He ran out into the 

storm. Looking up at the side of the school, he saw, framed in a window, behind which a light 

burned, the figures of Dock Snaith, Pud Armstrong and Glen Forker.  "Save us! Save us!" cried 

Dock. "We can't get out."  "Catch me! I'm going to jump!" yelled Pud.  "No! no! Don't!" Jack called. 

"There's no danger. I'll come and get you!" and he dashed into the main entrance of the school. 

CHAPTER XI  THE GUN CLUB   For a few moments after Jack's disappearance into the burning 

school, the spectators, pupils and teachers hardly knew what to do or say. The thick volumes of 

smoke that rolled out, even though they knew the fire in the boiler-room was under control, 

seemed to indicate that the conflagration was raging in some other part of the building.  "Ach! Dot 

brafe Ranger fellow!" exclaimed Professor Garlach. "He vill burned be alretty yet! Ach Himmel! Der 

school will down burn!"  "So! Sacre!" exclaimed the French professor. "It iss too true, zat which 

you speak. Terrible! terrible!"  "Und dose odder boys! Der flames vill gonsume dem also!" wailed 

the German.  "But ze flags--ze flags of our countries--zey are safe!" exclaimed Professor Socrat, 

and at this thought the two former enemies threw their arms about each other.  Meanwhile, Jack 

was dashing upstairs.  "I don't see any signs of fire," he said. "I believe it's only smoke, after all." 

Up he went to the floor where Dock Snaith and his cronies had their rooms. The smoke was very 

thick, but there were no evidences of flame. And as promotion and distribution of Project

support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project 



Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely 

available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 

was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future 

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how

and calling for help, he saw that a lighted gasjet, reflecting through the clouds of vapor, had made 

it appear as if there were flames.  "Oh! will no one save us!" cried Snaith. "Fellows, I guess we're 

going to die!" and he began to whimper.  "No! no!" yelled Pud Armstrong. "Let's jump!"  "I'm--I'm 

afraid!" blubbered Snaith.  "Come on!" cried Jack, bursting into the room. "There's no danger. It's 

only smoke. The fire's 'most out."  "Are you--are you sure?" faltered Glen Forker.  "Yes. Come on! 

It's all down in the boiler-room."  Thus assured, the three bullies, who were the worst kind of 

cowards, followed Jack through the smoke-filled corridors. When the four appeared there was a 

cheer, and Professors Socrat and Garlach embraced each other again.  "It's all out!" cried Nat 

Anderson, running from the boiler-room. "Fire's all out!"  He was smoke-begrimed, and his thin 

clothing was wet through.  "Are you sure there is no more danger?" asked Dr. Mead.  "None at 

all," answered Nat.  Jack hurried up to join his chum. The snow was changing into rain, mingled 

with sleet, and it was freezing as it fell.  "Say, if I was you I'd go in," exclaimed a voice at Jack's 

elbow, and he turned to see a lad standing near him, whose lower jaw was slowly moving up and 

down, for he was chewing gum.  "Hello, Budge," said Jack. "Where have you been all this while?" 

For Budge Rankin, the odd character whom Jack had befriended by getting him the position of 

assistant janitor at Washington Hall, was clad in overcoat and cap.  "Me? Oh, I've been in town," 

answered Budge, stretching some gum out of his mouth and beginning to pull it in again by the 

simple process of winding it around his tongue.  "In town?" questioned Nat.  "Yep. 'Smynightoff." 

"Oh, it was your night off," repeated Jack, for Budge had a habit of running his words together. 

"Yep. Wow! My gum's frozen!" he exclaimed, States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is

to chew it again. "But say," he added, "if the fire's out, you'd better go inside. It's cold here." 

"You're right; it is," admitted Jack, shivering.  "Here, take my coat," spoke Budge, starting to take it 

off.  "Indeed, I'll do nothing of the sort," replied Jack. "I'll go in and get warm."  "I guess that's what 

we'd all better do," added Nat, for the wintry wind was beginning to make itself Archive
