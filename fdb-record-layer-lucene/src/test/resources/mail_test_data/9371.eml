"_The Virgin of the Magi and Chaldaeans._ The Chaldaean sphere [globe]       showed in its 

heavens a newly-born babe, called _Christ and Jesus_;       it was placed in the arms of the 

Celestial Virgin. It was to this       Virgin that Eratosthenes, the Alexandrian Librarian, born 276 

years       before our era, gave the name of Isis, mother of Horus." This is       only what Kircher 

gives (in _AEdipus AEgypticus_, iii. 5), quoting       Albumazar: "In the first decan of the Virgin 

rises a maid, called       Aderenosa, that is pure, immaculate virgin ... sitting upon an 

embroidered throne nursing a boy...; a boy, named Jessus ... which       signifies Issa, whom they 

also call Christ in Greek." (See _Isis       Unveiled_, ii. 491.)    542 Now called _St. Reine_ (Cote 

d'Or) on the two streams, the Ose and       the Oserain. Its fall is a historical fact in Keltic Gaulish 

History.    543 _Orthodoxie Maconnique_, p. 22.    544 _Op. cit._, p. 22.    545 The Christian mob 

in 389 of our era completed the work of       destruction upon what remained; most of the priceless 

works were       saved for students of Occultism, but lost to the world.    546 _Op. cit._ p. 23. J. M. 

Ragon, a Belgian by birth, and a Mason, knew       more about Occultism than any other non-

initiated writer. For fifty       years he studied the ancient Mysteries wherever he could find 

accounts of them. In 1805, he founded at Paris the Brotherhood of       _Les Trinosophes_, in 

which Lodge he delivered for years lectures on       Ancient and Modern Initiation (in 1818 and 

again in 1841), which       were published, and now are lost. Then he became the writer in chief 

of _Hermes_, a masonic paper. His best works were _La Maconnerie       Occulte_ and the 

_Fastes Initiatiques_. After his death, in 1866, a       number of his MSS. remained in the 

possession of the Grand Orient of       France. A high Mason told the writer that Ragon had 

corresponded for       years with two Orientalists in Syria and Egypt, one of whom is a       Kopt 

gentleman.    547 _Op. cit._, iv. 462.  murdered!"  "Well, cheer up!" said a loud voice from the 

staircase, which Porthos had just mounted. "We are all mortal, my poor friends."  "You are late, my 

dear Porthos."  "Yes, there were some people on the way who delayed me. The wretches were 

dancing. I took one of them by the throat and three-quarters throttled him. Just then a patrol rode 

up. Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak, so I took 

advantage of his silence to walk off."  "Have you seen D'Artagnan?"  "We got separated in the 

crowd and I could not find him again."  "Oh!" said Athos, satirically, "I saw him. He was in the front 

row of the crowd, admirably placed for seeing; and as on the whole the sight was curious, he 

probably wished to stay to the end."  "Ah Comte de la Fere," said a calm voice, though hoarse with 

running, "is it your habit to calumniate the absent?"  This reproof stung Athos to the heart, but as 

the impression produced by seeing D'Artagnan foremost in a coarse, ferocious crowd had been 

very strong, he contented himself with replying:  "I am not calumniating you, my friend. They were 

anxious about you here; I simply told them where you were. You didn't know King Charles; to you 

he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him."  So saying, he stretched out his 

hand, but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side.  "Ugh! I am 

tired," cried D'Artagnan, sitting down.  "Drink a glass of port," said Aramis; "it will refresh you." 

"Yes, let us drink," said Athos, anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with D'Artagnan, "let us drink 

and get away from this hateful country. The felucca is waiting for us, you know; let us leave to-

night, we have nothing more to do here."  "You are in a hurry, sir count," said D'Artagnan.  "But 

what would you have us to do here, now that the king is dead?"  "Go, sir count," replied 

D'Artagnan, carelessly; "you see nothing to keep you a little longer in England? Well, for my part, I, 



a bloodthirsty ruffian, who can go and stand close to a scaffold, in order to have a better

by Dr. Wilder, p. 5.     Athos turned pale. Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his 

heart.  "Ah! you remain in London?" said Porthos.  "Yes. And you?"  "Hang it!" said Porthos, a little 

perplexed between the two, "I suppose, as I came with you, I must go away with you. I can't leave 

you alone in this abominable country."  "Thanks, my worthy friend. So I have a little adventure to 

propose to you when the count is gone. I want to find out who was the man in the mask, who so 

obligingly offered to cut the king's throat."  "A man in a mask?" cried Athos. "You did not let the 

executioner escape, then?"  "The executioner is still in the cellar, where, I presume, he has had an 

interview with mine host's bottles. But you remind me. Mousqueton!"  "Sir," answered a voice from 

the depths of the earth.  "Let out your prisoner. All is over."  "But," said Athos, "who is the wretch 

that has dared to raise his hand against his king?"  "An amateur

to restrain every lust and passion, and live on the simplest diet       possible.    564 This is the Neo-

Platonic teaching adopted as a doctrine in the Roman       Catholic Church, with its worship of the 

Seven Spirits.    565 The Church has made of it the worship of devils. "Daimon" is Spirit,       and 

relates to our divine Spirit, the seventh Principle and to the       Dhyan Chohans. Jesus prohibited 

going to the temple or church "as       Pharisees do" but commanded that man should retire for 

prayer       (communion with his God) into a private closet. Is it Jesus who       would have 

countenanced in the face of the starving millions, the       building of the most gorgeous axe 

amiss."  "Did you not see his face?" asked Athos.  "He wore a mask."  "But you, Aramis, who were 

close to him?"  "I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask."  "Then it must 

be a man of a certain age."  "Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "that matters little. When one puts on a mask, 

it is not difficult to wear a beard under it."  "I am sorry I did not follow him," said Porthos.  "Well, my 

dear Porthos," said D'Artagnan, "that's the very thing it came into my head to do."  Athos 

understood all now.  "Pardon me, D'Artagnan," he said. "I have distrusted God; I could the more 

easily distrust you. Pardon me, my friend."  "We will see about that presently," said D'Artagnan,

story of the four Tanaim, who are made, in       allegorical terms, to enter into _the garden of 

delights_, _i.e._,       to be initiated into the occult and final science.        "According to the teaching 

of our holy masters the names of the four       who entered the garden of delight, are: Ben Asai, 

Ben Zoma, Acher,       and Rabbi smile.  "Well, then?" said Aramis.  "Well, while I was watching--

not the king, as monsieur le comte thinks, for I know what it is to see a man led to death, and 

though I ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill--while I was watching the 

masked executioner, the idea came to me, as I said, to find out who he was. Now, as we are wont 

to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance, as one

"Ben Asai looked and--lost his sight.        "Ben Zoma looked and--lost his reason.        "Acher 

made depredations in the plantation" (mixed up the whole and       failed). "But Akiba, who had 

entered in peace came out of it in       peace; for the saint, whose name he blessed, had said, 'This 

old man       is worthy of serving us with glory.' "        "The learned commentators of the _Talmud_, 

to aid the first, I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there; for I had seen you, Aramis, 

with the king, and you, count, I knew would be under the scaffold, and for that reason I forgive 

you," he added, offering Athos his hand, "for you must have suffered much. I was looking around 

for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken, but which, for better or worse, 

had been patched
