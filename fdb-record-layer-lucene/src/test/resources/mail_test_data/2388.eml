 the enemy's camp, his gaze as vacant as though he were unable to count up =

come so direct upon our position as the aggageers wished.  About a quarter =
of an hour passed in=20

suspense, when we suddenly heard a chorus of wild cries of excitement on th=
e other side of the=20

jungle, raised iy the aggageers, who had headed the herd, and were driving =
them back towards=20

us. In a few minutes a tremendous crashing in the jungle, accompanied by th=
e occasional shrill=20

scream of a savage elephant, and the continued shouts of the mounted aggage=
ers, assured us=20

that they were bearing down exactly upon our direction; they were apparentl=
y followed even=20

through the dense jungle by the wild and reckless Arabs. I called my men cl=
ose together, and told=20

them to stand fast, and hand me the guns quickly; and we eagerly awaited th=
e onset that rushed=20

towards us like a storm. On they came, tearing everything before them. For =
a moment the jungle=20

quivered and crashed; a second later, and, headed by an immense elephant, t=
he herd thundered=20

down upon us. The great leader came direct at me, and was received with rig=
ht and left in the=20

forehead from a Reilly No. 10 as fast as I could pull the triggers. The sho=
ck made it reel=20

backwards for an instant, and fortunately turned it and the herd likewise. =
My second rifle was=20

beautifully handed, and I made a quick right and left at the temples of two=
 fine elephants, dropping=20

them both stone-dead. At this moment after all, blood is one of the necessa=
ries of life. When he=20

had once made up his mind not to marry, he troubled his head no more about =
the girls, but turned=20

his attention to the young married women. He had beautiful bouquets sent fr=
om Vienna for Mrs.=20

Vozary, and one fine evening he let five hundred nightingales loose in Mrs.=
 Muskulyi's garden. He=20

had the greatest difficulty in getting so many together, but a bird-fancier=
 in Transylvania had=20

undertaken to send them to him. The beautiful young woman, as she turned on=
 her pillows, was=20

surprised to hear how delightfully the birds were singing in her garden tha=
t night.  He had no=20

success with the young married women either, and was beginning to get thoro=
ughly sick of life,=20

when the war broke out. They would not take him for a soldier either, they =
said he was too small=20

and thin, he would not be able to stand the fatigues of war. But he wanted =
to do something at any=20

cost.  The recruiting sergeant, who was an old friend of his, gave him the =
following advice:  "I don't=20

mind taking you if you particularly wish to work with us, but you must look=
 out for some occupation=20

with no danger attached to it. The campaign is fatiguing; we'll give you so=
mething in the writing=20

business."  Gregorics was wounded in his pride.  "I intend accepting only t=
he most dangerous=20

employment," he said; "now which do you=20
