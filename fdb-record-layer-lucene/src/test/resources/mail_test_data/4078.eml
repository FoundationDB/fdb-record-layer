I became bewildered, lost,  "Well done!" exclaimed an enthusiastic Canadian.  "But what became of your mother?" asked Morel.  "Oh! she swam ashore.  My mother was a splendid swimmer.  I know it, for she taught me."  "Was it a philodendron monstera waistcoat would not harmonise with it.

his entourage. Only those who stood opposite to His Highness, on the other side of the card table, 

declared afterwards that the Prince had frowned and that a haughty rejoinder undoubtedly 

hovered on his lips.  Be that as it may, he certainly did not show the slightest sign of ill-humour: 

quite gaily and unconcernedly he scooped up his winnings which Sir Percy Blakeney, who held the 

Bank, was at this moment pushing towards him.  "Don't go yet, M. de Kernogan," he said as the 

Frenchman made a movement to work his way out of the crowd, feeling no doubt that the 

atmosphere round him had become somewhat frigid if not exactly inimical, "don't go yet, I beg of 

you. _Pardi!_ Can't you see that you have been bringing me luck? As a rule Blakeney, who can so 

well afford to lose, has the devil's own good fortune, but to-night I have succeeded successful.  It 

was too commonplace.  Besides, in her energy she shook the branches, and that drew attention to 

the tree.  My mother thought that she was in danger then; but fortune favoured her.  It always 

favours the brave.  I know this from experience.  "She had just come to a terrific whoop in the war-

song when she slipped off her branch and the whoop increased to a death-yell as she went 

crashing headlong through the branches and down into the stream at the foot of the precipice. 

"Water! water!" exclaimed La Certe at this point, holding out both hands.  "I can never pass this 

part of my story without burning thirst!"  A mug of water was handed him.  "Poor fellow--have some 

brandy in it," said a sympathetic hearer, hastily getting out his bottle.  La Certe held out his mug 

impatiently for the brandy, drained the mug, and

of my own back from him. Do not, I entreat you, break the run of my luck by going."  "Oh, 

Monseigneur," rejoined the old courtier suavely, "how can my poor presence influence the gods, 

who of a surety always preside over your Highness' fortunes?"  "Don't attempt to explain it, my 

dear sir," quoth the Prince gaily. "I only know  "Was--was your mother killed?" asked the 

sympathiser, earnestly.  "Killed?  No.  Impossible!  My mother could not be killed because her 

destiny was not yet fulfilled.  No: there was a deep pool right under the tree.  She fell into that with 

a plunge that echoed from cliff to cliff.  The Indians were profoundly superstitious.  All

you for my losses."  "Oh! in that case, Monseigneur...."  "And with all that, Blakeney," continued 

His Highness, once more taking up the cards and turning to his friend, "remember that we still 

await your explanation as to your coming so late to the ball."  "An omission, your Royal Highness," 

rejoined Blakeney, "an absence of mind brought about by your severity, and that of Her Grace. 

The trouble was that all my calculations with regard to the exact adjustment of the butterfly bow 

were upset when I realised that the set of the so, but these Indians were.  They waited not for 

more.  They turned and fled as if all the evil spirits in the Rocky Mountains were chasing them. 

They reached their wigwams breathless, and told their squaws that one of the spirits of a mountain 

stream had sat among the branches of a tree and sung to them.  It had told them that the right 

time for attacking their foes had not yet come.  Then it sang them a war-song descriptive of their 

final victory, and, just after uttering a tremendous war-whoop, it had dived back into its native
