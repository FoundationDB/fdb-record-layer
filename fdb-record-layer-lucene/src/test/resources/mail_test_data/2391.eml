One was  Those were his happiest times, the only rays of light in his lonely life; weeks in which he could pet the boy to his heart's content. Gyuri was a favorite at school, always the first in his _
pool in which we had noticed the herd of hippopotami. Accompanied by the old howarti (hippo 

hunter), we walked quickly towards the spot: he explained to me that I must shoot the harpooned 

hippo, as we should not be able to secure him in the usual method by ropes, as nearly all our men 

were absent from camp, disposing of the dead elephants.  Upon reaching the pool, which was 

about a hundred and thirty yards in diameter, we were immediately greeted by the hippo, who 

snorted and roared as we approached, but quickly dived, and the buoyant float ran along the 

surface, directing his course in the same manner as the cork of a trimmer with a pike upon the 

hook. Several times he appeared, but, as he invariably faced us, I could not obtain a favourable 

shot; I fact of the little man making so many changes in his old age. One day he had his house in 

Besztercebanya transferred to Anna Wibra's name. And the little man was livelier and more 

contented than he had ever been in his life before. He began to pay visits again, interested himself 

in things and events, chattered and made himself agreeable to every one, dined with all his 

relations in turn, throwing out allusions and hints, such as, "After all, I can't take my money with 

me into the next world," and so on. He visited all the ladies who had refused him years ago, and 

very often went off by train, with his red umbrella under his arm, and stayed away for months and 

weeks at a time. No one troubled about him, every one said:  "I suppose the old fellow has gone

hunter round the pool, and he, swimming the river, advanced to the opposite side, and attracted 

the attention of the hippo who immediately turned towards him. This afforded me a good chance, 

and I fired a steady shot behind the ear, at about seventy yards, with a single-barrelled rifle. As 

usual with hippopotami, whether dead or alive, he disappeared beneath the water at the shot. The 

crack of the ball and the absence of any splash from the bullet told me that he was hit; the 

ambatch float remained perfectly stationary upon the surface. I watched it for some minutes--it 

never moved; several heads of hippopotami appeared and vanished in different  He never spoke 

much about his Bohemian estates, though his step-brothers were much interested in them. They 

both offered in turns to go there with him, for they had never been in Bohemia; but Gregorics 

always had an answer ready, and to tell the truth he did not seem to trouble himself much about 

the whole affair. Which was not to be wondered at, for he had no more possessions in Bohemia 

than the dirt and dust he brought home in his clothes from Carlsbad, where he spent a summer 

doing the cure.  The whole story was only trumped up to put his relations off the scent, whereas 

the truth was that he had turned all he had into money, and deposited it in

spot where the grand old bull lay dead beneath.  I shot another hippo, that I thought must be 

likewise dead; and, taking the time by my watch, I retired to the shade of a tree with Hassan, while 

Hadji Ali and the old hunter returned to camp for assistance in men and knives, &c.  In a little more 

than an hour Gyuri's inheritance would be a draft on a bank, a bit of paper which no one would 

see, which he could keep in his waistcoat pocket, and yet be a very rich man. It was well and 

carefully thought out. So he did not really go to his estates, but simply to the town where Gyuri 

was studying with his old professor.
