Advertisements upon the trees informed the traveller that the place to stop=
 at was the =E2=80=9COld Buffalo=20

Camp=E2=80=9D in San Antonio, setting forth its whisky, its perfect safety =
both for man and beast, and=20

adding curtly it was only a short four hundred miles away.  Here for the fi=

sent out a rider about half-a-mile ahead to scan the route, ascend the litt=

on =E2=80=9CIndian sign,=E2=80=9D and give us warning by a timely shot, all=

be prepared for an attack of Indians, or of the roaming bands of rascals wh=

on the plains.  Dust made us anxious, and smoke ascending in the distance s=

it was Indians, or a shepherd=E2=80=99s fire; at halting time no one straye=
d far from camp, and we sat=20

eating with our rifles by our sides, whilst men on horseback rode round the=
 mules, keeping them=20

well in sight, as shepherds watch their sheep. About two leagues from Juare=
z a traveller bloody=20

with spurring passed us carrying something in his hand; he stopped and held=
 out a long arrow with=20

an obsidian head, painted in various colours, and feathered in a peculiar w=

found it to be =E2=80=9CApache,=E2=80=9D and the man galloped on to take it=

the swiftly-running river just outside the town, at the first streak of lig=
ht; journeyed all day, still=20

hearing nothing of the retreating Mescaleros, and before evening reached La=
s Navas, which we=20

found astir, all lighted up, and knots of people talking excitedly, whilst =
in the plaza the whole=20

population seemed to be afoot.  At the long wooden tables set about with li=
ghts, where in a=20

Mexican town at sundown an al fresco meal of kid stewed in red pepper, =E2=
=80=9Ctamales=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctortillas,=E2=80=9D=20

is always laid, the talk was furious, and each man gave his opinion at the =
same time, after the=20

fashion of the Russian Mir, or as it may be that we shall yet see done duri=
ng debates in=20

Parliament, so that all men may have a chance to speak, and yet escape the =
ignominy of their=20

words being caught, set down, and used against them, after the present plan=
.  The Mescaleros=20

had been seen passing about a league outside the town.  A shepherd lying hi=
dden, watching his=20

sheep, armed with a rifle, had spied them, and reported that they had passe=
d close to him; the=20

woman coming last and carrying in her arms a little dog; and he =E2=80=9Cth=
anked God and all His holy=20

saints who had miraculously preserved his life.=E2=80=9D  After the shepher=
d=E2=80=99s story, in the afternoon firing=20

had been distinctly heard towards the small rancho of Las Crucecitas, which=
 lay about three=20

leagues further on upon the road.  All night the din of talk went on, and i=
n the morning when we=20

started on our way, full half the population went with us to the gate, all =
giving good advice; to keep=20

a good look-out, if we saw dust to be certain it was Indians driving the ho=
rses stolen from Las=20

Crucecitas, then to get off at once, corral the waggons, and above all to p=
ut our trust in God.  This=20

we agreed to do, but wondered why out of so many valiant men not one of the=
m proffered=20

assistance, or volunteered to mount his horse and ride with us along the da=
ngerous way.  The=20

road led upwards towards some foothills, set about with scrubby palms; not =
fifteen miles away=20

rose the dark mountains of the Santa Rosa chain, and on a little hill the r=
ancho stood, flat-roofed=20

and white, and seemingly not more than a short league away, so clear the li=
ght, and so immense=20

the scale of everything upon the rolling plain.  I knew that in the mountai=
ns the three Indians were=20

safe, as the whole range was Indian territory; and as I saw them struggling=
 up the slopes, the little=20

dog following them footsore, hanging down its head, or carried as the sheph=
erd said in the =E2=80=9Cshe-

devil=E2=80=99s=E2=80=9D arms, I wished them luck after their hegira, plann=
ed with such courage, carried out so well,=20



had ended, and they were back again amongst the tribe.  Just outside Crucec=
itas we met a Texan=20

who, as he told us, owned the place, and lived in =E2=80=9Ckornkewbinage wi=
th a native gal,=E2=80=9D called, as he=20

said, =E2=80=9CPastory,=E2=80=9D who it appeared of all the females he had =
ever met was the best hand to bake=20

=E2=80=9Ctortillers,=E2=80=9D and whom, had she not been a Catholic, he wou=
ld have made his wife.  All this without=20

a question on our part, and sitting sideways on his horse, scanning the cou=
ntry from the corner of=20

his eye.  He told us that he had =E2=80=9Chad right smart of an Indian trou=
ble here yesterday just about=20

afternoon.  Me and my =E2=80=98vaquerys=E2=80=99 were around looking for an=
 estray horse, just six of us, when=20

close to the ranch we popped kermash right upon three red devils, and opene=
