Solomon had composed the following somewhat startling proverb, "It is a wis=
e fellow who=20

wrenches forth the serpent's fang." Which dark saying, being interpreted, w=
as, "If you are scared=20

of anything, just trot right up and wrestle with it."  "For," continued Sol=
omon, in a speech to the=20

other five, "that's the only way to grow plucky. If you hear an odd noise, =
don't hide your head like a=20

hyena or an ostrich, whichever it is, but hunt it up. If you happen to see =
a ghost, skip up and attack=20

it."  Now the words of Solomon were always prized as gold. The boys reveren=
ced Solomon, who=20

could man, and have dispatched many a Unitario dog either to Trapalanda or =
to hell.  Ca=C3=B1a, blood,=20

"pitcher" on "the nine."  So the "babes" had made a solemn compact that if =
any one of them was=20

ever "scared," he should step boldly out and "wrench forth the serpent's fa=

 group of islands which he=20

had, as he said,=20

with shadows. Down into this cellar he had gone with a beating heart, and h=
ad forced himself to=20

search out every crack and cranny, even to the coal-bin. Of course he found=
 nothing to fear, and=20

now it was Philemon who was always ready to go down for apples in the winte=

he could snap his fingers at their shadows.  And now Romeo Augustus's turn =
had come. His poor=20

little heart was filled with dismay when he found that he was in mortal fea=
r of the clock. He felt sure=20

that he should have to search the matter to the very bottom.  For a week he=
 had and in which he=20

had opened the mines, made all the harbours, and laid out all the roads, lo=
oked to him as their=20

Providence; and to crown the work, he had had them placed under the French =
flag.  Rich,=20

requisite boldness. More than once he had marched up to the enemy, and then=
 marched back=20

again, vanquished. He dared not breathe a word to Philemon. The big letter =
=3DC=3D was all ready to=20

cling to his back, and how could he bear such disgrace? No sympathy could h=
e expect from any=20

brother. His work must be done, and done alone.  How loudly the clock calle=
