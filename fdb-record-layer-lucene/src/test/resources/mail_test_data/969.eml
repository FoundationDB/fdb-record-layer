e scale of the divine=20

harmonies. They are filled with Akasha, each with its own colour, according=
 to the state of=20

consciousness in which you are. The sixth is the pineal gland, which is hol=
low and empty during=20

life; the seventh is the whole; the fifth is the third ventricle; the fourt=
h the pituitary body. When=20

Manas is united to Atma-Buddhi, or when Atma-Buddhi is centred in Manas, it=
 acts in the three=20

higher cavities, radiating, sending forth a halo of light, and this is visi=
ble in the case of a very holy=20

person.  The cerebellum is the centre, the storehouse, of all the forces; i=
t is the Kama of the head.=20

The pineal gland corresponds to the uterus; its peduncles to the Fallopian =
tubes. The pituitary=20

body is only its servant, its torch-bearer, like the servants bearing light=
s that used to run before the=20

carriage of a princess. Man is thus androgyne so far as his head is concern=
ed.  Man contains in=20

himself every element that is found in the Universe. There is nothing in th=
e Macrocosm that is not=20

in the Microcosm. The pineal gland, as was said, is quite empty during life=
; the pituitary contains=20

various essences. The granules in the pineal gland are precipitated after d=
eath within the cavity.=20

what it is, first."  "Sir, when you have told me to obey an order did I eve=

order'?"  "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?"  "W=
hen you have cherished a=20

wish and have charged me with its fulfillment, have I ever replied, 'It is =
impossible'?"  "But a=20

request preferred with so much preparation----"  "Ah, do not fear, sir," sa=
id Mordaunt, with=20

apparent simplicity: "it will not ruin you."  "Well, then," said Cromwell, =
"I promise, as far as lies in=20

my power, to grant your request; proceed."  "Sir, two prisoners were taken =
this morning, will you=20

let me have them?"  "For their ransom? have they then offered a large one?"=
 inquired Cromwell.=20

"On the contrary, I think they are poor, sir."  "They are friends of yours,=
 then?"  "Yes, sir,"=20

exclaimed Mordaunt, "they are friends, dear friends of mine, and I would la=
y down my life for=20

them."  "Very well, Mordaunt," exclaimed Cromwell, pleased at having his op=
inion of the young=20

man raised once more; "I will give them to you; I will not even ask who the=
y are; do as you like=20

with them."  "Thank you, sir!" exclaimed Mordaunt, "thank you; my life is a=
lways at your service,=20

and should I lose it I should still owe you something; thank you; you have =
indeed repaid me=20

munificently for my services."  He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell, a=

cannot create of themselves.  Clairvoyant perception is the consciousness o=
f touch: thus reading=20

letters, psychometrizing substances, etc., may be done at the pit of the st=
omach. Every sense has=20

its consciousness, and you can have consciousness through every sense. Ther=
e may be=20

consciousness on the plane of sight, though the brain be paralyzed; the eye=
s of a paralyzed=20

person will show terror. So with the sense of hearing. Those who are physic=
ally blind, deaf or=20

dumb, are still possessed of the psychic counterparts of these senses.    W=
ill And Desire.   Eros in=20

man is the will of the genius to create great pictures, great music, things=
 that will live and serve the=20

race. It has nothing in common with the animal desire to create. Will is of=
 the Higher Manas. It is=20

the universal harmonious tendency acting by the Higher Manas. Desire is the=
 outcome of=20

separateness, aiming at the satisfaction of Self in Matter. The path opened=
 between the Higher=20

Ego and the Lower enables the Ego to act on the personal self.    Conversio=
n.   It is not true that a=20

man powerful in evil can suddenly be converted and become as powerful for g=
ood. His vehicle is=20

too defiled, and he can at best but neutralize the evil, balancing up the b=
ad Karmic causes he has=20

set in motion, at any rate for this incarnation. You cannot take a herring =
barrel and use it for attar=20

of roses: the wood is too soaked through with the drippings. When evil impu=
lses and tendencies=20

have become impressed on the physical nature, they cannot at once be revers=
ed. The molecules=20

of the body have been set in a Kamic direction, and though they have suffic=
ient intelligence to=20

discern between things on their own plane, _i.e._, to avoid things harmful =
to themselves, they=20

cannot understand a change of direction, the impulse to which is from anoth=
er plane. If they are=20

forced too violently, disease, madness or death will result.    Origines.  =
 Absolute eternal motion,=20

Parabrahman, which is nothing and everything, motion inconceivably rapid, i=
n this motion throws=20

off a film, which is Energy, Eros. It thus transforms itself to Mulaprakrit=
i, primordial Substance=20

which is still Energy. This Energy, still transforming itself in its ceasel=
ess and inconceivable=20

motion, becomes the Atom, or rather the germ of the Atom, and then it is on=
 the Third Plane.  Our=20

Manas is a Ray from the World-Soul and is withdrawn at Pralaya; "it is perh=
aps the Lower Manas=20

of Parabrahman," that is, of the Parabrahman of the manifested Universe. Th=
e first film is Energy,=20

or motion on the manifested plane; Alaya is the Third Logos, Maha-Buddhi, M=
ahat. We always=20

begin on the Third Plane; beyond that all is inconceivable. Atma is focusse=
d in Buddhi, but is=20

embodied only in Manas, these being the Spirit, Soul and Body of the Univer=
se.    Dreams.   We=20

may have evil experiences in dreams as well as good. We should, therefore, =
train ourselves so as=20

to awaken directly we tend to do wrong.  The Lower Manas is asleep in sense=
-dreams, the animal=20

consciousness being then guided towards the Astral Light by Kama; the tende=
ncy of such sense-=20

dreams is always towards the animal.  If we could remember our dreams in de=
ep sleep, then we=20

should be able to remember all our past incarnations.    Nidanas.   There a=
re twelve Nidanas,=20

exoteric and Esoteric, the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism.  So also there=
 are twelve exoteric=20

Buddhist Suttas called Nidanas, each giving one Nidana.  The Nidanas have a=
 dual meaning.=20

They are:  (1) The twelve causes of sentient existence, through the twelve =
links of subjective with=20

objective Nature, or between the subjective and objective Natures.  (2) A c=
oncatenation of causes=20

and effects.  Every cause produces an effect, and this effect becomes in it=
s turn a cause. Each of=20

these has as Upadhi (basis), one of the sub-divisions of one of the Nidanas=
, and also an effect or=20

consequence.  Both bases and effects belong to one or another Nidana, each =
having from three to=20

seventeen, eighteen and twenty-one sub-divisions.  The names of the twelve =
Nidanas are:  (1)=20



Jaramarana. (2) Jati. (3) Bhava. (4) Upadana. (5) Trishna. (6) Vedana. (7) =
Sparsha. (8)=20

Chadayatana. (9) Namarupa. (10) Vignana. (11) Samskara. (12) Avidya.(859)  =
(1) JARAMARANA,=20

lit. death in consequence of decrepitude. Notice that death and not life co=
mes as the first of the=20

Nidanas. This is the first fundamental in Buddhist Philosophy; every Atom, =
at every moment, as=20

soon as it is born begins dying.  The five Skandhas are founded on it; they=
 are its effects or=20

product. Moreover, in its turn, it is based on the five Skandhas. They are =
mutual things, one gives=20

to the other.  (2) JATI, lit. Birth.  That is to say, Birth according to on=
e of the four modes of=20

Chaturyoni (the four wombs), _viz._:  (i) Through the womb, like Mammalia. =
 (ii) Through Eggs.=20

(iii) Ethereal or liquid Germs--fish spawn, pollen, insects, etc.  (iv) Anu=
padaka--Nirmanakayas,=20

Gods, etc.  That is to say that birth takes place by one of these modes. Yo=
u must be born in one of=20

the six objective modes of existence, or in the seventh which is subjective=
. These four are within=20

six modes of existence, _viz._:  _Exoterically_:--  (i) Devas; (ii) Men; (i=
ii) the Puritan general, who=20

did not like this almost kingly homage, he took his hand and kissed it.  "W=
hat!" said Cromwell,=20

arresting him for a moment as he arose; "is there nothing more you wish? ne=
ither gold nor rank?"=20

"You have given me all you can give me, and from to-day your debt is paid."=
  And Mordaunt darted=20

out of the general's tent, his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with jo=
y.  Cromwell gazed a=20

moment after him.  "He has slain his uncle!" he murmured. "Alas! what are m=
y servants? Possibly=20

this one, who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing, has asked more in the e=
yes of Heaven than=20

those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor. Nobody serves me=
 for nothing. Charles,=20

who is my prisoner, may still have friends, but I have none!"  And with a d=
eep sigh he again sank=20

into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mordaunt.     58. Jesus Seign=
eur.   Whilst Mordaunt=20

was making his way to Cromwell's tent, D'Artagnan and Porthos had brought t=
heir prisoners to the=20

house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at Newcastle.  The =
order given by=20

Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by D'Artagnan, who accordingly, by =
an expressive=20

glance, warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution. The prisoners,=
 therefore, had=20

remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors--whi=
ch they could do=20

with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answer=
ing his own thoughts.=20

It would be impossible to describe Mousqueton's astonishment when from the =
threshold of the=20

door he saw the four friends approaching, followed by a sergeant with a doz=
en men. He rubbed=20

his eyes, doubting if he really saw before him Athos and Aramis; and forced=
 at last to yield to=20

evidence, he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he enc=
ountered a glance=20

from the eyes of Porthos, the repressive force of which he was not inclined=
 to dispute.=20

Mousqueton remained glued to the door, awaiting the explanation of this str=
ange occurrence.=20

What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acqua=
intance with one=20

another.  The house to which D'Artagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Ara=
mis was the one=20

assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession=
 on the previous=20

evening. It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear, bordering=
 on the side street,=20

stables and a sort of garden. The windows on the ground floor, according to=
 a custom in provincial=20

villages, were barred, so that they strongly resembled the windows of a pri=
son.  The two friends=20

made the prisoners enter the house first, whilst they stood at the door, de=
siring Mousqueton to=20

take the four horses to the stable.  "Why don't we go in with them?" asked =
Porthos.  "We must first=20

see what the sergeant wishes us to do," replied D'Artagnan.  The sergeant a=
nd his men took=20



possession of the little garden.  D'Artagnan asked them what they wished an=
d why they had taken=20

that position.  "We have had orders," answered the man, "to help you in tak=
ing care of your=20

prisoners."  There could be no fault to find with this arrangement; on the =
contrary, it seemed to be=20

a delicate attention, to be gratefully received; D'Artagnan, therefore, tha=
nked the man and gave=20

him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwell's health.  The sergeant answ=
ered that Puritans=20

never drank, and put the crown piece in his pocket.  "Ah!" said Porthos, "w=
hat a fearful day, my=20

dear D'Artagnan!"  "What! a fearful day, when to-day we find our friends?" =
 "Yes; but under what=20

circumstances?"  "'Tis true that our position is an awkward one; but let us=
 go in and see more=20

clearly what is to be done."  "Things look black enough," replied Porthos; =
"I understand now why=20

Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt."  "Silence!" cried th=
e Gascon; "do not utter=20

that name."  "But," argued Porthos, "I speak French and they are all Englis=
h."  D'Artagnan looked=20

at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling =
at displays of crass=20

stupidity.  But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishmen=
t, he merely pushed=20

him indoors, saying, "Let us go in."  They found Athos in profound desponde=
ncy; Aramis looked=20

first at Porthos and then at D'Artagnan, without speaking, but the latter u=
nderstood his meaningful=20

look.  "You want to know how we came here? 'Tis easily guessed. Mazarin sen=
t us with a letter to=20

General Cromwell."  "But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt, w=
hom I bade you=20

distrust?" asked Athos.  "And whom I advised you to strangle, Porthos," sai=
d Aramis.  "Mazarin=20

again. Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin. Mazarin sent us to Cromwell. There=
 is a certain fatality=20

in it."  "Yes, you are right, D'Artagnan, a fatality that will separate and=
 ruin us! So, my dear Aramis,=20

say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny."  "Zounds! on=
 the contrary, let us=20

speak about it; for it was agreed among us, once for all, that we should al=
ways hold together,=20

though engaged on opposing sides."  "Yes," added Athos, "I now ask you, D'A=
rtagnan, what side=20

you are on? Ah! behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of yo=
u. Do you know in=20

what=20


_
demons on earth; (vi) animals.  _Esoterically_:--  (i) Higher Gods; (ii) De=
vas or Pitris (all classes);=20

(iii) Nirmanakayas; (iv) Bodhisattvas; (v) Men in Myalba; (vi) Kama Rupic e=
xistences, whether of=20

men or animals, in Kama Loka or the Astral Light; (vii) Elementals (Subject=
ive degradation and his=20

murder."  "Oh! oh!" cried Porthos, "do you think so?"  "You are exaggeratin=
g, Athos; we are not so=20

far gone as that," replied the lieutenant.  "Good heavens! we are on the ve=
ry eve of it. I say, why is=20

the king taken prisoner? Those who wish to respect him as a=20


_
(3) BHAVA =3D Karmic existence, not life existence, but as a moral agent wh=
ich determines _where_=20

you will be born, _i.e._, in which of the Triloka, Bhur, Bhuvar or Svar (se=
ven Lokas in reality).  The=20

cause or Nidana of Bhava is Upadana, that is, the clinging to existence, th=
at which makes us=20

desire life in whatever form.  Its effect is Jati in one or another of the =
Triloka and under whatever=20

conditions.  Nidanas are the detailed expression of the law of Karma under =
twelve aspects; or we=20

might say the law of Karma under twelve Nidanic aspects.    Skandhas.   Ska=
ndhas are the germs=20

of life on all the seven planes of Being, and make up the totality of the s=
ubjective and objective=20

man. Every vibration we have made is a Skandha. The Skandhas are him as a s=
lave. Do you think=20

it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundr=
ed thousand pounds=20

sterling? They will kill him, you may be sure of it."  "I don't maintain th=
e contrary," said D'Artagnan.=20

"But what's that to us? I am here because I am a soldier and have to obey o=
rders--I have taken an=20

oath to obey, and I do obey; but you who have taken no such oath, why are y=
ou here and what=20

cause do you represent?"  "That most sacred in the world," said Athos; "the=
 cause of misfortune,=20

of religion, royalty. A friend, a wife, a daughter, have done us the honor =
to call us to their aid. We=20

have served them to the best of our poor means, and God will recompense the=
 will, forgive the=20

want of power. You may see matters=20
