philodendron monstera adventures at Lookout Beach, and also when they went through New England.  In succession Cora and her friends paid a visit to Cedar Lake, down on the coast, and next they spent a summer on Crystal Bay. They had there a most delightful time, but perhaps not more so than that told of in philodendron monstera adventures at Lookout Beach, and also when they went through New England.

"What in the world are you talking about?" demanded Cora, her eyes opening wide. "Slice the 

ball? What's that in? The fox trot?"  "I was speaking of golf," murmured Bess.  "She's taken it up 

to--reduce," whispered Belle.  "I thought you meant that new three-step we tried the other night," 

came from Cora.  "It's too warm even to talk about dancing," declared Belle. "Really we must think 

of getting away sooner. Do you think we could get that bungalow at Camp Surprise earlier than we 

had planned to take it, Cora?"  "I don't know. Mother made all the arrangements. But I can find 

out. Do you really think you'd like to go sooner?"  "I certainly do," murmured plump Bess, who 

seemed to feel the sudden summer heat more than did Cora, or the more svelt Belle. "Oh, by the 

way, Cora! why do they call it Camp Surprise?"  "I meant to ask that, too," added Belle. "It's such 

an odd name."  "And there's an odd story connected with it," said Cora. "I'll have to ask mother 

about it. She merely mentioned it, and something else came up so I forgot to get the particulars. I'll 

find out when we go back. But if you girls are really in earnest about starting our summer vacation 

a little earlier this year----"  "I most certainly am in earnest," Bess said.  "And I," added her sister. 

"Then I'll see what we can do," went on the girl at the wheel. "Oh dear! I wish I hadn't eaten those 

chocolates!" she exclaimed, making a wry face. "I ought to have known better. Candy always 

makes me thirsty, and I didn't bring the vacuum bottle."  Belle sat up, carefully removed, with the 

tip of her tongue, some brown chocolate stains from the tips of her pink, well-manicured fingers 

and, close, so that none of the Borders hang down; and the Cloth for the under Table, or great 

Table, must have an hole cut in the middle of it for the Spindle of the upper Table to pass thro' into 

the Brass Socket: and when this is rightly order'd, and every necessary Furniture of the great, or 

lower Table, set by every Plate; then the upper Table, which will turn, may be furnish'd with Meats. 

It remains only then, in some Places, for the Lady of the House, to offer the Soup; but after that, 

every one is at liberty to help themselves, by turning the upper Table about, to bring what they like, 

before them.     _I am Yours,_ S. G.     The Manner of killing and salting _Oxen,_ in the hottest 

Months, for the Sea, that the _Beef_ may keep good. From a Contractor with the Commissioners 

of the _Royal-Navy._  Sir,  I have often read your Books, and particularly your _Lady's Monthly 

Director,_ relating to the Management of the several Products of a Farm, but you have not taken 

notice of the Preservation of Flesh, as I expected.  I send this therefore, to inform you, that upon 

the setting out of a Fleet in _June_, it was thought difficult to salt the Beef; but it was done, to full 

Satisfaction, by the following Method.  We killed an hundred Oxen, in _June,_ towards the Close 

of the Evening, and let them hang up whole, till the next Evening: then, when the Cool comes on, 

cut out the Messes, and by every Stand have a Punchin of Brine, and throw them into it as soon 

as they are cut, and in about three Minutes after that, take them out, and salt them well. _Note_, 

These Pieces will by these means lose their bloody Parts, in great measure, and be capacitated to

"That dear little tea room--Ye Olde Spinning Wheel--is only about a mile farther on. Suppose we 

go there? I'm dying for a cup of tea with lemon in it."  "Oh, so am I!" added Bess. "They say lemon 

is thinning."  "Then you'd better have lemonade with a leaf or two of tea in it," said Belle.  "You--

you----" spluttered Bess, drawing back her hand in which nestled a chocolate. And then her desire 

to throw it was overcome by her appetite for the confection.  "Ye Olde Spinning Wheel," repeated 

Cora. "That sounds most enticing. We'll go there, if only to keep you two from bickering. What's 

gotten in you sisters to-day, I never saw you so on each other's nerves."  "It's the weather," 

returned Belle.  "Let us hope so. Well, if you've admired the view enough we'll go on."  They had 

come to a pause at the crest of a shaded hill, and down below them lay the village in which the 

three girls lived. Cheerful Chelton it had been designated, and cheerful it was.  Cora, who had not 

stopped the engine, slipped the clutch in after shifting the gear and the car moved down the slope, 

gradually cutting off the view of the town.  "What about the boys?" asked Bess, apropos of nothing 

in particular.  "What boys?" demanded Cora.  "Ours, of course," and Bess looked surprised that 

any others should have been thought of. "I mean your brother Jack, Walter Pennington and Paul 

Hastings. Didn't you say Paul was thinking of going to camp with our boys, if they took the little 

bungalow near ours at Camp Surprise?"  "Yes, Paul is coming," Cora said.  "Well, can the boys 

get away earlier if we do? It won't be any fun going there alone, particularly if there's a mystery 

about the place."  "I didn't say there was any mystery about the place," corrected Cora. "Though 

there may be. Besides, we're to have a chaperon, you know. Or at least the caretaker and his wife 

live in Camp Surprise, and I presume she will be a chaperon."  "But it won't be half the fun if the 

boys don't come along," declared Belle. "They are so jolly, and--er--well, you know what I mean," 

she finished a bit lamely.  "No need to explain at all," said Cora cheerfully. "It's perfectly all right. If 

I go, that means mother can close the house so much earlier. Jack won't stay there alone, I know, 

so he's likely to tag along."  "And if Jack goes Walter will. I guess we can count of making an 

earlier start on our vacation than we contemplated," said Bess. "It will be lovely."  "Yes," Cora 

assented.  "There's the tea room," added Belle a little later as the car came out on a long, level 

stretch of road. "It's a perfect dear of a place; isn't it?"  "A regular gazelle," agreed Cora mockingly. 

She swung her machine into the parking place provided, and a few minutes afterward the three 

girls were sitting at one of the wicker tables, in wicker chairs, near a window which opened on a 

vine-shaded porch, while electric fans hummed and droned breezily and refreshingly behind them 

and in front of them stood rose-tinted plates heaped high with pale yellow cream, nestled 

alongside of which were delicately browned macaroons.  "Oh, what a symphony of color!" 

murmured Cora, as the white-capped, colored waitress set the refreshments from off her 

mahogany-cretonne tray.  "If it tastes half as good as it looks," murmured Bess, "I'm going to have 

another plate, if I have to roll twice my usual number of times before I go to bed to-night."  "It is 

good," said Belle. "It's delicious!"  "I could just sit here and--dream," announced Belle, as 

_Memorandum,_ We had not, out of all this quantity, above three Pieces fail'd, though the 

Weather was extreme hot.    _Cheshire-_Pye with _Pork._ From Mr. _R. J._  Take some salt Loin 

of Pork, or Leg of Pork, and cut it into Pieces, like Dice, or as you would do for an Harsh. If it be 

boiled or roasted, it is no matter; then take an equal quantity of Potatoes, and pare them, and cut 

them into dice, or in slices. Make your Pye-Crust, and lay some Butter, in pieces, at the bottom, 

with some Pepper and Salt; then put in your Meat and Potatoes, with such seasoning as you like, 



but Pepper and Salt commonly, and on the Top some pieces of Butter. Then close your Pye, and 

bake it in a gentle Oven, putting in about a Pint of Water, just before it is going into the Oven; for if 

you put in your Water over Night, it will spoil your Pye.    To bake _Herrings_ in an extraordinary 

manner. From Mrs. _M. N._ of _Shrewsbury._  Take fresh Herrings, and when they are scaled and 

cleaned, put them in a glazed earthen Vessel, where they can lie straight; then put in as much of 

the following Liquor as will cover them, _viz._ an equal quantity of fine pale and old strong Beer, 

with Vinegar, which is the best, or else all Vinegar, or as some do, put two parts of Vinegar and 

one of Water; any of these will do well. Then put in some Bay-Salt, such a quantity as you think 

will season it to your mind, and to that a tenth part of Salt-Petre, which will not make it salt, but 

give it a fine relish: to these put two or three Bay-Leaves, a bunch of sweet Herbs, some Cloves, 

or _Jamaica_ Pepper, and some whole Pepper; then cover your Pan, and bake it in a quick Oven, 

with Bread. These must be eaten cold; they are excellent for a Country Breakfast, especially, if 

they are warm of the Spice, and if they are well done, the very Bones will dissolve.    To draw 

_Gravey_ for a private _Family._ From the same.  Take some fleshy part of Beef, without Fat, and 

cut it in pieces about the bigness of Pidgeons Eggs; then flour it well, and put it in a Sauce-Pan, 

with a little fresh Lard, or a little Butter, a little Onion sliced, some Powder of sweet Marjoram, and 

a little Pepper. Cover all close, and stir it now and then till the Gravey is come out enough, and 

then pour on it some Water, when the Gravey is brown, and stir all together, and let them boil 

some time; then strain it off, adding a little Lemon-Juice.    Another _Gravey,_ for a private Family, 

where there is not an opportunity of getting _Beef_ to make it of.  Take some Butter, and some 

Onion, cut small, put it in a Sauce-Pan, and set it over the Fire till the Butter melts; then drudge in 

some Flour, and stir it well, till the Froth sinks down, and then it will be brown; you must then have 

ready prepared the following Mixture to throw in, _viz._ some good old Beer, and as much Water, 

an Onion cut small, some Pepper and Salt, a small Anchovy shred, a little Lemon-Peel grated, a 

Clove or two, and, if you have it, a little Mushroom Liquor, or Liquor of pickled Walnuts; then let 

them all simmer together a little while, and it will produce a thick good Gravey.    The Manner of 

Trussing a _Rabbit_ for Boiling.  [Illustration: Fig. 1]  Cut the two Haunches of the Rabbit close by 

the Back-Bone, two Inches, and turn up the Haunches, by the Sides of the Rabbit; skewer the 

Haunches through the lower Part of the Back, as at A; then put a Skewer through the utmost Joint 

of the Leg at B, and so through the Body, and through the other Leg, so

"effective" eyes, as Jack Kimball had designated them.  "Yes, it is very soothing and restful," 

agreed her sister, who had been rendered sleepy by the combination of heat, a refreshing meal 

and the droning of the electric fans.  "I feel sleepy myself," Cora confessed, closing her eyes.  She 

opened them a moment later though, for a cry from Belle brought her and Bess to a most 

unpleasant awakening.  "Your car, Cora!" cried the slim Robinson twin. "Some one is taking your 

auto!"     CHAPTER II--THE LOST TRAIL   "My car! Some one taking my car!" repeated Cora 

Kimball. "Who is it, Belle?" and she hurried to the window from which the tall, willowy Robinson 

twin was gazing toward the spot where the auto had been left.  "Two young men. I saw them get 

in, and--there they go! Out into the road! We must stop them!"  Belle turned to make her exit, but 

her dress caught on a chair, and as Cora and Bess were behind her, they, too, were delayed. 

"Oh, hurry!" begged Cora.  "I can't tear my dress," retorted Belle.  With a pull she loosed it from a 

splinter of the wicker chair, and then made for the doorway, followed by the other girls.  And while 

they are thus on their way to intercept those who had taken Cora's car I will devote a few minutes 

to acquainting my new readers with the characters and incidents that go to make the previous 

volumes of this series.  "The Motor Girls," was the title of the initial book. In that we find Cora 

Kimball, the daughter of a wealthy widow, with her brother Jack, living in "Cheerful Chelton," as it 

has been called, a village on the Chelton river, in New England, not far from the New York 

boundary. Cora and Jack each had an automobile, but most of the adventures took place in or 

about Cora's car, in which she and her two most intimate chums, the Robinson twins--Bess and 

Belle--went for many a ride.  The Robinson girls were the daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Perry 

Robinson, the former a rich railroad man, and I think I have already sufficiently indicated to you 

their characters. Bess was plump, and Belle tall and willowy, inclined to indolence which she 

imagined was graceful. truss up the Shoulders high, and let the Pinnions be carried back, to take 

the Legs at B, and lie between them and the Body; and under the height of the Pinnions, put a 

Skewer, and bend the Neck backwards, and pass the Skewer through all, at C, so that it supports 

the Blade-Bone, and holds the Head up.    The Manner of Trussing a Single _Rabbit_ for 

Roasting. From Mr. _W. N._ Poulterer.  [Illustration: Fig, 2 ]  You case the Rabbit all, excepting the 

lower Joints of the four Legs, and those you chop off: then pass a Skewer through the middle of 

the Haunches, after you have laid them flat, as at A; and the Fore-Legs, which are called the 

Wings, must be turn'd, as at B; so that the smaller Joint may be push'd into the Body, through the 

Ribs. This, as a single Rabbit, has the Spit pass'd through the Body and Head, but the Skewer 

takes hold of the Spit to preserve the Haunches. But to truss a couple of Rabbits, there are seven 

Skewers, and then the Spit passes only between the Skewers, without touching the Rabbits.    To 

make a _Pheasant_ of a _Rabbit,_ truss'd in such a manner, that it will appear like a _Pheasant,_ 

and eat like one, with its Sauce. This is called, by the topping _Poulterers,_ a _Poland-Chicken,_ 

or a _Portugal-Chicken._ But it is most like a _Pheasant,_ if it is larded. From Mrs. _Johnson,_ at 

the famous Eating-House in _Devereux-Court_ near the _Temple._  [Illustration: Fig. 3]  Take a 

young Rabbit full grown; case it all, excepting the Fore-Feet, chop off them, and the Head, as 

close as may be, but strip the Skin from the hind Legs, even to leave the Claws on them. These 

Claws are not unlike the Claws of a Pheasant, and some good Judges may be deceiv'd by their 

first Look, for they are little different from the Legs of the Fowls we design to imitate. Then turn the 

Neck-part of the Rabbit, the Breast inwards, to the Scut or the Rump, leaving the Rump somewhat 



short, but to appear; then will the Rabbit appear in the Shape above, _viz._ B is the Scut, or 

Rump, of the Rabbit, and C is where the Neck comes; then will the Part mark'd F, appear like the 

Breast of a Fowl: but you

Kimball was a leader, and where she went the Robinson twins generally followed.  Jack Kimball, a 

student at Exmouth college, was almost as much a chum of Cora's as were her girl friends, and 

the girls regarded Jack and his chums, Walter Pennington and Paul Hastings, as their especial 

retainers and vassals as the case demanded. Paul's sister Hazel, a sweet Rabbit, over each side

another city. Hazel was expected for a visit to Cora soon, and, as has been mentioned, Paul

induced their father to purchase one. The Motor Girls, as they had come to be known, went on a
