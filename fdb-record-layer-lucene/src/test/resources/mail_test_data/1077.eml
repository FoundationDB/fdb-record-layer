 of thorns he could not doubt, since every step in it would widen the breac=

r last dive!"  "Ay, ay!" returned Louis.  "I beg you, Captain Scott, not to=

air was blue in the Transcontinental Chicago offices when the news got ther=
e."  "What do you=20

suppose McVickar will do?" asked the other.  "He will do anything the senat=
or wants him to--he's=20

got to. Blount is land hungry, and I guess he'll take a few more sections o=
f the railroad mesa-land=20

under the Clearwater ditch. That was what he did two years ago when McVicka=
r wanted the right=20

of way for the branch through Carnadine County."  "Don't you believe he's g=
oing to take any little=20

Christmas gift this time!" was the rasping reply. "He'll sell the railroad =
something, and take good=20

hard money for it. It's a cinch. The railroad can't afford to have the cour=
ts against it, and McVickar=20

will be made to nothing to save the steamer, and they had abandoned her. Th=
e other boat=20

presently came out from the farther side of the vessel, and it contained on=
ly seven persons, from=20

which it appeared that the Fatime's ship's company consisted of only sevent=
een men, unless=20

some of them had been killed or wounded, and left on board.  "This looks li=
ke the end of the=20

Fatime, and I don't believe she will give us any further trouble in our voy=
age, wherever we may=20

go," said Captain Scott, while all hands were watching the passage of the t=
wo boats to the shore.=20

"But why don't she sink?" asked Louis.  "Though that is a big hole in her s=
ide, the most of it was=20

above water in the first of it, and the brine did not=20


_
this heat. You watch the wheels go round when McVickar comes out here."  Ev=
an Blount found=20

himself growing strangely sick and faint. Could it be his father whom they =
were thus calmly=20

accusing of graft and trickery and blackmailing methods too despicable to b=
e imagined? His first=20

impulse was to confront the two; to demand proofs; to do and say what a loy=
al son should. But the=20

crushing conviction that they were discussing only well-known and well-assu=
red facts unnerved=20

him; and after that he was anxious for only one thing--that they might fini=
sh their cigars and go=20

away without discovering him.  Fate was kind to him thus far. After a littl=
e further talk, in which the=20

accepted point of view of the on looker at the great game was made still mo=
re painfully evident for=20

the unwilling listener, the is settling very fast now, and it is a question=
 of only a few minutes with=20

her now," replied the captain, as he rang three bells upon the gong in the =
engine-room to back=20

her. "We are rather too near her if she makes much of a stir-about when she=
 goes down."  "Help!=20

Help! Save me! Save me!" came in rather feeble tones from the wreck of the =
Fatime.  At the same=20

time the form of a man was seen staggering to the end of the bridge.  "That=
's Captain Mazagan!"=20

shouted Felix from the forecastle.  "Mazagan!" exclaimed Louis.  "Shall we =
do anything for that=20

man, Captain Scott?" asked Don, coming to the front windows of the pilot-ho=
use. "If we do, it must=20

be done in a hurry, for that craft is going to the bottom in less than two =
minutes."  "Of course we=20

shall save him," replied the captain, looking at=20


_
For a long time after they had gone, Blount sat crumpled in the depths of t=
he big chair, chewing his=20

extinct cigar and staring absently at the row of books on a level with his =
eyes in the opposite case.=20

One clear thought, and one only, came out of the sorrowful confusion: not f=
or any inducement that=20

could now be offered would he lend himself to the furtherance of his father=
's plans. Beyond this he=20

did not reason in the miserable hour wrought out in the quiet of the club  =
"Certainly, we must save=20

him!" added Louis with an earnestness that impressed his companion. "Don't =
let us forget that we=20

are Christians at such a moment as this! How shall it be done, Captain? Giv=
e your orders, and=20

count me in as the first volunteer."  "Get the boat into the water, Morris!=
 Be lively about it. Louis=20

and Felix will go in it to save this man if they can," replied the captain.=
  The boat on the hurricane=20

deck was a small and light one, and the first officer=20


_
But when he got up to go, another prompting was forcing its way to the surf=
ace--a prompting to=20

throw himself boldly into the scale against graft and chicanery; to redeem =
at any cost, and by=20

whatsoever means might offer, the good old name which had been so Felix lea=
ped into it, and in=20

another instant they were pulling for the wreck. It was a smooth sea, and t=
he distance was not=20

more than fifty feet; for the captain had rung to stop the backward motion =
as soon as the cry from=20

the survivor reached his ears.=20
