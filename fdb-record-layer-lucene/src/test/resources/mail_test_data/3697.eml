lovingly heaped together at the beginning are in part echoed in the close. "The Lord liveth, and 

blessed is my rock, and the God of my salvation is exalted." His deliverances have taught him to 

know a living God, swift to hear, active to help, in whom he lives, who has magnified His own 

name in that He has saved His servant. And as that blessed conviction is the sum of all his 

experience, so one glad vow expresses all his resolves, and thrills with the expectation which he 

had cherished even in his lonely exile, that the music of his psalm would one day echo through all 

the world. With lofty consciousness of his new dignity, and with lowly sense that it is God's gift, he 

emphatically names himself _His_ king, _His_ anointed, taking, as it were, his crown from his 

brows and laying it on the altar. With prophetic eye he looks onward, and sees the throne to which 

he had been led by a series of miracles enduring for ever, and the mercy of God sustaining the 

dominion of his house through all generations:--    (49) "Therefore will I give thanks to Thee among 

the nations, O          Jehovah,         And to Thy name will I strike the harp:    (50)  Who maketh 

great the deliverances of His king         And executeth mercy for His anointed,         For David and 

his seed for evermore."  And what were his purposes for the future? Here is his answer, in a psalm 

which has been with considerable appropriateness regarded as a kind of manifesto of the 

principles which he intended should characterize his reign (Psa. ci.): "I will walk within my house 

with a perfect heart. I will have done, and may he share it with you, and support you in the lifelong 

trial it must involve, and in the ridicule to which you will both be exposed. For myself, I go to seek it 

where I am told I shall alone find it." I placed her hand in Grandon's, kissed her mother on the 

forehead, and hurried from the room. Then the strain on my nervous system suddenly relaxed. I 

am conscious of Drippings helping me into a cab, and going with me to Piccadilly, and of one 

coming in and finding me stretched on my bed, and of his lifting me from it by a single touch, just 

as Drippings was going off in quest of the doctor. It was he who had met me that night when I was 

walking with Broadhem, but his name I am unable to divulge. "Stay here, my friend," he said to 

Drippings, "and pack your master's things: there is no need for the doctor; I will take him to 

America." And my heart leaped within me, for its predictions were verified, and the path lay clear 

before me.  And now, on this last night in England, as I pen the last lines of this record of my life 

during the six months that are past, and look back to the spirit in which it was begun, and examine 

the influences which impelled me to write as I have, I see that I too have undergone a change, and 

that the time has come when, if I wished, I can no more descant as heretofore on the faults and 

foibles of the day. Among those who have read me there may be some who have so well 

understood, that they will see why this is so. If in what I have said I have hurt the feelings of any 

man or woman in my desire to expose the vices of society

himself, he begins his reign with noble self-restraint, not meaning to make it a region of 

indulgence, but feeling that there is a law above his will, of which he is only the servant, and 

knowing that if his people and his public life are to be what they should be, his own personal and 

domestic life must be pure. As for his court and his ministers, he will make a clean sweep of the 

vermin who swarm and sting and buzz about a throne. The froward, the wicked, privy slanderers, 

proud at large, they will be of those who have failed to detect why I have said thus much, and 

needs must stop here; but none the less earnestly would I assure them that it has been against my 

will and intention to wound any one. As I began because I could not help it, so I end because I am 

obliged. My task is done. The seed which I found in my hand, such as it was, I have sown. 

Whether it rots and dies in the ground, or springs up and brings forth fruit, is a matter in which I 

cannot,
