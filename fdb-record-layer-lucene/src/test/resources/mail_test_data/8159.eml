philodendron monstera twenty-five dollars a week I 've got to have a chance=
 to show what I can do further.  Take me out of the cage."  "Skinner," said=
 McLaughlin, "you didn't for a minute think that we were going to keep a ma=
n that could pull off such a trick as that in a cage, did you?  We're going=
 to make you a salesman."  The idea of going on the road did n't appeal to =
Skinner.  "To be frank, Mr. McLaughlin, I want something better than rumour=
 of what had transpired had begun to blow about the place, there were not a=
s yet many gazers. By-and-by, as he stood outside, his master came out, wit=

  Take me out of the cage."  "Skinner," said McLaughlin, "you didn't for a =
minute think that we were going to keep a man that could pull off such a tr=
ick as that in a cage, did you?  We're going to make you a salesman."  The =
idea of going on the road did n't appeal to Skinner.  "To be frank, Mr. McL=
aughlin, I want something better than rumour of what had transpired had beg=
un to blow about the place, there were not as yet many gazers. By-and-by, a=
s he stood outside, his master came out, with one of the emissaries of the =
morning close by him, and Beaufort behind. John Erskine was pale; but there=
 was a sort of smile on his face--a smile which had no pleasure in it, but =
some contempt, and that sort of outward looking to heaven and earth, with t=
he head held _
than it had beaten for years, for he was a man that had always had his own =
way, and was not=20

given to argument or diplomatic finessing.  Having shot his bolt, Jackson w=
aited.  Skinner turned in=20

his chair.  "That's mighty good of you, old chap," he said cordially.  "You=
're just like these other=20

hospitable Westerners. You've bragged about your cook and you want to show =
me that you can=20

make good.  But I'll let you off--I'll take your word for it this time."  "=
I don't want you to take my word=20

for it," Jackson retorted.  "Besides, I'd like to have your wife meet my wi=
fe!"  "So would I," said=20

Skinner.  He paused a moment.  Right here was the bit of humble pie that Ja=
ckson had prepared=20

to eat, if necessary, but taken from the hand of a cordial fellow like Skin=
ner, it would n't be so hard,=20

after all.  "Skinner, you 're a good fellow--so am I a good fellow.  I like=
 you. There's no reason why=20

we should n't be friends--personally--you understand."  "Mr. Jackson," said=
 Skinner, "you're a frank=20

man.  I'm going to be frank with you.  I don't feel that it would be loyal =
to my firm if I should accept=20

your hospitality, under the circumstances.  It's all well enough to be impe=
rsonal, separate business=20

life from social life but"--and here he began to butter the humble pie that=
 he had felt it to be=20

inevitable that Jackson should eat--"you stood mighty well with our house. =
 You've got a great=20

reputation.  It was most important to us. We did everything we could to ple=
ase you.  After the=20

break came, we went the limit in the way of eating humble pie to get you ba=
ck again. But you set=20

your face against us hard.  I might even waive that, but just you look at i=
t yourself."  Skinner=20

laughed.  "You know you did n't treat McLaughlin very well--and the curious=
 part was, McLaughlin=20

was always very fond of you personally."  At the last words Jackson capitul=
ated.  "See here, you=20

and the Missus come out to dinner to-morrow night and we'll talk things ove=
r."  Skinner hesitated.=20

"I've thought this all out," said Jackson.  "The Starr-Bacon folks have bee=
n figuring on that bunch=20

of machinery that I'm going to get in. Here's what they say.  Can you meet =
those figures?"  Skinner=20

looked over the memorandum Jackson handed him and made a quick calculation.=
  "Yes," said he,=20

"we can meet them."  "The order is yours."  "I won't take it," said Skinner=
, "unless you throw in that=20

trout dinner."  That night Skinner wired McLaughlin and Perkins, Inc., that=
 he'd caught the bear=20

and Janet would have understood to be prepared for your luncheon. And what'=
s your business in=20

the Town-house this fine morning, and with strange company?" Miss Barbara s=
aid. She cast a=20

keen glance at the man, who stood aside respectfully enough, and yet, backe=
d by his assistant,=20

kept a watchful eye on John.  "I am afraid I cannot wait to tell you now. I=
t is not pleasant business,"=20

John said.  "Come round here," said the old lady, imperiously; "can I keep =
on skreighing to you=20

before all the town? Come round here." Her keen eyes took in the whole scen=
e: John's glance at=20

his grave companion, the most imperceptible gesture with which that person =
made way for him.=20

Miss Barbara's perceptions were keen. She gripped her nephew by the arm. "J=
ohn Erskine, have=20

ye done anything to bring ye within the power of the law?"  "Nothing," he s=
aid firmly, meeting her=20

eye.  "Then what does that man mean glowering at you? Lord guide us! what i=
s it, boy? It cannot=20

be money, for money has none of these penalties now."  "It is not money--no=
r anything worth a=20

thought."  "Mr Erskine," said the officer, civilly, "the sheriff is waiting=
." And after that, there was no=20

more to be said.     CHAPTER XXXIII.   Rolls went up-stairs and dressed him=
self in his best--his=20

"blacks," which he kept for going to funerals and other solemnities--not th=
e dress in which he=20

waited at table and did his ordinary business. The coat, with its broad, sq=
uare tails, gave him an=20

appearance something between that of a respectable farmer and a parish mini=
ster--a little too=20

solemn for the one, too secular for the other; and to show that he was "his=
 own man," and for to-



day at least no man's servant, he enveloped his throat in a large black sil=
k neckerchief, square in=20

shape, and folded like a substantial bandage with a little bow in the front=
. His forehead was lined=20

with thought. When he had finished his toilet, he opened the large wooden "=
kist" which stood in a=20

corner of his room, and was the final receptacle of all his worldly goods. =
Out of that he took a blue-

spotted handkerchief, in which a pocket-book was carefully wrapped up, and =
took from it a few=20

somewhat dirty pound-notes. Then restoring the pocket-book, he locked the k=
ist carefully, and=20

went down-stairs with the key--a very large one--in his hand. This he gave =
to Bauby, who still hung=20

about the door with her apron to her eyes. "You should go ben to your work,=
 my woman," said=20

Rolls, "and no make the worst of what's happened: in a'=20


_
fattest order that that concern had had for many a day.  Then he jotted dow=
n in his little book:--=20

_Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_  =
                                    Landed one=20

curmudgeon!                                      Bait used--domestic       =
                              tranquillity!=20

Method--did n't use any!                                     Just stood off=
 and waited,=20

and he landed himself.     CHAPTER XI  THE OSTRICH FEATHER  When Skinner en=
tered the=20

office of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc., two days later, he found that the par=
tners had arranged a=20

reception committee of two to welcome him.  Both shook hands cordially and =
McLaughlin said,=20

"Skinner, we're not only convinced that you're a thoroughly honest and meth=
odical man"--he=20

glanced knowingly at Perking--"but that you're a very able man as well. We-=
-"  Skinner cut him=20

short.  "Mr. McLaughlin, do I get the ostrich feather?"  "You do, indeed,--=
and I'm only sorry that the=20

great auk is dead!"  Skinner blushed.  "You don't know how good you 've mad=
e me feel, really you=20

don't--giving me this chance to show what I could do."  "You had your chanc=
e and you showed=20

what you could do, all right," McLaughlin broke in.  He paused, then, "Now,=
 tell us, Skinner, how=20

did you do it?"  Skinner hesitated.  "I'd rather not."  "Why?" said McLaugh=
lin.  "Ain't you got it=20

patented?"  "Secret process," said Skinner.  "It's more than that, it's an =
_effective_ process.  But=20

what's important to us, Skinner, is--could you work it on other folks besid=
es Jackson?"  "Yes--that=20

is, most other men--middle-aged men."  "Why middle-aged men?"  "Because the=
y're married--

most middle-aged men are."  McLaughlin turned to Perkins.  "I'm darned if h=
e ain't gone and=20

mashed the climber.  That's what I think!"  Skinner thrust his hands into h=
is pockets, walked over=20

to the window, then turned and slowly came back to within a few feet of whe=
re McLaughlin was=20

sitting.  "On my way back from St. Paul, Mr. McLaughlin," he said--and Perk=
ins, recognizing the=20

premonitory symptoms, crossed to the window and stood with his back to his =
partner and "the=20

cage man"--"Mr. McLaughlin," Skinner repeated after a pause, "I've been thi=
nking that the most=20

valuable man to any concern is the one that gets the business for it."  "Ri=
ght-o!" said McLaughlin.=20

"And the hardest man to get," Skinner went on, "is the customer you get bac=
k.  You not only have=20

to pry him loose from some other concern with better figures, but you have =
his personal pride to=20

overcome.  To come ready." "Do you think that, Tammas? do you really think =
that?" cried Bauby,=20

brightening up and showing symptoms of an inclination to cry for joy as she=
 had done for sorrow.=20

"I'm no' saying what I think. I'm thinking mony things beyond the power o' =
a woman person to=20

faddom," said Rolls, solemnly. "And if the maister should be back, it's rea=
l possible I mayna be=20

back. You'll just behave conformably, and put forrit Marget. If she wasna s=
o frightened, she's no' a=20

bad notion at a' of waiting at table. And if there's ony question where I a=
m, or what's become of=20

me----"  "Oh, Tammas, what will I say? It will be the second time in a week=
. He'll no' like it," cried=20

Bauby, diverted from one trouble to another. The absence of her brother whe=
n the dinner was=20

ready was almost as extraordinary as her master's conveyance away to unknow=
n dangers by the=20

functionaries of the law.  "If he's here to be angry, a' will be well," sai=
d Rolls, grimly; and then he=20

handed her the key. "If there should be any question about me, when I'm no'=
, here to answer for=20

myself, you'll inform whoever it concerns that the kist is yours and everyt=
hing in it, in proof of which=20

you'll produce the key. That's no' to say but what you'll respect the bits =
of things in it, and hand me=20

back possession when I come, soon or late," said Rolls. "You'll mind what I=
 say to you, Bauby. It's=20

yours in the one case, but no' in the other. You'll take possession if ther=
e is ony other claimant; but=20

me being back, you'll respect my rights."  "I wuss I would ken what you mea=
nt first," said Bauby,=20



gazing at him wistfully. Rolls had an air of satisfaction on his face for t=
he first time: he was pleased=20

to have puzzled her. His face relaxed almost into a smile as he said, "Acco=
rding to a' probabilities,=20

you'll soon understand that."  With these words he set out from the hall-do=
or, walking very=20

deliberately, and crushing the pebbles under his feet at every step. He had=
 taken his best silk=20

umbrella, which, loosened from its habitual folds, and used as a stick, mad=
e a sort of flapping=20

accompaniment to his progress, like a large bird walking by him. As he turn=
ed from the door the=20

solemnity of his aspect returned. He walked slowly, thinking as he went--th=
inking so profoundly=20

that he scarcely saw Peggy at the lodge, and passed her, taking no notice o=
f her in the gravity of=20

his preoccupation. She said afterwards that it was awfu' evident he had som=
ething on his mind.=20

She told Jean Tamson, who was in the lodge at the moment--come for a crack,=
 and talking of=20

nothing else but this very subject,--"I wouldna wonder," she said, "but Mr =
Rolls kens more about it=20

than any of=20


_
"All of which means that you expect a raise, eh, Skinner?"  "I was only goi=
ng to suggest--"  "You=20

don't have to suggest.  We've already decided to raise you twenty-five doll=
ars a week.  How does=20

that strike you?  Just as a mark of appreciation."  "I can't see any apprec=
iation in it unless you take=20

me out of the cage--for this reason," said Skinner.  "As a 'cage man' I'm n=
ot worth much more than=20

I 've been getting.  In order to said to her gossip when all was known.  It=
 was four miles to=20

Dunearn; but old Rolls was a steady, good walker, with no irregularity abou=
t him. Every step he=20

took was just of the same length as the step before. Yard for yard he did h=
is four miles in the=20

regulated time, neither shorter nor longer. When he arrived at the Town-hou=
se, there was a little=20

flutter about the door as of people dispersing; but there had not been any =
number=20
