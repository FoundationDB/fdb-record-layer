Then the next day=20

they arose and made a smiting[10], and in   the fray Harald was shot by a D=
ane, and perhaps by=20

his son's   command. Then brought the Wollyners him to their ships, and   c=
arried him away to=20

their city that there they might doctor   (_artzten_) him. But he died of t=
he wound, and was buried=20

there,   after he had reigned about fifty years, about the thousandth year =
  after the birth of Christ.=20

So writeth Saxo. But Helmold writes,   that he came to Vineta: these holp h=
im into his kingdom=20

again,   and when he was shot in the skirmish, they brought him back to   t=
heir town, where he=20

died[11] and was buried. And that I myself   believe; for though Wollyn was=
 a mighty state at that=20

time, still   Vineta was much mightier; and it is therefore to be concluded=
 that   he fled to Vineta,=20

rather than to Wollyn, and that Vineta was on   that account afterwards des=
troyed: and as we are=20

come to Vineta,   we will say what Helmold writes thereof, which is this:--=
    [Footnote 10: I have in=20

the translation adopted the phrase of Holy   Writ, "made a smiting."]    [F=
ootnote 11: This shows=20

that the MSS. of Helmold were corrupted   at a very early period. I have se=
en one uncorrupted. A=20

list of   them would be a thing desirable.]    "Vineta has been a powerful =
city, with a good harbour=20

for the   surrounding nations; and after so much has been told of the city =
  which is totally (_schyr_=20

=3D sheerly) incredible, I will relate   this much. It is said to have been=
 as great a city as any which=20

Europe contained at that time, and it was promiscuously inhabited   by Gree=
ks, Slavonians,=20

Wends, and other nations. The Saxons, also,   upon condition of not openly =
practising Christianity,=20

were   permitted to inhabit with them; for all the citizens were   idolater=
s down to the final=20

destruction and fall of the city. Yet   in customs, manners, and hospitalit=
y there is not a more=20

worthy   nation, or so worthy a one, to be found. The city was full of all =
  sorts of merchandise=20

(_kaufwahr_) from all countries, and had   everything which was curious, lu=
xurious (_lustig_ =3D=20

lustful), and   necessary; and a king of Denmark destroyed them a great fle=
et of   war. The ruins=20

and recollection of the town remain even to this   day, and the island on w=
hich it lay is flowed=20

round by three   streams, of which one is of a green colour, the other grey=
ish, and   the third=20

dashes and rushes by reason of storm and wind. And so   far Helmold, who wr=
ote about 400 years=20

ago.    "And it is true that the remains exist at the present day: for   wh=
en one desires to go from=20

Wolgast over the Pene, in the country   of Usedom, and comes by a village c=
alled Damerow,=20

which is by   [about] two miles[12] from Wolgast, so sees one about a long =
  quarter way into the=20

sea (for the ocean has encroached upon the   land so much since then), grea=
t stones and=20

foundations. So have I   with others rowed thither, and have carefully look=
ed at it. But no=20

brickwork is there now; for it is so many hundred years since the   destruc=
tion of the city, that it is=20

impossible that it can have   remained so long in the stormy sea. Yet the g=
reat   foundation-stones=20

are there still, and lie in a row, as they are   usually disposed under a h=
ouse, one by the other; and=20

in some   places others upon them. Among these stones are some so great, in=
   three or four=20

places, that they reach ell high above the water; so   that it is conjectur=
ed that their churches or=20

assembly-houses   stood there. But the other stones, as they still lie in t=
he order   in which they lay=20

under the buildings (_geben_), show also   manifestly how the streets went =
through the length and=20

breadth   (_in die lenge und uebers quer_) of the city. And the fishermen o=
f   the place told us that=20

still whole paving-stones of the streets   lay there, and were covered with=
 moss[13]=20

(_uebermoset_), so that   they could not be seen; yet if one pricked therei=
n with a   sharp-pointed=20

pole or lance, they were easily to be felt. And the   stones lay somehow af=
ter that manner: and as=20



we rowed backward and   forward over the foundations, and remarked the fash=
ion of the   streets,=20

saw we that the town was built lengthways from east to   west. But the sea =
deepens the farther we=20

go, so that we could not   perceive the greatness of the city fully; but wh=
at we could see,   made us=20

think that it was very probably of about the size of   Luebeck: for it was =
about a short quarter[14]=20

long, and the breadth   broader than the conversation.  Another thing that =
a guest must avoid is=20

reproving the children of the house in even the mildest, gentlest way. She =
must also resist the=20

impulse to make an audible excuse for a child when he is reprimanded in her=
 presence. To do=20

either of these things is a breach of etiquette.         *       *       * =

END PARTY]  If she be so fortunate as to be invited to a house-party or a w=
eek-end party, she=20

should accept or decline at once, that the hostess may know for how many pe=
ople to provide=20

rooms. For such an affair one should take handsome gowns, as a good deal of=
 festivity and dress=20

is customary among the jolly group thus brought together. A dinner or eveni=
ng gown is essential,=20

and if, as is customary, the house-party be given at a country-home, the vi=
sitor must have a short=20

walking-skirt and walking-boots, as well as a carriage costume.  Once a mem=
ber of a house-party,=20

the rule is simple enough. Do as the others do, and enter with a will on al=
l the entertainment=20

provided by the host and hostess for the party.         *       *       *  =

QUESTION OF TIPS]  If you make a visit of any length you must not fail, if =
you are conventional,=20

to leave a little money for each servant who has, by her services in any ca=
pacity, contributed to=20

your comfort. This will, of course, include the maid who has cared for the =
bedroom, and the=20

waitress. By one of these servants send something to the cook, and a messag=
e of thanks for the=20

good things which she has made and you have enjoyed. The laundress need not=
 be inevitably=20

remembered, unless she has done a little washing for you; still, when one c=
onsiders the extra bed=20

and table linen to be washed, it is as well to leave a half dollar for her =
also. The amount of such=20

fees must be determined by the length of one=E2=80=99s purse; and must neve=
r be so large as to appear=20

lavish and unnecessary. A dollar, if you can afford it and have made a visi=
t of any length, will be=20

sufficient for each maid. The coachman who drives you to the train must rec=
eive the same=20

amount.  There is, one is glad to say, an occasional household in which the=
 idea of tips is=20

regarded as contrary to the spirit of true hospitality. In such homes the m=
istress herself sees that=20

the servants receive extra pay for the extra work entailed by guests, and t=
he hotel atmosphere=20

suggested by tipping is fortunately done away with.  [Sidenote: THE BREAD-A=
ND-BUTTER=20

NOTE]  After the guest has returned to her own home, her duties toward her =
recent hosts are not=20

at an end until she has written what is slangily known as =E2=80=9Cthe brea=
d-and-butter letter.=E2=80=9D This is=20

simply a note, telling of one=E2=80=99s safe arrival at one=E2=80=99s desti=
nation, and thanking the hostess for the=20

pleasant visit one has had. A few lines are all that etiquette demands, but=
 it requires these, and=20

decrees that they be despatched at once. To neglect to write the letter dem=
anded by those twin=20

sisters, Conventionality and Courtesy, is a grave breach of the etiquette o=
f the visitor.         *       *=20

*       *       *  Hospitality as a duty has been written up from the begin=
ning of human life. The=20

obligations of those who, in quaint old English phrase, =E2=80=9Cguesten=E2=
=80=9D with neighbors, or strangers,=20

have had so little attention it is no wonder they are lightly considered, i=
n comparison.  We hear=20

much of men who play the host royally, and of the perfect hostess. If hospi=
tality be reckoned=20

among the fine arts and moral virtues, to =E2=80=9Cguesten=E2=80=9D aright =
is a saving social grace. Where ten=20

excellent hosts are found we are fortunate if we meet one guest who knows h=
is business and does=20



it.  The consciousness of this neglected fact prompts us to write in connec=
tion with our cardinal=20

virtue of giving, of what we must perforce coin a word to define as =E2=80=
=9CGuestly Etiquette.=E2=80=9D We have=20

Wisby, _en passant_, may be described as a merchant town of great importanc=
e in the mediaeval=20

period, and whence we have derived our navigation laws. It has now about 40=
00 inhabitants, and=20

has many ruined buildings and sculptured marble about it.  So far Kantzow i=
n the _High German=20

Chronicle_: in the _Low German Chronicle_ (ed. Boehmer, Greifswald, 1832), =
I find nothing=20

bearing on the subject.  Indistinct and wavering is Kantzow in his account,=
 but thus much is to be=20

gathered from it.  1. That the _soi-disant_ Vineta lay east and west; Julin=
 or Wollin lies north and=20

south.  2. That the destruction of Wollin ensued on its aiding an enemy aga=
inst Denmark.  3. That=20

in the mind of Kantzow the two towns were not confounded, and that he had h=
eard both legends,=20

but had not sufficient critical sagacity to disentangle the mess.  The olde=
st MSS. of Helmold have=20

not this error. I have myself, as previously stated, seen one uncorrupted. =
The closing words of=20

Kantzow seem to make it necessary to search for the date of the rebuilding =
of Wisby, which I have=20

not at present the means of doing, though I will take an early opportunity =
of settling this, oddly=20

enough, contested point.  Von This should be a self-evident law. It is so f=
