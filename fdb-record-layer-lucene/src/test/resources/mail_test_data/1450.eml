the aristo struggled so desperately, he thought to silence him by bringing =
his heavy fist with a=20

crash upon the old man's head.  "Yvonne! _A moi!_" shouted M. le duc ere he=
 fell back senseless.=20

That awful cry, Yvonne heard it as she was being dragged through the noisom=
e crowd. It mingled=20

in her ear with the other awful sounds--the oaths and blasphemies which fil=
led the air with their=20

hideousness. It died away just as a formidable crash against the entrance d=
oor suddenly silenced=20

every cry within.  "All hands up!" came with a peremptory word of command f=
rom the doorway.=20

"Mercy on us!" murmured the woman Lemoine, who still had Yvonne by the hand=
, "we are undone=20

this time."  There was a clatter and grounding of arms--a scurrying of bare=
 feet and sabots upon=20

the floor, the mingled sounds of men trying to fly and being caught in the =
act and hurled back:=20

screams of terror from the women, one or two pitiable calls, a few shrill c=
ries from frightened=20

children, a few dull thuds as of human bodies falling.... It was all so con=
fused, so unspeakably=20

horrible. Yvonne was comes off in six weeks.  So I want to have one more ru=
n in the wilderness in=20

all the freedom of bachelorhood.  Will you go with me?"  "`Unpossible,' as =
Jenkins would say,"=20

answered Archie.  "Nothing would please me better, but, duty before pleasur=
e!  I've promised to=20

spend a week along wi' Little Bill at the Whitehorse Plains.  Billie has ta=
ken a great fancy to that=20

chief o' the half-breeds, Cuthbert Grant, and we are goin' to visit him.  I=
've no doubt that Little Bill=20

would let me off, but I won't be let off."  "Then I must ask Okematan to go=
 with me," said Dan.=20

"You needn't trouble yourself, for I heard him say that he was goin' off to=
 see some o' his relations=20

on important business--a great palaver o' some sort--and Elise told me this=
 morning that she saw=20

him start yesterday."  "Morel is too busy with his new farm to go," rejoine=
d Dan, "and Jenkins is too=20

busy helping Morel.  Perhaps Dechamp or Bourassin may be more at leisure.  =
I will go see."  But=20

e whole thing may=20

only be a scare ... the Marats may only be here about the aristos ... they =
will probably leave you=20

alone if you give them up ... perhaps you'll get a reward.... Put them away=
 till some of this row=20

subsides ... I'll talk to commandant Fleury if I can."  Yvonne felt her kne=
es giving way under her.=20

There was nothing more to hope for now--nothing. She felt herself lifted fr=
om the ground--she was=20

too sick and faint to realise what was happening: through the din which fil=
led her ears she vainly=20

tried to distinguish her father's voice again.   V  A moment or two later s=
he found herself squatting=20

somewhere on the ground. How she got here she did not know--where she was s=
he knew still=20

less. She was in total darkness. A fusty, close smell of food and wine gave=
 her a wretched feeling=20

of nausea--her head ached intolerably, her eyes were hot, her throat dry: t=
here was a constant=20

buzzing in her ears.  The terrible sounds of fighting and screaming and cur=
sing, the crash of=20

broken glass and overturned benches came to her as through a partition--clo=
se by but muffled.=20

hunting canoe and going off by himself, when he chanced to meet with La Cer=
te.  That worthy=20

seemed unusually depressed, and returned Dan's greeting with very little of=
 his habitual=20

cheerfulness.  "What's wrong with you, Francois?" asked Dan, anxiously.  "D=
omestic infelicity,"=20

answered La Certe, with a sorrowful shake of the head.  "What! surely Slowf=
oot has not taken to=20

being unkind to you?"  "O no!  Slowfoot could not be unkind, but she is unh=
appy; she has lost her=20

cheerful looks; she does not take everything as she once did; she does not =
now let everything go=20

the poor child cries for it, and comes to me secretly, when Slowfoot is out=
 of the way, to beg for a=20

draw.  Then, she scolds me--no, she does not scold.  Slowfoot cannot scold.=
  She is too amiable--

but she remonstrates, and that is worse than scolding, for it enlists mysel=
f against myself.  O!  I am=20

now miserable.  My days of peace are gone!"  "This is all very sad, La Cert=

CHAPTER VIII  THE ENGLISH ADVENTURERS   I  It was with that muffled din sti=
ll ringing in her=20

ear and with the conception of all that was going on, on the other side of =
the partition, standing like=20

an awesome spectre of evil before her mind, that Yvonne woke to the conscio=
usness that her=20

father was dead.  He lay along the last half-dozen steps of a narrow wooden=
 staircase which had=20

its base in the narrow, cupboard-like landing on to which the Lemoines had =
just thrust them both.=20

Through a small heart-shaped hole cut in the door of the partition-wall, a =
shaft of feeble light struck=20

straight across to the foot of the stairs: it lit up the "What does she rem=
onstrate about?"  "About my=20

laziness!  She does it very kindly, very gently--so like her old self!--but=
 she _does_ it.  She says,=20

`Husband; we have gone on this way too long.  We must change.  _You_ must c=
hange.  You are=20

lazy!'"  "Well, La Certe," said Dan, "I'm afraid that Slowfoot is right."  =
"I know she is right!" retorted=20

the half-breed, with more of exasperation in his manner than his friend had=
 ever before seen in=20

him. "When that which is said of one is false, one can afford to smile, but=

 expend it, and you search=20
