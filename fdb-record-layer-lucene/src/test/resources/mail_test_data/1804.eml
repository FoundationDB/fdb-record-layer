cannot rise to the height of unwavering fortitude, God accepts a tremulous trust fighting against 

mortal terror, and grasping with a feeble hand the word of God, and the memory of all his past 

deliverances. It is precisely this conflict of faith and fear which the psalm which gives them a more 

staid appearance. They are generally pervaded by an air of complacency and calm superiority, 

and converse in measured unctuous accents, checkered by beaming smiles when they are not 

contradicted. The youths, on the other hand, present in most

of which are closed by a kind of refrain (vers. 4, 10, 11)--a structure which is characteristic of 

several of these Sauline persecution psalms (_e.g._, lvii. 5, 11; lix. 9, 17). The first part of each of 

these two portions is a vivid description of his danger, from which he rises to the faith expressed in 

the closing words. The repetition of the same thoughts in both is not to be regarded as a cold 

artifice of composition, but as the true expression of the current of his thoughts. He sees his 

enemies about him, ready to swallow him up--"there be many fighting against me disdainfully"[I] 

(ver. 2). Whilst the terror creeps round his heart ("he was sore afraid," 1 Sam. xxi. 12), he rouses 

himself to trust, as he says, in words which express most emphatically the co-existence of the two, 

and carry a precious lesson of the reality of even an interrupted faith, streaked with many a black 

line of doubt and dread.  [I] Literally, "loftily." Can there be any allusion to the giant stature of 

Goliath's relations in Gath? We hear of four men "born to the giant in Gath," intellectually weak 

aspect. They are quite as much addicted to flirting with the young ladies as if they belonged to the 

other world, but want that hardihood, not to say impertinence, which characterises the lavender-

gloved tribe who are still heathens. The arrangement of the room is somewhat that of a private 

concert, only instead of a piano is a table, behind which are seated Joseph Caribbee Islands, 

Chundango, and several other lay and clerical performers. In the centre of this table is a vase, 

which Joseph hopes to see filled with subscriptions before the proceedings terminate. There is a 

suspicion, however, that things may not go off quite smoothly, as a lay member present, who does 

a good deal of amateur preaching, intends to take him to task about certain unsound views which 

we knew our friend Joseph entertains. I am sorry to say that some of the young gentlemen leaning 

in the doorway, where I stand, anticipate this encounter with apparent satisfaction. Among them is 

Broadhem, who has never once taken his eyes off Wild Harrie. That young lady is more

"(In) the day (that) I am afraid--I trust on Thee."  And then he breaks into the utterance of praise 

and confidence--to which he has climbed by the ladder of prayer.    "In God I praise His word,    In 

God I trust, I do not fear:--    What shall flesh do to me?"  How profoundly these words set forth the 

object of his trust, as hair is neatly and modestly drawn back. She might have risked a larger 

chignon, but she had never been to an entertainment of this kind before, and did not know how 

they dressed; her eyes are only now and then furtively raised, and she takes a quick glance round 

the room, winding up with Broadhem; and a twitching at the corners
