premiums when our house was too far removed from others to be in danger of =
conflagration;=20

against internal incendiarism we thought ourselves guarded. The warnings of=
 Manila Bay in 1898=20

and Venezuela a few years later made no impression. Confident of our ultima=
te resources, we=20

assumed no one would attack to court ultimate defeat; and above all, fair-m=
inded ourselves, we=20

were utterly incredulous of unfair-mindedness in others. Wise and farseeing=
 men gave warning=20

from time to time, but the impressions were momentary.  And so, when in 191=
4 the assassination=20

at Serajevo was quickly followed by an impossible ultimatum, and this in a =
very few days=20

developed into a general European war, while our minds and souls revolted a=
t a great injustice,=20

our continental habit of thought resisted the suggestion that we should int=
erfere to right that wrong.=20

We did not see far enough; there were those who did; and I heard two wise m=
en, summer=20

residents here, agree in this very town in August, 1914, that this nation s=
hould take part, and at=20

once. But public opinion did not run in that channel; nor was it led into i=
t by our chosen rulers.=20

These also were shortsighted, however their vision may have been clarified =
subsequently. We=20

were told that a people should be neutral in thought as well as in deed; an=
d so we stood by and=20

watched Belgium, a neutral country, ravaged and then very cheap. Boil them =
in several Waters till=20

they are tender, and have lost their Bitterness; then put them into cold Wa=
ter for twelve Hours or=20

more. Then make a Syrup for them in the following manner. Take about their =
weight of fine Sugar=20

powder'd, and mix it with as much Water as it will take in, or a little mor=
e. Boil this, and scum it=20

well; then drain the Orange-Peels from the Water they were steep'd in, and =
put them in a glaz'd=20

earthen Vessel, and then pour the boiling hot Syrup upon them, letting them=
 remain so till the Day=20

following; then pour the Syrup from them, and boil it afresh, and pour it o=
n a second time, and=20

repeat the same work till your Peels are very clear, and the Syrup very thi=
ck; and then dry them in=20

a Stove, and they will be fit for use, in the Condition we buy them. One ma=
y candy Lemon-Chips=20

after the same manner.    To make _Hartshorn-Jelly._ From the same.  Take s=
ix Ounces of Harts-

horn Shavings; put them into two Quarts of Water, and two or three bits of =
Lemon-Peel, and set=20

this in a Sand-heat, for six or eight Hours, or let them infuse about ten H=
ours upon hot Embers.=20

Then boil it briskly, and when you find it will jelly, as you may do, by ta=
king out a little of the Liquor=20

in a Spoon, and cooling it; then strain it off, and add to it about half a =
Pound of double-refined=20

Sugar powder'd very fine; about a Gill of Sack,=20


_
crushed. A great crisis like the battle of the Marne stirred men's souls, b=
ut without bringing home=20

to us as a nation the ultimate danger to our liberty. The consummate outrag=
e of the "Lusitania"=20

made an impression never effaced, but the rising indignation of the country=
 was met with the=20

caution that "a man may be too proud to fight," and this crisis passed over=
 also.  But the great=20

giant was stirring in his sleep. Trumpet calls came from men high in public=
 esteem, among whom it=20

is sufficient now to mention Roosevelt and Leonard Wood. "Preparedness" was=
 their reveille. Our=20

young men heard it, and in 1916 at Plattsburgh, and I think elsewhere, spra=
ng up the training=20

camps. The colleges offered their facilities; and although in the fall of 1=
916 there was still, as in=20

1860 and 1861, a large proportion of "peace-at-any-price" men, so large in =
1916 as to permit the=20

election of a President on the party slogan "He kept us out of war," the ti=
me was fast growing ripe.=20

Infatuated Germany, confident of victory in Europe and of later victory on =
this continent, or risking=20

all on the Juice of two Lemons; then set this on a slow Fire, and as it hea=
ts, beat the Whites of two=20

Eggs to a froth, and put it into the Pan, where the Jelly is, at times as i=
t rises; and then, when it just=20

boils up, take it from the Fire, and it will be clarified. Then pour it by =
small quantities into the Jelly-

bag, and let it drop or run into some Receiver; but it will be apt to run t=
hick at first: then take that=20

which is first run, if it be thick, and pour again into the Jelly-bag, and =
you will find it come clear.=20

Then place your Glasses to receive it, and change the full one for another,=
 which you must=20

carefully watch, that your Glasses be not soil'd in the least, for the Beau=
ty of this, in one particular,=20

is its transparency; and again, it should not be too stiff. Some only take =
the Harts-horn Shavings,=20

six Ounces to two Quarts of Water, and boil it gently till the Liquor will =
jelly, without the expence of=20

a Sand-heat, or setting it on hot Embers. The boiling it is the best way, b=
ut requires more=20

Patience.    To make a Tart of the _Ananas,_ or _Pine-Apple._ From Barbadoe=
s.=20


_
Woke up,--yes; but about as helpless as Gulliver on the Island of Lilliput.=
 The "man mountain" was=20

tied fast with the cords of unpreparedness, red tape, departmental ineffici=
ency, official jealousy=20

and hostile intrigue. As in 1812, in 1847, in 1861 and in 1898, there was l=
ittle or nothing ready; all=20

had to be Knots, and cut it in Slices about half an Inch thick; then stew i=
t with a little Canary Wine,=20

or Madera Wine, and some Sugar, till it is thoroughly hot, and it will dist=
ribute its Flavour to the=20

Wine much better than any thing we can add to it. When it is as one would h=
ave it, take it from the=20

Fire; and when it is=20
