tragedy to Rome before the invasion that it was to France.  Yet there was to me a change in 

Rome--from the Rome one knew who had been there eight years before--a change stranger and 

deeper than the change one felt in coming from Rome to Paris. This new Rome was a cleaner 

Rome, a more prosperous Rome, a happier Rome. Something had been happening to the people. 

They wore better clothes, they seemed to live in cleaner tenements; they certainly had a different 

squint at life from the Romans of the first decade of this century. One heard two answers to the 

question that arose in one's heart. One group said: "It is prosperity. Italy never has seen such 

prosperity as she has seen during the past ten years. There has been work for everyone, and 

work at good wages. So you see the working people well-clad, well-housed, clean and contented." 

Another answered the question thus: "The Socialists have done it. We have had plenty of work in 

other years; but we have worked for small wages, and have lived in squalor. We still work as we 

always have worked, but we get better pay, and we get our better pay in many ways; first in 

relatively higher wages, next in safeguards thrown around labour, and restrictions on the predatory 

activities of capital. The Socialists in government have forced many reforms in housing, in labour 

conditions, in the distribution of the profits of labour and capital, and we are living in hope of better 

things rather than in fear of worse!" One may take his choice of answers; probably the truth lies 

between the two. Prosperity has done something; socialism in government has done something, 

and each has promoted the other!  But the war has done one thing to Rome indisputably. It has 

paralysed the tourist business. Rome was the greatest tourist city in the world. But now her the 

structure of their teeth, and the inconceivable perseverance with which they pursue their 

destructive operations, succeed in perforating the fruit of the juvia. As soon as the triangular nuts 

are spread on the ground, all the animals of the forest, the monkeys, the manaviris, the squirrels, 

the cavies, the parrots, and the macaws, hastily assemble to dispute the prey. They have all 

strength enough to break the ligneous tegument of the seed; they get out the kernel, and carry it to 

the tops of the trees. "It is their festival also," said the Indians who had returned from the harvest; 

and on hearing their complaints of the animals, one may perceive that they think themselves alone 

the lawful masters of the forest.  One of the four canoes, which had taken the Indians to the 

gathering of the Juvias, was filled in great part with that species of reeds (carices) of which the 

blow-tubes are made. These reeds were from fifteen to seventeen feet long, yet no trace of a knot 

for the insertion of leaves and branches was perceived. They were quite straight, smooth 

externally, and perfectly cylindrical. These carices come from the foot of the mountains of 

Yumariquin and Guanaja. They are much sought after, even beyond the Orinoco, by the name of 

reeds of Esmeralda. A hunter preserves the same blow-tube during his whole life, and boasts of its 

lightness and precision, as we boast of the same qualities in our fire-arms. What is the 

monocotyledonous plant* that furnishes these admirable reeds? (* The smooth surface of these 

tubes sufficiently proves that they are not furnished by a plant of the family of umbelliferae.) Did 

we see in fact the internodes (parts between the knots) of a gramen of the tribe of nastoides? or 

may this carex be perhaps a cyperaceous plant* destitute of knots? (* The

Occasionally in the shops one sees that mother and daughter, wistful, eager, half-starved for every 

good thing in life, expatriated, living shabbily in the upper regions of some respectable pension, 

detached from the world about them, uprooted from the world at home, travel-jaded, ruin-sated, 

picture-wise and unbelievably stupid concerning life's real interests--the mother and daughter who 

in the old days lived so Orinoco, attains from eight to ten feet in height.) I cannot solve this 

question, or determine to what genus another plant belongs, which furnishes the shirts of marima. 

We saw on the slope of the Cerra Duida shirt-trees fifty feet high. The Indians cut off cylindrical 

pieces two feet in diameter, from which they peel the red and fibrous bark, without making any 

longitudinal incision. This bark affords them a sort of

flitting from Rome to Florence, from Florence to Lucerne, from Lucerne to Berlin, and thence to 

Paris and London, following the seasons like the birds. But today war prices have sent that 

precious pair home, and let us hope to honest work. It is a comfort to see Rome without their 

bloodless faces! That much the war has done for democracy at any rate!  And the passing of this 

"relic of old dacincy," the shabby genteel of the earth from Rome--even if the without a seam. The 

upper opening serves for the head; and two lateral holes are cut for the arms to pass through. The 

natives wear these shirts of marima in the rainy season: they have the form of the ponchos and 

ruanas of cotton, which are so common in New Grenada, at Quito, and in Peru. In these climates 

the riches and beneficence of nature being regarded as the primary causes of the indolence of the 

inhabitants, the missionaries say in showing the
