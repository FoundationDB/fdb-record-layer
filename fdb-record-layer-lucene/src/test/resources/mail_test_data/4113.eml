home.  In the dining room they ate their luncheon on a French oak table wit=
h beautiful carved feet=20

and found that the sideboard and chairs were also of handsome French oak.  =
The little room soon=20

became crowded, not only with the Red Cross girls and physicians, but with =
a number of the=20

French people who came in to assist in the celebration. Beyond gifts of cho=
colate and bread, they=20

refused to accept other food, explaining that the portion of the American a=
rmy which had passed=20

through their village earlier in the day had given them supplies.  Yet the =
little French girl in whose=20

home the celebration was taking place would neither eat nor speak to her Fr=
ench acquaintances=20

or to the strange Americans.  Sonya and Miss Blackstone confided to each ot=
her their impression=20

that the little girl was probably unable to speak, fright and exhaustion ha=
ving oftentimes this effect=20

upon highly nervous temperaments.  However, in the midst of the luncheon, s=
uddenly the little=20

French girl slipped over beside the new Red Cross nurse, Nora Jamison, and =
took tight hold of her=20

hand. She even allowed her to tempt her into eating small morsels of food. =
 By accident the new=20

nurse was sitting next Sonya Clark and Sonya turned to her, mystified by th=
e little French girl's=20

impetuous action.  "I wonder how you managed that, Miss Jamison?" she inqui=
red. "I have been=20

trying to make friends with our little French hostess ever since my meeting=
 with her and she would=20

have nothing to do with me. You seem not to have noticed her and she has gi=
ven her confidence=20

to you."  Still holding the little French girl's hand Nora Jamison nodded. =
 "You will find I am a kind=20

of Pied Piper, Mrs. Clark. I had always nursed children before I began war =
work and am especially=20

fond of them."  Sonya shook her head.  "It is Peter Pan I thought of when I=

ildren to think of us=20

as ogres and one wonders what stories their parents may now be telling them=
 of our American=20

soldiers."  Then so many things distracted Sonya Clark's attention that she=
 thought no more of the=20

little deserted French girl until she and Bianca looked for her to say good=
by and found that the=20

child had disappeared.     CHAPTER IV  _Luxemburg_   IN the afternoon, trav=
eling in the direction=20

of Belgium, there was an unexpected movement under the broad seat of the Re=
d Cross car which=20

startled its occupants.  The first exclamation came from Bianca Zoli who ha=
ppened to be sitting=20

just over a space where a large box of provisions originally had been store=
d. The box had been=20

removed, however, and the food eaten at luncheon.  "I am absurd!" Bianca ex=
claimed, clutching at=20

Nora Jamison's hand, as she was sitting beside her. "But I thought I felt s=
omething stir. I wonder if=20

the excitement of our journey is having a strange influence upon me?"  "I d=
on't think so," the older=20

girl returned, "I have been conscious of life, a movement of some kind unde=
rneath us ever since=20

we left the little French farmhouse. I say I have been conscious, no, I hav=
e not been exactly that,=20

only puzzled and uncomfortable."  Leaning over, Nora at this instant lifted=
 the curtain, and Bianca=20

bending forward at the same time, they both became aware of the figure of t=
he little French girl=20

who had vanished a few moments before their departure from her home.  "Sony=
a!" Bianca called.=20

This was scarcely necessary, since by this time every occupant of the car k=
new equally well what=20

had happened and curiously enough, without discussion, understood the expla=
nation for the=20

child's action.  The little girl had believed that this group of women and =
girls, wearing the Red=20

Cross of service, were her friends and if possible would protect her from w=
hat she feared most in=20

all the world, the grey uniformed German soldiers. Also they were leaving t=
he neighborhood where=20

she had lived under a burden of terror.  Her one desire was to escape from =
the captured town=20

where the Germans had been in authority so many weary months. As Nora Jamis=
on and Bianca=20

both struggled to assist the child, they found she could scarcely help hers=
elf, so stiff had she=20

become from her uncomfortable position.  Yet she managed with their aid to =
climb up and sit=20

crowded close between Bianca and Nora Jamison.  "What are you going to do w=
ith this child,=20

Sonya?" Bianca demanded, more sympathetic than she cared to reveal, remembe=
ring her own=20

childhood, which had been more lonely and difficult than any one had ever r=
ealized. Not even=20
