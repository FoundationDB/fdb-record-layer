"Ah! I see. Yes. I wonder how it was? Now, 'pon my word, Mr. Croak, I can't tell for the life of me at 

this moment how it was. I'll rub up my memory. I'll let you know to-morrow."  The client and 

attorney parted company. The former, on his return home, at once sent his pass-book to the bank, 

and got his account made up. The cheques which had been cashed since the last balancing of his 

account were of course returned in the pass-book, and among them the cheque made payable to 

"Clockwork or bearer," and not crossed.  Whoever wrote the signature of "Jno. precautions taken 

against it. And in truth it is a terrific power, cleaving the hardest rocks, rending the mighty oak, and 

fusing the most refractory substances. Darting into the soil it frequently forms tubes of vitreous 

appearance by fusing the earth and stones as it passes. The writer has seen masses of straw 

fused in the same way. And when we remember that French savants have, with the most powerful

with the same autograph on other cheques. Did he doubt who had written his name at the foot of 

that order to pay? No. He knew it was his own writing. He was only looking at it to see whether he 

could find a long and four inches in diameter in the far more obstinate feldspar and quartz. 

[Illustration: IDEAL SUBTERRANEAN STORM.]  There are numerous cases of death by lightning; 

but the instances in which more than one person has been killed by a flash are comparatively rare. 

The freaks played far outdo those of the wind, and puzzle the wisest. March 20, 1784, about four 

hundred people were assembled in the theatre at Mantua, when lightning struck the building, and 

killed two persons, injuring ten.
