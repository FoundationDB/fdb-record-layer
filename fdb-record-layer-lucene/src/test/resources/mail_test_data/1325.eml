are clear; and suppose the artist has focused your attention on the eyes, o=

characteristic expression. You can attend to the picture exactly as you loo=

ears, but you do not count them. If, however, the writer describes the face=
 as it is in life, or as it is=20

in the portrait, he may speak only of the chief focus or exorcised every sp=

The learned doctors at Jeanne's trial were trying to fasten upon her some p=

witchcraft and association with the powers of evil; it was their business t=

squeamishness or puritanism, but of decorum. The classical Greeks seem to h=

question either by instinctive good taste or by analysis, as they mastered =
so many other problems=20

in art with which we are only beginning to wrestle. They cannot be accused =
of prudishness where=20

the body is concerned; they loved its naked beauty, and in their sculpture =
they portrayed it frankly,=20

with a serious and unflagging delight. Yet in their poetry they did not por=
tray it; they merely noted=20

the total effect of physical beauty, and omitted details, as we should omit=
 the number of ears in the=20

mushroom crops of fairies, and that a very miasma of enchantment was in the=
 air. The mass of=20

belief in fairies as you and I once had in Hop-o'-my-Thumb and Red Ridingho=

she was always a gentle and tender-hearted girl, ready to nurse the sick or=
 to play with the=20

children. "Well do I know it," says an aged peasant who testified for her m=

was dead, "I was then but a child, and she nursed me." But most important o=
