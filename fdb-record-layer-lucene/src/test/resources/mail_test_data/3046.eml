great assistance, should another edition of Monstrelet be called for.[6] Na=
mes of places are not=20

more clearly written, excepting those in Flanders and Picardy, with which, =
of course, he was well=20

acquainted. We know not whether it be through affectation or ignorance that=
 he calls many towns=20

by their latin names, frenchifying the termination: for instance, Aix-la-Ch=
apelle, Aquisgranie;=20

Oxford, Oxonie,=E2=80=94and several others in the like manner.  =E2=80=98Th=
ese defects are far from being repaid,=20

as they are in Froissart, by the agreeableness of the narration: that of Mo=
nstrelet is heavy,=20

monotonous, weak and diffuse. Sometimes a whole page is barely sufficient f=
or him to relate what=20

would have been better told in six lines; and it is commonly on the least i=
mportant facts that he=20

labours the most.  =E2=80=98The second chapter of the first volume, consist=
ing of thirteen pages, contains=20

only a challenge from a spanish esquire, accepted by an esquire of England,=
 which, after four=20

years of letters and messages, ends in nothing. The ridiculousness of so po=
mpous a narration had=20

struck Rabelais, who says, at page 158 of his third volume,=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=98In reading this tedious detail, (which=20

he calls a little before _le tant long, curieux et f=C3=A2cheux conte_) we =
should imagine that it was the=20

beginning, or occasion, of some severe war, or of a great revolution of kin=
gdoms; but at the end of=20

the tale we laugh at the stupid necessary to determine the manner of the de=
ath of a person who,=20

dying in one, is buried in another county, the coroner of the latter county=
 is the proper officer to=20

hold the inquest.[521] A coroner cannot hold a second inquest while the fir=
st is existing. As we=20

have seen, in holding an inquest the coroner performs a judicial duty, and =
he is _functus officio_=20

as soon as the verdict has been returned. He can hold no second inquest in =
the same case unless=20

the first has been quashed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and a new =
inquiry ordered. He=20

cannot set aside or quash his own inquest. If he were allowed to hold two i=
nquests, not only might=20

the greatest inconvenience arise from the inconsistent findings of the resp=
ective juries, but such a=20

practice would be liable to great abuse, and as the object of the proceedin=
g is merely preliminary,=20

the main purpose being to ascertain whether it is probable that a crime has=
 been committed, and=20

to examine the facts and circumstances and preserve the evidence, all the e=
nds of this inquiry are=20

answered by one inquisition, _super visum corporis_. We believe no reported=
 case is to be found=20

in this country where a second inquisition has been held, the first remaini=
ng undischarged, nor is=20

any such practice known to or recognized by our laws.[522]   THE INQUEST MU=
ST BE HELD=20

UPON VIEW OF THE BODY.  The coroner can in no case hold an inquest=20


_
and Enguerrand their scribe, _plus baveux qu=E2=80=99un pot =C3=A0 moutarde=
_.=E2=80=99[7]  =E2=80=98Monstrelet employs many=20

pages to report the challenges sent by the duke of Orleans, brother to king=
 Charles VI., to Henry=20

IV. king of England,=E2=80=94challenges which are equally ridiculous with b=
ody. This is jurisdictional and=20

cannot be waived by any one. He is not bound to hold an inquest before buri=
al of the body takes=20

place. When it has been buried, and he believes an inquest necessary, he is=
 vested with authority=20

to have the body disinterred and=20

which had a similar termination. When he meets with any event that particul=
arly regards Flanders=20

or Picardy, he does not omit the smallest circumstance: the most minute and=
 most useless seem=20

to him worth preserving,=E2=80=94and this same man, so prolix when it were =
to be wished he was concise,=20

omits, for the sake of brevity, as he says, the most interesting details. T=
his excuse he repeats=20

more than once, for neglecting to enlarge on facts far more interesting tha=
n the quarrels of the=20

Flemings and Picards. When speaking of those towns in Champagne and Brie wh=
ich surrendered=20

inquest, and if necessary direct a post-mortem examination to be made, but =
after having done so,=20

he must cause it to be reburied.[523] Deep interests are involved in the pr=
oper discharge of the=20

duties of coroners; the character, liberty, and perhaps the life of a citiz=
en accused of crime on the=20

one hand, and on the other the aiding of public justice in establishing the=
 guilt and securing the=20

punishment of the actual criminal. Many of the questions which fall within =
the scope of a coroner=E2=80=99s=20

inquisition are of an intricate and most perplexing character, a correct=20
