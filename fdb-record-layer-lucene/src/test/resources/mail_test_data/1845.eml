OE INDUSTRY.   This factory is=20

conducted by the Western Shoe Co., and annually employs about 225 prisoners=
. There is an=20

excellent opportunity here for the inmate to learn a trade at which he can =
make a good living upon=20

his release. Few citizens are employed at this work, but a competent citize=
n-foreman is in charge=20

of each shop. As far as possible prisoners are taught the business of makin=
g shoes, and many of=20

them become very proficient at this work.  The company pays a stated price =
for each piece of work=20

turned out, and the per diem earnings of the prisoners is larger than in an=
y other prison in the=20

country. The volume of business of these two industries amounts annually to=
 more than=20

$2,000,000. Of this total, returns from the twine factory, operated on stat=
e account, amount to=20

$1,300,000, while the shoe company, operated on the piece-price system, doe=

the repair work of the=20

institution is performed in this department, and in this shop are located t=
he tinner, plumbers,=20

carpenters, painters, machinists, etc., all under the supervision of a firs=
t-class Esq. This=20

Gentleman has several Vines laid up against the side of his House, as full =
of Grapes as I have=20

ever seen any; but at the bottom where they grow, the Ground is paved with =
Bricks for about ten=20

or twelve foot from the Wall they are nail'd to. This Pavement, in the last=
 wet Summer, kept the=20

Roots from imbibing, or receiving too much Moisture, and therefore the Juic=
es of the Vines were=20

digested, and capable of producing Fruit this Year; whereas such Vines as w=
ere not growing in dry=20

places naturally, or had their Roots defended from the violent Wet by accid=
ent, have few or no=20

Grapes at all. My Observations this Year, in some places where there are Pa=
vements, still=20

confirms me in my Opinion; and where there was any tolerable Skill in Pruni=
ng, I am persuaded=20

every one will find that there have been Grapes this Year, or now are on th=
ose Vines that have=20

stood in paved places, where the Pavement defended the Roots from the wet o=
f the last Year. And=20

as I have already mention'd in this, and other Works, the neccessity of pla=
nting Vines in dry=20

places, for regular Seasons; and these Instances showing us the advantage o=
f doing the same in=20

wet Seasons; I think one may reasonably judge, that Pavements made over suc=
h places where=20

Vines are planted, as well as Rubbish and dry Ground to plant them in, is t=
he best way we can=20

take for them. This way, particularly in a wet Year, will keep our Vines fr=

during the winter repairing radiators and overhauling wornout steam pipes. =
As repairs and=20

improvements are constantly being made and as the prison buildings are quit=
e old, considerable=20

carpenter work is also necessitated each year.  Perhaps the busiest men in =
this shop are the=20

machinists, whose business it is to see that all machinery, shafting, etc.,=
 are kept in repair, thus=20

reducing breakdowns to the minimum. This shop is run in an economical manne=
r and annually=20

saves the state thousands of dollars.                                   TAI=
LOR SHOP   In this department is=20

located the tailor shop, laundry and bath room, about twenty prisoners bein=
g constantly employed=20

in the former, making and repairing clothing for the inmates; the second an=
d third rooms, of=20

course, are devoted to washing and drying of clothes and bathing of prisone=
rs. As there are about=20

700 prisoners whose clothing must be mended and washed each week, the emplo=
yes of this shop=20

find all the work they wish to do.                       [Prisoners at Work=

            BATH ROOM   The bath room is=20

located below the tailor shop in a two-story building. Here bathing operati=
ons are consequently in=20

digesting, as we find by experience; for no long-jointed Shoots of Vines ar=
e fruitful as they ought to=20

be, and rarely bear any Fruit at all. 'Tis the short-jointed Shoots that wi=
ll bear Fruit plentifully; and=20

where there is much Wet at the Root, you must expect very few short Joints,=
 and also very little=20

Fruit: therefore, in this case, the Roots ought always to be defended from =
Wet.  This Year, 1726,=20

was, at the beginning, a gentle and moist Spring, but _April_ and _May_ wer=
e hot; which brought=20

every thing so forward, that our Harvest was about five or six Weeks forwar=
der than it has been for=20

several Years past. The Case I have mention'd of the Grapes ripening natura=
lly, was in proportion=20

to the forwardness of the Harvest; every thing that I have observed in the =
same way was alike.=20

The last Year was as extraordinary in the lateness of Crops, for then every=
thing was as backward=20

through the perpetual Rain we had in the Summer. Sometime or other this Mem=
orandum may be=20

of use, if my Papers last so long; however, for the present, consider how t=
hese two different Years=20

have affected the Vine; the last wet Year made the Vines shoot strong and v=
igorous, and there=20

was no Fruit this Year: nor was this only with us in _Britain_; but every w=
here in _Europe_. The=20

last Year produced such Floods, from the continued Rains at unexpected Seas=
ons, as was never=20

known in the memory of Man, the Vines shot vigorously; and this Year there =
were very few Grapes=20

of the first Crop: but this Summer was so good and favourable, by its warm =
Months at the=20

beginning of the Summer, that the Vines abroad shot=20

supervision of a guard, who marches the prisoners to the bath room, twenty-=
eight at a time, there=20

being accommodations for only twenty-eight men, and each is provided with a=
n overhead shower=20

bath of hot or cold water.  As the guard marches in with the men the prison=
ers remain standing in=20

front of their shower until the attendant registers their numbers, and the =
guard then stamps his=20

cane twice on or Grapes, which made up for the other deficiency. I expect t=
he next Year from=20

hence, that the Vines will produce a full Crop of Grapes abroad, because th=
is Year has settled the=20

Juices, and digested them; but what Season there may be for ripening, is st=
ill uncertain, especially=20

when we have the two last Years in view. But in our Gardens, I fear, we sha=
ll have worse success;=20

for what this Year has=20

ates' clothing is kept in=20

pigeon holes arranged along the walls of the laundry, each pigeon hole bein=
g labeled with the=20

prisoner's register number, and at the expiration of his bath is hastily se=
nt downstairs and placed=20

on the small door leading to his stall. Each prisoner is given a clean hand=
kerchief and pair of=20

socks.  When the men are through bathing and the guard again stamps twice o=
n the floor with his=20

cane they step out of the bathing booths, and at the signal the march back =
to the shop begins. It=20

requires about fifteen minutes to bathe twenty-eight men.  Just in the rear=
 of the tailor shop is a=20

cobler, whose duties are to repair the shoes of the inmates. All the shoes =
are bought, including the=20

discharged clothing worn by the inmates, when they are relieased from priso=
n.=20

Accomodating generally a hard piece of work; for, as I imagine, there was l=
ittle care taken in the=20

beginning of the Year to lay up the Vines, especially because there was but=
 a small, or no=20

appearance of Grapes then; and the neglect of that Season in managing of Vi=
nes, will be the=20

occasion of losing the Crop the next Year. What I say here about the manage=
ment of Vines in the=20

early part of the Year, I have already treated of in my other Works.  I sha=
ll now proceed to give=20

some Particulars relating to the making of Wines of Grapes, which I believe=
 may help those who=20

make Wines in our _English_ Vineyards, and make them stronger and richer th=
an they hare=20

usually been.  Considering the uncertainty of Seasons, and that every sort =
of Grape will not always=20

ripen without Art, it will be necessary to contrive how that Defect may be =
amended. The Richness=20

of Wine depends upon the Ripeness of the Grapes; and therefore when Grapes =
have not had the=20

advantage of a favourable Season to ripen, the Liquor press'd from the Grap=
es, may be amended=20

by boiling; for this extraordinary Heat will correct the Juice, by evaporat=
ing the two great quantity=20

of watery parts. This Method, however ripe the Grapes were among the ancien=
t _Greeks_ and=20

 services are conducted in=20

the prison chapel each Sunday, and as previously stated, a Catholic and Pro=
testant chaplain=20

preach every alternate Sunday. The attendance, although voluntary, is very =
large, taxing the=20

capacity of the chapel. Services are held at nine a. m., previous to which =
time each prisoner is=20

asked by his guard whether or not he wishes to attend.  A great many people=
 think that, frequently,=20

if not always practised; and is practised in those more Southern Climes, wh=
y is it not as=20

reasonable in ours? But that this is not now practised any where in _Europe=
,_ is no reason why=20

Wines may not be the better for it. I suppose the only reason why it is not=
 now practised, is,=20

because it would be an Expence and Trouble, more than the Masters of Vineya=
rds have usually=20

been at; and so long as they can sell their Wines at a constant Price, they=
 do not care to go out of=20
