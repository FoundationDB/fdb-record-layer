occasional falls of sleet, mingled with rain that          chilled one to t=

closely          round my throat, and braced my nerves to meet the         =
 elements, hoping I might=20

the grunsteins* is a close mixture of feldspar and diallage. (* In the moun=
tains of Bareuth, in=20

Franconia, so abundant in grunstein and serpentine, these formations are no=
t connected together.=20

The serpentine there belongs rather to the schistose hornblende (hornblends=
chiefer), as in the=20

island of Cuba. Near Guanaxuato, in Mexico, I saw it alternating with syeni=
te. These phenomena=20

of serpentine rocks forming layers in eurite (weisstein), in schistose horn=
blende, in gabbro, and in=20

syenite, are so much the more remarkable, as the great mass of garnetiferou=
s serpentines, which=20

are found in the mountains of gneiss and mica-slate, form little distinct m=
ounts, masses not=20

covered by other formations. It is not the same in the mixtures of serpenti=
ne and granulated=20

limestone.)  The grunsteins of Tucutunemo, which we consider as constitutin=
g the same formation=20



as the serpentine rock, contain veins of malachite and copper-pyrites. Thes=
e same metalliferous=20

combinations are found also in Franconia, in the grunsteins of the mountain=
s of Steben and=20

Lichtenberg. With respect to the green slates of Malpaso, which have all th=
e characters of=20

transition-slates, they are identical with those which M. von Buch has so w=
ell described, near=20

Schonau, in Silesia. They contain beds of grunstein, like the slates of the=
 mountains of Steben just=20

mentioned.* (* On advancing into the adit for draining the Friedrich-Wilhel=
mstollen mine, which I=20

caused to be begun in 1794, near Steben, and which is yet only 340 toises l=
ong, there have=20

successively been found, in the transition-slate subordinate strata of pure=
 and porphyritic=20

grunstein, strata, of Lydian stone and ampelite (alaunschiefer), and strata=
 of fine-grained=20

grunstein. All these strata characterise the transition-slates.) The black =
limestone of the Morros de=20

San Juan is also a transition-limestone. It forms perhaps a subordinate str=
atum in the slates of=20

Malpaso. This situation would be analogous to what is observed in several p=
arts of Switzerland.* (*=20

For Instance, at the Glyshorn, at the Col de Balme, etc.) The slaty zone, t=
he centre of which is the=20

ravine of Piedras Azules, appears divided into two formations. On some poin=
ts we think we=20

observe one passing into the other.  The grunsteins, which begin again to t=
he south of these=20

slates, appear to me to differ little from those found north of the ravine =
of Piedras Azules. I did not=20

see there any pyroxene; but on the very spot I recognized a number of cryst=
als in the amygdaloid,=20

which appears so strongly linked to the grunstein that they alternate sever=
al times.  The geologist=20

may consider his task as fulfilled when he has traced with accuracy the pos=
itions of the diverse=20

strata; and has pointed out the analogies traceable between these positions=
 and what has been=20

observed in other countries. But how can he avoid being tempted to go back =
to the origin of so=20

many different substances, and to inquire how far the dominion of fire has =
extended in the=20

mountains that bound the great basin of the steppes? In researches on the p=
osition of rocks we=20

have generally to complain of not sufficiently perceiving the connection be=
tween the masses,=20

which we believe to be superimposed on one another. Here the difficulty see=
ms to arise from the=20

too intimate=20


_
friend abroad.           "On this point, however, my driver reassured me.  =
        'Nay, oo'be to home,=20

theer's a light i' yon          winder,' he said, pointing with his whip wh=
ere a          faint streak of=20

yellow shone like a beacon into the          surrounding gloom. The moon wa=
s struggling through=20

the clouds, and I could dimly discern the outline          of the quaint ga=
bled front of the house, with=20

its          mullioned windows, and masses of clinging ivy.          Dismou=
nting at the old stone porch,=20

I seized the          knocker and beat a mighty tattoo. There was no       =
   reply. Even the light had=20

disappeared from the          window almost simultaneously with the approac=
h of          our carriage=20

wheels, and though I hammered for          fully five minutes I belong to t=
he same family.  The=20

phonolite (or leucostine compacte of Cordier) is pretty generally regarded =
by all who have at once=20

examined burning and extinguished volcanoes, as a flow of lithoid lava. I f=
ound no real basalt or=20

dolerite; but the presence of pyroxene in the amygdaloid of Parapara leaves=
 little doubt of the=20

igneous origin of those spheroidal masses, fissured, and full of cavities. =
Balls of this amygdaloid=20

are enclosed in the grunstein; and this grunstein alternates on one side wi=
th a green slate, on the=20

other with the serpentine of Tucutunemo. Here, then, is a connexion suffici=
ently close established=20

between the phonolites and the green slates, between the pyroxenic amygdalo=
ids and the=20

serpentines containing copper-ores, between volcanic substances and others =
that are included=20
