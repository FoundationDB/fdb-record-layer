, among them the jetties at=20

Mayport, Florida which he helped to build and a jail at High Springs, Flori=

between the Indians and settlers that Berry's grandmother, serving as a nur=
se at Tampa Bay was=20

captured by the Indians and carried away to become the squaw of their chief=
; she was later re-

captured by her owners. This was a common procedure, according to Berry's s=
tatements. Indians=20

often captured slaves, particularly the women, or aided in their escape and=
 almost always=20

intermarried with them. The red men were credited with inciting many uprisi=

escapes among the slaves.  Country frolics (dances) were quite often attend=
ed by Indians, whose=20

main reason for going was to obtain whiskey, for which they had a very stro=

character, had the policy which was carried to its greatest height by the a=

 military empire. So would=20
