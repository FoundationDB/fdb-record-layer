to hold the pots above the fire for cooking peas, rice, vegetables, meats, etc.; the home-made 

coffee from meal, spring and well water, tanning rawhide for proprietors of the Church lands that 

"stone dead had no fellow." The result was a democratic and thoroughly Protestant Church, which 

drew into itself the highest energies, political as well as religious, of a strong and great-hearted 

people, and by which Laud and

"There was no difference," he states, "in the treatment of men and women for work; my parents 

worked very hard and women did some jobs that we would think them crazy for trying now; why 

my mother helped build a railroad before she was married to my father. My mother's first husband 

was sold away from her; shucks, some of the masters didn't care how they treated husbands, 

wives, parents and children; any of them might be separated from the other. A good price for a 

'nigger' was $1500 on down and if one was what was called a stallion (healthy), able to get plenty 

children he would bring about $2500.  "They had what was called legal money--I did when they 

had apparently overcome resistance in England, were as Milton says, "more robustiously 

handled." If the Scotch auxiliaries did not win the decisive battle of Marston Moor, they enabled 

the English Parliamentarians to fight and win it. During the dark days of the Restoration, English 

resistance to tyranny was strongly supported on the ecclesiastical side by the martyr 

steadfastness of the Scotch till the joint effort triumphed in the Revolution. It is singular and sad to 

find Scotland afterwards becoming one vast rotten borough managed in the time of Pitt by 

Dundas, who paid the borough-mongers by appointments in India, with calamitous

two girls; his wife, Elizabeth, was about like the ordinary missus; Master Davis was good, but 

positive; he didn't allow other whites to bother his slaves.  "When the war came, his two boys went 

first, finally Master Davis went; he and one son never returned.  "The Yankees killed cows, etc., as 

they went along but did not destroy any property 'round where I was.  "We had preachers and 

doctors, but no schools; the intensity of the local evil perhaps lent force to the revulsion, and 

Scotland has ever since been a distinctly Liberal element in British politics, and seems now likely 

to lead the way to a complete measure of religious freedom.  Nature to a great extent fore-

ordained the high destiny of the larger island, to at least an equal extent she fore-ordained the sad 

destiny of the smaller island. Irish history, studied impartially, is a grand lesson in political charity;

eggs. Most of the doctors used herbs from the woods and "Aunt Jane" and "Uncle Bob" were 

known for using "Samson's Snake Root," "Devil's shoe-string" for stomach troubles and "low-bud 

Myrtle" for fevers; that's good now, chile, if you can get it.  "The 'nigger' didn't have a chance to git 

in politics during slavery, but after Emancipation, he went immediately into the Republican Party; a 

few into the Democratic Party; there were many other parties, too.  "The religions were Methodist 

and Baptist; my master was Baptist and that's what I am; we could attend church but dare not try 

to get any education, less we punished with straps.  "There are many things I remember just less 

important by the malignity of man. That the stronger nation is entitled by the law of force to 

conquer its weaker neighbour and to govern the conquered in its own interest is a doctrine which 

civilized morality abhors; but in the days before civilized morality, in the days when the only law 

was that of natural selection, to which philosophy, by a strange counter-revolution seems now 

inclined to return, the smaller island was almost sure to be conquered by the possessors of the 

larger, more especially as the smaller, cut off from the Continent by the larger, lay completely 

within its grasp. The map, in short, tells us plainly that the destiny of Ireland was subordinated to 

that of Great Britain. At the same time, the smaller island being of considerable size

general punishment was with straps--some of the slaves suffered terribly on the plantations; if the 

master was poor and had few slaves he was mean--the more wealthy or more slaves he had, the 

better he was. In some cases it was the general law that made some of the masters as they were; 

as, the law and the channel of considerable breadth, it was likely that the resistance would be 

tough and the conquest slow. The unsettled state of Ireland, and the half-nomad condition in which 

at a comparatively late period its tribes remained, would also help to protract the bitter process of

liked better than the foreman and in many instances were treated like foremen but the law would 

not let them be called the rainy climate, which, while it clothed the island with green and made

the scenes of a precocious civilization, merely intellectual and literary in its character, and closely 

connected with the Church, though including also a bardic element derived from the times before 

Christianity, the fruits of which were
