  The chief approached, and it was indeed Planchet; D'Artagnan had recogniz=

which pray keep well in mind. It will be very natural for those of you who =
are Esotericists to hope=20

that none of you belong so far to the soulless portion of mankind, and that=
 you can feel quite easy=20

about D'Artagnan. About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stop=

"Who goes?" asked the captain.  "Mazarin!" replied D'Artagnan, bursting int=

cardinal's hair stood on end. But the joke appeared an excellent one to the=
 citizens, who, seeing=20

an abyss. If not become "immortal in good by identification with (our) God,=

!" said D'Artagnan,=20

"what does my lord think of that reply?"  "Man of talent!" cried Mazarin.  =
"In truth," said Porthos, "I=20

D'Artagnan. And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that h=
