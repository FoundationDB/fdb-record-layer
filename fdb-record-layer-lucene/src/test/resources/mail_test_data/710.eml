dracaena marginata luncheon. We happened to have something succulent. Howev=

GLAS will show you the way. We do it pretty snug there, I can tell you. Wha=

By the treaty signed at Troyes on May 21, 1420, Charles, Duke of Touraine, =
Dauphin of France, was disinherited; the very principles of the Salic law w=

one of his elder sisters, but upon that Catherine of France, the dracaena m=

PARLIAMENT.  EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M P.  [Illustration]  _House=
 of=20

Commons, Tuesday, February 11._--"How do you do, TOBY? A merry New Session =
and many of=20

them."  It was OLD MORALITY who spoke; his kindly face beamed on me; his fr=
iendly hand=20

grasped mine. Walked up the floor together through the old familiar scene. =
Benches crowded,=20

though a vacant seat here and there: HARTINGTON'S for example. Everybody so=
rry to hear he's=20

been ill, and glad to think of him enjoying the sunlight of Monte Carlo. Gr=
and Old Man more Grand=20

and less Old than ever; just up from Oxford; passed very well, it is said. =
Comes into Parliament=20

with every prospect of distinguishing himself; his maiden speech looked for=
 with much interest.  "I=20

think I'll put it off for a month or two, TOBY," he said, blushing with the=
 ingenuousness of youth.=20

"You see I'm so fresh from college, that it would ill become me to plunge i=
nto public affairs. It's all=20

very well for a young fellow like me to get up waited for the arrival of Je=
an de Bourgogne, and the=20

two entered Paris together on July 14th. The dauphin, the sole hope of Fran=
ce, fled before the=20

armies of his mother.  As early as May, 1419, the queen had been in negotia=
tion with the English=20

to disinherit her son, when the sudden death of Jean Sans Peur, who was ass=
assinated at a=20

conference with the dauphin in September, 1419, interrupted her plans; but =
she was determined at=20

all hazards not to fall into the hands of her son. She wrote a letter of co=
ndolence to the widowed=20

Duchess of Burgundy, and promised the new duke, Philippe le Bon, to assist =
him in punishing the=20

dauphin. Philippe, like all this race of Burgundian dukes, was a man of act=
ion, a man of strong=20

character, slightly more scrupulous than his father, and yet not entirely w=
ithout inclination to=20

sacrifice honor to policy. It is not to be wondered at that, justly indigna=
nt at the treacherous murder=20

of his father, he should have sacrificed the interests of France to satisfy=
 his resentment against the=20

dauphin.  The queen, the Duke of Burgundy, and the unhappy king, a mere too=
l in their hands,=20

treated at once with Henry V. It was stipulated in the preliminaries that H=
enry should aid them and=20

be aided by them in war upon the dauphin. The selfish mother who thus enlis=
ted even foreigners=20

in her war against her son was capable of=20


_
different. You're very good to say that great things are expected of me; bu=
t, if you please, I'll keep=20

in the background a bit. I'll feel my feet first, as they used to say in th=
e nursery, in what seems only=20

yesterweek."  Very nice this of him. Wish all young fellows fresh from the =
University, even when=20

they have taken honours, were equally modest.  "Haven't seen you since we m=
et at Greenlands'=20

icy mountains in the Recess," OLD MORALITY said, continuing our conversatio=
n interrupted by=20

the cheers that greeted our arrival. "You remember how bitterly cold the da=
y was? agreed that=20

Henry should marry Catherine de France, the youngest daughter of Isabeau, a=
nd should at once=20

receive control of the entire kingdom, in consideration of the incapacity o=
f Charles VI.  Isabeau de=20

Baviere was merely a wanton, an idle, vain, shallow-hearted seeker after pl=
easure, utterly=20

incapable of taking seriously her role as Queen of France. With such love a=
s her heart was=20

capable of feeling, she loved Catherine, while her mean nature could never =
forgive the son who=20

was the heir of France. We need not be surprised, therefore, to find her si=
