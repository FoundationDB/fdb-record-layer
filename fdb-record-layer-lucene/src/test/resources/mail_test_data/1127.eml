He was rather surprised to _
the stalls, when they heard him scrambling heavily.  Then came a resounding=
 thump as he=20

dropped from one of the open mangers to the floor of the barn.  Almost inst=
antly a terrific bawling=20

and uproar broke out below. Solomon had reached the cow at last. The boys r=
an to the edge of=20

the hay-lift and peered down. The cow was directly underneath, had backed u=
p against the=20

buggies, and stood tossing her head and bawling like a crazy thing.  Droppi=
ng their eyes below the=20

level of the loft floor, the lads saw Solomon coming round a pile of new al=
falfa which had been=20

unloaded in front of the central stalls. His rage was terrific, although he=
 advanced slowly to the=20

attack.  He came under the wide opening and swayed back and forth before th=
e cow like a tiger in=20

its cage, roaring his threats and watching for an opening to get by the low=
ered horns. He=20

Separate tables. Four bathrooms. Card-room, billiard-room, vast lounge. You=

Mansion, W."  At that moment a hansom cab came ambling down Selwood Terrace=
.  Impulsively=20

he hailed it.  "'Ere, guv'nor," said the cabman, seeing with an expert eye =
that Priam Farll was=20

unaccustomed to the manipulation of luggage. "Give this 'ere Hackenschmidt =
a copper to lend ye=20

a hand. You're only a light weight."  A small and emaciated boy, with the h=
istoric remains of a=20

cigarette in his mouth, sprang like a monkey up the steps, and, not waiting=
 to be asked,=20


_
instinct, and with a veteran's precaution before a wicked pair of horns.  N=
evertheless the cow, in a=20

lightning charge, caught him broadside on, and bore him, in a swift rush, i=
nto the midst of the heap=20

of clover. But for that soft padding for his ribs, it would have Leek's six=
pences for his feats of=20

strength, and the boy spat generously on the coin, at the same time, by a s=
trange skill, clinging to=20

the cigarette with his lower lip. Then the driver lifted the reins with a n=
oble gesture, and Priam had=20

to be decisive and get into the=20


_
hard with Solomon. He was doubled up and thrust into the soft mass, fightin=
g wildly.  Bear and=20

cow were buried in a storm of clover and flying hay. They twisted about. Th=
en the bear got his=20

back braced against a stall and his hind feet against the cow, and he bowle=
d her into the middle of=20

the barn.  With a huge grunt she alighted on her side and rolled clean over=
. As she scrambled to=20

her feet, full of pluck and snorting fiercely, Solomon issued from the mids=
t of the alfalfa-heap, and=20

again the two faced each other, filling the barn with loudmouthed threats. =

"250 Queen's Gate," said he.  As, keeping his head to one side to avoid the=
 reins, he gave the=20

direction across the roof of the cab to the attentive cocked ear of the cab=
man, he felt suddenly that=20

he had regained his nationality, that he was utterly English, in an atmosph=
ere utterly English. The=20

hansom was like home after the wilderness.  He had chosen 250 Queen's Gate =
because it=20

appeared the abode of tranquillity and discretion. He felt that he might si=

as into a feather bed. The other palace intimidated him. It recalled the te=
rrors of a continental=20

hotel. In=20
