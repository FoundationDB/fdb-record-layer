 as full of people as a hive is of bees, most       populous and most prosp=

they all perished of=20

hunger and thirst.  And in truth, were I to       recount his cruelties one=
 by one, I could make a big=20

book that would       astonish the world.   18. He built two fleets, each c=
omposed of many ships,=20

with which he       burnt, as though with fire from heaven, all those count=
ries.  Of how       many did=20

he make orphans! Of how many did he take away the children!       How many =
did he deprive of=20

their wives! how many wives did he leave       without husbands! Of what ad=
ulteries, rapes and=20

violence was he the       cause! how many did he deprive of liberty! what a=
nguish and calamity=20

were suffered by many people because of him! what tears did he cause       =
to be shed! what=20

sighs! what groans! what solitude in this life and       of how many has he=
 caused the eternal=20

damnation in the next! not       only of the Indians--who were numberless--=
but of the unhappy=20

Christians, of whose company he made himself worthy, with such       outrag=
es, most grave sins=20

and execrable abominations.  And I pray       God, that he may have had com=
passion on him and=20

be appeased with the       bad death to which he at last brought him. (93) =
                         New=20

Spain and Panuco and Xalisco      1. After the great cruelties and massacre=
s, that have been=20

described       (besides those not mentioned) had been committed in the pro=
vinces of       New=20

Spain and that of Panuco another senseless and cruel tyrant(94)       arriv=
ed in Panuco in the year=20

1525.  By committing great cruelty and       putting many in irons, and ens=
laving great numbers of=20

freemen in the       ways above told, and sending shiploads of them to the =
islands of       Cuba and=20

Hispaniola, where they could best he sold, he finished       devastating al=
l that province.  Eighty=20

Indians, reasonable beings,       were given in exchange for a horse.  2.2.=
 From Panuco, he was=20

sent to govern the city of Mexico and all New       Spain as President, wit=
h other great tyrants as=20

Auditors: and the       great evils, many sins and the amount of cruelty, r=
obbery, and=20

abomination he and they together committed, are beyond belief.  They       =
thus reduced all that=20

country to such extreme ruin, that in two       years they would have broug=
ht New Spain to the=20

condition of the       island of stone-carver where he made a bracket. The =
triangle in these cases=20

stood on its apex. The clockmaker's triangle stood on its base. Hence it wi=
ll be observed that a=20

straight line drawn along the head of the cherub (p. 167) finds itself leve=
l with the top of the two=20

wings. The clockmaker modified this in his metal spandrel ornaments. He dro=
pped the wings, so=20

that the top of the cherub's head is the apex of the triangle and the tips =
of the two wings the base.=20

Later, the head, although still retained, was enveloped in floriated orname=
nt and the cherub=20

became unrecognizable. But the triangle is well filled.  We next come to a =
most interesting stage,=20

coincident in time with the rebuilding of Hampton Court. The "Glorious Revo=
lution" had become=20

established and James II sent packing. The two cherubs holding up the Prote=
stant crown would=20

seem by its prevalence at this period to be a sort of symbolic record of ev=
ents that were=20

happening. Huguenot and Dutch metal-workers put their thoughts into form, a=
nd we find this=20

William and Mary Protestant emblem on the clock-face (see p. 171).  But we =
also find it on the=20

stretcher of the walnut chair of the period (as illustrated, p. 171). Nor i=
s this all. Lambeth and=20

Bristol delft dishes contribute their paean in honour of the House of Orang=
e. On some a crown is=20

found, with the date 1690, the sole decoration of a plate some 9 inches in =
diameter. On others a=20

crown is shown on a cushion, with the sceptre and orb beside it. These are =
all contemporary with=20

other English delft dishes bearing crudely painted portraits of William and=
 Mary crowned.  Cardinal=20

Wolsey's coat of arms, as shown at Hampton Court, was two cherubs supportin=
g a cardinal's hat.=20



One can imagine that Queen Mary, backed by little Christopher Wren, brought=
 Daniel Marot and=20

Grinling Gibbons to put an end to all this. Accordingly, if one pays a pilg=
rimage to Hampton Court=20

one sees the carved angels triumphantly holding up the Protestant crown to =
supplant Wolsey's=20

former insignia of arrogant splendour under the old religion.  [Illustratio=

STRETCHER OF WALNUT CHAIR.  Of William and Mary period.]  [Illustration: BR=
ASS=20

SPANDREL OF DIAL OF CLOCK.  Showing design of angels supporting crown.]  In=
 regard to the=20

long continuance of this design, it is interesting to observe that it appea=
rs in plates attributed to the=20

Lowestoft factory. As a matter of=20


_
of the Franciscan friars and afterwards, by the appointment of a       Roya=
l Audiencia composed of=20

good men, friendly to all virtue.  3.3. One of this man's companions forced=
 eight thousand Indians=20

to work,       without any payment or food, at building a wall around his g=
reat       garden; they=20

dropped dead from hunger but he showed no concern       whatever.  4.4. Whe=
n this president, of=20

whom I said he finished devastating Panuco,       learned that the said goo=
d royal Audiencia was=20

coming, he found an       excuse to go inland to discover some place where =
he might tyrannise;=20

he forced fifteen, or twenty thousand men of the province of Mexico       t=
o carry the baggage of his=20

expedition, of some shipmaster. They usually celebrate the wedding of some =
persons in the=20

district, whose names are still known. They are decorated in blue, and have=
 two cherubs=20

supporting a heart, over which is a crown. There is one dated 1755, inscrib=
ed "Henry and Mary=20

Quinton, Yarmouth, Norfolk." Its Dutch origin is proven by the orthography =
with the two dots over=20

the letters _y_, and the misplacing of other letters: "Henry and Mary Q[.u]=
inton, Yarmo[.u]th, nor ff:=20

olk. 1755."  After the two cherubs on the clock spandrel came further flori=
ated designs minus the=20

cherub's head. This, later, disappeared, and the spandrel had only a matted=
 surface, in contrast to=20

the rest of the dial. This in turn disappeared when the=20


_
returned, all the rest having perished under his tyranny.  5.5. He arrived =
in the province of=20

Mechuacan, which is forty leagues       distant from Mexico and similar to =
it, both in prosperity, and=20

in       the number of its people.  The king and ruler came out to receive =
      him with a procession=20

of numberless people, rendering a thousand       services and making him pr=
esents; he at once=20

took the said king       prisoner because he was reputed to have great rich=
es of gold and       silver:=20

to force him to surrender his many treasures, the tyrant       began to put=
 him to the following=20

tortures.  6.6. Having put his feet in stocks, with his body stretched and =
his hands       tied to=20

pieces of wood, they placed a pan of fire near his feet, and       a boy wi=
th a sprinkler soaked in oil,=20

sprinkled them every now and       then to burn the skin well.  On the one =
side there stood a cruel=20

man       with a loaded arbalist aimed at his heart: on the other stood    =
   another holding a terrible=20

and fierce dog which, had he let it,       would have torn the king to piec=
es in a moment; glory of a=20

silvered hour circle and became a sheet of iron painted according to taste.=
 We give examples of=20

this--the Sussex dial depicting the iron works (p. 243) and the provincial =
style with the lunette=20

painted with a figure subject (p. 249). The end of the story is the china d=
ial of the painted=20

Hindeloopen Dutch clocks beloved of our childhood, with weights and chains =
and other pleasing=20

mechanism. Here the nineteenth century Dutch clock joins hands with the old=
 wall clock of the=20

seventeenth century, Dame Fashion having pirouetted round the dial, triflin=
g with all collectors in=20

"the whirligig of time."  =3DThe Evolution of the Hands.=3D--The early exam=
ples of the long-case clock=20

or of the lantern clock with one hand show a fine rich design in metal-work=
 in the hand itself. It was=20

brass, often gilded, or iron wrought with great skill and beauty. At the ad=
vent of the minute hand it=20

was made in character with its fellow. At first the dial had a _fleur-de-li=
s_, and later a slightly more=20

floriated use of this emblem on the hour circle between each hour. In old e=
xamples the hand,=20

when it came=20


_
tortured him to make him disclose the treasures; until a Franciscan       m=
onk, being informed of it,=20

delivered him from their hands, though       he died at last of his torture=
s.  They tortured and killed=20

many       lords and princes of the provinces in like fashion, to make them=
       give up their gold=20

and silver.  7.7. At this time a certain tyrant, going as inspector rather =
of the       purses and the=20

property of the Indians than of their souls and       bodies, found that so=
me Indians had hidden=20

their idols, as the       Spaniards had never taught them about another bet=
ter God.  He took       the=20

lords prisoner till they gave him the idols, thinking they would       be o=
f gold or silver, and because=20

they were not, he punished them       as though it were part of the design =
of the hand. It is only a=20

fancy, but, as no design comes by accident, it is very probable that such w=
as the idea of the old=20

dial engraver.  The study of hands is exceptionally interesting; they run t=
hrough a regular series of=20

styles, as varied as the ornamentation of the cases. Some of the designs ar=
e of exquisite balance=20

as specimens of delicate metal-work, in which the English have always been =
proficient. Their=20

character can be gauged by the expert clockmaker or connoisseur to such a n=
icety that it can be=20

seen at once if the clock has its original hands or not. Those of my reader=
s who wish to pursue=20

this subject will find the hands adequately treated and well illustrated in=
 _English Domestic=20

Clocks_, by Mr.=20


_
8.8. And not to be defrauded of this purpose, which was to rob, he       co=
mpelled the said lords to=20

buy back the idols from him: they bought       them with such gold and silv=
er as they could find, to=20

adore them as       their God like they were accustomed.  These are the vol=
ume which no student=20

of clocks should fail to consult as a practical and authoritative work.  In=
 regard to hands, it is=20

curious that the fashion of placing a minute hand to travel around the dial=
 with the hour hand has=20

established a method of reckoning time in a popular=20
