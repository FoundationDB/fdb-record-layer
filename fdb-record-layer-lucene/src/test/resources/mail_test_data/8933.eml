And before either Fleury or the sergeant or any of the Marats could even be=
gin to realise what was=20

happening, he had literally bounded across the room, and as he did so he kn=
ocked against the=20

hanging lamp which fell with a crash to the floor, scattering oil and broke=
n glass in every direction=20

and by its fall  It was the wild, plaintive, beautiful song of the voyageur=
 which had floated to them=20

on the morning air, softened by distance to a mere echo of sweet sound.  Af=
ter listening intently for=20

a few moments, the guide said gently: "Voyageurs."  Again they listened to =
the familiar sound,=20

which increased in volume and=20


_
once there arose a confusion and medley of terrified screams, of piercing s=
hrieks from the women=20

and the children, and of loud imprecations from the men. These mingled with=
 the hasty words of=20

command, with quick orders from Fleury and the sergeant, with the grounding=
 of arms and the=20

tramping of many feet, and with the fall of human bodies that happened to b=
e in the way of the=20

reckless adventurer and his flight.  "He is through the door," cried the me=
n who had been there on=20

guard.  "After him then!" shouted Fleury. "Curse you all for cowards and fo=
r fools."  The order had=20

no need to be repeated. The confusion, though great, had only been momentar=
y. Within a second=20

or less, Fleury and his sergeant had fought their way through to the door, =
urging the men to follow.=20

"After him ... quick!... he is heavily loaded ... he cannot have got far ..=
." commanded Fleury as=20

soon as he had crossed the threshold. "Sergeant, keep order within, and on =
your life see that no=20

one else escapes."     CHAPTER IX  THE PROCONSUL   I  From round the angle =
of the house=20

Martin-Roget and Chauvelin were already speeding along at a rapid pace.  "W=
hat does it all=20

mean?" queried the latter hastily.  "The Englishman--with the wench on his =
back? have you seen=20

him?"  "Malediction! what do you mean?"  "Have you seen him?" reiterated Fl=
eury hoarsely.  "No."=20

"He couldn't have passed you?"  "Impossible."  "Then unless some of us here=
 have eyes like cats=20

that limb of Satan will get away. On to him, my men," he called once more. =
"Can you see him?"=20

The darkness outside was intense. The north-westerly wind was whistling dow=
n the narrow street,=20

drowning the sound of every distant footfall: it tore mercilessly round the=
 men's heads, snatching=20

the bonnets from off their heads, dragging at their loose shirts and breech=
es, adding to the=20

confusion which already reigned.  "He went this way ..." shouted one.  "No!=
 that!" cried another.=20

"There he is!" came finally in chorus from several lusty throats. "Just cro=
ssing the bridge."  "After=20

him," cried Fleury, "an hundred francs to the man who first lays hands on t=
hat devil."  Then the=20

river towards them.  As yet nothing could be seen, for a thickly-wooded poi=
nt intervened.=20

Presently the song burst on them in full resonant chorus; at the same momen=
t two large north-

canoes--in all the brilliancy of orange-coloured bark, painted bows and ste=
rns, red-bladed paddles,=20

with crews of scarlet-capped or bare-headed men swept round the point with =
quick stroke, in time=20

to the rapid measure.  A cheer was the irrepressible impulse of the men on =
shore, causing the=20

newcomers to stop and listen.  "Perhaps," said Dan, "they may be your foes =
of the Hudson's Bay=20

Company."  "That may be so," returned the Nor'-west Chief, gravely.  The un=
furling of an "H.B.C."=20

(Hudson's Bay Company) flag proved that it was so, to a certainty, and the =
depressed Nor'-

westers did not cheer again; but the H B C men came on, paddling with wild =
vigour and cheering=20

hilariously.  "They seem in great spirits," growled the Nor'-west leader.  =
"We are almost as strong=20

as they, boys, and have the advantage of woods and cliffs.  Shall we fight =
and keep our=20

prisoners?"  "What is that white thing in the bow of the first canoe?" said=
 one of the men.  "It looks=20

like a flag," said another.  "If so, it is a flag of truce," observed Dan. =
 "They have something to say,=20

and do not want to fight."  "That may be trite, but we won't let _you_ be a=
t the conference,"=20

returned the leader, sternly.  "Come, four of you, lead them out of earshot=
.  Take your guns, and=20

use them if need be."  Four powerful fellows at once obeyed the order, and =
led the prisoners, who=20

had been once more bound, into the woods.  Once again Dan was tempted to of=
fer fierce=20

resistance, but he knew that the Hudson's Bay men were yet too far off to b=
e able to hear shouts--

at least to understand the meaning of them--and that it would be useless to=
 resist such a guard.=20

He therefore submitted to be led a mile or so into the woods, and finally w=
as permitted to sit down=20



with La Certe under a tree to await the result of the conference.  They had=
 not to wait long.  In less=20

than half-an-hour one of the younger among the Nor'-westers came bounding t=
owards=20


_
burden on his shoulder. He had just reached the foot of the bridge where a =
street lanthorn fixed on=20

a tall bracket on the corner stone had suddenly thrown him into bold relief=
. He had less than an=20

hundred metres start of his pursuers and with a wild cry of excitement they=
 started in his wake.  He=20

was now in the middle of the bridge--an unmistakable figure of a giant vagu=
ely silhouetted against=20

the light from the lanthorns on the further end of the bridge--seeming pret=
ernaturally tall and=20

misshapen with that hump upon his back.  From right and left, from under th=
e doorways of the=20

houses in the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie the Marats shouting.  "You are f=
ree, Messieurs--free!"=20

he cried, seizing both prisoners by the hands.  "We are no longer enemies!"=
  "Free!  What do you=20

mean?" demanded Dan, who fancied that the young man must have gone mad.  "T=
he companies=20

have joined!" he cried, excitedly.  "They are one!  We are all friends now;=
 but come and see and=20

hear for yourself."  Filled with wonder, and some small degree of hope, Dan=
 and La Certe followed=20

the young man, accompanied by their guards, who were not less mystified tha=
n themselves.=20

Arrived at their camping-place, they found that the canoes had brought a Ch=
ief Trader--or officer of=20

the Hudson's Bay=20
