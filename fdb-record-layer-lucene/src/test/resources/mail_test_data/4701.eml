=E2=80=99 The circumstance of the paschal taper clearly shows it   to have =
been written on holy Saturday, which fell that year on the 2d   of April, s=
ince Easter-day of 1491 was on the 3d of the same   month.=E2=80=94See _
Had he been the author of it, he would not have escaped death, or very grea=
t blame, considering=20

the commotion it caused, for he had then scarcely any power. As to what our=
 adversary says, that=20

the dress of the duke of Orleans was purposely made too tight, there is not=
 the smallest=20

appearance of truth in it, for at that time the duke was the thinnest of th=
e company.  =E2=80=98It is true, that=20

my lord of Orleans and the lord Philip de Bar had gone before the commencem=
ent of this ball to=20

visit the lady of Clermont, who had not come to the wedding held at the h=
=C3=B4tel de St Pol, for which=20

this entertainment was given, and on their return they found all the dresse=
s had been made use of.=20

This was the sole cause why the duke of Orleans was not dressed to make one=
 of the party.  =E2=80=98It is=20

an infamous lie to say, as our opponent has done, that the duke of Orleans =
wished to burn the=20

king our lord; for the duke and the lord Philip de Bar intended dressing th=
emselves in these=20

clothes, and, without thinking or intending any ill, they both told Peter d=
e Navarre to set fire to the=20

dresses of the savages, that when on fire they might run among the ladies t=
o frighten them. Peter=20

de Navarre is living, and he can prove the truth of this to the king. Let u=
s suppose, that in this=20

youthful frolic, my lord of Orleans should have set fire to one of the dres=
ses, as he had ordered the=20

same to be done to all, it is not credible that it could have been done thr=
ough malice or evil=20

intentions. It is then apparent, that what our adversary has asserted is a =
lie; and I comfort myself=20

with the words of the prophet,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Perdes omnes qui loquuntur =
mendacium,=E2=80=99=E2=80=94and in the 20th=20

chapter of Proverbs, =E2=80=98Qui profert mendacia peribit.=E2=80=99  =E2=
=80=98As to the alliances which our opponent says=20

the duke of Orleans entered into with Henry of Lancaster, at present callin=
g himself king of=20

England, to the prejudice of the king and realm, and colouring his assertio=
n by adding, that=20

Richard, late king of England, had assured the king of France, that his inf=
irmities were solely owing=20

to the machinations of the dukes of Milan and Orleans,=E2=80=94I answer, th=
at they are wicked=20

falsehoods; for when Henry of Lancaster came to France, he was most honoura=
bly received by=20

the princes of the royal family as their relation, and frequented the compa=
ny of the duke of Orleans=20

and others of the blood royal as of their kindred, when, as a friend to the=
 king, he formed an=20

alliance with the duke of Orleans publicly, and in the presence of the king=
 and princes of the blood,=20

which at the time was considered as perfectly lawful, and for the good of t=
he kingdom. This plainly=20

shows, that my lord of Orleans had made no alliance against king Richard; b=
ut what is more, at the=20

treaty of marriage of the king=E2=80=99s daughter, now duchess of Orleans, =
with king Richard, the duke of=20

Orleans and king Richard formed an alliance similar to that which the latte=
r had formed with the=20

king of France.  =E2=80=98After this, my lord of Orleans went to Calais, wh=
ere he was most amicably=20

received by king Richard as a very dear brother. In addition, when king Ric=
hard died, the duke of=20

Orleans showed great grief for it, and made an enemy of king Henry of Lanca=
ster, by the=20

challenges he sent him, accusing him of being guilty of the crime of high t=
reason against his=20

sovereign lord king Richard, offering to fight the said king Henry, in reve=
nge for the death of=20

Richard, either in single combat, or with any number of persons he might ch=
oose.  =E2=80=98These and=20

many more circumstances can be brought forward to prove that my lord of Orl=
eans had a strong=20

affection for king Richard, the sternum, who had not only rupture of the ki=
dneys, the liver, and the=20

spleen, but also of the lungs and of the heart. In the heart the apex was c=
ompletely detached and=20

floating in the pericardium, which was intact. There was no fracture of the=
 ribs nor subcutaneous=20

or sub-muscular ecchymoses. The age of the subject was thirty-two, so that =
the costal cartilages=20

were not probably ossified, which may have accounted for the absence of fra=
cture of the ribs.=20



_Crushes by the fall of heavy weights_ resemble the latter class of crushes=
, and differ from falls=20

from a height in the fact that the wounds are usually limited to one region=
. The lesions themselves=20

are more or less similar. Similar internal lesions may be caused by the com=
pression of the chest=20

and body by the knee of a murderer, which may occasion rupture of the inter=
nal organs, fractures=20

of ribs, etc. Thus, too, from the pressure of a crowd the ribs may be fract=
ured and the lungs=20

injured. It is particularly in these cases of injury from crushes or falls =
from a height that we may=20

have most difficulty, as far as the medical evidence goes, of distinguishin=
g between accident,=20

suicide, and murder. But the various points and considerations mentioned ab=
ove will sometimes=20

enable the medical witness to clear up the case. In some cases the non-medi=
cal evidence,=20

circumstantial and otherwise, may be sufficient of itself, or at least in c=
onjunction with the medical=20

evidence.  In falls from a less high place the difficulty is somewhat diffe=
rent, for here there may=20

arise the question between a fall and a contusion or contused wound, and th=
e question generally=20

lies between accident and murder, or, very rarely, between accident and sui=
cide. We have referred=20

to both of these questions above, and from the facts mentioned the case can=
 often be solved.   OF=20

MORE THAN ONE INJURY WHICH WAS THE FIRST INFLICTED?  We can sometimes tell =
the=20

order in which wounds were received, but the question is rarely answerable =
with certainty. If one=20

wound is mortal and one or more are not, whether the wounds are suicidal or=
 homicidal, it has=20

sometimes been considered that the former must have been inflicted last. Bu=
t we cannot admit=20

that as a general rule the most grave wound was the last inflicted. For the=
 murderer or suicide,=20

especially the former, may go on wounding after the infliction of a mortal =
wound, especially as it is=20

the exception, and not the rule, to die instantly after a mortal wound. Sev=
eral assailants may have=20

inflicted wounds at the same time, which would still further increase the d=
ifficulty. The question=20

might then arise, Which assailant had inflicted the mortal wound or which h=
ad first inflicted a=20

mortal wound? Under such circumstances, it would not be easy to give a spec=
ific answer. There=20

are several signs which may indicate which wound was first inflicted in cer=
tain cases. An=20

instrument may become duller or even bent or twisted after and on account o=
f the first wound, and=20

the subsequent wounds would vary accordingly. The wound of the clothes corr=
esponding to the=20

first stab-wound may be and often is only bloody internally, while the seco=
nd and following wounds=20

are bloody on both sides. The following case quoted by Taylor[659] from the=
 _Annales=20

d=E2=80=99Hygiene_, 1847, p. 461, illustrates this point. A man received th=
ree stabs from an assailant, one=20

in the back at the level of the eighth rib, traversing the lung and heart a=
nd causing rapid death, and=20

two on the left elbow, cutting the coat and shirt but only grazing the skin=
. The first one was=20

evidently the first inflicted, for both the wounds in=20


_
alliance by marriage with the king of France, and that he hated king Henry =
for having laid hands on=20

his sovereign.  =E2=80=98There is not more truth in what our adversary has =
advanced, that my lord of=20

Orleans, when with Pietro della Luna, exerted himself to obtain bulls to th=
e prejudice of the king=20

and his family, and on this account always favoured the said Pietro; for at=
 that time my lord of=20

Orleans had procured with this Pietro, then called Benedict, a very advanta=
geous alliance for the=20

king of France, by which he engaged to support the king and his family by e=
very means in his=20

power, as may be seen in the bulls issued to this effect. It is therefore v=
ery extraordinary, that any=20

man endowed with common sense should have asserted publicly things that are=
 evidently false.=20

=E2=80=98As to what our adversary says, that my lord of Orleans supported P=
ietro della Luna, I have before=20

answered it; and my lord proposed himself, that if the two rival popes did =
not speedily agree to=20

send commissioners to the council, France should withdraw itself from their=
 obedience.  =E2=80=98This was=20

more displeasing to Pietro della Luna than any thing that had been done in =
this kingdom relative to=20

church-affairs, and is not a sign that my lord of Orleans was desirous of r=
etarding an union of the=20

church in favour of Pietro della Luna. It is therefore evident, that the du=
ke of Orleans is innocent of=20

the charges that have been brought against him.  =E2=80=98O, lord king! may=
 it please thee to guard his=20

innocence by means of thy justice, according as it is written in the 13th c=
hapter of Job, =E2=80=98Justitia=20

custodit innocentis viam.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The fourth accusation of our a=
dversary is, That for the space of three=20

whole years my lord of Orleans, by his artful and deceitful tales, and advi=
ce to the queen,=20

attempted to prevail on her to quit the kingdom, with her children, and res=
ide in the county of=20

Luxembourg, that he might enjoy greater power in the government of the real=
m. So far is this=20

charge from being true, that my lord of Orleans did every thing in his powe=
r to honour and support=20

the queen during the melancholy illness of the king, of which it does not b=
ecome me to say more,=20

for, thanks to God, she is now present, and knows full well the truth of th=
is, and which she may=20

more fully declare whenever it may be her good pleasure so to do. I do not,=
 however, know that=20

she made any complaints on this subject to our adversary, or to any other p=
ersons. I believe the=20

contrary, to this charge of our opponent, will be found to be the truth; an=
d that it has been=20

purposely brought forward to defame the reputation of the deceased.  =E2=80=
=98The fifth accusation is, That=20

my lord of Orleans committed the crime of high treason in the third degree,=
 on the person of my=20

lord the dauphin, whose soul may God pardon! by compassing his death by mea=
ns of a poisoned=20

apple given to a child, from whom one of the nurses of the children of the =
duke of Orleans took it=20

by force, and gave it to one of the children of the duke of Orleans, and ca=
used its death, as well as=20

that of the dauphin, who also ate of it.  =E2=80=98This is an absolute fals=
ehood. True it is, that one of the=20

duke of Orleans=E2=80=99 children died about the time when this fact was su=
pposed to have taken place, of=20

a bowel complaint, which was then very prevalent, and carried off many othe=
rs. Let the physicians,=20

master William le Boucher and master John de Beaumont, be examined, who vis=
ited this child,=20

and they will declare the truth, that it did not die of poison.  =E2=80=98C=
onsider, my lords, the improbability of=20

a nurse of the children of the duke of Orleans daring to give an apple or p=
ear to any of them=20

without the express orders of the duchess of Orleans; and that when the nur=
se went to these=20

gardens with the child she was accompanied by several women of character, w=
ho would not have=20

suffered her to give it an apple, or any suchlike thing.  =E2=80=98O most n=
oble and well-beloved duke of=20

Acquitaine! while young, learn to love justice, and act like Solomon. Consi=
der the evils that may=20

happen unless justice be observed; and if thou neglectest it, thou wilt not=
 love thy brothers, for=20



they will be in danger of death if the doctrines of our adversary be not ch=
ecked. The prophet says,=20

=E2=80=98Justiti=C3=A6 Domini rect=C3=A6 l=C3=A6tificantes corda.=E2=80=99 =
 =E2=80=98The sixth crime alledged against the duke of Orleans=20

is, That he committed high treason in the fourth degree, by ruining the kin=
g in his finances, and by=20

oppressing the people with intolerable taxes, and quartering large bodies o=
f men at arms in=20

various parts of the country. My lords, it is very astonishing that our adv=
ersary should have made=20

this charge; for it is notorious to every one, that these taxes were not le=
vied in this kingdom for its=20

own concerns, nor were they for the profit of the duke of Orleans: they wer=
e proposed with great=20

deliberation of the king, the princes of his blood, and his council, for th=
e benefit of our adversary=20

himself, in his expedition to Hungary, and for the payment of the ransom of=
 himself and his army.=20

This was the cause of such heavy taxes being raised throughout the kingdom,=
 and of immense=20

sums of money being sent to Turkey, and other distant places, to the irrepa=
rable loss of the=20

country.  =E2=80=98When our adversary charges the duke of Orleans with havi=
ng taken four thousand francs=20

from the tower of the clothing on the arm were bloody externally at the edg=
es, although there was=20

no blood effused here. The correctness of this opinion was confirmed at the=
 trial.  The point of a=20

knife arrested and broken off in a bone may show that this was the last wou=
nd. The amount of=20

bleeding may show which was the first wound. Thus if several severe wounds =
have been inflicted,=20

all or several of which would naturally cause profuse hemorrhage, and one s=
howed signs of such=20

hemorrhage while another did not, the former would be likely to be the firs=
t wound inflicted. Or if=20

one showed slight hemorrhage where much would be expected, this fact would =
indicate that it was=20

one of the last inflicted. The absence of the signs of spurting blood may t=
ell which of two or more=20

fatal wounds were first inflicted, for this would indicate that this wound =
was inflicted when the heart=20

action was weakened by loss of blood or even after death, and the other wou=
nd or wounds which=20

did not present this sign would have been the first received. In fact, if a=
ny of the signs are present=20

about a wound which we have seen to indicate that a wound was inflicted at =
any time after death,=20

this would show that this wound was not the first received, and that the ot=
her or others were=20

inflicted earlier.  Questions as to the CONSEQUENCES of WOUNDS NOT FATAL ma=
y often be=20

brought up in civil actions for damages. In certain countries the question =
of the consequences as=20

to _incapacity_ may determine whether an injury shall be the ground of a cr=
iminal as well as of a=20

civil action. Thus in France an injury which involves an incapacity of twen=
ty days or more subjects=20

the assailant to a criminal action. The term =E2=80=9Cincapacity=E2=80=9D i=
n this instance refers to general incapacity=20

and not to incapacity for fine and professional work. The latter, however, =
comes in under the civil=20

action which may be instituted against the assailant or those directly or i=
ndirectly responsible for=20

the injury. The amount of the incapacity, its causes, whether due wholly or=
 partly or not at all to the=20

given injury, the probable duration of the incapacity, the treatment which =
it has and will=20

necessitate, and many other such questions form part of the medical testimo=
ny required in such=20

cases. Sometimes with slight wounds the results, accompaniments, and compli=
cations may=20

prolong the incapacity very greatly, as also the state of health and the ha=
bits of the wounded=20

person, the neglect of treatment, improper treatment, etc.  Any bodily or m=
ental infirmity or ill-

health which may result from an injury and its necessary treatment in the p=
ast and future, all these=20

questions and many more unnecessary to mention may be required of the medic=
al witness. No=20

general rules can be laid down for all such cases. In giving his testimony =
the medical man must=20

depend in any particular case upon his knowledge, judgment, and experience.=
  We can seldom=20



give a precise solution of the _question of survival_ to determine the succ=
ession or inheritance if=20

several of a family die together in an accident. In case of death from inan=
ition, cold or heat, or in=20

drowning especially, if some have wounds more or less grave in themselves, =
we can sometimes=20

form an opinion. With wounds we cannot often do so, although in case of mur=
der, the nature of the=20

wounds, the position of the bodies, the examination of the spot of the acci=
dent or tragedy, may=20

sometimes help us to form an opinion.   INCISED AND PUNCTURED WOUNDS AND WO=
UNDS=20

OF BLUNT INSTRUMENTS REGIONALLY CONSIDERED.  The several varieties of wound=
s=20

which we have been considering vary considerably in their nature, their eff=
ects, their danger, and=20

in many other ways according to the region of the body in which they are si=
tuated. Some of these=20

varieties are common in one situation and almost never occur in others. Alt=
hough the nature of=20

wounds found in the several regions of the body is not as important for a m=
edical jurist as their=20

danger and their influence in causing death, we will now consider the diffe=
rences they exhibit on=20

account of the region in which they occur.   WOUNDS OF THE HEAD.  These are=
 often=20

characterized by their apparent harmlessness and their real gravity sooner =
or later. We might=20

almost make the opposite statement and say that those apparently grave are =
often virtually=20

harmless, though this would be true only in a limited sense and in certain =
cases.  As to their=20

_nature_, we find punctured wounds extremely rarely, incised and lacerated =
wounds often, while=20

contusions and contused wounds are still more common. _Incised and lacerate=
d wounds_ of the=20

head involve the scalp almost exclusively. These wounds heal remarkably wel=
l, even when the=20

attachment is merely by a narrow pedicle, owing to the abundant blood-suppl=
y. Hemorrhage from=20

the incised wounds is often free, for the vessels cannot retract, but it is=
 seldom dangerous unless=20

the wounds are very extensive. The only way in which they differ materially=
 from similar wounds=20

elsewhere is in the greater frequency of complicating erysipelas here than =
elsewhere. This is=20

probably owing to the presence of septic conditions, as the head is general=
ly dirtier than other=20

parts of the body, and slight wounds especially are neglected. If the scalp=
 is shaved over a wide=20

margin and cleaned like other parts of the=20


_
from the castle of Melun,=E2=80=94I reply, that it is false: if any sums of=
 money were in the tower of the=20

palace, they were distributed according to orders from the king. In regard =
to the hundred thousand=20

francs in the castle of Melun, it is well known that the queen and the duke=
 of Orleans went thither=20

to amuse themselves,=E2=80=94during which time, our adversary very improper=
ly came to Paris with a=20

large body of men at arms, and forced the duke of Acquitaine to return thit=
her, instead of going, as=20

he intended, to join his mother the queen. He had collected this force of m=
en at arms with the=20

design of attacking the queen and the duke of Orleans in Melun, which, of c=
ourse, made it=20

necessary for her majesty to raise an army for her own defence, and for the=
 security of the king=20

and kingdom.  =E2=80=98She was therefore advised to make use of the money i=
n the castle of Melun for the=20

pay of the men at arms, but my lord of Orleans never touched one penny of i=
t; and when it came to=20

the knowledge of the king, he was well satisfied that it had been so applie=
d.  =E2=80=98It therefore appears,=20

that this sum of money was expended to oppose the damnable act of our adver=
sary, and for no=20

other cause. In regard to the men at arms said to have been kept on foot by=
 my lord of Orleans,=20

certainly some bodies of them, being quartered over the country, declared t=
hey were sent thither=20

by command of the duke of Orleans, in order that no one might dare to moles=
t them,=E2=80=94but they=20

had no letters or commissions from him. On the contrary, he was greatly dis=
pleased at the evil=20

acts they at times committed.  =E2=80=98When their conduct was laid before =
the king and council, the duke=20

of Orleans caused letters to be sent in the king=E2=80=99s name to all bail=
iffs and other officers throughout=20

the realm, ordering them to assemble the nobles and gentlemen of the countr=
y to force those who=20

committed such disgraceful acts to quit the kingdom, having first punished =
them for their wicked=20

conduct.  =E2=80=98O, duke of Burgundy! recollect the irreparable damages t=
hat have been done to many=20

parts of this realm by the bodies of men at arms which thou hast introduced=
 within it, many of=20

whom were foreigners, who wasted the countries they passed through, and eve=
ry one should feel=20

compassion for events of so pitiable a nature: they can never be enough bew=
ailed.  =E2=80=98O, thou king=20

of France! most excellent prince, deplore the death of thy only brother; fo=
r thou hast lost the most=20

precious jewel in thy crown, which thy justice ought to avenge, if no other=
 way be found.  =E2=80=98O, thou=20

most noble queen! weep for a prince who so greatly honoured thee, and whom =
thou hast seen so=20

infamously murdered.  =E2=80=98O thou, my most redoubted lord, duke of Acqu=
itaine! lament that thou hast=20

lost the most precious member of thy blood, council and state, which has ca=
used thee to fall from=20

peace into great tribulation.  =E2=80=98O, thou duke of Berry! grieve that =
thou hast seen the brother of the=20

king thy nephew thus disgracefully end his days, solely because he was brot=
her to the king, and=20

for no other reason.  =E2=80=98O, duke of Brittany! thou hast lost the brot=
her to thy duchess, who greatly=20

loved thee.  =E2=80=98O, thou duke of Bourbon! weep that thy friend is now =
buried under ground; and ye=20

other princes! join in lamentations, for the way is now opened to put ye al=

traitorously and unexpectedly.  =E2=80=98Mourn, men and women, old and youn=
g, rich and poor! for the=20

sweetness of peace and tranquillity is now torn from ye, by this assertion =
of the doctrine of=20

assassinating princes, whence wars and destruction must fall upon you.  =E2=
=80=98O, ye churchmen!=20

deplore the loss of a prince who was much attached to you, and who greatly =
respected all who=20

performed the divine service, from his love to God.  =E2=80=98Ye clerks, an=
d nobles of all degrees! consider=20

how ye will henceforward act; for our opponent has deceived you by his fals=
e arguments, and=20

caused you to favour his wickedness. But as ye are now aware of the murder =
committed on the=20

person of the duke of Orleans, of the falsity and lies published in our adv=
ersary=E2=80=99s defamatory libel,=20



and consequently of the innocence of my lord of Orleans,=E2=80=94should ye,=
 from this time forth, in any=20

way support the party of our adversary, know that it will be treason agains=
t the king, and you will=20

then incur the danger of losing your lives and fortunes, as usual in such c=
ases.  =E2=80=98Understand then,=20

princes and men of all degrees, that ye are bounden to assist in maintainin=
g the laws against the=20

duke of Burgundy, who, by this murderous act, has usurped the power and aut=
hority of the king=20

and his sons, and has deprived them of great aid and consolation; for he ha=
s brought the=20

commonweal into grievous tribulation by shamelessly violating the wholesome=
 statutes in=20

vindicating his offence against nobility, kindred, oaths, alliances and ass=
urances,=E2=80=94against God=20

and all his saints. This mischief cannot be amended except by the laws. To =
obtain this reparation,=20

my lady of Orleans and her children are now come before thee, O lord king! =
and the princes of thy=20

royal blood, supplicating you all to weigh well the injury that has been do=
ne to them, and to make=20

them amends in the manner required by her council, or in any other way, so =
that it may be publicly=20

known that her lord was cruelly murdered, and unjustly and falsely accused =
and defamed. By=20

doing this, you will perform your duty as you are bounden to do, and acquir=
e eternal life, as it is=20

written in the 21st chapter of Proverbs, =E2=80=98Qui sequitur justitiam in=
veniet vitam et gloriam,=E2=80=99=E2=80=94which=20

may God, oftener than with similar wounds elsewhere. The density of the sca=
lp is so great that the=20

redness and swelling accompanying inflammations is comparatively slight. If=
 erysipelas follows=20

slight wounds of the head, there is some reason to suspect constitutional p=
redisposition or=20

careless treatment. From infection of such wounds of the scalp abscess or d=
iffuse cellulitis of the=20

scalp may develop as well as erysipelas. The constitutional symptoms in suc=
h a case may be=20

marked or even severe, but the prognosis is favorable. In very rare cases n=
ecrosis of the skull may=20

result or the inflammation may even extend to the brain. These incised and =
lacerated wounds of=20

the scalp are usually accidental or inflicted by another; they are rarely s=
elf-inflicted. _Contusions=20

and contused wounds_ are the most common forms of injury to the head. These=
 two kinds of=20

injuries are almost invariably inflicted by another or are accidental. We h=
ave already seen that=20

contused wounds of the scalp or over the eyebrow may closely resemble incis=
ed wounds in these=20

localities. This fact should be borne in mind, as careful examination can u=
sually distinguish them if=20

they are fresh and until they begin to granulate. These wounds are liable t=
o the same=20

complications as incised wounds, in fact more liable, as the contusion make=
s the wound more=20

susceptible to inflammation and the edges are more apt to be infected at th=
e time of the injury.=20

One of the _results_ of contusions of the head is the extravasation of bloo=
d, most often between=20

the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis muscle and the pericranium. These=
 extravasations are=20

usually in the form of a hematoma. Such hematomata often present a hard cir=
cular or oval rim with=20

a softer centre, and may readily be mistaken for fracture of the skull with=
 depression. The=20

diagnosis between hematoma and depressed fracture is not usually difficult,=
 however, for with=20

hematoma the ridge is elevated above the level of the skull and is movable =
on the surface of the=20

skull; also the wounded edges often pit on pressure. With depressed fractur=
e, on the other hand,=20

the edge is at or about the level of the rest of the skull; it is sharper, =
more irregular, and less=20

evenly circular. Contusions and the resulting hematoma may occasionally end=
 by suppurating, but=20

this event is rare. Contusions and contused wounds may occasionally show th=
e marks of a=20

weapon, indicating that they were inflicted by another. Also the position o=
f the injury will indicate its=20

origin, whether it is accidental or inflicted by another, for the former wo=
uld not naturally occur on=20



the vertex unless the fall was from a considerable height.  Another result =
of injuries to the head,=20

especially of contusions and contused wounds, is FRACTURE OF THE SKULL. Thi=
s may be=20

simple or compound, depressed or not, etc. Fractures are serious inasmuch a=
s they imply a=20

degree of violence which may do damage to the brain. The fracture itself, e=
specially if properly=20

treated, affords a good prognosis, irrespective of any brain lesion. One va=
riety of fracture of the=20

skull offers an exception to this favorable prognosis, and that is fracture=
s of the base of the skull.=20

These may be fatal directly from injury of the vital centres at the base of=
 the brain or soon fatal=20

from hemorrhage in these parts. Or the fatal result may be secondary to an =
inflammation or=20

meningitis which good treatment is often unable to prevent. It should not b=
e considered that these=20

fractures are uniformly fatal, for quite a considerable proportion recover.=
 Fracture of the base=20

usually occurs as the result of a fall. The injured person may land on the =
feet or buttocks, and yet=20

receive a fracture of the base of the skull, the force of the fall being tr=
ansmitted through the spine=20

to the base of the skull. Fracture of the base of the skull usually occurs =
from an injury to the vault,=20

not by _contre coup_, but by extension of a fissure found higher up in the =
skull. This extension=20

takes place in the same meridian line of the skull with that of the force w=
hich produced the=20

fracture, and in this way the base of the skull is fractured in different p=
arts according to the point=20

and direction of the application of the force. Thus in case the force compr=
esses the skull antero-

posteriorly the fracture will pass antero-posteriorly toward the base from =
the front or the back,=20

whichever received the blow (see Fig. 13). Fractures of the vault of the sk=
ull occasionally occur=20

opposite to the point struck; this may occur by _contre coup_, but not alwa=
ys so, as not=20

infrequently in such rare cases a close examination may reveal an extension=
 of a fissure from the=20

point injured to the opposite pole of the skull. The shape and rarely the s=
ize of a fracture of the=20

skull, especially if punctured in character, may show the shape and more ra=
rely the size of the=20

instrument or object which produced it. Apart from fracture of the base, th=
e prognosis in fracture of=20

the skull is serious, mainly on account of the danger of inflammation, whic=
h is greater in compound=20

fractures, and also on account of the more remote danger of irritation from=
 depressed fragments=20

causing epilepsy, insanity, etc., at a later period.  [Illustration: FIG. 1=
