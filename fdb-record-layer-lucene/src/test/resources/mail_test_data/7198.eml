Ned Franks attempted no explanation. The easy-going, dracaena marginata merry chuckle. "But, joking apart, I don't think that Nancy is fit company for Mrs. Franks.

she knew that it must--not only according to Scripture, but the natural course of events--end in 

destruction, and she felt more keenly than ever that _the way of transgressors is hard_.  Nancy 

Sands was very low in spirits,--a reaction after excitement,--and she also, no doubt, missed the 

stimulant to which she come to the theatre. I did not even stop to take off my make-up, for though 

the play was an unusually short one, and all the actors and actresses had followed my example of 

prompt readiness for all four acts, it lacked twenty minutes of twelve when I was dressed. I had to

unhappy wife would certainly have all at once drowned uneasy thoughts by indulging in her fatal 

habit. Happily, however, on this night no supply of spirits was at hand, and perfectly sober, but 

deeply sad, Nancy Sands retired to rest.  But the enemy, who _goeth about as a lion seeking 

whom he may devour_, will not lightly leave hold of a victim on whom his deadly gripe has once 

been laid. While the Frankses were thankful for success of their first attempt to win Nancy from her 

course of misery and sin, they felt how utterly unable they were in themselves to work any 

effectual change. Fervent were their prayers to Him who willeth not that any should perish, that he,

to be late.  My electric carriage would be at the stage door, and my plan was to speak to 

Godensky, if he were waiting, if possible learn in a moment or two whether he had really found out 

the truth, and then act accordingly. But if I could avoid it, I meant, in any case, to put off a long 

conversation until later.  I had drawn my veil down before walking out of the theatre, yet Godensky 

knew me at once, and came forward. Evidently he had been watching the door.  "Good-evening," 

he said. "A hundred congratulations."  He put out his hand, and I had to give him mine, for my 

chauffeur and the stage-door keeper (to say nothing of Marianne, who followed me closely), and

exclaimed Ben Stone, the jovial carpenter, as Ned, on the following afternoon, was passing his 

shop, going with a party of young volunteers to work in Wild Rose Hollow.  "Why, what's in the 

wind?" asked Ned.  "To think of your having the tigress to tea with your wife! I wonder she hasn't

was exactly what might best please Count Godensky.  "I got your note," I answered, in Russian, 

though he had spoken in French. "What is it you want to see me about?"  "Something that can't be 

told in a moment," he said. "Something of great importance."  "I'm very tired," I sighed. "Can't it
