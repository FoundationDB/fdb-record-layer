philodendron monstera Aryaka has been designated by a soothsayer as our future king. Now everybody in my condition is running after him. I think I will join myself to him.                  It is unjust to the Pleiade to say that they aimed at overloading poetic diction with neologisms of classical origin; they sought to innovate with discretion; but philodendron monstera Aryaka has been designated by a soothsayer as our future king.

_Darduraka._ If he wins, he will pay you.  P. 63.12]  _Mathura._ And if he doesn't win? 

_Darduraka._ Then he won't pay you.  _Mathura._ This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, 

you can give him the money yourself. My name is Mathura. I'm a swindler and I play a crooked 

game, and I'm not afraid of anybody. You are an immoral scoundrel.  _Darduraka._ Who did you 

say was immoral?  _Mathura._ You're immoral.  _Darduraka._ Your father is immoral. [_He gives 

the shampooer a sign to escape._]  Antoine de Baif he received lessons from an excellent 

Hellenist, Jean Daurat, soon to be principal of the College Coqueret. At the College a group of 

students--Ronsard, Baif, Joachim du Bellay, Remi Belleau--gathered about the master. The 

"Brigade" was formed, which, by-and-by, with the addition of Jodelle and Pontus de Thyard, and 

including Daurat, became the constellation of the Pleiade. The seven associates read together, 

translated and imitated the classics; a common doctrine of art banded them

_Darduraka._ That is the way I gamble?  _Mathura._ Come, shampooer, pay me my ten gold-

pieces.  _Shampooer._ I'll pay you this very day. I'll pay at once. [_Mathura drags him about._] 

_Darduraka._ Fool! You may maltreat him when I am away, but not before my eyes.  [_Mathura 

seizes the shampooer and hits him on the nose. The shampooer bleeds, faints, and falls flat. 

Darduraka approaches and interferes. Mathura strikes Darduraka, and Darduraka strikes back._] 

_Mathura._ Oh, oh, you accursed hound! But I'll pay you for this.  _Darduraka._ My good fool, I 

was the vulgar ways of popular verse; poetry for them was an arduous and exquisite toil; its 

service was a religion. At length, in 1549, they flung out their manifesto--the _Defense et 

Illustration de la Langue Francaise_ by Du Bellay, the most important study in literary criticism of 

the century. With this should be considered, as less important manifestoes, the later _Art 

Poetique_ of Ronsard, and his prefaces to the _Franciade_. To formulate principles is not always 

to the advantage of a movement in literature; but champions need a banner, reformers can

_Mathura._ Yes, I'll open my eyes.  _Darduraka._ How will you open your eyes?  _Mathura._ 

[_Opening his eyes wide._] This is the way I'll open my eyes.  [_Darduraka throws dust in 

Mathura's eyes, and gives the shampooer a sign to escape. Mathura shuts his eyes and falls 

down. The shampooer escapes._]  [35.20. S.  _Darduraka._ [_Aside._] I have made an enemy of 

the influential gambling-master Mathura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my the popular 

conception of the ignorant the Pleiade maintained that poetry was a high and difficult form of art; 

against the pedantry of humanism they maintained that the native tongue of France admitted of 

literary art worthy to take its place beside that of Greece or Rome. The French literary vocabulary, 

they declared, has excellences of its own, but it needs to be enriched by technical terms, by words 

of local dialects, by prudent adoptions from Greek and Latin, by judicious developments of the 

existing families of words, by the
