P. 126.7]  _Maid._ If you=20

would stop star-gazing, sir, you would see her.  _Maitreya._ [_Perceives Va=

approaches._] Heaven bless you!  _Vasantasena._ [_Speaking in Sanskrit._[58=
]] Ah, Maitreya!=20

[_Rising._] You are very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.  _Maitrey=
a._ When you are=20

seated, madam. [_They both seat themselves._]  _Vasantasena._ Is the mercha=
nt's son well?=20

_Maitreya._ Well, madam.  _Vasantasena._ Tell me, good Maitreya,      Do fr=
iends, like birds, yet=20

seek a shelter free     Beneath the modest boughs of this fair tree,     Wh=
ose leaves are virtues,=20

           32  _Maitreya._=20

[_Aside._] A good description by a naughty woman. [_Aloud._] They do, indee=

Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?  _Maitreya._ Listen, madam. Th=

Charudatta folds his hands[59] and requests--  _Vasantasena._ [_Folding her=
 hands._] And=20

commands--  _Maitreya._ He says he imagined that that golden casket was his=
 own and gambled=20

it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master has gone, for he is emp=
loyed in the king's=20

business.  [74.9. S.  _Maid._ Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman h=
as turned gambler.=20

_Vasantasena._ depreciated--THEOPHILE DE VIAU. A Huguenot who had abjured h=
is faith,=20

afterwards pursued as a libertine in conduct and as a freethinker, Theophil=
e was hunted,=20

imprisoned, exiled, condemned to execution, and died exhausted in 1626, whe=
n only six-and-thirty=20

years old. He has been described as the last lyrical poet of his age, and t=
he first of the poetical=20

exponents of the new preciosity. His dramatic _Pyrame et Thisbe_, though di=
sfigured by those=20

_concetti_ which the Italian Marini--an honoured guest at the French court-=
-and the invasion of=20

Spanish tastes had made the mode, is not without touches of genuine pathos.=
 The odes of=20

Theophile are of free and musical movement, his descriptions of natural bea=
uty are graciously=20

coloured, his judgment in literary matters was sound and original; but he l=
acked the patient=20

workmanship which art demands, and in proclaiming himself on the side of fr=
eedom as against=20

order, he was retrograding from the position which had been secured for poe=
try under the=20

leadership of Malherbe.  With social order came the desire for social refin=
ement, and following the=20

desire for refinement came the prettinesses and affectations of over-curiou=
s elegance. Peace=20

returned to France with the monarchy of Henri IV., but the Gascon manners o=
f his court were rude.=20

Catherine de Vivonne, Marquise de Rambouillet, whose mother was a great Rom=
an lady, and=20

whose father had been French ambassador at Rome, young, beautiful, delicate=
ly nurtured, retired=20

in 1608 from the court, and a few years later opened=20

that he says he gambled it away. I love him for that.  _Maitreya._ He reque=
sts that you will=20

therefore be good enough to accept in its place this necklace of pearls.  _=
Vasantasena._=20

[_Aside._] Shall I show him the jewels? [_Reflecting._] No, not yet.  _Mait=
reya._ Why don't you=20

take this necklace?  _Vasantasena._ [_Laughs and looks at her friend._] Why=
 should I not take the=20

necklace, Maitreya? [_She takes it and lays it away. Aside._] How is it pos=
sible that drops of=20

honey fall from the mango-tree, even after its blossoms are gone? [_Aloud._=
] Sir, pray tell the=20

worthy gambler Charudatta in my name that I shall pay him a visit this even=
ing.  _Maitreya._=20

[_Aside._] What else does she expect to get out of a visit to our house? [_=
Aloud._] Madam, I will=20

tell him--[_Aside_ to have nothing more to do with this courtezan.         =
             [_Exit._=20

_Vasantasena._ Take these jewels, girl. Let us go and bring cheer to Charud=
atta.  _Maid._ But=20

mistress, see! An untimely storm is gathering.  _Vasant._      The clouds m=
ay come, such noble=20

and cultivated persons as were willing to be the courtiers of womanly grace=
 and wit and taste. The=20

rooms were arranged and decorated for the purposes of pleasure; the _chambr=
e bleue_ became=20

the sanctuary of polite society, where Arthenice (an anagram for "Catherine=
") was the high=20

priestess. To dance, to sing, to touch the lute was well; to converse with =
wit and refinement was=20

something more admirable; the _salon_ became a mart for the exchange of ide=
as; the fashion of=20

Spain was added to the fashion of Italy; Platonism, Petrarchism, Marinism, =
Gongorism, the spirit of=20

romance and the daintinesses of learning and of pedantry met and mingled. H=
ither came=20

Malherbe, Racan, Chapelain, Vaugelas; at a later time Balzac, Segrais, Voit=
ure, Godeau; and=20

again, towards the mid-years of the century, Saint-Evremond and La Rochefou=
cauld. Here=20

Corneille read his plays from the _Cid_ to _Rodogune_; here Bossuet, a marv=
ellous boy,=20

improvised a midnight discourse, and Voiture declared he had never heard on=
e preach so early or=20

so=20
