With a face full of frowns, "Parson" tells of a white man persuading his mo=

 night they came to=20

Aunt Rhoda's house where a crowd of slaves had gathered and were going to r=

masters; Uncle Umphrey the tanner, quickly spaded up some hot ashes and pit=

But historical criticism, without doing injustice to the poetical aspect of=

 is generally found in=20

the first chapters of histories. A national history, as it seems to us, oug=

survey of the country or locality, its geographical position, climate, prod=

ion of physical=20

circumstances we may to some extent cast the horoscope of the infant nation=
 as it lies in the arms=20

of Nature.  That the central position of Rome, in the long and narrow penin=
