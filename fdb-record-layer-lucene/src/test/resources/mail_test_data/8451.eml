philodendron monstera  "Oh! no. I am three hundred ahead of this cuss yet, and--"  "You'd better quit where you are!" said the other, decisively. "You'll lose the next round, mark my word."  "Ha! ha!" laughed a full-fledged carpenter?  No?  Well, I am.  Come into my carpenter-shop."  And he led the way into a front-basement room where was a complete carpenter's outfit.  "You know I am a doctor," philodendron monstera  "Oh! no. I am three hundred ahead of this cuss yet, and--"  "You'd better quit where you are!" said the other, decisively. "You'll lose the next round, mark my word."  "Ha! ha!" laughed a full-fledged carpenter?  No?  Well, I am.  Come into my carpenter-shop."  And he led the way into a front-basement room where was a complete carpenter's outfit.  "You know I am a doctor," _
of it forthwith.  "Hello!" and the sharp swore roundly. "Who told _you_ to mix in your lip, pilgrim?" 

"Nobody, as I know of. Thought I'd squat right here, and watch your _sleeves_!" was the 

significant retort, and the youth laid a cocked six-shooter on the table in front of him.  "Go on, 

gentlemen; don't let me be the means of spoiling your fun."  The gambler uttered a curse, and 

dealt out the pasteboards.  The youth was watching him intently, with his sharp black eyes.  He 

was of medium hight, straight as an arrow, and clad in a loose-fitting costume. A broad sombrero 

was set jauntily upon the left side of his head, the hair of which had been cut close down to the 

scalp. His face--a pleasant, handsome, youthful face--was devoid of hirsute covering, he having 

evidently been recently handled by the barber.  The game between Mr. Redburn and the gambler 

progressed; the eyes of he whom we have just described were on the card sharp constantly.  The 

the next day.  Edward naively told him that he could come as early as Doctor Holmes liked--by 

breakfast-time, he was assured, as Edward was all alone!  Doctor Holmes's amusement at this 

ingenuous note may be imagined.  Within the hour the messenger brought back this answer:   MY 

DEAR BOY:  I shall certainly look for you to-morrow morning at eight o'clock to have a piece of pie 

with me.  That is real New England, you know.  Very cordially yours,  OLIVER WENDELL 

HOLMES.   Edward was there at eight o'clock.  Strictly speaking, he was there at seven-thirty, and 

found the author already at his desk in that room overlooking the Charles River.  "Well," was the 

cheery greeting, "you couldn't wait until eight for your breakfast, could you?  Neither could I when I 

was a boy.  I used to have my breakfast at seven," and then telling the boy all about his boyhood, 

the cheery poet led him to the dining-room, and for the first time he breakfasted away from home

Pilgrim Redburn raked in the stakes.  "Thunder 'n' Moses!" ejaculated the sharp, pulling out his 

watch--an elegant affair, of pure gold, and studded with diamonds--and laying it forcibly down 

upon the table.  "There! what will you plank on that!"  Redburn took up the time-piece, turned it 

over and over in his hands, opened and shut it, gave a glance at the works, and then handed it 

over to the youth, whom he instinctively felt was his friend. Redburn had come from the East to dig 

gold, and therefore was a stranger in Deadwood.  "What is its money value?" he asked, 

familiarizing his tone. "Good, I suppose."  "Yes, perfectly good, and cheap at two hundred," was 

the unhesitating reply. "Do you lack Autocrat" at his own breakfast-table!  A cosier time no boy 

could have had.  Just the two were there, and the smiling face that looked out over the plates and 

cups gave the boy courage to tell all that this trip was going to mean to him.  "And you have come 

on just to see us, have you?" chuckled the poet. "Now, tell me, what good do you think you will get 

out of it?"  He was told what the idea was: that every successful man had something to tell a boy, 

that would be likely to help him, and that Edward wanted to see the men who had written the 

books that people enjoyed.  Doctor Holmes could not conceal his amusement at all this.  When 

breakfast was finished, Doctor Holmes said: "Do you know that
