you can slape in your bed, when you are so hard on poor folks."  Mrs. McCar=
ty departed with her=20

money, and Eliakim fixed his sharp eyes on the next customer. It was a tall=
 man, shabbily dressed,=20

with a thin, melancholy-looking face, and the expression of one who had str=
uggled with the world,=20

and failed in the struggle.  "How much for this?" he asked, pointing to the=
 violin, and speaking in a=20

slow, deliberate tone, as if he did not feel at home in the language.  "Wha=
t do you want for it?"=20

"Ten dollar," he answered.  "Ten dollars! You're crazy!" was the contemptuo=
us comment of the=20

pawnbroker.  "He is a very good violin," said the man. "If you would like t=
o hear him," and he made=20

a movement as if to play upon it.  "Never mind!" said Eliakim. "I haven't a=
ny time to hear it. If it=20

were new it would be worth something; but it's old, and----"  "But you do n=
ot understand,"=20

interrupted the customer, eagerly. "It is worth much more than new. Do you =
see, it is by a famous=20

maker? I would not sell him, but I am poor, and my Bettina needs bread. It =
hurts me very much to=20

let him go. I will buy him back as soon as I can."  "I will give you two do=
llars, but I shall lose on it,=20

unless you redeem it."  "Two dollar!" repeated the Italian. "Ocielo! it is =
nothing. But Bettina is at=20

home without bread, poor little one! Will you not give three dollar?"  "Not=
 a cent more."  "I will take=20

it."  "There's your money and ticket."  And with these the poor Italian dep=
arted, giving one last=20

lingering glance at his precious violin, as Eliakim took it roughly and dep=
osited it upon a shelf=20

behind him. But he thought of his little daughter at home, and the means of=
 relief which he held in=20

his hand, and a smile of joy lightened his melancholy features. The future =
might be dark and=20

unpromising, but for three days, at any rate, she should not want bread.  P=
aul's turn came next.=20

"What have you got?" asked the pawnbroker.  Paul showed the ring.  Eliakim =
took it, and his small,=20

beadlike eyes sparkled avariciously as he recognized the diamond, for his e=
xperience was such=20

that he could form a tolerably correct estimate of its value. But he quickl=
y suppressed all outward=20

manifestations of interest, and said, indifferently, "What do you want for =
it?"  "I want twenty=20

dollars," said Paul, boldly.  "Twenty dollars!" returned the pawnbroker. "T=
hat's a joke."  "No, it=20

isn't," said Paul. "I want twenty dollars, and you can't have the ring for =
less."  "If you said twenty=20

shillings, I might give it to you," said Eliakim; "but you must think I am =
a fool to give twenty dollars."=20

"That's cheap for a diamond ring," said Paul. "It's worth a good deal more.=
"  The pawnbroker eyed=20

Paul sharply. Did the boy know that it was a diamond ring? What chance was =
there of deceiving=20

him as to its value? The old man, whose business made him a good judge, dec=
ided that the ring=20

was not worth less than two hundred and fifty dollars, and if he could get =
it into his possession for=20

a trifle, it would be a paying operation.  "You're mistaken, boy," he said.=
 "It's not a diamond."=20

"What is it?"  "A very good imitation."  "How much is it worth?"  "I'll giv=
e you three dollars."  "That=20

won't do. I want to raise twenty dollars, and if I can't get that, I'll kee=
p the ring."  The pawnbroker=20

saw that he had made a mistake. Paul was not as much in need of money as th=
e majority of his=20

customers. He would rather pay twenty dollars than lose the bargain, though=
 it went against the=20

grain to pay so much money. But after pronouncing the stone an imitation, h=
ow could he rise much=20

above the offer he had already made? He resolved to approach it gradually. =
Surveying it more=20

closely, he said:  "It is an excellent imitation. I will give you five doll=
ars."  Paul was not without=20

natural shrewdness, and this sudden advance convinced him that it was, afte=
r all, a real stone. He=20

determined to get twenty dollars or carry the ring home.  "Five dollars won=
't do me any good," he=20

said. "Give me back the ring."  "Five dollars is a good deal of money," sai=
d Eliakim.  "I'd rather=20

have the ring."  "What is your lowest price?"  "Twenty dollars."  "I'll giv=
e you eight."  "Just now you=20



said it was worth only three," said Paul, sharply.  "It is very fine gold. =
It is better than I thought.=20

Here is the money."  "You're a little too fast," said Paul, coolly. "I have=
n't agreed to part with the=20

ring for eight dollars, and I don't mean to. Twenty dollars is my lowest pr=
ice."  "I'll give you ten,"=20

said the old man, whose eagerness increased with Paul's indifference.  "No,=
 you won't. Give me=20

back the ring."  "I might give eleven, but I should lose money."  "I don't =
want you to lose money,=20

and I've concluded to keep the ring," said Paul, rightly inferring from the=
 old man's eagerness that=20

the ring was much more valuable than he had at first supposed.  But the old=
 pawnbroker was=20

fascinated by the sparkling bauble. He could not make up his mind to give i=
t up. By fair means or=20

foul he must possess it. He advanced his bid to twelve, fourteen, fifteen d=
ollars, but Paul shook his=20

head resolutely. He had made up his mind to carry it to Ball & Black's, or =
some other first-class=20

jewelers, and ascertain whether it was a real diamond or not, and if so to =
obtain an estimate of its=20

value.  "I've changed my mind," he said. "I'll keep the ring. Just give it =
back to me."    CHAPTER=20

XVI  THE JEWELER'S PRICE  But to give it back was not Eliakim's intention. =
Should he buy it at=20

twenty dollars, he would make at least two hundred, and such bargains were =
not to be had every=20

day. He decided to give Paul his price.  "I will give you twenty dollars," =
he said; "but it is more than=20

the ring is worth."  "I have concluded not to take twenty dollars," said Pa=
ul. "You may give it back."=20

"You agreed to take twenty dollars," said Eliakim, angrily.  "That was when=
 I first came in. You said=20

you in its entirety, doubting no dogma, being pleased with every saint, but=
 yet still hankered after=20

fetish, which he remembered as a child, and seemed to think not incompatibl=
e with Christianity, as=20

rendering it more animistic and familiar, smoothing away its angularities, =
blotting whatever share=20

of reason it may have away, and, above all, giving more scope, if possible,=
 to faith, and thereby=20

opening a larger field of possibilities to the believer=E2=80=99s mind.  So=
 Luis with others of his kind, as=20

Jango, Jico, and Manduco, became our friends, looking upon us with that res=
pect mixed with=20

contempt which is the attitude of those who see that you possess the myster=
ious arts of reading=20

and of writing, but cannot see a horse=E2=80=99s footprint on hard ground; =
or if you lose yourself, have to=20

avail yourself of what Luis referred to as =E2=80=9Cthe one-handed watch th=
e sailors use, which points the=20

way to go.=E2=80=9D  Much did Xavier talk of the Indians of the woods, the =
=E2=80=9CBugres,=E2=80=9D as the Brazilians call=20

them; about the =E2=80=9CBotocudos,=E2=80=9D who wear a plug stuck in their=
 lower lip, and shape their ears with=20

heavy weights in youth, so that they hang upon their shoulders; and much ab=
out those =E2=80=9CInfidel=E2=80=9D=20

who through a blowpipe direct a little arrow at the travelling =E2=80=9CChr=
istians=E2=80=9D in the woods, whose=20

smallest touch is death.  It then appeared his father (fica agora na gloria=
) was a patriot, that is,=20

=E2=80=99twas he who extirpated the last of all the =E2=80=9CInfidel=E2=80=
=9D from the forests where they lived.  Most=20

graphically did he tell how the last Indians were hunted down with dogs, an=
d in a pantomime he=20

showed how they jumped up and fell when they received the shot, and putting=
 out his tongue and=20

writhing hideously, he imitated how they wriggled on the ground, explaining=
 that they were worse=20

to kill than is a tapir, and put his father and the other patriots to much =
unnecessary pain.  And as=20

he talked, the woods, the fields, the river and the plain bathed in the sun=
, which unlike that of=20

Africa does not seem weary of its task, but shines unwearied, looking as it=
 does on a new world=20

and life, shimmered and blazed, great lizards drank its rays flattening the=
mselves upon the stones=20

in ecstasy, humming-birds quivered at the heart of every flower; above the =
stream the dragon-flies=20

hung poised; only some =E2=80=9CInfidel=E2=80=9D whom the patriots had dest=
royed seemed wanting, and the=20

landscape looked incomplete without a knot of them in their high feather cr=
owns stealthily stealing=20



round a corner of the woods.  In the uncomprehended future, incomprehensibl=
e and strange, and=20

harder far to guess at than the remotest semi-comprehended past, surely the=
 Spanish travellers=20

and their writings will have a value quite apart from that of any other boo=
ks.  For then the world will=20

hold no =E2=80=9CBugres=E2=80=9D; not a =E2=80=9CBotocudo=E2=80=9D will be =
left, and those few Indian and Negro tribes who yet=20

persist will be but mere travesties of the whites: their customs lost, thei=
r lore, such as it was,=20

despised; and we have proved ourselves wiser than the Creator, who wasted s=
o much time=20

creating beings whom we judged unfit to live, and then, in mercy to ourselv=
es and Him, destroyed,=20

so that no evidence of His miscalculated plan should last to shame Him when=
 He thought of His=20

mistake.  So to this end (unknowingly) the missionary works, and all the Je=
suits, those who from=20

Paraguay through the Chiquitos, and across the Uruguay, in the dark Moxos, =
and in the forests of=20

the Andes, gave their lives to bring as they thought life everlasting to th=
e Indians=E2=80=94all were fools.=20

Better by far instead of Bibles, lives of saints, water of baptism, crucifi=
xes, and all the tackle of=20

their trade, that they had brought swords, lances, and a good cross-bow eac=
h, and gone to work in=20

the true scientific way, and recognized that the right way with savages is =
to preach heaven to them=20

and then despatch them to it, for it is barbarous to keep them standing wai=
ting as it were, just at=20

the portals of eternal bliss.  And as we lingered at Cruz Alta, Christmas d=
rew near, and all the=20

people began to make =E2=80=9Cpesebres,=E2=80=9D with ox and ass, the three=
 wise men, the star of Bethlehem, the=20

Redeemer (not of the Botocudos and the Bugres) swaddled and laid in straw. =
 Herdsmen and=20

negroes dismounted at the door, fastened their half-wild mules or horses ca=
refully to posts,=20

removed their hats, drawing them down over their faces furtively, and then =
walked in on tiptoe,=20

their heavy iron spurs clanking upon the ground, to see the Wondrous Child.=
  They lounged about=20

the room, speaking in whispers as he might awake, and then departed silentl=
y, murmuring that it=20

was =E2=80=9Cfermosisimo,=E2=80=9D and getting on their horses noiselessly =
were gone, and in a minute=20

disappeared upon the plain.  Then came the Novena with prayer and carols, t=
he prayers read by=20

Xavier himself out of a tattered book, all the assembled family joining wit=
h unction in the=20

responses, and beating on their breasts.  Luis and all the slaves joined in=
 the carols lustily,=20

especially in one sung in a minor key long-drawn-out as a sailor=E2=80=99s =
shanty, or a forebitter sung in a=20

calm whilst waiting for a breeze.  After each verse there was a kind of cho=
rus calling upon the=20

sinner to repent, bidding him have no fear but still hold on, and thus exho=
rting him=E2=80=94      =E2=80=9CChegai,=20

Chegai, pecador, =C3=A1o pe da cruz     Fica nosso Senhor.=E2=80=9D  Christ=
mas Day found us all at mass in the=20

little church, horses and mules being tied outside the door to the trees in=
 the plaza, and some left=20

hobbled, and all waiting as if St. Hubert was about to issue forth and bles=
s them.  Painfully and=20

long, the preacher dwelt upon the glorious day, the country people listenin=
g as it were new to=20

them, and as if all the events had happened on the plain hard by.  In the e=
vening rockets=20

announced the joyful news, and the stars shone out over the woods and plain=
s as on the evening=20

when the bright particular star guided the three=20


_
"I have changed my mind."  "So have I," said Paul. "You had a chance to get=
 it, but now it's too=20

late."  Eliakim was deeply disappointed. Generally he had his own way with =
his customers, who,=20

being in urgent need of money, were obliged to accept such terms as he chos=
e to offer. But now=20

the tables were turned, and Paul proved more than a match for him. He resol=
ved to attempt=20

intimidation.  "Boy, where did you get this ring?" he asked, in a significa=
nt tone.  "Honestly," said=20

Paul. "That's all you need to know."  "I don't believe it," said the old ma=
n, harshly. "I believe you=20

stole it."  "You may believe what you like, but you must give it back to me=
," said Paul, coolly.  "I've=20

a great mind to call a policeman," said Eliakim.  "If you did," said Paul, =
"I'd tell him that you were=20

anxious to get the ring, though you believed it to be stolen. Perhaps he mi=
ght have something to=20

say to you."  Eliakim perceived the force of Paul's argument, for in law th=
e receiver of stolen goods=20

is as bad as the thief, and there had been occasions when the pawnbroker ha=
d narrowly escaped=20

punishment for thus indirectly conniving at theft.  "If such place as was t=
he rancho of our host.=20

Christmas rejoicings over, a month sped past and found us still, so to spea=
k, wind-bound in the=20

little town.  No one would buy our horses, some of which died bitten by sna=
kes.  It was impossible=20

to think of going on, and to return equally difficult, so that there seemed=
 a probability of being=20

obliged to pass a lifetime in the place.  People began to look at us half i=
n a kindly, half=20

contemptuous way, as people look in general upon those who fail, especially=
 when they=20

themselves have never tried to do anything at all but live, and having done=
 it with considerable=20

success look upon failure as a sort of minor crime, to be atoned for by hum=
ility, and to be=20

reprobated after the fashion of adultery, with a half-deprecating laugh.  S=
ometimes we borrowed=20

ancient flint-lock guns and lay in wait for tapirs, but never saw them, as =
in the thick woods they=20

move as silently as moles in sand, and leave as little trace.  Luis told of=
 how, mounted on a half-

wild horse, he had long ago lassoed a tapir, and found himself and horse dr=
agged slowly and=20

invincibly towards a stream, the horse resisting=20


_
his tune. "What will you take?"  "I don't care about selling to-day," answe=
red Paul.  "I'll give you=20

twenty-five dollars."  "I can't sell without consulting my mother. It belon=
gs to her."  Reluctantly=20

Eliakim gave back the ring, finding his wiles of no effect.  "Bring your mo=
ther round to-morrow," he=20

said. "I'll give you a better price than you will get anywhere else."  "All=
 right," said Paul. "I'll tell her=20

what you say."  The old pawnbroker followed Paul with wistful glances, vain=
ly wishing that he had=20

not at first depreciated the ring to such an extent, that his subsequent ad=
vances had quite cool, so=20

that at last he had to cut his lasso and escape from what he called the gre=
atest peril of his life; he=20

thought he was preserved partly by the interposition of the saints and part=
ly by a =E2=80=9Cfeti=C3=A7o=E2=80=9D which, in=20

defiance of religion, he luckily had hanging round his neck.  Just when all=
 hope was gone, and we=20

thought seriously of leaving the horses to their fate, and pushing on with =
some of the best of them=20

towards Rio, a man appeared upon the scene, and offered to buy them, half f=
or money and half =E2=80=9Ca=20
