jack-knife!" or "Come, jelly-roll!" or "Come, rain!" according to his particular desires of the particular 

moment. I think he really caught it from an illustration in _The Arabian Nights_, from the picture of 

Cassim grandiloquently proclaiming "Open Sesame!" He is an imaginative little beggar. "Mummy," 

he said to me the other night, "see all the moonlight that's been spilled on the grass!" But children 

are made that way. Even my sage little Poppsy, when a marigold-leaf fell in the bowl of our solitary 

gold-fish, cried out to me: "See, Mummy, our fish has had a baby!" Sex is still an enigma to her, as 

much an enigma as it was away last spring when, not being quite sure whether her new kitten was 

a little boy-cat or a little girl-cat, she sagaciously christened it "Willie-Alice." And a few weeks later, 

when the unmistakable appearance of tail-feathers finally persuaded even her optimistic young 

heart that the two chicks which had been bequeathed to her were dishearteningly masculine in 

their tendencies, she officially re-christened the apostate "Elaine" and "Rowena," and thereafter 

solemnly accepted them as "Archie" and "Albert." And while speaking of this mysteriously 

ramifying factor of sex, I am compelled to acknowledge that I encountered a rather disturbing little 

back-flare of Freudian hell-fire only a couple of evenings ago. It took my thoughts galloping back to 

the time in our post-nuptial era when Dinky-Dunk went Berserker and chased me around the 

haystacks with my hair flying. I'd taken Dinkie upon my lap, and, without quite knowing it, sat 

stroking his frowsy young head. My thoughts, in fact, were a thousand miles away. Then, still 

without giving much attention to what I was doing, I squeezed that warm little body up close 

against my own. I was astounded, the next moment, to see my small offspring turn on me with all 

the lusty fierceness of the cave man. He got his arms about me and buried his face in my neck 

and kissed me as no gentleman, big or  Abe was tired of his home, as a son of Thomas Lincoln 

might be, without disparagement to his filial piety; and he was glad to get off with a neighbour on a 

commercial trip down the river to New Orleans. The trip was successful in a small way, and Abe 

soon after repeated it with other companions. He shewed his practical ingenuity in getting the boat 

off a dam, and perhaps still more signally in quieting some restive hogs by the simple expedient of 

sewing up their eyes. In the first trip the great emancipator came in contact with the negro in a way 

that did not seem likely to prepossess him in favour of the race. The boat was boarded by negro 

robbers, who were repulsed only after a fray in which Abe got a scar which he carried to the grave. 

But he saw with his own eyes slaves manacled and whipped at New Orleans; and though his 

sympathies were not far-reaching, the actual sight of suffering never failed to make an impression 

on his mind. "In 1841," he says, in a letter to a friend, "you and I had together a tedious low-water 

trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from 

Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together 

with irons. That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I touch 

the Ohio or any other slave border." A negrophilist he never became. "I protest," he said 

afterwards, when engaged in the slavery controversy, "against the counterfeit logic which 

concludes that because I do not want a black woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a 

wife. I need not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some respects she certainly is not 

my equal; but in her natural right to eat the bread which she earns with her own hands she is my 

equal and the equal of all others." It would be difficult to put the case better.  While Abraham 

Lincoln was trading to New Orleans his father, Thomas Lincoln, was on the move again.

shaken with a subliminal and quite unexpected gust of feeling, just as I've seen a June-time 

garden shaken by an unexpected gust of wind. It passed away, of course, about as quickly as it 

came--but with it went a scattering of the white petals of childhood unconcern.  I don't suppose my 

poor little Dinkie has yet awakened to the fact that his body is a worn river-bed down which must 

race the freshets of far-off racial instincts. But the thing disturbed me more than I'd be willing to 

admit. There are murky corridors in the house of life. They stand there, and they must be faced. 

There are rooms where the air must be kept stirring, corners into which the clear sanity of sunlight 

must be thrown. Dinkie, since he has stepped into his first experience in the keeping of rabbits, 

has been asking me a number of rather disconcerting questions. His father, I notice, has the habit 

of half-diffidently referring the boy to me, just as I nursed the earlier habit of referring him to his 

father. But some time soon Dinkie and I will have to have a serious talk about this thing called Life, 

this Life which is so much more uncompromisingly brutal than the child-mind can conceive....  By 

the way, there's a lot of nonsense talked about motherhood softening women. It may soften them 

in some ways, but there are many others in which it hardens them. It draws their power of love 

together into a fixed point, just as the lens of a burning-glass concentrates the vague warmth of 

the sun into one small and fiercely illuminated area. It is a form of selfishness, I suppose, but it is a 

selfishness nature imposes upon us. And it is sanctified by the end it serves. At every turn, now, I 

find that I am thinking of my children. I seem to have my eyes set steadily on something far, far 

ahead. I'm not quite certain just what this something is. It's a sort of secret between me and the 

Master of Life. But the memory of it makes my days more endurable. It allows me to face the 

future without a quaver of regret. I am a woman, and I am no longer young. But it gives me 

courage to laugh in the teeth of Time.  And to laugh, to laugh whatever happens--that is the great 

thing! It isn't age I dread. But I'd hate to lose that lightness with which those blessed ones we call 

the young can move through the world, that self-renewing freshness which converts every 

daybreak into a dewy new world and mints every sunrise into a brand new life ... I asked Gershom 

to-day if he could possibly tell me how many Parker House rolls a square mile of wheat running 

forty bushels to the acre would make. And he surprised me by inquiring how many quarts of 

buttermilk it would take to shingle a cow. Gershom is widening out a bit....  Dinkie, I notice, has just 

compiled a list of horses. I read from his carefully ruled half-page:  "Draght horses; carriege 

horses; riding horses; racing horses; ponyies; percheron from france; Belgain from Beljium; shire 

clyesdale and saffold punch from great Britain; french coach and German coach; contucky saddle 

horses; through-breads; Shetland ponies; mushstand ponies; pacers and pintoes." Thus recordeth 

my Toddler.     _Sunday the Ninth_   I have had Dinkie in bed for the last five days, with a bruised 

foot. Duncan shortened the stirrups and put the boy on Briquette, who had just proved a handful 

for even an old horse-wrangler like Cuba Sebeck. Briquette bucked and threw the boy. And Dinkie, 

in the mix-up, got a hoof-pound on the ankle. No bones were broken, luckily, but the foot was very 

sore and swollen for a few days. No word about the episode has passed between Duncan and me. 

But I'm glad, all things considered, that I was not a witness of the accident. The clouds are already 

quite heavy enough over Casa Grande.  Dinkie and his mater, however, have been drawn much 

closer together during the last few days. I've talked to him, and read to him, and without either of 

us being altogether conscious of it there has been an opening of a closed door or two. Dinkie 

loves to be read to. The new world of the imagination is just opening up to him. And I envy the 



rapture of the child in books, rapture not yet spoiled by the intellectual conceit of the grown-up. 

But I'm not the only reader about this ranch. I'm afraid the copy of Burns which Santa Claus 

brought to Whinstane Sandy last Christmas is not adding to his matrimonial tendencies as love-

plaints of that nature should. At noon, as soon as dinner is over, he sits on the back step, poring 

over his beloved Tammas. And at night, now that there again shifted from place to place, 

gathering no moss, till he died as thriftless and poor as he had lived. We have, in later years, an 

application from him to his son for money, to which the son responds in a tone which implies some 

doubt as to the strict accuracy of the ground on which the old gentleman's request was preferred. 

Their relations were evidently not very affectionate, though there is nothing unfilial in Abe's 

conduct. Abraham himself drifted to Salem on the Sangamon, in Illinois, twenty miles north-west of 

Springfield, where he became clerk in a new store, set up by Denton Offutt, with whom he had 

formed a connection in one of his trips to New Orleans. Salem was then a village of a dozen 

houses, and the little centre of a society very like that of Pigeon Creek and its neighbourhood, but 

more decidedly western. We are told that "here Mr. Lincoln became acquainted with a class of 

men the world never saw the like of before or since. They were large men,--large in body and 

large in mind; hard to whip and never to be fooled. They were a bold, daring and reckless set of 

men; they were men of their own mind,--believed what was demonstrable, were men of great 

common sense. With these men Mr. Lincoln was thrown; with them he lived and with them he 

moved and almost had his being. They were sceptics all--scoffers some. These scoffers were 

good men, and their scoffs were protests against theology,--loud protests against the follies of 

Christianity; they had never heard of theism and the new and better religious thoughts of this age. 

Hence, being natural sceptics and being bold, brave men they uttered their thoughts freely.... They 

were on all occasions, when opportunity offered, debating the various questions of Christianity 

among themselves; they took their stand on common sense and on their own souls; and though 

their arguments were rude and rough, no man could overthrow their homely logic. They riddled all 

divines, and not unfrequently made them sceptics,--disbelievers as bad as themselves. They were 

a jovial, healthful, generous, true and manly set of people." It is evident that W. Herndon, the 

speaker, is himself a disbeliever in Christianity, and addicted to the "newer and better thought of 

this age." He gives one specimen, which we have omitted for fear of shocking our readers, of the 

theological criticism of these redoubtable logicians of nature; and we are inclined to infer from it 

that the divines whom they "riddled" and converted to scepticism must have been children of 

nature as well as themselves. The passage, however, is a life-like, though idealized, portrait of the 

Western man; and the tendency to religious scepticism of the most daring kind is as truly ascribed 

to him as the rest.  It seems to be proved by conclusive evidence that Mr. Lincoln shared the 

sentiments of his companions, and that he was never a member of any Church, a believer in the 

divinity of Christ, or a Christian of any denomination. He is described as an avowed, an open 

freethinker, sometimes bordering on atheism, going extreme lengths against Christian doctrines, 

and "shocking" men whom it was probably not very easy to shock. He even wrote a little work on 

"Infidelity," attacking Christianity in general, and especially the belief that Jesus was the Son of 

God; but the manuscript was destroyed by a prescient friend, who knew that its publication would 

ruin the writer in the political market. There is reason to believe that Burns contributed to Lincoln's 

scepticism, but he drew it more directly from Volney, Paine, Hume and Gibbon. His fits of 



downright atheism appear to have been transient; his settled belief was theism with a morality 

which, though he was not aware of it, he had really derived from the Gospel. It is needless to say 

that the case had never been rationally presented to him, and that his decision against Christianity 

would prove nothing, even if his mind had been more powerful than it was. His theism was not 

strong enough to save him from deep depression under misfortune; and we heard, on what we 

thought at the time good authority, that after Chancellorsville, he actually meditated suicide. Like 

many sceptics, he was liable to superstition, especially to the superstition of self-consciousness, a 

conviction that he was the subject of a special decree made by some nameless and mysterious 

power. Even from a belief in apparitions he was not free. "It was just after my election, in 1860," he 

said to his Secretary, John Hay, "when the news had 


_
evenings are chillier, he retreats to the bunk-house stove, where he smokes and reads aloud. His 

own mother, he tells me, used to say many of those pieces to him when he was a wee laddie. He 

both outraged and angered poor Struthers, last Sunday, by reading _Tam O'Shanter_ aloud to 

her. That autumnal vestal proclaimed that it was anything but suitable literature for an old 

philanderer who still saw fit to live alone. It showed, she averred, a shocking lack of respect for 

women-folk and should be taken over by the police.  Struthers even begins to suspect that this 

much-thumbed volume of Burns lies at the root of Whinnie's accumulating misanthropy. She has 

asked me if I thought a volume of Mrs. Hemans would be of service in leading the deluded old 

misogynist back to the light. The matter has become a more urgent one since Cuba Sebeck all 

day, and there had been a great 'hurrah, boys!' so that I was well tired, I went home to rest, 

throwing myself upon a lounge in my chamber. Opposite to where I lay was a bureau with a 

swinging glass upon it; and, on looking in that glass, I saw myself reflected nearly at full length; but 

my face, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images, the tip of the nose of one being about 

three inches from the tip of the other. I was a little bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and 

looked in the glass; but the illusion vanished. On lying down again I saw it a second time--plainer, 

if possible, than before; and then I noticed that one of the faces was a little paler--say five shades--

than the other. I got up and the thing melted away; and I went off and in the excitement of the hour 

forgot all about it,--nearly, but not quite, for the 


_
attack and a consequent sea-change in his affections. But I'm afraid our Whinnie is too old a bird 

to be trapped by printer's ink. I notice, in fact, that Struthers is once more spending her evenings in 

knitting winter socks. And I have a shadow of a suspicion that they are for the obdurate one.  My 

Dinkie, by the way, has written his first poem, or, rather, his first two poems. The first one he 

slipped folded into my sewing-basket and I found it once in a while come up and give me a little 

pang, as though something uncomfortable had happened. When I went home I told my wife about 

it; and in a few days afterwards I tried the experiment again, when, sure enough, the thing came 

back again; but I never succeeded in bringing the ghost back after that, though I once tried very 

industriously, to show it to my wife, who was worried about it somewhat. She thought it was 'a 

sign' that I was to be

Augusta's red sweater. It reads:                 No more we smel the sweet clover,                Floting on 

the breeze all over.                But now we hear the wild geese calling;                And lissen, tis the 

grey owl yowling.  The second one, however, was a more ambitious effort. He worked over it, 

propped up in bed, for an hour or two. Then, having paleness of one of the faces was an omen 

that I should not see life through the last term." The apparition is, of course, easily explained by 

reference to a generally morbid temperament and a specially excited fancy. The impression which 

it made on the mind of a sceptic, noted for never believing in anything which was not actually 

submitted to his senses, is an
