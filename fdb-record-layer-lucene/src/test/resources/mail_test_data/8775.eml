XXII. _Facts illustrative of the Powers and Operations of the Human Mind in=
 a Diseased State._=20

1. Some years ago a farmer of fair character, who resided in an interior to=
wn in New England, sold=20

his farm, with an intention of purchasing another in a different town. His =
mind was naturally of a=20

melancholy cast. Shortly after the sale of his farm, he was induced to beli=
eve that he had sold it for=20

less than its value. This persuasion brought on dissatisfaction, and eventu=
ally a considerable=20

degree of melancholy. In this situation, one of his neighbours engaged him =
to enclose a lot of land,=20

with a post and rail fence, which he was to commence making the next day. A=
t the time appointed=20

he went into the field, and began with a beetle and wedges to split the tim=
ber, out of which the=20

posts and rails were to be prepared. On finishing his day's work, he put hi=
s beetle and wedges into=20

a hollow tree, and went home. Two of his sons had been at work through the =
day in a distant part=20

of the same field. On his return, he directed them to get up early the next=
 morning, to assist him in=20

making the fence. In the course of the evening he became delirious, and con=
tinued in this situation=20

several years; when his mental powers were suddenly restored. The first que=
stion which he asked=20

after the return of his reason, was, whether his sons had brought in the be=
etle and wedges. He=20

appeared to be wholly unconscious of the time that had elapsed from the com=
mencement of his=20

delirium. His sons, apprehensive that any explanations might induce a retur=
n of his disease,=20

simply replied that they had been unable to find them. He immediately arose=
 from his bed, went=20



into the field where he had been at work a number of years before, and foun=
d the wedges, and the=20

rings of the beetle, where he had left them, the beetle itself=20

2. Mrs. S., an intelligent=20

lady, belonging to a respectable family in the State of New-York, some year=
s ago undertook a=20

piece of fine needlework. She devoted her time to it almost constantly for =
a number of days.=20

Before she had completed it, she became suddenly delirious. In this state, =
without experiencing=20

any material abatement of her disease, she continued for about seven years;=
 when her reason=20

was suddenly restored. One of the first questions which she asked after her=
 reason returned,=20

related to her needlework. It is a remarkable fact, that during the long co=
ntinuance of her delirium=20

she said nothing, so far as was recollected, about her needlework, nor conc=
erning any such=20

subjects as usually occupied her attention when in health.  3. A lady in Ne=
