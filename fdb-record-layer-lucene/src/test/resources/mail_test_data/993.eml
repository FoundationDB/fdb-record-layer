dracaena marginata minds, tinged with traditions of Judaism, were seeking f=
or what they called 'the religion of Abraham.' These men were called _'Hane=
efs,'_ or skeptics, and their religion seems to have consisted chiefly in a=
 negative position, in denying the superstition of the Arabs, and in only a=

evidence of the old poetry with regard to the love of a father for his daug=
hters. Infanticide, which is=20

commonly attributed to the whole Arab nation of every age before Islam, was=
 in reality exceedingly=20

rare in the desert, and after almost dying out only revived about the time =
of Mohammad. It was=20

probably adopted by poor and weak clans, either from inability to support t=
heir children, or in order=20

to protect themselves from the stain of having their children dishonoured b=
y stronger tribes, and=20

the occasional practice of this barbarous and suicidal custom affords no gr=
ound for assuming an=20

unnatural hatred and contempt for girls among the ancient Arabs. These vers=
es of a father to his=20

daughter tell a different story:--     If no Umeymeh were there, no want wo=
uld trouble my soul,=20

no labour call me to toil for bread through pitchiest night;    What moves =
my longing to live is but=20

that well do I know      how low the fatherless lies, how hard the kindness=
 of kin.    I quake before=20

loss of wealth lest lacking fall upon her,      and leave her shieldless an=
d bare as flesh set forth on=20

a board.    My life she prays for, and I from mere love pray for her death-=
-      yea death, the=20

gentlest and kindest guest to visit a maid.    I fear an uncle's rebuke, a =
brother's harshness for her;=20

my chiefest end was to spare her heart the grief of a word.  Once more, the=
 following lines do not=20

breathe the spirit of infanticide:--     Fortune has brought me down (her w=
onted way)      from=20

station great and high to low estate;    Fortune has rent away my plenteous=
 store:      of all my=20

wealth, honour alone is left.    Fortune has turned my joy to tears: how of=
t      did Fortune make me=20

laugh with what she gave!    But for these girls, the Kata's downy brood,  =
    unkindly thrust from=20

door to door as hard,    Far would I roam and wide to seek my       With cl=
ouds are overcast.=20

we repent       Each folly, fault, and=20

all.      Our life is Lent:     Our=20

h on one of them,=20

mine eye says no to slumber all night long.  Hitherto we have been looking =
at but one side of Arab=20

life. The Bedawees were indeed the bulk of the race, and furnished the swor=
ds of the Muslim=20

conquests; but there was also a vigorous town-life in Arabia, and the citiz=
ens waxed rich with the=20

gains of their trafficking. For through Arabia ran the trade-route between =
East and West: it was the=20

Arab traders who carried the produce of the Yemen to the markets of Syria; =
and how ancient was=20

their commerce one may divine from the words of a poet of Judaea spoken mor=
e than a thousand=20

years before the coming of Mohammad.     Wedan and Javan from San'a paid fo=
r thy produce:=20

sword-blades, cassia, and calamus were in thy trafficking.    Dedan was thy=
 merchant in saddle-

cloths for riding;    Arabia and all the merchants of Kedar, they were the =
merchants      of thy hand:=20

in lambs and rams and goats, in these were they thy merchants.    The merch=
ants of Sheba and=20

Raamah, they were thy merchants,      with the chief of all spices, and wit=
h every precious stone,=20

and gold,           they paid for thy produce.    Haran, Aden, and Canneh, =
the merchants of Sheba,=20

Asshur and      Chilmad were thy merchants;    They were thy merchants in e=
xcellent wares,      in=20

cloth of blue and broidered work,      in chests of cloth of divers colours=
, bound with cords         and=20

made fast among thy merchandize.[10]  Mekka was the centre of this trading =
life, the typical Arab=20

city of old times--a stirring little town, with its caravans bringing the s=
ilks and woven stuffs of Syria=20

and the far-famed damask, and carrying away the sweet-smelling produce of A=
rabia, frankincense,=20

cinnamon, sandal-wood, aloe, and myrrh, and the dates and leather and metal=
s of the south, and=20

the goods that come to the Yemen from Africa and even India; its assemblies=
 of merchant-princes=20

in the Council Hall near the Kaabeh; and again its young poets running over=
 with love and=20

gallantry; its Greek and Persian slave-girls brightening the luxurious banq=
uet with their native=20

songs, when as yet there was no Arab school of music, and the monotonous bu=
t not unmelodious=20

chant of the camel-driver was the national song of Arabia; and its club, wh=
ere busy men spent=20

their idle hours in playing chess and draughts, or in gossiping with their =
acquaintance. It was a=20

little republic of commerce, too much infected with the luxuries and refine=
ments of the states it=20

traded with, yet retaining enough of the free Arab nature to redeem it from=
 the charge of=20

effeminacy.  Mekka was a great home of music and poetry, and this character=
istic lasted into=20

Muslim times. There is a story of a certain stonemason who had a wonderful =
gift of singing. When=20

he was at work the young men used to come and importune him, and bring him =
gifts of money and=20

food to induce him to sing. He would then make a stipulation that they shou=
ld first help him in his=20

work; and forthwith they would strip off their cloaks, and the stones would=
 gather round him=20

rapidly. Then he would mount a rock and begin to sing, whilst the whole hil=
l was coloured red and=20

yellow with the variegated garments of his audience. Singers were then held=
 in the highest=20

admiration, and the greatest chiefs used to pay their court to ladies of th=
e musical profession. One=20

of them used to give receptions, open to the whole city, in which she would=
 appear in great state,=20

surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting, each dressed magnificently, and wearin=
g 'an elegant artificial=20

chignon.' It was in this town-life that the worse qualities of the Arab cam=
e out; it was here that his=20

raging passion for dicing and his thirst for wine were most prominent. In t=
he desert there was little=20

opportunity for indulging in either luxury; but in a town which often welco=
med a caravan bringing=20

goods to the value of twenty thousand pound, such excesses were to be looke=
d for. Excited by the=20



song of the Greek slave-girl and the fumes of mellow wine, the Mekkan would=
 throw the dice till,=20

like the Germans of Tacitus, he had staked and lost his own liberty.  But M=
ekka was more than a=20

centre of trade and of song. It was the focus of the religion of the Arabs.=
 Thither the tribes went up=20

every year to kiss the black stone which had fallen from heaven in the prim=
eval days of Adam, and=20

to make the seven circuits of the Kaabeh naked,--for they would not approac=
h God in the=20

garments in which they had done their sins,--and to perform the other cerem=
onies of the=20

pilgrimage. The Kaabeh, a cubical building in the centre of Mekka, was the =
most sacred temple in=20

all Arabia, and it gave its sanctity to all the district around. It had bee=
n, saith tradition, first built by=20

Adam from a heavenly model, and then rebuilt from time to time by Seth and =
Abraham and=20

Ishmael, and less reverend persons, and it contained the sacred things of t=
he land. Here was the=20

black stone, here the great god of red agate, Hubal, and the three hundred =
and sixty idols, one for=20

each day of the year, which Mohammad      Hold fast the heavenly vision; th=
is hope thy soul=20

sustain--     All things shall work together for thy eternal gain;     The =
mystery of sorrow, the=20

mystery of pain,     Shall sure, some happy morrow, to every heart be plain=

_
day. Here was Abraham's stone and that other which marked the tomb of Ishma=
el, and hard by=20

Zemzem, the god-sent spring which gushed from the sand when the forefather =
of the Arabs was=20

perishing of thirst.  The religion of the ancient Arabs, little as we know =
of it, is especially=20

interesting, inasmuch as the Arabs longest retained the original Semitic ch=
aracter, and hence=20

probably the original Semitic religion: and so in the ancient religion of A=
rabia we see the religion=20

once professed by Chaldeans, Canaanites, Ph[oe]nicians. This ancient religi=
on 'rises little higher=20

than animistic polydaemonism. It is a collection of tribal religions standi=
ng side by side, only=20

loosely united, though there are traces of a once closer connection.' [11] =
The great objects of=20

worship were the sun and the stars and the three moon-goddesses--El-Lat the=
 bright moon,=20

Menah the dark, and El-'Uzza the union of the two; whilst a lower cultus of=
 trees, stones, and=20

mountains, supposed to be dwelt-in by souls, shows that the religion had no=
t yet quite risen above=20

simple fetishism. At the time of Mohammad the Arabs worshipped numerous ima=
ges, which may=20

have been merely a development from the previous stone-worship, or may have=
 been introduced=20

from intercourse with Christians. There are traces of a belief in a supreme=
 God behind this=20

pantheon, and the moon-goddesses and other divinities were regarded as daug=
hters of _the most=20

high God_ (Allah ta'ala)--a conception also possibly derived from Christian=
ity. The various deities=20

(but not the Supreme Allah) had their fanes, where human sacrifices, though=
 rare, were not=20

unknown; and their cultus was superintended by a hereditary line of seers, =
who were held in great=20

reverence, but never developed into a priestly caste.  Besides the tribal g=
ods, individual=20

households had their special Penates, to whom was due the first and the las=
t salam of the=20

returning or outgoing host. But in spite of all this superstitious apparatu=
s the Arabs were never a=20

religious people. In the old days, as now, they were reckless, skeptical, m=
aterialistic. They had=20

their gods and their divining-arrows, but they were ready to demolish both =
if the responses proved=20

contrary to their wishes. A great majority believed in no future life nor i=
n a reckoning-day of good=20

and evil. If a few tied camels to the graves of the dead that the corpse mi=
ght ride mounted to the=20

judgment-seat, it must have been the exception; and if there are some doubt=
ful traces of the=20

doctrine of metempsychosis, this again must have been the creed of the very=
 few.  Christianity and=20

Judaism had made but small impress upon the Arabs. There were Jewish tribes=
 in the north, and=20

there is evidence in the Kur-an and elsewhere that the traditions and rites=
 of Judaism were widely=20

known in Arabia. But the creed was too narrow and too exclusively national =
to commend itself to=20

the majority of the people. Christianity fared even worse. Whether or not S=
t. Paul went there, it is=20

at least certain that very little effect was produced by the preaching of C=
hristianity in Arabia. We=20

hear of Christians on the borders, and even two or three among the Mekkans,=
 and bishops and=20

churches are spoken of at Dhafar and Nejran. But the Christianity that the =
Arabs knew was, like=20

the Judaism of the northern tribes, a very imperfect reflection of the fait=
h it professed to set forth. It=20

had become a the copyright status of any work in any country outside the Un=
