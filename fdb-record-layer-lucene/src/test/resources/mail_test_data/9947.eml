"though she do seem worried, dear young lady."  When the shop-woman made this observation 

Hannah's pence tumbled down on the counter with a crash.  "Goodness gracious me, ma'am!" she 

exclaimed, "you don't mean to tell me that Miss Primrose Mainwaring is at Rosebury?"  "Why, of 

course, ma'am; why, don't you know? why you said but now how weak and ill she was."  "Never 

mind the paper," answered Hannah, "and never mind a word I said about anybody; just have the 

goodness to tell me where I'll find Miss Primrose."  "She was staying with Miss Martineau but 

yesterday and there's a gentleman come down, too--a very 'ansome, harristocratic-looking young 

man, I call him, and for all the world as like our pretty Miss Jasmine as if he was own brother to 

her--and they two and Miss Martineau are fairly scouring the place for that poor little tot Miss 

Daisy, who it seems 'as run away from home. Why, Hannah--Hannah Martin, woman! are you 

daft?"  For Hannah had rushed from the shop while Mrs. Jones was speaking, leaving her 

neglected paper and two or three pence behind her on the counter. A few moments later the good 

soul was knocking at Miss Martineau's door, and very soon Primrose and Arthur Noel too were in 

possession of all the facts that Hannah could give them.  "Oh, Hannah! it is so good to think you 

were the one to save her and find her," said Primrose, as she kissed her old nurse, and shed 

some thankful tears.  "You had better come back with me now, Miss Primrose," said Hannah, "and 

perhaps the gentleman or Miss Martineau will send a telegraphic message to poor Miss Jasmine." 

But Primrose's difficulties had not come to an end. She instantly started to walk across the fields 

with Hannah; but when Daisy heard she had come she absolutely refused to see her, and cried so 

piteously, and got into such an excited state, that Primrose felt herself obliged to yield to the child's 

caprice, and to keep out of the room.  "I can't see her, Hannah," poor little Daisy said. "Of all 

people in all the world, I can't see my own Primrose. Oh, if only I were well enough to go to Mrs. 

Ellsworthy, or if only the Prince would come!"  Primrose heard Daisy's weak little voice through the 

thin walls of Hannah's cottage.  "Hannah," she said, "I know who Daisy means by the Prince. The 

Prince is that kind Mr. Noel, who has been helping me to find the little darling. If he has not gone 

back to London, for he said he would go back at once after he knew we had found Daisy, he could 

come to her. Oh, Hannah," continued poor Primrose, "I cannot think what has happened to your 

dear baby, Daisy. I begin to believe what Mr. Noel has been hinting to me--that some one has got 

a secret influence over her."  "We had better see and find this Mr. Noel at once, miss, now," said 

practical Hannah. "We can think of secret influences and all that sort of thing when we have found 

the gentleman whom the dear child is pining to see. If Mr. Noel is still at Rosebury you had better 

put on your hat, Miss Primrose, and walk across the fields to the village, and bring him back with 

you. I'll stay with Miss Daisy and soothe her the best way I can. She's dreadful agitated and very 

weak and trembling ever since you came in, miss."  Primrose said she would go back to Rosebury 

directly, and she was so fortunate as to meet Noel as he was starting for London.  "You must 

come with me," she said earnestly. "I fear our dear little Daisy is even worse than Hannah 

represented her to be. She has absolutely refused to see me, and talks only about you and Mrs. 

Ellsworthy. I don't know what she can want with either of you, but it is quite evident that she thinks 

you can help her and save her from some great trouble. Poppy said she wanted Mrs. Ellsworthy to 

give her money; I suppose to replace what she lost of mine. Well, Mrs. Ellsworthy is not here; so 

can you come to see her to-night?"  "I will come at once, Miss Mainwaring," answered Noel. "If we 

walk down this street we shall pass the post-office, and I can send a telegram to Mrs. Ellsworthy 



and also to my servant, Lawson. I must try and get into town some time to-morrow, however, for I 

have got to attend the trial of no less a person than your old landlord, Dove. He was apprehended 

for stealing a bank-note and a ring from my mantle-piece."  "I never liked that man," said Primrose; 

"indeed, I never thought either of the Doves quite honest. Mrs. Dove made a rule of keeping back 

a little of the money she borrowed from me on all occasions."  Then Primrose and Noel walked as 

quickly as they could down the village street. Noel despatched his necessary telegram, and in a 

short time they both found themselves in Hannah's humble cottage.  "She is asleep," said Hannah, 

as she came out to meet them. "She is moaning in her sleep, and she gives sighs enough to break 

your heart. You had better, both of you, stay in my little sitting-room until she awakes."  "If you will 

allow me," said Noel, "I will go and sit beside her bed; she is accustomed to me. I will promise to 

be very careful in my dealings with her. I believe I can talk to her without startling her in the least." 

Hannah looked dubious, but Primrose interposed in her gentle voice--  "Yes, Hannah, Mr. Noel will 

not startle Daisy; he has always had a most happy influence over her."  Poor little Daisy! the sight 

of her wan face, the anxious expression which seemed indelibly stamped on her childish brow, 

gave Noel so strong a sense of pain and indignation that he sincerely longed to secure for Dove 

as severe a punishment as the law would give. He sat down gently by the humble little bed, and 

when the child moaned and tossed in her sleep he laid his cool hand on her forehead. That hand 

had a magnetic effect--even in her sleep Daisy seemed to know it. She murmured, "The Prince, 

has he come?" and a moment after she opened her dark blue eyes and fixed them on Noel, while 

a very faint smile flitted across her little face.  "You have come at last, Mr. Prince. I am very, very 

glad; I have wanted you," she said.  "I have wanted you, Daisy; I have been looking for you 

everywhere. I have been in great trouble about you," answered Noel, in his gentlest tones.  "Have 

you?" said little Daisy; "I am sorry you have been in trouble. Do you know that Primrose came to-

day and I could not see her? I can see you, but not Primrose. Please let me hold your hand. I don't 

feel so dreadfully weak when I hold your hand. Will you stoop down, and let me talk to you. I can't 

talk at all loud, for I'm dreadfully weak. Do you know, Mr. Prince, that I'm going to die?"  "No, 

Daisy, I don't think you are," answered Noel. I am the Prince who delivers little girls from ogres. I 

never heard of a little girl dying after she was delivered from the ogre."  "Wicked little girls are not 

delivered," answered Daisy. "I was so dreadfully cowardly. I was afraid of a dark dungeon, and so-

-and so--but I mustn't tell you. I did lose Primrose's money, and I was a coward, but I haven't been 

so bad yet as to tell a lie. You mustn't ask me to tell you what it all means, Mr. Prince, for I can't. I 

hope very much you'll forgive me for being a cowardly little girl; God has, long ago, for I asked 

Him, and I am not really afraid to die. I shouldn't feel a bit afraid or unhappy about it if I thought 

Primrose and Jasmine could have their money."  Here Daisy's voice quite failed her, and she 

looked so dreadfully white and weak that Noel began to fear there was some truth in her poor little 

words. He saw that their interview must not be prolonged, and that he must give the child relief as 

soon as possible.  "Daisy, you have got to listen to me," he said. "You need say very little yourself, 

but you can listen to my words. I know why you want to see Mrs. Ellsworthy--yes, dear, you can 

hold my hand as tightly as possible. No, don't tremble; you want Mrs. Ellsworthy to give you some 

money. She is not here; I know she would help you, and feel sorry for you, but there are others 

who do that. Daisy, suppose I give you back your money instead of Mrs. Ellsworthy? Give me your 

little hand, dear, and let me put the money into it. Here; it makes quite a small parcel--a ten-pound 



note, a five-pound note, two sovereigns and a half. Now, Daisy, shall we keep this as a little secret 

between ourselves? Primrose will ask no questions if you beg of her not, and when you have put 

that money into her hand will you not be able to have her with you again?"  Daisy's little hot hand 

closed tightly over the money. She did not speak, or even attempt to thank Noel, but her eyes, 

wider and wider open each moment, were fixed intently on his face.  "That is settled, then, Daisy," 

continued Noel, "and we need not think of Mrs. Ellsworthy just at present, for you do not now need 

her services. Of course a Prince is the right person to deliver a little girl from a dreadful ogre. I 

don't see that Mrs. Ellsworthy should have anything to do with it. Now, my dear, I'm going to say 

one or two other things to you--you need not feel the least frightened."  "May I really keep the 

money?" whispered Daisy at last.  "Of course, I said so. We will not say any more on this subject 

at present. I have given you the money to-night, because I want you to have Primrose sitting by 

your side and nursing you and comforting you. When Primrose is with you again you will cease to 

think those gloomy thoughts about dying. Now I have something else to add before I leave you." 

Noel had now taken a very firm hold of Daisy's little hand. She had been trembling a good deal, 

but she had certainly grown calmer. Perhaps the knowledge that she really did possess some 

money to give to Primrose was comforting her. Noel felt a sense of distress at disturbing even for 

her eventual good the child's present calm. It must be done, however, and he thought a moment 

how he could most gently deal with her.  "I'm going to tell you a story, Daisy," he said--"a very sad 

story, and, alas, a true one. There lives a little girl, I will not tell her name, although I know it, who 

has been unfortunate enough to get into the power of a very bad man. The man is very, very bad, 

but I will not mention his name here, although I know it also. The man came to the little girl and 

talked to her, and no doubt he threatened her, and at last he made her promise him something--

what, I cannot say. From the moment this little girl made this promise she became thin and white, 

and anxious and unhappy. She struggled against the terrible promise which seemed to bind her 

with fetters of iron, but she could never get away from it, and the man appeared like a terrible ogre 

to her, and she longed for a Prince to come and deliver her from him. The wicked man having 

terrified this poor little girl, did his best to use his influence over her to his own ends. At one time 

she lived in the house with him, but although she struggled against it her friends induced her to go 

elsewhere. Even in the new palace, however, she was not safe from the terrible ogre; he followed 

her, and, it is to be feared, although nothing is absolutely known, that he used cruel threats to 

induce her to give him some money which was not hers to give. The poor little weak girl was afraid 

to consult any one on account of her promise. It was quite natural she should think it right to keep 

her promise, although it was very sad. She was so completely under the power of the wicked man, 

or the ogre, as we will call him, that she gave him her sister's money--the money that was to 

support them all for some months, and then in her great despair she ran away." Here Noel 

paused--Daisy's eyes were fixed on him. Her face was white as death.  "You see, dear, it is a 

painful story," he said, "but it is not quite finished yet. The poor little girl ran away, but she never 

knew what was happening to the ogre. That wicked man was not allowed to continue his evil ways 

without punishment. At the present moment he is locked up safely in prison, where he can hurt no 

one. He was put there because he stole a five-pound note and a ring from the gentleman whom 

the little girl used to call the Prince. It is believed, though of course nothing is certainly known, nor 

will be until the little girl is taken out of the thraldom of the ogre and confesses what has 



happened, that this wicked man has also stolen a good deal of money from an envelope which the 

elder sister used to consider her 'Emergency Fund' envelope. In short, it is thought that his one 

object in frightening the poor little girl was simply to rob her and her sisters. Now that he is in 

prison, however, and quite out of the way of harming any one, it is greatly hoped by those who 

love her that the poor little one, who was made to suffer so cruelly, will be released from the 

thraldom of the wicked ogre, and be made to see that there are times and circumstances during 

which even the most truthful little girl would do better to break her word than to keep it. Now, 

Daisy, that is the end of my story; I've got nothing more to say about it, for at present I know 

nothing more. Good-night, dear--I will send Primrose to you. I will come to you when you want me 

again."     CHAPTER XLVI.  DELIVERED FROM THE OGRE.   "Here's the money, Primrose--

here's all the money," said little Daisy, in a weak, weak voice, when her sister came up to her 

bedside, and bent over her. "It was lost and the Prince brought it back; you won't ask me any 

questions about it, will you, Primrose?"  "No," exclaimed Primrose, in her very quiet and matter-of-

fact voice--the kind of voice which was most soothing to the excitable and nervous child at the 

present moment.  "I'm glad to have it back, Daisy, dear, for I have missed it; but of course, I shan't 

ask you any questions about it. I shall just put it into my purse, and you shall see what a nice fat 

purse I have got once more."  Then Primrose held her little sister's hand, and shook up her pillows, 

and tended her as only she knew how, but all that night Daisy grew more and more restless. The 

drowsy state in which she had hitherto been had changed to one of wakefulness. All through the 

long night the little creature's bright eyes remained open, and her anxious face had a question on 

it which yet she never spoke. At last, as the bright summer's morning broke, she turned to 

Primrose and said eagerly--  "Kneel down, Primrose, and ask God what a very ignorant, very 

unhappy little girl ought to do. Oh, Primrose, it's all about a promise--a promise that was most 

faithfully given. What shall I do about it?"  "Do you want to keep it, or to break it?" asked Primrose. 

"It seems to me I ought to keep it, Primrose, because a promise, faithfully given, ought always to 

be kept; but Mr. Noel says I ought to break this promise; oh, I don't know what to do!"  "Your heart 

won't be at rest, Daisy, and you won't really get better, until you do know what to do," answered 

Primrose. "Of course, I will kneel down and ask God to tell you."  Then the elder sister prayed 

aloud a very few earnest words, and the little one joined her in whispered sentences. The prayer 

was not long, but in Daisy's case it was quickly answered. When the morning quite broke, and the 

real working-day had begun, Primrose sent a message to Noel to come at once to see the child. 

Daisy received him with a touching little smile.  "Was the little girl me?" she asked. "And was the 

wicked, wicked ogre, Mr. Dove?"  "It is clever of you to guess that much, Daisy," answered Noel. 

"Am I the little girl?" continued Daisy, "who made a promise which she ought now to break? Will 

God forgive me for breaking a promise which I made so very, very faithfully? Mr. Noel, I will tell 

you something. That promise has nearly killed me. The old Daisy went away when that promise 

was made, and such a poor, cowardly, wretched Daisy came in her place. She'd have been 

selfish, too, but for you; but you taught her a little bit about the Palace Beautiful, and she was 

trying to be good in spite of the dreadful promise. Then the ogre came again, and the second time 

he was so dreadful that she even became very selfish to get rid of him. Oh, Mr. Noel, is it right for 

me--will God think it really right for me--to break that dreadful promise?"  "He will, Daisy. The 

promise ought never to have been made. Only an innocent and ignorant little child would have 



made it; yes, Daisy, dear, yours is one of the rare cases of a promise better broken than kept. 

See, I am the Prince, and I'm going to take the spell of the ogre from you. The wicked ogre is 

locked up in a dungeon instead of you, and the Prince commands the poor little captive to tell him 

everything."  Then Daisy, with some broken sobs, and with a piteous light in her blue eyes, told 

Noel the whole cruel story. He listened without once interrupting the little narrator. When she had 

finished, he kissed her, and told her that she now had nothing to fear, and then, bidding her sleep 

away all her troubles, he left her to Primrose's care. By the next train he himself went to London in 

full time to attend Dove's trial.  That worthy was at first inclined to brazen matters out, but when 

Noel, primed with Daisy's confession, appeared on the scene, his face underwent a remarkable 

change. Its rubicund tints quite deserted it, an alarming pallor spreading over every feature. 

Tommy Dove, who might have been seen in a foremost position amongst the crowd of spectators, 

was heard audibly to exclaim--  "Law, I guess there ain't no leg for my respected pa to stand on 

now!"  This, although not expressed aloud, seemed also to be Dove's opinion, for he then and 

there made a full confession of his wicked practices, and of the cruel threats he had employed to 

terrify Daisy. He received his sentence, which was a severe one, with much stoicism, and, as he 

was led away from his place in the prisoner's dock, addressed a parting word to his affectionate 

and hysterical spouse--  "Never mind, Mrs. Dove, my only love, even fourteen years comes to an 

end somehow, and when we meets again we'll make a rule for there being no attic lodgers."  "To 

the very end his was a poetic turn," his wife afterwards remarked to her favorite cronies. 

CHAPTER XLVII.  ALMOST DEFEATED.   With the weight of her secret removed Daisy began 

slowly, very slowly, to mend. The strain she had undergone had been too great for her quickly to 

recover her strength; but little by little a faint color did return to her white cheeks, she slept more 

peacefully, and began to eat again.  "There's nothing at all for you to do, Miss Primrose," said 

Hannah, "but to give up that post of continually screaming out book and newspaper stuff to a deaf 

old lady."  "She isn't deaf, Hannah," interrupted Primrose. "She wants me to read to her because 

her sight is very bad."  "Well, well," replied Hannah Martin, in a testy tone, "whether she's deaf or 

whether she's blind, it ain't no way a fit post for you, Miss Primrose. You've got to stay here now, 

and take care of that precious little lamb, and you had better send for Miss Jasmine to keep you 

company."  "I am certainly not going to leave Daisy at present," replied Primrose. "I've got money 

enough to go on with, but I must go back to town as soon as possible in order to earn enough to 

return Mr. Noel's money to him. As to Jasmine, do you know, Hannah, she has got quite a nice 

way of making a little income? You remember how cleverly she always arranged the flowers in our 

drawing-room at dear Rosebury, and how our mother always asked her to make bouquets for her? 

It now seems that Jasmine has got rather remarkable taste, and some fine ladies in London are 

employing her to arrange flowers on their dinner-tables. They pay her very well indeed for this, and 

the labor is nothing at all."  "Hoot!" said Hannah; "I think it's rather demeaning of herself. Well, 

Miss Primrose, I suppose the poor dear will want a holiday the same as the rest of you. To tell the 

truth, Miss Primrose, my old eyes ache to see the darling, she was always such a bonny one." 

Primrose smiled.  "When the fine ladies go out of town, Hannah, we will have Jasmine down, and 

you shall squeeze us all into that nice, cosy little bedroom of yours. What a good thing it was, 

Hannah; that you did not follow us to London, but that you started this nice shop in the country, for 

now we three girls can have our change in the country at such small expense."  Tears started to 



Hannah's eyes.  "I've been always saving up for this, Miss Primrose, and if you will talk of paying 

me at all, I'll never forgive you; aren't you my nurslings, all three of you, and the only creatures I 

have got to live for?"  In the meantime while things were mending for Primrose and Daisy, and 

Daisy was beginning once more to get that soft pink in her cheeks which gave her such a curious 

and touching likeness to her name-flower, poor little Jasmine, left behind in her Palace Beautiful, 

was not having quite so good a time.  Jasmine was beset by several worries and anxieties; she 

was also extremely lonely, for Miss Egerton, owing to the dangerous illness of a near relation, was 

still absent from home, and Poppy, driven by the dire necessity of earning bread to eat, had been 

obliged to return, as little maid-of-all-work, to Penelope Mansion.  Jasmine was alone, but she was 

a brave child, and her strong longing now was to help Primrose, and above all things not to ask for 

any money from her.  For the first few days after Primrose had gone to the country the poor little 

girl's resources were very meagre indeed. She had thought that first sovereign she had earned 

simply inexhaustible, but it was surprising how it melted in her inexperienced grasp, and how very, 

very little it seemed capable of purchasing.  In her first delight at finding herself capable of earning 

money she had written an extravagantly hopeful letter to Primrose.  "You need not think at all of 

me, dear Primrose," she wrote; "keep all the money you can collect to buy nice nourishing things 

for dear little Daisy. Perhaps I shall become quite famous as an arranger of flowers on great 

London dinner-tables. If I do get orders, and I think I am sure of them, I shall not only be able to 

pay my own London expenses, but will save something towards our emergency fund. Oh, 

Primrose, my heart burns with longings to earn lots of money, and to be great and strong and 

famous!"  This poor little enthusiastic letter reached Primrose when Daisy was at her worst, and it 

so happened that it lightened her cares about the little sister alone in London. She felt quite sure 

that Jasmine was getting plenty of orders, and was earning sufficient money for her own modest 

wants in the pretty way she spoke of; and in consequence she did not send her any of the money 

which Daisy had returned to her.  But poor little Jasmine was not receiving orders so fast as 

Primrose anticipated. One or two other ladies did ask her to dress their dinner-tables for them, and 

one or two more promised to do so, and then forgot all about it; but no one paid her as well as 

Mrs. Daintree had done. Noel was out of town, and was unable to interest himself in her behalf, 

and so it came to pass that the slender purse could not supply the modest needs, and Jasmine 

was much too proud, and too determined to help herself, to write to Primrose for money.  These 

were hard days for the little girl--days which were to prove the stuff she was made of to the very 

uttermost--but doubtless they gave her, as all anxious days of pain bravely borne do, a valuable 

experience and a depth of character which she could not otherwise have acquired.  The lesson 

she was to learn, however, was a painful one, and its sharpness was to be felt very quickly. 

Jasmine's hope of hopes lay in her beloved manuscript. That story, the first-fruits of her young 

genius, must surely make her purse bulky, and must wreathe her little brow with laurels. That 

story, too, was to refund poor Poppy the money she had lent, and was to enable Jasmine to live in 

comfort during her sister's absence.  One day, about ten days after Primrose had gone to 

Rosebury, Jasmine stood by the windows of the Palace Beautiful to watch the postman. He was 

coming up the street, and Jasmine greatly, greatly hoped he would stop at Miss Egerton's and 

drop into the letter-box, perhaps, a letter from Primrose, and more delightful still, a roll of proofs of 

her dear story. The postman, however, passed on his way, and gave his loud rat-tat at the doors 



to right and the doors to left, but neither sounded the bell nor gave his double-knock at Miss 

Egerton's door. Jasmine sighed deeply, and retiring from the window, sat down to her frugal 

breakfast. She looked pale, and her eyes were not as bright and starry as usual. Presently she 

took out her purse and looked at its contents. This was Thursday. She had dressed a dinner-table 

on Monday, and had received seven and sixpence. Her purse now contained three shillings, and 

she certainly could not accuse herself of any extravagance in the matter of diet.  "This will never 

do," she said to herself. "I believe if I do not get any more money I shall be obliged to apply to 

Primrose, and it was only last night I heard from dear old Rose saying how glad she was that I was 

able to support myself. She said Daisy's illness had cost a great deal, and we must all economize 

in every possible manner for some time. Dear darling old Primrose, I will not ask her to help me--I 

will manage for myself. Now how shall I do it? I am afraid those ladies did not care for the star 

arrangement of flowers which I made at that last house. I thought them lovely, peeping out through 

their dark green leaves, but I heard Mrs. Lee whispering to Mrs. Mansell, 'How peculiar! _do_ you 

quite like it?' and then Mrs. Mansell said nothing more about my dressing her dinner-table. Her 

dinner-party was to have been to-day, and she _almost_ promised to have me when I arrived in 

the morning. Well, there is no use thinking of that; I cannot swell my purse in that manner this day, 

that is very evident. Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do?"  Here a sudden thought came to 

Jasmine. Under its influence her cheeks flushed, and her eyes began to shine.  "Why, of course," 

she exclaimed; "how very silly of me to forget!--my hundred copies of _The Joy-bell_ ought to 

have arrived by now. Yes, of course they ought, and perhaps I shall be able to sell some of them. I 

have no doubt Mrs. Dredge would buy a couple if Poppy asked her and perhaps Mrs. Mortlock and 

Miss Slowcum would also like to see my first story in print. Yes, of course, I can sell a few copies. 

Bridget said she would buy one, and she said she had two cronies who would be sure to take a 

copy each. Yes, I expect I shall make a few shillings by the sale of _The Joy-bell_ to-day, and that 

will keep me going fine. Oh, dear! the very moment I have earned a little money by them I must 

send a copy down to Daisy. Won't the darling like to show my words of genius to Primrose? I'll run 

downstairs this minute, and ask Bridget if she has not got a parcel for me."  But alas! no _Joy-

bells_ had arrived for Jasmine, and after the little girl had wondered a great deal, and talked the 

matter over with Bridget she determined to put on her hat and go off to consult with Poppy.  She 

was not long finding her way to Penelope Mansion, and Poppy opened the door for her, but 

greeted her in a sad voice, and looked decidedly depressed.  "I have come about _The Joy-bell_" 

began Jasmine at once, in an excited voice. "It ought to have come--my hundred copies, you 

know, and they haven't. I must go to inquire about it at once; and, Poppy, dear, could you come 

with me?"  Poppy turned very red.  "No, Miss Jasmine, darling, I couldn't," she said, in the 

meekest voice.  Poppy's tones were so unlike those she usually employed that Jasmine glanced 

at her in some surprise.  "Why, Poppy, how funny you are!" she exclaimed. "Is anything the 

matter?"  "Don't you notice it, Miss Jasmine, but I'm a bit low-like," said Poppy. "I has my low fits 

and my high fits same as t'other folks, and this is a low fit day--that's all, miss."  "Oh! I am so sorry. 

Poor Poppy! And is the swimming in your head as bad as ever?"  "It's continual, Miss Jasmine. It 

seems to have become a kind of habit, same as the smuts and the Sarah Janes. A swimming 

head is most certain the London style of head for a girl like me. Yes, I am sorry I can't go with you, 

Miss Jasmine, darling, but I can't this morning. I hope you will get safe to the City, miss, and that 



you will see the editor, and give it to him sharp for not sending you your _Joy-bells_. Oh, my, Miss 

Jasmine! to think that your beautiful words is in print at last! Most likely the whole of London is 

flooded by them now, and the editor will be asking you for more of your words of beauty and 

wisdom. You make a sharp bargain with him, Miss Jasmine, and before you put pen to paper 

again for him, you get your money down. There's nothing so safe in clinching a bargain as money 

down. Oh, dear! I wish I could go with you. And, Miss Jasmine, if you could find it convenient to 

pay me back say one and sixpence of the little loan, I'll be for ever obliged, darling."  At this 

moment Mrs. Flint's voice was heard calling Poppy, and demanding who she was standing 

gossiping with. Mrs. Flint's voice sounded quite sharp, and Jasmine guessed that something 

unusual must have occurred to disturb her, for Mrs. Flint was known on principle never to excite 

herself.  "What is the matter with her?" she inquired of Poppy, who flushed up at her tones.  "Oh, 

nothing, miss. She's only a bit put out about the broken boots. There, I must run."  Poppy almost 

shut the door in Jasmine's face. She was certainly very unlike her usual self.  Jasmine walked 

down the steps of the Mansion, and slowly, very slowly, went up the street to meet the omnibus 

which was to convey her Citywards.  She was quite a clever little Londoner now, and knew which 

were the right omnibuses to take, and, in short, how to find her way about town. She hailed the 

City omnibus, and hastily and humbly took her place amongst its crowded passengers. She was 

the unlucky twelfth, and her advent was certainly not hailed with delight. The bright morning had 

turned to rain, and the passengers, most of them women, were wrapped up in waterproof cloaks. 

Jasmine, when she entered the omnibus, looked so small, so timid, and unimportant, that no one 

thought it worth while even to move for her, and at last she was thankful to get a little pin-point of 

room between two very buxom ladies, who both almost in the same breath desired her not to 

crowd them, and both also fiercely requested her to keep her wet dress from touching their 

waterproofs.  At another time Jasmine would have been quite spirited enough to resent the 

unfriendly behavior of the inmates of the City 'bus; but her interview with Poppy had depressed her 

greatly, and she had a kind of terrified little fear that she knew the reason of Mrs. Flint's sharp 

tones, that she could guess why Poppy's bright face should look so dismal, and why she was 

obliged so earnestly to beg of her to return her one and sixpence.  "She wants her own money--

her wages, that she earned with a swimming head and all," thought poor Jasmine. "How selfish of 

me not to remember before that of course, poor Poppy would want her wages; it is perfectly 

dreadful to think of her doing without them. Why, of course, Mrs. Flint would be likely to scold her if 

she went about with her ragged boots when she earns such good wages. Poor, dear, brave 

Poppy! she would never tell what she did with her money. Well, she must have it all back to-day. 

Yes, I am determined about that, she shall have it back, to-day."  Jasmine was thinking so hard, 

and so absorbing was her theme, that she leaned unconsciously against the fat neighbor on her 

right. This good person immediately pushed her with some vigor into the arms of the portly 

neighbor on her left, who exclaimed, in a cross voice--  "Lor' sakes! my dear, sit upright, do."  "I 

hope the young person will soon get out," exclaimed the other neighbor. "I call it downright 

unconscionable to crowd up Christian women like this. Might I make bold to inquire, miss, when 

you are thinking of alighting?"  "I am going to Paternoster Row," said Jasmine, in a meek voice. "I 

do not think I am very far from there now."  "Oh, no, miss! we have only to go down Newgate 

Street, and there you are. It's a queer place, is Paternoster Row, not that I knows much about it." 



"A mighty bookish place," took up the other neighbor "they say they are all bookworms that live 

there, and that they are as dry as bits of parchment. I shouldn't say that a bright little miss like you 

had any call to go near such a place."  Jasmine drew herself up, and her face became sunshiny 

once more.  "You would not think," she began, with an air of modest pride, "that I belong to the 

booky and the parchmenty people, but I do. I am going down the Row to inquire about one of my 

publications, perhaps I ought to say my first, so I am anxious about it."  "Lor', who would have 

thought it!" exclaimed both the ladies, but they instantly fell back and seemed to think it better to 

leave so alarmedly learned a little girl alone. For the remainder of the ride they talked across 

Jasmine about the price of onions, and where the cheapest bacon was to be purchased, and they 

both breathed a sigh of relief when she stepped out into the rain and they could once more expand 

themselves in the space which she had occupied.  Meanwhile the forlorn little adventurer walked 

down the narrow path of this celebrated Row. It was still raining heavily, and Jasmine's umbrella 

had several rents in its canopy. Now that she was so close to her destination she began to feel 

strangely nervous, and many fears hitherto unknown beset her. Suppose, after all, _The Joy-bell_ 

which contained the first portion of her story had not had a large success; suppose, after all, the 

public were not so delighted with her flowing words. Perhaps the editor would receive her very 

coldly, and would tell her what a loss her story had been, and how indisposed he felt to go on with 

it. If this was the case she never, never would have courage to ask him to give her Poppy's wages. 

If the editor scolded her she felt that she would be incapable of saying a word in her own defence. 

Nay, she thought it extremely probable that then and there she would burst into tears. 

Undoubtedly, she was in a very low frame of mind to-day. She, as well as Poppy, had her low fit 

on, and she greatly trembled for the result of the coming interview. Since that pathetic little last 

speech of Poppy's about her broken boots Jasmine had quite forgotten how sorely she needed 

money for herself. Her one and only desire just now was to restore Poppy's money.  "I must do it," 

she said to herself; "I must do it, and I will. I have made up my mind, and I really need not be so 

frightened. After all, Poppy and Daisy are both quite sure that I am a genius. Daisy says that I 

have got the face of a genius, and Poppy was in such great, great delight at my story. It is not 

likely that they would both be wrong, and Poppy is a person of great discernment. I must cheer up 

and believe what they told me. I daresay Poppy is right, and London is half-flooded with my story. 

Ah, here I am at the entrance of the court where the editor of _The Joy-bell_ lives. How funny it is 

to be here all alone. I really feel quite like a heroine. Now I am at the office--how queer, how very 

queer--I do not see any _Joy-bells_ pressed up against the window. No, not a single one; there 

are lots of other books and papers, but no _Joy-bells_. Dear, dear! my heart does beat, for I am 

thinking that perhaps Poppy is right, and that all the copies of _The Joy-bells_ are bought up; that, 

of course, is on account of my story." Then Jasmine entered the house, and went into a little office 

where a red-haired boy was sitting on a high stool before a dirty-looking desk. The boy had a 

facetious and rather unpleasant face, and was certainly not remarkable for good manners.  "I want 

to see the editor of _The Joy-bell_," asked Jasmine, in as firm a tone as she could command.  The 

red-haired boy raised his eyes from a huge ledger which he was pretending to occupy himself 

over, and said, "Can't see him," in a laconic tone, and dropped his eyes again.  "But why?" asked 

Jasmine, somewhat indignantly. "I have particular business with him; it is most necessary that I 

should see him. Pray, let him know that I am here."  "Very sorry," replied the boy, "but can't." 



"Why not?"  "'Cause he ain't in town."  "Oh!"  Poor Jasmine fell back a pace or two; then she 

resumed in a different tone--  "I am very much disappointed; there is a story of mine in _The Joy-

bell_, and I wanted to speak to him about it. It was very important, indeed," she added, in so sad a 

voice that the red-haired boy gazed at her in some astonishment.  "My word," he said, "then you 

do not know?"  "Don't know what?"  "Why, we has had a funeral here."  "A funeral--oh, dear! oh, 

dear! is the editor of _The Joy-bell_ dead?"  Here the red-haired boy burst into a peal of 

irrepressible laughter.  "Dead! he ain't dead, but _The Joy-bell_ is; we had her funeral last week." 

Poor Jasmine staggered against the wall, and her pretty face became ghastly white.  "Oh, boy," 

she said, "do tell me about it; how can _The Joy-bell_ be dead, and have a funeral? Oh, please, 

don't jest with me, for it's so important."  The genuine distress in her tones touched at last some 

vulnerable point in the facetious office-boy's breast.  "I'm real sorry for you, miss," he said, 

"particular as you seems so cut up; but what I tell you is true, and you had better know it. That 

editor has gone, and _The Joy-bell_ is decently interred. I was at her birth, and I was at her 

funeral. She had a short life, and was never up to much. I never guessed she'd hold out as long as 

she did; but the editor was a cute one, and for a time he bamboozled his authors, and managed to 

live on them. Yes, _The Joy-bell_ is in her quiet grave at last, and can't do no more harm to 

nobody. worse. Well, I'm not. My family history is nothing to brag about, but the record is clean. If 

you'll be seated I'll be glad to furnish you with such bits as may be of interest to you. It isn't so 

difficult to hold one's temper while sitting."  Elizabeth lifted an imploring face to the minister. 

"Please, dear, don't say anything more! For my sake, don't. Wait till you both have had time to 

think over how foolish this all is."  "Foolish, you think! He need not speak, so far as I'm concerned," 

declared Mr. Fox, refusing the proffered chair. "I know his whole miserable story. I knew his 

parents. I take back my request. You doubtless would not tell the truth. What I wish my daughter to 

know, I shall tell her in the privacy of our own home."  Elizabeth looked as if she could not trust her 

own ears for what she had just heard from her father's lips.  "Mr. Fox, Elizabeth shall know my 

story now, and from my own lips. I have absolutely nothing to hide or be ashamed of. My father 

and mother were honest people. If it be a crime to be poor, then, they were guilty beyond 

redemption. They came to this country from Australia when I was little more than an infant. My 

father took ill and died shortly after our arrival. Mother said his death was the result of confining 

work he had done in Australia. I can remember my mother quite well, but she died before I was 

five. I was taken into a neighboring family, almost as poor as mine had been. As I grew up I 

worked hard, and saved every penny. My mother had left me one heritage that was priceless, a 

craving for knowledge. The people who brought me up sacrificed to help me along till I reached 

high school. I worked my way up through four hard years, into college, and then on into the 

seminary.  "That is about all there is to my uninteresting history. I came here as a candidate for 

this church. For the first time in my whole life I was beginning to taste real happiness. But no 

sooner had I taken my first breath of independence than I saw I must fight to hold the ground I had 

gained. I gloried in the opportunity. I was glad that I could do for your town what no other minister 

had been able to do. I took special delight in getting hold of those lads and men at the Inn. Hicks 

and his crowd didn't trouble me one bit, or even alter one plan I had for the members of the club. I 

didn't even grow discouraged when the opposition came from you, for I kept hoping that you'd see 

your mistake and come over to my aid. But time went on, and you did not. I sought reasons for 



your injustice. I concluded at last that you had discovered my love for your daughter, and that you 

did not consider my family connections to be sufficiently strong to permit any such union. I did all 

in my power to argue myself out of that love. But I soon discovered that a man cannot argue a 

cyclone out of his heart any more than he can argue one out of God's sky.  "If there is no other 

reason for your actions, sir, than my love for Elizabeth your opposition may as well be withdrawn 

right here and now. Otherwise, I shall marry Elizabeth against your will."  "It seems to me, young 

man, that you are quite sure of yourself about something you can't do. I admire your nerve,"--the 

Elder was pulling out each word with violent tugs at the side-whiskers,--"but we'll see, sir, who 

holds the trumps."  "You mean that you offer me no other alternative than to fight this through to a 

finish?" asked the minister.  "I offer you no alternative whatsoever. I command you to remain away 

from my daughter."  "And I refuse to obey any such order unless you give some just and adequate 

reason."  "I shall give you reason enough. Why did you stop with that little bit of family history 

where you did?"  "I had nothing to add of any importance."  "You do not think it of importance to 

tell us what that confining work was your father did in Australia?"  "I haven't the slightest idea. If 

Mother ever told me I was so very young that I have forgotten."  "Perhaps your mother wished to 

spare you. If so, I do not intend to tell you at this late hour in your life. But what he did is sufficient 

reason for my forbidding you to carry your attentions any further."  "Father, this is getting really 

ridiculous," declared his daughter. "We love each other, and that fact is greater than all else. Not 

one word which you may say against Mack's people will make the slightest difference with me." 

"My dear child, if I dared tell you one-tenth of the truth,--but I dare not."  "You shall not talk like this 

any longer. It's silly."  "Since when has my child taken to giving her father orders? You are forcing 

me to speak. I'd rather cut off my right arm than do it, but I must save my little girl from----"  "I shall 

not listen to another word!" broke in the girl.  "Be still! I shall speak, and you shall listen."  "Father! 

You dare not. I love him, and----"  "You'll blush at the thought of having used that word in 

connection with that man before I have finished."  "It doesn't matter what you say, you can never 

change----"  "Beth, I must ask you to stop interrupting me. This man's father is an out----"  "You'd 

better not say that, Father!" cried Elizabeth. "You'll wish you hadn't when it is too late."  The 

Elder's face grew livid. His hands trembled violently as he steadied himself to deliver his final blow. 

Elizabeth drew close to Mr. McGowan as though to shield him, and shot a defiant glance at her 

father.  "I shall tell the truth, and you shall hear it. That man's father is an outlaw. He is a fugitive 

from justice. All this prattle about him being dead is a hoax."  The Elder now stood back to watch 

the result of his bomb. But what he saw was far more mystifying than satisfying. It was Mr. 

McGowan who drew back as the girl threw her arms about his neck. Elizabeth entreated him not to 

believe one word which her father had just uttered. Mr. Fox stood dumbfounded. Mr. McGowan did 

nothing but stare blankly across the room.  "Come here at once!" ordered the Elder. "Beth, do you 

hear me? Come away from that man. Don't you see he recognizes the truth? Are you entirely 

mad?"  For answer Elizabeth slipped her hands further over her lover's shoulders and locked her 

fingers behind. Mr. McGowan did not seem to realize the utter surrender with which she did this. 

He saw only the figure across the room and heard a faint whisper from out the past. It came from 

out his childhood, shortly after his father's death. It had made no definite impression on his young 

mind, but like a haunting shadow had stuck to him all these years. In a husky voice he demanded 

that the Elder explain.  "There is nothing more to explain, sir. You know to what I refer as well as I. 



If you are any kind of a man you will stop right where you are, and release my daughter from her 

foolish promise. Beth, if you love this man as you say you do you will come from him at once, for 

I'll ruin him if you persist in your sentimental infatuation. If you show a willingness to comply with 

my wishes, I shall let the matter drop, providing he leaves our town."  Mr. McGowan tried to push 

the girl from him, but she only tightened her grip.  "You dare not carry out your threat!" she shot at 

her father. Then without warning she released the minister, and turned about. The fire of 

indignation and anger leaped from those eyes that had only given her father love and kindness.  "I 

shall not threaten longer, I shall act. I shall apply for deportation papers for this man as an 

undesirable citizen."  "He is not that, Father!" cried the girl, making her last appeal.  "I shall have 

him deported if----"  She gave a dry hysterical laugh. "Try it, if you dare! I know his story. I know 

yours, too. Don't you touch me!" she cried, as her father started toward her. She fled again to the 

minister. "Don't let him touch me, Mack!"  Mr. Fox stopped abruptly. He dropped the papers which 

he had taken from his pocket. "Beth,--my dear,--have you lost all your senses? What were you 

saying?" he barely gasped.  The outer door opened, and Captain Pott entered his house. 

CHAPTER XVIII   Captain Pott paused on the threshold. He looked from one to the other of the 

occupants of the room. He crossed over and picked up the paper which the Elder had dropped. He 

slowly read the contents.  "Ain't breaking in on an experience meeting, be I?" he asked.  "Oh! 

Uncle Josiah! Tell Father it isn't true!" entreated the girl.  "I'd say 'twas purty likely, according to all 

the signs." He chuckled.  "Please don't laugh. I can't stand it. Tell Father about----"  "There now, 

Beth, you and the parson set sail for a little cruise down the beach. I've something private to say to 

your dad."  "What you have to say to me, sir, will be said in the presence of my daughter," replied 

the Elder, making a pathetic attempt at stiffness.  "You're mistook on that p'int, Jim. I'm skipper 

aboard here, and them's orders."  The Elder's hands shook uncontrollably as he gripped the head 

of his walking-stick.  "You're all wasting good time," observed the seaman. "You'd best heave to, 

and obey orders. Mutiny won't be allowed."  "I intend to remain right here till this mystery 

concerning me is cleared up," declared the minister.  "Mystery about you?" exclaimed the Captain. 

"Why, Mack, there ain't nothing like that about you. You're as clear as an open sky. What I've got 

to say is just 'twixt Jim and me. You couldn't get in on it to save your soul. Now, you and Beth 

clear out."  "Josiah Pott, I recognize no right that permits you to intrude into my family affairs. If 

what you have to say is concerning the mortgage you had better speak at once. There is nothing 

about that which is confidential."  "That's according to the way you look at it. I'd a heap sight rather 

say it in private, Jim. It may prove embarrassing----"  "Then, good night. Come, Beth."  "There ain't 

no use of you going off mad, Jim. I only wanted a word with you about something that does 

consarn us both a mite. You ain't got no objection to that, have you?"  The show of apparent 

humility on the part of the Captain made it possible for the Elder to remain, providing the 

conference should be made brief.  "You ain't no more anxious to get it over than I be. We'll step 

right in here in Mack's cabin, if you don't mind."  The Elder balked. "I prefer witnesses," he said. 

"Otherwise, you may come to my home to-morrow evening. I did not seek this unpleasant 

interview, and since I leave it to my lawyers to carry on my business affairs, I do not intend to 

hound my debtors personally."  "You ain't been hounding me personally, Jim, but there's some 

things that you can't leave even to crooked lawyers. You'd best handle this personally. If that 

shyster tries to get in on this his neck won't be wuth the skin that covers it."  "You still persist in 



trying to threaten me, I see."  "No, Jim, this ain't a threat. If you want the witness part after I get 

through I'll accommodate you with plenty of 'em. But I cal'late we'd best talk it over private-like fust. 

I happened onto a feller the other day by the name of John Peters, and he spun me the likeliest 

yarn I ever heard about Australia. I thought you'd like to hear it, but I don't want to take your 

valuable time. Good night."  "Hold on, Josiah! I did not catch that name. Who was it you saw?" 

But the Captain did not hold on to anything except to his news concerning John Peters. He 

entered the minister's study and closed the door.  A little later the side door opened and closed 

quietly. The seaman thought the Fox had run for his hole. But the study door soon opened. The 

Captain turned his back, drew out his pipe, and with slow deliberation began to pack the bowl with 

shavings from a black plug of tobacco.  "I think I can spare you a few minutes, Josiah," barely 

whispered the Elder. "I don't want to seem arrogant and high-handed in the matter of that small 

loan. And if there is anything----"  "That's all right, Jim, about that loan. Come right in, and set 

down. Thought you'd gone hum."  "That was the preacher going out with my daughter. He shall 

see the day when he'll pay for his impudence."  "Most of us get caught afore we're through life, 

Jim."  "I don't know why I'm doing this little service for you to-night, except it be for the sake of our 

boyhood friendship. I am willing to suffer this inconvenience----"  "It's mighty kind of you," cut in the 

Captain sharply. "But for once that boyhood rot ain't going to help you none. It ain't going to let you 

turn any more of them tricks of a black rascal simply because you pose as a shining martyr. The 

way you've treated Mack McGowan----"  "If this conversation is to be about the minister, I shall 

save you the trouble of speaking by going at once."  "It ain't no trouble for me to speak. What I've 

got to say does consarn Mack a heap, and you'd best listen. When I finish you'll see that it's best 

for him to stay right here in this church, if he wants to, after all the mean low-down tricks you've 

served him."  "I shall not allow you to pick a quarrel. I regret that you are so much inclined that 

way."  "You can keep all your regretting till later, you'll likely need it. What I want to make plain to 

you is that Mack is going to stay right here in Little River, perviding he wants to."  "Indeed? You 

surprise me. I usually get my way about church matters. Permit me to say that you shall not 

interfere in these affairs any more than in those of my own home."  "That's been the trouble with 

you all these years, Jim. You've been getting your own way too long. I'm not going to interfere one 

mite, I'm just going to dictate for this once. If I ain't way off in my soundings, you'll be mighty glad 

to have him as a son-in-law, too."  Mr. Fox rose and lifted his cane. He tapped the corner of the 

desk. He opened his mouth, but his anger choked him.  "You make me nervous, Jim. Set down 

and set still. I ain't going to speak of the parson right off. Ain't you going to set down? There, that's 

better."  The Elder's face was livid.  "I cal'late I'll talk better if I get this thing going," observed the 

seaman, lighting his pipe. "Now, Jim, I ain't sartin why I'm going to talk to you in private like this, 

but----"  "By God! It's time you're finding out! Your impudence has got beyond all bounds."  "I 

wouldn't swear like that. It ain't becoming to one of your position in the church. Them black scowls 

and blue cuss-words ain't going to get you nothing."  "You impudent dog! I thought you were 

intending to pay me that little debt, or I should never have entered this room. Your insults are----" 

"Sartin sure. 'Most forgot that." The Captain drew out a bank-draft and handed it over to the 

surprised Elder. "Thanks for reminding me. It's best to clear all decks afore manoeuvers are begun 

in earnest."  "I shall be going now. But I cannot take that draft. You will learn more about that 

later."  "Suit yourself on both p'ints, Jim," replied the seaman studying the tips of his heavy boots. 



"You'd best take this money, though. It pays off all I owe you. Anyway, I'd stay if I was you. You'd 

sure enjoy Peters' yarn."  The two men eyed each other like a pair of wild animals. The Elder at 

length rose.  "Pott, I'll not listen to more of your insane talk. I fear all your trouble has gone to your 

head. I'm sorry if that is the case. You would do well to consult some brain specialist."  "No, it ain't 

my head it's gone to. It's my heart." His words were gentle, but his eyes were as hard as flint. "I've 

been itching to get hold of you for some time, Jim, but I ain't seen any handle till now. Since you 

made me that offer up to your house t'other night I've been wanting to choke you. Yes, to choke 

you till your lying old pipe of a gullet would shut off your wind for good and all. But the law won't 

allow me that pleasure." He continued with intense bitterness: "I s'pose you're wondering where I 

got that money to pay off your filthy loan."  "So this is the gratitude you offer for my kindness?" 

"It's a fat lot you've ever done for me! You've just told me this ain't no good."  "The fact of the 

matter is, my lawyers probably foreclosed on the real mortgage at noon to-day."  "Then, that 

lawyer feller I see wa'n't far off his course, after all," replied the Captain, laying the draft on the 

table. "Now, Jim, show your hand and be damn quick afore I call your turn on the deal," demanded 

the seaman as though certain that a prior conclusion had proven correct.  "I have nothing to show 

at this time."  "By the Almighty, then, look out! I sold my _Jennie P._ to get you that money. It was 

purty hard to see her go, but it wa'n't all loss, not by a heap. John Peters bought her. I told him 

why I was selling her. He was real sorry, and then he spun me the yarn about your crookedness in 

Australia. I got the rest of the story by installments, about the way you treated Adoniah. John give 

me some mighty interesting news about an old Mrs. Rogers, who was the mother of Adoniah's 

wife. She's here right now looking for heirs and crooks."  The Elder had risen again, but the name 

spoken by the Captain struck him like a shot. He dropped back, his head fell forward, and his 

hands locked over the head of his stick.  "After that I seen Harold, and he told me where the 

woman was staying. I looked her up, and she told me the whole enduring yarn. It was Clemmie's 

last letter from Adoniah that set me going on your trail, and the old woman cleared up the fog. I 

had that letter in my pocket up to your place that night, but Providence or something kept me from 

showing it to you. That old lady had a picture of her darter Emmie, and it nearly knocked me over 

when she showed it to me. It was the same that Mack has here in this frame of his own mother. 

Take a look at that picture." He opened a drawer, lifted out a gilt-frame, and passed a small 

daguerreotype across to the Elder. "Mack has showed me this often, and I see that he was a chip 

off the old block on his mother's side. But I never dreamed the truth, because of his name." The 

Captain's eyes narrowed. "I've been wondering, Jim, if that wa'n't what went to your head that 

night he had dinner up there,--seeing the likeness, all of a sudden, to his mother."  He paused to 

give the Elder time to study the picture.  "Josiah, what on earth has all this nonsense to do with 

me? Just what are you accusing me of?"  "Nothing yet. I'm coming to that part. I looked up that 

feller who was with you over there, and I dragged your damned sin out of him. When it comes right 

down to it, I hate like time to take away your chart and compass this way, but you've been doing it 

to others for so long that I cal'late it's coming to you. I'd have let the old lady tear out your side-

whiskers if it hadn't been for them children of yours. It was for them that I asked you in here."  The 

Elder roused and made a pathetic effort to straighten his drooping figure. "I think,--er,--Josiah, I 

see your game at last. You purpose to frighten me with these wild tales from some old witch. I 

shall compel you to offer proof, for all your insinuations, in court."  "Insinuations! Proof! Lord, Jim!" 



cried the Captain, aiming a powerful finger in the direction of the Elder. "I've got proof enough to 

lock you up in the London Towers, or wherever it was you let Adoniah suffer for your infernal 

wickedness. Proof! Hell! You ain't that big a fool. Set still and hear me. You never see the shores 

of Africa. It was in Australia that you and Adoniah got in with that trader Rogers,--Emmie's father,--

and you was getting rich trading in opals. Then, the both of you fell in love with Emmie, and 

Adoniah beat you out and married her. It wa'n't long after that when Adoniah took down with a 

fever. God, man! When I think what you done to him when he couldn't fight back, I could kill you! 

You got trapped in a bad deal, and while Adoniah was raving with a fever you took all the money 

there was and skipped. You was careful to ship all the blame for your dirty work on Adoniah afore 

you sneaked out a rich man."  "Pott, that is enough. There is not a court in all this country that 

would believe your wild tale. Try it, and see how quickly they would lock you up in a madhouse." 

"They won't believe what I say?"  "I dare you to go into any court and try it. I'm too well known." 

"Jim, don't toss me that old line, it's a mite too green and slimy to look tasty."  "I'm through with this 

stuff and nonsense, sir!" shouted the Elder. He started for the door.  "Well, I ain't through with you. 

I'm only just begun." The Captain intercepted him. "You set there, or I'll set you. This trader, 

Rogers, got onto your little game afore you set sail, and tried to get you arrested. But you'd 

covered your dirty tracks. He caught you, though, and made you sign something----"  "That would 

not stand in court. I can prove that I was forced to sign a false statement at the point of a gun." 

"Thanks, Jim. I'm glad I ain't got to prove to you that you done the signing." Carefully choosing his 

words, the Captain continued. "That feller you had hiding with you that night done some signing, 

too. I got hold both them papers. I found that other feller and made him dance the devil's tune. He 

done some purty things for a missionary of the Son of God. His name was Means.  "You know the 

rest of the yarn, how Adoniah was taken off on one of them floating hells, called a convict-ship. 

The thing was nearly wrecked, and he was making his escape after swimming to land when he 

turned into a mission place for a bite to eat. He come face to face with that fat missionary who got 

you out of the country. Instead of feeding him, and giving him decent clothing, like a Christian 

ought to do, he took him to the officers. They put him in a dungeon. For nigh onto two years he 

was kept there. Then this Rogers feller got hold of a lawyer with as much heart as brains, and they 

got him out. The old lady said he wa'n't much to look at when he come out. They sent 'em over 

here, thinking it would be good for Adoniah's health. But he was all wore out, and couldn't hold a 

job. He was a heap too proud to beg or ask help. Not wanting to disgrace his family name with the 

damned record you give him, he changed his. The old lady said it was about then that they lost 

track of 'em. I got the rest of the story from Harold on my way home to-night from Edna's place. 

That's why I was late.  "Adoniah and his family lived in them dirty streets of lower East Side. He 

was a wreck, and Emmie tried to work to keep things up. Both of 'em died, starved to death, while 

you and that damn missionary was getting fat on the money you stole. You had busted up the firm 

so Rogers couldn't help none then, even if he'd found 'em. The little boy they left was found by 

some neighbors. He was 'most starved and nearly froze. He was living with an old janitor woman, 

and she was sending him out on the streets to sell papers! Think of that, Jim Fox! A little boy, five 

years old, peddling papers to pay your bills with! Them folks found him one morning in a doorway, 

asleep!"  The old seaman's voice choked. He slowly refilled his pipe. When he resumed his 

narrative, his breath was coming heavily. "This Rogers feller lost all track of 'em. He made money 



fast after he got on his feet, but all his searching got him nothing. The old lady said they kept 

paying some interest or other on a debt Adoniah owed to you in order to save some property of 

his. I didn't tumble just then what 'twas she meant. But I found out to-night. When the old man 

died, Mrs. Rogers shut down on that paying business and began in real earnest to look for her 

darter."  The Elder had slouched forward in his chair.  "You thought you was hid, and so you come 

back to this town to stick your head in one of its sand-heaps. I tell you, Jim, I ain't been very strong 

on the p'int of a Providence directing our ways. It's always seemed to me like a blind force pushing 

us from behind. But I'm getting converted. When that there missionary showed up at the installing 

meeting, the devil come right forward and asked for his pay. Means wa'n't long in seeing the 

mother's face in Mack.  "It was Mack who sold them papers. It was that low-down missionary of a 

Means who was working in a mission down on the East Side after coming back who put him in 

with that janitor woman. You both done all the dirt you could to his dad by stealing all he had, and 

now because you've been scared that he'd squeal on you, the both of you are trying to steal his 

right to live as a man. I suppose if you'd have known that he was as ignorant as a babe about all 

this, you'd done nothing against him. But Providence come in by way of your own home. Harold 

got that woman over here afore he knew where the scent was going, but he can't stop her now. 

Beth found it all out to-day, too."  The expected blast of hot denial and bitter denunciation did not 

follow. Instead, the Elder merely bent his head and acknowledged it all. He did not bewail his 

misfortune. He seemed beyond that.  "It's a mighty bad thing, Jim, when a feller lets the furniture 

of his house get more important than himself, ain't it? It leaves him kind of bare when it's all moved 

out."  "Josiah, you're right. It's even worse when the furniture has been stolen," remarked the man. 

He raised his head and looked at the little gilt-framed picture on the desk. He covered his face. 

With a dry sob he folded his arms across the picture, and dropped his head upon them. "My God! I 

didn't mean to do it when I began. I must have been insane. It seemed so easy at the time. I've 

suffered a thousand hells all these years!"  "I know. You just went along the way that seemed 

easy-like. At fust it ain't hard to go with the greedy crowd, but the turning's mighty hard. You sartin 

went the easiest way for yourself, Jim, but them you done wrong to, died in awful poverty."  "I can't 

stand any more!"  "John told me that Adoniah was going to get your hide after he got back here, 

but when he see you was married and had a little baby----"  "Stop it, Josiah! Do with me as you 

like, but don't tell me any more. I'll go insane!"  "I cal'late what you said about suffering your share 

is as nigh the truth as you've come in many a year. If I'd been intending to give you up to that old 

woman, do you cal'late I'd brought you in here?"  "Josiah, do you mean that you do not intend to 

give me up?" asked the crumpled man incredulously. He raised his head and peered across the 

room.  "Not if you're willing to obey orders. Others have been suffering, and that's got to stop."  "I'll 

do anything you say."  "The fust thing, that Sim Hicks and his gang has got to be choked off."  "I 

don't know what you refer to, but----"  "Jim, I thought we'd cut out that old green line of pretending. 

I ain't going to nibble, so just stop casting it at me. I mean his booze-selling to them boys."  "That 

can be arranged," hurriedly agreed the Elder.  "Thought it likely could. The second little matter is 

that Mr. McGowan is going to stay right here in this church as minister."  "I'll do my best----Yes, I 

shall see to that."  "Now, about that money you stole from his dad. That goes back to Mack with 

interest."  "But, Josiah, I can't do that. It would ruin me. I wouldn't mind for myself, but my family----

"  "I know, that's the hard part of paying off old debts, the innocent has got to suffer. But that can 



be fixed so it won't bother you much. It might do you good to take a taste of your own medicine." 

"Can this be done without the village finding it out?"  "It's purty hard to give up your position as 

village hero, ain't it, Jim? I cal'late it's going to be purty tolerable hard to dress a hypocrite up like a 

saint without people finding it out sooner or later, but we'll try it for a spell. Harold said to-night that 

he'd draw up papers for you. We're going to try to keep this a sort of family skeleton."  "How can I 

ever thank you!"  "You'd best give them thanks to the Almighty."  "I do, most heartily."  "Just touch 

a match to this paper you dropped. Here 'tis. I cal'late you wa'n't intending for no one to see this 

but Beth."  "That is true, Josiah. I wished to keep her from going any further with Mr. McGowan." 

With trembling fingers he set fire to that piece of paper.  "One word more about money. What are 

you going to do about the loan on this place?"  "You may keep that, Josiah, as a token of my 

appreciation for what you have done."  "Not this one," said the Captain. "That's honest enough to 

pass. I mean that one the interest has been paid on all these years."  "I'm afraid that my lawyers 

foreclosed on that at noon----"  "From what Harold said, I cal'late you'll find the interest was paid 

afore they had a chance to foreclose. If I was you, Jim, I'd just cancel that mortgage. The interest 

has more than paid it back these years. Mack's estate otter be clear."  The man before whom 

great ones had been made to tremble because of financial power, now meekly nodded assent to a 

sea captain.  "And we'll just include everything you owe Mack in the papers Harold is going to 

draw up?"  "I'll be only too glad to do as you say. But how about this Rogers woman?"  "I'll see to 

her. She'd never recognize you as the dude who beat her son-in-law. You've changed consider'ble 

since then. You've even changed a mite to-night."  The Captain took up his pipe from the table, 

shook off the ash, and relighted it.  "Is that all, Josiah?"  "Yes. I cal'late you'd best be going." He 

handed the Elder his hat, and lifted his walking-stick from the floor.  "Thanks, Josiah. You have 

been very kind to me. More than I deserve."  "There ain't no room for argument on that p'int."  As 

the Elder reached the door the Captain halted him.  "If I was you, Jim, I'd keep my oar out of that 

love affair of Mack and Beth."  "Quite right, Josiah. Good night."  The Elder got out of the house 

and into the road in a stumbling fashion. He climbed the knoll to his estate, a saddened and 

broken old man, but with a relief of mind and heart that he had not known for years.     CHAPTER 

XIX   "Now, ain't you a pair to look at, and you to give your sermon this morning, Mr. McGowan! 

You look a heap sight worse than Edna Splinter, and she's been raving with a fever all night." 

Miss Pipkin made this observation while the three of them sat at breakfast Sunday morning.  The 

minister absent-mindedly asked concerning the condition of Miss Splinter.  "She 'peared to be a 

trifle easier this morning. But what's ailing the both of you? Look as if you'd been setting up all 

night like two owls."  "Cal'late we're on our uppers, Clemmie. But we'll be fit as fiddles when we get 

some of them cakes stowed amidships, and ballast 'em down with a few swallers of that coffee. 

There ain't everybody that can b'ile coffee like you, Clemmie."  "Don't be foolish, Josiah."  After a 

very light breakfast, Mr. McGowan excused himself from the table, saying he must do some work 

on his sermon before the church hour. As the door to the study closed the Captain pushed back 

his plate and chair. He slid the latter round the end of the table, and placed it by Miss Pipkin.  "For 

the lan' sakes, Josiah! You ain't going to make love to me this morning, be you?"  "I ain't sartin, 

Clemmie. It depends on your partic'lar frame of mind," he replied slowly, a quiet kindness in his old 

eyes.  "I don't know as I feel like being made love-sick," she said, but without the old spirit of 

stubbornness.  "All right, Clemmie," he said resignedly. "I cal'late you know best. I'm going to spin 



you a yarn about what took place round these premises last night. That is, if you're willing to 

listen."  "Why, of course I'm willing to listen. Did that lawyer show up here again with his old 

mortgage?"  "No, you bet he didn't. And what's more, he won't come prowling round again, either." 

The Captain told his housekeeper the whole story. He passed as lightly as he could over the part 

where Adoniah had married the trader's daughter. Miss Pipkin gave no sign that she cared in the 

least, or that the news had shocked her. But when the Captain rehearsed the treachery of Mr. 

James Fox, she grew rigid. She dabbed her apron into the corners of her eyes as he unfolded the 

story of the suffering of the little family. The old man paused to wipe the tears from his own eyes 

as he recounted the finding of the lad in the doorway with a pile of morning papers in his lap. For 

some time after he had finished neither spoke. The Captain dangled his bandanna at the end of 

his nose, and Miss Pipkin dabbed her checked apron against her wet cheeks.  "Josiah," she 

whispered eagerly, "have you found the boy yet? Is he still alive?"  "Yes." A prolonged blow 

followed.  She laid her hand in his. "Where is he? Do you think I could see him?"  "He's in there." 

He pointed toward the study door.  "In that study with Mr. McGowan? Is that what you said?"  He 

nodded.  "You brought him here from the city yesterday?"  The seaman shook his head. "He come 

long afore that."  "Where've you been keeping him? Ain't you going to fetch him out?" she cried, 

rising. "I'll go get him."  "Wait, Clemmie. It's been nigh onto twenty-five year since he was born, so 

he ain't a baby. Let Mack fetch him. Mack!" called the Captain sharply. A slight twinkle in his eyes 

offset the assumed severity of his command.  The door opened and Mr. McGowan stood on the 

threshold. Miss Pipkin stared from the one to the other.  "Be the both of you clean crazy?" she 

demanded, as the men grinned rather foolishly at each other.  "No, Clemmie. We've just woke up 

to our senses, that's all."  "If you think this a good joke,----"  "It ain't no joke," said the Captain, 

motioning Mr. McGowan to come nearer. "I give you my word, it ain't, Clemmie. There's Adoniah 

Phillips' son."  With a smothered exclamation Miss Pipkin dropped back against the table. "You--

you----" But she ended with a gasp for breath and words.  "The Cap'n is telling you the truth," 

confirmed the minister.  "You--and you let me tell you all that nonsense about him and me!" 

"You're doing me an injustice, Miss Pipkin. I did not know one thing about all this till last night." 

Captain Pott had risen. In his eagerness he stretched out his arms to the confused housekeeper. 

She turned from staring at the minister, and like a bewildered animal fled blindly in the direction of 

the kitchen. She found herself, instead, in the seaman's arms. Here she stuck, and with hysterical 

sobs clung to the old man. Mr. McGowan came nearer. At sight of him she fled to his arms. For 

the next few minutes the practical, every-day Miss Pipkin did things of which no one had ever 

imagined her capable. The Captain's voice roused her.  "Here, young feller, you go loving where 

you're wanted. I've been waiting for this too many years to be cheated out by a young rascal like 

you." He seized the not unwilling Miss Pipkin, and pushed the minister in the direction of the 

kitchen.  "Clemmie, ain't this grand?" asked the old man.  "It's really been you all these years, 

Josiah."  "Been me? You mean you've loved me all the time, Clemmie?"  "Um-hm," she nodded 

vigorously. "But I was that stubborn that I wouldn't give in. I always looked forward to your 

proposing. You ain't proposed to me for a long time, Josiah."  "But, Clemmie, are you sartin sure 

it'll be all right now? If you get your rest, are you sartin you won't feel different? Don't you think 

you'd otter wait?"  "Josiah, ask me right now, so I can't back out, or get on another stubborn 

streak. I thought it all out 'longside Edna's bed last night. She was raving, and calling for some 



one, poor thing, who she'd refused to marry when she was young. I said then and there that I 

wasn't going to my grave with that kind of thing hanging over me. That is, if you ever asked me 

again."  "You say you made up your mind last night, Clemmie? You sure it wa'n't what I told you 

about Adoniah being married?"  "That had nothing to do with my decision."  "Then, you mean 

we're going to get married?"  "You ain't asked me yet."  "Miss Clemmie Pipkin," he began, bending 

his knees in the direction of the floor, and upsetting the table as he went down with a thud, "will 

you ship aboard this here old craft as fust mate with a rough old skipper like me?"  "Lan' sakes! 

Get up off that floor. You look awful silly. Get up this minute, or I'll say no."  The Captain got up 

with more alacrity than he had gone down.  "Will you marry me, honest, Clemmie?"  "Yes. You 

see, I kind of wanted to hear myself say it, because I'd made up my mind that way."  An 

exclamation from the kitchen interrupted what the seaman was doing. The minister had retired 

thither to clear the mist from his eyes which had gathered there at signs of spring-time in the fall of 

these dear old lives. He now stood in the door, holding a dripping coffee-pot.  "Oh, my coffee!" 

cried the housekeeper. "It's boiled all over the place."  "Drat the coffee. Let her b'ile!"  Boil it 

certainly had, over the stove, on to the floor, and had collected in a puddle at the threshold. 

"That's what comes of not attending to your cooking," observed the practical Miss Pipkin. The 

other Miss Pipkin, who had been sleeping for years in the living sepulcher of her heart, was saying 

and doing many things quite different.  From the cross-roads came the sound of the church-bell, 

calling the people of Little River Parish to worship.  "There's the bell!" exclaimed Miss Pipkin. "It's 

only a half-hour before service. If you'll excuse me, Mack, I don't think I'll go this morning. You 

don't mind if I call you Mack here at home, do you?"  "I want you to call me that, Aunt Clemmie." 

He gave her a hurried kiss, and started toward his room. At the corner of the upset table he 

paused. "If I didn't have to preach this morning I'd stay home, too."  "You mean you'd go walking 

down 'long the beach," corrected the Captain.  Miss Pipkin looked oddly at her lover. "Be they 

engaged?"  "They was, but I guess they ain't."  "What do you mean?"  "Jim came nigh sp'iling 

things last night. Mack said they'd call it all off till he found out more about his people. He was 

'feared from what Jim had said to him that he had no right to love Beth. I cal'late he see that it 


_
take on if I was you, you'd soon get accustomed to it if you had a desk at an office like this. In at 

the births, and in at the deaths am I, and I don't make no count of one or t'other. Why, now, there 

was _The Stranger_--which went in for pictorial get up, and was truly elegant--it only lasted six 

months; and there was _The Ocean Wave_, which did not even live as long. And there was 

_Merrie Lassie_--oh, their names is legion. We'll have another started in no time. So you must be 

going, miss? Well, good morning. If I was you, miss, I wouldn't send no more stories to this yere 

office."     CHAPTER XLVIII.  ONE SHOE OFF AND ONE SHOE ON.   "I must see you, Poppy--I 

must see you, and I can't come into the house. I could not face Mrs. Mortlock, nor Mrs. Dredge, 

nor Miss Slowcum. I am a dreadful failure, Poppy, a dreadful, dreadful failure, and I cannot look 

any one in the face. Do come out with me, dear Poppy, and at once; for if I can't speak to you at 

the present moment my heart will break."  "They're teaing just now," said Poppy, in a reflective 

tone; "they are all in the dining-room as snug as possible over their high tea. They have shrimps 

for tea, and a wonderful new kind of paste that Aunt Flint brought in to-day. It's called Gentlemen's 

Relish, and eats well on hot toast, and I made a lot. Oh, my! won't the ladies go in for it! Though 

Miss Slowcum always is so bitter against gentlemen, she will eat their relish, and no mistake. Well, 

Miss Jasmine they are all engaged over the pleasures of the social board, and what's to hinder 

you and me going down to the back scullery and having our talk there? You see, miss, if I went out 

with you I'd have to tidy up a bit first, and that would take time."  "You are quite sure they won't 

hear me, Poppy, if I walk across the hall. Miss Slowcum is dreadfully curious, and if she heard my 

step in the hall she would run out even though she was eating Gentlemen's Relish. I do not want 

any one to see me now that I am a failure."  "Step on this mat," said Poppy--"now on this; now 

make a spring here. There you are. Now we'll be down in my scullery long before Miss Slowcum 

can get to the dining-room door. Now, miss, let me put a seat for you. The scullery ain't so damp 

to-day, is it, Miss Jasmine?"  "I don't know," said Jasmine, who looked very tired, and almost ill. 

"Poppy, dear, I have not brought the one and sixpence."  "Oh, it don't matter," said Poppy. "One 

and sixpence never fretted me yet, and it ain't going to begin. You'll pay me when you can, Miss 

Jasmine, and there ain't no hurry."  But Jasmine noticed that Poppy moved her little feet out of 

sight, and in spite of her brave words Jasmine observed a look of dismay creeping into her bright 

eyes.  This slight action on Poppy's part--this little lurking gleam of disappointment--were as the 

proverbial last straw to poor Jasmine. Her fortitude gave way, and she burst into the bitterest tears 

she had ever shed.  Poppy was much alarmed, and stood over her dear little lady, and brought her 

cold water, and tried to comfort her by every means in her power.  When Jasmine had a little 

recovered herself she told the whole bitter story of her morning's adventure to Poppy. That young 

person's indignation knew no bounds.  "The editor must be put in prison," she said; "he must be 

caught and put in prison. Mrs. Jones the charwoman has a second cousin once removed, whose 

first cousin is married to a policeman, and Mrs. Jones is coming here to-morrow, and I'll get her to 

see her second cousin, and the second cousin shall see her first cousin who is married to a 

policeman, and he will tell us what is to be done. That's going to the fountainhead, ain't it, Miss 

Jasmine? Never you fear, miss, darling, that editor shall be locked up in prison, and be made to 

give back your money. Never you fear, dear Miss Jasmine, it will all come right when Mrs. Jones 

sees her second cousin who has a first cousin who is married to a policeman!"  Poppy became 

quite cheerful when she remembered Mrs. Jones's remarkable means of getting at a policeman, 



but Jasmine could not be comforted; she shook her head almost petulantly.  "It's all most puzzling 

for me," she said, "about Mrs. Jones and her policemen; it sounds exactly like the House that Jack 

Built, and I shall have a swimming head myself if I listen to you. No, Poppy, that policeman will 

never lock the wicked editor up in prison; he is a great deal too clever to allow himself to be locked 

up. Oh, dear! Poppy, what shall I do? All your money is gone, and my story is gone, and I know 

you are wanting boots as badly as possible. You are a dear, brave Poppy, but I know you have not 

a boot to your foot."  "Yes, Miss Jasmine, I has, I has one boot and one shoe; the shoe is an out-

door one, and heavy, and the boot is a light one. Worn together, they make one walk a little one-

sided, and the ladies, in particular Miss Slowcum, don't like it, but, lor', that don't matter nothing to 

speak of; they can't do nothing to me except tack on a few more names to Sarah. It don't fret me, 

Miss Jasmine, and it needn't fret you."  "All the same, I am going to get you your money, Poppy. I 

have absolutely made up my mind. I don't know how to do it, but do it I will. I had to come here to-

night to tell you what had really happened; but now I am going home. You won't have to wear that 

dreadful boot and shoe together much longer."  After this Jasmine managed to walk through the 

hall without being detected by Miss Slowcum; and very tired and weary, in process of time she 

found her way back to the Palace Beautiful. She drank a glass of milk which Bridget had laid ready 

for her, and ate two or three slices of bread and butter. Then she went into the little bedroom, with 

its three pretty white beds, and opening her own special trunk began to examine its contents. She 

was dreadfully frightened at what she was about to do, but all the same she was determined to do 

it. She would pawn or sell what little valuables she possessed to give Poppy back her wages. 

When the girls left Rosebury, Primrose made a very careful division of her mother's possessions. 

To Jasmine's share had come some really beautiful Spanish lace. Jasmine had not particularly 

admired it, but Primrose fancied that it would some day suit her speaking and vivacious face better 

than it would herself or Daisy. Jasmine had jammed the lace into a corner of her trunk, and but for 

the memory of dear mamma which it called up, would have made it a present to anybody. But one 

day it so happened that Miss Egerton caught sight of it; she exclaimed at its beauty, and said that 

it was really worth a considerable sum of money.  The lace consisted of a handsome shawl of 

black Spanish, and what was more beautiful, and also rarer, two very morning."  "Josiah, he'll 

marry us, won't he?"  "You just bet he will!"  "Ain't it funny he never said nothing about being glad 

we was engaged?"  "We ain't told him."  "But he saw."  "Script're says something about having 

eyes and seeing not, and having ears and hearing not. Mack's as nigh to obeying the sayings of 

Script're as any one I know."  "That's so, Josiah. He is so good without trying to be," declared Miss 

Pipkin. She lifted a hand to each of the old man's shoulders, and he put his arms about her. "Do 

you believe in the care of Providence, Josiah, and in the guiding hand of God?"  The Captain 

tightened his embrace, and one of the bony hands of the housekeeper slipped into the knotty 

fingers about her waist.  "I'm larning to, Clemmie, but I'm going to need a heap of help. I ain't used 

to these religious channels, and I cal'late you'll have to take the helm right often."  They had not 

heard the sound of footsteps in the outer room. It was Mrs. Beaver's voice that caused them to 

start.  "I thought I'd come over to borrow some----"  Mrs. Beaver stopped short on the threshold, 

looked at the Captain and the housekeeper, and began to retreat. The practical Miss Pipkin was 

the first to recover speech.  "Come on right in, Mrs. Beaver. That's a silly thing for me to say, 

seeing you're already in. But what is it you'd like to borrow?"  Mrs. Beaver continued to retreat and 



stare. She saw the puddle of coffee on the floor. She eyed with interest the upset table. She saw 

that the Captain was undetermined what he ought to do with his hands. She watched him as he 

stumbled backward into the cupboard. Her face was a study.  "What was it you was going to ask 

for, Eadie?" asked the seaman, trying to appear unconcerned in his decided embarrassment. 

"Well, I never!" exclaimed Mrs. Beaver.  "We're engaged," announced Miss Pipkin in matter-of-fact 

tones.  "Engaged! You and----"  "Yes, she and me," finished the Captain eagerly.  Mrs. Beaver's 

hands dropped helplessly to her sides.  "Is there anything more you'd like to know?" asked Miss 

Pipkin kindly, as she crossed the room and put an arm about the spare figure of her neighbor. 

"We're that happy that I wanted you to know, and I'm real glad you come over when you did." 

"Anything else I want to know?" she asked. "I should say there is. What has happened to Harry? 

He come home last night all different, talking for the minister till I couldn't get a word in edgewise. 

It was awful late, too. And he told me that Sim Hicks had left town, or was going this morning."  "I 

cal'late some one's clothed Harry in his right mind. You know, Eadie, that's Script're. Sim has took 

a trip for his health."  "And Harry tells me that Mr. Fox is for the minister, too. Something must 

have happened."  "Yes, something has happened. Eadie, you rec'lect that time when you fust 

spoke to me about the minister staying in my house you said I'd be in the way of the Lord if I'd do 

it. I wa'n't very pleasant to you for going ahead and doing it while I was away, but you sartin did 

what Providence wanted that time."  Mrs. Beaver did not attempt to reply.  "What was it you 

wanted to borrow?"  She looked from the one to the other, and made this comment: "I'm mighty 

glad for the both of you. You're good, and you both deserve what you've got." She kissed Miss 

Pipkin on the cheek, and turned toward the door.  "Eadie, what was it you come for?" asked the 

housekeeper in a strange voice.  "I come over for a pinch of salt, but----"  "Give her the hull sack, 

dear," ordered the Captain.  "I guess--I think----I really don't need the salt," stammered Mrs. 

Beaver.  "Here, Eadie, don't go off mad. I didn't mean anything by what I said. I'd give half what I 

own this morning to a hobo if he'd ask for a crust of bread."  "Thanks, Josiah. But I guess I got 

what I really come for. God bless you both!"  With that she was gone.  "Now, ain't that the 

strangest you ever see?" observed the Captain.  He was cut short by the sound of a familiar toot 

out in the harbor. He stared at the housekeeper in dumb amazement.  "Clemmie, did you hear 

that? What in tarnation was it?"  "It sounded like your power-boat."  "But it ain't round here." 

Together they went outside. Together they stood on the stoop and watched a boat nose its way to 

the old mooring of the _Jennie P._  "It's her!" whispered the seaman hoarsely. "It's my _Jennie 

P._!"  He did not move from his place beside Miss Pipkin, but held tightly to her hand as John 

Peters came up from the wharf.  "Here's a paper for you, Josiah. A girl come into my place about 

noon yesterday and made me sign it."  Captain Pott was too surprised to even reach out for the 

piece of paper offered him.  Miss Pipkin took it, and unfolded it carefully.  "Read it for me, 

Clemmie."  "It only says that the _Jennie P._ was bought back by Josiah Pott."  "But I never----" 

"That girl said she'd come to represent you, and paid cash."  Without a word the three went down 

to the wharf, and John Peters rowed the dory, with two passengers aboard, out to the _Jennie P._ 

*       *       *       *       *  It was late in the afternoon when Mr. McGowan left the house. Fall 

permeated the air with an invigorating twang. Here and there the landscape showed the touch of 

frost. The marsh grass was turning brown. Among the trees and shrubbery color ran riot. The Fox 

knoll was a blend of beauty. As the minister passed the estate he sought for a glimpse of the 



Elder's daughter among the trees, or in the garden. But she was not to be seen.  For a long way 

he kept his course up the beach. He was thinking. How could he explain to Elizabeth the meaning 

of his actions last night? Would she listen after he had refused to give heed to her explanation? 

Suddenly, he became aware that he stood on the spot where he had turned his ankle the night 

she had come to him from the water's edge, and his thoughts were choked in the furrows of his 

brain. He seemed to hear her voice again as she had spoken that night of the impossibility of his 

love. He looked about. Far up the peninsula he recognized her. She was coming to him as straight 

as the line of the beach permitted. He started in her direction. She waved him back. He waited. On 

she came. Neither attempted to speak till she had reached his side.  "I've been waiting for you," 

she said. "I thought you would never come."  "You still want to see me after the way I treated you 

last night?"  "Please, don't speak of that. I knew Uncle Josiah would tell you everything."  "He did 

tell me all. I want you to forgive me for not taking your word that there was nothing in my past 

which would prevent our love, or mar it. I didn't realize that you knew what you were saying. I 

feared that I had no right to love you after your father had 


_
Miss Egerton was quite right when she spoke of the lace as valuable, but her ideas of value and 

Jasmine's were widely different. Jasmine would have thought herself well repaid if any one had 

given her Poppy's wages for the old lace; she would indeed have opened her eyes had she known 

at what sum Miss Egerton valued it. In addition to the lace Jasmine had a little thin gold ring which 

Mrs. Mainwaring had worn as a guard to her wedding-ring. Jasmine much preferred the ring to the 

lace, but she slipped it on her finger, intending to part with it also, if the lace did not fetch enough 

money. She knew that Primrose would be deeply hurt at the lace being sold, for she had over and 

over said that come what might, they would not part with their few little home mementoes; but 

Jasmine was past caring even for what Primrose said to-night. With her lace wrapped up in an 

untidy parcel she slipped downstairs. Bridget came into parentage."  With intense anticipation he 

held out his hands, but she drew away.  "Not now. I did not understand what Father's obligation to 

you would involve."  "Elizabeth, dear, do you mean you won't forgive me?"  "I have nothing to 

forgive in you, Mack." In her eyes was a return of the warmth of love she felt, but her attitude was 

one of firm resolve. "I have come to you to-day because I want to tell you that just for the present 

we must be only good friends. I've been thinking all night long about you, and now that you know 

who you are, and what my father has done against your father----"  "But that is all past!"  "Not for 

me. Father ruined your father, and has grown rich on your money. Not till every cent of that is paid 

back can I think of marrying you." There was the weight of dead finality in every word.  "But, 

Elizabeth----"  "Please, Mack, don't make it harder for me than you must. This is not easy, but 


_
"Look here, missie, is it not a little late for you to be going out?"  "Oh, not at all, Biddy, dear. I am 

going a little way. I won't be long."  Then Jasmine went up to the old servant and spoke in her 

most coaxing and fascinating tones.  "Biddy, what did you say was the sign of a pawnshop?"  "A 

pawnshop, Miss Jasmine? Why, bless us and save us, miss, what have you got to say to such 

places?"  "Oh, nothing in particular, Bridget, only I thought I would like to know. I am always trying 

to get information on every kind of subject. Is the pawnshop the sign of the three balls, Biddy?" 

"Yes, yes, miss--what a curious young lady! There, run out and take your walk quick, and come 

back as soon as possible, for though it's close on Midsummer Day we'll have the night on us 

before you return if you are not quick."  Jasmine left the house, nodding brightly to Bridget as she 

did so, and the old servant returned to her interrupted work.  "She's a bright bonnie girl," she said 

to herself, "and hasn't she got a winsome way? I hope she drank up her milk, for she is looking a 

bit pale, and I hope she won't stay out late, for it may turn damp when the dew begins to fall." 

Bridget was busy over her work, and was thinking of Jasmine after all in only a very lazy and 

comfortable fashion when a cab drew up to the door, and Miss Egerton most unexpectedly 

returned. She was not in the house a moment before she asked for Jasmine.  "She's just gone out, 

ma'am," answered Bridget. "She had a parcel in her hand, and she said she was going out for a 

run. No, ma'am, I don't say she's looking at all particularly well. She's very white and worried 

looking, and she is scarcely ever in the house. She says she must improve her mind, and that is 

why she is out, and she do ask the funniest questions. Just now it was to know what was the sign 

of a pawnshop."  "The sign of a pawnshop?" echoed Miss Egerton; "and did you tell her, Bridget?" 

"Why, of course, ma'am. She said she wanted to know for the improving of her mind. She had a 

little parcel in her hand, and she said she would be back again in no time. Shall I get you a cup of 

tea, ma'am?"  "No, thank you, Bridget. I cannot eat until I find out about Miss Jasmine. I do not like 

her asking you those questions, Bridget, and I do not like her taking a little parcel with her. The 

child may be in want or trouble. I must see to it at once. Bridget, have you any idea which is the 

nearest pawnshop to this?"  "Oh, ma'am, there's Spiller's round the corner, and there's Davidson's 

in the main road. Now, Miss Egerton, I am most certain Miss Jasmine wanted to hear about the 

pawnshop for the sake of improving her mind, and for that reason only. I wish you would stay, 

ma'am, and have your cup of tea, for you look real tired."  But Miss Egerton was gone. 

CHAPTER XLIX.  SPANISH LACE.   She walked quickly down the street, hoping every moment to 

overtake Jasmine. Miss Egerton had old-fashioned ideas about many things, and nothing could 

exceed her horror at the thought of this pretty and refined-looking child finding her way alone to a 

pawnshop.  "Poor little girl!" she said to herself. "She must be really in absolute want. What has 

she taken to pawn? Oh, dear! this anxiety is terrible--and yet, and yet, how glad I am to know 

those orphan girls."  Miss Egerton was very tired, had just returned from the death-bed of her 

dearest friend, had certainly heaps of worries of her own; but that did not prevent her whole heart 

from going out to Jasmine with an affection which was almost motherly.  When at last she found 

the little girl just coming out of Spiller's pawnshop she laid a trembling hand on her arm.  "Jasmine, 

oh, my dear child, you have been in there! You have been pawning something."  Jasmine was in 

such a depressed state of mind that even Miss Egerton's unexpected return failed to astonish her. 

She said, raising two sad eyes to the good lady's face--  "It was only that old Spanish lace. I 

always knew it was not worth much. The man only laughed when I asked for Poppy's wages for it. 



He has given me ten shillings, and I am going off with it to Poppy to-night. Yes, Miss Egerton, I 

must, I really must."  "What have you tried to pawn, Jasmine?" asked Miss Egerton, when she 

could find her voice. "Surely not that lovely, valuable Spanish lace. My dear child, come back with 

me into the shop this moment."  "But I must keep my ten shillings," exclaimed Jasmine "Oh! Miss 

Egerton, don't, don't! You don't know what has happened to me!"  Miss Egerton took Jasmine's 

little hand in hers.  "My poor child, you shall tell me all. Jasmine, dear, that lace is worth pounds. I 

shall redeem it at once, for my sake, if not for yours. There, poor little girl, keep your ten shillings, if 

it makes you happy."  The man who had lent Jasmine half a sovereign on the Spanish lace of 

course knew little or nothing of its true value, and the good lady had therefore small difficulty in 

getting it back. She walked home holding Jasmine's hot little hand, took her into her own pretty 

drawing-room, feasted her on many good things, which she had brought from the country, and 

finally made her tell her all her sorrowful little story.  "You always said that my writing was not up to 

much," said Jasmine, in conclusion. "I did not like you to say it, and I was most anxious to prove 

you wrong, but now I know that you are right."  Miss Egerton looked quietly at the excited child. 

"My dear," she said, in her gentle tones, "I do not know--no one knows--whether in the future you 

will be able to write. Our writers ought to be our teachers. Do you think you are fit to teach, 

Jasmine?"  "I do not know," said think it over."  "You have not talked this over with your father, or 

with Harold?"  "No. Father was ill last night, and Harold was so tired that he has been sleeping all 

day. It would make no difference what either of them might say. I am doing this because it is right." 

"You do not know of the arrangements that are to be made?"  "All I know is that Father owes you 

the money, and that it is yours and must be paid back to you."  "Elizabeth, there are papers to be 

drawn up, and----"  "Mack, please don't! I'm tired, and can't stand much. Don't try to change my 

decision."  "But those papers which Harold is to draw up must alter that decision. That is the only 

ground on which I shall accept the terms. Your father is to be given all the time he needs to pay 

me back. At first I flatly refused. I didn't want to take any of his money. But Uncle Josiah made me 

see that it was the only thing to do."  "Of course, it is the only thing to do. You are going to let 

Harold draft those papers because Father must give up what does not belong to him."  "I'll not 

permit one stroke of the pen unless----"  "But, Mack, you must! This is your duty to make Father----

"  "Elizabeth, dear, it is not your father's money I want. All that means nothing to me. I am 

consenting to the arrangement simply because I believe it will be best for him to pay it back. It's 

you I want!"  She turned from him to look out over Long Island Sound. The sun was completing its 

daily journey by tossing up glorious hues of gold, splashing the western sky without stint from its 

unseen pot of blending colors. Her face seemed to catch and hold the glory of the sky.  "Beth, we 

must not sacrifice the love which God has given us. That is something which all the money in the 

world cannot buy."  She turned about to face him. Her eyes were filled with the reflection of the fire 

that glowed on the inner shrine of her heart.  "You are right, Mack. Our love is God's gift."   THE

Miss Egerton got up, and laid her hand tenderly on the pretty little curly head.  "This day has 

taught you a grand though painful lesson, dearest. You will be better able to write in the future for 

and because of the suffering you have gone through to-day. Now, Jasmine, I will say no more--you 

must go straight to bed and to sleep. In the morning you can take your ten shillings to Poppy. Yes, 

dear, of course it is yours, and for the present the Spanish lace is mine."  Jasmine, 

notwithstanding all her troubles, slept soundly that night, but Miss Egerton lay awake.  "The time 

has come," she said to herself, "when energetic measures must be taken. The girls--dear, brave, 

sweet girls--have undoubtedly to a certain extent failed. Poor little Jasmine! she might have had a 

worse experience than the loss of that silly manuscript. But what terrible dangers sweet little Daisy 

ran! Yes, I shall go and have a talk with Mrs. Ellsworthy to-morrow--I know she is in town." 

Accordingly, when Jasmine went off to see Poppy holding her half-sovereign firmly inside her 

glove, and dimly wondering if she would have any money of her own left to buy some dinner with 

presently, Miss Egerton stepped into an omnibus which presently put her down in the vicinity of 

Park Lane. She was fortunate in finding Mrs. Ellsworthy at home, and also disengaged.  The good 

little lady received her with delight, for Miss Egerton was a prime favorite with her.  "Arthur tells me
