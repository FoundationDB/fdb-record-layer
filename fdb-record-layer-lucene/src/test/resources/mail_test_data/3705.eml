Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends 

upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission 

of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in 

machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. 

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status 

with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and 

charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not 

uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 

with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received 

written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance 

for any particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate  While we cannot and do 

not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know 

of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach 

us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any 

statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. 

laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current 

donation methods and addresses.   Presently she said--  'I have a little album that I wish you 

would write something in before you go away altogether.'  'Oh yes, I will do that,' said he, 'and 

gladly.'  'But I mean something of your own,' she said rather more timidly.  'Why, but who told you-- 

'Oh, every one knows, surely!' said she.  'And why should you conceal it?  There were the verses 

that you wrote about Mrs. Semple's little girl--I saw them when I was at Tongue last--and indeed I 

think they are quite beautiful: will you write out a copy of them in my album?'  'Or something else, 

perhaps,' said he--for instantly it flashed upon him that it was something better than a mere copy 

that was needed for Meenie's book.  Here, indeed, was a chance.  If there was any inspiration to 

be gained from these wild hills and straths and lonely lakes, now was the time for them to be 

propitious; would not Clebrig--the giant Clebrig--whose very child Meenie was--come to his aid, 

that so he might present to her some fragment of song or rhyme not unworthy to be added to her 



little treasury?  'I will send for the book to-morrow,' said he.  'I hope it will not give you too much 

trouble,' said she, as they reached the small gate, 'but it is very pleasant to turn over the leaves 

and see the actual writing of your friends, and think of when you last saw them and where they are 

now.  And that seems to be the way with most of our friends; I suppose it is because we have 

moved about so; but there is scarcely any one left--and if it was not for a letter occasionally, or a 

dip into that album, I should think we were almost alone in the world.  Well, good-night, Ronald--or 

will you come in and have a chat with my father?'  'I am afraid it is rather late,' he said.  'Well, 

good-night.'  'Good-night, Miss Douglas,' said he, and then he walked slowly back to his home. 

And indeed he was in no mood to turn to the scientific volumes that had already arrived from 

Glasgow.  His heart was all afire because of the renewal of Meenie's kindness; and the sound of 

her voice was still in his ears; and quite naturally he took out that blotting-pad full of songs and 

fragments of songs, to glance over them here and there, and see if amongst them there was any 

one likely to recall to him when he was far away from Inver-Mudal the subtle mystery and charm of 

her manner and look.  And then he began to think what a stranger coming to Inver-Mudal would 

see in Meenie?  Perhaps only the obvious things--the pretty oval of the cheek and chin, the 

beautiful proud mouth, the wide-apart contemplative eyes?  And perhaps these would be sufficient 

to attract?  He began to laugh with scorn at this stranger--who could only see these obvious 

things--who knew nothing about Meenie, and the sweetness of her ways, her shrewd common-

sense and the frank courage and honour of her mind.  And what if she were to turn coquette under 

the influence of this alien admiration?  Or perhaps become sharply proud? Well, he set to work--

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project 

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For 

thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network 

of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed 

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is 

included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper 

edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

_Who will buy pansies?_   _There are her eyes,_ _Dew-soft and tender,_   _Love in them lies._ 

_Who will buy roses?_   _There are her lips,_ _And there is the nectar_   _That Cupidon sips._ 

_Who will buy lilies?_   _There are her cheeks,_ _And there the shy blushing_   _That maidhood 

bespeaks._  _'Meenie, Love Meenie,_   _What must one pay?'_ _'Good stranger, the market's_ 

_Not open to-day!'_   He looked at the verses again and again; and the longer he looked at them 

the less he liked them--he scarcely knew why.  Perhaps they were a little too literary?  They 

seemed to lack naturalness and simplicity; at all events, they were not true to Meenie; why should 

Meenie figure as a flippant coquette?  And so he threw them away and turned to his books--not 

the scientific ones--to hunt out something that was like Meenie.  He came near it in Tannahill, but 

was not quite satisfied.  A verse or two

Carry Hodson returned from Paris in a very radiant mood; she had had what she called a real 

good time, and everything connected with the wedding had gone off most successfully.  Her dress, 

that she had ordered long before she came to the Highlands, was a perfect fit; Lily Selden made 

the most charming and beautiful of brides; and no less a person than a prince (rather swarthy, and 

hailing from some mysterious region east of the Carpathians) had proposed the health of the 

bridesmaids, and had made especial mention of the young ladies who had travelled long distances 

to be present on the auspicious occasion.  However, on the morning after her return to Inver-

Mudal her equanimity was somewhat dashed.  When she went along the passage to the little hall--

to see what the morning was like outside--she found waiting there a respectable-looking elderly 

Highlander, with grizzled locks, who touched his cap to her, and who had her waterproof over his 

arm. This last circumstance made her suspicious; instantly she went back to her father.

father said, with some sharpness. 'I think you have taken up enough of his time.  And just now,

the old Highlander in about a couple of minutes; and presently they were on their way down to the

favourable to the sport.  It was very beautiful, no doubt; for sometimes for hours together the lake 

would be like a sheet of glass--the yellow shores and purple birch-woods all accurately doubled,

soft and deep blue; and when a breath of wind, from some unexpected

[Illustration: DARTMOOR]   Dartmoor is a fine-sounding name, and no one would wish to displace 

it; yet in one sense it is a misleading and inappropriate designation of the great central Devonshire 

moorland. The moorland is not distinctively the moor of the Dart, any more than of the Teign, the 

Tavy, or the Ockment; it is the cradle-land of rivers, and there is no obvious reason why the silver
