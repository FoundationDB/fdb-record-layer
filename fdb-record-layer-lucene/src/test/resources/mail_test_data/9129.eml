h, and pretending an=20

ardent desire for its union, while they wickedly withdraw themselves from i=

their defence appealing from us, which, however, they have not the right to=

it has only become so from=20

improper treatment, this should be a mitigating circumstance in favor of th=

speaking, we can seldom make the sharp distinction which Lord Hale did lega=
