during his lifetime waive the privilege, the waiver to take effect after hi=
s death.[288] The express=20

waiver required by the statute may be given by the patient=E2=80=99s attorn=
ey, because of the nature of the=20

attorney=E2=80=99s agency in conducting an action for the patient.[289]  No=

provide that the testimony shall not be given unless the _patient_ consent;=

; and in Nebraska, of the=20

_party_ in whose favor the provision is enacted.  In Indiana, the privilege=
 extends beyond the=20

death of the patient, and it may be waived by the party who may be said to =

the deceased and whose interests may be affected by the disclosure.[290]  I=
