to one another of establishing here a Christian commonwealth. It is also true of the leaders of the 

Revolution, throughout the country, that they were remarkable alike for their public and private 

virtues, and owed their elevation, in most cases, to this circumstance, and I may add, their power 

and consequence afterwards. The war broke out, and a time of difficulty and sacrifice began; the 

pecuniary resources of the nation were drained to the last drop, continual levies of men to recruit 

the army operated all over the country with the effect of a military conscription, and meanwhile the 

enthusiasm which marked the opening scenes of the struggle, was rapidly subsiding. In this state 

of things, if there had been the slightest pretext for believing that the leading men were false to 

their pledges, had but the shadow of a suspicion passed across the singleness and purity moment 

of need, but for herself also--to feel herself impotent, helpless, powerless as a child.  Millefleurs 

came forward from the window hurriedly. Perhaps being so much a man of his time it was he who 

understood that gasp of suffering best. He said, "Lady Edith, if I can help----" quickly, on the 

impulse of the moment; then, thorough little gentleman as he was, checked himself. "Lady 

Lindores, though I am a stranger, yet my name is good enough. Tell me what to do and I will do it. 

Perhaps it is better that Lord Lindores should not commit himself. But I am free, don't you know," 

he said, with something of the easy little chirrup of more ordinary times. Why was it that, at such a 

moment, Edith, of all others, in her personal despair, should burst out into that strange little laugh? 

She grasped her mother's arm with both hands in her excitement. Here was a tragic

the new and ill constituted government would not have lived for an hour. We often speak of the 

virtue and intelligence of the people, as the great security of our liberties; and in quiet times, and 

under a well established government, they are perhaps a great and sufficient security. But in the 

shock of a sharp arrow which pricked the girl to the very heart.  This sympathiser immediately 

changed the face of affairs. Lord Lindores, indeed, continued to hold himself apart, pushing back 

his chair once more; but even to Lord Lindores, Millefleurs made a difference. He said no more 

about enthusiasm or

restraints and natural landmarks of authority are broken up; and the mind is pained at the bare 

contemplation of the possible consequences, if at this crisis in our country's destiny the supreme 

command had devolved on a Cromwell, instead of a Washington.  It is difficult to do justice to that 

assemblage of qualities in the character of this great man, which makes his name almost equally 

dear to the lovers of liberty in both occasional word of direction. They clustered together like a 

band of shadows against the great window, which was full of the paleness of the night. Beaufort, 

who was the person most acquainted with all the circumstances, recovered his sense of personal 

importance as he told his story. But after all, it was not as the narrator of John Erskine's story that 

he cared to gain importance in the eyes of Carry's family, any more than it
