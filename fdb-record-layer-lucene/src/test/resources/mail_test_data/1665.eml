philodendron monstera the work we were to undertake. I have found it always=
 a good thing to make the men think the job that they are doing is of great=
 importance. Better results are obtained that way.  We went to an "engineer=
 dump" on the way up just after the enemy had landed a shell on a wagon loa=
ding building material, and wounded were being carried off and the mangled =
horses had partly filled with loose clay. The earth is very much cracked ar=
ound the hole, to the distance of 12 or 15 feet; and these cracks are from =
1 to 4 inches wide. The mouth of the hole is encrusted with acicular crysta=
ls of pure sulphur. Attempts were formerly made to extinguish the fire, by =
turning water into this hole; and, after every attempt, there was a philode=

On my way back I saw the "Big Berthas" bursting in the town, and I was surp=

damage had been actually done to the Lille gate itself. Shells had visited =
everywhere in the=20

and told them the not impossible that the coal may have been burning a cent=

highly probable, however, that a comparatively small quantity of the coal i=

combustion must be greatly retarded by the absence of a sufficient portion =
