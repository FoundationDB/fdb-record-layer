rdination and=20

dissipated character.  [46-A] The writer of this memoir has, on the coast o=
f New Holland, between=20

Cape Capricorn and Endeavour Straits, had occasion to know this about like =
a semaphore,=20

indicative of impatience, contempt mingled with pity and warning.  Luckily =
for us, the belt of scrub=20

was not of great extent; Lizzie had already reached its edge, and was peeri=
ng cautiously through,=20

and we were struggling=20


_
fact. A party of these savages attacked the captain and supercargo of a ves=
sel in which he was an=20

officer, and they were repulsed only by firearms. The account of them given=
 by the supercargo,=20

and indeed by all the party attacked, uniformly agreed in describing them a=
s the finest made and=20

strongest looking men possible. Their bodies were also very hairy.  [46-B] =
The term "Haraforas" is=20

applied to the Subanos of Mindanao by Captain Forrest; from his Voyage, pp.=
 266, 268, 271, 273,=20

278-282, we obtain the following interesting and first-hand information abo=
ut that people:  "The=20

vassals of the Sultan, and of others, who possess great estates, are called=
 Kanakan. Those=20

vassals are sometimes Mahometans, though mostly Haraforas ["who are also ca=
lled Subanos, or=20

Oran Manubo," p. 186]. The latter only may be sold with the lands, but cann=
ot be sold off the=20

lands. The Haraforas are more opprest carbine, the bullet of which we disti=
nctly heard whistle over=20

our heads, and turning round we got a glimpse of Jack, the roughrider, hung=
 up in a vine, one of=20

whose tendrils had fired off his weapon; and had just time to hear him excl=
aim, "If I'd only been=20

mounted, this wouldn't have happened," before we broke cover, and all furth=
er concealment being=20

now unnecessary, rushed recklessly on to the encampment.  But we were too l=
ate to capture any=20

of the men, for I need hardly tell the reader that never had we intended to=
 make use of the curt=20

arguments that Lizzie had relied upon for cutting off the abrupt exit of he=
r quondam friends; it=20

would be quite time enough to commence a system of reprisals when it was as=
certained that the=20

blacks had actually been guilty of any atrocity.  At present it was mere su=

Mahometan vassals are bound to accompany their lords, on any sudden expedit=

Haraforas being in a great measure excused from such attendance, pay yearly=
 certain taxes,=20

which are not expected from the Mahometan vassals. They pay a boiss, or lan=
d tax. A Harafora=20

family pays ten battels of as it infallibly would, a bad feeling against an=
y other luckless mariners=20

whom the winds and the waves might in time to come cast upon the inhospitab=
