dracaena marginata  This both astonished and angered the bear, but seeing h=
ow large and formidable the stranger was, and how fearlessly he came on, Bl=

astonished and angered the bear, but seeing how large and formidable the st=
ranger was, and how fearlessly he came on, Black Bruin sneaked away through=
 front room of the first floor, and there came forward to meet him a man ra=
ther below the middle height, but of a symmetrical and imposing mien. His f=
ace was grave, _
massive set of horns, came up out of the water and Black Bruin saw that the=
 strange creature had=20

his mouth full of lily-bulbs and water-grasses.  Soon the huge head disappe=
ared again, and after a=20

few seconds reappeared, bringing up more lily-pads.  For half an hour Black=
 Bruin watched the=20

stranger through a number of obscure streets, but quiet, decent, and monoto=
nous, he stopped at a=20

small house in a row of many residences, yet all of them, in, form, size, c=
olor, and general=20

character, so identical, that the number on the door could alone assure the=
 visitor that he was not=20

in error when he=20


_
reappearing.  Then the great beast swam ashore, shook himself and went cras=
hing off through the=20

woods, his hoofs keeping time in a rhythmic clack, a-clack, clack.  When he=
 had disappeared=20

Black Bruin advanced to the spot where he had come ashore and smelled his t=
rack.  It was not like=20

anything that he had ever smelled before, and somehow the scent made him an=
gry.  This lordly=20

monster was invading his preserves.  No one but him had a right to hunt or =
fish, or to eat roots in=20

this region.  So Black Bruin followed the trail of the moose, half curious =
and half angry.  He had not=20

gone a quarter of a mile when he came up with the bull, who was rubbing his=
 antlers upon the=20

branches of a low tree.  Black Bruin watched him for several moments, until=
 a puff of wind carried=20

the telltale scent to the moose, who is most wary and watchful.  The moose =
threw up his head,=20

gave a loud snort and blew his breath through his nose with a whistling sou=
nd, then crashed off=20

through the forest.  This fact led Black Bruin to surmise that he was afrai=
d of him, and nearly=20

resulted in his undoing.  The following day, he discovered  =E2=80=9CAh! is=
 it you, Captain Bruges?=E2=80=9D said the=20

smiling and blushing maiden who answered to his summons. =E2=80=9CWe have n=
ot seen you for a long=20

time.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, you look as kind and as pretty as ever, Jenn=
y,=E2=80=9D said the captain, =E2=80=9Cand how is my=20

friend?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said the damsel, and she shrugged=
 her shoulders, =E2=80=9Che mopes. I=E2=80=99m very glad you=20

have come back, captain, for he sees very few now, and is always writing. I=
 cannot bear that=20

writing; if he would only go and take a good walk, I am sure he would be be=
tter.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is=20

something in that,=E2=80=9D said Captain Bruges. =E2=80=9CAnd is he at home=
, and will he see me?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh! he is=20

always at home to you, captain; but I will just run up and tell him you are=
 here. You know it is long=20

since we have seen you, captain=E2=80=94coming on half a year, I think.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTime flies, Jenny. Go, my good=20

girl, and I will wait below.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIn the parlor, if you pleas=
e, Captain Bruges. It is to let now. It is more=20

than a mouth since the doctor left us. That was a loss, for, as long as the=
 doctor was here, he=20

always had some one to speak with.=E2=80=9D  So Captain Bruges entered the =
little dining-room with its=20

mahogany table,=20


_
upon a small tree that was bent down under his foreleg.  There were two oth=
er tall, gaunt=20

creatures, also feeding near, and two small animals of the same kind.  Thes=
e were two cow-

moose and their calves. Altogether it was quite an imposing family party.  =
Black Bruin watched=20

them curiously for a time, until finally the bull scented him, and came cha=
rging through the portrait=20

of Garibaldi, which had been left as a legacy to the landlady by her late l=
odger, Dr. Tresorio.  The=20

captain threw a quick glance at the print, and then, falling into reverie, =
with his hands crossed=20

behind him, paced the little chamber, and was soon lost in thoughts which m=
ade him unconscious=20

how long had elapsed when the maiden summoned him.  Following her,=20
