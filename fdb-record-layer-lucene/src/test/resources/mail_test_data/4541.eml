There, my child.  [_He hands a copy of "The Times" to SALOME with his finge=

paragraph._  SALOME.  [_Reading._] "A Munificent Offer. Dr. Jedd, the Dean =

[_Reading._] "On condition that seven other donors come forward, each with =

Repression Guild," reminds me that to-morrow is the first day of the Races-=
-the St. Marvells=20

Spring Meeting, as it is called.  BLORE.  Hindeed, sir--fancy that! And I n=
ot know it!  THE DEAN.=20

All our servants may not resemble you, Blore. Pray remind them in the kitch=

E DEAN.  Your=20

Aunt is coming to live with us.  SHEBA.  To what?  SALOME.  To live with us=
! What Aunt?  THE=20

DEAN.  My dear widowed sister, Georgiana Tidman.  SALOME.  What's she like?=
  SHEBA.  We=20

don't want her.  THE DEAN.  Good gracious! Georgiana and I reconciled after=
 all these years! She=20

THE DEAN.=20

[_Embracing his daughters._] A second mother to my girls. She will implant =

s-her-name?  SHEBA.=20

Who is she?  THE DEAN.  My dears--a mournful, miserable history! [_With his=
 head bent he walks=20

to a chair, and holds out his hands to the girls, who go to him and kneel a=
t his feet._] When you=20

were infants your Aunt Georgiana married an individual whose existence I fe=
lt it my sad duty never=20

to recognize.  SALOME.  A bad man?  THE DEAN.  He died ten years ago, and, =
therefore, we will=20

say a misguided man. He was a person who bred horses to run in races for am=
usement combined=20

with profit. He was also what is called a Gentleman Jockey, and it was your=
 aunt's wifely boast=20

that if ever he vexed her she could take a stone off his weight in half an =
hour. In due course his=20

neck was dislocated.  SHEBA.  By Aunt?  THE DEAN.  Hush, child, no! You wil=
l be little wiser=20

when I tell you he came a cropper!  SALOME.  How awful it all sounds!  THE =
DEAN.  Left a widow,=20

you would think it natural that Georgiana Tidman would have flown to her br=
other, himself a=20



widower. Not at all. Maddened, I hope, by grief, she continued the career o=
f her misguided=20

husband, and for years, to use her own terrible words, she was "the Daisy o=
f the Turf."  SHEBA.=20

What's that?  THE DEAN.  I don't know, toy-child. But at length retribution=
 came. Ill luck fell upon=20

her--her horses, stock, everything, came to the hammer. That was my hour. "=
Come to me," I=20

wrote, "my children yearn for you."  SHEBA _and_ SALOME.  [_With wry faces.=
_] Oh!  THE=20

DEAN.  "At the Deanery of St. Marvells, with the cares of a household, and =
a stable which=20

contains only a thirteen-year-old pony, you may obtain rest and forgetfulne=
ss." And she is coming!=20

SHEBA _and_ SALOME.  When? Oh! when?  THE DEAN.  She merely says, "Soon."  =
SHEBA=20

_and_ SALOME.  [_Stamping with vexation._] Ugh!  THE DEAN.  Salome, Sheba, =
you will, I fear,=20

find her a sad broken creature, a weary fragment, a wave-tossed derelict. L=
et it be your coolness,=20

and remain entirely unmoved. It would be like kicking against a blank wall,=
--a child's foolish=20

instinctive paroxysm of passion. Therefore he was not violent with Rintoul,=
 nor sharply satirical,=20

except by moments. He did not appeal to his feelings, nor stand upon his ow=
n authority. If indeed=20

he could not keep his exasperation out of his voice, nor conceal his annoya=
nce, he did this only=20

because he could not help it, not with any idea of influencing Rintoul. But=
 it was indeed a very=20

serious blow which he had received,--the most telling of all.  "After this,=
" he said, "why should I go=20

on struggling? What advantage will it be to me to change Lindores into a Br=
itish peerage? I could=20

not enjoy it long in the course of nature, nor could I afford to enjoy it. =
And as for my son, he will=20

have enough to do to get bread and butter for his numerous family. A season=
 in town, and a seat=20

in the House of Lords, will after this be perfectly out of the question."  =
"I suppose it's just as likely=20

as not that the House of Lords will be abolished before my time," said Rint=
oul calmly,--"at least=20

they say so."  "They say d----d nonsense, sir," cried the earl, touched at =
his tenderest point. "The=20

House of Lords will outlive you and half a hundred like you. They don't kno=
w Englishmen who say=20

so. I had hoped to see my family advancing in power and influence. Here was=
 poor Torrance's=20

death, for instance, coming in providentially to make up for Edith's folly =
about Millefleurs." Here=20

Lord Lindores made a little pause and looked at his son. He had, beyond exp=
ectation, made, he=20

thought, an impression upon him. "Ah," he said, "I see, you forgot the Tint=
o influence. You thought=20

it was all up with my claims when Millefleurs slipped through our fingers. =
On the contrary, I never=20

felt so like attaining my point as now."  "That is not what I was thinking,=
 father," said Rintoul in a=20

slightly broken voice. He had risen from his chair and walked to the window=
, and stood there,=20

keeping his face averted as he spoke. "I cannot tell you," he said more ear=
nestly, "the effect it has=20

upon me when you speak of getting an advantage from--what has happened. Som=
ehow it makes=20

my blood run cold. I'd rather lose everything I have than profit by that--a=
ccident. I can't bear the=20

idea. Besides," he added, recovering himself, "I wouldn't build so upon it =
if I were you. It's all in=20

Carry's hand, and Carry will like to have things her own way."  "This exhib=
ition of sentiment in=20

respect to Pat Torrance takes me altogether by surprise," said Lord Lindore=
s. "I was not aware=20

you had any such friendship for him. And as to Carry. Pooh! Carry has not g=
ot a way of her own."=20

This subject, though it was so painful to Rintoul, brought the conversation=
 to an easier level. But=20

when the young man had left him, Lord Lindores remained for a long time sil=
ent, with his head in=20

his hands, and a bitterness of disappointment pervading his mind, which, if=
 it had not a very=20

exalted cause, was still as keen as any tragedy could require. He had let t=
hings go much as they=20

would before he came to his kingdom; but when Providence, with that strange=
 sweep of all that=20



stood before him, had cleared his way to greatness, he had sworn to himself=
 that his children=20

should all be made instrumental in bringing the old house out of its humble=
 estate--that they=20

should every one add a new honour to Lindores. Now he said to himself bitte=
rly that it would have=20

been as well if his brothers had lived,--if he had never known the thorns t=
hat stud a coronet. What=20

had the family gained? His son would have been quite good enough for Nora B=
arrington if he had=20

never been more than Robin Lindores; and John Erskine would have been no gr=
eat match for his=20

daughter, even in the old times. It would have been as well for them if no =
change had come upon=20

the fortunes of the family,--if all had remained as when they were born. Wh=
en he thought of it,=20

there was a moment when he could have gnashed his teeth with rage and morti=
fication. To have=20

sworn like a trooper or wept like a woman, would have been some relief to h=
is feelings; or even to=20

clench his hands and his teeth, and stamp about the floor like a baffled vi=
llain on the stage. But he=20

did not dare to relieve himself by any of these safety-valves of nature. He=
 was too much afraid of=20

himself to be melodramatic or hysterical. He sat and gnawed his nails, and =
devoured his own=20

heart. His house seemed to be tumbling about his ears like a house of cards=
. Why should he take=20

any further trouble about it? Neither money nor importance, nothing but lov=
e, save the mark!=20

idiocy--the passing fancy of boys and girls. Probably they would all hate e=
ach other in a year or=20

two, and then they would understand what their folly had done for them. He =
thought of this with a=20

vindictive pleasure; but even of that=20

ed widow.  _BLORE=20

enters with a telegram._  BLORE.  A telegram, sir!  [_THE DEAN opens telegr=

r something!  SHEBA.=20

Salt in her bed, Salome!  SALOME.  Yes, and the peg out of the rattling win=
dow!  [_They grip=20

hands earnestly._  THE DEAN.  Good gracious! Bless me! Girls, your Aunt Geo=
rgiana slept at the=20

"Wheatsheaf," at Durnstone, last night, and is coming on this morning!  SAL=
OME _and_ SHEBA.=20

To-day!  THE DEAN.  Blore, tell Willis to get the chaise out.  [_BLORE hurr=
ies out._  THE DEAN.=20

Salome, child, you and I will drive into Durnstone--we may be in time to br=
ing your Aunt over. My=20

 The bell! [_Looking out=20

of window._] No--yes--it can't be! [_Speaking in an altered voice._] Childr=
en! I wonder if this is your=20

Aunt Georgiana?  [_BLORE appears with a half-frightened, surprised look._  =
BLORE.  Mrs.=20

and appearance, and dressed in pronounced masculine style, with billy cock =
hat and coaching=20

greatest excitement in=20

the house. Rintoul told his mother and sister, and was half angered by thei=
r sympathy. Edith, who=20

was herself in great agitation, received the intimation with delight; but t=
his delight was quite=20

distasteful to her brother, who stopped her by a wrathful request to her no=
t to think this was a=20

nonsensical affair like her own. "I know what I'm about; but as for you, it=
 is just a piece of idiocy,"=20

he said: at which poor Edith, aghast, retired into herself, wounded beyond =
description by this=20

rejection of her sympathy. Having thus snubbed his sister, he defied the al=
armed surprise and=20

tempered disapprobation with which his mother heard his story. "I know that=
 you were never a=20

very great friend to Nora," he said. "I suppose when another girl cuts out =
your own, you can't be=20

expected to be quite just. But my father and I understand each other," said=
 Rintoul. He went out=20

after having thus mowed down the ranks on either side of him, in a not unco=
mfortable frame of=20

mind, carrying with him, in order to post it with his own hand, the letter =
to Colonel Barrington,=20

which he had informed his father had been written on the previous day. And =
this was quite true;=20

but having=20

THE DEAN recoils._  GEORGIANA.  Well, Gus, my boy, how are you?  THE DEAN. =

Georgiana!  GEORGIANA.  [_Patting THE DEAN'S cheeks._] You're putting on to=
o much flesh,=20

Augustin; they should give you a ten-miler daily in a blanket.  THE DEAN.  =
[_With dignity._] My=20

dear sister!  GEORGIANA. had carefully reserved it till after his interview=
 with his father. Had Lord=20

Lindores been very violent, probably Colonel Barrington would not have had =
his letter; not that=20

Rintoul would have given Nora up, but that he had, like most wise men, a st=
rong faith in=20

postponement. Wait a little and=20


_
Are these your two-year-olds? [_To SALOME._] Kiss your Aunt! [_She kisses S=
ALOME with a=20

good hearty smack._] [_To SHEBA._] Kiss your Aunt! [_She embraces SHEBA, th=

that there was very little to be made of Rintoul except by giving him his o=

violent, the letter went without delay.  Thus, as it sometimes happens, the=
 worst of the family=20

misfortunes was the one that was condoned most easily; for certainly, in th=
