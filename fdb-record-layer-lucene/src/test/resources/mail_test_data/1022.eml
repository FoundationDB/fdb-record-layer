 I've enough and to spare, and what one gives away, as we all know, goes to=
 our good account in the end."  "That depends on the spirit morning came I =
had been late in getting to the train: how I had struggled with the two men=
 who tried to keep me out of the reserved compartment into which they were =
intruding. How the man who had a right to it, after wishing to prevent my e=
ntering, helped me in the end, rather than _
see,--the hand that scatters the blessings over my path, the Father's hand =
that filleth all things with=20

plenteousness! And even like his free bounty should be that of his children=
; _freely ye have=20

received, freely give_!"  A thin, weary wayfarer was sitting on the side of=
 the path; his patched=20

coat, his half-worn-out shoes, and sunken cheek told of need, although the =
man was no beggar.=20

Following simply the impulse of his heart, Franks pulled out his sandwich a=
nd courteously  The=20

word "treaty" was new to me in this connection, for the Foreign Secretary h=
ad not thought it=20

necessary that his messenger should be wholly in his secrets--and Maxine's.=
 Yet hearing the word=20

brought no great surprise. I knew that I had been cat's-paw in some game of=
 high stakes. But it=20

was of Maxine I thought now, and the importance of the loss to her, not the=
 national disaster which=20

it might well be also.  "Wait," I said, "don't despair yet. There's some mi=
stake. Perhaps we=20


_
stranger. The smile and hearty blessing with which it was received sent the=
 one-armed school-

master on his way with a heart even more joyous than it had been a few minu=
tes before. To give is=20

a godlike pleasure, and he who does not know what it is to do so _with deli=
ght_ has missed one of=20

the richest luxuries which man can enjoy below.  As Ned Franks passed along=
 the high road, he=20

could see in a neighboring field a man engaged in sowing.  "To bury seed is=
 not to lose seed,"=20

thought Ned, "though it seem for a while to disappear, like money which is =
given to the Lord, or to=20

the poor for his sake. A man who spends all that he has shall be able to se=
e light when we've=20

thrashed this out and talked it over. I know I had a green letter-case. It =
never left my pocket. I=20

thought of it and guarded it every moment. Could those diamonds have been i=
nside it? Could the=20

Foreign Secretary had given me the necklace, _instead_ of what you expected=
?"  "No, no," she=20

answered with desperate impatience. "He knew that the only thing which coul=
d save me was the=20

document I'd sent him. I wired that I must have it back again immediately, =
for my own sake--for=20

his--for the sake of England. Ivor! Think again. Do you want me to go mad?"=
  "I will think," I said,=20

trying to speak=20


_
family alone seems to me like one who grinds and bakes and eats all his see=
d-corn. He gains=20

some present advantage, no doubt, but he will find want and dearth in the e=
nd, for he has not=20

sown for the future. And the man who lays by and hoards what ought to be gi=
ven in charity is like=20

one who locks up his seed-corn in a chest until it grows mouldy and worthle=
ss. It neither feeds him=20

nor grows for him; it is worse than good for nothing. While _he that gives =
to the poor lends to the=20

Lord_, and the Lord will give him rich increase, not because of the man's d=
eserts, but because of=20

our heavenly Father's own free bounty towards those who seek to please him.=
"  Ned, walking on=20

with quick, active step, overtook Ben Stone, who, carrying his basket of ca=
rpenter's tools, was=20

proceeding at a more leisurely pace in the same direction.  "Whither bound,=
 messmate?" cried=20

Franks, as he came up with the burly carpenter.  "I've a job at the Hall," =
replied Stone; "the new=20

baronet will be coming down to the old house one of these days, and will wa=
nt to find everything=20

right there. Where are you going, Ned Franks?"  "I'm going to see if Bat Be=
ll won't add something=20

to the collection for the tumble-down cottages in Wild Rose Hollow. He was =
not at church=20

yesterday."  Ben Stone burst out laughing, as he had a habit of doing upon =
moment--a quiet=20

moment--"  "A quiet moment," she repeated, bitterly, "when for me each seco=
nd is an hour! It's=20

late, and this is the night of my new play. Soon, I must be at the theatre,=
 for the make-up and=20

dressing of this part for the first act are a heavy business. I don't want =
all Paris to know that=20

Maxine de Renzie has been ruined by her enemies. Let us keep the secret whi=
le we can, for=20

others' sakes, and so gain time for our own, if all is not lost--if you bel=
ieve still that there's any=20

hope. Oh, save me, Ivor--somehow. My whole life is in this."  "Let your und=
erstudy take your part=20

to-night, while we think, and work," I suggested. "You cannot go to the the=
atre in this state."  "For=20

an actress there's no such word as 'cannot,'" she said bitterly. "I could p=
lay a part to the finish, and=20

crawl off the stage to die the next instant; yet no one would have guessed =
that I was dying. I have=20

no understudy. What use to have one? What audience would stop in the theatr=
e after an=20

announcement that their Maxine's understudy would take her place? Every man=
 and woman=20

would walk out and get his money back. No; for the sake of the man I love b=
etter than my life, or=20

twenty lives--the man I've either saved or ruined--I'll play tonight, if I =
go mad or kill myself to-

morrow. Don't 'think quietly,' Ivor. Think out=20


_
slightest occasion. "Going to ask Bat Bell for money! Going to try how much=
 meal you can scrape=20

off an old knife-board! ha! ha! ha! I put my shilling in the plate yesterda=
y;"--the carpenter said this=20

with a self-satisfied air, as one who felt conscious of having done the han=
dsome thing;--"but I don't=20

mind promising to double whatever you manage to squeeze out of Bat Bell; on=
ly, of course he=20

mustn't know that I've said so."  other, so. Let us go over together everyt=
hing that happened to you=20

from the minute you took the letter-case from the Foreign Secretary up to t=
he minute I came into=20

this room."  I obeyed, beginning at the very beginning and telling her all,=
 except the part that had=20

to do with Diana Forrest. She had no concern in that. I told her how I had =
slept with the green=20

letter-case under my pillow, and had waked to feel and look for it once=20
