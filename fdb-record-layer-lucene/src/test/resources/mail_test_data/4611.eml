ings about them. I _
has gone to Mr. Danesfield about our money. Please come into the drawing-ro=
om. We are rather=20

upset, for we are beginning to pack, and Hannah is washing out the anti-mac=
assars and the white=20

muslin curtains, for we think the muslin curtains will look so nice in our =
cheap lodgings. We are=20

very busy, awfully busy, but do come in and sit down. Eyebright, here is Mr=
s. Ellsworthy. Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy, isn't Eyebright a silly?--she is quite fretting because she won=
't see those last seeds of=20

hers come up in the garden. Now, if she was asked to leave the Pink I would=
 say nothing, but of=20

course the Pink comes too."  "Yes, dear, and Daisy shall have plenty of gar=
den ground for fresh=20

seeds. Oh! my dear children," continued Mrs. Ellsworthy, "I shall be so del=
ighted to welcome you=20

all to Shortlands, only I think you might have replied to my letter."  Mrs.=
 Ellsworthy was by this time=20

seated in a low arm-chair by the window, and Jasmine was standing before he=
r, while Daisy sat=20

demurely on the floor, and folded up the anti-macassars.  "We might have an=
swered your letter?"=20

repeated Jasmine. "Well now, do you know, to be quite frank and open, your =
letter was a little bit=20

females----"  "But your black eyes!" she interrupted. "Who made them like t=
hat? Has some one=20

been fighting you?"  "A feller handed 'em out to me last night, and I didn'=
t happen to be in a=20

position to refuse 'em," he replied, his grisly weather-browned features li=
ghting up with a wry smile.=20

"Who dared strike you like that!"  "Now, don't you worry, Beth. It ain't as=
 bad as it looks. You see, I=20

was on my way over from the station last night from the late city train. Wh=
en I got to the top of the=20

hill I sot down for a spell, and while I was thinking, I looked down on my =
place. I see a light in the=20

pantry window flicker up, die down, and then settle into a steady glow. I c=
al'lated it must be pirates=20

aboard the old craft, so I tore down the hill like blazes and busted into t=
he house. Something=20

struck me like a ton of brick, and I went down. I never see so many stars i=
n all my life. The next=20

thing I heard was a voice asking if I was hurt, and saying, 'You'll pardon =
me, sir.'" He chuckled with=20

his first sign of mirth. "When I got my senses back there was a big feller =
sitting on me, nearly=20

choking off my wind. He brung out one of them lightning-bug=20


_
a lecture. You did give it to darling old Primrose, and somehow or other yo=
u made Daisy cry. You=20

spoke about a plan, and you said it was a delightful plan, but--but before =
we read that part of your=20

letter Primrose thought of another plan of her own, and _it_ was so exquisi=
te, so perfect, that we=20

tore up your plan for fear we and turned it full on me, and then shouted li=
ke a maniac, 'Why, it's=20

Cap'n Pott!' 'That's me, but who in hell be you?' I'm telling you just as I=
 said it. He told me his=20

name was Mack McGowan. Well, I was real glad to see him till he told me he =
was the new=20

preacher and was going to live with me. Eadie Beaver had put him up in my=
=20


_
tempted by it. We don't know your plan, Mrs. Ellsworthy, and we don't want =
it, for we have made=20

our own, and ours is--yes, ours is lovely!"  Mrs. Ellsworthy had an express=
ive face, and while=20

Jasmine was talking it changed and grew anxious; her husband's words, "She =
is not our Jasmine=20

yet," returned to her. Like many rich and pretty women, she was mad as hops=
 when he told me=20

that, and I was going to throw him out, but,"--again he chuckled,--"well, I=
 didn't."  "You thought=20

caution was the better part of valor, is that it?" questioned Elizabeth.  "=
Something like that, Beth. I=20

cal'late we'd best say nothing to a soul about this. There'd be some who wo=
uldn't understand the=20

details of the=20


_
desire, and made her also feel irritable.  "It is rude to tear up the lette=
rs of kind friends," she said. "I=20

made a proposal which would have been in every way suitable to you girls, a=
nd you did not even=20

trouble yourselves to read it. No, my loves, I am not angry. Daisy, come an=
d give me a kiss;=20

Jasmine, be them who'd blame Mr. McGowan for what he wa'n't exactly respons=
ible for."  "Oh!=20

Can't I tell it? It's really too good to keep. And then," she added serious=
ly, "people might think you=20

have been really fighting. Don't you think it would be best to tell what ac=
tually happened?"  "Mighty=20

little any of them=20


_
shall I tell you the little plan which you would not read about last night?=
"  "Oh, we would not be=20

rude to you for the world," said Jasmine. "Daisy, come here, and give Mrs. =
Ellsworthy one of your=20

sweetest kisses. Of course I will hold your hand--I love you, and so does D=
aisy, and so does--"=20

"No, so does _not_ Primrose," answered Mrs. Ellsworthy. "Primrose is the op=
posing element--still I=20

trust I may conquer her. Now, my children, may I tell the plan?"  "Oh yes, =
do tell us," they both it=20

would be best for the parson if we'd keep it quiet."  "Very well, Uncle Jos=
iah. He is really going to=20

live with you, isn't he?"  "Don't that look like it?" he asked, pointing hi=
s pipe-stem toward the=20

house.  "But that is for you, too."  "For me? You'd see that set of females=
 getting down on their=20

prayer-bones for an old sinner like me, except to ask God A'mighty to strik=
e me dead. I ain't that=20

popular, not yet."  "Captain Pott, I don't like that one bit! I canceled al=
l my=20


_
not be of the slightest use, for we have made our own."  "Well, dear, plans=
 of girls as young as you=20

are made to be altered. Now listen to my scheme.  "Mr. Ellsworthy writes fo=
r the papers and for=20

one or two magazines. He has scientific tastes, and writing in this way giv=
es interest to his life; but=20

his eyes are not very strong, and he has for some time been wishing for som=
e nice girl to whom he=20

can dictate his thoughts. It seems to him, and to me too, that Primrose in =
the city when Father told=20

me the other day what the ladies of the church were planning to do for you.=
 I did it just to help you,=20

and now----"  "There, there, Beth." The old man reached out and touched her=
 arm. "Excuse me,=20

Beth. I feel like a cantankerous old sore-headed bear this morning. Of cour=
se, you come home to=20

help me. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."  "They mean well, too," she =
loyally defended her=20

neighbors.  "It was awful nice of you," he replied,=20
