 Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had one last sorrowful h=

word probably means, in the collection of students' dwellings, inhabited by=
 the sons of the prophets, where possibly there may have been some kind of =
right of sanctuary. Driven thence by Saul's following him, and having had o=
ne last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship--the last but one on occ=
asionally found myself walking past the door of the house, and wondering wh=
at was going on inside it. I felt that there would be something undignified=
 about pumping Broadhem, and yet every time I met him I experienced an irre=
sistible desire to do so.  At last one day he volunteered a remark, from wh=
ich I gathered that he was as anxious _
speedy destruction may befall them, but that God would first of all "make t=
hem reel" by the blow of=20

His might; would then fling them prostrate; would make their pride and fier=
ce words a net to snare=20

them; and then, at last, would bring them to nothing in the hot flames of H=
is wrath--that the world=20

may know that He is king. The picture of the prowling dogs recurs with deep=
ened scorn and firmer=20

confidence that they will hunt for their prey in vain.    "And they return =
at evening; they growl like a=20

dog,    And compass the city.    They--they prowl about for food    If (or,=
 since) they are not=20

satisfied, they spend the night (in the       search.)"  There is almost a =
smile on his face as he=20

thinks of their hunting about for him, like hungry hounds snuffing for thei=
r meal in the kennels, and=20

growling now in disappointment--while he is safe beyond their reach. And th=
e psalm ends with a=20

glad burst of confidence, and a vow of praise very characteristic on his li=
ps--    "But I--I will sing=20

Thy power,    And shout aloud, in the morning, Thy mercy,    For Thou hast =
been a fortress for me.=20

And a refuge in the day of my trouble.    My strength! unto Thee will I har=
p,    For God is my=20

fortress--the God of my mercy."  Thrice he repeats the vow of praise. His h=
arp was his companion=20

in his flight, and even in the midst of peril the poet's nature appears whi=
ch regards future occasion.=20

"FRANK VANECOURT."  Good-night, Dunderheadians. If in spite of this you sen=
d me a requisition=20

to stand again, I will decline on a ground simple enough even for your comp=
rehension--It is too=20

hot!  It was no business of mine, after the explanation which I had had wit=
h Lady Ursula upon the=20

subject of our rumoured engagement, to revert to the topic with any of her =
family. If Lady=20

Broadhem was dissatisfied with the position of affairs, I supposed that I s=
hould hear of it quite=20

soon enough; my only anxiety was about Ursula herself. I trembled for her d=
omestic peace and=20

comfort. Broadhem's few words about his sister's happiness under the altere=
d circumstances were=20

very significant, and I determined therefore to get her ladyship as much in=
 my power as possible,=20

by exercising to its utmost extent the right which I had wrung from her of =
a full control over her=20

pecuniary affairs. If my wealth did not enable me to purchase my own happin=
ess, it should at least=20

enable me to secure the happiness of her whom I loved best in the world. I =
had never wavered in=20

my resolution somehow or other to effect this great end, but my plans must =
of necessity undergo=20

some change now that Lady Broadhem's eyes were opened to the real state of =
the case. I was=20

much puzzled what to do about Grandon. Sometimes I felt a yearning to take =
him fully into my=20

confidence and=20


_
which regards all trial as occasions for praise. He has calmed his own spir=
it, as he had done=20

Saul's, by his song, and by prayer has swung himself clear above fightings =
and fears. The refrain,=20

which occurs twice in the psalm, witnesses to the growth of his faith even =
while he sings. At first=20

he could only say in patient expectance, "My topic which touched us both so=
 nearly; but though he=20

was kind and considerate as ever, there was a constraint about our intercou=
rse of which we were=20

both painfully conscious. We avoided all allusion to the Broadhems, and he =
never called in=20

Grosvenor Square, nor, so far as I know, had met Lady Ursula since the memo=
rable dinner which=20

had=20


_
wait upon thee, for God is my fortress." But at the end his mood is higher,=
 his soul has caught fire=20

as it revolves, and his last words are a triumphant amplification of his ea=
rlier trust: "My strength!=20

unto thee will I sing with the harp--for God is my fortress--the God of my =
mercy."     V.--THE=20

EXILE--_CONTINUED_.   "So David fled, and escaped and came to Samuel to Ram=
ah, and told=20

him all that Saul had done unto him. And he and Samuel also thought the wis=
est, and for many=20

reasons the most proper, course for me was, to abstain from going there unt=
il I should hear from=20

Lady Broadhem; and although I was anxious to consult her upon many business=
 matters, I=20

preferred letting them remain in abeyance to courting an interview which I =
dreaded. At last I began=20

to think Lady Broadhem's silence rather ominous. I felt that a thunder-clou=
d had been gathering for=20

some time past,=20
