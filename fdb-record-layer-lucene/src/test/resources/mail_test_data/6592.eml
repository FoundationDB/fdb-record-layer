e much to do with that=20

worthless Barton. I detest him more than any other man in the world."  "Now=
, Ned, darling, will you=20

let me say a little thing to you?" asked Persis, with a shy, tender glance =
at her husband, as she=20

laid her hand on his shoulder. "Do you think that our blessed religion allo=
ws us to detest any being=20

on earth?"  "It makes us hate sin!" exclaimed Franks.  "But surely _not_ si=
nners, my love."  "The=20

truth is," said the sailor school-master, "that I'm by nature of an impatie=
nt, fiery spirit. I'm one of=20

those of whom it is said that they make good lovers and good haters."  "A g=
ood lover, if you will,"=20

observed the wife with a pleasant smile; "but it always seems to me that th=
e expression, 'a good=20

hater,' can never describe a Christian, who is bound by the Lord's command,=
 not only not to detest=20

but to love his enemies."  "That's a most difficult command to obey."  "I a=
m sure that it is,"=20

observed Persis. "But He who gave the command, can also give grace to keep =
it. It seems to me,=20

as if hatred, revenge, and all the fierce passions so natural to man, are l=
ike Satan's fire-ships that=20

he sends against even those who are going on the straightest course towards=
 heaven--"  "And you=20

would have me 'sheer off,'" cried Franks, gayly, "as soon as I see one bear=
ing down on me,=20

because I carry a dangerous quantity of gunpowder down in my hold! You're a=
fraid of an=20

explosion, wifie, and you're right. I dare say now that there's something o=
f pride in my very=20

contempt for a fellow like Barton (he really is _not_ a gentleman); I despi=
se him too much in the=20

spirit of _Stand by, I am holier than thou_."  "And should we not remember,=
" said Persis, softly,=20

"that those whom we cannot respect are our fellow-creatures still; they, li=
ke ourselves, have souls,=20

precious souls, that must live forever? If they, through rejecting mercy, w=
ill have at last to share=20

the misery of the rich man in the parable, should not our deep, deep pity s=
wallow up every feeling=20

of dislike? And if, on the contrary, they are to be found in the end amongs=

been forgiven, can we not bear with them a while in _and most Humble Servan=

 return, as he said, for=20

her lecture. He promised to keep on his guard, less against Sir Lacy Barton=
 than against his own=20

fiery temper, and to "sheer off" as fast as he might, whenever he found tha=
t Satan's fire-ships of=20

XXII.  The Bonfire.   The=20

holidays given on account of the hay-making season were soon over, and with=
 their daily lessons=20

at school, the boys of Colme resumed their cheerful labors in Wild Rose Hol=
low. Already there was=20

a pleasant change in the aspect of two of the cottages, which, through the =
combined efforts of=20

workmen and boys, were declared by Franks to be "quite weather-tight and se=

up in dock, and well overhauled." Franks was ambitious to make the almshous=
es pretty as well as=20

comfortable. He set the boys to gathering a large quantity of tough boughs =
which, tastefully=20

interlaced, and painted to preserve them from decay, were to form seven rus=
tic porches, round=20

which creepers should be trained to climb.  "They'll be like cool, pretty b=
owers for the old folks to=20

sit in during the hot summer days," said Franks; and he took especial pleas=
ure in the gradually=20

increasing pile of collected branches stripped of their leaves, which forme=
d one of the most=20

conspicuous objects in what Ned called "the building yard" in Wild Rose Hol=
low.  Cheerfully, on=20

the day when work was resumed, the one-armed teacher led his jovial crew of=
 noisy young=20

workers along the familiar road which led to the scene of their labors. As =
Ned passed the cottage=20

of Sands, Nancy came forth to greet him with a good-humored smile on her fa=
ce, which, if it=20

looked paler and older than when he last had seen it, had certainly gained =
in pleasantness of=20
