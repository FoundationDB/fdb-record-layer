What weather-cocks we are! My blue Monday is over and done with, this is a crystalline winter day 

with all the earth at peace with itself, and I've just had a letter from Peter asking if I could take care 

of his sister's girl, Susie Mumford, until after Christmas. The Mumfords, it seems, are going 

through the divorce-mill, and Susie's mother is to be transferred from the Jacobite university to the 

Crown; and so it came to pass that the Court of King's Bench solemnly ratified as a fact what 

historical criticism pronounces to be a baseless fable. The case in favour of William of Durham as 

the founder is so clear, that the antiquaries are ready to burst with righteous indignation, and one

the grist of liberty is a-grinding.  I know nothing of Susie except what Peter has told me, that she is 

not yet nineteen, that she is intelligent, but obstreperous, and much wiser than she pretends to be,

city girl again, to talk over face-creams and the _Follies_ and Tchaikowsky and brassieres and 

Strindberg with. And I'll be glad to do a little toward repaying big-hearted old Peter for all his 

kindnesses of the past. Susie may be both sophisticated and intractable, but I await her with joy. 

She seems almost the answer to my one big want.  But Casa Grande, I have been realizing, will 

have to be refurbished for its coming guest. We have grown a bit shoddy about the edges here. 

It's seclusion and discipline, for the benefit of that multitude of young students who had hitherto 

dwelt at large in the city under little or no control, and often showed, by their faction fights and 

other outrages, that they contained the quintessence of the nation's turbulence as well as of its 

intellectual activity and ambition. The quaint old quadrangle of Merton, called, nobody seems to 

know why, "Mob" Quad, may be regarded as the cradle of collegiate life in England, and indeed in 

Europe.  Still University College is the oldest foundation of learning now existing in England; and
