led all about the sides=20

of the pen.  There was no suggestion of man-scent there.  Again he returned=
 to the honey.  The=20

taint about that was certain, but the honey almost drove him frantic.  So w=
ith a sudden motion he=20

snatched the coveted prize in his mouth and gave a hard tug at it.  He woul=
d seize it before the=20

man-scent had power to injure him and then flee.  But quick as were the mot=
ions of Black Bruin,=20

the trap was quicker, for the moment the trigger was loosed, the cord let g=
o the drop-door and=20

down it came with a great bang.  The bear was suddenly in darkness. treasur=
es,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, as=20

Mr. Ruby was quitting the apartment.  =E2=80=9COh! my lord, with you!=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, that is all very well; but, if any=20

thing is missed hereafter, it will always be remembered that these jewels w=
ere in my possession,=20

and I was alone. I highly object to it.=E2=80=9D But Mr. Ruby had vanished,=
 and did not immediately=20

reappear. In the mean time it was impossible for Lothair to move: he was al=
one, and surrounded=20

with precious necklaces, and glittering rings, and gorgeous bracelets, with=
 loose diamonds running=20

over the counter. It was not a kind or an amount of property that Lothair, =
relinquishing the trust,=20

could satisfactorily deliver=20


_
With a loud "Uff" he dropped the honey and turned in the pen, but the doorw=
ay by which he had=20

entered was closed.  He sprang upon it with a growl and pushed with all his=
 might, but he was=20

pushing against the pillars, which were two trees nearly a foot in diameter=
, and he might as well=20

have pushed against the side of a cliff.  Then he whirled about and, seizin=
g the spindle in his=20

mouth, pulled violently upon it, but it availed him nothing.  Then he assai=
led first one wall and then=20

another in rapid succession. He tore the bark and also great pieces from th=
e logs with his teeth,=20

but the logs were thick and he merely strewed the inside of the trap with b=
ark and splinters,=20

leaving it still as strong as ever.  Then he braced crosswise upon the trap=
 and tried to push the=20

logs from their places.  They gave a very little when he put forth his gian=
t strength, but the effort=20

was futile.  Then he stood upon his hind legs and tried to reach the poles =
overhead with his paw,=20

but the trap was too high for this.  For hours he raged and tore at the log=
s which held him so=20

effectively. He stripped the inside of the pen entirely free of bark, and s=
hopman. The shopman,=20

however honest, might be suddenly tempted by Satan, and take the next train=
 to Liverpool. He felt=20

therefore relieved when Mr. Ruby reentered the room, breathless, with a vel=
vet casket. =E2=80=9CI beg=20

pardon, my lord, a thousand pardons, but I thought I would just run over to=
 Lord Topaz, only in the=20

square close by. His lordship is at Madrid, the only city one cannot depend=
 on communications=20

with by telegraph. Spaniards strange people, very prejudiced, take all sort=
s of fancies in their=20

head. Besides, Lord Topaz has more pearls than he can know what to do with,=
 and I should like=20

your lordship to see these,=E2=80=9D and he opened the casket.  =E2=80=9CEx=
actly what I want,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Lothair;=20

=E2=80=9Cthese must be the very pearls the Queen of Cyprus wore. What is th=
eir price?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThey are from=20

Genoa, and belonged to a doge,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby; =E2=80=9Cyour lordsh=
ip shall have them for the sum we=20

gave for them. There shall be no profit on the transaction, and we shall be=
 proud of it. We gave for=20

them four thousand guineas.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI will take them with me,=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair, who was afraid, if he left=20

them behind, Lord Topaz might arrive in the interval.=20
