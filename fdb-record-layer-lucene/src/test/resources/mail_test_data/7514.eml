EBOOK A MODERN CHRONICLE, VOLUME 6 ***     Produced by David Widger      A MODERN 

CHRONICLE  By Winston Churchill   Volume 6.    CHAPTER VI  CLIO, OR THALIA?  According to 

the ordinary and inaccurate method of measuring time, a fortnight may have gone by since the 

event last narrated, and Honora had tasted at last the joys of authorship. Her name was not to 

appear, to be sure, on the cover of the Life and Letters of General Angus Chiltern; nor indeed, so 

far, had she written so much as a chapter or a page of a work intended to inspire young and old 

with the virtues of citizenship. At present the biography was in the crucial constructive stage. 

Should the letters be put in one volume, and the life in another? or should the letters be inserted in 

the text of the life? or could not there be a third and judicious mixture of both of these methods? 

Honora's counsel on this and other problems was, it seems, invaluable. Her own table was fairly 

littered with biographies more or less famous which had been fetched from the library, and the 

method of each considered.  Even as Mr. Garrick would never have been taken for an actor in his 

coach and four, so our heroine did not in the least resemble George Eliot, for instance, as she sat 

before her mirror at high noon with Monsieur Cadron and her maid Mathilde in worshipful 

attendance. Some of the ladies, indeed, who have left us those chatty memoirs of the days before 

the guillotine, she might have been likened to. Monsieur Cadron was an artist, and his branch of 

art was hair-dressing. It was by his own wish he was here to-day, since he had conceived a new 

coiffure especially adapted, he declared, to the type of Madame Spence. Behold him declaring 

ecstatically that seldom in his experience had he had such hairs to work with.  "Avec une telle 

chevelure, l'on peut tout faire, madame. Etre simple, c'est le comble de l'art. Ca vous donne," he 

added, with clasped hands and a step backward, "ca vous donne tout a fait l'air d'une dame de 

Nattier."  Madame took the hand-glass, and did not deny that she was eblouissante. If madame, 

suggested Monsieur Cadron, had but a little dress a la Marie Antoinette? Madame had, cried 

madame's maid, running to fetch one with little pink flowers and green leaves on an ecru ground. 

Could any coiffure or any gown be more appropriate for an entertainment at which Clio was to 

preside?  It is obviously impossible that a masterpiece should be executed under the rules laid 

down by convention. It would never be finished. Mr. Chiltern was coming to lunch, and it was not 

the first time. On her appearance in the doorway he halted abruptly in his pacing of the drawing-

room, and stared at her.  "I'm sorry I kept you waiting," she said.  "It was worth it," he said. And 

they entered the dining room. A subdued, golden-green light came in through the tall glass doors 

that opened out on the little garden which had been Mrs. Forsythe's pride. The scent of roses was 

in the air, and a mass of them filled a silver bowl in the middle of the table. On the dark walls were 

Mrs. Forsythe's precious prints, and above the mantel a portrait of a thin, aristocratic gentleman 



who resembled the poet Tennyson. In the noonday shadows of a recess was a dark mahogany 

sideboard loaded with softly gleaming silver--Honora's. Chiltern sat down facing her. He looked at 

Honora over the roses,--and she looked at him. A sense of unreality that was, paradoxically, 

stronger than reality itself came over her, a sense of fitness, of harmony. And for the moment an 

imagination, ever straining at its leash, was allowed to soar. It was Chiltern who broke the silence. 

"What a wonderful bowl!" he said.  "It has been in my father's family a great many years. He was 

very fond of it," she answered, and with a sudden, impulsive movement she reached over and set 

the bowl aside.  "That's better," he declared, "much as I admire the bowl, and the roses."  She 

coloured faintly, and smiled. The feast of reason that we are impatiently awaiting is deferred. It 

were best to attempt to record the intangible things; the golden-green light, the perfumes, and the 

faint musical laughter which we can hear if we listen. Thalia's laughter, surely, not Clio's. Thalia, 

enamoured with such a theme, has taken the stage herself--and as Vesta, goddess of hearths. It 

was Vesta whom they felt to be presiding. They lingered, therefore, over the coffee, and Chiltern 

lighted a cigar. He did not smoke cigarettes.  "I've lived long enough," he said, "to know that I have 

never lived at all. There is only one thing in life worth having."  "What is it?" asked Honora.  "This," 

he answered, with a gesture; "when it is permanent."  She smiled.  "And how is one to know 

whether it would be--permanent?"  present, dear Aunt Leth, it is a tight fit." After this how could 

she make an appeal to him to help them out of their trouble? Meanwhile the day was approaching 

nearer and nearer.  It was Tuesday. On Wednesday, the following day, the acceptance was due, 

and Uncle Leth would have to meet it or go to the wall. The dear old home would be sold up, and 

they would be turned into the streets. The tears that ran down Aunt Leth's face were like tears of 

blood from her heart.  On this Tuesday it was that consternation seized upon Jeremiah Pamflett, 

and furious anger raged in Miser Farebrother's heart. The cause of these emotions was a 

newspaper article, which is here transcribed. It was headed:       "A STRANGE AFFAIR--THE 

BITERS BIT."  "A singular discovery has just come to light, and is in the hands of the police. 

Everybody is acquainted with the name of the wealthy miner from California, Mr. Quinlan, whose 

income is said to be not less than half a million a year. His name and his doings have been for a 

long time past in everybody's mouth. He is of humble origin, and his eccentricities may be 

accounted for by the fact of his having come into a marvellous fortune, the spending of the income 

of which would be a tax upon the ablest man in creation. It may be remembered that his wife died 

a couple of years since, and that last year he contracted a second marriage with an indifferent 

actress, whose extravagances in her new position have drawn attention to her in every city she 

and her husband have visited. The finest horses, the finest equipages, the finest dresses, the 

finest diamonds, the finest everything, in short, that cost vast sums of money. There came to the 

ears of Mrs. Quinlan and her too-generous husband that a diamond bracelet of rare--nay, of 

fabulous--value was in the market. The stones were of a monstrous size and of the purest colour. 

The price asked for this bracelet was no less than sixty thousand pounds. The stones alone, if sold 

singly, were valued by experts at considerably more than thirty thousand. To obtain possession of 

an ornament so rare and costly was a natural desire on the part of Mrs. Quinlan, and to her 

husband was a bagatelle. What are sixty thousand pounds to a man upon whom money continues 

to roll in a manner so bewildering? The upshot of the negotiations was that the bracelet was 

purchased and paid for, and Mrs. Quinlan the happy possessor.  "About four weeks ago Mr. and 



Mrs. Quinlan, with their retinue and treasures, arrived at the Langham Hotel, with the intention of 

stopping there for two or three days. But fate willed it otherwise. Mrs. Quinlan was taken ill, and 

was confined to her bed. So serious was her illness that she was a prisoner in her bedroom for 

more than three weeks. Mr. Quinlan did not remain in attendance upon her the whole of this time. 

He had business which took him frequently to Paris and other places; consequently, for a greater 

part of the time during which his wife was suffering, he was an absentee.  "Among Mrs. Quinlan's 

serving-women was one of great attractions, and who was a special favourite with her mistress. 

This young woman's name is Alice Frost. She had the entire confidence of her mistress, and, as 

events have proved, was unworthy of it. To her was intrusted, during Mrs. Quinlan's sickness, the 

charge of the lady's jewels, which were kept in a very substantial safe in Mrs. Quinlan's bedroom. 

It was often impressed upon Mrs. Quinlan that she was imprudent to carry so much valuable 

property about with her; but she disregarded these hints, and took her pleasures in her own way. 

One of these pleasures, in the course of her illness, was to have all her jewels and ornaments 

spread out before her on her bed, and to handle and gaze upon them. We hold that she was 

sensible in this, for what is the use of buried treasure? The servant who took these priceless gems 

from the safe for the inspection of her mistress was Alice Frost.  "Suddenly Alice Frost disappears. 

She is not discharged, she is not sick, she is not in disgrace; she simply disappears. Mrs. Quinlan, 

much distressed at the loss of so great a favourite, calls in a private detective. He listens to all that 

Mrs. Quinlan can impart to him, and when she has finished, remarks, 'She has run away.' 

"'Impossible,' says Mrs. Quinlan. 'Why should she run away? Somebody has carried her off. She is 

very good-looking.'  "Says the detective, 'She had charge of your jewellery?'  "'To some extent,' 

says Mrs. Quinlan. 'But it is all kept in the safe there.'  "'Would you have any objection to our 

looking through it,' says the detective, 'and seeing that nothing is missing?'  "'No objection 

whatever,' says Mrs. Quinlan.  "Whereupon the safe is unlocked, and the treasures laid forth. With 

one exception it is all correct. Nothing is missing but the wonderful diamond bracelet. That is gone. 

"'It accounts,' remarked the detective, 'for the disappearance of Alice Frost.'  "Mrs. Quinlan fell 

back speechless, and, when she recovered, bade the detective track Alice Frost and the sixty-

thousand-pound bracelet.  "What has been discovered is this: Alice Frost disappeared one Friday 

night. Presumably the diamond bracelet also disappeared at the same time.  "What occurred in or 

about the Langham Hotel on that night which may afford a clue to the discovery of the robber or 

robbers?  "On that night the policeman on duty observed a man walking on the opposite side of 

the road for a space of a couple of hours. This man did nothing but walk slowly up and down, 

keeping as much as possible in the dark, and looking for some person he was waiting for. The 

policeman on duty passed him on three occasions, and although the man endeavoured to avoid 

him, he obtained a good view of his features. He will be able to recognize the man.  "At half past 

eleven a woman came out of the Langham, and went over to the man. The policeman on duty saw 

this movement, but is not sure that he will be able to identify the woman. Of the man he _is_ sure. 

"The woman spoke to the man behind his back. The man did not turn his face. She slipped a 

parcel into his hands, and walked rapidly away. Almost immediately the man was joined by 

another in an Inverness cape, and the two walked away together. The policeman on duty saw 

nothing more of them. From the manner in which they walked away together there is no doubt that 

they were intimately acquainted with each other, and that they were confederates. So far, the 



policeman; now for the next evidence.  "As near as the cabman can remember, driver of a four-

wheeler, it was within a few minutes of midnight that a man hailed him and bade him come along. 

They went a couple of hundred yards and took up a man in an Inverness cape. The man who 

hailed the driver gave him half a sovereign 'on account,' and directed him to drive along the 

Finchley Road. He did so, and observed while he was driving that the men inside the cab were 

lighting matches, which proves that they were examining something--probably the diamond 

bracelet. After driving about an hour he was called upon to stop, and before he had pulled up his 

horse the man in the Inverness cape jumped out of the cab and disappeared. Then he was 

directed to drive back to London, and he did so, stopping, by orders, in Portland Place. The man 

who hailed him first (now the only one remaining in the cab) alighted, and the cabman noticed that 

he had a parcel in his hand. Again the diamond bracelet. The cabman asked for a few shillings 

more, reminding his fare that the half-sovereign given to him was 'on account.' The man said that 

he was well paid, and refused to part with anything further. The cabman began to argue with him, 

but the man did not stop; he ran off. The cabman's description of his fare tallies with that of the 

policeman on duty at the Langham Hotel. The cabman will be able to identify him.  "In some way 

which we are not at liberty to divulge, but in which we may say the good-looking Alice Frost is 

concerned, the disappearance of a blackleg going by the name of Captain Ablewhite bears upon 

the robbery. It is known that this Captain Ablewhite took the night train on the following Tuesday to 

Dover. Nothing further is at present discovered of him.  "Now comes the piquant feature in the 

robbery.  "To Mr. Quinlan, who arrived at the Langham Hotel after the discovery of the robbery, 

the detective narrated all the particulars of the affair. Mr. Quinlan laughed. His wife asked him 

what he was laughing at.  "'My dear,' he said to her, 'the loss is not so great as you suppose. Your 

diamond bracelet is safe.'  "'Safe!' she cried.  "'Here it is.' He pulled it from his pocket. 'The fact is, 

you would not be persuaded that it was imprudent to travel with so much valuable property about 

you, and I therefore took the precaution of having a bracelet made exactly like this. All _the stones 

in the bracelet that is stolen are false_!'  "An agreeable contemplation for the robbers. The biters 

are bit.  "The affair is in the hands of the detectives in Scotland Yard, who are confident that they 

will be able to track the robbers."         *       *       *       *       *  This newspaper article it was that 

struck consternation to the heart of Jeremiah Pamflett. He turned hot and cold. First he was 

clammy; the next moment he broke out into a hot perspiration. He had been swindled, tricked, 

betrayed; he, the wretched, depraved thief, had fallen amongst thieves. He, the sharper, had been 

sharped. Truly, the biter was bit! 


_
distinguish the reality when it comes. It is unmistakable."  "Suppose it comes too late?" she said, 

forgetting the ancient verse inscribed in her youthful diary: "Those who walk on ice will slide 

against their wills."  "To admit that is to be a coward," he declared.  "Such a philosophy may be 

fitting for a man," she replied, "but for a woman--"  "We are no longer in the dark ages," he 

interrupted. "Every one, man or woman, has the right to happiness. There is no reason why we 

should suffer all our lives for a mistake."  "A mistake!" she echoed.  "Certainly," he said. "It is all a 

matter of luck, or fate, or whatever you choose to call it. Do you suppose, if I could have found 

fifteen years ago the woman to have made me happy, I should have spent so much time in 

seeking distraction?"  "Perhaps you could not have been capable of appreciating her--fifteen years 

ago," suggested Honora. And, lest he might misconstrue her remark, she avoided his eyes. 

"Perhaps," he admitted. "But suppose I have found her now, when I know the value of things." 

"Suppose you should find her now--within a reasonable time. What would you do?"  "Marry her," 

he exclaimed promptly. "Marry her and take her to Grenoble, and live the life my father lived 

before me."  She did not reply, but rose, and he followed her to the shaded corner of the porch 

where they usually sat. The bundle of yellow-stained envelopes he had brought were lying on the 

table, and Honora picked them up mechanically.  "I have been thinking," she said as she removed 

the elastics, "that it is a mistake to begin a biography by the enumeration of one's ancestors. 

Readers become frightfully bored before they get through the first chapter."  "I'm beginning to 

believe," he laughed, "that you will have to write this one alone. All the ideas I have got so far have 

been yours. Why shouldn't you write it, and I arrange the material, and talk about it! That appears 

to be all I'm good for."  If she allowed her mind to dwell on the vista he thus presented, she did not 

betray herself.  "Another thing," she said, "it should be written like fiction."  "Like fiction?"  "Fact 

should be written like fiction, and fiction like fact. It's difficult to express what I mean. But this life of 

your father deserves to be widely known, and it should be entertainingly done, like Lockhart, or 

Parton's works--"  An envelope fell to the floor, spilling its contents. Among them were several 

photographs.  "Oh," she exclaimed, "how beautiful! What place is this?"  "I hadn't gone over these 

letters," he answered. "I only got them yesterday from Cecil Grainger. These are some pictures of 

Grenoble which must leave been taken shortly before my father died."  She gazed in silence at the 

old house half hidden by great maples and beeches, their weighted branches sweeping the 

ground. The building was of wood, painted white, and through an archway of verdure one saw the 

generous doorway with its circular steps, with its fan-light above, and its windows at the side. 

Other quaint windows, some of them of triple width, suggested an interior of mystery and interest. 

"My great-great-grandfather, Alexander Chiltern, built it," he said, "on land granted to him before 

the Revolution. Of course the house has been added to since then, but the simplicity of the original 

has always been kept. My father put on the conservatory, for instance," and Chiltern pointed to a 

portion at the end of one of the long low wings. "He got the idea from the orangery of a Georgian 

house in England, and an English architect designed it."  Honora took up the other photographs. 

One of them, over which she lingered, was of a charming, old-fashioned garden spattered with 

sunlight, and shut out from the world by a high brick wall. Behind the wall, again, were  What 

should he do? How was he to act in order to insure his safety? The policeman who had been on 

duty at the Langham Hotel on that Friday night said that he could identify him. The cabman he had 

engaged said the same. If he had had a sufficient sum of money he would have flown the country, 



but he had been compelled on that day to make a payment to the book-maker who held his 

acceptances for his losses at Doncaster, and he had not enough left to pay his fare to the 

Continent. And what would be the use of his going there if he had? He could not live without 

money; he did not understand a word of any other language than English; and he would be sure to 

be tracked and brought back. His flight would make it worse for him; it would be an admission of 

guilt. Should he stop and brave it out? Upon reflection he gained a little courage. He argued with 

himself, despite the policeman's and the cabman's declarations that they could identify him, that it 

was scarcely possible they could do so unless he betrayed himself. He had been at great trouble 

to conceal his features from the policeman's scrutiny, and it only required him to put a good face 

on the matter to brazen it out; to so confuse the man, even if he came into contact with him, that 

he would pass unnoticed. But there was no occasion for him to come into contact with the 

policeman. He would keep out of the way, and the affair would blow over. Captain Ablewhite would 

not, could not, come back. The mere thought of Captain Ablewhite roused him to fury. He looked 

blindly round for something to strangle. If the bland, smiling Captain were before him now! If he 

could meet him in some dark place! All surrounding objects seemed to be swimming in blood.  He 

ran into his bedroom, and filling the wash-hand basin with cold water, plunged his head into it. The 

action recalled him to his calmer self. Notwithstanding which, he said aloud, with a cunning smile, 

"I may find you one day, my Captain, and then, and then!" He clenched his hand and opened it, 

and twined his fingers, as though he had them on Captain Ablewhite's throat.  But there was no 

telling whether he was in danger or not. What it was imperatively necessary he should get 

possession of at once was money, in order to be prepared. Where could he get it from? Ah, his 

mother!  He would go down to Parksides immediately. Perhaps he might find Miser Farebrother's 

hidden treasure.  He emerged into the streets. As he descended the stairs he saw before him a 

vision of blood. Two men struggled for life and death. The house was very quiet. Only he and the 

_other man_ occupied space. He tore at the Shadow's throat, he took a knife from his pocket, he 

plunged it in--  Blood, blood everywhere! Above him, beneath him, around him. Again and again 

the knife descended. What a delight to punish an enemy so! You tricked me, you robbed me, you 

laid snares for me! Take that--and that--and that!  He laughed aloud before he went into the street, 

and then he put on a smug face.  There were a number of persons walking this way and that, but 

not one took the slightest notice of him. He nodded to a passing acquaintance, who nodded back 

at him, and smiled. He was safe. What cause was there for fear?  In the sunlight the vision of 

blood vanished. He was face to face with the world, and his native cunning asserted itself.  Then 

he thought he was going down to Parksides to see his mother. He would have to see Miser 

Farebrother. He must have some excuse for the visit. He retraced his steps and went back to the 

office, arming himself with account-books, which he took up indiscriminately and made into a 

parcel, tying it up with string----  The string was red! Miser Farebrother's offices were very gloomy; 

the windows had been frosted, so that no person should see 


_
between nodding foxgloves and Canterbury bells, in a curved recess, a stone seat.  She turned 

her face. His was at her shoulder.  "How could you ever have left it?" she asked reproachfully. 

She voiced his own regrets, which the crowding memories had awakened.  "I don't know," he 

answered, not without emotion. "I have often asked myself that question." He crossed over to the 

railing of the porch, swung about, and looked at her. Her eyes were still on the picture. "I can 

imagine you in that garden," he said.  Did the garden cast the spell by which she saw herself on 

the seat? or was it Chiltern's voice? She would indeed love and cherish it. And was it true that she 

belonged there, securely infolded within those peaceful walls? How marvellously well was Thalia 

playing her comedy! Which was the real, and which the false? What of true value, what of peace 

and security was contained in her present existence? She had missed the meaning of things, and 

suddenly it was held up before her, in a garden.  A later hour found them in Honora's runabout 

wandering northward along quiet country roads on the eastern side of the island. Chiltern, who 

was driving, seemed to take no thought of their direction, until at last, with an exclamation, he 

stopped the horse; and Honora beheld an abandoned mansion of a bygone age sheltered by 

ancient trees, with wide lands beside it sloping to the water.  "What is it?" she asked.  "Beaulieu," 

he replied. "It was built in the seventeenth century, I believe, and must have been a fascinating 

place in colonial days." He drove in between the fences and tied the horse, and came around by 

the side of the runabout. "Won't you get out and look at it?"  She hesitated, and their eyes met as 

he held out his hand, but she avoided it and leaped quickly to the ground neither spoke as they 

walked around the deserted house and gazed at the quaint facade, broken by a crumbling, shaded 

balcony let in above the entrance door. No sound broke the stillness of the summer's day--a 

pregnant stillness. The air was heavy with perfumes, and the leaves formed a tracery against the 

marvellous blue of the sky. Mystery brooded in the place. Here, in this remote paradise now in 

ruins, people had dwelt and loved. Thought ended there; and feeling, which is unformed thought, 

began. Again she glanced at him, and again their eyes met, and hers faltered. They turned, as 

with one consent, down the path toward the distant water. Paradise overgrown! Could it be 

reconstructed, redeemed?  In former days the ground they trod had been a pleasance the width of 

the house, bordered, doubtless, by the forest. Trees grew out of the flower beds now, and 

underbrush choked the paths. The box itself, that once primly lined the alleys, was gnarled and 

shapeless. Labyrinth had replaced order, nature had reaped her vengeance. At length, in the 

deepening shade, they came, at what had been the edge of the old terrace, to the daintiest of 

summer-houses, crumbling too, the shutters off strange silence prevailed.  As he tied the books 

together with the string, a streak of blood appeared, stretched itself along the table, and dropped, 

drip by drip, on the floor. Jeremiah held himself in suspense to listen to the spiritual sound which 

his mood had brought to his ears. Drip, drip, drip!  Captain Ablewhite's blood. The policeman's 

blood. The cabman's blood. The blood of any person who was his enemy.  Yes, he would crush 

the life out of them. Like this, like this, like this! He ground his foot into the floor, and looked down, 

smiling. Then, locking the doors and putting the keys into his pocket, he descended the stairs.  He 

walked slowly to the street landing. There were not many stairs; but all the way down he was 

engaged in the life and death struggle, and all the space around was bathed in blood. A ruthless 

ferocity was awakened within him. His safety, his liberty, his very life was at stake. What mattered 

all else? "Every man for himself, and--"  He paused at the next word, "God," against which he 



mentally strove, and conquering it, cast a defiant look at the pulsing, bloody shadows which 

encompassed him, and threw the street door open.  Once more in the sunlight--and safe! That 

was the great point. And safe! He called a cab, a four-wheeler, and looked the driver straight in the 

face; then laughed, and directed the man to drive him to the railway station.     CHAPTER V. 

MISER FAREBROTHER THREATENS JEREMIAH.   He usually travelled third-class to 

Beddington, but on this occasion he took a first-class ticket. To this piece of extravagance he was 

impelled by two reasons. He wished to be alone, and the first-class carriages were nearly always 

empty at this time of the day. Then, in the position in which he found himself--brought about partly 

by his own folly, but chiefly by the treachery of Captain Ablewhite--it mattered little how much he 

spent. What were pounds, shillings, and pence in comparison with his safety? He had worked 

himself into the belief that not only his liberty, but his life, was in peril.  The three first-class 

carriages in the train were unoccupied, and he got into one, and closed the door. No other 

passenger entered the carriage, and he travelled to Parksides alone.  He read again the 

newspaper article upon the diamond bracelet, and his feelings became more bitter and revengeful. 

The visions which had haunted him in Miser Farebrother's office reappeared. The words he was 

reading were printed in letters of blood; his eyes became blurred, and he wiped them with his 

handkerchief. The blood-shadows were on the handkerchief as he looked at it; the stains spread 

to his hands, as though they had just been employed upon a ruthless deed; the compartment in 

which he sat was throbbing with a silent life and death struggle, from which he emerged 

triumphant and free.  He was aroused by the stopping of the train at Beddington. He jumped out, 

with the account-books in his hands, and gazed defiantly around. No one challenged or 


_
hinges, the floor-boards loose. Past and gone were the idyls of which it had been the stage.  They 

turned to the left, through tangled box that wound hither and thither, until they stopped at a stone 

wall bordering a tree-arched lane. At the bottom of the lane was a glimpse of blue water.  Honora 

sat down on the wall with her back to a great trunk. Chiltern, with a hand on the stones, leaped 

over lightly, and stood for some moments in the lane, his Parksides. He heard a voice calling to 

him:  "Jeremiah! Jeremiah!"  The currents of his blood seemed to be suddenly arrested. Was he 

so soon discovered? Were they after him already?  "Jeremiah! Jeremiah!"  His mother, panting, 

laid her hand upon his shoulder. He shook her off violently, and was about to fly when he 

recognized her.  "How fast you walk, Jeremiah!" He glared at her, and raised his hand with the 

intention of striking her, but she caught 


_
hands behind his back.  What had Thalia been about to allow the message of that morning to 

creep into her comedy? a message announcing the coming of an intruder not in the play, in the 

person of a husband bearing gifts. What right had he, in the eternal essence of things, to return? 

He was out of all time and place. Such had been her feeling when she had first read the hastily 

written letter, but even when she had burned it it had risen again from the ashes. Anything but 

that! In trying not to think of it, she had picked up the newspaper, learned of a railroad accident,--

and shuddered. Anything but his return! Her marriage was a sin,--there could be no sacrament in 

it. She would flee first, and him.  "Well, then!" he said, suddenly. "What do you come running after 

a fellow like that for? Just as if--" He did not finish the sentence.  "Just as if what, Jeremiah?" 

asked Mrs. Pamflett.  "Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies," he replied. "How is it that you're 

here instead of at Parksides?"  "Miser Farebrother sent me with a message to the telegraph 

office."  "A telegram!" he cried, all his fears reviving. "To whom?"  "To you, telling you to come 

here without a moment's delay."  "Oh, the old thief wants me?"  "He wants you badly, Jeremiah!" 

"Does he? Was there nothing else in the telegram except that I was to come here without a 

moment's delay?"  "You were to bring the account-books."
