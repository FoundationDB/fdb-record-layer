and design they had accomplished in Hispaniola, where they committed the gr=
eat outrages and=20

iniquities narrated above.  They even added to them more notorious ones, an=
d the greatest=20

cruelty; slaying, burning, roasting, and, throwing the Indians to fierce do=
gs.  They oppressed,=20

tormented, and afflicted all those unhappy innocents in the mines, and with=
 other labours, until=20

they were consumed and destroyed, because there were in the said isles more=
 than a million=20

souls, and to-day there are not two hundred in each. All have perished with=
out faith and without=20

sacraments.                                 The Island of Cuba      1. In t=
he year 1511 the Spaniards passed=20

over to the island of Cuba,       (84) which as I said, is as long as from =
Valladolid to Rome, and=20

where there were great and populous provinces.  They began and ended       =
in the above manner,=20

only with incomparably greater cruelty. Here       many notable things occu=
rred.  2.2. A very high=20

prince and lord, named Hatuey, who had fled with many of       his people f=
rom Hispaniola to Cuba,=20

to escape the calamity and       inhuman operations of the Christians, havi=
ng received news from=20

some       Indians that the Christians were crossing over, assembled many o=
r       all of his people,=20

and addressed them thus.  3.3. "You already know that it is said the Christ=
ians are coming here;=20

and you have experience of how they have treated the lords so and so       =
and those people of=20

Hayti (which is Hispaniola); they come to do the       same here.  Do you k=
now perhaps why they=20

do it?"  The people       answered no; except that they were by nature crue=
l and wicked.       "They=20

do it," said he, "not alone for this, but because they have a       God who=
m they greatly adore and=20

love; and to make us adore Him they       strive to subjugate us and take o=
ur lives."  He had near=20

him a       basket full of gold and jewels and he said. "Behold here is the=
 God       of the Christians,=20

let us perform Areytos before Him, if you will       (these are dances in c=
oncert and singly); and=20

perhaps we shall       please Him, and He will command that they do us no h=
arm."  4.4. All=20

exclaimed; it is well! it is well! They danced before it, till       they w=
ere all tired, after which the lord=20

Hatuey said; "Note well       that in any event if we preserve the gold, th=
ey will finally have to       kill=20

us, to take it from us: let us throw it into this river." They       all ag=
reed to this proposal, and they=20

threw the gold into a great       river in that place.  5.5. This prince an=
d lord continued retreating=20

before the Christians when       they arrived at the island of Cuba, becaus=
e he knew them, but=20

when       he encountered them he defended himself; and at last they took h=
im.       And merely=20

because he fled from such iniquitous and cruel people,       and defended h=
imself against those=20

who wished to kill and oppress       him, with all his people and offspring=
 until death, they burnt him=20

alive.  6.6. When he was tied to the stake, a Franciscan monk, a holy man, =
who       was there,=20

spoke as much as he could to him, in the little time that       the executi=
oner granted them, about=20

God and some of the teachings of       our faith, of which he had never bef=
ore heard; he told him=20

that if       he would believe what was told him, he would go to heaven whe=
re       there was glory=20

and eternal rest; and if not, that he would go to       hell, to suffer per=
petual torments and=20

punishment.  After thinking a       little, Hatuey asked the monk whether t=
he Christians went to=20

heaven;       the monk answered that those who were good went there.  The p=
rince       at once=20

said, without any more thought, that he did not wish to go       there, but=
 rather to hell so as not to=20

be where Spaniards were, nor       to see such cruel people.  This is the r=
enown and honour, that=20

God       and our faith have acquired by means of the Christians who have g=
one       to the Indies.=20

7.7. On one occasion they came out ten leagues from a great settlement to  =
     meet us, bringing=20

provisions and gifts, and when we met them, they       gave us a great quan=
tity of fish and bread=20



and other victuals, with       everything they could supply.  All of a sudd=
en the devil entered       into=20

the bodies of the Christians, and in my presence they put to       the swor=
d, without any motive or=20

cause whatsoever, more than three       thousand persons, men, women, and c=
hildren, who were=20

seated before       us. Here I beheld such great cruelty as living man has =
never seen       nor=20

thought to see.  8.8. Once I sent messengers to all the lords of the provin=
ce of Havana,=20

assuring them that if they would not absent themselves but come to       re=
ceive us, no harm=20

should be done them; all the country was       terrorized because of the pa=
st slaughter, and I did=20

this by the       captain's advice.  When we arrived in the province, twent=
y-one       princes and=20

lords came to receive us; and at once the captain       violated the safe c=
onduct I had given them=20

and took them prisoners.       The following day he wished to burn them ali=
ve, saying it was better=20

so because those lords would some time or other do us harm.  I had       th=
e greatest difficulty to=20

deliver them from the flames but finally       I saved them.  9.9. After al=
l the Indians of this island=20

were reduced to servitude and       misfortune like those of Hispaniola, an=
d when they saw they=20

were all       perishing inevitably, some began to flee to the mountains; o=
thers to       hang=20

themselves in despair; husbands and wives hanged themselves,       together=
 with their children,=20

and through the cruelty of one very       tyrannical Spaniard whom I knew, =
more than two hundred=20

Indians       hanged themselves.  In this way numberless people perished. 1=
0.10. There was an=20

officer of the King in this island, to whose share       three hundred Indi=
ans fell; and by the end of=20

three months he had,       through labour in the mines, caused the death of=
 two hundred and=20

seventy; so that he had only thirty left, which was the tenth part.       T=
he authorities afterwards=20

gave him as many again, and again he       killed them: and they continued =
to give, and he to kill,=20

until he       came to die, and the devil carried away his soul. 11.11. In =
three or four months, I being=20

present, more than seven thousand       children died of hunger, their fath=
ers and mothers having=20

been taken       to the mines.  Other dreadful things did I see. 12.12. Aft=
erwards the Spaniards=20

resolved to go and hunt the Indians who       were in the mountains, where =
they perpetrated=20

marvellous massacres.       Thus they ruined and depopulated all this islan=
d which we beheld not=20

long ago; and it excites pity, and great anguish to see it deserted,       =
and reduced to a solitude.=20

The Mainland      1. In the year 1514 there passed over to the continent an=
 unhappy=20

Governor(85) who was the cruellest of tyrants, destitute of       compassio=
n or prudence, almost an=20

instrument of divine fury.  His       intention was to settle large numbers=
 of Spaniards in that=20

country.       And although several tyrants had visited the continent, and =
had       robbed and=20

scandalised many people, their stealing and ravaging had       been confine=
d to the sea-coast; but=20

this man surpassed all the       others who had gone before him, and those =
of all the Islands; and=20

his villainous operations outdid all the past abominations.  2.2. Not only =
did he depopulate the sea-

coast, but also countries and       large kingdoms where he killed numberle=
ss people, sending=20

them to       hell.  This man devastated many leagues of country extending =
above       Deldarien to=20

the kingdom and provinces of Nicaragua inclusive, which       is more than =
five hundred leagues; it=20

was the best, the happiest,       and the most populous land in the world. =
 There were very many=20

great       lords and numberless settlements, and very great wealth of gold=
: for       until that time,=20

never had there been so much seen above ground. For       although Spain ha=
d been almost filled=20

with gold from Hispaniola, and       that of the finest, it had been dug by=
 the labour of the Indians=20

from the bowels of the earth, out of the aforesaid mines, where, as       h=
as been said, they=20



perished.  3.3. This governor and his people invented new means of cruelty =
and of       torturing=20

the Indians, to force them to show, and give them gold.       There was a c=
aptain of his who, in an=20

incursion, ordered by him to       rob and extirpate the people, killed mor=
e than forty thousand=20

persons, putting them to the sword, burning them alive, throwing       them=
 to fierce dogs, and=20

torturing them with various kind of       tortures: these acts were witness=
ed by a Franciscan friar=20

with his       own eyes, for he went with the captain, and he was called Fr=
ay       Francisco de San=20

Roman.  4.4. The most pernicious blindness of those who have governed the I=
ndies       up to the=20

present day, in providing for the conversion and salvation       of these p=
eople, which (to tell the=20

truth) they have always       postponed, although with words they have repr=
esented and pretended=20

otherwise, reached such depths that they have commanded notice to be       =
given the Indians to=20

accept the Holy faith and render obedience to       the kings of Castile; o=
therwise war would be=20

made on them with fire       and blood, and they would be killed and made s=
laves etc.  5.5. As=20

though the Son of God, who died for each of them, had commanded       in hi=
s law, when he said=20

Euntes, docete omnes gentes that intimation       should be sent to peacefu=
l and quiet infidels, in=20

their own       countries, that, if they did not receive it at once, withou=
t other       teaching or=20

doctrine, and that if they did not subject themselves to       the dominion=
 of a king, of whom they=20

had never heard, nor seen, and       particularly whose messengers are so c=
ruel, so wicked, and=20

such       horrible tyrants, they should therefore, lose their rights, thei=
r       lands and liberty, their=20

wives and children, with all their lives;       such a blunder is stupid an=
d worthy of infamy, obloquy,=20

and hell.  6.6. This wretched and unhappy governor, in giving instructions =
as to the       said=20

intimations, the better to justify them--they being of       themselves uns=
eemly, unreasonable and=20

most unjust--commanded these       thieves sent by him, to act as follows: =
when they had=20

determined to       invade and plunder some province, where they had heard =
that gold was       to=20

be found, they should go when the Indians were in their towns,       and sa=
fe in their houses; these=20

wretched Spanish assassins went by       night and, halting at midnight hal=
f a league from the=20

town, they       published or read the said intimation among themselves say=
ing:       Princes and=20

Indians of such a place in this continent, we make known       unto you, th=
at there is one God, one=20

Pope, and one King of Castile,       who is Lord of this country; come at o=
nce to render him=20

obedience       etc. otherwise know that we shall make war on you, kill you=
, and put       you into=20

slavery etc.  And towards sunrise, the innocent natives       being still a=
sleep with their wives and=20

children, they attacked the       town, setting fire to the houses that wer=
e usually of straw, burning=20

the children, the women and many others alive, before they awoke.       The=
y killed whom they=20

would, and those whom they took alive, they       afterwards killed with to=
rtures, to force them to=20

indicate other       towns where there was gold, or more than was to be fou=
nd there; and       the=20

others that survived, they put into chains as slaves.  Then when       the =
fire was extinguished or=20

low they went to look for the gold that       was in the houses.  7.7. In t=
his way and with such=20

operations, were this wretched man and all       the bad Christians he took=
 with him occupied=20

during the year 1514,       till the year 1521 or 1522, sending on these ra=
ids six or more=20

servants, who collected for him a certain portion of all the gold       and=
 those readers who desire=20

to see the art of lacquer shown in its various stages, there is in the Bota=
nical Museum at Kew=20

Gardens a collection of specimens in various stages, including sections of =
the lacquer-tree, from=20

which the lac exudes, and of various coloured lacs, and examples illustrati=
ng no less than fifty=20



different methods of lacquering sword-sheaths.  An examination of lacquer w=
ork is to be found in=20

_Chinese Art_, vol. i, by Dr. Stephen W. Bushell, formerly physician to His=
 Majesty's Legation at=20

Peking. In the print-room of the Imperial Library at Paris is an album with=
 drawings of the=20

processes and explanatory notes.  The Lacquer Industry in Japan forms a Rep=
ort of His Majesty's=20

Acting-Consul at Hakodate (Mr. J. J. Quin), printed as a Parliamentary Pape=
r in 1882.  =3DIts Early=20

Introduction into this Country.=3D--At first the Portuguese had the monopol=
y of trade with the Far=20

East. When Philip of Spain annexed Portugal in 1598, he sought to shut out =
the Dutch traders=20

from participation in this trade. By this act he laid the foundation of the=
 Dutch East India Company.=20

It was only when Cornelius Houtman procured some Portuguese charts that the=
 Dutch navigators=20

first rounded the Cape _en route_ for India and China and Japan. The great =
Dutch East India=20

Company was established in 1602.  Porcelain and lacquered cabinets and boxe=
s were thus at an=20

early date distributed as rare articles of curious art at the beginning of =
the seventeenth century.=20

Drake and Raleigh had captured Spanish galleons with such treasure, and the=
 Portuguese=20

possession of Goa in India had brought the wealth of the Far East to Wester=
n Europe. Evelyn tells=20

us in his _Diary_, in 1681, of the richness of the apartments of the Duches=
s of Portsmouth at=20

Whitehall. "The very furniture of the chimney was massy silver. The sideboa=
rds were piled with=20

richly wrought plate. In the niches stood cabinets, the masterpieces of Jap=
anese art." The dowry=20

of Queen Catherine of Braganza did not come up to the expectations of the s=
pendthrift Charles,=20

although she came loaded with "japanned" boxes and rare artistic treasures =
from the East.=20

Memoirs of this time furnish abundant proof that lacquered work was, in pie=
ces of imported=20

furniture, known in this country. But it is little likely that anything of =
that nature was manufactured=20

here at that date. As a nation we had not developed on those lines; it is a=
 fact worth remembering=20

that as late as the reign of Charles II the greater part of the iron used i=
n this country was imported=20

from abroad.  =3D"The Chinese Taste."=3D--This is a term which finds itself=
 repeated like a parrot-cry=20

from the late years of the seventeenth century. The vogue reached its heigh=
t in 1750 as a fashion=20

for the wealthy and a pastime for the dilettanti, and disturbed the steady =
growth of national spirit in=20

art. There was a Chinese Festival at Drury Lane Theatre in 1755.  Chippenda=
le snatched his=20

fretwork in his brackets and the angles of his chairs from the Chinese work=
er in ebony. He erected=20

pagoda-like structures on his cabinets. The Bow china factory termed itself=
 "New Canton,"=20

Worcester copied Chinese models, Bristol carried on the story. Staffordshir=
e with her earthenware=20

brought out the "willow-pattern," and a hundred other designs were acclimat=
ized as reflections of=20

the blue and white Canton porcelain.  "Taste is at present the darling idol=
 of the polite world and=20

the world of letters, and, indeed, seems to be considered as the quintessen=
ce of almost all the arts=20

and sciences. The fine ladies and gentlemen dress with taste, the architect=
s, whether Gothic or=20

Chinese, build with taste." So writes the essayist in the _Connoisseur_ jou=
rnal in 1756, and he=20

continues ironically, "Whoever makes a pagoda of his parlour fits up his ho=
use entirely in taste."=20

This "Chinese taste" had seized France and Holland. The French artist-craft=
smen readily saw that=20

the great influx of Chinese and Japanese furniture would stifle their natio=
nal artistic impulses.=20

Louis Quatorze had to issue a decree at the end of the seventeenth century =
to prohibit the import=20

of Oriental wares. The craze reached England later and developed later. But=
 early in the=20

eighteenth century the cabinet-makers of London petitioned Parliament again=
st the importation of=20

manufactured articles from the East Indies to this country. But nothing muc=
h seems to have come=20



of their protest. The East India Company had become too powerful to brook i=
nterference with its=20

trade by interested artisans. Thousands of lac panels were brought over in =
the company's ships,=20

even in spite of the deep-rooted belief that lacquer work had at that time =
become an English art. It=20

is to be presumed that some of the contentions of the old European lacquer-=
workers may be said=20

to be parallel with the assertions of old potters who asseverated that they=
 had discovered the true=20

porcelain of China. In 1709 Boettger, at Meissen, had for the first time su=
cceeded in producing=20

white hard, paste porcelain, not in imitation of the Chinese, but actually =
a reproduction of the=20

Oriental technique. But the secret was well kept, and Boettger and his work=
men were imprisoned=20

in a fortress. Since Father Du Halde, the Jesuit, had published in Paris in=
 1725 his _Description de=20

l'Empire de la Chine_, other European potters had endeavoured to find the n=
atural earths of the=20

Chinese, kaolin and petuntse. When William Cookworthy, the chemist and pott=
er of Plymouth,=20

wrote of his discovery of the china clays, Josiah Wedgwood journeyed to Cor=
nwall on a wild-goose=20

chase.  It may be imagined, with data such as these to guide us--first, the=
 growing intensity of the=20

"Chinese taste"; second, the demand for furniture and porcelain on the part=
 of the wealthy classes-

-that as a consequence an attempt was made to supply the demand.  There wer=
e various sources=20

of supply for lacquered furniture, especially lacquered clock-cases. There =
was the Dutch market,=20

from which was obtained, as in the case of marquetry, panels of lacquered w=
ork. At first, without=20

doubt, these came from the East through Holland. The next stage was the Dut=
ch lacquered panel=20

actually produced in Holland. Later there was again the Oriental panel comi=
ng straight from the=20

East through our own East India Company. Contemporaneously with these impor=
tations, which=20

served as models, there was the lacquered work produced in this country. We=
 shall later attempt=20

to differentiate between these styles.  =3DColour versus Form.=3D--In vario=
us epochs the struggle has=20

gone on in the applied arts in regard to the use and abuse of colour in dec=
oration as an adjunct. In=20

furniture the pendulum has swung to and fro. Colour follows form in the pro=
cess of evolution. In=20

England there is the oak period and the walnut period, where the beauty is =
solely dependent upon=20

form. The conception of the cabinet-maker has usually been confined to form=
, eschewing colour,=20

or to colour more or less ignoring the beauty of form, or as a compromise, =
when form has been=20

subservient to colour. When form and colour are in exact harmony the highes=
t ideals are reached=20

in furniture. The Chinese have reached these ideals. The Italian school of =
the fifteenth century in=20

the marriage coffer, where painting or coloured intarsia is of parallel bea=
uty with the rich carving,=20

achieved like success. With similar judgment, in holding the balance evenly=
 between form and=20

colour, Andre Charles Boulle conceived his wonderful work in tortoiseshell =
and brass and ebony=20

and silver, forming a brilliant marquetry of colour, the colour effect bein=
g further heightened with a=20

reddish-brown and sometimes a bluish-green ground beneath the semi-transpar=
ent tortoiseshell.=20

Riesener and David Roentgen, in equally masterful technique, produced marqu=
etry of tulip-wood,=20

holly, rosewood, purple wood, and laburnum. With the style embodying the en=
richment of the plain=20

surface with colour came the use, and later the abuse, of lacquered panels.=
  A Dutch cabinet-

maker, Huygens, had won renown by reproducing remarkable imitations of the =
Japanese=20

lacquered panel. In Holland, Chinese prototypes had served as models for de=
lft ware. The Dutch=20

potter had simulated the appearance of blue and white Chinese porcelain, bu=
t his results were=20

obtained by a white enamel covering a brown body. Dutch lacquer work is sim=
ilarly imitative of the=20

results rather than a duplication of the Oriental processes. Chintzes and p=
rinted "callicoes" equally=20



are surprising efforts at simulation, if not dissimulation.  As a supreme e=
ffort of the successful=20

attempt of the European to reproduce the wonderful limpid transparency of t=
he old Chinese and=20

Japanese work, the secret of Sieur Simon Etienne Martin, a French carriage =
painter, stands=20

supreme. His varnish, called after him _Vernis-Martin_, has become the term=
, as in the case of=20

Boulle, for a certain class of technique. In 1744 he obtained the monopoly =
in France for the=20

manufacture of lacquered work in the Oriental style. He obtained the ground=
 of wavy golden=20

network, such as in rare Japanese panels, and on this Boucher and other art=
ists painted Arcadian=20

subjects.  In England it cannot be said that these great foreign styles hav=
e been emulated in the=20

grand manner or even attempted. When colour came to England it came straigh=
t from Holland,=20

and _le style refugie_ is responsible for the intermingling of the Dutch an=
d French styles, though=20

the former were at first greatly predominant. The important bureaus and spl=
endid lacquered=20

cabinets produced in the period when colour was employed so lavishly as to =
disregard form, are=20

attributable, not for the least part of their excellent technique in the sk=
ilful employment of lacquer,=20

to the great number of French and other foreign workmen who had settled in =
this country.=20

=3DPeculiarities of the Lacquered Clock-case.=3D--The use of the lacquered =
panel in the long case of=20

the clock cannot be said to have a definite period of its own. We cannot ma=
rk an exact date when=20

marquetry panels or marquetry "all-over" cases were no longer the vogue, an=
d when lacquered=20

cases succeeded them. The two styles were comparatively contemporaneous. Ma=
rquetry cases,=20

as we have seen, are as early as 1680, and they continued till about 1725, =
and later in the=20

provinces. The lacquered case may be said to have run its day from about 17=
00 to 1755. On the=20

whole they seemed to have had a longer vogue, mainly on account of the prev=
alence of the=20

"Chinese taste," which demanded colour. Lacquered decoration jumped the exp=
erimental stage of=20

reserves or panels that apparently were not quite in exact proportions to t=
he case, but had to be=20

fitted in and sometimes trimmed. It came at a juncture when this difficulty=
 had been mastered.=20

Accordingly, we find the whole of the lacquered case has been regarded as a=
 rectangular surface=20

to be decorated, and we have not met with any instance of more than one lac=
quered panel being=20

employed on the case. The marquetry case offered other features which indic=
ated the struggle of=20

colour for supremacy. In the early marquetry specimens the turned walnut pi=
llars of the hood=20

belong to an earlier style. They indicate that that form had not been compl=
etely ousted. The=20

marquetry worker in the end overcame this and drove these pillars out. In t=
he lacquered case no=20

such struggle is visible. The case is entirely a scheme in colour. It is re=
d, or green, it is black and=20

gold, but the design is never so strong as to tempt one to examine its form=
. It is simply decorative,=20

but much in the manner that, in textile art, tapestry is pleasing, not chal=
lenging a critical=20

examination of form, but suggesting a somnolent restfulness.  Touches of in=
congruity appear in=20

later examples of the lacquered clock-case when the arched hood came into f=
ashion and the panel=20

followed suit. It is a shape unsuited to an Oriental design. Such a Western=
 architectural style used=20

in combination with so Eastern a technique as lacquered work is like puttin=
g a Corinthian pillar on=20

a Japanese bronze.  The lacquered cases illustrated in this chapter indicat=
e the style. The=20

example with the movement by Joseph Dudds (1766-82), (illustrated p. 115), =
shows the early=20

attempt to simulate the Eastern style. It is poor and thin,=20


_
captured, besides the share that belonged to him as Captain General.       =
The officers of the king=20

did the same, each sending as many boys or       servants as he could.  And=
 also the first bishop of=20

that kingdom       sent his servants to obtain part of this profit.  9.8. A=
s far as I can judge they stole,=20

during that time in the said       kingdom, more gold than a million crowns=
; and I believe I=20

understate       it; and it will not be found that, of all they stole, they=
 sent the       King more than=20

three thousand crowns.  And they destroyed more than       eight hundred th=
ousand souls.  The=20

other tyrant governors who       succeeded them till the year 1533 killed, =
and allowed to be killed=20

the survivors with the tyrannical servitude that followed the war. 10.9. Am=
ong the other=20

numberless knaveries he committed and permitted       during the time he go=
verned, was this one;=20

a prince, or lord, having       of his own will, or more likely out of fear=
, given him nine thousand=20

crowns, he was not satisfied with this sum so he took the said lord,       =
bound him seated to a=20

stake, with his feet distended and exposed to       fire, to force him to g=
ive them a larger quantity of=20

gold; and he       [the chief] sent to his house and brought other three th=
ousand       crowns; they=20

tortured him again, and as he gave no more gold, either       because he ha=
d none or did not wish=20

to give it, they kept him thus,       till the marrow oozed out from the so=
les of his feet; and thus he=20

died.  Numberless times they killed and tortured lords in this way       to=
 get gold from them. 11.10.=20

Another time a company of Spaniards, while going to assassinate,       came=
 to a mountain where=20

a great number of people were sheltered and       in hiding, to escape from=
 the pestilential and=20

horrible operations       of the Christians; assaulting it unexpectedly the=
y captured seventy       or=20

eighty young girls and women; and left many dead whom they had       killed=
. 12.11. The next day=20

many Indians  The specimen (illustrated p. 117), with the movement by Kenne=
th Maclellan (1760-

80), is of more grandiose character. The panelled door was probably an impo=
rtation, and the other=20

decorations in lacquer done in this country.  Among the Scottish clocks, th=
e Patrick Gordon=20

example (1705-15), (illustrated p. 263), proves this usage of imported Orie=
ntal panel with added=20

decoration in as near a style as could be done on the spot. In this example=
 the remainder of the=20

so-called lacquered decoration is stencilled.  [Illustration: LONG-CASE CLO=

red work was as=20

prevalent between 1680 and 1725 as was Dutch marquetry. The rivalry between=
 "John Company"=20

and the Dutch traders was one factor that has to be considered. Lacquered w=
ork was coming=20

straight from the East to Amsterdam and to English ports. What was not abso=
rbed by the Dutch=20

burghers came to England. Apart from this competitive Oriental trade, there=
 was the lacquered=20

work actually made in Holland. In examining the state of that country at th=
is time one meets with a=20

surprise. It was a land teeming with colour. Dutch painters have taught us =
to think otherwise. The=20

Rijks Museum exhibits the prevalent styles of the seventeenth century. Here=
 we find leather=20

decorations derivative from Spain in rich gilding, Louis Quatorze boudoirs =
with classic gods and=20

goddesses. The "Chinese Boudoir" from the palace of the Stadtholder at Leeu=
warden shows the=20

intense love of colour that had conquered Holland in the late seventeenth c=
entury. Here we find=20

the Chinese prototypes in porcelain which provided the potters at Delft wit=
h problems to solve, and=20

lacquered work which suggested patient imitation by Dutch=20


_
driven by their anxiety for their wives and daughters to fight; and       t=
he Christians finding=20

themselves at close quarters, and not wishing       to disorder their compa=
ny of horse, drove their=20

swords into the       bodies of the young girls and women, and of all the e=
ighty they left       not=20

even one alive.  The Indians writhing with grief cried out, and       said:=
 "O wretched men, cruel=20

Christians, you kill Iras!" (the women       in that country are called Ira=
s).  They meant that to kill=20

women is       a sign of abominable, cruel and bestial men. 13.12. Ten or f=
ifteen leagues from=20

Panama there was a great lord called       Paris, who had great wealth of g=
old.  The Christians=20

went thither       and he received them as though they were his brothers: h=
e willingly       presented=20

the captain with fifty thousand castellanos.  It seemed to       the captai=
n and to the Christians that=20

one who spontaneously gave       that quantity, must have a great treasure;=
 which was the aim and=20

recompense of their effort.  They dissimulated, saying they wished       to=
 depart: towards sunrise=20

they returned and attacked the       unsuspecting town; and they set fire t=
o it and burnt it.  They=20

killed and burnt many people, and stole other fifty or sixty       thousand=
 castellanos, and the=20

prince, or lord fled to escape death       or capture. 14.13. He quickly as=
sembled all the people he=20

could, and in two or three       days came upon the Christians, who were ca=
rrying away his=20

hundred       and thirty or forty (86) thousand castellanos, and fell upon =
them       manfully, killing=20

fifty Christians, recapturing all the gold while       the others escaped b=
adly wounded. 15.14.=20

Afterwards, many Christians turned on the said lord and destroyed       him=
 and many of his=20

people; they killed the rest with the usual       servitude, so that to-day=
 there is neither sign nor any=20

vestige       whatsoever that there was ever a town or born man where forme=
rly was       thirty=20

leagues of dominion well populated.  The murders and       destruction done=
 by that miserable man=20

and his company in that       kingdom which he devastated, are without numb=
er.=20

The Province of Nicaragua      1. In the year 1522 or 1523 this same tyrant=
 invaded the most=20

delightful province of Nicaragua to subjugate it; it was an unlucky       h=
our when he entered it.=20

Who could adequately set forth the       happiness, healthfulness, agreeabl=
eness, prosperity, and=20

the number       of dwellings and concourse of the people that were there? =
it was       truly a=20

marvellous thing to see how full it was of towns, stretching       for a le=
ngth of nearly three or four=20

leagues, thickly planted with       the most marvellous fruit trees; which =
was the reason that there=20

was       such an immense population.  2.2. So much injury and assassinatio=
n, so much cruelty,=20

wickedness and       injustice, was done to those people by that tyrant, to=
gether with       the=20

others, his companions, that human language would not suffice to       rela=
te it; for he was=20

accompanied by all those who had helped to       destroy all the other king=
dom.  The land being flat=20

and open, the       natives could not hide in the mountains, and their coun=
try was so       delightful,=20

that it was with difficulty and great grief that they       Oriental origin=
als must have confounded the=20

old craftsmen.  The potter simulated the porcelain with his enamelled earth=
enware, the cabinet-

maker produced lacquered work which passed muster in Holland and England. T=
ake the house of=20

the rich burgher. The table was covered with an Eastern rug, called a "tabl=
e carpet." The linen=20

cupboards so beloved by the Dutch were surmounted by Chinese and Japanese p=
orcelain. Often=20

a Japanese lac cabinet gave another touch of colour to the interior. Rich d=
amask curtains, Spanish=20

leather hangings, Oriental rugs, finely inlaid cabinets of ebony and silver=
, and a glowing array of=20

copper and brass, filled the heart of the Dutch _vrouw_ with pride. Such ro=
oms were regarded as=20

a "holy of holies," and the family had their meals in the kitchen or living=
 room and were warned off=20



the show room. The seventeenth-century Dutchwoman, according to all account=
s, seems to have=20

been a shrew. But enough is extant to prove that Holland was artistically, =
in regard to the home-life=20

of Stadtholder and burgher, resplendent with colour, in spite of the low to=
nes of the canvases of=20

Dutch painters.  In England, too, the love of colour was becoming predomina=
nt. Fifty thousand=20

Huguenot families, with their Latin blood and love of colour, scattered in =
the Protestant countries=20

had no inconsiderable influence. Spitalfields silk is as English as the dar=
k and tortuous lanes from=20

which it emanates. But every weaver had a French name, and although the ind=
ustry has come to=20

an end, tomorrow, if the demand arose, the descendants of these French Hugu=
enots would again=20

stand at the looms to produce English silk.  The sudden outburst of colour =
in the now rarely prized=20

English lacquered cabinets and bureaus must be attributed to the foreign wo=
rkmen in our midst at=20

the close of the seventeenth century. It is English perforce, because it wa=
s made in England. The=20

followers of Huygens the Dutchman and the disciples of Martin the Frenchman=
 were capable of=20

producing something new and something surprising in English cabinet work. T=
he foreign quarters=20

of London have always been the centre of art industry. Armenians sit on the=
 roofs of fashionable=20

West End emporiums and restore carpets and rugs. Polish and Russian furrier=
s travel by the Tube=20

from Whitechapel and Bethnal Green, from the Commercial Road and Shoreditch=
 to Regent Street=20

and Bond Street with their handiwork. What is now, was two hundred and fift=
y years ago. Alien=20

craftsmen, more skilled than the English workmen, worked for less wages and=
 produced better=20

work.  The English style, therefore, of the late seventeenth century in lac=
quered work was as=20

English as the work of Daniel Marot the Frenchman and of Grinling Gibbons t=
he Dutch woodcarver=20

at Hampton Court.  The English style is praised as something fine and origi=
nal as a European=20

replica of the Oriental. So it is. It is the French grafted on to the Dutch=
 and acclimatized here. It=20

holds the same place in lacquered work as the Dutch delft ware does in cera=
mics. It is a splendid=20

imitation of a technique not grasped by the imitator. Lovers of lacquered r=
arities and collectors of=20

the so-called English style, so rare and so much extolled, can take it to h=
eart that it is really=20

English--as English as the canvases of Vandyck or the painted panels of per=
golesi.  =3DEnglish=20

Amateur Imitators.=3D--There are=20


_
will suffer great persecutions, and they tolerated the tyranny and       th=
e slavery of the Christians=20

to the extent of their endurance, and       because they are naturally a ve=
ry humble and pacific=20

people.  3.3. He sent fifty mounted soldiers, and had the inhabitants of a =
whole       province, larger=20

than the country of Rusenon(87) killed with lances,       without leaving m=
an nor woman, old nor=20

young alive.  He did this for       a very trifling reason; such as because=
 they did not come as soon=20

as       he called them, or because they did not bring him enough loads of =
      maize, (which is the=20

grain of that country) or enough Indians to       serve him or some other o=
f his company: the land=20

being flat, no one       could escape from their horses and from their infe=
rnal wrath.  4.4. He sent=20

some Spaniards to invade other provinces, which means to go       and murde=
r the Indians; and he=20

let the assassins bring away as many       Indians as they pleased from the=
 peaceful settlements,=20

to serve       them; they put these Indians in chains so that they should n=
ot set       down the loads=20

weighing three arobas that they bound on their backs.       And it happened=
 sometimes out of the=20

many times he did it, that out       of four thousand Indians, not six indi=
viduals returned alive to=20

their homes, because they were left dead by the way.  5.5. And when some be=
came tired, or lame=20

on account of the great weights,       or fell ill through hunger, fatigue =
and weakness, they cut off=20

their       heads at the neck so as not to loosen them from their chains, a=
nd       the head fell to one=20

side, and the body to the other.  It may be       imagined how their compan=
ions would feel.  When=20

orders were given       for similar expeditions, the Indians, knowing from =
experience that       none=20

who started ever returned, went weeping, and sighing, and       saying: "Th=
ose are the roads, we=20

trod to serve the Christians; and       although we laboured hard, we final=
ly returned after some=20

time to       our own homes and to our wives and children; but now we go wi=
thout       hope of ever=20

returning, nor of seeing them again, or of having life       any more."  6.=
6. Once, because it suited=20

his inclination to make a new distribution       of Indians, and also, they=
 say, to take them from his=20

enemies and       give them to his friends, the Indians were unable to that=
 the art of lacquer had=20

appealed to the amateur on account of its apparent simplicity. It is ludicr=
ous to read of the=20

attempts of seventeenth-century teachers of the art of "japanning" to young=
 ladies. The=20

seventeenth-century "miss," according to old memoirs, left her Stuart stump=
 needlework, with its=20

quaint costume and crude figures, to simulate the subtle art of the Chinese=
 or Japanese lacquer-

worker. At that time the greatest coach-panel painter could not have approa=
ched the finesse of the=20

lacquered work coming from the East. In spite of Stalker and Parker in 1688=
, with their treatise=20

how to produce lacquered "japanning" in the Oriental style--a guide for ama=
teurs and the standard=20

work for all the academies that taught this new accomplishment--we cannot b=
elieve much of this=20

amateur work found its way on clock-cases, which in point of time heralded =
the oncoming burst of=20

colour. It is incredible that all of a sudden, following the clock-case and=
 the chair-back, fine red and=20

green and black and gold lac decoration, as exhibited by rich cabinets and =
gorgeous bureaus=20

scintillating with colour, could have succeeded the stump-work amateurs. St=
alker and company=20

must go by the board as caterers for a very amateur taste. Their book possi=
bly never reached the=20

trade, or if it did, it could have had very little influence upon adept ref=
ugees practising a subtle art.=20

=3DPainted Furniture not Lacquered Work.=3D--Whatever may be determined as =
to the merits of=20

_Vernis-Martin_ or of the creations of Huygens the Dutchman in regard to co=
mparison with=20

Chinese and Japanese prototypes, it is certain that English amateur work, w=
hich is often dull gold=20

design on a black ground, is not only an echo but a feeble echo of the orig=
inal. They are splendid=20



examples of dulness. Pepys complains that women wore feathers in his day. T=
he feminine instinct=20

is difficult to reckon with. Some years ago very up-to-date young wives "as=
pinalled" everything=20

pea-green or peacock-blue. They did a lot of damage. Similarly, in the seve=
nteenth century, when=20

the boudoir escaped from needlework into lacquer, much otherwise harmless f=
urniture must have=20

been spoilt. Hundreds of fine pieces of furniture were brought up to date b=
y the simple process of=20

painting them and simulating the Chinese lacquered work. In the Early Victo=
rian age of graining,=20

sapient workmen painted solid oak panels and=20


_
crops; and as bread ran short, the Christians took from the Indians       a=
ll the maize they had to=20

maintain themselves and their children; in       consequence more than twen=
ty or thirty thousand=20

souls died of       hunger; and it happened, that a certain woman was drive=
n by hunger       to kill=20

her own son for food.  7.7. As each of the towns was a very pleasing garden=
, as has been said,=20

the they had painted. Folly is not the monopoly of any age. It is eternal. =
To-day the framer, if he is=20

not watched and carefully instructed, glues a fine engraving to a sheet of =
cardboard and rubs a=20

wet cloth over the surface of the print, destroying its beauty for ever wit=
h his clod-like smudge.=20

Fools are ever present to confound the conservation of art treasures.  Pain=
