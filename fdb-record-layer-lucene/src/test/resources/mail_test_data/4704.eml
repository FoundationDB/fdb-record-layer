philodendron monstera walk, Ned re-entered the school-house.  Franks shook =
his head sadly. "The poor arm has been taken off," he replied; "they could =
not save it. She has passed a very bad night, but there are good hopes that=
 she may recover. Poor Sands,--poor fellow! 'twill be a terrible blow to hi=

"Do you know that _
It was not till the chaise had disappeared from his view, that Ned Franks h=
ad leisure to think of=20

himself. He felt sick and faint, and thankfully took the glass of hot brand=
y and water that was=20

brought to him by one of his boys, but he declined the offer of the miller =
to come in and warm and=20

dry himself at his fire, and change his dripping clothes.  "Thanks to you a=
ll the same, Bat Bell, but=20

a quick walk home will heat my blood, and Persis will soon set all to right=
s with me," said the=20

sailor, as he shook the drops from his curly brown hair. "I've got no real =
hurt, thank God! I wish we=20

could say as much for poor Nancy. Sands will have a sad coming home all alo=

spoken, it would be beyond his power to prevent matters from taking their o=

independent of my decisions and his actions.  I believed now that what I ha=

was "bluffing." He wanted me to flounder into some admission, and to make h=

ion of Ben Stone, when=20

he heard of what had happened to Nancy. "She was walking into something wor=
se than a mill-

stream with her eyes wide open; Providence stopped her, when man could not =
stop her. There are=20

worse evils than a plunge into a mill-stream, or even a broken arm."  Frank=
s rose the next morning=20

before sunrise, that he might have time to go to the town for news of Nancy=
 before his scholars=20

met. All during the night the frightful scene of the preceding evening had =
disturbed him in his=20

sleep, and he had repeatedly awoke with a start, fancying that he was dragg=
ing the shrieking=20

Nancy from under the wheel.  Persis anxiously awaited her husband's return =
from the hospital.=20

"Have you seen Nancy?" she eagerly asked, imagined me writhing at the alter=
native of giving up=20

be sure what I would=20

do in the end.  "Well?" he said at last, quite gently.  My eyes had been be=

point upward slightly at the ends. But to my fancy he looked absolutely dev=
ilish at that moment.=20

Still, I was less afraid of him than I had been since the day I stole the t=

"I think it's time that you left me now."  "That's your answer? You=20
