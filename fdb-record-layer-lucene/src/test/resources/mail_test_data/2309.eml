dracaena marginata vessel, they were overtaken by a furious storm and such =
continued bad weather that, after many days of misery and danger, the ship =
was obliged to put back, and they found themselves again at their port of e=
mbarkation.  Their journey to Peru being thus dracaena marginata vessel, th=
ey were overtaken by a furious storm and such continued bad weather that, a=
fter many days of misery and danger, the ship was obliged to put back, and =
they found themselves again at their port of embarkation.  Their journey to=
 Peru being thus _
Enrique, he fulfilled his mission as much to the astonishment as to the sat=
isfaction of everybody.=20

The Spanish historian Quintana rejects the account of these events which is=
 given by Remesal=20

and has ever since been accepted by historians as authentic, declaring it t=
o be fabulous, and=20

limiting the part Las Casas played in the affair of Enrique to a visit he p=
aid him after peace was=20

concluded.  Remesal bases his narrative on documents which he declares he f=
ound in the=20

archives of the Audiencia of Guatemala, and there seems no sufficient motiv=
e for doubting the=20

veracity of the evidence.  Las Casas, in describing what took place in the =
early part of the troubles=20

with Enrique (1520), does not say positively that he took part in the first=
 negotiations for peace, but=20

he does clearly give it to be understood that the successful issue of the f=
inal efforts was owing to=20

his intervention. A detailed account of the conclusion of the rebellion wou=
ld, according to the=20

system adopted in writing his _History_, find its rightful place in the fou=
rth book, which is missing,=20

though there is little room for doubt that it was written and may possibly =
still be discovered.=20

Concerning the journey which--according to Remesal--Las Casas made to Spain=
 in 1530, very=20

little is known, and Quintana is as sceptical about this voyage as about th=
e part attributed to him=20

by some biographers in Enrique's subjugation, though there seems as little =
reason in this instance=20

to doubt the explicit statement of one whose good faith is as far above sus=
picion as his=20

opportunities for knowing the facts were exceptional.  Torquemada represent=
s Fray Juan=20

Zumarraga, the first Bishop of Mexico, as visiting Spain in 1532, and as ha=
ving previously written=20

asking that the colonists should be prohibited from enslaving the Indians, =
and that during that time=20

identical representations had been made to the government by the Bishop of =
Chiapa, Don=20

Bartolome de Las Casas, (42) which procured letters patent from the Empress=
-Regent signed in=20

1530, before the bishop of Mexico arrived. (43) The scepticism of Quintana =
seems hardly justified.=20

The occasion of the alleged journey was the recent discovery and conquest o=
f Peru by Francisco=20

Pizarro and Diego de Almagro.  The fate of these millions of people, newly =
subjected to the=20

Castilian crown could not have been a matter of indifference to Las Casas. =
 They stood far higher=20

in the scale of civilisation than the naked islanders, possessing as they d=
id, as great an empire as=20

the Mexicans, with religion, laws, and literature of a high order of develo=
pment.  While the=20

entrance of Las Casas into a monastic order was, in one sense, a retirement=
 from the world, he=20

had chosen a community whose members were as devoted to the defence of the =
Indians as he=20

himself was, and while he had, when still a secular priest, sustained a sto=
ut fight, unaided save by=20

such friends as chance and his own efforts might here and there secure him,=
 he could, after his=20

profession, count upon the moral and active support of one of the most powe=
rful religious=20

organisations of the age.  His retirement, therefore, proved to be a period=
 of refreshment, during=20

which he reinforced his powers for continuing his propaganda and, while los=
ing nothing of his=20

original enthusiasm and determination, he returned to the scene of his form=
er activity with=20

renewed courage and a great religious Order at his back.  Determined as he =
was to forestall a=20

repetition in Peru of the exterminating cruelties perpetrated in the island=
s, he returned to Court in=20

his Dominican habit, where he preached several times with great success.  T=
he gift of eloquence=20

he had always possessed, and his eight years of study and meditation had fu=
rnished him with new=20

weapons, which he wielded with the same fiery zeal that had characterised t=
he first years of his=20

apostolic championship.  During the six months he remained in Spain, he obt=
ained a royal cedula=20

to be delivered to Pizarro and Almagro, positively prohibiting the enslavem=
ent of any of the natives=20



of Peru for any reason, or in any manner whatsoever, as they were declared =
to be the free vassals=20

of the King, and as much entitled to the possession of their liberty and pr=
operty as were the=20

natives of Castile itself.  The obnoxious Bishop of Burgos had long since f=
allen into disgrace and=20

was dead, so that Las Casas was free to carry on his negotiations with the =
India Council without=20

encountering at every step the obstacles and delays his old enemy had forme=
rly opposed to his=20

projects.  During his absence in Spain, the first provincial chapter of the=
 Dominicans had been=20

held in Hispaniola, and on his return there he learned that the monastery o=
f San Domingo in=20

Mexico had been designated as the chief house of the province, with Fray Fr=
ancisco de San=20

Miguel as the first Prior. Las Casas, in company with other friars embarked=
 with the new Prior for=20

Mexico, his own destination being Peru, where he had not only to deliver th=
e royal cedula he had=20

secured, but also to found some convents in those regions.  The friars in M=
exico did not welcome=20

their new Prior as cordially as they might have done, but Fray Bartholomew,=
 ever ready to=20

exercise his powers of universal peace-maker, smoothed the difficulties, af=
ter which he left for=20

Peru early in 1532, accompanied by Fray Bernardino de Minaya and Fray Pedro=
 de Angulo. (44)=20

As their port of embarkation was Realejo in Nicaragua, they passed through =
Santiago de=20

Guatemala where they lodged in the abandoned convent of San Domingo.  As so=
on as the news=20

of their arrival spread, the whole town came eagerly to see them; the enthu=
siasm of the=20

inhabitants was somewhat dampened when they learned that Las Casas was one =
of the three, for=20

he had earned a terrible fame amongst slave-dealing Spaniards and whenever =
he appeared, was=20

apt to produce royal cedulas of embarrassing purport or, at least, to denou=
nce and report to Spain=20

the violence and cruelties commonly practised on the Indians.  The friars' =
stay at Santiago was=20

brief, in spite of the urgent entreaties of the priest there, who begged th=
em to remain and to=20

reopen the deserted monastery, as the field for spiritual labours was a bro=
ad and uncultivated one.=20

Fray Bartholomew was anxious, however, to reach his destination, knowing fr=
om past experiences=20

how much easier it is to forestall an evil than to remedy a rooted abuse. H=
e rightly judged that=20

whatever good was to be accomplished by virtue of the royal cedula he carri=
ed, must be achieved=20

before the conquerors of Peru had time to enslave the Indians and to establ=
ish a system similar to=20

those that had worked such damage in the Islands and in Mexico.  They were =
obliged to wait=20

twenty-four days at Realejo until a ship which was to carry reinforcements =
and stores to Pizarro=20

and Almagro was ready to sail; meanwhile the three monks, under the exterio=
r guise of the gentle=20

dove, were obliged to use some of the wisdom of the serpent and to carefull=
y conceal the nature=20

of their mission, for otherwise the ship-owners, whose chief article of com=
merce was slaves, would=20

never have taken them on board.  Upon their arrival in Peru, Las Casas imme=
diately=20

communicated the purport of the cedula to the Spanish commanders.  Both Alm=
agro and Pizarro=20

protested that they would obey the order to the letter, though it went sore=
ly against their interests.=20

They ordered the royal command to be solemnly published with the usual form=
alities and even=20

added other penalties to those prescribed, for any violation of its provisi=
ons.  This part of his=20

mission accomplished, it remained for Fray Bartholomew and his companions t=
o take steps to=20

found religious houses as their superior had ordered, but after consultatio=
n with the Bishop of=20

those parts, Fray Vicente de Valverde, it was decided that such foundations=
 would be premature,=20

since the country was only half subdued and a continuous state of warfare s=
till prevailed.  Their=20

return to Mexico was therefore agreed upon and, together with a number of S=
paniards who were=20



disappointed with their prospects in Peru, the three friars left for Panama=
 whence they sailed for=20

Realejo, where they arrived down on Trolley=E2=80=99s soft fur.  =E2=80=9CW=
hat am I to do without my little candle?=E2=80=9D=20

her grandfather asked.  =E2=80=9CWhy you can have the cat,=E2=80=9D Caro an=
swered merrily.  No wonder Trolley=E2=80=99s=20

mind was disturbed that morning with such a coming and going as went on,--p=
eople running in to=20

say goodby, and Aunt Charlotte thinking every few minutes of something new =
for the traveler=E2=80=99s=20

lunch, tickling his nose with tantalizing odors of tongue and chicken.  It =
was over at last, trunks and=20

bags were sent off, Aunt Charlotte was hugged and kissed and then Trolley h=
ad his turn, and the=20

procession moved, headed by the president.  =E2=80=9CGoodby Trolley; don=E2=
=80=99t forget me!=E2=80=9D Caro called,=20

walking backwards and waving her handkerchief.  When they were out of sight=
 Trolley went and=20

sat on the gate-post and thought about it. After a while he jumped down and=
 trotted across the=20

campus with a businesslike air as if he had come to an important decision. =
He took his way=20

through the Barrows=E2=80=99 orchard to the Grayson garden where there was =
now a well-trodden path=20

through the snow.  Miss Grayson and her brother were sitting in the library=
. They had been talking=20

about Caro when Walter glancing toward the window saw a pair of golden eyes=
 peering in at him.=20

=E2=80=9CThere is Trolley,=E2=80=9D he said, and called Thompson to let him=
 in.  Trolley entered as if he was sure of=20

a welcome, and walking straight to Miss Elizabeth, sprang into her lap; and=
 from this on he=20

became a frequent visitor at the Graysons, dividing his time in fact about =
evenly between his two=20

homes.  And thus an unfortunate quarrel which had disturbed the peaceful at=
mosphere of=20

Charmington and separated old friends, was forgotten, and as the president =
often remarked, it was=20

all owing to the candle and the cat.   THE END.      End of Project Gutenbe=

of 1532.  The Bishop of Nicaragua, who at that time was Don Diego Alvarez O=
sorio, had been=20

instructed by the Emperor to establish Dominican convents in his diocese, a=
nd the arrival of the=20

friars afforded him the first opportunity that had presented itself to obey=
 the royal commands.  A=20

convent was therefore established with the customary ceremonies at Leon, th=
e seat of the Bishop,=20

and was dedicated to St. Paul.  The friars set themselves to work to learn =
the language of the=20

natives, which was not difficult for Pedro de Angulo, since he already knew=
 the Mexican tongue,=20

whose similarity rendered intelligible communication with the Indians easy =
from the outset.  While=20

engaged in the apostolic labour of teaching and converting the natives who =
were eager to become=20

Christians, Las Casas received a letter from the licentiate Cerrato, who ha=
d succeeded the Bishop=20

Don Sebastian de Fuenleal as President of the Audiencia in Hispaniola on th=
e transference of the=20

latter to Mexico, urging him to return forthwith, as his presence was neces=
sary for the service of=20

God and the Emperor.  Money for the expenses of the journey accompanied thi=
s communication,=20

the nature of which left its recipient no choice but to obey, so leaving th=
e work of conversions that=20

had so favourably begun to the care of the friars who had returned with him=
 from Peru, Fray=20

Bartholomew and Fray Pedro de Angulo set out on their long journey by way o=
f Honduras, where=20

a ship might be found either at the port of Trujillo or that of Caballos.  =
Upon his arrival at Santo=20

Domingo, where he was cordially received by the President, Cerrato though h=
is presence was=20

never a source of tranquillity to the slave-dealing colonists, Las Casas le=
arned that the principal=20

reason for recalling him, was the President's desire to establish a surer p=
eace with the cacique=20

Enrique; although the latter had made no attack on the Spaniards since the =
agreement of 1529, he=20

had not disbanded his followers, but remained in an inaccessible mountain f=
astness, a permanent=20

source of unrest to the Spaniards with whom he showed no intention of enter=
ing into closer=20

relations.  No mission could have been more to Fray Bartholomew's liking, f=
or he was ever eager=20

to prove the truth of his perpetual thesis that the Indians were reasonable=
, peaceable people who,=20

if treated humanely would readily embrace civilisation and Christianity.  M=
aking his usual condition=20

that no force should be used, and accompanied only by his faithful companio=
