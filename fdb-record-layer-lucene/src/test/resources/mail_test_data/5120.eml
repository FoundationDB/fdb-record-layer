no denial," muttered the man between his teeth.  Mr Sparks observed that one of the lower 

windows was open, which was not to be wondered at, for the weather was rather warm at the 

time.  He also observed that the curtains of the window were made of white flowered muslin, and

and Redistributing couple of candles which stood on a small table.  There was no one in the room 

at the time.  "Strange," muttered Mr Sparks, with a grim smile, "that people _will_ leave lights so 

near muslin curtains!"  Most ordinary people would have thought the candles in question at a 



sufficiently safe distance from the curtains, but Mr Sparks apparently thought otherwise.  He 

entertained peculiar views about the danger of fire.  From the position which the two boys 

occupied they could not see the man while he was thus engaged in examining and commenting on 

Number 6, Conway Street, but they saw him quite well when he crossed the street, (which had 

only one side to it, a wall occupying the other), and they saw him still better in the course of a few 

seconds when a bright light suddenly streamed towards him, and illumined his villainous 

countenance, and they heard as well as saw him, the next instant, when he shouted "_fire--fire_!" 

and rushed frantically away.  "Hallo!" exclaimed the Bloater, and dashed off at full speed.  Little 

Jim echoed the sentiment and followed.  Robert, alias Raw Herring, was a sharp-witted lad.  He 

understood the case, (partly at least), in a moment, and proceeded to appropriate action.  Being 

intimately acquainted with that part of London, he took a short cut, overshot Mr Sparks, and was 

first to give the alarm at the fire-station.  When, therefore, Mr Sparks ran in, panting and shouting 

"fire!" great was his surprise to find the men already roused, and the horses being attached to the 

engine.  "Where away?" inquired one of the firemen, supposing that Sparks, perhaps, brought 

information of another fire.  "Number 6, Conway Street," he gasped.  "All right, we've got the noos 

already.  The boys brought it."  The Bloater, with a mouth extending from ear to ear and all his 

teeth displayed, uttered the single word "sold!" as Mr Sparks turned his eyes on him.  One glance 

was enough.  The man became very pale, and suddenly left the station amid a shout of laughter 

from the firemen, as they leaped on the engine and drove away, followed by the two boys whose 

spirits were already excited to the highest pitch of ecstasy by a fire.  It was early morning before 

the fire was subdued, and Number 6 left the blackened skeleton of a house.  Long before that, the 

Bloater and Little Jim had sought repose in the cart-shed of a neighbouring stable.  Long before 

that Mr Philip Sparks had retired to rest, growling anathemas on the heads of boys in general, and 

crossing-sweepers in particular; and not _very_ long before that poor Martha Reading had put in 

the last stitch of her work, and fallen into a profound sleep in her chair.  Mr Sparks turned out to be 

a true prophet.  Mrs Middleton did _not_ insist on having her dress home that afternoon, and when 

Martha, true to her promise, conveyed it to Number 6, Conway Street, she found no one there to 

receive it except a few drenched men of the Red Brigade, and the police.    CHAPTER FIVE.  Mr 

Philip Sparks, though not naturally fond of society, was, nevertheless, obliged to mingle 

occasionally with that unpleasant body, for the purpose of recruiting his finances.  He would rather 

have remained at home and enjoyed his pipe and beer in solitude, but that was not possible in the 

circumstances.  Owing, no doubt, to the selfishness of the age in which he lived, people would 

_not_ go and pour money into his pockets, entreat him to accept of the same, and then retire 

without giving him any farther trouble.  On the contrary, even when he went out and took a great 

deal of trouble to obtain money--much more trouble than he would have had to take, had he been 

an honest working man--people refused to give it to him, but freely gave him a good deal of 

gratuitous advice

electronic works  1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, 

you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and 

intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all the terms 

of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm 

electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee for which, in many instances, are said to be 

more numerous than ha'pence.  Things in general being in this untoward condition, Mr Sparks 

went out one morning and entered into society.  Society did not regard him with a favourable eye, 

but Sparks was not thin-skinned; he persevered, being determined, come what might, to seek his 

fortune.  Poor fellow, like many a man in this world who deems himself a most unlucky fellow, he 

had yet to learn the lesson that

you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in 

paragraph 1.E.8.  1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be used on or 

associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of 

this agreement.  There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic 

works even without complying with the full _sought_ for, if they are to be found.  Finding society 

gruffer than usual that morning, and not happening to meet with his or anybody else's fortune in 

any of the streets, through which he passed, he resolved to visit Martha Reading's abode; did so, 

and found her "not at home."  With despairing disgust he then went to visit his sister.  Mrs 

Crashington was obviously at home, for she opened the door to him, and held up her finger. 

"Hallo, Mag!" exclaimed Sparks, a little surprised.  "Hush!" said Mrs Crashington,

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic 

works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project 

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  See paragraph 1.E below.  1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary 

Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of 

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the 

public domain  Thus admonished, Mr Sparks asked in a hoarse whisper, "what was up?"  "Ned's 

had a bad fall, Phil," whispered Mrs Crashington, in a tremulous tone that was so unlike her usual 

voice as to make Sparks look at her in surprise not unmingled with anxiety.  "You don't mean to 

say, Mag, that he's a-goin' to--to--knock under?"  "I hope not, Phil, but--the doctor--"  Here the poor 

woman broke down altogether, and sobbed quietly as she led her brother through the house, and 

into the little bed-room where
