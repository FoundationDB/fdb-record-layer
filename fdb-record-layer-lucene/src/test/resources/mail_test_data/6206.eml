glowering down at=20

Mrs. Trent.  "That doesn't brand her, does it?" he asked.  Still smiling ma=

continued: "She left my service when she ran away with Mr. Walter Brooke--y=
ou know him, I think?=20

Disgraceful though it was, I must say this of him, that he never made any c=
oncealment of the fact=20

that he was a married man. She did it with her eyes open."  "If," Miles gro=
wled, "all this happened=20

'some years ago' she must have been about twelve at the time, and Brooke ou=
ght to have been=20

hounded out of society long ago."  "I needn't say that _we_ have cut him ev=

believe, about nineteen at the time. She did not remain with him, but you c=
an understand that,=20

Miles picked up his hat and=20

ith her fingers on the=20



table and looked thoughtful. "It was quite time somebody interfered," she r=
eflected. And then she=20

remembered with annoyance that she had not found out the name of Meg's empl=

strode through Kensington Gore and past Knightsbridge, when he turned down =
Sloane Street till=20

he came to a fencing school he frequented. Here he went in and had a strenu=

the instructor, but nothing served to restore his peace of mind. He was ang=

k. The Row was=20

beginning to fill, and suddenly he came upon his second cousin, Lady Penelo=
pe Pottinger, sitting=20

all alone on a green chair with another empty one beside it. Miles dropped =
into the empty chair. He=20

o Miles dexterously led=20

the conversation round to Jan and Wren's End.  Lady Pen was looking very be=
autiful that=20

afternoon. She wore a broad-leaved hat which did not wholly conceal her glo=
rious hair. Hair the=20

"Talking of Amber Guiting," he said, "did you ever come across a Miss Morto=

Pen looked hard at Miles. She was wondering whether Meg had ever given away=

that short hair of hers.  "Oh, I've met her just casually, you know, with M=

as a ... rather unusual sort of girl."  "Ever mention me?"  "No, never that=
