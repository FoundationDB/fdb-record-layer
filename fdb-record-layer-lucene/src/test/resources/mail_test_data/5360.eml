 needs an interpreter=20

acquainted with the doctrines of the East, as they are to be found in its s=
ecret volumes; nor is it=20

 who, ignorant of its=20

symbolical meaning and of the universality of the truths underlying and con=
cealed in it, are able to=20

judge only from its dead-letter appearance. It is a grand volume, a master-=
piece composed of=20

clever, ingenious fables containing great verities; but it reveals the latt=
er only to those who, like the=20

Initiates, have a key to its inner meaning; a tale sublime in its morality =
and didactics truly--still a=20

tale and an allegory; a repertory of invented personages in its older Jewis=
h portions, and of dark=20

sayings and parables in its later additions, and thus quite misleading to a=
nyone ignorant of its=20

Esotericism. Moreover it is Astrolatry and Sabaean worship, pure and simple=
, that is to be found in=20

the _Pentateuch_ when it is read exoterically, and Archaic Science and Astr=
onomy to a most=20

wonderful degree, when interpreted--Esoterically.      SECTION VIII. THE BO=
OK OF ENOCH THE=20

ORIGIN AND THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY.   While making a good deal of th=
e=20

_Mercavah_, the Jews, or rather their synagogues, rejected the _Book of Eno=
ch_, either because=20

it was not included from the first in the Hebrew Canon, or else, as Tertull=
ian thought, it was=20

Disavowed by the Jews like all other Scripture which speaks of     Christ.(=
135)   But neither of=20

these reasons was the real one. The Synedrion would have nothing to do with=
 it, simply because it=20

was more of a magic than a purely kabalistic work. The present day Theologi=
ans of both Latin and=20

Protestant Churches class it among apocryphal productions. Nevertheless the=
 _New Testament_,=20

especially in the _Acts_ and _Epistles_, teems with ideas and doctrines, no=
w accepted and=20

established as dogmas by the infallible Roman and other Churches, and even =
with whole=20

sentences taken bodily from Enoch, or the "pseudo-Enoch," who wrote under t=
hat name in=20

Aramaic or Syro- Chaldaic, as asserted by Bishop Laurence, the translator o=
f the Ethiopian text.=20

The plagiarisms are so glaring that the author of _The Evolution of Christi=
anity_, who edited=20

Bishop Laurence's translation, was compelled to make some suggestive remark=
s in his=20

Introduction. On internal evidence(136) this book is found to have been wri=
tten before the=20

Christian period (whether two or twenty centuries does not matter). As corr=
ectly argued by the=20

Editor, it is       Either the inspired forecast of a great Hebrew prophet,=
 predicting     with miraculous=20

accuracy the future teaching of Jesus of Nazareth,     or the Semitic roman=
ce from which the latter=20

borrowed His     conceptions of the triumphant return of the Son of man, to=
 occupy     a judicial=20

throne in the midst of rejoicing saints and trembling     sinners, expectan=
t of everlasting happiness=20

or eternal fire; and     whether these celestial visions be accepted as hum=
an or Divine,     they=20

have exercised so vast an influence on the destinies of     mankind for nea=
rly two thousand years=20

that candid and impartial     seekers after religious truth can no longer d=
elay enquiry into the=20

relationship of the _Book of Enoch_ with the revelation, or the     evoluti=
on, of Christianity.(137)=20

The _Book of Enoch_       Also records the supernatural control of the elem=
ents, through the=20

action of individual angels presiding over the winds, the sea,     hail, fr=
ost, dew, the lightning's=20

flash, and reverberating     thunder. The names of the principal fallen ang=
els are also given,=20

among whom we recognize some of the invisible powers named in the     incan=
tations [magical]=20



inscribed on the terra-cotta cups of     Hebrew-Chaldee conjurations.(138) =
  We also find on these=20

cups the word "Halleluiah," showing that       A word with which ancient Sy=
ro-Chaldaeans conjured=20

has become,     through the vicissitudes of language, the Shibboleth of mod=
ern     Revivalists.(139)=20

The Editor proceeds after this to give fifty-seven verses from various part=
s of the _Gospels_ and=20

_Acts_, with parallel passages from the _Book of Enoch_, and says:       Th=
e attention of=20

theologians has been concentrated on the passage     in the _Epistle of Jud=
e_, because the author=20

specifically names     the prophet; but the cumulative coincidence of langu=
age and ideas     in=20

Enoch and the authors of the _New Testament_ Scripture, as     disclosed in=
 the parallel passages=20

which we have collated, clearly     indicates that the work of the Semitic =
Milton was the=20

inexhaustible source from which Evangelists and Apostles, or the     men wh=
o wrote in their=20

names, borrowed their conceptions of the     resurrection, judgment, immort=
ality, perdition, and of=20

the     universal reign of righteousness, under the eternal dominion of    =
 the Son of man. This=20

evangelical plagiarism culminates in the     Revelation of John, which adap=
ts the visions of Enoch=20

to     Christianity, with modifications in which we miss the sublime     si=
mplicity of the great master=20

of apocalyptic prediction, who     prophesied in the name of the antediluvi=
an patriarch.(140)   In=20

fairness to truth, the hypothesis ought at least to have been suggested, th=
at the _Book of Enoch_=20

in its present form is simply a transcript--with numerous pre-Christian and=
 post-Christian additions=20

at Quebec, I was=20

present when the body of a man drowned the winter before came to the surfac=
e of the St.=20

Lawrence River. On a visit to the northern lakes many persons connected wit=
h the navigation of=20

Lake Superior told me that bodies drowned in its waters seldom or never cam=
e to the surface.=20

Specific gravity of the water itself may be an additional cause for the bod=
y coming to the surface.=20

Dr. Tidy says that every structure of the human body floats in the water of=
 the Dead Sea. The=20

same cannot be said about the buoyancy of the water of Great Salt Lake, the=
 accounts of which=20

have been greatly exaggerated. It does not =E2=80=9Csupport a bather as if =
he were sitting in an arm-chair=20

and float him like a fresh egg.=E2=80=9D Experience shows that there is no =
difficulty either in swimming or in=20

sinking in its waters, the solid constituents of which are estimated to be =
about six and a half times=20

more than that of sea-water. Analysis of Dead Sea water places the solid co=
nstituents at 24.580,=20

while that of Salt Lake is 22.282. Another strong natural brine in the Unit=
ed States is said to be=20

that of Syracuse Saline, New York, which contains 17.35 per cent of sodium =
chloride.  It is evident=20

from what has been stated that no positive assertion can be made as to how =
soon a drowned body=20

will rise to the surface, and at best any conclusion as to the date of subm=
ersion is so=20

unsatisfactory that it may be said to be an unscrupulous use of guessing pr=
ivileges. Errors in legal=20

medicine are sadder in their consequences than those of medical diagnosis. =
The medical legist=20

would therefore do well to preserve the frame of mind that often doubts and=
 rarely affirms, and he=20

should be circumspect enough to avoid dogmatic assertions about matters of =
uncertainty.=20

t nutrition is synonymous=20

with the maintenance of the organism in a stable condition, is it employed =
here.  This condition of=20

equilibrium is maintained by a regular and constant supply of _food_.  =3DA=
 food=3D may be defined to=20

be a substance which, after introduction into the body, supplies material f=
or the renewal of its=20

tissues or sustains some of its vital processes. Foods vary greatly in thei=
r properties as restorative=20

or constructive agencies, some containing but few essential properties, whi=
le others combine=20

almost all of the elements required. As some foods contribute elements for =
tissue restoration,=20

others are specially concerned in the calorifacient activities of the organ=
ism,[948] while others are=20

marked in their tendency to take part, almost exclusively, in special chemi=
cal processes.[949]  The=20

various articles used as foods contain nutritive elements combined with inn=
utritious substances.=20

They have been variously classified, but are conveniently divided into    I=
. Organic foods, {_a._=20

hence must be=20

abundantly supplied and in combination.  Of the non-nitrogenous elements th=
e most important are=20

_fat_, _sugar_, and _starch_.  The _inorganic_ principles are essential to =
the process of nutrition.=20

_Water_, constituting 87 per cent of the bulk of the body, is demanded in c=
onstant supply; while=20

the _saline substances_ are necessary for the perfect performance of many o=

processes.  It is apparent that no single element can alone carry on the nu=
trition of the body, and=20

hence _variety_ in the supply of food, as well as sufficiency in its quanti=
ty, is essential to normal=20

nutrition. Nor are these the only factors in this complex problem. Proper p=
reparation of food, its=20

supply at necessary temperatures,[950] and other requirements enter into th=
e question of normal=20

or sufficient alimentation.[951]  Alimentation is sufficient when it is so =
regulated that all the=20

functions of the body are performed in a complete and regular manner. Insuf=
ficient alimentation=20

induces a series of phenomena and a result which have been designated =E2=

general way. In the circumstances in which he is placed, the supply must be=
 of such character and=20

quantity as shall be proportionate to the constructive and reparative needs=
 of his body. It is=20

possible, however, to state a mean for the various ages and occupations of =
life.  Physiologists=20

point out that Enoch is made, in Chapter lxxi, to divide the day and night =
into eighteen parts, and=20

to represent the longest day in the year as consisting of twelve out of the=
se eighteen parts, while a=20

day of sixteen hours in length could not have occurred in Palestine. The tr=
anslator, Archbishop=20

Laurence, remarks thus:       The region in which the author lived must hav=
e been situated not=20

lower than forty-five degrees north latitude, where the longest     day is =
fifteen hours and a-half,=20

nor higher perhaps than forty-     nine degrees, where the longest day is p=
recisely sixteen hours.=20

This will bring the country where he wrote as high up at least as     the n=
orthern districts of the=20

Caspian and Euxine Seas ... the     author of the _Book of Enoch_ was perha=
ps a member of one=20

of the     tribes which Shalmaneser carried away, and placed "in Halah and =
in     Habor by the river=20

Goshen, and in the cities of the Medes."(141)   Further on, it is confessed=
 that:       It cannot be=20

said that internal evidence attests the superiority     of the _Old Testame=
nt_ to the _Book of=20

Enoch_.... The _Book of     Enoch_ teaches the preexistence of the Son of m=
an, the Elect One,=20

the Messiah, who "from the beginning existed in secret,(142) and     whose =
name was invoked in=20

the presence of the Lord of Spirits,     before the sun and the signs were =
created." The author also=20

refers     to the "other Power who was upon Earth over the water on that   =
  day"--an apparent=20

reference to the language of _Genesis_, i.     2.(143) [We maintain that it=
 applies as well to the=20

Hindu     Narayana--the "mover on the waters."] We have thus the Lord of   =
  Spirits, the Elect One,=20

and a third Power, seemingly foreshadowing     this Trinity [as much as the=
 Trimurti] of futurity; but=20

although     Enoch's ideal Messiah doubtless the following proportions:  Fa=
ts, 1; albuminoids, 2;=20

carbohydrates, 6.  These quantities and especially the fats and carbohydrat=
es, in conditions of=20

hard muscular labor, must be increased; and the proportion would then stand=
:  Fats, 1;=20

albuminoids, 1.7; carbohydrates, 7.  The division of this amount of food el=
ements into proper=20

portions during twenty-four hours is important. This must be regulated by t=
he habits and other=20

circumstances of the individual.[952]  The occurrence of death solely from =
privation of food is=20

comparatively rare; yet it is sufficiently frequent to be considered as one=
 of the causes of violent=20

death and to demand investigation, since circumstances may be such as to co=
nstitute a homicide=20

from criminal neglect or a suicide from intentional abstinence from food.  =

  The complete=20

deprivation of food induces a series of modifications of the functions of t=

somewhat from those developed by a partial and prolonged deprivation. The l=
ength of time during=20

which complete absence of food can be endured varies with circumstances. In=
 absolute stoppage=20

of the food supply the acute sensations of hunger pass away after the first=
 one or two days, and=20

are succeeded by profound functional disturbances with weakness and depress=

on primitive conceptions of the Divinity of the Son of man, we     fail to =

 school; more especially=20

as     "angels of power" abound in the visions of Enoch.(144)   An Occultis=
t would hardly fail to=20

identify the said "Power." The Editor concludes his remarkable reflections =
by adding:       Thus far=20

we learn that the _Book of Enoch_ was published before     the Christian Er=
a by some great=20

Unknown of Semitic [?] race, who,     believing himself to be inspired in a=
 post-prophetic age,=20

borrowed     the name of an antediluvian patriarch(145) to authenticate his=
 own     enthusiastic=20

forecast of the Messianic kingdom. And as the     contents of his marvellou=
s book enter freely into=20

the composition     of the _New Testament_, it follows that if the author w=

death, though these latter symptoms are not uniformly observed.[956]   =E2=

 words of the same Editor:=20

The discovery that the language and ideas of alleged revelation     are fou=

accepted by Evangelists and     Apostles as inspired, but classed by modern=
