the Body; (4) the metaphysical death of the Higher Ego, the _immortal_, eve=
ry time it "falls into=20

matter," or incarnates in a new personality. The Animal Soul, or lower Mana=
s, that shadow of the=20

Divine Ego which separates from it to inform the personality, cannot by any=
 possible means=20

_escape death_ in Kama Loka, at any rate that portion of this reflection wh=
ich remains as a=20

terrestrial residue and cannot be impressed on the Ego. Thus the chief and =
most important=20

perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example. Paris!; =
I--I detest, I loathe it!"=20

"Very fine, Anne. You are now sanguinary; but take care. We are not in the =
time of Malatesta and=20

Castruccio Castracani. You will get yourself decapitated, my beautiful quee=
n, and that would be a=20

pity."  "You laugh."  "Faintly. It is dangerous to go to war with a nation.=
 Look at your brother=20

monarch, Charles I. He is badly off, very badly."  "We are in France, and I=
 am Spanish."  "So much=20

_
teaching, was and is to this day the terrible possibility of the _death_ of=
 the Soul, that is, its=20

severance from the Ego on earth during a person's lifetime. This is a _real=
_ death (though with=20

chances of resurrection), which shows no traces in a person and yet leaves =
him morally a living=20

corpse. It is difficult to see why this teaching should have been preserved=
 until now with such=20

secrecy, when, by spreading it among people, at any rate among those who be=
lieve in=20

reincarnation, so much good might be done. But so it was, and I had no righ=
t to question the=20

wisdom of the prohibition, but have given it hitherto, as it was given to m=
yself, _under pledge_ not=20

to reveal it to the world at large. But now I have permission to give it to=
 all, revealing its tenets first=20

to the Esotericists, and then when they have assimilated them thoroughly it=
 will be their duty to=20

teach others this special tenet of the "second death," and warn all the The=
osophists of its dangers.=20

To make the teaching clearer, I shall seemingly have to go over old ground;=
 in reality, however, it=20

is given out with new light and new details. I have tried to hint at it in =
the _Theosophist_ as I have=20

done in _Isis_, but have failed to make myself understood. I will now expla=
in it, point by point.=20

The Philosophical Rationale of the Tenet.  "Nevertheless, you consent?"  "Y=
es, if the thing be=20

possible."  "It is; it is I who tell you so; make preparations for departur=
e."  "I! I am always prepared=20

to go, only, as you know, I never do go, and perhaps shall go this time as =
little as before."  "In=20

short, if I go, will you go too?"  "I will try."  "You torment me, Giulio, =
with your fears; and what are=20

you afraid of, then?"  "Of many things."  "What are they?"  Mazarin's face,=
 smiling as it was,=20

became clouded.  "Anne," said he, "you are but a woman and as a woman you m=
ay insult men at=20

your ease, knowing that you can do it with impunity. You accuse me of fear;=
 I have not so much as=20

you have, since I do not fly as you do. Against whom do they cry out? is it=
 against you or against=20

myself? Whom would they hang, yourself or me? Well, I can weather the storm=
--I, whom,=20

notwithstanding, you tax with fear--not with bravado, that is not my way; b=
ut I am firm. Imitate me.=20

Make less hubbub and think more deeply. You cry very loud, you end by doing=
 nothing; you talk of=20

flying----"  Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen's hand led=
 her to the window.=20

"Look!" he said.  "Well?" said the queen, blinded by her obstinacy.  "Well,=
 what do you see from=20

this window? If I am not mistaken those are citizens, helmeted and mailed, =
armed with good=20


_
(1) Imagine, for illustration's sake, the one homogeneous, absolute and omn=
ipresent Essence,=20

above the upper step of the "stair of the seven planes of worlds," ready to=
 start on its evolutionary=20

journey. As its correlating reflection gradually descends, it differentiate=
s and transforms into=20

subjective, and finally into objective matter. Let us call it at its north =
pole Absolute Light; at its=20

south pole, which to us would be the fourth or middle step, or plane, count=
ing either way, we know=20

it Esoterically as the One and Universal Life. Now mark the difference. Abo=
ve, LIGHT; below,=20

_Life_. The former is ever immutable, the latter manifests under the aspect=
s of countless=20

differentiations. According to the Occult of the League, and whose eyes are=
 so intently fixed on=20

this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much; and now =
come to the other side--

what do you see? Creatures of the people, armed with halberds, guarding you=
r doors. You will see=20

the same at every opening from this palace to which I should lead you. Your=
 doors are guarded,=20

the airholes of your cellars are guarded, and I could say to you, as that g=
ood La Ramee said to me=20

of the Duc de Beaufort, you must be either bird or mouse to get out."  "He =
did get out,=20

nevertheless."  "Do you think of escaping in the same way?"  "I am a prison=
er, then?"  "Parbleu!"=20

said Mazarin, "I have been proving it to you this last hour."  And he quiet=
ly resumed his=20


_
differentiated reflections in the lower; and according to the same law, not=
hing which is=20

differentiated can be blended with the homogeneous.  Again, nothing can end=
ure of that which=20

lives and breathes and has its being in the seething waves of the world, or=
 plane of differentiation.=20

Thus Buddhi and Manas being both primordial rays of the One Flame, the form=
er the vehicle, the=20

upadhi or vahana, of the one eternal Essence, the latter the vehicle of Mah=
at or Divine Ideation=20

(Maha-Buddhi in the _Puranas_), the Universal Intelligent Soul--neither of =
them, as such, can=20

become extinct or be annihilated, either in essence or consciousness. But t=
he physical personality=20

with its Linga Sharira, and the animal soul, with its Kama,(844) can and do=
 become so. They are=20

born in the realm of illusion, and must vanish like a fleecy cloud from the=
 blue and eternal sky.  He=20

interrupted.  Anne, trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation, left=
 the room, shutting the=20

door violently after her. Mazarin did not even turn around. When once more =
in her own apartment=20

Anne fell into a chair and wept; then suddenly struck with an idea:  "I am =
saved!" she exclaimed,=20

rising; "oh, yes! yes! I know a man who will find the means of taking me fr=
om Paris, a man I have=20

too long forgotten." Then falling into a reverie, she added, however, with =
an expression of joy,=20

"Ungrateful woman that I am, for twenty years I have forgotten this man, wh=
om I ought to have=20

made a marechal of France. My mother-in-law expended gold, caresses, dignit=
ies on Concini, who=20

ruined her; the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination: wh=
ile I have left in=20

obscurity, in poverty, the noble D'Artagnan, who saved me!"  And running to=
 a table, on which=20

were=20


_
origin of the human Egos, called Monads, generically, and what they were be=
fore they were forced=20

to incarnate in the human animal. The divine beings whom Karma led to act i=
n the drama of=20

Manvantaric life, are entities from higher and earlier worlds and planets, =
whose Karma had not=20

been exhausted when their world went into Pralaya. Such is the teaching; bu=
t whether it is so or=20

not, the Higher Egos are--as compared to such forms of transitory, terrestr=
ial mud as ourselves--

Divine Beings, Gods, immortal throughout the Mahamanvantara, or the 311,040=
,000,000,000=20

years during which the Age of Brahma lasts. And as the Divine Egos, began t=
o write.     50. The=20

Interview.   It had been D'Artagnan's practice, ever since the riots, to sl=
eep in the same room as=20

Porthos, and on this eventful morning he was still there, sleeping, and dre=
aming that a yellow=20

cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat, whic=
h he held out till it was=20

overflowing with pistoles. As for Porthos, he dreamed that the panels of hi=
s carriage were not=20

capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be pain=
ted on them. They=20

were both aroused at seven o'clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant=
, who brought a letter=20

for D'Artagnan.  "From=20
