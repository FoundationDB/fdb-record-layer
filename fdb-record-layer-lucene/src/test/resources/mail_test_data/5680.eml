The Jackson managers banked from the first upon two main assets: one was th=
e exceptional=20

popularity of their candidate, especially in the South and West; the other =
was a political situation=20

so muddled that at the coming election it might be made to yield almost any=
 result. For upwards of=20

a generation the presidency and vice presidency had been at the disposal of=
 a working alliance of=20

Virginia and New York, buttressed by such support as was needed from other =
controllable States.=20

Virginia regularly got the presidency, New York (except at the time of the =
Clinton defection of=20

1812) the vice presidency. After the second election of Monroe, in 1820, ho=
wever, there were=20

multiplying signs that this affiliation of interests had reached the end of=
 its tether. In the first place,=20

the Virginia dynasty had run out; at all events Virginia necessary, and whi=
ch imposed serious=20

duties.  To defend the weak and the oppressed was what the soldier of God s=
wore to do; and first=20

in the list of those needing his defence were women. The knight was not onl=
y the sworn defender=20

of woman from all physical wrong and oppression, but he must guard the hono=
r of her name.=20

Courteous and gentle he must be toward women himself, and from others less =
gentle he must=20

compel at least outward respect. In the statutes of many an order of knight=
hood we find provisions=20

like those set forth by Louis de Bourbon when, in 1363, he established the =
order of the Golden=20

Shield: "He enjoined (the knights) to abstain from swearing and blaspheming=
 the name of God;=20

above all, he enjoined them to honor _dames et damoiselles_, not submitting=
 to hear ill spoken of=20

New England offered John Quincy Adams. She did so with reluctance, for the =
old Federalist=20

elements had never forgiven him for his desertion to the Republican camp in=
 the days of the=20

embargo, while the back country democracy had always looked upon him as an =
alien. But he was=20

the section's only available man--indeed, the only promising candidate from=
 any Northern State.=20

His frigid manner was against him. But he had had a long and honorable dipl=
omatic career; he=20

was winning new distinction as Secretary of State; and he could expect to p=
rofit both by the feeling=20

that the North was entitled to the presidency and by the fact that he was t=
he only candidate from a=20

non-slave State.  Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, was the heir apparen=
t of the Virginia=20

dynasty. Formerly this would have meant a clear road to the White House. Ev=
en now it was=20

supposed to be a tremendous asset; and notwithstanding the Georgian's perso=
nal unpopularity in=20

most parts of the country, his advantages as the "regular candidate," coupl=
ed with the long and=20

careful campaign carried on in his behalf, were expected by many keen obser=
vers to pull him=20

through.  A third candidate within women, who from the weakness of their se=
x have no means of=20

defending themselves, is losing all sense of honor, and shaming and dishono=
ring oneself." It was=20

also about this time that Marshal Boucicaut established the order of the Kn=
ights of the Green=20

Shield, fourteen in number, whose special purpose was the defence of women,=
 and on whose=20

shields was a blazon representing a woman clothed in white. This same senti=
ment we find=20

persisting even in Brantome: "If an honest woman would maintain her firmnes=
s and constancy, her=20

devoted servitor must not spare even his life to defend her if she runs the=
 least risk in the world,=20

whether of her honor or of evil-speaking; even as I have seen some who have=
 stopped all the=20

wicked tongues of the court when they came to speak ill of their ladies, wh=
om, according to the=20

devoirs of chivalry, we are bound to serve as champions in their affliction=
."  The devotion to=20

woman which we find becoming the dominant feature of the chivalrous ideal r=
ises at times to sheer=20

extravagance, mere moonshine madness. A knight vows devotion to his lady-lo=
ve; to prove that he=20

is the truest lover in the world and she the fairest dame, he=20
