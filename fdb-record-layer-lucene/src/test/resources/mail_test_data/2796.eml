 He flew off to the philodendron monstera before each of the three hundred =
and sixty idols and pointed to it with his staff, saying, 'Truth is come an=
d lying is undone,' and at these words his attendants hewed it down; and al=
l the idols and household gods of Mekka and round about were destroyed.  It=
 was thus that until finally it seemed as if one was in the bushes not a do=

Follow me!=E2=80=9D  He flew off to the _
keystone was set in the eighth year of the flight (A.D. 630), when a body o=
f Kureysh broke the=20

truce by attacking an ally of the Muslims; and Mohammad forthwith marched u=
pon Mekka with ten=20

thousand men, and the city, defence being hopeless, surrendered. Now was th=
e time for the=20

Prophet to show his bloodthirsty nature. His old persecutors are at his fee=
t. Will he not trample on=20

them, torture them, revenge himself after his own cruel manner? Now the man=
 will come forward=20

in his true colours: we may prepare our horror, and cry shame beforehand.  =
But what is this? Is=20

there no blood in the streets? Where are the bodies of the thousands that h=
ave been butchered?=20

Facts are hard things; and it is a fact that the day of Mohammad's greatest=
 triumph over his=20

enemies was also the day of his grandest victory over himself. He freely fo=
rgave the Kureysh all=20

the years of sorrow and cruel scorn they had inflicted on him: he gave an a=
mnesty to the whole=20

Washer=E2=80=99s plan dawned upon their minds in an instant, and both bucks=
 sprang up as if to start for=20

Black Ravine at once.  =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll do it!=E2=80=9D exclaimed Whi=
te Tail. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll make the jump if I fall in the ravine.=20

It=E2=80=99s better that way than to be pulled down by Puma or Timber.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s much better not to fall at all,=E2=80=9D=20

was Washer=E2=80=99s quiet remark. =E2=80=9CBut now don=E2=80=99t get excit=
ed, or you=E2=80=99ll jump from the frying-pan into the=20

fire. How do you know if one of Timber=E2=80=99s family isn=E2=80=99t watch=
ing the ravine? He may be.=E2=80=9D  This=20

suggestion dashed their hopes, and sent the cold chills down their backs. N=
o one could tell where=20

the wolves and pumas were scattered. They were closing in upon them on all =
sides. They might=20

surprise the cornered bucks before ever they could reach Black Ravine.  =E2=
=80=9CThe only way I can=20

suggest,=E2=80=9D added Washer, =E2=80=9Cis for Downy to fly ahead, and rep=
ort to us where they=E2=80=99re hiding. You=20

could do that, Downy, couldn=E2=80=99t you?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy, certain=

proscription list when he entered as a conqueror the city of his bitterest =
enemies. The army=20

followed his example, and entered quietly and peaceably; no house was robbe=
d, no woman=20

insulted. One thing alone suffered =E2=80=9CThen I wouldn=E2=80=99t waste a=
ny time.=E2=80=9D  Downy immediately flew=20

away in the direction of Black Ravine, while White Tail and Young Black Buc=
k waited impatiently=20

for his return. It seemed a long, long time to them, and every few moments =
they could hear the call=20

of Timber and his pack. They were drawing=20
