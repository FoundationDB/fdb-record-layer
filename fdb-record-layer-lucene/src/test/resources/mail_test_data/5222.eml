This exhibits the work of Knibb as being equal, as his employment at the Court shows, to the _
time, seeing that they did not come, neither in four, nor in eight       months prepared for death, 

and to give their lives to those to whom       they had consecrated them before they left.  And so 

the Indians took       vengeance upon them, killing them justly, although they were       innocent: 

because it was believed that the monks had been the cause       of that treachery, and because 

they saw that what had been       faithfully promised them within four months was not fulfilled; and 

also because this is about 1780 to 1785. Another clock, illustrated on p. 225, is by Thurston 

Lassell, Toxteth Park, Liverpool. This in date is about 1745. The phases of the moon are shown in 

the lunette. The case is of more slender proportions than its fellow. The hood exhibits a reticence 

which was lost in later examples, especially in provincial work made in Yorkshire, where the case 

became of unwieldy size and somewhat ungainly shape.  Other names of Liverpool makers found 

on long-case clocks are William Sutton, Harrison &

knew, nor know, that there is a difference between the friars and       the Spanish tyrants, bandits, 

and assassins of all that country. 19.19. The blessed friars suffered unjustly, and by that injustice 

there       is no doubt that, according to our holy faith, they are true       martyrs, and reign blissfully 

to-day with God in the heavens; for       they were sent to that land under obedience, and their 

intention was       to preach and spread the holy faith, to save all those souls and to       suffer 

every kind of affliction and death that might be offered them       for Jesus Christ crucified. 20.20. 

Another time, through the great tyranny and execrable works of the       wicked Spaniards, the 

Indians killed two monks of St. Dominic and       one of St. Francis, of which I myself am a witness, 

for I escaped       the same death by divine miracle; so serious and horrible was the       case I 

might have much to say that would amaze mankind, but on       account of the length of the 

narration I will not relate it here nor       until the time comes.  The last day will disclose all more 

clearly,       for God will then avenge such horrible and abominable outrages as       are done in the 

Indies by those who bear the name of Christians. 21.21. Another time there was a town in the 

provinces called Capo della       Codera, the lord of which was called Nigoroto; this is either a 

personal name or else one common to all the lords of that country. 22.22. He was so kind and his 

people so virtuous, that when the Spanish       ships passed there the Spaniards found comforts, 

provisions, rest,       and every consolation and refreshment, and many did he deliver from 

death, who, wasted with hunger, took refuge there from other       provinces where they had 

assassinated, and practised evil and       tyranny.  He gave them food and sent them safe to the 

Pearl Island       [Cubagua], where some Christians dwelt, whom he could have slain,       without 

any one knowing it, and did not: all the Christians finally       called Nigoroto's town the mansion 

and home of everybody. 23.23. An ill-starred tyrant deliberated within himself to attack this 

place, as the people felt so safe: so he went there with a ship and       invited many people to 

come on board, as they were used to, trusting       the Spaniards.  When many men, women, and 

children were gathered in       the ship, he set sail and came to the island of San Juan, where he 

(Ormskirk), W. Lassell, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, with motto, "Time shows the Way of Life's Decay," 

with brass face, lunar movement, and monthly dial with indicator. (This style of dial is a feature of a 

Shropshire clock illustrated p. 249.) Brown, Liverpool, is found on a mahogany long-case clock 

and also on a small long-case clock. To those who are interested the portrait in oils of Peter 

Litherland, the inventor of the rack lever, who died in 1804, is in the possession of the Corporation 

of Liverpool.  Among other Lancashire makers the following are noteworthy: T. Lees (Bury), 1795-

1800; Archibald Coats (Wigan), 1780; Barr (Bolton), 1790; James Barlow (Oldham), 1775; 

Benjamin Barlow (Ashton-under-Lyne), 1780; and Nathaniel Brown (Manchester), 1780-1785.  In 

Westmorland and Cumberland the names Burton, of Kendal, and Russell, of Carlisle, are often 

found on grandfather clocks of local manufacture of the late eighteenth century.  In regard to a 

particular style of case associated with Lancashire and with Cheshire, having the door decorated 

with panel in Gothic style, two examples are illustrated (p. 227), one by Henry Higginbotham 

(Macclesfield), and the other by Heywood, Northwich, 1790 (p. 231).  [Illustration: LONG-CASE 

MAHOGANY EIGHT-DAY CLOCK.  Maker, Heywood (Northwich, Cheshire). 1790.  The Gothic 

panel in door is a noticeable feature.  (_By courtesy of Messrs. A. B. Daniell & Sons._)] 

[Illustration: LONG-CASE EIGHT-DAY CLOCK.  With dial showing days of month. Oak case 

veneered in mahogany.  Maker, Thomas Wall (Birmingham). Date, about 1795.  (_In possession 



of author._)]  =Clockmakers of the Midlands.=--As typical of the fine work produced, the bracket 

clock by Sam Watson, of Coventry, 1687, illustrated (p. 181), shows that the provincial maker was 

at that date in no way on a lower plane than his contemporary in London. Other makers are Wilson 

(Warwick), 1709; John Whitehurst (Derby), 1785--a fine long-case clock by this maker is in the 

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; W. Francis (Birmingham), and Thomas Wall 

(Birmingham), 1798. An example by this maker is illustrated (p. 233), exhibiting a pastoral scene 

painted in the lunette of the dial. This clock--in the possession of the author--keeps excellent time 

although 120 years old, and has gone for ten years without stopping.  Of Nottingham makers, the 

following names of early craftsmen are found on watches: Isaac Alexander, about 1760 (a watch, 

gold inner case, white dial; outer

and saw that tyrant and heard what he had done. 24.24. He left all that country ruined; and all 

those Spanish tyrants, who       robbed and assassinated along those coasts took it ill, and 

detested       so dreadful a deed because they lost the asylum and dwelling place by J. June, 

1745), and Thomas Hudson, about 1790 (silver, white dial; outer case of tortoiseshell, with silver 

mounts). The name of Hen. Page, Upper Broughton (Notts), is found on a brass clock, and John 

Kirk was a maker at Epperstone and Skegby before he came to London in

they had had there as though in their own houses. 25.25. To abbreviate, I omit the narration of the 

tremendous wickedness       and fearful deeds that have been committed, and are committed to-

day       in these countries. 26.26. They have taken more than two million ruined souls from that 

populous seacoast to the island of Hispaniola, and to that of San       Juan, where they have 

likewise caused their death in the mines and       other works, of which there were many, as has 

been said above.  And       it excites great compassion and sorrow to see all that most 

delightful coast deserted and depopulated. 27.27. It is certainly true, that never does a ship sail 

loaded with       kidnapped and ruined Indians (as I have told) without the third part       of those 

that embarked, being thrown dead into the sea, besides       those that they kill in effecting their 

capture. 28.28. The reason of this is, that as they need many men to the collection of watches at 

Nottingham Museum, apart from the two above-mentioned, are a good many by makers of a later 

date, mainly of the early nineteenth century: John Lingford, A. Shepperley, William Young--all of 

Nottingham, and Geo. Stacey, Worksop.  Among the other watches on exhibition are an early one 

by Robert Dent (Lincoln), No. 61, and a watch with gold case with chased _repousse_ figures and 

ornament by J. Windmills, the celebrated London maker, 1671-1700.  This short list of Midland 

makers is obviously incomplete, and it is to be hoped that some painstaking horologists will 

amplify it and do honour to the makers and to the counties concerned.  =The Home Counties.=--

Thomas Tompion (1671-1713), the famous London maker, commenced at Bedford and ended at 

Bath. We have seen a brass lantern clock engraved "Thos. Tonkink de Bedforde." This might very 

well be one of his early clocks, and we know his great last triumph in the famous long-case 


_
their aim of making more money from a greater number of slaves, they       carry but little food and 

water, so as to save expense to the       tyrants, who call themselves privateers; they have enough 

for only a       few more people than the Spaniards who man the ships to make the       raids; as 

these miserable Indians are in want and die of hunger and       thirst, the remedy is to throw them 

in the sea. 29.29. And in truth, one of them told me, that from the Lucayan this incidental 

connection of the "father of English watchmaking" with the provinces, there stands Joseph Knibb, 

of Oxon, who was admitted to the Clockmakers' Company of London in 1677. He worked in 

London for the Court of Charles II. But he was established in Oxfordshire, as is shown by the 

copper token he issued, with inscription "Joseph Knibb Clockmaker in Oxon," and on reverse the 

dial of a clock with initials I.K. in centre. We give an illustration of this token.  [Illustration]
