The country awaited the 9th of February--the day of the official count--wit=
h great interest. Clay=20

was, of course, eliminated. Crawford likewise, by reason of his poor showin=
g and the precarious=20

state of his health, could not expect to do more than hold his own. The con=
test had narrowed to=20

Jackson and Adams, with Clay holding the balance. There were twenty-four St=
ates in the Union;=20

the successful candidate must command the votes of thirteen.  The choice th=
at Clay now had to=20

make was distasteful, although not really difficult. Jackson had obtained a=
 substantial plurality of=20

the electoral votes; he probably had a plurality of the popular vote, altho=
ugh in the six States in=20

which the electors were chosen by the Legislature the popular vote could no=
t be computed; the=20

Legislature of Clay's own State called upon the Congressmen from the State =
to give the=20

Tenneseean its support. But Clay had felt very bitterly about the candidacy=
 of "this military=20

chieftain." Furthermore, he knew that if Jackson were to be elected, the co=
untry would not be=20

disposed to take his successor from the West. Besides, Calhoun had put hims=
elf in line for the=20

Jacksonian succession. On the other hand, Clay was not without grievances a=
gainst Adams. The=20

New Englander had captured the coveted Secretaryship of State in Monroe's C=
abinet; he had=20

taken no pains to conceal his dislike of the Kentucky "gamester in politics=
"; his foreign policy had=20

been the target of many of Clay's keenest oratorical thrusts. But the count=
ry would be safe in his=20

hands; and a popular westerner might well hope to become his successor. The=
 decision in favor of=20

Adams was reached with little delay and was confided to intimates almost tw=
o months before the=20

House balloted. Though Clay's choice did not insure the election of Adams, =
it made that outcome=20

extremely probable.  As the weeks passed, the situation became more tense. =
All the principals in=20

the drama were at the capital--Adams as vessel." All through the ages when =
Christianity was=20

struggling to maintain its own, the saints and martyrs, the holy hermits, i=
n whom the Church=20

delighted, fled the very sight of woman, and shuddered at her touch as at a=
 contamination. Yet, in=20

spite of this, or along with this, there was growing the adoration of a wom=
an, the mother of Him=20

whom the world called the Son of God. Little was known about her; so much t=
he better for the=20

pious hagiologists, who thought they did no wrong in piecing out scant fact=
 with abundant legend.=20

A regular cult of the Virgin arose, reaching such proportions that the Chur=
ch had to do something=20

to recognize it. Numerous festivals were established in her honor, some wit=
h the sanction of the=20

Church, some without that sanction, some celebrated throughout Christendom,=
 some only locally:=20

the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Purification, the Assumption.  The my=
stic worship, the=20

tendency to find hidden meanings in things of the most ordinary appearance =
to the lay eye, the=20

extravagant symbolism, were at their height in the twelfth and thirteenth c=
enturies. The scholastic=20

theologians and sermon writers applied their fantastic methods to all phase=
s of the religious life; so=20

we must not be surprised to find them treating even the Virgin in this way.=
 One of the extraordinary=20

instances which we can give occurs in a sermon delivered in Paris by the Ch=
ancellor of the=20

university, Stephen Langton, later Archbishop of Canterbury. His name, by t=
he way, is Latinized=20

for us as _Stephanus de Langeduna_, whence it was easy and flattering to de=
duce _Stephanus=20

Linguae tonantis_. As a text the preacher takes nothing more nor less than =
a popular song, _Bele=20

Aalis main se leva_, of which the following is the sense: "Sweet Alice aros=
e in the early morn,=20

dressed herself and adorned her fair body, and went into the garden. There =
she found five=20

flowrets, of which she made a chaplet covered with roses. By my faith, ther=

By the last week of January it was rather generally understood that Clay's =
strength would be=20

thrown to Adams. Up to this time the Jackson men had refused to believe tha=
t such a thing could=20

happen. But evidence had been piled mountain-high; adherents of both little=
 love song; and the=20

author, whoever he may be,--probably some forgotten strolling minstrel who =
saw the girl go into=20

the garden and wrought the incident to suit his fancy,--certainly had no re=
ligious intent. But=20

Stephen Langton endeavors to make a=20

Two days later an obscure Pennsylvania Congressman by the name of George Kr=
emer tendered=20

his respects to "the Honorable H. Clay," avowed his authorship of the commu=
nication in question,=20

offered to prove the truth of his charges, and closed sententiously by affi=
rming that as a=20

representative of the people the song to the Virgin, and, as he says, "thus=
 to turn evil into good."=20

Let me quote a few lines of the sermon to show how this _tour de force_ was=
 accomplished.=20

: Speciosa ut gemma=20
