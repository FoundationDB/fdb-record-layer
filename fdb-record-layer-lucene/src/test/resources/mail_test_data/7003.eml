"Oh, madame," she cried, in a burst of loyalty, "if madame will permit me t=
o stay with her!"  Honora=20

was troubled, but her strange calmness did not forsake her. The morning was=
 spent in packing,=20

which was a simple matter. She took only such things as she needed, and lef=
t her dinner-gowns=20

hanging in the closets. A few precious books of her own she chose, but the =
jewellery her husband=20

had given her was put in boxes and laid upon the dressing-table. In one of =
these boxes was her=20

wedding ring. When luncheon was over, an astonished and perturbed butler pa=
cked the=20

Leffingwell silver and sent it off to storage.  There had been but one inte=
rruption in Honora's=20

labours. A note had reasonable construction. Once, passing the miser's room=
 on the way to your=20

own, you heard them quarrelling and you heard the miser say, 'I have but to=
 lift my finger, and I=20

could send you back to the hulks! I will give you twenty pounds for the bon=
ds, and no more.' A=20

reasonable story, mother?"  "Perfectly reasonable, Jeremiah. Living here in=
 seclusion as he has=20

done for so many years, with no servant but me, who is to dispute it? That =
is not the end,=20

Jeremiah."  "That is not the end. To-night, late, the man comes again, and =
is admitted. You go to=20

bed as usual, and leave them together as usual. To-morrow morning you get u=
p, and wait for=20

Miser Farebrother to ring his bell for=20


_
would understand, and respect her the more. What would their love have been=
, without that=20

respect? She shuddered to think. And he sent her this ring, as a token of t=
hat love, as undying as=20

the fire in its stones. Would she wear it, that in her absence she might th=
ink of him? Honora kissed=20

it and slipped it on her finger, where it sparkled. The letter was beneath =
her gown, though she=20

knew it by heart. Chiltern had gone at last: he could not, he said, remain =
in Newport and not see=20

her.  At midday she made but the pretence of a meal. It was not until after=
wards, in wandering=20

through the lower rooms of this house, become so dear to her, that agitatio=
n seized her, and a=20

desire to weep. What was she leaving so precipitately? and whither going? T=
he world indeed was=20

wide, and these rooms had been her home. The day had grown blue-grey, and i=
n the dining room=20

the gentle face seemed to look down upon her compassionately from the portr=
ait. The scent of the=20

roses overpowered her. As she listened, no sound brake the quiet of the pla=
ce.  Would Howard=20

never come? The train was in--had been in ten minutes. Hark, the sound of w=
heels! Her heart=20

beating wildly, she ran to the windows of the drawing-room and peered throu=
gh the lilacs. Yes,=20

there he was, ascending the steps.  "Mrs. Spence is out, I suppose," she he=
ard him say to the=20

butler, who followed with his bag.  "No, sir, she's is the drawing-room."  =
The sight of him, with his=20

air of satisfaction and importance, proved an unexpected tonic to her stren=
gth. It was as though he=20

had brought into the room, marshalled behind him, all the horrors of her ma=
rriage, and she=20

marvelled and shuddered anew at the thought of the years of that sufferance=
.  "Well, I'm back," he=20

said, "and we've made a great killing, as I wrote you. They were easier tha=
n I expected."  He came=20

forward for the usual perfunctory kiss, but she recoiled, and it was then t=
hat his eye seemed to=20

grasp the significance of her travelling suit and veil, and he glanced at h=
er face.  "What's up?=20

Where are you going?" he demanded. "Has anything happened?"  "Everything," =
she said, and it=20

was then, suddenly, that she felt the store of her resolution begin to ebb,=
 and she trembled.=20

"Howard, I am going away."  He stopped short, and thrust his hands into the=
 pockets of his=20

checked trousers.  "Going away," he repeated. "Where?"  "I don't know," sai=
d Honora; "I'm going=20

away."  As though to cap the climax of tragedy, he smiled as he produced hi=
s cigarette case. And=20

she was swept, as it were, by a scarlet flame that deprived her lips close =
to her ear. "Can you=20

guess the reason why he does not ring his bell?"  "I can guess the reason, =
Jeremiah," she replied,=20

in a cold, malignant voice. "After to-morrow he will never raise his hand a=
gain!"  "And I am safe!"=20

said Jeremiah.  "And you are safe, my dear, dear lad; and he is punished as=
 he deserves to be."=20

"He has been in the grounds at night very often these last few weeks, mothe=
r?"  "Very often,=20

Jeremiah."  "Whether he dies in the house or out of the house, the story ho=
lds good."  "The story=20

holds good," she echoed.  "You can describe the man's dress and appearance:=
 there is nothing=20

like being exact in these matters: there are peculiarities about him by whi=
ch you will be able to=20

recognise him when he is arrested."  "Leave all that to me, Jeremiah. I wil=
l show you what I am=20

capable of. And you--where will you be in the morning?"  "In the office in =
London, as usual, having=20

possessed myself of the keys which he tricked out of me upstairs. Give me a=
 drink of brandy--ah!=20

that puts life into one! And some bread and meat--no, I cannot eat."  "You =
must, Jeremiah; you=20

must! It will give you strength. That's right. Force yourself to eat. Don't=
 drink much. Keep cool for=20

what is to come! Now go--and keep out of sight. You must not be seen in the=
 village. The monster=20

upstairs never wanders near the beeches; you will be safe there. I will com=
e to you in an hour or=20

two."  Stealthily, warily, Jeremiah crept from the house, and proceeded in =
the direction indicated=20



by his mother. The sun was setting, and blood was in the sky. It shone upon=
 the rising ground and=20

upon the topmost branches of the trees. His eyes did not rest upon the glor=
ies of a lovely sunset,=20

but upon blotches and streaks of blood. Once, standing where he could not h=
imself be seen, he=20

turned to the house, and watched the blood-red stains in the windows. Behin=
d the crimson panes=20

lurid shadows moved; the rooms were alive with murderous shapes and forms e=
ngaged in fierce=20

conflict. Above him and all around him lurked the spirit of murder!     CHA=
PTER VI.  A DREAM OF=20

AN ANGEL.   "Oh Aunt Leth, Aunt Leth!" cried Phoebe. "Can nothing be done?-=
-nothing, nothing!"=20

"I fear not, dear child," said Aunt Leth, in a voice of quiet despair. "You=
r uncle and I have thought=20

of every possible way in which our dear home might be saved, but thinking a=
nd talking will not=20

stave off impending ruin. To-morrow we shall be beggared and disgraced."  T=
here was no light in=20

the room. On a stool sat Uncle Leth, with his face buried in his hands; Aun=
t Leth sat on a=20


_
"Well," he said complacently, "there's no accounting for women. A case of n=
erves--eh, Honora?=20

Been hitting the pace a little too hard, I guess." He lighted a match, blis=
sfully unaware of the=20

quality of her look. "All of us have to get toned up once in a while. I nee=
d it myself. I've had to drink=20

a case of Scotch whiskey out West to get this deal through. Now what's the =
name of that new boat=20

with everything on her from a cafe to a Stock Exchange? A German name."  "I=
 don't know," said=20

Honora. She had answered automatically.  To the imminent peril of one of th=
e frailest of Mrs.=20

Forsythe's chairs, he sat down on it, placed his hands on his knees, flung =
back his head, and blew=20

the smoke towards the ceiling. Still she stared at him, as in a state of se=
mi-hypnosis.  "Instead of=20

going off to one of those thousand-dollar-a-minute doctors, let me prescrib=
e for you," he said. "I've=20

handled some nervous men in my time, and I guess nervous women aren't much =
different. You've=20

had these little attacks before, and they blow over--don't they? Wing owes =
me a vacation. If I do=20

say it myself, there are not five men in New York who would have pulled off=
 this deal for him. Now=20

the proposition I was going to make to you is this: that we get cosey in a =
cabin de luxe on that=20

German boat, hire an automobile on the other side, and do up Europe. It's a=
 sort of a handicap=20

never to have been over there."  "Oh, you're making it very hard for me, Ho=
ward," she cried. "I=20

might have known that you couldn't understand, that you never could underst=
and--why I am going=20

away. I've lived with you all this time, and you do not know me any better =
than you know--the=20

scrub-woman. I'm going away from you--forever."  In spite of herself, she e=
nded with an=20

uncontrollable sob.  "Forever!" he repeated, but he continued to smoke and =
to look at her without=20

any evidences of emotion, very much as though he had received an ultimatum =
in a business=20

transaction. And then there crept into his expression something of a compla=
cent pity that braced=20

her to continue. "Why?" he asked.  "Because--because I don't love you. Beca=
use you don't love=20

me. You don't know what love is--you never will."  "But we're married," he =
said. "We get along all=20

right."  "Oh, can't you see that that makes it all the worse!" she cried. "=
I can stand it no longer. I=20

can't live with you--I won't live with you. I'm of no use to you--you're su=
fficient unto yourself. It was=20

all a frightful mistake. I brought nothing into your life, and I take nothi=
ng out of it. We are strangers-

-we have always been so. I am not even your housekeeper. Your whole interes=
t in life is in your=20

business, and you come home to read the newspapers and to sleep! Home! The =
very word is a=20

mockery. If you had to choose upon his neck, vainly striving to console him=
; Fanny lay upon the=20

sofa, sobbing; Robert sat moodily in a corner. To-morrow the acceptance for=
 three hundred=20

pounds was due, and they had not a shilling to meet it.  They had been talk=
ing in the dark for an=20

hour, and the parents had deemed it right that their children should be mad=
e acquainted with the=20

blow that was about to fall upon them. Phoebe, as one of the family, could =
not be left in ignorance,=20

although they would cheerfully have spared her the grief into which they we=
re plunged. All was=20

now known, and ruin stared them in the face.  Aunt Leth was the least demon=
strative of the group,=20

and she suffered perhaps the most. Her trembling limbs, her quivering voice=
, her pitiful glances as=20

her eyes wandered around, denoted the agony of her soul. Phoebe could not b=
ear to look toward=20

her. Dark as was the room, she saw and understood it all, and she was racke=
d with anguish.  Had=20

it been any other person than Jeremiah Pamflett from whom the money had bee=
n borrowed, they=20

believed that some respite would have been granted them; but he was their b=
itterest enemy, and=20

they were convinced that he was the moving spirit through whom the relentle=
ss decree had been=20

issued that not a day's grace would be allowed. Troubles and griefs had fal=
len to the lot of Aunt=20



Leth in the course of her happy married life, and she had met them cheerful=
ly; but this=20

overwhelming stroke had broken her down. There are shocks against which the=
 bravest cannot=20

contend, and this was one.  "It is I," suddenly cried Uncle Leth, starting =
up, and pacing the room in=20

a frenzy of excitement--"It is I who have brought this ruin and disgrace up=
on the beloved ones I=20

should have shielded and protected! This is how I have repaid them for the =
love which has been=20

showered upon me! Wretch that I am!--I do not deserve to live!"  They clung=
 about him, and=20

besought him to be calm. They called him by the most endearing names. Only =
Phoebe did not=20

move from her chair.  It was terrible to witness his agony; but so sweet an=
d tender and true were=20

their ministerings that they succeeded in their loving endeavours. He burst=
 into tears, and sank=20

upon the stool, and laid his head upon his wife's knees.  "This morning," h=
e said, presently, in a=20

voice so pitiful that their tears flowed afresh, "as I walked to the bank I=
 had a dream of hope. It was=20

foolish, I know, and neither manly nor practical--for life's troubles are n=
ot to be surmounted by=20

dreams--but I could not help it. These dreams have happened to me, and I sh=
ould have done my=20

duty better to my dear ones here had I not encouraged them." He passed his =
hand across his=20

forehead with the air of a man upon whom a sudden mental bewilderment had f=
allen. "What was I=20

saying,=20


_
instant. And I--I have been starved. It isn't your fault, perhaps, that you=
 don't understand that a=20

woman needs something more than dinner-gowns and jewels and--and trips abro=
ad. Her only=20

possible compensation for living with a man is love. Love--and you haven't =
the faintest conception=20

of it. It isn't your fault, perhaps. It's my fault for marrying you. I didn=
't know any better."  She=20

paused with her breast heaving. He rose and walked over to the fireplace an=
d flicked his ashes=20

into it before he spoke. His calmness maddened her.  "Why didn't you say so=
mething about this=20

before?" he  "You had a dream of hope," said Aunt Leth, raising his hand to=
 her lips and kissing it,=20

"as you walked to the bank this morning."  "I do not remember what it was,"=
 he said, helplessly;=20

"only that an angel came forward and saved us."  Phoebe stole softly out of=
 the room--so softly=20

through the darkness that they did not for a little while observe her absen=
ce. To a certain extent=20

she had kept aloof from them during the last hour.  She went up to the bedr=
oom occupied by her=20

and Fanny. She wanted to be alone. What was it her uncle had said? That an =
angel had come=20

forward and saved them! The=20
