CHAPTER XIII  "Shall I tell Joe! Most certainly."  But she did not tell him=
 all, that night. She did not=20

say, "One of Amy's friends was here today, and she's coming again, and more=
 are coming--and I=20

hate them, every one!" She simply remarked:  "Oh, Joe, dear--Fanny Carr was=
 here today."  "She=20

was, eh?" he gave a slight start. "Where has she been all this time?"  "Abr=
oad." And Ethel=20

answered his questions. "She'll be here a good deal, I fancy," she ended. J=
oe looked annoyed and=20

uneasy. But he did not speak, that evening, of the memories rising in his m=
ind. For on both the old=20

spell of silence was strong. Subtly the spirit of the first wife came steal=
ing back into the room,=20

pervaded it and made it her own. But her name was still unspoken.  The next=
 day brought an=20

exquisite baby's cap with Fanny's card tucked inside. And in the fortnight =
after that, Fanny herself=20

came several times. She talked in such a natural way, and her smile and the=
 look in her clever=20

grey eyes was so good-humoured and friendly. "She's doing it beautifully," =
Ethel thought. But she=20

pulled herself up. "Doing what beautifully? What do I mean? One would think=
 we were millionaires,=20

and Joe a perfect Adonis! Is she trying to eat us? And aren't you rather a =
snob, my love, to be so=20

ficate of qualification=20

as above provided. A person so offending shall be punished as provided in t=

art. 3,638).  If any person shall practise for pay or as a regular practiti=

branches or departments, or offer or attempt to practise medicine without f=

ical examiners, or=20

without having a diploma from some actual medical college chartered by the =
legislature of the=20

State, or its authority, in which the same is situated, he shall be punishe=
d by a fine of not less than=20

$50, nor more than $500 (Penal Code, art. 396).  Each patient visited or pr=

Fanny's talk of Paris=20

and Rome, or of New York. In each city Fanny seemed to have led very much t=
he same existence.=20

In each there had been Americans, and hotels, cafes and dances, motor trips=
 and lunches, gossip=20

and scandal without end. But she told of it all in a humorous way that made=
 it quite amusing. And it=20

was a good deal the same with the two women, Amy's friends, whom Fanny brou=
ght to tea a bit=20

later. Their gossip and their laughter, their voices breaking into each oth=
er and making a perfect=20

hubbub at times, their smart suits and hats and dainty boots, their plump f=
aces, lively eyes, all=20

were quite exciting to Ethel, when she threw off her hostility and the unea=
siness they aroused. It=20

felt good to be gossipy once more.  But how they chattered! How they stayed=
! Joe would be=20

coming home soon now, and she wanted them to go. But they did not go, and E=
thel guessed that=20
