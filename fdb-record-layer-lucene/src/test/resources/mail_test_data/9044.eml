allowed to set out for _
schools, who may read the skating episode in Wordsworth=E2=80=99s _Prelude_=
, but cannot get the shiver=20

of the ice or the scratch of the steel runners. Those who have been with us=
 for several generations=20

and who through economic or other causes have missed that rich acquaintance=
 with life which=20

would explain what the great writers talk about, are likely to join the mos=

for originality. Their fortunes none of her humility, and exhorting them to=

and the dauphin. For that night and the rest of her stay in Orleans she was=
 lodged with the wife of=20

the treasurer of Charles d'Orleans, and slept with one of the daughters of =
the house. Sturdy and=20

healthy as she was, the unaccustomed rough life of the camp, sleeping with =
her armor on and=20

none but men about her, had occasioned her great fatigue.]  The=20


_
be pitied, but their advice in art is hardly to be followed. No amount of s=
ympathy or admiration for=20

them as human beings will accredit them as critics, for art is long, as we =
have heard, and the=20

approaches to it are long also; though we may teach democracy fast enough t=
o win our vote after=20

five years, we must know at first-hand youth and maturity, and have a suspi=
cion of what old age is=20

like, in the world the poet writes of, before we can give a fair opinion wh=
ether he has written well.=20

But if the newcomer recovers here the adventure of life which his hardships=
 cheated him of in the=20

old country, he will find that the great literature of the world represents=
 that adventure faithfully and=20

vitally; it is merely a question of patience with him, since he is energeti=

day, May 8, 1429, Talbot and Suffolk led their army in retreat. As it was S=
unday, Jeanne let them=20

depart unmolested, but ere the last of the English columns had disappeared =
an altar was raised in=20

the plain and the holy maid was joined by her army and by the people of Orl=
eans in a Mass to=20

celebrate their deliverance.  It had taken nine days only for this courageo=
us and resolute girl to=20

undo months of work on the part of the English. Her steadfast faith in hers=
elf, her refusal to be=20

turned aside from her duty, had worked the miracle; and for it all she than=
ked God, and prayed for=20

support in what yet remained to do. To France, indeed, she seemed a miracle=
 herself; and learned=20

doctors of the Church undertook to prove, forsooth, that what she had done =
was of God, not of the=20


_
shadows in art of a life he has not yet lived will ever again take living f=
orm or pulse again in his=20

imagination.  A new world, a new life, a new art. This is the sequence his =
hopes dwell on, though=20

every term in it is debatable. Is there a new world, or a new life, or a ne=
w art? Sometimes we are=20

told that in a new world life must automatically be new, but the doctrine i=
s not convincing, for at=20

other times we are summoned to originality, as to another duty, by the argu=
ment that in a new=20

world we ought to be ashamed to lead still an old life. Sometimes we hear t=
hat a new life inevitably=20

means a new art, and we reflect that if life now differs from what it once =
was, we need take no=20

thought for our originality, for we shall be different in aloof from the de=
spised and discredited heir=20

of France began to ask themselves whether, after all, he were not the lawfu=
l ruler of France, since=20

God had sent this inspired leader of his armies.  Sweet is the savor of tri=
umph; to all who are=20

touched with ambition the mere joy of victory, with the homage of men and t=
he flattery that follow=20

in the train of victory, is so sweet that in vainglory they forget what yet=
 remains to be done. But in=20

Jeanne there was no ambition; she rejoiced and gave thanks to God that thro=
ugh her he had=20

saved Orleans; but the glory was God's, not hers. Orleans, too, was but the=
 first stage in her=20

career, of whose brief duration she warned her friends, and of whose tragic=
 end her earnest heart=20

may already have had some=20


_
ourselves; even by the old methods art will achieve something new; if we wo=
uld write of love, for=20

example, we need only tell the truth about the passion as we know it, and s=
ince the love we know=20

is like nothing that ever was on sea or land, our romance will be like noth=
ing that ever was in song=20

or story. Why all this fret about it? And if religion and war and sorrow an=
d death are all by=20

hypothesis quite other than they once were, how can we escape originality w=
hen we report them in=20

the setting of the new world and the new life? But the fact is that those w=
ho call for originality in art=20

are not quite sure, forebodings. "You must use me quickly," she said, "for =
I shall last but one year."=20

In that brief year there was much to be accomplished: yet for long she was =
compelled to rest, or to=20

fret, while timid or selfish advisers held back the dauphin from granting h=
er prayer to be allowed to=20

march at once to Rheims. With practically all the intervening country in th=
e hands of the English,=20

such a march seemed the extreme of folly. It would be risking too much for =
the empty ceremony of=20

consecrating the dauphin at Rheims. But to Jeanne that consecration was the=
 one thing needed to=20

complete her share in the rehabilitation=20

a new one=E2=80=94they would feel safer if some further vestiges of the pas=
t could be obliterated; and=20

though they justify a new art by speaking much of their new life, it is far=
 from clear that they really=20

think life is new, or at heart desire it to be so. Social and political sys=
tems, yes=E2=80=94but life? Horrible=20

indeed is the vision of an absolutely original career for one who loves his=
 fellows and prefers to=20

take his experience outside a madhouse. =E2=80=9CYour prayer is answered,=
=E2=80=9D says the original Apollo,=20

touching the original poet=E2=80=99s ears, trembling with originality: =E2=
=80=9Cyou will have always a new cadence=20

and a new idea; neither the language nor the thing which her celestial guar=
dians now insisted on=20

her undertaking, and for which they promised her their support. Moreover, t=
he English were=20

already demoralized, filled with fear of this "witch," for whom they had no=
thing but words of=20

contempt that only veneered their hearty dread of her. Whether witch or mer=
e woman, they feared=20

the influence of this Jeanne upon French imagination; and as aliens in the =
land, they exaggerated=20

the danger of a sudden wave of national feeling that would sweep them from =
France, while they=20

saw disaffection on all sides. All this the French captains could not, of c=
ourse, have known; but=20

they should have=20
