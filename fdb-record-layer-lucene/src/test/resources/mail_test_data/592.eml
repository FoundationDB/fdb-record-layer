and let people know that you have eggs to sell for hatching, you will probably have orders for all 

the eggs that you will care to sell.         *       *       *       *       *  Another correspondent wants to 

know the meaning of the word "strain," as applied to fowls, and I don't wonder that he asks the 

question, for the word is used "promiscuous like" by every tyro in poultry breeding.  When any 

poultry-raiser has bred fowls of any breed long enough to fix his notion of what constitutes a 

standard fowl of that breed upon them permanently, he may claim a "strain." For instance: Smith 

believes that the Light Brahmas should have very short legs, and he breeds for short legs until 

they are permanently fixed, and everybody who knows anything about Light Brahmas knows one 

of Smith's short-legged Brahmas at sight; then, but not before, Smith may claim a strain of his 

own, and it is proper for others to speak of "Smith's strain" of Light Brahmas. But Johnson, who 

buys of Smith, or of some one who has Light Brahmas of Smith's strain, this year, should not next 

year talk about "my own strain" of Light Brahmas. It takes years of steady, judicious breeding after 

a certain type to establish what may truthfully be called a strain, and it can only be done by 

breeders of rare skill and long  6. Heated by the blow-pipe on charcoal, it was instantly volatilized 

in part, and in part decomposed, with an almost explosive effervescence; numerous ignited 

globules of metal appeared on the charcoal, and burned with an abundant flame of a delicate blue 

colour, edged occasionally with green.  7. In many trials, these results always occurred, and 

sometimes a peculiar odour was perceived, at first thought to be owing to arsenic, but it was 

incomparably feebler, and somewhat resembled that of radishes.[72]  8. Zinc, iron, and tin, 

plunged into separate portions of the nitro-muriatic solution, precipitated abundantly a black 

flocculent substance.  9. On charcoal before the blow-pipe, this substance was very combustible, 

with a blue flame, and was completely dissipated in the form of white oxyd, with the above smell. 

10. Some of it was obtained on the charcoal in metallic globules; it was a brittle metal, white, with 

a tinge of red, and foliated, but not so distinctly as bismuth and antimony.  11. The filters on which 

the white oxyd had been deposited, burned almost with explosion, nearly as rapidly as if they had 

been soaked with nitrate of potash, or of ammonia, and the characteristic blue flame appeared 

while the burning lasted.  12. Other experiments were made upon the metal, (not the oxyd.) It gave 

to strong sulphuric acid, (simply by standing in it in the cold) an amethystine

FANNY FIELD.     Chicken Houses.   I often read inquiries about the best plan for building hen 

houses. My plan is, for 100 fowls, to build a house for them to roost in, eight or even ten feet wide 

and sixteen feet long, one story high with tight floor of yellow pine flooring. I prefer a tight floor 

because it is easily cleaned out, and every time it is cleaned out and swept the floor should be well 

covered with slaked lime; one cleaning a week is often enough.  A building of the same size 

should be built with a dirt floor, or close one, as preferred, about ten or fifteen feet from the 

weaker, by attracting water from the air.  13. With nitric acid it formed a colourless solution, not 

decomposed by water.  14. It did not dissolve in muriatic acid, till a few drops of nitric acid were 

added.  15. The white oxyd heated with charcoal in a small coated recurved glass tube, afforded 

brilliant metallic globules, which rose by distillation, collected in the bend of the tube, and 

resembled drops of quicksilver, except that they were solid.   C. REMARK.  The above facts 

having induced the conclusion that the metal, thus unexpectedly discovered in the ores of 

tungsten, was

the hens to lay and sit in. A petition may be made of laths dividing the house into two 

compartments, the front arranged for the laying hens and the back compartments for sitting hens; 

then the laying hens will not disturb the sitting hens. A closed passway should be made, say one 

and one half or two feet square leading from the roosting house to the laying house with a sliding 

door at each end to be used at pleasure. As it often happens in cold, snowy we were led to search 

for external characters by which to judge what specimens contained it. The ores from 

Transylvania, (the only telluric ores with which we are acquainted,) bearing no analogy in 

appearance or composition to those before us, we were led to inquire whether the tellurium in 

these latter ores was _in combination_ with tungsten, or merely _in mixture_. The external 

characters detailed in part II, tend perhaps to fortify the latter opinion. If
