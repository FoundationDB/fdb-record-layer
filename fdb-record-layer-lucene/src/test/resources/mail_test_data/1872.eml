abandoning the very garb of their priestly estate." He proceeded to say tha=
t only deplorable=20

consequences could result from the surrender of the curacies entirely to th=
e native priests; and=20

that the religious of the orders must be employed therein, unless they coul=
d be supplied with=20

properly qualified secular priests who were Spaniards. The same ideas were =
expressed by the=20

municipal council of Manila, who said of the native priests: "The weak and =
yielding disposition=20

which has been for so long a time noticed in these islanders does not permi=
t in them that=20

steadfastness which is so proper for the priestly character and the difficu=
lt office of the care of=20

souls."  "In June, 1805, the Frenchman Flix Renouard de Sainte-Croix was co=
mmissioned to=20

examine the gold mines in Mambulao (in Camarines); and in his report he exp=
lained that various=20

gold mines existed there, with very rich veins, but some were difficult to =
develop and others had=20

been abandoned. By royal order of July 5, 1805, was decreed the total indep=
endence of the=20

Manila custom-house, ordaining that its manager should be under the immedia=
te orders of the=20

[treasury] superintendent." [1] On December 20, 1806, Aguilar created a Bur=
eau of Vaccination at=20

Manila, of which he was president; and regulations were made for public vac=
cination, which had a=20

marked effect in diminishing the ravages of the smallpox. This governor gav=
e much attention to=20

the construction of public works, one of the more important of these being =
the highway from=20

Manila to Cavite. He caused the streets of the capital to be lighted at pub=
lic expense, and paved=20

sidewalks to be built, and made the police system more efficient; he also d=
id much to promote=20

domestic industries.  Aguilar endeavored, throughout his term of office, to=
 check the incursions of=20

the Moros. The pirates attacked even the coasts of Luzn in 1793, and an exp=
edition sent out=20

against them in December of that year accomplished almost nothing, being to=
o late and=20

ineffective. In the following year the governor called a council of the lea=
ding military officers and=20

other persons experienced in Moro wars and the affairs of the southern isla=
nds, where it was=20

shown that the Moros made captive some 500 persons a year, whom they render=
ed slaves--

excepting the old, who "were sold to the food; they had looked after sanita=
tion and hospitals and=20

morgues; they had accomplished much in the way of opening the streets and c=
learing the=20

properties of filth and debris deposited by the flood. They had been the mi=
nisters not only of the=20

charities of the twin cities, Alleghany and Pittsburg, but of other and mor=
e distant cities. These,=20

recognizing the integrity and efficiency of the Pittsburg committee, direct=
ed their benefactions to=20

them, with the request that they would control their administration. A tota=
l of $831,295 passed into=20

their hands; of this $560,000 was turned over to the Flood Commission, the =
balance having been=20

expended by themselves. Of this total, $250,770 was contributed by the citi=
es of Pittsburgh and=20

Alleghany.  In the ladies=E2=80=99 committee, Pittsburg developed another a=
gency that was vastly=20

beneficial. Established in rooms of the Second Presbyterian church, they be=
gan work on the 4th of=20

June, and their doors thereafter were open day and night. A special committ=
ee was always on=20

duty and waiting to receive every train, both of the Baltimore & Ohio and t=
he Pennsylvania Roads.=20

These brought scores and hundreds of refugees who had lost everything, and =
who did not doubt=20

that in Pittsburg, at the hands of people they had never seen, they would r=
eceive sympathy and=20

aid. They were met at the depots, conducted to the rooms of the committee, =
fed and clothed, and=20

sent to comfortable quarters till they could see a way to provide for thems=
elves. Many were=20

seeking homes in the country or cities beyond, and the railways generously =
furnished free=20

transportation to all who were certified by the ladies=E2=80=99 committee. =
Situations were procured for=20



many, and many fragments of families, seeking permanent homes in Pittsburg,=
 were aided even to=20

the anticipation of their winter supplies.  Philadelphia has long been an e=
xample to other cities, in=20

that it has had a permanent committee of relief, ever ready with men and me=
ans to answer the call=20

of some unusual distress. At the announcement of the great calamity, this c=
ommittee was at once=20

summoned by the mayor. R. M. McWade, city editor of the _Public Ledger_,  [=
Illustration:=20

CONEMAUGH VIADUCT.]  a gentleman who had raised $25,000 and sped with it to=
 Charleston,=20

South Carolina, at the time of the earthquake, was present, and=20


_
these captives to the shades of their deceased relatives or of prominent pe=
rsonages, [2]=20

preserving the skull of the victim as a proof that they had complied with s=
o barbarous a usage." It=20

was shown at this council that during the time from the establishment of th=
e vintas in 1778 until the=20

end of 1793 the colony had spent the sum of 1,519,209 pesos fuertes for ves=
sels, expeditions,=20

wages, etc., in the warfare with the Moros, to say nothing of the losses an=
d destruction caused by=20

the pirate raids. The council resolved to abolish the present equipment of =
vintas and pancos,=20

replacing these by lanchas carrying cannon, in six divisions of six lanchas=
 and one panco each,=20

with extra pay and honors to the crews; and to repair and strengthen all th=
e forts on the coasts=20

liable to attack. Aguilar attempted to open negotiations for peace with the=
 Moro sultans; but these=20

had no effect, the piracies still continuing. In the summer of 1794, a Port=
uguese trader of Manila=20

who had carried goods to Jol was treacherously attacked on his return, when=
 near Iloilo, by the=20

same Moros with whom he had traded at Jol; but he defended his vessel brave=
ly, and one of the=20

leading dattos of Jol was killed in the fray. In August, 1795, two vessels =
of the Spanish royal navy=20

arrived at Manila, with tidings that the English, again at war with Spain, =
were planning to occupy=20

the Filipinas Islands; this compelled Aguilar to desist from further procee=
dings against the Moros,=20

for the time. It was hoped that lava and his powerful squadron (who remaine=
d at Manila during=20

1797-1802) might chastise the Moros, but nothing was accomplished in this d=
irection--either=20

through fear of another the appropriation of $5,000, saying that when the f=
acts should become=20

known, ten times the sum would be required. Others did not wait for organiz=
ed effort, but hastened=20

with medicines, surgical instruments, shoes and carloads of prepared food--=
bread, butter, bacon,=20

cheese, coffee--to the field of disaster. Personal contributions were many =
and liberal. On the 11th=20

of June the committee placed $500,000 subject to the order of Governor Beav=
er. As late as the=20

4th of August the committee was induced through Dr. Pancoast to appropriate=
 $10,000 to the Red=20

Cross Hospital in Johnstown. Philadelphia is truly a city of =E2=80=9Cbroth=
erly love.=E2=80=9D Newsboys and=20

bootblacks anxiously offered their mites; and in the penitentiary hundreds =
of convicts gave eagerly=20

of the hard-earned pennies gained by working extra time, till the warden pl=
aced a limit upon the=20

amount each might give. The total contributions of Philadelphia amounted to=
 nearly $800,000.=20

New York went promptly to work on the 2nd of June. The churches beginning. =
Monday, the 3d,=20

liberal contributions were placed in the hands of a committee, by individua=
ls and corporations. The=20

poor or bad boys in the charity and reform schools were an example to many,=
 for they of their=20

penury cast in all that they had. The boys in the House of Refuge on Randal=
l=E2=80=99s Island, gave=20

$258.22. Perhaps such lads may be yet worth saving.  The total amount contr=
ibuted by the City of=20

New York was very close to $1,000,000.  Boston gave upwards of $500,000, Ch=
icago about=20

$200,000, Baltimore gave liberally, and received and cared for a multitude =
of refugees. Fifteen=20

hundred rendered homeless by floods at Johnstown and elsewhere arrived in=
=20


_
because of the disagreements between Aguilar and lava. [3] On January 21, 1=
798, two English=20

ships attacked the Spanish post at Zamboanga, but were bravely repulsed wit=
h much damage to=20

the invaders. In that year a strong force of Moros attacked the village of =
Baler and others inland=20

from the eastern coast of Luzn [where now is the province of Principe], con=
stituting the oldtime=20

missions of Ituy; they devastated these towns, and seized four hundred and =
fifty captives, among=20

them three parish curas, one of whom was sold by them for 2,500 pesos. Thes=
e pirates were=20

established in Buras Island for four years, from which center they harried =
the neighboring coasts.=20

In 1799, the authorities decided that it was more expedient that the warfar=
e with the Moros be=20

carried on by the provincial authorities, with the direction and aid of the=
 central government; and=20

instructions to this effect were sent to all the alcaldes-mayor. In 1800  W=
e may not detail further.=20

The reader who desires the fullest account of what was done, and how, and b=
y whom, must be=20

referred to Dr. Beale=E2=80=99s most interesting book. It may suffice in th=
is place to say, that contributions=20

were forwarded, not only from the principal cities and from every State in =
the Union, but from=20

foreign countries. Ireland sent $18,252.21; England, $33,158.36; Canada, $4=
,454.64; Mexico,=20

$130.40; Turkey, $876.57; Italy, $9.46; Austria, $481.70; Germany, $34,199.=
36; Prussia, $100;=20

Wales, $68.60; Saxony, $2,637.20; Persia, $50; France, $24,511.13; Australi=
a, $1,251.12. Total,=20

$120,187.79. These figures prove that there are men everywhere who love the=
ir fellow men, and=20

that the whole world is of kin.  The total loss in the Conemaugh valley was=
 between $8,000,000=20

and $9,000,000; the total bestowment about $3,000,000. The loss of life is =
estimated variously;=20

from 4,000 to 10,000. It will never be definitely known.=20
