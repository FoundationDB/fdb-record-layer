not the Honorable Senator who drew the bamboo _portieres_ aside and entered=

said, taking the easy chair at the opposite corner of the fireplace where a=
 tiny wood fire was=20

blazing in deference to the chill of the approaching autumn. "Did we bore y=

 the Baltic Sea from=20

the deck of a ship of the British navy. The whole English fleet, consisting=
 of nineteen sail, distant=20

thirty miles from the point of observation, were seen up in the air, upside=

seven million years ago, I can't somehow seem to galvanize a very active in=

asked, and he hoped that the sympathy in her tone was personal rather than =
