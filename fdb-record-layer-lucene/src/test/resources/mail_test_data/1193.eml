in a year. They are as follows: 50 tons cast steel, 40 tons German steel, 1=
00 tons Pittsburgh steel,=20

75 tons castings, 200 tons wrought iron, 8 tons malleable castings in clevi=
ses, etc. In addition=20

100,000 plow bolts and 200,000 feet of oak plank were used.  These figures =

 bed of the river. The=20

shore, which appears dry to us, imbibes water as far up as to the level of =
the surface of the river.=20

 time that the Indians=20

the metal used was iron rather than steel. Steel accounts for 190 tons; wro=

Although it is conceivable, under this weight distribution, that the shares=
 and moldboards were=20

made of steel while the landsides and standards were made of wrought iron, =
other distributions=20

are also possible, and it is quite conceivable that at this period some of =
the plows had steel=20

moldboards while others had wrought-iron ones. An analysis of the metal in =
different parts of an=20

this, but from these=20

calculation. The increase of these losses would be in proportion to the len=
