poursuivants, and kings at arms, who, from their office, must have been app=
ointed judges of the=20

lists, or assistants, at such entertainments and pastimes. For greater secu=
rity, it was always more=20

than a year after any event had happened, before he began to arrange his ma=
terials and insert=20

them in his chronicle. He waited until time should have destroyed what may =
have been coroner=20

may be classed under the head of coroners _virtute electionis_. Generally s=
peaking the coroner is=20

a county officer.   CORONER=E2=80=99S DUTIES BOTH JUDICIAL AND MINISTERIAL.=
  By the common=20

law his powers and duties are both judicial and ministerial. In his ministe=
rial capacity he is merely=20

a substitute for the sheriff, as when the sheriff is a party.[511] His powe=
rs and duties=20


_
confirmed their truth.  =E2=80=98An infinite number of traits throughout hi=
s work proves the fidelity of his=20

narration. He marks the difference between facts of which he is perfectly s=
ure and those of which=20

he is doubtful: if he cannot produce his proof, he says so, and does not ad=
vance more. When he=20

thinks that he has omitted some details which he ought to have known, he fr=
ankly owns that he=20

has forgotten them. For instance, when speaking of the conversation between=
 the duke of=20

Burgundy and the Pucelle d=E2=80=99Orl=C3=A9ans, at which he was present, h=
e recollects that some=20

circumstances have escaped his memory, and avows that he does not remember =
them.  =E2=80=98When=20

after having related any event, he gains further knowledge concerning it, h=
e immediately informs=20

his readers of it, and either adds to or retrenches from his former narrati=
on, conformably to the last=20

information he had received. judicial authority relates to inquiries into c=
ases of sudden death, by a=20

jury of inquest, _super visum corporis_, or, as it is more commonly defined=
, an inquisition, with the=20

assistance of a jury, over the body of any person who may have come to a su=
dden or violent=20

death, or who may have died in prison.[512] It is not necessary that the de=
ath should be both=20

violent and sudden, and that both these circumstances must concur to give t=
he coroner=20

jurisdiction. It is sufficient to give the coroner jurisdiction if the deat=
h occurs from any violence=20

done to a person by another, although such violence may not have terminated=
 the life of a party=20

suddenly, and it is still the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest.[513] =
Indeed the presumption is=20

that he has acted in good faith and on sufficient cause.[514] And so when s=
everal persons have=20

been suddenly killed by the same violent=20


_
Montaigne praises him for it. =E2=80=98The good Froissart,=E2=80=99 says he=
, =E2=80=98proceeds in his undertaking with such=20

frank simplicity that having committed a mistake he is no way afraid of own=
ing it, and of correcting=20

it at the moment he is sensible of it.=E2=80=99[5] We ought certainly to fe=
el ourselves obliged to these two=20

writers for their attention in returning back to correct any mistakes; but =
we should have been more=20

thankful to them if they had been pleased to add their corrections to the a=
rticles which had been=20

mistated, instead of scattering their amendments at hazard, as it were, and=
 leaving the readers to=20

connect and compare them with the original article as well as they can.  =
=E2=80=98This is not the only defect=20

common to both these historians. The greater part of the chronological mist=
akes, which have been=20

so ably corrected by M. de Sainte Palaye in Froissart, are to be found in M=
onstrelet; and what=20

deserves particularly to be noticed, to avoid falling into errors, is, that=
 circumstances proper to be=20

inquired of by a coroner=E2=80=99s inquest, it is proper and necessary for =
the coroner, acting in good faith,=20

to hold a separate inquest over each body.[515] A coroner=E2=80=99s inquest=
 is a judicial investigation. The=20

coroner cannot delegate his authority to any one. Neither can he appoint a =
deputy under the=20

common law. He must act in person as any other judicial officer; and it may=
 safely be said that a=20

coroner has no power to appoint a deputy coroner, except where special prov=
ision is made=20

therefor by statute.[516] In England, a coroner=E2=80=99s court is a court =
of record, and it has accordingly=20

been held that trespass cannot be maintained for turning a person out of a =
room where the=20

coroner is about to take an inquisition.[517] But in this country, it may s=
afely be said that a=20

coroner=E2=80=99s court is not one of record, but of inferior jurisdiction.=
[518] The performance of the=20

functions of a coroner are judicial in their character; so judicial that he=
 is=20

thout ever mentioning it,=20

and intermix them in the same chapter, as if they had taken place in the sa=
me period,=E2=80=94but=20

Monstrelet has the advantage of Froissart in the correctness of counting th=
e years, which he=20

invariably begins on protected under the principles which protect judicial =
officers from=20

responsibility in a civil action brought by a private person. His proceedin=
gs amount to entries=20

concerning matters of public interest, made under the sanction of an offici=
al oath, and in=20

compliance or presumed compliance of the law.[519]=20
