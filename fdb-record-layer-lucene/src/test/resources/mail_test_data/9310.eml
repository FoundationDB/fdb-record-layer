philodendron monstera of Antigone. She was betrothed to the son of the king=
 who condemned her to death, and the fact proves tragic for the son and for=
 the king, but the love of the two young people is their private business, =
and the poet therefore does do not go; for the kingdom shall be and remain =

lives of others with our own. A poet who presents experience from this angl=
e of individuality will=20

always make a strong initial appeal and perhaps a lasting one, since he fal=
ls in with our instincts,=20

and this accord will seem to us evidence of something profound. Such a poet=
, to some extent, was=20

Euripides, who imagined his characters sympathetically from their private p=
oints of view, and=20

portrayed for us the egotism of human nature in its most tragic form. It is=
 not fair to say that in his=20

world men and women need only to explain themselves in order to be right; b=
ut, at least, after they=20

have explained themselves it is hard to tell who are right and who are wron=
g. Such another poet is=20

Browning, who represents human nature one individual at a time, always from=
 the individual=E2=80=99s=20

point of view. By such a simple and primitive method he obtains effects of =
obvious richness=E2=80=94he=20

shows how varied life is, since there are so many individuals in it, and ho=
w novel it perpetually=20

must be, since each of us is discovering the world for the first time, and =
how much right there is in=20

every man=E2=80=99s cause, once he has the chance to speak for himself. If =
we had all the works of=20

Euripides, we should probably find in them as rich and varied a world as Br=
owning=E2=80=99s, expressed=20

with clearer and more direct poetic genius. Our contemporary taste is rathe=
r solidly for this kind of=20

literature=E2=80=94Browning flourishes more and more, and Euripides has bee=
n revived; and if you really=20

approve of the individualistic approach to art, it is hard to see how you c=
an call anything indecent.=20

Anything that is natural to any kind of character must get a hearing.  But =
men can also be=20

imaginative enough to look at life as a whole=E2=80=94first, perhaps, to lo=
ok out at all other men, and then=20

to stand off and look at all men, oneself included. When you begin to take =
an interest in other men,=20

you notice of course that their lives are not like yours, not so important =
nor interesting nor=20

promising, but in their drabness they are all curiously alike; they all, wi=
th slight variation, are born,=20

are brought up, fall in love according to their lights, marry, earn their l=
iving, have children, grow=20

old, and die. When this uniformity begins to interest you, you are making y=
our first intelligent=20

acquaintance with life; and when you have looked at mankind and included yo=
urself in the picture,=20

when you have admitted however reluctantly that the single addition does no=
t change the total=20

effect, that life is still simple and uniform and that you are less peculia=
r than you thought=E2=80=94then you=20

have seen yourself at last as one of the human race.  To see this calls for=
 imagination and for the=20

Greek virtue which we translate as magnanimity=E2=80=94great-mindedness. Th=
e virtue is not to be=20

acquired all at once. We have made a great advance when we can think of lif=
e in terms not of=20

ourselves but of moral and material aspects and powers=E2=80=94in terms of =
youth and age, for example,=20

of strength or beauty or pride. This is the allegorical stage of our pilgri=
mage in wisdom, no mean=20

stage to reach, though it happens to be out of fashion just now. We are acq=
uainted with it in the=20

old morality plays, especially in the almost popular _Everyman_, and perhap=
s in =C3=86schylus,=20

especially in _Prometheus Bound_.  But our advance is greatest when we can =
recognize these=20

aspects and powers in the individuals around us=E2=80=94when our observatio=
n includes at one and the=20

same time the general truths of life and the particular instances. The poet=
 pre=C3=ABminently master of=20

this sane wisdom was Sophocles, who, in Arnold=E2=80=99s familiar phrase, s=
aw life steadily and saw it=20

whole. The point of view which he represented is the most magnanimous, the =
least egotistical, that=20

art has yet taken, and one would have to think meanly of the race to believ=
e that we shall not=20

return to it, as to the noblest part of the Greek legacy. But Sophocles was=
 only the illustration of a=20

decorum assistance thus sent by God himself. Crowds of people, gentles and =
mere laborers,=20

visited Jeanne, and all were sure of one thing at least, that she was a goo=
d girl, while many went=20



away firm believers in her mission. A gentleman, Jean de Metz, thinking to =
jest with her, said:=20

"Well, sweetheart, then we must all turn English, since the King will be dr=
iven out of France." But=20

there was no thought of jest in her, as she complained of Baudricourt's ref=
usal to send her to the=20

dauphin: "And yet they must get me to the Dauphin before Mid-Lent, were I t=
o wear out my legs to=20

the knees walking there. For no one in this world, kings, nor dukes, nor da=
ughter of the king of=20

Scotland, can win back the kingdom of France; and there is for him no other=
 help save in me,=20

albeit I should far rather stay beside my poor mother and spin.... For this=
 is not my work, fighting=20

battles; but I needs must go to do that which is commanded, for my Lord so =
wills it."  Baudricourt=20

hesitated to assume the responsibility of any action in the matter. He took=
 Jeanne to see the old=20

Duke de Lorraine, his feudal superior. Duke Charles, at that time under the=
 domination of a=20

mistress, Alison du May, of great wit and beauty, was ill, and thought the =
miraculous maiden of=20

Domremy might restore him to health and the arms of Alison. Jeanne, very wi=
sely and frankly, told=20

him to put away his paramour and take back his wife and lead a decent life.=
 She was no worker of=20

vulgar miracles to profit a worn-out old roue.  Coming back to Vaucouleurs,=
 she found the=20

authorities more ready to give her a hearing, for the situation in Orleans =
had become desperate,=20

and the gallant citizens, who had entered into the siege with as much eager=
ness as if it had been=20

but play, found enthusiasm very exhausting and food supplies very scant. Je=
anne had predicted=20

the date and the disastrous result of the battle of Rouvray, "the battle of=
 the Herrings" (February=20

12, 1429), and the people of Vaucouleurs believed in her. Grudgingly and ha=
lf-heartedly, the Sire=20

de Baudricourt was compelled to yield to her request and to despatch her to=
 the dauphin. Some=20

citizens of the town subscribed a sum to equip her with horse and armor, an=
d the Sire de=20

Baudricourt himself gave her a sword. For the long journey through a rough =
country the poor girl,=20

with no woman companion, could not retain her simple gown, but must be dres=
sed as a man-at-

arms. On the very eve of her departure, she was subjected to another severe=
 trial to her feelings:=20

her parents, hearing of her determination, sent to implore, to command, her=
 not to go; and Jeanne,=20

unable to write, had to dictate a letter asking their forgiveness for her d=
isobedience.  Her little=20

troop, consisting of two gentlemen and a few men of their following, had to=
 traverse part of the=20

country where the Burgundian interest was strong, for the dauphin was then =
holding his court at=20

Chinon, near Tours. And the dangers of the road infested by hostile troops =
were not the only=20

dangers, for among her own companions there were many misgivings: they knew=
 not whether to=20

reverence her as a saint or to destroy her as a witch. The latter course, i=
ndeed, they were very=20

near pursuing; but the innocence and the harmless, hopeful, confident demea=
nor of the girl moved=20

their hearts to pity.  She arrived at Chinon on February 24th, and sent wor=
d to Charles that she=20

had much to tell him that would comfort his heart, and that she had come on=
e hundred and fifty=20

leagues to see him; but Charles had no will of his own, and his councillors=
 wrangled about what=20

should be done. There was a strong party opposed to Jeanne, but her friends=
, headed by Queen=20

Yolande, carried the day, and she was admitted to see the king, or, as she =
continued to call him=20

until after the consecration at Rheims, the dauphin. The story of how this =
country maiden was=20

introduced into the throng of dazzling courtiers and left to divine which=
=20


_
magnificent period which left us our greatest perfection in the arts, the A=
thenians thought of the=20

individual as important if he illustrated for the moment the general truths=
 or fortunes of life, but his=20

strictly private fate was insignificant.  This attitude has been explained =
by saying that the Greeks,=20

having no gift for introspection, took always an objective view of life, bu=
t such a formula hardly=20

accounts for all the illustrations of magnanimity. When Athens was in her g=
lory, for example, it was=20

only the public buildings that were glorious; no individual, not even Peric=
les himself, thought of=20

putting Phidias to decorate his private home. Again, in the _Antigone_ Soph=
ocles is introspective=20

enough=E2=80=94as introspective as Euripides or Ibsen himself=E2=80=94but t=
he introspection is concerned with=20

the general theme of piety, of one=E2=80=99s duty to blood relations, not a=
t all with the of the Lord has been=20

too often told, and too generally credited, to need either retelling or def=
ence; the whole story of=20

Jeanne d'Arc is so little short of what we would call miraculous that it se=
ems a petty thing to balk at=20

this one detail. Whether by divine inspiration, or by mere luck, or by the =
friendly and secret=20

guidance of her followers, Jeanne did discover Charles, and spoke without f=
ear as she knelt at the=20

feet of this unworthy prince whom she had come so far to save: "Gentle Daup=
hin, I am called=20

Jeanne la Pucelle; the King of Heaven sends you word by me that you shall b=
e consecrated and=20

crowned in the city of Rheims, and that you shall be his lieutenant in Fran=
ce. Give me, therefore,=20

soldiers, that I may raise the siege of Orleans and take you to Rheims to b=
e consecrated. It is=20

God's will that your enemies, the English, shall go back to their own land;=
 and woe=20
