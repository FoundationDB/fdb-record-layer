philodendron monstera run towards the river and had not come back; so the f=
riends, with their strange find, hurried on to the public road and crossed =
the bridge at the creek, turning off into the orchard path that led up to t=
he Red Mill.  "What's your name?" demanded Tom of the strange boy.  But all=
 the latter could do was to chatter and shake his head. The icy water had b=
itten into his very bones. They fairly excitement that makes you speak so."=
  "Not excitement, but deliverance," said Lady Car with solemnity. "Yes, mo=
ther, you are right; I should have stood to the end; but do you think that =
would have been a credit to me? Oh, you don't know how hard falsehood is! F=
alsehood and slavery--they are the same thing; they make your heart like ir=

What's your name?" demanded Tom of the strange boy.  But all the latter cou=
ld do was to chatter and shake his head. The icy water had bitten into his =
very bones. They fairly excitement that makes you speak so."  "Not exciteme=

could barely stir the stump. Suddenly they heard a struggle going on inside=
 the hollow shell; as=20

well, a thumping on the thin partition of wood and a muffled sound of shout=
ing.  "He's alive--the=20

water hasn't filled the hollow," cried Ruth. "Oh, Tom! we must do something=
."  "And I'd like to know=20

what?" demanded that youth, in great perturbation.  The stump rested on the=
 shore, but was half=20

submerged in the water for most of its length. The unfortunate person impri=
soned in the hollow=20

part of the tree-trunk must be partly submerged in the water, too. Had the =
farther end of the stump=20

not rested on a rock, it would have plunged to the bottom of the creek and =
the victim of the=20

accident must certainly have been drowned.  "Why don't he crawl out? Why do=
n't he crawl out?"=20

cried Ruth, anxiously.  "How's he going to do it?" sputtered Tom.  "Can't h=
e dive down into the=20

water through the hole in the tree and so come up outside?" demanded the gi=
rl from the Red Mill,=20

irritably. "I never saw such a fellow!"  Whether this referred to Tom, or t=
o the unknown, the former=20

did not know. But he recognized immediately the good sense in Ruth's sugges=
tion. Tom leaped=20

out upon the log and stamped upon it. Helen screamed:  "You'll go into the =
creek, too, Tom!"  "No,=20

I won't," he replied.  "Then you'll make the stump fall in entirely and the=
 man will be drowned."=20

"No, I won't do that, either," muttered Master Tom.  He stamped upon the wo=
oden shell again. A=20

faint halloo answered him, and the knocking on the inner side of the hollow=
 tree was repeated.=20

"Come out! Come out!" shouted Tom, "Dive down through the water and get out=
. You'll be=20

suffocated there."  But at first the prisoner seemed not to understand--or =
else was afraid to make=20

the attempt.  "Oh, if I only had an axe!" groaned Master Tom.  "If you cut =
into that tree you might=20

do some damage," said his sister, now so much interested in the prisoner th=
at she got up and=20

came near.  Ruth saw Helen's red cap high up on the bank and she scrambled =
up and got it,=20

stuffing it under her coat again.  "We'll keep _that_ out of sight," she sa=
id.  "If it in her eyes no=20

ritual could have been more imposing. There were a great many of the attend=
ants who thought it=20

was "just Poppery," and a most dangerous beginning; but they were all hushe=
d and reverential=20

while the minister's voice went on.  When every one had left, and the house=
 was perfectly silent=20

after the hum and sound of so many feet, Lady Car herself went forward to t=
he window and drew=20

up the blind which covered it. The gloom disappeared, and the noonday sunsh=
ine streamed in in a=20

moment. It was premature, and Lady Lindores was grieved that she had not be=
en quick enough to=20

forestall her daughter; for it would have been better, she thought, if her =
hand had been the first to=20

let in the light, and not that of the new-made widow. Carry went further, a=
nd opened the window.=20

She stepped out upon the heavy stone balcony outside, and received the ligh=
t full upon her,=20

raising her head to it, and basking in the sunshine. She opened her pale li=
ps to draw in great=20

draughts of the sweet autumn air, and threw up her arms to the sunshine and=
 to the sky. Lady=20

Lindores stepped out after her, laying her hand upon her arm, with some ala=
rm. "Carry--my=20

darling, wait a little----" Carry did not make any reply. She said, "How lo=
ng is it, mother?" still=20

looking up into the clear depths of the sky. "How long is what, my love?" T=
hey were a strange=20

group. A spectator might have thought that the pale creature in the midst, =
so ethereal, so wan,=20

wrapped in mourning so profound, had gone distraught with care; while her c=
hild at her feet sat on=20

the carpet in front of the window, the emblem of childish indifference, pla=
ying with her new shoes,=20

which glittered and pleased her; and the two attendant figures, the anxious=
 mother and sister, kept=20

watch behind. In Carry the mystery all centred; and even those two who were=
 nearest to her were=20

bewildered, and could not make her out. Was she an Ophelia, moved out of he=
r sweet wits by an=20



anguish beyond bearing? Was she a woman repentant, appealing to heaven for =
forgiveness?=20

Carry was none of these things. She who had been so dutiful all her life, r=
esisting=20


_
wouldn't have chased us in the first place."  But all of them were thinking=
 mainly of the person in=20

the hollow of the old stump. How could they get this person out?  And the a=
nswer to that question=20

was not so easily found--as Tom had observed. They could not roll the stump=
 over; they had no=20

means of cutting through to the prisoner. But, suddenly, that individual se=
ttled the question without=20

their help. There was a struggle under the log, a splashing of the water, a=
nd then a figure bobbed=20

up out of the shallows.  Ruth screamed and seized it before it fell back ag=
ain. It was a boy-- a thin,=20

miserable-looking, dripping youth, no older than requirements to the letter=
, bearing the burden of=20

all her responsibilities without rebellion or murmur, had ceased in a momen=
t to consider outside=20

necessities, even the decorum of her sorrowful condition. She gave a long s=
igh, dismissing, as it=20

were, a weight from her breast. "It is five years and a half," she said. "I=
 ought to remember, I that=20

have counted every day,--and now is it possible, is it possible?"  "What, m=
y dearest? Carry, come=20

in; you are excited----"  "Not yet, mother. How soft the air is! and the su=
nshine flooding everything.=20

I have been shut up so long. I think the colours never were so lovely befor=
e."  "Yes, my darling;=20


_
with wild, burning eyes looking out of his wet and pallid face. Had it not =
been for Ruth and Tom he=20

must have fallen back into the stream again, he was so weak.  They dragged =
him ashore, and he=20

fell down, shaking and chattering, on the edge of the creek. He was none to=
o warmly dressed at=20

the best; the water now fast congealed upon his clothing. His garments woul=
d soon be as stiff as=20

boards.  "We've got to get him to the Mill, girls," declared Tom. "Come! ge=
t up!" he cried to the=20

stranger. "You must get warmed and have dry clothing."  "And something hot =
to drink," said Ruth.=20

"Aunt Alviry will make him something that will take the cold out of his bon=
es."  The strange boy=20

stared at them, unable, it seemed, to speak a word. They dragged him uprigh=
t you are glad of the=20

fresh air."  "A week!" Carry said. "Five years: I have got no good of the s=
unshine, and never tasted=20

the sweetness of the air, for five years. Let me feel it now. Oh, how have =
I lived all this time! What=20

a beautiful country it is! what a glorious sky! and I have been in prison, =
and have never seen them!=20

Is it true? is it all over?--all, all?" She turned round and gazed into the=
 room where the coffin had=20

been with a gaze full of meaning which no one could mistake. _It_ was gone-=
-all was gone. "You=20

must not be horrified, mother," she said. "Why should I be false now? I thi=
nk if it had lasted any=20

longer I must have died or run away."  "Dear Carry, you would have done nei=
ther; you would have=20

done your duty to the end," her=20
