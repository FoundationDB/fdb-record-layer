Randolph, Field Worker John A. Simms, Editor Mulberry, Florida October 8, 1936  SAM AND 

LOUISA EVERETT   Sam and Louise Everett, 86 and 90 years of age respectively, have 

weathered together some of the worst experiences of slavery, and as they look back over the 

years, can relate these experiences as clearly as if they had happened only yesterday.  Both were 

born near Norfolk, Virginia and sold as slaves several times on nearby plantations. It was on the 

plantation of "Big Jim" McClain that they met as slave-children and departed after Emancipation to 

live the lives of free people.  Sam was the son of Peter and Betsy Everett, field hands who spent 

long back-breaking hours in the cotton fields and came home at nightfall to cultivate their small 

garden. They lived in constant fear that their master would confiscate most of their vegetables; he 

so often did.  Louisa remembers little about her parents and thinks that she was sold at an early 

age to a separate master. Her name as nearly as she could remember was Norfolk Virginia. 

Everyone called her "Nor." It was not until after she was freed and had sent her children to school 

that she changed her name to Louisa.  Sam and Norfolk spent part of their were discipline and 

religion. His discipline redeemed the war from savagery, and made it again, so far as war, and war 

in that iron age could be, a school of humanity and self-control. In religion he was himself not an 

ascetic saint, there is one light passage at least in his early life: and at Augsburg they show a ruff 

plucked from his neck by a fair Augsburger at the crisis of a very brisk flirtation. But he was 

devout, and he inspired his army with his devotion. The traveller is still struck with the prayer and 

hymn which open and close the march of the soldiers of Gustavus. Schools for the soldiers' 

children were held in his camp. It is true that the besetting sin of the Swedes, and of all dwellers in 

cold countries, is disclosed by the article in his military code directed against the drunkenness of 

army chaplains.  Sir Thomas Roe, the most sagacious of the English diplomatists of that age, 

wrote of Gustavus to James I.--"The king hath solemnly protested that he will not depose arms till 

he hath spoken one word for your majesty in Germany (that was his own phrase), and glory will 

contend with policy in his resolution; for he hath unlimited thoughts, and is the likeliest instrument 

for God to work by in Europe. We have often observed great alterations to follow great spirits, as if 

they were fitted for the times. Certainly, _ambit fortunam Caesaris_: he thinks the ship

Jim" who was very cruel; often he would whip his slaves into insensibility for minor offences. He 

sometimes hung them up by their thumbs whenever they were caught attempting to escape--"er 

fer no reason atall."  On this plantation were more than 100 slaves who were mated 

indiscriminately and without any regard for family unions. If their master thought that a certain man 

and woman might have strong, healthy offspring, he forced them to have sexual relation, even 

though they were married to other slaves. If there seemed to be any slight reluctance on the part 

of either of the unfortunate ones "Big Jim" would make them consummate this relationship in his 

presence. He used the same procedure if he thought a certain couple was not producing children 

fast enough. He enjoyed these orgies very much and often prosperity."  Gustavus justified his 

landing in Germany by a manifesto setting forth hostile acts of the Emperor against him in Poland. 

No doubt there was a technical _casus belli_. But, morally, the landing of Gustavus was a glorious 

breach of the principle of non-intervention. He came to save the world. He was not the less a fit 

instrument for God to work by because it was likely that he would rule the world when he had 

saved it.  "A snow king!" tittered the courtiers of Vienna, "he will soon melt away." He soon began 

to prove to them, both in war and diplomacy, that his melting would be slow. Richelieu at last 

ventured on a treaty of alliance. Charles I., now on the throne of England, and angry at having 

been jilted by Spain, also entered into a treaty, and sent British auxiliaries, who, though soon

this manner; quite often he and his guests would engage in these debaucheries, choosing for 

themselves the prettiest of the young women. Sometimes they forced the unhappy husbands and 

lovers of their victims to look on.  Louisa and Sam were married in a very revolting manner. To 

quote the woman:  formed a substantial part of the armies of Gustavus, and in battle and storm 

earned their full share of the honour of his campaigns. Many British volunteers had already joined 

the standard of Mansfeldt and other Protestant chiefs; and if some of these men were mere

shirt--that was all the McClain niggers wore--and he said to me: 'Nor, do you think you can stand 

this big nigger?' He had that old bull whip flung acrost his shoulder, and Lawd, that man could hit 

so hard! So I jes said 'yassur, I guess so,' and tried to hide my face so I couldn't see Sam's 

nakedness, but he made me look at him anyhow."  "Well, he told us what we must git busy and do 

in his presence, and we had to do it. After that we were considered man and wife. Me and Sam 

was a healthy pair and had fine, big babies, so I never had another man forced on me, thank God. 

Sam was kind to me and I learnt to love him."  Life on the McClain plantation was a steady grind of 

work from morning until night. Slaves had to rise in the dark of the morning at the ringing of the 

"Big House" bell. After eating a hasty brought back at once enthusiasm and military skill from 

German battlefields to Marston and Naseby. Diplomacy, aided by a little gentle pressure, drew 

Saxony and Brandenburgh to the better cause, now that the better cause was so strong. But while 

they dallied and haggled one more great disaster was added to the sum of Protestant calamity. 

Magdeburgh, the queen of Protestant cities, the citadel of North German liberty, fell--fell with 

Gustavus and rescue near--and nameless atrocities were perpetrated by the ferocious bands of 

the Empire on innocents of all ages and both sexes, whose cry goes up against bloodthirsty 

fanaticism for ever. A shriek of horror rang through the Protestant world, not without reproaches 

against Gustavus, who cleared himself by words, and was soon to clear himself better by deeds.

fat pork and corn pone, they worked in the fields until the bell rang again at noon; at which time 

they ate boiled vegetables, roasted sweet potatoes and black molasses. This food was cooked in 

iron pots which had legs attached to their bottoms in order to keep them from resting directly on 

the fire. These Wallenstein had been dismissed. A military Richelieu, an absolutist in politics, an 

indifferentist in religion, caring at least for the religious quarrel only as it affected the political 

question, he aimed at crushing the independence of all the princes, Catholic as well as Protestant,
