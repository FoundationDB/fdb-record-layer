GRADING RULES   The Board of Control by virtue of the authority and power c=
onferred upon=20

them by Section 5 of an act of the Minnesota Legislature, entitled "An Act =
to regulate the=20

sentencing of prisoners convicted of felony and their subsequent release on=
 Bread; after which,=20

cut some thin Slices of fat Bacon, about three Inches long, and an Inch bro=
ad, and lay the Larks in=20

a row, side to side, with a piece of this Bacon between every two Larks; th=
en have small Spits=20

about ten Inches long, and pass the Spits thro' the Sides of the Larks and =
the Bacon, so that you=20

have half a dozen Larks upon each Spit, observing to have a piece of Bacon =
on both the outsides=20

of the half dozen Larks; baste these well while they are roasting, and for =
the Sauce for them, fry=20

some grated Bread crisp in Butter, and set them to drain before the Fire, t=
hat they may harden;=20

serve these under the Larks when you send them to Table, and garnish with S=
lices of Lemmon.=20

Some have their Lark-Spits made of Silver, and serve their Larks upon the S=
pits to the Table, by=20

which means they keep hot the longer: you may eat them with Juice of Lemmon=
 with the fry'd=20

Crumbs, but some like such Gravey-Sauce with them as is directed for the ro=
asted Turkey. Tho'=20

the Guts are left in the Larks, yet they are not to be eaten.  In my Travel=
s I observed a kind of=20

Soup, which was very frequently used abroad, and quickly ready, that was ve=
ry taking to most=20

Travellers who delighted in savoury Dishes, which the People abroad call So=
up _a l'Yvrogne_. It is=20

made as follows.  Take half a score Onions, peel them, and cut them in smal=
l Pieces into a=20

Stewpan, and fry them brown with Butter, and a little Pepper and Salt; and =
when they are enough,=20

pour such a quantity of Water upon them as you think proper to make a Soup =
of them; then let=20



these boil together, and thicken it with as many Eggs as are neccessary, ke=
eping it stirring to=20

prevent the Eggs from Curdling. Some add to this a large Glass of White-win=
e, which I think=20

makes it better tasted than 'tis without it: this is served with a _French_=
 Role in the middle. At the=20

same time I met with the following Receipt for Beef _A-la-mode,_ which is a=
s good as any I have=20

eaten.    To make Beef _A-la-mode._  Take a fleshy piece of Beef, without F=
at, and beat it well=20

with a Rolling pin, then lard it with pretty large pieces of Bacon-Fat, and=
 if you please put over the=20

Fire a little to fry till the outside is brown, and then put it to stew in =
a deep Stew-pan, or glaz'd=20

Earthen-Vessel, with Salt, Pepper, Bay-Leaves or _Jamaica_ Pepper, some Lem=
mon-Peel, half a=20

dozen large Mushrooms, two Gloves of Garlick, or four or five Cloves of Sha=
llot, half a Pint of=20

Wine, and a Pint of Water; cover it close, and let it stew gently till it i=
s tender: when it is enough, fry=20

some Flower in Hogs-Lard, and add to it, with some Lemmon-Juice, or a littl=
e Verjuice. This is very=20

prisoners to be known and designated as the First, Second and Third Grades,=
 together with a=20

system of marks to be governed by the following rules and regulations, whic=
h shall be in force and=20

have effect from and after the official notification of the passage of said=
 Act is certified by the=20

Secretary of State under date of April 5th, 1893.  All prisoners on arrival=
 shall be entered in the=20

Second Grade; they may earn nine credit marks each month and shall be marke=
d on conduct,=20

work and mental advancement. Promotion from the Second to the First Grade s=
hall be conditioned=20

upon the earning of fifty (50) out of the possible fifty-four (54) credit m=
arks, within six (6)=20

consecutive months. The loss of more than two (2) marks in any one month sh=
all cause the=20

prisoner so offending to be reduced to the next lower grade. By a clear rec=
ord of one (1) month,=20

and the earning of nine (9) credit marks shall entitle the prisoner to be a=
dvanced to the next upper=20

grade.  Prisoners may lose their grades:        First. By such violations o=
f prison rules as shall=20

necessarily       subject them to solitary confinement.       Second. For g=
eneral disorderly conduct.=20

Third. For habitual laziness, untidiness or negligence.                    =

LIBRARY RULES   In ordering books the following directions must be carefull=
y adhered to:  Write=20

plainly upon a slip of paper your name and cell number. Underneath place th=
e numbers of fifteen=20

or twenty books you prefer to read. Always take your library book with you =
when moving from one=20

cell to another. Bear in mind that all books are charged to you and that yo=
u will be held strictly=20

responsible for their preservation and safe return. The catalogue and all b=
ooks charged to you=20

must be accounted for on the day of your parole or discharge from prison. Y=
ou will not be allowed=20

to have a library book in your possession or in your cell except those that=
 have been regularly=20

charged up and come to you through the regular channels. If you find a stra=
y book in your cell you=20

must turn it over to the Librarian at once. Failing to do this, in the even=
t of finding a stray library=20

book in your cell will be the means of depriving you of all library privile=
ges.  You are accorded the=20

utmost liberty in the selection of your reading matter, but it is hoped and=
 it will be expected by the=20

management that the library record will show that you have exercised due di=
ligence and regard for=20

your own best interests in the selection of books. The Warden, Chaplains, T=
eachers or other=20

officers will gladly advise you concerning the selection of proper reading =
matter.  All library books,=20

excepting books of reference, may be retained two weeks. Books of reference=
 may be held but=20

one day.                            RULES FOR EXCHANGING PAPERS   Any perso=
n wishing to=20

exchange papers or periodicals with other prisoners may do so by observing =
the following rules:=20

Mark the numbers of the cells to which you wish to send the paper or period=
ical plainly on the=20

margin thereof and drop it in the exchange box at the foot of the stairs as=
 you go out with your=20

bucket in the morning.            [Solitary Confinement Cell, with Crank Ce=

*       *       *       *       *  DECEMBER.  Now is the principal Season f=
or killing of Hogs, as well for=20

Pork as for Bacon, and likewise for Brawn. I have already in my other Works=
 given Directions for=20

making of pickled Pork and Bacon; so that I shall say little of it in this =
place, but give the Receipts=20

for ordering some particular parts of Hogs. The following Receipt I receive=
d from _France,_=20

concerning the preparing of the Jole of a wild Boar, and have had it try'd =
in _England_ with the=20

Head of a common Hog; and I find little difference, especially if the Hog h=
as been fed with Acorns.=20

To dress a Hog's Head, in imitation of the Jole of a wild Boar.  Take a Hog=
's Head and burn it well=20



all over upon a clear Fire, till all the Hair is burnt to the Skin; then ta=
ke a piece of Brick, and rub the=20

Head all over as hard as possible, to grind off the Stumps of the Bristles,=
 and finish the whole with=20

your Knife, and then clean the Head very well; when this is done, you must =
take out all the Bones,=20

opening the Head in the under Part, and beginning with the under Jaw-Bones =
and the Muzzle;=20

then cleave the Head, leaving only the Skin over the Skull to hold it toget=
her: take out the Tongue=20

and the Brains. When thus you have taken away all the Bones, stab the Flesh=
 with the Point of=20

your Knife in many places on the inside, without wounding the Skin, and put=
 Salt into every=20

Incision, then join the Head together, and tie it well together with Packth=
read, and then wrapping it=20

up in a Napkin, put it in a Kettle, with a large Quantity of Water, a large=
 Bunch of all kinds of sweet=20

Herbs, a little Coriander and Anise-Seeds, two or three Bay Leaves, some Cl=
oves, and two or=20

three Nutmegs cut in pieces, and some Salt, if you think there is any wanti=
ng; add likewise two or=20

three large Onions and a Sprig or two of Rosemary. When this has boiled hal=
f enough, pour in a=20

Bottle of Wine, and let it boil three or four Hours longer till 'tis tender=
; for it will not be so under=20

seven or eight Hours boiling, if the Hog be large; and if it is a Boar's He=
ad, that has been put up=20

for Brawn, it will take more time to boil. Being boiled enough, let it cool=
 in the Liquor, and then take=20

it out and untie it, and lay it in a Dish to be carry'd cold to the Table, =
either whole or in Slices. If=20

you will, you may salt it three or four days before you boil it.    To make=
 Sausages, from Lady _M._=20

Take the Flesh of a Leg of Pork, and mince it small, and to every Pound of =
the Flesh minced,=20

mince about a quarter of a Pound of the hard Fat of the Hog; then beat some=
 _Jamaica_ Pepper=20

very fine, and mix with it some Pepper and Salt, with a little Sweet-Marjor=
am powder'd, and some=20

Leaves of red Sage minced very small; mix all these very well, and if you f=
ill them into Guts, either=20

of Hogs or Sheep, beat two or three Yolks of Eggs and mix with them, taking=
 care not to fill the=20

Guts too full, lest they burst when you broil or fry them: but if you desig=
n them to be eaten without=20

putting them in Guts, then put no Eggs to them, but beat the Flesh and the =
Fat in a Stone Mortar,=20

and work the Spice and Herbs well into it with your hands, so that it be we=
ll mix'd, and keep it in a=20

Mass to use at your pleasure, breaking off Pieces, and rolling them in your=
 hands, and then=20

flowering them well before you fry them. If you use them in Guts, take spec=
ial care that the Guts=20

are well clean'd, and lie some time in a little warm White-wine and Spice b=
efore you use them; if=20

State Prison.  Door to Right is Closed at all Times.   After reading papers=
 sent to you scratch your=20

number out and replace papers in the exchange box the following morning, bu=
t do not add any=20

numbers to the list nor erase any but your own.  Weekly and semi-weekly pub=
lications circulate=20

ten days from the date of their issue; monthly publications circulate the m=
onth of their issue.=20

Writing on, drawing pictures on, or in any way defacing exchanges is forbid=
den. Papers must be=20

kept as clean as possible.                            RESTORATION OF CITIZE=
NSHIP.   A convict who=20

shall pass the entire period of his imprisonment without a violation of the=
 rules and disagreeable in=20

this Mixture, it may be left out, or others added at pleasure.  The followi=
ng Receipt to make=20

Sausages of Fish for Fast-Days, I had at _Bruxelles_, which I have experien=
ced to be very good.=20

To make Sausages of Fish.  Take the Flesh of Eels, or of Tench, and to eith=
er of these put some=20

of the Flesh of fresh Cod, or of Pike or Jack, chop these well together wit=
h Parsley, and a few=20

small Onions; season these with a little Salt, Pepper, Cloves in Powder, a =
little grated Nutmeg,=20

and, if you will, a little powder'd Ginger, with some Thyme, Sweet-Marjoram=
, a little Bay-Leaf, all=20

dry'd and powder'd; and mix all these well together with a little Butter.  =
