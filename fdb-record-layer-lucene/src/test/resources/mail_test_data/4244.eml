are not located of Oldham=E2=80=99s pinnace eleven Indians had been killed,=
 several of them chiefs; and=20

that, with the restoration of the crew, seems to have been esteemed by Cano=
nicus a sufficient=20

atonement for Oldham=E2=80=99s death. But the magistrates and ministers of =
Massachusetts, assembled to=20

take this matter into consideration, thought otherwise. Volunteers were cal=
led for in August, 1636;=20

and four companies, ninety men in all, commanded by Endicott, whose submiss=
iveness in=20

Williams=E2=80=99 affair had restored him to favor, were embarked in three =
pinnaces, with orders to put to=20

death all the men of Block Island, and to make the women and children priso=
ners. The old affair of=20

the death of Stone was now also called to mind, though the murder of Oldham=
 had no connection=20

with it, except in some distant similarity of circumstances. Endicott was i=
nstructed, on his return=20

from Block Island, to go to the Pequots, and to demand of them the murderer=
s of Stone, and a=20

thousand fathoms of wampum for damages--equivalent to from three to five th=
ousand dollars--

also, some of their children as hostages; and, if they refused, to employ f=
orce.  The Block=20

Islanders fled inland, hid themselves, and escaped; but Endicott burned the=
ir wigwams, staved=20

their canoes, and destroyed their standing corn. He then sailed to Fort Say=
brook, at the mouth of=20

the Connecticut, and marched thence to Pequot River. After some parley, the=
 Indians refused his=20

demands, when he burned their village and killed one of their warriors. Mar=
ching back to the=20

Connecticut River, he inflicted like vengeance on the Pequot village there,=
 whence he returned to=20

Boston, after a three weeks=E2=80=99 absence and without the loss of a man.=
  The Pequots, enraged at=20

what they esteemed a treacherous and unprovoked attack, lurked about Fort S=
aybrook, killed or=20

took several persons, and did considerable mischief. They sent, also, to th=
e Narragansets to=20

engage their alliance against the colonists, whom they represented as the c=
ommon enemy of all=20

the Indians. Williams, informed of this negotiation, sent word of it to the=
 Massachusetts=20

magistrates, and, at their request, he visited Canonicus, to dissuade him f=
rom joining the Pequots.=20

This mission was not without danger. In the wigwam of Canonicus, Williams e=
ncountered the=20



Pequot messengers, full of rage and fury. He succeeded, however, in his obj=
ect, and, in October,=20

Miantonimoh was induced to visit Boston, where, being received with much ce=
remony by the=20

governor and magistrates, he agreed to act with them as a faithful ally. Ca=
nonicus thought it would=20

be necessary to attack the Pequots with a very large force; but he recommen=
ded, as a thing likely=20

to be agreeable to all the Indians--so Williams informs us--that the women =
and children should be=20

spared, a humane piece of advice which received in the end but little atten=
tion.  The policy of this=20

war, or, at least, the wisdom of Endicott=E2=80=99s conduct, was not univer=
sally conceded. A letter from=20

Plymouth reproached the Massachusetts magistrates with the dangers likely t=
o arise from so=20

inefficient an attack upon the Pequots. Gardiner, the commandant at Fort Sa=
ybrook, who lost=20

several men during the winter, was equally dissatisfied. The new settlers u=
p the Connecticut=20

complained bitterly of the dangers to which they were exposed. Sequeen, the=
 same Indian chief at=20

whose invitation the Plymouth people had first established a trading-house =
on the Connecticut=20

River, had granted land to the planters at Wethersfield on condition that h=
e might settle near them,=20

and be protected; but when he came and built his wigwam, they had driven hi=
m away. He took this=20

opportunity for revenge by calling in the Pequots, who attacked the town, a=
nd killed nine of the=20

inhabitants. The whole number killed by the Pequots during the winter was a=
bout thirty.  In=20

December a special session of the General Court of Massachusetts organized =
the militia into three=20

regiments, the magistrates to appoint the field officers--called sergeant-m=
ajors--and to select the=20

captains and lieutenants out of a nomination to be made by the companies re=
spectively. Watches=20

were ordered to be kept, and travellers were to go armed....  The new towns=
 on the Connecticut=20

had continued to suffer during the winter. The attack on Wethersfield has b=
een mentioned already.=20

Fort Saybrook was beleaguered; several colonists were killed, and two young=
 girls were taken=20

prisoners, but were presently redeemed and sent home by some Dutch traders.=
 It had been=20

resolved in Massachusetts to raise a hundred and sixty men for the war, and=
 already Underhill had=20

been sent, with twenty men, to reinforce Fort Saybrook; but, during Vane=E2=
=80=99s administration, these=20

preparations had been retarded--not from any misgivings as to the justice o=
f the war, but because=20

the army =E2=80=9Cwas too much under a covenant of works.=E2=80=9D The expe=
dition was now got ready, and, by a=20

=E2=80=9Csolemn public invocation of the word of God,=E2=80=9D a leader was=
 designated by lot from among three of=20

the magistrates set apart for that purpose. The lot fell on Stoughton, whos=
e adherence to the=20

orthodox party during the late dissensions had restored him to favor, and o=
btained for him, at the=20

late election, one of the vacant magistrates=E2=80=99 seats. Wilson was als=
o designated by lot as chaplain=20

to the expedition. The people of Plymouth agreed to furnish forty-five men.=
  The decisive battle,=20

however, had been already fought. The Connecticut towns, impatient of delay=

 WITH=20

"charity toward all and malice toward none" we indite this volume of critic=
ism of the Federal=20

Reserve "Bunking" System as it is "practiced" in America. We are not posing=
 as a modern David,=20

nor do we underrate the size of the giant we have tackled herein by several=
 damsights. And by the=20

same token we are not depending on a single stone to deliver a knockout; on=
 the contrary we are=20

delivering a veritable volley of rocks at the object of our criticism and w=
e hope that every chapter=20

written here will raise bruises and welts on the back and belly of the crit=
ter.  We have no intention=20

nor desire to kill. And we don't believe in reform. When a thing needs refo=
rming it needs an axe.=20

But what we are striving to do is After a night spent in prayer, this littl=
e army, joined by Uncas with=20

sixty Indians, and accompanied by Stone, Hooker=E2=80=99s colleague, as cha=
plain, embarked at Hartford.=20

They were not without great doubts as to their Indian allies, but were reas=
sured at Fort Saybrook.=20

While Stone was praying =E2=80=9Cfor one pledge of love, that may confirm u=
s of the fidelity of the Indians,=E2=80=9D=20

these allies came in with five Pequot scalps and a prisoner. Underhill join=
ed with his twenty men,=20

and the united forces proceeded by water to Narragansett Bay, where they sp=
ent Sunday, May 21,=20

in religious exercises. They were further strengthened by Miantonimoh and t=
wo hundred=20

Narraganset warriors; but the English force seemed so inadequate that many =
of the Narragansets=20

became discouraged and returned home.  The Pequots were principally collect=
ed a few miles east=20

of Pequot River, now the Thames, in two forts, or villages, fortified with =
trees and brushwood. After=20

a fatiguing march of two days, Mason reached one of these strongholds, situ=
ated on a high hill, at=20

no great distance from the sea-shore. He encamped a few hours to rest his m=
en, but marched=20

again before daybreak, and at early dawn approached the fort. The Pequots h=
ad seen the vessels=20

pass along the sea-shore toward the bay of Narragansett, and, supposing the=
 hostile forces afraid=20

to attack them, they had spent the night in feasting and dancing, and Mason=
 could hear their=20

shoutings in his camp. Toward morning they sunk into a deep sleep, from whi=
ch they were roused=20

by the barking of their dogs, as the colonists, in two parties, approached =
the fort, one led by=20

Mason, the other by Underhill, both of whom have left us narratives of the=
=20


_
ramifications of the Federal Reserve Octopus in the hope that the people wi=
ll "come alive" and=20

eventually force the Federal Reserve System to be born anew.  It is the abu=

Savior of Credit and Industry. But it The assailants poured in a fire of mu=
sketry, and, after a=20

moment=E2=80=99s hesitation, forced their way into the fort. Within were th=

containing the families of the Indians, and what remained of their winter s=
tores. The astonished=20
