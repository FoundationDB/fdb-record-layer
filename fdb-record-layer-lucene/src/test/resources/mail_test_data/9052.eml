But when she heard that Ned Franks had been dismissed,--dismissed in disgra=
ce as incompetent=20

and ignorant,--the wrath of the clerk's wife blazed up with a sudden fierce=
ness that showed that=20

the old shrewish spirit was not quite dead in her yet. As her torrent of in=
dignation poured forth like=20

lava-streams from a volcano, which most agree with my Palate, and have been=
 admired by the=20

best Judges of my Acquaintance, are the following, which I had from _France=
_.    To dress a=20

Capon, or other Fowl.  When your Fowl is truss'd for Roasting, cover the Br=
east with a thin slice of=20

fat Bacon, and put an Onion stuck with Cloves into the Belly, with=20

whether he was glad or sorry to be so forcibly reminded of the Nancy of for=
mer days. Nancy was=20

certain that the school would go to rack and ruin; they would never, never =
again see the like of=20

Ned Franks and his wife!  But perhaps in no place did the news cause deeper=
 regret than in the=20

vicarage. Norah was almost overwhelmed by the sudden blow, and her letter t=
o Sophy Claymore,=20

informing her of what had happened, was wet with the young girl's tears. Mr=
. Curtis lay awake half=20

the night, meditating over a second letter to Sir Lacy (which was--when wri=
tten and sent--to meet=20

with just the same fate as the first), and the invalid had, in consequence,=
 a relapse of fever in the=20

morning. Claudius Leyton, the young curate, broke through his resolution,--=
never again to enter=20

the Hall, and, like a man on a forlorn hope, set out to endeavor to move an=
d persuade his cousin=20

to recall his hasty words. The nervous shyness of the curate was not lessen=
ed by his being=20

handed into a room full of rollicking revellers; a room which in ancient da=
ys had been used as a=20

chapel, but which was reeking, even at that early hour, with the fumes of t=
obacco and the odor of=20

spirits. It Salt and Pepper; when it is roasted enough, take off the Bacon,=
 and strew it with grated=20

Bread, till it is brown. This is eaten, either with Orange-Juice and Salt, =
or if Oysters are at hand, as=20

they are about many Farms in _England_, they may be stew'd gently with a li=
ttle White Wine,=20

Spice, and a little Butter, which will make an agreeable Sauce for it. Or e=
lse it may be eaten with a=20

very good Sauce, which I have often met with, and have lik'd as well; which=
 is made with small=20

Beer and Water, equal quantities, an Onion slic'd, some Pepper and Salt, an=
d about an Ounce of=20

Flesh, either of Mutton or Beef, to boil till it comes to about half, suppo=
sing at first 'tis not above=20

half a Pint; and at some places, instead of Mutton, _&c._ this Sauce has be=
en only made of the=20

Neck of a Fowl. This Sauce, in my Opinion, has a very rich Taste, and has b=
een well approv'd of=20

by some curious Travellers: Where we could have this, we rather chose it th=
an Wine-Sauce.=20

Capons, Pullets, or others of this sort of Fowl, may be also larded with Ba=
con, if they are roasted;=20

but the Gentleman aforesaid, who gave me this Receipt, told me that no Wate=
r-Fowl must be=20

larded with=20


_
be added that the visit of the young clergyman was as unsuccessful as regar=
ded its object, as it=20

was to himself painful and disgusting. The baronet, laughing, said to his c=
ousin, "My dear fellow,=20

you have come a day too late for the fair. I have already written up to my =
friend, Dick Sharpey,--

you know Dick,--all the world knows him as the luckiest card-player in Lond=
on. I've bid him look=20

out for a cute fellow who can teach the clods in the day, and be my billiar=
d-marker at night. That's=20

what I call killing two birds with one stone, ha!    To farce or stuff a Fo=
wl. From Mr. _Agneau._=20

When your Fowl is made ready for Roasting, take the Liver boil'd, a Shallot=
, a little Fat of Bacon,=20

some grated Bread, the Bottom of a boil'd Artichoke, and some Mushrooms, ch=
op these very=20

small, and make a forc'd Meat of them, season'd with Salt and Spices at ple=
asure; fill the Belly of=20

the Fowl with this, and then truss it, covering the Breast with a thin slic=
e of fat Bacon, and over that=20

put a piece of writing Paper. Roast this, and serve it up with the followin=
g Sauce: Make a hash of=20

It was with a heavy heart that the curate again turned his back on the Hall=
, not surprised, though=20

grieved, at the utter failure of his mission.  Mrs. Curtis, a very practica=
l as well as kind woman,=20

directed her efforts to writing to friends in various quarters to try by th=
eir means to procure some=20

other situation for Franks before he should quit the one which at present h=
e held. As Ned=20

Anchovy, a few Capers and some Gravy, boiled together with such Seasoning a=
s you approve; the=20

Sauce should be thicken'd or brown'd, and it is fit for the Table.    To fa=
rce Fowls another way.=20

From the same.  Take Pullets and roast them, then take the Flesh of the Bre=
ast, and mince it=20

small, with some Fat of Bacon boil'd, a few Mushrooms, a little Onion and P=
arsley, and some=20

Crumb of Bread=20
