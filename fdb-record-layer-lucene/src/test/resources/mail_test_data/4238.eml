And once having nibbled at the fruit of the tree of knowledge, she went ram=
paging through the=20

whole garden. She made a stubborn effort to exhaust the possibilities of al=
l the little hemmers, and=20

tried the shirrer and the fire-stitch ruffler, and obviously had a fling at=
 the binder and a turn at the=20

tucker. What she did to the tension-spring heaven only knows. And my brand-=
new machine is on=20

the blink. And my meek-eyed little Poppsy isn't as impeccable as the world =
about her imagined!=20

_Wednesday the Third_   Susie Mumford arrived yesterday. The weather, heave=
n be thanked,=20

was perfect, an opal day with the earth as fresh-smelling as Poppsy just ou=
t of her bath. There=20

was just enough chill in the air to make one's blood tingle and just enough=
 warmth in the sunlight=20

to make it feel like a benediction. Whinstane Sandy, in fact, avers that we=
're in for a spell of Indian=20

Summer.  I motored in to Buckhorn and met Susie, who wasn't in the least wh=
at I expected. I was=20

looking for a high-spirited and insolent-eyed young lady who'd probably be =
traveling with a French=20

maid and a van-load of trunks, after the manner of Lady Alicia. But the Sus=
ie I met was a tired and=20

listless and rather white-faced girl who reminds me just enough of her Uncl=
e Peter to make me like=20

her. The poor child knows next to nothing of the continent on which she was=
 born, and the=20

immensity of our West has rather appalled her. She told me, driving home, t=
hat she had never=20

before been this side of the Adirondacks. Yet she has crossed the Atlantic =
eight times and knows=20

western Europe about as well as she knows Long Island itself. There is a ma=
tter-of-factness about=20

Susie which makes her easy to get along with. Poppsy took to her at once an=

and happy witness of Susie's unpacking. Dinkie, on the other hand, develope=
d an altogether=20

unlooked-for shyness and turned red when Susie kissed him. There was no mel=
ting of the ice until=20

the strange lady produced a very wonderful toy air-ship, which you wind up =
and which soars right=20

over the haystacks, if you start it right. This was a present which Peter s=
ent out. Dinkie, in fact,=20

spent most of his spare time last night writing a letter to his Uncle Peter=
, a letter which he=20

intimated he had no wish for the rest of the family to instead of serving G=
od by serving humanity.=20

Kings and chieftains, under the hypocritical pretence of exchanging a world=
ly for an angelic life,=20

buried themselves in the indolence, not seldom in the sensuality, of the cl=
oister, when they ought=20

to have been leading their people against the Dane. But Christianity formed=
 the bond which held=20

the English together, and the strength of their resistance. It inspired the=
ir patriot martyrs, it raised=20

up to them a deliverer at their utmost need. The causes of Danish success a=
re manifest; superior=20

prowess and valour, sustained by more constant practice in war, of which th=
e Saxon had probably=20

had comparatively little since the final subjection of the Celt and the uni=
on of the Saxon kingdoms=20

under Egbert; the imperfect character of that union, each kingdom retaining=
 its own council and its=20

own interests; and above all the command of the sea, which made the invader=
s ubiquitous, while=20

the march of the defenders was delayed, and their junction prevented, by th=
e woods and=20

morasses of the uncleared island, in which the only roads worthy of the nam=
e were those left by=20

the Romans.  It would be wrong to call the Northmen mere corsairs, or even =
to class them with=20

piratical states such as Cilicia of old, or Barbary in more recent times. T=
heir invasions were rather=20

to be regarded as an after-act of the great migration of the Germanic tribe=
s, one of the last waves=20

of the flood which overwhelmed the Roman Empire, and deposited the germs of=
 modern=20

Christendom. They were, and but for the defensive energy of the Christianiz=
ed Teuton would have=20

been, to the Saxon what the Saxon had been to the Celt, whose sole monument=
s in England now=20

are the names of hills and rivers, the usual epitaph of exterminated races.=
 Like the Saxons the=20



Northmen came by sea, untouched by those Roman influences, political and re=
ligious, by which=20

most of the barbarians had been more or less transmuted before their actual=
 irruption into the=20

Empire. If they treated all the rest of mankind as their prey, this was the=
 international law of=20

heathendom, modified only by a politic humanity in the case of the Imperial=
 Roman, who preferred=20

enduring dominion to blood and booty. With Christianity came the idea, even=
 now imperfectly=20

realized, of the brotherhood=20

a momentous addition. In their northern abodes they had undergone, no doubt=
, the most rigorous=20

process of national selection. The sea-roving life, to which they were driv=

about the quietness of existence out here, for our pace must seem a slow on=
