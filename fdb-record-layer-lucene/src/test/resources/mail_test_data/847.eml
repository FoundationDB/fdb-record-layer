a note:  "I am sorry, dear--it was all my fault. I was a fool--a clumsy foo=
l. But remember there is=20

plenty of time--and be certain absolutely that everything will be all right=
."  She read it more than=20

once that day, and it helped her prepare for the evening. When Joe came hom=
e and took her in=20

his arms, she knew at once that he meant her to feel there was nothing to b=
e afraid of.  "I've got to=20

be down at the office tonight," was all he said. But in his voice, low, kin=
d and reassuring, like that=20

of a big brother, there was a promise which gave her a thrill of gratitude =
and deep relief. With it=20

came some self-reproach, which caused her again to struggle, alone, and the=
n go to Amy's room=20

to sleep. She lay listening there for hours, carefully holding herself in c=
heck. When she heard his=20

key in the hall door, she sharply stiffened, held her breath. . . . She hea=
rd him go into the small=20

guest room which had been hers a year before. . . . And then she cried soft=
ly to herself. With the=20

blessed relief of it, her love for Joe was coming back.    CHAPTER X  One e=
vening about two=20

months later Ethel was dressing for dinner. As usual they were dining alone=
, but long ago she had=20

taken the habit of dressing each night as though there were people coming. =
Amy had taught her to=20

do that; and after the death of her sister she had always made a point of "=
keeping up" for Joe's=20

sake, although often it had been an effort. But it was no effort now. She h=
ad been here for nearly=20

an hour, absorbed in this pleasant, leisurely art that had such a new meani=
ng and delight. To keep=20

being different, revealing her beauty in new ways, to see if he'd notice, t=
o laugh in his arms and=20

feel her power over Joe, had brought back her old zest for pretty clothes, =
and she had been=20

wearing all the things she had bought when she first came to town. Last yea=
r's clothes, for they=20

still smilingly called themselves "poor," although Joe was doing much bette=
r now. Last year's=20

clothes, and the styles had changed, but in ways which Joe, poor dear, was =
too blind to notice.=20

The room in which she was dressing had somehow assumed a different air. Alt=
hough in the main it=20

was the same as when Amy had been here, and her picture was still on Joe's =
chiffonier--still subtly=20

by degrees it had changed. Some of Ethel's clothes were lying their diploma=
s and affidavits by=20

letter or proxy. The act allows persons taking advantage of section 13 nine=
ty days after its=20

passage in which to procure a certificate (_ib._, s. 4, as amended February=
 21st, 1891).  All=20

examinations of persons not graduates or licentiates must be made directly =
by the board, and=20

certificates authorize the person named to practise medicine and surgery (_=
ib._, s. 5).  The holder=20

of a certificate must have it recorded in the office of the county clerk of=
 the county in which he=20

resides, and the record must be indorsed thereon. On removal to another cou=
nty to practise he=20

must procure an indorsement to that effect on the certificate from the cler=
k, and have the=20

certificate recorded in the office of the clerk of the county to which he r=
emoves (_ib._, s. 6).  The=20

examinations may be wholly or partly in writing and must be of an elementar=
y and practical=20

character, but sufficiently strict to test the qualifications of the candid=
ate as a practitioner (_ib._, s.=20

8).  The board may refuse a certificate to an individual guilty of unprofes=
sional or dishonorable=20

conduct, and may revoke for like causes, after giving the accused an opport=
unity to be heard in his=20

defence before the board (_ib._, s. 9).  DEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94An=

be for the sick, or=20

appends to his name the letters =E2=80=9CM.D.;=E2=80=9D but the act does no=
t prohibit students from prescribing=20

under the supervision of a preceptor, nor gratuitous services in cases of e=
mergency, nor does it=20

apply to commissioned surgeons of the United States army, navy, and marine =
hospital service=20

(_ib._, s. 10).  ITINERANT VENDER.=E2=80=94Any itinerant vender of any drug=
, nostrum, medicine,=20



ointment, or appliance of any kind intended for the treatment of disease or=
 injury, who shall=20

publicly profess to cure or treat diseases, injuries, deformities, or ailme=
nts by any drug, nostrum,=20

medicine, or other appliance, shall pay a license to the Secretary of the S=
tate of $100 per month.=20

Violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more=
 than $500 or=20

imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months, or both. Such l=
icenses to any firm or=20

n fresh chintz, and=20

Ethel's things were on it. Joe's picture and Susette's were here, and a dro=
ll little painted bird was=20

perched above the mirror.  As she glanced into the glass, gaily she thanked=
 herself for the charms=20

which she was deftly enhancing--in the glossy black hair, smooth and sleek,=
 in the flushed cheeks=20

and the red of her lips and the gleaming lights in her brown eyes. She nodd=
ed approvingly at=20

herself. "You're a great 11, as amended February 21st, 1891).  PENALTY.=E2=

 sixty-five days, or both,=20

for each offence. Filing or attempting to file as his own the certificate o=
f another, or a forged=20

affidavit or identification, is a felony punishable the same as forgery in =
the second degree (_ib._, s.=20
