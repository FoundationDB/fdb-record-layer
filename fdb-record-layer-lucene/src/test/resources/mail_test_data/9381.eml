When Skinner that night put the dress suit away, he patted the coat fondly.  "Sorry, Skinner, old chap,--you know what for," he murmured. near Nine Elms.  "These premises have been unoccupied for some considerable time. They are of large extent, and out of the way of regular traffic. Early this morning, just _
fifteenth--just two weeks off.  "I'll put it down in my little book.  It is n't exactly tangible, but you can 

bet your life it may _lead_ to something tangible."  "Tangible?" echoed Honey.  "It's a social 

triumph!"  In his fine, round hand, Skinner inscribed in the little book the following:-- 

_Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_                                      One social 

triumph.   He passed the record over for Honey's approval.  "And, oh, goodie," Honey cried, "we're 

all prepared for it!  Not a penny to spend!  Now, don't you dare to think of anything!--is there?" 

"You're right, Honey, you're right," Skinner almost shouted.  He paused abruptly; then, in a hoarse 

whisper, "Say, Honey, you know how to dance?"  Honey stared at him wide-eyed.  "Why--ye-es--I 

waltz."  "That's archaic.  Do you know the new things, those cubist proposition dances where you 

glide and side-step and pause and back up and go ahead again and zigzag like an inebriated 

politician?"  "You mean the turkey trot and the tango and the one-step and the fox trot and the 

hesitation?" Honey rattled off glibly.  "Is it necessary to learn them all?" said Skinner.  They looked 

at each other for a few moments without a word.  "No use--we've got to do it, Honey."  "But that 

means money.  We've only got two weeks, and that means private lessons!  And private lessons 

mean lots of money!"  "Honey," said Skinner solemnly, "we've invested in this dress-suit engine of 

conquest.  It's no good unless we use it.  We must learn the most effective way to use it or all the 

first cost will be wasted. Besides, it won't cost much to learn to dance.  There are places on Sixth 

Avenue--"  Honey held up both hands.  "Mercy, Dearie, if you learn to dance on Sixth Avenue, 

you'll have the Sixth-Avenue stamp to you.  The men who dance on Sixth Avenue hire their dress 

suits on Third Avenue--it all goes together.  Heavens," she sighed, breaking off abruptly, "have we 

built up a Frankenstein monster?  Is that dress suit of yours going to prove as voracious as the 

fabled boa my dying oath on it!"  The woman was now very near to them. She raised her head, 

and Tom started back in affright as he recognised the face of Aunt Leth.  "Tom," she said, holding 

out her hand.  But Tom, holding his hands out-stretched before him, shrank from her as she 

advanced.  "Tom," said Garden, "you know Mrs. Lethbridge?"  "Yes," replied Tom, in the voice of a 

man who was utterly dazed, "I know her."  "Would she knowingly deceive you? Would she, whose 

one great hope is that of saving Miss Farebrother's life, knowingly tell you a lie?"  "No; she could 

not, she could not!"  "Mrs. Lethbridge," said Garden, "what is the colour of the dress you are 

wearing?"  "Pink," said Aunt Leth, with wistful trembling.  "Pink!" muttered Tom. "Am I going mad?" 

"And here is Mr. Cornwall," said Garden, as Fred joined them. "Fred, what is the colour of the 

dress Mrs. Lethbridge has on?"  "Pink," said Fred.  "Mrs. Pamflett's favourite colour," said Garden. 

"The colour of the dress she wore when you saw her here on the night of the murder."  "If you've 

got any pity in you, sir," implored Tom, "tell me what all this means!"  "It means, Tom," answered 

Garden, "that Miss Farebrother is saved, and her innocence proved. It means, Tom, that you are 

colour-blind. By the mercy of God this has been discovered in time. See to Mrs. Lethbridge, Fred; 

she is fainting!"     CHAPTER XVI.  JEREMIAH AND HIS MOTHER DISAPPEAR.   That was the 

busiest of days. There was so much for Richard Garden to do that the wonder was how the young 

fellow got through it. There were reports from Kiss and Linton to receive from time to time; 

interviews to be held with the Home Secretary; interviews also with the judge and with the lawyers 

for the prosecution; test examinations of Tom Barley by experts in colour-blindness; excursions to 

Scotland Yard; and a thousand matters to be attended to. Other persons were busy as well. There 

was sunshine once more in Aunt Leth's house; the family were looking forward with eager 



impatience to the joy of their dear girl's release; the room which Phoebe shared with Fanny was 

made bright with 


_
"This dress suit is going to get all it wants to eat," said Skinner with finality.  Honey was frightened 

at Dearie's newly developed stamina.  Skinner, the acquiescent one, putting his foot down like 

that!  "But, Dearie," she urged, "it isn't absolutely necessary for us to learn to dance.  And, 

remember, you promised not to spend any more money."  "I told you my dress suit was our engine 

of conquest--plant!  You buy your machinery--your plant.  That's the initial cost.  Then you have to 

learn how to run it."  He took out his little book and put down:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_ 

_Debit_                         _Credit_    Operating expenses.   "But you _promised_," Honey persisted. 

"That was before we got this invitation.  Things have changed. _Promised_ not to spend any more 

money?  What about my being a ribbons; every bit of furniture in the house was polished, every 

saucepan lid scoured. Uncle Leth came home early from the bank, loaded with delicacies for 

Phoebe. Yes; everything was for Phoebe. Clean linen on every bed, a fire in every room, her own 

chair here in this corner, on the table the books she loved, the piano open, with her favourite 

songs ready, her desk looking like new, with fresh ink and pens and paper--everywhere spiritual 

signs of love. "Oh mamma, mamma!" sighed Fanny again and again, and, clasped in each other's 

arms, the mother and daughter wept happy tears, and kissed and laughed, and then broke into 

tears again. "But we must be patient, darling," said Aunt Leth. "See what Fred says in this 

telegram--'It cannot be to-day. There are formalities to be gone through. I have seen Phoebe. She 

knows something, but not all. I 


_
proposition, eh?"--and Honey was convicted by her own words.  "But, Dearie, what _will_ this 

dress suit get us into?"  "Debt!--if we don't look out!"  Honey crossed to Dearie, put her head on 

his shoulder, and began to cry softly.  "There, there," said Skinner, stroking her glossy hair, "don't 

you cry, Honey.  There's nothing to worry about."  She lifted her face and smiled.  "There _is n't_ 

anything to worry about, is there?  We have n't anywhere near spent that five hundred and twenty 

dollars, have we?"  "No," said Skinner grimly, "not yet!"  He disengaged himself from Honey's 

reluctant arms and slowly mounted the stairs.  Once inside his room, he turned and locked the 

door, still smiling grimly.  He strode to the closet, flung the door open, lifted his dress suit from its 

peg, and held it at arm's length where it swayed like a scarecrow.  "My God, you're a Nemesis!" he 

growled.  "There's one for you--there's another!"  He punched the thing hard and fast.  "That's you, 

Skinner--that's you--for being an ass--a blooming, silly ass!"  When he rejoined Honey in the 

dining-room he was smiling, not grimly now, but placidly.  "What is it, Dearie?" she asked.  "Just 

got something off my chest, that's all."  The words suggested something to Skinner; whenever his 

exasperation at his folly was too great for him to bear, he'd go upstairs and take it out on the dress 

suit.  And the idea comforted him not a little!  So the Skinners put themselves in charge of a first-

class dancing instructor just off Fifth Avenue.  For two solid weeks, every day Honey met Dearie 

after office hours and they practiced trotting the fox trot, stepping the one-step, and negotiating the 

tango and the hesitation. Skinner was thorough in his dancing, as in everything else.  He was 

quick to learn, light on his feet, and soon was an expert and graceful dancer.  At the end of the 

brief term Skinner wrote down in his little book:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_ 

_Debit_                         _Credit_    Instruction in dancing            A certain stimulation   for two, 

since the dress-         due to dancing which   suit engine of conquest           quickens the mental 

needs two to run it ... $60.00    forces and makes one                                     happier and more 

alert                                     at his work.   The two weeks' loyal devotion to the art of Terpsichore 

made Skinner at the Crawford dance no less conspicuous as a dancer than as a man of 

distinguished presence.  He found himself greatly in demand, and he made the quick calculation 

that this new enhancement of his value was due to his dancing--which, in turn, was due to--the 

dress suit!  Early in the evening Mrs. Crawford, the hostess, introduced Skinner to Mrs. Stephen 

Colby, the magnate's wife, and Skinner asked for a dance. And as he led that lady to the ballroom, 

he formulated the following entry in his notebook to be jotted down at the first opportunity: "Credit, 

dress-suit account, one dance with the wife of a multi-millionaire--a social arbiter.  An event 

undreamed of, even in my most ambitious moments!  What next, I wonder?"  Mrs. Colby had a 

way of commenting upon other persons present with a certain cynical frankness--as became a 

social arbiter--that amused Skinner, and he took a genuine fancy to her.  The wine of the dance 

got into his blood, and when the music ceased, he begged for another dance.  "Certainly," said 

Mrs. Colby, "two, if you like.  That's all I've got left.  Anything to get rid of that devilish bore, Jimmy 

Brewster.  He's coming over here now."  The doubtful nature of the compliment struck Skinner's 

sense of humor, and he laughed outright.  "What's up?" asked the social arbiter.  "Of two evils--" 

Skinner began.  "But you're a devilish good dancer, and you don't chatter to me all the time." 

Later in the evening.  Skinner made the following entry in his little book;--                     _Dress-Suit 

Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_                                      Two more dances with a 

social arbiter.  That's what's                                     next!  Going some, I reckon.  Between dances, 



young Crawford took Skinner by the arm.  "Come into the den and have a wee nippie."  In the den 

Skinner found a group of millionaires and multi-millionaires, smoking, drinking casually, and talking 

in quiet, good-natured tones.  For the first time in his life, he was really mixing with the rich.  No 

one there knew what Skinner's position in the business say in the prison that she is an angel. She 

sends you her dearest love. I cannot come to you. Dick and I are very busy. God bless you all!' So 

you see, Fanny, we _must_ be patient." Telegrams were flying to and fro all the day. 'Melia Jane 

was wild with joy. "Tom may come now when he likes," she said, "and I shall have a beautiful 

fortune to tell him." But Tom did not come to the house, nor did he send a message, of even a 

single word.  At eight o'clock in the evening Fred was alone in his rooms, waiting for Kiss, who had 

arranged to come for him. In company with Linton and a policeman in private clothes they were to 

follow Jeremiah and his mother when those two left their lodgings to meet the woman who had 

stolen the bracelet. They were not acquainted with the place of meeting, but it had been settled 

that the Pamfletts should be stealthily followed, and that steps should be taken to overhear what 

took place between them and the woman, and that afterward the three should be arrested. Garden 

could not form one of the party: he had too much to attend to.  It was destined, however, that this 

carefully-laid plan was not to be carried out. Everything else had succeeded, but this part of the 

programme of action was doomed to failure.  Kiss did not appear until half past eight, and when he 

entered the room Fred divined from the distress depicted in his face that something had gone 

wrong. His first words were:  "They have escaped us, Mr. Cornwall."  "Escaped you!" cried Fred, in 

great excitement.  "Yes. It is an unfortunate fact. I could beat my head against the wall. Whether 

their suspicions were aroused, or whether they had previously decided upon some course of 

action of which we were in ignorance, I cannot say; but they have disappeared, and so 

mysteriously that we don't know what to make of it."  "You, or one of you, saw them go, surely?" 

"No, sir, we did not; and that is the strangest part of it. We all thought they were in their rooms; 

nothing had been heard of them for three or four hours, and we supposed they were asleep. At 

last Mrs. Linton came down from her cupboard, and said she did not know what to think of it, but it 

really seemed to her as if their rooms must be empty. Upon this the landlady said she would go up 

and ask them whether they required anything, and she did so; a minute afterward she called to us 

to come up, and we went. Their rooms _were_ empty; the fiends had disappeared; and that they 

were gone for good was proved by their having taken certain things with them which, if they had 

only gone on an errand, they need not have touched."  "Perhaps they will come back," said Fred. 

"Not they, sir," said Kiss, shaking his head. "They are a cunning pair, and they know what they are 

about. They have thrown us off the scent, Mr. Cornwall; there's no doubt in my mind about that." 

Fred considered a moment. "You have the address of the woman they were to meet?"  "Yes, Mr. 

Cornwall."  "Give it to me. I will rattle there in a cab, and if I cannot learn anything about her, I will 

join you at No. 12."  "You will find it difficult to obtain any information of her, sir."  "Money will 

accomplish anything. I shall find out what I want to know."  Promising the cabman double fare if he 

drove at his fastest pace, Fred, in less than half an hour, arrived at the woman's lodgings. The 

landlady, as Kiss had foreseen, was disinclined to speak of her lodger, but a tip of half a sovereign 

and the promise of another loosened her tongue.  "I don't see, after all," said the landlady, "why I 

shouldn't oblige you. She has left the rooms, and is not coming back."  Then she related how the 

woman had gone away in an open manner, saying that she was about to leave England, and did 



not intend to return. She was not going abroad alone; some friends were going with her. That was 

all.  "Can you tell me her name?" asked Fred.  The landlady replied that she did not know it.  That 

was the extent of the information Fred could obtain; and there was nothing for it but to go back to 

Surrey Street and ascertain whether anything had been heard of the Pamfletts. Nothing had been 

heard, and none of the neighbours could enlighten them. It was evident that they must have taken 

the greatest pains to get out of the neighbourhood unobserved.  When Garden was informed of 

what had taken place he was inexpressibly annoyed. It happened that Tom Barley was with him 

when Fred was giving an account of the occurrence.  "Ah, well," said Garden, presently, "we must 

make the best of it. We must put the police on their guard immediately. The night trains 


_
Skinner was not trumpeting the fact that he was only a "cage man." Skinner had many original 

ideas, which, because of a certain lack of assertiveness, he'd never been able to exploit. 

McLaughlin and Perkins had always looked upon him only as a counter of money and a keeper of 

accounts.  But now he was out of his cage.  He talked with these men as he never knew he could 

talk.  As a "cage man," Skinner had always dealt with men of small caliber, who were ever in a 

hurry.  If he chanced to meet one of these on the street or in a restaurant and undertook to exploit 

his ideas, the other always seemed bored.  His attitude was, "Skinner is only a machine--what 

does he know about real business?"  But the men he was now mixing with in the den seemed to 

have the leisure of the gods on their hands.  They were not bored.  They listened with keen 

interest to what he had to say.  Skinner observed that Continent must be watched, and to-morrow 

we will offer a reward for their apprehension. I may manage to get an advertisement in some of the 

papers to-night. I have seen Mr. Quinlan, the wealthy owner of the stolen bracelet, and he has 

admitted that it was the genuine one which was stolen. He said he told the story to the police and 

the reporters in order that he should not be annoyed. 'I am rich enough to be able to afford such a 

loss,' he said. Wish we were--eh, Fred? I doubt whether I should have succeeded in prevailing 

upon him to let me pursue the case had I not informed him that in connection with it was a 

diabolical murder, for which an innocent girl had been condemned to death. 'The man who has the 

bracelet,' I said, 'is the man who committed the murder, and he and another laid an infernal plot to 

bring a beautiful girl to a shameful end.' This excited him, and he has given me

fact:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_                         _Credit_

than talkers.   But when they did talk at all, they talked to the expenses. So to-morrow we will offer 

a reward of five hundred pounds for the apprehension of Jeremiah Pamflett and his mother. It is 

good to know that their disappearance will not retard Miss Farebrother's release; everything is in 

training for that happy event. Ill as I can afford it, I would give something out of my 


_
And later Skinner jotted down:--                     _Dress-Suit Account_             _Debit_ 

_Credit_                                      One new experience.  Heard                                     much big talk 

that was not                                     hot air!   There was a fascination to it all.  Skinner felt that 

somehow he was sitting in a big game--sitting on the edge, perhaps, but rubbing shoulders with 

some of the men who actually shaped the affairs of the business world.  The realization stimulated 

him, lifted him up.  And when he went to claim his next dance with the social arbiter, takes place 

to-night between the murderers and thieves."  To some extent, the late editions of the newspapers 

on the following day supplied him and the country with the intelligence he desired to obtain: 

"THE MURDER OF MISER FAREBROTHER.--THE MYSTERY OF THE DIAMOND 

BRACELET.--STRANGE REVELATIONS.  "The painful interest excited in the public mind by the 

trial of Miss Farebrother for the murder of her father, Miser Farebrother--a crime of which, in the 

teeth of the verdict, the young lady is now incontestably proved to be innocent--will be revived by 

the account we now publish of an outrage which took place last night,
