 England. A few=20

years since, comparatively speaking, people only knew their way from York t=

the objects on the road--now, by the economy of guide books they may know e=
very good inn in=20

France, and carry the _ichnography_ of the kingdom in their coat pocket. In=
 the present edition of=20

the "Road Book of France," attention has been paid to the description of th=
e delightful South,=20

especially of Bordeaux, the mineral springs and bathing-places of the Pyren=
ees, the navigation of=20

the Rhone from Lyons to Avignon, as well as of Marseilles, Toulouse, &c., a=
nd some of the=20

principal towns have been illustrated with plans. Dipping into the Itinerar=
y from Calais to Paris, we=20

were reminded of a curious coincidence: Julius Caesar is supposed to have s=
ailed from Boulogne=20

on his expedition against the Britons; and in later times, Napoleon Bonapar=
te there prepared to=20

carry into execution the invasion of Great Britain. But how different have =
been the results!          *=20

me with many shreds=20

of wit and humour, and occasional patches of "righte merrie conceite," has =
just fallen into our=20

hands, and has afforded us some very pleasant reading. There is fun in the =
very title, "Personal=20

Narrative of a Journey overland from the Bank to Barnes, &c. with some acco=
unt of the Regions=20

east of Kensington. By an Inside Passenger. With a Model for a Magazine, be=
ing the product of=20

the Author's sojourn at the village of Barnes, during five rainy days." The=
 author is a shrewd,=20

clever fellow, who loves a little raillery on the follies of the day, and j=
oins with our friend, Popanilla=20

in deploring the present artificial state of society; therefore, suppose we=
 give a few _flying_=20

extracts from his tour, premising that the good people of the little villag=
es through which he=20

passed, are not aware of what good things he has said of them; for his litt=
le book would suit every=20

and nearly deserted=20

barony of Brentford still contains, in its monuments and antiquities, vesti=

she had borne their standard when they were betrayed at fatal Aspromonte.  =
The sun had sunk=20

behind the mountains, but was still high in the western heaven, when a moun=
ted lancer was=20

observed descending a distant pass into the valley. The general and his sta=
ff had not long=20

commenced their principal meal of the day, of which the disappearance of th=
e sun behind the peak=20

was the accustomed signal. This permitted them, without inconvenience, to t=
ake their simple=20

repast in the open, but still warm, air. Theodora was seated between the ge=
neral and her=20

husband, and her eye was the first that caught the figure of the distant bu=
t descending stranger.=20

=E2=80=9CWhat is that?=E2=80=9D she asked.  The general, immediately using =
his telescope, after a moment=E2=80=99s=20

examination, said: =E2=80=9CA lancer of the royal guard.=E2=80=9D  All eyes=
 were now fixed upon the movements of=20

the horseman. He had descended the winding steep, and now was tracking the =
craggy path which=20

led into the plain. As he reached the precinct of the camp, he was challeng=
ed, but not detained.=20

Nearer and nearer he approached, and it was evident, from his uniform, that=
 the conjecture of his=20

character by the general was correct.  =E2=80=9CA deserter from the guard,=
=E2=80=9D whispered Colonel Campian, to=20

Lothair.  The horseman was conducted by an officer to the presence of the c=
ommander. When=20

that presence was reached, the lancer, still silent, slowly lowered his tal=
l weapon, and offered the=20

general the dispatch which was fastened to the head of his spear.  Every ey=
e was on the=20

countenance of their chief as he perused the missive, but that countenance =
was always=20

inscrutable. It was observed, however, that he read the paper twice. Lookin=
g up, the general said,=20

to the officer: =E2=80=9CSee that the bearer is well quartered.=E2=80=94Thi=
s is for you,=E2=80=9D he added in a low voice to=20



Theodora, and he gave her an enclosure; =E2=80=9Cread it quietly, and then =
come into my tent.=E2=80=9D  Theodora=20

read the letter, and quietly; though, without the preparatory hint, it migh=
t have been difficult to have=20

concealed her emotion. Then, after a short pause, she rose, and the general=
, requesting his=20

companions not to disturb themselves, joined her, and they proceeded in sil=
ence to his tent.  =E2=80=9CHe=20

is arrested,=E2=80=9D said the=20


_
opposite the "Bell and Feathers" is to the antiquarian a most particularly =
interesting _morceau_;=20

the verdure of age has defaced it in part, but enough still remains to prov=
e that our ancestors had=20

made no mean proficiency in the rustic style of architecture. The reservoir=
, which contains the=20

sparkling element so grateful to that noble animal, is modelled from the ce=
lebrated sarcophagus in=20

the British Museum; and the posts which support it are evidently Doric. On =
the outside of it are=20

several nearly obliterated specimens of carving, as well as drawings in cha=
lk.  Nearly parallel with=20

the horse-trough, as you go down "Maud's Rents," is that useful, and indeed=
 indispensible,=20

triumph of hydraulics, the pump. The taste and science displayed in its exe=
cution do credit to the=20

engineer; and the soil in which it is imbedded, being argillaceous, partial=
ly encrusted with=20

strontian, reflects equal honour on his geological attainments. This pump, =
which you approach by=20

three steps, is perpendicular, and of an elegant appearance; and forms the =
chief ornament of the=20

"Rents." The handle is of wrought iron, highly polished; the snout copper, =
studded with hobnails. It=20

is neatly coated with white paint, and bears on its front the following ins=
cription, which I have=20

copied for the gratification of the curious in antiquarian research.    Thi=
s Pump was erected,   and=20

Well sunk,   A.D. 1824,   from the proceeds of a Charity Sermon,   preached=
   in the Parish Church=20

of this Parish,   by his Grace the Bishop   of Bath and Wells.   *  *  *   =
Peter Broddupp,   Overseer,=20

Slingsby Stygle, and John Moles,   Churchwardens.   *  *  *   N.B. Whoever =
washes Fish at this=20

Pump   will be prosecuted.  I cannot take leave of this interesting town wi=
thout noticing the church.=20

It is surmounted by a neat steeple, cut in wood, in the pointed style of ar=
chitecture; on the top of=20

which is a goodly key, to indicate the wind,--which, the inhabitants remark=
, has blown due south=20

for the last ten years. The porch, which is a curious specimen of the Maeso=
-Gothic, is rather hurt=20

by the simplicity of the scrapers, which, being merely segments of iron hoo=
ps, do not harmonize=20

with the otherwise elaborate approach.  _Tossbury._  The demesne of Tossbur=
y (by Camden=20

written Tossbery) was anciently a grant in feoffment to the College of Phys=
icians by King John. On=20

the spot now occupied by the burial grounds formerly stood their college; a=
nd here they flourished=20

until the population, originally abundant, diminished so alarmingly, as to =
induce them to remove to=20

Warwick Lane.  Mr. P. (the landlord of the inn,) ever ready to shew his gue=
sts what at that village=20

are esteemed great curiosities, was indefatigable in explaining the various=
 instances in which he=20

has made science subservient to utility. The staircase, as far as the great=
 dining-room, he has, at=20

considerable expense, macadamized; to Alessandria, where he is a close pris=
oner. =E2=80=98Tis a blow,=20

but I am more grieved than surprised.=E2=80=9D  This was the arrest of Gari=
baldi at Sinigaglia by the Italian=20

government, which had been communicated at Hexham House to Monsignore Berwi=
ck by his=20

evening visitor.  =E2=80=9CHow will it affect operations in the field?=E2=
=80=9D inquired Theodora.  =E2=80=9CAccording to this=20

dispatch, in no degree. Our original plan is to be pursued, and acted upon =
the moment we are=20

ready. That should be in a fortnight, or perhaps three weeks. Menotti is to=
 take the command on=20

the southern frontier. Well, it may prevent jealousies. I think I shall sen=
d Sarano there to=20

reconnoitre; he is well both with Nicotera and Ghirelli, and may keep thing=
s straight.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut there=20

are other affairs besides operations in the field,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =
=E2=80=9Cand scarcely less critical. Read=20

this,=E2=80=9D and she gave him the enclosure, which ran in these words:  =
=E2=80=9CThe general will tell thee what=20

has happened. Have no fear for that. All will go right. It will not alter o=
ur plans a bunch of grapes.=20

Be perfectly easy about this country. No Italian soldier will ever cross th=
e frontier except to combat=20

the French. Write that on thy heart. Are other things as well? Other places=
? My advices are bad.=20



All the prelates are on their knees to him=E2=80=94with blessings on their =
lips and curses in their pockets.=20

Archbishop of Paris is as bad as any. Berwick is at Biarritz=E2=80=94an ine=
xhaustible intriguer; the only=20

priest I fear. I hear from one who never misled me that the Polhes brigade =
has orders to be in=20

readiness. The Mary-Anne societies are not strong enough for the situation=
=E2=80=94too local; he listens=20

to them, but he has given no pledge. We must go deeper. =E2=80=98Tis an aff=
air of =E2=80=98Madre Natura.=E2=80=99 Thou=20

must see Colonna.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CColonna is at Rome,=E2=80=9D said the =
general, =E2=80=9Cand cannot be spared. He is acting=20

president of the National Committee, and has enough upon his hands.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI must see him,=E2=80=9D said=20

Theodora.  =E2=80=9CI had hoped I had heard the last of the =E2=80=98Madre =
Natura,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D said the general with an air of=20

discontent.  =E2=80=9CAnd the Neapolitans hope they have heard the last of =
the eruptions of their=20

mountain,=E2=80=9D said Theodora; =E2=80=9Cbut the necessities of things ar=
e sterner stuff than the hopes of men.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CIts last effort appalled and outraged Europe,=E2=80=9D said the ge=
neral.  =E2=80=9CIts last effort forced the French=20

into Italy, and has freed the country from the Alps to the Adriatic,=E2=80=
=9D rejoined Theodora.  =E2=80=9CIf the great=20

man had only been as quiet as we have been,=E2=80=9D said the general, ligh=
ting a cigar, =E2=80=9Cwe might have=20

been in Rome by this time.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf the great man had been qui=
et, we should not have had a volunteer=20

in our valley,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CMy faith in him is implicit=
; he has been right in every thing, and has=20

never failed except when he has been betrayed. I see no hope for Rome excep=
t in his convictions=20

and energy. I do not wish to die, and feel I have devoted my life only to s=
ecure the=20


_
and scrapers attached to the chamber-doors, our worthy host assured us, was=
 infinitely preferable=20

to marble. He begged us to be under no apprehension as to the dampness of o=
ur beds, as they=20

were warmed by a steam-apparatus of his own contrivance. He always keeps a =
Leyden jar, about=20

the size of a boiler, ready charged, wherewith he kills geese, turkeys, and=
 even lamb; which, he=20

affirms, is a much less shocking method of neutralizing the vital spark tha=
n the vulgar butchery of=20

twisting and sticking. He has lost three of his fingers, through incautious=
ly handling a whose=20

impostures have degraded mine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh! those priests!=E2=80=
=9D exclaimed the general. =E2=80=9CI really do not much=20

care for any thing else. They say the Savoyard is not a bad comrade, and at=
 any rate he can=20

charge like a soldier. But those priests? I fluttered them once! Why did I =
spare any? Why did I not=20

burn down St. Peter=E2=80=99s? I proposed it, but Mirandola, with his histo=
ry and his love of art and all that=20

old furniture, would reserve it for a temple of the true God and for the gl=
ory of Europe! Fine results=20

we have accomplished! And now we are here, hardly knowing where we are,=20
