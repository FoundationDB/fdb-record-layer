became redder than ever. Then for an instant he let up in his heaves as if =
to take breath for a new=20

and more furious attack.  It was a fatal pause. Until that moment Teeny-bit=
s had been content to=20

cling on and make a defensive fight of it. Now suddenly he changed his tact=
ics to the offensive. By=20

clever leg-work he got Bassett lurching backward. He pressed home his advan=
tage and while a=20

shout of amazement and delight rang in his ears, brought his big antagonist=
 down to the floor with=20

a jar that made the windows rattle.  Bassett, the Whirlwind, lay on his bac=
k, half dazed with=20

amazement and feeling too weak to rise because most of the wind seemed to h=
ave been knocked=20

out of him. Once more, as of old, David had slain Goliath, and the victor w=
as receiving=20

congratulations.  At that moment a boy larger than any who had been in the =
room pushed his way=20

through the crowd. "No fighting in the dormitory!" he cried. "What's all th=
is about?" And then he=20

saw Bassett just rising weakly to a sitting posture and observed the other =
boys slapping Teeny-bits=20

on the back. He gazed in doubt from one to the other and then said to the d=
iminutive conqueror:=20

"Did you put this big lummux down?"  "You bet he did!" cried a dozen voices=
.  "Well, you did a=20

mighty good job," he declared. "You're new here, but a lot of these other f=
ellows are not, and they=20

know as well as I do that we're not supposed to fight or have wrestling mat=
ches in the dormitories.=20

Get on your feet there, Bassett, and mind your own business hereafter. I kn=
ow well enough that=20

you started this. You got just what you deserved, didn't you!"  In an autho=
ritative way that was=20

confident without being "bossy" he ordered the boys out of the room, and wh=
en the last of them=20

had gone and the sound of their joking remarks to the crestfallen Bassett w=
as receding, he said to=20

Teeny-bits:  "You must be a whale of a scrapper for your size--and I'm migh=
ty glad you gave that=20

fresh-mouthed Bassett a good lesson. But don't get into any more trouble wi=
th him. You know we=20

have a sort of self-government here, and we can't be smashing up things in =
the dormitory. I room=20

downstairs in Number 26. of the numerator, in which it occurs, must be chan=
ged; and should the=20

total value of the expression be negative, _x_ must be taken below C.   PRO=
POSITION VI.    To=20

determine that system of temperaments for the concords of   the changeable =
scale, which will=20

render it, including every   consideration, the most harmonious possible.  =
We can scarcely expect=20

to find any direct analytical process, which will furnish us with a solutio=
n of this complicated=20

problem, at a single operation. We shall therefore content ourselves with a=
 method which=20

gradually approximates towards the desired results. The best position of an=
y given degree, as C,=20

supposing all the rest fixed, is determined by the last proposition. In the=
 same manner it is evident=20

that the constitution of the whole scale will be the best possible, when no=
 degree in it can be=20

elevated or depressed, without rendering the sums of the products there ref=
erred to, unequal. We=20

can approximate to this state of the scale, by applying the theorem in Prop=
. V. to each of the=20

degrees successively. It is not essential in what order the application is =
made; but for the sake of=20

uniformity, in the successive approximations, we will begin with that degre=
e which has the greatest=20

sum _a_ + _a_ + _b_ + &c. belonging to it, and proceed regularly to that in=
 which it is least.=20

Making the equal temperament of Prop. III., (in which the Vths, IIIds, and =
3ds are flattened, 154,=20

77 and 77, respectively.) the standard from which to commence the alteratio=
ns in the scale=20

required by the unequal frequency of different chords, and beginning with D=
, the theorem gives=20

_x_ =3D 5. Hence supposing the rest of the degrees in the scale unaltered, =
it will be in the most=20

harmonious state, when D is raised 5/540 of a comma. For by the last propos=
ition, the=20

temperament of the six concords affected by changing the place of D is best=
 distributed, and that=20



of the other concords is not at all affected. We will now proceed to the se=
cond degree in the scale,=20

viz. A; in which the application of the theorem gives _x_ =3D 13. In this a=
pplication, however, as D=20

was before raised 5, _m_, the temperament of the Vth below=20

Later in the day Teeny-bits learned that his visitor was Neil Durant, pitch=
er on the baseball team,=20

and captain of the football eleven. He was dormitory leader, which meant th=
at he represented=20

Gannett Hall on the self-government committee of the school. Turner, who ga=
ve Teeny-bits the=20

information, was only one of many boys who dropped in that day to see the c=
onqueror of Bassett,=20

the Whirlwind. Turner--the same taken 154 + 5; and in all the succeeding op=
erations, when the=20

exterior termination of any concord has been already altered, we must take =
its temperament, not=20

what it was at first, but what it has become, by such previous alteration. =
In this manner, the scale=20

is becoming more harmonious at every step, till we have completed the whole=
 succession of=20

degrees which it contains.  Let us now revert to D, the place=20


_
Turner who had been willing enough for combat earlier in the morning--confe=
ssed with a grin that=20

he was pretty glad Teeny-bits hadn't wrestled with him! "If I'd hit the flo=
or as hard as Bassett did,=20

I'd bet my backbone would have been broken into forty pieces," he said. "Oh=
, what a pippin of a=20

thump!"  Teeny-bits liked Turner's frank, outspoken way. He made up his min=
d that he liked him=20

still better when Turner said:  "None of the fellows call me Terrible Turne=
r, you know--that was just=20

some bunk that Bassett invented. They all call me Snubby--on account of my =
nose, I guess."  That=20

noon an incident occurred that some of the roomers in Gannett Hall noticed:=
 just before lunch=20

Teeny-bits' trunk came. Mr. Holbrook brought it up from the village in a bu=
ggy drawn by a sorrel=20

horse and with Teeny-bits' help carried it to the room on the third floor. =
Several of the boys=20

remembered seeing Mr. Holbrook in outer extremities of the chords which are=
 terminated by D has=20

been changed, a new application of the theorem will give a second correctio=
n for the place of D;=20

although, as the numbers _a_, _a'_, _b_, &c. continue the same, it will be =
less than before.=20

Continue the process through the whole scale, and a second approximation to=
 the most=20

harmonious state will be obtained. In this manner let the theorem be applie=
d, till the value of _x_ is=20

exhausted, for every degree; and it will then be in the most harmonious sta=
te possible. Three=20

operations gave the following results:   TABLE V.    +------+-----------+--=
