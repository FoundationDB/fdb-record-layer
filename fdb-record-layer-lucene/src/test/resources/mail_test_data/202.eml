the patronymic of Vaidhatra. The identity between the Kumaras, the Builders=
 or cosmic Dhyan=20

Chohans, and the Seven Angels of the Stars, will be found without one singl=
e flaw if their=20

respective biographies are studied, and especially the characteristics of t=
heir chiefs, Sanat-

Kumara (Sanat Sujata), and Michael the Archangel. Together with the Kabirim=
 (Planets), the name=20

of the above in Chaldaea, they were all "_divine_ Powers" (Forces). Fuerot =
says that the name=20

Kabiri was used to denote the _seven_ sons of {~HEBREW LETTER YOD~}{~HEBREW=
 LETTER=20

TSADI~}{~HEBREW LETTER DALET~}{~HEBREW LETTER YOD~}{~HEBREW LETTER QOF~}=20

meaning Pater Sadic, Cain, or Jupiter, or again of Jehovah. There are seven=
 Kumaras--four=20

exoteric and three secret--the names of the latter being found in the _Sank=
hya Bhashya_, by=20

Gaudapadacharya.(605) They are all "Virgin Gods," who remain eternally pure=
 and innocent and=20

decline to create progeny. In their primitive aspect, these Aryan seven "mi=
nd-born sons" of God=20

are not the regents of the planets, but dwell far beyond the planetary regi=
on. But the same=20

mysterious transference from one character or dignity to another is found i=
n the Christian Angel-

scheme. The "Seven Spirits of the Presence" attend perpetually on God, and =
yet we find them=20

under the same names of Mikael, Gabriel, Raphael, etc., as "Star-regents" o=
r the informing deities=20

of the seven planets. Suffice it to say that the Archangel Michael is calle=
d "the invincible virgin=20

combatant" as he "refused to create,"(606) which would connect him with bot=
h Sana Sujata and=20

the Kumara who is the God of War.  The above has to be demonstrated by a fe=
w quotations.=20

Commenting upon St. John's "Seven Golden Candlesticks," Cornelius a Lapide =
says:       These=20

seven lights relate to the seven branches of the candlestick     by which w=
ere represented the=20

seven [principal] planets in the     temples of Moses and Solomon ... or, b=
etter still, to the seven=20

principal Spirits, commissioned to watch over the salvation of men     and =
churches.   St. Jerome=20

says:       In truth the candlestick with the seven branches was the type o=
f     the world and its=20

planets.   St. Thomas Aquinas, the great Roman Catholic doctor writes:     =
  I do not remember=20

having ever met in the works of saints or     philosophers a denial that th=
e planets are guided by=20

spiritual     beings.... It seems to me that it may be proved to demonstrat=
ion     that the celestial=20

bodies are guided by some intelligence, either     directly by God, or by t=
he mediation of angels.=20

darkness in which=20

our illusions are lost, the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled =
and swallowed up. He=20

remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a wom=
an and he thought with=20

alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine, and at the same time=
 so vigorous an=20

organization as that of Raoul.  In recalling all he had been through, he fo=
resaw all that Raoul might=20

suffer; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed=
 in his heart was=20

pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man.  At this mo=
ment Raoul awoke,=20

without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude; his eyes were f=
ixed on those of Athos=20

and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was=
 awaiting his=20

awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress, for his glance, =
in return, had all the=20

tenderness of love.  "You are there, sir?" he said, respectfully.  "Yes, Ra=
oul," replied the count.=20

"And you did not awaken me?"  "I wished to leave you still to enjoy some mo=
ments of sleep, my=20

child; you must be fatigued from yesterday."  "Oh, sir, how good you are!" =
 Athos smiled.  "How do=20

you feel this morning?" he inquired.  "Perfectly well; quite rested, sir." =
 "You are still growing,"=20

Athos continued, with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown m=
an for a youth.  "Oh,=20



sir, I beg your pardon!" exclaimed Raoul, ashamed of so much attention; "in=
 an instant I shall be=20

dressed."  Athos then called Olivain.  "Everything," said Olivain to Athos,=
 "has been done=20

according to your directions; the horses are waiting."  "And I was asleep,"=
 cried Raoul, "whilst you,=20

sir, you had the kindness to attend to all these details. Truly, sir, you o=
verwhelm me with benefits!"=20

"Therefore you love me a little, I hope," replied Athos, in a tone of emoti=
on.  "Oh, sir! God knows=20

how much I love, revere you."  "See that you forget nothing," said Athos, a=
ppearing to look about=20

him, that he might hide his emotion.  "No, indeed, sir," answered Raoul.  T=
he servant then=20

approached Athos and said, hesitatingly:  "Monsieur le vicomte has no sword=
."  "'Tis well," said=20

Athos, "I will take care of that."  They went downstairs, Raoul looking eve=
ry now and then at the=20

count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand, but Athos was silent. W=
hen they reached the=20

steps Raoul saw three horses.  "Oh, sir! then you are going with me?"  "I w=
ill accompany you a=20

portion of the way," said=20

opinion seems to be far more consonant with the order of things     asserte=
d by St. Denys to be=20

without exception, that everything on     earth is, as a rule, governed by =
God through intermediary=20

agencies.(607)   And now let the reader recall what the Pagans say of this.=
 All the classical=20

authors and philosophers who have treated the subject, repeat with Hermes T=
rismegistus, that the=20

  Athos mounted more=20

slowly, after speaking in a low voice to the lackey, who, instead of follow=
ing them immediately,=20

returned to their rooms. Raoul, delighted at the count's companionship, per=
ceived, or affected to=20

perceive nothing of this byplay.  They set out, passing over the Pont Neuf;=
 they pursued their way=20

along the quay then called L'Abreuvoir Pepin, and went along by the walls o=
f the Grand Chatelet.=20

They proceeded to the Rue=20
