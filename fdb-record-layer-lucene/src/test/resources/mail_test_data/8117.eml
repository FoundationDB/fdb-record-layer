 In the treatment of these points and problems the person desirous of solvi=

reliable there are. Fifty-seven of 59 launch attempts were successful last =
year. By comparison, in 1963, only 55 out of 70 launch attempts met the sam=
e happy fate.  American aerospace multinationals closely collaborate with o=

claims to have received a penalty waiver "from some of its creditors".  Rus=
sia has settled the $1.7=20

billion owed it by Vietnam last year. The original debt - of $11 billion - =
was reduced by 85 percent=20

and spread over 23 years. Details are scarce, but observers believe that Ru=
ssia has extracted=20

trade and extraction concessions as well as equity in Vietnamese enterprise=
s.  But Russia is less=20

lenient with its former satellites. Two years ago, Ukraine had to supply Ru=
ssia with sophisticated=20

chnology. This was in=20

partial payment for its overdue $1.4 billion natural gas bill. Admittedly, =
Ukraine is also rumored to=20

have "diverted" gas from the Russian pipeline which runs through it.  The R=

major transit pipelines and giant underground storage tanks to Russian safe=
 hands. Various joint=20

ownership schemes were floated - the latest one, in 1999, was for a pipelin=

Turkey to be built at Ukrainian expense but co-owned by Gazprom.  After an =
initial period of=20

acquiescence, Ukraine recoiled, citing concerns that the Russian stratagem =
may compromise its=20

putative sovereignty. Already UES, Russia's heavily politicized electricity=
 utility, has begun=20

pursuing stakes in debtor Ukrainian power producers.  Surprisingly, Russia =
is much less=20

period of 15 years (including two years grace) with the sole - and dubious =
- collateral of the=20
