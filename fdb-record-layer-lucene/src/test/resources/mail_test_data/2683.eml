And that's mostly what life is: making little pots of cocoa to keep our bodies warm in the midst of a 

never-ending chilliness!     _Tuesday the Eighth_   My husband is home again. He came back with 

the first blizzard of the winter and had a hard time getting through to Casa Grande. This gives him 

all the excuses he could desire for railing at prairie life. I told him, after patiently listening to him 

cussing about everything in sight, that it was plain to see that he belonged to the land of the 

beaver. He promptly requested to know what I meant by that.  "Doesn't the beaver regard it as 

necessary to dam his home before he considers it fit to live in?" I retorted. But Duncan, in that 

estranging new mood of his, didn't relax a line. He even announced, a little later on, that a quick-

silver wit might be all right if it could be kept from running over. And it was my turn to ask if he had 

any particular reference to allusions.  "Well, for one thing," he told me, "there's this tiresome habit 

of hitching nicknames on to everything in sight."  I asked him what names he objected to.  "To 

begin right at home," he retorted, "I regard 'Dinkie' as an especially silly name for a big hulk of a 

boy. I think it's about time that youngster was called by his proper name."  I'd never thought about 

it, to tell the truth. His real name, I remembered, was Elmer Duncan McKail. That endearing 

diminutive of "Dinkie" had stuck to him from his baby days, and in my fond and foolish eyes, of 

course, had always seemed to fit him. But even Gershom had spoken to me on the matter, months 

before, asking me if I preferred the boy to be known as "Dinkie" to his school mates. And I'd told 

Gershom that I didn't believe we could get rid of the "Dinkie" if we wanted to. His father, I knew, 

had once objected to "Duncan," as he had no liking to be dubbed "Old Duncan" while his offspring 

would answer to "Young Duncan." And "Duncan," as a name, had never greatly appealed to me. 

But it is plain now that I have been remiss in the matter. So hereafter we'll have to make an effort 

to have our little Dinkie known as Elmer. It's like bringing a new child into the family circle, a new 

child we're not quite acquainted with. But these things, I suppose, have to be faced. So hereafter 

my laddie shall officially be known as "Elmer," Elmer Duncan McKail. And I have started the ball 

rolling by duly inscribing in his new books "Elmer D. McKail" and requesting Gershom to address 

his pupil as "Elmer."  I've been wondering, in the meantime, if Duncan is going to insist on a 

revision of all our ranch names, the names so tangled up with love and good-natured laughter and 

memories of the past. Take our horses alone: Tumble-weed and timeless Tithonus, Buntie and 

Briquette, Laughing-gas and Coco the Third, Mudski and Tarzanette. I'd hate now to lose those 

names. They are the register of our friendly love for our animals.  It begins to creep through this 

thick head of mine that my husband no longer nurses any real love for either these animals or 

prairie life. And if that is the case, he will never get anything out of prairie living. It will be useless 

for him even to try. So I may as well do what I can to reconcile myself to the inevitable. I am not 

without my moments of revolt. But in those moods when I feel a bit uppish I remember about my 

recent venture into astronomy. What's the use of worrying, anyway? There was one ice age, and 

there is going to be another ice age. I tell myself that my troubles are pretty trivial, after all, since 

I'm only one of many millions on this earth and since this earth is only one of many millions of 

other earths which will swing about their suns billions and billions of years after I and my children 

and my children's children are withered into dust.  It rather takes my breath away, at times, and I 

shy away from it the same as Pauline Augusta shies away from the sight of blood. It reminds me 

of Chaddie's New York lady with whom the Bishop ventured to discuss ultimate destinies. "Yes, I 

suppose I shall enter into eternal bliss," responded this fair lady, "but would you mind not 



discussing such disagreeable subjects at tea-time?"  he made himself "expert" by a six weeks' 

course of study. They mix trades a little in the West. We expected on turning the page to find that 

Mr. Lincoln had also taken up surgery and performed the Caesarean operation. The few law books 

needed for Western practice were supplied to him by a kind friend at Springfield, and according to 

a witness who has evidently an accurate memory for details, "he went to read law in 1832 or 1833 

barefooted, seated in the shade of a tree and would grind around with the shade, just opposite 

Berry's grocery store, a few feet south of the door, occasionally lying flat on his back and putting 

his feet up the tree." Evidently, whatever he read, especially of a practical kind, he made 

thoroughly his own. It is needless to say that he did not become a master of scientific 

jurisprudence, but it seems that he did become an effective Western advocate. What is more, 

there is conclusive testimony to the fact that he was--what has been scandalously alleged to be 

rare, even in the United States--an honest lawyer. "Love of justice and fair play," says one of his 

brothers of the bar, "was his predominant trait. I have often listened to him when I thought he 

would state his case out of Court. It was not in his nature to assume or attempt to bolster up a 

false position. He would abandon his case first. He did so in the case of _Buckmaster for the use 

of Durham v. Beener & Arthur_, in our Supreme Court, in which I happened to be opposed to him. 

Another gentleman, less fastidious, took Mr. Lincoln's place and gained the case." His power as 

an advocate seems to have depended on his conviction that the right was on his side. "Tell Harris 

it's no use to _waste money on me_; in that case, he'll get beat." In a larceny case he took those 

who were counsel with him for the defence aside and said, "If you can say anything for the man do 

it. I can't. If I attempt it, the jury will see that I think he is guilty and convict him of course." In 

another case he proved an account for his client, who, though he did not know it, was a rogue. 

The counsel on the other side proved a receipt. By the time he had done Lincoln was missing; and 

on the Court sending for him, he replied, "Tell the judge I can't come; my hands are dirty, and I 

came over to clean them." Mr. Herndon, who visited Lincoln's office on business, gives the 

following reminiscence: --"Mr. Lincoln was seated at his table, listening very attentively to a man 

who was talking earnestly in a low tone. After the would-be client had stated the facts of the case, 

Mr. Lincoln replied, 'yes, there is no reasonable doubt but that I can gain your case for you. I can 

set a whole neighbourhood at logger heads; I can distress a widowed mother and her six 

fatherless children, and thereby get for you six hundred dollars, which rightly belongs, it appears to 

me, as much to the woman and her children as it does to you. You must remember that some 

things that are legally right are not morally right. I shall not take your case but will give you a bit of 

advice, for which I will charge you nothing. You seem to be a sprightly, energetic man. I would 

advise you to try your hand at making six hundred dollars in some other way.'" On one occasion, 

however, Lincoln, we believe it must be admitted, resorted to sharp practice. William Armstrong, 

the son of Jack Armstrong, of Clary's Grove, inheriting, as it seems, the "abundant animal spirits" 

of his father, committed, as was universally believed, a very brutal murder at a camp meeting, and 

being brought to trial was in imminent peril of the halter. Lincoln volunteered to defend him. The 

witness whose testimony bore hardest on the prisoner swore that he saw the murder committed by 

the light of the moon. Lincoln put in an almanac, which, on reference being made to it showed that 

at the time stated by the witness there was no moon. This broke down the witness and the 

prisoner was acquitted. It was not observed at the moment that the almanac was one of the year 



previous to the murder; and therefore morally a fabrication. Herculean efforts are made to prove 

that _two_ almanacs were produced and that Mr. Lincoln was innocent 


_
trouble-maker here at Casa Grande. It's in the form of a brindle pup called Minty, which Dinkie--I 

mean, of course, which Elmer, acquired in exchange for a jack-knife and what was left of his 

_Swiss Family Robinson_. But Minty has not been well treated by the world, and was brought 

home with a broken leg. So Whinnie and I made splints out of an old cigar-box cover, and padded 

the fracture with cotton wool and bound it up with tape. Minty, in the moderated spirits of 

invalidism, was a meek and well behaved pup during the first few days after his arrival, sleeping 

quietly at the foot of Elmer's bed and stumping around after his new master like a war veteran 

awaiting his discharge. But now that Minty's leg is getting better and he finds himself in a world 

that flows with warm milk and much petting, he betrays a tendency to use any odd article of 

wearing apparel as a teething-ring. He has completely ruined one of my bedroom slippers and 

done Mexican-drawn-work on the ends of the two living-room window-curtains. But what is much 

more ominous, Minty yesterday got hold of Dinky-Dunk's Stetson and made one side of its rim 

look as though it had been put through a meat-chopper. So my lord and master has been making 

inquiries about Minty and Minty's right of possession. And the order has gone forth that hereafter 

no canines are to sleep in this house. It impresses me as a trifle unreasonable, all things 

considered, and Elmer, with a rather unsteady underlip, has asked me if Minty must be taken 

away from him. But I have no intention of countermanding Duncan's order. The conceive, is, that 

Mr. Lincoln had rocked William Armstrong in the cradle.  There is one part of Lincoln's early life 

which, though scandal may batten on it, we shall pass over lightly, we mean that part which relates 

to his love affairs and his marriage. Criticism, and even biography, should respect as far as 

possible the sanctuary of affection. That a man has dedicated his life to the service of the public is 

no reason why the public should be licensed to amuse itself by playing with his heart-strings. Not 

only as a storekeeper, but in every capacity, Mr. Lincoln was far more happy in his relations with 

men than with women. He however loved, and loved deeply, Ann Rutledge, who appears to have 

been entirely worthy of his attachment, and whose death at the moment when she would have felt 

herself at liberty to marry him threw him into a transport of grief, which threatened his reason and 

excited the gravest apprehensions of his friends. In stormy weather especially he would rave 

piteously, crying that "he could never be reconciled to have the snow, rains and storms to beat 

upon her grave." This first love he seems never to have forgotten. He next had an affair, not so 

creditable to him, with a Miss Owens, of whom, after their rupture, he wrote things which he had 

better have left unwritten. Finally, he made a match of which the world has heard more than 

enough, though the Western Boy was too true a gentleman to let it hear anything about the matter 

from his lips. It is enough to say that this man was not wanting in that not inconsiderable element 

of worth, even of 


_
thin enough, as it is. And whatever happens, I am resolved to be a meek and dutiful wife. But I've 

had a talk with Whinnie and he's going to fix up a comfortable box behind the stove in the bunk-

house, and there the exiled Minty will soon learn to repose in peace. It's marvelous, though, how 

that little affection.  "If ever," said Abraham Lincoln, "American society and the United States 

Government are demoralized and overthrown, it will come from the voracious desire of office--this 

wriggle to live without toil, from which I am not free myself." These words ought to be written up in 

the largest characters 


_
Dinkie, loves my Elmer, I should say. He licks my laddie's shoes and yelps with joy at the smell of 

his pillow ... Poor little abundant-hearted mite, overflowing with love! But life, I suppose, will see to 

it that he is brought to reason. We must learn not to be too happy on this earth. And we must learn 

that love isn't always given all it asks for.     _Thursday the Seventeenth_   The confession with 

which they conclude is as true as the rest. Mr. Lincoln, we are told, took no part in the promotion of 

local enterprises, railroads, schools, churches, asylums. The benefits he proposed for his fellow 

men were to be accomplished by political means alone "Politics were his world--a world filled with 

hopeful enchantments. Ordinarily he disliked to discuss any other
