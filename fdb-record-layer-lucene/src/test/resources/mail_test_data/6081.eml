, or computer called=20

the songs of the King of Navarre."  The chronicler who tells us this assign=
s the incident to the year=20

1236, when Blanche would have been forty-eight years of age. The date is ob=
viously wrong, or=20

rather the story of many years has been crowded into one. Thibaud's love fo=
r Blanche must have=20

begun when she was young and really beautiful; one can hardly imagine a bur=
ning passion=20

conceived for a lady of middle age, the mother of twelve children. His devo=
tion, then, dates from=20

an earlier period; indeed, we find definite record of it in the calumnies c=
irculated by the barons=20

before 1230; and one chronicler tells us that, during the war of that year,=
 when the barons were=20

ravaging Champagne, Count Thibaud, dressed as a common stroller and accompa=
nied by one=20

companion as miserably attired as himself, went through the country to find=
 out what his people=20

were saying about him. Everywhere he heard but ill of himself. "Then said t=
he Count to his=20

_ribaud_ (vagabond companion), 'Friend, I see full well that a penn'orth of=
 bread would feed all my=20

friends. I have none, indeed, I verily believe, not a one whom I can trust,=
 save the Queen of=20

France.' She was indeed his loyal friend, and well did she show that she di=
d not hate him. By her=20

the war was brought to an end, and all the land (Champagne) reconquered. Ma=
ny tales do they tell=20

of them, as of Iseut and Tristan."  The love of Thibaud was not to be doubt=
ed, but it is a delicate=20

matter to determine how far his sentiments were reciprocated by Blanche. On=
 the one hand, the=20

party of the barons openly and violently accused her of adultery; on the ot=
her hand, we know that=20

no evil woman could have reared Saint Louis and have been beloved and rever=
ed by him. If=20

Blanche was a good and pure woman, as we firmly believe, we shall again hav=
e to disappoint the=20

lovers of romance, for there must be some explanation other than the purely=
 erotic for her conduct=20

toward Thibaud de Champagne. Alas for the romance! the common-sense explana=
tion is not far to=20

seek, and not difficult of acceptance when we remember the whole career of =
this remarkable=20

woman. Blanche de Castille was an astute politician; otherwise she would ne=
ver have been able to=20

maintain her position, with everything against her: the fact that she was a=
 woman, the fact that she=20

was a foreigner, alone comprise many difficulties. We do not know of a sing=
le instance in which=20

she allowed her feelings--love, hate, family affection, mere feminine weakn=
ess--to sway her or=20

interfere with the settled policy which she had determined upon for the goo=
d of her kingdom and of=20

her children. Indeed, as we shall see later, one serious defect in her char=
acter was her inflexibility=20

of purpose, her resolute suppression of the tenderer feelings. That she lik=
ed and perhaps admired=20

the brilliant poet-knight who proclaimed his devotion to her in "songs the =
sweetest ever heard," we=20

need not doubt; but she never responded to his ardent passion. Surrounded b=
y enemies domestic=20

and enemies foreign, she took advantage of the romantic devotion of a poet =
to win the very=20

effective support of one of the most powerful barons of France. Flattering =
Thibaud's vanity now=20



and then,--it was no small thing to be reputed the lover of a queen,--she a=
droitly kept him in leash.=20

As a sovereign, too, she was careful to retain his good will by services of=
 the utmost value, nay, of=20

imperative necessity.  The truce with England was to expire on July 22, 122=
9. Just at this time,=20

when it might be supposed that the queen's energies would be required in de=
fending or at least in=20

watching the western frontier, threatened by Pierre Mauclerc and his Englis=
h allies, the Duke of=20

Burgundy and the Count of Nevers prepared to invade Thibaud's country. Marc=
hing into=20

Champagne, they devastated the country and reduced Thibaud to a very precar=
ious condition.=20

The pretext of this war was, first, that Thibaud was a traitor and the assa=
ssin of Louis VIII.;=20

secondly, that he was a bastard, and that the real ruler of Champagne was A=
lix, Queen of Cyprus,=20

granddaughter of Thibaud's uncle, Henry II. of Champagne. The claims were b=
oth, of course,=20

preposterous, merely trumped up to hide the real motive of the attack, whic=
h was aimed at=20

Blanche de Castille and through her at the power of the crown. Alix de Cham=
pagne, as the barons=20

called her, was herself of illegitimate descent, a fact recognized by the C=
hurch itself.  Like a faithful=20

sovereign, Blanche hastened to the defence of her vassal. Ordering Ferrand =
de Flandre to create=20

a diversion by an attack upon the county of Boulogne, she summoned her vass=
als and=20

commanded them to desist from their attack upon Thibaud. They refused to ob=
ey; she forthwith=20

put herself at the head of her army and marched to Troyes. The barons were =
compelled to accede=20

to a truce.  During this truce Thibaud managed to secure several allies, an=
d the civil war broke out=20

again, even before the nominal expiration of the truce. Villages and towns =
were burned=20

hostilities against Thibaud de Champagne.  Pierre Mauclerc, now insolently =
styling himself Duke--

not Count--of Brittany, and adding an English title, Count of Richmond, had=
 written to Louis IX.=20

announcing the withdrawal of his homage. He was to be henceforth a vassal o=
f the crown of=20

England. Henry III. was preparing in earnest for a descent upon France; and=
 Blanche sought=20

allies, or at least friends, among her vassals, while the barons leagued ag=
ainst Thibaud agreed to=20

a truce. Collecting what forces she could, the queen, accompanied by Louis,=
 marched toward=20

Angers against Pierre. Meanwhile, with much pomp and ceremony and rich clot=
hing and luxurious=20

baggage, Henry III. landed at Saint-Malo, on May 3, 1230, where he had an i=
nterview with Pierre.=20

Henry was full of splendid plans; fortunately for Blanche, he was incapable=
 of putting them into=20

execution. The time was frittered away in petty encounters, and in debauche=
ry on Henry's part,=20

while Blanche continued to negotiate with any who seemed disposed to favor =
her cause. She won=20

in this way the support of some Breton and Poitevin nobles, and held togeth=
er her uncertain feudal=20

army. As soon as the legal forty days of their service were done, the more =
discontented of the=20

vassals in her army withdrew, and the king had to follow them in order to p=
revent their renewing=20

their attacks upon Champagne. Instead of profiting by the embarrassment of =
his enemies and=20

overwhelming the French, Henry marched to and fro in Brittany, through Poit=
ou and to Bordeaux,=20

returning thence to Brittany. His army was exhausted without fighting; ther=
e was much sickness=20

among men and animals; his provisions were giving out. Tired of the fruitle=
ss expedition, he sailed=20

back to England, abandoning to the chances of war the Breton nobles who had=
 deserted France=20

under promise of protection from England. Before the joyful news of his dep=
arture could reach her,=20



however, Blanche was again in=20

tion stronger than=20

before had been formed against Thibaud. He had put forth his entire resourc=
es in his preparations=20

for defence; but in a pitched battle under the walls of Provins his forces =
were defeated and routed,=20

and the count himself fled to Paris with the pursuing victors at his heels.=
 All seemed lost, and his=20

enemies were marching about as they pleased over Champagne, when Queen Blan=
che arrived=20

with her army, which was large enough, fortunately, to intimidate the rebel=
s. She would not talk of=20

terms with armed rebels, but demanded the evacuation of Champagne. After so=
me little parleying,=20

in which the queen held firm, the rebellious barons submitted. Reparation w=
as agreed to on both=20

e while he was making=20

war, in defiance of his sovereign, upon the Count of Champagne. Truly, medi=
aeval dispensations=20

are sometimes amazing.  By the end of 1230 the barons were at peace, and Bl=
anche was at=20

liberty to turn her attention to Brittany and Pierre Mauclerc. Louis and hi=
