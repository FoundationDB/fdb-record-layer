philodendron monstera cast-iron implements. The term "wooden plow" has a si=
milar history. For well over 2000 years in Europe some plows have been made=
 with iron shares and the rest of the structure wood. Plows in 18th-century=
 America were made principally of wood with iron shares, colters, and clevi=
ses, and with strips of iron frequently covering the wooden moldboard. Thes=
e implements were called, simply, plows of various regional prey. The belly=

that the material was medium high carbon steel. This test was corroborated =
by a chemical analysis=20

of filings from the moldboard and share in a metallurgical laboratory. A sm=
all trace of carbon was=20

found in the moldboard. It may be present as the result of contamination fr=
om several sources, a=20

likely one being the charcoal fire in the forge when it was heated for bend=
ing and shaping.[20]=20

These tests agree perfectly with the description in the 1843 advertisement.=
 It seems, therefore,=20

that Deere's success in making plows that worked well in prairie bottom lan=
ds depended as much=20

on the smooth surface he produced by grinding and polishing as on the mater=
ial used.  The filing=20

of the edge of the moldboard for the metallurgical test disclosed that the =
wrought-iron slab=20

consisted of five thin laminations apparently forged together but with sepa=
rations visible. The=20

length and regularity of the lines of separation seem to preclude their bei=
ng striations resulting=20

from the fibrous structure of wrought iron. This calls into question the th=
eory that the moldboard=20

and landside were cut from a mill saw, since it hardly seems likely that a =
saw would be made of=20

laminated material. The possibility exists that the body of the mill saw mi=
ght have been made this=20

way, with a tooth-bearing steel edge welded on, but there seems little reas=
on for making a saw out=20

of thin laminations. It is also possible that this laminated iron originall=
y had been intended for some=20

other purpose, such as boiler plate, and may have been available in rectang=
ular pieces. In making=20

the 1838 plow Deere followed a pattern (fig. 4), which suggests that he cut=
 it out of such a piece.=20

s of construction=20

and relationship of landside to moldboard. (_Cat. no. F1111_; _Smithsonian =
photo 42639_.)]=20

Since the moldboard of the 1838 plow is of wrought iron, and since this plo=
w is thought to be=20

essentially identical with the first one Deere made in 1837, it is highly p=
robable that the 1837 plow=20

also had a wrought-iron moldboard, a condition which appears to have been t=

d never seen any=20

that resembled them. Monkeys, especially those living in troops, make long =
emigrations at certain=20

periods, and consequently it happens that at the beginning of the rainy sea=
sons the natives=20

discover round their huts different kinds which they have not before observ=
ed. On this same bank=20

our guides showed us a nest of young iguanas only four inches long. It was =
difficult to distinguish=20

them from common lizards. There was no distinguishing mark yet formed but t=
he dewlap below the=20

throat. The dorsal spines, the large erect scales, all those appendages tha=
t render the iguana so=20

remarkable when it attains its full growth, were scarcely traceable.  The f=
lesh of this animal of the=20

saurian family appeared to us to have an agreeable taste in every country w=
here the climate is=20

very dry; we even found it so at periods when we were not in want of other =
food. It is extremely=20

white, and next to the flesh of the armadillo, one of the best kinds of foo=
d to be found in the huts of=20

the natives.  It rained toward evening, and before the rain fell, swallows,=
 exactly resembling our=20

own, skimmed over the surface of the water. We saw also a flock of paroquet=
s pursued by little=20

goshawks without crests. The piercing cries of these paroquets contrasted s=
ingularly with the=20

whistling of the birds of prey. We passed the night in the open air, upon t=
he beach, near the island=20

of Carizales. There were several Indian huts in the neighbourhood, surround=
ed with plantations.=20

Our pilot assured us beforehand that we should not hear the cries of the ja=
guar, which, when not=20

extremely pressed by hunger, withdraws from places where he does not reign =
unmolested. "Men=20

put him out of humour" (los hombres lo enfadan), say the people in the Miss=
ions. A pleasant and=20



simple expression, that marks a well-observed fact.  Since our departure fr=
om San Fernando we=20

had not met a single boat on this fine river. Everything denoted the most p=
rofound solitude. On the=20

morning of the 3rd of April our Indians caught with a hook the fish known i=
n the country by the=20

name of caribe,* (* Caribe in the Spanish language signifies cannibal.) or =

_
legend of the John Deere steel plow to be explained? There are several like=
ly reasons. It is=20

possible that the first plow, in 1837, was made from a broken steel mill sa=
w. It is also possible that=20

within a few years puddled iron came to be used for the moldboards because =
of the scarcity of=20

suitable steel, either in the form of broken mill saws or as plates ordered=
 from foundries in America=20

(the high price of steel imported from England made this an impractical sou=
rce). However, it=20

seems more likely that it became known as a steel plow owing to the importa=
nce Deere attached=20

to his plows having steel shares, as shown in his advertisement in 1843. A =
steel share, tougher=20

than cast iron, would hold an edge much better than wrought iron, and John =
Muir's description of=20

prairie plowing, quoted earlier, substantiates the importance of a tough, s=
harp share.  Deere's=20

plows, probably distinctive by reason of their steel shares, may have been =
called "steel" plows, in=20

the regions where they were used, to distinguish them from the standard suc=
h a thirst for blood. It=20

attacks bathers and swimmers, from whom it often bites away considerable pi=
eces of flesh. The=20

Indians dread extremely these caribes; and several of them showed us the sc=
ars of deep wounds=20

in the calf of the leg and in the thigh, made by these little animals. They=
 swim at the bottom of=20

rivers; but if a few drops of blood be shed on the water, they rise by thou=
sands to the surface, so=20

that if a person be only slightly bitten, it is difficult for him to get ou=
t of the water without receiving a=20

severer wound. When we reflect on the numbers of these fish, the largest an=
d most voracious of=20

which are only four or five inches long, on the triangular form of their sh=
arp and cutting teeth, and=20

on the amplitude of their retractile mouths, we need not be surprised at th=
e fear which the caribe=20

excites in the inhabitants of the banks of the Apure and the Orinoco. In pl=
aces where the river was=20

very limpid, where not a fish appeared, we threw into the water little mors=
els of raw flesh, and in a=20

few minutes a=20
