philodendron monstera waiting endurable.  It's the women, and the women alo=
ne, who seem left out of the procession. They impress me as having no big i=
nterests of their own, so they are compelled to _playtend_ with make-believ=
e interests. They race like mad in the social squirrel-cage, or discriminat=
ion of shades of character. The difference between the two minds in degree =
is, of course, immense; but both belong to the same rare kind. Both are rea=
lly creative; both purely artistic; both have the marvellous power of endow=
ing the products of their philodendron monstera waiting endurable.  It's th=
e women, and the women alone, who seem left out of the procession. They imp=
ress me as having no big interests of their own, so they are compelled to _=
playtend_ with make-believe interests. They race like mad in the social squ=
irrel-cage, or discrimination of shades of character. The difference betwee=
n the two minds in degree is, of course, immense; but both belong to the sa=
me rare kind. Both are really creative; both purely artistic; both have the=
 marvellous power of endowing the products of their _
school. "One of the finest school-buildings in all the West," Duncan has pr=
oudly explained. I can't=20

help thinking of Gershom and his little cubby-hole of a wooden building whe=
re he is even now so=20

solemnly and yet so kind-heartedly teaching the three R's to a gathering of=
 little prairie outlaws.  I=20

shall have time on my hands, I see, for Hilton and his wife, our English ga=
rdener-chauffeur and our=20

portly maid-of-all-work, pretty well cover what the wonderful Tokudo overlo=
oks. And Tokudo _is_ a=20

wonder. That cat-footed little Jap does the ordering and cooking and servin=
g; he answers the door=20

and the telephone; he attends to the rugs and the hardwood floors; he rules=
 over the butler's=20

pantry and polishes the silver and inspects the linen, and even keeps the k=
eys to Duncan's=20

carefully guarded wine-cellar, which the mistress of the house herself has =
not yet dared to invade.=20

My husband seems to be very busy with his coal-mines and his other interest=
s. He said last night=20

that his idea of happiness is to be so immersed in his work as to be uncons=
cious of time and=20

undisturbed by its passing. And he _has_ been happy, in that way. But Time,=
 that patient=20

remodeler of all things mortal, can still work while we sleep. And somethin=
g has been happening,=20

without Duncan quite knowing it. He has changed. He is older, for one thing=
. I don't mean that my=20

husband is an old man. But I can see a number of early-autumnal alterations=
 in him. He's a trifle=20

under her sway. Still in each case there was the commonwealth, standing in =
glorious contrast to=20

the barbarous despotisms of other nations, the highest social and political=
 state which humanity=20

had known or for ages afterwards was to know. And this light of civilizatio=
n was, so far as the last=20

republicans could see, not only to be eclipsed for a time or put out, as no=
w in a single nation, while=20

it burns on in others, but to be swallowed up in hopeless night.  Mr. Charl=
es Norton in the notes to=20

his recent translation of the "Vita Nuova" of Dante quotes a decree made by=
 the commonwealth of=20

Florence for the building of the cathedral.  "Whereas it is the highest int=
erest of a people of=20

illustrious origin so to proceed in their affairs that men may perceive fro=
m their external works that=20

their doings are at once wise and magnanimous, it is therefore ordered that=
 Arnulf, architect of our=20

commune, prepare the model or design for the rebuilding of Santa Reparata w=
ith such supreme=20

and lavish magnificence, that neither the industry nor the capacity of man =
shall be able to devise=20

anything more grand or more beautiful, inasmuch as the most judicious in th=
is city have=20

pronounced the opinion, in public and private conferences, that no work of =
the commune should=20

be undertaken unless the design be such as to make it correspond with a hea=
rt which is of the=20

greatest nature because composed of the spirit of many citizens united toge=
ther in one=20


_
springiness. And he seems to know it, in his secret heart of hearts, for he=
 tries to make up for that=20

loss with a sort of coerced blitheness which doesn't always carry. He affec=
ts a sort of creaking=20

jauntiness which sometimes falls short of its aim. When he can't clear the =
hurdle, I notice, he has=20

the habit of whipping up his tired spirits with a cocktail or a highball or=
 a silver-fizz. But he is=20

preoccupied, at times. And at other times he is disturbingly short-tempered=
. He announced this=20

morning, almost gruffly, that we'd had about enough of this "Dinkie and Pop=
psy business," and the=20

children might as well be called by their real names. So I shall make anoth=
er effort to get back to=20

"Elmer" and "Pauline Augusta." But I feel, in my bones, that those pompous =
appellatives will not=20

be always remembered. It has just occurred to me that my old habit of calli=
ng my husband "Dinky-

Dunk" has slipped away from me. Endearing diminutives, I suppose, are not e=
licited by polar=20

bears.     _Thursday the Thirty-First_   I don't quite know what's the matt=
er with me. I'm like a cat in=20

a strange garret. I don't seem to be fitting in. I sat at the piano last ni=
ght playing "What's this dull=20

town to me, Robin Adair?" And Duncan, with the fit and natural spirit of th=
e home-booster, actively=20

resented that oblique disparagement of his new business-center. He believes=
 implicitly in Calgary=20

and its future.  As for myself, I am rigidly suspending all judgments. I'm =
at least trying to play my=20

part, even though my spirit isn't in it. There are times when I'm tempted t=
o feel that a foot-hill city of=20

this size is neither fish nor fowl. It impresses me as a frontier later and=
 very valuable work on=20

_Church Building in the Middle Ages_, Mr. Norton casts doubt on the authent=
icity of the decree. It=20

is genuine at all events, as an expression of Florentine sentiment, if not =
as an extract from the=20

archives.]  Let Imperialism, legitimist or democratic, match that! Florence=
, too, had her political=20

vices, many and grave, she tyrannized over Pisa and other dependants, there=
 was faction in her=20

councils, anarchy, bloody anarchy, in her streets, for her, too, the hour o=
f doom arrived, and the=20

conspiracy of the Pazzi was as much an anachronism as that of the republica=
ns who slew Caesar.=20

But Florence had that heart composed of the united spirits of many citizens=
 out of which came all=20

that the world admires and loves in the works of the Florentine. She produc=
ed, though she exiled=20

Dante. That which followed was more tranquil, more orderly perhaps, materia=
lly speaking, not less=20

happy, but it had no heart at all.     AUSTEN-LEIGH'S MEMOIR OF JANE AUSTEN=
  [Footnote: "A=20

Memoir of Jane Austen. By her nephew, J. E. Austen-Leigh, Vicar of Bray, Be=
rks." London:=20

Richard Bentley; New York: Scribner, Welford & Co.]   The walls of our citi=
es were placarded, the=20

other day, with an advertisement of a new sensational novel, the flaring wo=
odcut of which=20

represented a girl tied down upon a table, and a villain preparing to cut o=
ff her feet. If this were the=20

general taste, there would be no use in talking about Jane Austen. But if y=
ou ask at the libraries=20

you will find that her works are still taken out; so that there must still =
be a faithful few who, like=20

ourselves, will have welcomed the announcement of a Memoir of the authoress=
 of=20


_
out of its knickers and still ungainly in its first long trousers. But I ca=
n't help being struck by=20

people's incorruptible pride in their own community. It's a sort of religio=
us faith, a fixed belief in the=20

future, a stubborn optimism that is surely something more than self-interes=
t. It's the Dutch courage=20

and "Emma."  If Jane Austen's train of admirers has not been so large as th=
ose of many other=20

novelists, it has been first-rate in quality. She has been praised--we shou=
ld rather say, loved by all,=20

from Walter Scott to Guizot, whose love was the truest fame. Her name has o=
ften been coupled=20

with that of=20
