cribed so well the naked woman and the black velvet, set this story also be=
fore his fixed upon one city, Orleans. To the shattered French party it was=
 the last hope of their dauphin; to the English it was the barrier which sh=
ut them off from the south _
whatever else does. He differs as widely as possible from Edmund Spenser in=
 most things, but in=20

this one matter they are alike. Milton was too close to the Greeks to go wr=
ong, even with his moral=20

impulse to assert the honor of the body; his impassioned praise of wedded l=
ove, and his remarks=20

on the glory of nakedness when Adam and Eve first appear in his epic, put n=
o strain on literary=20

decorum. But Spenser=E2=80=99s moral enthusiasm for beauty leads to such ph=
ysical inventories as his=20

picture of Belph=C5=93be, in the second book of the _Faerie Queene_, or of =
his own bride, in the=20

_Amoretti_ and the _Epithalamium_=E2=80=94an accounting of eyes, teeth, hai=
r, neck, shoulders, breasts,=20

waist, arms and legs. Many a critic has suggested that his poems have the c=
haracter of painting or=20

of tapestry, and had he actually worked in a pictorial medium, he would hav=
e made the effect he=20

desired. In his portrait of Serena naked among the savages, in the sixth bo=
ok of the _Faerie=20

Queene_, he followed Homer=E2=80=99s method with admirable success. No Engl=
ish poet is more spiritual=20

than he=E2=80=94all the more impressive the indecorum to which his moral ea=
rnestness occasionally=20

brought him, and all the more helpful his example ought to be to modern bea=
uty-lovers who fancy=20

that the decorum of an art need not be studied and obeyed.  Through ignoran=
ce of decorum in=20

language a moralist sometimes comes to grief in the opposite direction; wis=
hing to indicate=20

indecency, he sometimes through reticence stumbles upon the Homeric method =
and portrays=20

beauty instead. A while ago a minister of some name, an aggressive defender=
 of decency,=20

preached a sermon on the dangers which at the moment he saw threatening us =
from the arts.=20

According to the newspapers, he said that if certain theatrical managers co=
uld get it by the police,=20

we should have a show in which a naked woman in one scene posed before a bl=
ack velvet curtain.=20

Wishing to touch the sulphurous subject as gingerly as possible, he merely =
suggested the lovely=20

contrast of body and background; those of his congregation who had seen it =
forgot their moral=20

danger and remembered the Venus de Milo in the Louvre. It occurred to some =
of them that this=20

material might be indecorous in the pulpit; in the theatre, however=E2=80=
=94well, they were not unwilling to=20

see it, if it was actually put on.   III  The principle of literary decorum=
 which applies to the=20

representation of the body applies also to the allied theme of sex. The bod=
y is a fit subject for=20

literature, but not in detail. Sex is a proper subject for literature, so l=
ong as it is represented as a=20

general force in life, and particular instances of it are decent so long as=
 they illustrate that general=20

force and turn our minds to it; but sexual actions are indecent when they c=
ease to illustrate the=20

general fact of sex, and are studied for their own sake; like the ears in t=
he portrait, they then=20

assume an emphasis they do not deserve. This seems to be the decorum of the=
 theme as great=20

writers have treated it, and this is the decorum which men instinctively ad=
opt in discussion, if they=20

have not been trained to think that all discussion of sex is naughty. Peopl=
e so trained will call any=20

book indecent which in any way touches the theme. When _Trilby_ appeared ye=
ars ago, many of=20

us then youngsters were protected (in vain) from the lovely story because T=
rilby had been=20

somebody=E2=80=99s mistress before the romance began. So to an earlier gene=
ration _The Scarlet Letter_=20

had seemed dangerous because Hester Prynne=E2=80=99s child was illegitimate=
. But neither book had=20

physical passion for its theme, though the force of sex in life, for good o=
r evil, gave each story=20

most of its interest and its pathos. How indecent in the artistic sense, ho=
w indecorous, either book=20

might have been, we realize by supposing faith that meant so much to her. H=
er mother was half=20

inclined to believe in Jeanne, and was at least sympathetic; but her father=
 could see in these=20

visions but childish nonsense that would lead his daughter astray. For him =
there was no faith in=20



such things; can one blame him if he thought them but the silly moonings of=
 a child, and dealt with=20

that child sternly in the hope of saving her? He declared that he would dro=
wn Jeanne with his own=20

hands rather than see her ride off with men-at-arms into that France of whi=
ch he and she knew=20

nothing but that it was from end to end given over to war and pillage. Thin=
king that marriage might=20

dispel her illusions about saving France,--as indeed it would,--they persec=
uted her to marry a=20

young villager who had fallen desperately in love with her and claimed that=
 she had promised to=20

marry him. With a courage that must have surprised even herself, she went b=
efore the=20

ecclesiastical court of Toul and told her story so frankly that the judge d=
ismissed the desperate=20

lover. Not for her were the joys and sorrows of a wife and mother.  With al=
l her determination and=20

masculine contempt for those things that are terrors to most women, Jeanne =
loved her home. In=20

after years she was ever sighing for the quiet life of her father's cottage=
, where she might sit and=20

spin with her mother, or wander forth over the fields with her sister to te=
nd the sheep. What a=20

piteous struggle must there have been in her breast! On the one hand, an an=
gry father, whom she=20

loved, a mother whom she loved better, a safe home, and in it all that her =
simple heart desired; on=20

the other, the great and terrible world, the armies of rough men, the disso=
lute courtiers, the long=20

journeys over an unknown country, for one who had hardly stirred out of sig=
ht of Domremy church=20

tower. Love of home, so strong in the hearts of all women, so precious to t=
he peasant woman of=20

France above all others, must be renounced for love of country. There have =
been no better or=20

more determined patriots than women, as Caesar found when the women of Gaul=
 cheered their=20

husbands on to the contest with his legions; but these women were fighting =
at home, as it were=20

upon the threshold; they did not go forth to lead armies in offensive warfa=
re; theirs was the steady=20

courage of desperation, not the active courage which must sustain itself, k=
eep its own fires alive,=20

instead of relying upon the stimulus of impulse and a desperate crisis. All=
 the fears and=20

heartbreakings of the struggle in Jeanne's mind have been hidden from us, f=
or she speaks not of=20

them; having fought out this battle with herself and decided that France ne=
eds her more than does=20

her mother, she does not allow herself to turn back, and we get but a plain=
tive reminiscence here=20

and there, since she has locked up this grief in her heart.  The opportunit=
y to attempt the execution=20

of the commands imposed by her voices was long in coming; she had become a =
subject of=20

common talk in her village; everywhere she met discouraging incredulity, if=
 not ridicule. It was not=20

that there was lack of belief in marvels, for the land was filled with stor=
ies of portents and wonders=20

in which the people did not hesitate to believe. There was the holy peasant=
 whom the great=20

captain, Xaintrailles, brought before the court to display upon his hands a=
nd feet the very marks of=20

the cross, the stigmata, and who was said to sweat blood upon the day of th=
e Passion. There was=20

Catherine de la Rochelle, who saw visions of angels and who proclaimed hers=
elf commissioned to=20

discover treasures for the dauphin. In these and the like the people of Dom=
remy may have=20

believed; but not in their own little peasant girl; for had they not known =
her when she was but like=20

the rest, a simple shepherdess?  In one member of her=20


_
attention on Trilby=E2=80=99s early and sordid affairs, before she met her =
true love, or that Hawthorne had=20

given us in detail the experiences of Hester in Arthur Dimmesdale=E2=80=99s=
 arms. One has an uneasy=20

feeling that so the books might have been written today; the general fact o=
f sex for help. This was=20

her uncle, whose wife she was sent to nurse and whose spark of faith she ki=
ndled during this stay=20

till, what with her urging and that of his wife, the good man' went to Vauc=
ouleurs and carried=20

Jeanne's message to Baudricourt. Is it any wonder that the=20


_
would not operate as a colossal force in the story, but would be deduced in=
 an argument or=20

assumed as an hypothesis=E2=80=94modern specialists in sex are so uncertain=
 of its existence=E2=80=94and the=20

focus would have been on the animal behavior of human beings, which the hyp=
othesis of sex=20

would explain. This kind of book is indecent, though it is usually too psyc=
hological in manner to=20

disturb the censorious, and entirely too frequent in recent literature to s=
uppress.  We turn for relief=20

to the decorum of great literature. =E2=80=9CFrom the roof David saw a woma=
n washing herself, and the=20

woman was very beautiful smiled derisively at this foolish peasant who came=
 to him with a=20

message from a girl declaring that he must give her soldiers to accomplish =
that which the best=20

captains of France could not accomplish? He was not unduly harsh, merely co=
ntemptuous in his=20

rebuff: "Whip the girl well, and send her home to her father." There are so=
 many with "missions" in=20

this world, missions that are but vain imaginings, profiting naught; the mo=
re experience one has=20

had in the world the more one learns to distrust these missions; and beyond=
 a doubt the=20

chastisement suggested by the Sire de Baudricourt would,=20


_
look upon.=E2=80=9D The painter might give the details of that beauty; the =
writer could not. But he could=20

continue: =E2=80=9CAnd David sent and inquired after the woman. And one sai=
d, Is not this Bathsheba, the=20

daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? And David sent messengers=
 and took her, and she=20

came in unto him, and he lay with her; and she returned unto her house. And=
 the woman=20

conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. And David se=
nt to Joab, saying,=20

Send me Uriah the Hittite.=E2=80=9D So begins one of the greatest of missio=
n and cured the hysterical=20

enthusiast.  We say nine cases out of ten, or ninety-nine out of a hundred,=
 or any further multiples=20

you please, with careless assurance that there is no tenth case, and that f=
ate will not take our=20

wager and prove us fools, no matter what the odds we offer. But there is th=
at tenth case, and the=20

world is caught, the wise world, as here in the case of the peasant lass of=
 Lorraine, at whom all in=20

Domremy smiled indulgently, whom all in France were soon to worship.  It wa=
