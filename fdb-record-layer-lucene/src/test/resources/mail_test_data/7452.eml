wings, now touch=20

he Marabou) has=20

arrived, and he stalks proudly towards the crowds, pecking his way with his=
 long bill through the=20

struggling vultures, and swallowing the lion's share of the repast. Abou Se=
en, last but not least,=20

had arrived from the highest region, while others had the advantage of the =
start. This bird is very=20

numerous through the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia, and may generally be se=
en perched upon the=20

rocks of the water-side, watching for small fish, or any reptile that may c=
hance to come within his=20

reach. The well-known feathers are situated in a plume beneath the tail.  O=
n 14th April we left our=20

camp in the afternoon, and, after marching nine miles, during which we pass=
ed two small streams,=20

flowing, like all others, from this point, west to the Atbara, we slept by =
a large pool in a third stream=20

of considerable size. A waterfall flowed over a row of perpendicular basalt=
 columns that=20

surrounded a deep basin, resembling piles of ebony artificially arranged. O=
n the following morning=20

we started before sunrise, and rode over the usual pathless burnt prairies,=
 until we reached the=20

base of Nahoot Guddabi, the mountain for which we had been steering. Eight =
miles farther, we=20

arrived  "But I suppose they kept the old handle?" he asked.  "I do not thi=
nk so," answered the=20

priest. "It was only of common wood; I believe Mrs. Adamecz asked Veronica =
for it."  (It must have=20

been the second demon speaking through the priest: "The handle of the umbre=
lla is in Mrs.=20

Adamecz's possession.")  Sztolarik now became curious too.  "Who is Mrs. Ad=
amecz?" he asked.=20

"My old cook, who just now brought me the keys."  Mr. Sztolarik burst out l=
aughing, the walls of the=20

empty church re-echoing with the sound. When they were outside, and the pri=
est had gone in with=20

the keys, the old lawyer took the two rings out of the paper they were wrap=
ped in and pressed=20

them into Gyuri's palm, saying quaintly:  "According to your logic of half =
an hour ago, you must=20

now marry old Mrs. Adamecz, so go and ask for her hand at once."  Gyuri gav=
e no answer to this=20

cruel thrust, and went into the kitchen, where the widow was frying pancake=
s.  "I say, Mrs.=20

Adamecz, where have you put the old handle of the church umbrella?"  Widow =
Adamecz finished=20

frying her pancake, put it on a wooden platter with those she had already f=
ried, and then turned=20

round to see who was speaking to her.  "What have I done with the old handl=
e, my dear? Well,=20

you see, this is how it was. My little grandson, Matyko, got ill last year =
just at cabbage-cutting time-

-no, I believe it was earlier in the year ..."  "I don't care when it was, =
only go on."  Widow Adamecz=20

quietly poured some=20

sting-place, and fifty-one=20

miles from our camp on the Salaam river. From this point to the river Salaa=
m, the entire country=20

slopes perceptibly to the west--the drainage being carried to the Atbara by=
 numerous streams. The=20

country that we had now entered, was inhabited exclusively by frying-pan.  =
"Let me see, what was=20

I saying? Ah, yes, I was speaking of Matyko. Well, it was the result of the=
 staring."  (The peasants=20

think that if a child is much looked at and admired it pines away.)  Gyuri =
began impatiently to tap=20

with his foot on the floor.  "Will you tell me where it is?"  "It is there =
under the table."  "What, the=20

handle?"  "No, the=20

llage, and immediately=20

about us. They brought us a he-goat, together with milk and honey. The latt=

re was Matyko, sitting=20

on a basin turned upside down, a fat-faced, blue-eyed Slovak child, playing=
 with some dried=20

beans, its face still dirty from the pancakes it had eaten.  "Bother you, w=
oman! Are you deaf?"=20

burst out the lawyer. "I asked you about the handle of the umbrella, not ab=
