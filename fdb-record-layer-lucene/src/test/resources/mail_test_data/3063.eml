where _
a mile distant, an immense sycamore (Ficus sycamorus), whose green and wide=
-spreading=20

branches afforded a tempting shade. Not far from this spot, I found the bed=
 of a dry torrent that=20

flowed into the poisoned stream of Gallabat. I ordered my men to dig a deep=
 hole in the sand,=20

which fortunately discovered clear and good-flavoured water. We immediately=
 pitched tents close=20

to the sycamore. From this elevation, about a hundred and fifty feet above =
Gallabat, we had a=20

beautiful view of the amphitheatre of hills and mountains, while the crowde=
d town lay below, as in=20

the bottom of a basin. The Atbara was not far distant in the ravine between=
 the hill ranges, as it=20

had made a sharp angle at Toganai, and altered its direction to the north. =
 Our arrival had made=20

some stir in Gallabat, and many people had  Gyuri murmured some unintelligi=
ble answer, and=20

shook his head.  "But you will have to leave soon, for our part here is pla=
yed out."  "I tell you it is=20

impossible."  "Why?"  "Don't you see that Veronica is lost?"  "What does th=
at matter to you? The=20

umbrella handle is lost too."  Gyuri made an impatient gesture.  "What do I=
 care about the=20

umbrella?"  "So it is the girl you want? You told me a different tale befor=
e dinner."  Gyuri turned=20

round.  "I did not know then."  "And now you know?"  "Yes, now I know," he =
answered shortly.=20

"And may I ask," said Sztolarik, "when did Amor light this flaming fire? fo=
r you did not seem to take=20

much interest in the girl before her disappearance."  "And yet it is causin=
g me at the present=20

moment all the tortures of hell. Believe me, my dear guardian, the loss of =
my=20


_
hunting trophies. Among our visitors was an Abyssinian merchant, Jusef, who=
se acquaintance I=20

had formerly made at Cassala; he was an agreeable and well-informed man, wh=
o had been in=20

Paris and London and spoke French and English tolerably. I accompanied him =
for a stroll through=20

the market, and was introduced by him to a number of the principal Abyssini=
an merchants. The=20

principal trade of Gallabat, which is the market-place for all commerce bet=
ween Abyssinia and the=20

Egyptian provinces, is in cotton, coffee, bees'-wax, and hides. Coffee is b=
rought in large quantities=20

by the Abyssinian merchants, who buy cotton in exchange, for the manufactur=
e of clothes=20

according to their own fashion. I bought a quantity of excellent coffee at =
the rate of two dollars for=20

thirty-five pounds, equal to about two and three-quarters pence a pound. Sh=
eds were arranged in=20

lines; these were occupied by the coffee merchants with their stores, while=
 a great stock of cotton=20

in bales, to the me a trifle beside the loss of Veronica."  Sztolarik was i=
mpressed by the apparent=20

sincerity of Gyuri's sorrow.  "That's quite another thing," he said. "If th=
at is how you feel I will stay=20

here with you. Let us go and look for the girl ourselves, and find out what=
 she thinks on the=20

subject."  When they went out, they found great confusion reigning in the c=
ourtyard, but Mrs.=20

Adamecz was loudest in her lamentations.  "I knew this would be the end of =
it. A legend should=20

never be tampered with by a mortal's hand, or it will fall to pieces. Oh, o=
ur dear young lady! She=20

was God's bride, and they wanted to make her the bride of a mortal, so God =
has taken her to=20

Himself."  Sztolarik sprang toward her, and caught hold of her hand.  "What=
 is that you say? Have=20

you heard anything?"  "Gundros, the cowherd, has just told us that he saw o=
ur young lady this=20

morning running straight toward the Bjela Voda, across the meadows, and her=
 eyes were red, as=20

though she had been crying.=20


_
an open space. Not far from the mass of goods was a confusion of camels, as=
ses, and mules that=20

had formed the means of transport. I now met an Italian merchant, with whom=
 I subsequently=20

became intimately acquainted, Signor Angelo Bolognesi--he had arrived from =
Khartoum to=20

purchase coffee and bees'-wax. We were delighted to meet a civilized Europe=
an after so long an=20

absence. For some months we had had little intercourse with any human being=
s beyond the=20

hunters that had conclusion to be drawn from that."  A lot of women and chi=
ldren were gathered=20

round the kitchen door, and one of them had also seen Veronica earlier than=
 Gundros had.  "Did=20

she look sad?" asked Gyuri.  "She was crying."  "Oh dear!" exclaimed Gyuri =
despairingly.  "We will=20

look for her," Sztolarik assured him.  "Where?"  "Out in the meadows or in =
the village, for it is=20

certain she must be somewhere about, and we shall soon know where."  "That =
will not be so=20

easy," sighed=20
