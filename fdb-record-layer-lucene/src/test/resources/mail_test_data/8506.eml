act as carrier. Her name was Luigia, and she was very picturesque looking, and had the most 

beautiful dark eyes, though she always looked fearfully sad. Daddy is fond of sketching, and he 

painted a picture of her standing with her donkey under the vines. We guessed somehow that she 

had a history, and we asked Sareda, our cook, about her. Sareda knew everybody in the place. 

She was a dear old gossip. She got quite excited over Luigia's story. She said it had been the talk 

of Tarana at the time. Luigia used to be a lovely girl when she was young, and she was quite 

wealthy for a peasant, because she owned a little lemon grove on the hillside. She inherited it from 

her father, who was dead. Of course, because she was beautiful and a village heiress, she soon 

found a sweetheart, and became engaged to Francesco, a fisherman who lived down on the 

Marina. Everything was going on very happily, and the wedding was fixed, when suddenly it was 

found there was something wrong with Luigia's glorious eyes. She went to a doctor in Naples, and 

he told her that unless a certain operation were performed she would go blind. If she went to Paris, 

to a specialist whom he named, her sight might be saved. Poor Luigia sold her lemon grove in a 

hurry, to get the necessary money, and packed up and started for Paris immediately. She was 

away six months, and she came back penniless, but seeing as well as ever. She trudged all the 

way from Liparo to Tarana, along the coast road, because she could not afford to take the train. 

When she walked into her own village, the first thing she saw was a wedding party leaving the 

church. She stopped to watch, and as the procession passed her who should the gayly-dressed 

bridegroom prove to be but her own faithless sweetheart Francesco. She screamed and fainted, 

and some kindly neighbors took her in and cared for her. She got work afterwards in the village, 

but she did not find a husband, because her lemon grove was sold, and these peasants will not 

marry a wife without a dowry. No wonder she looked so sad. We were always frightfully sorry for 

her."  Sheila, who was the next entertainer, recited a ballad; and Delia also "spoke a piece," an 

amusing episode of child life, which she rendered with much humor. The next turn was Irene's, 

and the girls, who were in a mood for listening, clamored for a story.  "I haven't any first-hand or 

original adventures," she declared. "My aunts never have psychic experiences, and the people 

who brought us things to the door in London weren't interesting in the least. If you like romance, 

though, I remember a tale in a little old, old book that belonged to my great grandmother. It was 

supposed to be true, and I dare say it may have really happened, more than a hundred years ago, 

just as 'The Babes in the Wood' really happened in Norfolk in Elizabethan times. It's about a girl 

named Mary Howard. Her father and mother died when she was only four years old, and she was 

left an orphan. She was heiress to a very great property, and her uncle, Mr. John Howard, was 

made her guardian. She also had another uncle, Mr. Dallas, her mother's brother, but he lived in 

Calcutta and she had never seen him. Mr. John Howard wished to get hold of Mary's estates for 

himself, so he laid a careful plot. First, he sent all the servants away, including her nurse, Betty 

Morris, who was devoted to her. Betty offered to stay on without wages, but when this was refused 

she became suspicious, and wrote a letter to Mr. Dallas warning him to look after his sister's child. 

But it took many months in those days for a letter to get to Calcutta, and meantime Mr. Howard 

was pursuing a wicked scheme. Soon afterwards Betty heard that her charge had been stolen by 

gypsies for the sake of her amber beads, and could not be found anywhere. What had really 

happened was worse even than Betty had feared. Mr. Howard had hired a sailor, who was in 

desperate need of money, and bribed him to decoy the child away, take her to the seaside and 



there drown her. Robert, the sailor, fulfilled the first part of his bargain but not the second. He 

carried little Mary into a remote part of Wales, but he did not do her any harm. Instead, he became 

extremely fond of her and determined to save her from her uncle. So he bought a passage in a 

vessel bound for New Zealand and took her to sea with him, pretending she was his daughter. 

She was a sweet, gentle little creature, and soon became a favorite on board.  "Among the crew 

was a Maori boy named Duaterra, whose father was a great chief in New Zealand. The Captain, 

for some offense, ordered this boy to be flogged, and Duaterra could not forgive the indignity. He 

planned a terrible revenge. When they reached New Zealand he persuaded the Captain and crew 

to land in his father's territory; then, summoning his savage friends he ordered a general massacre 

and killed them all, saving only Robert and little Mary. Robert had been good to him and had given 

him tobacco, and Duaterra adored Mary, and called her his Mocking Bird. The Maoris plundered 

and burnt the ship after they had murdered the crew, but they were kind to Robert and Mary, and 

built a native house for them. Here they lived for four years, for they had no opportunity to escape. 

Robert married the chief's daughter and settled down as a member of the tribe, but he became 

very anxious about little Mary. He knew that Duaterra looked upon her as his prospective bride, 

and he could not bear to think of the lovely child ever becoming the wife of a savage.  "One day a 

marvelous opportunity occurred for sending Mary home. A ship put in to obtain fresh water, and on 

the vessel happened to be an old friend of Robert's, named John Morris, actually the brother of 

Betty Morris, Mary's former nurse. Robert told John the whole story and begged him to take the 

little girl to England, and deliver her into Betty's hands. He paid for her passage with the money 

which Mr. Howard had given him as a of the Orinoco because, belonging at once to two basins, its 

course marks, in some sort, even on the most imperfect maps, the direction of that part of the 

plains intervening between New Grenada and the western border of the mountains of La Parime. 

The Llanos or steppes of the Lower Orinoco and of the Meta, like the deserts of Africa, bear 

different names in different parts. From the mouths of the Dragon the Llanos of Cumana, of 

Barcelona, and of Caracas or Venezuela,* follow, running from east to west. (* The following are 

subdivisions of these three great Llanos, as I marked them down on the spot. The Llanos of 

Cumana and New Andalusia include those of Maturin and Terecen, of Amana, Guanipa, Jonoro, 

and Cari. The Llanos of Nueva Barcelona comprise those of Aragua, Pariaguan, and Villa del Pao. 

We distinguish in the Llanos of Caracas those of Chaguaramas, Uritucu, Calabozo or Guarico, La 

Portuguesa, San Carlos, and Araure.) Where the steppes turn towards the south and south-south-

west, from the latitude of 8 degrees, between the meridians of 70 and 73 degrees, we find from 

north to south, the Llanos of Varinas, Casanare, the Meta, Guaviare, Caguau, and Caqueta.* (* 

The inhabitants of these plains distinguish as subdivisions, from the Rio Portuguesa to Caqueta, 

the Llanos of Guanare, Bocono, Nutrius or the Apure, Palmerito near Quintero, Guardalito and 

Arauca, the Meta, Apiay near the port of Pachaquiaro, Vichada, Guaviare, Arriari, Inirida, the Rio 

Hacha, and Caguan. The limits between the savannahs and the forests, in the plains that extend 

from the sources of the Rio Negro to Putumayo, are not sufficiently known.) The plains of Varinas 

contain some few monuments of the industry of a nation that has disappeared. Between Mijagual 

and the Cano de la Hacha, we find some real tumuli, called in the country the Serillos de los 

Indios. They are hillocks in the shape of cones, artificially formed of earth, and probably contain 

bones, like the tumuli in the steppes of Asia. A fine road is also discovered near Hato de la 



Calzada, between Varinas and Canagua, five leagues long, made before the conquest, in the 

most remote times, by the natives. It is a causeway of earth fifteen feet high, crossing a plain often 

overflowed. Did nations farther advanced in civilization descend from the mountains of Truxillo and 

Merido to the plains of the Rio Apure? The Indians whom we now find between this river and the 

Meta, are in too rude a state to think of making roads or raising tumuli.  I calculated the area of 

these Llanos from the Caqueta to the Apure, and from the Apure to the Delta of the Orinoco, and 

found it to be seventeen thousand square leagues twenty to a degree. The part running from north 

to south is almost double that which stretches from east to west, between the Lower Orinoco and 

the littoral chain of Caracas. The Pampas on the north and north-west of Buenos Ayres, between 

this city and Cordova, Jujuy, and the Tucuman, are of nearly the same extent as the Llanos; but 

the Pampas stretch still farther on to the length of 18 degrees southward; and the land they 

occupy is so vast, that they produce palm-trees at one of their extremities, while the other, equally 

low and level, is covered with eternal frost.  The Llanos of America, where they extend in the 

direction of a parallel of the equator, are three-fourths narrower then the great desert of Africa. 

This circumstance is very important in a region where the winds constantly blow from east to west. 

The farther the plains stretch in this direction, the more ardent is their climate. The great ocean of 

sand in Africa communicates by Yemen* with Gedrosia and Beloochistan, as far as the right bank 

of the Indus. (* We cannot be surprised that the Arabic should be richer than any other language 

of the East in words expressing the ideas of desert, uninhabited plains, and plains covered with 

gramina. I could give a list of thirty-five of these words, which the Arabian authors employ without 

always distinguishing them by the shades of meaning which each separate word expresses. 

Makadh and kaah indicate, in preference, plains; bakaak, a table-land; kafr, mikfar, smlis, mahk, 

and habaucer, a naked desert, covered with sand and gravel; tanufah, a steppe. Zahra means at 

once a naked desert and a savannah. The word steppe, or step, is Russian, and not Tartarian. In 

the Turco-Tartar dialect a heath is called tala or tschol. The word gobi, which Europeans have 

corrupted into cobi, signifies in the Mongol tongue a naked desert. It is equivalent to the scha-mo 

or khan-hai of the Chinese. A steppe, or plain covered with herbs, is in Mongol, kudah; in Chinese, 

kouana.) It is from the effect of winds that have passed over the deserts situated to the east, that 

the little basin of the Red Sea, surrounded by plains which send forth from all sides radiant caloric, 

is one of the hottest regions of the globe. The unfortunate captain Tuckey relates,* (* Expedition to 

explore the river Zahir, 1818.) that the centigrade thermometer keeps there generally in the night 

at 34 degrees, and by day from 40 to 44 degrees. We shall soon see that, even in the 

westernmost part of the steppes of Caracas, we seldom found the temperature of the air, in the 

shade, above 37 degrees.  These physical considerations on the steppes of the New World are 

linked with others more interesting, inasmuch as they are connected with the history of our 

species. The great sea of sand in Africa, the deserts without water, are frequented only by 

caravans, that take fifty days to traverse them.* (* This is the maximum of the time, according to 

Major Rennell, Travels of Mungo Park volume 2.) Separating the Negro race from the Moors, and 

the Berber and Kabyle tribes, the Sahara is inhabited only in the oases. It affords pasturage only in 

the eastern part, where, from the effect of the trade-winds, the layer of sand being less thick, the 

springs appear at the surface of the

had kept buried in the ground. Mary was carried on board ship when she was fast asleep at night, 

and poor Robert cried like a child at parting from her. John Morris proved a faithful friend. He took 

Mary to London, and sent a message to his sister Betty who was then living in Devonshire. When 

she arrived she was able to identify her nursling, and to tell John that Mr. Dallas had arrived from 

Calcutta and had offered a large reward for the recovery of his niece. So Mary was placed under 

the guardianship of her mother's brother, who took good care both of her and her estates, and the 

wicked uncle was so overcome with shame, when the story of his crime got about, that he went 

crazy and ended his days in a lunatic asylum."  "And the best place for him, too!" commented 

Jess. "He must have been a brute. I dare say things like that really _did_ happen before there 

were daily papers to publish photos of lost children, and when the Maoris in New Zealand were 

still savages. Look here, my hearties! Do you realize it's 5.35? We've got exactly ten minutes to 

clear up before Rachel arrives on the rampage."  "Gracious! Help me out of these duds! Rachel 

would never let me hear the end of it if she caught me as a May Queen. I know her sarcastic 

tongue," squealed Peachy. "Thanks just fifty thousand times for my birthday party. It's been 

absolutely prime, and I've never enjoyed anything as much for years. Sorry to send you others into 

the cold, cold world, but I'm afraid you'll have to scoot and change."     CHAPTER XVI  Concerning 

Juniors   Though all the Camellia Buds had keenly enjoyed Peachy's birthday festivities they were 

none of them satisfied to allow the mystery of the hiding of their cakes to remain unsolved. They 

questioned Elsie, who was often an envoy between themselves and the rest of the Transition, but 

Elsie professed utter ignorance, and assured them that the particular girls whom they suspected 

had been playing tennis during the whole of their recreation, and could not possibly have had time 

or opportunity to enter dormitory 13 unnoticed by some of their companions.  "We'd have seen 

them," declared Elsie. "Besides, they'd have boasted about it. Whoever's the trick was, it wasn't 

ours. If you want my opinion I should say ask some of those juniors. They're absolute imps and 

ready for anything."  This was quite a new view of the case. scorching, fertilized by fine rivers, 

present fewer obstacles to the intercourse of nations. The Llanos separate the chain of the coast 

of Caracas and the Andes of New Grenada from the region of forests; from that woody region of 

the Orinoco which, from the first discovery of America, has been inhabited by nations more rude, 

and farther removed from civilization, than the inhabitants of the coast, and still more than the 

mountaineers of the Cordilleras. The steppes, however, were no more heretofore the rampart of 

civilization than they are now the rampart of the liberty of the hordes that live in the forests. They 

have not hindered the nations of the Lower Orinoco from going up the little rivers and making 

incursions to the north and the west. If, according to the various distribution of animals on the 

globe, the pastoral life could have existed in the New World--if, before the arrival of the Spaniards, 

the Llanos and the Pampas had been filled with those numerous herds of cows and horses that 

graze there, Columbus would have found the human race in a state quite different. Pastoral 

nations living on milk and cheese, real nomad races, would have spread themselves over those 

vast plains which communicate with each other. They would have been seen at the period of great 

droughts, and even at that of inundations, fighting for the possession of pastures; subjugating one 

another mutually; and, united by the common tie of manners, language, and worship, they would 

have risen to that state of demi-civilization which we observe with surprise in the nations of the 

Mongol and Tartar race. America would then, like the centre of Asia, have had its conquerors, 



who, ascending from the plains to the tablelands of the Cordilleras, and abandoning a wandering 

life, would have subdued the civilized nations of Peru and New Grenada, overturned the throne of 

the Incas and of the Zaque,* and substituted for the despotism which is the fruit of theocracy, that 

despotism which arises from the patriarchal government of a pastoral people. (* The Zaque was 

the secular chief of Cundinamarca. His power was shared with the high priest (lama) of Iraca.) In 

the New World the human race has not experienced these great moral and political changes, 

because the steppes, though more fertile than those of Asia, have remained without herds; 

because none of the animals 


_
mischief so certainly on the rival sorority that they had never thought of the younger girls. Peachy, 

catching Olive, Doris, and Natalie, the trio whom she had named her "triplets," taxed them 

solemnly with the crime. They burst out laughing.  "We 'did' you neatly!"  "Were you all this time 

guessing it was us?"  "I expect you had a hunt for those cakes!"  Peachy focussed a stern eye 

upon milk in abundance are natives of the plains of South America; and because, in the 

progressive unfolding of American civilization, the intermediate link is wanting that connects the 

hunting with the agricultural nations.  We have thought proper to bring together these general 

notions on the plains of the New Continent, and the contrast they exhibit to the deserts of Africa 

and the fertile

them into attention.  "Now, what d'you mean by such impudence? How dare you go into our 

dormitory? Juniors aren't to play tricks on their seniors! That was bumped into my head when I 

was a kid, and I'll bump it jolly well into yours!"  The trio pouted.  "We thought you called yourself 

our Fairy Godmother," said Olive sulkily.  "Well! So I do!"  "Not much fairy about it, or godmother 

either. You do nothing some interest to the narrative of a journey across lands of so monotonous 

an aspect. Having now accomplished this task, I shall trace the route by which we proceeded from 

the volcanic mountains of Parapara and the northern side of the Llanos, to the banks of the Apure, 

in the province of Varinas.  After having passed two nights on horseback, and sought in vain, by 

day, for some shelter from the heat of the
