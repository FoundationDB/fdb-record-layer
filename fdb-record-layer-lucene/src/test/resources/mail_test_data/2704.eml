Richard Gantry was still lacking, in a character admirable and most lovable=

when he sprang from his chair and began to walk the floor of his private of=
fice with his head down=20

and his hands deeply buried in his pockets, he was once more the true corpo=
ration liegeman, loyal=20

to his salt, and anxious only to contrive means to an end.  "Confound his p=
icture!" he muttered,=20

"why the devil can't he see that he's got everything to lose and nothing to=
 gain? It's a thousand=20

straight through Lake Menzaleh, which ends here.  "If you will look to the =

commander after a time, "you will see a considerable body of water. That is=

digging had to be carried. There are some curves here, the canal is the nar=
rowest in all its course,=20
