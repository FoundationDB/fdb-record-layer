tiers of columns set out from the wall all round, like the colonnade of a p=
eristyle. The central part is=20

open to the sky, without a roof. Folding doors lead to it at each end, in t=
he porticoes in front and in=20

the rear. There is no example of this sort in Rome, but in Athens there is =
the octastyle in the=20

precinct of the Olympian.     CHAPTER III  THE PROPORTIONS OF INTERCOLUMNIA=
TIONS=20

AND OF COLUMNS   1. There are five classes of temples, designated as follow=
s: pycnostyle, with=20

the columns close together; systyle, with the intercolumniations a little w=
ider; diastyle, more open=20

still; araeostyle, farther apart than they ought to be; eustyle, with the i=
ntervals apportioned just=20

right.  [Illustration: THE CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES ACCORDING TO=20

INTERCOLUMNIATION]  2. The pycnostyle is a temple in an intercolumniation o=
f which the=20

thickness of a column and a half can be inserted: for example, the temple o=
f the Divine Caesar,=20

that of Venus in Caesar's forum, and others constructed like them. The syst=
yle is a temple in=20

which the thickness of two columns can be placed in an intercolumniation, a=
nd in which the plinths=20

of the bases are equivalent to the distance between two plinths: for exampl=
e, the temple of=20

Equestrian Fortune near the stone theatre, and the others which are constru=
cted on the same=20

principles.  3. These two kinds have practical disadvantages. When the matr=
ons mount the steps=20

for public prayer or thanksgiving, they cannot pass through the intercolumn=
iations with their arms=20

about one another, but must form single file; then again, the effect of the=
 folding doors is thrust out=20

of sight by the crowding of the columns, and likewise the statues are throw=
n into shadow; the=20

narrow space interferes also with walks round the temple.  4. The construct=
ion will be diastyle=20

when we can insert the thickness of three columns in an intercolumniation, =
as in the case of the=20

temple of Apollo and Diana. This arrangement involves the danger that the a=
rchitraves may break=20

on account of the great width of the intervals.  5. In araeostyles we canno=
t employ stone or marble=20

for the architraves, but must have a series of wooden beams laid upon the c=
olumns. And=20

moreover, in appearance these temples are clumsy-roofed, low, broad, and th=
eir pediments are=20

adorned in the Tuscan fashion with statues of terra-cotta or gilt bronze: f=
or example, near the=20

Circus Maximus, the temple of Ceres and Pompey's temple of Hercules; also t=
he temple on the=20

Capitol.  6. An account must now be given of the eustyle, which is the most=
 approved class, and is=20

arranged on principles developed with a view to convenience, beauty, and st=
rength. The intervals=20

should be made as wide as the thickness of two columns and a quarter, but t=
he middle=20

intercolumniations, one in front and the other in the rear, should be of th=
e thickness of three=20

columns. Thus built, the effect of the design will be beautiful, there will=
 be no obstruction at the=20

entrance, and the walk round the cella will be dignified.  [Illustration: T=
HE EUSTYLE TEMPLE OF=20

VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE OF TEOS]  7. The rule of this arrangemen=
t may be=20

set forth as follows. If a tetrastyle is to be built, let the width of the =
front which shall have already=20

been determined for the temple, be divided into eleven parts and a half, no=
t including the=20

substructures and the projections of the bases; if it is to be of six colum=
ns, into eighteen parts. If=20

an octastyle is to be constructed, let the front be divided into twenty-fou=
r parts and a half. Then,=20

whether the temple is to be tetrastyle, hexastyle, or octastyle, let one of=
 these parts be taken, and=20

it will be the module. The thickness of the columns will be equal to one mo=
dule. Each of the=20

intercolumniations, except those in the middle, will measure two modules an=
d a quarter. The=20

middle intercolumniations in front and in the rear will each measure three =
modules. The columns=20

themselves will be nine modules and a half in height. As a result of this d=
ivision, the=20



intercolumniations and the heights of the columns will be in due proportion=
.  8. We have no=20

example of this in Rome, but at Teos in Asia Minor there is one which is he=
xastyle, dedicated to=20

Father Bacchus.  These rules for symmetry were established by Hermogenes, w=
ho was also the=20

first to devise the principle of the pseudodipteral octastyle. He did so by=
 dispensing with the inner=20

rows of thirty-eight columns which belonged to the symmetry of the dipteral=
 temple, and in this way=20

he made a saving in expense and labour. He thus provided a much wider space=
 for the walk round=20

the cella between it and the columns, and without detracting at all from th=
e general effect, or=20

making one feel the loss of what had been really superfluous, he preserved =
the dignity of the=20

whole work by his new treatment of it.  9. For the idea of the pteroma and =
the arrangement of the=20

columns round a temple were devised in order that the intercolumniations mi=
ght give the imposing=20

effect of high relief; and also, in case a multitude of people should be ca=
ught in a heavy shower=20

and detained, that they might have in the temple and round the cella a wide=
 free space in which to=20

wait. These ideas are developed, as I have described, in the pseudodipteral=
 arrangement of a=20

temple. It appears, from time to time a smothered moan; it was my wife sobb=
ing. Alexey, invariably=20

meek, sleepy, and sanctimonious, kept coming up to the table to see to the =
candles, and looked at=20

me somewhat strangely.  "Yes, I must go away," I decided at last, feeling u=
tterly exhausted. "As=20

far as possible from these agreeable impressions! I will set off tomorrow."=
  I gathered together the=20

papers and exercise books, and went down to my wife. As, feeling quite worn=
 out and shattered, I=20

held the papers and the exercise books to my breast with both hands, and pa=
ssing through my=20

bedroom saw my trunks, the sound of weeping reached me through the floor.  =
"Are you a kammer-

junker?" a voice whispered in my ear. "That's a very pleasant thing. But ye=
t you are a reptile."  "It's=20

all nonsense, nonsense, nonsense," I muttered as I went downstairs. "Nonsen=
se... and it's=20

nonsense, too, that I am actuated by vanity or a love of display.... What r=
ubbish! Am I going to get=20

a decoration for working for the peasants or be made the director of a depa=
rtment? Nonsense,=20

nonsense! And who is there to show off to here in the country?"  I was tire=
d, frightfully tired, and=20

something kept whispering in my ear: "Very pleasant. But, still, you are a =
reptile." For some reason=20

I remembered a line out of an old poem I knew as a child: "How pleasant it =
is to be good!"  My wife=20

was lying on the couch in the same attitude, on her face and with her hands=
 clutching her head.=20

She was crying. A maid was standing beside her with a perplexed and frighte=
ned face. I sent the=20

maid away, laid the papers on the table, thought a moment and said:  "Here =
are all your papers,=20

Natalie. It's all in order, it's all capital, and I am very much pleased. I=
 am going away tomorrow."=20

She went on crying. I went into the drawing-room and sat there in the dark.=
 My wife's sobs, her=20

sighs, accused me of something, and to justify myself I remembered the whol=
e of our quarrel,=20

starting from my unhappy idea of inviting my wife to our consultation and e=
nding with the exercise=20

books and these tears. It was an ordinary attack of our conjugal hatred, se=
nseless and unseemly,=20

such as had been frequent during our married life, but what had the starvin=
g peasants to do with=20

it? How could it have happened that they had become a bone of contention be=
tween us? It was=20

just as though pursuing one another we had accidentally run up to the altar=
 and had carried on a=20

quarrel there.  "Natalie," I said softly from the drawing-room, "hush, hush=
!"  To cut short her=20

weeping and make an end of this agonizing state of affairs, I ought to have=
 gone up to my wife and=20

comforted her, caressed her, or apologized; but how could I do it so that s=
he would believe me?=20

How could I persuade the wild duck, living in captivity and hating me, that=
 it was dear to me, and=20



that I felt for its sufferings? I had never known my wife, so I had never k=
nown how to talk to her or=20

what to talk about. Her appearance I knew very well and appreciated it as i=
t deserved, but her=20

spiritual, moral world, her mind, her outlook on life, her frequent changes=
 of mood, her eyes full of=20

hatred, her disdain, the scope and variety of her reading which sometimes s=
truck me, or, for=20

instance, the nun-like expression I had seen on her face the day before--al=
l that was unknown and=20

incomprehensible to me. When in my collisions with her I tried to define wh=
at sort of a person she=20

was, my psychology went no farther than deciding that she was giddy, imprac=
tical, ill-tempered,=20

guided by feminine logic; and it seemed to me that that was quite sufficien=
t. But now that she was=20

crying I had a passionate desire to know more.  The weeping ceased. I went =
up to my wife. She=20

sat up on the couch, and, with her head propped in both hands, looked fixed=
ly and dreamily at the=20

fire.  "I am going away tomorrow morning," I said.  She said nothing. I wal=
ked across the room,=20

sighed, and said:  "Natalie, when you begged me to go away, you said: 'I wi=
ll forgive you=20

everything, everything'.... So you think I have wronged you. I beg you calm=
ly and in brief terms to=20

formulate the wrong I've done you."  "I am worn out. Afterwards, some time.=
.." said my wife.  "How=20

am I to blame?" I went on. "What have I done? Tell me: you are young and be=
autiful, you want to=20

live, and I am nearly twice your age and hated by you, but is that my fault=
? I didn't marry you by=20

force. But if you want to live in freedom, go; I'll give you your liberty. =
You can go and love whom=20

you please.... I will give you a divorce."  "That's not what I want," she s=
aid. "You know I used to=20

love you and always thought of myself as older than you. That's all nonsens=
e.... You are not to=20

blame for being older or for my being younger, or that I might be able to l=
ove some one else if I=20

were free; but because you are a difficult person, an egoist, and hate ever=
y one."  "Perhaps so. I=20

don't know," I said.  "Please go away. You want to go on at me till the mor=
ning, but I warn you I am=20

quite worn out and cannot answer you. You promised me to go to town. I am v=
ery grateful; I ask=20

nothing more."  My wife wanted me to go away, but it was not easy for me to=
 do that. I was=20

dispirited and I dreaded the big, cheerless, chill rooms that I was so wear=
y of. Sometimes when I=20

had an ache or a pain as a child, I=20


_
Hermogenes produced results which exhibit much acute ingenuity, and that he=
 left sources from=20

which those who came after him could derive instructive principles.  [Illus=
tration: VITRUVIUS'=20

RULES FOR THE DIAMETER AND HEIGHT OF COLUMNS IN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF=20

TEMPLE COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES]  10. In araeostyle temples, the colum=
ns=20

should be constructed so that their thickness is one eighth part of their h=
eight. In the diastyle, the=20

height of a column should be measured off into eight and a half parts, and =
the thickness of the=20

column fixed at one of these parts. In the systyle, let the height be divid=
ed into nine and a half=20

parts, and one of these given to the thickness of to huddle up to my mother=
 or my nurse, and when=20

I hid my face in the warm folds of their dress, it seemed to me as though I=
 were hiding from the=20

pain. And in the same way it seemed to me now that I could only hide from m=
y uneasiness in this=20

little room beside my wife. I sat down and screened away the light from my =
eyes with my hand....=20

There was a stillness.  "How are you to blame?" my wife said after a long s=
ilence, looking at me=20

with red eyes that gleamed with tears. "You are very well educated and very=
 well bred, very=20

honest, just, and high-principled, but in you the effect of all that is tha=
t wherever you go you bring=20

suffocation, oppression, something insulting and humiliating=20


_
height should be divided into ten parts, and one of these used for the thic=
kness of the column. In=20

the eustyle temple, let the height of a column be divided, as in the systyl=
e, into nine and a half=20

parts, and let one part be taken for the thickness at the bottom of the sha=
ft. With these dimensions=20

we shall be taking into account the proportions of the intercolumniations. =
 11. For the You have a=20

straightforward way of looking at things, and so you hate the whole world. =
You hate those who=20

have faith, because faith is an expression of ignorance and lack of culture=
, and at the same time=20

you hate those who have no faith for having no faith and no ideals; you hat=
e old people for being=20

conservative and behind the times, and young people for free-thinking. The =
interests=20
