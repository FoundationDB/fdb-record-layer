and I will divide an egg=20

between us--I read somewhere that eggs were very nourishing, and half a one=
 each will do fine.=20

Come into the garden now, Eyebright. Oh, Primrose! I don't feel a bit low a=

income. If we choose we can eat so very little, and then if the ---- _Revie=

r head a little more=20

erect than usual, her step firm, and a proud bright light in her eyes, went=
 quickly down the little=20

rambling village street. The plain black dress she wore set off her yellow =
hair and extremely fair=20

complexion to the best advantage. She had never looked sweeter or more inde=
pendent than at=20

this moment, when, for the first time in her young life, she was about to a=
sk for help.  Mr.=20

Danesfield was not so busy this morning, and he saw his young visitor witho=
ut delay.  "Sit down,=20

my dear," he said; "I am very pleased to see you. You want to ask for my ad=
vice? I will give it with=20

the greatest pleasure."  Primrose raised her head slowly. "I have been thin=
king over what you said=20

yesterday," she began. "As it is quite impossible for my sisters and me to =
live on our little income,=20

even with the help of what you have in the bank, we must try to help oursel=
ves, must we not?"=20

"This is a brave thought, my dear--of course you must help yourselves, and =
you will be none the=20

worse for doing so."  "We must earn money," continued Primrose. "How can gi=
rls like us, who are=20

not educated--for I know we are not _really_ educated--add to our incomes?"=
  Mr. Danesfield knit=20

his brows. "Child," he said, "you ask me a puzzler. I have no children of m=
y own, and I know very=20

little about young folk. Of one thing, however, I am quite certain; Daisy c=
an earn no money, nor=20

can Jasmine. You, Primrose, might with some difficulty get a little place a=
s a nursery governess;=20

you are a nice, presentable-looking girl, my dear."  Primrose flushed, and =
the tears, wrung from=20

great pain, came into her eyes.  "There is distribution of electronic works=

Danesfield again knit his brows, and this time he fidgeted uneasily on his =
chair.  "Look here,=20

Primrose," he said: "I am an old bachelor, and I don't know half nor a quar=

Everything in my power you may depend on my doing. I will exert my interest=

. "I know you mean to=20

be very kind, but we three must keep together, and we must be independent."=
 Then she left the=20
