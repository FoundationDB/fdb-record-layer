opportunity to see and hear much about what was going on at the plantation. And he believes that 

Mr. Hall knew just how the overseer dealt with the slaves.  On the Hall plantation there was a 

contraption, similar to a gallows, where the slaves were suspended and whipped. At the top of this 

device were blocks of wood with chains run through holes and high enough that a slave when tied 

to the chains by his fingers would barely touch the ground with his toes. This was done so that the 

slave could not shout or twist his body while being whipped. The whipping was prolonged until the 

body of the slave covered with welts and blood trickled down his naked body. Women were 

treated in the same manner, and a pregnant woman received no more leniency than did a man. 

Very often after a severe flogging a slave's body was treated to a bath of water containing salt and 

pepper so that the pain would be more lasting and aggravated. The whipping was done with 

Church, the federation of Europe, or rather the federation of mankind. The political sympathy of 

England with Continental nations, especially with France, has been increasing of late in a very 

marked manner, the French Revolution of 1830 told at once upon the fortunes of English Reform, 

and the victory of the Republic over the reactionary attempt of May was profoundly felt by both 

parties in England. Placed too close to the Continent not to be essentially a part of the European 

system, England has yet been a peculiar and semi-independent part of it. In European progress 

she has often acted as a balancing and moderating power. She has been the asylum of 

vanquished ideas and parties. In the seventeenth century, when absolutism and the Catholic 

reaction prevailed on the Continent, she was the chief refuge of Protestantism and political liberty. 

When the French Revolution swept Europe, she threw herself into the anti-revolutionary scale.

meaning every lick meant nine. The "cat o' nine tails" was a whip of nine straps attached to a stick; 

the straps were perforated so that everywhere the hole in the strap fell on the flesh a blister was 

left.  The treatment given by the overseer was very terrifying. He relates how a slave was put in a 

room and locked up for two and three days at a time without water or food, because the overseer 

thought he hadn't done enough work in a given time.  Another offense which brought forth severe 

punishment was that of crossing the road to another plantation. A whipping was given and very 

often a slave was put on starvation for a few days.  One privilege given slaves on the plantation 

was appreciated by all and that was the opportunity to hear the word of God. The white people 

gathered in log and sometimes frame churches and the slaves were permitted to sit about the 

church yard on wagons and on the ground and listen to the preaching. When the slaves wanted to 

hold church they had to get special permission round the world, at least nearly round Europe; but 

on the flag of England still remains the religious symbol of the era before the Revolution.  The 

insular arrogance of the English character is a commonplace joke. It finds, perhaps, its strongest 

expression in the saying of Milton that the manner of God is to reveal things first to His 

Englishmen. It has made Englishmen odious even to those who, like the Spaniards, have received 

liberation or protection from English hands. It stimulated the desperate desire to see France rid of 

the "Goddams" which inspired Joan of Arc. For an imperial people it is a very unlucky peculiarity, 

since it precludes not only fusion but sympathy and almost intercourse with the subject races. The 

kind heart of Lord Elgin, when he was Governor- General of India, was shocked by the absolute 

want of sympathy or bond of any kind, except love of conquest, between the Anglo-Indian and the 

native, and the gulf apparently, instead of being filled up, now yawns wider than ever.  It is

was used. A white Preacher was called in and he would preach to them not to steal, lie or run 

away and "be sure and git all dem weeds outen dat corn in de field and your master will think a 

heap of you." Charles does not remember anything else the preacher told them about God. They 

learned more about God when they sat outside the church waiting to drive their masters and family 

back home.  Charles relates an incident of a slave named Sambo who thought himself very smart 

and who courted the favor of the master. The neighboring slaves screamed so loudly while insular 

position in giving birth to commerce and developing the corresponding elements of political 

character. The British Islands are singularly well placed for trade with both hemispheres; in them, 

more than in any other point, may be placed the commercial centre of the world. It may be said 

that the nation looked out unconsciously from its cradle to an immense heritage beyond the 

Atlantic. France and Spain looked the same way, and became competitors with England for 

ascendancy in the New World, but England was more maritime, and the most maritime was sure
