keeping in view the health of mankind.     CHAPTER IV  TESTS OF GOOD WATER   1. Springs 

should be tested and proved in advance in the following ways. If they run free and open, inspect 

and observe the physique of the people who dwell in the vicinity before beginning to conduct the 

water, and if their frames are strong, their complexions fresh, legs sound, and eyes clear, the 

springs deserve complete approval. If it is a spring just dug out, its water is excellent if it can be 

sprinkled into a Corinthian vase or into any other sort made of good bronze without leaving a spot 

on it. Again, if such water is boiled in a bronze cauldron, afterwards left for a time, and then poured 

off without sand or mud being found at the bottom of the cauldron, that water also will have proved 

its excellence.  2. And if green vegetables cook quickly when put into a vessel of such water and 

set over a fire, it will be a proof that the water is good and wholesome. Likewise if the water in the 

spring is itself limpid and clear, if there is no growth of moss or reeds where it spreads and flows, 

and if its bed is not polluted by filth of any sort but to him and, remembering the ceremonial mother 

had impressed upon me, I scraped my foot before him, made a very low bow, and craned forward 

to kiss his hand; but the gentleman did not allow me to kiss his hand: he informed me that he was 

not my uncle, but my uncle's footman, Pyotr. The appearance of this Pyotr, far better dressed than 

Pobyedimsky or me, excited in me the utmost astonishment, which, to tell the truth, has lasted to 

this day. Can such dignified, respectable people with stern and intellectual faces really be 

footmen? And what for?  Pyotr told me that my uncle was in the garden with my mother. I rushed 

into the garden.  Nature, knowing nothing of the history of the Gundasov family and the rank of my 

uncle, felt far more at ease and unconstrained than I. There was a clamour going on in the garden 

such as one only hears at fairs. Masses of starlings flitting through the air and hopping about the 

walks were noisily chattering as they hunted for cockchafers. There were swarms of sparrows in 

the lilac-bushes, which threw their tender, fragrant blossoms straight in one's face. Wherever one 

turned, from every direction

clean appearance, these signs indicate that the water is light and wholesome in the highest 

degree.     CHAPTER V  LEVELLING AND LEVELLING INSTRUMENTS   1. I shall now treat of 

the ways in which water should be conducted to dwellings and cities. First comes the method of 

taking the level. Levelling is done either with of the hoopoe and the red-legged falcon. At any other 

time I should have begun chasing dragon-flies or throwing stones at a crow which was sitting on a 

low mound under an aspen-tree, with his blunt beak turned away; but at that moment I was in no 

mood for mischief. My heart was throbbing, and I felt a cold sinking at
