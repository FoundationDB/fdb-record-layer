Those high in fame by strength of good right arm,     And those who with th=

oppressed moon.                [_Exit._]    27  _Maid._ [_Entering._] Mistr=

Brahman has come with a message from Charudatta.  _Vasantasena._ Ah, this i=
s a joyful day.=20

Show him every mark of respect, girl, and have him conducted hither by one =
of the pages.=20

_Maid._ Yes, mistress.                               [_Exit._         *    =
   *       *       *       *  [_Enter Maitreya=20

with a page._]  _Maitreya._ Well! Ravana, the king of the demons, travels w=
ith his chariot that they=20

call the "Blossom." He earned it by his penances. Now I am a Brahman, and t=
hough I never=20

performed any penances, I travel with another sort of a blossom--a woman of=
 the town.  _Maid._=20

Sir, will you inspect our gateway.  _Maitreya._ [_Gazes admiringly._] It ha=
s just been sprinkled and=20

cleaned and received a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty as a pi=
cture with the offerings of=20

all sorts of fragrant flowers. It stretches up its head as if it wanted to =
peep into the sky. It is=20

adorned with strings of jasmine garlands that hang down and toss about like=
 the trunk of the=20

heavenly elephant. It shines with its high ivory portal. It is lovely with =
any number of holiday=20

banners that gleam red as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as=
 they flutter in the=20

breeze and seem to invite me to enter. Both sides are decorated with holida=
y water-jars of crystal,=20

which are charming with their bright-green mango twigs, and are set at the =
foot of the pillars that=20

sustain the portal. The doors are of gold, thickly set with diamonds as har=
d to pierce as a giant's=20

breast. It actually wearies a poor devil's envy. Yes, Vasantasena's house-d=
oor is a beautiful thing.=20

Really, it forcibly challenges the attention of a man who doesn't care abou=
t such things. how one=20

may remain in the world, and yet not be of the world; by personal converse =
and by his spiritual=20

letters he became the director of courtiers and of ladies. The motto of the=
 literary Academy which=20

he founded at Annecy expresses his spirit--_flores fructusque perennes_--fl=
owers for their own=20

sake, but chiefly for the sake of fruit. Much of the genius for holiness of=
 the courtly saint has=20

passed into the volume of reminiscences by Bishop Camus, his companion and =
disciple--_l'Esprit=20

de Saint Francois de Sales_.  A mundane society, however, where fine gentle=
men and ladies=20

meet to admire and be admired, needs other outlets for its imagination than=
 that of the primrose=20

way to Paradise. The labour of the fields had inspired Olivier de Serres wi=
th the prose Georgics of=20

his _Theatre d'Agriculture_, a work directed towards utility; the romance o=
f the fields, and the=20

pastoral, yet courtly, loves of a French Arcady, were the inspiration of th=
e endless prose bucolics=20

found in the _Astree_ of HONORE D'URFE. The Renaissance delight in the past=
oral had passed=20

from Italy to Spain; through the _Diana_ of the Spanish Montemayor it passe=
d to France. After a=20

period of turbulent strife there was a fascination in visions of a peace, i=
nto which, if warfare=20

entered, the strange irruption only enhanced an habitual calm. A whole gene=
ration waited long to=20

learn the issue of the passion of Celadon and Astree. The romance, of which=
 the earliest part=20

appeared in 1610, or earlier, was not completely published until 1627, when=
 its author was no=20

longer living.[1] The scene is laid in the fields of d'Urfe's familiar Fore=
z and on the banks of the=20

Lignon; the time is of Merovingian antiquity. The shepherd Celadon, banishe=
d on suspicion of=20

faithlessness from the presence of his beloved Astree, seeks death beneath =
the stream; he is=20

saved by the nymphs, escapes the amorous pursuit of Galatea, assumes a femi=
nine garb, and,=20



protected by the Druid Adamas, has the felicity of daily beholding his shep=
herdess. At length he=20

declares himself, and is overwhelmed with reproaches; true lover that he is=
, when he offers his=20

body to the devouring lions of the Fountain of Love, the beasts=20

[68.16. S.  _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the first court.  _Maitreya._ [_En=
ters and looks about._]=20

Well! Here in the first court are rows of balconies brilliant as the moon, =
or as sea-shells, or as=20

lotus-stalks; whitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them; gleaming wit=
h golden stairways=20

inlaid with all sorts of gems: they seem to gaze down on Ujjayini with thei=
r round faces, the crystal=20

windows, from which strings of pearls are dangling. The porter sits there a=
nd snoozes as=20

comfortably as a professor. The crows which they tempt with rice-gruel and =
curdled milk will not=20

eat the offering, because they can't distinguish it from the mortar. Show m=
e the way, madam.=20

_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the second court.  _Maitreya._ [_Enters and lo=
oks about._] Well!=20

Here in the second court the cart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouth=
fuls of grass and pulse-

stalks which are Druid discreetly guides events; Celadon's fidelity receive=
s its reward in marriage,=20

and the banks of the Lignon become a scene of universal joy. The colours of=
 the _Astree_ are=20

faded now as those of some ancient tapestry, but during many years its succ=
ess was prodigious.=20

D'Urfe's highest honour, of many, is the confession of La Fontaine:--     "=
_Etant petit garcon je=20

lisais son roman,     Et je le lis encore ayant la barbe grise._"  The _Ast=
ree_ won its popularity, in=20

part because it united the old attraction of a chivalric or heroic strain w=
ith that of the newer=20

pastoral; in part because it idealised the gallantries and developed the am=
orous casuistry of the=20

day, not without a real sense of the power of love; in part because it was =
supposed to exhibit ideal=20

portraits of distinguished contemporaries. It was the parent of a numerous =
progeny; and as the=20

heroic romance of the=20
