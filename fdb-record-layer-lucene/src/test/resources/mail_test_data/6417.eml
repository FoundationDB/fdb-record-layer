Captain Redfield paused a little while to recover his balance, and sat down to cogitate the matter 

of the disposition of his prisoner; and, also, to watch for the return of his men from an excursion 

they had gone upon for the entertainment of their guests. They were slow in coming, and an 

annoying suspicion grew upon him. He could not tell what the attitude of Brisbau's men might be; 

or if a conflict between them and his own men were to occur, what consequences might ensue. At 

any rate, he wished to avoid such a conflict if it were by any means possible; but he feared it could 

not be done. His good wife was greatly concerned, and urged upon him some amicable settlement 

with Brisbau, even to the delivery of part of the treasure; for, after all, she thought, his claim might 

be just.  An hour later, them, or that he turned away his head? And why this strain of pathos in a 

nature that seemed essentially joyous and glad and careless?  Not only that, but in the several 

discussions with her father--occasionally becoming rather warm, indeed--Ronald had been 

invariably on the side of the landlord, as was naturally to be expected. He had insisted that the 

great bulk of the land given over to deer was of no possible use to any other living creature; he 

had maintained the right of the landlord to clear any portion of his property of sheep and forest it, if 

by so doing he could gain an increase of rental; he had even maintained the right of the landlord to 

eject non-paying tenants from holdings clearly not capable of supporting the ever-increasing 

families; and so forth.  But was his feeling, after all, 


_
dismay, informed him that an agreement had been made with the visiting seamen which would 

affect their standing with him, but would work him no harm. He said that, upon the arrival of the 

other men, the matter would be discussed with the Captain, and meantime he would take no steps 

toward providing a defense for him in a conflict which was not likely to occur.  This disclosure was 

startling, and a shock to the spirit which had upheld Captain Redfield. His first impulse was to 

attack the man for what he considered the basest treachery, but he desisted. Parley with him he 

could not. He could only await the consequences of the compact which had been hinted at. But 

upon one thing he was determined--not to disclose any knowledge of the secreted treasure 

without first having in hand the credentials from Captain Kidd which he had demanded. His honor 

had been pledged to such a course, and he would not forsake his trust.  The men came. But they 

looked with indifference upon the bound prisoner. There was no display of the strong feelings 

which had been anticipated. The situation was obvious. So far as Captain Redfield was 

concerned, he felt that he had been forsaken, betrayed. There was no man who stood with him. In 

vain he pleaded with his men to stand by him in his defense against a most dastardly plan to 

wrong him. He then inquired their attitude towards Brisbau, and received an evasive answer.  At 

length he gave up the struggle, and sought to learn the purpose of the men who had all now 

gathered before him; those of his own company, and those who had come with Brisbau. One of 

them as spokesman, a new-comer, informed him that he and his friends had accompanied 

Captain Brisbau for the purpose of securing some of the buried treasure, which was known to be 

in that neighborhood; and they intended to find the booty before leaving. He also stated that 

Captain Redfield's men, upon learning about the hidden treasure, had agreed to become 

confederates; and that their master would be treated in every way as a friend, and be given a full 

share of the treasure, provided he would properly inform them and Captain Brisbau, whom they 

intended to release immediately, as to its location. If he for any reason should refuse so to favor 

them, he and his wife would be treated as prisoners, and dealt with as might seem best--until, of 

course, he would consent to aid them in their project.  The response that came was firm and 

unmistakable. The brave custodian averred that he would not betray his trust, even in the very 

face of death. Nor did days of urging and threatening turn him from his purpose.  Brisbau was 

released, and given to understand that the men were in control of affairs; and that his animosity 

towards Captain Redfield must cease.  The woods were scoured for the treasure. Days passed, 

and weeks, and the search was incessant; but there was no discovery made. Captain Redfield 

and his wife, now prisoners in chains, were urged and implored; but he could not be persuaded to 

give the information, although the mental tension he suffered was almost unbearable.  One day on 

a sudden determination, Brisbau set sail with his men and companions, together with the 

prisoners. His purpose was to take a short cruise and then return; meantime allowing Captain 

Redfield a further opportunity to disclose his secret; otherwise--and he repeated his threat made 

upon his first day at Rindout.  The ship stopped at Charleston, and, almost immediately upon its 

arrival, it was seized under a suspicion of piracy, and a search made for evidences of the unlawful 

traffic. The prisoners were released through some favor of the authorities, but Brisbau and his men 

were imprisoned. In the hands of the king's officers their lives were in great jeopardy, but they 

finally escaped the scaffold.  As to Captain Redfield and his wife, the unexpected release was a 

most welcome boon. For her he had felt the tenderest and most agonized solicitude. The 



temptation to acquiesce in the demand of his captors and thus free her from the trying situation 

came often to him with a weight under which he almost broke down. When it was over, the joy of 

freedom was as great as the suffering had been while they were prisoners. He lived thereafter at 

Charleston, and soon outgrew the suspicion with which he was at first regarded, of having being 

connected with the buccaneers. He determined to settle down to an honest, industrious life. My 

grandfather was born soon after.  Captain Redfield was never afterwards known to refer to 

anything connected with a pirate in conversation with any one; and I have never learned whether 

or not he ever afterwards visited Rindout. I know he was wealthy; but then he worked hard and 

saved his earnings, and I do not believe he increased his store from the hidden chests on Money 

Island. The story I have now written he told to my grandfather in his old age, and, upon relating it, 

he urged the greatest caution in his use of it.  Twice my grandfather made unsuccessful efforts to 

find the chests. He urged that I, his grandchild, should keep the knowledge of the treasure as a 

family heritage; but that I might do as I liked about it. After giving the subject very careful thought, I 

have now given up the secret of Money Island, and have not withheld a single detail which was 

told me. Of course, nearly a century and a half has elapsed since the precious booty was hidden. 

The story, therefore, is old, but I do not believe it has suffered from age. Captain Kidd was 

executed in London not long after the hiding of the treasure, and his associates gave up their old 

calling; and probably no one has since disturbed the precious chests.         *       *       *       *       * 

Now, as to when I first heard Mr. Landstone's story. It was when I was a boy in the early forties, 

and the events connected with its telling have modified its conclusion, as will presently be seen. I 

have heretofore spoken very little of the subject to any one; and when I have done so at all, it has 

been to one or two intimate friends as a matter of particular confidence. In my old age, however, I 

am going to let my tale forsake its hiding-place and become public property.  My parents owned a 

summer home on Greenville Sound not far from Money Island. To us children it was the very heart 

of life. The best pleasure of the year was confined to the four months spent there from the first of 

June to the last day of September. We rowed, sailed, fished, swam, hunted, frolicked, and ran the 

whole gamut of youthful delights. Those good days are yet vivid in memory; and it is a matter of 

regret with me that my grandchildren--as fine boys and girls as ever lived--cannot have the same 

wild, wholesome fun at the Sound as fell to my lot when I was a boy.  The time that I now speak of, 

however, was about the middle of May, the balmy month of soft breezes and bright flowers. I had 

been particularly studious in school, and my father agreed to let me spend three days at the 

Sound in company with a young friend. We arranged our food supply, took the old family 

rockaway, and set out early in the morning, as happy a pair of boys as ever started on a project of 

pleasure.  After spending an hour or two at the Sound house, arranging our fishing tackle and 

looking after the boats, which had been hauled up for the winter, we started out on a sail towards 

the beach. It was a fine day for sailing, and the breeze bore us away as smoothly and quickly as if 

we had been in a balloon. As we passed Money Island, we observed a boat moored on the south 

side, and tried to locate the occupants; but we could see nobody, and concluded that it belonged 

to a fishing party who had, for some reason, left the boat tied there.  We sailed on; and when we 

had gone perhaps half a mile away. I happened to turn around, and was surprised to see two men 

stealthily embarking in the boat with what appeared to be shovels and rods of some kind. This 

sight was too much for people? His stout championship of the claims and privileges of Lord Ailine--



that was not incompatible with a deeper sense of the cruelty of driving the poor people away from 

the land of their birth and the home of their childhood? His natural sentiment as a man was not to 

be overborne by the fact that he was officially a dependant on Lord Ailine? These and a good 

many other curious problems concerning him--and concerning his possible future--occupied her 

until she had got back to the snug little parlour; and there, as she found her father seated in front 

of the blazing fire, and engaged in getting through the mighty pile of newspapers and illustrated 

journals and magazines that had come by the previous day's mail, she thought she might as well 

sit down and write a long letter to her bosom friend in Chicago, through whose intermediation 

these verses might discreetly be brought to the notice of Mr. Huysen.  She had reasons for not 

asking any favour directly.  'DEAREST EM,' she wrote--after having studied a long while as to how 

she should begin--'would it surprise you to know that I have at last found my _fate_ in the very 

handsome person of a Scotch gamekeeper?  Well, it aint so; don't break the furniture; but the fact 

is my poor brain has been wool-gathering a little in this land of wild storms and legends and 

romantic ballads; and to-morrow I am fleeing away to Paris--the region of clear atmosphere, and 

reasonable people, and cynicism; and I hope to have any lingering cobwebs of romance 

completely blown out of my head. Not that I would call it romance, _even if it were to happen;_ I 

should call it merely the plain result of my father's theories.  You know he is always preaching that 

all men are born equal; which isn't true anyhow; he would get a little nearer the truth if he were to 

say that all men are born equal except hotel clerks, who are of a superior race; but wouldn't it be a 

joke if I were to take him at his word, and ask him how he would like a gamekeeper as his son-in-

law?  But you need not be afraid, my dear Em; this chipmunk has still got a little of her senses left; 

and I may say in the words of the poet--      "There is not in this wide world a valet so sweet"--  no, 

nor any Claude Melnotte of a gardener, nor any handsome coachman or groom, who could induce 

me to run away with him.  It would be "playing it too low down on pa," as you used to say; besides, 

one knows how these things always end.  Another besides; how do I know that he would marry 

me, even if I asked him?--and I _should_ have to ask him, for he would never ask me.  Now, Em, if 

you don't burn this letter the moment you have read it, I will murder you, as sure as you are alive. 

'Besides, it is a shame.  He is a real good fellow; and no such nonsense has got into his head, I 

know.  I know it, because I tried him twice for fun; I got him to tie my cap under my chin; and I 

made him take my pocket-handkerchief out of my breast-pocket when I was fighting a salmon (I 

caught _five in one day_--monsters!), and do you think the bashful young gentleman was 

embarrassed and showed trembling fingers?  Not a bit; I think he thought me rather a nuisance--in 

the polite phraseology of the English people.  But I wish I could tell you about him, really. It's all 

very well to say he is very handsome and hardy-looking and weather-tanned; but how can I 

describe to you how respectful his manner is, and yet always keeping his own self-respect, and he 

won't quarrel with me--he only laughs when I have been talking absolute folly--though papa and he 

have rare fights, for he has very positive opinions, and sticks to his guns, I can tell you. But the 

astonishing thing is his education; he has been nowhere, but seems to know everything; he seems 

to be quite content to be a gamekeeper, though his brother took his degree at college and is now 

in the Scotch Church.  I tell you he makes me feel pretty small at times.  The other night papa and 

I went along to his cottage after dinner, and found him reading Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the 

Roman Empire_--lent him by his brother, it appeared.  I borrowed the first volume--but, oh, 



squawks! it is a good deal too stiff work for the likes of me.  And then there is never the least 

pretence or show, but all the other way; he will talk to you as long as you like about his 

deerstalking and about what he has seen his dogs do; but never a word about books or writing--

unless you happen to have found out.  'Now I'm coming to business.  I have never seen any 

writing of his until this morning, when, after long goading, he showed me a little poem which I will 

copy out and enclose in this letter when I have finished.  Now, darling Em, I want you to do me a 

real kindness; the first time you see Jack Huysen--I don't want to ask the favour of him direct--will 

you ask him to print it in the _Citizen_, and to say something nice about it?  I don't want any 

patronage: understand--I mean let Jack Huysen understand--that Ronald Strang is a particular 

_friend_ of both my father and myself; and that I am sending you this without his authority, but 

merely to give him a little pleasant surprise, perhaps, when he sees it in print; and perhaps to 

tempt him to give us some more.  I should like him to print a volume,--for he is really far above his 

present station, and it is absurd he should not take his _place_,--and if he did that I know of a 

young party who would buy 500 copies even if she were to go back home without a single Paris 

bonnet. Tell Jack Huysen there is to be _no patronage_, mind; there is to be nothing about the 

peasant poet, or anything like that; for this man is a _gentleman_, if I know anything about it; and I 

won't have him trotted out as a phenomenon--to be discussed by the dudes who smoke cigarettes 

in Lincoln Park.  If you could only talk to him for ten minutes it would be better than fifty letters, but 

I suppose there are _attractions nearer home_ just at present.  My kind remembrances to T.T.  'I 

forgot to say that I am quite ignorant as to whether newspapers ever pay for poetry--I mean if a 

number of pieces were sent?  Or could Jack Huysen find a publisher who would undertake a 

volume; my father will see he does not lose anything by it.  I really want to do something for this 

Ronald, for he has been so kind and attentive to us; and before long it may become more difficult 

to do so; for of course a man of his abilities is not likely to remain as he is; indeed, he has already 

formed plans for getting away altogether from his present way of life, and whatever he tries to do I 

know he will do--and easily.  But if I talk any more about him, you will be making very _very_ 

mistaken guesses; and I won't give you the delight of imagining even for a moment that I have 

been caught at last; when the sad event arrives there will be time enough for you to take your 

cake-walk of triumph up and down the room--of course to _Dancing in the Barn_, as in the days of 

old.'  Here followed a long and rambling chronicle of her travels in Europe since her last letter, all 

of which may be omitted; the only point to be remarked was that her very brief experiences of 

Scotland took up a disproportionately large portion of the space, and that she was minute in her 

description of the incidents and excitement of salmon-fishing. Then followed an outline of her 

present plans; a string of questions; a request for an instant reply; and finally--  _'With dearest 

love, old Em,_        _'Thine,_               _'Carry.'_  And then she had to copy the verses; but when 

she had done that, and risen, and gone to the window for a time, some misgiving seemed to enter 

her mind, for she returned to the table, and sate down again, and wrote this postscript:  'Perhaps, 

after all, you won't see much in this little piece; if you were here, among the very places, and 

affected by all the old stories and romantic traditions and the wild scenery, it might be different. 

Since I've been to 


_
to change our course, and essayed to follow at a distance the movements of the other boat. This 

we had no difficulty in doing; and we afterwards learned that we were successful in our efforts to 

avoid the suspicion of purposely following it.  The men sailed down the Sound a short distance to 

the south, and made for the shore in a little cove at a somewhat secluded place.  We were familiar 

with the locality, and decided to wait until later for a closer observation. Accordingly, we bore once 

again toward the beach, and enjoyed an hour watching the breakers roll upon the shore, and in 

picking up curios, such as are always to be found upon the sea beach.  Upon our return, we 

passed close to the little cove into which the boat had gone, and could readily discern through the 

trees a tent not far inland; in front of which were seated the two strangers, watching a pot hung 

over a fire made upon the ground. This excited an additional flutter of wonderment with us. Indeed, 

what we had seen, coupled with the current tradition regarding Money Island, soon wrought us up 

into a fever of excitement; for it was very suggestive of a search for the treasure on the island.  I 

had heard from my early childhood that Captain Kidd, the historic and lordly pirate, who reigned 

supreme upon the high seas during the seventeenth century, was supposed to have buried some 

of his booty on Money Island. Everybody was familiar with the tradition; and I doubt if there is, 

even now, a single person reared in the town of Wilmington, of in the vicinity of the Sound, who 

has not likewise been told the same indefinite story about the little island. But the presence of 

these two strangers, and their somewhat mysterious conduct, gave the tradition a reading English 

history and literature at home; why, you can't do it, you can't understand it, unless you have lived 

in an atmosphere that is just full of poetry and romance, and meeting people whose names tell you 

they belong to the families who did great things in history centuries and centuries ago.  I can't 

explain it very well--not even to myself; but I feel it; why, you can't take a single day's drive in 

England without coming across a hundred things of interest--Norman churches, and the tombs of 

Saxon Kings, and old abbeys, and monasteries, and battlefields, and, just as interesting as any, 

farm-houses of the sixteenth century in their quaint old-fashioned orchards.  And as for Scotland, 

why, it is just steeped to the lips in poetry and tradition; the hills and the glens have all their 

romantic stories of the clans, many of them very pathetic; and you want to see these wild and 

lonely places before you can understand the legends.  And in southern Scotland too--what could 

any one at home make of such a simple couplet as this--  _"The King sits in Dunfermline town,_ 

_Drinking the blude-red wine;"_  but when you come near Dunfermline and see the hill where 

Malcolm Canmore built his castle in the eleventh century, and when you are told that it was from 

this very town that Sir Patrick Spens and the Scots lords set out for "Norroway o'er the faem," 

everything comes nearer to you. In America, I remember very well, Flodden Field sounded to us 

something very far away, that we couldn't take much interest in; but if you were here just now, 

dear Em, and told that a bit farther north there was a river that the Earl of Caithness and his clan 

had to cross when they went to Flodden, and that the people living there at 


_
We concluded that these men had evidently some positive information on the subject, and were 

showing their confidence in that information by prosecuting a search for the hidden treasure, at 

much trouble and expense. This was clear to us, and we talked the matter over that night with 

eager interest. We surmised every possible case that might have furnished the strange visitors 

with a working clue to the discovery of the treasure. Speculation ran high. But there was one thing 

that we became agreed upon, and that was, to become, if possible, parties to the won't go near it 

on the anniversary of the battle, because on that day the ghosts of the earl and his men, all clad in 

green tartan, come home again and are seen to cross the river, wouldn't that interest you?  In 

America we have got nothing behind us; when you leave the day before yesterday you don't want 

to go back.  But here, in the most vulgar superstitions and customs, you come upon the strangest 

things.  Would you believe it, less than twenty miles from this place there is a little lake that is 

supposed to cure the most desperate diseases--diseases
