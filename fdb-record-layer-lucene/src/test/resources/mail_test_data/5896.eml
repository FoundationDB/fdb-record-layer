Nobody doubted that he was capable of executing his threat, and, since it w=
as known that he=20

enjoyed the protection of the all-powerful Flemings and was something of a =
favourite with the=20

young King himself, the members of the Consulta and some of the principal m=
en in the colony=20

decided, after many discussions, that it would be well to appease the cleri=
go's wrath and come to=20

some arrangement with him for their mutual benefit.  It was then proposed t=
o form a company, in=20

which there should be twenty-four shareholders, each of whom should contrib=
ute an identical sum=20

and derive an equal profit from the undertaking on the Pearl Coast.  Six of=
 the shares should be=20

assigned to the Crown, six to Las Casas and his fifty knights of the Golden=
 Spur, three to Admiral=20

Diego Columbus, one to each of the four auditors of the Audiencia, and the =
remaining five to the=20

treasurer Pasamonte and the other officials of the Audiencia.  This scheme =
was submitted to Las=20

Casas, who must by that time have been well-nigh in despair, and, although =
it very materially=20

changed his original plan, it offered the only possible means for carrying =
out his intentions, so he=20

agreed to the formation of the company.  The agreement upon which the compa=
ny was based=20

gave to Las Casas Ocampo's armada with several brigantines and barques and =
all their contents,=20

and he was to choose amongst the three hundred followers of Ocampo one hund=
red and twenty,=20

who should constitute the armed force of the new colony, under the latter's=
 command.  This=20

arrangement, so it was pretended, would leave Las Casas free to dedicate al=
l his efforts to the=20

conversion of the Indians. The last article of the agreement was almost com=
ical. It provided that=20

when Las Casas himself should denounce any Indians as cannibals, the Spania=
rds should be=20

bound to declare war against them and make slaves of them.  He afterwards w=
rote concerning the=20

articles of agreement as follows:  "Great was the blindness or ignorance--i=
f indeed it was not=20

malice--of those gentlemen to believe that the clerigo would ever fulfil th=
ose horrible and absurd=20

conditions, knowing him to be a good Christian, not covetous, and ready to =
die to liberate and help=20

in saving those people from the condition in which they were held."  With h=
is armada well=20

equipped, and a plentiful supply of provisions and merchandise for trading =
purposes on board, Las=20

Casas finally sailed from Hispaniola in July, 1521, directing his course fi=
rst to the island of Mona,=20

where a quantity of cassava bread was to be taken on board, and from thence=
 to Puerto Rico,=20

where he expected to collect his original colonists.  On his arrival there,=
 not one however, was=20

found to join the expedition, as they had long since dispersed throughout t=
he island or had joined=20

marauding expeditions to capture Indians.  This defection must have caused =
Las Casas great=20

disappointment, for he had assembled these men with great care in Spain, ch=
oosing only such as=20

he thought from their good character to be adapted for his ideal colony.  T=
he change which their=20

new and strange surroundings had operated in these peaceful, simple folk wa=
s not unnatural;=20

loosed from all the anchors that held them to habits of industry and probit=
y, they found themselves=20

caught in new currents; cupidity was awakened by the gold-fever that infect=
ed all the colonists, the=20

pious projects with which they left Spain under the guidance of their apost=
olic leader were easily=20

abandoned when the influence of his enthusiasm was withdrawn, and they took=
 to the freebooting=20

ways and easy morals of the colonists with whom they were thrown.  Las Casa=
s had neglected to=20

realise that they were not angels.  On arriving at that part of the Pearl C=
oast called Cumana, it was=20

found that Ocampo's colony of New Toledo was already in the throes of disco=
ntent from hunger=20

and disease; his men had begun by pressing the Indians into service, with t=
he result that all the=20

natives abandoned the country, leaving the Spaniards to starve.  When it be=
came known that=20



those who chose might return to Hispaniola, every man of them declared he w=
ould go, so Las=20

Casas was left with a few of his friends and some who were in his pay.  Oca=
mpo showed sincere=20

regret and much sadness at abandoning his old friend, for whom, in spite of=
 their differences, he=20

had a sincere admiration, in such a plight.  He took leave of him with many=
 demonstrations of=20

affection, and joining his men sailed away to Hispaniola.  Las Casas was no=
w in his long-desired=20

territory, but the material for starting his colony was sadly reduced.     =
 CHAPTER XII. - THE=20

IDEAL COLONY.   FATE OF THE COLONISTS. FAILURE OF THE ENTERPRISE   Some tim=
e=20

before the events just recounted, Franciscan friars from Picardy had been s=
ent to the Pearl Coast=20

by the Prior Pedro de Cordoba, under the leadership of Fray Juan Garceto, a=
nd this little=20

community heard the news of Las Casas's coming with profound joy.  Upon his=
 arrival, they came=20

to meet him singing Te Deum Laudamus and Benedictus qui venit in nomine Dom=
ini.  The convent=20

was modest enough, being rudely constructed of wood and thatch, and the lif=
e of the friars in the=20

midst of the vast wilderness about them was one of the most apostolic simpl=
icity.  The house=20

stood about a musket-shot back from the Cumana River in a beautiful garden =
which, in such a=20

climate, was not a difficult achievement.  Las Casas built a large storehou=
se on one side of the=20

garden for his trading merchandise and, through the friars and an Indian wo=
man called Maria, who=20

had learned Spanish, he published among the Indians that he had been sent b=
y the new King of=20

the Christians in Spain, and that henceforth there would be no more fightin=
g, but all were to live=20

together in peace and friendship. In order to attract them, he made them pr=
esents from his stores;=20

but it was not unnatural that the diffidence of the Indians should yield bu=
t slowly to these=20

blandishments after the deceptions of which they had been the victims, and =
besides, Las Casas=20

could not trust his own dependents, but had to keep a sharp eye continually=
 on them, to prevent=20

them scandalising and offending the natives.  Under such discouraging circu=
mstances, progress=20

was inevitably slow.  Not only were the Spaniards under his own control in =
little harmony with the=20

spirit of his intentions and as refractory as they dared be to his orders, =
but the pearl fishers on the=20

island of Cubagua, who were a typical lot of godless ruffians, frequently c=
ame to the mainland,=20

with the valid excuse that the absence of sweet water on their island oblig=
ed them to fetch their=20

supply from the Cumana River.  These expeditions for water were usually acc=
ompanied by some=20

disturbances with the Indians, some of whom were frequently captured and ca=
rried off to work in=20

the pearl fisheries.  To put a stop to these incursions into his territory,=
 Las Casas contracted with a=20

mason, for eight dollars in gold per month, to build him a fort at the mout=
h of the river; but the=20

people at Cubagua, hearing of this project which would interrupt and contro=
l their movements,=20

contrived to so influence the mason that he threw up his contract and aband=
oned the work, thus=20

leaving the country defenceless.  The Cubaguans seduced and ruined the Indi=
ans, chiefly by=20

offering them liquors and spirits, which have always proved the white man's=
 most attractive and=20

destructive products to the savage and have ever gone in the vanguard of ci=
vilisation.  The Indians=20

gave everything they possessed for alcohol even selling their fellows as sl=
aves, in exchange for=20

wines; these they drank to inordinate excess, and in the fury of their deba=
uch quarrels broke out=20

amongst them which ended in murders and a state of the most riotous disorde=
r, against which Las=20

Casas and the monks struggled in vain.  The strongest representations and p=
rotests were made to=20

the alcalde of Cubagua, whither Las Casas went in person, but, far from pro=
ducing the desired=20

result, his efforts to protect his own territory only served to excite incr=
eased resentment on the part=20



of his lawless neighbours, and neither his own life nor that of the Francis=
cans was any longer safe=20

from the threatened reprisals of their hostile countrymen.  The situation w=
as one of the greatest=20

gravity and even peril; instead of showing promise of improvement, it grew =
daily worse; for, though=20

the men at Cubagua were somewhat restrained from venturing upon open acts o=
f hostility directed=20

against him since they had seen what powers the royal cedulas gave him, the=
ir ingenuity in=20

devising vexations, inventing contrarieties, and creating obstacles which e=
ffectually nullified all his=20

efforts, was extraordinarily fertile.  Fray Juan Garceto was of the opinion=
 that Las Casas should=20

return to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia and demand that some effe=
ctive restraint be=20

exercised upon the Spaniards at Cubagua or, failing of success there, that =
he should even go to=20

the King himself to obtain redress and the punishment of the offenders.  Th=
is advice did not accord=20

with Las Casas's own view, for he had reason to know how difficult it was t=
o obtain anything from=20

the Audiencia and how easy it was to evade even the most explicit provision=
s of royal cedulas,=20

when it suited the interest of those concerned to do so.  His absence at su=
ch a critical moment=20

would also remove the one effective restraint on the lawlessness of the Cub=
aguans and doubtless=20

result in the total destruction of his stores, which were valued at fifty t=
housand castellanos.  Two=20

vessels were lying off  the coast, loading salt for Hispaniola, and during =
the days previous to their=20

sailing both Las Casas and Fray Juan gave themselves up to earnest prayer a=
nd each offered his=20

daily mass to obtain some divine guidance as to the right course to pursue,=
 since they were in=20

absolute disagreement.  Las Casas prepared a full statement of the situatio=
n, and a petition asking=20

the Audiencia to furnish the necessary remedy without delay, which he inten=
ded to despatch by=20

one of the ship's captains in case he did not go himself when the sailing d=
ay came.  The last day=20

finally arrived, and Fray Juan, after saying his mass, sought Las Casas and=
 said, "It is your duty,=20

sir, to go and on no account to stop here."  "God knows," replied Las Casas=
, "how much this goes=20

against my judgment and my wishes but, since it seems right to your Reveren=
ce, I am willing to do=20

it; if it is an error, I would rather err by the judgment of another than b=
e right by my own, for I hope=20

in God."  The wisdom of submitting his judgment as an act of religious humi=
lity in a matter=20

concerning his own spiritual welfare would have been laudable, but Las Casa=
s was far more=20

qualified to judge on a question of policy affecting the welfare of his ent=
erprise than was Fray Juan=20

Garceto, and the responsibility for repeating the blunder he had made in Pu=
erto Rico of=20

abandoning his colony while he went off to protest to the Audiencia, must r=
est where it belongs--on=20

his own shoulders--and not where he sought to put it--on those of the humbl=
e Franciscan.   If=20

somebody had to go--and it seems that the necessity was urgent--then Fray J=
uan had better have=20

taken the letters and gone himself before the Audiencia, leaving Las Casas =
to withstand his=20

enemies and keep his colony together as best he could, until the Audiencia =
despatched some=20

authority to effectively restrain the Cubaguans.  His resolution taken, in =
accordance with the friar's=20

inspiration, Las Casas appointed Francisco de Soto, a native of Olmedo, as =
captain during his=20

absence and gave him full instructions for his guidance.  It was especially=
 impressed upon the=20

captain that on no account should he permit the two vessels which the colon=
y possessed to leave=20

the harbour; he was to be on the alert and in case of open hostilities he w=
as to load the=20

merchandise on board if possible, but if not, then to save all his people a=
nd take refuge at=20

Cubagua.  Much preoccupied as to the fate of those he left behind and uncer=
tain as to the wisdom=20

of his course, Las Casas set out for Hispaniola, leaving all he possessed i=
n the convent, save one=20



box of his clothing and another containing some books.  It is illustrative =
of the capricious and light-

hearted spirit of disobedience to all authority, save what force imposed, w=
hich characterised=20

Spanish officials in America, that the first thing De Soto did, before the =
ship bearing Las Casas=20

was barely out of sight, was to send away his two vessels, one in one direc=
tion and the other in=20

the opposite, to fish for pearls and, if possible, to capture Indians.  The=
 natives were in a state of=20

unrest owing to the continual vexations of the people of Cubagua and also o=
f Las Casas's men=20

who, as soon as he was gone, became almost as bad as the others.  The beaut=
iful speeches in=20

which peace and justice and friendship were promised for the future, under =
the powerful protection=20

of the new King of Spain, had resulted in nothing, and the last illusion of=
 the Indians vanished with=20

the disappearance of the ship that bore their protector towards Hispaniola.=
  A general massacre of=20

the colony was concerted to take place about fifteen days after Las Casas l=
eft.  The Franciscans=20

got wind of it three days before the date fixed and though the Indian woman=
 Maria, when asked,=20

denied the plot in words, she conveyed to the friars by gestures that she h=
ad lied because the=20

presence of other Indians intimidated her from telling the truth.  A Spanis=
h trading ship arrived in=20

these days, but in spite of the colonists' prayers to be taken on board the=
 captain refused, so the=20

hapless men were left to their fate. At the last moment an effort was made =
to organise some=20

defence and twelve or fourteen pieces of artillery were mounted around the =
storehouse, but when=20

they came to examine the powder, it was found--oh, Spanish improvidence!--t=
o be so damp that it=20

was useless.  At sunrise they thought to dry it, but they were too late, fo=
r with fierce war-whoops,=20

the Indians were upon them; three of their number were killed and the store=
-house, in which the=20

others had barricaded themselves, was set on fire.  Fortunately there was a=
 small door that gave=20

access to the garden, through which they escaped from the burning building.=
  De Soto, who had=20

been out to reconnoitre the town was wounded with a poisoned arrow, but man=
aged to reach the=20

garden where the others were.  The friars had constructed a canal through t=
heir garden leading to=20

the river and on this they had a large Indian canoe capable of holding fift=
y persons.  This canoe=20

was now their sole hope of safety and everybody managed to get into it, sav=
e one unfortunate lay-

brother who had taken refuge among some reeds along the bank and was only d=
iscovered after=20

the canoe had pushed off. Seeing his companions borne swiftly away on the s=
aving current, he=20

rose from his hiding-place with despairing gestures of appeal, but though e=
very effort was made to=20

reach him it was in vain, and he, poor man, seeing that his situation was h=
opeless, signalled to=20

them with pathetic heroism to leave him and save themselves while they coul=
d.  He was killed a=20

few moments later when the Indians, not knowing of the egress into the gard=
en and believing that=20

all the Spaniards were places, and making handkerchiefs appear and disappea=
r, in a surprising=20

manner. Never was more fun crowded into one short afternoon.  =E2=80=9CIt h=
as been a beautiful picnic,=20

and I am very much obliged to you,=E2=80=9D Caro said to Walter as they wer=
e separating.  =E2=80=9CSo am I,=E2=80=9D=20

echoed Marjorie, and Tom would have said the same if he hadn=E2=80=99t been=
 bashful, as it was he could=20

only grin.  =E2=80=9CI am just as much obliged to you for coming to my picn=
ic,=E2=80=9D Walter replied, and he added=20

to Caro, =E2=80=9CGoodby little Candle.=E2=80=9D This was the first time in=
 more than four years that he had given=20

any pleasure to anybody, he thought on the way to the house.  Miss Elizabet=
h stood at the door:=20

=E2=80=9CSurely Walter you are staying out too late,=E2=80=9D she said: =E2=
=80=9CAre you not chilled?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot at all; you can=20

trust Thompson for that,=E2=80=9D he answered.  As for Thompson, he wished =
Miss Grayson could have=20

seen her brother as he told stories and laughed at the pranks of his visito=
rs, and he determined=20



that if he could bring it about there should be more occasions of the sort.=
     CHAPTER VIII  MISS=20

ELIZABETH RECEIVES A SHOCK   Miss Grayson rejoiced in her brother=E2=80=99s=
 unusual cheerfulness,=20

and when she was called away for a few days to a neighboring city on busine=
ss she left with the=20

less reluctance. Home had after all proved the best place for him, she thou=
ght.  She was gone=20

several days, and at the last minute after telegraphing that she would be a=
t home at eight in the=20

evening, she found she could take an earlier train that arrived at three. T=
here was no time for=20

anything but a hurried drive to the station, and she decided, it would be j=
ust as well to surprise=20

Walter. How glad he would be to see her five hours ahead of time! She felt =
quite happy over the=20

thought as she stepped from the train at Charmington.  There was of course =
no one to meet her,=20

and as the day was pleasant and the distance short she walked home. She mig=
ht have taken the=20

street cars if her feeling on the subject had not made it impossible.  It w=
as only natural that the=20

servant who opened the door for her should seem surprised, but Miss Elizabe=
th observed an odd=20

hesitation in his manner when in reply to her questions he said Mr. Grayson=
 was in the library.  To=20

the library she hastened, and as she went there came to her astonished ears=
 the strains of The=20

Last Rose of Summer,--for years that music box had been untouched--and ming=
led with it was a=20

sound like children=E2=80=99s voices. Before her on a chair lay an unfamili=
ar scarlet jacket with other=20

articles of outdoor apparel, and from the floor a pair of small but saucy l=
ooking rubber shoes=20

forced themselves upon her vision. What did it mean--was she dreaming?  At =
the door she=20

paused. In front of the wood fire blazing brightly at one end of the spacio=
us room, Walter=E2=80=99s couch=20

was drawn and around him in attitudes of eager interest were three children=
. They were evidently=20

absorbed in the story he was telling with an animation his sister had thoug=
ht never to see again.=20

Strewn upon the floor were photographs, and on a table a costly illustrated=
 book on birds--one of=20

her brother=E2=80=99s old favorites--lay open; but at present everything el=
se was forgotten in the interest of=20

the story which seemed to be one of adventure, for there was frequent menti=
on of bears. This=20

much Miss Grayson=E2=80=99s bewildered mind took in.  And this was the lone=
ly invalid to whom she had=20

hastened home! Certainly he was not missing her, for she stood there quite =
unobserved. And who=20

were these children who had brought such a light to his eyes? All her devot=
ion had failed to do as=20

much for him. Turning she saw Thompson hovering uneasily in the distance, a=
nd swept down=20

upon him.  =E2=80=9CWho are those children in the library?=E2=80=9D she dem=
anded. Miss Grayson was exceedingly=20

stately and Thompson felt abashed.  =E2=80=9CWhy Miss Elizabeth they=E2=80=
=99re just some children--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI see that;=20

I asked who they are and what they are doing here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell =
you see Miss Elizabeth it looked like=20

Mr. Walter was mighty lonesome to-day and it was too damp to be on the grou=
nd, so I just took the=20

liberty of asking them in to amuse him. It looks like there=E2=80=99s not m=
uch for him to do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDid Mr.=20

Grayson tell you to ask them?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo m=E2=80=99m, but he see=
med right glad to see them. It has cheered=20

him up considerable.=E2=80=9D The sound of laughter from the library emphas=
ized this.  =E2=80=9CBut who _are_=20

they?=E2=80=9D Miss Grayson asked again. Thompson was very trying to her, a=
nd it was only because he=20

suited her brother so well that she kept him.  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t kno=
w exactly, ma=E2=80=99m; they are some kin of Dr.=20

Barrows over at the seminary I believe.=E2=80=9D  This was more than she co=
uld stand. Telling herself that=20

such excitement must be bad for Walter she swept back to the library. The l=
ast notes of music had=20

died away, and Caro heard the rustle of her dress and turned.  Miss Elizabe=
th had thrown back=20

her fur collar, in her face was an unusual glow, she was very handsome Caro=
 thought.  The eyes=20

of the others followed hers, and for a few seconds they all gazed at the la=
dy in silence. Then=20



Walter found his voice:  =E2=80=9CWhy Elizabeth! I did not expect you so ea=
rly,=E2=80=9D he exclaimed.  =E2=80=9CI found I=20

could get off sooner than I thought when I telegraphed. I fear you are tiri=
ng yourself,=E2=80=9D she added=20

coming to his side and bending over him, entirely ignoring the children.  C=
aro rose; =E2=80=9CI =E2=80=99spect we=E2=80=99d=20

better go,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CIt is a lovely story, but if you are=
 tired we can come some other time.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am=20

not tired, Caro,=E2=80=9D Walter answered, taking her hand, =E2=80=9Cbut pe=
rhaps you=E2=80=99d better go now, and as you=20

say we will finish the story another time.=E2=80=9D They smiled at each oth=
er in a way that expressed a=20

world of friendly confidence.  Without another word Miss Grayson turned and=
 left the room. She=20

felt she was a marplot, and yet--those children--what else could she have d=
one? As she went up=20

stairs the sounds of laughter followed her; she wished she had not hurried =
home.  She did not=20

mention the children when she returned to her brother after they had gone, =
but talked of business=20

and other matters, making an effort to act as if nothing unusual had happen=
ed.  After dinner when=20

they were alone together before the fire, Walter spoke: =E2=80=9CElizabeth =
there is something I want very=20

much.=E2=80=9D  She smoothed his hair caressingly from his forehead as she =
replied, =E2=80=9CYou know dear if it is=20

anything I can give you, you shall have it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut this wil=
l be hard for you;=E2=80=9D Walter hesitated, then=20

added, =E2=80=9CIt is my old friends I want.=E2=80=9D  She caught her breat=
h; =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t understand,=E2=80=9D she said.  Then=20

her brother told her about Caro=E2=80=99s visit with Trolley. =E2=80=9CIt h=
as made me feel,=E2=80=9D he continued, =E2=80=9Cas I have=20

thought about it since, that I have been living very selfishly. My life as =
I used to think of it has to be=20

sure, been spoiled, but there are still small things I might do--to make a =
little cheer, as Caro says--

and to begin with I want my friends again. I want to forget--I want you to =
forget--all that has been=20

unpleasant in the past.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you think they will be willi=
ng to come back to you, do you?=E2=80=9D Miss=20

Elizabeth asked bitterly.  =E2=80=9CYes, I think they will,=E2=80=9D he sai=
d simply.  Miss Grayson had often told=20

herself there was nothing she would not do for her brother, but had she dre=
amed of anything like=20

this? Her proud heart had a fierce battle to fight.  =E2=80=9CI shan=E2=80=
=99t ever be Miss Elizabeth again when we=20

dress up; I don=E2=80=99t like her at all,=E2=80=9D Caro said as the childr=
en walked down the garden path together.=20

=E2=80=9CI told you she was cross,=E2=80=9D Marjorie replied.  For lack of =
a better confidant Trolley heard the story=20

that night. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t blame you one bit for not wanting to l=
ive with her, for I =E2=80=99spect she just scared you=20

to death,=E2=80=9D was Caro=E2=80=99s conclusion emphasized by a vigorous h=
ug.     CHAPTER IX  ANNETTE=E2=80=99S=20

WINDOW   =E2=80=9CMarjorie, grandpa is coming home this afternoon; don=E2=
=80=99t you want to go to meet him?=20

Aunt Charlotte says we may go in the carriage.=E2=80=9D It was the first co=
ld day of the season and Caro=20

looked like a bright-eyed squirrel in her gray coat and chinchilla furs.  O=
f course Marjorie wished to=20

go, and although it was an hour and a half before train time she put on her=
 coat and hat and the=20

two went out to frisk up and down the walk until the carriage came.  They w=
ent as far as the=20

seminary chapel, and seeing the door open Caro said, =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s=
 go in and look at Annette=E2=80=99s window.=E2=80=9D=20

Marjorie was willing and in they went. Some one from a distance was giving =
a course of Bible=20

lectures to the students in the chapel, and the one for that day was just o=
ver.  It was a small=20

building, beautifully proportioned and decorated; the somewhat somber richn=
ess of the interior=20

being relieved by the beautiful windows.  The children found it great fun t=
o walk about in perfect=20

freedom instead of being obliged to sit in sedate silence, and they forgot =
to think about the time.=20

They stood for a while before the window on which was represented the Good =
Shepherd freeing a=20

lamb from a thorn bush, and spelled out the words beneath it: =E2=80=9CIn m=
emoriam A. G.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI should like=20

to have a window,=E2=80=9D Caro said.  =E2=80=9CBut you can=E2=80=99t unles=
s you are dead,=E2=80=9D Marjorie answered.  Caro was=20

disposed to doubt this and would have begun to argue the question if the so=
und of a banging door=20



had not startled her. =E2=80=9CWhat was that Marjorie? I guess we=E2=80=99d=
 better go,=E2=80=9D she said.  Pushing open the=20

swinging door they went out into the vestibule, and there they found the ou=
tside door fast closed.=20

=E2=80=9COh Marjorie, it is shut tight, I can=E2=80=99t open it!=E2=80=9D C=
aro cried.  Marjorie tried in her turn, but it was of no=20

use, the janitor not knowing they were in the chapel had locked the door an=
d gone away.  =E2=80=9CWhat=20

shall we do? We shall be late to meet grandpa,=E2=80=9D wailed Caro.  Marjo=
rie began to pound on the=20

door and call, but this they soon realized could do no good. =E2=80=9CNobod=
y can hear us it is so thick,=E2=80=9D=20

she said, beginning to cry.  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t cry Marjorie; maybe Cli=
fford will come back again. But I=E2=80=99m afraid=20

we won=E2=80=99t get out in time to meet grandpa,=E2=80=9D Caro added with =
a little choke in her voice at the=20

thought.  =E2=80=9CClifford won=E2=80=99t be back till to-morrow I know,=E2=
=80=9D and Marjorie continued to sob.  =E2=80=9CBut they=E2=80=99ll=20

look for us, I know they will,=E2=80=9D Caro insisted.  It was dark and chi=
lly in the vestibule so they went=20

back into the chapel where the air was still warm. Even here the light was =
dim, for the short=20

afternoon was nearly over. The shadows looked so dark in the corners that M=
arjorie exclaimed,=20

=E2=80=9COh Caro I=E2=80=99m afraid!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t thi=
nk anything can happen to us, and they will find us pretty soon I=E2=80=99m=
=20

sure,=E2=80=9D said Caro encouragingly, although she couldn=E2=80=99t help =
thinking how very dark it would be after=20

a while.  =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll starve! I am hungry now,=E2=80=9D Marjorie=
 said tearfully.  There was nothing to do but wait.=20

They sat down in the seat usually occupied by Aunt Charlotte when they went=
 to afternoon service=20

with her, two very forlorn little girls. Suddenly Marjorie flung herself do=
wn on the cushions and=20

began to cry and sob wildly. Caro=E2=80=99s tears fell more quietly, and af=
ter a time she wiped them from=20

her eyes and looked up at the window. In the fading light she could just se=
e the gentle, tender=20

smile of the Good Shepherd as he rescued the lamb. It comforted her, and wh=
en Marjorie=E2=80=99s=20

passion of crying had exhausted itself, she said softly =E2=80=9CMarjorie l=
ook at the Good Shepherd!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is=20

too dark to see.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMarjorie let=E2=80=99s ask him to send =
someone to find us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D Marjorie agreed.=20

=E2=80=9CAnd soon,=E2=80=9D Caro added, =E2=80=9CAnd to help us not to be a=
fraid.=E2=80=9D  In the dusk two little figures knelt, two=20

little heads were bowed on the cushions. When Caro lifted hers she thought =
something wonderful=20

had happened, for there was the Shepherd smiling down on them just as if he=
 were about to=20

speak. It was the electric light on the campus which had shone out while th=
eir eyes were closed,=20

and made it seem almost like day.  =E2=80=9CWe needn=E2=80=99t be afraid no=
w Marjorie,=E2=80=9D Caro said calling her=20

attention to it. =E2=80=9CBut I do hope it won=E2=80=99t be very long, for =
I want so to see grandpa.=E2=80=9D  At that moment=20

Dr. Barrows was wanting very much to see his little girl. When he stepped f=
rom his carriage=20

expecting to hear her merry voice, and to see her flying to him, there was =
only his sister standing=20

in the door with an anxious face, greeting him with: =E2=80=9CThe children =
have disappeared Charles, and=20

can=E2=80=99t be found!=E2=80=9D  After a few questions the president hurri=
ed over to his brother=E2=80=99s, vague stories of=20

kidnappers floating through his brain. It seemed strange indeed that two li=
ttle girls could disappear=20

so completely in so short a time, leaving no clew to their whereabouts.  Th=
e whole neighborhood=20

was presently aroused, and professors and students might be seen running in=
 every direction. Just=20

how soon it would have occurred to anybody to look in the chapel it is impo=
ssible to say, but it so=20

happened that Dr. Smith the lecturer was to leave town that evening, and in=
 putting his papers=20

together he missed some valuable notes which he thought must have been left=
 on the desk in the=20

chapel. The janitor was sent for, and in half an hour after the electric li=
ght shone out, the children,=20

as well as the manuscript, were found.  =E2=80=9CIt is so nice to be found!=
=E2=80=9D Caro said, with her arms=20

clasped about her grandfather=E2=80=99s neck; =E2=80=9Cbut I truly wasn=E2=
=80=99t afraid after the light came, for the Good=20

Shepherd looked so kind.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER X  OLD FRIENDS   =E2=80=9CThe=
re is one thing I don=E2=80=99t=20



understand,=E2=80=9D remarked Aunt Charlotte at the breakfast table, =E2=80=
=9Cand that is how one of the Grayson=20

servants happened to come over here to ask about the children yesterday.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was Thompson, I=20

guess,=E2=80=9D said Caro who was eating her oatmeal, stopping every other =
minute to smile at her=20

grandfather.  =E2=80=9CWho is Thompson?=E2=80=9D he asked.  =E2=80=9CHe is =
the one who takes care of Walter, and he is=20

very nice. Why grandpa, he is almost as good as Kellar; he can do all sorts=
 of sleight-of-hand=20

tricks!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut how do you know anything about him or Walter=
 either?=E2=80=9D asked Aunt Charlotte.  Then=20

Caro remembered that she had not told anyone about all that had gone on in =
the garden, and she=20

couldn=E2=80=99t think where to begin.  =E2=80=9CCan=E2=80=99t you answer y=
our aunt,=E2=80=9D said her grandfather.  =E2=80=9CWhy yes--Aunt=20

Charlotte,--I know them,--I got acquainted with them a long time ago.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWith Walter Grayson?=20

Why no one ever sees him; you must be mistaken,=E2=80=9D Miss Barrows excla=
imed.  =E2=80=9CBut I _went_ to see=20

him,=E2=80=9D said Caro. =E2=80=9CIt wasn=E2=80=99t wrong, was it grandpa? =
You know you said to be a candle was to take a=20

little cheer to lonely people--and I was sure he must be lonely. I thought =
maybe he=E2=80=99d like to see=20

Trolley =E2=80=99cause he lived there once, so I took him. Do you think it =
was wrong?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy dear I don=E2=80=99t=20

know what to say--=E2=80=9D the president put down his knife and fork and l=
ooked at Aunt Charlotte, and=20

then at his granddaughter. =E2=80=9CYou mean to say you took the cat to see=
 Walter Grayson?=E2=80=9D  Caro=20

nodded; =E2=80=9CYes, grandpa.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d like to know =
what she=E2=80=99ll do next!=E2=80=9D cried Miss Barrows.  =E2=80=9CBut how=
 did=20

he treat you?=E2=80=9D questioned her grandfather. =E2=80=9CDid he tell you=
 you were an officious little girl?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think=20

he liked to see me, =E2=80=99cause after that we had a picnic.=E2=80=9D  In=
 the midst of these explanations a note=20

was brought in to the president. It read:    =E2=80=9CDear Dr. Barrows,--If=
 you can spare the time will you=20

not come to   see me within the next day or two? I am anxious to have a tal=
k with   you. If you have=20

forgotten the way Caro will come with you I am sure.=20


_
came round to the other side of the Storehouse.  When they caught sight of =
the fugitives in the=20

canoe, they quickly launched a swift pirogue and set out in pursuit of the =
canoe.  The Spaniards=20

had already doubled the point called Hraga and were a league down the river=
, but they were=20

exhausted with hard rowing and the light pirogue of their pursuers gained s=
o rapidly upon them=20

that their only hope was to take refuge in the thick underbrush along the s=
hore, where the Indians,=20

being naked, could not penetrate on account of the thorns.=20

=E2=80=9CWALTER GRAYSON.=E2=80=9D  Dr. Barrows read it aloud, and then look=
ed at his sister again.  =E2=80=9CGrandpa=20

he must think you are pretty stupid if you could forget that little way,=E2=
=80=9D Caro said laughing.  =E2=80=9CI fear I=20

am rather stupid sometimes,=E2=80=9D he said smiling; =E2=80=9CWell Pigeon =
we=E2=80=99ll go over there after lunch.=E2=80=9D  So it=20

came about that Caro and her grandfather hand in hand, went over to the Gra=
yson=E2=80=99s that=20

afternoon. Dr. Barrows still felt puzzled, and half believed he was dreamin=
g, but his granddaughter=20


_
the same time and not far from one another.  Fray Juan afterwards recounted=
 to Las Casas how=20

he was overtaken by an Indian and, seeing the club raised to strike him, he=
 threw himself on his=20

knees, closed his eyes, and prepared for death; the blow did not fall, and =
on opening his eyes he=20

found himself alone, with no Indian in sight.  Finding it impossible to rea=
ch the Spaniards in their=20

refuge in the thorny thicket, the Indians withdrew and the Christians, cove=
red with blood from their=20

many wounds, managed, though in a truly pitiable plight, to reach some boat=
s which were loading=20

salt not far off.  It was then noticed for the first time that their captai=
n, Francisco de Soto, was=20

missing and, as some one remembered having seen him concealed under a great=
 rock in the=20

thicket, a boat was sent to look for him.  After three days' search he was =
found, dying of thirst, and=20

on being brought on board and given water, he finished himself by drinking =
to excess.  Thus the=20

author of all the mischief paid the penalty of his imprudence and disobedie=
nce with his life.  While=20

the colonists were undergoing these sufferings, Las Casas found himself on =
board a vessel whose=20

pilots, ignorant of the chart, carried him eighty leagues beyond the harbou=
r of Hispaniola and=20

wasted two months in beating against the currents to pass the little island=
 La Beata.  Seeing the=20

hopeless incompetency of these men, he had himself put ashore at the harbou=
r of Jaquimo some=20

twenty leagues lower down, from whence he could go on to Jaguana and so acr=
oss the island to=20

the city of Santo Domingo.  The news of the disaster at Cumana had long sin=
ce reached=20

Hispaniola and Las Casas heard of it in the following manner, while journey=
ing on foot across the=20

island with several companions.  One day, while he was taking his afternoon=
 siesta under a tree, a=20

party of travellers joined his companions, who enquired what news there was=
 in Santo Domingo or=20

from Spain.  The newcomers answered that the only recent news was that of t=
he murder of the=20

clerigo Las Casas and all his colony at Cumana by the Indians.  "We are wit=
nesses to prove that=20

that is impossible" replied the others, and the discussion which ensued awa=
kened the clerigo who=20

thus received the disheartening tidings, which he was inclined to believe, =
of the total destruction of=20

his hopes.  He afterwards attributed this catastrophe to his own weakness i=
n allowing himself to be=20

drawn into a partnership with godless men, whose sole object was to enrich =
themselves, by which=20

he had offended God and merited punishment. He would have done better to ke=
ep to his original=20

plan of forming a religious company of Knights of the Golden Spur, who, aid=
ed by the friars, would=20

have embarked with him on the conversion of the natives without mingling an=
y expectation of=20

profitable trade with their project.  The struggle for immediate and inordi=
nate gain, in which the=20

Spanish colonists were engaged, with its slave raids, extermination of the =
Indians by selling them=20

alcoholic liquors and forcing them into the dangerous labours of mining and=
 pearl diving, was=20

incompatible with such a colony as Las Casas designed to found, and the agr=
eement into which=20

he entered with the Audiencia of Hispaniola was bound to wreck his projects=
.  Had the ability of=20

Las Casas to direct his undertaking and to govern men been equal to his gen=
ius in the sphere of=20

morals and intellect, and to the eloquence of his advocacy, the realisation=
 of his ideal of justice=20

and charity might have been assured.  Certainly he contended against overwh=
elming odds in=20

Spain, the Bishop of Burgos, who controlled American affairs, was implacabl=
y hostile; in America=20

the colonial authorities and the entire population barring the friars and a=
 possible handful of his=20

friends, were vigilantly opposed to him; deceived and betrayed by his Squir=
e Berrio, he was=20

disobeyed by De Soto and abandoned by his colonists, while all hope of esta=
blishing friendly=20

relations with the Indians in the territory conceded to him was annihilated=
 by the Spaniards at=20



Cubagua, whose aggressions kept the whole country in a state of alarm. Thes=
e untoward=20

conditions, which no foresight on his part could have avoided, were alone s=
ufficient to explain the=20

failure of his enterprise.  His plans seem, however, to have involved a con=
tradiction of a=20

fundamental law of human progress which decrees the destruction of rudiment=
ary forms of=20

civilisation when brought into contact with a higher one.  Neither humane c=
ivil legislation nor the=20

higher principles of Christian charity have thus far served to save the wea=
ker races of mankind=20

from absorption or extermination.  The fiercer and stronger tribes of Ameri=
can Indians receded=20

before the Anglo-Saxon invasion of their territories, leaving a trail of bl=
ood behind them, while the=20

weaker nations of the islands and Southern Americas went down before the Sp=
aniards, with hardly=20

more than a plaintive cry for mercy.  The price of civilisation is a high o=
ne, and as the peoples of=20

Europe paid it, so were the aboriginal populations of America not exempted =
from the blood-tax.=20

The obscure workings of the mysterious laws of race-survival were forced on=
 and hastened by the=20

cruelties against which Las Casas protested in vain, but the triumphal marc=
h of human progress=20

has followed on.  Cannibalism, idolatry, awake indeed. She quite hoped they=
 would see haughty=20

Miss Elizabeth again, for with her grandfather beside her she was ready to =
face anything.  The=20

lady however was not to be seen, and they found Walter alone in the library=
.  =E2=80=9CMy dear boy,=E2=80=9D was=20

all the president said as he grasped the hand stretched out to him.  =E2=80=
=9CThere=E2=80=99s not much left of me,=20

but what there is is very glad to see you,=E2=80=9D was Walter=E2=80=99s gr=
eeting.  It was well that Caro was there to=20

help out the conversation at first, her grandfather was kept so busy cleari=
ng his glasses. She was=20

as full of life as the gray squirrel she resembled.  =E2=80=9CDid you know =
we got lost yesterday?=E2=80=9D she=20

asked.  =E2=80=9CYes; though I didn=E2=80=99t hear it till you were found. =
What were you doing in the chapel?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=20

was open you know and so we went in to look at Annette=E2=80=99s window.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd weren=E2=80=99t you afraid when=20

you found the door shut?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, a little, when it began to=
 get dark--and Marjorie was too. I thought=20

it would be so _dreadfully_ dark after a while, and then the electric light=
 shone out, straight through=20

the window! We could see the Good Shepherd just as plain as day, and I wasn=
=E2=80=99t afraid any longer;=20

then pretty soon they found us.=E2=80=9D    =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98For sudden th=
e worst turns the best to the brave,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  Walter=20

quoted, smiling at Dr. Barrows.  =E2=80=9CParticularly when they are lookin=
g in the right direction,=E2=80=9D he=20

answered.  =E2=80=9CI suppose Caro has told you how we became acquainted,=
=E2=80=9D Walter said; =E2=80=9Cand I have=20

found it so pleasant to have a friend that I want more--I want my old frien=
ds again. I can=E2=80=99t be of any=20

use--=E2=80=9D he was silent for a minute, then went on, =E2=80=9CI asked y=
ou to come because I knew you could=20

help me. My sister has given her consent to anything I wish, but it is hard=
 for her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShe will be=20

happier in the end. She is too fine a woman to shut herself in--the world n=
eeds her,=E2=80=9D answered Dr.=20

Barrows.  =E2=80=9CShe _is_ good, nobody knows it so well as I,=E2=80=9D sa=
id Walter.  =E2=80=9CAnd now my boy anything I=20

can do I will do gladly,=E2=80=9D the president added.  =E2=80=9CIt is just=
 to let my friends know that I shall be glad to=20

see them, and that on our side all feeling about the old quarrel is put awa=
y. And=E2=80=9D he added almost=20

gaily, =E2=80=9CI think I shall get Caro to help me with a Christmas party.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA Christmas party here? how=20

lovely!=E2=80=9D she cried dancing up and down.  =E2=80=9CI should like to =
see the old house look really cheerful=20

again. Do you remember the parties we used to have when we were children, D=
r. Barrows?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo=20

you mean a tree, and Santa Claus?=E2=80=9D Caro asked coming to Walter=E2=
=80=99s side after whirling around the=20

room.  =E2=80=9CCertainly, and all the other things that belong to Christma=
s,=E2=80=9D was his reply.  Caro rather=20

changed her mind about Miss Elizabeth who met them in the hall as they were=
 leaving.  =E2=80=9CDr.=20

Barrows,=E2=80=9D she said holding out her hand, =E2=80=9CI know what Walte=
r has said to you--perhaps I have=20



been wrong--I don=E2=80=99t know, but I should never acknowledge it except =
for him--=E2=80=9D  The president=20

interrupted her, =E2=80=9CMy dear,=E2=80=9D--and Caro wondered how he could=
 call anyone so stately my dear,--

=E2=80=9Csay no more. Let us simply forget that anything ever came between =
us.=E2=80=9D  And then Miss Elizabeth=20

turned to Caro and took her hand; =E2=80=9CThis is your granddaughter, Elin=
or=E2=80=99s child,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9CI hope=20

she will come often to see my brother, he has taken a great fancy to her.=
=E2=80=9D  When they reached=20

home Aunt Charlotte met them with a letter in her hand. =E2=80=9CWhat do yo=
u think? Elinor writes that she=20

will probably spend Christmas with us!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs mamma coming? =
How perfectly lovely! Oh grandpa=20

aren=E2=80=99t you glad?=E2=80=9D Caro was so full of delight she could har=
dly listen to her mother=E2=80=99s letter in which=20

Mrs. Holland said that as they could not get their family together at home,=
 she would come to=20

spend the holidays at her father=E2=80=99s with Caro, while Mr. Holland joi=
ned the boys.  =E2=80=9CI believe it is=20

going to be the best Christmas that ever happened,=E2=80=9D Caro exclaimed.=
  The weeks before=20

Christmas were merry ones. As if to make up for his delay winter came in ea=
rnest with a heavy=20

snow followed by freezing weather, which made endless fun for the children.=
 To Caro snow that=20

lay on the ground for any length of time was a delightful novelty, and she =
wanted to be out from=20

morning till night.  The cold kept Walter Grayson housed for the greater pa=
rt of the time but he was=20

enlivened by frequent visits from the children. For his benefit they built =
a remarkable snow man on=20

the lawn outside the library windows and Miss Elizabeth said not a word, al=
though her order-loving=20

eyes found the grotesque object almost painful. It amused Walter, and so sh=
e could endure it.  He=20

and Caro spent hours over plans for the Christmas party, to which his siste=
r had offered no=20

objection, but she asked no questions and shrank from having anything to do=
 with it.  The days=20

flew by as they always do at this time of year, with so much to prepare for=
 and look forward to.=20

=E2=80=9CTrolley,=E2=80=9D Caro said one evening, =E2=80=9CI am sorry for y=
ou, because you don=E2=80=99t know what fun Christmas=20

is. Just think! Mamma is coming to-morrow, and Charlie and Alice, and we ar=
e going to have the=20

best time!=E2=80=9D  Trolley only purred contentedly. All days were alike t=
o him, if he had plenty to eat and=20

a comfortable nap, and the society of his friends.     CHAPTER XI  CHRISTMA=
S CANDLES   The=20

sunlight fell softly through Annette=E2=80=99s window and across the readin=
g desk as Dr. Barrows began=20

the afternoon service in the chapel=20


_
from the American continents; the Christian religion has replaced degrading=
 superstitions,=20

agriculture and commerce flourish, while literature and the arts adorn life=
 in the several republics,=20

whose meanest citizen enjoys a security of life and property unknown to the=
 proudest of their=20

ancestors under the rule of Montezuma or the Incas. Belief in the principle=
s of equity and charity=20

forbids us to doubt that these and even nobler results might have been achi=
eved by the methods=20

advocated by Las Casas, but history records no racial expansion along other=
 roads than that=20

opened by the sword.      CHAPTER XIII. - PROFESSION OF LAS CASAS.  THE CAC=
IQUE cedar=20

and pine, and against the dark oak wainscoting the holly berries shone warm=
 and bright, as he=20

read: =E2=80=9CThe glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, and=
 the pine tree, and the box=20

together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary.=E2=80=9D  Caro sat with he=
r hand clasped in her mother=E2=80=99s,=20

the happiness of Christmas shining in her face; across the aisle was Marjor=
ie with Charlie and=20

Alice.  Just as the president began to read, the door opened and Thompson s=
wiftly and noiselessly=20

wheeled his master to a place at one side of the pulpit, and withdrew. Caro=
 thought Walter must=20

be lonely there by himself, so after a moment=E2=80=99s hesitation, with a=
=20


_
LAS CASAS. A PEACEFUL VICTORY   Although held in general detestation in His=
paniola, as a=20

seditious mischief-maker and an enemy of the Spaniards' interests, there we=
re not wanting some=20

sympathisers who, when Las Casas arrived, dejected and bankrupt, at Santo D=
omingo, received=20

him kindly, and even offered to lend him five thousand ducats with which to=
 begin again.  The clear=20

thinking and high resolution which had carried him through so many trials s=
eemed at this time to=20

fail him; nor indeed is there just cause for wonder, for there is a limit t=
o human powers of=20

endurance, and if ever a man was overtaken by a dark hour, Las Casas was he=
.  In after years, he=20

arraigned his own conduct at this period with undue severity, reflecting th=
at as the Emperor was=20

back in Spain with the Flemings, and his old friend Cardinal Adrian had bec=
ome Pope, he might=20

have accomplished his hand from her mother=E2=80=99s and stole softly up to=
 the front seat close to the=20

invalid.  Miss Elizabeth saw her from the back of the chapel where she sat,=
 and tears came to her=20

eyes. She had not wanted her brother to come, and now here was this child t=
aking the place that=20

should have been hers.  When her grandfather read his text Caro looked up a=
t Walter and smiled;=20

it seemed meant for them she thought.  =E2=80=9CTo give light to them that =
sit in darkness.=E2=80=9D  It is to be=20

doubted if the president ever preached a better sermon, and yet it was only=
 a simple little talk that=20

the children could understand, about the Light-bringer whose love could pen=
etrate the darkest=20

clouds of sin or sorrow, and whose followers must in their turn become ligh=
t-bearers.  Caro=20

listened, looking up at the Good Shepherd, who again seemed to smile on her=
. But after they had=20

sung, =E2=80=9CIt came upon the=20


_
adopted the resolution of going directly to Spain.  As it was, he wrote an =
extensive account to the=20

Emperor of all that had occurred and the causes that had brought on the cal=
amity at Cumana.  To=20

the monks of the Dominican order, Las Casas had years since been united by =
the strong bonds of=20

devotion to a common cause, which was the dominant influence, as it was the=
 sole object, of his=20

life. As they had accompanied and sustained him throughout his long struggl=
e, so it was to them=20

that he naturally turned for sympathy in the extremity of his disappointmen=
t, exiled, as he was,=20

amidst the hostile colonists of Hispaniola.  These were the saddest days of=
 his tempestuous life,=20

during which doubts began to penetrate his very soul--doubts of his own wor=
thiness to carry on the=20

mission to which he had believed himself called, doubts even as to whether =
it might not be=20

ordained by the inscrutable wisdom of Divine Providence that the Indians sh=
ould perish before the=20

advance of the Spaniards.  If this were true, then his life had been wasted=
 in a vain conflict with=20

the occult forces that govern the destiny of races.  While waiting for answ=
ers to the letters he had=20

written to Spain, he found his only consolation in his intercourse with the=
 Dominican friars, with=20

whom in fact he had been for years closely united in spirit.  Fray Domingo =
de Betanzos exercised=20

a great influence upon him at this time, and to him is due the decision of =
Las Casas to enter the=20

Dominican Order.  The discussions between the two must have been frequent a=
nd prolonged for,=20

weary and disappointed as he was, Las Casas seems not to have yearned for t=
he seclusion of the=20

cloister. To his objection that he must await the King's reply to his lette=
r before taking a decision,=20

Betanzos answered, "Decide now father, for if you were to die meanwhile, wh=
o will receive the=20

King's letters and orders?"  These words sunk deep into his soul and from t=
hence-forward he=20

pondered seriously upon his vocation.  Finally his mind was made up and he =
decided to imagine=20

himself dead when the King's letter should arrive and so beyond the reach o=
f royal commands.  In=20

1522, he asked for the habit of the Order. (39) The news of his solemn prof=
ession, which took=20

place in 1523, was received with great joy by the people outside the conven=
t, though for very=20

different reasons, for they assisted at his exit from the world and his ent=
rance into the cloister with=20

the same satisfaction with which they would have attended his funeral.  Whi=
le making his novitiate,=20

the letters from the Cardinal (now Pope) Adrian and his Flemish friends at =
Court arrived.  The=20

Flemings urged his immediate return to Spain, promising him every assistanc=
e in their power, but=20

the superiors of the monastery in Hispaniola did not deliver these disquiet=
ing epistles to their=20

novice, for fear of shaking his resolution to persevere in his vocation.  T=
he earliest biographer of=20

Las Casas, Antonio de Remesal, says that he was chosen Prior of the monaste=
ry, and this=20

statement is supported by a letter from the Auditors of Hispaniola dated Ju=
ne 7, 1533, addressed=20

to Prince Philip who was governing Spain clear=E2=80=9D--and the benedictio=
n had been pronounced, the=20

merry side of Christmas became uppermost. There was Charlie exclaiming, =E2=
=80=9CWalter old fellow I am=20

so glad to see you!=E2=80=9D and shaking hands warmly, and Alice and Mrs. H=
olland with quieter greetings.=20

Marjorie and Tom of course joined Caro, and the president came down and add=
ed one more to the=20

group around Walter.  At the door Miss Elizabeth waited, unable to escape a=
ltogether the friendly=20

greetings, trying not to be impatient, while near her stood Thompson with a=
 beaming face. This=20

was something like living he thought.  There is something about Christmas e=
ve which makes it=20

different from all other evenings. There is a thrill of expectancy in the a=
ir that no one can quite=20

escape, even though his head is grey. Caro and Marjorie skipped down the st=
one walk in the=20

frosty air, hand in hand, brimful of happiness; Charlie and Alice were besi=
de Walter, and Dr.=20



Barrows who walked with Miss Elizabeth thought his little granddaughter was=
 right when she said=20

this was going to be the best Christmas that ever happened.  =E2=80=9CRemem=
ber,=E2=80=9D said Walter, as they=20

were separating, =E2=80=9Cthat I depend on you to-morrow to make my party a=
 success. It is to be as much=20

like old times as possible.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll be on hand and=
 do our best,=E2=80=9D said Charlie. =E2=80=9CPoor fellow! what a=20

change from four years ago,=E2=80=9D he added to his sister.  =E2=80=9CAnd =
yet I can=E2=80=99t quite pity him. It must be=20

because he is so brave,=E2=80=9D Alice answered.  =E2=80=9CAnd Bess, you wi=
ll wear your prettiest gown, won=E2=80=99t=20

you?=E2=80=9D Walter had said coaxingly.  =E2=80=9CYou know I don=E2=80=99t=
 care for such things any more,=E2=80=9D Miss Elizabeth=20

urged.  =E2=80=9CBut you must. I want you to look like a queen,=E2=80=9D he=
 insisted, and so when the Barrows=20

arrived next evening they found their hostess in creamy satin and costly la=
ce, with diamonds on=20

her breast and in her dark hair. At sight of her Caro clasped her hands and=
 cried, =E2=80=9COh Miss=20

Elizabeth you are perfectly beautiful!=E2=80=9D  Her admiration was so evid=
ently genuine that the lady could=20

not help being pleased, and she stooped and kissed the rosy cheek.  =E2=80=
=9CAnd how do you think we=20

came?=E2=80=9D asked Marjorie, dancing around till the blue bows on her fla=
xen braids danced too.  =E2=80=9COh,=20

yes, I forgot to tell you,=E2=80=9D cried Caro, running to Walter=E2=80=99s=
 side, =E2=80=9CWe came through the gate,--Charlie=20

opened it, the gate in the orchard. We shan=E2=80=99t have to climb the fen=
ce any more.=E2=80=9D  The invitations=20

read =E2=80=9CTo meet Miss Caro Holland=E2=80=9D and Caro in her fluffy whi=
te dress with a spray of holly on her=20

shoulders stood beside Miss Elizabeth and Walter and helped receive the gue=
sts. The spacious=20

house was all thrown open, brilliantly lighted and beautiful in its Christm=
as decorations, for neither=20

trouble nor expense had been considered.  It was first of all a children=E2=
=80=99s party as every Christmas=20

party should be, but there were almost as many grown people asked besides, =
to enjoy the=20

children=E2=80=99s pleasure. Aunt Charlotte was there in her black velvet g=
own, and Mrs. Rice in her=20

wedding dress,--everybody in fact looked their best.  Miss Elizabeth hardly=
 knew herself with=20

flowers and music and happy faces all about her, she almost forgot the pain=
 at her heart, and her=20

brother=E2=80=99s=20


_
father, in which Fray Bartholomew is mentioned as Prior of the Monastery of=
 Santo Domingo in the=20

town of Puerto de Plata. (40) In chapter 146 of his _Historia Apologetica_,=
 he himself speaks of=20

"conferring the habit" on a novice, which he could only do if he were Prior=
.  The first seven years=20

that Las Casas passed in the seclusion of his monastery were not marked by =
any salient incident.=20

He devoted himself with all the intensity of his nature to the practice of =
the austere rule of St.=20

Dominic and became, as he himself afterwards described in writing of that  =
The tree which was in=20

the library was a most beautiful sight when the lights were turned down in =
the other rooms and the=20

doors thrown open. The floor appeared to be covered with snow, and the tree=
 was all in white and=20

silver, blazing with candles.  After it had been sufficiently admired, Sant=
a Claus came on the scene=20

with a generous pack from which he distributed the most interesting white p=
arcels tied with red=20

ribbons. One of these which had on it =E2=80=9CFor Trolley, in care of Caro=

a collar on which was a silver plate with his=20
