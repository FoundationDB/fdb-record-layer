The duke was ill pleased with their refusal, and resolved, with the advice =
of his council, to constrain them to it by force. He sought for men at arms=
 every where; and there came to him his brother, the count de Nevers, the c=

ordinary precautions that should obtain in all researches on identity of th=

rtainly be suggested as the perpetrator of such a deed as that of the woman=
 already mentioned, who after killing and cutting up her _
Pieruels, the Liegeois had rebelled against John of Bavaria[104], and chose=
n a new lord.  Their=20

late bishop was much angered at their conduct, and had his town of Bouillon=
, and other castles,=20

well stored with every sort of warlike provision, that he might thence carr=
y on a war against the=20

country of Liege.  He then went to his brother duke William, in Hainault, t=
o obtain his assistance=20

and men at arms. In the mean time, the Liegeois assembled in great force, a=
nd marched to the=20

town of Bouillon, which, with the castle, they took by storm, and put to de=
ath all they found therein.=20

John of Bavaria shortly after entered the country of Liege, near to Thuin, =
with four hundred=20

combatants, and burnt many towns and houses, carrying away a very great boo=
ty to Hainault.=20

The Liegeois soon after entered Hainault with a considerable army, where th=
ey destroyed the=20

tower of Morialines, and burnt the town. They thence marched to Braban=C3=
=A7on, and other places=20

belonging to such knights and esquires as had invaded their country, which =
they plundered, and in=20

many places burnt, wasting the country with fire and sword.  The Hainaulter=
s assembled to=20

repulse them; but the enemy were in such superior numbers that they returne=
d back, without=20

effecting any thing worth relating. War now raged between them,=E2=80=94and=
 each fortified their towns=20

as strongly as they could.  The Liegeois sent ambassadors to the pope, to l=
ay before him the=20

conduct of John of Bavaria, and his refusal to take orders according to his=
 promise, requesting that=20

he might be ejected by the apostolical authority, and that the son of the l=
ord de Pieruels, whom=20

they had elected, might be admitted in his room.  The pope could not accede=
 to their request,=20

because he had been faithfully informed that the Liegeois, after mature del=
iberation, had fixed on a=20

day for John of Bavaria to take orders, and that this day was not as yet pa=
ssed.  The=20

ambassadors, therefore, returned to Liege, without having done any thing. T=
hose who had sent=20

them were very indignant at pope Gregory for not complying with their deman=
ds, and resolved to=20

send another embassy to his rival pope Benedict. This pope received them mo=
st graciously,=20

granted all their demands, and gave them his bulls for the confirmation of =
them. They returned=20

home greatly rejoiced at the successful issue of their negotiation.        =

such a way as to establish with great certainty both the present and future=
 identity of individuals=20

who attempt dissimulation of their name and antecedents. The method used pr=
incipally in the=20

identification of criminals and deserters from the army has been adopted in=
 the public service[599]=20

and by most municipalities, with the exception of New York, where the subse=
quent identification of=20

persons connected with municipal affairs has been and may be a source of no=
 little=20

embarrassment.  The system is based on three recognitory elements: photogra=
phy,=20

anthropometric measurements, and personal markings, from which a descriptiv=
e list is made that=20

gives absolute certainty as to individual identity.  Owing to the illusory =
nature of photography and=20

the difficulty in finding the portrait of any given individual in the large=
 and constantly increasing=20

collection of a =E2=80=9Crogues=E2=80=99 gallery,=E2=80=9D the matter has b=
een simplified and facilitated by grouping the=20

photographic collection according to the six anthropological coefficients o=
f sex, stature, age, and=20

color of the eyes. Each of these primordial groups is again subdivided in s=
uch a way as to reduce=20

the last group to a small number, when the portrait is easily found and ver=
ified on comparing the=20

measurements of the head, of the extended arms, the length of the left foot=
, and that of the left=20

middle finger.  The photographic proof for each individual consists of two =
portraits side by side,=20

one of which is taken full face, the other in profile of the _right_ side. =
On the back of the=20

photographic card is recorded with rigorous precision all personal markings=
 or peculiarities.  The=20



measurements, which can be made by any person of average intelligence in th=
ree or four minutes,=20

are extremely simple. The _right_ ear is always measured, for the reason th=
at this organ is always=20

reproduced in the traditional photograph which represents the right face. O=
ther special=20

measurements are taken on the left side. The height sitting, dimensions and=
 character of the nose,=20

color of eyes, etc., are also noted.  It is contended that by these measure=
ments alone the identity=20

of an individual whose face is not even known may be established in another=
 country by telegraph.=20

The application of the system has proved of great service in the apprehensi=
on of deserters from=20

ANTHONY DUKE OF LIMBOURG TAKES POSSESSION OF THAT DUCHY, AND=20

AFTERWARD OF THE TOWN OF MAESTRICHT, TO THE GREAT         DISPLEASURE OF TH=
E=20

LIEGEOIS.   Anthony duke of Limbourg, brother to John duke of Burgundy, aft=
er the death of the=20

duchess of Brabant, succeeded to that duchy, and claimed to have caused the=
 disappearance of=20

numerous dissimulators of identity in the prisons of Paris. The police auth=
orities of that city report=20

that out of more than five hundred annual recognitions by the foregoing mea=
ns, not one mistake=20

has yet occurred.[600]  To avoid a _possible source=20


_
dependancies. All the Brabanters, clergy and nobles, did him homage, promis=
ing him obedience=20

as their lawful lord, except the town of Maestricht. When he had taken poss=
ession of this duchy,=20

he surrendered, with the consent of the duke of Burgundy, the county of Ret=
hel to his younger=20

brother, Philip count de Nevers, thus accomplishing the last orders of his =
father and mother.  As=20

the town of Maestricht was divided between the governments of Brabant and L=

belonging to each, the inhabitants said they were bound only ascertainment =
of their form may be=20

mutilated or burned by the assassin in order to prevent recognition. A suff=
icient number of cases=20

may be cited in which the measurement of a limb or a bone of a deceased per=
son known to have=20

been lame or deformed during life has resulted in the establishment of iden=
tity or the reverse.  A=20
