The Pillars in the day news arrived of the escape of Garibaldi from Caprera=
; he was said to be marching on the city, and only five-and-twenty miles di=
stant. There appeared another proclamation from the Revolutionary Committee=
, mysteriously posted under the very noses of the _
Atbara, which join the main stream respectively in N. lat. 15 degrees 30 mi=
nutes and 17 degrees=20

37 minutes. These rivers, although streams of extreme grandeur during the p=
eriod of the=20

Abyssinian rains, from the middle of June until September, are reduced duri=
ng the dry months to=20

utter insignificance; the Blue Nile becoming so shallow as to be unnavigabl=
e, and the Atbara=20

perfectly dry. At that time the water supply of Abyssinia having ceased, Eg=
ypt depends solely upon=20

the equatorial lakes and the affluents of the White Nile, until the rainy s=
eason shall again have=20

flooded the two great Abyssinian arteries. That flood occurs suddenly about=
 the 20th of June, and=20

the grand rush of water pouring down the Blue Nile and the Atbara into the =
parent channel,=20

inundates Lower Egypt, and is the cause of its extreme fertility.  Not only=
 is the inundation the=20

effect of the Abyssinian rains, but the deposit of mud that has formed the =
Delta, and which is=20

annually precipitated by the rising waters, is also due to the Abyssinian s=
treams, more especially=20

to the river Atbara, which, known as the Bahr el Aswat (Black River), carri=
es a larger proportion of=20

soil than any other tributary of the Nile; therefore, to the Atbara, above =
all other rivers, must the=20

wealth and fertility of Egypt be attributed.  It may thus be stated: The eq=
uatorial lakes FEED Egypt;=20

but the Abyssinian rivers CAUSE THE INUNDATION.  This being a concise summa=
ry of the Nile=20

system, I shall describe twelve months' exploration, during which I examine=
d every individual river=20

that is tributary to the Nile from Abyssinia, including the Atbara, Settite=
, Royan, Salaam, Angrab,=20

was a November day in Rome, and the sky was as gloomy as the heaven of Lond=
on. The wind=20

moaned through the silent streets, deserted except by soldiers. The shops w=
ere shut, not a civilian=20

or a priest could be seen. The Corso was occupied by the Swiss Guard and Zo=
uaves, with artillery=20

ready to sweep it at a moment=E2=80=99s notice. Six of the city gates were =
shut and barricaded with barrels=20

full of earth. Troops and artillery were also posted in several of the prin=
cipal piazzas, and on some=20

commanding heights, and St. Peter=E2=80=99s itself was garrisoned.  And yet=
 these were the arrangements=20

rather of panic than precaution. The utmost dismay pervaded the council-cha=

 the Nile tributaries of=20

Abyssinia occupied the first twelve months of my journey towards the Nile s=
