hours after death produced blisters containing no serum.  Caspar[716] state=

the Japs have a prison camp there, where our men are starving and dying. We=

 It must be remembered=20

that a burn inflicted in a condition of great depression of the vital power=
s with insensibility may be=20

followed by no vesication or redness, but upon reaction and return of sensa=
tion both redness and=20

blisters may appear (Case 17). In the absence of blisters, therefore, it ca=
nnot be decided that for=20

this reason the burn was post mortem. If from a blister formed on the livin=
g body the cuticle be=20

carefully removed, the site of the blister will present an intensely redden=
ed base. In the dead body,=20

Some thirty planes were still on the field.  Breaking formation, the "four =
horsemen" zoomed in=20

upon the planes and the racing pilots. With machine-gun fire they sent the =
Japs scurrying for=20

decide the possibility of producing blisters post mortem.  Leuret,[711] in =
experiments upon=20

Champouillon[713] agrees with Leuret in his conclusions, from experiments u=
