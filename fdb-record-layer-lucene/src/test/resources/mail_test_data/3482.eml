 unable to read, took one=20

of the empty dynamite boxes in which to pack Mary's present. That's how it =
happened."  Tom=20

thought for a moment. Then he burst into a laugh.  "That's it," he said, a =
bit ruefully. "That's the=20

explanation. No wonder Mr. Nestor was roiled. He thought I was playing a jo=
ke. I'll have to explain.=20

But how?"  "By letter," said Mr. Damon.  "Too slow. I'll send a wireless," =
decided Tom, and he=20

began the composition of a message that cost him considerable in tolls befo=
re he had hit on the=20

explanation that suited him.  "That ought to clear the atmosphere," he said=
 when the wireless had=20

shot his message into the ether. "Whew!  And to think, all this while, Mary=
 and her folks have=20

believed that I tried to play a miserable joke on them! My! My! I wonder if=
 they'll ever forgive me.=20

When I get hold of Eradicate--"  "Better teach him to read if he's going to=
 do up love packages,"=20

interrupted Mr. Damon, dryly.  "I will," decided the young inventor.  The B=
ellaconda stopped at=20

Panama and then kept on her way south. Soon after that she ran into a of Wa=
ters, which is divided=20

into three channels.  La Salle, in his canoe, entered one, Tonti the second=
, and Captain d'Autray=20

the third. All disembarked, and on some high, dry ground La Salle caused a =
column to be raised,=20

and upon it this inscription was placed:    LOUIS THE GREAT,   King of Fran=
ce   and of Navarre,=20

reigns.   The ninth of April 1682.  La Salle took possession of the country=
 for the King, and=20

bestowed upon it the name, in his honour, of {112} Louisiana.  It took the =
explorers a full year to=20

get back to Quebec, for the current was strong and the difficulties many.  =
There he received a=20

warm reception.  But nothing could console him.  Much to his sorrow and dis=
may, he found a new=20

Governor installed.  The enemies of Frontenac, headed by Laval, had triumph=
ed, and the greatest=20

and strongest man in Canada had been recalled by the King.  Never could thi=
s measure have=20

happened at a worse time.  For, while La Salle had been absent, after years=
 of peace, the restless=20

Iroquois had dug up the war-hatchet. Upon a pretext of having received offe=
nce from the Illinois=20

tribe, which was under French protection, they threatened=20


_
was some excitement among the passengers. The more timid of them put on lif=
e preservers,=20

though the captain and his officers assured them there was no danger.  Tom =
and Mr. Titus,=20

descending from the deck, whence they had been warned by one of the mates, =
were on their way=20

to their stateroom, walking with some difficulty owing to the roll of the s=
hip.  As they approached=20

their quarters the door of a stateroom farther up the passage opened, and a=
 head was thrust out.=20

"Will you send a steward to me?" a man requested. "I am feeling very ill, a=
nd need assistance."=20

"Certainly," Tom answered, and at that moment he heard Mr. Titus utter an e=
xclamation.  "What is=20

it?" asked Tom, for the man who had appealed for help, had withdrawn his he=
ad.  "That--that=20

man!" exclaimed the contractor. "That was Waddington, the tool of our rival=
s."  "Waddington!"=20

repeated Tom, with a look at the now closed door. "Why, the bearded man has=
 that stateroom--the=20

bearded man who so nearly lost the steamer. He isn't Waddington!"  "And I t=
ell you Waddington is=20

in that room!" insisted the contractor. "I only saw the upper part of his f=
ace, but I'd know his eyes=20

anywhere. Waddington is spying on us!"     Chapter IX  The Bomb   Tom Swift=
 and Mr. Titus=20

withdrew a little way down the corridor, around a bulkhead and out of sight=
 of any one who might=20

look out from the stateroom whence had come the appeal for help. But, at th=
e same time, they=20

could keep watch over it.  "I tell you Waddington is in there!" insisted Mr=
. Titus, hoarsely=20

whispering.  "Well, perhaps he may be," admitted Tom. "But several times I =
have seen the=20

bearded man going in there, and it's only a single stateroom, for it's so m=
arked on the deck plan."=20

"Waddington might be disguised with a false beard, Tom."  "Yes, he might. B=
ut did the man who=20

just now looked out have a beard?"  "I couldn't tell, as I saw only the upp=
er part of his face. But=20

those were in blood.  To this policy they had been urged by the English Gov=
ernor of New York,=20

Colonel Dongan, who saw with alarm the growing enterprise, both in fur trad=
e and exploration of=20

the French.  While he continued in Canada the doughty Frontenac was more th=
an a match for the=20

Iroquois chiefs.  He sent for them instantly to Fort Frontenac, saying that=
 if they had been wronged=20

by the Illinois he would see that they had proper satisfaction.  The Iroquo=
is, having the English=20

Governor at their back, at first returned a defiant answer.  "If you want t=
o see us, friend Onontio,"=20

they said, "you must come to our lodges."  With flashing eyes and with knit=
ted brows, Frontenac=20

sent back the messenger to the Iroquois commanding them to keep their hands=
 off his Indians or=20

take all consequences.  He had, he said, asked them to come and meet him at=
 Fort Frontenac.=20

Now he added, if the Iroquois wished {113} to see him, they would have to c=
ome to Montreal.  His=20

sternness and the fear of his displeasure overcame the braves of the Five N=
ations.  Changing their=20

tone, they sent an embassy to Montreal, promising the peace which they hate=
d. Scarcely had they=20

done so than Frontenac the Lion was replaced by La Barre, the Lamb.  Like e=
very one else, La=20

Salle, on learning the evil news, saw the folly and danger of the change.  =
To France straightway=20

he sailed, where the King heaped him with honours, and, seizing the opportu=
nity, he unfolded a=20

project for establishing a French colony in Louisiana. Ships were freely gi=
ven him and many=20

soldiers and supplies to reach the Gulf of Mexico by sea.  But La Salle, th=
ough he never would=20

admit the fact, was no sailor.  His navigation was fatally at fault; he who=
lly missed his intended=20

destination, the mouth of the Mississippi, sailing hundreds of miles beyond=
.  He landed, and=20

through the forests and swamps, and stricken with fever, he led his colonis=
ts.  After much=20

miserable=20


_
"If Waddington were on board don't you suppose you would have seen him befo=
re this?"  "Not=20

positively, no. If he and the bearded man are one and the same that would a=
ccount for it. But I=20

haven't noticed the bearded man once since he came aboard in such a hurry."=
  "Nor have I, now=20

that I come to think of it," Tom admitted. "However, there is an easy way t=
o prove who is in there."=20

"How?"  "We'll knock on the door and go in."  "Perhaps he won't let us."  "=
He'll think it's the=20

steward he called for. Come, you know Waddington better than I do. You knoc=
k and go in."  "I=20

don't know Waddington very well," admitted the contractor. "I have only see=
n him a few times, but=20

I am sure that was he. But what shall I do when he sees I'm not the his fol=
lowers mutinied.  La=20

Salle was murdered and his corpse flung to the jackals and vultures.  Far m=
ore successful were=20

the adventures of the Chevalier de Troyes. The Chevalier de Troyes was a Ca=
nadian nobleman=20

who had long fought for his king, and had seen service on many of the blood=
y battlefields in=20

Europe.  Now, when age began to creep upon him, and scars lined his cheek a=
nd brow, he had=20

retired to his estate on the banks of the silvery St. Lawrence, to spend th=
e rest of his days {114} in=20

peace and the companionship of his books.  In his retirement the news of th=
e increasing power=20

and wealth of the Hudson's Bay Company reached him; it told him that unless=
 this power was=20

checked the prosperity of the French fur-hunters and=20


_
"Tell him you have sent for one. I'll go with the message, so it will be tr=
ue enough. Even if you=20

have only a momentary glance at him in close quarters you ought to be able =
to tell whether or not=20

he has on a false beard, and whether or not it is idea flashed across the b=
rain of the Chevalier de=20

Troyes, who believed he now saw an opportunity of winning enduring distinct=

be surpass, the exploits of Champlain, La Salle, and the other hero-pioneer=
s of New France.  In=20

the=20


_
Mr. Titus considered for a moment, and then he said:  "Yes, I guess that is=
 a good plan. You go for=20

the steward, Tom, and I'll see if I can get in that stateroom. But I'm sure=
 I'm not mistaken. I'll find=20

Waddington in there, perhaps in the person of the bearded man, disguised. O=
r else they are using=20

a single stateroom as a double one." And while Tom went off down the pitchi=
ng and rolling corridor=20

to find a steward, Mr. Titus, not without some apprehension, advanced to kn=
ock on the door of the=20

suspect.  "If it is his eloquence could attract, locked up his library, and=
 set out for Quebec on=20

snow-shoes.  From the Governor he procured, on Christmas Eve 1685, official=
 permission to steal=20

upon the English and drive them, at the point of the sword, from the shores=
 of Hudson's Bay.  He=20

was empowered to "search for, seize, and occupy the most advantageous posts=
, to seize the=20
