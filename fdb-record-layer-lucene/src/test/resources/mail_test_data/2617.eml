 word, and without listening to further protests from Martin-Roget or Chauv=

What course does the Cree chief advise?"  "Okematan advises that the kettle=
 be boiled, the duck roasted, and a good big supper eaten."  "It iss fery p=
leasant advice, no doubt," said Fergus with a broad and rather sarcastic gr=

Kernogans are there ... well!" he said with a cynical laugh and a shrug of =
his shoulders, "they can=20

be sent up to Paris with the rest of the herd."  "The dinner bell has gone =
long ago," here=20

interposed young Lalouet drily, "the soup will be stone-cold and the chef r=
ed-hot with anger."  "You=20

are right, citizen Lalouet," said Carrier as he leaned back in his chair on=
ce more and stretched out=20

his long legs at his ease. "We have wasted far too much time already over t=
he affairs of a couple=20

of aristos, who ought to have been at the bottom of the Loire a week ago. T=
he audience is ended,"=20

he added airily, and he made a gesture of overweening condescension, for al=
l the world like the=20

one wherewith the _Grand Monarque_ was wont to dismiss his courtiers.  Chau=
velin rose too and=20

quietly turned to the door. He had not spoken a word for Look at anything y=
ou like, but _not at the=20

shore_.  There's a Red-skin there.  I've seen him, though he thinks I haven=
't.  Now, steer right=20

round and go back the way we have just come, only keep always edging a litt=
le off-shore."  As he=20

said this Archie raised himself from his crouching attitude, laid down his =
gun and resumed his=20

paddle, and in his ordinary free-and-easy tones exclaimed--  "We've lost th=
at chance, Little Bill--

more's the pity."  "Never mind," answered Billie in the same tone, being re=
solved to act his part=20

well, "there's lot's more where these came from.  Better luck next time.  W=
here away now?"  "Keep=20

her just as you go, you're far enough out now.  We should start some ducks =
here."  Thus=20

speaking, and with the air of a leisurely man enjoying himself-- with infin=
ite contentment on his=20

ruddy countenance, and=20


_
conciliatory word on behalf of his impetuous colleague. Whether he had take=
n an active interest in=20

the conversation or not it were impossible to say. But now, just as he was =
ready to go, and young=20

Lalouet prepared to close the doors of the audience chamber, something seem=
ed suddenly to=20

occur to him and he called somewhat peremptorily to the young man.  "One mo=
ment, citizen," he=20

said.  "What is it now?" queried the youth insolently, and from his fine ey=
es there shot a glance of=20

contempt on the meagre figure of the once powerful Terrorist.  "About the K=
ernogan wench,"=20

continued Chauvelin. "She will have to be conveyed some time before night t=
o the tavern next=20

door. There may be agencies at work on her behalf...."  "Agencies?" broke i=
n the boy gruffly.=20

"What agencies?"  "Oh!" said Chauvelin vaguely, "we all know that aristos h=
ave powerful friends=20

these days. It will not be over safe to take the girl across after dark fro=
m one house to another ...=20

the alley is badly lighted: the wench will not go willingly. She might scre=
am and create a=20

disturbance and draw ... er ... those same unknown agencies concern in his =
agitated soul--Archie=20

took the canoe straight past the very spot where the Indian lay concealed. =
 He felt that audacity=20

was the safest line of action, for he knew that if the savage meant mischie=
f, to pretend absolute=20

ignorance of his existence would be less likely to draw a shot than sudden =
flight--which, however=20

swiftly carried out, could by no means equal the flight of a bullet.  Besid=
es, it was of the utmost=20

importance that he should reach the encampment and report what he had seen =
without the Indian=20

becoming aware that he had been discovered.  In order to effect his purpose=
, he not only=20

repassed the hiding-place of the savage but actually shot and picked up ano=
ther duck while still=20

within range of the enemy's gun.  Then he directed his brother to steer sti=
ll more off the island, but=20

very slowly.  "We're in no hurry, you see, Little Bill; you haven't looked =
at the shore, I hope?"=20

"Never once."  "Ha! ha!" laughed Archie in high glee at the success of this=
 his first experiment in=20

backwoods warfare; "you're a trump, Little Bill!"  "I'd rather be a trump t=
han a trumpet, Archie.=20


_
body of Marats should be told off to convey her to the Rat Mort...."  Young=
 Lalouet shrugged his=20

shoulders.  "That's your affair," he said curtly. "Eh, Carrier?" And he gla=
nced over his shoulder at=20

the proconsul, who at once assented.  Martin-Roget--struck by his colleague=
's argument--would=20

have interposed, but Carrier broke in with one of his uncontrolled outburst=
s of fury.  "Ah ca," he=20

exclaimed, "enough of this now. Citizen Lalouet is right and I have done en=
ough for you already. If=20

you want the Kernogan wench to be at the Rat Mort, you must see to getting =
her there yourself.=20

She is next door, what? I won't have anything to do with it and I won't hav=
e my Marats implicated=20

in the affair either. Name of a dog! have I not told you that I am beset wi=
th spies? It would of a=20

truth be a climax if I was denounced as having dragged aristos to a house o=
f ill-fame and then had=20

them arrested there as malefactors! Now out with you! I have had enough of =
this! Red-skins about,=20

laughing like that will be sure to rouse them."  "Never fear, Billie, my bo=
y.  You do as I tell 'ee.  We=20

must keep up the game a bit longer yet.  It won't do to hurry back till the=
 sun is lower, so we'll go=20

over to that small island there an' have a try for another duck.  There's s=
ure to be nobody on such=20

a small island as that. Afterwards we'll drop down in an off-hand, idle-lik=
e way to the encampment.=20

It'll be natural to do this when the evenin's beginning to set in, an' so w=
e'll stump them Red-skins=20

at their own game.  D'ee understand?"  "Yes.  You're a clever chap, Archie.=
"  In pursuance of this=20

deeply laid plan, the brothers crossed over to the small islet referred to,=
 and, after apparently=20

amusing themselves there for a short time, dropped down stream in a leisure=
ly way, reaching the=20

encampment before the evening had fairly set in.  A council of war was imme=
diately held.  "You=20

were right in your guess, Okematan," said=20
