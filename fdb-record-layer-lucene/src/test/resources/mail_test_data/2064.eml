"Why, yes!" Telzey cried.  The zoologist looked at her. "You knew that--"  =
"Well, not really," Telzey=20

admitted. "Or sort of." She laughed, her cheeks flushed. "This is the most =
... go ahead please!=20

Sorry I interrupted." She stared at the wall beyond Dr. Droon with a rapt e=
xpression.         *       *=20

*       *       *  The zoologist and Halet exchanged glances. Then Dr. Droo=
n resumed cautiously.=20

The crest cats, he said, were a species native to Jontarou. Their existence=
 had been known for=20

only eight years. The species appeared to have had a somewhat limited range=
--the Baluit=20

mountains on the opposite side of the huge continent on which Port Nichay h=
ad been built....=20

Telzey barely heard him. A very curious thing was happening. For every sent=
ence Dr. Droon=20

uttered, a dozen other sentences appeared in her ladyship and your sisters =
had been so kind.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CBut if the Lord of the Towers asks her,=E2=80=9D suggested Lady St=
. Aldegonde.  =E2=80=9CNo, no,=E2=80=9D said Mrs. Giles,=20

=E2=80=9Cthat would not do; nor would he. He knows she dislikes it. A word =
from Colonel Campian, and the=20

thing would be settled; but it is rather absurd to invoke the authority of =
a husband for so light a=20

matter.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI should like so much to hear her,=E2=80=9D said=
 Lady St. Aldegonde. =E2=80=9CI think I will ask her myself.=20

I will go and speak to mamma.=E2=80=9D  There was much whispering and consu=
lting in the room, but=20

unnoticed, as general conversation had now been resumed. The duchess sent f=
or Lothair, and=20

conferred with him; but Lothair seemed to shake his head. Then her grace ro=
se and approached=20

Colonel Campian, who was talking to Lord Culloden, and then the duchess and=
 Lady St.=20

Aldegonde went to=20


_
of information relevant to whatever he said arose continuously from what mi=
ght have been almost=20

her own memory, but wasn't. Within a minute or two, she knew more about the=
 crest cats of=20

Jontarou than Dr. Droon could have told her in hours ... much more than he'=
d ever known.  She=20

realized suddenly that he'd stopped talking, that he had asked her a questi=
on. "Miss Amberdon?"=20

he repeated now, with a note of uncertainty.  "Yar-rrr-REE!" Telzey told hi=
m softly. "I'll drink your=20

blood!"  "Eh?"  Telzey blinked, focused on Dr. Droon, wrenching her mind aw=
ay from a splendid=20

view of the misty-blue peaks of the Baluit range.  "Sorry," she said briskl=
y. "Just a joke!" She=20

smiled. "Now what were you saying?"  The zoologist looked at her in a rathe=
r odd manner for a=20

moment. "I was inquiring," he said then, "whether you were familiar with th=
e sporting rules=20

established by the various hunting associations of the Hub in connection wi=
th the taking of game=20

trophies?"  Telzey shook her head. "No, I never heard of them."         *  =
     *       *       *       *  The=20

rules, Dr. Droon explained, laid down the type of equipment ... weapons, sp=
otting and tracking=20

instruments, number of assistants, and so forth ... a sportsman could legit=
imately use in the pursuit=20

of any specific type of game. "Before the end of the first year after their=
 discovery," he went on,=20

"the Baluit crest cats had been placed in Campian. Then, after a short time=
, Lady St. Aldegonde=20

rose and fetched Lothair.  =E2=80=9CHer grace tells me,=E2=80=9D said Theod=
ora, =E2=80=9Cthat Colonel Campian wishes me=20

to give a recitation. I cannot believe that such a performance can ever be =
generally interesting,=20

especially in a foreign language, and I confess that I would rather not exh=
ibit. But I do not like to be=20

churlish when all are so amiable and compliant, and her grace tells me that=
 it cannot well be=20

postponed, for this is the last quiet night we shall have. What I want is a=
 screen, and I must be a=20

moment alone, before I venture on these enterprises. I require it to create=
 the ideal presence.=E2=80=9D=20

Lothair and Bertram arranged the screen, the duchess and Lady St. Aldegonde=
 glided about, and=20

tranquilly intimated what was going to occur, so that, without effort, ther=
e was in a moment=20

complete silence and general expectation. Almost unnoticed Mrs. Campian had=
 disappeared,=20

whispering a word as she passed to the eminent conductor, who was still sea=
ted at the piano. The=20

company had almost unconsciously grouped themselves in the form of a theatr=
e, the gentlemen=20

generally standing behind the ladies who were seated. There were some bars =
of solemn music,=20

and then, to an audience not less nervous than herself, Theodora came forwa=
rd as Electra in that=20

beautiful appeal to Clytemnestra, where she veils her mother=E2=80=99s guil=

ultra-equipment class."  "What's ultra-equipment?" Telzey asked.  "Well," D=
r. Droon said=20

thoughtfully, "it doesn't quite involve the use of full battle armor ... no=
t quite! And, of course, even=20

with that classification the sporting principle of mutual accessibility mus=
t be observed."  "Mutual ...=20

oh, I see!" Telzey paused as another wave of silent information rose into h=
er awareness; went on,=20

"So the game has to be able to get at the sportsman too, eh?"  "That's corr=
ect. Except in the=20

pursuit of various classes of flying suspicion of its existence, and makes =
one last desperate appeal=20

of pathetic duty in order to save her parent and her fated house:       =E2=
=80=9CO amata madre,       Che fai?=20

Non credo io, no, che ardente fiamma       Il cor ti avvampi.=E2=80=9D  The=
 ineffable grace of her action,=20

simple without redundancy, her exquisite elocution, her deep yet controlled=
 passion, and the=20

magic of a voice thrilling even in a whisper=E2=80=94this form of Phidias w=

Sophocles=E2=80=94entirely enraptured a fastidious audience. When she cease=
d, there was an=20

aircar other than as means of simple transportation. Under these conditions=
, it was soon=20

established that crest cats were being obtained by sportsmen who went after=
 them at a rather=20

consistent one-to-one ration."  Telzey's eyes widened. She'd gathered somet=
hing similar from her=20

other information source but hadn't quite believed it. "One hunter killed f=
or each cat bagged?" she=20

said. "That's pretty rough sport, isn't it?  "Extremely rough sport!" Dr. D=
roon agreed dryly. "In fact,=20

when the statistics were published, the sporting interest in winning a Balu=
it cat trophy appears to=20

have St. Aldegonde, who had listened in a sort of ecstasy, rushed forward, =
with a countenance as=20

serious as the theme, to offer his thanks and express his admiration.  And =
then they gathered=20

round her=E2=80=94all these charming women and some of these admiring men=
=E2=80=94as she would have=20

resumed her seat, and entreated her once more=E2=80=94only once more=E2=80=
=94to favor them. She caught the=20

adoring glance of the lord of the Towers, and her eyes seemed to inquire wh=
at she should do.=20

=E2=80=9CThere will be many strangers here to-morrow,=E2=80=9D said Lothair=
, =E2=80=9Cand next week all the world. This is a=20
