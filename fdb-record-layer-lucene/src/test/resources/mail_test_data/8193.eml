because it's so steep. We can't take the horses. I'll try that way, however, before I'll let Jerry 

Chowden laugh at us."  "So will I," answered Nat, and Sam and Bony said the same thing.  "I think 

we're in for a storm," remarked Will as they jogged along. "It's beginning to snow."  A few flakes 

were sifting lazily down, and they increased by the time the boys reached camp, where they found 

Budge and Long Gun busy tightening the tent ropes and piling the wood and provisions within the 

smaller supply tent.  "What's the matter?" asked Jack.  "Storm comin'," replied the Indian. "Plenty 

much bad. Git ready."  Early the next morning Jack and his chums were awakened by the wind 

howling about their tent. It was cold, in spite of heavy blankets and thick clothing.  "B-r-r-r!" 

exclaimed Jack as he crawled out and went to the flap of the tent. Then he gave a startled cry. 

"Boys, it's a regular blizzard!" he said.  Nothing could be seen but a white wall of fiercely swirling 

snowflakes, while the wind be liberal and give the man a ham from his smoke-house. On his way 

to get it, the tempter whispered to him:  "Give him the smallest one you have."  He had a struggle 

whether he would give a large or a small ham, but finally he took down the largest he could find. 

"You are a fool," the devil said.  "If you don't keep still," the farmer replied, "I will give him every 

ham I have in the smoke house."  Mr. Durant told me he woke up one morning to find that he was 

a rich man, and he said that the greatest struggle of his life then took place as to whether he would 

let money be his master, or he be master of money, whether he would be its slave, or make it a 

slave to him. At last he got the victory, and that was how Wellesley College came to be built.  In 

the next place, cultivate the spirit of contentment. "Let your conversation be without covetousness; 

and be content with such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake 

thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is

to collapse the tent. But Long Gun had done his work well, and the canvas shelter stood. 

CHAPTER XXX  JACK'S HAZARDOUS PLAN   The boys crowded up around Jack and peered 

through an opening in the tent flap.  "Blizzard! I should say so!" exclaimed Nat. "It's fierce! How are 

we going to cook any breakfast?"  "Me show," answered Long Gun with a grin. Then he pointed to 

where he and Budge, the day before, had fear what man shall do unto me."  Contentment is the 

very opposite of covetousness, which is continually craving for something it does not possess. "Be 

content with such things as ye have," not worrying about the future, because God has promised 

never to leave or forsake you. What does the child of God want more than this? I would rather 

have that promise than all the gold of the earth.  Would to God we might all
