 of the various=20

colored schools in Virginia. The General Assembly, therefore, passed a law =
providing that there=20

should be no more assemblages of slaves, or free Negroes, or mulattoes, mix=
ing or associating=20

with such slaves for teaching them reading and writing.[2] The opposition h=
ere seemed to be for=20

the reasons that Negroes were being generally enlightened in the towns of t=
he State and that=20

white persons as teachers in these institutions were largely instrumental i=
n accomplishing this=20

result. Mississippi even as a Territory had tried to meet the problem of un=
lawful assemblies. In the=20

year 1823 it was declared unlawful for Negroes above the number of five to =
meet for educational=20

purposes.[3] Only with the permission of their masters could slaves attend =
religious worship=20

conducted by a recognized white minister or attended by "two discreet and r=
eputable persons."[4]=20

o keep out intelligent=20

persons who might so inform the slaves as to cause them to rise. Accordingl=
y in 1814[1] the State=20

passed a law   'With noble lives I have little to do;   My dear, put those =
frivolous notions down,   I=20

am but a man, and a weak one too.   My life has been full of confounded thi=
ngs,   I am only a man,=20

   His hand sought my=20

 When turf is level how=20

deemed sufficient=20

after the insurrectionary Negroes of New Berne, Tarborough, and Hillsboroug=
h, North Carolina,[2]=20

had risen, and David Walker of Massachusetts had published to the slaves hi=
s fiery appeal to=20

arms.[3] In 1830, therefore, Louisiana enacted another measure, providing t=
hat whoever should=20

write, print, publish, or distribute anything having the tendency to produc=
e discontent among the=20

slaves, should on conviction thereof be imprisoned at hard labor for life o=
r suffer death at the=20

discretion of the court. It was provided, too, that whoever used any langua=
ge or became=20

instrumental in bringing into the State any paper, book, or pamphlet induci=
ng this discontent=20

should suffer practically the same penalty. All persons who should teach, o=
r permit or cause to be=20

taught, any slave to read or write, should be imprisoned not less than one =
month nor more than=20

twelve.[4]    Life leaping in me, it sounds like a jest),   May it be thus =
