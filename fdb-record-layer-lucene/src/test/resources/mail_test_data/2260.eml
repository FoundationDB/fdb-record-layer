bough almost touching the limb on which Willie crouched, mechanically clutc=
hing the body of the=20

tree, but dumb and stupefied with the horror of his situation.  Anna hurrie=

under a thick, broken branch-stump of the redwood, which was at least eight=
 feet from the ground.=20

Four times she leaped upward and fell back, wounding her tough little feet.=
 She noticed blood-

stains on the rocks as she heaped them with a broader base for her fifth at=

rested, waving his head downward as if in query. Fortunately, he was full a=
nd sluggish.  Once=20

ump, her left easily=20

followed. Clasping the decreasing trunk of the tree with her slim, muscular=
 legs, hanging also by=20

her hands, she dropped her head backward to take observation. The snake hun=
g out, also, toward=20

 it, she took out her=20

t limb above her, and=20

broke off the weakened branch. Recovering her balance, she reached out with=
 this flexible club,=20

but could not touch the snake, now roused to accelerated activity.  Holding=
 her weapon between=20
