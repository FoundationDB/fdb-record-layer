Poppy, I am about to take my first soaring flight."  "Oh law! Miss Jasmine--I always knew you were 

clever, miss, and I suppose it is because I'm so worried in my business days that I've got that 

stupid that I can't see no meaning at all in your words, miss."  "All right, Poppy, you need not see 

any meaning in them--all you have to do is to come with me, and look very grave and solemn, and 

say 'Yes' when I say 'Yes,' and shake your head and look stern when I do. You are older than me, 

Poppy, and you are coming as a sort of chaperon. Oh dear! Poppy, I wish you would not wear that 

scarlet wing and those yellow flowers in your hat."  "The cruellest of all the bitings," whispered 

Poppy under her breath. Aloud she said, in a meek but determined little voice--  "That hat's as it's 

trimmed, Miss Jasmine, and must remain according, for it can't be denuded in the street."  "All 

right, Poppy. Your own dear face looks sweet and home-like under it; now let us get into the very 

first omnibus, and find our way to the city."  When the girls arrived within the sacred precincts of 

the far-famed Paternoster Row, Jasmine held her breath a little, and stood still while she eagerly 

considered as to which publishing house she should offer her wares. Finally, she determined that 

her first pilgrimage should be to the editor of _The Downfall_, who had not yet returned or even 

written to her about her "Ode to Adversity."  The office of _The Downfall_ was not in Paternoster 

Row, but in a very narrow street adjoining, and Jasmine, followed by Poppy, plunged boldly down 

this narrow alley, and then up, and up, and up, and up the winding stairs to the editor's office at 

the top of the house.  Jasmine had not been at all agreeably impressed by Mr. Rogers on the 

occasion of her former visit. Unaccompanied by Poppy, she would scarcely have again ventured 

to approach him, but Poppy looked quite determined and resolute enough to give her little 

companion courage, and Jasmine's childish voice was presently heard in the outer office 

demanding to see the editor.  It so happened that Mr. Rogers was not particularly engaged, for 

_The Downfall_ was rapidly proving the truth of its title, and was having a very quick descent into 

an early and untimely grave--consequently its editor had very little to do.  Mr. Rogers consented to 

see Miss Jasmine Mainwaring and her companion, and accordingly the two girls were ushered into 

the editorial presence.  Mr. Rogers commenced his interview with Miss Jasmine by apparently 

forgetting all about her. This had a most disconcerting effect on the young author.  "But surely you 

must remember that I came to see you nearly three months ago, and brought you a poem called 

an 'Ode to Adversity,'" pleaded Jasmine--"we had rather a long talk about it; I don't know how you 

can absolutely forget."  "My dear young lady, so many people call, and leave so many poems, and 

each poem is so like the last, that really you must pardon me, but my head gets confused." 

"Taken with a kind of swimming, sir?" here burst in Poppy. "I suppose it is a sort of Sarah case 

over again."  The editor stared rather fiercely at this unexpected interruption, deigned no reply 

whatever to Poppy, and continued his conversation with Jasmine.  "I am sorry that I have forgotten 

both you and your poem--it is, doubtless, docketed with others to be returned in You've helped me 

more than you know, and God bless you!"     CHAPTER XII   That evening the Captain dropped 

the brass knocker to the Elder's front door with a heavy thud. A servant opened the door.  "I want 

to see Mr. Fox."  "He's not in, sir. Will you leave any----"  "Who is it, Debbs?" called a voice from 

the top of the stair.  "Captain Pott, sir. I thought you was to see no one to-night, sir."  "That's all 

right. Send him right up to my room."  The Elder's den was across the hall from his daughter's 

room, in the most quiet part of the house.  "Right in here, Josiah. We shall be more private here 

than down-stairs."  The Captain entered, and took the chair indicated by the Elder.  "I was very 



busy, and told Debbs I was not to be disturbed, but I recognized your voice, and--er--wanted to 

see you. It has been quite a long while since we have had a friendly chat, Josiah. I wish you would 

come more often. I get very lonesome in this big place. Have a cigar? No? I shall, if you don't 

mind."  "We ain't been none too neighborly, as you might say."  "Why don't you come up once in a 

while?"  "Cal'late for the same reason you don't get over to the other end of the road. For one 

thing, I'm too busy paying off debts."  The Elder looked questioningly at the seaman as he touched 

the lighted end of a match to his cigar. "That is true. We--er--are busy, too busy for our own good. 

We ought to be more sociable here in Little River. We need something to stir us up."  "We're too 

damn selfish, if you ask me. As far as stirring goes, I cal'late we've got as much of that as any 

town along this coast. About all a feller can do is to set his teeth against the hurricane and grin." 

The Elder laughed without restraint, and his visitor began to show signs of uneasiness.  "You'd 

best be careful with them delicate blood-vessels," mildly suggested the Captain.  "True, Josiah. 

But that was a good joke, a very good joke. One can take it in two ways."  "Not the way I mean it. 

There's enough gossip----"  "Yes, we are too selfish," broke in the Elder, "and it is too bad. I often 

think of the time we were kids together. We had our little scraps, made up, and were ready to fight 

for each other."  The Captain could recall no occasion when he had fought for Jim Fox.  "How long 

ago that all seems! Yet how--er--happy were those days. No cares. No sorrows. No troubles. No 

misunderstandings. Excuse me, Josiah. I don't know why it is that I hark back like this when we 

get together. But it does me a world of good."  "Maybe you've got another fish to fry," suggested 

the Captain, wholly untouched by the Elder's memory picture. "That was the way you done when 

you wanted us boys to do something for you, and you ain't got over it with age."  "I was quite a 

diplomat in those days, wasn't I? But we can't bring them back. No, sir, we can't. They are--er--

gone forever."  "I ain't sartin I want to fetch 'em back. Leastwise, that wa'n't my purpose in coming 

here to-night. I come over to see you about that mortgage you slipped over on me."  "Mortgage?" 

"Yes, mortgage."  "Oh! You refer to that little loan I made you some time ago? That was--er--real 

humor calling it a mortgage."  "It may be funny to you, but it ain't to me."  "I hope that little matter 

isn't bothering you."  "It ain't, but a feller from the city is. He told me you was intending to take my 

place." 


_
sorry, but of course I could not use it--did you expect me to? Why, the name alone--an 'Ode to 

Adversity,' was quite sufficient to make me decline it."  "But, but," said Jasmine, coloring crimson 

and very nearly crying, "I was told by a lady who reads your paper that the name was just what 

you like. She said that your paper was called by a melancholy name, and of course you wanted 

melancholy subjects."  The editor smiled in a very bland, though disagreeable manner--"_The 

Downfall_," he said; "we chose that title for political reasons." Here he sounded a gong. "Jones," 

as an attendant came in, "look in pigeon-hole D, and put into an envelope for this young lady 

some verses entitled an 'Ode to Adversity.' Sorry I can do nothing more for you this morning, Miss 

Mainwaring. Good morning--_good_ morning."  When the two girls got out on the landing Jasmine 

thrust her rejected poem into Poppy's hand.  "Put it into your pocket, Poppy," she said, "and don't 

on any account let me see it--I must try to forget it, or my courage will go. Evidently, Poppy, names 

go by contraries. I wrote some dismal papers on purpose for _The Downfall_; I will now offer them 

to a magazine which has a cheerful title."  "Look there, Miss Jasmine," said Poppy, when they got 

into the street. "Right there, facing us at the other side, is what I call a pleasant magazine--it has 

lots of pictures, for see, it's pressed up to the window wide open, and it's called _The Joy-bell_--

I'm a great deal more taken with that sound than with the sound of _The Downfall_."  "So am I, 

too," said Jasmine, the April cloud quickly leaving her expressive face--"I'm so glad I have you with 

me, dear Poppy; I was feeling so low just now that I should never have noticed the office of _The 

Joy-bell_--it has a very nice, high-class sound, and I should say was a more attractive magazine 

than even a shilling one. We'll go there at once, Poppy, and be sure you support me, and say 'Yes' 

when I look at you; and if I happen to frown in your direction, you'll know that I want you to help me 

not to accept too low a price. Now come, Poppy; I feel that destiny leads my steps to the office of 

_The Joy-bell_."  The editor of _The Joy-bell_ happened also to be disengaged, and after keeping 

the young aspirant for literary fame waiting for about a quarter of an hour, consented to see her 

and her companion.  Jasmine's interview with this editor caused her to come away in very high 

spirits, for he had not only promised most carefully to consider her poem, "The Flight of the 

Beautiful," but he had also said he was wanting a serial story to run through the pages of _The 

"I'm sorry he told you that. I do not know what I should do with it if I had it."  "I don't know what I'd 

do without it, Jim."  "I think it can be arranged without difficulty. It is such a small matter."  "It may 

look small to you, but it looks a heap sight different to me."  "I know, Josiah. It is very opportune 

that you have come to me to-night. Not more than an hour ago I was thinking of you, and wishing I 

might--er--see you. I have been thinking, too, of others, some who stood by me in time of peril and 

poverty. I feel greatly indebted to them, and since they were members of your family, I must now 

show my appreciation for their kindness."  "I cal'late you're referring to them you served a dirty 

trick over in Australia."  "Why, Josiah! I have told you a hundred times that I was never in 

Australia," declared the other, paling slightly.  "That's so, you have, Jim. Excuse me."  "As I was 

saying," he continued, showing great relief, "I feel indebted to them, and I want to pay back----" 

"Look here, Jim, you needn't offer none of your blood money. It don't look good to me."  It was a 

bold stroke, but it went home. The color crept slowly from the Elder's sanguine face.  "I have no 

intention of offering you charity."  "You know damn well you dasn't. I'm not speaking of charity, and 

you know that, too, Jim. I'm speaking of blood money, and I mean just what I say."  "You are still 

the same doubting Thomas, I see. Do you recall how you were always the last one--er--to be won 



over to a new enterprise?" The Elder tried to smile.  "I had good reason to go slow. A mite of 

caution is a purty fair endowment of nature where some people's schemes is concerned. If I'd 

used a little of it last spring I'd not be in the fix I am to-day."  "But that bump of caution on your 

head is pretty hard on your friends."  "I cal'late it won't hurt my friends none. We wa'n't speaking of 

them just then. Anyhow, it's kept me with a clean conscience to sleep with, and I'd a heap sight 

rather ship with clear rigging than be ballasted with some people's money and have to make 

bedfellows with their conscience."  "Yes,--er--ahem--quite true," was the hasty reply. "What can I 

do for you, Josiah? If I can be of the least service,--er--I shall be only too glad."  "It depends on 

what you've got to offer me. The fust thing I'd like to suggest is that you stop that there er-ing and 

hem-ing. There ain't no one here but me, and it don't make no impression. Being that you're so 

infernal anxious to get back to boyhood days we might just as well go all-hog on it. You didn't try 

none of that foolishness then."  "What you say is quite true." The

if hers happened to suit him he would be happy to use it. Finally, she went away, leaving both her 

story and her poems in his hands, and with a large parcel of _Joy-bells_ under her arm.  "I will let 

you know my decision in a few days," said the editor, with a very suave smile. "Oh, yes, as to 

terms, we  "You didn't have them things to pet, neither. You might just as well stop that. It makes 

me nervous."  Elder Fox eyed him narrowly. He had a mind to tell this man to leave his house at 

once. He even entertained the thought that it might be a good thing to call Debbs and have him 

put out. But a certain

I discover if your story is likely to suit me."  Then Jasmine went away trembling with delight.  "Oh, 

Poppy!" she said, "how very, very happy I am."     CHAPTER XXXIV.  A PLAN.   Mrs. Ellsworthy 

had by no means forgotten the girls--they had all three taken her fancy, and, as she said to her 

husband, she could not get them out of her head. Arthur Noel, who was a sort of adopted son of 

the house, often now brought her information about her favorites, but the good little lady was for 

years haunted the Elder, laid a cold restraining hand on his inclinations.  "Yes, Josiah, those are 

habits that I have formed in business. Dealing with so many different kinds of men makes us do 

odd things at times, and if repeated often enough they become habits. I have always tried to be 

courteous even to men that bore me, and I presume I took on those senseless little syllables to 

temper my natural brusqueness."  "Well, you don't need 'em to-night, and you can be as brusque
