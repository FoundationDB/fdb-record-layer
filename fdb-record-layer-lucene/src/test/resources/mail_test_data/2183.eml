to get away from here," Mr. Hatfield thought aloud. "Well, let's get back a=

little closer.  "Who lives there?" Brad whispered, impatient for informatio=
n.  "Wait," Jack said. "We'll=20

get in close, and maybe you can see for yourselves."  "If we all move in, w=
e'll likely be seen," Mr.=20

Hatfield insisted.  It was decided that Jack, Mr. Hatfield, Brad and Dan sh=
ould go on ahead,=20

leaving the others in the shelter of the trees.  Moving softly over the une=
ven ground, the trio crept=20

close to the shack. Keeping close to the wall, they reached a broken pane o=
f glass which served=20

as the only window.  Jack pressed his face against it and nodded in satisfa=
ction.  "He's in there!=20

Have a look!"  Jack moved back to allow Dan to take his place.  The boy pee=
red into the dark=20

interior of the shack. At first he caught only an impression of an empty ro=
om with an old box which=20

served as a table.  Then gradually he made out a balsam-bough bed on the fl=
oor, covered with an=20

army blanket. Sprawled on the bed, fully clothed was a man with a stubbly b=
eard.  "It's that same=20

fellow who looked in the church window!" Dan murmured, startled to recogniz=
e him.  "Careful,=20

Dan!" Mr. Hatfield warned, for in his excitement, the boy very nearly had s=
poken aloud. "Let me=20

have a look."  Dan moved aside so that both the Cub leader and Brad might p=
eer at the stranger.=20

"It's the same man all right," Brad confirmed Dan's identification. "He's d=
ead to the world!"  Mr.=20

Hatfield had turned to Jack. "This is all very interesting," he whispered. =
"But you promised to show=20

us something that might explain about the missing money box."  "I can't sho=
w you while he's in=20

there. But he's got it."  "Not the money?"  "Sure." Jack thoroughly enjoyed=
 his knowledge.  "You've=20

got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grow=
n blizzard ordered for=20

you."  All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simpl=
y spilled out of heaven, like=20

thousands of feather-beds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a c=
arpenter-shop; the=20

men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long hand=
les. Neither=20

grandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens and b=
rought in a pitiful=20

contribution of eggs.  Next day our men had to shovel until noon to reach t=
he barn--and the snow=20

was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years my gran=
dfather had lived in=20

Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would not try to reach the cattle--they=
 were fat enough to go=20

without their corn for a day or two; but to-morrow we must feed them and th=
aw out their water-tap=20

so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the corrals, but we k=
new the steers were=20

over there, huddled together under the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, sub=
dued enough by this=20

time, were probably warming each other's backs. "This'll take the bile out =
of 'em!" Fuchs remarked=20

gleefully.  At noon that day the hens had not been heard from. After dinner=
 Jake and Otto, their=20

damp clothes now dried on them, stretched their stiff arms and plunged agai=
n into the drifts. They=20

made a tunnel under the snow to the henhouse, with walls so solid that gran=
dmother and I could=20

walk back and forth in it. We found the chickens asleep; perhaps they thoug=
ht night had come to=20

stay. One old rooster was stirring about, pecking at the solid lump of ice =
in their water-tin. When=20


_
"How do you know this, Jack? Did you see the box?"  "Right from this very w=
indow. I was=20

wandering through the woods late one afternoon when I came onto this shack.=
 I was curious, so I=20

sneaked up and looked in."  "And this same tramp was living in there?" Dan =
asked. "When was=20

that?"  "Oh, I didn't find the shack until a couple of days ago. I don't kn=
ow how long it's been here."=20

"Tell us about the money box," Mr. Hatfield urged.  "Well, as I looked thro=
ugh the window, I saw=20

that tramp take it out from under his bed. While I watched, he counted the =
money. I saw a lot of=20

bills in neat stacks."  "Jeepers!" Dan whispered. "It must be the money we =
the hens set up a great=20

cackling and flew about clumsily, scattering down-feathers. The mottled, pi=
n-headed guinea-hens,=20

always resentful of captivity, ran screeching out into the tunnel and tried=
 to poke their ugly, painted=20

faces through the snow walls. By five o'clock the chores were done--just wh=
en it was time to begin=20

them all over again! That was a strange, unnatural sort of day.     XIV   O=
N the morning of the 22d=20

I wakened with a start. Before I opened my eyes, I seemed to know that some=
thing had happened.=20

I heard excited voices in the kitchen--grandmother's was so shrill that I k=
new she must be almost=20

beside herself. I looked forward to=20


_
"That hunk of baloney saw us through the window, and probably found out tha=
t the box was taken=20

to Mr. Hatfield's house," Brad reasoned. "But how did he get it from there?=
"  "Remember Mrs.=20

Jones' black dress!" Dan reminded him.  "Sure, I get it. He must have stole=
n it from her place and=20

wore the garment when he slipped into the house."  "That's why the could it=
 be, I wondered, as I=20

hurried into my clothes. Perhaps the barn had burned; perhaps the cattle ha=
d frozen to death;=20

perhaps a neighbor was lost in the storm.  Down in the kitchen grandfather =
was standing before=20

the stove with his hands behind him. Jake and Otto had taken off their boot=
s and were rubbing=20

their woolen socks. Their clothes and boots=20
