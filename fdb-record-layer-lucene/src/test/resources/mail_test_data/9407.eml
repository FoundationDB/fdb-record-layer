"Then let's get the sled out and look it over," said Jack.  The old sled seemed to be in fairly good 

condition. It was roughly but strongly made, as it had to be to stand dragging over the mountain 

trails. The boys hauled it to the edge of the slope.  "Get on," called Jack as he began piling upon 

the flat top his gun and a package of food he had brought along.  "Wait a minute," proposed Nat. 

"What's the matter now?" inquired Jack. "You're not going to back out, are you?"  "No, but it just 

occurred to me that we'd better have some sort of a brake on this thing. If we get going down that 

mountain we might not be able to stop."  "We don't want to, until we get to the camp."  "But s'pose

through a hole in the back of the sled. When you want to stop, just jab it into the ground, and it will 

scrape along."  "Better have two, while you're at it," said Sam. "Then we can steer with them by 

jabbing first one, then the other down. They will slew us around whichever way we want to go." 

"Fine!" cried Jack, always willing to give any of his chums the credit for a good invention. "We'll do 

it."  With a small hatchet, which they had brought with them, two stout saplings were cut, trimmed
