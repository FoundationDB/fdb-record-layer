philodendron monstera in which her children and the servant, who performed =

morning's delivery brought to the hotel, among other letters for expected p=
eople (which letters=20

where placed in a rack in the commercial room), two for Mr. John Brown of L=
ondon. The next day=20

Mr. John Brown of London arrived, and I was struck by the resemblance of th=
e man as he opened=20

the door of the commercial room, in which I was then sitting, a little anxi=
ously watching for his=20

arrival. It is needless to take the reader through the subsequent steps of =
my investigation. He will=20

see that I had almost bagged my game. It is enough to say that a few inquir=
ies upon the subject=20

elicited the fact that a regular traveller (on the road in which the town o=
f ---- and the Griffin's Head=20

Hotel were situated) being suddenly taken ill, and many accounts being due =
to the house he=20

travelled for on that line, Mr. John Brown was ordered to do the midland jo=
urney for him a few=20

times. It was on one of these journeys that he found his evil opportunity f=
or seducing the domestic=20

of the inn, and playing off upon her the mean trick which led to the summon=
s against Mr. Delmar,=20

the reckless testimony the complainant bore as to his identity, and his con=
demnation by the=20

justices. It is only necessary to add, that the decision against Mr. Delmar=
 was quashed at the=20

Quarter Sessions; and that his character as a man of unblemished honour and=
 domestic virtue=20

was, if possible, strengthened by the ordeal he had to pass through.     AN=
 UNSCRUPULOUS=20

WOMAN.   Some years ago I was retained to penetrate the mystery of a case i=
n many respects=20

not very unlike the celebrated Road murder; and I was to bring the criminal=
 to justice if possible. It=20

was a case of child murder. The house in which the horrid deed was perpetra=
ted was a cottage,=20

standing in the midst of ample grounds--perhaps ten acres in extent--commun=
icating with a=20

turnpike-road, not much used or frequented, and along which no vehicles pas=
sed, except those=20

going to or from the cottage or an adjacent farm-house.  I feel that I am a=
t liberty to indicate the=20

locality of this deed no further than to say, it was in a south of England =
county.  In order to explain=20

the nature of the case I should, however, remark, that the occupiers of the=
 cottage were, a=20

gentleman who had retired from a business in London, his wife, children, an=
d servants.  The man=20

was cynical, misanthropical, and morbidly disposed to seclusion. He was an =
eccentric man, and=20

he every where excited prejudices against himself. Even the retirement of t=
his cottage was not so=20

complete as to exclude him wholly from contact with the world, or to shut T=
he resultant commotion=20

is usually extensive, the storm centre traveling across the country; but oc=
casionally the effects are=20

perceptible only for a short distance, the storm centre either breaking up =
or ascending to the upper=20

atmosphere.  By a cyclonic storm is signified a storm characterized by unus=
ually low barometer,=20

and a wind system blowing spirally inward, as in a genuine cyclone. They us=
ually affect only the=20

lower strata of the air. Quite frequently they are broken up by striking lo=
w mountain ranges, such=20

as the Alleghany system: and often pass Mount Washington without making the=
ir presence felt at=20

the signal station on its summit. To what extent they are influenced by or =
are due to the upper air=20

currents is therefore unknown, though not a few of the attendant phenomena =
indicate that the=20

latter are of no little importance.  Any one who has observed the waters at=
 the junction of two=20

streams, is familiar with the appearance of numerous tiny eddies or whirlpo=
ols formed at the point=20

of junction. Such are perceptible also in every rapid stream, when the curr=
ent, sheering sharply=20

from a projecting point, is made in a measure to collide with itself. This =
is also the principle of the=20

many tiny whirlwinds seen during the warm summer days: and such are also ob=
servable in winter,=20

if there be snow enough to render their presence in the air clearly visible=
. Their results are most=20

readily recognized in snow-drifts, where the wind meets some special obstru=
ction. It does not often=20



occur that a high fence is covered with a snow-drift: a great drift will be=
 thrown up by it, but not=20

against it: and the side next the fence will be curved inward, or concave. =
The wind strikes the=20

fence and partially recoils, curving upward to pass over the fence. The dri=
ft is then built up=20

between the wind and the current recoiling from the fence, and its inner cu=
rve shows the direction=20

pursued by the rebounding current.  Now, when opposing air-currents meet ea=
ch other on a large=20

scale, the immense whirlwind that is produced is called a cyclone or tornad=
o. It follows then, that if=20

we would find any regularity or law in these unusual disturbances, we must =
know if there exists=20

any permanent condition of atmospheric currents that is favorable to their =
generation.  That such a=20

state exists, we have already learned. The great belts of calms that we hav=
e found between the=20

trade-winds and the return trades and polar currents, are more appropriatel=
y called the zones of=20

equinoctial storms. We have in them districts of general calms, with winds =
infringing upon=20


_
these prejudices.  He had married--much later in life than is usual with pr=
osperous men--about a=20

year before he took up his abode in the place I have described. His wife ha=
d been a poor young=20

woman, although rather beautiful, and, in my opinion, her amiability and go=
odness compensated=20

to such a man for her lack of intellectual qualifications.  At the time I s=
peak of there were living in=20

this cottage Mr. Robinson, his wife, their two infant children, and two cas=
e of the fence, whose=20

recoil-current curves the snow-drift, a whirling current of considerable ma=
gnitude may arise here at=20

any time: hence, violent storms do arise in these regions more or less at a=
ll periods of the year.=20

But we have seen that these zones of calms move slightly to the north or so=
uth with the course of=20

the sun. It would then appear that at the equinoctial period, when they ret=
urn from the mean=20

position toward the extreme northern or southern=20


_
servants--one of whom, a young woman about twenty-three years of age, they =
had brought with=20

them from London to this retreat in the south of England.  One morning in J=
une, Mrs. Robinson=20

arose from her bed about half-past six o'clock, and before dressing herself=
, as was her custom,=20

she crossed the opportunity for unusual disturbances, especially since the =
heavy rainfall of those=20

periods would unusually affect the temperature of the atmosphere.  That is =
precisely what occurs.=20

The equinoxes are marked by storms of unusual severity, and the influence o=
f the sudden falls of=20

rain is so great that=20
