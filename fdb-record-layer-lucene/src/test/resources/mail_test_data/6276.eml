The young farmer, feeling that something must be done to scare off this hai=
r-raising intruder,=20

leaped to his feet in sudden desperation, and, shouting at the top of his v=
oice, seized the door and=20

slammed it back into the casing with all his strength, bumping the bear's n=
ose severely.  Then he=20

set his shoulder against it, and braced with all his might.  But his move w=
as a bad one, for there=20

was a short angry growl on the outside and the next instant the door, farme=
r and all went spinning=20

across the room, the man falling heavily and striking against the stove in =
the fall, and the great=20

shaggy monster at once followed up her advantage by shambling awkwardly int=
o the room.  The=20

woman screamed and fainted, and then a gust of wind from the open doorway b=
lew out the light,=20

leaving the kitchen in darkness.  For a few moments the only sounds heard i=
n the room were the=20

ticking of the clock, the humming of the teakettle, and the shambling steps=
 of the bear as she=20

prowled about.  But both of the figures on the floor were unconscious of wh=

a bright stream of blood trickled from a deep cut in the man's forehead.  F=

hour?  Soft hour which=20

wakes the wish and melts the heart.  Royalty, followed, by the imperial pre=
sence of ambassadors,=20

and escorted by a group of dazzling duchesses and paladins of high degree, =
was ushered with=20

courteous pomp by the host and hostess into a choice saloon, hung with rose=
-coloured tapestry=20

and illumined by chandeliers of crystal, where they were served from gold p=
late. But the thousand=20

less favoured were not badly off, when they found themselves in the more ca=
pacious chambers,=20

into which they rushed with an eagerness hardly in keeping with the splendi=
d nonchalance of the=20

preceding hours.  =E2=80=98What a perfect family,=E2=80=99 exclaimed Hugo B=
ohun, as he extracted a couple of fat=20

little birds from their bed of aspic jelly; =E2=80=98everything they do in =
such perfect taste. How safe you=20

were here to have ortolans for supper!=E2=80=99  All the little round table=
s, though their number was infinite,=20

were full. Male groups hung about; some in attendance on fair dames, some f=
oraging for=20

themselves, some thoughtful and more patient and awaiting a satisfactory fu=
ture. Never was such=20

an elegant clatter.  =E2=80=98I wonder where Carisbrooke is,=E2=80=99 said =
Hugo Bohun. =E2=80=98They say he is wonderfully=20
