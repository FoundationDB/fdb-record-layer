Gnostics and others asserted that He was Nebu, the false Messiah, the destroyer of the old 

orthodox religion. "He is the founder of a new sect of Nazars," said other sectarians. In Hebrew the 

word "Naba" means "to speak by inspiration," ({~HEBREW LETTER NUN~}{~HEBREW LETTER 

BET~}{~HEBREW LETTER ALEF~}, and {~HEBREW LETTER NUN~}{~HEBREW LETTER 

BET~}{~HEBREW LETTER VAV~} is Nebo, the God of wisdom). But Nebo is also Mercury, who is 

Buddha in the Hindu monogram of planets. And this is shown by the fact that the Talmudists hold 

that Jesus was inspired by the Genius (or Regent) of Mercury confounded by Sir William Jones 

with Gautama Buddha. There are many other strange points of similarity between Gautama and 

Jesus, which cannot be noticed here.(671)  If both the Initiates, aware of the danger of furnishing

beat a retreat. There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood."  "Did you see nothing 

there?" asked the count.  "I thought I saw," said one of the servants, "horsemen dressed in yellow, 

creeping along the bed of the stream.  "That's it," said the tutor. "We have fallen in with a party of 

Spaniards. Come back, sirs, back."  The two youths looked at each other, and at this moment a 

pistol-shot and cries for help were heard. Another glance between the young men convinced them 

both that neither had any wish to go back, and as the tutor had already turned his horse's head, 

they both spurred forward, Raoul crying: "Follow me, Olivain!" and the Count de Guiche: "Follow, 

Urban and Planchet!" And before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had

dangerous portions of the Secret Knowledge untold, and lived to the ripe their steeds they held 

their pistols ready also. In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded, 

and then restraining their horses, they advanced cautiously.  "Hush," whispered De Guiche, "these

ever produced  "Can you see what they are doing?"  "Yes, they appear to be searching a 

wounded or dead man."  "It is some cowardly assassination," said De Guiche.  "They are soldiers, 

though," resumed De Bragelonne.  "Yes, skirmishers; that is to say, highway robbers."  "At them!"
