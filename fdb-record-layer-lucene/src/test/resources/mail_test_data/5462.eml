=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDuchess of Brecon!=E2=80=9D exclaimed both Miss Arundel=
 and Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI always admired the ladies,=E2=80=9D said =
Miss Arundel. =E2=80=9CWe met them at a _
passes beneath his thigh. There are two projecting pieces of leather, about=
 twelve inches apart,=20

upon the scabbard, between which the thigh of the horseman fits, and thus p=
revents the sword=20

from slipping from its place. Carried in this position at full speed, there=
 is an absence of that=20

absurd dangling and jumping of the sword that is exhibited in our British c=
avalry, and the weapon=20

seems to form a portion of the rider. The first action of an Arab when he d=
ismounts at a halt upon=20

 Lord Clanmorne to join us.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CI wish so, too,=E2=80=9D said the lady, =E2=80=9Cbut that is impos=
sible. He never will give up his hunting.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am sure=20

there are more foxes in the Campagna than at Vauxe,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. =
Jerome.  =E2=80=9CI suppose you=20

e size is three feet in=20

the length of blade, and one inch and seven-eighths in breadth; the hilt, f=
rom the top of the guard=20

to the extremity, five and a half inches. Thus the sword complete would be =
about three feet five or=20

six inches. Such a weapon possesses immense power, as the edge is nearly as=
 sharp as a razor.=20

But the Arabs have not the slightest knowledge of swordsmanship; they never=
