In the South the great streams of migration were those that flowed down the=
 Ohio, filling the back=20

lands on each side, and thence down the Mississippi to its mouth. Hence, in=
stead of pressing the=20

natives steadily backward from a single direction, as in the North, the whi=
tes hemmed them in on=20

east, west, and north; while to the southward the Gulf presented a relentle=
ss barrier. Powerful and=20

populous tribes were left high and dry in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama--=
peoples who in their=20

day of necessity could hope to find new homes only by long migrations past =
the settled river=20

districts that lay upon their western frontiers.  Of these encircled tribes=
, four were of chief=20

importance: the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, and the Chickasaws. In=
 1825 the Creeks=20

numbered twenty thousand, and held between five and six million acres of la=
nd in western Georgia=20

and eastern Alabama. The Cherokees numbered about nine thousand and had eve=
n greater=20

areas, mainly in northwestern Georgia, but to some extent also in northeast=
ern Alabama and=20

southeastern Tennessee. The Choctaws, numbering twenty-one thousand, and th=
e Chickasaws,=20

numbering thirty-six hundred, together held upwards of sixteen million acre=
s in Mississippi--

approximately the northern half of the State--and a million and a quarter a=
cres in western=20

Alabama. The four peoples thus numbered fifty-three thousand souls, and hel=
d ancestral lands=20

aggregating over thirty-three million acres, or nearly the combined area of=
 Pennsylvania and New=20

Jersey.  Furthermore, they were no longer savages. The Creeks were the lowe=
st in civilization; but=20

even they had vacillating woman whom we have seen in the preceding page or =
two. The officers=20

of her government in the various bailiwicks of Artois were usually well cho=
sen and reliable.=20

Appointed and paid by the countess and holding office at her pleasure, thes=
e baillis, recruited from=20

the ranks of the petty nobility and the bourgeoisie, had every incentive to=
 honesty and faithful=20

service. They were at once administrators, justices, and financial agents, =
and in the latter capacity=20

had to make reports, at Candlemas, at Ascension, and at All Saints, to the =
chief financial officer,=20

the receiver-general, who in turn submitted his accounts to Mahaut. She was=
 not infrequently in=20

dire need of money, for the expenses of her household were always large, an=
d she was burdened=20

by the debts left by Otho, but these she did at last manage to pay.  With t=
he aid of her officers,=20

upon whom she kept a close watch, Mahaut was prompt enough to repress any u=
nruly vassal who=20

went beyond the limits of law. Sometimes force was necessary, as when the S=
ire d'Oisy overran=20

and ravaged the lands of certain monasteries under Mahaut's protection and =
slew the peaceful=20

inhabitants. Summoned by the bailli to appear before her court, the sire at=
 first refused to admit the=20

bailli, then did admit him and kept him a prisoner. "Not a stone of his cha=
teau shall be left=20

standing," declared Mahaut, and she despatched a little army that soon brou=
ght the Sire d'Oisy to=20

reason. The punishments inflicted upon recalcitrant vassals were sometimes =
most severe and=20

sometimes fantastic. The seigneur himself is sometimes put to death when hi=
s crimes have been=20


_
A good while before Jackson entered the White House the future of these lar=
ge, settled, and=20

prosperous groups of red men began to trouble the people of Georgia, Alabam=
a, and other=20

Southern States. The Indians made but little use of the major part of their=
 land; vast tracts lay=20

untrodden save by hunters. Naturally, as the white population grew and the =
lands open for=20

settlement became scarcer and poorer, the rich tribal holdings were looked =
upon with covetous=20

eyes. In the decade following the War of 1812, when cotton cultivation was =
spreading rapidly over=20

the southern interior, the demand that they be thrown open for occupation t=
o white settlers=20

became almost irresistible.  Three things, obviously, could happen. The peo=
ple; or he is expelled=20

and deprived of his fief; or he is heavily fined and ordered to perform a p=
enitential pilgrimage. It is=20

thus that Jean de Gouves is condemned, in 1323, to undertake a pilgrimage t=
o the shrine of Saint-

Louis of Marseilles, to the tomb of the Apostles in Rome, and to two other =
Italian shrines; while, to=20

avoid possibility of deception on the part of this pious pilgrim, he is req=
uired to bring back a=20

certificate from each of the places visited.  If the punishments inflicted =
on rebellious vassals were=20

severe, what epithet shall we reserve for the punishments of the criminal c=
ode? The rack and the=20

stake are not unheard of during the reign of Mahaut, and these are the mild=
er forms of=20

punishment:=20


_
The State which felt the situation most keenly was Georgia, partly because =
there an older and=20

denser population pressed more eagerly for new lands, partly--it must be ad=
mitted--because lands=20

obtained by cession were, under the practice of that State, distributed amo=
ng the people by lottery.=20

The first move in this direction was to dispossess the Creeks. As far back =
as 1802, when Georgia=20

made her final cession of western lands to United States, the latter agreed=
 to extinguish the Indian=20

title to lands within the State whenever it could be done "peaceably and on=
 reasonable terms."=20

This pledge the Georgians never allowed the federal authorities to forget. =
After 1815 several large=20

tracts were liberated. But by that date the State wanted unbroken jurisdict=
ion over all of the=20

territory within her limits, and her complaints of laxness on the part of t=
he Federal Government in=20

bringing this about became no less frequent than vigorous.  Near the close =
of his Administration=20

President Monroe sent two commissioners to procure a general cession; and a=
t Indian Spring a=20

treaty was concluded in which the Creeks ceded practically all of their lan=
ds between the Flint and=20

the Chattahoochee rivers. The Senate ratified the treaty, and the Georgians=
 were elated. But=20

investigation showed that the Creeks who stood behind the agreement represe=
nted only an=20

insignificant fraction of the nation, and President Adams refused to allow =
Troup, the irate Georgian=20

Governor, to proceed with the intended occupation until further negotiation=
s should have taken=20

place. Stormy exchanges of views followed, in the course of which the Gover=
nor more than once=20

reminded Adams that Georgia was "sovereign on her own soil." But in 1826 an=
d 1827 treaties=20

were obtained finally extinguishing Creek titles in the State. Land west of=
 the Mississippi was=20

promised to all Creeks who would go there.  The problem of the Cherokees wa=
s more difficult. By=20

a series of treaties beginning in 1785 the United States had recognized thi=
s people as a nation,=20

capable of making peace and war, of owning the lands within its boundaries,=
 and of governing and=20

punishing its own citizens by its own laws. At the close of Jefferson's sec=
ond Administration the=20

tribe seriously considered moving west of the Mississippi, and shortly afte=
r the War of 1812 most=20

of the northern members resident in Tennessee took the long-deferred step. =
The refusal of the=20

Georgia members to go with the Tenneseeans disappointed the land-hungry whi=
tes, and from that=20

time the authorities of the State labored incessantly both to break down th=
e notion that the=20

Cherokees were a "nation" to be dealt with through diplomatic channels, and=
 to extend over them,=20

in effect, the full sovereignty of the State. In December, 1828, the Legisl=
ature took the bold step of=20

enacting that all white persons in the Cherokee territory should be subject=
 to the laws of Georgia;=20

that after June 1, 1830, all Indians resident in this territory should be s=
ubject to such laws as might=20

be prescribed for them by the State; and that after this date all laws made=
 by the Cherokee=20

Government should be women guilty of theft or of marital infidelity buried =
alive, miserable lepers=20

put to the torture,--these are but a few of the ingenious and barbarous pun=
ishments of which we=20

find record. But it is to be noted that Mahaut was not wantonly cruel or vi=
ndictive; the forms of=20

execution we have mentioned were the established practice of the day, with =
which no one=20

dreamed of interfering; so far from being heartless, Mahaut reduced the sev=
erity of the fines and=20

penalties in some cases and provided for the widows and orphans of some who=
 were sent to the=20

gallows, while she was always endeavoring to restrain the grasping proclivi=
ties of her tax-

gatherers and holding investigations whenever complaint of injustice reache=
d her ears.  With the=20

minor matters of her household economy we need not deal, since enough has b=
een said of the=20

manner of life of a mediaeval lady of rank. Suffice it to say that the _hot=
el_ of the Countess of=20



Artois was famous for its hospitality and that many of the great ones of th=
e earth sat down to her=20

table. With the fashionable world, the world of the court, Mahaut maintaine=
d very close relations,=20

since she was, in one way or another, related to most of the royal family a=
nd to the great nobles.=20

Whenever there was a marriage in these circles, there came a rich present f=
rom "Madame la=20

Comtesse d'Artois"; sometimes, as in the case of the daughter of her minist=
er, Thierry d'Hirecon, it=20

was practically a whole trousseau: "One scarlet robe, another of deep green=
 cloth, both lined and=20

bordered with fine furs; a mantle and a _cotte_ of cloth of gold, the forme=
r lined with fur; a robe of=20

Irish woollen; a coverlet of green cloth; a counterpane of _cendal_ (meanin=
g usually a heavy and=20

strong stuff, but sometimes silk); four green carpets and fifty ells of lin=
ens for sheets." Truly a=20

present of which any bride might be proud, though not so expensive, it appe=
ars, as the _nef_ (an=20

ornament for the table, shaped like a ship, and used to hold spices, extra =
spoons, etc.), and=20

costing one hundred and fifty pounds, given to "our niece, Marie d'Artois, =
on the occasion of her=20

marriage to Jean de Flandre, comte de Namur." Then, if her sovereign requir=
es her presence at=20

court, Mahaut equips herself and all her suite, gives presents to friends a=
nd dependents, and goes=20

up, it may be, to Rheims, as when Philippe le Long is to be crowned if he c=
an persuade enough of=20

the Peers of France to attend, and where few do attend, so that our Countes=
s Mahaut, a Peer of=20

France, has the privilege of holding the royal crown over the head of her s=
on-in-law. Or mayhap=20

the countess, wishing to keep friends with the great, sends a mess of fine =
herrings to the powerful=20

favorite, Enguerrand de Marigny, or to her own daughter, Queen Jeanne; or a=
 magnificent jewel of=20

enamelled silver, adorned with rubies and sculptured to represent a little =
king and queen, and=20

costing one hundred and thirty _livres parisis_, to be delivered to the rea=
l king and queen; or a=20

little statuette in enamelled silver, sustaining a shrine, to be presented =
to the widow of Philippe le=20

Hardi, Marie de Brabant, "de par la=20


_
When Jackson became President he found on his desk a vigorous protest again=
st this drastic=20

piece of legislation. But appeal to him was useless. He was on record as be=
lieving, in common=20

with most southwesterners, that Georgia had a rightful jurisdiction over he=
r Indian lands; and his=20

Secretary of War, Eaton, was instructed to say to the Cherokee representati=
ves that their people=20

would be expected either to yield to Georgia's authority or to remove beyon=
d the Mississippi. In his=20

first annual message, on December 8, 1829, the President set forth the prin=
ciples that guided him=20

from first to last in dealing with the Indian problem. It would be greatly =
to the interest of the Indians=20

themselves, he said, to remove to the ample lands that would be set apart f=
or them permanently in=20

the West, where each tribe could have its own home and its own government, =
subject to no control=20

by the United States except for the maintenance of peace  Mahaut spent in t=
his way a=20

considerable amount, besides purchasing for herself and her children variou=
s _objets d'art_,=20

statuettes, paintings, illuminated missals and other books, handsome cups a=
nd the like for her=20

table, and jewels and rich clothing in profusion. She was evidently a lady =
of taste, but also of=20

rather extravagant habits and fond of travelling; for she had carriages or =
vehicles of some sort in=20

plenty, and travelled on horseback when the state of the roads would not pe=
rmit the use either of=20

carriage or litter. With her retinue of servants and her carts loaded with =
baggage and provisions,=20

the countess could yet make the trip from Arras to Paris in three or four d=
ays.  But the time was=20

drawing nigh when all her journeyings would be at an end; and as she neared=
 the end of her=20

earthly pilgrimage fresh troubles came to disturb her in the lawful enjoyme=
nt of her heritage. After=20
