dracaena marginata of the church-yard wall? Why should these Franks be so h=
appy when she was childless? Why should all be sunshine with them when her =
sky was clouded with gloom? Nancy did not attempt to answer the question, b=

I had had time only to give instructions about sending a man with a key to =

the sound of the merry church-bells, chiming for the baptism of Franks's li=

nstructions about sending a man with a key to the station for my luggage, t=
o say that a lady would call, to reach my rooms, and to draw the curtains o=
ver the windows, _
whom it was intended. Ben Stone went on with his planing of the shelf and h=
is praise of the=20

school-master, his hand having a very different effect from his tongue; for=
 the more he planed, the=20

smoother grew the wood; while the more he praised, the rougher grew the tem=
per of Nancy. Ben=20

Stone saw this, and took a little malicious pleasure in stirring up the env=
y and jealousy of his=20

customer; for, though he was not one to break the peace himself, and had ne=
ver been known to=20

be either out of spirits or out of temper, Ben Stone was certainly not a ma=
n to be reckoned=20

amongst the peacemakers. He rather enjoyed "poking the fire in a neighbor's=
 grate," as he once=20

jestingly observed to his wife, and there was always plenty of dry fuel in =
Nancy's.  But why should=20

praise of Ned Franks be as gall and wormwood to the clerk's wife, seeing th=
at the one-armed=20

sailor, now with the baby. Two or three excitable Frenchmen just ahead also=
 attempted to turn,=20

thus nearly throwing the little man onto his knees. The large bag which he =
carried hit me across=20

the shins; in his terror he almost embraced me as he helped himself up: the=
 nurse, as she=20

stumbled, pitched forward onto my shoulder, and if I had not seized the how=
ling baby, it would=20

certainly have fallen under our feet.  My bowler was knocked over my eyes, =
and though an officer=20

of the boat cried the reassuring intelligence that it was a false alarm--th=
at the gangway was "all=20

right," and never had been anything but all right, I could not readjust my =
hat nor see what was=20

going on until the fat nurse had obligingly retrieved her charge, without a=
 word of thanks.  My first=20

thought was for the letter-case in my pocket, for I had a horrible idea tha=
t the scare might have=20

been got up for the=20


_
Colme, had never willingly wronged a person in his life, but was, on the co=
ntrary, ready to do a=20

good turn for any one? Nancy had never forgiven Ned for having been given t=
he place of school-

master, to which she thought her own husband better entitled.  Ned's appoin=
tment was, in her=20

eyes, a standing grievance, a shameful injustice, a cause for quarrelling, =
not only with him, but=20

with all the world. "As if a fellow who has been accustomed to purpose of r=
obbing me of it. But I=20

could feel its outline as plainly as ever under my coat, and decided, thank=
fully, that after all the=20

alarm had had nothing to do with me.  I had wired for a private cabin, thin=
king it would be well to=20

be out of the way of my fellow-passengers during the crossing: but the weat=
her had been rough for=20

a day or two (it was not yet the middle of April) and everything was alread=
y engaged; therefore I=20

walked the deck=20


_
old ropes, and running like a cat up the rigging, could be compared for one=
 moment with a man=20

like John Sands, who has been clerk for ten years in the parish, next to a =
parson, one might say,=20

and who can draw out a certificate of baptism or marriage in the neatest an=
d clearest of hands."=20

Not that Nancy had herself much veneration for her husband, or, if report s=
poke truly, treated him=20

with any kind of respect; but she did not choose that any one should be put=
 over his head, least of=20

all "that canting tar with a wooden arm," as she scornfully termed Ned Fran=
ks. Whenever Nancy=20

met the school-master, she scowled at him under her black brows, as if he h=
ad done her a wrong.=20

And she was never tired of speaking against him whenever she could get a li=
stener. Now she=20

spoke of the arts with which he had wheedled himself into the favor of Mr. =
Curtis, the vicar, though=20

every one knew that Ned was simple and straightforward as a child; then she=
 spoke of his violent=20

temper, pitied his wife, "poor unlucky soul!" from the bottom of her time, =
always conscious of the=20

unusual thickness of my breast pocket. The little man paced up and down, to=
o, though his yellow=20

face grew slowly green, and he would have been much better off below, lying=
 on his back. As for=20

the two others, they also remained on deck, talking together as they leaned=
 against the rail; but=20

though I passed them now and again, I noticed that the little man invariabl=
y avoided them by=20

turning before he reached their "pitch."  At the Gare du Nord I regretted t=
hat I had not carried my=20

own bag, because if I had it would have been examined on the boat, and all =
bother would have=20

been over. But rather than run any risks in the crowd thronging the _douane=
_, I decided to let the=20

suitcase look after itself, and send down for it with the key from the hote=
l later. Again the little man=20

was close to my side as I went in search of a cab, for all his things had b=
een gone through by the=20

custom house officer in mid-channel, so that he too was free to depart with=
out delay. He even=20

seemed to cling to me, somewhat=20


_
heart, though all in the village were aware that Persis Franks was one of t=
he happiest wives in the=20

world, and that if ever a young couple deserved the famous Dunmow flitch, s=
he and Ned might=20

have claimed it. The happiness of Persis was now as complete as earthly hap=
piness can be; for=20

after nearly three years of wedded life, the desire and prayer of her heart=
 had been granted,--she=20

had presented her first-born babe to his father. But this seemed a new grie=
vance to Nancy Sands.=20

Had not she, too, once had a did not, save for a "good evening, sir," as I =
separated myself from=20

him at last. He had stuck rather too close, elbow to elbow; but I had no fe=
ar for the letter-case, as=20

he was on the wrong side to play any conjurer's tricks with that. The last =
I saw of the fellow, he=20

was walking toward a cab, and looking uneasily over his shoulder at his two=
 late travelling=20

companions, who were getting into another vehicle near by.  I went straight=
 to the Elysee Palace=20

Hotel, where I had never stopped before--a long=20
