Master, Plato, that:       The Anima Mundi (or "world-soul") was not the De=
ity, but a=20

manifestation. Those philosophers never conceived of the One as an     _ani=
mate nature_. The=20

original One did not _exist_, as we     understand the term. Not till he (i=
t) had united with the many=20

emanated existences (the Monad and Duad), was a being produced.     The {~G=
REEK SMALL=20

MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK=20

SMALL LETTER NU~} ("honoured"), the something manifested, dwells in the    =
 centre as in the=20

circumference, but it is only the reflection of     the Deity--the World-So=
ul. In this doctrine we find=20

the spirit of     Esoteric Buddhism.(704)   And it is that of Esoteric Brah=
manism and of the Vedantin=20

Adwaitis. The two modern philosophers, Schopenhauer and von Hartmann, teach=
 the same ideas.=20

The Occultists say that:       The psychic and ectenic forces, the "ideo-mo=
tor" and "electro-=20

biological powers," "latent thought," and even "unconscious     cerebration=
" theories can be=20

condensed in two words: the     Kabalistic Astral Light.(705)   Schopenhaue=
r only synthesized all=20

this by calling it Will, and contradicted the men of Science in their mater=
ialistic views, as von=20

Hartmann did later on. The author of the _Philosophy of the Unconscious_ ca=
lls their views "an=20

instinctual prejudice."       Furthermore, he demonstrates that no experime=
nter can have=20

anything to do with matter properly so termed, but only with the     forces=
 into which he divides it.=20

The visible effects of matter are     but the effects of force. He conclude=
s thereby that that which is=20

now called matter is nothing but the aggregation of atomic forces,     to e=
xpress which the word=20

"matter" is used; outside of that, for     science, matter is but a word vo=
id of sense.(706)   As much,=20

it is to be feared, as those other terms with which we are now concerned, "=
Space," "Nirvana," and=20

so on.       The bold theories and opinions expressed in Schopenhauer's wor=
ks     differ widely=20

from those of the majority of our orthodox     scientists.(707) "In reality=
," remarks this daring=20

speculator,     "there is neither _Matter_ nor _Spirit_. The tendency to   =
  gravitation in a stone is as=20

unexplainable as thought in the human     brain.... If matter can--no one k=
nows why--fall to the=20

ground, then     it can also--no one knows why--think.... As soon, even in =
mechanics,     as we=20

trespass beyond the purely mathematical, as soon as we reach     the inscru=
table adhesion,=20

gravitation, and so on we are faced by     phenomena which are to our sense=
s as mysterious as=20

the _will_ and     _thought_ in man: we find ourselves facing the incompreh=
ensible,     for such is=20

every force in nature. Where is, then, that _matter_     which you all pret=
end to know so well, and=20

from which--being so     familiar with it--you draw all your conclusions an=
d explanations,     and=20

attribute to it all things?... That which can be fully     realized by our =
reason and senses is but the=20

superficial; they can     never reach the true inner substance of things. S=
uch was the     opinion of=20

Kant. If you consider that there is in a human head     some sort of a _spi=
rit_, then you are obliged=20

to concede the same     to a stone. If your dead and utterly-passive matter=
 can manifest a=20

tendency toward gravitation or, like electricity, attract and     repel and=
 send out sparks then as=20

well as the brain it can also     think. In short, every particle of the so=
-called spirit we can     replace=20

with an equivalent of matter, and every particle of matter     replace with=
 spirit.... Thus, it is not the=20

Christian division of     all things into matter and spirit that can ever b=
e found     philosophically=20

exact; but only if we divide them into _will_ and     _manifestation_, whic=
h form of division has=20

naught to do with the     former, for it spiritualizes everything: all that=
 which is in the     first instance=20



real and objective--body and matter--it transforms     into a representatio=
n, and every manifestation=20

into will."(708)   The _matter_ of science may be for all objective purpose=
s a "dead and utterly-

passive matter"; to the Occultist not an atom of it can be dead--"Life is e=
ver present in it." We send=20

the reader who would know more about it to our article, "Transmigration of =
Life-Atoms."(709) What=20

we are now concerned with is the doctrine of Nirvana.  A "system of atheism=
" it may be justly=20

called, since it recognizes neither God nor Gods--least of all a Creator, a=
s it entirely rejects=20

creation. The _Fecit ex nihilo_ is as incomprehensible to the Occult metaph=
ysical Scientist as it is=20

to the scientific Materialist. It is at this point that all agreement stops=
 between the two. But if such=20

be the sin of the Buddhist and Brahman Occultist, then Pantheists and Athei=
sts, and also theistical=20

Jews--the Kabalists--must also plead "guilty" to it; yet no one would ever =
think of calling the=20

Hebrews of the Kabalah "Atheists." Except the Talmudistic and Christian exo=
teric systems there=20

never was a religious Philosophy, whether in the ancient or modern world, b=
ut rejected _a priori_=20

the _ex nihilo_ hypothesis, simply because Matter was always co- eternalize=
d with Spirit.  Nirvana,=20

as well as the Moksha of the Vedantins, is regarded by most of the Oriental=
ists as a synonym of=20

annihilation; yet no more glaring injustice could be done, and this capital=
 error must be pointed out=20

and disproved. On this most important tenet of the Brahmo-Buddhistic system=
--the Alpha and the=20

Omega of "Being" or "Non-Being"--rests the whole edifice of Occult Metaphys=
ics. Now the=20

rectification of the great error concerning Nirvana may be very easily acco=
mplished with relation to=20

the philosophically inclined, to those who,       In the glass of things te=
mporal see the image of=20

things spiritual.   On the other hand, to that reader who could never soar =
beyond the details of=20

tangible material form, our explanation will appear meaningless. He may com=
prehend and even=20

accept the logical inferences from the reasons given--the true spirit will =
ever escape his intuitions.=20

The word "nihil" having been misconceived from the first, it is continually=
 used as a sledge-

hammer in the matter of Esoteric Philosophy. Nevertheless it is the duty of=
 the Occultist to try and=20

explain it.  Nirvana and Moksha, then, as said before, have their being in =
non-being, if such a=20

paradox be permitted to illustrate the meaning the better. Nirvana, as some=
 illustrious Orientalists=20

have attempted to prove, does mean the "blowing-out"(710) of all sentient e=
xistence. It is like the=20

flame of a candle burnt out to its last atom, and then suddenly extinguishe=
d. Quite so.=20

Nevertheless, as the old Arhat Nagasena affirmed before the king who taunte=
d him: "Nirvana=20

_is_"--and Nirvana is eternal. But the Orientalists deny this, and say it i=
s not so. In their opinion=20

Nirvana is not a re-absorption in the Universal Force, not eternal bliss an=
d rest, but it means=20

literally "the blowing-out, the extinction, complete annihilation, and not =
absorption." The=20

_Lankavatara_ quoted in support of their arguments by some Sanskritists, an=
d which gives the=20

different interpretations of Nirvana by the Tirthika Brahmans, is no author=
ity to one who goes to=20

primeval sources for information, namely, to the Buddha who taught the doct=
rine. As well quote=20

the Charvaka Materialists in their support.  If we bring as an argument the=
 sacred Jaina books,=20

wherein the dying Gautama Buddha is thus addressed: "Arise into Nirvi [Nirv=
ana] from this=20

decrepit body into which thou hast been sent.... Ascend into thy former abo=
de, O blessed=20

Avatara"; and if we add that this seems to us the very opposite of nihilism=
, we may be told that so=20

far it may only prove a contradiction, one more discrepancy in the Buddhist=
 faith. If again we=20

remind the reader that since Gautama is believed to appear occasionally, re=
-descending from his=20

"former abode" for the good of humanity and His faithful congregation, thus=
 making it incontestable=20



that Buddhism does not teach final annihilation, we shall be referred to au=
thorities to whom such=20

teaching is ascribed. And let us say at once: Men are no authority for us i=
n questions of=20

conscience, nor ought they to be for anyone else. If anyone holds to Buddha=
's Philosophy, let him=20

do and say as Buddha did and said; if a man calls himself a Christian, let =
him follow the=20

commandments of Christ--not the interpretations of His many dissenting prie=
sts and sects.  In _A=20

Buddhist Catechism_ the question is asked:       Are there any dogmas in Bu=
ddhism which we are=20

required to accept     on faith?      A. No. We are earnestly enjoined to  =
"Oh!" cried the executioner,=20

"all! all! all!"  "Answer, then. If she seduced your brother--you said she =
seduced him, did you not?"=20

"Yes."  "If she caused his death--you said that she caused his death?"  "Ye=
s," repeated the=20

executioner.  "Then you must know what her name was as a young girl."  "Oh,=
 mon Dieu!" cried=20

the executioner, "I think I am dying. Absolution, father! absolution."  "Te=
ll me her name and I will=20

give it."  "Her name was----My God, have pity on me!" murmured the executio=
ner; and he fell back=20

on the bed, pale, trembling, and apparently about to die.  "Her name!" repe=
ated the monk, bending=20

over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it; "her nam=
e! Speak, or no=20

absolution!"  The dying man collected all his forces.  The monk's eyes glit=
tered.  "Anne de Bueil,"=20

murmured the wounded man.  "Anne de Bueil!" cried the monk, standing up and=
 lifting his hands=20

to Heaven. "Anne de Bueil! You said Anne de Bueil, did you not?"  "Yes, yes=
, that was her name;=20

and now absolve me, for I am dying."  "I, absolve you!" cried the priest, w=
ith a laugh which made=20

the dying man's hair stand on end; "I, absolve you? I am not a priest."  "Y=
ou are not a priest!" cried=20

the executioner. "What, then, are you?"  "I am about to tell you, wretched =
man."  "Oh, mon Dieu!"=20

"I am John Francis de Winter."  "I do not know you," said the executioner. =
 "Wait, wait; you are=20

going to know me. I am John Francis de Winter," he repeated, "and that woma=
n----"  "Well, that=20

woman?"  "Was my mother!"  The executioner uttered the first cry, that terr=
ible cry which had been=20

first heard.  "Oh, pardon me, pardon me!" he murmured; "if not in the name =
of God, at least in your=20

own name; if not as priest, then as son."  "Pardon you!" cried the pretende=
d monk, "pardon you!=20

Perhaps God will pardon you, but I, never!"  "For pity's sake," said the ex=
ecutioner, extending his=20

arms.  "No pity for him who had no pity! Die, impenitent, die in despair, d=
ie and be damned!" And=20

drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the=
 wounded man, saying,=20

"Here is my absolution!"  Then was heard that second cry, not so loud as th=
e first and followed by=20

a long groan.  The executioner, who had lifted himself up, fell back upon h=
is bed. As to the monk,=20

without withdrawing the poniard from the wound, he ran to the window, opene=
d it, leaped out into=20

the flowers of a small garden, glided onward to the stable, took out his mu=
le, went out by a back=20

gate, ran to a neighbouring thicket, threw off his monkish garb, took from =
his valise the complete=20

habiliment of a cavalier, clothed himself in it, went on foot to the first =
post, secured there a horse=20

and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris.     33. Grimaud Speak=
s.   Grimaud was left=20

alone with the executioner, who in a few moments opened his eyes.  "Help, h=
elp," he murmured;=20

"oh, God! have I not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to=
 live or to die?"  "Take=20

courage," said Grimaud; "they are gone to find assistance."  "Who are you?"=
 asked the wounded=20

man, fixing his half opened eyes on Grimaud.  "An old acquaintance," replie=
d Grimaud.  "You?"=20

and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before =
him.  "Under what=20

circumstances did we meet?" he asked again.  "One night, twenty years ago, =
my master fetched=20

you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentieres."  "I know you well now,"=
 said the=20



executioner; "you were one of the four grooms."  "Just so."  "Where do you =
come from now?"  "I=20

was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse. They told me the e=
xecutioner of Bethune=20

was here and wounded, when you uttered two piercing cries. At the first we =
ran to the door and at=20

the second forced it open."  "And the monk?" exclaimed the executioner, "di=
d you see the monk?"=20

"What monk?"  "The monk that was shut in with me."  "No, he was no longer h=
ere; he appears to=20

have fled by the window. Was he the man that stabbed you?"  "Yes," said the=
 executioner.=20

Grimaud moved as if to leave the room.  "What are you going to do?" asked t=
he wounded man.=20

"He must be apprehended."  "Do not attempt it; he has revenged himself and =
has done well. Now I=20

may hope that God will forgive me, since my crime is expiated."  "Explain y=
ourself." said Grimaud.=20

"The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill----"  "Milady?"  =
"Yes, Milady; it is=20

true you called her thus."  "What has the monk to do with this Milady?"  "S=
he was his mother."=20

Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner.  =
"His mother!" he=20

repeated.  "Yes, his mother."  "But does he know this secret, then?"  "I mi=
stook him for a monk and=20

revealed it to him in confession."  "Unhappy man!" cried Grimaud, whose fac=
e was covered with=20

sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause; "=
unhappy man, you=20

named no one, I hope?"  "I pronounced no name, for I knew none, except his =
mother's, as a young=20

girl, and it was by this name that he recognized her, but he knows that his=
 uncle was among her=20

judges."  Thus speaking, he fell back exhausted. Grimaud, wishing to reliev=
e him, advanced his=20

hand toward the hilt of the dagger.  "Touch me not!" said the executioner; =
"if this dagger is=20

withdrawn I shall die."  Grimaud remained with his hand extended; then, str=
iking his forehead, he=20

exclaimed:  "Oh! if this man should ever discover the names of the others, =
my master is lost."=20

"Haste! haste to him and warn him," cried the wounded man, "if he still liv=
es; warn his friends, too.=20

My death, believe me, will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure." =
 "Where was the monk=20

going?" asked Grimaud.  "Toward Paris."  "Who stopped him?"  "Two young gen=
tlemen, who were=20

on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his compa=
nion mention--the=20

Viscount de Bragelonne."  "And it was this young man who brought the monk t=
o you? Then it was=20

the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so a=
wful," continued Grimaud.=20

"And yet that woman deserved her fate; do you not think so?"  "On one's dea=
th-bed the crimes of=20

others appear very small in comparison with one's own," said the executione=
r; and falling back=20

exhausted he closed his eyes.  Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone=
 and yet he=20

perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Co=
mte de la Fere. Whilst he=20

thus hesitated the host re-entered the room, followed not only by a surgeon=
, but by many other=20

persons, whom curiosity had attracted to the spot. The surgeon approached t=
he dying man, who=20

seemed to have fainted.  "We must first extract the steel from the side," s=
aid he, shaking his head=20

in a significant manner.  The prophecy which the wounded man had just utter=
ed recurred to=20

Grimaud, who turned away his head. The weapon, as we have already stated, w=
as plunged into=20

the body to the hilt, and as the surgeon, taking it by the end, drew it for=
th, the wounded man=20

opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful. When at =
last the blade had=20

been entirely withdrawn, a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded m=
an and a stream of=20

blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath; then, fi=
xing his eyes upon=20

Grimaud with a singular expression, the dying man uttered the last death-ra=
ttle and expired.  Then=20

Grimaud, lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along =
the room, to the horror=20



of all present, made a sign to the host to follow him, paid him with a gene=
rosity worthy of his=20

master and again mounted his horse. Grimaud's first intention had been to r=
eturn to Paris, but he=20

remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul, an=
d reflecting that=20

there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter=
 of an hour's riding=20

would unite them, and that the going, returning and explanation would not o=
ccupy an hour, he put=20

spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazi=
ngarbe.  Raoul was=20

seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor, when all at once th=
e door opened and=20

Grimaud presented himself, travel-stained, dirty, and sprinkled with the bl=
ood of the unhappy=20

executioner.  "Grimaud, my good Grimaud!" exclaimed Raoul "here you are at =
last! Excuse me,=20

sirs, this is not a servant, but a friend. How did you leave the count?" co=
ntinued he. "Does he=20

regret me a little? Have you seen him since I left him? Answer, for I have =
many things to tell you,=20

too; indeed, the last three days some odd adventures have happened--but wha=
t is the matter?=20

how pale you are! and blood, too! What is this?"  "It is the blood of the u=
nfortunate man whom you=20

left at the inn and who died in my arms."  "In your arms?--that man! but kn=
ow you who he was?"=20

"He used to be the headsman of Bethune."  "You=20

or taught by sages. Our=20

Lord Buddha has said that we     must not believe in a thing said merely be=
cause it is said; nor=20

traditions because they have been handed down from antiquity; nor     rumou=
rs, as such; nor=20

spect to have been=20

nor from     inferences drawn=20

ers. But we are to=20

n lot; even an=20

executioner is not exempted. I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw hi=
s wound, and since=20

he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion, too, that death would=
 follow."  At the=20

mention of the monk, Grimaud became pale.  "Come, come," continued D'Arming=
es, "to dinner;"=20

for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or s=
ensibility to interfere=20

with a repast.  "You are right, sir," said Raoul. "Come, Grimaud, order din=
ner for yourself and when=20

you have rested a little we can talk."  "No, sir, no," said Grimaud. "I can=
not stop a moment; I must=20

start for Paris again immediately."  "What? You start for Paris? You are mi=
