Mathematician without spirituality, however great he may be, will not reach Metaphysics; but the 

Metaphysician will master the highest conceptions of Mathematics, and will apply them, without 

learning the latter. To a born Metaphysician the Psychic Plane will not be of much account: he will 

see its errors immediately he enters it, inasmuch as it is not the thing he seeks. With respect to 

Music and other Arts, they are the children of either the Manasic or Kama-Manasic Principle, 

proportionately as Soul or technicality predominates.    Karma.   After each incarnation, when the 

Manasic Ray returns to its Father, the Ego, some of its atoms remain behind and scatter. These 

Manasic atoms, Tanhic and other "causes," being of the same nature as the Manas, are attracted 

to it by strong bonds of affinity, and on the reincarnation of the Ego are unerringly attracted to it 

and constitute its Karma. Until these are all gathered up, the individuality is not free from rebirth. 

The Higher Manas is responsible for the Ray it sends forth. If the Ray be not soiled, no bad Karma 

is generated.    The Turiya State.   You should bear in mind that, in becoming Karma-less, good 

Karma, as well as bad, has to be gotten rid of, and that Nidanas, started towards the acquisition of 

good Karma, are as binding as those induced in the other direction. For both about to issue some 

violent command. He approached her and said in a low voice:  "Has your majesty still confidence 

in me?"  This voice startled her. "Yes, sir," she replied, "every confidence; speak."  "Will the queen 

deign to follow my advice?"  "Speak."  "Let your majesty dismiss M. de Comminges and desire him 

to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables."  Comminges glanced at 

D'Artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up.  "You 

hear, Comminges?" said the queen.  D'Artagnan went up to him; with his usual quickness he 

caught the anxious glance.  "Monsieur de Comminges," he said, "pardon me; we both are 

servants of the queen, are we not? It is my turn to be of use to her; do not envy me this 

happiness."  Comminges bowed and left.  "Come," said D'Artagnan to himself, "I have got one 

more enemy."  "And now," said the queen, addressing D'Artagnan, "what is to be done? for you 

hear that, instead of becoming calmer, the noise increases."  "Madame," said D'Artagnan, "the 

people want to see the king and they must see him."  "What! must see him! Where--on the 

balcony?"  "Not at all, madame, but here, sleeping in his bed."  "Oh, your majesty," exclaimed 

Laporte, "Monsieur d'Artagnan is right."  The queen became thoughtful and smiled, like a woman 

to whom duplicity is no

Yogis cannot attain the Turiya state unless the Triangle is separated from the Quaternary. 

Mahat.   Mahat is the manifested universal Parabrahmic Mind (for one Manvantara) on the Third 

Plane [of Kosmos]. It is the Law whereby the Light falls from plane to plane and differentiates. The 

Manasaputras are its emanations.  Man alone is capable of conceiving the Universe on this plane 

of existence.  Existence _is_; but when the entity does not feel it, for that entity it is not. The pain 

of an operation exists, though the patient does not feel it, and for the patient it is not.    How To 

Advance.   _Q. What is the correct pronunciation of AUM?_  _A._ It should first be practised 

physically, always at the same pitch, which must be discovered in the same way as the particular 

colour of the student is found, for each has his own tone.  AUM consists of two vowels and one 

semi-vowel, which latter must be prolonged. Just as Nature has its Fa, so each man has his: man 

being differentiated from Nature. The body may be compared to an instrument and the Ego to the 

player. You begin by producing effects on yourself; then little by little you learn to play on the 

Tattvas and Principles; learn first the notes, then the chords, then the melodies. Once the student 

is master of every chord, he may begin to be a co-worker with Nature and for others. He may then, 

by the experience he has gained of his own nature, and by the knowledge of the chords, strike 

such as will be beneficial in another, and so will serve as a keynote  "Without doubt," she 

murmured.  "Monsieur Laporte," said D'Artagnan, "go and announce to the people through the 

grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king, 

but they shall see him in bed; add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep 

silence, so as not to awaken him."  "But not every one; a deputation of two or four people."  "Every 

one, madame."  "But reflect, they will keep us here till daybreak."  "It shall take but a quarter of an 

hour, I answer for everything, madame; believe me, I know the people; they are like a great child, 

who only wants humoring. Before the sleeping king they will be mute, gentle and timid as lambs." 

"Go, Laporte," said the queen.  The young king approached his mother and said, "Why do as 

these people ask?"  "It must be so, my son," said Anne of Austria.  "But if they say, 'it must be' to 

me, am I no longer king?"  The queen remained silent.  "Sire," said D'Artagnan, "will your majesty 

permit me to ask you a question?"  Louis XIV. turned around, astonished that any one should dare 

to address him. But the queen pressed the child's hand.  "Yes, sir." he said.  "Does your majesty 

remember, when playing in the park of Fontainebleau, or in the palace courts at Versailles, ever to 

have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder?"  "Yes, certainly."  "Well, 

then, this noise of thunder, however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing, has 

said, 'go in, sire. You must do

Try to have a clear representation of the geometrical triangle on every plane, the conception 

gradually growing more metaphysical, and ending with the subjective Triangle, Atma-Buddhi-

Manas. It is only by the knowledge of this Triangle under all forms that you can succeed, _e.g._ in 

enclosing the past and the future in the present. Remember that you have to merge the 

Quaternary in the Triangle. The Lower Manas is drawn upwards, with the Kama, Prana and Linga, 

leaving only the physical body behind, the lower reinforcing the higher.  Advance may be made in 

Occultism even in Devachan, if the Mind and Soul be set thereon during life; but it is only as in a 

dream, and the knowledge will fade away as memory of a dream fades, unless it be kept alive by 

conscious study.    Fear And Hatred.   Fear and hatred are essentially one and the same. He who 

fears nothing will never hate, and he who hates nothing will never fear.    The Triangle.   _Q. What 

is the meaning of the phrase: __"__Form a clear image of the Triangle on every plane;__"_ _e.g._, 

_on the Astral Plane, what should one think of as the Triangle?_  _A._ [H. P. B. asked whether the 

question signified the meaning of the Triangle or the way to represent the Triangle on the "screen 

of light." The questioner explaining that the latter was the meaning, H. P. B. said that] it was only 

in the Turiya state, the fourth of the seven steps of Raja Yoga that the Yogi can represent to 

himself that which is abstract. Below this state, the perceptive power, being conditioned, must 

have some form to contemplate; it cannot represent to itself the Arupa. In the Turiya state the 

Triangle is in yourself and is felt. Below the Turiya state there must be a symbol to represent 

Atma-Buddhi-Manas. It is not a mere geometrical Triangle, but the Triad imaged, to make thought 

possible. Of this Triad, we can make some kind of representation  "Certainly, sir; but they tell me 

that the noise of thunder is the voice of God."  "Well then, sire," continued D'Artagnan, "listen to 

the noise of the people; you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder."  In truth at that 

moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze; then all at once it ceased. 

"Hold, sire," said D'Artagnan, "they have just told the people that you are asleep; you see, you still 

are king."  The queen looked with surprise at this strange man, whose brilliant courage made him 

the equal of the bravest, and who was, by his fine and quick intelligence, the equal of the most 

astute.  Laporte entered.  "Well, Laporte?" asked the queen.  "Madame," he replied, "Monsieur 

d'Artagnan's prediction has been accomplished; they are calm, as if by enchantment. The doors 

are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here."  "Laporte," said the queen, "suppose 

you put one of your sons in the king's place; we might be off during the time."  "If your majesty 

desires it," said Laporte, "my sons, like myself, are at the queen's service."  "Not at all," said 

D'Artagnan; "should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute, all would be 

lost."  "You are right, sir, always right," said Anne of Austria. "Laporte, place the king in bed." 

Laporte placed the king, dressed as he was, in the bed and then covered him as far as the 

shoulders with the sheet. The queen bent over him and kissed his brow.  "Pretend to sleep, Louis," 

said she.  "Yes," said the king, "but I do not wish to be touched by any of those men."  "Sire, I am 

here," said D'Artagnan, "and I give you my word, that if a single man has the audacity, his life shall 

pay for it."  "And now what is to be done?" asked the queen, "for I hear them."  "Monsieur Laporte, 

go to them and again recommend silence. Madame, wait at the door, whilst I shall be at the head 

of

indistinct; while of Atma no image can be formed. We must try to represent the Triangle to 

ourselves on higher and higher planes. We must figure Manas as overshadowed by Buddhi, and 

immersed in Atma. Only Manas, the Higher Ego, can be represented; we may think it as the 

Augoeides, the radiant figure in _Zanoni_. A very good Psychic might see this.    Psychic Vision. 

Psychic vision, however, is not to be desired, since Psyche is earthly and evil. More die for him." 

Laporte went out; the queen remained standing near the hangings, whilst D'Artagnan glided 

behind the curtains.  Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard, and 

the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips.  On seeing the 

queen, the men stopped short, respectfully.  "Enter, gentlemen, enter," said the queen.  There was 

then amongst that crowd a moment's hesitation, which looked

understood; Psychism has in it nothing that is spiritual. Science is right on its own plane, from its 

own standpoint. The law of the Conservation of Energy implies that psychic motion is generated 

by motion. Psychic motion being only motion on the Psychic Plane, a material plane, the 

Psychologist is right who sees in it nothing beyond matter. Animals have no Spirit, but they have 

psychic vision, and are sensitive to psychic thwarted, to have to force the gates, to overturn the 

guards. The gates had opened of themselves, and the king, ostensibly at least, had no other guard 

at his bed-head but his mother. The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back. 

"Enter, gentlemen," said Laporte, "since the queen desires you so to do."  Then one more bold 

than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe. This example was
