philodendron monstera cottages would have preached loud enough of itself." =
 Persis and Ned could have told where that one little bit of gold had come =
from, and why it was that a certain hearth-rug with a pattern of lilies and=
 roses which had taken the fancy of the the world had given, she was infini=

 why it was that a certain hearth-rug with a pattern of lilies and roses wh=

crazy old hulks seaworthy. "They need to be hauled into a dry dock, and rig=
ged out new:" such=20

was the one-armed sailor's oft expressed opinion, and it was one which no o=
ne could contradict.=20

"Everything seemed against our having a good collection to-day," remarked P=
ersis; "our old=20

baronet dead, and his lady away, dear Mrs. Lane absent in France, and, wors=
t of all, our vicar still=20

so ill, and unable to preach the sermon himself. His nephew the curate is v=
ery nice, but--but of=20

course it is not the same thing."  "I'm afraid that half the people did not=
 hear Mr. Leyton, and half of=20

those who did would not understand him," observed Ned Franks; "yet he gave =
us true gospel=20

sermons; there was nothing to find fault within the matter, and one shouldn=
't be too nice about the=20

manner."  "Mr. Leyton is so young and shy," said Persis, "he cannot speak w=
ith authority like his=20

uncle, and then he scarcely knows any of us yet; but I dare say that when h=
e gets courage--"  "I'll=20

be bound you're talking of our young parson," exclaimed a jovial voice, as =
the door of the school-

master's little room was thrown open, and Ben Stone, the stout carpenter, e=
ntered. Ben Stone=20

always considered himself a privileged person, and usually omitted tapping =
for admittance. "I=20

never care to knock," quoth the jovial carpenter, "unless I've a hammer in =
my hand, and a nail to=20

drive in, and then there's a knocking and no mistake." Stone came in, nodde=
d a good-evening to=20

Persis, and taking possession of a chair by the fire, as if he felt perfect=
ly at home, he stretched out=20

his broad hands to the cheerful blaze, for the weather was rather cold.  "Y=
ou were talking of=20

Commisaire, for I've been taught, as a servant of the public, to be civil t=
o my fellow servants, even=20

if they should be unreasonable. No? You don't want to see my rings? Let me =
oblige you by taking=20

off my hat, then. I might have put the thing--whatever it is--in my hair." =
 As she spoke, she drew=20

out her hatpins, still laughing in a half scornful, half good-natured way. =
She was bewitching as she=20

stood smiling, with her black hat and veil in her hand, the ruffled waves o=
f her dark red hair=20

shadowing her forehead.  Meanwhile, fired by her example, I turned out the =
contents of my=20

pockets: a letter or two; a flat gold cigarette case; a match box; my watch=
, and a handkerchief:=20

also in an outer pocket of my coat, a small bit of crumpled paper of which =
I had no recollection: but=20

as one of the gendarmes politely picked it up from the floor, where it had =
fallen, and handed it to=20

me without examining it, mechanically I slipped it back into the pocket, an=
d thought no more of it at=20

the time. There were too many other things to think of, and I was wondering=
 what on earth Maxine=20

could have done with the letter-case. She had had no more than two seconds =
in which to dispose=20

of it, hardly enough, it seemed to me, to pass it from one hand to another,=
 yet apparently it was=20

well hidden.  "Now, are you satisfied?" she asked, "Now that we have both s=
hown you we have=20

nothing to conceal; or would you like to take me to the police station, and=
 have some dreadful=20

female search me more thoroughly still? I'll go with you, if you wish. I wo=
n't even he indiscreet=20

enough to ask questions, since you seem inclined to do what we've no need t=
o do--keep your=20


_
conjure money out of folks' pockets. Did you ever hear such a sermon? What =
had all the silver and=20

gold, and shittim wood, and precious onyx-stones, that he talked of, to do =
with repairing a set of=20

old almshouses? Our people might open their eyes wide at his grand words, b=
ut they kept their=20

purses close shut, I take it."  "The sermon had plenty of meaning; there ha=
d been much study=20

spent upon it," observed Franks, who disliked criticism on preachers, and w=
ho had besides a=20

kindly feeling towards the young Curate of Colme.  "Meaning! Oh, I dare say=
, if one could get at it,"=20

measures you'll take them at once, for as you may possibly be aware, this i=
s the first night of my=20

new play, and I should be sorry to be late."  The Commissary of Police look=
ed fixedly at Maxine for=20

a moment, as if he would read her soul.  "No, Mademoiselle," he said, "I am=
 convinced that neither=20

you nor Monsieur are concealing anything about your persons. I will not tro=
uble you further until=20

we have searched the room."  Maxine could not blanch, for already she was a=
s white as she will=20

be when she lies in her coffin. But though her expression did not change, I=
 saw that the=20


_
carpenter; "but when one wants to give a loaf of bread to a hungry man, one=
 does not generally=20

stick it at the top of a pole; there's not every one as can climb as you do=
, Ned Franks, or bring=20

down onyx-stones and shittim wood to patch up rotten deal timbers. Why, the=
re was but one little=20

bit of gold to-day in the plate, and a scanty sprinkling of silver, though =
one might have thought the=20

state of those control her muscles; but she could not control the beating o=
f the blood in her brain. I=20

felt that she was conscious of this betrayal, under the gaze of the policem=
an, and she laughed to=20

distract his attention. My heart ached for her. I thought of a meadow-lark =
manoeuvering to hide the=20

place where her nest lies. Poor, beautiful Maxine! In spite of her pride, h=
er high courage, the=20

veneer of hardness which=20
