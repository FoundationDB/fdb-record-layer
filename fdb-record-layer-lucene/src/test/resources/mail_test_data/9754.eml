the orchestra who had struck the measure of the first figure of a contredan=
se sounded like fairy-

music, distant, unreal in their ears. Only their love was real, their joy i=
n one another's company,=20

their hands clasped closely together!  "Tell me," she said after awhile, "h=
ow it all came about. It is=20

all so terribly sudden ... so exquisitely sudden. I was prepared of course =
... but not so soon ... and=20

certainly not to-night. Tell me just how it happened."  She spoke English q=
uite fluently, with just a=20

charming slight accent, which he thought the most adorable thing he had eve=
r heard.  "You see,=20

dear heart," he replied, and there was a quiver of intense feeling in his v=
oice as he spoke, "there is=20

a man who not only is the friend whom I love best in all the world, but is =
also the one whom I trust=20

absolutely, more than myself. Two hours ago he sent for me and told me that=
 grave danger=20

threatened you--threatened our love and our happiness, and he begged me to =
urge you to consent=20

to a secret marriage ... at once ... to-night."  "And you think this ... th=
is friend knew?"  "I know," he=20

replied earnestly, "that he knew, or he would not have spoken to me as he d=
id. He knows that my=20

whole life is in your exquisite hands--he knows that our happiness is someh=
ow threatened by that=20

man Martin-Roget. How he obtained that information I could not guess ... he=
 had not the time or=20

the inclination to tell me. I flew to make all arrangements for our marriag=
e to-night and prayed to=20

God--as I have never prayed in my life before--that you, dear heart, would =
deign to consent."=20

"How could I refuse when Lady Blakeney advised? She is the kindest and dear=
est friend I=20

possess. She and your friend ought to know one another. Will you not tell m=
e who he is?"  "I will=20

present him to you, dear heart, as soon as we are married," he replied with=
 awkward evasiveness.=20

Then suddenly he exclaimed with boyish enthusiasm: "I can't believe it! I c=
an't believe it! It is the=20

most extraordinary thing in the world...."  "What is that, milor?" she aske=
d.  "That you should have=20

cared for me at all. For of course you must care, or you wouldn't be sittin=
g here with me now ...=20

you would not have consented ... would you?"  "You know that I do care, mil=
or," she said in her=20

grave quiet way. "How could it be otherwise?"  "But I am so stupid and so s=
low," he said naively.=20

"Why! look at me now. My heart is simply bursting with all that I want to s=
ay to you, but I just can't=20

find the words, and I do nothing but talk rubbish and feel how you must des=
pise me."  Once more=20

that humorous little smile played for a moment round Yvonne de Kernogan's s=
erious always get=20

the best of it.  Nevertheless, it is my opeenion that we've had treebulatio=
n enough in Rud Ruver=20

since we came oot, an' I would be ferry gled of a luttle prosperity now--if=
 only by way of a pleesant=20

change."  Recurring to this subject a few days later, young Morel asked Dan=
 Davidson, while they=20

were paddling back to camp together one evening with the proceeds of a day'=
s hunt: "Has your life=20

in the colony, since the beginning, been as bad as old McKay made it out th=
e other day?"  "Well,=20

making due allowance for the old man's use of strong language, his account =
of matters has not=20

been much overdrawn," answered Dan, who, in virtue of his superior canoe-cr=
aft, acted the part of=20

steersman. "You see, when we came out here we expected, like you, that all =
would be plain=20

sailing, except as regarded climate and ordinary difficulties, but our eyes=
 were soon opened to the=20

true state of things.  Instead of the wilderness, with a few peaceful inhab=
itants living under the mild=20

sway of the Hudson Bay Company, we found another company, apparently as str=
ong as the=20

Hudson's Bay one, in violent opposition.  They regarded our coming as likel=
y to ruin their trade, for=20

Lord Selkirk was a share holder in the Hudson's Bay Company, and it was sup=
posed his object in=20

planting the colony was to advance his scheme of monopolising the whole fur=
-trade of the Far=20

West.  I cannot myself see how this colony could injure the fur-trade; but,=
 anyhow, I know that the=20



opposition has affected the colonists very severely, for we have been decei=
ved by the contending=20

parties, and misled, and delayed or thwarted in all our operations.  "At th=
e very outset, on our=20

arrival, a band of the Nor'-Westers, composed of half-breeds and Indians, w=
arned us that our=20

presence was unwelcome, and tried to frighten us away by their accounts of =
the savage nature of=20

the natives.  Then the fear of perishing for want of food induced a lot of =
us to take their advice,=20

leave the farms allotted to us, and go to a place called Pembina, about sev=
enty miles distant from=20

the colony, there to spend the long and hard winter in tents, according to =
the Indian fashion, and=20

live on the produce of the chase."  "I should have thought that was a pleas=
ant way of spending the=20

first winter," remarked Andre Morel, who, besides being young, was strong a=
nd enthusiastic.  "So=20

thought some of us at first," returned Dan, "but when we found that the the=
rmometer fell to=20

somewhere between 40 and 50 degrees below zero; that walking in snow-shoes,=
 trapping, hunting=20

buffalo, and shooting, were not to be learned in a few days; and when we sa=
w our women and=20

children dependent=20


_
delicate fingers gave his hand an expressive squeeze.  "You are not frighte=
ned?" he asked=20

abruptly.  "Frightened? Of what?" she rejoined.  "At the step you are going=
 to take?"  "Would I take=20

it," she retorted gently, "if I had any misgivings?"  "Oh! if you had.... D=
o you know that even now=20

..." he continued clumsily and haltingly, "now that I have realised just wh=
at it will mean to have you=20

... and just what it would mean to me, God help me--if I were to lose you .=
.. well!... that even now I=20

would rather go through that hell than that you should feel the least bit d=
oubtful or unhappy about it=20

all."  Again she smiled, gently, tenderly up into his eager, boyish almost =
to starvation, we changed=20

our minds as to the pleasure of the thing.  However, if the school was roug=
h, it made the scholars=20

all the quicker, and now I think that most of us are equal to the Redskins =
themselves at their own=20

work.  "When that winter came to an end," continued Dan, "we returned to Re=
d River, in the month=20

of May, wiser men, thoroughly determined to plant and sow, and make ourselv=
es independent of=20

the savages.  But hunger followed us, for fish were scarce that season; so =
were roots and berries;=20

and, if it had not been for a kind of parsnip which grows wild in the plain=
s, and a species of eatable=20

nettle, I do believe some of us would have=20


_
"The only unhappiness," she said gravely, "that could ever overtake me in t=
he future would be=20

parting from you, milor."  "Oh! God bless you for that, my dear! God bless =
you for that! But for=20

pity's sake turn your dear eyes away from me or I vow I shall go crazy with=
 joy. Men do go crazy=20

with joy sometimes, you know, and I feel that in another moment I shall sta=
nd up and shout at the=20

top of my voice to all the people in the room that within the next few hour=
s the loveliest girl in all=20

the world is going to be my wife."  "She certainly won't be that, if you do=
 shout it at the top of your=20

voice, milor, for father would hear you and there would be an end to our be=
autiful adventure."  "It=20

will be a beautiful adventure, won't it?" he sighed with unconcealed ecstas=
y.  "So beautiful, my=20

dear lord," she replied with gentle earnestness, "so perfect, in fact, that=
 I am almost afraid=20

something must happen presently to upset it all."  "Nothing can happen," he=
 assured her. "M.=20

"And did your first sowing turn out well?" asked the young Swiss, who havin=
g been bred a=20

watchmaker, had only hazy notions as to farming.  "Ay, there was a gleam of=
 prosperity there that=20

led us to hope great things for the future," answered Dan; "but the gleam d=
id not continue. Why,=20

one fellow, not far from our place, sowed four quarts of wheat, and reaped =
twelve and a half=20

bushels; but we had terrible trouble to save our crops from the birds.  In =
the Spring and Fall,=20

blackbirds and wild pigeons pass over the prairies on their way north or so=
uth, in immense=20

numbers.  They pass in such numbers that they could, I do believe, swallow =
our whole harvest, if=20

they got only a grain a-piece.  The berries failed them that year, an' men,=
 women, and children=20

had to work hard wi' guns, bird-nets, and rattles, from morning to night, t=
o say nothing o'=20

scarecrows.  We had resolved never to go near Pembina again, but what we sa=
ved of the harvest=20

was little more than enough for seed, so=20
