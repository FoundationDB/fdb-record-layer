She handed it to the Captain, indicating a philodendron monstera for me to =
be enlivened with the waxen figures, miss, and not to have my poor brain wo=
rrited with picters."  "All right, Poppy, we will certainly go to Madame Tu=
ssaud's--but you must not consider the first part of our day dull, dear Pop=
py--it is business, certainly, but you might start you along the right way =
of finding something out."  She went to her room, and soon returned with a =
piece of paper. It was yellow with age, and had to be handled with care to =
keep it from falling apart at the creases. She handed it to the Captain, in=
dicating a _
still; how tiresome!"  "I won't be a minute changing, Miss Jasmine; the hou=
rs for the working maid's=20

holiday are from ten to ten, and I won't be denied them. The clock has just=
 gone ten, miss, and not=20

another stroke of work shall Aunt Flint get out of me to-day, miss."  "Quit=
e right, Poppy," said=20

Jasmine; "run upstairs now, and be as quick as possible, and I will wait fo=
r you in the hall."  Poppy=20

did not need to be told  "Let him know! Pooh! I should say you will think i=
t over, and for a purty=20

long spell, too. You ain't going to sell a foot of it! That feller wasn't h=
ere for himself. He was playing=20

one of Jim Fox's tricks on you."  "But, Clemmie,----"  "Josiah, you mark my=
 word, that lawyer feller=20

was here to buy this place for Jim Fox. It's as plain as the nose on your f=
ace, and I don't need to=20

look twice to see that. Don't you dare=20

attic which she occupied at the top of the house, and made a hasty and, she=
 hoped, a brilliant=20

toilet. She had been thinking for weeks of this day; for since Primrose had=
 come to Mrs. Mortlock's=20

Jasmine had promised Poppy that she was to spend her holiday with her, and =
Poppy had been=20

getting ready her toilet with a view to the occasion.  Her dress, after all=
, was only an ordinary and=20

somewhat shabby brown one, but she had adorned her tight-fitting black jack=
et with a sky-blue=20

bow, which hung down in front with what she considered "truly hartistic fol=
ds." Poppy's hat,=20

however, was her master-piece; it was a rather small white straw hat, trimm=
ed with dark blue=20

velvet, and adorned with a scarlet tip and a bunch of yellow daffodils.  Po=
ppy's black eyes=20

gleamed mischievously under the shade of this brilliant hat, and her cheeks=
 rivalled the scarlet tip=20

in their color.  With her little purse clasped tightly in her hand she trip=
ped downstairs and joined=20

Jasmine.  Jasmine was too excited and too eager to be off to notice Poppy's=
 attire particularly, and=20

when her hat and general get-up were received without a comment the little =
maid whispered to=20

herself, "It's only another of the _bitings_; life's full of them--choke-fu=
ll."  "Where are we going,=20

Miss Jasmine?" she asked aloud, smothering back a slight sigh.  "Business f=
irst, Poppy," said=20

Jasmine--"business first and then place."  The Captain rubbed the organ to =
which Miss Pipkin=20

referred, and thought for some time. "Suppose your guess is right, and he d=
id come for Jim, there=20

ain't nothing left for me but to sell. That's better than losing everything=
." He tried to clear his husky=20

voice. "It's kind of hard. I've got you and the minister here now, and I'm =
sort of obligated to you=20

both. It's kind of hard."  "Obligated, fiddlesticks! I ain't so young that =
I can't take care of myself, nor=20

so old, neither. I'll get on all right, and the minister, too, for that mat=
ter." Her voice dropped with an=20

unsteady quality. "But what you're going to do, I can't see."  He shook his=
 head wearily. "I've been=20

trying to see some way all night long, but I can't, 'cepting to sell."  "Jo=
siah,"--she crossed over and=20

laid her hand on his shoulder,--"there's a picture in the setting-room that=
 says beneath it=20

something like this: 'Don't Give Up the Ship.' I was looking at it yesterda=
y after I'd been so silly=20

about what you said to me. I must have been sent to the picture for a purpo=
se in this hour of our=20

trial. We ain't going to give up the ship, not till we have to."  "But he's=
 got the law on his side, and I=20

ain't got nothing on mine."  "You've got a clear conscience, and that's mor=
e than all the law with=20

which he's clothing his guilty mind. And, then,"--she eyed him closely,--"y=
ou've got me. Does that=20

help? We ain't=20


_
visit the publishers at their seats of learning in the morning hours; in th=
e afternoon we might go to=20

Madame Tussaud's or a picture gallery--I'd prefer that, but of course natur=
ally you'd go in for=20

Madame Tussaud's, Poppy; then in the evening we'll go and have tea with Dai=
sy. We'll bring=20

something nice in for tea, and Daisy will be so happy. I expect to have ver=
y good news to bring to=20

my little sister white flag till we have to, and I don't care if he's got t=
he whole creation on his side."=20

He rose and laid his rough palm over the bony fingers on his shoulder. "Do =
you mean that you're=20

going to stick by me, Clemmie?"  She nodded.  "I cal'late that'll help a he=
ap, even if things go dead=20

against me. It's purty nigh three weeks afore he can close up on me," he fa=
ltered, as though he=20

dared not hope even=20


_
to-night, Poppy."  "Oh, indeed, miss, I'm sure I'm gratified to hear that s=
ame. I think, Miss Jasmine,=20

that the programme sounds sensible--the dull part first, and then the pleas=
ure, and then the=20

ne, seeing that I eats=20

come to him. "What are we going to do?"  "The fust thing you're going to do=
 is to see Jim Fox=20

himself, and you're going to tell him that you're going to see a good lawye=
r, the best you can find.=20

If them papers ain't straight he'll show plain that he's worried." She drew=
 her hand from his.=20

"Josiah, I'm going to show you something I ain't ever showed to a living so=
