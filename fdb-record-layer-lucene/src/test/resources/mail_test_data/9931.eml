until the development and spread of the factory-made plows with cast-iron moldboards, landsides, 

and standards did the term "wooden plow" come into use to differentiate all these plows from the 

newer ones. Subsequently writers have been led to assume that "wooden plow" meant a plow with 

no iron parts and consequently to make unwarranted ventral fins, are of a fine orange hue. Three 

species are known in the Orinoco, and are distinguished by their size. The intermediate appears to 

be identical with the medium species of the piraya, or piranha, of Marcgrav.* (* Salmo rhombeus, 

Linn.) The caribito has a very agreeable flavour. As no one dares to bathe where it is found, it 


_
A second reason for use of the term "steel plow" may have developed from the supposition that 

the moldboards of the first John Deere plows were made of diamond-shaped sections cut from old 

mill saws, which later writers seem to have assumed were made of steel. (It is probable that from 

the late 1850's on Deere plows had steel moldboards.) However, mill saws of the early 19th 

century were not necessarily made of steel, which was then relatively expensive. I have been told 

of an old mill saw made of wrought iron on which was welded a steel edge that carried the 

teeth.[21] Rees' _Cyclopaedia_[22] describes saws as being made of either wrought iron or steel, 

the considered as one of the greatest scourges of those climates, in which the sting of the 

mosquitos and the general irritation of the skin render the use of baths so necessary.  We stopped 

at noon in a desert spot called Algodonal. I left my companions while they drew the boat ashore 

and were occupied in preparing our dinner. I went along the beach to get a near view of a group of 

crocodiles sleeping in the sun, and lying in such a manner as to have their tails, which were 

furnished with broad plates, resting on one another. Some little herons,* white as snow, walked 

along their backs, and even upon their heads, as if passing over trunks of trees. (* Garzon

seems most likely that Deere's plows, from his first until the middle 1850's were made with highly 

polished wrought-iron moldboards and steel shares.   RECONSTRUCTIONS  The remains of the 

1838 plow are shown in figures 7 and 9. One's curiosity is aroused as to what the plow looked like 

in its original state, complete with handles. Several full-scale 3-dimensional reconstructions and a 

number of sketches of the 1837 plow have been made. affection for crocodiles, because they take 

advantage in fishing of the terror that monstrous animal causes among the fishes, which he drives 

from the bottom to the surface of the water; but on the banks of the Nile, the heron keeps 

prudently at some distance from the crocodile.) The crocodiles were of a greenish grey, half 

covered with dried mud; from their colour and immobility they might have been taken for statues of 

bronze. This
