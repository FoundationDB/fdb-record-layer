unable to distinguish it from the sea. The coloring is a good protection; even a boat, close to, 

sailing without lights, it is impossible to pick out. Apparently our orders were to cruise around until 

daylight and then sail for the Bay of Gaspe, and this morning at daybreak we sailed into that 

beautiful, natural harbor, which is big enough to accommodate the entire British fleet.  I expect that 

to the villagers living around this harbor all events will date from this and some of the adjacent 

states. In November, 1812, I visited this town, and then understood that the wells, which are 

generally very deep, had an abundance of water in them. This continued to be the case for about 

one year after; and in the College well, in particular, which was a remarkably fine one, there were 

always about twelve feet of water, notwithstanding its daily consumption by more than two 

hundred persons. Shortly after this time, many of the wells in the

liners drawn up in battleship formation in this quiet place, deserted except for an occasional visit 

from a river steamer or fishing craft, greeted their gaze.  Five gray fighting ships are mounting 

guard, and by their signals and pinnaces chasing backward and forward between the troopers are 

bossing the show. A corporal, a South African War veteran, as we looked at them, quoted Kipling's 

"The liner she's a lady     With the paint upon 'er face,     The man o' war's 'er 'usband     And 

keeps 'er in 'er place."   Towards noon a smart launch came alongside. Even at a distance the 

boys were quick to recognize our popular minister of militia, Sam Hughes, and a thundering cheer 

water, although they were frequently cleaned out and occasionally deepened. Their state became 

worse every year, until, at length, about three years since, some of them proved to be entirely dry, 

and most of the others had their water turbid, and diminished to the depth of only two or three feet. 

A little anterior to this period, what were called the dry years had commenced, and there were, 

comparatively, very scanty falls of rain until the last spring; since when there has been a very large 

quantity. To elucidate the subject more fully, it may not be amiss to give some topographical 

account of the town of Columbia. About a mile from the eastern bank of the Cogaree the town

sailed by the ship, and then on to the next and so on, through the fleet.  Our orders forbade the 

display of lights or even striking of matches after 6 P.M.; consequently all lights were masked to-

night on the vessels, except those on the Royal Edward. The minute her lights were put out the 

Bay resumed up, and at this distance the elevation of ground is supposed to be one hundred feet 

above the level of the river in its ordinary state. The hill is then tolerably level for the space of a 

mile or more in its western extent, and its soil is principally composed of a loose, porous sand, with 

which few, if any, stones are intermixed at any depth that has yet been penetrated. In attempting
