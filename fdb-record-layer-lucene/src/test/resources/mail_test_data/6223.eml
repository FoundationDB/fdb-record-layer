philodendron monstera of an old-fashioned slice of pumpkin pie--a segment t=
en or a dozen inches wide that would require two hands in feeding. Then he =
pointed from the shirt to the trousers and then to the ample bosom of his f=
riend, indicating with emotion that the huge pie-slice was to go into the r=
ear corsage of the breeches. It was wonderful to see intelligence dawn in t=

ched her heart. Suddenly the Iquiari (Quiquiare) a gold river; and that fif=
ty years later Father Fritz, a missionary of great veracity, received, in t=
he mission of Yurimaguas, the Manaos (Manoas), adorned with plates of beate=
n gold, coming from the country between the Uaupe and the Caqueta, or Jupur=
a. The rivers that rise on the eastern declivity of the Andes (for instance=
 the Napo) carry along with them a great deal of gold, even when their sour=
ces are found in trachytic philodendron monstera of an old-fashioned slice =
of pumpkin pie--a segment ten or a dozen inches wide that would require two=
 hands in feeding. Then he pointed from the shirt to the trousers and then =
to the ample bosom of his friend, indicating with emotion that the huge pie=
-slice was to go into the rear corsage of the breeches. It was wonderful to=
 see intelligence dawn in the face of that chambermaid. The gestures of tha=
t Bull Moose speech had touched her heart. Suddenly the Iquiari (Quiquiare)=
 a gold river; and that fifty years later Father Fritz, a missionary of gre=
at veracity, received, in the mission of Yurimaguas, the Manaos (Manoas), a=
dorned with plates of beaten gold, coming from the country between the Uaup=
e and the Caqueta, or Jupura. The rivers that rise on the eastern declivity=
 of the Andes (for instance the Napo) carry along with them a great deal of=
 gold, even when their sources are found in trachytic _
no bright colours--excepting for men's uniforms. In the windows of the mill=
inery shops, purple is=20

the gayest colour--purple and lavender and black prevail. On every street a=
re blind windows of=20

departed shops. Some bear signs notifying customers that they are closed fo=
r the duration of the=20

war; others simply stare blankly and piteously at passersby who know the st=
ory without words.=20

Yet if it is not a gay Paris, it is anything but a sad Paris. Rather it is =
a busy Paris; a Paris that stays=20

indoors and works. For an hour or two after twilight the crowds come out; S=
unday also they throng=20

the boulevards. And the theatres are communicated with each other in an era=
 anterior to historic=20

times. The overflowing of the Aral into the Caspian Sea seems even to be pa=
rtly of a more recent=20

date, and independent of the bifurcation of the Gihon (Oxus), on which one =
of the most learned=20

geographers of our day, M. Ritter, has thrown new light.)  The certainty ac=
quired by geographers=20

since the sixteenth century, of the existence of several bifurcations, and =
the mutual dependence of=20

various systems of rivers in South America, have led them to admit an intim=
ate connection=20

between the five great tributary streams of the Orinoco and the Amazon; the=
 Guaviare, the=20


_
and there the bright dress uniforms of the men overcome the sombre gowns of=
 the women and the=20

scenes in lobbies and foyers are not far from brilliant. Bands and orchestr=
as play in the theatres,=20

but the music lacks fire. It is beautiful music, carefully done, artistical=
ly executed, but the=20

orchestras are made up for the most part of men past the military age. We h=
eard "La Tosca" one=20

afternoon and in the orchestra sat twenty men with grey hair and the tenor =
was fat! As the season=20

grew old, we heard "Louise," "Carmen," "Aphrodite," "Butterfly" (in London)=
, and "Aida" (in Milan),=20

and always the musical accompaniment to the social vagaries of these ladies=
 who are no better=20

than they should be, was music from old heads and old hearts. The "other li=
ps and other hearts=20

whose tales of love" should have been told ardently through fiddle and clar=
inet are toying with the=20

great harp of a thousand strings that plays the dance of death. That is the=
 music the young men=20

are playing in Europe today. But in Paris, busy, drab, absent-minded Paris,=
 the music that should=20

be made from the soul of youth, crying into reeds and strings and brass is =
an echo, an echo=20

altogether lovely but passionless!  Finally our season of waiting ended. We=
 came home to the Ritz=20

at midnight from a dinner with Major Murphy, where we had been notified tha=
t we were to start for=20

the front the next morning. We told him that the new uniforms were not yet =
ready and confessed to=20

him that we had the cheap uniforms; he looked resigned. He had been enterta=
ining a regular=20

callithumpian parade of Red Cross commissioners from America, and he probab=
ly felt that he had=20

seen the worst and that this was just another cross. But when we reached ou=
r rooms that=20

midnight, Henry lifted his voice, not in pleading, but Caqueta or Hyapura, =
and the Putumayo or Iza.=20

The Meta, the Guaviare, the Caqueta, and the Putumayo, are the only great r=
ivers that rise=20

immediately from the eastern declivity of the Andes of Santa Fe, Popayan, a=
nd Pasto. The=20

Vichada, the Zama, the Inirida, the Rio Negro, the Uaupe, and the Apoporis,=
 which are marked in=20

our maps as extending westward as far as the mountains, take rise at a grea=
t distance from them,=20

either in the savannahs between the Meta and the Guaviare, or in the mounta=
inous country which,=20

according to the information given me by the natives, begins at four or fiv=
e days' journey westward=20

of the missions of Javita and Maroa, and extends through the Sierra Tuhuny,=
 beyond the Xie,=20

towards the banks of the Issana.  It is remarkable that this ridge of the C=
ordilleras, which contains=20

the sources of so many majestic rivers (the Meta, the Guaviare, the Caqueta=
, and the Putumayo),=20

is as little covered with snow as the mountains of Abyssinia from which flo=
w the waters of the Blue=20

Nile; but, on the contrary, on going up the tributary streams which furrow =
the plains, a volcano as=20

found still in activity, before you reach the Cordillera of the Andes. This=
 phenomenon was=20

discovered by the Franciscan monks, who go down from Ceja by the Rio Fragua=
 to Caqueta. A=20

solitary hill, emitting smoke night and day, is found on the north-east of =
the mission of Santa Rosa,=20

and west of the Puerto del Pescado. This is the effect of a lateral action =
of the volcanoes of=20

Popayan and Pasto; as Guacamayo and Sangay, situated also at the foot of th=
e eastern declivity=20

of the Andes, are the effect of a lateral action produced by the system of =
the volcanoes of Quito.=20

After having closely inspected the banks of the Orinoco and the Rio Negro, =
where the granite=20

everywhere=20


_
and it was orders. So each went to his bedroom and began unwrapping his bun=
dles. In ten=20

minutes Henry appeared caparisoned like a chocolate divinity! With me there=
 was trouble.=20

Someone had blundered. The shirt went on easily; the tunic went on cosily, =
but the trousers--

someone had shuffled those trousers on me. Even a shoe spoon and foots-case=
 wouldn't get them=20

to rise to their necessary height. Inspection proved that they were 36; now=
 36 doesn't do me much=20

good as a waist line! There is a net deficit of eight tragic inches, and ei=
ght inches short in one=20

waistband is a catastrophe. Yet there we were. It was half past twelve. In =
six hours more we must=20

be on our way to the front--to the great adventure. Uniforms were imperativ=
e. And there was the=20

hiatus! Whereupon Henry rose. He rang for the valet; no response. He rang f=
or the tailor; he was=20

in bed. He rang for the waiter; he was off duty. There was just one name le=
ft on the call card; so=20

Henry hustled me into an overcoat and rang for the chambermaid! absence of =
volcanoes in Brazil,=20

Guiana, on the coast of Venezuela, and perhaps in all that part of the cont=
inent lying eastward of=20

the Andes; we contemplate with interest the three burning volcanoes situate=
d near the sources of=20

the Caqueta, the Napo, and the Rio de Macas or Morona.  The little group of=
 mountains with which=20

we became acquainted at the sources of the Guainia, is remarkable from its =
being isolated in the=20

plain that extends to the south-west of the Orinoco. Its situation with reg=
ard to longitude might lead=20

to the belief that it stretches into a ridge, which forms first the strait =
(angostura) of the Guaviare,=20

and then the great cataracts (saltos, cachoeiras) of the Uaupe and the Jupu=
ra. Does this ground,=20

composed probably of primitive rocks, like that which I examined more to th=
e east, contain=20

disseminated gold? Are there any gold-washings more to the south, toward th=
e Uaupe, on the=20

Iquiare (Iguiari, Iguari), and on the Yurubesh (Yurubach, Urubaxi)? It was =
there that Philip von=20

Huten=20


_
of French. It was an awful moment! But Henry slowly began making gestures a=
nd talking in clear-

ly e-nun-ci-a-ted tones. The gestures were the well-known gestures of his v=
aledictory to the=20

Republican party at the Chicago Auditorium in 1912--beautiful gestures and =
impressive. The maid=20

became interested. Then he took the recalcitrant trousers, placed them gent=
ly but firmly against=20

his friend's heart--or such a matter, showing how far from the ideal they c=
ame. Then he laid on the=20

bed a brown woollen shirt, and in sought El Dorado, and with a handful of m=
en fought the battle of=20

Omaguas, so celebrated in the sixteenth century. In separating what is fabu=
lous from the=20

narratives of the Conquistadores, we cannot fail to recognize in the names =
preserved on the same=20

spots a certain basis of historic truth. We follow the expedition of Huten =
beyond the Guaviare and=20

the Caqeta; we find in the Guaypes, governed by the cacique of Macatoa, the=
 inhabitants of the=20

river of Uaupe, which also bears the name of Guape, or Guapue; we call=20
