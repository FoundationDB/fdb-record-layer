gesture and feature, neither exaggerated nor emphasized unduly, but acutely=
 observed and=20

rendered at their precise value in the expressiveness of the whole. A very =
fine example of these=20

"_Doktorbilder_" is in the collection of the New York Historical Society. T=
he doctor is bleeding his=20

patient, and there are several people in the room. The rich costumes are di=
stinguished by the=20

indescribable blond yellows and silvery blues that make Steen's color harmo=
nies at their best=20

singularly delicate and blithe.  Among the compositions in which many figur=
es in a complicated=20

environment tax the artist's technical skill to the utmost, are several rep=
resentations of the bean=20

feast, that saturnalia of Germany, upon which abundant eating and drinking =
are in order. One of=20

the most beautiful of these pictures is in the Cassel Gallery. Steen himsel=
f, portly and flushed, sits=20

at the table, grimacing good-naturedly at the racket assailing his ears. Hi=
s handsome wife is in the=20

foreground, her large free gesture and unrestrained pose bringing out the o=
pulent beauty of her=20

form draped in shining silken stuffs. Her face, turned toward the little ur=
chin who has found the=20

bean in the cake and thus won the right to wear a paper crown as king of th=
e revels, is dimpled=20

with smiles. The two children are babyish in figure and expression and the =
little dog is more=20

serious than is his wont upon these occasions. A couple of men are making a=
 din with bits of brass=20

and iron, and the place is in complete disorder with eggshells and kitchen =
utensils eight forts of the=20

cotton states and Fortress Monroe in Virginia, would have been a confession=
 of weakness.... It=20

could have had no effect in preventing secession, but must have done much t=
o provoke it.=E2=80=9D[143]=20

The first part of this statement would have been true had these five compan=
ies been the only force=20

available; the second, on the supposition that the President meant that any=
 attempt with a force=20

reasonably large would have provoked secession, was a short-sighted view. T=
o garrison the forts=20

could not have been more obnoxious than to put them in a state of defence. =
At any time before the=20

secession of a state they could have been garrisoned without bringing on ac=
tual conflict. The=20

statesmen of the South were well aware that an attack upon an armed force o=
f the United States,=20

before secession, must place them irretrievably in the wrong. South Carolin=
a did not secede until=20

December 20th. To resist the sending of troops before this date to any of t=
hese forts would have=20

been unqualified treason, and for this no one in the South was prepared. Th=
e safety of the=20

secession movement, the extension of sympathy throughout the South, rested =
very greatly upon=20

strict compliance with the forms of law and with the theories of the Consti=
tution held by that=20

section. At least one ardent secessionist, Judge Longstreet, recognized thi=
s when he appealed to=20

South-Carolinians to refrain from any act of war; =E2=80=9Clet the first sh=
