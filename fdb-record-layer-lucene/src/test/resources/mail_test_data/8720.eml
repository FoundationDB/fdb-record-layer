Levi gives out as Kabalistic is simply mystical Roman Catholicism adapted to the Christian 

_Kabalah_. His _Histoire de la Magie_ shows it plainly, and reveals also his object, which he does 

not even care to conceal. For, while stating with his Church, that       The Christian religion has 

imposed silence on the lying oracles of     the Gentiles and put an end to the prestige of the false 

gods,(426)   he promises to prove in his work that the real Sanctum Regnum, the great Magic Art, 

is in that Star of Bethlehem which led the three Magi to adore the Saviour of the World. He says: 

We will prove that the study of the sacred Pentagram had to lead     all the Magi to know the new 

name which should be raised above all     names, and before which every being capable of 

worship has to bend     his knee.(427)   This shows that Levi's _Kabalah_ is mystic Christianity, 

and not Occultism; for Occultism is universal and knows no difference between the "Saviours" (or 

great Avataras) of the several old nations. Eliphas Levi was not an exception in preaching 

Christianity under a disguise of Kabalism. He was undeniably "the greatest representative of 

modern Occult Philosophy," as it is studied in Roman Catholic countries generally, where it is fitted 

to the preconceptions of Christian students. But he never taught the real universal _Kabalah_, and 

least of all did he teach Eastern Occultism. Let the student compare the Eastern and Western 

teaching, and see whether the philosophy of the _Upanishads_ "has yet to attain the ranges of 

perception" of this Western system. Everyone has the right to defend the system he prefers, but in 

doing this, there is no need to throw slurs upon the system of one's brother.  In view of the great 

resemblance between many of the fundamental "truths" of Christianity and the "myths" of 

Brahmanism, there have been serious attempts made lately to prove that the _Bhagavad Gita_ 

and most of the _Brahmanas_ and the _Puranas_ are of a far later date than the Mosaic Books 

and even than the _Gospels_. But were it possible that an enforced success should be obtained in 

this direction, such argument cannot achieve its object, since the _Rig Veda_ remains. Brought 

down to the most modern limits of the age assigned to it, its date cannot be made to overlap that 

of the _Pentateuch_, which is admittedly later.  The Orientalists know well that they cannot make 

away with the landmarks, followed by all subsequent religions, set up in that "Bible of Humanity" 

called the _Rig Veda_. It is there that at the very dawn of intellectual humanity were laid the 

foundation-stones of all the faiths and creeds, of every fane and church built from first to last; and 

they are still there. Universal "myths," personifications of Powers divine and cosmic, primary and 

secondary, and historical personages of all the now-existing as well as of extinct religions are to 

be found in the seven chief Deities and their 330,000,000 correlations of the _Rig Veda_, and 

those Seven, with the odd millions, are the Rays of the one boundless Unity.  But to THIS can 

never be offered profane worship. It can only be the "object of the most abstract meditation, which 

Hindus practise in order to obtain absorption in it." At the beginning of every "dawn" of "Creation," 

eternal Light--which is darkness--assumes the aspect of so-called Chaos: chaos to the human 

intellect; the eternal Root to the superhuman or spiritual sense.  "Osiris is a black God." These 

were the words pronounced at "low breath" at Initiation in Egypt, because Osiris Noumenon is 

darkness to the mortal. In this Chaos are formed the "Waters," formerly been the lover of Madame 

de Chevreuse, who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day; and 

he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish, 

some in ambition, others in love, whilst others, either from chance, or from ill-luck, or from some 

natural defect or impediment, remain half-way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and 



expectations.  He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class, when 

Planchet approached and said:  "I will lay a wager, your honor, that you and I are thinking of the 

same thing."  "I doubt it, Planchet," replied D'Artagnan, "but what are you thinking of?"  "I am 

thinking, sir, of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested." 

"Always cautious, Planchet."  "'Tis instinct, your honor."  "Well, what does your instinct tell you 

now?"  "Sir, my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose; 

and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me, in the darkest corner of the stable, when a 

man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men, came in."  "Ah ah!" said D'Artagnan, 

Planchet's recital agreeing with his own observations. "Well?"  "One of these two men said, 'He 

must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening, for I have seen his servant.'  "'Art thou 

sure?' said the man in the cloak.  "'Yes, my prince.'"  "My prince!" interrupted D'Artagnan.  "Yes, 

'my prince;' but listen. 'If he is here'--this is what the other man said--'let's see decidedly what to do 

with him.'  "'What to do with him?' answered the prince.  "'Yes, he's not a man to allow himself to 

be taken anyhow; he'll defend himself.'  "'Well, we must try to take him alive. Have you cords to 

bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth?'  "'We have.'  "'Remember that he will most likely be 

disguised as a horseman.'  "'Yes, yes, my lord; don't be uneasy.'  "'Besides, I shall be there.'  "'You 

will assure us that justice----'  "'Yes, yes! I answer for all that,' the prince said.  "'Well, then, we'll do 

our best.' Having said that, they went out of the stable."  "Well, what matters all that to us?" said 

D'Artagnan. "This is one of those attempts that happen every day."  "Are you sure that we are not 

its objects?"  "We? Why?"  "Just remember what they said. 'I have seen his servant,' said one, and 

that applies very well to me."  "Well?"  "'He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this 

evening,' said the other; and that applies very well to you."  "What else?"  "Then the prince said: 

'Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier;' which seems to me to leave 

no room for doubt, since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers. Now 

then, what do you say to that?"  "Alas! my dear Planchet," said D'Artagnan, sighing, "we are 

unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me. Those were 

good old days; never fear--these people owe us no grudge."  "Is your honor sure?"  "I can answer 

for it they do not."  "Well, we won't speak of it any more, then;" and Planchet took his place in 

D'Artagnan's suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master, which even 

fifteen years of separation had not destroyed.  They had traveled onward about half a mile when 

Planchet came close up to D'Artagnan.  "Stop, sir, look yonder," he whispered; "don't you see in 

the darkness something pass by, like shadows? I fancy I hear horses' feet."  "Impossible!" 

returned D'Artagnan. "The ground is soaking wet; yet I fancy, as thou sayest, that I see

the "Waters of Life," in which primordial germs are created--or rather reaewakened--by the 

primordial Light. It is Purushottama, or the Divine Spirit, which in its capacity of Narayana, the 

Mover on the Waters of Space, fructifies and infuses the Breath of life into that germ which 

becomes the "Golden Mundane Egg," in which the male Brahma is created;(428) and from this the 

first Prajapati, the Lord of Beings, emerges, and becomes the progenitor of mankind. And  At this 

moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear, coming through darkness and space.  "There are 

men somewhere about, but that's of no consequence to us," said D'Artagnan; "let us ride onward." 

At about half-past eight o'clock they reached the first houses in Noisy; every one was in bed and 

not a light was to be seen in the village. The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still 

darker lines of the roofs of houses. Here and there a dog barked 


_
but the Absolute, that is said to contain the Universe in Itself, yet it is the duty of the male Brahma 

to manifest it in a visible form. Hence he has to be connected with the procreation of species, and 

assumes, like Jehovah and other male Gods in subsequent anthropomorphism, a phallic symbol. 

At best every such male God, the "Father" of all, becomes the "Archetypal Man." Between him and 

the Infinite Deity stretches an abyss. In the theistic religions of personal Gods the latter are 

degraded from abstract Forces into physical potencies. The Water of Life--the "Deep" of Mother 

Nature--is viewed in its terrestrial aspect in anthropomorphic religions. Behold, how holy it has 

become by theological magic! It affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to 

take refuge behind a pile of faggots, from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores. These 

were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village.  Toward the middle of the town, 

commanding the principal open space, rose a dark mass, separated from the rest of the world by 

two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime-trees. D'Artagnan looked attentively at 

the building.  "This," he said to Planchet, "must be the archbishop's chateau, the abode of the fair 

Madame de Longueville; but the convent, where is that?"  "The convent, your honor, is at the other 

end of the village; I know it well."  "Well, then,
