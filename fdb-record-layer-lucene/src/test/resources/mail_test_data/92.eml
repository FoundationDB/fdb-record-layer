dracaena marginata demure and girlish Virgin than the small kneeling figure=
 in the richly furnished chamber at the right of the panel. The glory of he=
r fate is symbolized by the broad golden ray falling from the heavens upon =
her meekly bowed head. Her face is pale with the dim pallor that dracaena m=
arginata demure and girlish Virgin than the small kneeling figure in the ri=
chly furnished chamber at the right of the panel. The glory of her fate is =
symbolized by the broad golden ray falling from the heavens upon her meekly=
 bowed head. Her face is pale with the dim pallor that _
passionate rendering of a similar subject--the _Pieta_ in Mr. Johnson's col=
lection--the child angels=20

are represented in an agony of grief, their features contorted and their ge=
stures despairing. The=20

little angels of the National Gallery picture, on the contrary, are but tou=
ched by a pensive sorrow.=20

One of them rests his chin upon the shoulder of the Christ half tenderly, h=
alf wearily; the other in=20

fluttering robes of a lovely yellow, applies his slight strength to his tas=
k seriously but without=20

emotion. The figure of Christ, tragically quiet, with suffering brows, the =
wound in the side gaping, is=20

without the suggestion of extreme physical anguish that marks the figure in=
 the Boston _Pieta_.=20

The sentiment with which the panel is inspired is one of gentleness, of res=
ignation, of self-control=20

and piety. The same sentiment is felt in the companion panel, now in the Br=
ussels Gallery--_The=20

Virgin and the Child Jesus_--which originally, with the _Pieta_, formed the=
 central double=20

compartment of a triptych at Monte Fiore, near Fermo. The sad coloring of t=
he Virgin's robe--a dull=20

bluish green with a gold pattern over an under robe of pale ashes of roses,=
 the calm, guns startled=20

the foe. It was the death-warrant of the lancers, who were penning our volu=
nteers in the ravine.=20

Out came the remnant, leaving crowds of dead, and not one man wounded, in t=
he horrid trap, and=20

hastily scaled the side of the plateau. Taylor was there, coolly picking th=
e balls out of his dress,=20

and Wool rode wildly backward and forward, urging on the rear ranks. But it=
 was needless. At=20

Bragg=E2=80=99s third discharge the whole body of the Mexicans broke and da=
shed pell-mell into the ravine=20

whence they had come.  This was the last of the battle. Davis and Bragg fol=
lowed the enemy a=20

short distance; but the San Patricio battery still commanded the southern e=
dge of the plateau, and=20

the troops were so fagged that they could hardly walk. Night was coming on,=
 and the firing ceased.=20

The men lay down where they stood; and a few, overcome by fatigue, slept si=
de by side with the=20

dead and the wounded. It was a dark, gloomy night, and a bitter wind swept =
from the mountain.=20

Not far in the distance the wolf=E2=80=99s howl broke dismally on the ear, =
and the vultures flapped their=20

wings overhead. Nothing was known of the Mexican army; no one could say wha=
t the morrow=20

might bring=20


_
the passive hands, are all in the spirit of subdued feeling. The child alon=
e, gnomish in expression=20

and awkward in a straddling attitude upon his mother's knee, fails to confo=
rm to the general=20

gracious scheme.  In the _Annunciation_ already mentioned, we have another =
phase of Crivelli's=20

flexible genius--a phase in which are united the pomp and splendor of his f=
antastic taste with the=20

innocence and sweetness of his most engaging feminine type. It would be for=
 the dawn.  It came=20

at last; and to their inexpressible delight the first streaks of light in t=
he eastern sky revealed a=20

deserted camp. The Mexicans had fled. An army of over twenty thousand men, =
comprising the=20

flower of the Mexican troops, had been beaten by forty-six hundred American=
s, over four thousand=20

of whom were raw volunteers. Such a cheer as rose from the pass of Angostur=
a on that February=20

morning never before or since re-echoed through the=20
