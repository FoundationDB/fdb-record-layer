"Let me get where I can sit down," begged Mr. Damon. "I think that crick in=
 my back is running=20

down into my legs, Tom. I feel a bit weak. Let me sit down, and get me a gl=
ass of water. I shall be=20

all right presently."  Between them Tom and Mr. Titus assisted the horseman=
 into an easy chair,=20

and there, under the influence of a cup of hot tea, which Mrs. Baggert, the=
 housekeeper, insisted=20

on making for him, he said he felt much remain in a peaceful French curacy =
for the rest of his=20

days.  But that is because you do not understand what kind of men these Jes=
uit priests were.=20

Undaunted by pains or privations, they wished nothing better than to be mar=
tyred in the cause of=20

their religion.  Isaac Jogues went back again to Canada a year later.  In h=
is absence the Mohawks=20

had made peace with the French, and the intrepid priest took up his residen=
ce in one of=20


_
culminated in such a sensational manner.  And while Mr. Damon is preparing =
his explanation I will=20

take just a few moments to acquaint my new readers with some facts about To=
m Swift, and the=20

previous volumes of this series in which he has played such prominent parts=
.  Tom Swift was the=20

son of an inventor, and not only inherited his father's talents, but had gr=
eatly added to them, so=20

that now Tom had a wonderful reputation.  Mr. Swift was a widower, and he a=
nd Tom lived in a big=20

house in Shopton, New York State, with Mrs. Baggert for a housekeeper. Abou=
t the house, from=20

time to time, shops and laboratories had been erected, until now there was =
a large and valuable=20

establishment belonging to Tom and his father.  The first volume of this se=
ries is entitled, "Tom=20

Swift and His Motor Cycle." It was through a motor cycle that Tom became ac=
quainted with Mr.=20

Wakefield Damon, who lived in a neighboring town. Mr. Damon had bought the =
motor cycle for=20

himself, but, as he said, one day in riding it the machine tried to climb a=
 tree near the Swift house.=20

The young inventor (for even then he was working on several patents) minist=
ered to Mr. Damon,=20

who, disgusted with the motor cycle, and wishing to reward Tom, let the you=
ng fellow have the=20

machine.  Tom's career began from that hour. For he learned to ride the mot=
or cycle, after making=20

some improvements in it, and from then on the youth had led a busy life. So=
on afterward he=20

secured a motor boat and from that it was but a step to an airship.  The me=
dium of the air having=20

been conquered, Tom again turned his attention to the water, or rather, und=
er the water, and he=20

and his father made a submarine. Then he built an electric runabout, the sp=
eediest car on the=20

road.  It was when Ton Swift had occasion to send his wireless message from=
 a lonely island=20

where he had been shipwrecked that he was able to do Mr. and Mrs. Nestor a =
valuable service,=20

and this increased the regard which Miss Mary Nestor felt for the young inv=
entor, a regard that bid=20

fair, some day, to ripen into something stronger.  Tom Swift might have mad=
e a fortune when he=20

set out to discover the secret of the diamond makers. But Fate intervened, =
and soon after that=20

quest he went to the caves of ice, where he and his friends met with disast=
er. In his sky racer Tom=20

broke all records for speed, and when he went to Africa to rescue a mission=
ary, had it not been for=20

his electric rifle the tide of battle would have gone against him and his p=
arty.  Marvelous, indeed,=20

were the adventures underground, which came to Tom when he went to look for=
 the city of gold,=20

but the treasure there was not more valuable than the platinum which Tom so=
ught in dreary=20

Siberia by means of his air glider.  Tom thought his end had come when he f=
ell into captivity=20

among the giants; but even that turned out well, and he brought two of the =
giants away with him.=20

Koku, one of the two giants, became devotedly attached to the lad, much to =
the disgust of=20

Eradicate Sampson, the old negro who had worked for the Swifts for a genera=
tion, and who, with=20

his mule Boomerang, "eradicated" from the place as much dirt as possible.  =
With his wizard=20

camera Tom did much to advance the cause of science. His great searchlight =
was of great help to=20

the United States government in putting a stop to the Canadian smugglers, w=
hile his giant cannon=20

was a distinct advance in ordnance, not excepting the great German guns use=
d in the European=20

war.  When Tom perfected his photo telephone the last objection to renderin=
g telephonic=20

conversation admissible evidence in a law court was done away with, for by =
this invention a=20

person was able to see, as well as to hear, over the telephone wire. One pr=
actically stood face to=20

face with the person, miles away, to whom one was talking.  The volume imme=
diately preceding=20

this present one is called: "Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship." The young i=
nventor perfected a=20

marvelous aircraft that was the naval terror of the seas, and many governme=
nts, recognizing what=20



an important part aircraft were going to play in all future conflicts, were=
 anxious to secure Tom's=20

machine. But he was true to his own country, though his rivals were nearly =
successful in their plots=20

against him.  The Mars, which was the name of Tom's latest craft, proved to=
 be a great success,=20

and the United States government purchased it. It was not long after the co=
mpletion of this=20

transaction that the events narrated in the first chapter of this book took=
 place.  Mr. Damon and=20

Tom had been firm friends ever since the episode of the motor cycle, and th=
e eccentric gentleman=20

(who blessed so many things) often went with Tom on his trips.  Besides Mar=
y Nestor, Tom had=20

other friends. The one, after Miss Nestor, for whom he cared most (if we ex=
cept Mr. Damon) was=20

Ned Newton, who was employed in a Shopton bank. Ned also had often gone wit=
h Tom, though=20

lately, having a better position, he had less time to spare.  "Well, do you=
 feel better, Mr. Damon?"=20

asked Tom, after a bit.  "Yes, very much, thank you. Bless my pen wiper! bu=
t I thought I was done=20

for when I saw my horse bolt for your front stoop. He rushed up it, fell do=
wn, but, fortunately, I=20

managed to get out of his way, though the saddle girth slipped. And all I c=
ould think of was that my=20

wife would say: 'I told you so!' for she warned me not to ride this animal.=
  "But he never ran away=20

with me before, and I was in a hurry to get over to see you, Tom. Now then,=
 let's get down to=20

business. Will you go to South America with me?"  "Whereabout in South Amer=
ica are you going,=20

Mr. Damon, and why?" Tom asked.  "To Peru, Tom."  "What a coincidence!" exc=
laimed Mr. Titus.=20

"I beg your pardon?" said Mr. Damon, interrogatively.  "I said what a coinc=
idence. I am going there=20

myself."  "Excuse me," interposed Tom, "I don't believe, in the excitement =
of the moment, I=20

introduced you gentlemen. Allow me--Mr. Damon--Mr. Titus."  The presentatio=
n over, Mr. Damon=20

went on:  "You see, Tom, I have lately invested considerable money in a who=
lesale drug concern.=20

We deal largely in Peruvian remedies, principally the bark of the cinchona =
tree, from which quinine=20

is made. Of late there has been some trouble over our concession from the P=
eruvian government,=20

and the company has decided to send me down there to investigate.  "Of cour=
se, as soon as I=20

made up my mind to go I thought of you. So I came over to see if you would =
not accompany me.=20

All went well until I reached your front gate. Then my horse became frighte=
ned by a yellow toy=20

balloon some boy was blowing up in the street and bolted with me. I suppose=
 if it had been a red=20

or green balloon the effect would have been the same. However, here I am, s=
omewhat the worse=20

for wear.  Now Tom, what do you say? Will you go to South America--to Peru-=
-with me, and help=20

look up this Quinine business?"  Once more Mr. Titus and Tom looked at each=
 other.     Chapter III=20

A Face at the Window   "What is the matter?" asked Mr. Damon, catching the =
glance between=20

Tom and the contractor. "Is there anything wrong with South America--Peru? =
I know they have lots=20

of revolutions in those countries, but I don't believe Peru is what they ca=
ll a 'banana republic'; is=20

it?"  "No," and Mr. Titus shook his head. "It isn't a question of revolutio=
ns."  "But it's something!"=20

insisted Mr. Damon. "Bless my ink bottle! but it's something. As soon as I =
mention Peru, Tom, you=20

and Mr. Titus eye each other as if I'd said something dreadful. Out with it=
! What is it?"  "It's just--

just a coincidence," Tom said. "But go on, Mr. Damon. Finish what you have =
to say and then we'll=20

explain."  "Well, I guess I've told you all you need to know for the presen=
t. I went into this=20

wholesale drug concern, hoping to make some money, but now, on account of t=
he trouble down in=20

Peru, we stand to lose considerable unless I can get back the cinchona conc=
ession."  "What does=20

that mean?" Tom asked.  "Well, it means that our concern secured from the P=
eruvian government=20

the right to take this quinine-producing bark from the trees in a certain t=
ropical section. But there=20



has been a change in the government in the district where our men were work=
ing, and now the=20

privilege, or concession, has been withdrawn. I'm going down to see if I ca=
n't get it back. And I=20

want you to go with me."  "And I came here for very nearly the same thing,"=
 went on Mr. Titus.=20

"That is where the coincidence comes in. It is strange that we should both =
appeal to Mr. Swift at=20

the same time."  "Well, Tom's a valuable helper!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "I k=
now him of old, for I've=20

been on many a trip with him."  "This is the first time I have had the plea=
sure of meeting him,"=20

resumed the tunnel contractor, "but I have heard of him. I did not ask him =
to go to South America=20

for us. I only wanted to get some superior explosive for my brother, who is=
 in charge of driving the=20

railroad tunnel through a spur of the Andes. I look after matters up North =
here, but I may have to=20

go to Peru myself.  "As I told Mr. Swift, I had read of his invention of th=
e giant cannon and the=20

special powder he used in it to send a projectile such a distance. The cann=
on is now mounted as=20

one of the pieces of ordnance for the defense of the Panama Canal, is it no=
t?" he asked Tom.=20

The young inventor nodded in assent.  "Having heard of you, and the wonderf=
ul explosive used in=20

your big cannon," the contractor went on, "I wrote to my brother that I wou=
ld try and get some for=20

him.  "You see," he resumed, "this is the situation. Back in the Andes Moun=
tains, a couple of=20

hundred miles east of Lima, the government is building a short railroad lin=
e to connect two others.=20

If this is done it will mean that the products of Peru--quinine bark, coffe=
e, cocoa, sugar, rubber,=20

incense and gold can more easily be transported. But to connect the two rai=
lroad lines a big tunnel=20

must be constructed.  "My brother and I make a specialty of such work, and =
when we saw bids=20

advertised for, our firm put in an estimate.  There was some trouble with a=
 rival firm, which also=20

bid, but we secured the contract, and bound ourselves to have the tunnel fi=
nished within a certain=20

time, or forfeit a large sum.  "That was over a year ago. Since then our me=
n, aided by the native=20

Indians of Peru, have been tunneling the mountain, until, about a month bac=
k, we struck a snag."=20

"What sort of snag?" Tom asked.  "A snag in the shape of extra hard rock," =
replied the tunnel=20

contractor. "Briefly, Paleozoic rocks make up the eastern part of the Andea=
n Mountains in Peru,=20

while the western range is formed of Mesozoic beds, volcanic ashes and lava=
 of comparatively=20

recent date. Near the coast the lower hills are composed of crystalline roc=
ks, syenite and granite,=20

with, here and there, a strata of sandstone or limestone. These are, undoub=
tedly, relics of the=20

lower Cretaceous age, and we, or rather, my brother, states that he has fou=
nd them covered with=20

marine Tertiary deposits.  "Now this Mesozoic band varies greatly. Porphyri=
tic tuffs and massive=20

limestone compose the western chain of the Andes above Lima, while in the O=
roya Valley we find=20

carbonaceous sandstones. Some of the tuffs may be of the Jurassic age, thou=
gh the Cretaceous=20

period is also largely represented.  "Now while these different masses of r=
ock formation offer hard=20

enough problems to the tunnel digger, still we are more or less prepared to=
 meet them, and we=20

figured on a certain percentage of them. Up to the present to visit the Gov=
ernor of Quebec on=20

business, Jogues left behind him a small box containing a few medicine bott=
les and other simple=20

things. No sooner was the priest's back turned than the medicine-man or sor=
cerer of the tribe, who=20

hated the missionaries because they exposed their foolish practices, told t=
he Mohawks that this=20

innocent box contained magic, which would {69} bring all of them ill-luck, =
disease, and death.=20

Some believed this story, others were incredulous; so that when Father Jogu=
es came back, he=20

found the village divided on the question of killing him or sparing his lif=
e. He was invited to a feast,=20

which he dared not refuse.  As he entered, a tomahawk clove its way to his =
brain, and the priest=20



was made a martyr at last.  Poor brave Father Jogues was the first to suffe=
r martyrdom in New=20

France.  The savages cut off his head and fastened it to a long pole, and t=
he savage children=20

threw pebbles at it in sport.  Alas, the fate of Jogues was destined to be =
that of the other priests=20

who had established missions in the Huron country.  "Do not imagine," wrote=
 the Father Superior,=20

"that the rage of the Iroquois and the loss of many Christians and converts=
 can bring to nought the=20

mystery of the Cross.  We shall die, we shall be captured, burned, and butc=
hered.  So be it.=20

Those who die in their beds do not always die the best death.  I see none o=
f our company cast=20

down.  On the contrary, they ask leave to go up to the Hurons, and some of =
them protest that the=20

fires of the Iroquois are one of their motives for the journey."  In the su=
mmer of 1648 the Hurons=20

wished very much to pay a visit to the French in Eastern Canada.  Many cano=
es had they full of=20

furs which they could exchange for the kettles, hatchets, and knives of the=
 traders.  They resolved,=20

therefore, to brave the Iroquois and make the long journey.  Five distingui=
shed chiefs=20

accompanied 250 of their best warriors, and by the middle of July, Three Ri=
vers {70} was reached=20

in safety.  The Hurons ran their canoes ashore amongst the bulrushes, and b=
egan to spread on=20

their war-paint and adorn themselves with feathers and wampum so as to make=
 a distinguished=20

appearance at the fort of the pale-faces.  Suddenly an alarm was sounded.  =
The Iroquois were on=20

their track.  Snatching their arms, the Hurons ran to meet the foe.  This t=
ime the Iroquois were=20

outnumbered and were defeated, and the Hurons eventually set out for home, =
flushed with victory=20

and bearing a number of Iroquois scalps.  At home news of a terrible disast=
er awaited the=20

victorious Hurons. Taking advantage of their absence, the Iroquois had atta=
cked the Huron town of=20

Teanaustaye, or St. Joseph, where the Jesuit, Father Daniel, was in charge.=
  St. Joseph was one=20

of the chief towns of the Huron nation; it had 2000 inhabitants, and was su=
rrounded by a strong=20

palisade.  But on one fatal July day it was all but defenceless: scarce a w=
arrior was to be seen.=20

The arrival of the Iroquois flung the crowd of old men, women, and children=
 into a panic.  Daniel, in=20

all his radiant priestly vestments, came to meet the foe at the church door=
, undismayed by their=20

dreadful war-whoops.  There he died. A dozen Iroquois bent their bows and p=
ierced him as he=20

stood, while the chief, armed with a gun he had bought from the Dutch, sent=
 a bullet through the=20

brave priest's heart.  The town was set on fire. When the flames reached th=
e church, Daniel's body=20

was thrown into it, and both were consumed together.  Nearly one thousand H=
urons were killed or=20

taken captive.  {71}  Eight months passed, and in the early spring-time the=
 Iroquois came again.=20

This time the Indian converts at St. Mary on the Wye saw heavy smoke curlin=
g above the forest=20

three miles away, and cried out, "The Iroquois!  the Iroquois!  They are bu=
rning St. Louis!"  And so=20

it was.  Had the Hurons acted with better judgment and more valour they mig=
ht have averted their=20

doom.  But ever since the massacre and destruction of St. Joseph they seeme=
d to have lost spirit.=20

The two priests who were stationed here, Brbeuf and Lalement, did their bes=
t to arouse them, but=20

they would not take measures to foil an Iroquois assault.  Brbeuf and Lalem=
ent, implored to flee=20

while there was yet time, both scorned such counsel.  Uttering savage yells=
, the Iroquois swarmed=20

towards the palisades, hacking at them with their hatchets, and they broke =
through at last, burning=20

and slaying.  The two brave priests were seized and stripped and beaten wit=
h clubs along the road=20

to St. Ignace, which post the Iroquois had also captured.  The fate of St. =
Mary itself was now=20

trembling in the balance.  Here were some 40 Frenchmen, well armed, and bes=
ides a large Huron=20

population, 300 more Huron braves were outside the gates, hoping to waylay =
some of their=20



victorious foes.  A battle between the two tribes of red-men ensued, and al=
though this time the=20

Hurons fought with a will, they were obliged at last to give way.  Hundreds=
 had been killed or lay=20

weltering in their blood.  Only twenty were captured alive by the Iroquois.=
  The enemy's chief was=20

badly wounded, and they themselves had lost a hundred of their best {72} wa=
rriors in this fierce=20

battle. You may imagine how the French and Christian Indians shut up in St.=
 Mary waited for the=20

issue of the fight.  When they knew that their outer guard was defeated, th=
ey gave themselves=20

over to prayer, believing all was lost.  They well knew how inflammable wer=
e their palisades of=20

wood.  When a hundred torches came to be applied only a miracle could save =
them.  At this=20

critical moment panic seized the Iroquois camp.  A rumour had spread that a=
 mighty army of=20

Hurons were descending upon them, and they resolved, in spite of their chie=
fs, to retreat at once.=20

But before fleeing from their imaginary foe, they took nearly all their pri=
soners and thrust them,=20

bound hand and foot, into the bark dwellings of St. Ignace.  They spared ne=
ither men nor women,=20

young nor old, not even tiny babes.  When they had done this they applied t=
he torch to the town.=20

Of the two priests, the giant, Jean de Brbeuf, was led apart and fastened t=
o a stake.  From thence=20

he called to the others, exhorting them to suffer patiently and God would r=
eward them.  They=20

tortured him, but he still stood erect, tall and masterful, and addressed h=
is people.  For this the=20

angry Iroquois cut away his lower lip and thrust a red-hot iron down his th=
roat.  Round the naked=20

body of Father Lalement they tied strips of bark steeped in pitch and set h=
im in a blaze.  As if this=20

were not enough agony, on the heads of both they poured boiling water and c=
ut strips of flesh from=20

Brbeuf's limbs.  "You told us," cried the fiends, laughing, "that {73} the =
more one suffers on earth=20

the happier he is in heaven.  We wish to make you happy.  We torment you in=
 this way because=20

we love you; and you ought to thank us for it!"  Still from Brbeuf came no =
sign of flinching.  Baffled=20

in devising further tortures, they cut off his head and tore his body in pi=
eces. The heart of this great=20

man, the founder of the ill-fated Huron mission, was seized by an Iroquois =
chief and devoured.=20

His friend Lalement, after being tortured all night, was killed by a blow f=
rom a hatchet.  Two or=20

three days afterwards, when the fleeing Iroquois were leagues away, the Jes=
uits at St. Mary came=20

to the smoking ruins of St. Ignace.  The scorched and mangled remains of th=
e two martyrs met=20

their horrified gaze.  These they carried back to St. Mary and buried, all =
but Brbeuf's skull, which=20

they preserved as a holy relic.  At the Hotel Dieu at Quebec it is shown to=
 the visitor, enclosed in a=20

silver bust of the martyr, which his family sent to the good nuns from Fran=
ce.  Upon the Hurons=20

such a disaster as this told with crushing force. Flight from their country=
 was all they could think of=20

now.  Two weeks later they abandoned for ever fifteen towns to roam northwa=
rd and eastward in=20

the barren, inhospitable wilderness.  In various places the fugitives found=
 refuge, some with this=20

tribe, some with that, but as a strong, separate nation they soon ceased to=
 be, and the fort and=20

mission of St. Mary on the Wye was left solitary in the middle of a great w=
aste.  All the love and=20

labour of the Jesuit missionaries {74} for ten years had been in vain.  Wit=
h aching hearts the=20

priests resolved to break up the mission and betake themselves to some less=
 dangerous and more=20

useful station.  Several of them followed the wandering Hurons, but a numbe=
r of priests, with forty=20

soldiers and labourers, established themselves on St. Joseph Island, at the=
 entrance of=20

Matchedash Bay. It is one of three--now known as Faith, Hope, and Charity--=
islands. Here they=20

toiled, together with a number of Huron converts, in building a stronghold =
which would defy the=20

dreaded Iroquois.  Six or eight thousand souls came to people the island.  =
There not being food for=20



so many, what with hunger and disease, by springtime half had perished.  Th=
e despairing=20

survivors, resolving to brave the surrounding Iroquois, who roamed on the m=
ainland, and escape,=20

one by one fell into the hands of their lynx-like foes.  No refuge was ther=
e for the poor persecuted=20

race but in the shadow of the French guns at Quebec.  "Take us to Quebec," =
cried one of the=20

Huron chiefs to the Jesuit fathers.  "Do not wait until war and famine have=
 destroyed us to the last=20

man.  We are in your hands.  Death has taken more than ten thousand of us. =
 If you wait longer,=20

not one will remain alive."  At last the Jesuits resolved to grant their pe=
tition.  On the 10th of June=20

1650 the whole population of St. Joseph (or Charity) Island embarked in can=
oes, which were=20

packed with all their earthly goods, and paddled sadly towards the east.  O=
n the Ottawa River,=20

which was now desolate of native hut or wigwam, they met a large party of {=
75} French soldiers=20

and Hurons on the way to help the Huron mission.  Too late!  The mission, w=
ith all its forts and=20

settlements, had been abandoned for ever.  The entire party kept on to Mont=
real, where the=20

Hurons could not be induced to stay because it was too open to Iroquois att=
acks; and about the=20

end of July the great heights of Quebec came in sight.  All disembarked and=
 were hospitably=20

received by the Governor, the priests, the nuns, and the people.  Yet the n=
ew arrivals could not=20

have come at a worse time, for food was scarce and nearly all were poor.   =
  {76}  CHAPTER VI=20

THE FURY OF THE IROQUOIS  When the poor harassed "Black Robes" and their pa=
nic-stricken=20

Indian charges finally rested under the sheltering walls of Quebec, Montmag=
ny was no longer=20

Governor.  He had, after twelve years' service, gone back to France, and a =
new Governor had=20

arrived in his stead.  But the Indians still called the new Governor, and a=
ll the Governors who=20

came afterwards, by the name of "Onontio."  They were told that Montmagny i=
n French signified=20

"Great Mountain," Onontio in the Huron tongue, and supposed it was a title =
bestowed by the pale-

faces on all their rulers in Canada.  Despite the unspeakable horrors, bloo=
dshed, and martyrdom=20

related in the last chapter, nothing of lasting value was accomplished by t=
he hapless mission to=20

the Hurons except a knowledge of the great Lake Superior, which an interpre=
ter, named Jean=20

Nicollet, had discovered a few years before.  Season now followed season, a=
nd each saw the=20

French but little better than prisoners in their three towns on the St. Law=
rence.  If they=20


_
did not expect was something we came upon when the tunnel had been driven t=
hree miles into the=20

mountain."  "What did you find?" asked Tom, who knew enough about geology t=
o understand the=20

terms used. Mr. Damon did not, however, and when Mr. Titus rolled off some =
of the technical=20

words, the drug investor softly murmured such expressions as  "Bless my the=
rmometer! Bless my=20

porous plaster!"  "We found," resumed Mr. Titus, "after we had bored for a =
considerable distance=20

into the mountain, a mass of volcanic rock which is so hard that our best d=
iamond drills are dulled=20

in a short time, and the explosives we use merely shatter the face of the c=
utting, and give us=20

hardly any progress at all.  "It was after several trials, and when my brot=
her found the Iroquois a=20

chance to spring upon them and bear {77} back their scalps in triumph to th=
eir lodges in the=20

wilderness.  The French might have made a treaty of alliance with their Eng=
lish neighbours in New=20

England, who had now set up a number of towns and were flourishing, althoug=
h they too were at=20

the mercy of the surrounding savages.  But the French Governor made it a co=
ndition of the treaty=20

that the New Englanders should help Canada to exterminate the terrible Iroq=
uois.  This the English=20

colonists were loath to do; they had no wish to bring the Iroquois tomahawk=
s down upon their=20

heads also, as the French had done; and so the plan fell through.  After a =
time one of the Iroquois=20

tribes, having lost a great many of their fighting men in the=20


_
making scarcely any progress, compared to the energy of his men and the bla=
sting, that he wrote=20

to me, explaining matters. I at once thought of you, Tom Swift, and your po=
werful explosive, for I=20

had read about it.  "Now then, will you sell us some of your powder--explos=
ive or whatever you call=20

it--Mr. Swift, or tell us where we can get it? We need it soon, for we are =
losing valuable time."  Mr.=20

Titus paused to draw on a piece of paper a rough map of Peru, and the distr=
ict where the tunnel=20

was being constructed. He showed where the two railroad lines were, and whe=
re the new route=20

would bring them together, the tunnel eliminating a big grade up which it w=
ould have been=20

impossible to haul trains of any weight.  "What do you say, Mr. Swift?" the=
 contractor concluded.=20

"Will you let us have some of your powder? Or, better still, will you come =
to Peru yourself? That=20

would suit us immensely, for you could be right on the ground. And you coul=
d carry out your plan=20

of going with your friend here," and Mr. Titus nodded toward Mr. Damon. "Th=
at is, if you were=20

thinking of going."  "Well, I was thinking of it," Tom admitted. "Mr. Damon=
 and I have been on so=20

many trips together that it seems sort of natural for us to 'team it.' I ha=
ve never been to Peru, and I=20

should like to see the country. There is only one matter idea occurred to t=
hem that the unfortunate=20

Hurons and Algonquins, who had joined their fortunes to the French, would b=
e the very men for=20

their purpose, if they could only induce them to desert the alliance. Forth=
with they sent courtiers to=20

announce to the Hurons that they no longer bore them any grudge and were wi=
lling to adopt them-

-to receive them into the bosom of their lodges.  But it soon appeared that=
 all the Iroquois were not=20

unanimous in their approval of this plan, and as their treachery was well k=
nown, the Hurons and=20

Algonquins, now settled on the Isle of Orleans near Quebec, naturally hesit=
ated about accepting=20

the offer.  The few foolish ones who trusted in Iroquois good faith were ac=
tually tomahawked by=20

their so-called friends on the way to the Iroquois lodges.  In attempting t=
o punish a band of=20

Iroquois ambushed near his fort, Du Plessis Bochat, the Governor of {78} Th=
ree Rivers, lost his=20

life; Father Buteaux was killed on his way to his mission, and another prie=
st, Father Poucet, was=20

borne away to a Mohawk village, and after being tortured was sent back to Q=
uebec to offer peace=20

to the French.  Peace was indeed welcome, but the French were naturally sti=
ll suspicious. The=20

truth was that the Iroquois were then too busily engaged in destroying the =
Eries, a tribe which had=20

burned one of their most=20


_
"What is it?" asked Mr. Titus quickly. "If it is a question of money dismis=
s it from your mind. The=20

Peruvian government is paying a large sum for this tunnel, and we stand to =
make considerable,=20

even if we were the lowest bidders. We can afford to pay you well--that is,=
 we shall be able to if we=20

can complete the bore on time. That is what is bothering me now--the unexpe=
cted strata of hard=20

rock we have met with, which seems impossible to blast. But I feel sure we =
can do it with the=20

explosive used in your giant cannon."  "That is just the point!" Tom exclai=
med. "I am not so sure=20

my explosive would do."  "Why not?" the tunnel contractor asked. "It's powe=
rful enough; isn't it?"=20

"Yes, it is powerful enough, but whether it will have the right effect on v=
olcanic rock is hard to say.=20

I should like to see a rock sample."  "I can telegraph to have illustrious =
chiefs, to spare time to=20

massacre the pale-faces.  As the chief, a Seneca, had stood with unquiverin=
g nerve at the stake=20

he had cried out, "Eries, you burn in me an entire nation!" for he knew the=
 Senecas would avenge=20

his death.  Much, then, as the Governor, De Lauzon, wanted peace, neither h=
e nor his Indian allies=20

knew how far they could trust the Iroquois.  It was at last decided that if=
 the Onondagas, one of the=20

five Iroquois nations, would receive a Jesuit mission, a body of Hurons sho=
uld be sent under=20

escort to be adopted into their tribe.  From the Onondagas there came a mes=
sage to say they=20

would agree to this, and in June 1656 the expedition set out from Quebec.  =
It consisted of a large=20

body of Hurons, as well as Onondagas, fifty French soldiers, led by the bra=
ve captain, Dupuy, and=20

two priests, Dablon and Chaumonot.=20


_
eagerly. "Meantime, here is a description of it. I can read you that"; and,=
 taking a letter from his=20

pocket, he read to Tom a geological description of the hard rock.  "Hum! Ye=
s," mused Tom, as he=20

listened. "It seems to be of the nature of obsidian."  "Bless my watch chai=
n!" cried Mr. Damon.=20

"What's that?"  under way, when a band of Mohawks fell upon them, and befor=
e they pretended to=20

discover that they were attacking members of their own confederacy, they ha=
d killed and wounded=20

a number of Onondagas. Profuse excuses and apologies followed, the Mohawks =
explaining that=20

they took them, the Onondagas, for Hurons.=20
