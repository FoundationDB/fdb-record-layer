dracaena marginata I entreat you to gather up your courage. I assure you th=
at these wretched people are not unkind: misery--not unlike that which you =
yourself have endured--has made them what they are. No doubt we should have=
 arranged for a better place for you wherein to await your friends if we ha=
d the choice. But you will understand that your safety and our to sail alon=
gside o' me this bout?"  "Of course I am, Fred.  A man that can steer his w=
ay by compass over such a sea o' grass is worth holding on to."  "Well, the=
n, heave ahead.  We'll hunt in couples.  I see they're gettin' into line o'=
 battle, which means that the enemy's in view."  The sailor was right.  Buf=
falo were seen grazing in the far dracaena marginata I entreat you to gathe=
r up your courage. I assure you that these wretched people are not unkind: =
misery--not unlike that which you yourself have endured--has made them what=
 they are. No doubt we should have arranged for a better place for you wher=
ein to await your friends if we had the choice. But you will understand tha=
t your safety and our to sail alongside o' me this bout?"  "Of course I am,=
 Fred.  A man that can steer his way by compass over such a sea o' grass is=
 worth holding on to."  "Well, then, heave ahead.  We'll hunt in couples.  =
I see they're gettin' into line o' battle, which means that the enemy's in =
view."  The sailor was right.  Buffalo were seen grazing in the far _
goodly number of women, some of whom had tiny, miserable atoms of humanity =
clinging to their=20

ragged skirts. A group of men in tattered shirts, bare shins and sabots sto=
od in the centre of the=20

room and had apparently been in conclave when the entrance of Yvonne and he=
r guide caused=20

them to turn quickly to the door and to scan the new-comers with a furtive,=
 suspicious look which=20

would have been pathetic had it not been so full of evil intent. The mutter=
ed blasphemy had come=20

from this group; one or two of the men spat upon the ground in the directio=
n of the door, where=20

Yvonne instinctively had remained rooted to the spot.  As for the women, th=
ey only betrayed their=20

sex by the ragged clothes which they wore: there was not a face here which =
had on it a single line=20

of softness or of gentleness: they might have been old women or young: thei=
r hair was of a=20

uniform, nondescript colour, lank and unkempt, hanging in thin strands over=
 their brows; their eyes=20

new cart and horse, a new gun, and a new outfit--all received on credit--to=
 be paid for by the=20

proceeds of the chase, as the creditors, hoping against hope, tried to beli=
eve; never to be paid for=20

at all, as the easy-going La Certe more than half suspected--though he was =
far too honest a man=20

to admit that even to himself.  Of course, Slowfoot was with him--amiable, =
meek, and silent as=20

ever. And so was Baby La Certe, a five-year-old by that time, and obviously=
 a girl with a stronger=20

penchant than ever for tobacco!  "The buffalo have been found already," sai=
d Dechamp to Dan=20

Davidson, as the latter rode into camp at the head of his party.  "Bourassi=
n has just come in with=20

the report that they are in great numbers away to the nor'-west, so we will=
 make a fair start first=20

thing in the morning."  As he spoke, Dechamp glanced with evident surprise =
at Duncan McKay.=20

"Why did you let him come?" he said in an under-tone to Dan, as they were t=
ying up the horses.=20


_
cheeks either flaccid or haggard--there was no individuality amongst them--=
just one uniform=20

sisterhood of wretchedness which had already gone hand in hand with crime. =
 Across one angle of=20

the room there was a high wooden counter like a bar, on which stood a numbe=
r of jugs and=20

bottles, some chunks of bread and pieces of cheese, and a collection of pew=
ter mugs. An old man=20

and a fat, coarse-featured, middle-aged woman stood behind it and dispensed=
 various noxious-

looking liquors. Above their heads upon the grimy, tumble-down wall the Rep=
ublican device=20

"Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!" was scrawled in charcoal in huge characters=
, and below it was=20

scribbled the hideous doggrel which an impious mind had fashioned last autu=
mn on the subject of=20

the martyred Queen.   IV  Yvonne had closed her eyes for a moment as she en=
tered; now she=20

turned appealingly toward her guide.  "Must it be in here?" she asked.  "I =
am afraid it must," he=20

replied with a sigh. "You told me that you would be brave."  She pulled her=
self together resolutely.=20

"I will be brave," she said quietly.  "Ah! that's better," he rejoined. "I =
give you my word that you will=20

be absolutely safe in here  "How could I prevent him?" replied Dan.  Next m=
orning all was bustle,=20

eager expectation, and lively conversation in the camp.  Archie was there a=
gain, promoted to the=20

condition of a full-fledged hunter by the possession of a gun.  Little Bill=
 was there also.  He had=20

improved so much in health and strength that he was permitted to ride with =
the runners on a pony;=20

but was to content himself with viewing the battle from afar--that is, well=
 in rear.  "Now, Little Bill,"=20

said Archie, with the seriousness of a grandfather, as they galloped with t=
he hunters over the=20

rolling plains, across which were streaming the first beams of the rising s=
un, "you must promise=20

me to keep well in rear, and on no account to join in the chase.  It's of n=
o use to go in without a=20

gun, you know, and there is great risk when in the thick of it, that you ma=
y come across a bullet or=20

two.  You'll have all the fun without the danger, Little Bill."  "All right=
, old boy; I'll do my best."=20

"Hallo, Archie!" cried Jenkins, galloping up alongside, with the blunderbus=
s in his left hand, "I've=20

bin lookin' for you, lad.  It's not easy to spy out a friend in such a shoa=
l o' queer craft.  Are=20
