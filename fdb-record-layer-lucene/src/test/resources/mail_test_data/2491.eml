knowledge of the truth and of the One Being;"(396) for what St. Paul condemns is not the true, but 

only the false, Gnosis and its abuses: otherwise how could he use the language of a Platonist _pur 

sang_? The Ideas, types (Archai), of the Greek Philosopher; the Intelligences of Pythagoras; the 

AEons or Emanations of the Pantheist; the Logos or Word, Chief of these Intelligences; the Sophia 

or Wisdom; the Demiurgos, the Builder of the world under the direction of the Father, the 

Unmanifested Logos, from which He emanates; Ain-Suph, the Unknown of the Infinite; the angelic 

Periods; the _Seven_ Spirits who are the representatives of the _Seven_ of all the older 

cosmogonies--are all to be found in his writings, recognized by the Church as canonical and 

divinely inspired. Therein, too, may be recognized the Depths of Ahriman, Rector of this our World, 

the "God of this World;" the Pleroma of the Intelligences; the Archontes of the air; the 

Principalities, the Kabalistic Metatron; and they can easily be identified again in the Roman 

Catholic writers when read in the original Greek and Latin texts, English translations giving but a 

very poor idea of the real contents of these.      SECTION XXIII. WHAT THE OCCULTISTS AND 

KABALISTS HAVE TO SAY.   The _Zohar_, an unfathomable store of hidden wisdom and 

mystery, is very often appealed to by Roman Catholic writers. A very learned Rabbi, now the 

Chevalier Drach, having been converted to Roman Catholicism, and being a great Hebraist, 

thought fit to step into the shoes of Picus de Mirandola and John Reuchlin, and to assure his new 

co-religionists that the _Zohar_ contained in it pretty nearly all the dogmas of Catholicism. It is not 

our province to show here how far he has succeeded or failed; only to bring one instance of his 

explanations and preface it with the following:  The _Zohar_, as already shown, is not a genuine 

production of the Hebrew mind. It is the repository and compendium of the oldest doctrines of the 

East, transmitted orally at first, and then written down in independent treatises during the Captivity 

at Babylon, and finally brought together by Rabbi Simeon Ben Iochai, toward the beginning of the 

Christian era. As Mosaic cosmogony was born under a new form in Mesopotamian countries, so 

the _Zohar_ was a vehicle in which were focussed rays from the light of Universal Wisdom. 

Whatever likenesses are found between it and the Christian teachings, the compilers of the 

_Zohar_ never had Christ in their minds. Were it otherwise there would not be one single Jew of 

the Mosaic law left in the world by this time. Again, if one is to accept literally what the _Zohar_ 

says, then any religion under the sun may find corroboration in its symbols and allegorical sayings; 

and this, simply because this work is the echo of the primitive truths, and every creed is founded 

on some of these; the _Zohar_ being but a veil of the Secret Doctrine. This is so evident that we 

have only to point to the said ex- Rabbi, the Chevalier Drach, to prove the fact.  In Part III, fol. 87 

(col. 346th) the _Zohar_ treats of the Spirit guiding the Sun, its Rector, explaining that it is not the 

Sun itself that is meant thereby, but the Spirit "on, or _under_" the Sun. Drach is anxious to show 

that it was Christ who was meant by that "Sun," or the Solar Spirit therein. In his comment upon 

that passage which refers to the Solar Spirit as "that stone which the builders rejected," he asserts 

most positively that this       Sun-stone (_pierre soleil_) is identical with Christ, who was that 

stone,   and that therefore       The sun is undeniably (_sans contredit_) the second hypostasis of 

the Deity,(397) or Christ.   If this be true, then the Vaidic or pre-Vaidic Aryans, Chaldaeans and 

Egyptians, like all Occultists past, present, and future, Jews included, have been Christians from 

all eternity. If this be not so, then modern Church Christianity is Paganism pure and simple 

exoterically, and transcendental and practical Magic, or Occultism, Esoterically.  For this "stone" 



has a manifold significance, a dual existence, with gradations, a regular progression and 

retrogression. It is a "mystery" indeed.  The Occultists are quite ready to agree with St. 

Chrysostom, that the infidels--the _profane_, rather--       Being blinded by sun-light, thus lose 

sight of the true Sun in the     contemplation of the false one.   But if that Saint, and along with him 

now the Hebraist Drach, chose to see in the _Zohar_ and the Kabalistic Sun "the _second_ 

hypostasis," this is no reason why all others should be blinded by them. The mystery of the Sun is 

the grandest perhaps, grand to promise anything; he purposed only to do all that he could to 

increase the glory of his name.  As to that, we know D'Artagnan's courage; he exposed himself 

freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the 

chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle. He had been seen falling from his horse and 

had not been seen to rise; every one, therefore, believed him to be dead, especially those to 

whom his death would give promotion. One believes readily what he wishes to believe. Now in the 

army, from the division-generals who desire the death of the general-in-chief, to the soldiers who 

desire the death of the corporals, all desire some one's death.  But D'Artagnan was not a man to 

let himself be killed like that. After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on 

the battle-field, the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself. He gained a village, 

knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and 

everywhere received in France. He was petted, tended, cured; and one fine morning, in better 

health than ever before, he set out for France. Once in France he turned his course toward Paris, 

and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne.  But D'Artagnan found in his chamber the 

personal equipment of a man, complete, except for the sword, arranged along the wall.  "He has 

returned," said he. "So much the worse, and so much the better!"  It need not be said that 

D'Artagnan was still thinking of the husband. He made inquiries and discovered that the servants 

were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk.  "Alone?" asked D'Artagnan.  "With 

monsieur."  "Monsieur has returned, then?"  "Of course," naively replied the servant.  "If I had any 

money," said D'Artagnan to himself, "I would go away; but I have none. I must stay and follow the 

advice of my hostess, while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition."  He had 

just completed this monologue--which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more 

natural than the monologue--when the servant-maid, watching at the door, suddenly cried out: 

"Ah! see! here is madame returning with monsieur."  D'Artagnan looked out and at the corner of 

Rue Montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss, who 

tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend Porthos. 

"Is that monsieur?" said D'Artagnan to himself. "Oh! oh! he has grown a good deal, it seems to 

me." And he sat down in the hall, choosing a conspicuous place.  The hostess, as she entered, 

saw D'Artagnan and uttered a little cry, whereupon D'Artagnan, judging that he had been 

recognized, rose, ran to her and embraced her tenderly. The Swiss, with an air of stupefaction, 

looked at the hostess, who turned pale.  "Ah, it is you, monsieur! What do you want of me?" she 

asked, in great distress.  "Is monsieur your cousin? Is monsieur your brother?" said D'Artagnan, 

not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing. And without waiting for her 

reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian, who received him with great coldness.  "Who 

is that man?" he asked.  The hostess replied only by gasps.  "Who is that Swiss?" asked 

D'Artagnan.  "Monsieur is going to marry me," replied the hostess, between two gasps.  "Your 



husband, then, is at last dead?"  "How does that concern you?" replied the Swiss.  "It concerns me 

much," said D'Artagnan, "since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since----" 

"And since?" asked the Swiss.  "And since--I do not give it," said the musketeer.  The Swiss 

became as purple as a peony. He wore his elegant uniform, D'Artagnan was wrapped in a sort of 

gray cloak; the Swiss was six feet high, D'Artagnan was hardly more than five; the Swiss 

considered himself on his own ground and regarded D'Artagnan as an intruder.  "Will you go away 

from here?" demanded the Swiss, stamping violently, like a man who begins to be seriously angry. 

"I? By no means!" said D'Artagnan.  "Some one must go for help," said a lad, who could not 

comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man, who was so large. 

D'Artagnan, with a sudden accession of wrath, seized the lad by the ear and led him apart, with 

the injunction:  "Stay you where you are and don't you stir, or I will pull this ear off. As for you, 

illustrious descendant of William Tell, you will straightway get together your clothes which are in 

my room and which annoy me, and go out quickly to another lodging."  The Swiss began to laugh 

boisterously. "I go out?" he 


_
Gordian knot, truly, but one that cannot be severed with the double-edged sword of scholastic 

casuistry. It is a true _deo dignus vindice nodus_, and can be untied only by the _Gods_. The 

meaning of this is plain, and every Kabalist will understand it.  _Contra solem ne loquaris_ was not 

said by Pythagoras with regard to the visible Sun. It was the "Sun of Initiation" that was meant, in 

its triple form--two of which are the "Day-Sun" and the "Night-Sun."  If behind the physical luminary 

there were no mystery that people sensed instinctively, why should every nation, from the primitive 

peoples down to the Parsis of to-day, have turned towards the Sun during prayers? The Solar 

Trinity is not Mazdean, but is universal, and is as old as man. All the temples in Antiquity were 

invariably made to face the Sun, their portals to open to the East. See the old temples of Memphis 

and Baalbec, the Pyramids of the Old and of the New (?) Worlds, the Round Towers of Ireland, 

and the Serapeum of Egypt. The Initiates alone could give a philosophical explanation of this, and 

a reason for it--its mysticism notwithstanding--were only the world ready to receive it, which alas! it 

is not. The last of the Solar Priests in Europe was the Imperial Initiate, Julian, now called the 

Apostate.(398) He tried to benefit the world by revealing at least a portion of the great mystery of 

the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL 

LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

FINAL SIGMA~} and--_he died_. "There are three in one," he said of the Sun--the central 

Sun(399) being a precaution of Nature: the first is the universal cause of all, Sovereign Good and 

perfection; the Second Power is paramount Intelligence, having dominion over all reasonable 

beings, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

FINAL SIGMA~}; the third is the visible Sun. The pure energy of solar intelligence proceeds from 

the luminous seat occupied by our Sun in the centre of heaven, that pure energy being the Logos 

of our system; the "Mysterious Word Spirit produces all through the Sun, and never operates 

through any other medium," says Hermes Trismegistus. For it is _in_ the Sun, more than in any 

other  "Ah, very well!" said D'Artagnan; "I see that you understand French. Come then, and take a 

turn with me and I will explain."  The hostess, who knew D'Artagnan's skill with the sword, began 

to weep and tear her hair. D'Artagnan turned toward her, saying, "Then send him away, madame." 

"Pooh!" said the Swiss, who had needed a little time to take in D'Artagnan's proposal, "pooh! who 

are you, in the first place, to ask me to take a turn with you?"  "I am lieutenant in his majesty's 

musketeers," said D'Artagnan, "and consequently your superior in everything; only, as the 

question now is not of rank, but of quarters--you know the custom--come and seek for yours; the 

first to return will recover his chamber."  D'Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on 

the part of the hostess, who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover, though she 

would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by 

the refusal of her hand.  It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle. 

D'Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber; the Swiss refused by 

shaking his head, and drew his sword.  "Then you will lie here," said D'Artagnan. "It is a wretched 

bed, but that is not my fault, and it is you who have chosen it." With these words he drew in his 



turn and crossed swords with his adversary.  He had to contend against a strong wrist, but his 

agility was superior to all force. The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it, by 

reason of the cold; but suddenly feebleness, occasioned by loss of blood, obliged him to sit down. 

"There!" said D'Artagnan, "what did I tell you? Fortunately, you won't be laid up more than a 

fortnight. Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the boy. Good-by! Oh, by the way, you'd 

better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote. You will be well fed there, if the 

hostess remains the same. Adieu."  Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent 

to the Swiss the things that belonged to him. The boy found him sitting where D'Artagnan had left 

him, still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary.  The boy, the hostess, and all the house 

had the same regard for D'Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to 

repeat his twelve labors.  But when he was alone with the hostess he said: "Now, pretty 

Madeleine, you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman. As for you, you have 

acted like a barmaid. So much

habitation. Only neither Hermes Trismegistus nor Julian (an initiated Occultist), nor any other, 

meant by this Unknown Cause Jehovah, or Jupiter. They referred to the cause that produced all 

the manifested "great Gods" or Demiurgi (the Hebrew God included) of our system. Nor was our 

visible, _material_ Sun meant, for the latter was only the manifested symbol. Philolaus the 

Pythagorean, explains and completes Trismegistus by saying:       The Sun is a mirror of fire, the 

splendour of whose flames by     their reflection in that mirror [the Sun] is poured upon us, and 

that splendour conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage. I have driven away the Swiss 

to humiliate you, but I shall lodge here no longer. I will not sleep where I must scorn. Ho, there, 

boy! Have my valise carried to the Muid d'Amour, Rue des Bourdonnais. Adieu, madame."  In 

saying these words D'Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved. The hostess 

threw herself at his feet, asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence. What more 

need be said? The spit turned, the stove roared, the pretty Madeleine wept; D'Artagnan felt 

himself invaded by hunger, cold and love. He 


_
It is evident that Philolaus referred to the central spiritual Sun, whose beams and effulgence are 

only mirrored by our central Star, the Sun. This is as clear to the Occultists as it was to the 

Pythagoreans. As for the profane of pagan antiquity, it was, of course, the physical Sun that was 

the "highest God" for them, as it seems--if Chevalier Drach's view be accepted--to have now 

virtually become for the modern Roman Catholics. If words mean anything, the pardoned he 

remained.  And this explains how D'Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne, at the Hotel de 

la Chevrette.  D'Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood, finding a somewhat lively 

pleasure in carrying Mazarin's bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once 

called his own and which he had seen on the minister's finger that night.  "Should that diamond 

ever fall into my hands again," he reflected, "I would turn it at once into
