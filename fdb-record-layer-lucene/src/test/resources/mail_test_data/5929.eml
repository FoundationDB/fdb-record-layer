  We found the descent to the boat incomparably _
Macao for medical treatment in July, 1820, and this letter was written from=
 that city, on November=20

28 of that year. He thus writes: "I arrived with my wife and daughter at Ma=
nilla last March, was=20

received with great apparent attention, politeness & hospitality. After liv=
ing there a couple of=20

months, however, I perceived that there existed a vast deal of jealousy and=
 envy, against all=20

strangers, and particularly those who resided or intended to form establish=
ments in the country.=20

Those ignorant people could not divest themselves of this feeling, even tow=
ard those, whose=20

capitals, talents and industry, were directed to the most laudable pursuits=
, and promised to=20

produce great public as well as private advantages to the colony. At this c=
risis several french ships=20

were in the port, one or two Americans and a English ship from Bengal. In t=
he French ships, had=20

arrived a naturalist sent out by the government to make collections, and so=
me persons, who=20

intended to remain in the Philippines to cultivate sugar, cotton &c. &c. In=
 the month of July last, I=20

discovered that I had in my travels, contracted a disease, called by the Do=
ctr Hydrocele and=20

becoming very troublesome to me, I determined as there are no good surgeons=
 in Manilla to pay a=20

short visit to Macao with my family & return to my post, as soon as circums=
tances would permit,=20

after the operation. This I found, I could do the more conveniently, as my =
Nephew, a fine young=20

Man of 23 years, had joined me at my arrival and I left him, in full charge=
 of my office &c and=20

departed. This envious disposition, on the part of the Spaniards, increased=
 daily, against the=20

Strangers, until an opportunity presented itself of gratifying their malign=
ant hatred, in the most=20

cruel & bloody manner & without themselves appearing to have any thing to d=
o in the business. It=20

is necessary first to tell you, that the new constitution, had been receive=
d during the prevalence of=20

this feeling, giving extensive privileges & liberal encouragement to foreig=
ners, who might think=20

proper to settle in the Philippines & rendering the natives as free & equal=
, in rights, etc. as their=20

former masters. This certainly made them a little unruly, but, if not secre=
tly instigated, it would=20

never have induced them to commit a crime, that makes humanity shudder. The=
 ship from Bengal,=20

was the Merope Captain Nichols and it was supposed she had brot into the co=
lony the epidemic,=20

that has ravaged all India, this year, under the name of the 'Cholera Morbu=
s.' It made its=20

appearance, in the beginning of October last, carrying off great numbers of=
 the Indians every day.=20

The humane French & other Strangers, who beheld these miserable wretches, d=
ying around them=20

without any medical aid, freely administered what medicines they had, and w=
ere actively & daily=20

employed, in endeavoring to alleviate; the distress & cure the complaints o=
f all those, who lived=20

within the sphere of their exertions. This also became, a cause of jealousy=
 and hatred and the=20

villains, began immediately to exasperate we closed the land, sprang on to =
the rocks, and at once=20

set about the tedious task of breasting the hill. Hill climbing, under the =
vertical sun of North=20

Australia, is by no means an enjoyable undertaking, more particularly when =
the loose shale and=20

rock gives way at every stride, bringing down an avalanche of rubbish on th=
e heads of the=20

rearmost of the party.  Encumbered with our carbines, we made but slow prog=
ress, and it was=20

nearly six o'clock before we attained the summit, from whence we saw severa=
l canoes making=20

their way with full speed towards Hinchinbrook.  "So far then, so good," we=
 said; "we have made=20

certain that none of the rascals are lurking about the two islands, and we =
are sure to get them=20

now, when we sweep Hinchinbrook."  We had now done everything that was poss=
ible until the=20

'Daylight' had finished unloading, and so spread ourselves out about the is=
land to see if the blacks=20

had left any of their curious implements behind them.  We were in no hurry =
to get back to the=20



township, so purposed having supper where we were, and pulling back in the =
cool of the evening,=20

by the light of the moon, which was just then in full glory.  We found plen=
ty of traces of the blacks,=20

the embers of their fires even still glowing, but they had carried off ever=
ything with them, and no=20

trophies crowned our search of Gould Island; and yet I am wrong, for I got =
one memento, which I=20

have by me still, and which is so curious to lovers of natural history that=
 I am tempted to describe=20

it.  In rummaging about, I came to a place strewed with old bones, shells, =
parrots' feathers, etc.,=20

close to which stood a platform of interwoven sticks.  I was terribly puzzl=
ed at first to account for=20

the presence of this miniature rag and bone depot, and my astonishment culm=
inated when=20

Ferdinand informed me that--  "Bird been make it that fellow; plenty d--d t=
hief that fellow, steal like=20

it pipe, like it anything."  It then flashed across me that I had fallen in=
 with the "run" of the bower-

bird, of which I had so often heard, and had so often sought for without su=
ccess.  The satin bower-

bird ('Ptilonorhynchus holosericus') belongs to the family of starlings, an=
d though tolerably=20

common in New South Wales, is but a rare visitor to the hotter climate of N=
orthern Queensland.=20

The plumage of the adult male is of a glossy satin-like purple, appearing a=
lmost black, whilst the=20

females and the young are all of an olive-greenish colour.  The peculiarity=
 for which this bird is=20

generally known, is its habit of constructing a sort of arbour of dry twigs=
, to act as a playground.=20

These bowers are usually made in some secluded place in the bush--not infre=
quently under the=20

shady boughs of a large tree--and vary considerably in size, according to t=
he number of birds=20

resorting to them, for they seem to be joint-stock affairs, and are not lim=
ited to one pair. The bower=20

itself is somewhat difficult to describe, and a better idea can be formed f=
rom the engraving, or by=20

visiting the British Museum, where several are shown, than I=20


_
by saying, 'this poisonous disease, was introduced by the French & the othe=
r strangers, they have=20

poisoned even the waters, and they administer poison to the sick, purposely=
 to exterpate the=20

whole race of Tagalians.' The ferocious Indians wanted nothing farther to e=
xcite them to deeds of=20

blood & plunder. On the 9th of October about 10 or 11 in the morning they c=
ollected, to the=20

number of about 3,000 Men armed with pikes knives and bludgeons and proceed=
ed coolly and=20

deliberately to plunder and Massacre all the hope to set before the reader =
in words. A number of=20

sticks, most artistically woven together, form the base, from the centre of=
 which the walls of the=20

structure arise.  These walls are made of lighter twigs, and considerable p=
ains must be taken in=20

their selection, for they all have an inward curve, which in some "runs" ca=
use the sides almost to=20

meet at the top.  The degree of forethought that these self-taught architec=
ts possess is strikingly=20

exemplified in the fact that, whilst building the walls, any forks=20


_
on whom they could lay their hands! I have not time to give you the details=
 of this shocking=20

business, but you will certainly read them in the gazettes as I have sent b=
oth to England and=20

Russia very full accounts for publication. Suffice it now to say that the G=
overnor & the authorities=20

were vainly implored for assistance. They came, it is true, with the troops=
, but it was only to behold=20

with sang froid the horrid spectacle. Not a musket was fired to save the li=
ves of those unfortunate=20

and defenceless strangers, who to the number of 39 were plundered & cruelly=
 massacred; some=20

of them were so cut up & mangled it was impossible to recognize them. As th=
e most of them were=20

Roman Catholics, they were all collected and thrown into a hole together wi=
thout the shadow of a=20

ceremony or a stone to mark their graves! What is worse, the last accts fro=
m there down to the 9th=20

of November mention that not a spanish life was lost, nor has a single nati=
ve as yet suffered=20

punishment for this most atrocious & horrible deed. My house was attacked &=
 pillaged, my=20

Nephew & a Mr Prince of Boston, who lived with him, made prisonners, and, a=
fter being near two=20

days in the hands of the Indians, suffering the most abominable treatment, =
they luckily escaped=20

Death. Eighty five Chinese & 11 English seamen were also plundered & assass=
inated. I have=20

been obliged to represent this affair in its full suit of Black to 'outward=
s', so as to offer no=20

impediment to their free passage when skylarking (if it is not an Irishism,=
 using such an expression=20

with regard to a starling) and chasing each other through and through the b=
ower, to which=20

innocent recreations, according to the testimony of Messrs. Cato and Ferdin=
and, they devote the=20

major part of their time. Their love of finery and gaudy colours is also mo=
st remarkable. Interwoven=20

amongst the twigs of which the bower is composed, and scattered about the g=
round in its vicinity,=20

are found bleached bones, broken oyster, snail, and cowrie shells, and not =
unfrequently, in the=20

more civilised districts, pieces of coloured rag, and fragments of ribbon p=
ilfered from some=20

neighbouring station, for, in search of attractive objects to decorate his =
playground, the bower-bird=20

entirely ignores the eighth commandment, and, I fear, justifies the somewha=
t strong expression of=20

"d--d thief" which Ferdinand bestowed on him. Indeed, so well are his filch=
ing propensities known=20

to the natives, that they make a practice of searching the runs whenever an=
y small article of value=20

is missing, and often succeed in recovering the lost object.  I find that I=
 have been using the=20

pronoun 'he' hitherto, whilst describing this insatiable love of finery, bu=
t on reflection I cannot but=20

think that I am utterly wrong, and that when more is known of the domestic =
arrangements of the=20


_
same time declared my intention of going back to Siberia, next April, where=
 I shall await the orders=20

of His Imperial Majesty.... I leave the place & those miscreants to themsel=
ves, from the conviction,=20

that its commerce is ruined forever. In the first place alone is responsibl=
e for this meretricious=20

taste, and that the poor 'he', whom I have so unblushingly accused, is in r=
eality gathering berries=20

and fruit for the little ones, guiltless of the slightest inclination towar=
ds picking and stealing.  These=20

birds live=20
