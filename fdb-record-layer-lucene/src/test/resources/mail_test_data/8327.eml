unprejudiced writers, that Chrestos in the pit--whether the pit be taken as meaning the grave or 

hell--had likewise a sexual element in it, from the very origin of the symbol.  This fact is no longer 

denied to-day. The "Brothers of the Rosy Cross" of the Middle Ages were as good Christians as 

any to be found in Europe, nevertheless, all their rites were based on symbols whose meaning 

was pre- eminently phallic and sexual. Their biographer, Hargrave Jennings, the best modern 

authority on Rosicrucianism, speaking of this mystic Brotherhood, describes how       The tortures 

and the sacrifice of Calvary, the Passion of the     Cross, were, in their [the Rose-Croix's] glorious 

blessed magic     and triumph, the protest and appeal.   Protest--by whom? The answer is, the 

protest of the crucified Rose, the greatest and the most unveiled of all sexual symbols--the Yoni 

and Lingam, the "victim" and the "murderer," the female and male principles in Nature. Open the 

last work of that author, _Phallicism_, and see in what glowing terms he describes the sexual 

symbolism in that which is most sacred to the Christian:       The flowing blood streamed from the 

crown, or the piercing circlet     of the thorns of Hell. The Rose is feminine. Its lustrous carmine 

petals are guarded with thorns. The Rose is the most beautiful of     flowers. The Rose is the 

Queen of God's Garden (Mary, the Virgin).     It is not the Rose alone which is the magical idea, or 

truth. But     it is the "crucified rose," or the "martyred rose" (by the grand     mystic apocalyptic 

figure) which is the talisman, the standard,     the object of adoration of all the "Sons of Wisdom" or 

the true     Rosicrucians.(540)   Not of _all_ the "Sons of Wisdom," by any means, not even of the 

_true_ Rosicrucian. For the latter would never put in such sickening relievo, in such a purely 

sensual and terrestrial, not to say animal light, the grandest, the noblest of Nature's symbols. To 

the Rosicrucian, the "Rose" was the symbol of Nature, of the ever prolific and virgin Earth, or Isis, 

the mother and nourisher of man, considered as feminine and made a sign to denote that he had 

done so.  "What! thou again! Why didst thou take it?"  "Yes--why?" asked La Ramee.  Grimaud, 

who held the piece of glass in his hand, said: "Sharp."  "True, my lord!" exclaimed La Ramee. "Ah! 

deuce take it! we have a precious fellow here!"  "Monsieur Grimaud!" said the duke, "for your sake 

I beg of you, never come within the reach of my fist!"  "Hush! hush!" cried La Ramee, "give me 

your gibbet, my lord. I will shape it out for you with my knife."  And he took the gibbet and shaped 

it out as neatly as possible.  "That's it," said the duke, "now make me a little hole in the floor whilst 

I go and fetch the culprit."  La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor; meanwhile the 

duke hung the crawfish up by a thread. Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room, 

bursting with laughter.  La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus; Grimaud, 

however, did not even smile. He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by 

the thread:  "Cardinal," he said.  "Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort!" cried the 

prisoner, laughing violently, "and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee, the king's 

commissioner."  La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet, which he broke at 

once and threw the pieces out of the window. He was going to throw the crawfish out also, when 

Grimaud snatched it from his hands.  "Good to eat!" he said, and put it in his pocket.  This scene 

so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it; but on reflection 

he hated him more and more, being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct.  But the 

story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside. Monsieur 

de Chavigny, who at heart detested the cardinal, took pains to tell the story to two or three friends, 

who put it into immediate circulation.  The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one 



man with a very good countenance; and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the 

more and more odious to him. One morning he took this man on one side and had 


_
a virgin woman by the Egyptian Initiates. Like every other personification of Nature and the Earth 

she is the sister and wife of Osiris, as the two characters answer to the personified symbol of the 

Earth, both she and the Sun being the progeny of the same mysterious Father, because the Earth 

is fecundated by the Sun--according to the earliest Mysticism--by divine insufflation. It was the 

pure ideal of mystic Nature that was personified in the "World Virgins," the "Celestial Maidens," 

and later on by the human Virgin, Mary, the Mother of the Saviour, the _Salvator Mundi_ now 

chosen by the Christian World. And it was the character of the Jewish maiden that was adapted by 

Theology to archaic Symbolism,(541) and not the Pagan symbol that was modelled for the new 

occasion.  We know through Herodotus that the Mysteries were brought from India by Orpheus--a 

hero far anterior to both Homer and Hesiod. Very little is really known of him, and till very lately 

Orphic literature, and even the Argonauts, were attributed to Onamacritus, a contemporary of 

Pisistratus, Solon and Pythagoras--who was credited with their compilation in the present form 

toward the close of the sixth century B.C., or 800 years after the time what was going on 

approached the duke respectfully, but took the guard by the arm.  "Go away," he said.  The guard 

obeyed.  "You are insupportable!" cried the duke; "I shall beat you."  Grimaud bowed.  "I will break 

every bone in your body!" cried the duke.  Grimaud bowed, but stepped back.  "Mr. Spy," cried the 

duke, more and more enraged, "I will strangle you with my own hands."  And he extended his 

hands toward Grimaud, who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him. At the 

same time he felt the duke's arms on his shoulders like two iron claws; but instead either of calling 

out or defending himself, he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone:  "Hush!" 

smiling as he uttered the word.  A gesture, a smile and a word from Grimaud, all at once, were so 

unusual that his highness stopped short, astounded.  Grimaud took advantage of that instant to 

draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal, and presented it to the duke 

without a word.  The duke, more and more bewildered, let Grimaud loose and took the note. 

"From Madame de Montbazon?" he cried.  Grimaud nodded assent.  The duke tore open the note, 

passed his hands over his eyes, for he was dazzled and 


_
there was a sacerdotal family, who, like the Brahmans with the _Vedas_, had committed to 

memory all the Orphic Hymns, and that they were usually thus transmitted from one generation to 

another. By placing Orpheus so far back as 1200 B.C., official Science--so careful in her 

chronology to choose in each case as late a period as possible--admits that the Mysteries, or in 

other words Occultism dramatised, belong to a still earlier epoch than the Chaldaean and  "My 

Dear Duke,--You may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note; he has 

consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at Vincennes with you, in 

order to prepare and assist your escape, which we are contriving. The moment of your deliverance 

is at hand; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your 

friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and
