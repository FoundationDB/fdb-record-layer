but God visits him. The description of man's dignity and dominion indicates=
 how familiar David was=20

with the story in Genesis. It may perhaps also, besides all the large proph=
etic truths which it=20

contains, have some special reference to his own earlier experience. It is =
at least worth noting that=20

when lofty thoughts of the greatness of the soul are ever natural and when =
in his case the=20

afflictions and crimes that make their presence felt in all his later works=
 had not fallen upon him.=20

Perhaps, too, it may not be altogether fanciful to suppose that we may see =
the shepherd-boy=20

sort of successes I have in my own line are quite astonishing. Look what a =
hit I've made with Wild=20

overness. Well, I=20

said plainly to her, 'You will ruin that girl's chances if you attempt to f=

be asked anywhere=20

will leave her to me, I=20

I must here remark _en passant_ that Spiffy is apparently capable of doing =
the most unselfish=20

things, and of taking an infinity of trouble upon himself out of pure good-=
nature.  "What was your=20

_modus operandi_?" I asked.  "Oh, it was all plain sailing enough. The firs=
