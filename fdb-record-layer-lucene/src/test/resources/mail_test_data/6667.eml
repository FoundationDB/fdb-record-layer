only our attention but our admiration for persons who hitherto had seemed o=
bscure and=20

unfortunate. Dickens perhaps went too far, we now feel; he demonstrated the=
 weakness of the=20

gentry, and sent them to the background of the story, where we are willing =
enough they should=20

remain, but he also tried to endow the lower classes with so much delicacy,=

lost prince and princess of the fairy tale. But he taught us how to carry o=

since he stripped sentimentality, all that sort of nonsense, from the gentr=
y, we have known at last=20

how to strip it from the bourgeois. Some of our novelists riddle the polite=
 world for us, others tell us=20

the unflinching truth about our middle classes. We have no heroes; any char=
acter can get into our=20

literature, if we may use him as a target rather than worship him as a god.=
  It is too late to return,=20

even if we desired to do so, to the sentimental misreading of social condit=
ions against which our=20

modern realism, however grim, tries honestly to protest, and there is a for=
m of discourse in which=20

human frailties can properly be discussed; social science or the science of=

y aspect of human=20

character or conduct=E2=80=94just as medicine would fail in its office if w=
e forbade it to study any part or=20

function of the body. But it is not too late to ask ourselves the differenc=
e between science and art;=20

between a story which represents our physical actions with that conscience =
in detail which would=20

aid a medical diagnosis, and a story through which of the best counsellors =
and captains of the late=20

king. And her brother, to whom she was a divinity to be worshipped and fear=
ed, was already so=20

accustomed to submission to her will that it did not occur to him to resist=
 her authority now. In=20

default of a regent, there was a royal council, and in this council Anne ma=
naged to assure herself=20

of a powerful following. To be sure, at first there was nothing to fear, si=
nce Louis d' Orleans, young=20

and fond of pleasure, was engaged in satisfying his tastes after the long a=
nd irksome restraint to=20

which he had been subjected by Louis XI; and so, in place of politics, he t=
ook pleasure, availing=20

himself of every distraction that could help him to forget the terrible day=
s of the old king, or the ugly=20

face and crooked body of the king's daughter, who was his wife. Nevertheles=
s, Louis d'Orleans=20

was the natural leader of the opposition to the control of Anne de Beaujeu,=
 and the latter lost no=20

time in securing for herself, through her husband, a majority in the counci=
l, a body composed of=20

such diverse elements, and so uncertain of its own mind, that it was easy f=
or a determined leader=20

to carry her policies through its divided and hesitating ranks.  Anne was o=
nly twenty-two, but=20

already there was coming to be a special significance attached to her sobri=
quet, _Madame la=20

Grande_; for the imperious will, the boldness and shrewdness combined, the =
restless energy, the=20

constant watchfulness of the woman made itself felt throughout that governm=
ent in which she had=20

no legal standing. Her governing was done under constitutional forms, in th=
e name of the king, in=20

the name of the council; but people knew that she had dictated to the king =
what he should do, and=20

had imposed her will upon the council. Until the States-General had met, vo=
ted supplies, been=20

promised reforms, and=20


_
body walks, a joy forever; between a record of our neighbors just as they a=
re, or a bit meaner, and=20

a picture of men and women as we would gladly be. Anything printed may be c=
alled literature,=20

even last year=E2=80=99s time-tables, but if we preserve in the word an emp=
hasis upon art rather than upon=20

information, we may ask after all whether certain characters, then dissolve=

guarded, very conciliatory in her policy; the unjust acts of Louis XI were =
set right--where it did not=20

cost too much to do so--and certain obnoxious persons, such as Olivier le D=
aim, were sacrificed to=20

popular hatred. As soon as the States-General had been disposed of, however=
, the two parties in=20

the council began to assume=20


_
putting it another way, we may ask whether the type of character we portray=
 will not determine the=20

kind of art we produce, with or without our will, and whether the kind of c=
haracter we portray will=20

not finally classify our writing for us as art or as social document.  To h=

should reduce him to the second place in the national council, and make her=

the fact remains that some books we are to read many times, and permanently=
, whereas others=20

are for a season only, and may be read but once; and books which must serve=
 us in ways so=20
