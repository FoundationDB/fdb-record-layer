But Jean Adet--who was a powerful man despite his years--had seized Pierre by the arm and 

dragged him to a distant corner of the barn:  "Pierre!" he said in tones of command, "I forbid thee 

in the name of thy duty and the obedience which thou dost owe to me and to thy mother, to move 

another step in this hot-headed adventure. I was on the high-road, walking homewards, when that 

conflagration and the senseless cries of these poor lads warned me that some awful mischief was 

afoot. Pierre! my son! I command thee to lay that weapon down."  But Pierre--who in his normal 

state was a dutiful son and sincerely fond of his father--shook himself free from Jean Adet's grasp. 

"Father!" he said loudly and firmly, "this is no time for interference. We are all of us men here and 

know our own minds. What we mean to do to-night we have thought on and planned for weeks 

and months. I pray you, father, let me be! I am not a child and I have work to do."  "Not a child?" 

exclaimed the old man as he turned appealingly to the lads who had stood by, silent and sullen 

during this little scene. "Not a child? But you are all only children, my lads. You don't know what 

you are doing. You don't know what terrible consequences this mad escapade will bring upon us 

all, upon the whole his eyes, and he stood up glaring at the corpse as if he had been frozen to 

death in that position.  After standing a long time, he sat down and tried to think of his act and the 

probable consequences.  Self-defence was the first idea that was suggested clearly to him; and he 

clung to it as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw.  "Was it not clear," he thought, "that Perrin 

intended to murder me?  If not, why so quick to grip his gun?  If I had waited it would have been 

me, not Perrin, that would be lying there now!"  His memory reminded him faithfully, however, that 

when he first thought of taking up his gun, Conscience had sternly said,--"Don't."  Why should 

Conscience have spoken thus, or at all, if his motive had been innocent?  There are two ways in 

which a wicked man gets rid of conscientious troubles--at least for a time.  One way is by stout-

hearted defiance of God, and ignoring of Conscience altogether.  The other is by sophistical 

reasoning, and a more or less successful effort to throw dust in his own eyes.  Duncan McKay 

took the latter method.  It is an easy enough method-- especially with the illogical--but it works 

indifferently, and it does not last long.  Conscience may be seared; may be ignored; may be 

trampled on, but it cannot be

country-side. Do you suppose for one moment that the chateau of Kernogan will fall at the mercy 

of a few ignorant unarmed lads like yourselves? Why! four hundred of you would not succeed in 

forcing your way even as far as the courtyard of the palace. M. le duc has had wind for some time 

of your turbulent meetings at the auberge: he has kept an armed guard inside his castle yard for 

weeks past, a company of artillery with two guns most unseasonable and unexpected times to 

start up, vigorous and faithful to the very end, with its emphatic "Don't!" and "No!"  Dragging the 

body out of the camp, McKay returned to take his supper and reason the matter out with himself. 

"I could not help myself," he thought; "when I took up my gun I did not intend to kill the man." 

Conscience again reminded him of its "Don't!"  "And would not every man in Rud Ruver justify me 

for

ruin! Go home, I beg of you! Forget this night's escapade! Nothing but misery to you and yours 

can result from it."  They listened quietly, if surlily, to Jean Adet's impassioned words. Far be it 

from their thoughts to flout or to mock him. Paternal authority commanded respect even among 

the most rough; but they all felt that they self-defence?"  Conscience again said "No!"  Here the 

hunter uttered a savage oath, to which Conscience made no reply, for Conscience never speaks 

back or engages in disputation.  We need not attempt further to analyse the workings of sophistry 

in the brain of a murderer.  Suffice it to say that when the man had finished his supper

been too sweet to be forgone quite so readily, and Pierre with his vigorous personality, his glowing 

eloquence, his compelling power had more influence over them than the sober counsels of 

prudence and the wise admonitions of old Jean Adet. Not one word was spoken, but with an 

instinctive gesture every man grasped his weapon more firmly and then turned to Pierre, thus 

electing him their spokesman.  Pierre too had listened in silence to all that his father said, striving 

to hide the burning anxiety which was gnawing at his heart, lest his comrades himself in his own 

eyes.  There was, he felt, a disagreeable undercurrent of uneasiness; but this might have been the 

result of fear as to how the Canadian half-breeds and friends of the slain man would regard the 

matter in the event of its being found out.  There was reason for anxiety on this head, for poor 

Perrin was a great favourite among his comrades, while Cloudbrow was very much the reverse. 

Having finished the supper which he had purchased at such a terrible price, the young man 

gathered his things together, packed the provisions on his
