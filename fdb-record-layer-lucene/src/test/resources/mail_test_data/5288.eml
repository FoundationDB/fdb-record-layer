effected by a lady's hand. Not only were our walks covered with snow-white =
sand and the borders=20

ornamented with beautiful agates that we had collected in the neighbourhood=
, but the interior of=20

our house was the perfection of neatness: the floor was covered with white =
sand beaten firmly=20

together to the depth of about six inches; the surface was swept and replac=

=E2=80=9CDo you admire her?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have heard first-rate crit=

that there would be more chance of a happy marriage when both were of the s=

wish we were all of the same religion. Do not you?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell,=

might be.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D sighed Lothair, =E2=80=9Cwhat bet=

appears to me one never has a tranquil moment. I wonder what religious scho=

the gentlemen returned to=20


_
loops were little ornamental baskets worked by the Arabs, that contained a =
host of useful articles,=20

such as needles, thread, &c. &c., and the remaining surface was hung with h=
unting knives, fishing=20

lines, and a variety of instruments belonging to the chase. A travelling ta=
ble, with maps and a few=20

books, stood against the wall, and one more article completed our furniture=
,--an exceedingly neat=20

toilet table, the base of which was a flat-topped portmanteau, concealed by=
 a cunning device of=20

chintz and muslin; this, covered with the usual arrangement of brushes, mir=
ror, scent-bottles, &c.=20

threw an air of civilization over the establishment, which was increased by=
 the presence of an=20

immense sponging-bath, that, being flat and circular, could be fitted under=
neath a bed. In the=20

draught of air next the door stood our filter in a wooden frame, beneath wh=
ich was a porous jar=20

that received and cooled the clear water as it fell.  Our camp was a perfec=
t model; we had a view=20

of about five miles in extent along the valley of the Atbara, and it was my=
 daily amusement to scan=20

with my telescope the uninhabited country upon the opposite side of out Mis=
s Arundel, and=20

attached himself to her.  =E2=80=9CI have been to see your portrait today,=
=E2=80=9D he said. She changed color.  =E2=80=9CI=20

could not easily fix on any production of=20

the old masters that excels it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was painted at Rome,=
=E2=80=9D she said, in a low voice.  =E2=80=9CSo I=20

understood. I regret that, when I was at Rome, I saw so little of its art. =
But my health, you know,=20

was wretched. Indeed, if it had not been for some friends=E2=80=94I might s=
ay for one friend=E2=80=94I should not=20

have been here or in this world. I can never express to that person my grat=
itude, and it increases=20

every day. All that I have dreamed of angels was then realized.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CYou think too kindly of us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDid=20

a crucifix, and which I hope you will accept from me, in remembrance of the=
 past and your=20

Christian kindness to me? I should have left it at St. James=E2=80=99s Squa=

some little arrangement after its travels.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI shall prize=
