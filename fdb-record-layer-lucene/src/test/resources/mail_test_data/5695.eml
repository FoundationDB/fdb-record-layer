Jackson never wearied of saying that he was "no politician." He was, none t=
he less, one of the=20

most forceful and successful politicians that the country has known. He was=
 fortunate in being able=20

to personify a cause which was grounded deeply in the feelings and opinions=
 of the people, and=20

also in being able to command the services of a large group of tireless and=
 skillful national and=20

local managers. He was willing to leave to these managers the infinite deta=
ils of his campaign. But=20

he kept in close touch with them and their subordinates, and upon occasion =
he did not hesitate to=20

take personal command. In politics, as in war, he was imperious; persons no=
t willing to support=20

him with all their might, and without question or quibble, he preferred to =
see on the other side.=20

Throughout the campaign his opponents hoped, and his friends feared, that h=
e would commit=20

some deed of anger that would ruin his chances of election. The temptation =
was strong, especially=20

when the circumstances of his marriage were dragged into the controversy. B=
ut while he chafed=20

inwardly, and sometimes expressed himself with more force than elegance in =
the presence of his=20

friends, he maintained an outward calm and dignity. His bitterest feeling w=
as reserved for Clay,=20

who was known to be the chief inspirer of the National Republicans' mud-sli=
nging campaign. But=20

he felt that Adams had it in his power to put a stop to the slanders that w=
ere set in circulation, had=20

he cared to do so.  As the campaign drew to a close, circumstances pointed =
with increasing=20

sureness to the triumph of the Jackson forces. Adams, foreseeing the end, f=
ound solace in harsh=20

and sometimes picturesque entries in his diary. A group of opposition Congr=
essmen he=20

pronounced "skunks of party slander." Calhoun he described as "stimulated t=
o frenzy by success,=20

flattery, and premature advancement; governed by no steady principle, but s=
agacious to seize=20

upon every prevailing popular breeze to swell his own sails." Clay, likewis=
e, became petulant and=20

gloomy. In the last two months of the canvass Jackson ordered a general ons=
laught upon=20

Kentucky, and when finally it was affirmed that the State had been "carried=
 out from under" its=20

accustomed master, Clay knew only too well that the boast was true. To Adam=
s's assurances that=20

after four years of Jackson the country would gladly turn to the Kentuckian=
, the latter could only=20

reply that there would, indeed, be a reaction, but that before another Pres=
ident would be taken=20

from the West he would be too old; and it was with difficulty that Adams pe=
rsuaded him not to=20

retire immediately from the Cabinet.  The results of the contest met Trista=
n. But Iseut scorned him=20

now as she had scorned him then: her whole heart was given to Tristan, for =
Tristan was a knight of=20

greater prowess than he. Iseut loved Tristan, and not her husband; the husb=
and at length grew=20

suspicious, and the lover was forced to flee for his life.  Many adventures=
 befell him, but his heart=20

was still with la Belle Iseut. Wounded once more by a poisoned arrow, he co=
uld no longer return to=20

Iseut to be cured, and bethought him of his cousin, Iseut de la Blanche Mai=
n, a lady skilled in=20

surgery, who lived in Brittany. To Iseut of the White Hand, then, went Tris=
tan, and a new and most=20

curious episode in the love story began. For the new Iseut cured Tristan, b=
ut fell in love with him,=20

and loved him passionately. He could not return her love, for he had not fo=
rgotten la Belle Iseut,=20

but out of gratitude he married her; and Iseut of the White Hand, not knowi=
ng that she had not all=20

her husband's love, was happy in what she had.  Tristan made a confidant of=
 his wife's brother,=20

Peredor, telling him such marvels of the beauty of la Belle Iseut that Pere=
dor was half in love by=20

hearsay, and quite in love when he and Tristan journeyed into Cornwall and =
saw the lady. She=20

seemed for a moment flattered by the new love, and played the coquette till=
 Tristan, driven to=20

madness, wandered off into the forest; and the heart of Iseut was sad and s=
ick of longing and=20



regret. Here he dwelt, till one day he was captured by King Mark, who faile=
d to recognize his=20

nephew in the naked madman, and confined him within the high walled garden.=
 But la Belle Iseut=20

came forth to see the man, and Tristan, knowing her even in his madness, tu=
rned away his head=20

and wept. Then a little dog that Iseut had always with her, smelt Tristan, =
and knew him, and leapt=20

upon him; for this dog had Iseut kept by her every day since Tristan gave h=
er to Iseut in the first=20

days of their love. And thereupon Iseut fell down in a swoon, and so lay a =
great while; and when=20

she might speak, she said: "My lord Sir Tristan, blessed be God ye have you=
r life! And now I am=20

sure you shall be discovered by this little dog, for she will never leave y=
ou; and also I am sure that=20

as soon as my lord King Mark shall know you he will banish you out of the c=
ountry of Cornwall or=20

else he will destroy you. For God's sake, mine own lord, grant King Mark hi=
s will, and then draw=20

you unto the court of King Arthur, for there are ye beloved."  King Mark ba=
nished Tristan forever,=20

and to the court of King Arthur went Tristan, winning there ever fresh fame=
, until finally King Mark=20

himself, moved by jealousy and envy, came to destroy Tristan. But the=20


_
Months before the election, congratulatory messages began to pour into the =
Hermitage. Some=20

came from old friends and disinterested well-wishers, many from prospective=
 seekers of office or=20

of other favors. Influential people in the East, and especially at the capi=
tal, hastened to express=20

their desire to be of service to the Jacksons in the new life to which they=
 were about to be called.=20

In the list one notes with interest the names of General Thomas Cadwalader =
of Philadelphia,=20

salaried lobbyist for the United States Bank, and Senator Robert Y. Hayne, =
the future South=20

Carolina nullifier.  Returns sufficiently complete to leave no doubt of Jac=
kson's election reached=20

the Hermitage on the 9th of December. That afternoon, Lewis, Carroll, and a=
 few reconciled uncle=20

and nephew, and Tristan went to free Cornwall from a horde of invading Saxo=
ns. The intrigue with=20

Iseut was renewed, and Mark confined Tristan in a dungeon, whence he was re=
leased only by an=20

insurrection of Mark's oppressed subjects. Iseut eloped with him, and the t=
wo wandered in the=20

forest like true lovers, this fair lady and her bold knight, and were final=
ly received at Joyeuse=20

Garde by the gallant Lancelot, where they dwelt till a fresh reconciliation=
 with King Mark brought=20

about the restoration of Iseut to her husband.  We must not forget the othe=
r Iseut, the white-

handed lady whom Tristan married and left behind in Brittany. The fact of h=
er existence came=20

again to his recollection now, and he returned to her. She was in=20


_
When, two weeks later, the final returns were received, leading Tenneseeans=
 decided to give a=20

reception, banquet, and ball which would outshine any social occasion in th=
e annals of the=20

Southwest. Just as arrangements were completed, however, Mrs. Jackson, who =
had long been in=20

failing health, suffered an attack of heart trouble; and at the very hour w=
hen the General was to=20

have been received, amid all the trappings of civil and military splendor, =
with the huzzas of his=20

neighbors, friends, and admirers, he was sitting tearless, speechless, and =
almost expressionless=20

by the corpse of his life companion. Long after the beloved one had been la=
id to rest in the=20

Hermitage garden amid the rosebushes she had planted, the President-elect c=
ontinued as one=20

benumbed. He never gave up the idea that his wife had been killed by worry =
over the attacks=20

made upon him and upon her by the Adams newspapers--that, as he expressed i=
t, she was=20

"murdered by slanders that pierced her heart." Only under continued proddin=
g from Lewis and=20

other friends did he recall himself to his great task and set distress and =
longing for her husband;=20

but from her caressing arms he fled again to put down a rebellion in his do=
minions. Once more=20

sorely wounded, once more he was cured by the white hands of his wife, whom=
 he nevertheless=20

soon afterward abandoned to renew the intrigue with the rival Iseut in Corn=
wall. But he was again=20

discovered and put to flight by the jealous husband. The spirit of restless=
ness would not let him be=20

quiet with his wife, the knight must be up and doing; and while he engaged =
in a reckless adventure=20

he was grievously wounded, so grievously that death seemed nigh and not to =
be put off by the=20

ministrations of Iseut of the White Hand. Tristan sent a messenger in haste=
 for la Belle Iseut:=20

"Come with all speed, if you love me! And that I may know you are on the sh=
ip let the sails be=20

white; if you cannot come, let the sails be black." Iseut hastened toward h=
er lover, with feverish=20

impatience, blaming winds and waves and slow messengers. Meanwhile, the neg=
lected wife, Iseut=20

of the White Hand, discovered the truth and grew wildly jealous. Tristan la=
y on his bed in=20
