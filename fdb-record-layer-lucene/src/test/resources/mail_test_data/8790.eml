 imperious note crept into his philodendron monstera the magazine you most =
admire, and ask him to accept poems which do not scan, and stories which ar=
e the feeble productions of an ambitious child? And will you, my last frien=

 importance of the request I have to make." The Elder threw aside what litt=
le mask he had been wearing. An imperious note crept into his _
horses in, and they went over you, and we thought you were killed. You were=

badly hurt--it was nothing short of a miracle, for you ought to have been a=

Arthur was with me, and when you opened your eyes you stretched out your ar=

took you to his heart on the spot, and you were his son from that day forwa=

think, prosperity has done you any at such times. The Elder merely waved hi=

chair.  "That one promise will bind us both," he said coldly. "In fact, it =
is to your interest as well as=20

to mine to make it. You will not see it at first, but time will prove that =
I am right in asking it."  "I'll=20

promise anything that's reasonable if you'll only swing me the job of skipp=

Elder began to shuffle some papers with deft fingers.  "But that there mort=

"I had no choice," said Noel. "Prosperity came to me as God's gift. It so h=
appens that I am now a=20

rich man and I suppose even rich people can find their mission. The girls a=

cases are in no way parallel. Oh! how gladly I would help them, but believe=
 me, I would help them=20

to keep their independence."  Mrs. Ellsworthy frowned.  "If you are going t=

done," she said.  "Can you not help them without adopting them?" asked Arth=
ur.  "Oh! my dear=20

boy, what am I to do? I know lots of influential people, but I can't go to =
them and say, 'I know three=20

 beneath a piece of=20

paper which the Captain recognized as the one displayed by the lawyer yeste=

did not take his eyes from the face of the man across the table. A suspicio=

into his mind, and it was as unpleasant as it was unwelcome.  "How do I kno=

end of the promise, Jim?"  "You have my word."  "I had that afore, at the t=

would do my best for you, and I did."  "Maybe you done your best, but----" =
 "We'll not quarrel about=20
