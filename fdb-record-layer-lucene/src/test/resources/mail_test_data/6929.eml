philodendron monstera life so delightful as being 'continual reader' of politics to poor Mrs. Mortlock. She ought to have been suited long ago, but I've a strong hope that she isn't, for  "Mr. McGowan, please stop! You frighten me," cried the girl, drawing away again as he limped a step in her direction.  "Hate!"

"money matters and all. I had sore worries myself in the money line until poor Dredge made his 

fortune in the chandlery business. My dear, I was almost forgetting to tell you that we've had an 

affliction at the Mansion."  "I'm very sorry," began Primrose.  "Yes, dear, and it's an affliction which 

is likely to continue, and to grow heavier. It's poor Mrs. Mortlock, dear--I'm afraid she's losing her 

sight, and very troublesome she'll be, and a worry to us all when it's gone, for poor woman, she 

has a passion for politics that's almost past bearing. Miss Slowcum and me, we take turns to read 

her the papers now, but though our throats ache, and we're as hoarse as ravens, we don't content 

her. Mrs. Mortlock is looking out for what she is pleased to call a 'continual reader,' dear, and what 

I'm thinking is that perhaps you or your sister would like to try for the post--I believe you'd suit her 

fine, and she can pay well, for she's fairly made of money."  Primrose colored. To read to Mrs. 

Mortlock was about the last occupation she would given you any reason to think of me like that?" 

"No. But I thought----"  She drew into the shadows that he might not see the rapid rise and fall of 

her bosom. "Forgive me, if I have!"  "I'm the one to be forgiven. I've never had much instruction 

concerning social custom. I was reared where they were little known. In school I was too busy to 

bother about them. I'm crude. But, Elizabeth, I love you. I see now that I've no right to tell you, but I 

couldn't help it. I've been driven to desperation. I have been like a caged animal for weeks past. 

I've been wild for just a little love and understanding in the midst of all I've gone through. But you 

don't love me!" His breath was coming hard. He trembled as he rose. "You will love me some day! 

God will not let a man love as I do and give nothing in return!"  Stirred with pity, Elizabeth came to 

him from out the darkness.  "Forgive me," he said as she came nearer. "I had no idea it would be 

like this."  She did not take the hand he extended, but folding her arms behind her, she stood quite

which was getting so sadly light, and the feeling that after all her efforts she might never do much 

in the china-painting line, caused her to reflect anxiously.  "May I think about it and let you know, 

Mrs. Dredge?"  "No, no, my dear, not by any means, for she has advertised, and they are pouring 

in. Poor Sarah Susan is almost off her head answering the door to them. Stout readers and thin 

readers, old readers and young readers, you at all."  "You need not try. I don't understand myself. I 

have never been through anything like this in all my life. I thought instinct would lead you right to 

me. I never questioned but that you would understand. But don't try, for I can't explain. This 

afternoon I had just one thought: to tell you how I love you. I thought it would make me happy. 

Happy!" He laughed bitterly. "I didn't stop to reason. It seems I have no
