always been taken at Ridgley as an indication of the probable result of the=
 game with Jefferson,--

the final athletic event of the year and the crisis of the football season.=
 If Ridgley pushed back the=20

sturdy Wilton team and snatched victory from the wearers of the purple, the=
n there were=20

reasonable grounds for hoping that three weeks later there would be a bonfi=
re on the campus and=20

a midnight parade to celebrate a victory over Jefferson, the ancient and ho=
nored foe of Ridgley. If,=20

on the other hand, Wilton showed an impertinent disregard for the best line=
 that Ridgley could=20

assemble and carried their impertinence to such an extreme as to romp home =
with the victory, the=20

situation looked black as ink, and the tense atmosphere that accompanies fo=
rlorn hopes took=20

possession of Ridgley School and penetrated not merely to the recitation ha=
lls, but even, it was=20

said, to the office of Doctor Wells, the head. In such times there were mig=
hty efforts to bolster up=20

the spirit of the team, to feed it concentrated football knowledge and to w=
ard off by Herculean=20

effort the black shadow of defeat that raised its ugly head like a thunder =
cloud pushing itself higher=20

and higher over the white buildings on the hill.  Before the Wilton game Co=
ach Murray had a few=20

words to say to the team that made every member tingle with a desire to sho=
w what he could do.=20

When the whistle blew and the game began, Teeny-bits was sitting on the sid=
e lines with the other=20

substitutes.  Ridgley kicked off to Wilton, and immediately received a terr=
ific surprise. The pigskin=20

went sailing through the air impelled by the heavy boot of big Tom Curwood;=
 it fell into the purple-

covered arms of a rangy Wilton half-back who, instead of running with the b=
all, immediately sent=20

away a long spiral punt that flew over the heads of the charging Ridgley pl=
ayers. Neil Durant yelled=20

out a quick warning and turned with his team-mates.  Ned Stillson was neare=
st the ball when it=20

struck the ground; he intended to gather it up as it bounced, and then he m=
eant to carry it far back=20

toward the Wilton goal, but his calculations went wrong. His outstretched f=
ingers touched the ball=20

and almost grasped it, but the pigskin oval slipped from him and next insta=
nt--to the horror of the=20

Ridgley watchers--was seized by a swift-footed son of Wilton who had come t=
earing downfield as if=20

some weird instinct had informed him that Ned was to make the fatal error. =
Before any Ridgley=20

player could overtake him he was lying between the goal posts with a satisf=
ied grin on his=20

features. The game was scarcely thirty seconds old and the score was 6-0 in=
 favor of the invaders!=20

A moment later the Wilton captain kicked an easy goal and the tally was sev=
en.  Nor was that all of=20

the misery in store for Ridgley; before the timekeeper had signaled the end=
 of the first quarter,=20

another disaster had occurred; and this time the element of luck, which mig=
ht have been said to=20

enter somewhat at least into the scoring of the first touchdown, played fav=
orites no more with=20

Wilton than with Ridgley. The home team was outgeneraled. By a series of st=
rong rushes the=20

visitors carried the ball sixty-five yards for a well-earned touchdown. The=
 baffling thing about their=20

play was a sudden shift; the quarter-back began to shout his numbers, then =
he yelled "Shift" and=20

with a quick jump several members of the Wilton team took new positions; al=
most instantly the=20

pigskin was snapped and before the Ridgley players had the Wilton runner C,=
 E, and G; and the=20

IIId on A; and these anomalies were similar in degree. The greatest differe=
nce between any two=20

corresponding temperaments, was between those of the 3d on E; the first com=
putation making it=20

only 702, while the last has it 818.   PROPOSITION XI.    The aggregate of =
dissonance, heard in a=20

given time, in the system   of temperament unfolded in the last Proposition=
, will be less   than in=20

either of the systems generally practised.  In order to compare the foregoi=
ng system with those=20

which have been most generally approved, the temperaments of all the concor=
ds have been=20



calculated, in the system of equal semitones; in that of Earl Stanhope, whi=
ch has had considerable=20

celebrity; in that of Dr. T. Young; in that of Mr. Hawkes; in that of Kirnb=
erger, which has been=20

extensively adopted in Germany; and in that which is described by Rousseau =
and D'Alembert as=20

generally practised in France. If these temperaments be multiplied into the=
 corresponding numbers=20

of Table IX., agreeably to what was shown under Prop. VIII., and those prod=
ucts which belong to=20

the several concords of the same name be added, the sums, after the three r=
ight-hand figures are=20

cut off, will be as follows:   TABLE XIII.    +-------------+------+-------=

---+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+  From an inspection =
of the sums at the foot of the=20

table, it will be seen that the amount of dissonance heard in a given time =
is decidedly less in the=20

new scale than in either of the others; and that it is scarcely more than h=
alf as great as in the scale=20

of equal semitones. On the other hand, the temperament is very unequally di=
stributed, which must=20

be admitted, c=C3=A6teris paribus, to be a disadvantage. It is even somewha=
t greater than in the=20

scheme of Mr. Hawkes, although by no means in the same ratio, as the aggreg=
ate dissonance is=20

less. It contains one Vth, which will be somewhat harsh, and four IIIds and=
 three 3ds, which will be=20

quite harsh. But these, as will appear from an inspection of Table IX., are=
, of all others, of by far=20

the most unfrequent occurrence; so that the unpleasant effect of a transiti=
on from a better to a=20

much worse harmony will be very seldom felt. In the six simplest keys of th=
e major, and in the=20

three of most frequent occurrence in the minor mode, they are _never_ heard=
, except in=20

occasional modulations; and even then, generally no one, and rarely more th=
an one is heard. Now=20

these nine keys, as will appear from Table III., comprise more than five ti=
mes as much of the=20

music examined as all the rest. The same remarks might be extended to three=
 other minor keys,=20

were it not that the sharp seventh is so generally used, that it deserves t=
o be considered as an=20

essential note of the key.  But there=20


_
ball was five or ten yards nearer their goal line. That had happened again =
and again during=20

Wilton's successful march to Ridgley's goal line. Wilton scored near the co=
rner of the field and=20

failed to kick the goal. The tally was 13-0.  The brief rest between the fi=
rst and the second quarters=20

was put to good use by Neil Durant; he got his players together and so rall=
ied their spirits that in=20

the second quarter they not only held their own, but gradually pushed their=
 opponents back and=20

back until they were threatening the line. But they did not quite succeed i=
n scoring; with thirty=20

seconds more to play, Ridgley had the ball on Wilton's five-yard line. It w=
as first down. A rush=20

through tackle failed and while the Ridgley team was lining up for another =
try, the timekeeper's=20

whistle blew. The chance had been lost.  The third quarter started more aus=
piciously; two forward=20

passes netted Ridgley forty yards of gain. The ball was far within the enem=
y territory again, but=20

Wilton held, and on the fourth down Ned Stillson fell back and made a succe=
ssful drop kick.=20

During the rest of this quarter there was a good deal of seesawing back and=
 forth and neither side=20

seemed to have the advantage, until Tom Curwood recovered a fumble on the v=
isitors' twenty-five-

yard line. Again the Wilton line held and again the Ridgley team scored by =
a drop kick. This time it=20

was Neil Durant's toe that sent the oval between the uprights and over the =
cross-bar. The third=20

quarter ended with the score 13-6, and Wilton's cheering section indulged i=
n vociferous=20

expressions of glee.  At the beginning of the final quarter Coach Murray se=
nt in Teeny-bits to take=20

the place of White, the left counterbalancing the objection to this system,=
 derived from the greater=20

inequality in the distribution of its temperaments, which have not been hit=
herto noticed, as not=20

being susceptible of mathematical computation.  1st. We have gone on the su=
pposition that tunes=20

on the more difficult keys are as often performed, according to their numbe=
r, as those on the=20

simpler keys; and have taken for the measure of dissonance, in different sy=
stems, what would be=20

actually heard, if the 1600 scores, whose signatures were examined, were al=
l played in=20

succession, and on the keys to which they are set. But the fact is, that th=
ose pieces which are set=20

to the simpler keys are oftener played, and with fuller harmony, on account=
 of the greater ease of=20

execution, than those in which many of the short finger keys must be used. =
 2d. Pieces on the=20

more difficult keys are often played on the adjacent easier keys, but the c=
ontrary is seldom or=20

never done.  Giving to these two considerations no more than a reasonable w=
eight, they will=20

counterbalance the objection, and will render it evident that the sums unde=
r the several systems in=20

the table may be taken as a true exhibition of their respective merits, wit=
hout any injustice to the=20

more equal systems at the left-hand of the table.  _Cor._ We may hence draw=
 a comparison=20

between the systems in common use. Their merits, when every consideration i=
s taken into view,=20

are nearly in the inverse ratio of the sums denoting their aggregate disson=
ance. That of Mr.=20

Hawkes is the best, and, in many respects, has a remarkable analogy to the =
one derived from the=20

preceding investigations.  _Cor._ 2. As the aggregate dissonance of the cha=
ngeable scale=20


_
players glanced at the substitute and exchanged looks of satisfaction; the =
newcomer seemed too=20

small to be dangerous. It was the first big game that Teeny-bits had ever b=
een in; he was=20

quivering with eagerness to run with the ball. But the opportunity did not =
seem to come; most of=20

the time Ridgley was on the defensive, fighting desperately to hold back th=
e Wilton plungers.=20

[Illustration: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FINAL QUARTER COACH MURRAY SENT IN=
=20

TEENY-BITS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF WHITE.]  When Ridgley finally did get its c=
hance the time=20

was slipping swiftly away, and hope was glimmering but faintly in the home =
stands. There was to=20

be one more sensation, however. The ball was Ridgley's on its own calculate=
d on the same=20

principles, in Prop. VIII., as that of the Douzeave in this, a comparison o=
f the results in Table VIII.=20

with those in Table XIII., will furnish us with the relative dissonance of =
different systems for these=20

different scales. The relative dissonance of the two systems which form the=
 object of this essay, is=20

nearly as 17 : 27. Hence it appears, that by inserting eight new sounds bet=
ween those of the=20

common octave, the harshness of the music executed, at a medium of all the =
keys, may be=20

diminished by more than one third of the whole, while the transition from a=
 better to a worse=20

harmony will never be perceived.     ART. XXII. _Notice of Colonel Trumbull=
's Picture of the=20


_
Curwood plunged through for five more. Then Dean called on Teeny-bits.  "Tw=
enty-seven, sixteen,=20

eleven," he called out, and the ball came back swiftly into his hands. Teen=
y-bits took it from Dean=20

on the run and began to circle the right end of the of Independence._   It =
is proper that some=20

mention of this great national work should be made, in publications less tr=
ansient than=20

newspapers; and as the fine arts are included within the design of this Jou=
rnal, it may with=20

propriety be noticed here.=20
