I was interviewed some time last September by a Mr. Jones, claiming   to re=
present the Omaha=20

branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas   City, Missouri. I was urged =
by him to join the=20

system. I refused and   was then asked to sign a card agreeing that my bank=
 would remit all=20

items at par sent us by mail by the Federal Reserve Bank. I refused   to si=
gn and was told that I=20

would be compelled to at an early date,   as there was no limit to the powe=
r of the Federal Reserve=20

Bank.    "Early in October of the same year, the local express agent presen=
ted   quite a number of=20

checks on our bank from the Federal Reserve Bank   and we gave him a draft =
for the full amount=20

payable to the Federal   Reserve Bank. A short time after, another bunch of=
 checks of the name of=20

The work of conversion was now again renewed, and, after such overwhelming =
proofs of Christian=20

superiority, with somewhat greater success. A second edition of the Indian =
Old Testament, which=20

silver dollars for the checks and he   said he did not have time to count i=

draft for   the face of the checks.    "Following this, W.S. Lower, claimin=
g to represent the Omaha=20

branch,   came with some checks and demanded legal tender in payment. We   =
offered him a draft=20
