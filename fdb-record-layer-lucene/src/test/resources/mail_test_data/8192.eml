ese things,"=20

sententiously remarked his wife, as she gave a vicious shake to the mission=
ary box, which was=20

always on the sideboard. Missionary boxes are not seen so often now as they=
 used to be, but this=20

old-fashioned engine of torture was clung to by the vicaress. Rosy-cheeked =
children had received=20

many a bright sixpence from the vicar, their faces wreathed in smiles; the =
smiles had faded when=20

Cecilia Dodd had proved to them, by chapter and verse, that the proper plac=
e for the bright silver=20

was the drab sarcophagus on the sideboard. Even the vicar's friends, at the=
 termination of their=20

rubber for threepenny points, dreaded the appearance of the box; they invar=
iably contributed, the=20

more daring among them sighing as they did so.  Anastatia Dodd, on the whic=
h we must not=20

encounter to prevent incalculable mischief. The publication of the Scotch h=
ierarchy at this moment=20

will destroy the labors of years. And yet they will not see it! I cannot co=
nceive who is urging them,=20

for I am sure they must have some authority from home.=E2=80=94You have som=
ething for me, Chidioch,=E2=80=9D=20

he added inquiringly, for his keen eye caught the card.  =E2=80=9CI regret =
to trouble your eminence when=20

you need repose, but the bearer of this card seems to have been importunate=
, and to have=20

appealed to, your name and personal orders;=E2=80=9D and he gave the cardin=
al the card.  =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said the=20

cardinal, looking at the card with much interest; =E2=80=9Cthis is a person=
 I must always see.=E2=80=9D  And so, in=20

due course, they ushered into the library a gentleman with a crimson and we=
ll-stuffed bag, of a=20

composed yet cheerful aspect, who addressed the=20


_
at breakfast. The fragile little lady was suffering from a cold in her head=
. She was in bed, perusing=20

in undisturbed comfort a harmless novel. But the novel disappeared under th=
e clothes with=20

amazing celerity as the voice of her sister-in-law demanded admission. The =
mistress of the house=20

affectionately inquired if she felt equal to a short conversation. In some =
trepidation Anastatia=20

signified her acquiescence. Her sister-in-law pointed out to her that old M=
r. Warrender had been=20

very attentive lately. Anastatia innocently answered that "He was a dear ol=
d man."  "Oh, my dear, I=20

am so glad, so very glad, to hear you say so," said Mrs. Dodd.  "But why gl=
ad, Cecilia?"  "My love,=20

your brother and I thought it _was_ so, and that you encouraged him. Has he=
 spoken to you yet?=20

He has said nothing to John."  "Spoken, Cecilia, to me; saying, =E2=80=9CI =
am ashamed to trouble your=20

eminence with only matters of form=E2=80=94absolutely mere matters of form;=
 but I obey, Sir, your own=20

instructions.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is not for me to depreciate form,=E2=80=
=9D replied the cardinal; =E2=80=9Cand in business there are=20

no mere matters of form.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMerely the wood accounts,=E2=80=
=9D continued the visitor; =E2=80=9Cthey must be=20

approved by both the guardians or the money cannot be received by the banke=
rs. Your eminence,=20

you see, has sanctioned the felling, and authorized the sales, and these ar=
e the final accounts,=20

which must be signed before we pay in.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGive them to me,=
=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, stretching out both=20

his hands as he received a mass of paper folios. His eminence resumed his c=
hair, and hastily=20

examined the sheets. =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cno ordinary fe=
lling=E2=80=94it reaches over seven counties. By-the-

by, Bracewood Forest=E2=80=94what=20


_
"This is affectation, dear; you can't pretend to be blind to what is appare=
nt to all of us."  "Oh,=20

Cecilia, how can you?" sobbed the vicar's sister, blushing to her ears and =
burying her face in her=20

pillows.  For forty years Anastatia Dodd had lived in maiden meditation fan=
cy free. True, she had=20

taken a lively interest in all her brother's curates, but it was always a p=
rofessional interest and=20

purely Platonic. But now she blushed, blushed as she had never blushed befo=
re.  What woman is=20

displeased at hearing that she has an admirer? Who among us would fail to b=
elieve what we have,=20

perhaps, secretly wished for in our heart of hearts?  That arch Machiavel, =
the vicar's wife, did not=20

leave her sister-in-law till she was thoroughly convinced that Diggory Warr=
ender was only waiting=20

a favourable opportunity to make her a formal offer of his hand and heart. =
 All this was sufficiently=20

exciting to poor Miss Dodd, but what was her horror, her the enclosure? I h=
ave heard no more of=20

it.=E2=80=9D Then, murmuring to himself=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CGrentham Wood=E2=
=80=94how well I remember Grentham Wood, with=20

his dear father!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf we could sign today,=E2=80=9D said t=
he visitor in a tone of professional cajolery; =E2=80=9Ctime is=20

important.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd it shall not be wasted,=E2=80=9D replied =
the cardinal. =E2=80=9CBut I must look over the accounts. I=20

doubt not all is quite regular, but I wish to make myself a little familiar=
 with the scene of action;=20

perhaps to recall the past,=E2=80=9D he added. =E2=80=9CYou shall have them=
 to-morrow, Mr. Giles.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYour=20

eminence will have very different accounts to settle in a short time,=E2=80=
=9D said Mr. Giles, smiling. =E2=80=9CWe=20

are hard at work; it takes three of our clerks constantly occupied.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CBut you have yet got time.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

don=E2=80=99t know that,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Giles. =E2=80=9CThe affairs are =
very large. And the mines=E2=80=94they give us the=20

greatest trouble. Our Mr. James Roundell was two months in Wales last year =
about them. It took=20

up the whole of his=20
