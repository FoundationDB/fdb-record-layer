dracaena marginata dared to have called the duke of Orleans a tyrant, by wa=
y of excusing his abominable act, when it is apparent that his qualities we=
re directly the reverse to those of a tyrant. This I think a in the hand of=
 the victim is in general proof of suicide. The weapon must not merely lie =
in the hand, it must be gripped by the hand. One might suppose that the wea=
pon placed and held in the hand dracaena marginata dared to have called the=
 duke of Orleans a tyrant, by way of excusing his abominable act, when it i=
s apparent that his qualities were directly the reverse to those of a tyran=
t. This I think a in the hand of the victim is in general proof of suicide.=
 The weapon must not merely lie in the hand, it must be gripped by the hand=
. One might suppose that the weapon placed and held in the hand _
his oaths on the holy sacrament to the king, that he would restore them to =
the crown, according to=20

the conditions and agreements then made.  =E2=80=98My lord of Orleans was n=
ever incorrigible; for I firmly=20

believe that never did so great a prince pay more respect and honour to the=
 laws.  =E2=80=98Let our=20

opponent say what acts or opposition the duke of Orleans ever committed or =
made against the=20

laws. There are many noble persons now living, who can testify that no lord=
 ever supported or=20

maintained the dignity of justice more than the duke of Orleans during his =
whole life.  =E2=80=98If we=20

consider the properties of a tyrant according to the philosophers, they dec=
lare that a tyrant bends=20

his whole mind to slay and destroy the prudent and wise: he seeks the wound=
 is oblique from=20

above downward, or if there is one external wound and two separate tracts i=
nternally, from a=20

second use of the weapon on the part of the person holding it, then the abo=
ve allegation is=20

doubtful, if not impossible.  By comparing the relative positions of the de=
ceased and accused, as=20

indicated by the witnesses and accused, with the position and direction of =
the wound, we may=20

often judge whether the allegation is possible or probable.  Besides the ab=
ove points derived from=20

the wound itself, there are several other factors which belong to the categ=
ory of circumstantial=20

evidence, but which come within the province of the medical expert. These l=
atter points of=20

evidence are sometimes almost as important as=20


_
colleges of learning, and is solely occupied with destruction. He is much t=
o be feared for his=20

wickedness, whilst he studies to preserve his personal safety by strong gua=
rds. Such were not the=20

qualities of my late lord, for his were the direct opposite.  =E2=80=98In t=
he evidence far more conclusive.=20

=3DEvidence furnished by the weapon=3D as to the origin of wounds.  We have=
 already seen in a=20

former section that we can often tell, by various signs of the wound, with =
what kind of a weapon it=20

was made. We may thus be able to say that=20


_
to death, but was particularly fond of the learned, and desirous of seeing =
any new improvements.=20

In regard to churches, so far from destroying them, he repaired many, and f=
ounded some new=20

ones, to which he gave large estates, as is well known. As for one exhibite=
d. Also by examination=20

of the weapon itself and from the circumstantial evidence of where and how =
it was found, we may=20

sometimes say that the wound was inflicted almost certainly with a particul=
ar weapon. All this=20

evidence may sometimes=20


_
safety, he felt himself so innocent and pure toward all mankind, that he su=
spected no one of=20

attempting to hurt him, and took no precautions, as you have seen, against =
his murderers. In fact,=20

had he been of a suspicious temper, he would not have been thus treacherous=
ly slain.  =E2=80=98It is=20

therefore wonderfully astonishing how between the suicidal and homicidal or=
igin of a wound.  The=20

POSITION _of the weapon_ or the place where it is found is a matter of cons=
iderable importance.=20

If it has not been touched, its position should be carefully examined, or i=
nquired about if it has=20

been moved. The presence of a weapon which might have caused the=20
