philodendron monstera communication trenches have been completely blown in. The smoke and thirst are enough to drive one mad. Our cooker doesn't come up. The 126th gives us bread and coffee from the little they have. If only it having just completed the labour which you had marked out.

lie on our belly, and get wet through and through. All the men grumbling and cursing. At eleven we 

are dismissed. I, with a bad cold and a headache. I wish this soldiering were all over.  July 19th. At 

seven sharp we marched off to our position. Heavy bombardment. At nine we were buried by a 

shell. I know no more. At eleven I found myself lying in the Field Hospital. I have pains inside me 

over my lungs; and headache, and burning in the joints.  July 20th. The M.O. has had a look at 

me. He says my stomach and left lung are suffering from the pressure which was put on them. 

The principal remedy is rest.  July 21st. Thirty-nine degrees of fever (temp. 100 deg. of the Feroe 

Islands. It is of a delicate gray, translucent, mamillary, botryoidal, stalactitical, or impressed by 

crystals of quartz, which have usually fallen out; sometimes these crystals incrust the chalcedony. 

Agates also are found in considerable numbers, both imbedded and loose. They usually consist of 

bands of chalcedony and quartz, and sometimes of the latter only, variously striped or spotted, or 

interlaced with jasper, carnelian, and cacholong.  The form of the imbedded agates at East-Haven 

is commonly ovoidal, or egg-shaped, and frequently it is conical. Some portions of pure 

chalcedony occur, which are shaped like a long, slender carrot or parsnip,

and sleep, and oh! how tired I am!  July 22d. I slept all day. Had milk and white bread to eat.  July 

26th. Returned to duty with three days' exemption, i.e., we do not have any outdoor work.  July 

28th and 29th. Still on exemption. Nothing to do but sleep and think of home and of my dear wife 

and daughter. But dreaming does not bring peace any sooner. How I would love an hour or two 

back home.  July 31st. In rest. Baths going. Duke of Wuerttemberg passed through our camp. 

August exactly represent that of the chalcedony or agate in the rock.  The imbedded masses are 

frequently altogether quartz, and then they are most commonly geodes or hollow balls lined with 

crystals, commonly very perfect and brilliant, although rarely large. These crystals are commonly 

transparent and colourless--but they exhibit also most of the varieties of colour which quartz 

assumes--the amethyst--the smoky--yellow, &c., and occasionally they are tipped and spotted with 

red jasper.

bombardment; bombardment of Hooge. Second Battalion, 132d Regiment, sent up to reinforce 

126th Regiment, which has already lost half its men.  August 4th. Heavy artillery fire the whole 

night. The English are concentrating 50,000 Indians on our front to attack Hooge and Hill 60. Just 

let them come, we shall stand firm. At three marched off to the front. Watch beginning again. Five 

o'clock marched off to the Witches' Cauldron, Hooge. A terrible night again. H.E. and shrapnel 

without number. Oh, thrice-cursed Hooge! In one hour eleven killed and twenty-three wounded 

and the fire unceasing. It is enough to drive one mad, and we have to spend three days and three 

nights more. It is worse than an earthquake, and any one who has not experienced it can have no 

idea what it is like. The English fired a mine, a hole fifteen metres deep and fifty to sixty broad, and 

this "cauldron" has to be occupied at night. At present it isn't too badly shelled. At every shot the 

dug-outs sway to and fro like a weather-cock. This  The spontaneous decay of these trap rocks 

causes many specimens to be found among their ruins, and many more are imbedded in the solid 

rock; but the industry of successive classes from the neighbouring college, issuing from Col. 

Gibbs's cabinet, has now made specimens more scarce.  _Woodbury._ Twenty-four miles from 

New-Haven, N.W.  In a geological sketch of parts of the counties of New-Haven and Litchfield, 

which may appear in a future Number, it will be seen that prehnite, stilbite, and agate are found at 

Woodbury, in the little basin of secondary greenstone which exists there; the prehnite is abundant-

-it is not known whether the agates are so, although it is asserted to be the fact; the stilbite was 

not observed to be abundant, although it was well characterized.     ART. VI. _Account of the 

Strata perforated by, and of the Minerals found in, the great adit to the Southampton Lead Mine.

of steel and iron. Now I must crawl into our hole, as trunks and branches of trees fly in our trench 

like spray.  August 6th. To-night moved to the crater again, half running and half crawling. At 

seven a sudden burst of fire from the whole of the artillery. From about eleven yesterday fires as if 

possessed. This morning at four we fall back. We find the section, for about one hundred miles, I 

visited Dr. D. Hunt, at Northampton. He observed that you had expressed an opinion, that an 

attentive examination of all the strata constituting the walls of the artificial avenue or drift at the 

Southampton mines, would bring facts to knowledge, which might, in some degree, subserve the 

cause of geological science.
