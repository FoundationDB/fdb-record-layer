dracaena marginata bark from the rocks along the coast.    OLD MUSKIE THE ROGUE  BY LEVI T. PENNINGTON  "You must go; that's all. There will be some way, you'll see."  Carl Mills and Lee Henly were separating for the night. They were close friends; and it's free too! People don't _want_ picture-galleries. If they did they'd go. Who ever saw a public-house empty, or Peter Robinson's? And you have to pay there! Silly, I call it! Why couldn't he have left his money to you, or at any rate dracaena marginata bark from the rocks along the coast.    OLD MUSKIE THE ROGUE  BY LEVI T. PENNINGTON  "You must go; that's all.

together between my teeth.  The seals were still where I had first seen them, out less than two 

hundred yards from shore.  I waded quickly into the water until the waves began to break over my 

head, and then swam. Before I had taken three strokes one of the fishes I held by my teeth began 

to lend assistance, jumping and splashing about so under my nose that I thought best to beat a 

retreat.  When I turned to gain shallow water again, however, I felt at once the strength of the 

undertow, which in my excitement I had entirely forgotten. I could make no headway against it until 

a couple of big waves came up from behind, and sent me far enough in to get a firm footing.  With 

confidence that my shad would give me no more trouble, I again turned to swim out. The water of 

the big waves that had boosted me in now began to draw me out in the undertow.  I hesitated 

when I felt the strength of its sweep, and still more as I thought of the greater force it would have 

when the tide turned. Where I stood I could withstand it, but a little deeper in I well knew it would 

be impossible to do so without the help of incoming waves.  "They just washed me ashore once; I 

guess they will again," I thought, and threw myself into the current.  As I approached the seals 

most of them began to swim off, but two or three of the larger males stood their ground, letting me 

come to within a couple of rods of them. Nearer, however, they would not let me draw, although 

their curiosity about me was great.  From the way they went circling round me, stretching their long 

necks up out of the water to get a good view, I concluded I was of a different species of water 

animal from those with which they were familiar. Of Nab, however, I could see nothing.  "Fish, 

Nab, fish, fish!" I called, and held up for inspection one of the shad I had brought.  At the sound of 

my voice there was a sharp little bark from behind, such as Nab alone could give when I had an 

exceptionally delicate morsel for him. I turned quickly, and saw at a distance his shining dog-

shaped head.  "Fish, Nab, a fine shad for you, fish!" I coaxed.  He came a little nearer, and I was 

confident the bait would prove irresistible. But my assurance was ill-founded, for in spite of all my 

coaxing, Nab only circled round and round me until I was dizzy trying to keep track of him. Either 

he had had fairly good luck fishing for himself that morning, and was not suffering very keen pangs 

of hunger, or else he still associated my benevolence too closely with the little square splash-tub 

of the seal-house.  When I had begun to grow weary from the incessant motion necessary to keep 

myself afloat, Nab suddenly made a dash so close that his flippers brushed my side. He snapped 

the fish out of my hand, and in the same instant he was again beyond reach. The fact that he had 

come up for one fish encouraged me to hope he would come also for the second, and I began to 

coax with renewed energy.  Nab was seemingly as much on his guard as before, however, and 

again went through his complete list of maneuvers, first rearing high out of the water, turning one 

side of his head and then the other toward me, then ducking into the depths with a final flourish of 

his tail, to reappear presently on the other side of me, as sportive as before.  By this time I had 

begun to feel pretty well exhausted, and when I suddenly thought of the undertow, I decided to 

swim back.  So intent had I been upon urging Nab near enough to get the lariat about his neck that 

I had not once looked toward shore. As I now did so I was terrified to find that one of the 

unaccountably shifting currents along Moss Beach had swept me a long distance out to sea. 

Without more nonsense, I dropped my remaining shad and started back with long, even strokes. 

Nab snapped up the fish and disappeared in the deep green water.  In spite of my efforts, I found 

that I was making small speed against the current. The rock and tree on the point of land to my 

right, by which I judged my progress, kept almost in the same straight line. Knowing it was useless 



to spend my strength directly against a current, I shifted my course in the direction of the point. 

From the sand-hills to my left I could see that I now made more progress, but the distance I had to 

cover was greater than straight to Moss Beach.  Before I had covered half the distance I was 

almost too fatigued to take another stroke; then the feeling of weariness seemed to leave me, and 

I swam on as if turned into a machine. It was in a mechanical way, too, that my brain seemed to 

work.  "If the undertow's as strong as when I came out," I thought, "I can never get through the 

breakers."  I wished I had told father my plans. He might have come out with a boat to get me. 

Then I wondered how it was that my arms and legs kept on moving when there was so little feeling 

in them.  The roar of the breakers had suddenly grown louder, and I saw I was within twenty yards 

of shore. I swam on with the same steady strokes, but at a certain distance from the water-line 

came to a standstill.  I knew I was held back by the undertow, and that there was need of all my 

remaining strength to get ashore. I increased my efforts, but surged helplessly forward and 

backward with the rising and falling waves.  When I thought I had given my last stroke, a big wave 

boosted me in, followed by a second and third, until it seemed I must be where I could reach 

bottom.  I let my feet down, down, until my toes at last touched the sand. I dug them in with all my 

might, and battled desperately to keep my footing.  Then came a little swell that lifted me from my 

feet, and the terrible current swooped me back again. My strength was gone, and I turned on my 

back to float.  "Perhaps I can try again if I rest," I thought, and meanwhile drifted out until the roar 

of the breakers came but dully to my ears--out where the water was deep and green.  Realizing 

that I paid for every minute of rest by drifting farther from shore, I rolled wearily over, and with slow 

strokes started back.  At this moment Nab stuck his nose from the water not three feet away. 

When I spoke his name, he came up so that I could put my hand on his neck. For half a minute he 

was quiet, letting me bear my weight upon him; then he showed by beginning to dive and circle 

that his motive in coming to me was purely for sport. Every other minute he would shake loose 

from my hand and then peer at me beneath the water as my head sank under.  At last I got such a 

firm grip on the nape of his neck that I could hold on even when he dived. With my other hand I 

untied the piece of lasso from round me and tried to put the noose over Nab's head. To this he 

had objections, and ducked and backed and splashed until I nearly strangled. Forced to give up 

this scheme, I nevertheless succeeded in getting a cinch round one of his hind flippers close up to 

the body.  "March, Nab!" I then shouted. "Forward, march!"  He either had forgotten his lessons or 

exulted in the fact that he was now at liberty to disobey orders, for instead of heading for shore, he 

started in the opposite direction.  "Haw!" I cried. "Haw! Gee, then, gee!" But Nab would turn neither 

to right nor left, and dragged me farther out to sea.  Thinking I might steer him by his flipper, I gave 

a jerk on the lariat. What the seal thought I don't know, but when he felt the noose tighten he 

seemed filled with sudden fright, and plunged into the depths. Instinctively I took a big breath when 

I saw him disappear, and laid hold of the lasso with both hands. In another instant I was making 

the longest dive under water that I believe man ever took.  It might have been pleasing to glide 

through the depths under other circumstances and at moderate speed; but following down after 

this uncertain guide at the rushing pace he set was the worst experience I ever had. I should 

another, babel existed! And then that terrible mute dining-room, with the high, unscalable 

mantelpieces that no midget could ever reach! He kept uttering the most dreadful judgments on 

the club and on Mr. Oxford, in quite audible tones, oblivious of the street. He was aroused by a 



rather scared man saluting him. It was Mr. Oxford's chauffeur, waiting patiently till his master 

should be ready to re-enter the wheeled salon. The chauffeur apparently thought him either 

demented or inebriated, but his sole duty was to salute, and he did nothing else.  Quite forgetting 

that this chauffeur was a fellow-creature, Priam immediately turned upon his heel, and hurried 

down the street. At the corner of the street was a large bank, and Priam, acquiring the reckless 

courage of the soldier in battle, entered the bank. He had never been in a London bank before. At 

first it reminded him of the club, with the addition of an enormous placard giving the day of the 

month as a mystical number--14--and other placards displaying solitary letters of the alphabet. 

Then he saw that it was a huge menagerie in which highly trained young men of assorted sizes 

and years were confined in stout cages of wire and mahogany. He stamped straight to a cage with 

a hole in it, and threw down the cheque for five hundred pounds--defiantly.  "Next desk, please," 

said a mouth over a high collar and a green tie, behind the grating, and a disdainful hand pushed 

the cheque back towards Priam.  "Next desk!" repeated Priam, dashed but furious.  "This is the A 

to M desk," said the mouth.  Then Priam understood the solitary letters, and he rushed, with a new 

accession of fury, to the adjoining cage, where another disdainful hand picked up the cheque and 

turned it over, with an air of saying, "Fishy, this!"  And, "It isn't endorsed!" said another mouth over 

another high collar and green tie. The second disdainful hand pushed the cheque back again to 

Priam, as though it had been a begging circular.  "Oh, if that's all!" said Priam, almost speechless 

from anger. "Have you got such a thing as a pen?"  He was behaving in an extremely 

unreasonable manner. He had no right to visit his spleen on a perfectly innocent bank that paid 

twenty-five per cent to its shareholders and a thousand a year each to its directors, and what trifle 

was left over to its men in rages. But Priam was not like you or me. He did not invariably act 

according to reason. He could not be angry with one man at once, nor even with one building at 

once. When he was angry he was inclusively and miscellaneously angry; and the sun, moon, and 

stars did not escape.  After he had endorsed the cheque the disdainful hand clawed it up once 

more, and directed upon its obverse and upon its reverse a battery of suspicions; then a pair of 

eyes glanced with critical distrust at so much of Priam's person as was visible. Then the eyes 

moved back, the mouth opened, in a brief word, and lo! there were four eyes and two mouths over 

the cheque, and four for an instant on Priam. Priam expected some one to call for a policeman; in 

spite of himself he felt guilty--or anyhow dubious. It was the grossest insult to him to throw doubt 

on the cheque and to examine him in that frigid, shamelessly disillusioned manner.  "You _are_ 

Mr. Leek?" a mouth moved.  "Yes" (very slowly).  "How would you like this?"  "I'll thank you to give 

it me in notes," answered Priam haughtily.  When the disdainful hand had counted twice every 

corner of a pile of notes, and had dropped the notes one by one, with a peculiar snapping sound of 

paper, in front of Priam, Priam crushed them together and crammed them without any ceremony 

and without gratitude to the giver, into the right pocket of his trousers. And he stamped out of the 

building with curses on his lips.  Still, he felt better, he felt assuaged. To cultivate and nourish a 

grievance when you have five hundred pounds in your pocket, in cash, is the most difficult thing in 

the world.   _A Visit to the Tailors'_   He gradually grew calmer by dint of walking--aimless, fast 

walking, with a rapt expression of the eyes that on crowded pavements cleared the way for him 

more effectually than a shouting footman. And then he debouched unexpectedly on to the 

Embankment. Dusk was already falling on the noble curve of the Thames, and the mighty 



panorama stretched before him in a manner mysteriously impressive which has made poets of 

less poetic men than Priam Farll. Grand hotels, offices of millionaires and of governments, grand 

hotels, swards and mullioned windows of the law, grand hotels, the terrific arches of termini, 

cathedral domes, houses of parliament, and grand hotels, rose darkly around him on the arc of the 

river, against the dark violet murk of the sky. Huge trams swam past him like glass houses, and 

hansoms shot past the trams and automobiles past the hansoms; and phantom barges swirled 

down on the full ebb, threading holes in bridges as cotton threads a needle. It was London, and 

the roar of London, majestic, imperial, super-Roman. And lo! earlier than the earliest municipal 

light, an unseen hand, the hand of destiny, printed a writing on the wall of vague gloom that was 

beginning to hide the opposite bank. And the writing said that Shipton's tea was the best. And then 

the hand wiped largely out that message and wrote in another spot that Macdonnell's whisky was 

the best; and so these two doctrines, in their intermittent pyrotechnics, continued to give the lie to 

each other under the deepening night. Quite five minutes passed before Priam perceived, 

between the altercating doctrines, the high scaffold-clad summit of a building which was unfamiliar 

to him. It looked serenely and immaterially beautiful in the evening twilight, and as he was close to 

Waterloo Bridge, his curiosity concerning beauty took him over to the south bank of the Thames. 

After losing himself in the purlieus of Waterloo Station, he at last discovered the rear of the 

building. Yes, it was a beautiful thing; its tower climbed in several coloured storeys, diminishing till 

it expired in a winged figure on the sky. And below, the building was broad and massive, with a 

frontage of pillars over great arched windows. Two cranes stuck their arms out from the general 

mass, and the whole enterprise was guarded in a hedge of hoardings. Through the narrow 

doorway in the hoarding came the flare and the hissing of a Wells's light. Priam Farll glanced 

timidly within. The interior was immense. In a sort of court of honour a group of muscular, hairy 

males, silhouetted against an illuminated latticework of scaffolding, were chipping and paring at 

huge blocks of stone. It was a subject for a Rembrandt.  A fat untidy man meditatively approached 

the doorway. He had a roll of tracing papers in his hand, and the end of a long, thick pencil in his 

mouth. He was the man who interpreted the dreams of the architect to the dreamy British artisan. 

Experience of life had made him somewhat brusque.  "Look here," he said to Priam; "what the 

devil do you want?"  "What the devil do I want?" repeated Priam, who had not yet altogether fallen 

away from his mood of universal defiance. "I only want to know what the h-ll this building is."  The 

fat man was a little startled. He took his pencil from his mouth, and spit.  "It's the new Picture 

Gallery, built under the will of that there Priam Farll. I should ha' thought you'd ha' known that." 

Priam's lips trembled on the verge of an exclamation. "See that?" the fat man pursued, pointing to 

a small board on the hoarding. The board said, "No hands wanted."  The fat man coldly scrutinized 

Priam's appearance, from his greenish hat to his baggy creased boots.  Priam walked away.  He 

was dumbfounded. Then he was furious again. He perfectly saw the humour of the situation, but it 

was not the kind of humour that induced rollicking laughter. He 


_
there was no worse place than that from which I had started.  I hung on and on, even after it 

seemed I should burst for want of air. Then came a shiver along the lariat and the sensation in my 

body of scraping against a rock. Although I still held on tightly, my speed suddenly slackened, and 

I knew the old lasso had been cut in two on the rock.  Half-strangled though I was, I began pawing 

my way to the surface. When at last my head broke through into the air, I hung to the rock, 

sputtering and gasping. I didn't attempt to do more than get my breath for, I think, a quarter of an 

hour; but at last I looked round to see where I was.  At first I could not make it out, for Moss Beach 

was nowhere in sight; then, when I saw a couple of huge pelicans perched on the rock above my 

head, the truth came to me. Nab had taken me out clear round the point and over to Seal Rocks--

the island home of seals and pelicans. How I ever could have taken such a dive and come out 

alive is still a mystery to me, except when I remember how the water churned in my ears at our 

terrific speed.  The rock upon which I hung had been Nab's birthplace, and the place where he 

had been captured by father and me. Here he used to lie to toast in the sun, and here also he had 

fled when he felt my line round his flipper.  As soon as I could clear the salt water from my mouth 

and lungs I began to work my way up on the rock.  Exhausted as I was, and benumbed with cold, 

this was no easy matter; and once, when a fragment of rock gave way beneath my fingers, I nearly 

slipped back into the water. But at last I crawled up far enough to send off the pelicans in fright, 

and to get where the sun would strike me. I expected to blister my back, but I thought it would be a 

welcome change from the freezing process.  After the blood had begun to warm up a little in my 

veins I began to think of getting back to the mainland.  It was a distance of only a hundred yards 

from the when it is not overheard. Absorbed by his craft of painting, as in the old Continental days, 

he had long since ceased to read the newspapers, and though he had not forgotten his bequest to 

the nation, he had never thought of it as taking architectural shape. He was not aware of his 

cousin Duncan's activities for the perpetuation of the family name. The thing staggered him. The 

probabilities of the strange consequences of dead actions swept against him and overwhelmed 

him. Once, years ago and years ago, in a resentful mood, he had written a few lines on a piece of 

paper, and signed them in the presence of witnesses. Then nothing--nothing whatever--for two 

decades! The paper slept... and now this--this tremendous concrete result in the heart of London! 

It was incredible. It passed the bounds even of lawful magic.  His palace, his museum! The fruit of 

a captious hour!  Ah! But he was furious. Like every ageing artist of genuine accomplishment, he 

knew--none better--that there is no satisfaction save the satisfaction of fatigue after honest 

endeavour. He knew--none better--that wealth and glory and fine clothes are nought, and that 

striving is all. He had never been happier than during the last two years. Yet the finest souls have 

their reactions, their rebellions against wise reason. And Priam's soul was in insurrection then. He 

wanted wealth and glory and fine clothes once more. It seemed to him that he was out of the world 

and that he must return to it. The covert insults of Mr. Oxford rankled and stung. And the fat 

foreman had mistaken him for a workman cadging for a job.  He walked rapidly to the bridge and 

took a cab to Conduit Street, where dwelt a firm of tailors with whose Paris branch he had had 

dealings in his dandiacal past.  An odd impulse perhaps, but natural.  A lighted clock-tower--far to 

his left as the cab rolled across the bridge--showed that a legislative providence was watching 

over Israel.   _Alice 


_
when I looked down into that green water and recalled my recent experiences I shrank from sliding 

in as from death itself. I measured the distance twenty times with my eyes, and the same number 

of times assured myself that there would be no undertow here with the tide coming in, but I could 

not bring myself to let go the rocks that felt so firm and good.  When I observed, however, that it 

was nearly high tide, and that I should have to swim against the tide if I waited much longer, I 

climbed down without more fooling, and struck back for shore. Although a side current shifted me 

from my direct course so that I had to land upon another beach than I had intended, I got ashore 

without difficulty, and hastened across the point to Moss Beach, where I had left my clothes.  I 

never again attempted to recapture Nab, nor have I had an opportunity to repay him for towing me 

to Seal Rocks; but I have seen him a   "I bet the building alone won't cost less than seventy 

thousand pounds," he said.  He was back again with Alice in the intimacy of Werter Road, and 

relating to her, in part, the adventures of the latter portion of the day. He had reached home long 

after tea-time; she, with her natural sagacity, had not waited tea for him. Now she had prepared a 

rather special tea for the adventurer, and she was sitting opposite to him at the little table, with 

nothing to do but listen and refill his cup.  "Well," she said mildly, and without the least surprise at 

his figures, "I don't know what he could have been thinking of--your Priam Farll! I call it just silly. It 

isn't as if there wasn't enough picture-galleries already. When what there are are so full that you 

can't get in--then it will be time enough to think about fresh ones. I've been to the National Gallery 

twice, and upon my word I was almost the only
