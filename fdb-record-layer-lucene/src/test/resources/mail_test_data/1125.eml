dracaena marginata there with her father, what we shall want will be some one in observation--some one who can help us to draw our birds into the snare just when we are ready for them. Now there is a man whom you and I have had just now."  "What! not a single word?"  "Not one.  You understand?"  "Yes, but, if he asks me, I must answer something, you know, and I must not tell lies."  "Quite true, dracaena marginata there with her father, what we shall want will be some one in observation--some one who can help us to draw our birds into the snare just when we are ready for them. Now there is a man whom you and I have had just now."  "What! not a single word?"  "Not one.  You understand?"

warn commandant Fleury if I suspect that the English are making ready for a coup outside the 

tavern. Personally I think it unlikely--because the duc de Kernogan will be inside the Rat Mort all 

the time, and he too will be the object of the Englishmen's attacks on his behalf. Citizen Martin-

Roget too has about a score or so of his friends posted outside his sister's house: they are lads 

from his village who hate the Kernogans as much as he Little Bill?"  "Because he said he wanted

have arranged everything satisfactorily, what?"  "Everything, except the exact moment when

in the name of the Republic."  "Yes, he will have to make quite sure that the whole of our quarry is 

inside the net, eh?... before he draws the strings ... or all our pretty plans fall to nought."  "As you 

say," rejoined Chauvelin, "we must make sure. Supposing therefore that we get the wench safely 

into the tavern, going to tell me something more, very particularly, for he was just saying, in a very 

solemn tone, `You must on no account mention--' when your little dog bounced in and Jenkins 

bounced out, leaving the rest of it unsaid."  "Then he has just left you?" said Elise.  "Just a 

moment or two before you came up.  I think he must have seen some sort of beast in the wood, 

and gone in chase of it, he bolted in such a hurry, so I don't know yet what I was not to mention."
