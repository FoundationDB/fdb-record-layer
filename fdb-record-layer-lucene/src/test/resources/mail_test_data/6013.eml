Paul and St. Peter had lived in these days, they'd have been able to cry fr=
om the bottom of the=20

heart, 'Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners.'"  Ben Stone gave a look whi=
ch seemed to say=20

that he neither understood nor cared to understand how that could be. Ned F=
ranks's feelings were=20

much like what Mr. Curtis had described as his own. It seemed a hopeless ma=
tter to try to make=20

any real impression upon that mass of quiet, self-complacent, good-humored =
insensibility. Ned=20

had to repeat to himself, "He's a dying man, and dying without looking to t=
he Saviour," in order to=20

overcome his own strong inclination to give up in despair all attempt to co=
nvince or to move.  "I=20

suppose that you'll agree," said the school-master aloud, "that Job was a s=
aint if there ever lived=20

one in this world; God himself declared that there was none upon earth like=
 him; and yet, what=20

were the words of Job? _I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes._"  "I=
 never can make out=20

why Job should feel that," observed Stone; "there was nothing in what the A=
lmighty had said to=20

him to bring him to such a confession."  "I believe that it was not so much=
 what God had _said_,=20

as what he had found God to _be_, that so humbled Job as to make him confes=
s himself to be a=20

miserable sinner. The truth is, neighbor, we think so little of our own sin=
fulness, because we think=20

so little of God's holiness. The clear light of his purity does not stream =
into our souls, and therefore=20

we don't mark the spots and the stains in those souls. We think sins small =
and trifling which in the=20

Lord's eyes are hateful and deadly. Eve plucks a forbidden fruit, Moses los=
es his temper, a man of=20

God lets himself be drawn into what we might deem a small excusable act of =
disobedience: it is=20

clear enough from the punishments which followed, that a holy God did not r=
egard these things as=20

_trifles_, though man in his blindness might do so."  "Ah! all these exampl=
es are from the Old=20

Testament," said Ben Stone; "as for me, I hold by the New. There's none of =
that terrible strictness=20

now."  "The God of the New Testament is the God of the Old," observed Frank=
s; "the at myself in=20

the glass, and wondered that so many hours of misery had made so little imp=

while one is young one can suffer a good deal and one's face tell no secret=
.  We were to make a=20

very early start to examine the wonderful motor-car which Lord Robert West =
had advised Aunt Lil=20

to buy. Afterwards she and Lisa and I had planned to do a little shopping, =
because it would seem a=20

waste of time to be in Paris and bring nothing away from the shops. But whe=
n I tapped at Lisa's=20

door (dreading, yet wishing, to have our first greeting over), it appeared =
that she had a bad=20

headache and did not want to go with us to see the Rajah's automobile. Whil=
e I was with her Aunt=20

Lil came in, looking very bright and handsome.  She was "so sorry" for Lisa=
, and not at all sorry for=20

me (how little she guessed!); and before taking me away with her, promised =
to come back after it=20

was settled about the car, to see whether Lisa were well enough by that tim=
e for the shopping=20

expedition.  The automobile really was a "magnificent animal," as Aunt Lil =
said, and it took her just=20

two minutes, after examining it from bonnet to tool-boxes, to make up her m=
ind that she could not=20

be happy without it. It was sixty horsepower, and of a world-renowned make;=
 but that was a detail.=20

_Any_ car could be powerful and well made; every car should be, or you woul=
d not pay for it; but=20

she had never seen one before with such heavenly little arrangements for lu=
ggage and lunch;=20

while as for the gold toilet things, in a pale grey suede case, they were b=
eyond words, and she=20

must have them--the motor also, of course, since it went with them.  So tha=
t was decided; and she=20

and I drove back to the hotel, while the two men went to the Automobile Clu=
b, of which Lord Bob=20



was an honorary member.  If possible, all formalities were to be got throug=
h with the Rajah's agent=20

and the car paid for. At two o'clock, when we were to meet the men at the R=
itz for luncheon, they=20

were to let us know whether everything had been successfully arranged: and,=
 if so, Aunt Lil=20

wanted the party to motor to Calais in her new automobile, instead of going=

sinneth, it shall die_."  "You talk like a Jew," said Stone; "yet you know =
as well, and better than I=20

do, that we've the gospel to look to now, and that's all mercy and love."  =
"The New Testament=20

rests on the Old; it has grown out of it; it forms with it a complete whole=
. We cannot really accept=20

the one without the other," replied Franks, with an animation of Bob would =
drive, but he meant to=20

hire a chauffeur recommended by the Club, so that he would not have to stop=
 behind and see to=20

getting the car across the Channel in a cargo boat.  Aunt Lil was very much=
 excited over this idea,=20

as she always is over anything new, and if I was rather quiet and uninteres=
ted, she was too much=20

occupied to notice.  Lisa was looking=20

smiling observed, "The New is enough for me."  Ned Franks glanced around fo=
r something that=20

might serve to illustrate the important truth which his companion could not=

either. She is always nice to Lisa, but she doesn't like her, and it is onl=
