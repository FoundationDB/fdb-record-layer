The slaves arose with the sun to begin their tasks in the fields and worked=
 until dusk. They were=20

beaten by the overseer if they dared to rest themselves. No kind of punishm=
ent was too cruel or=20

severe to be inflicted upon these souls in bondage. Frequently the thighs o=
f the male slaves were=20

s pregnant and had to be=20

punished, she was whipped about the shoulders, not so much in pity as for t=
he protection of the=20

unborn child. Donaldson's wife committed suicide because of the cruelty not=
 only to the slaves but=20

to her as well.  The slaves were not permitted to hold any sort of meeting,=
 not even to worship=20

g heart. When his=20

scenes are laid in the past, he has honestly studied the history. The histo=
ry of his novels is=20

perhaps not critically accurate, not up to the mark of our present knowledg=
e, but in the main it is=20

sound and true--sounder and more true than that of many professed historian=
