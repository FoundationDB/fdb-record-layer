which the Greeks call [Greek: isatis], and make an imitation of indigo.  3. In this book I have written 

down, so far as I could recall them, the methods and means of attaining durability in polished 

finishings, how pictures that are appropriate should be made, and also the natural qualities of all 

the colours. And so, having prescribed in seven books the suitable principles which should govern 

the construction of all kinds of buildings, I shall treat in the next of water, showing how it may be 

found in places where it is wanting, by what method it may be conducted, and by what means its 

wholesomeness and fitness may be tested.     BOOK VIII     INTRODUCTION   1. Among the 

Seven Sages, Thales of Miletus pronounced for water as the primordial element in all things; 

Heraclitus, for fire; the priests of the Magi, for water and fire; Euripides, a pupil of Anaxagoras, and 

called by the Athenians "the philosopher of the stage," for air and earth. Earth, he held, was 

impregnated by the rains of heaven and, thus conceiving, brought forth the young of mankind and 

of all the living creatures in the world; whatever is sprung from her goes back to her again when 

the compelling force of time brings about a dissolution; and whatever is born of the air returns in 

the same way to the regions of the sky; nothing suffers annihilation, but at dissolution there is a 

change, and things fall back to the essential element in which they were before. But Pythagoras, 

Empedocles, Epicharmus, and other physicists and philosophers have set forth that the in at our 

shouts....  "Let me alone!" I cried; "let me alone! Go away!"  My legs turned numb as though they 

had ceased to exist; I felt myself falling into someone's arms; for a little while I still heard weeping, 

then sank into a swoon which lasted two or three hours.  Now about Katya; she comes to see me 

every day towards evening, and of course neither the neighbours nor our acquaintances can avoid 

noticing it. She comes in for a minute and carries me off for a drive with her. She has her own 

horse and a new chaise bought this summer. Altogether she lives in an expensive style; she has 

taken a big detached villa with a large garden, and has taken all her town retinue with her--two 

maids, a coachman... I often ask her:  "Katya, what will you live on when you have spent your 

father's money?"  "Then we shall see," she answers.  "That money, my dear, deserves to be 

treated more seriously. It was earned by a good man, by honest labour."  "You have told me that 

already. I know it."  At first we drive through the open country, then through the pine-wood which is 

visible from my window. Nature seems to me as beautiful as it always has been, though some evil 

spirit whispers to me that these pines and fir trees, birds, and white clouds on the sky, will not 

notice my absence when in three or four months I am dead. Katya loves driving, and she is 

pleased that it is fine weather and that I am sitting beside her. She is in good spirits and does not 

say harsh things.  "You are a very good man, Nikolay Stepanovitch," she says. "You are a

number: air, fire, earth, and water; and that it is from their coherence to one another under the 

moulding power of nature that the qualities of things are produced according to different classes. 

2. And, in fact, we see not only that all which comes to birth is produced by them, but also that 

nothing can be nourished without their influence, nor grow, nor be preserved. The body, for 

example, can have no life without the flow of the breath to and fro, that is, unless an abundance of 

air flows in, causing dilations and contractions in regular succession. Without the right proportion 

of heat, the body will lack vitality, will not be well set up, and will not properly digest strong food. 

Again, without the fruits of the earth to nourish the bodily frame, it will be enfeebled, and so lose its 

admixture of the earthy element.  3. Finally, without the influence of moisture, living creatures will 

be bloodless and, having the liquid element sucked out of them, will wither away. Accordingly the 

divine intelligence has not made what is really indispensable for man either hard to get or costly, 

like pearls, gold, silver, and so forth, the lack of which neither our body nor our nature feels, but 

has spread abroad, ready to hand through all the world, the things without which the life of mortals 

cannot be maintained. Thus, to take examples, suppose there is a deficiency of breath in the body, 

the air, to which is assigned the function of making up the deficiency, performs that service. To 

supply heat, the mighty sun is ready, and the invention of fire makes life more secure. Then again, 

the fruits of the earth, satisfying our desires with a more than sufficient store of food stuffs, support 

and maintain living beings with regular nourishment. Finally, water, not merely supplying drink but 

filling an infinite number of practical needs, does us services which make us grateful because it is 

gratis.  4. Hence, too, those who are clothed in priesthoods of the Egyptian orders declare that all 

things depend upon the power of the liquid element. So, when the waterpot is brought back to 

precinct and temple with water, in accordance with the holy rite, they throw themselves upon the 

ground and, raising their hands to heaven, thank the divine benevolence for its invention. 

Therefore, since it is held by physicists and philosophers and priests that all things depend upon 

the power of water, I have thought that, as in the former seven books the rules for buildings have 

been set forth, in this I ought to write on the methods of finding water, on those special merits 

which are due to the qualities of localities, on the ways of conducting it, and how it may be tested 

in advance. For it is the chief requisite for life, for happiness, and for everyday use.     CHAPTER I 

HOW TO FIND WATER   1. This will be easier if there are open springs of running water. But if 

there are no springs which gush forth, we must search for them underground, and conduct them 

together. The following test should be applied. Before sunrise, lie down flat in the place where the 

search is to be made, and placing the chin on the earth and supporting it there, take a look out 

over the country. In this way the sight will not range higher than it ought, the chin being 

immovable, but will range over a definitely limited height on the same level through the country. 

Then, dig in places where vapours are seen curling and rising up into the air. This sign cannot 

show itself in a dry spot.  2. Searchers for water must also study the nature of different localities; 

for those in which it is found are well defined. In clay the supply is poor, meagre, and at no great 

depth. It will not have the best taste. In fine gravel the supply is also poor, but it will be found at a 

greater depth. It will be muddy and not sweet. In black earth some slight drippings and drops are 

found that gather from the storms of winter and settle down in compact, hard places. They have 

the best taste. Among pebbles the veins found are moderate, and not to be depended upon. 

These, you. Me or Mihail Fyodorovitch, for instance, any poor actor could do, but not you. And I 



envy you, I envy you horribly! Do you know what I stand for? What?"  She ponders for a minute, 

and then asks me:  "Nikolay Stepanovitch, I am a negative phenomenon! Yes?"  "Yes," I answer. 

"H'm! what am I to do?"  What answer was I to make her? It is easy to say "work," or "give your 

possessions to the poor," or "know yourself," and because it is so easy to say that, I don't know 

what to answer.  My colleagues when they teach therapeutics advise "the individual study of each 

separate case." One has but to obey this advice to gain the conviction that the methods 

recommended in the textbooks as the best and as providing a safe basis for treatment turn out to 

be quite unsuitable in individual cases. It is just the same in moral ailments.  But I must make 

some answer, and I say:  "You have too much free time, my dear; you absolutely must take up 

some occupation. After all, why shouldn't you be an actress again if it is your vocation?"  "I 

cannot!"  "Your tone and manner suggest that you are a victim. I don't like that, my dear; it is your 

own fault. Remember, you began with falling out with people and methods, but you have done 

nothing to make either better. You did not struggle with evil, but were cast down by it, and you are 

not the victim of the struggle, but of your own impotence. Well, of course you were young and 

inexperienced then; now it may all be different. Yes, really, go on the stage. You will work, you will 

serve a sacred art."  "Don't pretend, Nikolay Stepanovitch," Katya interrupts me. "Let us make a 

compact once for all; we will talk about actors, actresses, and authors, but we will let art alone. 

You are a splendid and rare person, but you don't know enough about art sincerely to think it 

sacred. You have no instinct or feeling for art. You have been hard at work all your life, and have 

not had time to acquire that feeling. Altogether... I don't like talk about art," she goes on nervously. 

"I don't like it! And, my goodness, how they have vulgarized it!"  "Who has vulgarized it?"  "They 

have vulgarized it by drunkenness, the newspapers by their familiar attitude, clever people by 

philosophy."  "Philosophy has nothing to do with it."  "Yes, it has. If any one philosophizes about it, 

it shows he does not understand it."  To avoid bitterness I hasten to change the subject, and then 

sit a long time silent. Only when we are driving out of the wood and turning towards Katya's villa I 

go back to my former question, and say:  "You have still not answered me, why you don't want to 

go on the stage."  "Nikolay Stepanovitch, this is cruel!" she cries, and suddenly flushes all over. 

"You want me to tell you the truth aloud? Very well, if... if you like it! I have no talent! No talent 

and... and a great deal of vanity! So there!"  After making this confession she turns her face away 

from me, and to hide the trembling of her hands tugs violently at the reins.  As we are driving 

towards her villa we see Mihail Fyodorovitch walking near the gate, impatiently awaiting us.  "That 

Mihail Fyodorovitch again!" says Katya with vexation. "Do rid me of him, please! I am sick and 

tired of him... bother him!"  Mihail Fyodorovitch ought to have gone abroad long ago, but he puts 

off going from week to week. Of late there have been certain changes in him. He looks, as it were, 

sunken, has taken to drinking until he is tipsy, a thing which never used to happen to him, and his 

black eyebrows are beginning to turn grey. When our chaise stops at the gate he does not conceal 

his joy and his impatience. He fussily helps me and Katya out, hurriedly asks questions, laughs, 

rubs his hands, and that gentle, imploring, pure expression, which I used to notice only in his eyes, 

is now suffused all over his face. He is glad and at the same time he is ashamed of his gladness, 

ashamed of his habit of spending every evening with Katya. And he thinks it necessary to explain 

his visit by some obvious absurdity such as: "I was driving 


_
and carbuncular sand the supply is surer and more lasting, and it has a good taste. In red tufa it is 

copious and good, if it does not run down through the fissures and escape. At the foot of 

mountains and in lava it is more plentiful and abundant, and here it is also colder and more 

wholesome. In flat countries the springs are salt, heavy-bodied, tepid, and ill-flavoured, excepting 

those which run underground from mountains, and burst forth in the middle of a plain, where, if 

protected by the shade of look in for a minute."  We all three go indoors; first we drink tea, then the 

familiar packs of cards, the big piece of cheese, the fruit, and the bottle of Crimean champagne 

are put upon the table. The subjects of our conversation are not new; they are just the same as in 

the winter. We fall foul of the University, the students, and literature and the theatre; the air grows 

thick and stifling with evil speaking, and poisoned by the breath, not of two toads as in the winter, 

but of three. Besides the
