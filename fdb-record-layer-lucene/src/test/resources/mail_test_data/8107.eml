ri; and one might as soon have expected the lion to mate with the serpent, =
as to _
laboring on public works, as bridges, highways, churches, convents, school-=
houses, etc.,--an=20

exaction which, according to them, did not go with the equality which was e=
stablished among all=20

by the Constitution; and it cost the alcalde-mayor of the province his utmo=
st efforts to restrain the=20

Ilocanos from violence." Still worse were the effects of the renewal of abs=
olutism in Spain, on the=20

return of Fernando VII from his captivity in France; for on May 4, 1814, he=
 issued a decree=20

abolishing the Cortes, and nullifying its acts, and immediately began a cou=
rse of persecution and=20

condemnation, even to death, of all the prominent Liberals in the country. =
He also restablished in=20

Spain the Inquisition [10] (which had been abolished by the Cortes on Febru=
ary 22, 1813), and the=20

Society of Jesus. When the royal decrees were received in Filipinas, the In=
dians believed that they=20

were false, and concocted in Manila; one thousand five hundred Ilocanos sei=
zed their arms, and=20

began plundering, killing, and destroying throughout the province. This was=
 mainly, however, a=20

rebellion of the common people (Tagal, cailianes) against the ruling class,=
 the principala or=20

notables; and the latter finally took arms against the rebels, aiding the S=
paniards to suppress the=20

insurrection. On July 20, 1814, a treaty of peace was made between Spain an=
d France.=20

"Gardoqui, by an edict of December 1, 1814, prohibited the introduction of =
opium into Filipinas,=20

imposing on those who should violate this law six years of confinement in a=
 presidio and the=20

confiscation of the opium; and to those who were found smoking the drug a f=
ortnight's=20

imprisonment for the first offense, thirty days for the second, and four ye=
ars in presidio for the=20

third. A term of eight days was allowed in order that persons who might pos=
sess unsold stocks of=20

the said drug could deposit them in the custom-house for reshipment to Chin=
a. In the said year of=20

1814, there was built in the environs of the town of Laoag (Ilocos Norte) a=
 leper hospital, at the=20

expense of the charitable parish priest there, Fray Vicente Febras, an Augu=
stinian; and this act is=20

worthy of note, towns, strongly condemned any one who without good reason, =
bought at the relief=20

depots.  By June, every one was anxious to know if the rains would come and=
 insure the=20

September crops--there are two rice harvests each year. Thousands of sacrif=
ices were offered,=20

and sometimes human beings were offered. But the rains came, and the fall b=
rought abundant=20

crops.  The total loss of life was about 1,250,000, of whom one-fourth star=
ved outright, while the=20

remainder perished from disease and pestilence resulting from the scarcity =
of food. A famine in the=20

same region in 1769 carried off 6,000,000; but then the government did noth=
ing, and after the=20

scourge immense tracts of cultivated land returned to their original wilder=
ness. The reverse was=20

the result in 1866. The methodical work of the government and the great cor=
porations left the land=20

far more improved than ever before; with the increasing facilities for comm=
unication and=20

transportation, a repetition of the disaster even of 1866 is almost impossi=
ble--certainly beyond=20

probability.  We may not go into details of scores of famines, ancient and =
modern; we have=20

selected this one, showing how, even in adverse circumstances, prompt work =
lessens the ravages=20

of the destroyer. Judging from the percentage of 1769, the loss of life in =
1866 would, but for the=20

relief work, have been about 9,000,000--one-third the population of Bengal.=
 The only other=20

calamity in recent years at all comparable, is the terrible famine of 1876 =
in China. How many=20

perished then may not be definitely known; but it has been variously estima=
ted at from 15,000,000=20

to 50,000,000. We may not dwell upon the horrors of such things--the hideou=
s cannibalism that=20

has at times resulted; as when we are told that during one famine in Egypt,=
 in the dark ages,=20

human flesh was openly sold in the markets!  A terrible scourge that freque=
ntly visited the old=20



world in the middle and dark ages is that known as the =E2=80=9CBlack Death=
.=E2=80=9D As to its real character and=20

source, the world is yet in ignorance. Whether it was readily conveyed in t=
he atmosphere or not=20

seems a mooted point. Modern medical science has robbed many=20


_
kind in the provinces of the Archipelago." A royal decree of August 22, 181=
5, restablished the=20

Jesuit order in the Indias and Filipinas; and another, dated December 11, c=
ommanded the seizure=20

in the colonies of various political books and pamphlets, with penalties fo=
r their use in schools.=20

After the death of Governor Aguilar, the Moro pirates were comparatively qu=
iet for a time, but in=20

1813 they renewed their attacks on the Spanish territories, and during seve=
ral years they=20

harassed the latter, taking many captives, and even seizing several vessels=
, both Spanish and=20

English, on the seas. Governor Raffles, of Java, after the restoration of t=
hat island by England to=20

Holland, proposed to Gardoqui that they coperate in occupying Jol and Minda=
nao; but the=20

Spaniard declined this, protesting against any operations by the English in=
 Spanish territory.=20

"Gardoqui, during his term of office, caused the fortifications of Cavite t=
o be repaired, making them=20

very strong; he Small-pox is easily guarded against. Diptheria has no terro=
rs for clean streets.=20

Yellow Jack has little chance against sound sanitation and hygiene. The ger=
m theory of disease=20

has greatly aided disinfective measures.  In contagious diseases, infection=
 proceeds chiefly from=20

personal contact with a diseased person or objects that have been touched b=
y him. In malarial=20

diseases there is no danger from personal contact; the disease resulting cl=
early from a poisoned=20

atmosphere. But in the case of what are known as epidemics, the source of i=
nfection is not clear.=20

The disease may attack thousands in a short time, and yet not appear readil=
y communicable by=20

personal contact. Doubtless in these cases the atmosphere is the medium of =
infection. Hence,=20

disinfective measures are of little or no use against them. So while such c=
an not properly be=20

classed among atmospheric phenomena, yet it would seem that in the atmosphe=
re we find the=20

chief vehicle of the disease.  We may not=20

measures; he created the general administration for the revenues from wine;=
 and he occupied=20

himself greatly with the improvement and development of the tobacco plantat=
ions. The bandits,=20

smugglers, and gamblers had been increasing at an alarming rate; and, in or=
der that they might be=20

promptly punished the governor appointed a military commission, headed by a=
 lieutenant-colonel.=20

Thanks to their energetic proceedings, the desired object was attained." Ga=
rdoqui's last days were=20

embittered, and his end hastened, by the treacherous act of one of his secr=
etaries, who, by=20

substituting a false report for the one which Gardoqui had dictated in favo=
r of retaining the naval=20

bureau, procured the governor's unwitting signature to the former and thus =
made him appear to=20

report adversely to the bureau; as a result, the bureau was suppressed by a=
 royal decree of March=20

23, 1815. His disappointment and wounded honor so grieved him that his deat=
h soon resulted=20

(December 9, 1816).  The command ad interim was again assumed by Folgueras,=
 who held it=20

during nearly six years. On December 17, 1819, he restablished the "Royal E=
conomic Society of=20

Filipinas," as a result of royal orders to that effect issued in 1811 and 1=
813; and five days later its=20

first session was held, the governor presiding, contagious diseases that ar=
e known to modern=20

medicine. Suffice it to say nearly all of them may be classed as filth dise=
ases, arising from impure=20

food or water, or filthy streets. Most notable of these is perhaps the terr=
ible Asiatic cholera, that=20

has swept Europe frequently, and which is now known to originate in the ove=
rcrowding and filth=20

attendant upon the great twelve-yearly festival in honor of a Hindoo idol. =
Had the people of the=20

middle ages, who regarded its ravages as a visitation of God upon them for =
their sins, been aware=20

of its origin, they might have been disposed to wonder why they should be p=
unished for the=20

idolatry of a people thousands of miles away. Possibly such reflections mig=
ht have originated=20

either a new species of crusade, or have opened the missionary movement sev=
eral centuries=20

earlier than it really began.  Comparatively speaking, there is little myst=
ery left in connection with=20

the greater contagious plagues known to modern medicine. But the famous Bla=
ck Death, or=20

Plague, or the Pestilence, as it is variously called, remains a secret so f=
ar as its origin and its=20

proper treatment are concerned. Its symptoms are somewhat variously describ=
ed by various=20

ancient writers. In one point all agree: that when near death the body of t=
he victim was covered=20


_
of the original society being still alive. [11] A month later, it met again=
, with sixty new members,=20

and Manuel Bernldez was chosen director of the association; and its new ord=
inances were=20

approved by the governor on July 24 following. Folgueras, learning that cer=
tain immunities and=20

advantages had been granted to Cuba and Puerto Rico for the encouragement o=
f agriculture,=20

requested from the home government similar help for Filipinas; the crown de=
creed an investigation=20

of the subject, but the fulfilment of this was delayed from time to time, s=
o that not until 1848 was=20

even a definite statement and proposal for action in this direction made. [=
12] (This was done by=20

Rafael Daz Arenas, one of the four members of the Economic Society--to whic=
h the investigation=20

had been referred--who had been appointed to prepare the data for a report =
to the crown; "but we=20

do not know whether the Society accepted his proposal, or whether it reache=
d any definite=20

conclusion on the subject.") In October of the year 1820, Manila was ravage=
d by a terrible=20

epidemic of smallpox, which was especially fatal in the villages along the =
Pasig River; the=20

corregidor of Tondo therefore issued an edict prohibiting the use of the ri=
ver water. A public relief=20

committee was organized to give the sick medical swellings, or boils made t=
heir appearance in the=20

glands of the neck, armpit and groin. It may be that the plague of boils an=
d blains sent upon the=20

Egyptians was none other than this Black Death. And doubtless it is identic=
al with the terrible=20

plague that visited Athens, B. C., 430, continuing its ravages through thre=
e years. People died in=20

swarms, and the dead lay about the streets.  During the middle ages it appe=
ared in Europe on an=20

average, every fifty years, its last visitation being upon London, in 1665,=
 when 100,000 people=20

perished. Here its danger was increased by the fact that its character was =
more insidious than=20

usual. The plague described by Thucydides was characterized by high fever a=
nd unquenchable=20

thirst, and a reddish inflammation or eruption of the skin lasting seven or=
 eight days before the=20

appearance of the fatal spots; while from Defoe=E2=80=99s account of the pl=
ague in London, these=20

symptoms, though common, were anything but universal; and frequently person=
s felt no special=20

disorder till the appearance of the spots told that death was at hand. Both=
 in Athens and London,=20

contact with the dead bodies seems to have been fatal to any animal. The su=
ddenness of death in=20

many cases calls to mind the last plague of Egypt, or the fate of Sennacher=
ib=E2=80=99s host:=20


_
and the private citizens vied with the authorities in ministering to the vi=
ctims of the pest. The=20

medical men belonging to the ships anchored in the bay came to the city, an=
d did all in their power=20

to aid these benevolent efforts; but all these things only confirmed in the=
 ignorant natives the fatal=20

idea, already spread among them, that the disease was caused by the foreign=
ers having poisoned=20

the waters and used to this end the specimens of insects and other creature=
s which they had=20

collected for scientific purposes. A crowd of armed Indians therefore gathe=
red in the square of=20

Binondo on October 9, attacked the houses of the foreigners, and murdered t=
wenty-seven=20

persons--among whom was not one Spaniard; nor did they, in plundering the h=
ouses, rob any=20

Spaniard. The governor sent out some troops, but they accomplished nothing =
in checking the riot,=20

which ended only at nightfall; and he did nothing to prevent further crimes=
 of this sort, so that the=20

mob renewed their acts of violence the next day, [13] plundering and killin=
g many Chinese of the=20

suburbs. This aroused Folgueras to activity, and he sent out a large force =
of soldiers to pursue the=20

assassins; but the latter at once dispersed. A council of the authorities w=
as called, but there were=20

discordant opinions among them, and they seem to have taken no      That ho=
st with their banners=20

lown,      That host in=20

the morning lay withered and strown.       For the Angel of Death spread hi=
s wings on the blast,=20

And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;      And the eyes of the =
sleepers waxed deadly=20

and chill,      And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still.  =
     And there lay the steed,=20

with his nostrils all wide,      But through them there rolled not the brea=
th of his pride;      And the=20

foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,      And cold as the spray of th=
e rock-beating surf.=E2=80=9D  The=20

horrors of the plague are beyond description. The panic consequent upon the=
 appearance of=20

Yellow Jack in the South gives but a faint idea of it. And this very panic =
was a most--we had=20

almost said the most--powerful factor in the augmentation of the plague=E2=
=80=99s fatality. It is also the=20

case with cholera that a disturbed condition of the mind is fatal in the mi=
ldest form of the disease.=20

Some one has thus embodied the case, though of course with exaggeration: A =
traveler leaving=20

Bagdad met Cholera entering. =E2=80=9CFor what are you come?=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=9CTo slay 10,000 people.=E2=80=9D Each went his=20

way. On returning, the traveler met Cholera once more. =E2=80=9CBut you kil=

roceedings in regard to=20

ommission. [14]  In=20

October, 1820, was created the office of general intendant of army killed t=

this panic took a terrible form; as when during a season of plague in Germa=

Jews were murdered,=20

tortured, and burned by the hundreds;=20

conferred upon Colonel Luis Urrjola, with a salary of 5,000 pesos. In May, =
1821, the Constitution=20

of 1812 was again proclaimed in Filipinas, only to be again abrogated in 18=
24, as a result of=20

Fernando VII's triumph (with French aid) over the Liberal party in Spain. "=
