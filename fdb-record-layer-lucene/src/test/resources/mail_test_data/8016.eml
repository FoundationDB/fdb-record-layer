Noah's wife, and his son Canaan: but Shem and Ham and Japheth and their three wives he 

took_), and those who have believed; but there believed not with him save a few: _they were six 

men and their wives: and it is said that all who were in the ark were eighty, half of whom were men 

and half women_. And _Noah_ said, Embark ye therein. In the name of God [be] its course and its 

mooring.[199] Verily my Lord is very forgiving [and] merciful.--And it moved along with them amid 

waves like mountains; and Noah called unto his son, _Canaan_, who was apart _from the ark_, O 

my child, embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers! He replied, I will betake me to a 

mountain which will secure me from the water. [Noah] said, There is nought that will secure to-day 

from the decree of God [any] but him on whom He hath mercy. And the waves intervened between 

them; so he became [one] of the drowned. And it was said, O earth, swallow up thy water 

(_whereupon it drank it up, except what had descended from heaven, which became rivers and 

seas_), and, O heaven, cease _from raining_;--and the water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, 

and it (_namely, the ark_) rested on El-Joodee (_a mountain of El-Jezeereh, near El-Mosil_); and 

it was said, Perdition to the offending people![200]     (xi. 38-46.)   And Noah called upon his Lord, 

and said, O my Lord, verily my son is of my family, _and Thou hast promised me to save them_, 

and verily Thy promise is true, and Thou art the most just of those who exercise judgment. _God_ 

replied, O Noah, verily he is not of thy family _who should be saved, or of the people of thy 

religion_. Verily it (_namely, thine asking me to save him_) is not a righteous act; _for he was an 

unbeliever, and there is no safety for the unbelievers_; therefore ask not of me that wherein thou 

modern shopgirl finds done for her as a matter of course.  She must know how to make bread, 

without question. In the romance of King Florus a faithful wife disguises herself as a page and 

accompanies her husband without his recognizing her. They fall upon evil days, and the wife-page 

earns a living for herself and her master by starting a bakery and eventually an inn. The lady of the 

manor must not only know how to make the greater part of the clothing that she wears, but must 

know how to weave the cloth of which her gown is made, and to spin the yarn from which cloth 

and thread alike must come, and to card the wool or prepare the flax before that. If soap be 

considered necessary,--and there seems to have been no excessive use of it,--it would be wise for 

her to know how to make it, since there might be no place near by where soap could be bought. 

Candles, too, of a rude sort, or some sort of rushlight, for domestic use, it would be well to know 

how to make; and, of course, she should know how to make cheeses and to cure meats for use 

during the long months when fresh meats might not be had. Even on the tables of the rich, salt 

meats were the staple article. Unable to provide for the feeding of large flocks through the winter--

forage was scarce, root crops were little cultivated for stock, and the omnipotent potato had not yet 

come to its own,--the lord's steward would have a large number of animals slaughtered just at the 

beginning of winter, and the flesh of these had to be salted down. The good housewife would, of 

course, know something of the process. Though in large households the management of the male 

servants, the outdoor servants generally, fell to the steward or baillie, the lady even here 

undoubtedly had to give a general supervision, and had to provide work for and maintain

admonish thee, lest thou become [one] of the ignorant.--_Noah_ said, O my Lord, I beg Thee to 

preserve me from asking Thee that wherein I have no knowledge; and if Thou do not forgive me 

and have mercy upon me, I shall be of those who suffer loss.--It was said, O Noah, descend _from 

the ark_,[201] with peace from Us, and blessings, upon thee and upon peoples [that shall proceed] 

from those who are with thee _in the ark_ (_that is, their believing posterity_); but peoples [that 

shall proceed] _from those who are with thee_ We will permit to enjoy _the provisions of this 

world_; then a painful punishment shall befall them from Us, among the women of the household. 

It must have required no small amount of ability and tact, therefore, successfully to be the lady of 

the chateau.  We need not pause here to consider the amusements and the traditional 

occupations of women, such as fine sewing and embroidery, or music and the care of flowers. 

These can best be noticed when we examine the romances of a later age.  For women of the 

upper classes feudalism was not, we may say, entirely unjust or evil in its operations; but as 

feudalism meant oppression verging on slavery for Jacques Bonhomme, the peasant, his wife 

Jeanne could hardly have been in better case. With

brother Hood.[203] He said, O my people, worship God: _assert His unity_. Ye have no other deity 

than Him. Will ye not then fear _Him, and believe_?--The chiefs who disbelieved among his 

people answered, Verily we see thee to be in a seigneur could interfere even more tyrannically 

than with those of his feudal wards. In some places the bride and groom owed to the seigneur 

certain gifts called _mets de manage_. On the day of the wedding these "must be brought to the 

chateau by the bride, accompanied by musicians; the said mets shall consist of a leg of mutton,
