wiped out by a direct hit. He referred to it as though he had just missed h=
is train.  Two days later I=20

went up with the Machine-Gun Officer of the Second Gordons to look at a pie=
ce of ground. To get=20

there we had to crawl on our hands and knees. In one part of our journey we=
 came to a sunken=20

road. The day was fine, so we lay there. He asked me about Canada. He wante=

something about the settler's grant. He said: "Of course you know after a c=
hap has been out here=20

in the open, it will be impossible to go back again to office life." I boos=

the irony of the situation occurred to me. Here we were lying down in a roa=

German lines, so close that it would be suicide to even stand up, and yet h=

discussing the merits of Canadian emigration. I commented on this and he re=
plied: This steatite=20

approaches, in most places, within a foot and a half of the surface, and ap=
pears in small angular=20

loose blocks, wherever the soil has been removed. Its colour is a greenish =
yellow; it is brittle, very=20

adhesive to the tongue, but little unctuous, and probably contains more alu=
mine and less=20

magnesia than steatites in general. Much of it decomposes when exposed to a=
ir and moisture, and=20

forms a good mould, whenever the descent of ground permits an accumulation =
of earth. It is not=20

improbable, that in most places of the Staten-Island hills, when magnesia c=
onstitutes a=20

considerable ingredient of the rock, it will be found saturated with carbon=
ic acid, obviating the=20

objection to common magnesian minerals in agriculture.  The minerals observ=

as long as I have, you will come to realize that being at the front is a pe=
riod of intense boredom=20

punctuated by periods of intense fear, and that if you allow yourself to be=

depression it will be your finish." He had been out since just after Mons. =
 I remembered this and I=20

found that the nonchalant and care-free attitude of the average British off=
