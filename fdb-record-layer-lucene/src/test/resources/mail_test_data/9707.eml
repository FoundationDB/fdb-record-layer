on in cities and towns=20

where they had better educational advantages tended to make colored city sc=
hools self-

supporting. There developed a class of self-educating Negroes who were able=
 to provide for their=20

own enlightenment. This condition, however, did not obtain throughout the S=
outh. Being a=20

proslavery farming section of few large towns and cities, that part of the =
country did not see much=20

development of the self-sufficient class. What enlightenment most urban bla=
cks of the South=20

experienced resulted mainly from private teaching and religious instruction=
. There were some=20

notable exceptions, however. A colored "Santo Dominican" named Julian Troum=
ontaine taught=20

openly in Savannah up to 1829 when such an act was prohibited by law. He ta=
ught clandestinely=20

thereafter, however, until 1844.[1] In New Orleans, where the Creoles and f=
reedmen counted early=20

in the nineteenth century as a substantial element in society, persons of c=
olor had secured to=20

themselves better facilities of education. The people of this city did not =
then regard it as a crime for=20

Negroes to acquire an education, their white instructors felt that they wer=
e not condescending in=20

teaching them, and children of Caucasian blood raised no objection to atten=
ding special and=20

parochial schools accessible to both races. The educational privileges whic=
h the colored people=20

there enjoyed, however, were largely paid for by the progressive freedmen t=
hemselves.[2] Some=20

of them educated their children in France.  [Footnote 1: Wright, _Negro Edu=
cation in Georgia_, p.=20

20.]  [Footnote 2: Many of the mixed breeds of New Orleans were leading bus=
iness men.]=20

Charleston, South Carolina, furnished a good example of a center of unusual=
 activity and rapid=20

strides of self-educating urban Negroes. Driven to the point of doing for t=
hemselves, the free=20

people of color of this city organized in 1810 the "Minor Society" to secur=
e to their orphan children=20

the benefits of education.[1] Bishop Payne, who studied later under Thomas =
Bonneau, attended=20

the school founded by this organization. Other colored schools were doing s=
uccessful work.=20

Enjoying these unusual advantages the Negroes of Charleston were early in t=
he nineteenth=20

century ranked by some as economically and intellectually superior to any o=
ther such persons in=20

the United States. A large portion of the leading mechanics, fashionable ta=
ilors, shoe=20

manufacturers, and mantua-makers were free blacks, who enjoyed "a considera=
tion in the=20

community far more than that enjoyed by any of the colored population in th=
e Northern cities."[2]=20

As such positions required considerable skill and intelligence, these labor=
ers had of necessity=20

acquired a large share of useful knowledge. The favorable circumstances of =
the Negroes in certain=20

liberal southern cities like Charleston were the cause of their return from=
 the North to the South,=20

where they often had a better opportunity for mental as well as economic im=
provement.[3] The=20

Philadelphia to Petersburg, Virginia, during the first decade of the ninete=
enth century, is a case in=20

evidence.[4]  [Footnote 1: Simmons, _Men of Mark_, p. 1078.]  [Footnote 2: =
_Niles Register_, vol.=20

xlix., p. 40.]  [Footnote 3: _Notions of the Americans_, p. 26.]  [Footnote=
 4: Wright, _Views of=20

Society and Manners in America_, p. 73.]  The successful strivings of the r=
ace in the District of=20

Columbia furnish us with striking examples of Negroes making educational pr=
ogress. When two=20

white teachers, Henry Potter and Mrs. Haley, invited black children to stud=
y with their white pupils,=20

the colored people gladly availed themselves of this opportunity.[1] Mrs. M=
aria Billings, the first to=20

establish a real school for Negroes in Georgetown, soon discovered that she=
 had their hearty=20

support. She had pupils from all parts of the District of Columbia, and fro=
m as far as Bladensburg,=20

Maryland. The tuition fee in some of these schools was a little high, but m=
any free blacks of the=20

District of Columbia were sufficiently well established to meet these deman=
ds. The rapid progress=20

made by the Bell and Browning families during this period was of much encou=
ragement to the=20

ambitious colored people, who were laboring to educate their children.[2]  =
[Footnote 1: _Special=20

Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, pp. 195 _et seq._]  [Footnote 2: _Sp=
ecial Report of the=20

U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 195.]  The city Negroes, however, were learning=
 to do more than=20

merely attend accessible elementary schools. In 1807 George Bell, Nicholas =
Franklin, and Moses=20

Liverpool, former slaves, built the first colored schoolhouse in the Distri=
ct of Columbia. Just=20

emerging from bondage, these men could not teach themselves, but employed a=
 white man to=20

take charge of the school.[1] It was not a success. Pupils of color thereaf=
ter attended the school of=20

Anne Maria Hall, a teacher from Prince George County, Maryland, and those o=
f teachers who=20

instructed white children.[2] The ambitious Negroes of the District of Colu=
mbia, however, were not=20

discouraged by the first failure to provide their own educational facilitie=
s. The Bell School which=20

had been closed and used as a dwelling, opened again in 1818 under the ausp=
ices of an=20

association of free people of color of the city of Washington called the "R=
esolute Beneficial=20

Society." The school was declared open then "for the reception of free peop=
le of color and others=20

that ladies and gentlemen may think proper to send to be instructed in read=
ing, writing, arithmetic,=20

English grammar, or other branches of education apposite to their capacitie=
s, by steady, active=20

and experienced teachers, whose attention is wholly devoted to the purpose =
described." The=20

founders presumed that free colored families would embrace the advantages t=
hus presented to=20

them either by subscription to the funds of the Society or by sending their=
 children to the school.=20

Since the improvement of the intellect and the morals of the colored youth =
were the objects of the=20

institution, the patronage of benevolent ladies and gentlemen was solicited=
. They declared, too,=20

that "to avoid disagreeable occurrences no writing was to be done by the te=
acher for a slave,=20

neither directly nor indirectly to serve the purpose of a slave on any acco=
unt whatever."[3] This=20

school was continued until 1822 under Mr. Pierpont, of Massachusetts, a rel=
ative of the poet. He=20

was succeeded two years later by John Adams, a shoemaker, who was known as =
the first Negro=20

to teach in the District of Columbia.[4]  [Footnote 1: _Ibid._, 196.]  [Foo=
tnote 2: _Ibid._, 197.]=20

[Footnote 3: _Daily National Intelligencer_, August 29, 1818.]  [Footnote 4=
: _Special Report of the=20

U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 198.]  Of equal importance was the colored semi=
nary established by=20

Henry Smothers, a pupil of Mrs. Billings. Like her, he taught first in Geor=
getown. He began his=20

advanced work near the Treasury building, having an attendance of probably =
one hundred and=20

fifty pupils, generally paying tuition. The fee, however, was not compulsor=
y. Smothers taught for=20



about two years, and then was succeeded by John Prout, a colored man of rar=
e talents, who later=20

did much in opposition to the scheme of transporting Negroes to Africa befo=
re they had the=20

benefits of education.[1] The school was then called the "Columbian Institu=
te." Prout was later=20

assisted by Mrs. Anne Maria Hall.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Ibid._, 1871, p. 199.] =
 [Footnote 2: Other=20

schools of importance were springing up from year to year. As early as 1824=
 Mrs. Mary Wall, a=20

member of the Society of Friends, had opened a school for Negroes and recei=
ved so many=20

applications that many had to be refused. From this school came many well-p=
repared colored=20

men, among whom were James Wormley and John Thomas Johnson. Another school =
was=20

established by Thomas Tabbs, who received "a polished education from the di=
stinguished=20

Maryland family to which he belonged." Mr. Tabbs came to Washington before =
the War of 1812=20

and began teaching those who came to him when he had a schoolhouse, and whe=
n he had none=20

he went from house to house, stopping even under the trees to teach whereve=
r he found pupils=20

who were interested. See _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, pp=
. 212, 213, and 214.]=20

Of this self-educative work of Negroes some of the best was accomplished by=
 colored women.=20

With the assistance of Father Vanlomen, the benevolent priest then in charg=
e of the Holy Trinity=20

Church, Maria Becraft, the most capable colored woman in the District of Co=
lumbia at that time,=20

established there the first seminary for the education of colored girls. Sh=
e had begun to teach in a=20

less desirable section, but impressed with the unusual beauty and strong ch=
aracter of this girl,=20

Father Vanlomen had her school transferred to a larger building on Fayette =
Street where she=20

taught until 1831. She then turned over her seminary to girls she had train=
ed, and became a=20

teacher in a convent at Baltimore as a Sister of Providence.[1] Other good =
results were obtained=20

by Louisa Parke Costin, a member of one of the oldest colored families in t=
he District of Columbia.=20

Desiring to diffuse the knowledge she acquired from white teachers in the e=
arly mixed schools of=20

the District, she decided to teach. She opened her school just about the ti=
me that Henry Smothers=20

was making his reputation as an educator. She died in 1831, after years of =
successful work had=20

crowned her efforts. Her task was then taken up by her sister, Martha, who =
had been trained in the=20

Convent Seminary of Baltimore.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Ibid._, p. 204.]  [Footnot=
e 2: _Special Report of=20

the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 203.]  Equally helpful was the work of Arab=
ella Jones. Educated at=20

the St. Frances Academy at Baltimore, she was well grounded in the English =
branches and fluent=20

in French. She taught on the "Island," calling her school "The St. Agnes Ac=
ademy."[1] Another=20

worker of this class was Mary Wormley, once a student in the Colored Female=
 Seminary of=20

Philadelphia under Sarah Douglass. This lady began teaching whenever any co=

1830, getting some assistance from Mr. Calvert, an Englishman.[2] The insti=
tution passed later=20

into the hands of Thomas Lee, during the incumbency of whom the school was =
closed by the=20

"Snow Riot." This was an attempt on the part of the white people to get rid=
 of the progressive=20

Negroes of the District of Columbia. Their excuse for such drastic action w=
as that Benjamin Snow,=20

a colored man running a restaurant in the city, had made unbecoming remarks=
 about the wives of=20

the white mechanics.[3] John F. Cook, one of the most influential educators=
 produced in the=20

persons, were on account of this riot closed to the darker race.[2] This ex=
pulsion however, was not=20

an unmixed evil, for the colored people themselves thereafter established a=
nd directed a larger=20

number of institutions of learning.[3]  [Footnote 1: The Catholics admitted=
 the colored people to=20

their churches on equal footing with others when they were driven to the ga=
lleries of the Protestant=20

churches. Furthermore, they continued to admit them to their parochial scho=
ols. The Sisters of=20

Georgetown trained colored girls, and the parochial school of the Aloysius =
Church at one time had=20

as many as two hundred and fifty pupils of color. Many of the first colored=
 teachers of the District=20

of Columbia obtained their education in these schools. See _Special Report =
of U.S. Com. of Ed._,=20

1871, p. 218 _et. seq._]  [Footnote 2: _Sp. Report_, etc. 187, pp. 217, 218=
, 219, 220, 221.]=20

[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, pp. 220-222.]  The colored schools of the District of=
 Columbia soon resumed=20

their growth recovering most of the ground they had lost and exhibiting evi=
dences of more=20

systematic work. These schools ceased to be elementary classes, offering me=
rely courses in=20

reading and writing, but developed into institutions of higher grade suppli=
ed with competent=20

teachers. Among other useful schools then flourishing in this vicinity were=
 those of Alfred H. Parry,=20

Nancy Grant, Benjamin McCoy, John Thomas Johnson, James Enoch Ambush, and D=
r. John H.=20

Fleet.[1] John F. Cook returned from Pennsylvania and reopened his seminary=
.[2] About this time=20

there flourished a school established by Fannie Hampton. After her death th=

Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution=
 of electronic works=20

in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, =
old, middle-aged and=20

new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers =
and donations from=20

people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide v=
olunteers with the=20

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals =
and ensuring that the=20

Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generation=
s to come.  In 2001, the=20

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secu=
re and permanent=20

future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about=
 the Project=20

his assistant teacher. He was a free Negro who had been educated in Savanna=
h, Georgia, while=20

attending school with white and colored children. He founded a successful s=
chool about the time=20

that Fleet and Johnson[3] retired. Middleton's school, however, owes its im=
portance to the fact that=20

it was connected with the movement for free colored public schools started =
by Jesse E. Dow, an=20

official of the city, and supported by Rev. Doctor Wayman, then pastor of t=
he Bethel Church.[4]=20

Other colaborers with these teachers were Alexander Cornish, Richard Stokes=
, and Margaret=20

Hill.[5]  [Footnote 1: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, pp. =
212, 213, and 283.]=20

[Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 200.]  [Footnote 3: Compelled to leave Washington =
in 1838 because of the=20

persecution of free persons of color, Johnson stopped in Pittsburg where he=
 entered a competitive=20

teacher examination with two white aspirants and won the coveted position. =
He taught in Pittsburg=20

several years, worked on the Mississippi a while, returned later to Washing=
ton, and in 1843=20

constructed a building in which he opened another school. It was attended b=
y from 150 to 200=20

students, most of whom belonged to the most prominent colored families of t=
he District of=20

Columbia. See _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 214.]  [Fo=

arge scale. This was the=20

school of Alexander Hays, an emancipated slave of the Fowler family of Mary=
land. Hays=20

succeeded his wife as a teacher. He soon had the support of such prominent =
men as Rev. Doctor=20
