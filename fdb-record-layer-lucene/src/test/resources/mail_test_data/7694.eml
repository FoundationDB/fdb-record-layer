philodendron monstera that were not those of Louise Adet.  At last Yvonne contrived to stand on her feet; but she had to close her eyes and to remain quite still for awhile after THE TRIAL FOR MURDER.

"Dan," said Elspie, as, seated in the summer-house after the arrival of the sportsmen, these two held a meeting, "I have called you back _
"A flower ... drawn in red ... what can it mean?"  And as a vague memory struggled for expression 

in her troubled mind she added half aloud: "Oh! if it should be ...!"  But now suddenly all her fears 

fell away from her. Hope was once more knocking at the gates of her heart--vague memories had 

taken definite shape ... the mysterious letter ... the message of hope ... the red flower ... all were 

gaining significance. She stooped low to read the letter by the feeble light of the flickering candle. 

She read it through with her eyes first--then with her lips in a soft murmur, while her mind gradually 

took in all that it meant for her.       "Keep up your courage. Your friends are inside the city and on 

the      watch. Try the door of your prison every evening at one hour before      midnight. Once you 

will find it yield. Slip out and creep      noiselessly down the stairs. At the bottom a friendly hand will 

be      stretched out for you. Take it with confidence--it will lead you to      safety and to freedom. 

Courage and secrecy."  When she had finished reading, her eyes were swimming in tears. There 

was no longer any doubt in her mind about the message now, for her dear milor had so often 

spoken to her about the brave Scarlet Pimpernel who had risked his precious life many a time ere 

this, in order to render service to the innocent and the oppressed. And now, of a surety, this 

message came from him: from her dear milor and from his gallant chief. There was the small 

device--the the hut to the lake and almost bursting in the door.  "See to the ropes, boys," said old 

Dobelle, glancing uneasily at the roof.  The young men arose, went out, regardless of weather, 

and secured with additional care a couple of stout ropes with which the tendency of the roof to fly 

away was restrained.  "Did it ever come off?" asked Archie with some curiosity, as the young men 

returned and resumed their pipes.  "Yes--twice, and both times it was night," answered Madame 

Dobelle, "and we were flooded out and had to camp under the trees."  "Which was not 

comfortable," added the old man.  Another clap of thunder seemed to corroborate what he said, 

and a blast of wind followed, which caused the whole fabric of the hut to shudder.  Jenkins looked 

inquiringly at the roof.  "No fear of it," said old Dobelle; "the ropes are strong."  Thus assured, the 

visitors continued their meal with equanimity, regardless of the storm that soon began to rage with 

great fury, insomuch that the door required a prop to keep it up and rain began to trickle in through 

crevices in the roof and drop here and there upon the party.  When one such drop chanced to fall 

on old Dobelle's nose, his younger son arose, and, fastening a piece of birch-bark to the rafters, 

caught the drop and trained it with its followers to flow towards an unoccupied place in one corner, 

which, being accidentally lower than the rest of the floor, formed a convenient receptacle for 

superfluous water.  At the same time Madame

brought hope to despairing hearts. And it was more than hope that it brought to Yvonne. It brought 

certitude and happiness, and a sweet, tender remorse that she should ever have doubted. She 

ought to have known all along that everything would be for the best: she had no right ever to have 

given way to despair. In her heart she prayed for forgiveness from her dear absent milor.  How 

could she ever doubt him? Was it likely that he would abandon her?--he and that brave friend of 

his whose powers were indeed magical. Why! she ought to have done her best to keep up her 

physical as well as her mental faculties--who knows? But perhaps physical strength might be of 

inestimable value both to herself and to her gallant rescuers presently.  She took up the stale 

brown bread and ate it resolutely. She drank some water and then stamped round the room to get 

some warmth into her limbs.  A distant clock had struck ten awhile ago--and if possible she ought 

to get an hour's rest before the time came for her to be strong and to act: so she shook up her 

meagre straw paillasse and lay down, determined if possible to get a little sleep--for indeed she 

felt that that was just what her dear milor would have wished her to do.  Thus time went by--

waking or dreaming, Yvonne could never afterwards have said in what state she waited during that 

one long hour which separated her from the great, blissful moment. The bit of candle burnt low 

and presently died out. After that Yvonne remained quite another corner for her visitors, for it was 

obvious that they would have to spend the night there, even although their own tent was not far-

distant.  By that time the storm was raging with unwonted violence.  Nevertheless the Dobelle 

family smoked on in placid contentment.  When the time for repose arrived, Madame Dobelle and 

her eldest girl retired to a box-bed in a corner of the hut which was screened off--not very 

effectually--by a curtain of birch-bark.  The two brothers lay down in another corner. The three 

visitors disposed themselves in the third, and, as the fourth was monopolised by the rain-rivulet, 

old Dobelle lay down on one side of the fire in the centre of the room, while the four-year-old girl 

reposed on the other.  During the night the accumulation of tobacco-smoke with fire-smoke 

produced a suffocating effect, but no one was capable of suffocation apparently, for they all 

smoked on--except Archie, who, as we have said, had not acquired the habit.  Even the four-year-

old girl, like Baby La Certe, had a pull now and then at its father's pipe, and, from sundry white 

emanations from the crevices in the bark curtains, it was evident that the ladies behind these were 

enjoying themselves in the same way during the intervals of repose.  Next morning was fine, and 

the three sportsmen returned to the fishery to find that the storm had made an almost clean sweep 

of the nets.  It had carried most of them away; torn others to pieces, and almost ruined the whole 


_
the straw, in total darkness: no light came in through the tiny window, only the cold north-westerly 

wind blew in in gusts. But of a surety the prisoner who was within sight of freedom felt neither cold 

nor fatigue now.  The tower-clock in the distance struck the quarters with most of the nets had 

been received on credit, and were to be paid for chiefly by the results of the autumn fishery.  La 

Certe was one of the chief sufferers; nevertheless, to judge from his looks, La Certe did not suffer 

much!  He had brought a considerable amount of provision

monotony.   III  The last stroke of eleven ceased to vibrate through the stillness of the winter's 

night.  Yvonne roused herself from the torpor-like state into which she had fallen. She tried to 

struggle to her feet, but intensity of excitement had caused a strange numbness to invade her 

limbs. She could hardly move. A second or two ago it had seemed to her that she heard a gentle 

scraping noise at the door--a drawing of bolts--the grating of a key in the lock--then again, soft, 

shuffling footsteps that came and went and his nets had been washed ashore, he proceeded very 

leisurely to mend it, while he smoked and assisted Slowfoot to consume pemmican and tea. 

About this time a mysterious message was sent to Dan Davidson from Red River by an Indian, 

requiring his immediate return.  The sender of the message was Elspie McKay; the summons was 

therefore obeyed at once.  As nothing further could be done at the fishery that autumn, the other 

members of the expedition, and most of the fishers, returned with Dan to the colony.    CHAPTER 

THIRTY.
