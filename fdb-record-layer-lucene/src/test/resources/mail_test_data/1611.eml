  [Illustration: RUINS NEAR NINEVEH.]  This record, which is but a partial =
one, is enough to explain the dracaena marginata capital to undertake these=
 works, with concessions, privileges, and protection which shall be adequat=
e to enlist their energies; this would lead to the development of the natur=
al riches of the islands, the population would be increased by skilled arti=
sans and mechanics, and the great increase thus obtained severe earthquakes=
 have followed during the century. In one, we are told the force of the sho=
cks was so peculiar and powerful that in some places stone walls were conve=
rted to heaps of dust or lime.  [Illustration: RUINS NEAR NINEVEH.]  This r=
ecord, which is but a partial one, is enough to explain the _
islands have been neglected, although they are (especially the pirate marin=
es) so important in=20

checking the Moro pirates. The commanders are "men of no force, arbitrarily=
 chosen by the=20

governor there, from the class of merchants and private citizens of Manila,=
 who possess only=20

honorary titles, without any military instruction or love for the military =
career." The militia forces do=20

not cost the government much, but they are of very little use. Bernaldez th=
inks that the pirate=20

marines ought to be regarded as a part of the regular army, with the same p=
ay, and with European=20

officers. The cavalry corps of Luzon is untrained, and would be of little u=
se in an invasion of the=20

country; it ought to be replaced by light and irregular cavalry, and supple=
mented by a small body=20

of veterans. Two squadrons in the corps of dragoons of Luzon would be suffi=
cient to preserve=20

order in Manila, and the third ought to be abolished as unnecessary.]    Of=
 the artillery and its=20

dependent branches  [The artillery corps is in better condition than any ot=
her part of the military=20

force of the islands; it is under better discipline, and has always been un=
der European officers.=20

The Indians are in great terror of the cannon. When in the tumult of 1820 F=
olgueras ordered three=20

pieces to be planted at various points outside the walls, the natives implo=
red him to take the=20

cannon away, as the inhabitants were so terrified that they did not dare to=
 cross the streets; and in=20

the disturbances of 1809 in Ilocos, "only one four-libra cannon, fired by a=
 revenue-clerk, the ball=20

from which hit a church-tower, was sufficient to curb and disconcert more t=
han 10,000 insurgents."=20

To this corps might be added (but as footmen) the company which should be d=
isbanded in the=20

cavalry, since in so rough and broken a country as Luzon horsemen are of li=
ttle use. The artillery=20

in Manila is of wretched quality: almost all of it was cast there, at vario=
us periods, and by unskilled=20

founders; not only the guns but their carriages are irregular, clumsy, unre=
liable, and are difficult to=20

manage; and for these very reasons the foundry there has been abolished, bu=
t since that time no=20

cannon save a small siege battery has been sent ever before. The first quar=
ter of the sixth century=20

was past. The time of the great festival of the Ascension was at hand, A. D=
. 526. From all the=20

country round came people flocking to the celebration, to witness the pagea=
ntry and procession.=20

Without a moment=E2=80=99s warning, a great earthquake came, as fearful as =
the shock four hundred and=20

eleven years before. The destruction was vastly greater. The tottering wall=
s crushed thousands in=20

the crowded streets. Every avenue and alley became a death-trap. There is n=
ot, in all the pages of=20

history, record of an earthquake of greater destructiveness. Gibbon estimat=
es the number of=20

victims at two hundred and fifty thousand.  [Illustration: MASSIVE ARCHITEC=
TURE WRECKED,=20

ASIA MINOR.]  Nor was Antioch the only sufferer. The number of victims at o=
ther points in Asia=20

Minor might be fifty thousand more. The whole sixth century is noted for th=
e unusual number of=20

appalling disasters of this sort which occurred at different places in the =
then known world.=20

Probably a million people perished during this period in earthquakes alone.=
 Such unwonted havoc=20

may well cause us to wonder what manner of convulsions were occurring in th=
e great volcanic=20

regions of the Pacific and the then unknown western world. If the same gene=
ral rule prevailed then=20

that has been noticeable in more recent periods; if great convulsions were =
then, as now,=20

comparatively synchronous, it would be difficult to form any adequate idea =
of the magnitude of the=20

disturbances.  In 742 there was a tremendous earthquake in Egypt and Arabia=
, which overturned=20

scores of cities and villages, rent mountains asunder, buried people in the=
 wrecks of their=20

dwellings, tossed the sea to and fro, swallowed up towns, wiped out thrivin=
g seaports, and=20

numbered its dead by many tens of thousands. Four years later Jerusalem and=
 all Syria=20



experienced a dreadful shock, which made terrible havoc. In 823, Central Eu=
rope was shaken and=20

Aix-la-chapelle nearly destroyed. In 860 Persia and Syria were again shaken=
; and in 867, Antioch,=20

after its three centuries of comparative rest, was again ravaged by the des=
troyer. This shock=20

extended to Mecca, which was fearfully rent. Part of a mountain in Syria wa=
s=20


_
thither from Europe. The artillery cast in Manila is sufficiently good to p=
rovide for the defense of the=20

provinces against the Moros; but measures should be taken to provide for th=
e better defense of=20

that city. The working of iron and the making of artillery are almost entir=
ely in the hands of the=20

Chinese of Manila, [143] and the Indians therefore are unskilled in this in=
dustry; some skilled=20

convulsion in far distant India, wherein no less than one hundred and eight=
y thousand people were=20

killed. Western Syria suffered again in 1169 and 1202. All the cities of th=
e Mediterranean coast=20

were shaken to pieces, with the usual terrible loss of life. The valleys of=
 the Lebanon district were=20

upheaved and altered throughout their whole extent.  [Illustration: RUINS N=

The country abounds=20

in rich mines of iron, but these have been barely scratched and then abando=
ned; only some=20

common utensils are made there, and other iron articles are sold to the peo=
ple at high prices by=20

foreigners, who carry great sums of money out of the country. "The iron of =
Manila has been=20

examined in the artillery workshops, and has been found to be very soft and=
 fibrous." Attempts=20

have been made by the Spanish government to utilize the mines and introduce=
 machinery into=20

their operation; but the officials entrusted with these enterprises have be=
en ineffective, caring only=20

to draw forty thousand persons at Bagdad alone. In 1759, the long list of c=
atastrophes in Asia=20

Minor was increased by one of the most terrible on record. At the first sho=
ck the proud Antioch=20

was once more totally destroyed. Within the next forty-five days Baalbec, S=
idon, Acre, Foussa,=20

Nazareth, Safit, Tripoli, and scores of lesser towns and villages were almo=
st blotted out. The=20

horrors of that period are too awful for description. Even more fearful, if=
 possible, was the=20

earthquake of 1822, which once more made Antioch a shapeless mass of ruins.=
 Aleppo, Djollib,=20

Riha, Gisser, Chugra, Dieskrich, and Armenas shared a like fate. In the who=
