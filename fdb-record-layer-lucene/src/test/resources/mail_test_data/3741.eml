philodendron monstera afternoons."  "If it doesn't rain," said Lorna, eyeing the sky suspiciously.  "Oh, don't be a wet blanket! It's no use courting trouble, honey, as Willy Shakespeare says somewhere. Oh, well, if it the Caspian sea, though the lake of Tacarigua is two hundred and twenty-two toises higher, and the Caspian sea fifty-four toises lower, than the sea; and though it is well known, that fluids find the philodendron monstera afternoons."

season could be treacherous, and those unused to the climate, deceived by its brightness and 

wealth of flowers, were very liable to catch chills and to be laid up with feverish colds as the result 

of their own imprudence. Sometimes indeed a bitter sirocco wind would blow, and bring torrents of 

rain to turn the blue sea and sky to a leaden gray and to blot out the view of Naples and Vesuvius, 

but it seldom lasted more than a few days, and in a land of drought was welcomed to refresh the 

gardens and to fill the cisterns and water-tanks.  It has been mentioned in a previous chapter that 

the Villa Camellia was of necessity run somewhat on convent lines. In Italy young girls do not walk 

about unchaperoned as in England and America, but are always very closely escorted by older 

people, and it was advisable to keep to the customs of the country. The pupils obtained most of 

their exercise inside their own garden. On Sundays they paraded to the British church, but 

otherwise they did not very often go into Fossato. Once a week, if the weather shore ever since

islands may be perceived the most certain traces of the gradual sinking of the waters. But still 

farther (and this accident is regarded by the inhabitants as a marvellous phenomenon) in 1796 

three new islands appeared to the east of the island Caiguira, in the same direction as the islands 

Burro, Otama, and Zorro. These new islands, called by the people Los nuevos Penones, or Los 

Aparecidos,* (* Los Nuevos Penones, the New Rocks. Los Aparecidos, the Unexpectedly-

appeared.) form a kind of banks with surfaces quite flat. They rose, in 1800, more than a foot 

above the mean level of the water.  It has already been observed that the lake of Valencia, like the 

lakes of the valley of Mexico, forms the centre of a little system of rivers, none of which have any 

communication with the ocean. These rivers, most of which deserve only the name of torrents, or 

brooks,* are twelve or fourteen in number. (* The following are their names:

but Irene had been at school for some weeks before this good fortune fell to her lot. One lucky 

Wednesday, however, she found her name and Lorna's written on the list of "exeats" on the 

notice-board, and flew to announce the glad tidings to her chum.  "Twelve of us, with Miss Bickford 

and Miss Rios de Aragua, Turmero, Maracay, Tapatapa, Agnes Calientes, Mariara, Cura, 

Guacara, Guataparo, Valencia, Cano Grande de Cambury, etc.) The inhabitants, little acquainted 

with the effects of evaporation, have long imagined that the lake has a subterranean outlet, by 

which a quantity of water runs

ripping? It says Monte Pellegrino. Where's that? The big hill over there? Oh, great! I love a climb! 

I'm just dancing to go! I feel as if I had been boxed up inside these big walls for years and years. I 

only wish Peachy and Delia had been on the list too."  "But we are!" exclaimed Delia's excited 

voice behind her. "Stella and Marjorie both have colds, so we've swapped places with them, and 

they'll go next time instead. Isn't it fine!"  "I'm tingling right down to my toes," agreed Peachy, her 

jolly little Some suppose that this outlet communicates with grottos, supposed to be at great depth; 

others believe that the water flows through an oblique channel into the basin of the ocean. These 

bold hypotheses on the communication between two neighbouring basins have presented 

themselves in every zone to the imagination of the ignorant, as well as to that of the learned; for 

the latter, without confessing it, sometimes repeat popular opinions in scientific language. We hear 

of subterranean gulfs and outlets in the
