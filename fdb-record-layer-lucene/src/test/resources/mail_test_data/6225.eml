his painting in oils either to contradict or to acquiesce in this verdict; =
but his water-colors produce a very different impression on my mind. He use=

which he attached his flag; the _Niagara_, of twenty guns, in command of El=

two guns each; in all, Perry=E2=80=99s fleet mounted fifty-five guns. The B=
