Better that he were injured in body than in character. For now the people of Ujjayini will say that 

my lord committed this crime because of his poverty. [_She looks up and sighs._] Ah, mighty Fate! 

The destinies of the poor, uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee 

but playthings. There remains to me this one necklace, which I brought with me from my mother's 

house. But my lord would be too proud to accept it. Girl, call Maitreya hither.  P. 95.7] 

_Radanika._ Yes, mistress. [_She approaches Maitreya._] Maitreya, my lady summons you. 

_Maitreya._ Where is she?  _Radanika._ Here. Come!  _Maitreya._ [_Approaching._] Heaven 

bless you!  _Wife._ I salute you, sir. Sir, will you look straight in front of you?  _Maitreya._ Madam, 

here stands a man who looks straight in front of him.  _Wife._ Sir, you must accept this. 

_Maitreya._ Why?  _Wife._ I have observed the Ceremony of the Gems. And on this occasion one 

must make as great a present as one may to a Brahman. This I have not done, therefore pray 

accept this necklace.  _Maitreya._ [_Receiving the necklace._] Heaven bless you! I will go and tell 

my friend.  _Wife._ You must not do it in such a way as to make me blush, Maitreya. 

[_Exit._  _Maitreya._ [_In astonishment._] What generosity!         *       *       *       *       * 

_Charudatta._ How Maitreya lingers! I trust his grief is not leading him to do what he ought not. 

Maitreya, Maitreya!  _Maitreya._ [_Approaching._] Here I am. Take that. [_He displays the 

necklace._]  _Charudatta._ What is this?  _Maitreya._ Why, that is the reward you get for marrying 

such a wife.  _Charudatta._ What! my wife takes pity on me? Alas, now am I poor indeed! 

When fate so robs him of his all,     That on her pity he must call,     The man to woman's state 

doth fall,       The woman is the man.                                      27  But no, I am not poor. For I have a 

wife      Whose love outlasts my wealthy day;       In thee a friend through good and ill;     And truth 

that naught could take away:       Ah! this the poor man lacketh still.                       28  [55.9. S. 

Maitreya, take the necklace and European. Ronsard sent him a pen of gold, and feared at a later 

time the rivalry of his renown; Tasso drew inspiration from his verse; the youthful Milton read him 

with admiration in the rendering by Sylvester; long afterwards Goethe honoured him with praise 

beyond his deserts. To read his poems now, notwithstanding passages of vivid description and 

passages of ardent devotional feeling, would need rare literary fortitude. His originality lies in the 

fact that while he was a disciple of the Pleiade, a disciple crude, intemperate, and provincial, he 

deserted Greece and Rome, and drew his subjects from Hebraic sources. His _Judith_ (1573), 

composed by the command of Jeanne d'Albret, has more of Lucan than of Virgil in its over-

emphatic style. _La Sepmaine, ou la Creation en Sept Journees_, appeared in 1578, and within a 

few years had passed through thirty editions. Du Bartas is always copious, sometimes brilliant, 

sometimes majestic; but laboured and rhetorical description, never ending and still beginning, 

fatigues the mind; an encyclopaedia of the works of creation weighs heavily upon the imagination; 

we sigh for the arrival of the day of rest.  THEODORE-AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE (1550-1630) was 

not among the admirers of Du Bartas. His natural temper was framed for pleasure; at another time 

he might have been known only as a poet of the court, of lighter satire, and of love; the passions of 

the age transformed him into an ardent and uncompromising combatant. His classical culture was 

wide and exact; at ten years old he translated the _Crito_; Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish 

were at his command. He might, had France been at peace with herself, have appeared in 

literature as a somewhat belated Ronsardist; but his hereditary cause became his own. While still 

a child he accepted from his father, in presence of the withering heads of the conspirators of 



Amboise, the oath of immitigable vengeance. Pursuits, escapes, the camp, the battle-field, the 

prison, the court made up no small part of his life of vicissitude and of unalterable resolve. He 

roused Henri of Navarre from the lethargy of pleasure; he warned the King against the crime of 

apostasy; he dreaded the mass, but could

my name that we have gambled away the golden casket, forgetting that it was not our own, that 

we trust she will accept this necklace in its place.  _Maitreya._ But you must not give away this 

necklace, the pride of the four seas, for that cheap thing that was stolen before we had a bite or a 

drink out of it.  _Charudatta._ Not so, my the stake. Extreme in his rage of party, he yet in private 

affairs could show good sense and generosity. His elder years were darkened by what he 

regarded as treason in his King, and by the falling away from the faith of that son who, by an irony 

of fate, became the father of Madame de Maintenon. Four times condemned to death, he died

She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;     The price of confidence has no less measure.

Vardhamanaka, do you speedily      Fill up the opening with the selfsame bricks;       Thus will I 

thwart the process of the exile at the age of eighty.  D'Aubigne's satirical tale, _Les Aventures du 

Baron de Faeneste_, contrasts the man who _appears_--spreading his plumes in the sunshine of 

the court--with the man who _is_, the man who lives upon his estate, among his rustic neighbours, 

tilling his fields and serving his people and his native land. As an elegiac poet
