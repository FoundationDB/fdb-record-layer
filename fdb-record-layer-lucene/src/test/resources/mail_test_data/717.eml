Centenarian   Luke Towns, a centenarian, now residing at 1335 West Eighth Street, Jacksonville, 

Florida, was the ninth child born to Maria and Like Towns, slaves, December 34, 1835, in a village 

in Tolberton County, Georgia.  Mr. Town's parents were owned by Governor Towns, whose name 

was taken by all the children born on the plantation; he states that he was placed on the public 

blocks for sale, and was purchased by a Mr. Mormon. At the marriage of Mr. Mormon's daughter, 

Sarah, according to custom, he was given to this daughter as a wedding present, and thus 

became the slave and took the name of the pronouncing that a man is not at liberty to grow wine 

for himself on land which other people need for food. I fail to see how the principle involved in this 

passage, and others of a similar tendency which I have quoted from Mr. Greg's paper, differ from 

that involved in Gospel texts which, if I were to quote them would grate strangely upon his ear. 

The texts comprise a moral sanction; but Mr. Greg must have some moral sanction when he 

forbids a man to do that which he is permitted to do by law. Christianity, whatever its source and 

authority, was addressed at first to childlike minds, and what its antagonists have to prove is not 

that its forms of expression or even of thought are adapted to such minds, but that its principles, 

when rationally applied to a more advanced state of society, are unsound. Rightly understood it 

does not seem to me to enjoin anything eccentric or spasmodic, to bid you enact primitive 

Orientalism in the streets of London, thrust fraternity upon writers in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, or 

behave generally as if the "Kingdom of God" were already come. Your duty as a Christian is done 

if you help its coming according to the circumstances of your place in society and the age in which 

you live.  Of course, in subscribing to the Christian code of ethics, one lays oneself open to "retorts 

corteous" without limit. But so one does in subscribing to any code, or accepting any standard, 

whether moral or of any other kind.  I do not see on what principle Mr. Greg would justify, if he 

does justify, any sort of charitable benefactions. Did not Mr. Peabody give his glass of champagne 

to a man in need? He might have spent all his money on himself if he had been driven to building 

Chatsworths, and hanging their walls with 


_
young man at Smithville, Georgia, in Lee County.  His chief work was that of carrying water, wood 

and working around the house when a youngster; often, he states he would hide in the woods to 

keep from working.  Because his mother was a child-bearing woman, she did not know the hard 

labors of slavery, but had a small patch of cotton and a garden near the house to care for. "All of 

the others worked hard," said he "but had kind masters who fed them well." When asked if his 

mother were a christian, he replied "why yes: indeed she was, and believed in prayer; one day as 

she traveled from her patch home, just as she was about to let the 'gap' (this was a fence built to 

keep the hogs and horses shut in) down, she knelt to pray and a light appeared before her and 

from that time on she did not believe in any fogyism, but in God."  "I cannot remember much now," 

he says, "of what happened in slavery, but after slavery we went back to the name of Towns. I 

know I got some whippings and during the war my job was that of carrying the master's luggage." 

(1)  After the war he went to Albany, Georgia and began working for himself, hauling salt from 

Albany to Tallahassee, Florida; this salt was sold to the stores. His next job was that of sampling 

cotton.  Just before he was 30 years old he was married to Mary Julia Coats, who lived near 

Albany, Georgia. To them were born the following children: Willie, George, Alexander, Henry 

Hillsman, Ella Louise, and twins--Walter Luke and Mary Julia, who were named for the parents. 

He was converted to the Baptist faith when his first child was born; there were no churches, but 

services were held in the blacksmith shop on the corner of Jackson and State Streets. Later he 

became a member of Mount Zion Baptist Church Albany, Georgia, and served there for 50 years 

as a deacon.  He remained in Georgia until 1899 when he moved to Tampa, Florida and there he 

operated a cafe. He joined Beulah Baptist Church and served as deacon there until he sold his 

business and came to Jacksonville, 1917, to live with his youngest daughter, Mrs. Mary Houston, 

because he was too old to operate a business. In Jacksonville he connected himself with the 

Bethel Baptist Church, and while too old to serve as an active deacon, he was placed on the 

honorary list because of his previous record of church service.  As a relic of pre-freedom days, Mr. 

Towns has a piece of paper money and a one-cent piece which he keeps securely looked in his 

trunk and allows no one to open the trunk; he keeps the key.  Mr. Towns, who will celebrate his 

one-hundred-first birthday, December 24, 1936, is not able to coherently relate incidents of the 

past; he hears but little and that with great difficulty.  He says he has his second eyesight; he 

reads without the use of glasses; until very recently he has been very active in mind and body, 

having registered in the Spring of 1936, signing his own name on the registration books. He has 

almost all of his hair, which is thick, silvery white and of artist length. He has most of his teeth, 

walks without a cane except when painful; dresses himself without assistance.  Mr. Towns rises at 

six o'clock each morning, often earlier. Makes his bed (he has never allowed anyone to make his 

bed for him) and because it is still dark has to lie across the bed to await the breaking of day. His 

health is very good and his appetite strong.  Upon the occasion of his one-hundredth birthday, 

December 24, 1935, his daughter Mrs. Houston gave him a child's party and invited one hundred 

guest; one hundred stockings were made, filled with fruits, nuts and candies and one given each 

guest. A huge cake with one hundred candles adorned the table and during the party, he cut the 

cake. At this party, he showed all the joys and pleasures of a child. His other daughter Mrs. E.L. 

McMillan, of New York City, and son, Mr. George Towns, for years an instructor in Atlanta 

University, Atlanta, Georgia, were present for the occasion.  Mr. Towns has been noted during his 



lifetime for having a remarkable memory and has many times publicly delivered orations from 

many of Shakespeare's works. His memory began failing him in 1936.  He is very well educated 

and now spends most of his time sitting on the porch reading the Bible. (2)   REFERENCES  1.

WILLIS WILLIAMS   Willis Williams of 1025 Iverson Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was born at 

Tallahassee, Florida, September 15, 1856. He was the son of Ransom and Wilhemina Williams, 

who belonged during the period of slavery to Thomas Heyward, a rich merchant of Tallahassee. 

Willis does not know the names of his paternal grandparents but remembers his maternal 

grandmother was Rachel Fitzgiles, who came down to visit the family after the Civil War.  Thomas 

Heyward, the master, owned a plantation out in the country from Tallahassee and kept slaves out 

there; he also owned a fine home in the city as well as a large grocery store and produce house. 

Willis' mother, Wilhemina, was the cook at the town house and his father, Williams, did carpentry 

and other light work around the place. He does not remember how his father learned the trade, but 

presumes that Mr. Heyward put him under a white carpenter until he had learned. The first he 

remembers of his father was that he did carpentry work.  At the time Willis was born and during his 

early life, even rich people like Mr. Heyward did not have cook stoves. They knew nothing of such. 

The only means of cooking was by fireplace, which, as he remembers, was wide with an iron rod 

across it. To the rod a large iron pot was suspended and in it food was cooked. An iron skillet with 

a lid was used for baking and it also was used to cook meats and other food. The common name 

for the utensil was 'spider' and every home had one.  Willis fared well during the first nine years of 

his life which were spent in slavery. To him it was the same as freedom for he was not a victim of 

any unpleasant experiences as related by some other ex-slaves. He played base ball and looked 

after his younger brothers and sister while his mother was in the kitchen. He was never flogged 

but received chastisement once from the father of Mr. Heyward. That, he related, was light and not 

nearly so severe as many parents give their children today.  Wilhemina, his mother, and the cook, 

saw to it that her children were well fed. They were fed right from the master's table, so to speak. 

They did not sit to the table with the master and his family, but ate the same kind of food that was 

served them.  Cornbread was baked in the Heyward kitchen but biscuits also were baked twice 

daily and the Negroes were allowed to eat as many as they wished. The dishes were made of tin 

and the drinking vessels were made from gourds. Few white people had china dishes and when 

they did possess them they were highly prized and great care was taken of them.  The few other 

slaves which Mr. Heyward kept around the town house tended the garden and the many chickens, 

ducks and geese on the place. The garden afforded all of the vegetables necessary for feeding 

Master Heyward, his family and slaves. He did not object to the slaves eating chicken and green 

vegetables and sent provisions of all kinds from his store to boot.  Although Mr. Heyward was 

wealthy there were many things he could not buy for Tallahassee did not afford them. Willis 

remembers that candles were mostly used for light. Home-made tallow was used in making them. 

The moulds, which were made of wood, were of the correct size. Cotton string twisted right from 

the raw cotton was cut into desired length and placed in the moulds first, then heated tallow was 

poured in until they were filled. The tallow was allowed to set and cool, then they were removed, 



ready for use.  In those days coffee was very expensive and a substitute for it was made from 

parched corn. The whites used it as well as the slaves.  Willis remembers a man named Pierce 

who cured cow hides. He used to buy them and one time Willis skinned a cow and took the hide to 

him and sold it. Sixty-five and seventy years ago everyone used horses or mules and they had to 

have shoes. The blacksmith wore leather aprons and the horses and mules wore leather collars. 

No one knew anything about composition leather for making shoes so the tanning of hides was a 

lucrative business.  Clothing, during Civil War days and early Reconstruction, was simple as 

compared to present day togs. Cloth woven from homespun thread was the only kind Negroes 

had. Every house of any note could boast of a spinning wheel and loom. Cotton, picked by slaves, 

was cleared of the seed and spun into thread and woven into cloth by them. It was common to 

know how to spin and weave. Some of the cloth was dyed afterwards with dye made from indigo 

and polk berries. Some was used in its natural color.  Cotton was the main product of most 

southern plantations and the owner usually depended upon the income from the sale of his yearly 

crop to maintain his home and upkeep of his slaves and cattle. It was necessary for every farm to 

yield as much as possible and much energy was directed toward growing and picking large crops. 

Although Mr. Heyward was a successful merchant, he did not lose sight of the fact that his country 

property could yield a bountiful supply of cotton, corn and tobacco.  Around the town house Mr. 

Heyward maintained an atmosphere of home life. He wanted his family and his servants well 

cared for and spared no expense in making life happy.  As Willis remembers the beds were made 

of Florida moss and feathers. Boards ware laid across for slats and the mattress placed upon the 

boards. On top of the moss mattress a feather one was placed which made sleeping very 

comfortable. In summer the feather mattress was often removed, sunned, aired and replaced in 

winter. Goose and the downy feathers of chickens were saved and stored in large bags until 

enough were collected for a mattress and it was considered a prize to possess one.  Every family 

of note boasted the ownership of a horse and buggy or several of each. The kind most popular 

during Willis' boyhood was the one-seated affair with a short wagon-like bed in the rear of the 

seat. Sometimes two seats were used. The seats were removable and could be used for carrying 

baggage or other light weights. The brougham, surrey and landam were unknown to Willis.  Before 

the Civil War and during the time the great struggle was in full swing, women wore hoop skirts, 

very full, held out with metal hoops. Pantaloons were worn beneath them and around the ankle 

where they were gathered very closely, a ruffle edged with a narrow lace, finished them off. The 

waist was tight fitting basque and sleeves which could be worn long or to elbow, were very full. 

Women also wore their hair high up on their heads with frills around the face. Negro women, right 

after slavery, fell into imitating their former mistresses and many of them who were fortunate 

enough to get employment used part of their earnings for at least one good dress. It was usually 

made of woolen a yard wide, or silk.  Money has undergone a change as rapidly as some other 

commonplace things. In Willis' early life, money valued at less than one dollar was made of paper 

just as the dollar, five dollar or ten dollar bills were. There was a difference however, in the paper 

representing 'change' and not as much care was taken in protecting it from being imitated. The 

paper money used for change was called "shin plasters" and much of it flooded the southland 

during Civil War days.  Mr. Heyward did not enlist in the army to help protect the south's demise 

but his eldest son, Charlie, went. His younger son was not old enough to go. Willis stated that Mr. 



Heyward did not go because he was in business and was needed at home to look after it. It is not 

known whether Charlie was killed at war or not, but, Willis said he did not return home at the close 

of war.  When the news of freedom came to Thomas Heyward's town slaves it was brought by 

McCook's Cavalry. Willis remembers the uniforms worn by the northerners was dark blue with 

brass buttons and the Confederates wore gray. After the cavalry reached Tallahassee, they 

separated into sections, each division taking a different part of the town. Negroes of the household 

were called together and were informed of their freedom. It is remembered by Willis that the slaves 

were jubilant but not boastful.  Mr. Heyward was dealt a hard blow during the war; his store was 

confiscated and used as a commissary by the northern army. When the war ended he was 

deprived of his slaves and a great portion of his former wealth vanished with their going.  The loss 

of his wealth and slaves did not bitter Mr. Heyward; to the contrary, he was as kindhearted as in 

days past.  McCook's Cavalry did not remain in Tallahassee very long and was replaced by a 

colored company; the 99th Infantry. Their duty was to maintain order within the town. An orchestra 

was with the outfit and Willis remembers that they were very good musicians. A Negro who had 

been the slave of a man of Tallahassee was a member of the orchestra. His name was Singleton 

and his former master invited the orchestra to come to his house and play for the family. The 

Negroes were glad to render service, went, and after that entertained many white families in their 

homes.  The southern soldiers who returned after the war appeared to receive their defeat as 

good 'sports' and not as much friction between the races existed as would be imagined. The ex-

slave, while he was glad to be free, wanted to be sheltered under the 'wings' of his former master 

and mistress. In most cases they were hired by their former owners and peace reigned around the 

home or plantation. This was true of Tallahassee, if not of other sections of the south.  Soon after 

the smoke of the cannons had died down and people began thinking of the future, the Negroes 

turned their thoughts toward education. They grasped every opportunity to learn to read and write. 

Schools were fostered by northern white capitalists and white women were sent into the southland 

to teach the colored boys and girls to read, write and figure. Any Negro who had been fortunate 

enough to gain some knowledge during slavery could get a position as school teacher. As a result 

many poorly prepared persons entered having done what was criminal and pernicious? And what 

are we to say of the conduct of London plutocrats who abetted his proceedings by their applause 

though they abstained from following his example? Is there any apology for them at all but one 

essentially Christian? Not that Christianity makes any great fuss over munificence, or gives 

political economy reasonable ground for apprehension on that score. Plutocracy deifies Mr. 

Peabody; Christianity measures him and pronounces his millions worth less than the widow's mite. 

In my lecture I have applied my principles, or tried to apply them, fairly to the mechanic as well as 

to the millionaire. I have deprecated, as immoral, a resort to strikes solely in the interest of the 

strikers, without regard to the general interests of industry and of the community at large. What 

has my critic to say, from the moral point of view, to the gas stokers who leave London in the dark, 

or the colliers who, in struggling to raise their own wages, condemn the ironworkers to "clamm" for 

want of coal?  I would venture to suggest that Mr. Greg somewhat overrates in his paper the 

beneficence of luxury as an agent in the advancement of civilization. "Artificial wants," he says, 

"what may be termed extravagant wants, the wish to possess something beyond the bare 

necessaries of existence; the taste for superfluities and luxuries first, the desire for refinements 



and embellishments next; the craving for the higher enjoyments of intellect and art as the final 

stage--these are the sources and stimulants of advancing civilization. It is these desires, these 

needs, which raise mankind above mere animal existence, which, in time and gradually, transform 

the savage into the cultured citizen of intelligence and leisure. Ample food once obtained, he 

begins to long for better, more varied, more succulent food; the richer nutriment leads on to the 

well-stored larder and the well-filled cellar, and culminates in the French cook." The love of truth, 

the love of beauty, the effort to realize a high type of individual character, and a high social ideal, 

surely these are elements of progress distinct from gastronomy, and from that special chain of 

gradual improvement which culminates in the French cook. It may be doubted whether French 

cookery does always denote the acme of civilization. Perhaps in the case of the typical London 

Alderman, it denotes something like the acme of barbarism, for the barbarism of the elaborate and 

expensive glutton surely exceeds that of the child of nature who gorges himself on the flesh which 

he has taken in hunting: not to mention that the child of nature costs humanity nothing, whereas 

the gourmand devours the labour of the French cook and probably that of a good many assistants 

and purveyors.  The greatest service is obviously rendered by any one who can improve human 

food. "The man is what he eats," is a truth though somewhat too broadly stated. But then the 

improvement must be one ultimately if not immediately accessible to mankind in general. That 

which requires a French cook is accessible only to a few.  Again, in setting forth the civilizing 

effects of expenditure, Mr. Greg, I think, rather leaves out of sight those of frugality. The 

Florentines, certainly the leaders of civilization in their day, were frugal in their personal habits, 

and by that frugality accumulated the public wealth which produced Florentine art, and sustained a 

national policy eminently generous and beneficent for its time.  Moreover, in estimating the general 

influence of great fortunes, Mr. Greg seems to take a rather sanguine view of the probable 

character and conduct of their possessors. He admits that a broad-acred peer or opulent 

commoner "may spend his L30,000 a year in such a manner as to be a curse, a reproach, and an 

object of contempt to the community, demoralizing and disgusting all around him, doing no good to 

others, and bringing no real enjoyment to himself." But he appears to think that the normal case, 

and the one which should govern our general views and policy upon the subject, is that of a man 

"of refined taste and intellect expanded to the requirements of his position, managing his property 

with care and judgment, so as to set a feasible example to less wealthy neighbours; prompt to 

discern and to aid useful undertakings, to succour striving merit, unearned suffering, and 

overmatched energy." "Such a man," he says, in a concluding burst of eloquence, "if his 

establishment in horses and servants is not immoderate, although he surrounds himself with all 

that art can offer to render life beautiful and elegant though he gathers round him the best 

productions of the intellect of all countries and ages, though his gardens and his park are models 

of curiosity and beauty, though he lets his ancestral trees rot in their picturesque mutility instead of 

converting them into profitable timber, and disregards the fact that his park would be more 

productive if cut up into potato plots though, in fine he lives in the very height of elegant, refined 

and tasteful luxury--I should hesitate to denounce as consuming on himself the incomes of 

countless labouring families, and I should imagine that he might lead his life of temperate and 

thoughtful joy quietly conscious that his liberal expenditure enabled scores of these families as 

well as artists and others to exist in comfort and without either brain or heart giving way under the 



burdensome reflection."  It must be by a slip of the pen such as naturally occurs amidst the glow of 

an enthusiastic description that the writer speaks of people as enabling others to subsist by their 

expenditure. It is clear that people can furnish subsistence to themselves or others only by 

production. A rich idler may appear to give bread to an artist or opera girl but the bread really 

comes not from the idler but from the workers who pay his rents; the idler is at most the channel of 

distribution. The munificence of monarchs who generously lavish the money of the taxpayer is a 

familiar case of the same fallacy. This is the illusion of the Irish peasant whose respect for the 

spendthrift "gentleman" and contempt for the frugal "sneak" Mr. Greg honours with a place among 

the serious elements of an economical and social problem.  But not to dwell on what is so obvious 

how many let me ask, of the possessors of inherited wealth in England or in any other country, 

fulfil or approach Mr. Greg's ideal? I confess that, as regards the mass of the English squires the 

passage seems to me almost satire. Refined taste and expanded intellect, promptness to discern 

and aid striving merit and unearned suffering, life surrounded with all that art can do to render it 

beautiful and elegant, the best productions of intellect gathered from all intellects and ages--I do 

not deny that Mr. Greg has seen all this, but I can hardly believe that he has seen it often, and I 

suspect that there are probably people not unfamiliar with the abodes of great landowners who 

have never seen it at all. Not to speak of artists and art, what does landed wealth do for popular 

education? It appears from the Popular Education Report of 1861 (p. 77) that in a district taken as 

a fair specimen, the sum of L4,518, contributed by voluntary subscription towards the support of 

168 schools, was derived from the following sources:  169 clergymen contributed L1,782 or L10 10 

0 each 399 landowners    "        2,127 "    5  6 0  " 2l7 occupiers     "          200 "      18 6  " 102 

householders  "          181 "    1 15 6  " 141 other persons "          228 "    1 12 4  "  The rental of the 

399 landowners was estimated at, L650,000 a year. Judging from the result of my own 

observations, I should not have been at all surprised if a further analysis of the return had shown 

that not only the contributions of the clergy but those of retired professional men and others with 

limited incomes were, in proportion, far greater than those of the leviathans of wealth.  To play the 

part of Mr. Greg's ideal millionaire, a man must have not only a large heart but a cultivated mind; 

and how often are educators successful in getting work out of boys or youths who know that they 

have not to make their own bread?  In my lecture I have drawn a strong distinction, though Mr. 

Greg has not observed it, between hereditary wealth and that which, however great, and even, 

compared with the wages of subordinate producers, excessive, is earned by industry. Wealth 

earned by industry is, for obvious reasons, generally much more wisely and beneficially spent than 

hereditary wealth. The self-made millionaire must at all events, have an active mind. The late Mr. 

Brassey was probably one man in a hundred even among self-made millionaires; among 

hereditary millionaires he would have been one in a thousand. Surely we always bestow especial 

praise on one who resists the evil influences of hereditary wealth, and surely our praise is 

deserved.  The good which private wealth has done in the way of patronizing literature and art is, I 

am convinced, greatly overrated. The beneficent patronage of Lorenzo di Medici is, like that of 

Louis XIV., a chronological and moral fallacy. What Lorenzo did was, in effect, to make literature 

and art servile and in some cases to taint them with the propensities of a magnificent debauchee. 

It was not Lorenzo, nor any number of Lorenzos, that made Florence, with her intellect and 

beauty, but the public spirit, the love of the community, the intensity of civic life, in which the 



interest of Florentine history lies. The decree of the Commune for the building of the Cathedral 

directs the architect to make a design "of such noble and extreme magnificence that the industry 

and skill of men shall be able to invent nothing grander or more beautiful," since it had been 

decided in Council that no plan should be accepted "unless the conception was such as to render 

the work worthy of an ambition which had become very great, inasmuch as it resulted from the 

continued desires of a great number of citizens united in one sole will."  I believe, too, that the 

munificence of a community is generally wiser and better directed than that of private benefactors. 

Nothing can be more admirable than the munificence of rich men in the United States. But the 

drawback in the way of personal fancies and crochets is so great that I sometimes doubt whether 

future generations will have reason to thank the present, especially as the reverence of the 

Americans for property is so intense that they would let a dead founder breed any pestilence 

rather than touch the letter of his will.  Politically, no one can have lived in the New World without 

knowing that a society in which wealth is distributed rests on an incomparably safer foundation 

than one in which it is concentrated in the hands of a few. British plutocracy has its cannoneer; but 

if the cannoneer happens to take fancies into his head the "whiff of grapeshot" goes the wrong 

way.  Socially, I do not know whether Mr. Greg has been led to consider the extent to which 

artificial desires, expensive fashions, and conventional necessities created by wealth, interfere 

with freedom of intercourse and general happiness. The _Saturday Review_ says:  "All classes of 

Her Majesty's respectable subjects are always doing their best to keep up appearances, and a 

very hard struggle many of us make of it. Thus a mansion in Belgrave Square ought to mean a 

corpulent hall-porter, a couple of gigantic footmen, a butler and an under-butler at the very least, if 

the owner professes to live op to his social dignities. If our house is in Baker or Wimpole street, we 

must certainly have a manservant in sombre raiment to open our door, with a hobbledehoy or a 

buttons to run his superior's messages. In the smart, although somewhat dismal, small squares in 

South Kensington and the Western suburbs, the parlourmaid must wear the freshest of ribbons 

and trimmest of bows, and be resplendent in starch and clean coloured muslins. So it goes on, as 

we run down the gamut of the social scale; our ostentatious expenditure must be in harmony 

throughout with the stuccoed facade behind which we live, or the staff of domestics we parade. 

We are aware, of course, as our incomes for the most part are limited, and as we are all of us 

upon our mettle in the battle of life that we must pinch somewhere if appearances are to be kept 

up. We do what we can in secret towards balancing the budget. We retrench on our charities, save 

on our coals, screw on our cabs, drink the sourest of Bordeaux instead of more generous 

vintages, dispense with the cream which makes tea palatable, and systematically sacrifice 

substantial comforts that we may swagger successfully in the face of a critical and carping society. 

But with the most of us if our position is an anxious one; it is of our own making and if we dared to 

be eccentrically rational it might be very tolerable."  Nor is this the worst. The worst is the 

exclusion from society of the people who do not choose to torture and degrade themselves in 

order to keep up appearances and who are probably the best people of all. The interference of 

wealth and its exigencies with social enjoyment is I suspect a heavy set off against squirearchical 

patronage of intellect and art.  Those who believe that the distribution of wealth is more favourable 

to happiness and more civilizing than its concentration will of course vote against laws which tend 

to artificial concentration of wealth such as those of primogeniture and entail. This they may do 



without advocating public plunder though it suits plutocratic writers to confound the two. For my 

own part I do not feel bound to pay to British plutocracy a respect which British plutocracy does 

not pay to humanity. Some of its organs are beginning to preach doctrines revolting to a Christian 

and to any man who has not banished from his heart the love of his kind and we have seen it 

when its class passions were excited show a temper as cruel as that of any Maratist or Petroleuse. 

But so far from attacking the institution of property [Footnote: The _Saturday Review_ some time 

ago charged me with proposing to confiscate the increase in the value of land. I never said 

anything of the kind nor anything I believe that could easily be mistaken for it.] I have as great a 

respect for it as any millionaire can have and as sincerely accept and uphold it as the condition of 

our civilization. There is nothing inconsistent with this in the belief that among the better part of the 

race property is being gradually modified by

William Williams, Willis' father, found work at the old Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad yards 

and worked for many years there. He sent his children to school and Willis advanced rapidly. 

During slavery Negroes attended church, sat in the balcony, and very often log churches were 

built for them. Meetings were held under "bush harbors." After the war frame and log churches 

served them as places of worship. These buildings were erected by whites who came into the 

southland to help the ex-slave. Negro men reaches its distant goal property and duty will alike be 

merged in affection.     A TRUE CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY.   The vast works of the railway and 

steamboat age called into existence, besides the race of great engineers, a race of great 

organizers and directors of industry, who may be generally termed Contractor. Among these no 

figure was more conspicuous than that of Mr. Brassey, a life of whom has just been published by 

Messrs. Bell and Daldy. Its author is Mr. Helps, whose name is a guarantee for the worthy

them to preach served as ministers of most of the Negro churches but often white preachers 

visited them and instructed them concerning the Bible and what God wanted them to do. Services 

were conducted three times a day on Sunday, morning at eleven, in afternoon about three and at 

night at eight o'clock.  The manner of worship was very much in keeping with present day modes. 

Preachers appealed to the emotions of the 'flock' and the congregation responded with "amens," 

"halleluia," clapping of hands, shouting and screaming. Willis remarked to one white man during 

his early life, that he wondered why the people yelled so loudly and the man replied that in fifty 

years hence the Negroes would be educated, know better and would not do that. He further 

replied that fifty years ago the white people screamed and shouted that way. Willis wonders now 

when he sees both white and colored people responding to preaching in much the same way as in 

his early life if education has made much difference in many cases.  Much superstition and 

ignorance existed among the Negroes during slavery and early reconstruction. Some wore bags of 

sulphur saying they would keep away disease. Some wore bags of salt and charcoal believing that 

evil spirits would be kept away from them. Others wore a silver coin in their shoes and some made 

holes in the coin, threaded a string through it, attached it to the ankle so that no one could conjure 

them. Some who thought an enemy might sprinkle "goofer dust" around their door steps swept 

very clean around the door step in the evening and allowed no one to come in afterwards.  The 

Negro men who spent much time around the "grannies" during slavery learned much about herbs 

and roots and how they were used to cure all manner of ills, the doctor gave practically the same 

kind of medicine for most ailments. The white doctors at that time had not been schooled to a 

great extent and carried medicine bags around to the sick room which contained pills and a very 

few other kinds of medicines which they had made from herbs and roots. Some of them are used 

to-day but Willis said most of their work. And worthily executed it is, in spite of a little Privy Council 

solemnity in the reflections, and a little "State Paper" in the style. The materials were collected in 

an unusual way--by examining the persons who had acted under Mr. Brassey, or knew him well, 

and taking down their evidence in shorthand. The examination was conducted by Mr. Brassey, 

jun., who prudently declined to write the biography himself, feeling that a son could not speak 

impartially of his father. The result is that we have materials for a portrait, which not only is very 

interesting in itself but, by presenting the image of beneficence in an employer, may help to 

mediate between capital and labour in a time of industrial war.  Mr. Helps had been acquainted 

with Mr. Brassey, and had once received a visit from him on official business of difficulty and 

importance. He expected, he says, to see a hard, stern, soldierly sort of person, accustomed to 

sway armies of working-men in an imperious fashion. Instead of this he saw an elderly gentleman 

of very dignified appearance and singularly graceful manners--"a gentleman of the old school." 

"He stated his case, no, I express myself wrongly; he did _not_ state his case, he _understated_ 

it; and there are few things more attractive in a man than that he should be inclined to understate 

rather than overstate his own case." Mr. Brassey was also very brief, and when he went away, Mr. 

Helps, knowing well the matter in respect to which his visitor had a grievance, thought that, if it had 

been his own case, he should hardly have been able to restrain himself so well, and speak with so 

little regard to self-interest, as Mr. Brassey had done. Of all the persons whom Mr. Helps had 

known, he thought Mr. Brassey most resembled that perfect gentleman and excellent public man, 

Lord Herbert of Lea.  Mr. Helps commences his work with a general portrait. According to this 



portrait, the most striking feature in Mr. Brassey's character was trustfulness, which he carried to 

what might appear an extreme. He chose his agents with care, but, having chosen them, placed 

implicit confidence in

Ten years after the Civil War Willis Williams had advanced in his studies to the extent that he 

passed the government examination and became a railway mail clerk. He ran from Tallahassee to 

Palatka and River Junction on the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad. There was no other 

railroad going into Tallahassee then.  The first Negro railway mail clerk according to Willis' 

knowledge running from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, was Benjamin F. Cox. The results. He was 

very liberal in the conduct of business. His temperament was singularly calm and equable, not to 

be discomposed by success or failure, easily throwing off the burden of care, and, when all had 

been done that could be done, awaiting the result with perfect equanimity. He was very delicate in 

blaming, his censure being always of the gentlest kind, evidently reluctant, and on that account 

going more to the heart. His generosity made him

remarks, what Napoleon called "two o'clock in the morning courage," being always ready, if called 

up in the middle of the night, to meet any urgent peril; and his faculties were stimulated, not 

overcome, by danger. He had a perfect hatred of contention, and would not only refuse to take any 

questionable advantage, but would rather even submit to be taken advantage of--a generosity 

which turned to his account. In the execution of any undertaking, his anxiety was that the work 

should be done quickly and done well. Minor questions, unprovided for by specific contract, he left

Florida, was born a Negro, Claude Augusta Wilson, of slave parents. His master Tom Dexter was 

very kind to his slaves, and was said to have been a Yankee. His wife Mary Ann Dexter, a 

southerner, was the direct opposite, she was very mean. Claude was eight years old when 

Emancipation came.  The Dexter plantation was quite a large place, covering 100 or more acres. 

There were about 100 slaves, including children. They had regular one room quarters built of logs 

which was quite insignificant in comparison with the palatial Dexter mansion. The slaves would 

arise early each morning, being awakened by a "driver" who was a white man, and by "sun-up" 

would be at their respective tasks in the fields. All day they worked, stopping at noon to get a bite 

to eat, which they carried on the fields from their cabins.  At "sun-down" they would quit work and 

return to their cabins, prepare their meals and gossip from cabin to cabin. Finally retiring to await 

the dawn of a new day which signalled a return to their routine duties. At Sundays they would 

gather at a poorly constructed frame building which was known as the "Meeting House," In this 

building they would give praise and thanks to their God. The rest of the day was spent in 

relaxation as this was the only day of the week in which they were not forced to work.  Claude 

Augusta worked in the fields, his mother and sister worked in the Dexter mansion. Their duties 

were general house work, cooking and sewing. His Mother was very rebellious toward her duties 

and constantly It was in Spain, about the Mataro line, and into this he was drawn by his partner 

against his will. He declared that he would never have another, "for in nineteen cases out of 

twenty you either gain nothing at all, or what you do gain does not compensate you for the worry 

and anxiety the lawsuit occasions you." In case of disputes between his agents and the engineers, 

he quietly settled the question by reference to the "gangers."  In order to find the key to Mr. 

Brassey's character, his biographer took care to ascertain what was his "ruling passion." He had 

none of the ordinary ambitions for rank, title, or social position. "His great ambition--his ruling 

passion--was to win a high reputation for skill, integrity, and success in the difficult vocation of a 

contractor for public works; to give large employment to his fellow-countrymen; by means of British 

labour and British skill to knit together foreign countries; and to promote civilization, according to 

his view of it, throughout the world." "Mr. Brassey," continues Mr. Helps, "was, in brief, a singularly 

trustful, generous, large-hearted, dexterous, ruling kind of personage; blessed with a felicitous 

temperament for bearing the responsibility of great affairs." In the military age he might have been 

a great soldier, a Turenne or a Marlborough, if he could have broken through the aristocratic 

barrier which confined high command to the privileged few; in the industrial age he found a more 

beneficent road to distinction, and one not limited to the members

harrassed the "Missus" about letting her work in the fields with her husband until finally she was 

permitted to make the change from the house to the fields to be near her man.  The "missus" 

taught Claude's sister to sew and to the present day most of her female descendants have some 

ability in dress making.  The mansion was furnished with the latest furniture of the tine, but the 

slave quarters had only the cheapest and barest necessities. His mother had no stove but cooked 

in the fire place using a skillet and spider (skillet, a small metal vessel with handle used for 

cooking; spider, a kind of frying pan, Winston's Simplified Dictionary,  Mr. Brassey's family is 

stated by his biographer to have come over with the Conqueror. If Mr. Brassey attached any 

importance to his pedigree (of which there is no appearance) it is to be hoped that he was able to 

make it out more clearly than most of those who claim descent from companions of the 

Conqueror. Long after the Conquest--so long, indeed, as England and Normandy remained united 

under one crown--there was a constant flow of Norman immigration into England, and England 

swarms with people bearing Norman or French names, whose ancestors were perfectly guiltless 

of the bloodshed of Hastings, and made their entrance into the country as

around them, more coals being pulled about until the food was cooked as desired. Corn bread, 

beans, sweet potatoes (Irish potatoes being unknown) and collard greens were the principal foods 

eaten. Corn bread was made as it is today, only cooked differently. The corn meal after being 

mixed was wrapped in humbler capacities. What is certain is that the great contractor sprang from 

a line of those small landed proprietors, once the pillars of England's strength, virtue and freedom, 

who, in the old country have been "improved off the face of the earth" by the great landowners, 

while they live again on the happier side of the Atlantic. A sound morality, freedom from luxury, 

and a moderate degree of culture,
