C.  The of the chambers, formed one group behind the housekeeper, a grave a=
nd distinguished-looking female, who courtesied like the old court; half a =
dozen powdered gentlemen, glowing, in crimson _
his strong muscles, which had been so long cramped in the cage, and shuffle=
d up the side of the=20

mountain at his best pace.  Through thickets and brambles he crashed with a=
 wild exultation; up=20

precipitate crags he labored with feverish excitement and frenzy that grew =
with each moment. He=20

sniffed at the rustling fronds and mosses as he passed, with wild delight. =
 How fresh, how new,=20

how satisfying the wilderness was!  Now racing through deep gulches, and no=
w scrambling up=20

steep bluffs with sheer delight of motion, he fled.  At last the moon set a=
nd the stars faded and=20

from the heart of the Cumberland Mountains, near the top of one of its most=
 jagged and=20

unfrequented spurs, Black Bruin beheld his first sunrise in southern skies.=
  Slowly the east=20

warmed and glowed until at last the golden disk mounted over the top of a t=
win peak and gilded=20

the mountain upon which Black Bruin stood with a flood of golden sunlight. =
 Birds began to twitter=20

strange songs in the tree-tops and thickets and the high peak sang for joy =
at the sun's coming.  At=20

this auspicious moment, Black Bruin reared upon his hind legs and placing h=
is forepaws high upon=20

the trunk of a sentinel pine, raked a deep scar in the bark.  This was his =
hall-mark;--the sign by=20

which he took possession of the mountain and the surrounding lowlands, just=
 as the discoverers=20

did of old.  This land was to be his, where he would dwell and seek his mea=

be of the time of the Romans.  It was not without emotion that Lothair behe=
ld the chief seat of his=20

race. It was not the first time he had visited it. He had a clear and painf=
ul recollection of a brief,=20

hurried, unkind glimpse caught of it in his very earliest boyhood. His uncl=
e had taken him there by=20

some inconvenient cross-railroad, to avail themselves of which they had ris=
en in the dark on a=20

March morning, and in an east wind. When they arrived at their station they=
 had hired an open fly=20

drawn by a single horse, and, when they had thus at last reached the uninha=
bited Towers, they=20

entered by the offices, where Lothair was placed in the steward=E2=80=99s r=
oom, by a smoky fire, given=20

ided he did not go out=20

of sight of the castle, while his uncle and the steward mounted their horse=
s and rode over the=20

estate; leaving Lothair for hours without companions, and returning just in=
 time, in a shivering=20

twilight, to clutch him up, as it were, by the nape of the neck, twist him =
back again into the one-

horse fly, and regain the railroad; his uncle praising himself the whole ti=
me for the satisfactory and=20

business-like manner in which he had planned and completed the edition.  Wh=
at a contrast to=20

present circumstances! Although Lothair had wished, and thought he had secu=
red, that his arrival=20

at Muriel should be quite private, and even unknown, and that all ceremonie=
s and celebrations=20

should be postponed for a few days, during which he hoped to become a littl=
e more familiar with=20

his home, the secret could not be kept, and the county would not tolerate t=
his reserve. He was met=20

at the station by five hundred horsemen, all well mounted, and some of them=
 gentlemen of high=20

degree, who insisted upon accompanying him to his gates. His carriage passe=
