Jacob, only three of whom Gilbert remembers--Gettie, Rena, and Annis. Two of these children 

were sent to school while the others were obliged to work on the plantation. Emily, the mother, 

was the cook and washwoman while Jacob was the Butler.  Gilbert, a good sized lad when slavery 

was at its height, recalls vividly the cruel lashings and other punishments meted out to those who 

disobeyed their master or attempted to run away. It was the custom of slaves who wished to go 

from one plantation to another to carry passes in case they were stopped as suspected runaways. 

Frequently slaves would visit without benefit of passes, and as result they suffered severe 

torturing. Often the sons of the slaves' owners would go "nigger hunting" and nothing--not even 

murder was too horrible for before the most adventurous barque, limiting the possibilities of 

discovery, disenchanting the enchanted Seas, and depriving us for ever of Sinbad and Ulysses. 

But the Phoenician and the Northman put forth into a really unknown world. The Northman, 

moreover, was so far as we know the first ocean sailor. If the story of the circumnavigation of 

Africa by the Phoenicians is true, it was an astonishing enterprise, and almost dwarfs modern 

voyages of discovery. Still it would be a coasting voyage, and the Phoenician seems generally to 

have hugged the land. But the Northman put freely out into the wild Atlantic, and even crossed it 

before Columbus, if we may believe a legend made specially dear to the Americans by the craving 

of a new country for antiquities. It has been truly said,
