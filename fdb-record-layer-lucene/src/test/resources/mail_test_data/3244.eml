CHAPTER VII  Ah! he'd got it!  He'd go to the river; all by himself he'd go=
, and not tell anybody.=20

He'd look over the bridge into that cool deep pool and perhaps that big fat=
 trout would be=20

swimming about. What was it he had heard Captain Middleton say last time he=
 was down at=20

Amber Guiting? "The Mayfly was up."  He had seemed quite delighted about it=
, therefore it must=20

mean something pleasant.  After all, on a soft, not too sunny morning in ea=
rly June, with a west=20

wind rustling the leaves in the hedges, the world was not such a bad place;=
 for even if there were=20

rather too many women in it, there were dogs and rivers and country roads w=
here adventurous=20

boys could see life for themselves.  William agreed with Tony in his dislik=
e of Monday mornings.=20

He went and lay on the front door mat so that he was more than ready to acc=
ompany anyone who=20

happened to be going out.  By the time they reached the bridge all sense of=
 injury had vanished,=20

and buoyant expectation had taken its place.  Three men were fishing. One w=
as far in the=20

distance, one about three hundred yards up stream, and one Tony recognised =
as Mr. Dauncey,=20

landlord of "The Full Basket," the square white house standing in its neat =
garden just on the other=20

side of the bridge. The fourth gentleman, who had forgotten his hat, and wa=
s clad in a holland=20

smock, sandals, and no stockings, leaned over luxuriously, with his elbows =
on the low wall and his=20

bare legs thrust out. He was very still, even trying not to twitch when Wil=
liam licked his bare legs,=20

as he did at intervals just to show he was there on guard.  There had been =
heavy rain in the night=20

and the water was discoloured. Nobody noticed Tony, and for about an hour n=
othing happened.=20

Then Mr. Dauncey got a rise. The rigid little figure on the bridge leaned f=
urther over as Mr.=20

Dauncey's reel screamed and he followed his cast down stream.  Presently, w=
ith a sense of=20

irritation, Tony was aware of footsteps coming over the bridge. He felt tha=
t he simply could not=20

bear it just then if anyone leaned over beside him and talked. The footstep=
s came up behind him=20

and passed; and William, who was lying between Tony's legs and the wall, sq=
ueezed as close to=20

him as possible, gave a low growl.  "Hush, William, naughty dog!" Tony whis=
pered crossly.=20

William hushed, and drooped as he always did when rebuked.  It occurred to =
Tony to look after=20

this amazing person who could cross a bridge without stopping to look over =
when a reel was=20

joyfully proclaiming that some fisherman was having luck.  It was a man, an=
d he walked as though=20

he were footsore and tired. There was something dejected and shabby in his =
appearance, and his=20

clothes looked odd somehow in Amber Guiting. Tony stared after the stranger=
, and gradually he=20

realised that there was something familiar in the back of the tall figure t=
hat walked so slowly and=20

yet seemed trying to walk fast.  The man had a stick and evidently leant up=
on it as he went. He=20

wore an overcoat and carried nothing in his hand.  Mr. Dauncey's reel chuck=
led and one of the=20



other anglers ran towards him with a landing-net.  But Tony still stared af=
ter the man. Presently,=20

with a deep sigh, he started to follow him.  Just once he turned, in time t=
o see that Mr. Dauncey=20

had landed his trout.  The sun came out from behind the clouds. "The Full B=
asket," the river,=20

brown and rippled, the bridge, the two men talking eagerly on the bank belo=
w, the muddy road=20

growing cream-coloured in patches as it dried, were all photographed upon T=
ony's mind. When he=20

started to follow the stranger he was out of sight, but now Tony trotted st=
eadily forward and did not=20

look round again.  William was glad. He had been lying in a puddle, and, li=
ke little Fay, he=20

preferred "a dly place."  Meanwhile, at Wren's End the washing had taken a =
long time to count and=20

to divide. There seemed a positively endless number of little smocks and fr=
ocks and petticoats and=20

pinafores, and Meg wanted to keep them all for Mrs. Mumford to wash, declar=
ing that she (Meg)=20

could starch and iron them beautifully. This was quite true. She could iron=
 very well, as she did=20

everything she undertook to do. But Jan knew that it tired her dreadfully, =
that the heat and the=20

wielding of the heavy iron were very bad for her, and after much argument a=
nd many insulting=20

remarks from Meg as to Jan's obstinacy and extravagance generally, the thin=
gs were divided. Meg=20

put on little Fay's hat and swept her out into the garden; whereupon Jan pl=
unged into Mrs.=20

Mumford's heap, removed all the things to be ironed that could not be tackl=
ed by Anne Chitt,=20

stuffed them into Mrs. Chitt's basket, fastened it firmly and rang for Anne=
 and Hannah to carry the=20

things away.  She washed her hands and put on her gardening gloves preparat=
ory to going out,=20

humming a gay little snatch of song; and as she ran down the wide staircase=
 she heard the bell=20

ring, and saw the figure of a man standing in the open doorway.  The maids =
were carrying the=20

linen down the back stairs, and she went across the hall to see what he wan=
ted.  "Well, Jan," he=20

said, and his voice sounded weak and tired. "Here I am at last."  He held o=
ut his hand, and as she=20

took it she felt how hot and dry it was.  "Come in, Hugo," she said quietly=
. "Why didn't you let me=20

know you were coming, and I'd have met you."  The man followed her as she l=
ed the way into the=20

cool, fragrant drawing-room. He paused in the doorway and passed his hand a=
cross his eyes. "It=20

does bring it all back," he said.  He sat down in a deep chair and leaned h=
is head against the=20

back, closing his eyes. Jan saw that he was thin to emaciation, and that he=
 looked very ill; shabby,=20

too, and broken.  The instinct of the nurse that exists in any woman worth =
her salt was roused in=20

Jan. All the passionate indignation she had felt against her brother-in-law=
 was merged at the=20

moment in pity and anxiety.  "Hugo," she said gently, "I fear you are ill. =
Have you had any=20

breakfast?"  "I came by the early train to avoid ordering breakfast; I coul=
dn't have paid for it. I'd=20

only enough for my fare. Jan, I haven't a single rupee left."  He sat forwa=
rd in the chair with his=20

hands on the arms and closed his eyes again.  Jan looked keenly at the hand=
some, haggard face.=20

There was no pretence here. The man was gravely ill. His lips (Jan had alwa=
ys mistrusted his well-

shaped mouth because it would never really shut) were dry and cracked and d=
iscoloured, the=20

cheekbones sharp, and there was that deep hollow at the back of the neck th=
at always betrays the=20

man in ill-health.  She went to him and pressed him back in the chair.  "Wh=
at do you generally do=20

when you have fever?" she asked.  "Go to bed--if there is a bed; and take q=
uinine and drink hot=20

tea."  "That's what you'd better do now. Where are your things?"  "There's =
a small bag at the=20

station. They promised to send it up. I couldn't carry it and I had no mone=
y to pay a boy. I came=20

the long way round, Jan, not through the village. No one recognised me."  "=
I'll get you some tea at=20

once, and I have quinine in the house. Will you take some now?"  Hugo laugh=
ed. "Your quinine=20



would be of no earthly use to me, but I've already taken it this morning. I=
've got some here in=20

handle of the door, and Tony, followed by William, appeared on the threshol=
d.  Hugo Tancred=20

opened his eyes. "Hullo!" he said. "Do you remember me, young shaver?"  Ton=
y came into the=20
