showing to an especial degree the agility of the animal despite its enormou=

 British regulars rowed over from the Canadian shore to Squaw Island and bo=
arded the _Detroit_, their intention being to destroy her and burn up the m=
unitions with which she was laden. Seeing their purpose, _
capacity for emphasizing that which he wishes to be predominant in his comp=
osition he has=20

brought out to the extreme limit of expression the strength of the lion and=
 its savage interest in its=20

prey. The lashing tail, the wrinkled nose, the concentrated eyes are fully =
significant of the mood of=20

the beast, and were the doe equally defined the effect would be disturbing.=
 But the doe, lying on=20

the ground, is treated almost in bas-relief, hardly distinguishable against=
 the massive bulk of its=20

oppressor. The appeal is not to pity, but to recognition of the force of na=
tive instincts. Added to this=20

is the beauty, subtly distinguished and vigorously rendered, of the large c=
urves of the splendid=20

body of the lion. Even among the superb later pieces it would be difficult =
to find one with greater=20

beauty of flowing line and organic composition.  In the illustration we can=
 see the general contour=20

from one point of view, but we cannot see the rhythm of the curves balancin=
g and repeating each=20

other from the tip of the uplifted tail to the arch of the great neck. Nor =
is a particle of energy=20

sacrificed to these beautiful contours. The body is compact, the head large=
 and expressive of=20

power, the thick paws rest with weight on the ground. There is none of the =
pulling out of forms so=20

often employed to give grace and so usually suggestive of weakness. The com=
position is at once=20

absolutely graceful and eloquent of immense physical force. In the _Panther=
 Seizing a Deer_=20

(_Panthere saississant un Cerf_), one of the largest of the animal groups, =
we have again the=20

characteristic double curves, the fine play of line, and the appropriate fi=
tting of the figures into a=20

long oval, and also the minimizing of the cruelty of the subject by the ret=
icent art with which it is=20

treated. We see clearly enough the angry jaws, the curled tail, the weight =
of the attacking beast=20

falling on the head of its victim, dragging it toward the ground. Nothing i=
s slighted or compromised.=20

We see even the gash in the flesh made by the panther's claws and the drops=
 of blood trickling=20

from the wound. But we have to thank Barye's instinct for refined conceptio=
n that these features of=20

the work do not claim and hold our attention which is absorbed by the vital=
 line, the gracious=20

sweep of the contours, the lovely surface, and the omission of all irreleva=
nt and unreasonable=20

detail.  Many of Barye's subjects included the human figure and in a few in=
stances the human=20

figure alone preoccupied him. Occasionally he was very successful in this k=
ind. The small silver=20

reproduction of _Hercules Carrying a Boar_ has the remarkable quality of ea=
sy force. The figure of=20

Hercules is without exaggerated muscles, is normally proportioned and quiet=
ly modeled. His=20

burden rests lightly on his shoulders, and his free long stride indicates t=
hat the labor is joy. This is=20

the ancient, not the modern tradition, and the little figure corresponds, c=
uriously enough, with one=20

of the male figures in the Piero di Cosimo mentioned at the beginning of th=
is article. In the latter=20

case the strong man is engaged in combat with a living animal, but he carri=
es his strength with the=20

same assurance and absence of effort in its exercise. Barye, however, does =
not always give this=20

happy impression when he seeks to represent the human figure. If we compare=
, for example, the=20

bronze made in 1840 for the Duke of Montpensier (_Roger Bearing off Angelic=
a on the=20

Hippogriff_) with any of the animal groups of that decade or earlier, we ca=
n hardly fail to be=20

amazed at the lack of unity in the composition and the distracting multipli=
city of the details. If we=20

compare the _Hunt of the Tiger_ with the _Asian Elephant Crushing Tiger_ th=
e great superiority of=20

the latter in the arrangement of the masses, the dignity of the proportions=
, and in economy of=20

detail, is at once evident. The figures of the four stone groups on the Lou=
vre, however, have a=20

certain antique nobility of design and withal a naturalness that put them i=
n the first class of modern=20

sculpture, I think.  [Illustration: From the collection of the late Cyrus J=
. Lawrence, Esq.  THE LION=20



AND THE SERPENT  ("LION AU SERPENT")  _From a bronze by Barye_]  One point =
worthy of=20

note in any comparison between Barye's animals and his human beings is the =
intensity and=20

subtlety of expression in the former and the absence of any marked expressi=
on in the latter. His=20

men are practically masked. No passion or emotion makes its impression on t=
heir features. Even=20

their gestures, violent though they may be, seem inspired from without and =
not by the impulse of=20

their own feelings. His animals on the contrary show many phases of what mu=
st be called, for lack=20

of a more exact word, psychological expression. A striking instance of this=
 is found in the contrast=20

between the sketch for _The Lion Crushing the Serpent_ and the finished pie=
ce. In the sketch=20

there is terror in the lion's face, his paw is raised to strike at the rept=
ile, his tail and was promoted=20

to an acting lieutenancy.  In our naval history of this time the recurrence=
 of various names, and the=20

references made over and over again to the same actions and occurrences, ar=
e easily=20

accountable when we think of the small number of vessels the United States =
possessed and the=20

surprisingly few officers on the pay-rolls. The high feeling of _esprit de =
corps_ that existed among=20

them came from the fact that they each had a chance to prove their courage =
and fidelity. There=20

was a high standard set for them to reach.  Oliver Hazard Perry went throug=
h the same school=20

that, luckily for us, graduated so many fine officers and sailors--that of =
the Tripolitan war. After he=20

returned to America, at the conclusion of peace with Tripoli, he served in =
various capacities along=20

the coast, proving himself an efficient leader upon more than one occasion.=
 The first service upon=20

which the young officer was employed after the commencement of the war with=
 England was=20

taking charge of a flotilla of gunboats stationed at Newport.  As this serv=
ice was neither arduous=20

nor calculated to bring chances for active employment in the way of fightin=
g, time hung on his=20

hands, and Perry chafed greatly under his enforced retirement. At last he p=
etitioned the=20

government to place him in active service, stating plainly his desire to be=
 attached to the naval=20

forces that were then gathering under the command of Commodore Chauncey on =
the lakes. His=20

request was granted, to his great joy, and he set out with all despatch.  I=
t was at an early period of=20

the war that the government had seen the immense importance of gaining the =
command of the=20

western lakes, and in October of 1812 Commodore Chauncey had been ordered t=
o take seven=20

hundred seamen and one hundred and fifty marines and proceed by forced marc=
hes to Lake=20

Ontario. There had been sent ahead of him a large number of ship-builders a=
nd carpenters, and=20

great activity was displayed in building and outfitting a fleet which might=
 give to the United States=20

the possession of Lake Ontario. There was no great opposition made to the A=
merican arms by the=20

British on this lake, but the unfortunate surrender of General Hull had pla=
ced the English in=20

undisputed possession of Lake Erie.  In March, 1813, Captain Perry having b=
een despatched to=20

the port of Erie, arrived there to find a fleet of ten sail being prepared =
to take the waters against=20

the British fleet under Commodore Barclay--an old and experienced leader, a=
 hero of the days of=20

Nelson and the _Victory_.  Before Perry=E2=80=99s arrival a brilliant littl=
e action had taken place in October=20

of the previous year. Two British vessels, the _Detroit_ and the _Caledonia=
_, came down the lake=20

and anchored under the guns of the British Fort Erie on the Canadian side. =
At that time Lieutenant=20

Elliott was superintending the naval affairs on Lake Erie, and, the news ha=
ving been brought to=20

him of the arrival of the English vessels on the opposite side, he immediat=
ely determined to make=20

a night attack and cut them out. For a long time a body of seamen had been =
tramping their=20

toilsome march from the Hudson River to the lakes, and Elliott, hearing tha=
t they were but some=20



thirty miles away, despatched a messenger to hasten them forward; at the sa=
me time he began to=20

prepare two small boats for the expedition. About twelve o=E2=80=99clock th=
e wearied seamen, footsore and=20

hungry, arrived, and then it was discovered that in the whole draft there w=
ere but twenty pistols,=20

and no cutlasses, pikes, or battle-axes. But Elliott was not dismayed. Appl=
ying to General Smyth,=20

who was in command of the regulars, for arms and assistance, he was supplie=
d with a few=20

muskets and pistols, and about fifty soldiers were detached to aid him.  La=
te in the afternoon Elliott=20

had picked out his crews and manned the two boats, putting about fifty men =
in each; but he did not=20

stir until one o=E2=80=99clock on the following morning, when in the pitch =
darkness he set out from the=20

mouth of Buffalo Creek, with a long pull ahead. The wind was not strong eno=
ugh to make good=20

use of the sails, and the poor sailors were so weary that those who were no=
t rowing lay sleeping,=20

huddled together on their arms, and displaying great listlessness and littl=
e desire for fighting. At=20

three o=E2=80=99clock Elliott was alongside the British vessels. It was a c=
omplete surprise; in ten minutes=20

he had full possession of them and had secured the crews as prisoners. But =
after making every=20

exertion to get under sail, he found to his bitter disappointment that the =
wind was unfortunately so=20

light that the rapid current made them gather an increasing sternway every =
instant. Another=20

unfortunate circumstance was that he would have to pass the British fort be=
low and quite close to=20

hand, for he was on the Canadian shore. As the vessels came in sight of the=
 British battery, the=20

latter opened a heavy fire of round and grape, and several pieces of flying=
 artillery stationed in the=20

woods took up the chorus.=20


_
expression are those of terror mingled with rage and the serpent appears th=
e aggressor. In the=20

finished bronze the lion is calmer and in obvious possession of the field. =
The fierce claws pushing=20

out from their sheathing, the eyes that seem to snarl with the mouth, the m=
assive paw resting on=20

the serpent's coiled body combine to give a subtle impression of certain ma=
stery, and the serpent=20

is unquestionably the victim and defendant in the encounter. It is by such =
intuitive reading of the=20

aspect of animals of diverse kinds, that Barye awakens the imagination and =
leads the mind into=20

the wilderness of the untamed world. He is perhaps most himself when depict=
ing moods of=20

concentration. The fashion in which he gathers the great bodies together fo=
r springing upon and=20

holding down their prey is absolutely unequaled among animal sculptors. His=
 mind handled=20

monumental compositions with greater success, I think, than compositions of=
 the lighter type in=20

which the subject lay at ease or exhibited the pure joy of living which we =
associate with the animal=20

world.  Two exceptions to this statement come, however, at once to my mind-=
-the delightful _Bear=20

in his Trough_ and the _Prancing Bull_. The former is the only instance I k=
now of a Barye animal=20

disporting itself with youthful irresponsibility, and the innocence and hum=
or of the little beast make=20

one wish that it had not occupied this unique place in the list of Barye's =
work. The _Prancing Bull_=20

also is a conception by itself and one of which Barye may possibly the curr=
ent, and was beached=20

in as safe a position as possible under one of the American batteries at Bl=
ack Rock, across the=20

river; but Elliott was compelled to drop his anchor at the distance of abou=
t four hundred yards from=20

two of the British batteries. He was almost at their mercy, and in the extr=
emity he tried the effect of=20

a ruse, or, better, made a threat that we must believe he never intended ca=
rrying into effect.=20

Observing an officer standing on the top of an earthwork, he hailed him at =
the top of his voice:=20

=E2=80=9CHeigh, there, Mr. John Bull! if you fire another gun at me I=E2=80=
=99ll bring up all my prisoners, and you can=20

use them for targets!=E2=80=9D he shouted.  The answer was the simultaneous=
 discharge of all of the=20

Englishman=E2=80=99s guns. But not a single prisoner was brought on deck to=
 share the fate of the=20

Americans, who felt the effect of the fire, and who now began to make stren=
uous efforts to return=20

it. Elliott brought all of the guns on one side of his ship, and replied br=
iskly, until he suddenly=20

discovered that all of his ammunition was expended. Now there was but one c=
hance left: to cut the=20

cable, drift down the river out of the reach of the heavy batteries, and ma=
ke a stand against the=20

flying artillery with small arms. This was accordingly done, but as the sai=
ls were raised the fact=20

was ascertained that the pilot had taken French leave. No one else knew the=
 channel, and,=20

swinging about, the vessel drifted astern for some ten minutes; then, fortu=
nately striking a cross-

current, she brought up on=20


_
extraordinary patience it is not probable that he had the opposite quality =
of ability to catch upon the=20

fly, as it were, a passing motion, an elusive and swiftly fading effect. Bu=
t in this instance he has=20

rendered with great skill the curvetting spring of the bull into the air an=
d the lightness of the motion=20

in contrast with the weight of the American side. Elliott sent a boat to th=
e mainland with the=20

prisoners first. It experienced great difficulty in making the passage, bei=
ng almost swamped once=20

or twice, and it did not return. Affairs had reached a crisis, but with the=
 aid of a smaller boat, and=20

by the exercise of great care, the remainder of the prisoners and the crew=
=20
