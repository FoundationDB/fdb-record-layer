subterfuges, by means of which they evaded or overstepped their instructions, provoking the 

Indians by their inhuman cruelties to acts of resistance, in order to enslave them as rebels against 

the royal authority. He illustrated his accusations with numerous incidents of which he had himself 

been a witness.  His denunciations of the judges described them as corrupt and venal, ready to 

wink at the scandalous abuses and the violations of the Spanish laws, which were daily 

perpetrated under their very eyes, consenting the while to fill their own pockets with a share of the 

illicit profits.  Describing the horrors and ravages of the slave-trade, he declared that the provinces 

of Guatemala and Nicaragua had been depopulated, while in the provinces of Jalisco, Yucatan, 

and day they have destroyed movements and parts which can never be replaced. Of all arts, the 

art of the clockmaker has suffered most at the hands of the modern destroyer of work he does not 

understand.     CHAPTER II  THE BRASS LANTERN CLOCK       The domestic clock--Its use as a

the nefarious art of raiding Indian villages to carry off the inhabitants into slavery.  "Your Majesty 

will see that I do not exaggerate when I affirm that more than four million men have been reduced 

to slavery, all of which has been accomplished in defiance of your Majesty's royal instructions." 

Throughout this treatise, Las Casas supports his contentions on citations from Scripture, and in 

the second article, dealing with the obligations of the of the scene. It is realistic and had to be 

there, and it makes a great factor in the lighting. But the chandelier with candles is the most 

beloved by the artist who inclines to the primitive, as we all do. The electric light must come into 

art and it does. The lift and the telephone are facts, but they are difficult, naked and unashamed as 

they are, to clothe with aesthetic drapery. The cubist and the modern pseudo-scientific realist revel 

in incongruities repellent to art. They seize these as their own, and make them in their 

presentation
