so everything will come off the fire at the same time. Brad will show you what to do."  "How about 

those biscuits?" Red said anxiously. "They've been in the oven a long time."  "Not too long," 

replied Mr. Hatfield. "We want 'em a nice deep brown. But I'll take a quick look."  Eager for a peek 

themselves, the Cubs gathered around.  Mr. Hatfield opened the oven. A blast of heat struck the 

Cubs full in their faces.  "Why, what happened to 'em?" Dan demanded in astonishment. "Where 

are those wonderful biscuits you were bragging about?"  The oven was empty. Gone were the 

biscuits and likewise the metal sheet upon which they had been baked! 

CHAPTER 14                           Beside the Camp Fire   The Cubs stared at the empty oven, 

uncertain whether or not Mr. Hatfield and Red had played a trick upon them.  "Hey, where are 

they?" Midge demanded. "Who swiped the biscuits?"  "That's what I want to know," said Mr. 

Hatfield.  His grim tone left no doubt that the biscuits actually were missing. Their disappearance 

was as mysterious to Mr. Hatfield and Red as to the other boys.  "Why, they were here a few 

minutes ago!" Red exclaimed indignantly. "Someone's swiped 'em!"  Mr. Hatfield glanced quickly 

about the camp. No one however, was within sight.  "Of all the dirty tricks!" Dan exploded. "Taking 

the food right out of our mouths!"  "How about the bacon and eggs?" Fred demanded. "Have they 

walked off too?"  A check disclosed that the other food remained untouched.  "Go ahead and fry 

your bacon and eggs," Mr. Hatfield advised. "Brad and I will take a quick look around."  The pair 

circled the camp, even venturing a short distance into the woods. Because the ground was firm 

and dry, they could find no telltale footprints. Nor did they see anyone.  Giving up the search, they 

returned a few minutes later to share bacon and eggs with the Cubs.  "This supper is ruined 

without the biscuits," Red complained. "I made 'em super! Honestly, I did."  "I'll bet they turned out 

so hard you were afraid to serve 'em," Babe joked. "So to fool us, you buried 'em."  "That's not so," 

Red denied hotly. "The biscuits were perfect when Mr. Hatfield and I went to gather wood. 

Someone stole 'em!"  "It may have been that tramp who hid out in the house," Brad said 

thoughtfully. "For all we know, he may still be around somewhere."  "Just wait until I meet him 

again!" Midge declared, scraping the last bit of egg from his tinfoil cup plate. "I'll give him a piece 

of my mind!"  "Maybe it wasn't the tramp," speculated Chips. He poked the coals with a stick, and 

having stirred the flames, tossed a crumpled ball of foil to the fire.  "Who else could it have been?" 

demanded Fred. "We've seen no one on this road. Only cars that whiz past at twenty-five miles an 

hour."  Chips had fastened his gaze upon the unpainted dwelling owned by the Widow Jones. The 

old house was some distance away, but visible through the trees.  "Remember that runaway boy?" 

he reminded the Cubs. "He was taken back to Mrs. Jones' House, wasn't he?"  "That's right," said 

Mr. Hatfield. Squatting beside the fire, he had listened with interest to the speculation of the Cubs. 

"Well, I'll bet a cent he went off with our food!" Chips announced. "Let's go to the house and find 

out!"  "Yeah!" cried Midge. "We aren't going to let him get by with it, are we?"  "Just a minute, 

boys," interposed Mr. Hatfield. "You're leaping to pretty fast conclusions, in my opinion. It would be 

a mistake--one of the worst kind--to go to Mrs. Jones and complain about the boy. We might be 

doing him a rank injustice."  "Don't forget the tramp," added Brad significantly. "A second ago, you 

fellows were equally sure he was painful and peculiar pleasure. At night, before I went to sleep, I 

often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing through a country that looked 

something like Nebraska and something like Virginia.     IX   THE first snowfall came early in 

December. I remember how the world looked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind 



the stove that morning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had faded out 

into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its stiff willow bushes. Big white flakes 

were whirling over everything and disappearing in the red grass.  Beyond the pond, on the slope 

that climbed to the cornfield, there was, faintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the 

Indians used to ride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring the Indians 

tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the center; but grandfather thought they merely ran races or 

trained horses there. Whenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle showed 

like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the first light spray of snow lay over it, it came 

out with wonderful distinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure stirred me 

as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter.  As soon as the snow had 

packed hard I began to drive about the country in a clumsy sleigh that Otto Fuchs made for me by 

fastening a wooden goods-box on bobs. Fuchs had been apprenticed to a cabinet-maker in the old 

country and was very handy with tools. He would have done a better job if I had n't hurried him. 

My first trip was to the post-office, and the next day I went over to take Yulka and Antonia for a 

sleigh-ride.  It was a bright, cold day. I piled straw and buffalo robes into the box, and took two hot 

bricks wrapped in old blankets. When I got to the Shimerdas' I did not go up to the house, but sat 

in my sleigh at the bottom of the draw and called. Antonia and Yulka came running out, wearing 

little rabbit-skin hats their father had made for them. They had heard about my sledge from 

Ambrosch and knew why I had come. They tumbled in beside me and we set off toward the north, 

along a road that happened to be broken.  The sky was brilliantly blue, and the sunlight on the 

glittering white stretches of prairie was almost blinding. As Antonia said, the whole world was 

changed by the snow; we kept looking in vain for familiar landmarks. The deep arroyo through 

which Squaw Creek wound was now only a cleft between snow-drifts--very blue when one looked 

down into it. The tree-tops that had been gold all the autumn were dwarfed and twisted, as if they 

would never have any life in them again. The few little cedars, which were so dull and dingy 

before, now stood out a strong, dusky green. The wind had the burning taste of fresh snow; my 

throat and nostrils smarted as if some one had opened a hartshorn bottle. The cold stung, and at 

the same time delighted one. My horse's breath rose like steam, and whenever we stopped he 

smoked all over. The cornfields got back a little of their color under the dazzling light, and stood 

the palest possible gold in the sun and snow. All about us the snow was crusted in shallow 

terraces, with tracings like ripple-marks at the edges, curly waves that were the actual impression 

of the stinging lash in the wind.  The girls had on cotton dresses under their shawls; they kept 

shivering beneath the buffalo robes and hugging each other for warmth. But they were so glad to 

get away from their ugly cave and their mother's scolding that they begged me to go on and on, as 

far as Russian Peter's house. The great fresh open, after the stupefying warmth 


_
"Well, it wouldn't do any harm to go to the house and inquire," Chips insisted. "We could be sort 

of--" he groped for a word.  "Discreet?" asked Mr. Hatfield, smiling.  "That's what I mean!"  "I had 

intended to stop at the Jones' house anyway," Mr. Hatfield admitted, starting to stamp out the 

dying coals. "But my purpose is entirely friendly. I'm curious to learn how Jack is getting along." 

"Let's all go," Chips urged. "We want to see if he's well fed--especially on biscuits!"  "Chips, I'm a 

bit uncertain--"  "Oh, I'll watch myself," the boy assured him quickly. "You can do most of the 

talking. We'll just listen and keep our eyes open."  "I'm sure I can depend on you," the Cub leader 

nodded. "Well, let's clean camp. It's getting on toward dark."  The Cubs put out the fire, covering 

the smoking coals with loose dirt. Their knapsacks loaded, they soon were ready to hit the trail. 

"Now remember, boys," Mr. Hatfield warned as the group approached the Jones dwelling, "even if 

you are suspicious, don't make any accusations. Jack already is in a bad spot."  "If we complain 

that he stole our food, Mrs. Jones might send him straight back to the Institute," added Brad. "We 

ought to be dead sure of our ground before we open our lips."  Smoke curled from the chimney of 

the widow's house, so the Cubs knew someone was at home. The yard remained untidy, 

reminding them that they still had a Saturday task before them.  However, there was evidence that 

someone had been doing considerable work. Kindling wood had been cut and cord wood neatly 

sawed and stacked by the sagging porch.  Mr. Hatfield rapped on the door. In a moment, Mrs. 

Jones appeared in her kitchen apron, smiling as she saw the Cubs.  The Cub leader politely told 

her he had come to inquire how Jack Phillips was getting along.  Immediately Mrs. Jones looked 

troubled. "That boy!" she exclaimed. "If I haven't had a handful!"  "I hope he hasn't been giving you 

a bad time," Mr. Hatfield returned.  "Well, yes, and no. There's good stuff in the lad, but he's a 

problem."  "Keeping him at home is one of them, I judge."  Mrs. Jones drew a deep sigh. "Jack is 

off somewhere this very minute. Early this morning I told him to cut the wood. He went through the 

job like a house afire, and then before I knew it, he was gone."  "Wandering the woods perhaps?" 

"Yes, that boy is like a wild things with his love of the outdoors. He went off for three hours 

yesterday and I gave him a switching when he came back. But it didn't prevent him from trying the 

same trick today."  Mr. Hatfield smiled as the widow mentioned the switching. She was a frail little 

woman, weighing a scant one hundred pounds. Jack, by contrast, was built like a football player 

and heavy for his age.  "I don't think the switching hurt him any," Mrs. Jones said. "The scamp sort 

of laughed while I was doing it. I'm right provoked at him today though. He took the rifle when he 

left."  "Why, that's rather dangerous."  "Oh, Jack's a good shot," Mrs. Jones informed him. "I 

wouldn't mind him using the gun, if he'd ask me for it. It's those sneaking ways of his that annoy 

me."  "I know what you mean," nodded Mr. Hatfield, reflecting upon the missing biscuits. "Well, be 

patient with the lad. He may develop. And if there's anything I can do, call on me."  "If you could 

round that boy up and send him home, I'd appreciate it," the wild things. They laughed and 

shouted, and said they never wanted to go home again. Could n't we settle down and live in 

Russian Peter's house, Yulka asked, and could n't I go to town and buy things for us to keep 

house with?  All the way to Russian Peter's we were extravagantly happy, but when we turned 

back,--it must have been about four o'clock,--the east wind grew stronger and began to howl; the 

sun lost its heartening power and the sky became gray and somber. I took off my long woolen 

comforter and wound it around Yulka's throat. She got so cold that we made her hide her head 

under the buffalo robe. Antonia and I sat erect, but I held the reins clumsily, and my eyes were 



blinded by the wind a good deal of the time. It was growing dark when we got to their house, but I 

refused to go in with them and get warm. I knew my hands would ache terribly if I went near a fire. 

Yulka forgot to give me back my comforter, and I had to drive home directly against the wind. The 

next day I came down with an attack of quinsy, which kept me in the house for nearly two weeks. 

The basement kitchen seemed heavenly safe and warm in those days--like a tight little boat in a 

winter sea. The men were out in the fields all day, husking corn, and when they came in at noon, 

with long caps pulled down over their ears and their feet in red-lined overshoes, I used to think 

they were like Arctic explorers.  In the afternoons, when grandmother sat upstairs darning, or 

making husking-gloves, I read "The Swiss Family Robinson" aloud to her, and I felt that the Swiss 

family had no advantages over us in the way of an adventurous life. I was convinced that man's 

strongest antagonist is the cold. I admired the cheerful zest with which grandmother went about 

keeping us warm and comfortable and well-fed. She often reminded me, when she was preparing 

for the return of the hungry men, that this country was not like Virginia, and that here a cook had, 

as she said, "very little to do with." On Sundays she gave us as much chicken as we could eat, 

and on other days we had ham or bacon or sausage meat. She baked either pies or cake for us 

every day, unless, for a change, she made my favorite pudding, striped with currants and boiled in 

a bag.  Next to getting warm and keeping warm, dinner and supper were the most interesting 

things we had to think about. Our lives centered around warmth and food and the return of the 

men at nightfall. I used to wonder, when they came in tired from the fields, their feet numb and 

their hands cracked and sore, how they could do all the chores so conscientiously: feed and water 

and bed the horses, milk the cows, and look after the pigs. When supper was over, it took them a 

long while to get the cold out of their bones. While grandmother and I washed the dishes and 

grandfather read his paper upstairs, Jake and Otto sat on the long bench behind the stove, 

"easing" their inside boots, or rubbing mutton tallow into their cracked hands.  Every Saturday 

night we popped corn or made taffy, and Otto Fuchs used to sing, "For I Am a Cowboy and Know 

I've Done Wrong," or, "Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairee." He had a good baritone voice and 

always led the singing when we went to church services at the sod schoolhouse.  I can still see 

those two men sitting on the bench; Otto's close-clipped head and Jake's shaggy hair slicked flat 

in front

dragging in--if at all."  "You haven't had any serious trouble with him?"  The widow hesitated. "I 

haven't wanted to report his behavior to the Court officials, because if I do, I know they'll pack him 

off to the industrial school. I'm trying to give him a chance."  "But he has caused you worry? 

There's more to it than restlessness and running away?"  "Well, a few things have disappeared," 

Mrs. Jones admitted reluctantly. "Nothing of much value, but it bothers me."  "What are some of 

the things that have been taken?"  "Jack always is sneaking into the ice box. He'll pack himself a 

lunch and disappear for hours."  "A the sag of their tired shoulders against the whitewashed wall. 

What good fellows they were, how much they knew, and how many things they had kept faith with! 

Fuchs had been a cowboy, a stage-driver, a bar-tender, a miner; had wandered all over that great 

Western country and done hard work everywhere, though, as grandmother said, he had nothing to 

show for it. Jake was duller than Otto. He could scarcely read, wrote even his name with difficulty, 

and he had a violent temper which sometimes made him behave like a crazy man--tore him all to 

pieces and actually made him ill. But he was so soft-hearted that any one could 


_
"Oh, I'm not complaining about the food. Though it plagues me that he doesn't come right out 

honest like and ask for it."  "The boy takes other things?"  "One of my black silk dresses 

disappeared. I'd dry cleaned it with gasoline and hung it up in the shed to air out. To tell you the 

truth, I forgot about it for several days. When I went to get it, well it was gone."  "What would Jack 

want with a black silk dress?" Mr. Hatfield questioned dubiously.  "You tell!" Mrs. Jones made a 

despairing gesture. "He chops wood and then half of it disappears before he said, "forgot himself" 

and swore before grandmother, he went about depressed and shamefaced all day. They were 

both of them jovial about the cold in winter and the heat in summer, always ready to work overtime 

and to meet emergencies. It was a matter of pride with them not to spare themselves. Yet they 

were the sort of men who never get on, somehow, or do anything but work hard for a dollar or two 

a day.  On those bitter, starlit nights, as we sat around the old stove that fed us and warmed us 

and kept us cheerful, we could hear the coyotes howling
