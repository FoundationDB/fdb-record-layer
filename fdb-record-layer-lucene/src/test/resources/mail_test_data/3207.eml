It had not been altogether her mother's death; that had happened when she w=
as only six years=20

old, and there were bright memories after it of happy times together. No--i=
t was when she was ten=20

years old that the unknown catastrophe must have occurred which had ruined =
her Morro and=20

Cabrera, which are already joined to the shore. (* The position of these is=
lands is as follows:=20

northward, near the shore, the Isla de Cura; on the south-east, Burro, Horn=

life. She could remember plainly the visit of several gentlemen, and of lou=
d angry voices talking=20

inside the drawing-room; she was standing on the stairs as they came out in=
to the hall, and her=20

father had told her roughly to run away. Then had followed a hasty removal,=
 and they had left their=20

comfortable home in London and had come to live in Naples. After a dreary t=
ime in a second-rate=20

Italian boarding-house she had been sent to the Villa Camellia, and all lin=
k with England was lost=20

and broken. No aunt or cousins ever wrote to her, and the earlier portion o=
f her life seemed a=20

period that was utterly ended.  So far Lorna had never had the courage to m=
ake any inquiries into=20

the why and wherefore of this unsatisfactory state of affairs. If a questio=
n rose to her lips the sight=20

of her father's forbidding face effectually curbed her curiosity. That some=
 tragedy had been=20

concealed from her she was positive. The suspicion, nay the absolute certai=
nty, was sufficient to=20

place a division between herself and other girls. She would hear her school=
fellows discussing their=20

homes, relations, and friends, and when she contrasted their gay doings wit=
h her own barren=20

holidays she shrank into her shell, and would make no allusion to her priva=
te affairs.  "Lorna's an=20

absolute oyster, you can get nothing out of her," was the universal verdict=
 of her form.  But if she=20

said little she thought a great deal. She would listen jealously to the acc=
ounts of other people's=20

fun, and a bitter feeling had grown in her heart. Why should her life be so=
 shadowed? She had as=20

much right to happiness as the rest of the school. Why should she seem sing=
led out by a vindictive=20

fate and Culebra. In the centre of the lake rise, like shoals or small deta=
ched rocks, Vagre, Fraile,=20

Penasco, and Pan de Azucar.) They are partly cultivated, and extremely fert=
ile on account of the=20

vapours that rise from the lake. Burro, the largest of these islands, is tw=
o miles in length, and is=20

inhabited by some families of mestizos, who rear goats. These simple people=
 seldom visit the=20

shore of Mocundo. To them the lake appears of immense extent; they have pla=
ntains, cassava,=20

milk, and a little fish. A hut constructed of reeds; hammocks woven from th=
e cotton which the=20

neighbouring fields produce; a large stone on which the fire is made; the l=
igneous fruit of the=20

tutuma (the calabash) in which they draw water, constitute their domestic e=
stablishment. An old=20

mestizo who offered us some goat's milk had a beautiful daughter. We learne=
d from our guide,=20

that solitude had rendered him as mistrustful as he might perhaps have been=
 made by the society=20

of men. The day before our arrival, some hunters had visited the island. Th=
ey were overtaken by=20

the shades of night; and preferred sleeping in the open air to returning to=
 Mocundo. This news=20

spread alarm throughout the island. The father obliged the young girl to cl=
imb up a very lofty=20

zamang or acacia, which grew in the plain at some distance from the hut, wh=
ile he stretched=20

himself at the foot of the tree, and did not permit his daughter to descend=
 till the hunters had=20

departed.  The lake is in general well stocked with fish; though it furnish=
es only three kinds, the=20

flesh of which is soft and insipid, the guavina, the vagre, and the sardina=
. The two last descend=20

into the lake with the streams that flow into it. The=20

In justice to the girls at the Villa Camellia it is only fair to say that a=
ny separation was entirely of=20

Lorna's own making. Had she been more expansive she would have readily enou=
gh found friends.=20

No one knew of the misery of her home life, and she was simply judged as wh=
at her schoolfellows=20

thought her--a queer-tempered crank who refused to join in the general fun =
of the place, and in=20

consequence was left out of most things.  Irene, pleasant and hail-fellow-w=
ell-met with all comers,=20

had at once noticed this attitude of the others towards on the spot, is 20 =
inches long and 3.5=20

broad. It is perhaps a new species of the genus erythrina of Gronovius. It =
has large silvery scales=20

edged with green. This fish is extremely voracious, and destroys other kind=
s. The fishermen=20

assured us that a small crocodile, the bava,* which often approached us whe=
n we were bathing,=20

contributes also to the destruction of the fish. (* The bava, or bavilla, i=
s very common at Bordones,=20

near Cumana. See volume 1. The name of bava, baveuse, has misled M. Depons;=
