generations of children. With inferior art, Madame d'Aulnoy added to the go=

began between the=20

Ancients and the Moderns, the philosophical discussion of the idea of progr=
ess had separated=20

itself from the literary quarrel. But in the tiltings of Lamotte-Houdart, t=
he champion of the moderns,=20

against a well-equipped female knight, the learned Madame Dacier--indignant=
 at Lamotte's=20

_Iliade_, recast in the eighteenth-century taste--a new question was raised=
, and one of=20

significance for the eighteenth century--that of the relative merits of pro=
se and verse.  Lamotte, a=20

writer of comedy, tragedy, opera, fables, eclogues, odes, maintained that t=
he highest literary form=20

is prose, and he versified none the less. The age was indeed an age of pros=
e--an age when the=20

_salons_ discussed the latest discovery in science, the latest doctrine in =
philosophy or politics. Its=20



imaginative enthusiasm passed over from art to speculation, and what may be=
 called the poetry of=20

the eighteenth century is to be found less in its odes or dramas or elegies=
 than in the hopes and=20

visions which gathered about that idea of human progress emerging from a li=
terary discussion,=20

idle, perhaps, in appearance, but in its inner significance no unfitting in=
auguration of an era which=20

looked to the future rather than to the past.  BERNARD LE BOVIER DE FONTENE=
LLE (1657-

1757), a son of Corneille's sister, whose intervention in the quarrel of An=
cients and Moderns=20

turned the discussion in the direction of philosophy, belongs to both the s=
eventeenth and the=20

eighteenth centuries. In the hundred years which made up his life, there wa=
s indeed time for a=20

second Fontenelle to develop from the first. The first Fontenelle, satirise=
d as the Cydias of La=20

Bruyere, "un compose du pedant et du precieux," was an aspirant poet, witho=
ut vision, without=20

passion, who tried to compensate his deficiencies by artificial elegances o=
f style. The origin of=20

hissing is maliciously dated by Racine from his tragedy _Aspar_. His operas=
 fluttered before they=20

fell; his _Eglogues_ had not life enough to flutter. The _Dialogues des Mor=
ts_ (1683) is a young=20

writer's effort to be clever by paradox, an effort to show his wit by incon=
gruous juxtapositions, and=20

a cynical levelling of great reputations. But there was another Fontenelle,=
 the untrammelled=20

disciple of Descartes, a man of universal interests, passionless, but curio=
us for all knowledge, an=20

assimilator of new ideas, a dissolver of old beliefs, an intermediary betwe=
en science and the world=20

of fashion, a discreet insinuator of doubts, who smiled but never condescen=
ded to laugh, an=20

intelligence supple, subtle, and untiring.  In 1686 he published his=20

removed.  Of course,=20

e theories of=20

Descartes and the discoveries of Galileo, suggested that science is our saf=
est way to truth, and=20

that truth at best is not absolute but relative to the human understanding.=
 The _Histoire des=20

Oracles_, in which the cargo of Dutch erudition that loaded his original by=
 Van Dale is skilfully=20

lightened, glided to the edge of theological storm. Fontenelle would show t=
hat the pagan oracles=20

were not delivered by demons, and did not cease at the coming of Jesus Chri=

but apt to illustrate the origins and growth of superstitions, from which w=
