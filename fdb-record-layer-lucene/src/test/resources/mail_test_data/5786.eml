the spot would act like a telegraphic signal to others, that would be rapid=
ly communicated to every=20

vulture at successive airy stations.  If any animal be skinned, the red sur=
face will attract the=20

vultures in an instant; this proves that their sight, and not their scent, =
has been attracted by an=20

object that suggests blood. I have frequently watched them when I have shot=
 an animal, and my=20

people have commenced the process of skinning. At first, not a bird has bee=
n in sight, as I have=20

lain on my back and gazed into the spotless blue sky; but hardly has the sk=
in been half withdrawn,=20

than specks have appeared in the heavens, rapidly increasing. "Caw, caw," h=
as been heard=20

several times from the neighbouring bushes; the buzzards have swept down cl=
ose to my people,=20

and have snatched a morsel of clotted blood from the ground. The specks hav=
e increased to=20

winged creatures, at the great height resembling flies, when presently a ru=
shing sound behind me,=20

like a whirlwind, has been followed by the pounce of a red-faced vulture, t=
hat has fallen from the=20

heavens in haste with closed wings to the bloody feast, followed quickly by=
 many of his brethren.=20

The sky has become alive with black specks in the far-distant blue, with wi=
ngs hurrying visitors=20

through the church.  "This way, gentlemen, into the sacristy."  As they ste=
pped in there it was=20

before them! Pal Gregorics's old umbrella smiled at them, and seemed like a=
n old friend, only the=20

handle, yes, the handle was unknown to them, for it was of silver.  Gyuri g=
azed at it speechlessly,=20

and felt that the end was near. A demon was behind him, constantly urging h=
im on, and=20

whispering: "Go on, go on, and look for your inheritance!" A second demon r=
an on before him,=20

beckoning and crying: "Come along, it is this way!"  But there was a third =
one, the liveliest of all,=20

who followed in the wake of the second one, and each time Gyuri thought he =
had attained his end,=20

this demon turned round, and laughed in his face, saying: "There is nothing=
 here!"  Sztolarik kept=20

his countenance, and carefully examined the handle of the umbrella, as thou=
gh he were admiring=20

the work.  "Had it always this same handle?" he asked.  "Oh dear no, this i=
s of real silver, and very=20

finely chased. The jeweller in Besztercebanya made it, and he is quite an a=
rtist. Just look at the=20

style, and what taste is displayed in it. My parishioners had it made last =
summer as a surprise for=20

me while I was away at the baths. The old handle had been broken off,=20
