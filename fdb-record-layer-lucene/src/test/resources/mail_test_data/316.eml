ABUNDANCE  (See also Abundance, page 11)  "There is abundance in the world =
for me given by=20

the bountiful hand of Omnipotence. I gratefully claim and accept all the su=
pply for my needs."  The=20

old idea of orthodox prayer was that of supplication and begging. I have sp=
ent a whole night at a=20

time begging for a few pennies and supplicating for the salvation of others=
. What waste of energy.=20

Each time that we send up such a weak supplication as the attitude of a beg=
gar, with the timid,=20

frightful thoughts that only a beggar's mind can have--this condition of mi=
nd, cross circuits the=20

power to bring into our lives the very things we most desire.  When the beg=
gar extends his hand=20

for a copper, he knows that not everyone who passes is going to give him a =
coin. He, therefore,=20

solicits more or less mechanically, with a mind not positive or sure. His h=
and is extended in timidity=20

and weakness. Now and then he gets a coin from a sympathetic passer-by. The=
 same principle=20

holds true for the man who prays in the old orthodox fashion. He utters his=
 petitions with doubts=20

and misgivings, with timidity and wonderings. Some of his prayers are answe=
red--just as the=20

occasional coin is cast to the beggar. But most of the orthodox prayers sen=
t up in the fashion of=20

begging and supplicating are never answered. Of necessity, they cannot be, =
because the=20

concentration is filled with fear and trembling.  Only by positive and cour=
ageous thinking do we=20

attract to ourselves the answers to our prayers. When we are permeated with=
 the spirit of doubt,=20

our petitions are cross-circuited.  Therefore, in making your affirmation t=
his time, rest assured that=20

the abundant spirit of the Universal Supply has everything you need, and ha=
s it now. You have=20

only to put your mind in a condition to receive.  You do not have to beg th=
e sun for its rays, nor=20

God for His love. It is there for the taking. Many of us keep the sunshine =
of abundance out of our=20

lives by pulling down the curtain of doubt--just as we may go into a room, =
pull down a shade and=20

keep out the sun. James Russell Lowell, seventy-five years ago, told us the=
 same story in "The=20

Vision of Sir Launfal," when he said that "Heaven is given away and God may=
 be had for the=20

asking".  By gratefully accepting all of the supply for your needs, you are=
 running up the shade=20

EOUS=20

INQUIRIES]  None of these minute courtesies which you owe to yourself and t=
o your neighbor lays=20

on you any obligation to call, or to invite her to call on you. Failure to =
comprehend this social by-

law often causes heart-burnings and downright resentment. You may thus meet=
 and greet a=20

woman living near you every day for twenty years, and if some stronger bond=
 than the accident of=20
