General Terms of Use &  There are two Sorts of Mustard: _viz._ The white So=

Grain, and not so strong; and the black Sort, which is a small Grain. That =
which I account the best,=20

is from the wild Mustard, commonly found growing in _Essex_, which sells th=

must be fresh, and free from any Flavour or Taint: it should not indeed be =
used with any other=20

 open Sieve, and the=20
