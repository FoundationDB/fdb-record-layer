IV  As to how long the journey in the coach lasted after that Yvonne Dewhur=
st could not have said.=20

It may have been a few hours, it may have been a cycle of years. She had be=
en young--a happy=20

bride, a dutiful daughter--when she left Combwich Hall. She was an old woma=
n now, a supremely=20

unhappy one, parted from the man she loved without hope of ever seeing him =
again in life, and=20

feeling nothing but hatred and contempt for the father who had planned such=
 infamy against her.=20

She offered no resistance whatever to any of her father's commands. After t=
he first outburst of=20

revolt and indignation she had not even spoken to him.  There was a halt so=
mewhere on the way,=20

when in the low-raftered room of a posting-inn, she had to sit at table wit=
h the two men who had=20

compassed her misery. She was thirsty, feverish and weak: she drank some mi=
lk in silence. She=20

felt ill physically as well as mentally, and the constant effort not to bre=
ak down had helped to=20

shatter her nerves. As she had stepped out of the barouche without a word, =
so she stepped into it=20

again when it stood outside, ready with a fresh relay of horses to take her=
 further, still further,=20

away from the cosy little nest where even now her young husband was waiting=
 longingly for her=20

return. The people of the inn--a kindly-looking woman, a portly middle-aged=
 man, one or two=20

young ostlers and serving-maids were standing about in the yard when her fa=
ther led her to the=20

coach. For a moment the considerable force, and, bounding off, fell to the =
ground.  The result was=20

that the horse, to La Certe's unutterable surprise, made a sudden demivolt =
into the air--without the=20

usual persuasion--almost unseated its rider, and fled over the prairie like=
 a thing possessed!  A=20

faint smile ruffled the solemnity of Little Bill at this, but it vanished w=
hen he heard a low chuckle=20

behind him.  Wheeling round, he stood face to face with Slowfoot, whose mou=
th was expanded=20

from ear to ear.  "Clever boy!" she said, patting him on the back, "come in=
to the tent and have=20

some grub."  She said this in the Cree language, which the boy did not unde=
rstand, but he=20

understood well enough the signs with which the invitation was accompanied.=
  Thanking her with=20

an eloquent look, he re-entered the tent along with her.    CHAPTER EIGHTEE=
N.  ADVENTURES=20

OF ARCHIE AND THE SEAMAN.  Meanwhile the buffalo-hunt progressed favourably=
, and the=20

slaughter of animals was considerable.  But there were two members of that =
hunt whose=20

proceedings were not in exact accord with the habits and laws of the chase,=
 as usually conducted=20

on the Red River plains.  These were the seaman Jenkins and Archie Sinclair=
.  A mutual=20

attachment having sprung up between these two, they had arranged to keep to=
gether during the=20

chase; and when the signal for attack was given by Dechamp, as before relat=
ed, they had "set=20

sail," according to Jenkins, fairly well with the rest.  But they had not g=
one more=20
