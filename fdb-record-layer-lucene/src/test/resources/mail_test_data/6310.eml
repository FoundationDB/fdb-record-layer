could not have shown more concern.  So much the frantic father noted, while=
 he stood irresolute,=20

uncertain what to do next.  The bear would have been an easy shot by daylig=
ht, if there had been=20

no baby to consider.  But there was that little bundle of humanity, the man=
's own flesh and blood,=20

and a bullet in order to pierce the bear's heart must strike within a few i=
nches of the baby's head.=20

The task that King Gessler set William Tell, was child's play compared with=
 this.  To shoot might=20

mean to kill his own child, and not to shoot might mean a still more terrib=
le death for the infant.=20

The child's wails now grew louder and more frequent.  The old bear became u=
neasy; in another=20

moment she might flee farther into the woods, or worse than that, might sil=
ence the little one with a=20

blow or a crunch of her powerful jaws.  The desperate man raised his gun.  =
The fitful moonlight=20

shimmered and danced upon the barrel, and the shadows from the tree-tops al=
ternated with=20

multifarious orders, =E2=80=9Cis to produce among all classes an impression=
 adequate to the occasion. I=20

wish the lord and the tenantry alike to feel they have a duty to perform.=
=E2=80=9D  In the mean time,=20

Monsignore Catesby was pressing Lothair to become one of the patrons of a R=
oman Catholic=20

Bazaar, where Lady St. Jerome and Miss Arundel were to preside over a stall=
. It was of=20

importance to show that charity was not the privilege of any particular cre=
ed.  Between his=20

lawyers, and his monsignores, and his architects, Lothair began to get a li=
ttle harassed. He was=20

disturbed in his own mind, too, on greater matters, and seemed to feel ever=
y day that it was more=20

necessary to take a decided step, and more impossible to decide upon what i=
t should be. He=20

frequently saw the cardinal, who was very kind to him, but who had become m=
ore reserved on=20

religious subjects. He had dined more than once with his eminence, and had =
met some=20

distinguished prelates and some of his fellow-nobles=20


_
added to all this, was the thought that the gun was not a rifle, with an ac=
curate bullet, but an old=20

shotgun loaded with a Minie ball.  At first, his arms shook so that he coul=
d not hold the gun steady,=20

but by a mighty effort he nerved himself.  For a second the moon favored hi=
m; a moment the sight=20

glinted just in front errors of their cradle. The cardinal, perhaps, though=
t that the presence of these=20

eminent converts would facilitate the progress, perhaps the decision, of hi=
s ward; but something=20

seemed always to happen to divert Lothair in his course. It might-be someti=
mes apparently a very=20

slight cause, but yet for the time=20
