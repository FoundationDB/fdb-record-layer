philodendron monstera recognized by, and known through, the highest Occult =

sixth and the seventh) correspond to the two highest human principles, Budd=

it must be the good=20

Karmic records of the deceased, impressed upon the Auric Substance, which f=
urnish the Human=20

Soul with just enough of the spiritual elements of the ex-personality, to e=
nable it to still believe=20

itself that body from which it has just been severed, and to receive its fr=
uition, during a more or=20

less prolonged period of "spiritual gestation." For Devachan is a "spiritua=
l gestation" within an ideal=20

matrix state, a birth of the Ego into the world of effects, which ideal, su=
bjective birth precedes its=20

next terrestrial birth, the latter being determined by its bad Karma, into =
the world of causes.(824)=20

In the case of the Spook, the Kama Rupa is furnished from the animal dregs =
of the Auric=20

Envelope, with its daily Karmic record of animal life, so full of animal de=
sires and selfish=20

aspirations.(825)  Now the Linga Sharira remains with the Physical Body, an=
d fades out along with=20

it. An astral entity then has to be created, a new Linga Sharira provided, =
to become the bearer of=20

all the past Tanhas and future Karma. How is this accomplished? The mediumi=
stic Spook, the=20

"departed angel," fades out and vanishes also in its turn(826) as an entity=
 or full image of the=20

personality that was, and leaves in the Kamalokic world of effects only the=
 record of its misdeeds=20

and sinful thoughts and acts, known in the phraseology of Occultists as Tan=
hic or human=20

Elementals. Entering into the composition of the Astral Form of the new bod=
y, into which the Ego,=20

upon its quitting the Devachanic state, is to enter according to Karmic dec=
ree, the Elementals form=20

that new astral entity which is born within the Auric Envelope, and of whic=
h it is often said:       Bad=20

Karma waits at the threshold of Devachan, with its army of     Skandhas.(82=
7)   For no sooner is=20

the Devachanic state of reward ended, than the Ego is indissolubly united w=
ith (or rather follows in=20

the track of) the new Astral Form. Both are Karmically propelled towards th=
e family or woman from=20

whom is to be born the _animal child_ chosen by Karma to become the vehicle=
 of the Ego which=20

has just awakened from the Devachanic state. Then the _new_ Astral Form, co=
mposed partly of=20

the pure Akashic Essence of the Auric Egg, and partly of the terrestrial el=
ements of the punishable=20

sins and misdeeds of the last personality, is drawn into the woman. Once th=
ere, Nature models the=20

foetus of flesh around the Astral, out of the growing  "Thank you, my lord,=
" said the mendicant in a=20

hoarse voice. "But I am not yet ready to receive it."  "Very well. Adieu." =
 "Adieu, your holiness,"=20

said the mendicant, opening the door and bending low before the prelate.   =
  47. The Riot.   It was=20

about eleven o'clock at night. Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he =
perceived the strange=20

change which had been made in the streets of Paris.  The whole city seemed =
peopled with=20

fantastic beings; silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others =
dragging and=20

upsetting great wagons, whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ing=
ulf whole regiments of=20

horsemen. These active beings flitted here and there like so many demons co=
mpleting some=20

unknown labor; these were the beggars of the Court of Miracles--the agents =
of the giver of holy=20

water in the Square of Saint Eustache, preparing barricades for the morrow.=
  Gondy gazed on=20

these deeds of darkness, on these nocturnal laborers, with a kind of fear; =
he asked himself, if,=20

after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens, he should h=
ave the power of making=20

them retire again. He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of the=
se beings happened to=20

approach him. He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue=
 de la Ferronnerie;=20

there the aspect changed; here it was the tradesmen who were running from s=
hop to shop; their=20

doors seemed closed like their shutters, but they were only pushed to in su=
ch a manner as to open=20

and allow the men, who seemed fearful of showing what they carried, to ente=
r, closing=20



immediately. These men were shopkeepers, who had arms to lend to those who =
had none.  One=20

individual went from door to door, bending under the weight of swords, guns=
, muskets and every=20

kind of weapon, which he deposited as fast as he could. By the light of a l=
antern the coadjutor=20

recognized Planchet.  The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of =
the Rue de la=20

Monnaie; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray, a=
ccording as they=20

belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie. They were standing motionless, =
while single men=20

passed from one group to another. All these cloaks, gray or black, were rai=
sed behind by the point=20

of a sword, or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket.  On reachi=
ng the Pont Neuf the=20

coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him.  "Who are you=
?" asked the man. "I=20

do not know you for one of us."  "Then it is because you do not know your=
=20


_
essence of a decayed seed the fruit or eidolon of the dead seed, the physic=
al fruit producing in its=20

turn within itself another, and other seeds for future plants.  And now we =
may return to the Tattvas,=20

and see what they mean in nature and man, showing thereby the great danger =
of indulging in=20

fancy, amateur Yoga, without knowing what we are about.    The Tattvic Corr=
elations and=20

Louvieres," said the coadjutor, raising his hat.  Louvieres recognized him =
and bowed.  Gondy=20

continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle. There he saw a leng=
thy chain of people=20

gliding under the walls. They might be said to be a procession of ghosts, f=
or they were all wrapped=20

in white cloaks. When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be =
annihilated, one=20


_
In Nature, then, we find seven Forces, or seven Centres of Force, and every=
thing seems to=20

respond to that number, as for instance, the septenary scale in music, or S=
ounds, and the=20

septenary spectrum in Colours. I have not exhausted its nomenclature and pr=
oofs in the earlier=20

volumes, yet enough is given to show every thinker that the facts adduced a=
re no coincidences,=20

but very weighty testimony.  There are several reasons why only five Tattva=
s are given in the=20

Hindu systems. One of these I have already mentioned; another is that owing=
 to our having=20

reached only the Fifth Race, and being (so far as Science feet. Gondy, edge=
d into a corner, saw=20

them vanish from the first until the last but one. The last raised his eyes=
, to ascertain, doubtless,=20

that neither his companions nor himself had been watched, and, in spite of =
the darkness, he=20

perceived Gondy. He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his th=
roat.  "Halloo! Monsieur=20

de Rochefort," said Gondy, laughing, "are you a boy to play with firearms?"=
  Rochefort recognized=20

the voice.  "Ah, it is you, my lord!" said he.  "The very same. What people=
 are you leading thus into=20

the bowels of the earth?"  "My fifty recruits from the Chevalier d'Humieres=
, who=20


_
able to ascertain) endowed with only five senses, the two remaining senses =
that are still latent in=20

man can have their existence proven only on phenomenal evidence which to th=
e Materialist is no=20

evidence at all. The five physical senses are made to correspond with the f=
ive lower Tattvas, the=20

two yet undeveloped senses in man; and the two forces, or Tattvas, forgotte=
n by Brahmans and=20

still unrecognized by Science, being so subjective and the highest of them =
so enter the light=20

cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white c=
loaks."  "And where are=20

you going?"  "To the house of one of my friends, a sculptor, only we enter =
by the trap through=20

which he lets down his marble."  "Very good," said Gondy, shaking Rochefort=
 by the hand, who=20

descended in his turn and closed the trap after him.  It was now one o'cloc=
k in the morning and the=20

coadjutor returned home. He opened a window and leaned out to=20
