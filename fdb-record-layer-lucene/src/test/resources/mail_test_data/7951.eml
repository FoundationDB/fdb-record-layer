 and it is in vain to=20

attempt to persuade them otherwise. However it is but justice to say that t=

risked, and even sacrificed, their own lives in endeavouring to preserve th=

some recent instances, especially in Wales, prove that the old disposition =
still lurks amongst the=20

people, and sometimes breaks out with unabated violence.  The arrival of a =
party of the Preventive=20

Service that evening, in some measure proved a check to the plunder of the =
peasantry; but the=20

guards themselves were not proof against the prevailing infection, influenc=

should accrue. If I had only to deal with men, I would not admit of failure=
; but when your=20

baffle a Machiavel and appall a Borgia.=E2=80=9D  While he was meditating i=

and Mr. Clifford, with some hasty action and speaking rapidly, exclaimed: =

here sooner than myself. His carriage was at the door. I drove back as soon=
 as possible=E2=80=94and=20

the rum casks that did=20

not afterwards turn out impregnated with bilge water.  On a fine grey morni=
ng, about a week after=20

these events occurred, I wandered out towards the shore: there had been rou=
gh weather in the=20

channel, and many wrecks, and the turbulence of the ocean had not yet subsi=
ded. It was about=20

half-flood when I reached the _Bonne Esperance_. She had disappeared by pie=
ce-meal under the=20

repeated assaults of the sea, but the principal part of the hull was still =
hanging together. Each=20

wave as it struck her tattered timbers, seemed to sap away her strength and=
 threatened to shake=20

her to fragments. I sat with the supercargo for about an hour, watching the=
 flow of the tide. Her=20

timbers cracked louder and louder at each shock of the breakers; when a hea=
vy sea struck her,=20

her joints loosened, and she broke up at last, scattered into fragments, an=

=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA little hour with us is a long=20
