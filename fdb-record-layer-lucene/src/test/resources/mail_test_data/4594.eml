band. Fate ordained it also that Peter should come down stairs at this part=
icular moment and wend=20

his way to Mrs. Nagsby's parlor. Fate also had ordained it that a mouse whi=
ch lived in a hole=20

behind Mrs. Nagsby's easy-chair should issue at this particular moment for =
a little bread-crumb=20

expedition. Mrs. Nagsby was a careful housekeeper, and finding no crumbs ab=
out, the mouse=20

roamed into the silent highway presented by the orifice of the euphonium. I=
t was natural enough=20

that Peter should follow the mouse. Unfortunately, Peter's progress was sto=
pped, the girth of his=20

body being too great to admit him; and my door being open, I at once rushed=
 to the rescue, and=20

found Peter with his head in the depths of the euphonium, and making fierce=
 struggles to vacate=20

the position. Mrs. Nagsby came downstairs and entered her parlor just as I =
succeeded in=20

extracting Peter from the musical instrument. Fiercely was I reproached for=
 Peter's escapade, and=20

humbly did I make his apologies, little knowing the secret of the plight fr=
om which I had rescued=20

him. Having soothed my landlady, she at length took up the euphonium and pr=
oceeded to apply=20

her eye to the main orifice to see if Peter had damaged it, handling the eu=
phonium in the manner=20

of a telescope. I was thinking of the reproaches in prospect, when I was st=
artled by a loud shriek,=20

to which the euphonium imparted a metallic vibration, and Mrs. Nagsby dropp=
ed the instrument on=20

to the floor, the good lady herself following it with a thud. A wee mouse s=
cuttled across her face,=20

disappeared behind the easy chair, and doubtless rejoined his anxious famil=
y. Mrs. Nagsby=20

recovered after her maid-of-all-work and I had burnt a few sheets of brown =
paper under her=20

nostrils; but I had great difficulty in making the peace.  In vain I pointe=
d out that the responsibility=20

did not remain with me, or even with Peter. We agreed after some debate tha=
t it was the German=20

band, which was never afterwards patronized by Mrs. Nagsby.  I got into fur=
ther trouble with Mrs.=20

Nagsby owing to a greyhound which I had bought at a sale. I had no characte=
r with him, for he had=20

no character. If Mrs. Nagsby had killed him with the meat hatchet I would h=
ave held my peace, for=20

never a day passed but King Arthur took his name in vain. The first night I=
 brought him home Mrs.=20

Nagsby gave me permission as a great favor to chain him to the kitchen tabl=
e. In the morning two=20

of the table legs had been mangled, and that is our reason why I called him=
 King Arthur, of the=20

Round Table. The next night King Arthur was taken upstairs and attached to =
the leg of my wash-

stand. I was awakened out of my beauty sleep by a horrible clamor which cau=
sed me to think that=20

the house had fallen in. I presently realized that King Arthur had mistaken=
 the water-jug for a=20

dragon. In any case it was smashed to bits, and the noise brought Mrs. Nags=
by to my door in=20

anger. I should be sorry to say what King Arthur cost me in hard cash for b=
reakages and legs of=20

mutton. Poor Peter! thou wast a saint when compared with that fiend on four=
 legs.  The=20

_denouement_ came at last, and it arose from King Arthur's fondness for the=
 ladies. There was=20

nothing remarkable in the appearance of the old lady who was Mrs. Nagsby's =
favorite lodger, who=20

had held the rooms above mine for three years. Rut the lady had a most beau=
tiful sealskin jacket,=20

trimmed with tails of sable. King Arthur had unluckily a feminine affection=
 for furs, and I never=20

dared to take him into any of the fashionable thoroughfares, as he had a wa=
y of following the=20

ladies, not for their own dear sakes, but for the fur which they might happ=
en to be wearing.=20

Whether they were only tippets or dyed rabbit-skins, it did not matter to K=
ing Arthur.  it, he would=20

probably have been frightened. But this sensation was unfamiliar to him. No=
t once in his whole=20

career had he hesitated to change gold from fear that the end of gold was a=
t hand.  All kinds of=20

problems crowded round him.  He went out for a stroll to escape the problem=
s. But they=20



accompanied him. He walked through exactly the same streets as had delighte=
d him in the=20

morning. And they had ceased to delight him. This surely could not be ideal=
 Putney that he was in!=20

It must be some other place of the same name. The mismanagement of a brewer=
y a hundred and=20

fifty miles from London; the failure of the British working-man to drink hi=
s customary pints in=20

several scattered scores of public-houses, had most unaccountably knocked t=
he bottom out of the=20

Putney system of practical philosophy. Putney posters were now merely disgu=
sting, Putney trade=20

gross and futile, the tobacconist a narrow-minded and stupid bourgeois; and=
 so on.  Alice and he=20

met on their doorstep, each in the act of pulling out a latchkey.  "Oh!" sh=
e said, when they were=20

inside, "it's done for! There's no mistake--it's done for! We shan't get a =
penny this year, not one=20

penny! And he doesn't think there'll be anything next year either! And the =
shares'll go down yet, he=20

says. I never heard of such a thing in all my life! Did you?"  He admitted =
sympathetically that he=20

had not.  After she had been upstairs and come down again her mood suddenly=
 changed. "Well,"=20

she smiled, "whether we get anything or not, it's tea-time. So we'll have t=
ea. I've no patience with=20

worrying. I said I should make pastry after tea, and I will too. See if I d=
on't!"  The tea was perhaps=20

slightly more elaborate than usual.  After tea he heard her singing in the =
kitchen. And he was=20

moved to go and look at her. There she was, with her sleeves turned back, a=
nd a large pinafore=20

apron over her rich bosom, kneading flour. He would have liked to approach =
her and kiss her. But=20

he never could accomplish feats of that kind at unusual moments.  "Oh!" she=
 laughed. "You can=20

look! _I'm_ not worrying. I've no patience with worrying."  Later in the af=
ternoon he went out; rather=20

like a person who has reasons for leaving inconspicuously. He had made a gr=
eat, a critical=20

resolve. He passed furtively down Werter Road into the High Street, and the=
n stood a moment=20

outside Stawley's stationery shop, which is also a library, an emporium of =
leather-bags, and an=20

artists'-colourman's. He entered Stawley's blushing, trembling--he a man of=
 fifty who could not see=20

his own toes--and asked for certain tubes of colour. An energetic young lad=
y who seemed to know=20

all about the graphic arts endeavoured to sell to him a magnificent and com=
plicated box of paints,=20

which opened out into an easel and a stool, and contained a palette of a sh=
ape preferred by the=20

late Edwin Long, R.A., a selection of colours which had been approved by th=
e late Lord Leighton,=20

P.R.A., and a patent drying-oil which (she said) had been used by Whistler.=
 Priam Farll got away=20

from the shop without this apparatus for the confection of masterpieces, bu=
t he did not get away=20

without a sketching-box which he had had no intention of buying. The young =
lady was too=20

energetic for him. He was afraid of being too curt with her lest she should=
 turn on him and tell him=20

that pretence was useless--she knew he was Priam Farll. He felt guilty, and=
 he felt that he looked=20

guilty. As he hurried along the High Street towards the river with the pain=
t-box it appeared to him=20

that policemen observed him inimically and cocked their helmets at him, as =
who should say: "See=20

here; this won't do. You're supposed to be in Westminster Abbey. You'll be =
locked up if you're too=20

brazen."  The tide was out. He sneaked down to=20


_
few yards in front of us was Mrs. Nagsby's first-floor lady, taking the sun=
 in all the glories of her=20

sealskin jacket and sable tails. To my horror I dropped the chain in taking=
 a match-box out of my=20

pocket, and before I could take any steps to prevent him--_King Arthur was =
coursing Mrs.=20

Nagsby's first-floor the steamer pier, and hid himself between the piles, g=
lancing around him in a=20

scared fashion. He might have been about to commit a crime. Then he opened =
the sketch-box,=20

and oiled the palette, and tried the elasticity of the brushes on his hand.=
 And he made a sketch of=20

the scene before him. He did it very=20


_
rate of speed!!!_ King Arthur held on his course and literally took the old=
 lady aback, and began to=20

tear those choice sable tippets asunder. Nor was the base creature content =
to rest at the sable=20

tippets. Before I reached his victim his mouth was full of sealskin. Let me=
 pass on, merely saying=20

that King Arthur was shot that night in the mews at the back of Mrs. thousa=
nds of such colour=20

'notes' in his life, and he would never part with any of them. He had alway=
s hated to part with his=20

notes. Doubtless his cousin Duncan had them now, if Duncan had discovered h=
is address in Paris,=20

as Duncan probably had.  When it was finished, he inspected the sketch, hal=
f shutting his eyes=20

and holding it about three feet off. It was good.=20


_
his own indiscretions.  And now I come to the fatal catastrophe which final=
ly drove me and Peter=20

from the shelter of Mrs. Nagsby's roof. That lady had a set of false teeth =
which she was in the=20

habit of depositing on her dressing-table when she went to bed. I had learn=
ed this from Sarah=20

when that damsel was in a confidential mood. Peter, I think I have told you=
, slept in my room. One=20

very warm night Mrs. Nagsby left her door open, and her night light was bur=
ning as usual. I also=20

slept with my door open, and Peter, being hot like the rest of us, left the=
 room for a stroll, and=20

visited Mrs. Nagsby's apartment. Presently he came back with Mrs. Nagsby's =
teeth between his=20

own--at least I pencil scrawls done in sheer absent-mindedness and hastily =
destroyed, this was=20

the first sketch he had made since the death of Henry Leek. But it was very=
 good. "No mistake=20

who's done that!" he murmured; and added: "That's the devil of it. Any expe=
rt would twig it in a=20

minute. There's only one man that could have done it. I shall have to do so=
mething worse than=20

that!" He shut up the box and with a bang as an amative couple came into si=
ght. He need not have=20

done so, for the couple vanished instantly in deep disgust at being robbed =
of their retreat between=20

the piles.  Alice was nearing the completion of pastry when he returned in =
the dusk; he smelt the=20

delicious proof. Creeping quietly=20


_
awoke. I was greatly amused, though a little puzzled to know how I could re=
place them. After=20

some reflection I went down to breakfast, placed the trophy in a saucer, an=
d showed it to Sarah,=20

who screamed and traitorously ran up and informed her mistress. Mrs. Nagsby=
 came down=20

rampant, but of course speechless. I was thankful for this; but the violent=
 woman, after sputtering=20

spasmodically, caught sight of the missing article in the saucer, and, lost=
 to all sense of shame,=20

replaced it in position and poured forth a torrent of the most violent abus=
e.  Peter and I left.    JEFF=20
