helped themselves to our nest, and have tried ever since to soil it.  The w=

explain much to those who are searching for truth and for truth only. They =
will show the origin of=20

certain rites in the Church inexplicable hitherto to the simple-minded, and=
 will give the reason why=20

such words as "Our Lord the Sun" were used in prayer by Christians up to th=
e fifth and even sixth=20

century of our era, and embodied in the Liturgy, until altered into "Our Lo=
rd, the God." Let us=20

remember that the early Christians painted Christ on the walls of their sub=
terranean necropolis, as=20

a shepherd in the guise of, and invested with all the attributes of Apollo,=
 driving away the wolf,=20

Fenris, who seeks to devour the Sun and his Satellites.      SECTION XXXVII=
I. ASTROLOGY AND=20

ASTROLATRY.   The books of Hermes Trismegistus contain the exoteric meaning=
, still veiled for=20

all but the Occultist, of the Astrology and Astrolatry of the Khaldi. The t=
wo subjects are closely=20

connected. Astrolatry, or the adoration of the heavenly host, is the natura=
l result of only half-=20

revealed Astrology, whose Adepts carefully concealed from the non- initiate=
d masses its Occult=20

principles and the wisdom imparted to them by the Regents of the Planets--t=
he "Angels." Hence,=20

divine Astrology for the Initiates; superstitious Astrolatry for the profan=
e. St. Justin asserts it:=20

From the first invention of the hieroglyphics it was not the     vulgar, bu=
t the distinguished and=20

select men who became initiated     in the secrecy of the temples into the =
science of every kind of=20

Astrology--even into its most abject kind: that Astrology which     later o=
n found itself prostituted in=20

the public thoroughfares.   There was a vast difference between the Sacred =
Science taught by=20

Petosiris and Necepso--the first Astrologers mentioned in the Egyptian manu=
scripts, believed to=20

have lived during the reign of Ramses II. (Sesostris)(622)--and the he was =
not dreaming and if that=20

marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the mo=
ment came for=20

action.  La Ramee sent away the guards, desiring them to drink to the duke'=
s health, and as soon=20

as they were gone shut all the doors, put the keys in his pocket and showed=
 the table to the prince=20

with an air that signified:  "Whenever my lord pleases."  The prince looked=
 at Grimaud, Grimaud=20

looked at the clock; it was hardly a quarter-past six. The escape was fixed=
 to take place at seven=20

o'clock; there was therefore three-quarters of an hour to wait.  The duke, =
in order to pass away=20

another quarter of an hour, pretended to be reading something that interest=
ed him and muttered=20

that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter. La Ramee went up=
 to him and looked=20

over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an=
 influence over the=20

prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner.  It was "Caesar's Commen=
taries," which La=20

Ramee had lent him, contrary to the orders of the governor; and La Ramee re=
solved never again=20

to disobey these injunctions.  Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to=
 smell if the pie was=20

good.  At half-past six the duke arose and said very gravely:  "Certainly, =
Caesar was the greatest=20

man of ancient times."  "You think so, my lord?" answered La Ramee.  "Yes."=
  "Well, as for me, I=20

prefer Hannibal."  "And why, pray, Master La Ramee?" asked the duke.  "Beca=
use he left no=20

Commentaries," replied La Ramee, with his coarse laugh.  The duke vouchsafe=
d no reply, but=20

sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself opp=
osite. There is=20

nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a =
well spread table, so La=20

Ramee, when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud, presented a type of p=
erfect bliss.  The=20

duke smiled.  "Zounds!" he said; "I don't suppose there is a more contented=
 man at this moment in=20

all the kingdom than yourself!"  "You are right, my lord duke," answered th=
e officer; "I don't=20


_
Divine Knowledge under the last Emperors of Rome. Indeed, one may fairly de=
scribe the two as=20

the "high ceremonial Astrology" and "astrological Astrolatry." The first de=
pended on the knowledge=20

by the Initiates of those (to us) immaterial Forces or Spiritual Entities t=
hat affect matter and guide=20

it. Called by the ancient Philosophers the Archontes and the Cosmocratores,=
 they were the types=20

or paradigms on the higher planes of the lower and more material beings on =
the scale of evolution,=20

whom we call Elementals and Nature-Spirits, to whom the Sabaeans bowed and =
whom they=20

worshipped, without suspecting the essential difference. Hence the latter k=
ind when not a mere=20

pretence, degenerated but too often into Black Magic. It was the favourite =
form of popular or=20

exoteric Astrology, entirely ignorant of the apotelesmatic principles of th=
e primitive Science, the=20

doctrines of which were imparted only at Initiation. Thus, while the real H=
ierophants soared like=20

Demi-Gods to the very summit of spiritual knowledge, the _hoi polloi_ among=
 the Sabaeans=20

crouched, steeped in superstition--ten millenniums back, as they do now--in=
 the cold and lethal=20

shadow of the valleys of matter. Sidereal influence is dual. There is the p=
hysical and physiological=20

influence, that of exotericism; and the high spiritual, intellectual, and m=
oral influence, imparted by=20

the knowledge of the planetary Gods. Bailly, speaking with only an imperfec=
t knowledge of the=20

former, called Astrology, so far back as the eighteenth century, "The very =
foolish mother of a very=20

wise daughter"--Astronomy. On the other hand, Arago, a luminary of the nine=
teenth century,=20

supports the reality of the sidereal influence of the Sun, Moon and Planets=
. He asks:       Where do=20

we find lunar influences refuted by arguments that     science would dare t=
o avow?   But even=20

Bailly, having, as he thought, put down Astrology as publicly practised, da=
res not do the same with=20

the real Astrology. He says:       Judiciary Astrology was at its origin th=
e result of a profound=20

system, the work of an enlightened nation that would wander too     far int=
o the mysteries of God=20

and Nature.   A Scientist of a more recent date, a member of the Institute =
of France, and a=20

professor of History, Ph. Lebas, discovers (unconsciously to himself) the v=
ery root of Astrology in=20

his able article on the subject in the _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique de Fran=
ce_. He well=20

understands, he tells his readers, that the adhesion to that Science of suc=
h a number of highly=20

intellectual men should be in itself a sufficient motive for believing that=
 all Astrology is not folly:=20

While proclaiming in politics the sovereignty of the people and of     publ=
ic opinion can we admit,=20

as heretofore, that mankind allowed     itself to be radically deceived in =
this only: that an absolute=20

and     gross absurdity reigned in the minds of whole nations for so many  =
   centuries without=20

being based on anything save--on one hand human     imbecility, and on the =
other charlatanry?=20

How for fifty centuries     and more can most men have been either dupes or=
 knaves? ... Even=20

though we may find it impossible to decide between and separate     the rea=
lities of Astrology from=20

the elements of invention and     empty dreaming in it, ... let us, neverth=
eless, repeat with=20

Bossuet and all modern philosophers, that "nothing that has been     domina=
nt could be absolutely=20

false." Is it not true, at all     events, that there is a physical reactio=
n on one another among the=20

planets? Is it not again true, that the planets have an influence     on th=
e atmosphere, and=20

consequently at any rate a mediate action     on vegetation and animals? Ha=
s not modern science=20

demonstrated now     these two points beyond any doubt?... Is it any less t=
rue that     human liberty=20

of action is not absolute: that all is bound, that     all weighs, planets =
as the rest, on each individual=20

will; that     Providence [_or Karma_] acts on us and directs men through t=
hose     relations that it=20

has established between them and the visible     objects and the whole univ=
erse?... Astrolatry, in=20



its essence, is     nothing but that; we are bound to recognise that an ins=
tinct     superior to the age=20

they lived in guided the efforts of the     ancient Magi. As to the materia=
lism and annihilation of=20

human     moral freedom with which Bailly charges their theory (Astrology),=
     the reprobate has no=20

sense whatever. All the great astrologers     admitted, without one single =
exception, that man could=20

react     against the influence of the stars. This principle is established=
     in the Ptolemoeian=20

_Tetrabiblos_, the true astrological Scriptures,     in chapters ii. and ii=
i. of book i.(623)   Thomas=20

Aquinas had corroborated Lebas in anticipation; he says:       The celestia=
l bodies are _the cause=20

of all that happens in this     sublunary world_, they act indirectly on hu=
man actions; but not     all=20

the effects produced by them are unavoidable.(624)   The Occultists and The=
osophists are the first=20

to confess that there is white and black Astrology. Nevertheless, Astrology=
 has to be studied in=20

both aspects by those who wish to become proficient in it; and the good or =
bad results obtained do=20

not depend upon the principles, which are the same in both kinds, but in th=
e Astrologer himself.=20

Thus Pythagoras, who established the whole Copernican system by the Books p=
leasanter sight on=20

earth than a well covered table; and when, added to that, he who does the h=
onors is the grandson=20

of Henry IV., you will, my lord duke, easily comprehend that the honor fair=
ly doubles the pleasure=20

one enjoys."  The duke, in his turn, bowed, and an imperceptible smile appe=
ared on the face of=20

Grimaud, who kept behind La Ramee.  "My dear La Ramee," said the duke, "you=
 are the only man=20

to turn such faultless compliments."  "No, my lord duke," replied La Ramee,=
 in the fullness of his=20

heart; "I say what I think; there is no compliment in what I say to you----=
"  "Then you are attached=20

to me?" asked the duke.  "To own the truth, I should be inconsolable if you=
 were to leave=20

Vincennes."  "A droll way of showing your affliction." The duke meant to sa=
y "affection."  "But, my=20

lord," returned La Ramee, "what would you do if you got out? Every folly yo=
u committed would=20

embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile, instead=
 of Vincennes. Now,=20

Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable, I allow, but Monsieur du Tremblay is c=
onsiderably worse."=20

"Indeed!" exclaimed the duke, who from time to time looked at the clock, th=
e fingers of which=20

seemed to move with sickening slowness.  "But what can you expect from the =
brother of a=20

capuchin monk, brought up in the school of Cardinal Richelieu? Ah, my lord,=
 it is a great=20

happiness that the queen, who always wished you well, had a fancy to send y=
ou here, where=20

there's a promenade and a tennis court, good air, and a good table."  "In s=
hort," answered the=20

duke, "if I comprehend you aright, La Ramee, I am ungrateful for having eve=
r thought of leaving=20

this place?"  "Oh! my lord duke, 'tis the height of ingratitude; but your h=
ighness has never seriously=20

thought of it?"  "Yes," returned the duke, "I must confess I sometimes thin=
k of it."  "Still by one of=20

your forty methods, your highness?"  "Yes, yes, indeed."  "My lord," said L=
a Ramee, "now we are=20

quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves, pray tell me one of those forty w=
ays invented by your=20

highness."  "Willingly," answered the duke, "give me the pie!"  "I am liste=
ning," said La Ramee,=20

leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of Madeira to his lips, =
and winking his eye that=20

he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste.  T=
he duke glanced at the=20

clock. In ten minutes it would strike seven.  Grimaud placed the pie before=
 the duke, who took a=20

knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust; but La Ramee, who was a=
fraid of any harm=20

happening to this fine work of art, passed his knife, which had an iron bla=
de, to the duke.  "Thank=20

you, La Ramee," said the prisoner.  "Well, my lord! this famous invention o=
f yours?"  "Must I tell=20

you," replied the duke, "on what I most reckon and what I determine to try =
first?"  "Yes, that's the=20



thing, my lord!" cried his custodian, gaily.  "Well, I should hope, in the =
first instance, to have for=20

keeper an honest fellow like you."  "And you have me, my lord. Well?"  "Hav=
ing, then, a keeper like=20

La Ramee, I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or oth=
er a man who would=20

be devoted to me, who would assist me in my flight."  "Come, come," said La=
 Ramee, "that's not a=20

bad idea."  "Capital, isn't it? for instance, the former servingman of some=
 brave gentleman, an=20

enemy himself to Mazarin, as every gentleman ought to be."  "Hush! don't le=
t us talk politics, my=20

lord."  "Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon hi=
m, and I should have=20

news from those without the prison walls."  "Ah, yes! but how can the news =
be brought to you?"=20

"Nothing easier; in a game of tennis, for example."  "In a game of tennis?"=
 asked La Ramee, giving=20

more serious attention to the duke's words.  "Yes; see, I send a ball into =
the moat; a man is there=20

who picks it up; the ball contains a letter. Instead of returning the ball =
to me when I call for it from=20

the top of the wall, he throws me another; that other ball contains a lette=
r. Thus we have=20

exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it."  "The devil it does! The dev=
il it does!" said La=20

Ramee, scratching his head; "you are in the wrong to tell me that, my lord.=
 I shall have to watch=20

the men who pick up balls."  The duke smiled.  "But," resumed La Ramee, "th=
at is only a way of=20

corresponding."  "And that is a great deal, it seems to me."  "But not enou=
gh."  "Pardon me; for=20

instance, I say to my friends, Be on a certain day, on a certain hour, at t=
he other side of the moat=20

with two horses."  "Well, what then?" La Ramee began to be uneasy; "unless =
the horses have=20

wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you."  "That's not needed. I=
 have," replied the=20

duke, "a way of descending from the ramparts."  "What?"  "A rope ladder."  =
"Yes, but," answered=20

La Ramee, trying to laugh, "a ladder of ropes can't be sent around a ball, =
like a letter."  "No, but it=20

may be sent in something else."  "In something else--in something else? In =
what?"  "In a pate, for=20

example."  "In a pate?" said La Ramee.  "Yes. Let us suppose one thing," re=
plied the duke "let us=20

suppose, for instance, that my maitre d'hotel, Noirmont, has purchased the =
shop of Pere Marteau--

--"  "Well?" said La Ramee, shuddering.  "Well, La Ramee, who is a gourmand=
, sees his pates,=20

thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me t=
hat I shall try them. I=20

consent on condition that La Ramee=20


_
before Galileo's predecessor was born, found and studied in them the whole =
Science of divine=20

Theogony, of the communication with, and the evocation of, the world's Rect=
ors--the Princes of=20

the "Principalities" of St. Paul--the nativity of each Planet and of the Un=
iverse itself, the formulae of=20

incantations and the consecration of each portion of the human body to the =
respective Zodiacal=20

sign corresponding to it. All this cannot be regarded as childish and absur=
d--still less "devilish"--

save by those who are, and wish to remain, tyros in the Philosophy of the O=
ccult Sciences. No=20

true thinker--no one who recognises the presence of a common bond between m=
an and visible, as=20

well as invisible, Nature--would see in the old relics of Archaic Wisdom--s=
uch as the _Petemenoph=20

Papyrus_, for instance--"childish nonsense and absurdity," as many Academic=
ians and Scientists=20

have done. But upon finding in such ancient documents the application of th=
e Hermetic rules and=20

laws, such as       The consecration of one's hair to the celestial Nile; o=
f the left     temple to the=20

living Spirit in the sun, and in the right one to     the spirit of Ammon, =
  he will endeavour to study=20

and comprehend better the "laws of correspondences." Nor will he disbelieve=
 in the antiquity of=20

Astrology on the plea that some Orientalists have thought fit to declare th=
at the Zodiac was not=20

very ancient, being only the invention of the Greeks of the Macedonian peri=
od. For this statement,=20

besides having been shown to be entirely erroneous by a number of other rea=
sons, may be=20

entirely disproved by facts relating to the latest discoveries in Egypt, an=
d by the more accurate=20

readings of hieroglyphics and inscriptions of the earliest dynasties. The p=
ublished polemics on the=20

contents of the so-called "Magic" Papyri of the Anastasi collection indicat=
e the antiquity of the=20

Zodiac. As the _Lettres a Lettrone_ say: The papyri discourse at length upo=
n the four bases or=20

Foundations of the world, the identity of which it is impossible,     accor=
ding to Champollion, to=20

mistake, as one is forced to     recognise in them the Pillars of the World=
 of St. Paul. It is they=20

who are invoked with the gods of all the celestial zones, quite     analogo=
us, once more, to the=20

_Spiritualia nequitiae in caelestibus_     of the same Apostle.(625)      T=
hat invocation was made in=20

the proper terms ... of the formula,     reproduced far too faithfully by J=
amblichus for it to be=20

possible     to refuse him any longer the we may be more at our ease, La Ra=
mee removes the=20

guards, keeping only Grimaud to wait on us. Grimaud is the man whom a frien=
d has sent to=20

second me in everything. The moment for my escape is fixed--seven o'clock. =
Well, at a few=20

minutes to seven----"  "At a few minutes to seven?" cried La Ramee, cold sw=
eat upon his brow.=20

"At a few minutes to seven," returned the duke (suiting the action to the w=
ords), "I raise the crust=20

of the pie; I find in it two poniards, a ladder of rope, and a gag. I point=
 one of the poniards at La=20

Ramee's breast and I say to him, 'My friend, I am sorry for it, but if thou=
 stirrest, if thou utterest one=20

cry, thou art a dead man!'"  The duke, in pronouncing these words, suited, =
as we have said, the=20

action to the words. He was standing near the officer and he directed the p=
oint of the poniard in=20

such a manner, close to La Ramee's heart, that there could be no doubt in t=
he mind of that=20

individual as to his determination. Meanwhile, Grimaud, still mute as ever,=
 drew from the pie the=20

other poniard, the rope ladder and the gag.  La Ramee followed all these ob=
jects with his eyes, his=20

alarm every moment increasing.  "Oh, my lord," he cried, with an expression=
 of stupefaction in his=20

face; "you haven't the heart to kill me!"  "No; not if thou dost not oppose=
 my flight."  "But, my lord, if=20

I allow you to escape I am a ruined man."  "I will compensate thee for the =
loss of thy place."  "You=20

are determined to leave the chateau?"  "By Heaven and earth! This night I a=
m determined to be=20

free."  "And if I defend myself, or call, or cry out?"  "I will kill thee, =
on the honor of a gentleman."  At=20



this moment the clock struck.  "Seven o'clock!" said Grimaud, who had not s=
poken a word.  La=20

Ramee made one movement, in order to satisfy his conscience. The duke frown=
ed, the officer felt=20

the point of the poniard, which, having penetrated through his clothes, was=
 close to his heart.  "Let=20

us dispatch," said the duke.  "My lord, one last favor."  "What? speak, mak=
e haste."  "Bind my=20

arms, my lord, fast."  "Why bind thee?"  "That I may not be considered as y=
our accomplice."  "Your=20

hands?" asked Grimaud.  "Not before me, behind me."  "But with what?" asked=
 the duke.  "With=20

your belt, my lord!" replied La Ramee.  The duke undid his belt and gave it=
 to Grimaud, who tied=20

La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy him.  "Your feet, too," said Grimaud. =
 La Ramee stretched=20

out his legs, Grimaud took a table-cloth, tore it into strips and tied La R=
amee's feet together.=20


_
posterity the ancient and primitive spirit of the Egyptian     Astrologers.=
(626)   As Letronne had=20

tried to prove that all the genuine Egyptian Zodiacs had been manufactured =
during the Roman=20

period, the Sensaos mummy is brought forward to show that:       All the Zo=
diacal monuments in=20

Egypt were chiefly astronomical.     Royal tombs and funereal rituals are s=
o many tables of=20

constellations and of their influences for all the hours of every     month=
.      Thus the genethliac=20

tables themselves prove that they are far     older than the period assigne=
d to their origin; all the=20

Zodiacs of     the sarcophagi of later epochs being simple reminiscences of=
 the     Zodiacs=20

belonging to the mythological [archaic] period.   Primitive Astrology was a=
s far above modern=20

judiciary Astrology, so- called, as the guides (the Planets and Zodiacal si=

oon), and only "the=20

twelve lords of the Zodiacal Gods," the "thirty-six Gods Counsellors" and t=
he "twenty-four Stars,=20

judges of this world," which support and guide the Universe (our solar syst=
em), watch over mortals=20

Eternal commissioned by him to announce his will     to mortals]; the ascen=
sion or conjunction of=20

the planet at the     moment of ask for it; without it I should be tried in=
 a court of justice because I=20

did not raise the alarm. Thrust it into my mouth, my lord, thrust it in."  =
Grimaud prepared to comply=20

with this request, when the officer made a sign as if he had something to s=
ay.  "Speak," said the=20

duke.  "Now, my lord, do not forget, if any harm happens to me on your acco=
unt, that I have a wife=20

and four children."  "Rest assured; put the gag in, Grimaud."  In a second =
La Ramee was gagged=20

and laid prostrate. Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had be=
en a struggle. Grimaud=20

then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and firs=
t opened the door of the=20

room in which they were, then shut it and double-locked it, and both he and=
 the duke proceeded=20

rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure. At last they re=
ached the tennis court. It=20

was completely deserted. No sentinels, no one at any of the windows. The du=
ke ran to the rampart=20

and perceived on the other side of the ditch, three cavaliers with two ridi=
ng horses. The duke=20

exchanged a signal with them. It was indeed for him that they were there.  =
Grimaud, meantime,=20

undid the means of escape.  This was not, however, a rope ladder, but a bal=
l of silk cord, with a=20

narrow board which was to pass between the legs, the ball to unwind itself =
by the weight of the=20

person who sat astride upon the board.  "Go!" said the duke.  "First, my lo=
rd?" inquired Grimaud.=20

"Certainly. If I am caught, I risk nothing but being taken back again to pr=
ison. If they catch thee,=20

thou wilt be hung."  "True," replied Grimaud.  And instantly,=20

moment and mode of his death.(627)   Every student of Occultism knows that =
the heavenly bodies=20

are closely related during each Manvantara with the mankind of that special=
 cycle; and there are=20

some who believe that each great character born during that period has--as =
every other mortal=20

has, only in a far stronger degree--his destiny outlined within his proper =
constellation or star,=20

traced as a self-prophecy, an anticipated autobiography, by the indwelling =
Spirit of that particular=20

star. The human Monad in its first beginning is that Spirit, or the Soul of=
 that star (Planet) itself. As=20

our Sun radiates its light and beams on every body in space within the boun=
daries of its system,=20

so the Regent of every Planet-star, the Parent-monad, shoots out from itsel=
f the Monad of every=20

"pilgrim" Soul born under its house within its own group. The Regents are e=
soterically seven,=20

whether in the Sephiroth, the "Angels of the Presence," the Rishis, or the =
Amshaspends. "The=20

had gone down about=20

three-quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke. Grimaud fell-=

moat.  The duke uttered a cry, but Grimaud did not give a single moan. He m=
ust have been=20

dreadfully hurt, for he did not stir from the place where he fell.  Immedia=
tely one of the men who=20

were waiting slipped down into the moat, tied under Grimaud's shoulders the=
 end of a cord, and=20

the remaining two, who held the other end, drew Grimaud to them.  "Descend,=
 my lord," said the=20

man in the moat. "There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here, =
and the grass is soft."=20

The duke had already begun to descend. His task was the more difficult, as =
there was no board to=20

support him. He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a hei=
ght of fifty feet. But as=20

we have said he was active, strong, and full of presence of mind. In less t=
han five minutes he=20

arrived at the end of the cord. He was then only fifteen feet from the grou=
nd, as the gentlemen=20

below had told him. He let go the rope and fell upon=20

Daniel, the last of the Jewish Initiates of the old school, became the chie=
f of the Magi and=20

Astrologers of Chaldaea. In those days even Egypt, who had her wisdom from =
the same source as=20

Babylon, had degenerated from her former grandeur, and her glory had begun =
to fade out. Still,=20

the science of old had left her eternal imprint on the world, and the seven=

the duke, "I will thank=20

you later; now we have not a moment to lose. On, then! on! those who love m=
