dracaena marginata to illustrate Bairnsfather's cartoons.  [Illustration: "Well now, Sir, you wouldn't be wearing those brown shoes to Lord Bryce's tea, would you, Mr. White?"]  A soldier comes splashing down the trench. His comrade cries, leave their hammocks, and we were obliged to send in search of cassava-bread, the most indispensable food of the country, to the independent but neighbouring tribe of the Piraoas. We had hitherto escaped these malignant dracaena marginata to illustrate Bairnsfather's cartoons.

and hundreds of thousands of Londoners are hunting taxis at eleven at night, and they are hard to 

catch. So we generally had the fun of walking back to Brook Street in the dark. And it is dark in 

London toward midnight. Paris is merely gloomy. Rome is a bit somber, but London is as black as 

the inside of your hat. For London has been bombed and bombed by the German airmen, until 

London in the prevailing mist which threatens fog becomes mere murk. Night after night we 

wandered the crooked streets inquiring our way of strangers, some of whom were worse lost than 

we; one a state of nature, are strongly attached to the spots where the bones of their fathers 

repose. This feeling, which a great writer has beautifully painted in the episode of Atala, is 

cherished in all its primitive ardour by the Chinese. These people among whom everything is the 

produce of art, or rather of the most ancient civilization, do not change their dwelling without 

carrying along with them the bones of their ancestors. Coffins are seen deposited on the banks of 

great rivers, to be transported, with the furniture of the family, to a remote province. These 

removals of bones, heretofore more common among the savages of North America, are not 

practised among the

Leicester Square; and then got lost ourselves finding Piccadilly and Regent Street! So that 

whenever we went out after dinner we were never without dramatic excitement, even if it was not 

adequately supplied by the show. The London taste in shows seems to sheer away from the war. 

In the autumn last past but two shows had a war motive: One "General Post," a story of the fall of 

caste from English life during the war, telling how a tailor became a general; the other "The Better 

'Ole," a farce comedy, with a few musical skits in it, staged entirely "at the front." "The Better 'Ole" 

could be put on in any American town and the fun would raise the roof! There is no story to it; the 

Guiana; but these are not nomad, like nations who live exclusively by hunting.  We stayed at the 

mission of Atures only during the time necessary for passing the canoe through the Great 

Cataract. The bottom of our frail bark had become so thin that it required great care to prevent it 

from splitting. We took leave of the missionary, Bernardo Zea, who remained at Atures, after 

having accompanied us during two months, and shared all our sufferings. This poor monk still 

continued to have fits of tertian ague; they had become to him an habitual evil, to which he paid 

little attention. Other fevers of a more fatal kind prevailed at Atures on our second visit. The
