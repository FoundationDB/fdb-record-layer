philodendron monstera       Your friendship stains, and mocks my sinlessnes=
s,     You woman-murderer! How could I be     A friend to one whom women ev=
er see       With eyes half-closed in apprehension's stress?            42 =
 [_Mournfully._] Vasantasena,      When thou, sweet maid, art born again,  =
     Be not a courtezan reborn,     But in a house which sinless men,      =
 And virtuous, and good, adorn.                             43  _Sansthanak=
a._ Firsht you murder and the grace, freedom, and spontaneity of the verse.=
  The first six books of the _Fables_ appeared in 1668; the next five in tw=
o parts, in 1678 and 1679; the twelfth and last book in 1694. When the _Psy=
che_ was published, soon after the first group of the _Fables_, the prose a=
nd verse were placed in a graceful setting, which tells of the converse of =
the author with his friends Boileau, Racine, and Moliere (or possibly Chape=
lle) in the midst of the philodendron monstera       Your friendship stains=
, and mocks my sinlessness,     You woman-murderer! How could I be     A fr=

          43  _Sansthanaka._ Firsht you murder and the grace, freedom, and =
spontaneity of the verse.  The first six books of the _Fables_ appeared in =
1668; the next five in two parts, in 1678 and 1679; the twelfth and last bo=
ok in 1694. When the _Psyche_ was published, soon after the first group of =
the _Fables_, the prose and verse were placed in a graceful setting, which =
tells of the converse of the author with his friends Boileau, Racine, and M=
oliere (or possibly Chapelle) in the midst of the _
heroic deed of Sansthanaka, the king's brother-in-law. [_He points out the =
body._]  _Courtier._=20

Alas! Ah, woe is me! [_He falls in a swoon._]  _Sansthanaka._ Hee, hee! The=
 gentleman is calm=20

enough now!  _Sthavaraka._ Oh, sir! Come to yourself! I am the first murder=
er, for I brought the=20

bullock-cart hither without looking into it.  _Courtier._ [_Comes to himsel=
f. Mournfully._] Alas,=20

Vasantasena!      The stream of courtesy is dried away,       And happiness=
 to her own land doth=20

flee,     Sweet gem of gems, that knew love's gentle play,       Love's mar=
t and beauty's! Joy of=20

men like me!     Thy of the disgraced minister. As a consequence, the poet =
retired for a time from=20

Paris to banishment at Limoges. But in 1664 he is again in Paris or at Chat=
eau-Thierry, his native=20

place, where the Duchesse de Bouillon, niece of Mazarin, young, gay, pleasu=
re-loving, bestowed=20

on him a kind protection. His tedious paraphrase of _Psyche_, and the poem =
_Quinquina_, in=20

which he celebrates the recovery from illness of the Duchess, were performa=
nces of duty and=20

gratitude rather than of native impulse; but the tendencies of her salon, r=
estrained neither by the=20

proprieties of the classical doctrine in=20


_
Alas! is perished, lost, and gone forever!                   38  [_Tearfull=
y._] Ah, woe is me!      What sin=20

is yet to come, or woe,       Now thou hast done this deed of hate?     Lik=
e sin's foul self, hast thou=20

laid low       The sinless goddess of our state.                          3=

wretch means to lay this sin to my charge. I must go hence. [_He walks abou=
t. Sansthanaka=20

approaches and holds him back._] Scoundrel! Touch me not. I have done with =
you. I go.=20

_Sansthanaka._ Aha! Firsht you murder Vasantasena, then you abuse me, and n=
ow where will=20

you run to? And sho a man like me has n't anybody to protect him.  [131.8. =
S.  _Courtier._ You are=20

an accursed scoundrel!  _Sansth._      I'll give you countless wealth, a pi=
ece of gold,     A copper,=20

and a cap, to have and hold.     And sho the fame of thish great deed shall=
 be     A common=20

property, and shan't touch me.                      40  _Courtier._ A curse=
 upon you! of religious=20

strictness, may have encouraged him to the production of his _Contes_.  In =
Paris, from 1661 to=20

1664 joyous meetings took place in Boileau's rooms in the Rue du Colombier =
of a distinguished=20

group, which included Moliere, Chapelle, Racine, and La Fontaine. La Fontai=
ne, the=20

_bonhomme_, who escaped from the toil of conversation which did not interes=
t him in shy or=20

indolent taciturnity, could be a charming talker with companions of his cho=
ice. Probably to=20

Boileau's urgency is due the first original publication of La Fontaine, a l=
ittle volume of _Nouvelles=20

en Vers_ (1664-1665), containing the _Joconde_, a tale from Ariosto, and a =
comic story versified=20

from Boccaccio. Almost immediately there followed a collection of ten _Cont=
es_, with the author's=20

name upon the title-page, and at various later dates were published added t=
ales, until five parts=20

completed the series. The success was great, but great also was the scandal=
, for the=20

_bonhomme_, drawing=20


_
_Sthavaraka._ Heaven avert the omen! [_Sansthanaka bursts out laughing._]  =
_Courtier._      Be=20

enmity between us! Cease your mirth!     Damned be a friendship that so sha=
mes my worth!=20

Never may I set eyes on one so low!     I fling you off, an unstrung, broke=
n bow.                    41=20

_Sansthanaka._ Don't be angry. Come, let's go and play in the pond.  _Court=
ier._      Unstained=20

my life, and yet it seems to me Rabelais, Petronius, Athenaeus, and other s=
ources, had exhibited=20

no more regard for decency than that which bestows the graces of lightness,=
 brightness, wit, and=20

gaiety upon indecency. His unabashed apology was that the artistic laws of =
the _conte_ obliged=20

him to decline the laws of modesty; and among those who applauded his tales=
 were the Duchess=20

de Bouillon and Mme. de Sevigne. It is indeed impossible not to applaud=20
