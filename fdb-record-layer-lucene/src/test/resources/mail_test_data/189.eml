and when the diocesan authorities went to make the arrest, quite a crowd of people had collected 

to see the outcome of the ecclesiastical duel. The appearance of the Dean, being conducted by 

force to answer to the Bishop for disobedience that had been prompted by his compliance to the 

Spaniards' desires, provoked a demonstration in his favour.  He, seeing his opportunity, began to 

call for help, crying: "Help me to get free, gentlemen, and I'll confess everybody! Get me free and 

I'll absolve all of you!" A great hubbub ensued; men armed themselves to attack the Bishop's 

alguacil; some barricaded the Dominicans in their convent to prevent their coming to the 

assistance of the arresting party, others freed the Dean from his captors, and thus, with great 

uproar and shouts for the King and his justice against the Bishop, the mob arrived at the latter's 

house, into which a crowd forced its way with clamorous disorder.  A gentleman named Rodriguez 

de Villafuerte, who was in the ante-chamber in company with Fray Domingo de Medinilla, 

managed to somewhat calm the turbulence of the people.  The leaders of the mob burst into the 

room beyond, where Fray Domingo had insisted that the Bishop should remain, instead of coming 

out to face the rioters as he wished, insulting him in the coarsest language and even threatening to 

kill him.  The storm of popular fury broke itself against the imperturbable serenity and inflexible 

determination with which Las Casas met and dominated it. Though the crowd dispersed, cowed 

and sullen, to their houses, the murmuring continued, and the friars dared not leave their 

convents, for fear of provoking a fresh outbreak.  The Bishop cancelled the ecclesiastical faculties 

of his Dean and excommunicated him.  The man who had threatened to kill Las Casas was the 

same one who had once before fired a musket shot through the Bishop's window, by way of 

warning him, and as he was known for a hot-headed reckless person, the friars were seriously 

apprehensive lest he might execute his threat; they begged Las Casas to leave and go to a place 

of safety.  "Where," he asked in reply, "would you, Fathers, have me go?  Where shall I be safe as 

long as I act in behalf of these poor creatures?  Were the cause mine, I would drop it with 

pleasure, but it is that of my flock, of these miserable Indians, wearied and oppressed by unjust 

slavery and insupportable tributes, which others of my flock have imposed upon them.  Here I wish 

to remain; this church is my spouse, it is not mine to abandon.  This is the purpose of my 

residence [here].  I wish to irrigate it with my blood, if they take my life, so that zeal for God's 

service may be absorbed by the very ground I hold, to make it fertile, to bring forth the fruit of 

desire--the end of the injustice that stains and infects it.  This is my wish, this is my determined 

resolve, and I shall not be so fortunate that God will permit the inhabitants of this city to fulfil it; 

other times have I found myself in greater dangers and, because of my unworthiness, God has 

withheld from me the crown of martyrdom.  These disturbances, and the hatred of the conquerors 

for me, are of ancient date; I no longer feel their insults nor fear their threats, and in comparison 

with what has happened to me in Spain and the Indies, those of the other day were very 

moderate."  Against such steadfast resolution, the colonists could not hope to prevail, and one of 

the first results of the violent attack upon the Bishop, was a certain reaction in public sentiment 

when calmer Judgment reasserted itself.  There was even some counter demonstration, and the 

news was brought to Las Casas that the man who had threatened to kill him had himself been 

badly mauled and beaten.  The Bishop was the first and most assiduous of the injured man's 

visitors, even preparing with his own hands, bandages and ointments to dress his hurts.  Such 

charity and abnegation could not but touch even the rude object of these attentions, and after 



repeatedly begging the Bishop's forgiveness for his recent violence, the man attached himself to 

him from thenceforth, and became one of his warmest defenders.  Nevertheless, the attacks on 

the Bishop and on the friars did not lessen for long, nor was the resentment against them 

diminished amongst the greater number of the colonists, who pushed their reprisals to such an 

extent that, not only were the priests reduced to the barest necessities of life, but even wine for the 

celebration of mass was wanting and unobtainable.  To remedy this necessity, Indians were sent 

out into the province to beg for the friars, but the Spaniards learned of this measure and, after 

forbidding the natives to give them anything, they seized whatever these messengers obtained in 

spite of the prohibition, and gave them a sound beating as a preventive of any future excursions. 

Existence in such surroundings was no longer possible, and the friars resolved to leave Ciudad 

Real.  They sent out four of their number in advance, after which Fray Tomas de la Torre 

announced from the pulpit their intention to abandon the convent and the reasons which forced 

them to go.  Learning from those who had gone ahead that they had been well received in Chiapa, 

and that everything seemed propitious for the foundation of a convent there, the community 

prepared to follow.  Before definitely abandoning Ciudad Real, it was thought well to deliver a final 

address to the people, explaining clearly and fully the righteousness of their doctrine concerning 

slavery.  This discourse was pronounced by Fray Alonso de Villabra, who cited many authorities to 

show that the iniquity of slavery was beyond dispute and that it was condemned by the laws of 

God and man alike.  The sermon failed to convince the hostile and unwilling listeners, whose 

interests were bound up in slavery, and the only result of this last well-meant effort was to 

intensify, if possible, the irritation against the Bishop and the friars.  The reception of this 

interesting band of apostolic men by the people of Chiapa, was in striking contrast to the menacing 

demonstrations which provoked and accompanied their departure from Ciudad Real.  More than a 

league outside the town, the exiles found a large number of Indians, decked out in their best gold 

ornaments and plumes, carrying crosses made of feathers and flowers, awaiting their arrival, to 

escort them to the quarters prepared for them.  As soon as the Bishop was housed, an immense 

number of natives came from all parts of the neighbourhood, begging to be taught the Christian 

religion.  The joy child.  By to-morrow I shall have decided; but, indeed, I have already decided to 

make the journey, hard as it is to leave much that is here. Do not fear, dear!  but you are too 

tender for such a journey, and to such a distance; I might--"  "No, no," cried Nefert.  "I am going, 

too, if you were going to the four pillars of heaven, at the limits of the earth.  You have given me a 

new life, and the little sprout that is green within me would wither again if I had to return to my 

mother.  Only she or I can be in our house, and I will re-enter it only with Mena."  "It is settled--I 

must go," said the princess.  "Oh! if only my father were not so far off, and that I could consult 

him!"  "Yes! the war, and always the war!"  sighed Nefert.  "Why do not men rest content with what 

they have, and prefer the quiet peace, which makes life lovely, to idle fame?"  "Would they be 

men? should we love them?"  cried Bent-Anat eagerly. "Is not the mind of the Gods, too, bent on 

war?  Did you ever see a more sublime sight than Pentaur, on that evening when he brandished 

the stake he had pulled up, and exposed his life to protect an innocent girl who was in danger?"  "I 

dared not once look down into the court," said Nefert.  "I was in such an agony of mind.  But his 

loud cry still rings in my ears."  "So rings the war cry of heroes before whom the enemy quails!" 

exclaimed Bent-Anat.  "Aye, truly so rings the war cry!"  said prince Rameri, who had entered his 



sister's half-dark room unperceived by the two women.  The princess turned to the boy.  "How you 

frightened me!"  she said.  "You!"  said Rameri astonished.  "Yes, me.  I used to have a stout 

heart, but since that evening I frequently tremble, and an agony of terror comes over me, I do not 

know why.  I believe some demon commands me."  "You command, wherever you go; and no one 

commands you," cried Rameri. "The excitement and tumult in the valley, and on the quay, still 

agitate you.  I grind my teeth myself when I remember how they turned me out of the school, and 

how Paaker set the dog at us.  I have gone through a great deal today too."  "Where were you so 

long?"  asked Bent-Anat.  "My uncle Ani commanded that you should not leave the palace."  "I 

shall be eighteen years old next month," said the prince, "and need no tutor."  "But your father--" 

said Bent-Anat.  "My father"--interrupted the boy, "he little knows the Regent.  But I shall write to 

him what I have today heard said by different people. They were to have sworn allegiance to Ani 

at that very feast in the valley, and it is quite openly said that Ani is aiming at the throne, and 

intends to depose the king.  You are right, it is madness--but there must be something behind it 

all."  Nefert turned pale, and Bent-Anat asked for particulars.  The prince repeated all he had 

gathered, and added laughing: "Ani depose my father! It is as if I tried to snatch the star of Isis 

from the sky to light the lamps--which are much wanted here."  "It is more comfortable in the dark," 

said Nefert.  "No, let us have lights," said Bent-Anat.  "It is better to talk when we can see each 

other face to face.  I have no belief in the foolish talk of the people; but you are right--we must 

bring it to my fathers knowledge."  "I heard the wildest gossip in the City of the Dead," said 

Rameri.  "You ventured over there?  How very wrong!"  "I disguised myself a little, and I have good 

news for you.  Pretty Uarda is much better.  She received your present, and they have a house of 

their own again.  Close to the one that was burnt down, there was a tumbled-down hovel, which 

her father soon put together again; he is a bearded soldier, who is as much like her as a hedgehog 

is like a white dove.  I offered her to work in the palace for you with the other girls, for good wages, 

but she would not; for she has to wait on her sick grandmother, and she is proud, and will not 

serve any one."  "It seems you were a long time with the paraschites' people," said Bent- Anat 

reprovingly.  "I should have thought that what has happened to me might have served you as a 

warning."  "I will not be better than you!"  cried the boy.  "Besides, the paraschites is dead, and 

Uarda's father is a respectable soldier, who can defile no one.  I kept a long way from the old 

woman.  To-morrow I am going again.  I promised her."  "Promised who?"  asked his sister.  "Who 

but Uarda?  She loves flowers, and since the rose which you gave her she has not seen one.  I 

have ordered the gardener to cut me a basket full of roses to-morrow morning, and shall take them 

to her myself."  "That you will not!"  cried Bent-Anat.  "You are still but half a child-- and, for the 

girl's sake too, you must give it up."  "We only gossip together," said the prince coloring, "and no 

one shall recognize me.  But certainly, if you mean that, I will leave the basket of roses, and go to 

her alone.  No--sister, I will not be forbidden this; she is so charming, so white, so gentle, and her 

voice is so soft and sweet!  And she has little feet, as small as--what shall I say?--as small and 

graceful as Nefert's hand.  We talked most about Pentaur.  She knows his father, who is a 

gardener, and knows a great deal about him.  Only think! she says the poet cannot be the son of 

his parents, but a good spirit that has come down on earth--perhaps a God.  At first she was very 

timid, but when I spoke of Pentaur she grew eager; her reverence for him is almost idolatry--and 

that vexed me."  "You would rather she should reverence you so," said Nefert smiling.  "Not at all," 



cried Rameri.  "But I helped to save her, and I am so happy when I am sitting with her, that to-

morrow, I am resolved, I will put a flower in her hair.  It is red certainly, but as thick as yours, Bent- 

Anat, and it must be delightful to unfasten it and stroke it."  The ladies exchanged a glance of 

intelligence, and the princess said decidedly:  "You will not go to the City of the Dead to-morrow, 

my little son!"  "That we will see, my little mother!"  He answered laughing; then he turned grave. 

"I saw my school-friend Anana too," he said.  "Injustice reigns in the House of Seti!  Pentaur is in 

prison, and yesterday evening they sat in judgment upon him.  My uncle was present, and would 

have pounced upon the poet, but Ameni took him under his protection.  What was finally decided, 

the pupils could not learn, but it must have been something bad, for the son of the Treasurer heard 

Ameni saying, after the sitting, to old Gagabu: 'Punishment he deserves, but I will not let him be 

overwhelmed;' and he can have meant no one but 


_
imagined, and he urged the friars, after such proofs of the disposition of the Indians to receive the 

faith, to send to persuade other religious to come and join them in the work of converting the 

willing people.  The Spaniard who held the encomienda of Chiapa was an astute person, in reality 

quite as vicious as any of the others but more adroit in concealing his evil doings; he found small 

difficulty in deceiving the simple friars and, by showing them hospitality and professing great 

respect for the New Laws, he succeeded in persuading them that he was their friend and 

protector.  The harmony of their relations could not however remain long undisturbed; from 

professing friendship he passed to more or less open acts of hostility, and from flattery he resorted 

to calumny.  An incident which occurred may serve admirably to illustrate the deceptions practised 

by the colonists on the ignorant Indians. One of the more intelligent of the natives came one day to 

the Dominicans and spoke as follows:  "Fathers, behold we are becoming bewildered.  Our master 

told us when you came, that he had written a letter to the Emperor _his brother_ [sic] asking that 

you be sent to say Mass for us and that it was by his order that you came to live amongst us. 

Since then, he tells us that you are poverty-stricken people, who come here to be supported by 

our labour, because you have not enough to eat in your own country.  He learn more; something 

frightful, I am afraid--several years of imprisonment is the least that will happen to him."  Bent-Anat 

had turned very pale.  "And whatever they do to him," she cried, "he will suffer for my sake! Oh, ye 

omnipotent Gods, help him--help me, be merciful to us both!"  She covered her face with her 

hands, and left the room.  Rameri asked Nefert:  What can have come to my sister? she seems 

quite strange to me; and you too are not the same as you used to be."  "We both have to find our 

way in new circumstances."  "What are they?"  "That I cannot explain to you!--but it appears to me 

that you soon may experience something of the same kind.  Rumeri, do not go again to the 

paraschites."    CHAPTER XXXII.  Early on the following clay the dwarf Nemu went past the 

restored hut of Uarda's father--in which he had formerly lived with his wife--with a man in a long 

coarse robe, the steward of some noble family.  They went towards old Hekt's cave-dwelling.  "I 

would beg thee to wait down here a moment, noble lord," said the dwarf, "while I announce thee to 

my mother."  "That sounds very grand," said the other.  "However, so be it.  But stay! The old 

woman is not to call me by my name or by my title.  She is to call me 'steward'--that no one may 

know.  But, indeed, no one would recognize me in this dress."  Nemu hastened to the cave, but 

before he reached his mother she called out: "Do not keep my 


_
us to give you the ground for your convent and to allow the church to be altered.  You, on the other 

hand, tell us we should not call him our master, for no man other than God whom you preach, is 

that; you tell us, also, that this man is a mortal like ourselves, subject to the Emperor, King of 

Castile, and that the Alcaldes at Ciudad Real may punish him.  He tells us that he is next to God 

and has no master in the world.  I don't understand you; you speak ill of our master; he speaks ill 

of you, and with all this we see you going about together good friends, neither of you daring to 

speak in the other's presence of what each tells us in the other's absence.  If you are honest, 

speak clearly, for we are in a cloud of smoke from your manner of proceeding." (58)      CHAPTER 

XVIII. - LAS CASAS REVISITS THE LAND OF WAR. AUDIENCIA OF THE CONFINES.  EVENTS 

AT CIUDAD REAL.  LAS CASAS RETURNS   Everywhere throughout the province of Chiapa, the 

heart of Las Casas was wrung by a repetition of the same tales of violence and rapacity; women 

stolen, property wrested from the defenceless Indians, and the people bought and sold like cattle, 

to be mercilessly overworked until more merciful death released them from bondage.  The Bishop 

was helpless, having no power or authority to enforce obedience either to the moral law he 

perpetually preached, or to the New Laws he everywhere expounded to the obdurate colonists. 

This condition of things, to which no end was apparent, determined him in June, 1545, to lay the 

matter before the Audiencia of the Confines and to demand that the provisions of the New Laws 

be enforced.  To reach the town of Gracias a Dios from Ciudad Real, whither he had returned, he 

took the road through Guatemala, yielding to the entreaties of his former companion Fray Pedro 

de Angulo, who desired him to see the admirable results achieved in the Tierra de Guerra.  Truly 

after such disappointments, sufferings, and persecutions, the Bishop deserved the consolation he 

derived from beholding the transformation of those formerly savage idolaters, into peaceful and 

civilised Christians, living in their towns in an orderly fashion far beyond what his highest hopes 

had allowed him to believe possible.  The caciques of the different towns vied with one another in 

celebrating his arrival, and Las Casas spoke to them all in their own language and delivered to 

them the cedulas he had obtained for them from the Emperor in Barcelona on May 1, 1543, in 

which their exemption from every kind of servitude was promised in perpetuity.  The journey from 

Tululatzan to Gracias a Dios was both a difficult and a perilous one, especially at that season 

when the rains had swollen the rivers and destroyed the mountain roads.  It is significant that 

throughout the life of Las Casas in America, he is never once mentioned as being ill or obliged on 

account of any infirmity to defer or alter his plans.  His constitution was evidently one of steel.  In 

spite of his seventy-one years, he reached his destination in due time, where he met the bishops 

of Guatemala and Nicaragua, the latter of whom was about to be consecrated.  The Bishop-elect 

of Nicaragua was Fray Antonio de Valdivieso, also a Dominican, who fully shared the opinions and 

Nemu laid his finger to his lips.  "You are to call him steward," said he.  "Good," muttered the old 

woman.  "The ostrich puts his head under his feathers when he does not want to be seen."  "Was 

the young prince long with Uarda yesterday?"  "No, you fool," laughed the witch, "the children play 

together.  Rameri is a kid without horns, but who fancies he knows where they ought to grow. 

Pentaur is a more dangerous rival with the red-headed girl.  Make haste, now; these stewards 

must not be kept waiting!"  The old woman gave the dwarf a push, and he hurried back to Ani, 

while she carried the child, tied to his board, into the cave, and threw the sack over him.  A few 

minutes later the Regent stood before her.  She bowed before him with a demeanor that was more 



like the singer Beki than the sorceress Hekt, and begged him to take the only seat she possessed. 

When, with a wave of his hand, he declined to sit down, she said:  "Yes--yes--be seated!  then 

thou wilt not be seen from the valley, but be screened by the rocks close by.  Why hast thou 

chosen this hour for thy visit?"  "Because the matter presses of which I wish to speak," answered 

Ani; "and in the evening I might easily be challenged by the watch.  My disguise is good.  Under 

this robe I wear my usual dress.  From this I shall go to the tomb of my father, where I shall take 

off this coarse thing, and these other disfigurements, and shall wait for my chariot, which is already 

ordered.  I shall tell people I had made a vow to visit the grave humbly, and on foot, which I have 

now fulfilled."  "Well planned," muttered the old woman.  Ani pointed to the dwarf, and said politely: 

"Your pupil."  Since her narrative the sorceress was no longer a mere witch in his eyes. The old 

woman understood this, and saluted him with a curtsey of such courtly formality, that a tame raven 

at her feet opened his black beak wide, and uttered a loud scream.  She threw a bit of cheese 

within the cave, and the bird hopped after it, flapping his clipped wings, and was silent.  "I have to 

speak to you about Pentaur," said Ani.  The old woman's eyes flashed, and she eagerly asked, 

"What of him?"  "I have reasons," answered the Regent, "for regarding him as dangerous to me. 

He stands in my way.  He has committed many crimes, even murder; but he is in favor at the 

House of Seti, and they would willingly let him go unpunished.  They have the right of sitting in 

judgment on each other, and I cannot interfere with their decisions; the day before yesterday they 

pronounced their sentence.  They would send him to the quarries of Chennu.       [Chennu is now 

Gebel Silsileh; the quarries there are of enormous      extent, and almost all the sandstone used 

for building the temples      of Upper Egypt was brought from thence.  The Nile is narrower there 

than above, and large stela, were erected there by Rameses II.  his      successor Mernephtah, on 

which were inscribed beautiful hymns to the      Nile, and lists of the sacrifices to be offered at the 

Nile-      festivals.  These inscriptions can be restored by comparison, and my      friend Stern and I 

had the satisfaction of doing this on the spot      (Zeitschrift fur Agyptishe Sprache, 1873, p.  129.)] 

"All my objections were 


_
of Las Casas.  All three of these prelates had grievances and petitions for redress of abuses and 

for the stricter administration of the laws in favour of the Indians, to lay before the Audiencia. 

Since that particular tribunal had been created for the purpose of executing these laws and was 

composed of men whom Las Casas had either chosen himself or recommended, the bishops were 

justified in anticipating a favourable hearing and a speedy adjustment of their complaints.  They 

obtained neither however, and especially towards Las Casas was the opposition of the auditors 

directed. When he first entered the council room, some of them cried: "Out with that lunatic!" and 

on another occasion, when Las Casas declined to withdraw, the President, Maldonado (well 

named indeed!), ordered him to be ejected by force.  Again, when the Bishop, with great 

solemnity, demanded that the Audiencia should correct the abuses complained of and should 

relieve the Indians from unlawful oppression, Maldonado answered: "You are a cheat, a bad man, 

a bad bishop, a shameful fellow, and you deserve to be punished."(59)  Such language in open 

council, addressed by the presiding officer to a bishop, sounds incredible, and considering the 

great influence of religion on all Spaniards of that time, it is not wonderful that after such insolence, 

this petty official was regarded by the entire community as excommunicated; a half-hearted 

apology, ungraciously made, sufficed however to avoid an open scandal.  Las Casas had already 

assured his friars in Ciudad Real that he neither felt insults nor feared threats, so the vulgar abuse 

of Maldonado did not touch him; he drew up and presented a wordy memorial to the Audiencia, 

divided into seven articles. The first article affirmed that the Bishop was hindered in the exercise of 

his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, by the opposition of the officers of justice.  The second asks for the 

aid of the secular arm to punish those guilty of disobedience and sacrilege.  The third asks that the 

Indians may be relieved from tyrannous oppression, particularly from the excessive taxes and 

forced labour exacted from them. The fourth article solicits the transfer of all causes affecting the 

Indians from the civil to the ecclesiastical courts.  The fifth begs the Audiencia to forbid all wars, 

conquests, invasions of territory, and the establishment of Spanish haciendas in Yucatan.  The 

sixth article petitions orders for the good treatment of the few Indians still held by the Crown in 

Yucatan, and the seventh asks that the officials of the Audiencia transfer to the Crown, all Indians 

and all villages affected by the royal ordinances already published.  The answer of the Audiencia 

was brief and amounted to a denial of the Bishop's allegations. (60) Foreseeing, doubtless, the 

rupture which must inevitably follow the presentation of his Anienophis, and wait there for me--I 

wish to speak to your mother alone."  Nemu bowed, and then went down the slope, disappointed, 

it is true, but sure of learning later what the two had discussed together.  When the little man had 

disappeared, Ani asked:  "Have you still a heart true to the old royal house, to which your parents 

were so faithfully attached?"  The old woman nodded.  "Then you will not refuse your help towards 

its restoration.  You understand how necessary the priesthood is to me, and I have sworn not to 

make any attempt on Pentaur's life; but, I repeat it, he stands in my way.  I have my spies in the 

House of Seti, and I know through them what the sending of the poet to Chennu really means.  For 

a time they will let him hew sandstone, and that will only improve his health, for he is as sturdy as 

a tree.  In Chennu, as you know, besides the quarries there is the great college of priests, which is 

in close alliance with the temple of Seti.  When the flood begins to rise, and they hold the great 

Nile- festival in Chennu, the priests there have the right of taking three of the criminals who are 

working in the quarries into their house as servants.  Naturally they will, next year, choose 



Pentaur, set him at liberty--and I shall be laughed at."  "Well considered!"  said aid Hekt.  "I have 

taken counsel with myself, with Katuti, and even with Nemu," continued Ani, "but all that they have 

suggested, though certainly practicable, was unadvisable, and at any rate must have led to 

conjectures which I must now avoid.  What is your opinion?"  "Assa's race must be exterminated!" 

muttered the old woman hoarsely.  She gazed at the ground, reflecting.  "Let the boat be scuttled," 

she said at last, "and sink with the chained prisoners before it reaches Chennu."  "No-no; I thought 

of that myself, and Nemu too advised it," cried Ani. "That has been done a hundred times, and 

Ameni will regard me as a perjurer, for I have sworn not to attempt Pentaur's life."  "To be sure, 

thou hast sworn that, and men keep their word--to each other.  Wait a moment, how would this 

do?  Let the ship reach Chennu with the prisoners, but, by a secret order to the captain, pass the 

quarries in the night, and hasten on as fast as possible as far as Ethiopia.  From Suan,--[The 

modem Assuan at the first cataract.]--the prisoners may be conducted through the desert to the 

gold workings.  Four weeks or even eight may pass before it is known here what has happened.  If 

Ameni attacks thee about it, thou wilt be very angry at this oversight, and canst swear by all the 

Gods of the heavens and of the abyss, that thou hast not attempted Pentaur's life.  More weeks 

will pass in enquiries. Meanwhile do thy best, and Paaker do his, and thou art king.  An oath is 

easily broken by a sceptre, and if thou wilt positively keep thy word leave Pentaur at the gold 

mines. 


_
Philip, regent during the Emperor's absence from Spain.  On the 25th of October, a letter signed 

by the Bishops of Chiapa and Nicaragua was despatched to Prince Philip complaining of the 

conduct of the Audiencia towards the churches, and declaring that since the New Laws were 

ignored and left in abeyance, the cruel treatment of the Indians had increased.  It was alleged that 

the President, Maldonado, and his associates possessed more than 60,000 Indians and that he 

encouraged his governors in every kind of tyranny and robbery of the natives for all of which the 

too compliant Audiencia neglected to provide any remedy.  The destitute and helpless condition of 

the bishops and clergy was set forth, and they were described as the only faithful subjects whom 

the sovereign had in those regions, for all the other royal officials were solely occupied with their 

own interests and in opposing the clergy in the discharge of their pastoral duties.  The two bishops 

urged upon the Prince to liberate all the Indians absolutely and immediately, as the only means to 

stop the growing evil.  The more to impress the Prince with the independent spirit of the colonial 

officials in ignoring royal orders and violating the express provisions of the New Laws, the bishops 

affirmed that most of them--with but few exceptions--were even inclined to independence and 

were secretly as much rebels as those in Peru.  An increase in My father's and my brother's bones 

have bleached there."  "But Ameni will never believe in the mistake," cried Ani, anxiously 

interrupting the witch.  "Then admit that thou gavest the order," exclaimed Hekt.  "Explain that thou 

hadst learned what they proposed doing with Pentaur at Chennu, and that thy word indeed was 

kept, but that a criminal could not be left unpunished.  They will make further enquiries, and if 

Assa's grandson is found still living thou wilt be justified.  Follow my advice, if thou wilt prove 

thyself a good steward of thy house, and master of its inheritance."  "It will not do," said  the 

Regent.  "I need Ameni's support--not for to-day and to-morrow only.  I will not become his blind 

tool; but he must believe that I am."  The old woman shrugged her shoulders, rose, went into her 

cave, and brought out a phial.  "Take this," she said.  "Four drops of it in his wine infallibly destroys 

the drinker's senses;  try the drink on a slave, and thou wilt see how effectual it is."  "What shall I 

do with it?"  asked Ani.  "Justify thyself to Ameni," said the witch laughing.  "Order the ship's 

captain to come to thee as soon as he returns; entertain him with wine-- and when Ameni sees the 

distracted wretch, why should he not believe that in a fit of craziness he sailed past Chennu?" 

"That is clever! that is splendid!"  exclaimed Ani.  "What is once remarkable never becomes 

common.  You

dioceses in Yucatan and Chiapa, which were too extensive for one bishop to govern.  It plainly 

appears in this letter that the writers were aware that the Audiencia had written, asking that a 

metropolitan judge should be sent out with superior powers of jurisdiction to hold them in check, 

but far from opposing this project, they agreed to it, suggesting, however, that he should be a 

papal legate and that meanwhile, until such a one could arrive, some one of the bishops should be 

deputed to hear appeals and decide cases with arch-episcopal powers.  The scandalous affair of 

the Dean in Ciudad Real was also recounted to the Prince and some displeasure expressed that 

the Bishop of Guatemala, Marroquin, should have seen fit to receive this rebellious priest in his 

diocese.  Priests, are now the wisest of women--my lady Beki."  "I am no longer Beki, I am Hekt," 

said the old woman shortly.  "As you will!  In truth, if I had ever heard Beki's singing, I should be 

bound to still greater gratitude to her than I now am to Hekt," said Ani smiling.  "Still, I cannot quit 

the wisest woman in Thebes without asking her one serious question.  Is it given to you to read the 

future?  Have you means at your command whereby you can see whether the great stake-- you 

know which I mean--shall be won or lost?"  Hekt looked at the ground, and said after reflecting a 

short time:  "I cannot decide with certainty, but thy affair stands well.  Look at these two hawks 

with the chain on their feet.  They take their food from no one but me.  The one that is moulting,

mass and baptise a pagan, no matter what his defects of character or conduct might be, was apt 

to be welcomed.  On the 15th of November, Las Casas addressed a letter to the India Council 

repeating his grave charges against Maldonado and explaining the reasons why he connived at 

resistance to the New Laws.  Simultaneously the Audiencia likewise wrote to the Council giving 

their version of the situation. This letter was not signed by the licentiate Herrera, one of the 

Rameses; the smart, smooth one, with shining eyes, is thyself.  It comes to this--which of you lives 

the longest.  So far, thou hast the advantage."  Ani cast an evil glance at the king's sick hawk; but 

Hekt said: "Both must be treated exactly alike.  Fate will not be done violence to."  "Feed them 

well," exclaimed the Regent; he threw a purse into Hekt's lap, and added, as he prepared to leave 

her: "If anything happens to either of the birds let me know at once by Nemu."
