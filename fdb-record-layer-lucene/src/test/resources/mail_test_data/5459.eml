was soon gratified, and the young courtier's interest in all that concerned=
 the Indians and the=20

proposed measures for the reform of the colonies was quickly satisfied by L=
as Casas, who=20

furnished him with a full history of the business he had in hand. The least=
 impressionable of men=20

could not listen to such an advocate unmoved, and M. de la Mure, profoundly=
 affected by what he=20

heard, offered to help his new friend by every means he could command. He w=
as an ally worth=20

having, for, being a nephew of Monsieur de Laxao, sommeiller du corps to th=
e King, he was able=20

to introduce Las Casas to his powerful uncle, who stood in closer relation =
to the monarch than any=20

other officer of the court, for he slept in the royal bedchamber.  Monsieur=
 de Laxao was as quickly=20

won over to the good cause as his nephew had been, so Las Casas, finding hi=
mself once more=20

with powerful supporters, renewed his efforts to press his business to a co=
nclusion. Some=20

wholesome activity was displayed in dispatching various officials to take t=
he residencia, of the=20

several governors of the islands, Rodrigo de Figueroa being sent to Hispani=
ola, Doctor de la=20

Gama to Puerto Rico and Cuba, and Lope de Sosa to Darien, where he was also=
 to succeed the=20

actual Governor, Pedro Arias de Avila. The Council, acting upon reports whi=
ch described the=20

natives of Trinidad as cannibals, ordered that war should be made upon them=
, but Las Casas=20

denied this charge, and contrived that Figueroa should be authorised to fir=
st investigate and report=20

on this matter before hostilities began; Figueroa's report was entirely fav=
ourable to the natives,=20

amongst whom he found no cannibalism.  As the Dominicans in Hispaniola were=
 ignorant of the=20

progress of events at court and the loss sustained by Las Casas through the=
 death of the=20

Chancellor, they still conceived him to enjoy great influence.   The Prior,=

_
grant for the Franciscan and Dominican monks of one hundred leagues of coas=
t on the mainland=20

about Cumana, from which laymen should be excluded; should one hundred leag=
ues be thought=20

excessive, then he begged for ten, and failing this he would accept the sma=
ll islands known as the=20

Alonso group, which lay some fifteen leagues from the coast.  His intention=
 was to establish a=20

place of refuge, or sanctuary, to which the persecuted Indians might repair=
, sure of finding kind=20

treatment, and, through instruction, be converted to Christianity.  The Pri=
or declared that unless=20

some one of these concessions was made, he would have to recall all the mon=
ks of his Order from=20

those countries, where it was idle for them to attempt to teach Christian d=
octrines, as long as the=20

Indians saw those who called themselves Christians acting in open violation=
 of them.  The=20

contents of this letter vexed and alarmed Las Casas not a little, for he fe=
ared that if the Prior were=20

driven to make good his threat of recalling his monks, the Indians would be=
 abandoned, without=20

defence, to the cruelties of the Spaniards and would soon be exterminated. =
His one hope of=20

support in his own plans lay in the Dominicans, without whose aid his effor=
ts were foredoomed to=20

failure. He spoke to the Bishop and the members of the Council, reading the=
m the letter and=20

addressing earnest appeals to them to stop the iniquities which were devast=
ating the entire coast.=20

He urged, with all the arguments of which he was master, that the one hundr=
ed leagues asked for=20

should be conceded.  The Bishop of Burgos was unmoved, both by the Prior's =
harrowing=20

description of the outrages committed on the Indians and by the appeal of L=
as Casas, and he=20

coolly answered that the King would be badly advised to grant a hundred lea=
gues of land to the=20

friars, without some return therefor; a reply which Las Casas observes was =
unworthy of a=20

successor of the Apostles.  Poor as the Bishop was in episcopal qualities, =
he was even less gifted=20

with those which make a good minister of colonial affairs, and the results =
of his thirty-five years of=20

control of Indian affairs were as unprofitable to the Spanish Crown as they=
 were disastrous to the=20

Indians.  Las Casas did not hesitate to express his opinion to the Bishop w=
ith his customary=20

uncompromising frankness, but with no result, save probably that of confirm=
ing his stubborn and=20

hostile attitude.  Perceiving that no argument which did not promise lucrat=
ive returns would avail to=20

secure a grant of territory, the clerigo evolved a plan that promised to se=
cure the ends for which he=20

and the Dominicans were striving and, at the same time, would assure a prof=
itable investment for=20

the Crown.  In spite of the Bishop's continued opposition, Las Casas pushed=
 forward his plan for=20

colonising, and though the Chancellor's death was a great loss to him, he n=
evertheless found in=20

Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht and other Flemings, every possible assistance. H=
e was named royal=20

chaplain in order to give him additional prestige before the public, and le=
tters were sent throughout=20

the kingdom to the principal civil and ecclesiastical authorities, ordering=
 some and inviting others=20

to aid him by every means in their power to collect the desired emigrants. =
The officials of India=20

House in Seville were instructed to receive and attend to those intending t=
o emigrate under Las=20

Casas, when they arrived in Seville; they were likewise directed to prepare=
 the necessary ships to=20

transport them to America.  It was necessary that Las Casas should be accom=
panied on his=20

recruiting tour through the country by some trustworthy man to help him in =
enrolling his emigrants,=20

and, as fate would have it, his choice fell most unfortunately upon one Ber=
rio, an Italian, a=20

circumstance which Las Casas afterwards observed was, in itself, sufficient=
 to explain his=20

treachery. Berrio was to act as herald, publishing in the different cities,=
 with sound of trumpet, the=20

object of Las Casas's visit, the high powers he held from the King, and the=
 favourable conditions=20



he offered. To give his assistant more dignity in the eyes of the people La=
s Casas procured for him=20

the designation of Captain in the royal service, with a salary of four hund=
red and five maravedis=20

per day.  Berrio sold himself to the Bishop of Burgos before the recruiting=
 expedition even began,=20

and his signed instructions, which he had engaged to obey, were fraudulentl=
y altered by the latter=20

so as to free him from all control. Thus provided, he soon detached himself=
 from his rightful=20

superior and went to Andalusia, where he assembled on his own account two h=
undred men,=20

vagabonds, loafers, and tapsters, of whom few were labourers and none fit f=
or colonists. These=20

unpromising recruits were gathered in Seville, where the officials of India=
 House were at a loss to=20

know what to do with them; they finally sailed, but, as the colonial author=
ities had received no=20

notice concerning them, they landed, destitute and worthless, in Hispaniola=
, where their arrival=20

was unwelcome. Many of them died and the others scattered in various parts.=
  It fell to Las Casas=20

to interest himself in their behalf and to relieve their miseries, but the =
meal and wine he obtained=20

for them arrived in Hispaniola too late, as the intended beneficiaries were=
 either dead or widely=20

dispersed.  It appears, according to Las Casas's own account, that emigrant=
s were attracted to his=20

scheme, not so much by the liberal conditions, or because their circumstanc=
es were not=20

prosperous, but by their desire to escape onerous feudal conditions still p=
revailing in Spain. It was=20

chiefly, therefore, from amongst the dwellers on great estates that his emi=
grants were recruited,=20

for many such said they desired to leave their children free in a free coun=
try under the King's=20

protection. The great nobles were ill-pleased at this desertion of their fe=
udatories, and Las Casas=20

soon found himself at loggerheads with the Constable of Castile, whose vill=
agers at Berlanga were=20

inscribing themselves in great numbers; the Constable ordered him to quit h=
is estates. On an=20

estate called Rello, belonging to the Count of Coruna, out of thirty househ=
olders twenty-nine put=20

down their names as emigrants. As may be supposed the number of the clerigo=
's enemies in high=20

quarters was increased by this state of things, though his success in recru=
iting emigrants enabled=20

him to triumph over the Bishop, who had foretold that he would never get to=
gether the necessary=20

people.  He was able to say on his return to Zaragoza that not only three t=
housand but ten=20

thousand people would willingly go if the Bishop would provide the means.  =
Cardinal Adrian=20

listened sympathetically to the report of what had been done and addressed =
to Las Casas the=20

observation in Latin,  Vere vos tribuitis aliud regnum regi.  The King and =
his Court left the kingdom=20

of Aragon at this time to visit the principality of Cataluna, making his fo=
rmal entry into Barcelona on=20

the fifteenth of February, 1519. The Jeronymite fathers had arranged for th=
e sale of the royal=20

haciendas in Hispaniola, and Las Casas, ever on the alert to secure advanta=
ges for his colonists,=20

presented a petition asking that they should be maintained for one year at =
the royal expense. The=20

vexation of the Bishop of Burgos augmented visibly at this fresh claim for =
assistance, and he=20

roundly declared such a concession would cost the Crown more than an armada=
 of twenty=20

thousand men, which provoked the pertinent retort from Las Casas: "Does it =
appear to your=20

lordship that after you have killed off the Indians, I should now lead Chri=
stians to death? Well, I=20

shall not." As the Bishop, according to Las Casas, was no fool, he hoped th=
at he understood this=20

plain answer.  Without the assistance which he was convinced was indispensa=
ble to the success=20

of his undertaking, Las Casas refused to move, though every effort was made=
 to start him off; an=20

attempt was even made to secure another leader for the undertaking, but the=
 news of this design=20

was not slow in reaching him, and he promptly published far and wide, in th=
e district where his=20



recruits were waiting his orders to start, that they should on no account a=
ccept the leadership of=20

another, who would only conduct them to failure and starvation in the colon=
ies.  Events of great=20

importance were occurring at this time which absorbed the attention of the =
King and his=20

counsellors to the exclusion of American affairs. By the death of his grand=
father, the Emperor=20

Maximilian, the succession was open, though both Francis I. of France and H=
enry VIII. of England=20

aspired to the imperial dignity. The royal interest therefore centred in Ge=
rmany and the coming=20

election, and Las Casas and his Indian schemes were put to one side.      C=
HAPTER IX. -=20

KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN SPUR. THE COURT PREACHERS. FURTHER CONTROVERSIES=20

As has been heretofore explained, Las Casas perceived that his efforts to o=
btain support for his=20

project would come to naught, unless it could be made plain to the Council =
that some material=20

benefit would accrue to the royal revenues; he therefore turned his attenti=
on to forming a plan=20

which should comprehend the conversion of the Indians by gentle and peacefu=
l means and=20

likewise yield a profit to the Crown. He conceived the idea of forming a sp=
ecies of order of=20

knighthood, whose members were to be known as Knights of the Golden Spur. T=
hey were to=20

number fifty selected men, each of whom should furnish two hundred ducats, =
which he deemed=20

would amount to a sufficient sum for the expenses of founding the colony. T=
he knights were to=20

wear a dress of white cloth, marked on the breast with a red cross, similar=
 to the cross of=20

Calatrava, but with some additional ornamentation. The purpose of this cost=
ume was to distinguish=20

them in the eyes of the Indians from all other Spaniards.  A grant of one t=
housand leagues of=20

coast, beginning one hundred leagues above Paria, and with no limits in the=
 hinterland, was asked=20

for the colony, in return for which concession a payment of fifteen thousan=
d ducats was promised=20

to the Crown during the first three years, which sum should afterwards beco=
me an annual income=20

until the seventh year; from the seventh to the tenth year, the income woul=
d be thirty thousand=20

ducats, and beginning with the eleventh year, it would reach the sum of six=
ty thousand. The=20

foundation of three fortified towns, with at least fifty Spaniards in each,=
 was promised within the=20

first five years. The religious propaganda was to be carried on by twelve F=
ranciscan and=20

Dominican friars, whom Las Casas was to be allowed to choose: for this purp=
ose the King was=20

asked to solicit the necessary faculties from the Holy See. Such, in brief,=
 was the plan which Las=20

Casas conceived for spreading civilisation on the American coast and winnin=
g the Indians to=20

Christianity. His own jurisdiction within the conceded territory was to be =
absolute, and all=20

Spaniards whatsoever were to be forbidden by royal command, and under pain =
of severe=20

penalties, to cross its borders. The only discoverable road to liberty lay =
through absolutism, under=20

a benevolent despot.  The most obvious flaw in this scheme was the difficul=
ty--amounting indeed=20

to impossibility--of finding the fifty knights. Las Casas, like many enthus=
iasts and reformers, failed=20

to reckon with the realities of human nature. His colony was to be a Utopia=
, peopled by lofty-

minded Spaniards, who were free from the prevalent thirst for gold, and onl=
y preoccupied in=20

cultivating sentiments of the purest altruism: mixed with them were to be g=
entle-mannered Indians,=20

in whom shone all the qualities of primitive man, unspoiled by contact with=
 the evils of civilisation,=20

and who were thirsting to know the truth and to embrace it. These idyllic b=
arbarians were to furnish=20

the human material on which the knights were to exercise their virtues and =
all were to be thus=20

united in bonds of loving fraternity and disinterested industry, under the =
benign government of a=20

dozen monks, who had long since renounced this world and who would give the=
ir exclusive=20



attention to leading their flock from a terrestrial into the celestial para=
dise. A Fra Angelico might=20

Las Casas kept his plan a profound secret until he had secured the approbat=
ion of the new=20

Chancellor, Gattinara, and that of several of the influential Flemings.  It=
 was then laid before the=20

India Council, where it was met with a storm of objection and ridicule. It =
was promptly shelved, and=20

not all the urging of Las Casas, the discontent of the Flemings, nor even t=
he efforts of the=20

Chancellor himself to induce the Bishop of Burgos to study the matter, suff=
iced to have it taken=20

into serious consideration. The different features, as they became known, p=
rovoked mirth, and=20

much fun was made of the white robes, red crosses, and golden spurs of the =
knights.  Baffled by=20

the inertia of the Council and the failure of his powerful friends to obtai=
n serious attention for his=20

project, Las Casas had recourse to other influences. The oppression of the =
Indians and the=20

violation of their rights as free men not only revolted the humanitarian in=
stincts of their Protector,=20

they offended justice and constituted a grave crime against morality, by wh=
ich the King was=20

inculpated and for which he would have to answer at the bar of divine justi=
ce. No utilitarian ends=20

could justify criminal means, and that Indian slavery was profitable to the=
 Crown was in no sense a=20

palliation of its essential wickedness.  The King's confessor, as keeper of=
 the royal conscience,=20

had already in Ferdinand's time been prevailed upon to explain to his Majes=
ty the grave=20

responsibility he incurred in tolerating a state of things so contrary to d=
ivine and natural laws.  Now=20

Las Casas, in his extremity, turned to the court preachers, who were eight =
in number, laying=20

before them the entire case as a problem in morals, upon which it was withi=
n their duty as the=20

spiritual instructors of the sovereign to pronounce. The part which these e=
cclesiastics took in the=20

matter was brief but not unimportant nor without results Two of them were s=
ecular priests, the=20

brothers Luis and Antonio Corodele, both religious and learned men, doctors=
 of the University of=20

Paris; another was Fray Miguel de Salamanca, also a doctor of Paris; there =
was Father Lafuente=20

of the University of Alcala, a Franciscan, Fray Alonso de Leon, an Augustin=
ian, Fray Dionisio, and=20

two others whose names Las Casas was not able to recall when writing his hi=
story some forty=20

years after these events occurred. This body of learned men represented eve=
rything that was=20

most authoritative in theological and canonical opinion of the times and co=
nstituted a most=20

formidable ally against the Bishop and Council. Meetings of the eight preac=
hers and Las Casas=20

were held in the convent of Santa Catalina, at which several other men of i=
mportance assisted,=20

one of whom was Fray Alonso de Medina, of the Dominicans; while another, a =
Franciscan friar=20

who had spent much time in the Indies, is described as a brother of the Que=
en of Scotland. These=20

meetings, which were secret, were held at the same hour of the day as the s=
ittings of the India=20

Council.  Religious dogma was held in that age to be axiomatic and incontro=
vertible; all science=20

was interpreted through the medium of the one universal science of theology=
, and the civil law of=20

the times drew its sanction from the principles of canon law, from which in=
deed it was scarcely=20

separable. Just as it was sought to sustain Galileo's proposition concernin=
g the revolution of the=20

earth by an appeal to theology, and just as theologians were considered com=
petent to pronounce=20

on the soundness of the theories of Columbus, so was it admitted, with far =
greater reason, to be=20

within their competence to pronounce upon the question of the    =3DTwo and=

CARO AND TROLLEY   At the entrance to the driveway leading to the residence=
 occupied by the=20

President of the Theological Seminary were two flat-topped stone pillars, a=
nd upon one of these=20

on a certain bright September day, Trolley sat sunning himself.  His handso=
me coat, shading from=20

a delicate fawn color to darkest brown, glistened like satin; his paws were=
 tucked comfortably=20

away beneath him, his long tail hung down behind, and his golden eyes were =
almost closed; only=20

the occasional movement of his small aristocratic ears showed him to be awa=
ke.  When Caro=20

came dancing down from the house he turned his head for a moment and watche=
d her sleepily till=20

she was safely on top of the other pillar, where she seated herself Turk-fa=
shion, her blue ruffles=20

spread out carefully, for Aunt Charlotte had cautioned her not to rumple th=
em. Caro had also been=20

told not to go out without her hat, so it dangled by its elastic from her a=
rm, while the sun shone=20

down without hindrance upon the fair little face with its smiling blue eyes=
, and its crown of short=20

brown curls.  =E2=80=9CTrolley,=E2=80=9D she announced presently, =E2=80=9C=
here comes the Professor of something that=20

begins with =E2=80=98Ex,=E2=80=99--I never can remember, it is such a funny=
 word. It sounds like the book in the=20

sor of New Testament=20

=E2=80=99s gateposts. =E2=80=9CWhy Miss=20

Trolley. He just jumps, but I have to climb. You see that ledge there?--and=
 this place--?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, my=20

dear, that will do. Aren=E2=80=99t you afraid you will fall?=E2=80=9D the p=
rofessor exclaimed uneasily, as Caro leaned=20

over to point out her way of ascent. =E2=80=9CI really think you had better=
 get down.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut it is very nice up=20

here; you can see so much,=E2=80=9D the little girl assured him serenely, a=
nd Dr. Wells went his way=20

wondering if he ought not to go up to the house and tell someone of her dan=
gerous position.  =E2=80=9CI am=20

not a bit afraid I=E2=80=99ll fall. There=E2=80=99s not the least danger; i=

the Indies, although that matter was treated as one of secular policy, belo=
nging to the India=20

Council.  Kings and governments contended, when they could, for the exercis=
e of their royal=20

powers in temporal matters, independently of the spiritual control, but the=
 line of distinction was a=20

fine one, not easily drawn, and the basis of Spain's claim to the Indies an=
d to the exercise of=20

jurisdiction in America was the Bull of Alexander VI. issued in May, 1493. =
The express condition=20

on which the Pope granted the Bull was, that the conversion of the Indians =
should be the primary=20

care of the Spanish government, and this condition was so clear and binding=
 that it amounted to a=20

reservation to the Pope of an oversight of the means to be adopted for that=
 end. As it was within=20

the recognised power of the Pope to grant such rights and jurisdiction, and=
 to attach conditions=20

thereto, it was equally within his power to annul or withdraw them if the S=
panish sovereigns failed=20

to fulfil those conditions. Hence the government of the Indies, in all that=
 pertained to the moral=20

well-being and religious instruction of the natives, was, beyond question, =
within the legitimate=20

exercise of ecclesiastical control. The exposition of the case by Las Casas=
, supported by the mass=20

of evidence he was able to furnish and the testimony of the Scotch Francisc=
an and others,=20

convinced the theologians that their duty, both to religion and to the King=
 bound them to intervene=20

and to correct abuses in open violation of the declared intentions of the s=
overeigns from the time=20

of Isabella that the Indians should be free men, whose conversion to Christ=
ianity was their first=20

duty. The theologians bound themselves by a common oath, that no opposition=
 should discourage=20

them, and that each and all of them would not desist from their single and =
united efforts, until=20

success had crowned them.  It was decided that the first step should be to =
exhort the members of=20

the Council: this failing of result, they would address their remonstrances=
 to the Chancellor, after=20

him to M. de Chievres, who was nearest the person of the King, and in the l=
ast resort the monarch=20

himself should be made to understand his responsibility.  Should nothing co=
me of their=20

exhortations, they bound themselves to preach openly against the government=
, instructing the=20

public conscience on the subject and assigning to the King his just share o=
f the wrong-doing.=20

Action followed swiftly upon the adoption of this resolution, and the India=
 Council, under the=20

presidency of the redoubtable Bishop of Burgos, was stupefied by the appari=
tion of the theologians=20

at one of its sittings. Fray Miguel de Salamanca, after asking for permissi=
on of the President,=20

made the following brief but energetic discourse: "Most illustrious gentlem=
en and most reverend=20

sir: It has been certified to us, the preachers of the King our lord, by pe=
rsons whom we are forced=20

to believe, and it also appears to be notorious, that men of our Spanish na=
tion in the Indies commit=20

great and unheard-of evils against the natives of those parts; such as robb=
eries and murders,=20

thereby giving the greatest offence to God and bringing infamy on our holy =
faith, and by which=20

such an infinite number of people have perished that large islands and a gr=
eat part of the mainland=20

are now depopulated, to the great ignominy even of the Royal Crown of Spain=
; for the Holy=20

Scripture testifies that in the multitude of the people consists the dignit=
y and honour of the King,=20

and in their diminution is his ignominy and dishonour.  We have marvelled a=
t this, knowing the=20

prudence and merits of the illustrious  =E2=80=9CThere is one thing I am af=
raid of--at least I don=E2=80=99t like it, and=20

that is the _dark_. I s=E2=80=99pose you don=E2=80=99t mind it =E2=80=99cau=
se you can see--I shouldn=E2=80=99t either if I could see in=20

the dark. Aunt Charlotte says I mustn=E2=80=99t have a light to go to sleep=
 by, and I love a light,--I just=20

_love_ it!=E2=80=9D Caro=E2=80=99s eyes had grown sorrowful and her voice h=
ad in it the sound of tears.  On the=20

porch of the house back among the trees Aunt Charlotte had waylaid the pres=
ident. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know=20



what to do with Caro, Charles. She isn=E2=80=99t exactly naughty,--and yet =
you couldn=E2=80=99t say she was good=20

either--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou surprise me,=E2=80=9D he replied, as his si=
ster hesitated. =E2=80=9CShe impresses me as a decided=20

character for one so young.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDecided! I should say so! Yo=
u know--=E2=80=9D Aunt Charlotte continued,=20

=E2=80=9CElinor put her in my charge to be dealt with as seemed to me best,=
 and I did think after bringing=20

up your five that I knew something about it, but my hand has lost its cunni=
ng. You know I have=20

never allowed a child a light to go to sleep by, but Caro insists upon havi=
ng one, and lies awake=20

and cries without it. What am I to do? Let her cry?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh n=
o, I shouldn=E2=80=99t do that!=E2=80=9D answered her=20

brother hastily, gazing into his hat as if he hoped to find there some solu=
tion of the problem.=20

=E2=80=9CSuppose you let me consider the matter,=E2=80=9D he added, as the =
striking of the hall clock reminded him=20

of his engagement; =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll talk to her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMu=
ch good it will do,=E2=80=9D said Aunt Charlotte.  With a book under=20

his arm Dr. Barrows started out, so absorbed in thought of his small grandd=
aughter that he passed=20

through the gate without seeing her till she called, =E2=80=9CGoodby grandp=
a!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy Caro! Aren=E2=80=99t you=20

afraid you will fall?=E2=80=9D  Caro shook her curls vigorously, and then l=
eaning forward she said plaintively,=20

=E2=80=9CGrandpa--please don=E2=80=99t let Aunt Charlotte make me sleep in =
the dark.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI fear you are a foolish=20

little girl,=E2=80=9D replied the president meaning to look stern, but succ=
eeding only in smiling fondly at the=20

witch on the pillar, who appropriated the smile and ignored the words.  =E2=
=80=9CYou know God made the=20

darkness, Caro,=E2=80=9D he continued, conscious that the remark was not qu=
ite original.  =E2=80=9CYes--=E2=80=9D=20

unwillingly--then =E2=80=9Cbut grandpa, He put stars in _His_ dark!=E2=80=
=9D  As Dr. Barrows walked down the street=20

he reflected that he should have but a divided mind to give to seminary mat=
ters, if the present=20

state of affairs continued, and the seminary needed his close attention jus=
t now.  It was two weeks=20

since his granddaughter had arrived to spend several months in his home whi=
le her father and=20

mother were traveling. =E2=80=9CI am afraid we have spoiled her a little,=
=E2=80=9D his daughter Elinor wrote, =E2=80=9Cand=20

 by her. He had thought a child in the=20

house after so many years of quiet might be annoying, but on the contrary h=
e would have liked to=20

to the Divine Majesty and to souls and, to the extent of our powers, to exh=

mind of his own. For=20

will receive signal=20

torments, for you bear on=20

did not covet anything that was her neighbor=E2=80=99s, so again and again =
Trolley was sent back, all to no=20
