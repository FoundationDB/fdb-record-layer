legs by the repeated draughts of the fiery cordial, the effect of which onl=
y became apparent to the=20

on-lookers after the final bet had been made and the game had recommenced. =
Who shall cast a=20

stone, then, at Haggard? He merely backed his luck, as the saying is. There=
 was nothing unfair=20

about the matter. But the nasty part of the whole thing was, that Haggard h=
ad won eleven=20

thousand pounds from a weak-headed boy. The society newspapers for the week=
 alluded to the=20

matter in veiled, but unmistakable terms. And when Haggard announced to his=
 friend Spunyarn his=20

intention of returning to America, to realize his property, on the terminat=
ion of his wedding tour, the=20

young lord acquiesced in that decision, casually remarking, "It would be as=
 well if you fought shy a=20

bit, you know, old man, for I am heartily sick of being bothered about the =
baccarat matter, and of=20

looking in the paper to see if that young prig Lamb has hung himself. Ta ta=

edge, on the side where the holes are: this part goes under the arm. Now ca=
st it off, leaving 32=20

stitches on the needle for the chest; knit these 32 for 22 rows, and then d=
ecrease (at the opposite=20

side to where you cast off) for 20 rows, thus making 10 decreasings; knit 3=
 plain rows and cast off.=20

Do another piece in the same way, and for the back cast on 22 and knit 5 pl=
ain rows: this part is=20

for the neck.  Sixth row=E2=80=94knit 4, increase; knit to within 4 of the =
end, and increase again; knit the=20

remaining 4.  Seventh row=E2=80=94plain knitting.  Do these alternately for=
 26 rows until you have 48=20

stitches; knit 16 rows; then knit 1, take 2 together, take 2 together, make=
 1; plain to within 5 of the=20

end where you make 1, take 2 together, 2 together again, knit the last. The=
 next row plain. Repeat=20

these two rows alternately 12 times, then do 24 plain rows and cast off.  F=
or the neck, pick up=20

about 40 stitches in scarlet and do 4 rows of ribbed knitting. Pick up=20


_
fore at your diggings to-morrow, in the regulation shiny boots." They parte=
d.  Next day Reginald=20

Haggard was to lead Georgina Warrender to the altar, and Spunyarn's allusio=
n to shiny boots=20

merely referred to the fact that he was to be his friend Haggard's best man=
.       CHAPTER VI.=20

GEORGIE'S WEDDING.   In newspaper descriptions of the last moments of celeb=
rated criminals,=20

we constantly read that "the unfortunate man did full justice to a with sca=
rlet, and 2 rows up the=20

front. Finish off with large buttons and elastic loops, and either knit 4 r=
ows (like the neck) round the=20

sleeves, or put long ones. For the latter cast on 40 stitches and knit 7 in=
ches. Rib 20 rows in=20

scarlet for the wrist.     _Child=E2=80=99s Gaiter, to cost 1s. 2d._   Thre=
e needles, No. 11 or 12, and 2 oz.=20

_
appetite for his breakfast; his own real breakfast is meant, and not the el=
aborate entertainment=20

which follows close upon the ceremony. Reginald Haggard and his friend, Lor=
d Spunyarn, were=20

the vicar's guests at King's Warren Parsonage, but in vain did Mrs. Dodd pr=
ess upon Haggard the=20

numerous dainties with which her hospitable board was provided. Haggard was=
 in a state of=20

suppressed excitement, and he couldn't eat a mouthful. They were a cheerful=
 enough party=20

though, and Lord Spunyarn made up for his friend's deficiencies, for the yo=
ung nobleman had an=20

almost Homeric appetite. Justice Haggard, Reginald's father, and Lord Hetto=
n, who had passed=20

the night at the "Dun Cow," were present, for the sporting nobleman was sup=
posed to represent=20

the head of the family, his father, Lord Pit Town; and though he looked upo=
n the whole matter as a=20

very great nuisance indeed, still it was a family function at which his pre=
sence was a matter of=20

course.  That breakfast at the Parsonage seemed interminable to Haggard, bu=
t even clerical=20

breakfasts must have an end, and at length Mrs. Dodd rose, to the general r=
elief of all present.=20

There were yet two mortal hours to get through, and the men of the party so=
ught the cool shades=20

of the vicarage garden.  "Pull yourself together, old man," said Spunyarn t=
o his friend, for Haggard=20

was looking pale and miserable; "you're as sulky as a bear with a sore head=
. It's quite=20

unnecessary to pose as a hero of romance. What's up with you, man; boots to=
o tight?"  "I'll be=20

hanged if I can tell you what's up," said his friend, "but this I know, I'm=
 confoundedly depressed."=20

"Perhaps it's your natural timidity," said the other.  "Don't chaff, Shirti=
ngs; you're a very good=20

fellow, you know, but I'm not in a laughing humour."  "Well, you needn't su=
lk all the same," said=20

Spunyarn; "take my advice and have a glass of brandy."  Justice Haggard loo=
ked far more like a=20

bridegroom than his son; the old gentleman, in his blue frock coat, his blu=
e bird's-eye neckerchief,=20

and with a flower in his button-hole, was the picture of health and happine=
ss; while his white hat,=20

which was cocked a little on one side, completed his festal appearance. He =
gave his son a hearty=20

smack on the back.  "When I married your mother, Reginald, my boy, I was as=
 jolly as a man could=20

be; why, there's nothing to be alarmed about, unless you've lost the ring, =
you know; and the ladies=20

wouldn't let you off with that excuse, for there's always the key of the ch=
urch door in case of an=20

emergency."  Haggard forced a smile.  "The ring's safe enough, father," he =
said.  "Don't worry him,=20

gentlemen," cried the vicar; "it's only natural. I've had a good deal of ex=
perience with bridegrooms;=20

believe me, it's the general symptom. I felt just the same when I was marri=
ed and end of the row.=20

Continue plain knitting, but you must decrease every five rows. When six de=
creasings are done go=20

on knitting until 78 rows are done.  Seventy-ninth row=E2=80=94knit 21 stit=
ches, take the next 18 for the=20

instep on a third pin and knit backwards and forwards, decreasing at the be=
ginning and end after=20

the first 2 rows. When 18 rows are done cast off.  Sew up the leg, and take=
 up the rest of the=20

stitches for the heel. Do 10 rows, decreasing at the beginning and end of e=
very row. Cast off.=20

_Round Sofa-cushion._   This can be worked in shades, or in any two colours=
 which contrast well.=20

Berlin and pins No. 14 may be used, casting on 54 stitches. This is rather =
a small size; to make it=20

larger use coarser wool, and pins to correspond.  First row=E2=80=94plain k=
nitting.  Second row=E2=80=94the rest=20

of the cushion is done in Brioche stitch; leave the last 3 stitches unknitt=
ed, turn and go on with the=20

Brioche stitch.  Fourth row=E2=80=94leave the last 6 unknitted and turn.  S=
ixth row=E2=80=94leave the last 9=20

unknitted, and so on, 3 more every time you get to the end of the row.  Whe=
n you have worked off=20

all the stitches, join the next shade and knit the whole row. The next row =
like the 2nd.  This makes=20

the knitting come into a gradual round. When large enough sew it up and do =
a second in the same=20



way. Make a round pillow lined with feathers, and put between the knitting,=
 which must be sewn=20

together like a silk pincushion. Draw in the centre, which may be finished =
off with an ornamental=20

button; the edges can be crocheted or left plain, as preferred.  These cush=
ions used to be very=20

fashionable at one time, although they are seldom seen now. However, fashio=
ns change so=20

quickly that they may, perhaps, be used again.     _Knee-cap._   These are =
very comfortable for=20

people who are at all rheumatic.  Cast on 29 stitches with Berlin wool, kni=
t 14, bring the wool=20

forward, knit the rest. Continue this until 28 rows are done. Then knit 32 =
rows without increasing.=20

Begin to decrease where you took the wool forward at the 14th stitch by kni=
tting 2 together. Do 28=20

rows to correspond with the other side; have 29 stitches on your pin, the s=
ame as you began with.=20

Cast off, and sew the ends together.  The size of knee-caps must be regulat=
ed by the pins, and=20

also by the number of stitches used. Many people consider them better when =
quite plain, without=20

either increasing or decreasing.     _Baby=E2=80=99s Hood._   Pins No. 9 an=
d Berlin, or any other soft wool.=20

Cast on 60, and do 1 plain row. Then do Hood pattern, page 50, for 5 rows; =
then 6 rows of plain=20

knitting. Do the rest in any fancy stitch. When the knitting is 4 inches de=
ep do 2 plain rows, 1=20

pearled, and cast off.  Cast on 22 stitches for the crown, do 1 plain row. =
 Second row=E2=80=94knit 1,=20

thread over, take 2 together. Repeat; 6 more=20


_
it's nothing to preaching one's first sermon. It's all very well for you to=
 talk, Haggard; but I'll be=20

bound we were both just as miserable as our young friend, though we've forg=
otten all about it now.=20

But here comes my wife with the sacrificial emblems."  There was no comprom=
ise about Mrs.=20

Dodd, as she advanced straight to the bridegroom and proceeded to firmly se=
cure a large white=20

favour to his breast. The rest of the party were soon similarly decorated. =
 "There's one comfort, we=20

haven't far to go," said Lord Hetton. "I feel we look rather like a row, de=
creasing at the beginning=20

and end of the row. Pearl the next, decreasing in the same way. Do 5 more r=
ows in this manner,=20

and cast off. Now sew the crown and head parts together, gathering the fuln=
ess at the top, and not=20

at the sides.  Take up 74 stitches for the curtain, or neck part, and do 3 =
rows of alternate knitting=20

and pearling; let the plain part come on the right side.  In the second row=
 increase after every 2=20

stitches, so as to have about 110 altogether. When you have done 3 rows do =
any open pattern for=20

2 inches, and cast off. Edge=20


_
"At all events, we haven't any time to lose," suggested the vicar, as he lo=
oked at his watch; "and,=20

unless we mean to keep the bride waiting, we had better be off."  The whole=
 party passed through=20

the little wicket, crossed the churchyard, which was thronged with the whol=
e population of King's=20

Warren in its Sunday best, and entered the church, and the bridegroom and h=
is friends at once=20

took their place at the altar rails.  If Georgie Warrender had acted with p=
roper decorum, she would=20

have wept upon her father's edging in pink wool, and then ribbon round the =
neck.  These hoods=20

are very useful in grey wool for poor people.          *       *       *   =
