Pedro.  But the words, that would have made the bear cringe and skulk a few=
 hours before, held=20

no terror for him.  He was master now, and this man who had clubbed and pro=
dded, sworn at, and=20

outraged him, was a pigmy in his arms.  His powerful jaw too was close to t=
he man's neck. One=20

crunch would make him lifeless.  Then Pedro, with more ferocity than judgme=
nt, began kicking,=20

hoping to frighten the bear, who had always skulked at his slightest word. =
 But the growl of rage=20

with which Black Bruin greeted this move fairly froze the blood in Pedro's =
veins, especially when=20

he felt the great brute half open his jaws as though to bite through his ne=
ck.  Then Pedro became=20

wise and sought by kind words to persuade the bear into releasing him.  "Gu=
de Freetzie, gude=20

beastie.  Don't, Freetzie, don't."  But those platitudes were received as u=
ncompromisingly by Black=20

Bruin as were the kicks.  He evidently would have no parleying of any sort.=
 The man had been=20

weighed in the balance and found entirely wanting.  There was still one ver=
y slight hope left,=20

however.  If Pedro could only reach his stiletto, even with his hands pinio=
ned to his sides, he might=20

be able to plunge it into the brute's side down low and inflict a wound tha=
t would cause the bear to=20

loose his hold for a second, when he might wrench himself free and deliver =
a second fatal thrust.=20

The stiletto was in a sheath and Pedro could just reach the point.  His onl=
y hope was to work it=20

loose, then with a quick motion jump it out, and catch it as it fell.  It w=
as a desperate chance, but=20

all that was left to him.  His slightest movement brought blood-curdling gr=
owls from Black Bruin,=20

who evidently did not intend to take any chances with him.  At the same ins=
tant that Pedro began=20

reaching for his stiletto, Black Bruin started marching him up the road int=
o the woods.  Where he=20

was taking him and what new horror awaited him the Italian could not imagin=
e.  Inch by inch he=20

carefully worked the stiletto higher and higher in the sheath.  Then with a=
 quick upward motion of=20

his hand, he jumped it clear of the leather and clutched for the handle as =
it fell.  But his fingers=20

barely glazed the steel, the weapon fell to the earth, and his last hope wa=
s gone.  About fifty feet=20

down the road, Black Bruin wheeled his captive sharply to the right and tak=
ing a few steps in that=20

direction, they stood upon the brink of the precipice, at the bottom of whi=
ch was the foaming,=20

dashing, turbulent stream.  As though to make the horror of the situation e=
ven more intense, the=20

moon which had been under a cloud, came out and shone peacefully into the y=
awning depths.  In=20

the silver moonlight the white foam on the water looked as soft as wool; bu=
t Pedro knew that=20

beneath the froth and foam were the jagged and hungry rocks that made it.  =
There they remained=20

for the space of ten seconds, the dark, cruel, sinister little man, held in=
 the inexorable grip of the=20

great shaggy beast.  Each second the crushing arms of the bear tightened an=
d the man's breath=20

came in gasps and sobs.  His tongue protruded from his mouth, and his eyes =
bulged out of their=20

sockets proportion, and there were ranged in it many Roman busts, and some =
ancient slabs and=20

altars of marble. These had been collected some century ago by the minister=
; but what=20

immediately struck the eye of Lothair were two statues by an American artis=
t, and both of fame,=20

the Sybil and the Cleopatra. He had heard of these, but had never seen them=
, and could not=20

refrain from lingering a moment to gaze upon their mystical and fascinating=
 beauty.  He proceeded=20

through two spacious and lofty chambers, of which it was evident the furnit=
ure was new. It was=20

luxurious and rich, and full of taste; but there was no attempt to recall t=
he past in the details; no=20

cabinets and clocks of French kings, or tables of French queens, no chairs =
of Venetian senators,=20

no candelabra, that had illumined Doges of Genoa, no ancient porcelain of r=
are schools, and ivory=20

carvings and choice enamels. The walls were hung with master-pieces of mode=
rn art, chiefly of=20



the French school, Ingres and Delaroche and Scheffer.  The last saloon led =
into a room of smaller=20

dimensions, opening on the garden, and which Lothair at first thought must =
be a fernery, it seemed=20

so full of choice and expanding specimens of that beautiful and multiform p=
lant; but, when his eye=20

had become a little accustomed to the scene and to the order of the groups,=
 he perceived they=20

were only the refreshing and profuse ornaments of a regularly furnished and=
 inhabited apartment.=20

In its centre was a table covered with writing-materials and books and some=
 music. There was a=20

chair before the table, so placed as if some one had only recently quitted =
it; a book was open, but=20

turned upon its face, with an ivory cutter by its side. It would seem that =
the dweller in the chamber=20

might not be far distant. The servant invited Lothair to be seated, and, sa=
ying that Mrs. Campian=20

must be in the garden, proceeded to inform his mistress of the arrival of a=
 guest.  The room=20

opened on a terrace adorned with statues and orange-trees, and descending g=
ently into a garden=20

in the Italian style, in the centre of which was a marble fountain of many =
figures. The grounds were=20

not extensive, but they were only separated from the royal park by a wire f=
ence, so that the scene=20

seemed alike rich and illimitable. On the boundary was a summer-house in th=
e shape of a classic=20

temple, one of those pavilions of pleasure which nobles loved to raise in t=
he last century.  As=20

Lothair beheld the scene with gratification, the servant reappeared on the =
step of the terrace and=20

invited him to descend. Guiding him through the garden, the servant retired=
 as Lothair recognized=20

Mrs. Campian approaching them.  She gave her hand to Lothair and welcomed h=
im cordially but=20

with serenity. They mutually exchanged hopes that their return to town had =
been agreeable.=20

Lothair could not refrain from expressing how pleased he was with Belmont. =
 =E2=80=9CI am glad you=20

approve of our hired home,=E2=80=9D said Theodora; =E2=80=9CI think we were=
 fortunate in finding one that suits our=20

tastes and habits. We love pictures and statues and trees and flowers, and =
yet we love our friends,=20

and our friends are people who live in=20


_
Blood dripped from his nose and his ribs creaked as the infuriated beast sl=
owly crushed him.=20

When the figure of his tormentor no longer struggled in his arms, Black Bru=
in opened his powerful=20

jaws and with a single bite crushed the vertebras of the neck.  Then, with =
a grunt of deep=20

satisfaction, he lifted the limp figure in his arms as high as he could, an=
d flung it into the yawning=20

chasm below.  He peered over the railing and saw it strike upon the rocks b=
eneath, hang for a=20

moment uncertain and disappear in the dark eddy.  Then he dropped on all fo=
urs and hurried back=20

to camp, where he demolished everything of Pedro's meagre outfit, not forge=
tting to tear his coat=20

to  =E2=80=9CI think I saw two statues to-day of which I have often heard,=
=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThe Sibyl and=20

Cleopatra! Yes Colonel Campian is rather proud of possessing them. He colle=
cts only modern art,=20

for which I believe there is a great future, though some of our friends thi=
nk it is yet in its cradle.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

am very sorry to say,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthat I know very litt=
le about art, or indeed any thing else, but I=20

admire what is beautiful. I know something about architecture, at least chu=
rch architecture.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell,=20

religion has produced some of our finest buildings,=E2=80=9D said Theodora;=
 =E2=80=9Cthere is no question of that;=20

and as long as they are adapted to what takes place in them they are=20
