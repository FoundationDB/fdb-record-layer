about it because of my loss. Well, I can see you're in a hurry to get started on those victuals, so I'll 

cut it short. Here's my donation."  He handed Dan a check. The boy read the figure $1,500.00 and 

whistled softly.  "Wow! This is more than generous, Mr. Merrimac! It's magnificent."  "Your 

contribution will put the Cubs over the top!" added Brad.  "That's all I have to say," Mr. Merrimac 

declared. "I have to get back home now."  "Stay for supper, Mr. Merrimac," Dan urged.  "No, I want 

to be home," the old man replied. "My nephew is there now, you know. Came this afternoon."  The 

information was new to the boys, but they tried not to show curiosity.  "Carl will stay with me for a 

while," Mr. Merrimac explained. "I was able to get him off on probation. If he leads a straight life, 

as I think he will, he'll be assured of a good home with me."  "Your heart's in the right spot, Mr. 

Merrimac," Dan declared warmly.  "Tut!" the old man chuckled, embarrassed by the praise. "Well, 

good-bye boys, or should I say, Sir Knights!"  A delightful social hour followed for the Cubs, their 

parents and friends. Among those present was Mrs. Jones, who seemed as proud of Jack as if he 

were her own son.  All too soon to please the Cubs, it was time for the meeting to break up. Brad 

began to put away the swords and other items used during the ceremony.  Coming upon the 

scrapbook which Dan had made, he fingered through it.  "You did a bang-up job recording the 

history of the Cubs," he praised. "But why all the live in, a new windmill,--bought on credit,--a 

chicken-house and poultry. Mrs. Shimerda had paid grandfather ten dollars for a milk cow, and 

was to give him fifteen more as soon as they harvested their first crop.  When I rode up to the 

Shimerdas' one bright windy afternoon in April, Yulka ran out to meet me. It was to her, now, that I 

gave reading lessons; Antonia was busy with other things. I tied my pony and went into the kitchen 

where Mrs. Shimerda was baking bread, chewing poppy seeds as she worked. By this time she 

could speak enough English to ask me a great many questions about what our men were doing in 

the fields. She seemed to think that my elders withheld helpful information, and that from me she 

might get valuable secrets. On this occasion she asked me very craftily when grandfather 

expected to begin planting corn. I told her, adding that he thought we should have a dry spring and 

that the corn would not be held back by too much rain, as it had been last year.  She gave me a 

shrewd glance. "He not Jesus," she blustered; "he not know about the wet and the dry."  I did not 

answer her; what was the use? As I sat waiting for the hour when Ambrosch and Antonia would 

return from the fields, I watched Mrs. Shimerda at her work. She took from the oven a coffee-cake 

which she wanted to keep warm for supper, and wrapped it in a quilt stuffed with feathers. I have 

seen her put even a roast goose in this quilt to keep it hot. When the neighbors were there building 

the new house they saw

"They represent the future," Dan laughed, stepping out of his armor. "And boy! Judging from the 

past, what a future we'll have. How about it, fellows?"  "We'll do our best to make 'er glow!" 

shouted Chips.  The other Cubs, gathering up their belongings, signified agreement, by giving a 

long and lusty wolf wail.  "A-h-h-kay Iaa!" they shouted. "W-e-e-l d-o-o-o-o our Best!"  On that 

note, the Cubs in a burst of enthusiasm, grabbed Dan and tossed him a little way into the air. 

Then, like a pack of healthy young wolves, they raced out of the meeting hall.

their food in their feather beds.  When the sun was dropping low, Antonia came up the big south 

draw with her team. How much older she had grown in eight months! She had come to us a child, 

and now she was a tall, strong young girl, although her fifteenth birthday had just slipped by. I ran 

out and met her as she brought her horses up to the windmill to water them. She wore the boots 

her father had so thoughtfully taken off before he shot himself, and his old fur cap. Her outgrown 

cotton dress switched about her calves, over the boot-tops. She kept her sleeves rolled up all day, 

and her arms and throat were burned as brown as a sailor's. Her neck came up strongly out of her 

shoulders, like the bole of a tree out of the turf. One sees that draft-horse neck among the peasant 

women in all old countries.  She greeted me gayly, and began at once to tell me how much 

ploughing she had done that day. Ambrosch, she said, was on the north quarter, breaking sod with 

the oxen.  "Jim, you ask Jake how much he ploughed to-day. I don't want that Jake get more done

again, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her hand. "You see the big 

prairie fire from your place last night? I hope your grandpa ain't lose no stacks?"  "No, we did n't. I 

came to ask you something, Tony. Grandmother wants to know if you can't go to the term of 

school that begins next week over at the sod schoolhouse. She says there's a good teacher, and 

you'd learn a lot."  Antonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were stiff. "I ain't 

got time to learn. I can work like mans now. My mother can't say no more how Ambrosch do all 

and nobody to help him. I can work as much as him. School is all right for little boys. I help make 

this land one good farm."  She clucked to her team and started for the barn. I walked beside her, 

feeling vexed. Was she going to grow up boastful like her mother, I wondered? Before we reached 

the stable, I felt something tense in her silence, and glancing up I saw that she was crying. She 

turned her face from me and looked off at the red streak of dying light, over the dark prairie.  I 

climbed up into the loft and threw down the hay for her, while she unharnessed her team. We 

walked slowly back toward the house. Ambrosch had come in from the north quarter, and was

"Sometime you will tell me all those nice things you learn at the school, won't you, Jimmy?" she 

asked with a sudden rush of feeling in her voice. "My father, he went much to school. He know a

read so many books that the priests in Bohemie come to talk to him. You won't forget my father,
