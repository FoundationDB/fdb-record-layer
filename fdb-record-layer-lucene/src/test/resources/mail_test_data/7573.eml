this sin is much stronger now than ever before in the world's history. We a=
re not in the habit of condemning it as a sin. In his epistle to the Thessa=
lonians Paul speaks of "the cloke of covetousness." Covetous men use it as =
a cloke, and call it prudence, and foresight. Who ever heard it confessed a=
s a sin? I have heard many confessions, in public and private, during the p=
ast forty philodendron monstera before we could get a shot."  "Well, you'd =

The object was flying=20

right across the valley.  Will, Sam and Nat rushed from the tent. They had =
heard Jack's cry.  "Do=20

you see it?" the watcher demanded. "Right up there!"  The fire blazed up mo=
re brightly, and in the=20

glare of it could be dimly seen something like a great bird.  "That's it!" =
cried Nat. "Gasolened=20

grasshoppers! but what is it?"  No one answered. The throbbing and whirring=
 grew fainter, and the=20

shape passed out of sight. From the tent could be heard the howling of Long=
 Gun, as he prayed in=20

his own tongue.  "Quit that!" yelled Bony from the canvas shelter. "Do you =
want to frighten us all to=20

death?"  Then Long Gun's cries were muffled, and it was evident that he had=
 hidden his head=20

under his blankets.  "This settles it!" declared Jack positively. "We'll ma=
ke another trip over the=20

mountain to-morrow and see if we can't solve this."  "That's what we will!"=
 added Nat. "First thing=20

you know we'll wake up some night and find ourselves gone."  They made prep=
arations to be=20

away all night if necessary, taking plenty of blankets and food. Budge and =
Long Gun decided to=20

remain in camp to look after things.  "S'posin'youdon'tcomeback?" asked Bud=
ge, all in one word.=20

"Oh, we'll come back," replied Jack confidently. "If we don't, you and Long=
 Gun will have to come=20

after us."  "Where'llyoube?"  "You'll have to hunt," was Jack's answer as h=
e flicked his horse with=20

the quirt.  They had decided to do some hunting as they proceeded, and were=
 on the lookout for=20

game. The weather continued fine, and the snow had disappeared, though they=
 might expect=20

heavy storms almost any day, Long Gun said.  They crossed the mountain ridg=
e, and started=20

down the other side, without having had a chance to shoot anything. They re=
ached the place=20

where they had seen the mysterious marks in the snow, and made a careful ex=
amination, but=20

could discover nothing new.  "Well, Jack, which way now?" asked Sam as they=
 stood looking=20

about them.  "Down the mountain," decided Jack. "I think we may get a shot =
at some deer, if we=20

don't find anything else in the valley. Long Gun said it was a good hunting=
 ground."  They rode on,=20

Jack and Nat in advance. Whether their horses were better than the steeds o=
f their cursing. My=20

brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send forth at th=
e same time sweet water=20

and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vin=
e figs? so can no fountain=20

both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledg=
e among you? let=20

him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But =
if ye have bitter=20

envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth=
."  Blighted hopes and=20

blasted reputations are witness to its awful power. In many cases the tongu=
e has murdered its=20

victims. Can we not all recall cases where men and women have died under th=
e wounds of=20

calumny and misrepresentation? History is full of such cases.  WORDS NEVER =
CALLED BACK.=20

The most dangerous thing about it is that a word once uttered can never be =
obliterated. Some one=20

has said that lying is a worse crime than counterfeiting. There is some hop=
e of following up bad=20

coins until they are all recovered; but an evil word can never be overtaken=
. The mind of the hearer=20

or reader has been poisoned, and human devices cannot reach in and cleanse =
it. Lies can never=20

be called back.  A woman who was well known as a scandal-monger, went and c=
onfessed to the=20

priest. He gave her a ripe thistle-top, and told her to go out and scatter =
the seeds one by one. She=20

wondered at the penance, but obeyed; then she came and told the priest. He =
next told her to go=20

and gather again the scattered seeds. Of course she saw that it was impossi=
ble. The priest used it=20

as an object-lesson to cure her of the sin of scandalous talk.  THE FATE OF=
 THE LIAR AND=20

SLANDERER.  These sins are devilish, and the Bible is severe in its denunci=
ations of them. It=20



contains many solemn warnings. "Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:=
 the Lord will abhor=20

the bloody and deceitful man. . . . The mouth of them that speak lies shall=
 be stopped. Whoso=20

privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off. . . . Lying lips are a=
n abomination to the Lord: but=20

they that deal truly are His delight. . . . By thy words thou shalt be just=
ified, and by thy words thou=20

shalt be condemned. . . . All liars shall have their part in the lake which=
 burneth with fire and=20

brimstone: which is the second death." Whoso loveth and maketh a lie=20


_
unconsciously urged them to greater speed, was not apparent, but the fact w=
as that in about an=20

hour the two found themselves alone, having distanced their companions.  "L=
et's wait for them,"=20

suggested Nat.  "No, let's keep on. It's a good trail, and they can't miss =
it. They'll catch up to us=20

soon. Maybe we can see something to shoot if we go on a little way, or mayb=
e----"  "Maybe we'll=20

see that mysterious bird," finished Nat. "I believe you'd rather find that =
than kill a big buck."  "Oh, I=20

don't know," replied Jack slowly. "I'd like to get a nice buck, but I'd als=
o like to solve that mystery."=20

"Speaking of bucks," whispered Nat quickly, "look there! Two of 'em!"  He p=
ointed to a little glade,=20

into which they were turning, and Jack saw two large mule deer feeding on t=
he grass.  "A buck=20

and a doe," he said as he raised his rifle. "I think we are close enough to=
 risk a shot. You take the=20

buck, Nat. You haven't had a good pair of horns yet, and that fellow has so=
me beauts. We'll both=20

fire together."  Nat nodded to show that he understood. The deer had not sc=
ented the young=20

hunters, but were still quietly feeding. Slowly Jack and Nat raised their r=
ifles, having dismounted=20

from their horses.  Just as they were about to pull the triggers a curious =
thing happened. The deer=20

suddenly raised their heads, and gazed at a spot to the left of them. Then =
they bounded away, so=20

swiftly that it was difficult for the eye to follow them.  "Well, did you s=
ee that?" asked Nat.=20

"Something scared them."  "Yes, and it wasn't us," said Jack. "We're out of=
 sight, and the wind's=20

blowing from them to us. I'm going to see what it was that sent them off." =
 He mounted his horse=20

again, an new Jerusalem.  HOW TO OVERCOME.  "But, Mr. Moody," you say, "how=
 can I check=20

myself? how can I overcome the habit of lying and gossip?" A lady once said=
 to me that she had=20

got so into the habit of exaggerating that her friends said they could neve=
r understand her.  The=20

cure is simple, but not very pleasant. Treat it as a sin, and confess it to=
 God and the man whom=20

you have wronged. As soon as you catch yourself lying, go straight to the p=
erson and confess you=20

have lied. Let your confession be as wide as your transgression. If you hav=
e slandered or lied=20

about any one in public, let your confession be public. Many a person says =
some mean, false thing=20

about another in the presence of others, and then tries to patch it up by g=
oing to that person alone.=20

That is not making restitution. I need not go to God with confession until =
I have made it right with=20

that person, if it is in my power to do so; He will not hear me.  Hannah Mo=
ore's method was a sure=20

cure for scandal. Whenever she was told anything derogatory of another, her=
 invariable reply was:=20

"Come, we will go and ask if it be true."  The effect was sometimes ludicro=
usly painful. The=20

talebearer was taken aback, stammered out a qualification, or begged that n=
o notice might be=20

taken of the statement. But the good lady was inexorable. Off she took the =
scandal-monger to the=20

scandalized to make inquiry and compare accounts.  It is not likely that an=
ybody ventured a=20

second time to repeat a gossipy story to Hannah Moore.  My friend, how is i=
t? If God should weigh=20

you against this commandment, would you be found wanting? "Thou shalt not b=
ear false witness."=20

Are you innocent or guilty?    Tenth Commandment  "Thou=20


_
down the glade to where the deer had been feeding.  "I wonder if it could h=
ave been a bear?"=20

asked Jack of his chum. "If it was----"  He did not get a chance to finish =
the sentence, for even as=20

he spoke the bushes just in front of the two lads were parted, and three me=
n stepped into view.=20

"What are you lads doing here?" asked one of the strangers sternly.  "We--w=
e were hunting,"=20

replied Jack. "We saw two neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid=
servant, nor his ox,=20

nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's."  In the twelfth chapter =
of Luke our Saviour lifted=20

two danger signals. "Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hyp=
ocrisy. . . . Take heed=20

and beware of covetousness."  The greatest dupe the devil has in the world =
is the hypocrite; but=20

the next greatest is the covetous man, "for=20
