best get her fixed up with a 'buddy' and close the meeting."  "But I _don't=
_ understand. What, for=20

goodness' sake, is a buddy, and why must I have one?" demanded Irene tragic=
ally.  "Sit down=20

there, child, and let Grannie talk to you," replied President Agnes. "If yo=
u haven't heard of a buddy=20

yet it's time you did. They're the latest out. They had them at all the cam=
ps last summer, in=20

England as well as in America. A buddy is a chum with whom you're pledged t=
o do everything, and=20

who's bound to support you. For instance, when the bathing season is on you=
 must never swim=20

unless your buddy is swimming with you; if you go on an excursion you stick=
 to each other tight as=20

glue, and if one of you is lost the other is held responsible. You're as in=
separable as a box and its=20

lid, or the two blades of a pair of scissors, or a bottle and its cork, or =
any other things you happen=20

to think of that ought to go together, and aren't any use apart."  "We only=
 realized buddies last=20

term," explained Peachy, "but the idea caught on no end. We all went simply=
 crazy over it. I don't=20

mind guessing that every girl in this school who's worth her salt has got h=
er buddy. She mayn't let=20

it be known outside her own sorority, but we aren't blind."  "Are there oth=
er sororities in the school=20

then besides the Camellia Buds?" asked Irene.  "Bless your innocence! I sho=
uld think there are.=20

There's a rival one in the Transition. I rather fancy they've snapped up Ma=
bel already. I gave=20

Winnie a hint she wasn't to tackle _you_, because you'd come to school with=
 an introduction to=20

_me_, so I ought to have first innings. The prefects have a sorority all to=
 themselves, and the=20

seniors have one, and as for the juniors, silly little things, they're as t=
ransparent as glass, with their=20

signaling and their grips and their cypher letters. Any one can see through=
 them with half an eye.=20

But we're wasting time. We've got to fix you up with a buddy, and we must b=
e quick before the bell=20

rings."  "May we choose?" asked Irene, and her eyes fell longingly on Peach=
y.  "No, we mayn't!"=20

said President Agnes firmly. "We have to take what the fates send us. It's =
Kismet. Every time we=20

elect a new member we draw lots again for buddies. It's a kind of general s=
huffle. If we're an=20

uneven number somebody of course has to be odd man out."  "I was the 'old m=
aid' last draw, and I=20

haven't had a buddy this term," remarked Sheila plaintively.  "Never mind, =
ducky! You're bound to=20

find a partner now," consoled Delia. "It might even be my little self, so l=
ive in hope."  "No such=20

luck," groaned Sheila. "I'll probably get Joan, and you know she always use=
s me as a door-mat."=20

Agnes meantime was writing ten names on ten separate pieces of paper and fo=
lding them in=20

identically the same fashion. Peachy offered the loan of a hat, and into th=
is treasury they were cast=20

and shuffled.  "The newest member draws," murmured Agnes, and the others pu=
shed Irene=20

forward. She chose two folds of paper at a venture, and twisted them togeth=
er, then performed the=20

like service for another pair, until all the ten were assorted. The thrill =
of the ceremony was when=20

Agnes opened the screws of paper and read out the names. Fate had mixed the=
 Camellia Buds=20

together thus:            Peachy Proctor--Sheila Yonge.           Jess Came=
ron--Delia Watts.=20

Joan Lucas--Esther Cartmel.           Agnes Dalton--Mary Fergusson.        =
   Lorna Carson--Irene=20

Beverley.  Whether the members of the secret sorority felt satisfied or oth=
erwise with the result of=20

the shuffle, etiquette forbade them to show anything but polite enthusiasm.=
 Each took her buddy=20

solemnly by the hand and vowed allegiance. Peachy then produced what she ca=
lled "the loving=20



cup," a three-handled vase of brown pottery brought by Jess from Edinburgh =
and with the motto=20

"Mak' yersel' at hame," on it in cream-colored letters. It was usually a re=
ceptacle for flowers, but it=20

had been hastily washed for the occasion and filled with lemonade, a rather=
 bitter brew concocted=20

by Peachy and Delia from a half-ripe lemon plucked in the garden and a few =
lumps of sugar saved=20

from tea. This was passed round, and the Camellia Buds gulped it heroically=
 as a pledge of=20

sisterhood.  "The password is _Thistle-down_," decreed Agnes, as the member=
s, trying not to pull=20

sour faces, consoled themselves with candy and broke up the meeting. "Any o=
ne who can think of=20

a stunt for next time please bring along propositions. We're always open to=
 new ideas and ready=20

for a startler."  As a direct result of her admission to this select sorori=
ty Irene found herself flung by=20

Fate into the arms of Lorna Carson. Had any individual choice been allowed =
she would have=20

selected Peachy, Jess, Delia, or even Sheila in preference, but the lot onc=
e cast she must abide=20

by it and be content. She had a very shrewd suspicion that when the buddies=
 got tired of each=20

other they elected a fresh member and so necessitated a general reshuffle o=
f partners, and that=20

her admission to the society had been welcomed as the pretext for such a ch=
ange. Here she was,=20

however, pledged to intimate friendship with Lorna, a girl who half fascina=
ted and half repelled her,=20

and who, though she might possibly turn out trumps in the future, was for t=
he present at least most=20

difficult to understand.     CHAPTER V  Fairy Godmothers, Limited  Irene Be=

of life, but ready to=20

 teasing if you carry on like=20

this. Can't you brace up and be sporty? Pretend you don't mind anything the=
y say and they'll soon=20

stop."  "But I _do_ mind!" sobbed the tragic little figure on the steps. "I=
 mind d-d-dreadfully! Why=20

are they all so horrid to me? People have always been so nice till I came h=
ere!"  "That's exactly=20

the reason," said Irene, grasping the situation and explaining it truthfull=
y. "You've been=20

accustomed to be petted by everybody, and after all why _should_ the other =
girls in your form pet=20

you? You don't pet _them_, do you?"  "N-n-o!"  Desiree's eyes were round wi=
th amazement.=20

"Well, can't you see school's a matter of give and take? If you do somethin=
g for the rest they'll=20

possibly like you, but they won't fall on your neck just out of sheer good =
nature. Why don't you=20

write home for a box of chocolates and offer them round your form?"  "I nev=
er thought of it. I had=20

some chocolates--but--I ate them!"  "There you are! You expected to get all=
 the attention and give=20

nothing. Sorry if I seem brutal, but it's the solid truth. You take my advi=
ce and cheer up instead of=20

continually sniveling. I've been at school myself since I was seven, and I =
know a thing or two. If a=20

girl's popular there's generally some reason behind it. Look here, I'll hel=
p you if I can. Those kids=20

over there are doing nothing. I'll get them to come and play rounders, choo=
se you for a partner,=20

and I'll back our side to win. Here's Peachy! Perhaps she'll join in too. I=
'll ask her."  Irene rapidly=20

explained her philanthropic intentions, and enlisted both Peachy and Delia =
in her team. The=20

juniors, amazed and flattered at an invitation from older girls, were ready=
 enough for a game. Irene=20

insisted upon the innovation of what she called "hunting in couples," that =
is to say, dividing the=20

company into partners who made the course hand in hand. She took good care =
to choose Desiree=20

for her "running-mate," and as they were both fleet of foot they scored con=
siderably. By the time=20

the bell rang they had beaten the records.  "Look here!" said Irene, addres=
sing the juniors before=20

they scooted away, "you kids are missing a chance. Why don't you make Desir=
ee train for the=20

sports? She can run like a hare! With the start she'd get as a junior she m=
ight win you a trophy.=20

Hadn't it ever entered your silly young noddles to see what she could do fo=
r your form? Well, you=20

are a set of slackers! That's my opinion of you. We manage our affairs bett=
er in the Transition."=20

"Oh, thank you! Thank you!" gasped Little Flaxen, lingering a moment or two=
 behind the others.=20

"You've been just great! I'll write to Dad to-night to send me some chocs, =
and I won't eat a single=20

one myself. They shall have them all. They shall really!"  With scarlet che=
eks and shining eyes she=20

was a different child from the weeping Niobe who had sat and sobbed on the =
steps.  "Now if I'd=20

simply coddled her and sympathized she'd have cried a few gallons more and =
have been no better=20

off," mused Irene, as her protegee danced away. "I fancy those juniors have=
 been fairly nasty to=20

her, though I wouldn't tell her so. Something ought to be done about it, bu=
t the question is 'what?' I=20

want to have a talk with Peachy when I can wedge in ten minutes of spare ti=
me."  All evening=20

remembrance of Little Flaxen's red eyes and white cheeks haunted Irene. She=
 felt it ought not to=20

have been possible for the child to be so lonely and neglected. Granted tha=
t her unpopularity=20

might be partly her own fault, boycotting was nevertheless hard to bear. It=
 was clearly somebody's=20

ts?" Irene asked=20

herself, but she gave up the answer, and appealed to Peachy at breakfast-ti=
me instead.  That=20

cheery young American took the matter more seriously than Irene expected. T=
here was a very=20

kind little heart hidden under her bubbles of fun.  "I'll call a meeting of=
 the Camellia Buds right=20

Prefects, did you say?=20

Humph! I don't call Rachel exactly laid out for this job. Bring your biscui=

ased in the house or=20

 scrimmage going on at=20

Desiree's piping, high-pitched voice:  "I haven't had a biscuit for days an=

this about?" asked Irene, striding into the crowd just in time to see Mabel=
 and another member of=20

the Transition pass, laughing, through the lower door.  There was a babel i=
