     Like lonely-parted wives,=20

the heaven       Sees all her charms depart.     And, molten in the cruel h=
eat       Of Indra's bolt, it=20

seems     As if the sky fell at our feet       In liquid, flowing streams. =
                               25  And yet=20

again:      The clouds first darkly rise, then darkly fall,     Send forth =
their floods of rain, and thunder=20

all;     Assuming postures strange and manifold,     Like men but newly ble=

26  _Courtier._ True.      The heaven is radiant with the lightning's glare=
;       Its laughter is the cry=20

of myriad cranes;     Its voice, the bolts that whistle through the air;   =
    Its dance, that bow whose=20

arrows are the rains.     It staggers at the winds, and seems to smoke     =
With clouds, which form=20

give thee of my love before,     That now thy clouds like mighty lions roar=
?     Ah no! Thou shouldst=20

your friend,      This golden cord that trembles on the breast     Of great=

And here, sir, is his house.=20

_Courtier._ You know all the arts, and need no instruction now. Yet love bi=

you enter here, you must not show yourself too angry.      Where anger is, =
there love is not;     Or=20

no! except for anger hot,       There is no love.      Be angry! make him a=

she's paying a compliment to my friend. [_Aloud._] Madam, here he is in the=
 dry orchard.=20

_Vasantasena._ But sir, what do you call a dry orchard?  _Maitreya._ Madam,=
 it's a place where=20

there's nothing to eat or drink, [_Vasantasena smiles._] Pray enter, madam.=
  _Vasantasena._=20

[_Aside to her maid._] What shall I say when I enter?  [87.17. S.  _Maid._ =
"Gambler, what luck this=20

evening?"  _Vasantasena._ Shall I dare to say it?  _Maid._ When the time co=
mes, it will say itself.=20

_Maitreya._ Enter, madam.  _Vasantasena._ [_Enters, approaches Charudatta, =
and strikes him=20

with the flowers which she holds._] Well, gambler, what luck this evening? =
 _Charudatta._=20

[_Discovers her._] Ah, Vasantasena is here. [_He rises joyfully._] Oh, my b=
eloved,      My evenings=20

pass in watching ever,       My nights from sighs are never free;     This =
evening marshalled in=20

ample and sonorous sentences. A certain fire he had, a limited power of ima=
gination, a cultivated=20

judgment, a taste, which suffered from bad workmanship; a true affection fo=
r rural life. These=20

hardly furnished him with matter adequate to support his elevated style. Hi=
s letters were regarded=20

as models of eloquence; but it is eloquence manufactured artificially and a=
pplied to subjects, not=20

proceeding from them. His _Prince_, a treatise on the virtues of kings, wit=
h a special reference to=20

Louis XIII., was received coldly. His _Aristippe_, which dealt with the man=
ners and morals of a=20

court, and his _Socrate Chretien_, a study in ethics and theology, were eff=
orts beyond his powers.=20

His gift to literature was a gift of method and of style; others who worked=
 in marble learned=20

something from his studious modellings in clay.  To regulate thought requir=
ed an intellect of a=20

different order from that of Balzac, "emperor of orators." It was the task =
of RENE DESCARTES=20

(1596-1650). A child of delicate health, born at La Haye, near Tours, he be=
came, under Jesuit=20

teachers, a precocious student both in languages and science. But truth, no=
t erudition, was the=20

demand and the necessity of his mind. Solitary investigations in mathematic=
s were for a time=20

succeeded by the life of a soldier in the Netherlands and Holland. The stre=
am of thought was=20

flowing, however, underground. Suddenly it emerged to light. In 1619, when =
the young volunteer=20

was in winter quarters at Neuburg, on the Danube, on a memorable day the fi=
rst principles of a=20

new philosophical method presented themselves to his intellect, and, as it =
were, claimed him for=20

their interpreter. After wanderings through various parts of Europe, and a =
period of studious leisure=20

in Paris, he chose Holland for his place of abode (1629), and though often =
shifting his residence,=20

little disturbed save by the controversies of philosophy and the orthodox z=
eal of Dutch theologians,=20

he gave his best hours during twenty years to thought. An invitation from Q=
ueen Christina to the=20

Swedish court was accepted in 1649. The change in his habits and the severi=
ty of a northern=20

winter proved fatal to the health which Descartes had carefully cherished; =
in February of 1650 he=20

was dead.  The mathematical cycle in the development of Descartes' system o=
f thought preceded=20

the metaphysical. His great achievements in analytical geometry, in optics,=
 in physical research,=20

his explanation of the laws of nature, and their application in his theory =
of the material universe,=20

belong to the history of science. Algebra and geometry led him towards his =
method in=20

metaphysical speculation. How do all primary truths verify themselves to th=
e human mind? By the=20

fact that an object is clearly and distinctly conceived. The objects of kno=
wledge fall into certain=20



groups or series; in each series there is some simple and dominant element =
which may be=20

immediately apprehended, and in relation to which the subordinate elements =
become intelligible.=20

Let us accept nothing on hearsay or authority; let us start with doubt in o=
rder to arrive at certitude;=20

let us test the criterion of certitude to the uttermost. There is one fact =
which I cannot doubt, even in=20

doubting all--I think, and if I think, I exist--"Je pense, donc je suis." N=
o other evidence of this is=20

needed than that our conception is clear and distinct; in this clearness an=
d distinctness we find the=20

principle of certitude. Mind, then, exists, and is known to us as a thinkin=
g substance. But the idea=20

of an infinite, perfect Being is also present to our intellect; we, finite,=
 imperfect beings, could not=20

have made it; unmake it we cannot; and in the conception of perfection that=
 of existence is=20

involved. Therefore God exists, and therefore the laws of our consciousness=
, which are His laws,=20

cannot deceive us. We have seen what mind or spirit signifies--a thinking s=
ubstance. Reduce our=20

idea of matter to clearness and distinctness, and what do we find? The idea=
 of an extended=20

substance. Our complex humanity, made up of soul and body, comprises both k=
inds of substance.=20

But thought and extension have nothing in common; their union can only be c=
onceived as the=20

collocation at a single point of a machine with that which raises it above =
a mere machine. As for=20

the lower animals, they are no more than automata.  Descartes' _Principia_ =
and his=20

_Meditationes_ were written in Latin. The _Discours de la Methode_ (1637) a=
nd the later _Traite=20

des Passions_ showed how the French language could be adapted to the purpos=
es of the reason.=20

Such eloquence as is found in Descartes is that of thought illuminating sty=
le. The theory of the=20

passions anticipates some of the tendencies of modern psychology in its phy=
sical investigations.=20

No one, however, affirmed more absolutely than Descartes the freedom of the=
 will--unless, indeed,=20

we regard it as determined by God: it cannot directly control the passions,=
 but it can indirectly=20

modify them with the aid of imagination; it is the supreme mistress of acti=
on, however the passions=20

may oppose its fiat. Spiritualist as he was, Descartes was not disposed to =
be the martyr of=20

thought. Warned by the example of Galileo, he did not desire to expose hims=
elf to the dangers=20

attending heretical opinions. He separated the province of faith from that =
of reason: "I revere our=20

theology," he said; but he held that theology demanded other lights than th=
ose of the unaided=20

powers of man. In its own province, he made the reason his absolute guide, =
and with results which=20

theologians might regard as dangerous.  The spirit of Descartes' work was i=
n harmony with that of=20

his time, and=20

In bringing you--my grief and me.                          37  You are very=

Pray be seated.  _Maitreya._ Here is a seat. Be seated, madam. [_Vasantasen=
a sits, then the=20

others._]  _Charudatta._ But see, my friend,      The dripping flower that =
decks her ear, droops=20

down,           And one sweet breast     Anointed is, like a prince who wea=
rs the crown,           With=20

a's garments are wet. Let other,=20

and most beautiful, garments be brought.  _Maitreya._ Yes, sir.  _Maid._ Go=
od Maitreya, do you=20

stay here. I will wait upon my mistress. [_She does so._]  _Maitreya._ [_As=
ide to Charudatta._] My=20

friend, I'd just like to ask the lady a question.  _Charudatta._ Then do so=
.  _Maitreya._ of reason;=20

he made clearness a criterion of truth; he proclaimed man a spirit; he asse=
rted the freedom of the=20

will. The art of the classical period sought also for general truths, and s=
ubordinated imagination to=20

reason. It turned away from ingenuities, obscurities, mysteries; it was ess=
entially spiritualist; it=20

represented the crises and heroic victories of the will.  Descartes' oppone=
nt, Pierre Gassendi=20

(1592-1655), epicurean in his physics, an empiricist, though an inconsisten=
t one, in philosophy,=20

chose the Latin language as the vehicle for his ideas. A group of writers w=
hose tendencies were=20

towards sensualism or scepticism, viewed him as their master. Chapelle in v=
erse, La Mothe le=20

Vayer in prose, may serve as representatives of art surrendering itself to =
vulgar pleasures, and=20

rahman is very plain-

spoken.  P. 148.17]  _Vasantasena._ You might better call him clever.  _Mai=
d._ My mistress came=20

to ask how much that pearl necklace is worth.  _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charu=
datta._] There! I told=20

you so. She thinks the pearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket is ex=
pensive. She isn't=20

satisfied. She has come to look for something more.  _Maid._ For my mistres=
s imagined that it=20

was her own, and gambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-maste=
r has gone, for=20

he is employed in the king's business.  _Maitreya._ Madam, you are simply r=
epeating what=20

somebody said before.  _Maid._ While we are looking for him, pray take this=
 golden casket. [_She=20

displays the casket._ _Maitreya hesitates._] Sir, you examine it very close=
ly. Did you ever see it=20

before?  _Maitreya._ No, madam, but the skilful workmanship captivates the =
eye.  _Maid._ Your=20

repose in indifference.  The true successor of Descartes in French philosop=
hy, eminent in the=20

second half of the century, was NICOLAS DE MALEBRANCHE (1638-1715). Soul an=
d body,=20

Descartes had shown, are in their very nature alien each from the other. Ho=
w then does the soul=20

attain a knowledge of the external world? In God, the absolute substance, a=
re the ideas of all=20

things; in God we behold those ideas which matter could never convey to us,=
 and which we could=20

never ourselves originate; in God we see and know all things. The _Recherch=
e de la Verite_=20

(1674-75) was admirably written and was widely read. The theologians found =
it dangerous; and=20
