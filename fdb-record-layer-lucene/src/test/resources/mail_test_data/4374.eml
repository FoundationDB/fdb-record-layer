philodendron monstera from the Deanery! Come in! You might knock me down wi=
th a----!  BLORE.  [_Entering and shaking hands mournfully._] How do you do=
, Mrs. Topping?  HANNAH.  And how is the dear Dean, bless him; the sweetest=
 soul in the world?  BLORE.  [_To himself._] Good gracious! She doesn't kno=
w of hour misfortune. [_To HANNAH._] I--I 'aven't seen him this morning!  H=
ANNAH.  Well, Belmont, but more spiritual than any Italian night because of=
 that soft heavenly lingering of the day which belongs to the north. This y=
oung pair had not been married very long, and had not ceased to think their=
 happiness the chief and most reasonable subject of interest to all around =
them. They were still comparing themselves with everything in earth, and al=
most in philodendron monstera from the Deanery! Come in! You might knock me=
 down with a----!  BLORE.  [_Entering and shaking hands mournfully._] How d=
o you do, Mrs. Topping?  HANNAH.  And how is the dear Dean, bless him; the =
sweetest soul in the world?  BLORE.  [_To himself._] Good gracious! She doe=
sn't know of hour misfortune. [_To HANNAH._] I--I 'aven't seen him this mor=
ning!  HANNAH.  Well, Belmont, but more spiritual than any Italian night be=
cause of that soft heavenly lingering of the day which belongs to the north=
. This young pair had not been married very long, and had not ceased to thi=
nk their happiness the chief and most reasonable subject of interest to all=
 around them. They were still comparing themselves with everything in earth=
, and almost in _
I like Aunt.  SALOME.  So do I. But she's not my idea of a weary fragment o=
r a chastened widow.=20

THE DEAN.  My dear Georgiana, I rejoice that you meet me in this affectiona=
te spirit, and when--

pardon me--when you have a little caught the _tone_ of the Deanery----  GEO=
RGIANA.  Oh, I'll=20

catch it; if I don't the Deanery will a little catch _my_ tone--the same th=
ing.  [_SHEBA laughs._=20

THE DEAN.  [_Reprovingly._] Toy-child!  GEORGIANA.  Trust George Tidd for s=
etting things quite=20

square in a palace or a puddle.  THE DEAN.  George Tidd! Who is George Tidd=
?  GEORGIANA.  I=20

am George Tidd--that was my racing name. Ask after George Tidd at Newmarket=
--they'll tell you=20

all about me. My colors were crimson and black diamonds. There you are.  [_=
Producing her=20

pocket-handkerchief, which is crimson and black._  THE DEAN.  Dear me! Very=
 interesting!=20

Georgiana, my dear. One moment, children.  [_The girls go into the Library.=
_  THE DEAN.=20

[_Tapping the handkerchief._] I understand distinctly from your letter that=
 all this is finally=20

abandoned?  GEORGIANA.  Worse luck! They'll never see my colors at the post=
 again!  THE=20

DEAN.  And the contemplation of sport generally as a mental distraction----=
?  GEORGIANA.  Oh,=20

yes--I dare say you'll manage to wean me from that, too, in time.  THE DEAN=
.  In time! Well, but--

Georgiana!  [_The gate bell is heard again, the girls re-enter._  GEORGIANA=
.  There's a visitor. I'll=20

tootle upstairs and have a groom down. [_To SALOME and SHEBA._] Make the ru=
nning, girls. At=20

what time do we feed, Augustin?  THE DEAN.  There is luncheon at one o'cloc=
k.  GEORGIANA.=20

Right. The air here is so fresh I sha'n't be sorry to get my nose-bag on.  =
[_She stalks out,=20

accompanied by the girls._  THE DEAN.  My sister, Georgiana--my widowed sis=
ter, Georgiana.=20

Dear me, I am quite disturbed. Surely, surely the serene atmosphere of the =
Deanery will work a=20

change. It must! It must! If not, what a grave mistake I have made. Good gr=
acious! No, no, I won't=20

think of it! Still, it is a little unfortunate that poor Georgiana should a=
rrive here on the very eve of=20

these terrible races at St. Marvells.  _BLORE enters with a card._  THE DEA=
N.  Who is it, Blore?=20

[_Reading the card._] "Sir Tristram Mardon." Dear, dear! Certainly, Blore, =
certainly. [_BLORE goes=20

out._] Mardon--why, Mardon and I haven't met since Oxford.  [_BLORE re-ente=
rs, showing in SIR=20

TRISTRAM MARDON, a well-preserved man of about fifty, with a ruddy face and=
 jovial manner,=20

the type of the thorough English sporting gentleman. BLORE goes out._  SIR =
TRISTRAM.  Hullo,=20

Jedd, how are you?  THE DEAN.  My dear Mardon--are we boys again?  SIR TRIS=
TRAM.=20

[_Boisterously._] Of course we are! Boys again!  [_He hits THE DEAN violent=
ly in the chest._  THE=20

DEAN.  [_Breathing heavily--to himself._] I quite forgot how rough Mardon u=
sed to be. How it all=20

comes back to me!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Think I'm changed?  THE DEAN.  Only in ap=
pearance!  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  I'm still a bachelor--got terribly jilted by a woman years ago a=
nd have run in blinkers=20

ever since. Can't be helped, can it? You're married, aren't you?  THE DEAN.=
  [_With dignity._] I=20

have been a widower for fifteen years.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Oh lor'! awfully sor=
ry--can't be helped=20

though, can it? [_Seizing THE DEAN'S hand and squeezing it._] Forgive me, o=
ld chap.  THE=20

DEAN.  [_Withdrawing his hand with pain._] O-o-oh!  SIR TRISTRAM.  I've re-=
opened an old=20

wound--damned stupid of me!  THE DEAN.  Hush, Mardon! Please!  SIR TRISTRAM=
.  All right.=20

What do you think I'm down here for?  THE DEAN.  For the benefit of your he=
alth, Mardon?  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Ha! ha! Never had an ache in my life; sha'n't come and hear you =
preach next=20

Sunday, Gus.  THE DEAN.  I do not preach next Sunday!  SIR TRISTRAM.  You'd=
 better not! No,=20

I'm here for the races.  THE DEAN.  The races! Hush, my dear Mardon, my gir=
ls----  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Girls! May I trot 'em into the paddock to-morrow?  THE DEAN.  Th=
ank you, no.  SIR=20



TRISTRAM.  Think it over. You've seen the list of Starters for the Durnston=
e Handicap----?  THE=20

DEAN.  No, I haven't.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Not! Look here! Sir Tristram Mardon's=
 Dandy Dick, nine=20

stone two, Tom Gallawood up! What do you think of that?  THE DEAN.  I don't=
 think of anything=20

like that!  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Digging THE DEAN in the ribs._] Look out for m=
y colors--black and=20

white, and a pink cap--first past the post to-morrow.  THE DEAN.  Really, m=
y dear Mardon----  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Good heavens! Jedd, they talk about Bonny Betsy.  THE DEAN.  I g=
rieve to hear it.=20

The tongue of scandal----  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Taking THE DEAN'S arm and walki=
ng him about._]=20

Do you imagine, sir, for one moment, that Bonny Betsy, with a boy on her ba=
ck, can get down that=20

bill with those legs of hers?  THE DEAN.  Another _horse_, I presume?  SIR =
TRISTRAM.  No, a=20

bay mare. George Tidd knew what she was about when she stuck to Dandy Dick =
to the very last.=20

THE DEAN.  [_Aghast._] George--Tidd?  SIR TRISTRAM.  Georgiana Tidman. Dand=
y came out of=20

her stable after she smashed.  THE DEAN.  Bless me!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Poor ol=
d George! I=20

wonder what's become of her.  THE DEAN.  My dear Mardon, I am of course hea=
rtily pleased to=20

revive in this way our old acquaintance. I wish it were in my power to offe=
r you the hospitality of=20

the Deanery--but----  SIR TRISTRAM.  Don't name it. My horse and I are over=
 the way at "The=20

Swan." Come and look at Dandy Dick!  THE DEAN.  Mardon, you don't understan=
d. My position in=20

St. Marvells----  SIR TRISTRAM.  Oh, I see, Jedd. I beg your pardon. You me=
an that the colors=20

you ride in don't show up well on the hill yonder or in the stable of the "=
Swan" Inn.  THE DEAN.=20

You must remember----  SIR TRISTRAM.  I remember that in your young days yo=
u made the=20

heaviest book on the Derby of any of our fellows.  THE DEAN.  I always lost=
, Mardon; indeed, I=20

always lost!  SIR TRISTRAM.  I remember that you once matched a mare of you=
r own against=20

another of Lord Beckslade's for fifty pounds!  THE DEAN.  Yes, but she wasn=
't in it, Mardon--I=20

mean she was dreadfully beaten.  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Shaking his head sorrowfu=
lly._] Oh Jedd,=20

Jedd--other times, other manners. Good-bye, old boy.  THE DEAN.  You're not=
--you're not=20

offended, Mardon?  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Taking THE DEAN'S hand._] Offended! No-=
-only sorry,=20

Dean, damned sorry, to see a promising lad come to an end like this. [_GEOR=
GIANA enters with=20

SALOME on one side of her and SHEBA on the other--all three laughing and ch=
atting, apparently=20

the best of friends._] By Jove! No! what--Tidd?  GEORGIANA.  Hullo, Mardon!=
  [_They shake=20

hands warmly._  SIR TRISTRAM.  Of all places in the world, to find "Mr. Tid=
d!" [_Roaring with=20

laughter._] Ho! ho! ho!  GEORGIANA.  [_Laughing._] Ha! ha!  SIR TRISTRAM.  =
Why, Dean,=20

you've been chaffing me, have you?  THE DEAN.  No!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Yes, you=
 have--you've=20

been roasting your old friend!  THE DEAN.  [_With dignity._] Mardon!  SIR T=
RISTRAM.  Tidd is a=20

pal of yours, eh? Ho! ho!  GEORGIANA.  Ha! ha!  THE DEAN.  Sir Tristram Mar=
don, Mrs. Tidman=20

is my sister.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Your sister?  GEORGIANA.  Yes, I've been runn=
ing a bit dark,=20

Mardon, but that stout, well-seasoned animal over there and this skittish c=
reature come of the=20

same stock and were foaled in the same stable. [_Pointing to SALOME and SHE=
BA._] There are a=20

couple of yearlings here, you don't know. My nieces--Salome and Sheba.  SIR=
 TRISTRAM.=20

[_Bowing._] How do you do? [_Heartily taking GEORGIANA'S hand again._] Well=
, I don't care=20

whose sister you are, but I'm jolly glad to see you, George, my boy.  GEORG=
IANA.  Gracious,=20

Tris, don't squeeze my hand so!  THE DEAN.  [_In horror._] Salome, Sheba, c=
hildren! I must=20

speak to you. Excuse me, Mardon. [_To himself._] Oh, what shall I do with m=
y widowed sister?=20

[_He goes into the garden._  SHEBA.  [_To SALOME._] That's like pa, just as=
 we were getting=20



interested.  SALOME.  We'll come back in a minute.  [_They go out by the wi=
ndow._  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Lord! How odd! You know your brother and I were at Oxford togeth=
er, George?=20

GEORGIANA.  Were you, Tris! Then are you putting up here?  SIR TRISTRAM.  H=
e won't have=20

me.  GEORGIANA.  Won't have you!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Because I'm down here raci=
ng. You see,=20

he's a Dean.  GEORGIANA.  Is he? Well, then, you just lay a thousand sovere=
igns to a=20

gooseberry that in this house I'm a Dean, too!  SIR TRISTRAM.  I suppose he=
's thinking of the=20

Canons--and the Bishop--and those chaps.  GEORGIANA.  Lord bless your heart=
, they're all right=20

when you cheer them up a bit! If I'm here till the autumn meeting you'll fi=
nd me lunching on the hill,=20

with the Canons marking my card and the dear old Bishop mixing the salad. S=
o say the word, Tris-

-I'll make it all right with Augustin.  SIR TRISTRAM.  No, thanks, old fell=
ow. The fact is I'm fixed at=20

the "Swan" with--what do you think, George?--with Dandy Dick.  GEORGIANA.  =
Oh! my old=20

Dandy!  SIR TRISTRAM.  I brought him down with me in lavender. You know he =
runs for the=20

Durnstone Handicap to-morrow.  GEORGIANA.  Know! There's precious little th=
at horse does that=20

I don't know, and what I don't know I dream. Is he fit?  SIR TRISTRAM.  As =
a fiddle--shines like a=20

mirror--not an ounce too much or too little. He'll romp in!  GEORGIANA.  He=
'll dance in! Tris=20

Mardon!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Eh?  GEORGIANA.  [_Mysteriously._] Tris, Dandy Dick=
 doesn't belong=20

to you--not _all_ of him.  SIR TRISTRAM.  No--I've only a half share. At yo=
ur sale he was knocked=20

down to John Fielder the trainer. The other half belongs to John.  GEORGIAN=
A.  No, it doesn't, it=20

belongs to _me!_  SIR TRISTRAM.  George!  GEORGIANA.  Yes, directly I saw D=
andy Dick=20

marched out before the auctioneer I asked John Fielder to help me, and he d=
id, like a Briton. For I=20

can't live without horseflesh, if it's only a piece of cat's meat on a skew=
er. But when I=20

condescended to keep company with the Canons and the Bishop here I promised=
 Augustin that I=20

wouldn't own anything on four legs, so John sold you half of Dick, and I ca=
n swear I don't own a=20

horse--and I don't--not a whole one. But half a horse is better than no bre=
ad, Tris--and we're=20

partners.  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Roaring with laughter._] Ho! ho! ha! ha! ha!  G=
EORGIANA.  What=20

are you laughing at, man?  SIR TRISTRAM.  Oh, the Dean! the Dean!  _SALOME =
and SHEBA=20

enter unperceived._  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Still laughing._] I--ho! ho!--I beg y=
our pardon, George--

ha! ha! Well, now you know he's fit, of course, you're going to back Dandy =
Dick for the Durnstone=20

Handicap.  GEORGIANA.  Back him! For every penny I've got in the world. Tha=
t isn't much, but if=20

I'm not a richer woman by a thousand pounds to-morrow night I shall have ha=
d a bad day.=20

SALOME.  Oh, Sheba!  [_The girls come towards the Library._  GEORGIANA.  [_=
Discovering=20

them._] Hush! [_To the girls._] Hallo!  SHEBA.  It's only us, Aunt.  [_The =
girls go into the Library._=20

SIR TRISTRAM.  I'll be off.  GEORGIANA.  Keep your eye on the old horse, Tr=
istram.  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Don't fear. Good-morning, George!  GEORGIANA.  Good-morning, par=
tner! [_SIR=20

TRISTRAM bursts out laughing again, she joining in the laughter._] Oh, do b=
e quiet!  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! Oh, say good-bye for me to the Dean! [_She g=
ives him a push=20

and he goes out._  _SHEBA and SALOME immediately re-enter from the Library.=
_  SHEBA.  Aunt-

-dear Aunt----  GEORGIANA.  Well, girls?  SHEBA.  Aunt--Salome has somethin=
g to say to you.=20

SALOME.  No, it's Sheba.  GEORGIANA.  Why, you're shivering all over. [_Cat=
ching hold of=20

SHEBA._] Hallo, little 'un!  SHEBA.  Aunt--dear Aunt Georgiana--we heard yo=
u say something=20

about a thousand pounds.  GEORGIANA.  You've been listening?  SHEBA.  No--w=
e only merely=20

heard. And, oh, Aunt, a thousand pounds is such a lot, and we poor girls wa=
nt such a little.=20



GEORGIANA.  Money?  SHEBA.  Yes. Salome has rather got into debt.  GEORGIAN=
A.  My=20

gracious!  SALOME.  I haven't, any more than you have, Sheba.  SHEBA.  Well=
, I'm in debt too,=20

but I only meant to beg for Salome; but now I ask for both of us. Oh, Aunt =
Tidman, papa has told=20

us that you have known troubles.  GEORGIANA.  So I have--heaps of them.  SH=
EBA.  Oh, I'm so=20

glad. Because Salome and I are weary fragments too--we're everything awful =
but chastened=20

widows. We owe forty pounds unknown to Pa!  SALOME.  Forty pounds, nineteen=
.  GEORGIANA.=20

Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, you girls!  SHEBA.  We are!  SA=
LOME.  We are!=20

GEORGIANA.  To cry and go on like this about forty pounds!  SHEBA.  But we'=
ve only got fifteen=20

and threepence of our own in the world! And, oh, Aunt, you know something a=
bout the Races,=20

don't you?  GEORGIANA.  Eh?  SHEBA.  If you do, help two poor creatures to =
win forty pounds,=20

nineteen. Aunt Georgiana, what's "Dandy Dick" you were talking to that gent=
leman about?=20

GEORGIANA.  Child! Dandy Dick's a horse.  SHEBA.  We thought so. Then let D=
andy Dick win=20

_us_ some money.  GEORGIANA.  No, no! I won't hear of it!  SHEBA.  Oh, do, =
do!  SALOME.=20

Oh, do, do, do!  GEORGIANA.  Go away--I won't. I say decidedly, I will not!=
  SHEBA.  Oh, do, do!=20

SALOME.  Do! Do, and we'll love you for ever and ever, Aunt Georgiana.  GEO=
RGIANA.  You will!=20

[_She embraces them heartily._] Bless your little innocent faces! Do you wa=
nt to win forty pounds?=20

SALOME _and_ SHEBA.  Yes, yes!  GEORGIANA.  Do you want to win _fifty_ poun=
ds?  SHEBA=20

and SALOME.  Oh, yes, yes!  GEORGIANA.  [_Taking her betting book from her =
pocket._] Very=20

well, then, put your very petticoats on Dandy Dick!  [_The girls stand clut=
ching their skirts,=20

frightened._  SALOME.  Oh!  SHEBA.  Oh!  END OF THE FIRST ACT.    THE SECON=
D ACT.=20

The morning-room at the Deanery, with the fire and the lamps lighted. It is=
 after dinner.  SHEBA is=20

playing the piano, SALOME lolling upon the settee, and GEORGIANA pouring ou=
t tea. They are in=20

evening dress.  GEORGIANA.  Sugar, Sally? I call you Sally, Salome--the eve=
ning's too short for=20

your name.  SALOME.  All right, Aunt George--two lumps, please.  GEORGIANA.=
  [_To SHEBA._]=20

Little 'un?  SHEBA.  Two lumps and one in the saucer, to eat.  GEORGIANA.  =
Quite a relief to=20

shake off the gentlemen, isn't it?  SALOME.  Do you think so, Aunt?  SHEBA.=
  Oh, _I_ don't think=20

so.  GEORGIANA.  H'm! Now I understand why my foot was always in the way un=
der the dinner-

table.  [_She holds out two cups, which the girls take from her._  SALOME. =
 I thought the dinner=20

was an overwhelming success.  SHEBA.  All our dinners are at the Deanery.  =
GEORGIANA.=20

Awfully jolly. Mutton was overdone.  SALOME.  That's our new cook's one fai=
ling.  GEORGIANA.=20

But the potatoes weren't--they rattled.  SHEBA.  Cook never can manage pota=
toes.=20

GEORGIANA.  What was wrong with the custards?  SALOME.  Well, it was Cook's=
 first attempt at=20

custards.  GEORGIANA.  However, they served one useful end. Now we _know_ t=
he chimney=20

wants sweeping.  SALOME.  But it was a frightfully jolly dinner--take it al=
l round.  SHEBA.  Yes,=20

take it all round. One has to take things all round.  GEORGIANA.  What made=
 us all so sad and=20

silent--taking us all round?  SHEBA.  Dear Papa was as lively as an owl wit=
h neuralgia.=20

GEORGIANA.  Major Tarver isn't a conversational cracker.  SALOME.  Gerald T=
arver has no liver-

-to speak of.  GEORGIANA.  He might have spoken about his lungs or somethin=
g, to cheer us up.=20

SHEBA.  I fancy Mr. Darbey was about to make a witty remark once.  GEORGIAN=
A.  Yes, and=20

then the servant handed him a dish and he shied at it. So we lost that.  SA=
LOME.  Still, we ought=20

to congratulate ourselves upon--upon a----  SHEBA.  Upon a--upon a----  GEO=
RGIANA.  Upon a=20

frightfully jolly dinner. [_Taking her betting book from her pocket._] Excu=
se me, girls. I've some=20



figures to work out. If Dandy Dick hasn't fed better at the "Swan" than we =
have at the Deanery, he=20

won't be in the first three. [_Reckoning._] Let me see.  SALOME.  [_To SHEB=
A._] All's settled,=20

Sheba, isn't it?  SHEBA.  [_To SALOME._] Yes--everything. Directly the hous=
e is silent we let=20

ourselves out at the front door.  SALOME.  How do we get in again?  SHEBA. =
 By this window. It=20

has a patent safety fastening, so it can be opened with a hairpin.  SALOME.=
  We're courageous=20

girls, aren't we?  SHEBA.  Yes, I don't consider we're ordinary young ladie=
s, at all.  SALOME.  If=20

we had known Aunt a little longer we might have confided in her and taken h=
er with us.  SHEBA.=20

Poor Aunt--we mustn't spoil her.  DARBEY.  [_Speaking outside._] I venture =
to differ with you, my=20

dear Dean.  GEORGIANA.  Here come the wax-works!  [_She joins the girls as =
DARBEY enters=20

through the Library, patronizing THE DEAN, who accompanies him._  DARBEY.  =
Haw! I've just=20

been putting the Dean right about a little army question, Mrs.--Mrs.---- I =
can't catch your name.=20

GEORGIANA.  Don't try--you'd come out in spots, like measles.  [DARBEY _sta=
nds by her,=20

blankly, then attempts a conversation._  THE DEAN.  [_To SALOME and SHEBA._=
] Children, it is=20

useless to battle against it much longer.  SALOME.  Against what, Papa?  TH=
E DEAN.  A feeling=20

of positive distaste for Mr. Darbey.  SHEBA.  Oh, Papsey--think what Wellin=
gton was at his age.=20

_MAJOR TARVER enters, pale and haggard._  _SALOME meets him._  SALOME.  Maj=
or!=20

TARVER.  [_With a gasp._] Oh!  SALOME.  Not well again?  TARVER.  Indigesti=
on. I'm always=20

like this after dinner.  SALOME.  But what would you do if the trumpet summ=
oned you to battle?=20

TARVER.  Oh, I suppose I should pack up a few charcoal biscuits and toddle =
out, you know.=20

GEORGIANA.  [_To DARBEY._] I've never studied the Army Guide.  DARBEY.  You=
're thinking of-

---  GEORGIANA.  The Turf Guide--beg pardon. I mean, the Army keeps a strin=
g of trained nurses,=20

doesn't it?  DARBEY.  There _are_ Army nurses.  GEORGIANA.  Certainly. I wa=
s wondering=20

whether your Colonel will send one with a perambulator to fetch you at abou=
t half-past eight.=20

[_She leaves DARBEY and goes to THE DEAN. SHEBA joins DARBEY at the piano._=
=20

GEORGIANA.  Well, Gus, my boy, you seem out of condition.  THE DEAN.  I'm r=
ather anxious for=20

the post to bring to-day's "Times." You know I've offered a thousand pounds=
 to our Restoration=20

Fund.  GEORGIANA.  What!  THE DEAN.  Hush--I'll tell you.  [_They talk in u=
ndertones. BLORE=20

enters to remove the tea-tray._  TARVER.  [_Jumping up excitedly--to SALOME=
._] Eh? Oh,=20

certainly--delighted! [_Singing to himself._] "Come into the garden, Maud, =
for the black bat----"=20

SALOME.  Now you're yourself again.  TARVER.  I'm always dreadfully excited=
 when I'm asked to=20

sing. It's as good as a carbonate of soda lozenge to me to be asked to sing=
. [_To BLORE._] My=20

music is in my overcoat pocket.  [_BLORE crosses to the door._  SHEBA.  And=
 Mr. Darbey has=20

brought his violin.  TARVER.  [_In a rage, glaring at DARBEY._] Hah! There =
now!  DARBEY.  [_To=20

BLORE._] You'll find it in the hall.  [_BLORE goes out. THE DEAN dozes in a=
 chair. SALOME and=20

SHEBA talk to GEORGIANA at the table._  TARVER.  [_To himself._] He always =
presumes with=20

his confounded fiddle when I'm going to entertain. He knows that his fiddle=
's never hoarse and that=20

I am, sometimes.  DARBEY.  [_To himself._] Tarver always tries to cut me ou=
t with his elderly=20

Chest C. He ought to put it on the Retired List.  TARVER.  I'll sing him of=
f his legs to-night--I'm in=20

lovely voice.  [_He walks into the Library and is heard trying his voice, s=
inging "Come into the=20

garden, Maud."_  DARBEY.  [_To himself._] He needn't bother himself. While =
he was dozing in the=20

carriage I threw his music out of the window.  _TARVER re-enters triumphant=
ly._  _BLORE re-

enters, carrying a violin-case and a leather music roll. DARBEY takes the v=
iolin-case, opens it,=20



and produces his violin and music. BLORE hands the music roll to TARVER and=
 goes out._=20

TARVER.  [_To SALOME, trembling with excitement._] My tones are like a beau=
tiful bell this=20

evening. I'm so glad, for all our sakes. [_As he takes the leather music ro=
ll from BLORE._] Thank=20

you, that's it.  SALOME.  What will you begin with?  TARVER.  "Come into th=
e garden, Maud." I've=20

begun with "Corne into the garden, Maud" for years and years. [_He opens th=
e music roll--it is=20

empty._] Oh! Miss Jedd, I've forgotten my music!  SALOME _and_ SHEBA.  Oh! =
Major Tarver!=20

[_TARVER with a groan of despair sinks on to the settee._  SHEBA.  Never mi=
nd--Mr. Darbey will=20

play.  DARBEY.  [_Tuning his violin._] Will you accompany me?  SHEBA.  [_Ra=
ising her eyes._]=20

To the end of the world.  [_She sits at the piano._  DARBEY.  My mother say=
s that my bowing is=20

something like Joachim's, and she ought to know.  SHEBA.  Why?  DARBEY.  Oh=
, because she's=20

heard Joachim.  [_DARBEY plays and SHEBA accompanies him. SALOME sits besid=
e TARVER._=20

GEORGIANA.  [_To herself._] Well, after all, George, my boy, you're not sta=
bled in such a bad=20

box! Here is a regular pure, simple, English Evening at Home!  THE DEAN.  [=
_Mumbling to=20

himself._] A thousand pounds to the Restoration Fund and all those bills to=
 settle--oh dear! oh=20

dear! What shall I do?  SALOME.  [_To herself._] I hope my ball-dress will =
drive all the other=20

women mad!  TARVER.  [_To himself--glaring at DARBEY._] I feel I should lik=
e to garrote him with=20

his bass string.  GEORGIANA.  [_Frowning at her betting book._] I think I s=
hall hedge a bit over=20

the Crumbleigh Stakes.  DARBEY.  [_As he plays, glancing at TARVER._] I won=
der how old=20

Tarver's Chest C likes a holiday.  SHEBA.  [_As she plays._] We must get Pa=
 to bed early. Dear=20

Papa's always so dreadfully in the way.  GEORGIANA.  [_Looking around._] No=
--there's nothing=20

like it in any other country. A regular, pure, simple, English Evening at H=
ome!  _BLORE enters=20

quickly, cutting "The Times" with a paper-knife as he enters._  BLORE.  The=
 paper's just arrived.=20

[_The music stops abruptly--all the ladies glare at BLORE and hush him down=
._  GEORGIANA,=20

SALOME, _and_ SHEBA.  Sssssh!  THE DEAN.  [_Taking the paper from BLORE._] =
This is my=20

fault--there may be something in "The Times" of special interest to me. Tha=
nk you, Blore.=20

[_BLORE goes out._  TARVER.  Ha, ha, ha! spoilt his pianissimo!  THE DEAN. =
 [_Scanning the=20

paper._] Oh, I can't believe it!  GEORGIANA.  What's the matter?  SALOME _a=
nd_ SHEBA.=20

Papa!  TARVER _and_ DARBEY.  The Dean!  THE DEAN.  Children! Georgiana! Fri=
ends! My=20

munificent offer has produced the desired result.  SALOME _and_ SHEBA.  Oh!=
  THE DEAN.=20

Seven wealthy people, including three brewers, have come forward with a tho=
usand pounds=20

apiece in aid of the restoration of the Minster Spire!  SALOME _and_ SHEBA.=
  [_Horrified._] Ah!=20

GEORGIANA.  That means a cool thousand out of your pocket, Gus.  THE DEAN. =
 Yes.=20

[_Reading._] "The anxiety to which The Dean of St. Marvells has so long bee=
n a victim will now=20

doubtless be relieved." [_With his hand to his head._] I suppose I shall fe=
el the relief to-morrow.=20

GEORGIANA.  What's wrong with the Spire? Nobody sleeps in it?  THE DEAN.  I=
t _is_ a little out=20

of repair--but hardly sufficiently so to warrant the presumptuous interfere=
nce of three brewers.=20

Excuse me, I think I'll enjoy the fresh air for a moment. [_He goes to the =
window and draws back=20

the curtains--a bright red glare is seen in the sky._] Bless me! Look there=
!  GEORGIANA,=20

SALOME, _and_ SHEBA.  Oh! what's that?  THE DEAN.  It's a conflagration!  S=
ALOME.=20

[_Clinging to TARVER._] Where is it? Are we safe?  SHEBA.  [_Clinging to DA=
RBEY._] Where is=20

it? Are we safe?  GEORGIANA.  Where is it?  _BLORE enters with a scared loo=
k._  THE DEAN.=20

[_To BLORE._] Where is it?  ALL.  Where is it?  BLORE.  The old Swan Inn's =
a-fire!  [_The gate-



bell is heard ringing violently in the distance. BLORE goes out._  GEORGIAN=
A.  [_Uttering a loud=20

screech._] The Swan Inn! [_Madly._] You girls, get me a hat and coat. Someb=
ody fetch me a pair=20

of boots!  [_SALOME, SHEBA, and TARVER go to the window._  THE DEAN.  Georg=
iana!=20

GEORGIANA.  Don't talk to me! [_To TARVER._] Lend me your boots!  TARVER.  =
I daren't. If I=20

once get cold extremities----  GEORGIANA.  Ah!  [_She is going, THE DEAN st=
ops her._  THE=20

DEAN.  Respect yourself, Georgiana--where are you going?  GEORGIANA.  Going=
! I'm going to=20

help clear the stables at The Swan!  THE DEAN.  Remember what you are--my s=
ister--a lady!=20

GEORGIANA.  I'm not. George Tidd's a man, every inch of her! [_SIR TRISTRAM=
 rushes in=20

breathlessly. GEORGIANA rushes at him and clutches his coat._] Tris Mardon,=
 speak!  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  [_Exhausted._] Oh!  GEORGIANA.  The horse? The horse! You've got=
 him out?  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  Yes, safe and sound.  GEORGIANA.  Safe and sound! That old horse=
 has backed=20

himself to win the handicap.  [_She sinks into a chair. TARVER and DARBEY w=
ith SALOME and=20

SHEBA stand looking out of the window._  SIR TRISTRAM.  George, his tail is=
 singed a bit.=20

GEORGIANA.  The less weight for him to carry to-morrow. [_Beginning to cry.=
_] Dear old Dandy,=20

he never was much to look at.  SIR TRISTRAM.  The worst of it is, the fools=
 threw two pails of cold=20

water over him to put it out.  GEORGIANA.  Oh! that's done him!  THE DEAN. =
 Now, my dear=20

Georgiana! what is a horse?  GEORGIANA.  A living example to a Dean. [_THE =
DEAN goes=20

distractedly into the Library._] Where is the animal?  SIR TRISTRAM.  My ma=
n Hatcham is=20

running him up and down the lane here to try to get him warm again.  GEORGI=
ANA.  Where are=20

you going to put the homeless beast up now?  SIR TRISTRAM.  I don't know.  =
GEORGIANA.=20

[_Starting up._] I do though!  THE DEAN.  Madwoman! What are you going to d=
o?  GEORGIANA.=20

Bring Dandy Dick into our stables!  THE DEAN.  No, no!  SIR TRISTRAM.  The =
very place!  THE=20

DEAN.  Georgiana, pray consider _me!_  GEORGIANA.  So I will, when you've h=
ad two pails of=20

water thrown over you.  [_THE DEAN walks about in despair._  THE DEAN.  Mar=
don, I appeal to=20

_you!_  SIR TRISTRAM.  Oh, Dean, Dean, I'm ashamed of you!  GEORGIANA.  [_T=
o SIR=20

TRISTRAM._] Are you ready?  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Takes off his coat and throws =
it over=20

GEORGIANA'S shoulders._] George, you're a brick!  GEORGIANA.  A brick, am I=
? [_Quietly to=20

him._] One partner pulls Dandy out of the Swan--t'other one leads Dandy int=
o the Deanery. Quits,=20

my lad!  [_They go out together._  THE DEAN.  What is happening to me! It w=
ill be in all the=20

sporting papers. "Sir Tristram Mardon's Dandy Dick reflected great credit u=
pon the Deanery=20

Stables!" "The Sporting Dean!"  [_He walks into the Library, where he sinks=
 into a chair, as=20

SALOME, TARVER, DARBEY and SHEBA come from the window._  TARVER.  They're g=
etting=20

the flames under. If I had had my goloshes with me I should have been here,=
 there, and=20

everywhere.  DARBEY.  Where there's a crowd of Civilians the Military exerc=
ise a wise discretion=20

in restraining themselves.  SHEBA.  [_To TARVER and DARBEY._] You had bette=
r go now; then=20

we'll get the house quiet as soon as possible. Poor Papa looks worried.  SH=
EBA _and_ SALOME.=20

Poor Papa!  TARVER.  We will wait with the carriage in the lane.  SALOME.  =
Yes, yes. [_Calling._]=20

Papa, Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey must go.  [_She rings the bell. THE DEAN =
comes from the=20

Library._  THE DEAN.  Dear me, I'm very remiss!  TARVER.  [_Shaking hands._=
] Most fascinating=20

evening!  DARBEY.  [_Shaking hands._] Charming, my dear Dean.  _BLORE enter=
s._  SALOME.=20

Major Tarver's carriage.  BLORE.  Hat the gate, Miss Salome.  SALOME.  Don'=
t risk the cold,=20

Papa.  [_BLORE goes out, followed by SHEBA, SALOME, and TARVER. DARBEY is g=
oing, when=20



he returns to THE DEAN._  DARBEY.  By-the-bye, my dear Dean--come over and =
see me. We=20

ought to know more of each other. Say Monday.  THE DEAN.  [_Restraining his=
 anger._] I will=20

_not_ say Monday!  DARBEY.  Any time you like. Oh--and I say--let me know w=
hen you preach,=20

and I'll get some of our fellows to give their patronage!  [_He goes out._ =
 THE DEAN.  [_Closing=20

the door after him with a bang._] Another moment--another moment--and I fea=
r I should have been=20

violently rude to him, a guest under my roof! [_He walks up to the fireplac=
e and stands looking into=20

the fire, as DARBEY. having forgotten his violin, returns to the room._] Oh=
, Blore, now understand=20

me, if that Mr. Darbey ever again presumes to present himself at the Deaner=
y I will not see him!=20

DARBEY.  [_With his violin in his hand, haughtily._] I've come back for my =
violin.  [_Goes out with=20

dignity._  THE DEAN.  [_Horrified._] Oh, Mr. Darbey! Hear an explanation, M=
r. Darbey!  [_He runs=20

out after DARBEY. GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM enter by the window._  GEORGIA=
NA.=20

Don't be down, Tris, my boy; cheer up, lad, he'll be fit yet, bar a chill! =
Aha! he knew me, he knew=20

me when I kissed his dear old nose!  SIR TRISTRAM.  He'd be a fool of a hor=
se if he hadn't felt=20

deuced flattered at that.  GEORGIANA.  He's no fool. He knows he's in the D=
eanery too. Did you=20

see him cast up his eyes and lay his ears back when I led him in?  SIR TRIS=
TRAM.  Oh, George,=20

George, it's such a pity about his tail!  GEORGIANA.  [_Cheerily._] Not it.=
 You watch his head to-

morrow--that'll come in first.  [_HATCHAM, a groom, looks in at the window.=
_  HATCHAM.  Are=20

you there, Sir?  SIR TRISTRAM.  What is it?  HATCHAM.  I jest run round to =
tell you that Dandy is=20

a feedin' as steady as a baby with a bottle.  GEORGIANA.  Don't you close y=
our eyes all night.=20

HATCHAM.  Not me, mum. And I've got hold of the constable 'ere, Mr. Topping=
--he's going to sit=20

up with me, for company's sake.  SIR TRISTRAM.  The constable?  HATCHAM.  Y=
es, Sir=20

Tristram. [_Coming forward mysteriously._] Why, bless you and the lady, sir=
--supposin' the fire at=20

the "Swan" warn't no accident!  GEORGIANA.  Eh?  HATCHAM.  Supposin' it wer=
e inciderism--

and supposin' our 'orse was the hobject.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Good gracious!  HA=
TCHAM.  That's=20

why I ain't goin' to watch single-handed.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Get back then--ge=
t back!  [_SIR=20

TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA pace up and down excitedly._  HATCHAM.  Right, Sir. =
There's only=20

one mortal fear I've got about our Dandy.  GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.  W=
hat's that?=20

HATCHAM.  He 'asn't found out about 'is tail yet, sir, and when he does it'=
ll fret him, as sure as my=20

name's Bob Hatcham.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Keep the stable pitch dark--he mayn't n=
otice it.=20

HATCHAM.  Not happened that one so little eligible should have been the one=
 to catch his heart.=20

But to do him justice, his heart being caught, he made no material resistan=
ce. He was entirely=20

steadfast and faithful to his own happiness, which was involved. But it did=
 not occur to him as it=20

might have done to a feebler mind, that he was in any way disabled from opp=
osing the=20

unambitious match of his sister in consequence of the similar character of =
his own. He held to his=20

formula with all the solidity of judgment which he had always shown. When h=
is mother pointed out=20

to him his inconsistency, he refused to see any inconsistency in it. "I nev=
er would, and never did,=20

say anything as to myself. I never meant to give up my own freedom. The gir=
ls--that's quite=20

different. It was your duty and my duty to do the best we could for the gir=
ls. I say now, a stop=20

should be put to Edith. Erskine's a gentleman, but that's all you can say. =
She will never be=20

anybody if she marries him; whereas, if she had not been a fool, what a far=
 better thing for her to=20

have had Millefleurs. I should put a stop to it without thinking twice; and=
 I can't imagine what my=20

father means not to do it." This was Rintoul's opinion upon his sister's af=
fairs.  "And supposing=20



Colonel Barrington had been of the same opinion in respect to Nora?" Lady L=
indores said.  "In=20

respect to Nora? I consider," said Rintoul, "that Nora is doing very well f=
or herself. We are not rich,=20

but the title always counts. A fellow can't shut his eyes. I know very well=
 that there are a good=20

many places where I--shouldn't have been turned away: though you don't thin=
k very much of me,=20

mother. Colonel Barrington is not a fool; he knows Nora couldn't have been =
expected to do better.=20

You see cleverness is not everything, mamma."  "I think you are very clever=
, Robin," his mother=20

said, with a smile and a sigh--a sigh of wonder that _her_ son (always such=
 a mystery to a=20

woman) should feel and talk and think so unlike herself; a smile that he sh=
ould be so much=20

justified in doing so, so successful in it. Both the smile and the sigh wer=
e full of wonder and of=20

pain. But she was comforted to think that Rintoul at least was capable of s=
omething heavenly--of=20

true love and disinterested affection. That was something, that was much, i=
n the dearth of fame.=20

Thus Rintoul's marriage was consented to, while Edith's was first peremptor=
ily denied, then=20

grudgingly entertained, and made the subject of delays and procrastinations=
 enough to have=20

wearied out any pair of lovers. But they had various consolations and helps=
 to support them, the=20

chief of which was that they lived so near each other, and were able to mee=
t often, and talk over in=20

infinite detail every step that was taken, and all the objections seen by o=
thers, and all the exquisite=20

reasons in favour of their love which were known to themselves. And Lady Li=
ndores was from the=20

first upon their side, though she respected her husband's unwillingness to =
bestow his daughter so=20

humbly. Carry was to her mother a standing admonition against any further w=
eakness on this=20

point. In every word and step by which the young widow showed her thankfuln=
ess for her=20

deliverance, she struck with horror the fine sense of fitness and reverence=
 which was in her=20

mother's mind. Lady Lindores had not been false in the sentiments of pity a=
nd remorseful regret=20

with which she had heard of the death of Torrance. There are some souls whi=
ch are so finely=20

poised that they cannot but answer to every natural claim, even when agains=
t themselves. Had=20

she been Torrance's wife, all the privileges of freedom would not have eman=
cipated her from that=20

compassion for the man struck down in the midst of his life, which took alm=
ost the shape of=20

tenderness and sorrow. And when Carry exulted, it gave her mother a pang wi=
th which her whole=20

being shivered. God forbid that she should ever be instrumental in placing =
another creature in=20

such a position as Carry's! She stood very gently but very firmly against h=
er husband on Edith's=20

behalf. She would not consent to interfere with the love and choice of her =
child.  Carry adopted her=20

sister's cause with a still warmer devotion. She promised her support, her =
help in every possible=20

manner, would have sanctioned an instant rebellious marriage, and settled h=
alf of her own large=20

jointure upon Edith to justify the step, if she could have had her own way,=
 and would scarcely=20

listen to the suggestions of prudence. This nervous partisanship was not of=
 any great advantage to=20

the lovers, but still it gave them the consolation of sympathy. And by-and-=
by the whole county=20

became aware of the struggle, and took sides with the warmest feeling. Old =
Sir James=20

Montgomery, as everybody knows, had entertained other views; but when he he=
ard of Nora's=20

promotion, and of the position of affairs in general, his kind old heart wa=
s greatly moved. He went=20

off instantly to talk over the matter with Miss Barbara Erskine at Dunearn,=
 from whose house Nora=20

had just departed. "To think that this should have been going on all the ti=
me, and you and me=20

never the wiser," the old General said,--"the little cutty! But no doubt th=
ey were left in great=20

tribulation as to what my lord the Earl's majesty would say."  "Young perso=
ns have a great notion=20



of themselves nowadays," said Miss Barbara; "they will not hear of advice f=
rom the like of you or=20

me. Yet I think Nora might have said a word to an old friend. I am getting =
blind and doited. I never=20

suspected anything. What my heart was set on was to get her for my nephew J=
ohn."  "Just that,"=20

said Sir James, nodding his head; "that was my own idea. But you see John, =
he has chosen for=20

himself--and a bonnie creature too, if she is as good as she is bonny."  "I=
 am not very fond of the=20

family. What are they but strangers? My heart is most warm to them that I k=
now," said Miss=20

Barbara. But this was a very mild statement, and uttered with little veheme=
nce, for Miss Barbara=20

was not insensible to the pleasure of having an earl's daughter in the fami=
ly. "There is no doubt=20

about the beauty," she added, "and there's a great deal of good in her, fro=
m all I hear."  "With=20

those eyes ye may be sure there's no harm," said Sir James, growing enthusi=
astic. "And I like the=20

lad that had the sense to see what was in my little Nora. She'll make a bon=
ny countess, and I wish=20

she was here that I might give her a kiss and tell her so. But this Lady Ed=
ith is a bonny creature=20

too; and as for Lord Lindores himself, he's no stranger, you know--he's jus=
t little Robby Lindores=20

that both you and me mind. The one that has raised a prejudice, I make no d=
oubt, is just that=20

foreign wife of his----"  "She is not foreign that ever I heard----"  "Well=
, well--maybe not according=20

to the letter; but she has foreign ways, and without doubt it is her influe=
nce that has kept the family=20

from settling down as we had a right to expect. My Lady Rintoul will set th=
at right again. Bless me,=20

who would have thought that little Nora----But we must let by-gones be by-g=
ones, Miss Barbara.=20

We must just stand up for the young couple, and defeat the machinations of =
the foreign wife."  Sir=20

James laughed at this fine sentence of his; but yet he meant it. And even M=
iss Barbara agreed=20

that this stranger woman was no doubt at the bottom of the mischief. When S=
ir James departed,=20

the old lady felt herself nerved to a great exertion. By this time it was w=
inter, and she went out but=20

seldom, the pony-chaise being a cold conveyance. But that night she electri=
fied her household by=20

ordering the "carriage"--the old carriage, never produced but on occasions =
of great solemnity--for=20

the next day. "Where will ye be going?" Janet asked, open-mouthed, after sh=
e had got over the=20

shock of the announcement. But her mistress did not condescend to give her =
any answer. It was=20

through Agnes, at a later hour, that information descended upon the househo=
ld. "Sae far as I can=20

make out, she is just going to Lindores to settle a' about thae two marriag=
es," Agnes said in great=20

excitement. "What two marriages? Ye think of nothing but marriages," said J=
anet. But=20

nevertheless that excellent person was as much excited as any one when the =
huge vehicle drew=20

up at the door next morning, and stood out in the rain to hear the orders w=
hich were given to the=20

coachman. Agnes, seated within in attendance on her mistress, gave her a li=
ttle nod with her=20

eyelids, as much as to say, Who's in the right now? "To Lindores." "Bless m=
e!" said Janet, "single=20

women are aye so keen on that subject. They would ken better if they had ev=
er had a man o' their=20

ain."  And indeed Miss Barbara's magnificent intention was to make a propos=
al to Lord Lindores,=20

which must, she could not doubt, make everything smooth. Lord Lindores was =
a gentleman, and=20

took pains not to show the old lady, to whom the credit of the house of Dal=
rulzian was so dear, that=20

he did not think the Erskines good enough to mate with his family: which wa=
s also a laudable=20

exercise of discretion; for Miss Barbara was very strong in dates, and knew=
 when the earldom of=20

Lindores was founded, and who was the first of the family, as well as the e=
xact period when the=20

Erskines were settled at Dalrulzian. Lord Lindores forbore, partly out of g=
ood feeling, partly from=20

alarm, and partly because Miss Barbara's offer was not one to be refused. I=
f it should so happen=20



that he might be compelled to give in, then the settlement upon Edith of Mi=
ss Barbara's fortune=20

would make a very distinct difference in the case. He did not intend to giv=
e in, but still----The=20

proposal was received with great politeness at least. "There are many thing=
s to be taken into=20

consideration," he said. "I had other plans----You will excuse me if I cann=
ot give up my intentions=20

in a moment, because two young people have chosen to fall in love with each=
 other----" "It is what=20

we all have to do, my lord," said Miss Barbara, who was old-fashioned, and =
gave every man his=20

title. "It is the only thing, in my experience, that it is useless to fight=
 against." Then Lord Lindores=20

made her a fine bow, and declared that this was a most appropriate sentimen=
t from a lady's lips;=20

but a man must be excused if he took a graver view. There was a sharp accen=
t in his voice which=20

not all his politeness could quite disguise. "For my part," Miss Barbara sa=
id, "I have just had to=20

swallow my own disappointment, and think nothing of it; for what I had set =
my heart upon was to=20

wed my nephew John to Nora Barrington, that now it appears, in the arrangem=
ents of Providence,=20

is to be your lordship's daughter-in-law, my Lady Rintoul." Lord Lindores j=
umped up at this as if a=20

knife had been put into him. He could scarcely trust himself to speak. "I c=
an't allow it to be an=20

arrangement of Providence," he cried bitterly, but recovered himself, and f=
orced a smile upon his=20

angry countenance, and assured Miss Barbara that her proposal was most gene=
rous. He gave her=20

his arm to the drawing-room, in which Lady Lindores and Edith were sitting,=
 and withdrew, with his=20

face drawn into a certain wolfish expression which his wife was aware meant=
 mischief, but without=20

betraying himself in speech. When he got back to his library, he launched a=
 private anathema at=20

the "old witch" who had taken it upon herself to interfere. But nevertheles=
s, in Lord Lindores' mind=20

there arose the conviction that though he never would consent, yet if he di=
d----why, that Miss=20

Barbara and her proposal were worth making a note of: and he did so accordi=
ngly. Miss Barbara,=20

on her part, left the Castle half affronted, half mollified. She was angry =
that her proposal did not=20

settle everything in a moment; but she was touched by the sweetness of Edit=
h, and a little moved=20

out of her prejudices in respect to Lady Lindores. "She has no foreign acce=
nt," she said suddenly,=20

in the midst of the drive, to the astonishment of Agnes--"no more than any =
of us. And she has=20

none of that sneering way,--my lord yonder, he just cannot contain himself =
for spite and illwill--but I=20

cannot see it in her. No doubt she's one of them that is everybody's body, =
and puts on a fine=20

show--but nothing from the heart."  Some time after this another incident, =
which had no small=20

bearing upon the story of one of these young pairs, occurred at Dalrulzian.=
 Rintoul had never=20

concealed his opposition, but neither had it ever become a subject of perso=
nal conflict between=20

John Erskine and himself. He had gone away after his own explanation, for t=
ime did not stand still=20

while these events were going on, and even a Guardsman has periods of duty.=
 Shortly after he=20

returned to Lindores, some question about the boundaries of the estates mad=
e it expedient that=20

there should be formal communications between the two houses. Rintoul under=
took to be the=20

messenger. He had been with his regiment for the last two months, and he ha=
d not inquired into=20

local events. He was, therefore, not in the least prepared for the sight th=
at encountered him when=20

he knocked at John Erskine's door. It was opened to him by Rolls, in all th=
e glory of shining=20

"blacks" and snowy neckcloth, as composed, as authoritative, as fully in co=
mmand of himself and=20

everything about him, as he had ever been. Rintoul, though he was a lord an=
d a soldier and a fine=20

fellow, gave a jump backwards, which scattered the gravel on the path. "Goo=
d lord, Rolls!" he=20

cried. It was not an agreeable surprise. He had done his best to forget Rol=
ls, and he had=20



succeeded. To have so many painful associations thus recalled was unpleasan=
t; and the sight of=20

him, so suddenly, without warning, an undeniable shock.  "Ay, my lord, it's=
 just Rolls," said the=20

butler, barring, as it were, his entrance. Rolls regarded the young man wit=
h a stern air; and even=20

when Rintoul, recovering himself, began to express pleasure at his return, =
and great interest in=20

hearing how it was, the face of Rolls remained unmoved. He changed his mind=
, however, about=20

barring the entrance, and slowly showed Rintoul into the vacant dining-room=
, which he entered=20

after him, shutting the door.  "I'll easy tell your lordship how I got out,=
" he said; "but there's mair=20

pressing matter in hand. They tell me, my lord, that ye will not yield to h=
ave my maister, John=20

Erskine of Dalrulzian, for Lady Edith's man. I would like to hear if that's=
 true."  "It's a curious sort of=20

question to ask," said Rintoul. "I might ask what's that to you, Rolls?"  "=
Ay, so ye might--it would be=20

just like you, my lord; but I do not think it would be politic in all the c=
ircumstances. What for are you=20

opposing it? Ye're to marry Miss Nora, and get your ain will and pleasure. =
I wish her much joy,=20

poor thing, and strength of mind to bear a' that's before her. What is your=
 lordship's objection to=20

my maister, if I may make so bold as to ask?"  "You are not very compliment=
ary," said Rintoul,=20

growing red.  "No, I'm no' complimentary, my lord; it's no' my line. Will y=
ou tell me what's set you=20

against this marriage? for that is what I would like to ken."  Rintoul trie=
d to laugh, though it would=20

have pleased him better to knock his monitor down. "You must see, Rolls, th=
at a thing like this is=20

my own concern," he said.  "It's my concern as well," said Rolls. "There's =
mair between you and=20

me, my lord, than I'm wanting to tell; but if I was in your lordship's plac=
e, I would not rin counter to=20

them that has proved themselves your best friend----"  "Rolls! what are you=
 doing here?" cried=20

John Erskine, with amazement, suddenly opening the door.  The countenance o=
f Rolls was quite=20

impassive. "I was giving my Lord Rintoul an account of my marvellous delive=
rance out o' my=20

prison, sir," he said, "and how it was thought I had suffered enough in my =
long wait for the trial.=20

And that was true. Much have I suffered, and many a thought has gone throug=
h my head. I'm real=20

ripened in my judgment, and awfu' well acquaint with points o' law. But I h=
ope I may never have=20

anything more ado with such subjects--if it be not upon very urgent occasio=
n," Rolls said. And he=20

withdrew with a solemn bow to Rintoul, in his usual methodical and importan=
t way.  Rintoul had=20

come to see John Erskine upon a matter of business; but they had never ceas=
ed to be friends--as=20

good friends, that is, as they ever had been. And the similarity of their s=
ituation no doubt=20

awakened new sympathies in their minds. At least, whatever was the cause, t=
his meeting did=20

much to draw them together. It was now that Rintoul showed to John the real=
 good feeling that=20

was in him. "I have not been on your side, I confess," he said. "I have tho=
ught Edith might do=20

better. I don't hide it from you. But you need not fear that I will stand i=
n your way. I'm in the same=20

box myself. My lord likes my affair just as little as he likes yours. But o=
f course if she sticks fast to=20

you, as she'll certainly do, what can he make of it? Everything must come r=
ight in the end."=20

CHAPTER XLVIII.   Thus between threats and promises, and patience and obsti=
nacy, it came=20

gradually to pass that Lord Lindores had to yield. He made that winter a ve=
ry unhappy one to his=20

family--and it was not more agreeable to himself; for it was not long befor=
e he arrived at the=20

conviction that he could make nothing by his opposition. In Rintoul's case,=
 this had been evident to=20

him from the very first, but he had tried for some time to delude himself w=
ith the idea that Edith=20

would and must yield to his will. The successive stages of wrath, bewildere=
d surprise, impatient=20

certainty, and then of a still more disagreeable conviction that whatever h=
e might say or do he=20



would not overcome this girl, went over him one after another, irritating a=
nd humiliating his=20

arbitrary spirit. A father may consent to the fact that beyond a certain po=
int he cannot coerce his=20

full-grown son; but to be opposed and vanquished by a chit of a girl, is ha=
rd upon him. To see a=20

soft, small creature, whom he could almost blow away, whom he could crush i=
n his hand like a=20

butterfly, standing up in all the force of a distinct and independent being=
 before him, and asserting=20

her own will and judgment against his,--this was almost more than he could =
bear. He came,=20

however, gradually to a perception of what can and what cannot be done in t=
he way of moral=20

compulsion. It had succeeded with Carry, and he had not been able at first =
to imagine that it would=20

not succeed equally with Edith; but gradually his mind was undeceived. He h=
ad in reality given up=20

the contest long before he would confess to himself, and still longer befor=
e he would allow to the=20

world that it was so. If he could do nothing else, he would at least keep h=
is household in suspense,=20

and make the cup as bitter as possible to them before they should be allowe=
d to touch the sweet.=20

Lord Lindores, with all these vexations upon his head, experienced for a mo=
ment an absolute=20

pause in his individual career and prospects. He was assailed with that dis=
gust which is one of the=20

curses of age and experience. _Cui bono?_ it is the oldest of reflections a=
nd the most persistent.=20

To what good is all the work and labour under the sun? What did it matter t=
o him to gain an empty=20

distinction, if his children were to melt away on all sides of him, and mer=
ge into the lower classes--

which was how, in a moment of natural exasperation, he represented the matt=
er to himself. But=20

afterwards there was a reaction, as was equally natural. He reflected that =
he was only fifty-five,=20

and that what a man enjoys himself is more to him than anything his grandch=
ildren are likely to=20

enjoy. If he was sure of never having any grandchildren, it would still be =
worth his while to be Lord=20

Dunearn in the peerage of Great Britain, and take his seat and wear his rob=
es in Westminster. Till=20

these glories were attained, what was he?--a mere Scots lord, good for noth=
ing. A man's children=20

are not the only interests he has in life; especially when they are married=
 he can shake them off--

he can re-enter the world without encumbrance. And Lord Lindores remembered=
 that life and the=20

pleasures of his rank could be enjoyed soberly with his wife at a moderate =
expense if the young=20

people were all off his hand. He had been but an uncomfortable husband of l=
ate years, and yet he=20

loved his wife as she loved him, in frequent disagreements, in occasional a=
ngers and impatiences,=20

and much disappointment. What would become of the world if love did not man=
age to hold its=20

footing through all these? The boys and girls of the high-flown kind are of=
 opinion that love is too=20

feeble to bear the destruction of the ideal. But that is all these young pe=
rsons know. Love has the=20

most robust vitality in the world--it outlives everything. Lord Lindores wa=
s often irritated beyond=20

description by his wife, who would not understand his ways, and was continu=
ally diverging into=20

ridiculous by-paths of her own. And she was more disappointed in him--more =
hurt and mortified by=20

his shortcomings than words can say. But yet they loved each other. So much=
, that it gradually=20

began to dawn upon him with a sense of solace, that when the House of Lords=
 called him, as he=20

hoped, he and she together, without any young people to trouble them, would=
 yet take their=20

pleasure together, and enjoy it and their elevated position, and be able to=
 afford it, which was the=20

best of all. She, at fifty, was still a handsome woman; and he had a presen=
ce which many younger=20

men might have envied. It is doubtful whether the imagination of Lady Lindo=
res would have been=20

equally delighted with this dream: but it would have pleased her to know th=
at he looked forward to=20

it, which is next best. Animated by this thought, Lord Lindores gathered hi=
mself together and=20



returned to public business with all his heart and soul. He took possession=
 unhesitatingly, as has=20

been said, of the Tinto power and influence. Torrance had opposed him in po=
litics, and thus=20

neutralised the advantage of a family union against which nothing in the co=
unty could stand. But=20

now, with a sigh of satisfaction, Lord Lindores drew into his hand the infl=
uence of Tinto too.  This=20

went on for some time with little warning of the insecurity of tenure by wh=
ich he held his power.=20

Beaufort had at last withdrawn from Dalrulzian, though it was not absolutel=
y certain that he had left=20

the neighbourhood. The minds of the family were, however, eased by his aban=
donment of the=20

ground so far. And Lady Car lived very quietly, seldom making her appearanc=
e out of her own=20

grounds, and never once appearing at Lindores. She would not, indeed, on an=
y argument, return=20

to her old home. Though she was urged by her mother and sister with many so=
ft entreaties, Carry=20

would never yield on this point. Her countenance seemed to blanch when it w=
as suggested,=20

though, she would give no reason but a tremulous oft-repeated "No, no; oh, =
no, no." When she=20

drove out, she would sometimes call at the door to fetch them, sometimes to=
 convey them home,=20

but they could not induce her to cross the familiar threshold. She was unea=
sy even in the very=20

neighbourhood of the house, and breathed more freely when it was out of sig=
ht. This extraordinary=20

objection to her father's house kept her almost a prisoner in her own; for =
where could a widow of=20

but a few months go, except to her parents? No other visiting was possible.=
 She was not even,=20

they thought, very desirous of Edith's society, but liked to be alone, inte=
resting herself in the=20

alterations of furniture and new arrangements she was making; a great many =
of the faded=20

grandeurs upon which Pat Torrance prided himself had already been put away.=
 For the moment=20

this was the only sign of feeling herself her own mistress which Lady Car d=
isplayed.  Other=20

revolutions, however, were at hand. There came a moment when it happened th=
at one of the=20

orders Lord Lindores had given was disobeyed, and when an explanation was a=
sked, the answer=20

given was that Lady Car herself had given other orders. This irritated her =
father greatly, and he=20

made up his mind that the uncertainty in which things were could exist no l=
onger--that he must=20

have an explanation with his daughter. He set out for this purpose with a l=
ittle impatient=20

determination to bring Carry to her senses. He had been tolerating much whi=
ch it was ridiculous to=20

go on tolerating. All the family had humoured her, he felt, as if she had b=
een an inconsolable=20

widow, broken-hearted and incapable of any exertion. At this, he could not =
but smile within himself=20

as he thought of it. It was a pity, perhaps, for Torrance, poor fellow, but=
 it could not be doubted=20

that it was a most fortunate accident for Car. To be his wife, perhaps, had=
 its disagreeables, but=20

there could be no more desirable position than that of his widow; and to in=
dulge Carry's whims as=20

they had all been doing, and keep every annoyance out of her way as if she =
had been heart-

broken, was too absurd. He decided that it would be well to have a clear un=
derstanding once for=20

all. She was left by the will in uncontrolled authority, and it was full ti=
me to show her that this did=20

not, of course, interfere with the authority of her father, who was her nat=
ural guide and protector.=20

"Your husband, of course, took this into consideration," he intended to say=
. But it cannot be denied=20

that he had to brace himself up for the interview with a clear sense that i=
t might be a painful one;=20

and that as he went along Lord Lindores did, what was a great tribute to th=
e altered position of=20

Carry--arranged the subjects of their interview in his mind, and settled wi=
th himself what he was to=20

say.  A great deal can happen in a neighbourhood even when it is full of go=
ssiping society, without=20

reaching the ears of the persons most intimately concerned, and Lord Lindor=
es had been kept in=20



ignorance of much which had alarmed and disquieted his wife. She was aware,=
 but he was not,=20

that Beaufort still lingered in the vicinity, not living indeed in one plac=
e, but making frequent=20

expeditions from Edinburgh, or from the further north, sometimes to the lit=
tle hotel at Dunearn,=20

sometimes to other little towns in the neighbourhood, from which he could c=
ome for the day, or=20

even for a few hours, to see Carry in her solitude. Lady Lindores had disco=
vered this with all the=20

pain of anxiety and wounded disapproval,--wounded that Carry could think it=
 right to do what=20

seemed to herself so little suited to the dignity and delicacy of her posit=
ion: and though scarcely a=20

word had been said between them on the subject, it had brought pain and emb=
arrassment into=20

their intercourse; for Carry was irritated and wounded beyond measure by th=
e consciousness of=20

her mother's disapproval. She, of whom Torrance had declared in his brutal =
way that she was too=20

proud to go wrong, was incapable indeed even of conceiving the possibility =
that "going wrong"=20

should be in any one's thought of her. In her own mind, the fervour with wh=
ich she had turned=20

back to the love of her life, the eagerness with which, at the very earlies=
t moment, she had sought=20

his pardon, were the only compensations she could give him for the falsehoo=
d into which she had=20

been forced and the sufferings that had been inflicted upon him. How could =
she pretend to build a=20

wall of false delicacy around herself and keep him at a distance, while her=
 heart was solely bent=20

upon making up to him for what he had suffered, and conscious of no sentime=
nt but an=20

overwhelming desire for his presence and society? That she should be oblige=
d to enjoy this=20

society almost by stealth, and that her mother, even her mother, should obj=
ect and remonstrate,=20

gave Carry the keen and sharp offence with which a delicate mind always res=
ents a false=20

interpretation of its honest meaning. It seemed to her that her first duty =
now was to be true--always=20

true. She had been false with horrible consequences: to conceal now the eag=
er bound of her heart=20

towards her true lover would be a lie--especially to him who had suffered, =
as she also had=20

suffered, from the lies of her life. But Lord Lindores, when he made up his=
 mind that Carry must be=20

brought to her senses, was in no way aware how difficult the position was, =
and how far those=20

senses had gone astray.  He had taken a considerable round to think over th=
e subject, so that it=20

was getting towards evening when he rode up the long avenue to Tinto,--so l=
ate that the workmen=20

whom Carry employed in the changes she was making were leaving their work, =
when Lord=20

Lindores went into the house and made his way towards Carry's sitting-room.=
 He sent away the=20

butler, who, with an air of alarm and surprise, started out of the partial =
twilight to conduct him to his=20

daughter. It was, he felt, something of a reproach to him that the man look=
ed so much startled, as=20

if his mistress's father could be an unwelcome visitor. The room was not li=
ghted, save by the glow=20

of a large fire, when Lord Lindores opened the door, after a knock to which=
 no answer was=20

returned. There was a sound of several voices, and he was surprised to see =
the tall figure of a=20

man standing against the firelight. Who was the man who was visiting Carry?=
 It was not Rintoul,=20

nor any one else he knew in the neighbourhood. Nobody about was so tall, so=
 slight, though there=20

was something in the outline of the figure that was familiar to him. But th=
ere was an agitated=20

conversation going on, which made the speakers scarcely distinguishable in =
the twilight,=20

unconscious of the knock of the new-comer or his entrance. To his surprise =
it was his wife's voice=20

which he heard first, saying tremulously: "Mr Beaufort, I can do nothing bu=
t return to what I said=20

before. _Qui s'excuse s'accuse._ You may have the very best of reasons, but=
 it is an injury to=20

Carry that you should stay here."  "An injury to me! How can it be an injur=
y to me? It is my only=20



consolation, it is the only help I have. I have told you from the first, ma=
mma. Edward has been=20

wronged, only not so cruelly wronged as I was myself; oh, nobody could be t=
hat! And now that we=20

can make it up to each other--and learn to forget it,--you would chase him =
away a second time--for=20


_
'isself on the 'ill to-morrow? You and me and the lady, sir--it 'ud be diff=
erent with us, but how's our=20

Dandy to hide his bereavement?  [_HATCHAM goes out of the window with SIR T=
RISTRAM as=20

THE DEAN enters, followed by BLORE, who carries a lighted lantern._  THE DE=
AN.  [_Looking=20

reproachfully at GEORGIANA._] You have returned, Georgiana?  GEORGIANA.  Ye=
s, thank ye.=20

THE DEAN.  And that animal?  GEORGIANA.  In our stables, safe and snug.  TH=
E DEAN.  [_With=20

a groan._] Oh!  GEORGIANA.  You can sleep to-night with the happy conscious=
ness of having=20

sheltered the outcast.  THE DEAN.  We're locking up now. The poor children,=
 exhausted with the=20

alarm, beg me to say good-night for them. The fire is quite extinguished.  =
BLORE.  Yes, sir; but I=20

hear they've just sent into Durnstone hasking for the nothing about us--may=
 say!"  Carry was=20

standing by the mantelpiece, her tall figure in its black clinging dress sc=
arcely distinguishable at=20

first, but the animation with which she spoke, and the natural eloquence of=
 her gestures, brought it=20

out against the white marble. Then there came Beaufort's deeper voice: "You=
 know, Lady=20

Lindores, I am ready to do whatever is best for her. If I can comfort her a=
fter all that has happened=20

to her, how can I go away? I wish to do only what is best for her."  "I beg=
 to remark," said Lord=20

Lindores, coming forward, "that I knocked before coming in. This, I suppose=
, is why your servant=20

looked alarmed when he admitted me. Is this gentleman, may I ask, living he=
re?"  Carry drew back=20

at the sound of his voice as if she had received a blow. She clung to the e=
dge of=20


_
the wicked Ball at the Hathanaeum, it will!  [_Drawing the window curtains.=

GEORGIANA.  The old nursery. Toys to play with if you wake early.  THE DEAN=

the curtain._  GEORGIANA.  Put Sir Tristram to bed carefully in the nursery=
, Blore.  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  [_Grasping THE DEAN'S hand._] Good-night, old boy. I'm too done =
for a hand of=20

Piquet to-night.  THE DEAN.  I never play cards.  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Slapping=
 him on the back._]=20

I'll teach you during my stay at the Deanery.  THE DEAN.  [_Helplessly to h=
imself._] Then he's=20

staying with me!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Good-night, George.  GEORGIANA.  Good-nigh=
t, partner.=20

Heaven bless the little innocent in his cot.  [_SIR TRISTRAM goes out with =
BLORE._=20

GEORGIANA.  [_Calling after him._] Tris! You may take your pipe up with you=
. We smoke all over=20

the Deanery.  THE DEAN.  [_To himself._] I never smoke! Does _she?_  GEORGI=
ANA.  [_Closes=20

the door, humming a tune merrily._] Tra la, tra la! Now, Mr. Tidd, we'll to=
ddle. Tra la! tra la! [_She=20

stops, looking at THE DEAN, who is muttering to himself._] Gus, I don't lik=
e your looks, I shall let=20

the Vet see you in the morning. What's wrong with you?  [_THE DEAN shakes h=
is head=20

mournfully, and sinks on the settee._  GEORGIANA.  Money?  THE DEAN.  There=
 _are_ bills,=20

which, at a more convenient time, it will be my grateful duty to discharge.=
  GEORGIANA.  And=20

you're short?  THE DEAN.  Short?  GEORGIANA.  Stumped--out of coin--run low=
. What'll square=20

the bills?  THE DEAN.  Very little would settle the bills--but--but----  GE=
ORGIANA.  I know--the=20

Spire. Why, Gus, you haven't got that thousand.  THE DEAN.  There is a very=
 large number of=20

estimable worthy men who do not possess a thousand pounds. With that number=
 I have the=20

mournful pleasure of enrolling myself.  GEORGIANA.  When's the settling day=
?  THE DEAN.  Eh?=20

GEORGIANA.  When will you have to fork out?  THE DEAN.  Unless the restorat=
ion is immediately=20

commenced the spire will certainly crumble.  GEORGIANA.  Then it's a match =
between you and=20

the spire which parts first. Gus, will you let your little sister lend you =
a hand?  THE DEAN.  My dear=20

Georgiana, impossible!  GEORGIANA.  No, no--not out of my own pocket. Come =
here. [_She=20

takes his arm and whispers in his ear._] Can you squeeze a pair of ponies? =
 THE DEAN.  Can I=20

what?  GEORGIANA.  Can you raise fifty pounds?  THE DEAN.  Certainly. More =
than fifty pounds.=20

GEORGIANA.  No--no, don't be rash! That's the worst of you beginners. Only =
fifty by to-morrow=20

morning.  THE DEAN.  Most assuredly.  GEORGIANA.  Very well then--clap it o=
n to Dandy Dick!=20

THE DEAN.  [_With horror._] What!  GEORGIANA.  He's a certainty--if those t=
wo buckets of water=20

haven't put him off it! He's a moral--if he doesn't think of his tail comin=
g down the hill. There's=20

nothing like him at the weight. Keep it dark, Gus--don't breathe a word to =
any of your Canons or=20

Archdeacons, or they'll rush at it and shorten the price for us. Go in, Gus=
, my boy--take your poor=20

widowed sister's tip and sleep as peacefully as a blessed baby!  [_She pres=
ses him warmly to her=20

and kisses him._  THE DEAN.  [_Extricating himself._] Oh! Mrs. Tidman! Go t=
o your room!=20

GEORGIANA.  Augustin!  THE DEAN.  In the morning I will endeavor to frame s=
ome verbal=20



expression of the horror with which I regard your proposal. For the present=
, you are my parents'=20

child and I trust your bed is well aired.  GEORGIANA.  Oh, very well, Augus=
tin. I've done all I can=20

for the Spire. _Bon soir,_ old boy!  THE DEAN.  Good-night.  GEORGIANA.  If=
 you're wiser in the=20

morning just send Blore on to the course and he'll put the money on for you=
.  THE DEAN.  Blore!=20

My poor devoted old servant would be lost on a race-course.  GEORGIANA.  Wo=
uld he! He was=20

quite at home in Tattersall's Ring when I was at St. Marvells last summer. =
 THE DEAN.  Blore!=20

GEORGIANA.  Blore. I recognized the veteran sportsman the moment I came int=
o the Deanery.=20

THE DEAN.  What was my butler doing at St. Marvells Races?  _BLORE enters w=
ith his lantern._=20

GEORGIANA.  Investing the savings of your cook and housemaid, of course. Yo=
u don't think your=20

servants are as narrow as you are!  THE DEAN.  Oh!  BLORE.  I beg your pard=
on, sir, shall I go=20

the rounds, sir?  [_THE DEAN gives Blore a fierce look, but BLORE beams swe=
etly._=20

GEORGIANA.  Blore!  BLORE.  Mum?  GEORGIANA.  Breakfast at nine, sharp. And=
 pack a=20

hamper with a cold chicken, some French rolls, and two bottles of Heidsieck=
--label it "George=20

Tidd," and send it on to the Hill. I'll stand the racket. Goodnight.  [_She=
 goes out. THE DEAN sinks=20

into a chair and clasps his forehead._  BLORE.  A dear, 'igh-sperited lady.=
 [_Leaning over THE=20

DEAN._] Aren't you well, sir?  THE DEAN.  Serpent!  BLORE.  Meanin' _me,_ s=
ir?  THE DEAN=20

Lock up; I'll speak to you in the morning. Lock up.  [_BLORE goes into the =
Library, turns out the=20

lamp there, and disappears._  What dreadful wave threatens to engulf the De=
anery? What has=20

come to us in a few fatal hours? A horse of sporting tendencies contaminati=
ng my stables, his=20

equally vicious owner nestling in the nursery, and my own widowed sister, i=
n all probability,=20

smoking a cigarette at her bedroom window with her feet on the window-ledge=
! [_Listening._]=20

What's that? [_He peers through the window curtains._] I thought I heard fo=
otsteps in the garden. I=20

can see nothing--only the old spire standing out against the threatening sk=
y. [_Leaving the window=20

shudderingly._] The Spire! My principal creditor! My principal creditor, th=
e most conspicuous object=20

in the city!  _BLORE re-enters with his lantern, carrying some bank-notes i=
n his hand._  BLORE.=20

[_Laying the notes on the table._] I found these, sir, on your dressing-tab=
le--they're bank-notes,=20

sir.  THE DEAN.  [_Taking the notes._] Thank you. I placed them there to be=
 sent to the Bank to-

morrow. [_Counting the notes._] Ten--ten--twenty--five--five, fifty. Fifty =
pounds! The very sum=20

Georgiana urged me to--oh! [_To BLORE, waving him away._] Leave me--go to b=
ed--go to bed--

go to bed! [_BLORE is going._] Blore!  BLORE.  Sir?  THE DEAN.  What made y=
ou tempt me with=20

these at such a moment?  BLORE.  Temp' you, sir! The window was hopen, and =
I feared they=20

might blow away.  THE DEAN.  [_Catching him by the coat collar._] Man, what=
 were you doing at=20

St. Marvells Races last summer?  BLORE.  [_With a cry, falling on his knees=
._] Oh, sir! Oh, sir! I=20

knew that 'igh-sperited lady would bring grief and sorrow to the peaceful, =
'appy Deanery! Oh, sir, I=20

_'ave_ done a little on my hown account from time to time on the 'ill, hals=
o hon commission for the=20

kitchen!  THE DEAN.  I knew it--I knew it!  BLORE.  Oh, sir, you are a old =
gentleman--turn a=20

charitable 'art to the Races! It's a wicious institution what spends more r=
eady money in St.=20

Marvells than us good people do in a year.  THE DEAN.  Get up, Blore--get u=
p. Oh, Edward Blore,=20

Edward Blore, what weak creatures we are!  BLORE.  We are, sir--we are--'sp=
ecially when we've=20

got a tip, sir. Think of the temptation of a tip, sir.  THE DEAN.  I do, Bl=
ore--I do.  BLORE.  I confess=20

heverything, sir. Bonny Betsy's bound for to win the 'andicap.  THE DEAN.  =
No, no--she isn't.=20

BLORE.  She is, sir.  THE DEAN.  I know better; she can never get down the =
hill with those legs of=20



hers.  BLORE.  She can, sir--what's to beat her?  THE DEAN.  The horse in m=
y stable--Dandy=20

Dick!  BLORE.  Dandy Dick! That old bit of ma'ogany, sir. They're layin' te=
n to one against him.=20

THE DEAN.  [_With hysterical eagerness._] Are they? I'll take it! I'll take=
 it!  BLORE.  Lord love=20

you, sir--fur how much?  THE DEAN.  Fifty! There's the money. [_Impulsively=
 he crams the notes=20

into BLORE'S hand and then recoils in horror._] Oh!  [_Sinks into a chair w=
ith a groan._  BLORE.=20

[_In a whisper._] Lor', who'd 'ave thought the Dean was such a ardent sport=
sman at 'art? He=20

dursn't give me my notice after this. [_To THE DEAN._] Of course it's under=
stood, sir, that we=20

keep our little weaknesses dark. Houtwardly, sir, we remain respectable, an=
d, I 'ope, respected.=20

[_Putting the notes into his pocket._] I wish you good-night, sir. [_He wal=
ks to the door. THE DEAN=20

makes an effort to recall him but fails._] And that old man 'as been my pat=
tern and example for=20

years and years! Oh, Edward Blore, your hidol is shattered! [_Turning to TH=
E DEAN._] Good-

night, sir. May your dreams be calm and 'appy, and may you have a good run =
for your money!=20

[_BLORE goes out--THE DEAN gradually recovers his self-possession._  THE DE=
AN.  I--I am=20

upset to-night, Blore. Of course you leave this day month. I--I [_looking r=
ound._] Blore! He's gone!=20

If I don't call him back the Spire may be richer to-morrow by five hundred =
pounds. I won't dwell on=20

it. I'll read--I'll read. [_Snatches a book at haphazard from the bookshelf=
. There is the sound of=20

falling rain and distant thunder._] Rain, thunder. How it assimilates with =
the tempest of my mind! I'll=20

read. Bless me! This is very strange. [_Reading._] "The Horse and its Ailme=
nts, by John Cox, M.=20

R. C. V. S." It was with the aid of this volume that I used to doctor my ol=
d mare at Oxford. A leaf=20

turned down. [_Reading._] "Simple remedies for chills--the Bolus." The help=
less beast in my stable=20

is suffering from a chill. Good gracious! If I allow Blore to risk my fifty=
 pounds on Dandy Dick,=20

surely it would be advisable to administer this Bolus to the poor animal wi=
thout delay. [_Referring=20

to the book hastily._] I have these drugs in my chest. There's not a moment=
 to be lost! [_Going to=20

the bell and ringing._] I shall want help. I'll fetch my medicine chest.  [=
_He lays the book upon the=20

table and goes into the Library._  _BLORE enters._  BLORE.  [_Looking round=
._] Where is he?=20

The bell rang. The Dean's puzzling me with his uncommon behavior, that he i=
s.  [_THE DEAN=20

comes from the Library, carrying a large medicine chest. On encountering BL=
ORE he starts and=20

turns away his head, the picture of guilt._  THE DEAN.  Blore, I feel it wo=
uld be a humane act to=20

administer to the poor ignorant animal in my stable a simple Bolus as a pre=
caution against chill. I=20

rely upon your aid and discretion in ministering to any guest in the Deaner=
y.  BLORE.  [_In a=20

whisper._] I see, sir--you ain't going to lose half a chance for to-morrow,=
 sir--you're a knowin' one,=20

sir, as the sayin' goes!  THE DEAN.  [_Shrinking from BLORE with a groan._]=
 Oh! [_He places the=20

medicine chest on the table and takes up the book. Handing the book to BLOR=
E with his finger on=20

a page._] Fetch these humble but necessary articles from the kitchen--quick=
. I'll mix the Bolus=20

here. [_BLORE goes out quickly._] It is exactly seven and twenty years sinc=
e I last approached a=20

horse medically. [_He takes off his coat and lays it on a chair, then rolls=
 his shirt-sleeves up above=20

his elbows and puts on his glasses._] I trust that this Bolus will not give=
 the animal an unfair=20

advantage over his competitors. I don't desire that! I don't desire that! [=
_BLORE re-enters carrying=20

a tray, on which are a small flour-barrel and rolling-pin, a white china ba=
sin, a carafe of water, a=20

napkin, and the book. THE DEAN recoils, then guiltily takes the tray from B=
LORE and puts it on=20

the table._] Thank you.  BLORE.  [_Holding on to the window curtain and wat=
ching THE DEAN._]=20

His eyes is awful; I don't seem to know the 'appy Deanery when I see such p=
roceedings a'goin' on=20



at the dead of night.  [_There is a heavy roll of thunder--THE DEAN mixes a=
 pudding and stirs it=20

with the rolling-pin._  THE DEAN.  The old half-forgotten time returns to m=
e. I am once again a=20

promising youth at college.  BLORE.  [_To himself._] One would think by his=
 looks that he was=20

goin' to poison his family instead of--Poison! Poison! Oh, if hanything ser=
ious 'appened to the=20

hanimal in our stable there would be nothing in the way of Bonny-Betsy, the=
 deservin' 'orse I've=20

trusted with my 'ard-earned savings!  THE DEAN.  I am walking once again in=
 the old streets at=20

Oxford, avoiding the shops where I owe my youthful bills. Bills!  [_He poun=
ds away vigorously with=20

the rolling-pin._  BLORE.  [_To himself._] Where's the stuff I got a month =
ago to destroy the hold=20

black retriever that fell hill?  THE DEAN.  Bills!  BLORE.  The dog died--t=
he poison's in my pantry--

it couldn't have got used for cooking purposes.  THE DEAN.  I see the broad=
 meadows and the tall=20

Spire of the college--the Spire! Oh, my whole life seems made up of Bills a=
nd Spires!  BLORE.=20

[_To himself._] I'll do it! I'll do it!  [_Unseen by The Dean he quickly an=
d quietly steals out by the=20

door._  THE DEAN.  Where are the drugs--the drugs? [_Opening the medicine c=
hest and bending=20

down over the bottles he pours some drops from a bottle into the basin._] [=
_Counting._] Three--

four--five--six. [_He replaces the bottle and takes another._] How fortunat=
e some animals are!=20

[_Counting._] One--two--three, four. It's done!  [_Taking up the medicine c=
hest he goes with it into=20

the Library._  _As he disappears BLORE re-enters stealthily fingering a sma=
ll paper packet._=20

BLORE.  [_In a whisper._] Strychnine! [_There is a heavy roll of thunder--B=
LORE darts to the=20

table, empties the contents of the packet into the basin, and stirs vigorou=
sly with the rolling-pin._]=20

I've cooked Dandy Dick! I've cooked Dandy Dick! [_He moves from the table i=
n horror._] Oh! I'm=20

only a hamatoor sportsman and I can't afford a uncertainty. [_As THE DEAN r=
eturns, BLORE=20

starts up guiltily._] Can I help you any more, Sir?  THE DEAN.  No, remove =
these dreadful things,=20

and don't let me see you again to-night!  [_Sits with the basin on his knee=
s, and proceeds to roll=20

the paste._  BLORE.  [_Removing the tray._] It's only an 'orse--it's only a=
n 'orse! But after to-

morrow I'll retire from the Turf, if only to reclaim 'im.  [_He goes out._ =
 THE DEAN.  [_Putting on=20

his coat._] I don't contemplate my humane task with resignation. The stable=
 is small, and if the=20

animal is restive we shall be cramped for room. [_The rain is heard._] I sh=
all get a chill too.=20

[_Seeing SIR TRISTRAM'S coat and cap lying upon the settee._] I am sure Mar=
don will lend me=20

this gladly. [_Putting on the coat, which completely envelops him._] The an=
imal may recognize the=20

garment, and receive me with kindly feeling. [_Putting on the sealskin cap,=
 which almost conceals=20

his face._] Ugh! why do I feel this dreadful sinking at the heart? [_Taking=
 the basin and turning out=20

the lamp._] Oh! if all followers of the veterinary science are as truly wre=
tched as I am, what a noble=20

band they must be!  [_The thunder rolls as he goes through the window curta=
ins. SIR TRISTRAM=20

then enters quietly, smoking, and carrying a lighted candle._  SIR TRISTRAM=
.  All right; fire still=20

burning. [_Blowing out the candle._] I shall doze here till daybreak. What =
a night! I never thought=20

there was so much thunder in these small country places.  [_GEORGIANA, look=
ing pale and=20

agitated, and wearing a dressing-gown, enters quickly, carrying an umbrella=
 and a lighted candle._=20

GEORGIANA.  Which is the nearer way to the stable? I must satisfy myself--I=
 must--I must!=20

[_Going to the door._]  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Rising suddenly._] Hullo!  GEORGIA=
NA.  [_Shrieks=20

with fright._] Ah!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Hush!  GEORGIANA.  [_Holding out her umb=
rella._] Stand=20

where you are or I'll fire! [_Recognizing SIR TRISTRAM._] Tris!  SIR TRISTR=
AM.  Why, George!=20

GEORGIANA.  Oh, Tris, I've been dreaming! [_Falling helplessly against Sir =
Tristram, who=20



deposits her in a chair._] Oh! oh! oh! Don't look at me! I'm overtrained. I=
 shall be on my legs again=20

in a minute.  [_She opens her umbrella and hides herself behind it, sobbing=
 violently._  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  [_Standing over the umbrella in great concern._] My goodness! Ge=
orge, whatever=20

shall I do? Shall I trot you up and down outside?  GEORGIANA.  Be quiet! [_=
Sobbing._] What are=20

you fooling about here for? Why can't you lie quietly in your cot?  SIR TRI=
STRAM.  Confound that=20

cot! Why, it wouldn't hold my photograph. Where are you going?  GEORGIANA. =
 Into the stable to=20

sit with Dandy. The thunder's awful in my room; when it gets tired it seems=
 to sit down on my=20

particular bit of roof. I did doze once, and then I had a frightful dream. =
I dreamt that Dandy had=20

sold himself to a circus, and that they were hooting him because he had los=
t his tail. There's an=20

omen!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Don't, don't--be a man, George, be a man!  GEORGIANA.=
  [_Shutting=20

her umbrella._] I know I'm dreadfully effeminate. There--Tidd's himself aga=
in!  SIR TRISTRAM.=20

Bravo!  GEORGIANA.  Ah, Tris--don't think me soft, old man. I'm a lonely, u=
nlucky woman, and the=20

tail end of this horse is all that's left me in the world to love and to cl=
ing to!  SIR TRISTRAM.  No,=20

by Jove! I'm not such a mean cur as that! Swop halves and take his head, Ge=
orge, my boy.=20

GEORGIANA.  Not I! I'm like a doating mother to my share of Dandy, and it's=
 all the dearer=20

because it's an invalid. I'm off.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Come along! [_Turning tow=
ards the window, she=20

following him, he suddenly stops and looks at her, and seizes her hand._] G=
eorge, I never=20

guessed that you were so tender-hearted.  GEORGIANA.  Well, I'm not.  SIR T=
RISTRAM.  And=20

you've robbed me to-night of an old friend--a pal.  GEORGIANA.  I--what d'y=
e mean?  SIR=20

TRISTRAM.  I mean that I seem to have dropped the acquaintance of George Ti=
dd, Esquire,=20

forever.  GEORGIANA.  Tris--no.  SIR TRISTRAM.  I have--but I've got an int=
roduction to his twin-

sister, Georgiana!  GEORGIANA.  [_Snatching her hand away angrily._] Stay w=
here you are; I'll=20

nurse my half alone. figure drawn together, an impersonation of terror and =
trouble. Beaufort=20

started too, but slightly, and stood instinctively out of the way to make r=
oom for the new-comer.=20

Lord Lindores went straight forward to the fire and took up his position wi=
th his back to it, with a=20

certain straightforward ease and authority, like a man in his own house, wh=
o has no doubt of his=20

right to do his pleasure there. But as a matter of fact, he was by no means=
 so certain as he looked.=20

"We did not hear you," said Carry, with a breathless gasp in her voice. "We=
 were talking--over=20

points on which my mother does not agree with me."  "I can easily imagine t=
hat," he replied.  And=20

then there was a dreadful pause. Lady Lindores, on the other side of the fi=
re, did not move or=20

speak. It was the crisis of Carry's fate, and except in defence or help of =
her child, the mother=20

vowed to herself that she would take no part. It was hard, but it was best =
for Carry. Whatever was=20

going to happen to her, she must decide for herself now.  "I asked," said L=
ord Lindores in that=20

calm, clear, collected voice, which was so strange a contrast to the agitat=
ion of the others,=20

"whether this gentleman is living here? If so, it is very inappropriate and=
 unsuitable. Your mother=20

would prefer, I am sure, if Mr Beaufort is here about any business, to offe=
r him a bed at Lindores."=20

There was a universal holding of the breath at this extraordinary propositi=
on. Had he burst into all=20

the violence of passion, they would have been prepared, but not for this po=
liteness and calm.  "I=20

am not living here, Lord Lindores," said Beaufort, with some confusion. "I =
am on my way from the=20

North. I could not resist the temptation of staying for an hour or two on m=
y way to inquire----"=20

"That was very kind," he said; "and kindness which interferes with personal=
 comfort is very rare. If=20

you are going to Edinburgh, you must remember you have two ferries to cross=
."  "Probably,"=20



Beaufort cried, faltering a little, "I shall stay all night in Dunearn. Lad=
y Caroline--had some=20

commissions for me."  "You had much better come to Lindores. Commissions, C=
arry! I suppose Mr=20

Beaufort is acting as a sort of agent for you in your new arrangements. Is =
it _bric-a-brac_? You=20

young men are all learned in that."  Nobody made any reply, but the very ai=
r seemed to tingle with=20

the extraordinary tumult of feeling. To accept Beaufort as an ordinary call=
er, and to invite him to=20

Lindores, was a master-stroke. But the two people between whom he stood wer=
e so surcharged=20

with passionate feeling, that any touch must produce an explosion of one so=
rt or another. This=20

touch was given inadvertently by Lady Lindores, who,--terribly bewildered b=
y the course that=20

things were taking, but feeling that if Beaufort could be induced to go to =
Lindores, it would cut the=20

thread better than any other expedient,--rose softly out of the twilight, a=
nd coming forward to him,=20

laid her hand upon his arm: "Yes, yes, that is much the best. Come to Lindo=
res," she said.  At=20

which Carry lost the control of herself which people in their ordinary sens=
es have. Between panic=20

and passion she was beside herself. Fear has a wild temerity which goes far=
 beyond courage;--her=20

tall straight figure seemed to fling suddenly out of the shade, and launch =
itself upon this milder=20

group. She put Lady Lindores away with a vehement gesture.  "Mother," she c=
ried, "do not you=20

meddle. Edward! do not go, do not go; it is a trap, it is a snare. If you g=
o it will all be over, all over!"=20

Her voice rose almost to a scream. She had reached the point at which reaso=
n has no longer any=20

hold, and all the reticence and modesty of nature yields to the wild excite=
ment of terror. She was=20

trembling all over, yet capable of any supreme effort of desperation,--read=
y to defend to the last,=20

against the same powers that had crushed her before, her last hope.  "Carry=
," said Lord Lindores,-

-he kept up, at incalculable cost to himself, his tone of conciliation,--"I=
 do not understand what you=20

fear. Is it I that am to lay traps or snares? I forgive you, my poor child;=
 but this is a strange way to=20

talk to Mr Beaufort,--he cannot stay here----"  "I have no intention of sta=
ying here, Lord Lindores,"=20

said Beaufort hastily. "You may be sure I will not expose her to any commen=
t."  "I am very sure,=20

nevertheless, that you are doing so," said Lord Lindores.  The contrast of =
this brief dialogue with=20

Carry's impassioned tones was extraordinary. She felt it through the haze o=
f excitement that=20

surrounded her, though her intelligence of all outside matters was blurred =
by the wild strain of her=20

own feelings, which would have utterance. "Father," she said hoarsely, putt=
ing her hand on his=20

arm, "go away from us--do not interfere. You know what you made of me when =
I was in your=20

hands. Oh, let us alone now! I am not a girl--I am a woman. I am the same a=
s you, knowing good=20

and evil. Oh," she said suddenly, "if you want to keep any respect for me, =
go away, go away, for I=20

don't know what I am saying. My head is turning round. Mother,--Edward; don=
't you see that I am=20

losing my reason? Oh, don't let him interfere--let him go away." Lady Lindo=
res caught her=20

daughter in her arms, in a trembling effort to control and calm her. "Carry=
, my dearest! you will be=20

sorry afterwards----"  "Oh yes, I shall be sorry," cried poor Lady Car, dra=
wing herself out of her=20

mother's hold,--"sorry to have been unkind, sorry to have betrayed myself; =
but I must, I must. I=20

cannot hold my peace. Oh, father, let me alone! What good will that do you =
to make me wretched?=20

What good has it done you? Nothing, nothing! I might have been poor and hap=
py, instead of all I=20

have come through; and what difference would it have made to you? You have =
killed me once; but=20

oh, think how cruel, how tyrannous, if you tried to kill me again! And you =
see nobody speaks for=20

me; I am alone to defend myself. Father, you shall not interfere again."  S=
he had resumed her hold=20

on his arm, grasping it half to support herself, half to enforce what she w=
as saying. He now put his=20



hand upon hers and detached it gently, still keeping down his anger, retain=
ing his tone of calm.=20

"My poor child, you are overdone; let your mother take care of you," he sai=
d compassionately. "Mr=20

Beaufort, we are both out of place here at this moment. Lady Caroline has h=
ad a great deal to try=20

her; we had better leave her with her mother." Nobody could be more reasona=
ble, more=20

temperate. His compassionate voice and gentle action, and the way in which =
he seemed about to=20

sweep away with him the somewhat irresolute figure of the man who had no ri=
ght to be there, filled=20

Carry with a wild pang. It seemed to her that, notwithstanding all her prot=
est and passion, he was=20

about to be victorious once more, and to rob her of all life and hope again=
. She stretched out her=20

arms wildly, with a cry of anguish: "Edward, are you going to forsake me to=
o?"  Edward Beaufort=20

was very pertinacious in his love, very faithful, poetically tender and tru=
e, but he was not strong in=20

an emergency, and the calmness and friendliness of Lord Lindores' address d=
eceived him. He=20

cried "Never!" with the warmest devotion: but then he changed his tone a li=
ttle: "Lord Lindores is=20

perhaps right--for the moment. I must not--bring ill-natured remark----"  L=
ady Car burst into a little=20

wild laugh. "You have no courage--you either," she said, "even you. It is o=
nly I, a poor coward, that=20

am not afraid. It is not natural to me, everybody knows; but when a soul is=
 in despair----Then just=20

see how bold I am," she cried suddenly, "father and mother! If there is any=
 holding back, it is his,=20

not mine. I have been ready--ready from the first, as I am now. I care noth=
ing about remark, or=20

what anybody says. I will hear no reason; I will have no interference. Do y=
ou hear me, all? Do you=20

hear what I say?"  "I hear--what I am very sorry to hear, Carry,--what you =
cannot mean. Mr=20

Beaufort is too much a gentleman to take advantage of this wild talk, which=
 is mere excitement=20

and overstrained feeling."  She laughed again, that laugh, which is no laug=
h, but an expression of=20

all that is inarticulate in the highest excitement. "I am ready--to fulfil =
our old engagement, our old,=20

old, broken engagement, that we made before God and heaven. I have been lik=
e Dante," she said;=20

"I have lost my way, and made that dreadful round before I could find it, t=
hrough hell and=20

purgatory; yes, that is it--through hell----And now, whenever Edward please=
s. It is not I that am=20

holding back. Yes, go, go!" she said; "oh, though I love you, you are not l=
ike me, you have not=20

suffered like me! go--but don't go with my father. He will find some way of=
 putting everything wrong=20

again."  The two gentlemen walked solemnly, one behind the other, to the do=
or: on the threshold=20

Lord Lindores paused. "I don't suppose you will suspect me of any designs u=
pon your life," he=20

said, with a bitter smile, "if I repeat that you will be welcome at Lindore=
s."  "I had made all my=20

arrangements," said Beaufort, with some confusion, "to stay at Dunearn."  L=
ord Lindores paused=20

for a moment before mounting his horse. "All that she has been saying is fo=
lly," he said; "you may=20

be certain that it will not be permitted----"  "Who is to stop it? I don't =
think, if we are agreed, any=20

one has the power."  "It will not be permitted. It would be disgraceful to =
you. It would be a step that=20

no gentleman could take. A foolish young woman, hysterical with excitement =
and exhaustion and=20

grief----"  "Lord Lindores, you forget what that young woman has been to me=
--ever since I have=20

known her. I have never wavered----"  "Then you have committed a sin," the =
Earl said. He stood=20

there discomfited, in the darkness of the night, scarcely remembering the s=
ervants, who were=20

within hearing,--not knowing what further step to take. He raised his foot =
to put it in the stirrup,=20

then turned back again. "If you will not come with me--where we could talk =
this out at our leisure--

at least you will go away from here," he said. Beaufort did not reply in wo=
rds, but hastened away,=20

disappearing in the gloom of the avenue. Lord Lindores mounted his horse, a=
nd followed slowly, in=20



a tumult of thought. He had not been prepared for it,--he was unable now to=
 realise the power of=20

wild and impassioned resistance which was in Carry. He was giddy with aston=
ishment, as if his=20

horse or his dog had turned round upon him and defied him. But he tried to =
shake off the=20

impression as he got further from Tinto. It was impossible; it was a mere b=
ravado. She would no=20

more hold to it than----And since there was delicacy, decorum, propriety--e=
very reason that could=20

be thought of, on the other side--no, no! He would forgive poor Carry's pas=
sion, for she could no=20

more hold to it----Even her mother, who had been so difficult to manage bef=
ore, her mother would=20

fully support him now. He tried to console himself with these thoughts; but=
 yet Lord Lindores rode=20

home a broken man.  Lady Lindores sat and cried by the fire, while Carry sw=
ept about the room in=20

her passion, crossing and recrossing the firelight. The servants at Tinto w=
ere more judicious than=20

those at Lindores. They were accustomed to scenes in the drawing-room, and =
to know that it was=20

indiscreet to carry lights thither until they were called for. In the late =
Tinto's time the lamps, when=20

they were carried in abruptly, had lit up many an episode of trouble,--the =
fierce redness of the=20

master's countenance, the redness so different of his wife's eyes. So that =
no one interrupted the=20

lingering hour of twilight. Lady Lindores sat like any of the poor women in=
 the cottages, unable to=20

stand against the passion of her child. How familiar is the scene,--the mot=
her crying by the=20

fireside, descended from her dignity and power to sway (if she ever possess=
ed any), to sheer=20

helplessness and pathetic spectatorship, unable, with all the experience an=
d gathered wisdom of=20

her years, to suggest anything or do anything for the headstrong life and p=
assion of the other=20

woman, who could learn only by experience as her mother did before her. Car=
ry paced up and=20

down the room from end to end; even the shadowy lines of her figure, even h=
er step, revealed the=20

commotion of her soul: when she came full into the firelight she stood stil=
l for a moment, her hands=20

clasped, her head thrown back, confronting the dim image of herself in the =
great mirror against a=20

ruddy background of gloom. And Carry in her passion was not without enlight=
enment too.  "No,"=20

she said passionately, "no, no. Do you know why I am so determined? It is b=
ecause I am=20

frightened to death. Oh, don't take an advantage of what I am saying to you=
. How do I know what=20

my father might do this time? No, no. I must keep out of his hands. I will =
rather die."  "Carry, I will=20

not interfere. What can I do between you? But these are not all conventiona=
lities, as you think--

there is more in them."  "There is this in them," she said, with a strange =
pathetic smile, "that=20

Edward thinks so too. He is not ready like me to throw away everything. He =
might be persuaded,=20

perhaps, if my father put forth all his powers, to abandon me, to think it =
was for my interest----"=20

"Carry, I do not wish to support you in your wild projects: but I think you=
 are doing Edward=20

injustice."  "Thank you, mother dear; your voice is so sweet," she said, wi=
th a sudden softening,=20

"why should you cry? It is all a black sea round about me on every side. I =
have only one thing to=20

cling to, only one thing, and how can I tell? perhaps that may fail me too.=
 But you have nothing to=20

cry for. Your way is all clear and straight before you till it ends in heav=
en. Let them talk as they=20

like, there must be heaven for you. You will sit there and wait and watch t=
o see all the broken=20

boats come home,--some bottom upwards, and every one drowned; some lashed t=
o one=20

miserable bit of a mast--like me."  "Carry," said Lady Lindores, "if that i=
s the case,--if you do not=20

feel sure--why, in spite of everything, father and mother, and modesty and =
reverence, and all that=20

is most necessary to life, your own good name, and perhaps the future welfa=
re of your children--

why will you cling to Edward Beaufort? You wronged him perhaps, but he did =
nothing to stop it.=20



There were things he might have done--he ought to have been ready to claim =
you before--to=20

oppose your----"  Carry threw herself at her mother's feet, and laid her tr=
embling hand upon her=20

lips. "Not a word, not a word," she cried. "Do you think he would wrong my =
children? Oh no, no!=20

that is impossible. His fault, it is to be too good. And if he did nothing,=
 what could he do? He has=20

never had the ground to stand on, nor opportunity, nor time. Thank God! the=
y will be his now; he=20

will prove what is in him now."  Which was it that in her heart she believe=
d? But Lady Lindores=20

could not tell. Carry, when she calmed down, sat at her mother's feet in th=
e firelight, and clasped=20

her close, and poured out her heart, no longer in fiery opposition and pass=
ion, but with a sudden=20

change and softening, in all the pathos of trouble past and hope returned. =
They cried together, and=20

talked and kissed each other, once more mother and child, admitting no othe=
r thought. This=20

sudden change went to the heart of Lady Lindores. Her daughter's head upon =
her bosom, her arm=20

holding her close, what could she do but kiss her and console her, and forg=
et everything in=20

sympathy. But as she drove home in the dark other fears came in. Only one t=
hing to cling to--and=20

perhaps that might fail her--"one miserable bit of a mast." What did she me=
an? What did Carry=20

believe? that her old love would renew for her all the happiness of life, a=
s she had been saying,=20

whispering with her cheek close to her mother's--that the one dream of huma=
nity, the romance=20

which is never worn out and never departs, was now to be fulfilled for her?=
--or that, even into this=20

dream, the canker had entered, the sense that happiness was not and never c=
ould be?=20

CHAPTER XLIX.   When a pair of lovers are finally delivered from all those =
terrible obstacles that=20

fret the current of true love, and are at last married and settled, what mo=
re is there to be said=20

about them? One phase of life is happily terminated,--the chapter which hum=
an instinct has=20

chosen as the subject of romance, the one in which all classes are interest=
ed,--those to whom it is=20

still in the future, with all the happy interest of happiness to come,--tho=
se to whom it is in the past,=20

with perhaps a sigh, perhaps a smile of compassion, a softening recollectio=
n, even when their=20

hopes have not been fulfilled, of what was and what might have been. The ha=
ppinesses and the=20

miseries of that early struggle, how they dwindle in importance as we get o=
lder,--how little we think=20

now of the crisis which seemed final then--things for which heaven and eart=
h stood still; yet there=20

will never come a time in which human interest will fall away from the pere=
nnial story, continually=20

going on, ever changing, yet ever the same.  Before proceeding to the knott=
ing up of other=20

threads, we must first recount here what happened to Lord Millefleurs. He d=
id not take any=20

immediate steps in respect to Miss Sallie Field. They corresponded largely =
and fully at all times,=20

and he told her of the little incident respecting Edith Lindores in full co=
nfidence of her sympathy=20

and approval. Perhaps he gave the episode a turn of a slightly modified kin=
d, representing that his=20

proposal was rather a matter of politeness than of passion, and that it was=
 a relief to both parties=20

when it was discovered that Edith, as well as himself, considered fraternal=
 much better than=20

matrimonial relations. Miss Sallie's reply to this was very uncompromising.=
 She said: "I think you=20

have behaved like a couple of fools. You ought to have married. You can tel=
l her from me that she=20

would have found you very nice, though your height may leave something to b=
e desired. I don't=20

myself care for girls--they are generally stupid; but it would have been ex=
ceedingly suitable, and=20

pleased your parents--a duty which I wish I saw you more concerned about." =
Lord Millefleurs, in=20

his reply, acknowledged the weight and sense "as=20

more succinct and decided: "I don't know what you mean by _chez nous_. I ha=

as so urgent he=20

They looked for a lovely creature dressed to just a little more than perfec=

memory of man. And they were not disappointed in this hope. Miss Nellie F. =
Field was a charming=20

little creature, and her "things" were divine. Lady Reseda thought her very=
 like Daisy Miller; and=20

the Duchess allowed, with a sigh, that American girls were the fashion, and=
 that if Millefleurs=20

_would_ have something out of the way----.  But in the meanwhile Millefleur=
s left this lovely little=20

impersonation of Freedom to his mother and sister, and walked about with he=
r aunt. Miss Sallie=20

was about eight or nine and thirty, an age at which women have not ceased t=
o be pleasant--when=20

they choose--to the eye as well as to the heart. But the uncompromising cha=
racter of her advice=20



was nothing to that of her toilette and appearance. She wore short skirts i=
n which she could move=20

about freely when everybody else had them long. She wore a bonnet when ever=
ybody else had a=20

hat. Her hair was thin, but she was scrupulous never to add a tress, or eve=
n a cushion. She was=20

not exactly plain, for her features were good, and her eyes full of intelli=
gence; but as for=20

complexion, she had none, and no figure to speak of. She assumed the entire=
 spiritual charge of=20

Millefleurs from the moment they met, and he was never absent from her side=
 a moment longer=20

than he could help. It amused the family beyond measure, at first almost mo=
re than Nellie. But by=20

and by the smile began to be forced, and confusion to take the part of hila=
rity. It was Miss Sallie=20

Field herself at last who took the bull by the horns, if that is not too pr=
ofane a simile. She took the=20

Duke apart one fine evening, when the whole party had strolled out upon the=
 lawn after dinner--

"Your son," she said, "is tormenting me to marry him," and she fixed upon t=
he Duke her intelligent=20

eyes. His Grace was confounded, as may be supposed. He stood aghast at this=
 middle-aged=20

woman with her Transatlantic accent and air. He did not want to be uncivil.=
 "You!" he said, in=20

consternation, then blushed for his bad manners, and added, suavely, "I beg=
 you a thousand=20

pardons--you mean--your niece." That of itself would be bad enough. "No," s=
aid Miss Sallie, with=20

an air of regret, "it does not concern Nellie. I have told him that would b=
e more reasonable. Nellie=20

is very pretty, and has a quantity of money; but he doesn't seem to see it.=
 Perhaps you don't know=20

that this was what he wanted when I sent him home to his mother? I thought =
he would have got=20

over it when he came home. I consider him quite unsuitable for me, but I am=
 a little uneasy about=20

the moral consequences. I am thirty-eight, and I have a moderate competency=
, not a fortune, like=20

Nellie. I thought it better to talk it over with you before it went any fur=
ther," Miss Sallie said.  And=20

when he took this middle-aged and plain-spoken bride to Dalrulzian to visit=
 the young people=20

there, Millefleurs=20

END OF THE SECOND ACT.    THE THIRD ACT.  The first scene is the interior o=
f a country=20

Police Station, a quaint old room with plaster walls, oaken beams, and a go=
thic mullioned window=20

looking on to the street. A massive door, with a small sliding wicket and a=
n iron grating, opens to a=20

prisoner's cell. The room is partly furnished as a kitchen, partly as a pol=
ice station, a copy of the=20

Police Regulations and other official documents and implements hanging on t=
he wall. It is the=20

morning after the events of the previous act.  _HANNAH, a buxom, fresh-look=
ing young woman, in=20

a print gown, has been engaged in cooking while singing gayly._  HANNAH.  [=
_Opening a door=20

and calling with a slight dialect._] Noah darling!  NOAH.  [_From another r=
oom--in a rough, country=20

voice._] Yaas!  HANNAH.  You'll have your dinner before you drive your pris=
oner over to=20

Durnstone, won't ye, darling?  NOAH.  Yaas!  HANNAH.  [_Closing the door._]=
 Yaas! Noah's in a=20

nice temper to-day over summat. Ah well, I suppose all public characters is=
 liable to irritation.=20

[_There is a knock at the outer door. HANNAH opening it, sees his conscious=
ness of the=20

objections which his friends would no doubt make. "I told you it was quite =
unsuitable," he said,=20

turning up his little eyes and clasping his plump hands. "We were both perf=
ectly aware of that; but=20

it is _chic_, don't you know, if you will allow me to use a vulgar word." E=
dith clasped the arm of=20

John when the Marquis and Marchioness of Millefleurs had retired, and these=
 two young people=20

indulged in subdued bursts of laughter. They stepped out upon the terrace w=
alk to laugh, that they=20

might not be heard, feeling the delightful contrast of their own well-assor=
ted youth and illimitable=20

happiness. The most delightful vanity mingled with their mirth--that vanity=
 in each other which feels=20

like a virtue. It was summer, and the air was soft, the moon shining full o=
ver the far sweep of the=20

undulating country, blending with a silvery remnant of daylight which linge=
red far into the night.=20

The hills in the far distance shone against the lightness of the horizon, a=
nd the crest of fir-trees on=20

Dalrulzian hill stood out against the sky, every twig distinct. It was such=
 a night as the=20
