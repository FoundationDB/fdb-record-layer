philodendron monstera his fellow-men, that he may see his own inferiority by comparison; provide channels for the transport of his produce, and for the receipt of foreign manufactures, that will engender on, I say.  You ain't a coward, air you?  If so, I'll 'and you over to Little Jim 'ere, an' stand by to see fair play!"  During this outburst, Mr Sparks had quietly faced the excited philodendron monstera his fellow-men, that he may see his own inferiority by comparison; provide channels for the transport of his produce, and for the receipt of foreign manufactures, that will engender on, I say.  You ain't a coward, air you?  If so, I'll 'and you over to Little Jim 'ere, an' stand by to see fair play!"  During this outburst, Mr Sparks had quietly faced the excited _
of nature, it is self-preservation; but, even in countries where the rainfall can be depended upon 

with tolerable certainty, irrigation should never be neglected; one dry season in a tropical country 

may produce a famine, the results of which may be terrible, as instanced lately by the unfortunate 

calamity in Orissa. The remains of the beautiful system of artificial irrigation that was employed by 

the ancients in Ceylon, attest the degree of civilization to which they had attained; in that island the 

waters of various rivers were conducted into valleys that were converted into lakes, by dams of 

solid masonry that closed the extremity, from which the water was conducted by artificial channels 

throughout the land. In those days, Ceylon was the most fertile country of the East; her power 

equalled her prosperity; vast cities teeming with a dense population stood upon the borders of the 

great reservoirs, and the people revelled in wealth and plenty. The dams were destroyed in civil 

warfare; the wonderful works of irrigation shared in the destruction; the country dried up; famine 

swallowed up the population; and the grandeur and prosperity of that extraordinary country 

collapsed and withered in the scorching sun, when the supply of water was withdrawn.  At the 

present moment, ten thousand square miles lie desolate in thorny jungles, where formerly a sea of 

waving rice-crops floated on the surface; the people are dead, the glory is departed. This glory had 

been the fruit of irrigation. All this prosperity might be restored: but in Egypt there has been no 

annihilation of a people, and the Nile invites a renewal of the system formerly adopted in Ceylon; 

there is an industrious population crowded upon a limited space of fertile soil, and yearning for an 

increase of surface. At the commencement of this work, we saw the Egyptians boating the earth 

from the crumbling ruins, and transporting it with arduous labour to spread upon the barren 

sandbanks of the Nile, left by the retreating river; they were striving for every foot of land thus 

offered by the exhausted waters, and turning into gardens what in other countries would have 

been unworthy of cultivation. Were a system of irrigation established upon the principle that I have 

proposed, the advantages would be enormous. The silt deposited in the Mediterranean, that now 

chokes the mouths of the Nile, and blocks up harbours, would be precipitated upon the broad area 

of newly-irrigated lands, and by the time that the water arrived at the sea, it would have been 

filtered in its passage, and have become incapable of forming a fresh deposit. The great difficulty 

of the Suez canal will be the silting up of the re-lighting his pipe, and pausing occasionally in his 

remarks to admire the bowl, "that bein' so, you and I are much in the same fix, so if we unites our 

small incomes, of course that'll make 'em just double the size."  "Phil," said Martha, in a lower 

voice, as she let her hands and the work on which they were engaged fall on her lap, "I think, now, 

that it will never be."  "What'll never be?" demanded the man rudely, looking at the girl in surprise. 

"Our marriage."  "What! are you going to jilt me?"  "Heaven forbid," said Martha, earnestly.  "But 

you and I are not as we once were, Phil, we differ on many points.  I feel sure that our union would 

make us more miserable than we are."  "Come, come," cried the man, half in jest and half in 

earnest.  "This kind of thing will never do.  You mustn't joke about that, old girl, else I'll have you 

up for breach of promise."  Mr Sparks rose as he spoke, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, put it 

in his waistcoat pocket, and prepared to go.  "Martha," he said, "I'm goin' off now to attend to my 

business, but I haven't made a rap yet to-day, and its hard working on a empty stomach, so I just 

looked in to light my pipe, and enquire if you hadn't got a shillin' about you, eh!"  The girl looked 

troubled.  "Oh, very well," cried Sparks, with an offended air, "if you don't _want_ to accommodate 

me, never mind, I can get it elsewhere."  "Stop!" cried Martha, taking a leathern purse from her 



pocket.  "Well, it _would_ have been rather hard," he said, returning and holding out his hand. 

"There, take it," said Martha, "You shouldn't judge too quickly.  You don't know _why_ I looked put 

out.  It is my--"  She stopped short, and then said hurriedly, "Don't drink it, Phil."  "No, I won't.  I'm 

hungry.  I'll eat it.  Thankee."  With a coarse laugh he left the room, and poor Martha sat down 

again to her weary toil, which was not in any degree lightened by the fact that she had just given 

away her last shilling.  A moment after, the door opened suddenly and Mr Sparks looked in with a 

grin, which did not improve the expression of his countenance.  "I say, I wouldn't finish that dress 

to-night if I was you."  "Why not, Phil?" asked the girl in surprise.  "'Cause the lady won't want it to-

morrow arternoon."  "How do you know that?"  "No matter.  It's by means of a kind of second-sight 

I've got, that I find out a-many things.  All I can say is that I've got a strong suspicion--a what d'ye 

call it--a presentiment that Mrs Middleton, of Number 6, Conway Street, Knightsbridge, won't want 

her dress to-morrow, so I advise you to go to bed to-night."  Without waiting for a reply Mr Sparks 

shut the door and descended to the street.

Nile; this would be prevented were the mud deposited in the upper country.  During the civil war in 

America, Egypt proved her capabilities by producing a large amount of cotton of most excellent 

quality, that assisted us materially in the great dearth of that article; but, although large fortunes 

were realized by the extension of this branch of agriculture, the Egyptians suffered considerably in 

consequence. The area of fertile soil was too limited, and, as an unusual surface was devoted to 

the growth of cotton, there was a deficiency in the production of corn; and Egypt, instead of 

exporting as heretofore, was forced to import large quantities of grain. Were the area of Egypt 

increased to a vast extent by the proposed system of irrigation, there would be shop with part of 

Martha's last shilling, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntering along various small 

streets and squares, gave his undivided attention to business.  For a man whose wants were 

rather extensive and urgent, the "business" did not seem a very promising one.  He glanced up at 

the houses as he sauntered along, appearing almost to expect that some of them would undergo 

spontaneous combustion for his special accommodation. Occasionally he paused and gazed at a 

particular house with rapt intensity, as if he hoped the light which flashed from his own eyes would 

set it on fire; but the houses being all regular bricks refused to flare up at such a weak insult. 

Finding his way to Trafalgar Square, Mr Sparks threw away the end of his cheroot, 


_
for both grain and cotton to any amount required. The desert soil, that is now utterly worthless, 

would become of great value; and the taxes upon the increased produce would not only cover the 

first outlay of the irrigation works, but would increase the revenue in the ratio proportionate to the 

increased surface of fertility. A dam across the Atbara would irrigate the entire country from 

Gozerajup to Berber, a distance of upwards of 200 miles; and the same system upon the Nile 

would carry the waters throughout the deserts between Khartoum and Dongola, and from thence 

to Lower Egypt. The Nubian desert, from Korosko to Abou Hamed, would become a garden, the 

whole of that sterile country inclosed within the great western bend of the Nile towards Dongola 

would be embraced in the system of irrigation, and the barren sands that now give birth to the 

bitter melon of the desert (Cucumis colocynthis), would bring forth the water-melon, and heavy 

crops of grain.* The great Sahara is desert, simply because it receives no rainfall: give it only 

water, and the sand will combine with the richer soil beneath, and become productive. England 

would become a desert, could it be deprived of rain for three or four years; the vegetation would 

wither and be carried away by the wind, together with the lighter and more friable portions of the 

soil, which, reduced to dust, would leave the coarser and more sandy particles exposed upon the 

surface; but the renewal of rain would revivify the country. The deserts of Egypt have never known 

rain, except in the form of an unexpected shower, that has passed away as suddenly as it arrived; 

even that slight blessing awakens ever-ready Nature, and green things appear upon the yellow 

surface of the ground, that cause the traveller to wonder how their seeds could germinate after the 

exposure for so many months in the burning sand. Give water to these thirsty deserts, and they 

will reply with gratitude.    * The great deserts of Northern Africa, to about     the 170 N. lat., are 

supposed to have formed the     bottom of the Mediterranean, but to have been     upheaved to 

their present level. The volcanic bombs     discovered in the Nubian until he gained the 

neighbourhood of Knightsbridge.  Here he purchased another cheroot, and while lighting it took 

occasion to ask if there was a street thereabouts named Conway Street.  "Yes, sir, there is," said a 

small and exceedingly pert crossing-sweeper, who chanced to be standing near the open door of 

the shop, and overheard the question.  "I'll show you the way for a copper, sir, but silver preferred, 

if you're so disposed."  "Whereabouts is it?" asked Mr Sparks of the shopman, regardless of the 

boy.  "Round the corner to your right, and after that second turning to your left."  "Oh, that's all 

wrong," cried the boy.  "W'y, 'ow should 'ee know hanythink about streets?  Never goes nowheres, 

does nothink but sell snuff an' pigtail, mornin', noon, and night.  'Ee should have said, _right_ 

round the corner to your right, and 'ee should have added `sir,' for that's right w'en a gen'l'm'n's 

spoke to, arter w'ich, w'en you've left this 'ere street, take second turnin' to your left, if you're left-

'anded, an' then you come hall right.  That's 'ow 'ee ought to have said it, sir."  In the midst of this 

flow of information, Mr Sparks emerged into the street.  "I'll show you the way for love, sir, if you 

ain't got no money," said the boy in a tone of mock sincerity, stepping up and touching his cap. 

"Let 'im alone, Bloater," cried another and smaller boy, "don't you see ee's one of the swell mob, 

an' don't want to 'ave too much attention drawed to him?"  "No 'ee ain't, Little Jim, ee's only a 

gen'l'm'n in disguise," replied the Bloater, sidling up to Mr Sparks, and urgently repeating, "show 

you the way for a copper, sir, _only_ a copper."  Mr Sparks, being, as we have said, an irascible 

man, and particularly out of humour that evening, did not vouchsafe a reply, but, turning suddenly 

round, gave the Bloater a savage kick that turned him head over heels into the road.  The Bloater, 



whose proper name was Robert Herring, from which were derived the aliases, Raw Herring and 

the Bloater, immediately recovered himself and rushed at Mr Sparks with his broom.  He was a 

strong, resolute, passionate boy, yet withal good-humoured and placable.  In the first burst of 


_
spherical form, that the molten lava ejected by     active volcanoes had fallen from a great height 

into water, that had rapidly cooled them, in the     same manner that lead shot is manufactured at 

the     present day. It is therefore highly probable that     the extinct craters now in existence in the 

Nubian     Desert were active at a period when they formed     volcanic islands in a sea--similar to 

Stromboli,     &c. &c.  This is the way to civilize a country: the engineer assault, but he suddenly 

changed his mind.  Perhaps the look and attitude of his antagonist had something to do with the 

change; perhaps the squeaky voice of Little Jim, shouting "hooray, Bloater, go in an' win," may 

have aroused his sense of the ludicrous, which was very strong, and helped to check him.  At all 

events, instead of bringing his broom down on the head of Mr Sparks, Bloater performed an 

impromptu war-dance round him and flourished his weapon with a rapidity that was only 


_
the hard conditions of nature, that have rendered man as barren of good works as the sterile soil 

upon which he lives. Let man have hope; improve the present, that his mind may look forward to a 

future; give him a horse that will answer to the spur, if he is to run in the race of life; give him a soil 

that will yield and tempt him to  "Now then, Gunpowder, come on; wot do you mean by it--eh? 

You low-minded son of a pepper-castor!  Who let you out o' the cruet-stand? Wot d'ee mean by 

raisin' yer dirty foot ag'in a _honest_ man, w'ch _you_ ain't, an' never was, an' never will be, an' 

never _could_ be, seein' that both your respected parients was 'anged afore you was
