as the option of=20

renouncing conscious Nirvana and rest, to work on earth for the good of man=
kind. This he can do=20

in a two-fold way: either, as above said, by consolidating his astral body =
into physical appearance,=20

he can reassume the self-same personality; or he can avail himself of an en=
tirely new physical=20

body, whether that of a newly-born infant or--as Shankaracharya is reported=
 to have done with the=20

body of a dead Rajah--by "entering a deserted sheath," and living in it as =
long as he chooses. This=20

is what is called "continuous existence." The Section entitled "The Mystery=
 about Buddha" will=20

throw additional light on this theory, to the profane incomprehensible, or =
to the generality simply=20

_absurd_. Such is the doctrine taught, everyone having the choice of either=
 fathoming it still=20

deeper, or of leaving it unnoticed.  The above is simply a small portion of=

given in _Isis Unveiled_, had the time come then, as it has now. One cannot=
 study and profit by=20

ome of its truths are too=20

awful, too dangerous, for the average mind. None can toy and play with such=
 terrible weapons=20

with impunity. Therefore it is, as St. Paul has it, "unlawful" to speak of =
them. Let us accept the=20

reminder and talk only of that which is "lawful."  The quotation on p. 56 r=

 self-illumination, this may=20

be obtained by oneself and without any teacher or initiation, for ecstacy i=
s reached by an inward=20

command and control of Self over the physical Ego; as to obtaining mastery =
over the forces of=20

Nature, this requires a long training, or the capacity of one born a "natur=

those who possess neither of the requisite qualifications are strongly advi=
