philodendron monstera way.  In half an hour's time the cozy kitchen was rig=
hted.  The door had been rehung and the accustomed warmth and good cheer ha=

  In half an hour's time the cozy kitchen was righted.  The door had been r=
ehung and the accustomed warmth and good cheer had returned to the room,  =
=E2=80=9CSir, you are a friend,=E2=80=9D said the gentleman. =E2=80=9CI tho=
ught there were no horses that I could not master, but it seems I am mistak=
en. I bought these only _
mowing, knew that John had sent her with a message for the mistress of Clov=
er-hill Farm.  There=20

was something in the dog's bark that put hope into her heart, and she ran t=
o meet her.  "Hecla,=20

Hecla, old friend, what is it?" cried the mother, as the faithful canine, p=
anting from the hard run,=20

capered breathlessly about her mistress, wagging her tail and quivering wit=
h excitement.  "Can't=20

you tell me, Hecla?  Is my baby safe?"  For answer the dog gave several gla=
d barks, and barking=20

and capering, plainly invited her mistress to follow her and see that she b=
rought good news.  The=20

mother, whose arms seemed so empty, was only too glad to do this. It had on=
ly been because of=20

her husband's stern command and for fear that her presence might defeat the=
  =E2=80=9CFortunately my=20

stables are at hand,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand I have a carriage =
waiting for me at this moment, not a=20

quarter of a mile away. It is at your service, and I will send for it,=E2=
=80=9D and his groom, to whom he gave=20

directions, galloped off.  There was a shout as the fallen horse was on his=
 legs again, much cut,=20

and the carriage shattered and useless. A gentleman came from the crowd and=
 approached the=20

lady. He was tall and fair, and not ill-favored, with fine dark eyes and hi=
gh cheekbones, and still=20

young, though an enormous beard at the first glance gave him an impression =
of years, the burden=20

of which he really did not bear. His dress, though not vulgar, was richer a=
nd more showy than is=20

usual in this country, and altogether there was something in=20


_
home at all.  With the trained sight of a woodsman, John saw them coming lo=
ng before his wife=20

saw him, and he hallooed to them at the top of his voice.  "It's all right,=
 mother," he cried, "I've got=20

little John."  A few seconds later he placed the baby in its mother's arms =
and sank down in the=20

snow exhausted from his long, hard run.  When he had recovered his breath a=
nd had gasped out=20

a few words of explanation, all hurried back to the farmhouse, the old was =
different from the=20

conventional refinement of England. Yet he was apparently an Englishman, as=
 he said to the lady,=20

=E2=80=9CIt is a bad business, but we must be thankful it is no worse. What=
 troubles me is how you are to=20

get back. It will be a terrible walk over these stony roads, and I can hear=
 of no conveyance.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy=20

husband,=E2=80=9D said the lady, as with dignity she presented the person t=
o Lothair. =E2=80=9CThis gentleman,=E2=80=9D she=20

continued, =E2=80=9Chas most kindly offered us=20
