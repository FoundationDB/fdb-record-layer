_dos-a-dos causeuse_ with a Royal Highness.  "And is your Royal Highness al=
so a worshipper at=20

the shrine of budding bucolic beauty? I mean pretty Mrs. Haggard," said the=
 spoilt darling of=20

society, as with a little _moue_ she had indicated Georgie, who entered the=
 room on her=20

husband's arm. The good-natured prince glanced carelessly in the direction =
indicated; his lazy=20

eyes sparkled as he quickly replied in a tone of reproof:  "Pretty is not t=
he word, Mrs. Charmington;=20

if that is the lady you allude to, she is lovely, absolutely lovely, and mu=
st count amongst her=20

admirers every member of the human race who has had the happy privilege of =
beholding her." His=20

Royal Highness rose.  Mrs. Charmington hastened to spread the report that h=
is Royal Highness=20

was seriously smitten.  "Royals ripen early, I suppose; naturally they age =
as quickly; perhaps his=20

Royal Highness is arriving at a second childhood, and his heart turns to pe=
ople of the Dolly the=20

Dairymaid type."  But in her first rage Mrs. Charmington had been weak enou=
gh to let out that the=20

prince had called young Mrs. Haggard "lovely." Mrs. Charmington had receive=
d her own unsigned=20

patent as a recognized beauty from the discriminating admiration of his Roy=
al Highness. The=20

_fiat_ had gone forth, and Julia Charmington had commenced her reign. The C=
harmington boot=20

and the Charmington Bouquet were very freely advertised. A reproduction of =
Mrs. Charmington=20

herself decorated the interior of the omnibuses.  "Why use dangerous cosmet=
ics when Jones'=20

soap retains youth and health for the complexion, and fosters the developme=
nt of beauty?"=20

Underneath the portrait was a facsimile of Mrs. Charmington's fashionable s=
crawl, "I owe you so=20

much, so very much. I have never used any other soap than yours. Very faith=
fully yours, Julia=20

Charmington."  Ill-natured people said that Mrs. Charmington owed a great d=
eal to Messrs. Jones.=20

That the cheque that paid for her well-known turn-out had been signed by th=
e firm; that they had=20

twice paid her dress-maker's bill, when that terrible person had become imp=
ortunate; that they had=20

settled the account of Monsieur Alphonse, the great _coiffeur_; that they h=
ad paid her husband's=20

debts. Some of them, more imaginative, declared that Mrs. Charmington was e=
ven a sleeping=20

partner in the saponaceous firm. But the ill-natured people were quite wron=
g; it was not Messrs.=20

Jones who paid Mrs. Charmington's bills. Little Jack Charmington, her husba=
nd, had a snug four=20

hundred a year of his own, which quite sufficed for his modest needs. Mrs. =
Charmington's graceful=20

letter had been written by her in a moment of good nature, and, it may be s=
aid in confidence, at=20

the instigation, some eight years ago, of Big Reginald Haggard, who had loo=
ked on the whole=20

matter as a joke, and who had, at that stormy period of his career, been ve=
ry much in Mrs.=20

Charmington's confidence. The real  1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclai=

e free distribution of=20

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers inc=

 of volunteers and=20

donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial suppo=
rt to provide volunteers=20

with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm=
's goals and ensuring=20

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for g=

2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to prov=

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Pr=
oject Gutenberg=20

Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporati=

laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Inter=

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the ful=
l extent permitted by=20

U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's principal office=
 is in Fairbanks, Alaska,=20

with the mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its volun=
teers and employees=20

are scattered throughout numerous locations. Its=20


_
Messrs. Jones before the public, and those astute advertisers did the same =
kind office for the lady.=20

Thus it was that Georgie became "lovely Mrs. Haggard." This is what the wri=
ters of serious books=20

pompously call "the _secret history_ of the whole matter."  Georgie now, to=
 her astonishment,=20

found her movements invariably chronicled in the society journals. It rathe=
r annoyed her than=20

otherwise, but her husband was pleased, and that was enough for Georgie.  T=
he lazy giant was=20

sprawling on the most comfortable of the sofas; the pair were alone in the =
dainty little drawing-

room. Young Mrs. Haggard's eyes were full of tears. "Won't you take me with=
 you," she sobbed=20

appealingly, "it's only for six months, Reginald?"  "I can't, my darling; i=
t's a beast of a climate, and=20

the mosquitos would eat you up. I shall only be away for six months; you kn=
ow I have made up my=20

mind to get rid of the whole bag of tricks. It's quite true the land can't =
run away, but there are=20

always rows and revolutions and smashes going on; you can't trust anybody. =
Of course, Georgie, I=20

should like you to go; but think of the risk. It won't wash at all. We'll s=
tay over Christmas here in=20

England. I suppose I must take you down to see the old man, and then we'll =
go straight off to=20

Rome, and finish the winter there. I'm getting rather bored, you know, Geor=
gie, with the fuss=20

people make in town. It's deuced fine fun for you of course."  The fact was=
 that this excellent=20

husband hated playing second fiddle, and he found, to his astonishment, tha=
t young Mrs.=20

Haggard's social success had far eclipsed that of Georgie Warrender. As a g=
ood-looking young=20

bachelor, though a detrimental, he had been very popular. As a wealthy _par=
ti_ and a sort of lion=20

he had been the fashion himself the previous season, and to his own knowled=
ge his curly hair and=20

big moustache had caused a quicker beating of the heart in many a female br=
east. But as=20

Beauty's husband he felt out of his element. "You lucky beggar!" had been r=
epeated to him so=20

often that he hated the phrase. Of course, he still admired his wife as the=
 handsomest woman he=20

had ever clapped eyes upon; he wasn't even jealous of the great attention t=
hat Georgie habitually=20

received. First, because he knew he could trust her implicitly; but secondl=
y, and this was far the=20

more powerful reason, because he was too much a man of the world ever to re=
nder himself=20

ridiculous.  "You know we can have rather a jolly time of it in Rome, Georg=
ie," he said. "You must=20

by this time be as heartily sick of the eternal _tete-a-tete_ as I am. I do=
n't mean that," he said,=20
