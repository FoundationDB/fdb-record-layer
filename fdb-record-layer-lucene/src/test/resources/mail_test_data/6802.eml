Thousands from the larger cities hie themselves to this section, at least o=
nce during the summer,=20

to feast their eyes upon another variety of scenery, to enjoy its peculiar =
attractions, and experience=20

again the pleasure of riding through a valley that appeals alike to the Pul=
lman passenger and to=20

the automobilist; for it is human nature to love a change, even if one's ho=
me environment=20

approaches perfection itself.  There are two important salt water harbors i=
n southwest Washington,=20

the more northerly one in Chehalis county, and named Grays Harbor after the=
 great explorer who=20

discovered it in 1792, and the southern one in "I really don't know," said =
the mendacious Peter.=20

"Was she awfully pretty, too?"  "Again, I really don't know. I never though=
t about her looks ... she=20

had grey hair...."  "Oh!" Mrs. Crosbie exclaimed--a deeply disappointed "Oh=
." "Probably much=20

older, then. That explains the lavender bags."  Silent Thomas Crosbie looke=
d from his wife to=20

Peter with considerable amusement. He realised, if she didn't, that Peter w=
as most successfully=20

putting her off the scent of more than lavender; but men are generally loya=
l to each other in these=20

matters, and he suddenly took his part in the conversation and changed the =
subject.  Among=20

by only a few miles of territory, which is served by no railroad other than=
 a short logging road.=20

Regular traffic is usually around by Centralia, excepting that during the s=
ummer months auto=20

stages traverse the beach from Cohasset to Tokeland; for the beach here is =
level and broad, and=20

the sands packed so firm, when the tide has receded, that it is used as a h=
ighway, and even as a=20

race track for automobiles and motorcycles. This is true not only of the po=
rtion lying between the=20

two harbors but also of the twenty-five miles known as "North Beach" extend=
ing from Willapa Bay=20

to the mouth of the Columbia.  [Illustration: ON THE BANKS OF THE CHEHALIS,=
 LEWIS=20

COUNTY.  Copyright by Asahel Curtis.]  The entire region is fraught with ch=
arms that can be=20

duplicated nowhere else. Pacific, Moclips and Cohasset beaches are patroniz=
ed especially by=20

people from the Sound cities and from southwest Washington. North Beach to =
the south of Willapa=20

Bay attracts as well crowds from Portland and other Oregon cities. On Sunda=
ys or at week ends=20

special excursions are numerous, when great crowds avail themselves of the =
opportunity of=20

visiting the seashore.  [Illustration: POINT GRENVILLE.]  The modes of amus=
ement are=20

numerous. Wading and bathing in the surf or burrowing in the warm sands; hu=
nting for shells,=20

agates, and Indian relics; rowing, and trolling for salmon; or searching fo=
r the rare floral specimens=20

abounding in the neighboring woods occupy the time of many. Others enjoy vi=
siting the canneries,=20

observing the motor races, or watching the sailing vessels, with canvas inf=
lated, gliding quietly into=20

the harbor or, heavily laden, being dragged out across the bar by some fret=
ful yet powerful tug=20

boat. Then there are the clam bakes and, at the end of the day, the big bon=
fires, the beach parties=20

and that nothing the Miss-Sahib had arranged in the bungalow was to be dist=
urbed, and the=20

lavender bag was returned to rejoin its fellows in the cupboard.  It was fo=
ur years since Peter had=20

had any leave, and it appeared that the lavender had the same effect upon h=
im as upon Mrs.=20

Crosbie. He felt homesick--and applied for leave in May.     CHAPTER XII  "=
THE BEST-LAID=20

SCHEMES"   Peter had been as good as his word, and had found a family retur=
ning to India who=20

were glad to take Ayah back to Bombay. And she, though sorry to leave Jan a=
nd the children,=20

acquiesced in all arrangements made for her with the philosophic patience o=
f the East. March was=20

a cold month, and she was often rather miserable, in spite of her pride in =
her shoes and stockings=20

and the warm clothes Jan had provided for her.  Before she left Jan intervi=
ewed her new mistress=20

and found her kind and sensible, and an old campaigner who had made the voy=
age innumerable=20

times.  It certainly occurred to Jan that Peter had been extraordinarily qu=
ick in making this=20

arrangement, but she concluded that he had written on the subject before th=
ey left India. She had=20

no idea that he had sent a long and costly cable on the subject. His friend=
 thought him very=20

solicitous for her comfort, but set it down entirely to her own merits and =
Peter's discriminating good=20

sense.  When the day came Jan took Ayah to her new quarters in a taxi. Of c=
ourse Ayah wept,=20

and Jan felt like weeping herself, as she would like to have kept her on fo=
r the summer months.=20

But she knew it wouldn't do; that apart from the question of expense, Hanna=
h could never=20

overcome her prejudices against "that heathen buddy," and that to have expl=
ained that poor Ayah=20

was a Roman Catholic would only have made matters worse. Hannah was too val=
uable in every=20

way to upset her with=20
