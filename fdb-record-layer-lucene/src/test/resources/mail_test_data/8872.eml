VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT WATERS   1. There are, however, some hot springs 

that supply water of the best taste, which is so delightful to drink that one does not think with regret 

of the Fountain of the Muses or the Marcian aqueduct. These hot springs are produced naturally, 

in the of his hand, but does not remember any household of the surname of Gnekker. I question 

him about the estate--the same answer.  The clock in the corridor strikes one, then two, then 

three.... These last months in which I am waiting for death seem much longer than the whole of my 

life. And I have

kindled down beneath in alum or asphalt or sulphur, it makes the earth immediately over it very 

hot, and emits a glowing heat to the parts still farther above it, so that if there are any springs of 

sweet water found in the upper strata, they begin to boil in their fissures when they are met by this 

heat, and so they run out with their taste unimpaired.  2. And there are some cold springs that 

have a bad smell and taste. They rise deep down in the lower strata, cross places which are on 

fire, and then are cooled by running a long distance through the earth, coming out above ground 

with their taste, smell, and colour spoiled; as, for instance, the river Albula on the road to Tivoli and 

the cold springs of Ardea, which have the same smell and are called sulphur springs, and others in 

similar places. Although they are cold, yet at to the slowness of time as now. In the old days, when 

one sat in the station and waited for a train, or presided in an examination-room, a quarter of an 

hour would seem an eternity. Now I can sit all night on my bed without moving, and quite 

unconcernedly reflect that tomorrow will be followed by another night as long and colourless, and 

the day after tomorrow.  In the corridor it strikes five, six, seven.... It grows dark.  There is a dull 

pain in my cheek, the tic beginning. To occupy myself with thoughts, I go back to my old point of 

view, when I was not so indifferent, and ask myself why I, a distinguished man, a privy councillor, 

am sitting in this little hotel room, on this bed with the unfamiliar grey quilt. Why am I looking at 

that cheap tin washing-stand and listening to the whirr of the wretched clock in the corridor?

they seem to be hot for the reason that when they happen upon a burning spot deep down below, 

the liquid and the fire meet, and with a great noise at the collision they take in strong currents of 

air, and thus, swollen by a quantity of compressed wind, they come out at the springs in a constant 

state of ebullition. When such springs are not open but confined by rocks, the force of the air in 

them drives them up through the this in keeping with my fame and my lofty position? And I answer 

these questions with a jeer. I am amused by the naivete with which I used in my youth to 

exaggerate the value of renown and of the exceptional position which celebrities are supposed to 

enjoy. I am famous, my name is pronounced with reverence, my portrait has been both in the 

_Niva_ and in the _Illustrated News of the World_; I have read my biography even in a
