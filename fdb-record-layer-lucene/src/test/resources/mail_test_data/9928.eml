fruit of his long researches in Egyptology and other ancient lore, as it sh=
ows that the septenary=20

division was at one time a universal doctrine:       Adam as the father amo=
ng the Seven is identical=20

with the Egyptian     Atum, ... whose other name of Adon is identical with =
the Hebrew     Adonai. In=20

this way the second Creation in _Genesis_ reflects and     continues the la=
ter creation in the=20

mythos which explains it. The     Fall of Adam to the lower world led to hi=
s being humanised on=20

earth, by which process the celestial was turned into the mortal,     and t=
his, which belongs to the=20

astronomical allegory, got     literalised as the Fall of Man, or descent o=
f the soul into     matter,=20

and the conversion of the angelic into an earthly     being.... It is found=
 in the [Babylonian] texts,=20

when Ea, the     first father, is said to "grant forgiveness to the conspir=
ing     gods," for whose=20

"redemption did he create mankind." (Sayce; _Hib.     Lec._, p. 140) ... Th=
e Elohim, then, are the=20

Egyptian, Akkadian,     Hebrew, and Phoenician form of the Universal Seven =
Powers, who are=20

Seven in Egypt, Seven in Akkad, Babylon, Persia, India, Britain,     and Se=
ven among the Gnostics=20

and Kabalists. They were the Seven     fathers who preceded the Father in H=
eaven, because they=20

were     earlier than the individualised fatherhood on earth.... When the  =
   Elohim said: "Let us=20

make man in our image, after our likeness,"     there were seven of them wh=
o represented the=20

seven elements,     powers, or souls that went  "My dear Monsieur de Rochef=
ort," Mazarin replied=20

in a tone of raillery, "you think yourself still a young man; your spirit i=
s that of the phoenix, but your=20

strength fails you. Believe me, you ought now to take a rest. Here!"  "You =
decide, then, nothing=20

about me, my lord?"  "On the contrary, I have come to a decision."  Bernoui=
n came into the room.=20

"Call an officer of justice," he said; "and stay close to me," he added, in=
 a low tone.  The officer=20

entered. Mazarin wrote a few words, which he gave to this man; then he bowe=
d.  "Adieu, Monsieur=20

de Rochefort," he said.  Rochefort bent low.  "I see, my lord, I am to be t=
aken back to the Bastile."=20

"You are sagacious."  "I shall return thither, my lord, but it is a mistake=
 on your part not to employ=20

me."  "You? the friend of my greatest foes? Don't suppose that you are the =
only person who can=20

serve me, Monsieur de Rochefort. I shall find many men as able as you are."=
  "I wish you may, my=20

lord," replied De Rochefort.  He was then reconducted by the little stairca=
se, instead of passing=20

through the ante-chamber where D'Artagnan was waiting. In the courtyard the=
 carriage and the=20

four musketeers were ready, but he looked around in vain for his friend.  "=
Ah!" he muttered to=20

himself, "this changes the situation, and if there is still a crowd of peop=
le in the streets we will try to=20

show Mazarin that we are still, thank God, good for something else than kee=
ping guard over a=20

prisoner;" and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of fi=
ve-and-twenty.=20


_
came into existence before the Creator was represented     anthropomorphica=
lly, or could have=20

conferred the human likeness on     the Adamic man. It was in the sevenfold=
 image of the Elohim=20

that     man was first created, with his seven elements, principles or     =
souls,(375) and therefore=20

he could not have been formed in the     image of the one God. The seven Gn=
ostic Elohim tried to=20

make a man     in their own image, but could not for lack of virile power.(=
376)     Thus their creation=20

in earth and heaven was a failure ... because     they themselves were lack=
ing in the soul of the=20

fatherhood! When     the Gnostic Ildabaoth,(377) chief of the Seven, cried:=
 "I am the     father and=20

God," his mother Sophia [Achamoth] replied: "Do not     tell lies, Ildabaot=
h, for the first man=20

(Anthropos, son of     Anthropos)(378) is above thee." That is, man who had=
 now been     created=20

in the image of the fatherhood was superior to the gods     who were derive=
d from the Mother-

Parent alone!(379) For, as it had     been first on earth, so was it afterw=
ards in heaven [the Secret=20

Doctrine teaches the reverse]; and thus the primary gods were held     to b=
e soulless like the=20

earliest races of men.... The Gnostics     taught that the Spirits of Wicke=
dness, the inferior Seven,=20

derived     their origin from the great Mother alone, who produced without =
the     fatherhood! It was=20

in the image, then, of the sevenfold Elohim     that the seven races were f=
ormed which we=20

sometimes hear of as the     Pre-Adamite races of men, because they were ea=
rlier than the=20

fatherhood, which was individualised only in the second Hebrew     Creation=
.(380)   This shows=20

sufficiently how the echo of the Secret Doctrine--of the Third and Fourth R=
aces of men, made=20

complete by the incarnation in humanity of the Manasa Putra, Sons of Intell=
igence or Wisdom--

reached every corner of the globe. The Jews, however, although they borrowe=
d of the older=20

nations the groundwork on which to build their revelation, never had more t=
han three keys out of=20

the seven in their mind, while composing their national allegories--the ast=
ronomical, the numerical=20

(metrology), and above all the purely anthropological, or rather physiologi=
cal key. This resulted in=20

the most phallic religion of all, and has now passed, part and parcel, into=
 Christian theology, as is=20

proved by the lengthy quotations made from a lecture of an able Egyptologis=
t, who can make=20

naught of it save astronomical myths and phallicism, as is implied by his e=
xplanations of=20

"fatherhood" in the allegories.      SECTION XXII. THE "ZOHAR" ON CREATION =
AND THE=20

ELOHIM.   The opening sentence in _Genesis_, as every Hebrew scholar knows,=
 is:  {~HEBREW=20

 was for=20

some minutes lost in thought. He had gained much information, but not enoug=
h. Mazarin was a=20

cheat at the card-table. This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne. He ca=
lled it using his=20

advantages. He now determined not to begin the game with D'Artagnan till he=
 knew completely all=20

his adversary's cards.  "My lord, have you any commands?" asked Bernouin.  =
"Yes, yes," replied=20

Mazarin. "Light me; I am going to the queen."  Bernouin took up a candlesti=
ck and led the way.=20

There was a secret communication between the cardinal's apartments and thos=
e of the queen;=20

and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne =
of Austria.      _*This=20

secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal._  In the bedroom in=
 which this passage=20



ended, Bernouin encountered Madame de Beauvais, like himself intrusted with=
 the secret of these=20

subterranean love affairs; and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare Anne=
 of Austria, who=20

was in her oratory with the young king, Louis XIV., to receive the cardinal=
.  Anne, reclining in a=20

large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand, her elbow resting on a ta=
ble, was looking at her=20

son, who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures. =
This celebrated woman=20

fully understood the art of being dull with dignity. It was her practice to=
 pass hours either in her=20

oratory or in her room, without either reading or praying.  When Madame de =
Beauvais appeared at=20

the door and announced the cardinal, the child, who had been absorbed in th=
e pages of Quintus=20

Curtius, enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander's feats of arms,=
 frowned and looked at=20

his mother.  "Why," he said, "does he enter without first asking for an aud=
ience?"  Anne colored=20

slightly.  "The prime minister," she said, "is obliged in these unsettled d=
ays to inform the queen of=20

all that is happening from time to time, without exciting the curiosity or =
remarks of the court."  "But=20

Richelieu never came in this manner," said the pertinacious boy.  "How can =
you remember what=20

Monsieur de Richelieu did? You were too young to know about such things."  =
"I do not remember=20

what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told all about it."  "And =
who told you about it?"=20

asked Anne of Austria, with a movement of impatience.  "I know that I ought=
 never to name the=20

persons who answer my questions," answered the child, "for if I do I shall =
learn nothing further."=20

At this very moment Mazarin entered. The king rose immediately, took his bo=
ok, closed it and went=20

to lay it down on the table, near which he continued standing, in order tha=
t Mazarin might be=20

obliged to stand also.  Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoug=
htful glance. They=20

explained what had occurred that evening.  He bowed respectfully to the kin=
g, who gave him a=20

somewhat cavalier reception, but a look from his mother reproved him for th=
e hatred which, from=20

his infancy, Louis XIV. had entertained toward Mazarin, and he endeavored t=
o receive the=20

minister's homage with civility.  Anne of=20


_
Now there are two well-known ways of rendering this line, as any other Hebr=
ew writing: one=20

exoteric, as read by the orthodox _Bible_ interpreters (Christian), and the=
 other Kabalistic, the=20

latter, moreover, being divided into the Rabbinical and the purely Kabalist=
ic or Occult method. As=20

in Sanskrit writing, the words are not separated in the Hebrew, but are une=
xpected visit, since the=20

cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired.  T=
he minister made a=20

slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais:  "I=
t is time for the king=20

to go to bed; call Laporte."  The queen had several times already told her =
son that he ought to go=20

to bed, and several times Louis had=20


_
to run together--especially in the old systems. For instance, the above, di=
vided, would read:=20

"_B'rashith bara Elohim eth hashamayim v'eth h'areths_;" and it can be made=
 to read thus:=20

"_B'rash ithbara Elohim ethhashamayim v'eth'arets_," thus changing the mean=
ing entirely. The=20

latter means, "In the beginning _God made the heavens_ and the earth," wher=
eas the former,=20

precluding the idea of any beginning, would simply read that "out of the ev=
er-existing Essence=20

[divine] [or out of the _womb_--also head--thereof] the dual [or androgyne]=
 Force [Gods] shaped=20

the double heaven;" the upper and the lower heaven being generally explaine=
d as heaven and=20

earth. The latter word means Esoterically the "Vehicle," as was; but now he=
 made no reply, but=20

turned pale and bit his lips with anger.  In a few minutes Laporte came int=
o the room. The child=20

went directly to him without kissing his mother.  "Well, Louis," said Anne,=
 "why do you not kiss=20

me?"  "I thought you were angry with me, madame; you sent me away."  "I do =
not send you away,=20

but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tir=
e you."  "You had no=20

fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to-day to p=
ass the odious=20

decrees which have raised the people to rebellion."  "Sire!" interposed Lap=
orte, in order to turn the=20

subject, "to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle?"  "To any o=
ne, Laporte," the=20

child=20
