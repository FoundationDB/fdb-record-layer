=9D said the general; =E2=80=9Cno one could be trusted but herself=E2=80=94=
no other _
ornaments for the female islanders. Upon examining the sword-guard minutely=
, captain Dillon=20

discovered, or thought he discovered, the initials of Perouse stamped upon =
it, which circumstance=20

prompted him to be more eager in his inquiries.  The Prussian said he had h=
imself never made a=20

trip to Manicolo with the Tucopians, but the Lascar had gone once or twice.=
 He positively affirmed,=20

that he had seen and conversed at Paiow, a native town, with the Europeans =
who spoke the=20

language of the islanders. They were old men, he said, who told him that th=
ey had been wrecked=20

several years ago in one of the ships, the remnants of which they pointed o=
ut to him. They=20

informed him also that no vessel had touched at the islands since they had =
been there; that most=20

of their comrades were dead, but they had been so scattered among the vario=
us islands, that they=20

could not tell precisely how many of them were still living.  On hearing so=
 many circumstances all=20

tending to confirm his suspicions, from the moment he saw the silver the ca=
mp. Several of the=20

men he recognized by name; to all of them he addressed some inspiring word;=
 a memory of=20

combats in which they had fought together, or happy allusions to adventures=
 if romantic peril;=20

some question which indicated that local knowledge which is magical for tho=
se who are away from=20

home; mixed with all this, sharp, clear inquiries as to the business of the=
 hour, which proved the=20

master of detail, severe in discipline, but never deficient in sympathy for=
 his troops.  After sunset,=20

enveloped in their cloaks, the general and his companions, the party increa=
sed by the officers who=20

had been in command previous to his arrival, smoked their cigars round the =
camp-fire.  =E2=80=9CWell,=20

Sarano,=E2=80=9D said the general, =E2=80=9CI will look over your muster-ro=
ll to-morrow, but I should suppose I may=20

count on a thousand rifles or so. I want three, and we shall get them. The =
great man would have=20

supplied them me at once, but I will not have boys. He must send those on t=
o Menotti. I told him: =E2=80=98I=20

am not a man of genius; I=20

Dillon determined to proceed as quickly as possible to the Manicolo Islands=
, examine the wrecks=20

himself, and, if practicable, bring off the two men with whom the Lascar ha=
d spoken, and whom,=20

he said, were Frenchmen. For this purpose he begged the latter to accompany=
 him, but as he was=20

married and comfortably settled on the island, neither promises nor threats=
 were of any avail,=20

although captain Dillon offered to bring him back to Tucopia. Martin Buchar=
t, on the contrary, was=20

tired of the savage life he had led for the last fourteen years, and gladly=
 acceded to the wishes of=20

captain Dillon, who after prevailing with a Tucopian also to come on board,=
 sailed for the island.=20

Unfortunately, as the ship neared the land, it fell conquer kingdoms with b=
oys. Give me old=20

soldiers, men who have served a couple of campaigns, and been seasoned with=
 four-and-twenty=20

months of camp-life, and I will not disgrace you or myself.=E2=80=99=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWe have had no news from the other=20

place for a long time,=E2=80=9D said Sarano. =E2=80=9CHow is it?=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CWell enough. They are in the mountains about=20

Nerola, in a position not very unlike this; numerically strong, for Nicoter=
a has joined them, and=20

Ghirelli with the Roman Legion is at hand. They must be quiet till the grea=
t man joins them; I am=20

told they are restless. There has been too much noise about the whole busin=
ess. Had they been=20

as mum as you have been, we should not have had all these representations f=
rom France and=20

these threatened=20


_
time the stock of dry provisions was nearly exhausted, and there was no ani=
mal food to be=20

procured on Tucopia. The crew lived principally on New Zealand potatoes and=
 bananas. The=20

vessel became every day more leaky from a long continuance at sea; and a pe=
rson on board, who=20

was interested in the cargo, had, during captain Dillon's stay in the islan=
ds, shown himself=20

particularly discontented, and had frequently and warmly remonstrated at wh=
at he considered an=20

unnecessary and useless delay; for these reasons, therefore, captain Dillon=
 determined, though=20

with the greatest reluctance, to take advantage of a breeze which sprang co=
mplained and=20

remonstrated, and Rattazzi could have conscientiously assured the people at=
 Paris that they were=20

dealing with exaggerations and bugbears; the very existence of the frontier=
 force would have=20

become a controversy, and, while the newspapers were proving it was a myth,=
 we should have=20

been in the Vatican.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd when shall we be there, general=
?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not want to move for a month.=20

By that time I shall have two thousand five hundred or three thousand of my=
 old comrades, and=20

the great man will have put his boys in trim. Both bodies must leave their =
mountains at the same=20

time, join in the open country, and march to=20

arrived at Bengal with much difficulty, his ship being in a very leaky cond=
ition.  Unwilling to=20

abandon his favourite object, captain Dillon now applied to the Asiatic Soc=
iety, and to the Bengal=20

Government; and in consequence of his representations, his suggestions were=
 at length carried=20

into effect. He was appointed to the command of one of the Company's cruise=
rs, of sixteen guns=20

and eighty-five men, called the Research; and on the 27th of January, 1827,=
 he sailed from=20

Bengal, visited Van Dieman's Land, New South Wales, New Zealand, the Friend=
ly Islands, Ro-

Thoma, or Granville Island of the Pandora, Tucopia, and arrived at Manicolo=
 on the 27th of=20

September. This island (Manicolo, or Vanicolo) is not the Mallicolo of capt=
ain Rome.=E2=80=9D  As the night=20

advanced, several of the party rose and left the camp-fire=E2=80=94some to =
their tents, some to their=20

duties. Two of the staff remained with the general.  =E2=80=9CI am disappoi=
nted and uneasy that we have=20

not heard from Paris,=E2=80=9D said one of them.  =E2=80=9CI am disappointe=
d,=E2=80=9D said the general, =E2=80=9Cbut not uneasy;=20

she never makes a mistake.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe risk was too great,=E2=80=
=9D rejoined the speaker in a depressed tone.=20

=E2=80=9CI do not see that,=E2=80=9D said the general. =E2=80=9CWhat is the=
 risk? Who could possibly suspect the lady=E2=80=99s maid=20

of the Princess of Tivoli! I am told that the princess has become quite a f=
avorite at the Tuileries.=E2=80=9D=20

 nevertheless, I confess I should=20

sited the reefs on which=20

the French ships are ascertained to have struck and gone to pieces, accordi=
ng to the accounts of=20

the natives, from which the following particulars have been obtained of tha=
