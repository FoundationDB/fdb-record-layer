"It was an old one without much value," Mrs. Jones admitted. "I liked it though, on account of the 

pretty jet buttons."  At mention of jet buttons, Dan shot Mr. Hatfield a quick glance. He saw that the 

Cub leader likewise was startled by the possibility which presented itself.  "What kind of buttons, 

were they?" the boy asked.  "Just tiny jet buttons, diamond in shape."  "If we find the boy, we'll 

send him home," Mr. Hatfield said hastily.  He was afraid that Dan or one of the other Cubs might 

say something which would further disturb the widow.  Herding the boys together, he led I 

remember one funny story about himself that made grandmother, who was working her bread on 

the bread-board, laugh until she wiped her eyes with her bare arm, her hands being floury. It was 

like this:--  When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look 

after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman 

started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. 

Fuchs said he "got on fine with the kids," and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on 

him. In

hearing of the widow, they all had plenty to say.  "Jack swiped our biscuits all right!" Red said 

indignantly. "We're saps to let him get by with it too!"  "We ought to have him sent back to the 

Child Study Institute!" added Midge. "Who does that kid think he is? We ought to clip his comb!" 

Mr. Hatfield had not given much thought to the stolen food. However, he was gravely troubled by 

Mrs. Jones' reference to the jet buttons.  "Do you suppose Jack was the one who came to your 

house that morning?" Dan asked, falling into step with the Cub leader.  "Naturally, it raises a 

question in one's mind, Dan. But for the life of me, I can't understand how he would know about 

the tin three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was traveling 

with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. 

The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in 

Otto, and often inquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New 

York, he had, as he said, "to carry some of them." The trip to Chicago was even worse than the 

ocean voyage. On the train it was very difficult to get milk for the babies and to keep their bottles 

clean. The mother did her best, but no woman, out of her natural resources, could feed three 

babies. The
