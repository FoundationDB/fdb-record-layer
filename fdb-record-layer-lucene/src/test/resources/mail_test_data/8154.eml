 but a single recorded=20

instance. J. Picus       de Mirandola, finding that there was more Christia=
nity than Judaism       in=20

the _Kabalah_, and discovering in it the doctrines of the       Trinity, th=
e Incarnation, the Divinity of=20

Jesus, etc., wound up his       proofs of this with a challenge to the worl=
d at large from Rome. As=20

Ginsburg shows: "In 1486, when only twenty-four years old, he       [Picus]=
 published nine hundred=20

[Kabalistic] _theses_, which were       placarded in Rome, and undertook to=
 defend them in the=20

presence of       all European scholars whom he invited to the Eternal City=
, promising       to defray=20

their travelling expenses."    316 This account is summarised from Isaac My=
er's _Qabbalah_, p.=20

10, _et       seq._    317 There is not in the decalogue one idea that is n=
ot the counterpart,       or=20

the paraphrase, of the dogmas and ethics current among the       Egyptians =
long before the time of=20

Moses and Aaron. (The Mosaic Law a       transcript from Egyptian Sources; =
vide _Geometry in=20

Religion_,       1890.)    318 _Book of God._ Kenealy, p. 383. The referenc=
e to Klaproth is also=20

from this page.    319 See _Asiat. Jour._, N.S. vii., p. 275, quoted by Ken=
ealy.    320 _Book of=20

"Now, Athos!" said D'Artagnan, "do you begin to believe that it's a ruined =
cause, and that what with=20

your Harrisons, Joyces, Bridges and Cromwells, we shall never get the upper=
 hand?"  "The king=20

will be delivered at the tribunal," said Athos; "the very silence of his su=
pporters indicates that they=20

are at work."  D'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders.  "But," said Aramis, "if =
they dare to condemn=20

their king, it can only be to exile or imprisonment."  D'Artagnan whistled =
a little air of incredulity.=20

"We shall see," said Athos, "for we shall go to the sittings, I presume."  =
"You will not have long to=20

wait," said the landlord; "they begin to-morrow."  "So, then, they drew up =
the indictments before=20

the king was taken?"  "Of course," said D'Artagnan; "they began the day he =
was sold."  "And you=20

know," said Aramis, "that it was our friend Mordaunt who made, if not the b=
argain, at least the=20

overtures."  "And you know," added D'Artagnan, "that whenever I catch him I=
 will kill him, this=20

Mordaunt."  "And I, too," exclaimed Porthos.  "And I, too," added Aramis.  =
"Touching unanimity!"=20

cried D'Artagnan, "which well becomes good citizens like us. Let us take a =
turn around the town=20

and imbibe a little fog."  "Yes," said Porthos, "'twill be at least a littl=
e change from beer."     63. The=20

Trial.   The next morning King Charles I. was haled by a strong guard befor=
e the high court which=20

was to judge=20


_
323 See _Book of God_, p. 385. "Care should be taken," says Butler       (q=
uoted by Kenealy, p.=20

489), "to distinguish between the Pentateuch       in the Hebrew language b=
ut in the letters of the=20

Samaritan alphabet,       and the version of the Pentateuch in the Samarita=
n language. One of=20

the most important differences between the Samaritan and the Hebrew       t=
ext respects the=20

duration of the period between the deluge and the       birth of Abraham. T=
he Samaritan text=20

makes it longer by some       centuries than the Hebrew text; and the Septu=
agint makes it longer=20

by some centuries than the Samaritan." It is observable that in the       a=
uthentic translation of the=20

Latin Vulgate, the Roman Church follows       the computation expressed in =
the Hebrew text; and=20

in her Martyrology       follows that of the Seventy, both texts being insp=
ired, as she       claims.=20

324 See Rev. Joseph Wolff's _Journal_, p. 200.    325 A tree is symbolicall=
y a book--as "pillar" is=20

another synonym of the       same.    326 The wife of Moses, one of the sev=
en daughters of a=20

Midian priest, is       called Zipora. It was Jethro, the priest of Midian,=
 who initiated       Moses,=20

Zipora, one of the seven daughters, being simply one of the       seven Occ=
ult powers that the=20

Hierophant was and is supposed to pass       to the initiated novice.    32=
7 See for these details the=20

_Book of God_, pp. 244, 250.    328 _Op. cit._ v. 85.    329 As is fully sh=
own in the _Source of=20

Measures_ and other works.    330 Surely even Masons would never claim the =
_actual_ existence=20

of       Solomon? As Kenealy shows, of the house. The throng was terrific, =
and it was not till after=20

much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination. =
When they did so they=20

found the three lower rows of benches already occupied; but being anxious n=
ot to be too=20

conspicuous, all, with the exception of Porthos, who had a fancy to display=
 his red doublet, were=20

quite satisfied with their places, the more so as chance had brought them t=
o the centre of their=20

row, so that they were exactly opposite the arm-chair prepared for the roya=
l prisoner.  Toward=20

eleven o'clock the king entered the hall, surrounded by guards, but wearing=
 his head covered, and=20

with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assuran=
ce, as if he were there=20

to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects, rather than to meet the a=
ccusations of a rebel=20

court.  The judges, proud of having a monarch to humiliate, evidently prepa=
red to enjoy the right=20

they had arrogated to themselves, and sent an officer to inform the king th=
at it was customary for=20

the accused to uncover his head.  Charles, without replying a single word, =
turned his head in=20

another direction and pulled his felt hat over it. Then when the officer wa=
s gone he sat down in the=20

arm-chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane wh=
ich he carried in his=20

hand. Parry, who accompanied him, stood behind him.  D'Artagnan was looking=
 at Athos, whose=20

face betrayed all those emotions which the king, possessing more self-contr=
ol, had banished from=20

his own. This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos, frightened him.  =
"I hope," he whispered=20


_
Plato, nor by any writer of standing. It is most extraordinary, he       sa=
ys, "that the Jewish nation,=20

over whom but a few years before the       mighty Solomon had reigned in al=
l his glory, with a=20

magnificence       scarcely equalled by the greatest monarchs, spending nea=
rly _eight       example=20

and not get killed for your folly in this den."  "Set your mind at rest," r=
eplied Athos.  "Aha!"=20

continued D'Artagnan, "it is clear that they are afraid of something or oth=
er; for look, the sentinels=20

are being reinforced. They had only halberds before, now they have muskets.=

 on the other--visiting=20

both places, and of course passing       almost necessarily within a few mi=
les of the splendid=20

capital of the       national Jerusalem? How can this be accounted for?" he=
 asks (p.       457). Nay,=20

not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of       Israel having ev=
er existed, but Herodotus,=20

the most accurate of       historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flouris=
hed, never mentions=20

the Israelites at all; and Herodotus was born in 484 B.C. How is       this=
?    331 Clement,=20

ould proceed to the=20

audience in the rear; the muskets are for us."  "Thirty, forty, fifty, sixt=
y-five men," said Porthos,=20

counting the reinforcements.  "Ah!" said Aramis, "but you forget the office=
r."  D'Artagnan grew pale=20

with rage. He recognized Mordaunt, who with bare sword was marshalling the =
musketeers behind=20

the king and opposite the benches.  "Do you think they have recognized us?"=
 said D'Artagnan. "In=20

that case I should beat a retreat. I don't care to be shot in a box."  "No,=
" said Aramis, "he has not=20

seen us. He sees no one but the king. Mon Dieu! how he stares at him, the i=
nsolent dog! Does he=20

hate his majesty as much as he does us?"  "Pardi," answered Athos "we only =
carried off his=20

mother; the king has spoiled him of his name and property."  "True," said A=
ramis; "but silence! the=20
