In thee a friend through good and ill;     And truth that naught could take away:       Ah, this the 

poor man lacketh still.                       (28)  Go then, and after performing rites of purification, I will

SHARVILAKA   [_Enter a maid._]  _Maid._  I am entrusted with a message for my mistress by her 

mother. Here is my mistress. She is gazing at a picture and is talking with Madanika. I will go to 

her. [_She walks about. Then enter Vasantasena as described, and Madanika._]  _Vasantasena._ 

Madanika girl, is this portrait really like Charudatta?  _Madanika._ Very like.  _Vasantasena._ How 

do you know?  _Madanika._ Because my mistress' eyes are fastened so lovingly upon it. 

_Vasantasena._ Madanika girl, do you say this because courtezan courtesy demands it? 

_Madanika._ But mistress, is the courtesy of a girl who lives in a courtezan's house, necessarily 

false?  _Vasantasena._ Girl, courtezans meet so many kinds of men that they do learn a false 

courtesy.  _Madanika._ But when the eyes of my mistress find such delight in a thing, and her 

heart too, what need is there to ask the reason?  _Vasantasena._ But I should not like to have my 

friends laugh at me.  _Madanika._ You need not be afraid. Women understand women.  _Maid._ 

D'Aubigne, as its author, the characterisation of Sainte-Beuve exactly applies: "Juvenal du xvi. 

siecle, apre, austere, inexorable, herisse d'hyperboles, etincelant de beautes, rachetant une 

rudesse grossiere par une sublime energie." In seven books it tells of the misery of France, the 

treachery of princes, the abuse of public law and justice, the fires and chains of religious 

persecution, the vengeance of God against the enemies of the saints, and the final judgment of 

sinners, when air and fire and water become the accusers of those who have perverted the 

powers of nature to purposes of cruelty. The poem is ill composed, its rhetoric is often strained or 

hard and metallic, its unrelieved horrors oppress the heart; but the cry of true passion is heard in 

its finer pages; from amid the turmoil and smoke, living tongues of flame seem to dart forth which 

illuminate the gloom. The influence of _Les Tragiques_ may still be felt in passages of Victor 

Hugo's fulgurant eloquence.  In the midst of strife, however, there were men who pursued the 

disinterested service of humanity and whose work made for peace. The great surgeon Ambroise 

Pare, full of tolerance and deeply pious, advanced his healing art on the battle-field or amid the 

ravages of pestilence, and left a large contribution to the literature of science. Bernard Palissy, a 

devout Huguenot, was not only the inventor of "rustic figulines," the designer of enamelled cups 

and platters, but a true student of nature, who would substitute the faithful observation of 

phenomena for vain and ambitious theory. Olivier de Serres, another disciple of Calvin, cultivated 

his fields, helped to enrich France by supporting Henri IV. in the introduction of the industry in silk, 

and amassed his knowledge and experience in his admirably-written _Theatre d'Agriculture_. At a

is it Charudatta who invites me?  _Maid._ Mistress, the man who sent ornaments worth ten 

thousand gold-pieces with the cart--  [58.6. S.  _Vasantasena._ Is who?  _Maid._ Is the king's 

brother-in-law, Sansthanaka.  _Vasantasena._ [_Indignantly._] Go! and never come again on such

Montchrestien, adventurous and turbulent in his Protestant zeal, the writer of tragedies which 

connect the sixteenth century with the classical school of later years, became the advocate of a 

protectionist and a colonial policy in his _Traicte de l'OEconomie Politique_; the style of his essay 

towards economic reform has some of the passion and enthusiasm of a poet.  A refuge from the 

troubles and vicissitudes of the time was sought by some in a Christianised Stoicism. Guillaume 

du Vair (1556-1621), eminent as a magistrate, did not desert his post
