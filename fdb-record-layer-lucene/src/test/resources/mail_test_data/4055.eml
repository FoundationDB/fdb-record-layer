 therefore, necessitate=20

the existence of compression or visible injury of the brain. Concussion may=
 sometimes be due to a=20

violent fall upon the feet, in which case the shock is transmitted through =
the spinal column to the=20

head with or without fracture of the base of the skull. It was in this way =
that the Duke of Orleans,=20

there is generally some laceration of the brain, the injured person falls a=

apparently unconscious, though often he can be partly roused. Paralysis and=
 an=C3=A6sthesia are=20

absent. The heart is feeble and fluttering, the skin cold and clammy. The p=
upils, as a rule, react to=20

light, but otherwise vary considerably. Urine and f=C3=A6ces may be passed =
involuntarily. As he begins=20

to regain consciousness, vomiting usually occurs. Consciousness usually ret=
urns within twenty-

four or forty-eight hours, when headache and indisposition to exertion are =
complained of, and this=20

may last for a long time. Occasionally the symptoms instead of abating incr=
ease, and coma=20

supervenes, often indicating meningitis, encephalitis, or intracranial hemo=
rrhage. In other cases=20

recovery takes place and death occurs later either suddenly or after a reap=
pearance of symptoms.=20

ound fracture to a slight=20

contusion not leaving any scar. The abscess may occur within a week[661] or=
 not until after=20

months or years. This interval of apparent recovery may lead to the false s=
upposition that death=20

was not due to the injury, but to some intervening cause. It is well to bea=
r in mind that about half of=20

the cases of abscess of the brain are not traumatic. A large majority of th=
ese are due to=20

suppuration in the middle ear, a few to septic diseases or tuberculosis. Th=
e situation of the=20

abscess often distinguishes between the traumatic and non-traumatic varieti=
es. The traumatic=20

variety is usually found beneath the injury or sometimes directly opposite,=
 where the brain is=20

injured by a kind of focussing of the radiated effects of the blow. The cas=
es of abscess of the brain=20

due to ear disease are usually found in the temporal lobe of the brain lyin=
g over the position of the=20

ear or in the cerebellum behind it. The uncertainty of the nature and the e=
xtent of the cerebral=20

injury in so-called contusion of the brain renders it necessary to be very =
careful in giving a=20

_prognosis_. Any injury should be considered serious which has produced unc=
onsciousness, for=20

such an injury may produce enough laceration of the brain to render serious=
 danger=20
