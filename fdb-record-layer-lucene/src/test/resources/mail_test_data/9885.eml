LOVER.  (DRAWN FROM LIFE.)  _(For the Mirror.)_     "That man that hath a t=
ongue, I say, is no=20

man,   If with his tongue he cannot win a woman."   John Laconi was born in=
 the romantic country=20

of Switzerland. He was educated tolerably well; he was a good musician, and=
 could draw=20

excellently. He possessed a small, though independent fortune. However, not=
withstanding his=20

advantages and acquirements, he proved, when he became a lover, to be an id=
iot.  At a certain=20

period of his life, he fell violently in love with a beautiful young Swiss =
lady. She was considerably=20

younger than our hero, was much taller, and her elegant refinements rendere=
d her a very=20

desirable object. John had a sister, to whom the young lady paid frequent f=
riendly visits, and upon=20

a tradition. At present=20

y republican and are=20

scattered about the provinces, are all revived, and are astir. Mary-Anne, a=
s you know, was the red=20

name for the republic years ago, and there always was a sort of myth that t=
hese societies had=20

been founded by a woman. Of course that is all nonsense, but they keep it u=

imagination, and my government has undoubted evidence that the word of comm=

advantage of the general indignation, your new kingdom of Italy may seize t=

of making a popular reputation, and declare herself the champion of nationa=

ground.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf Rome falls,=20
