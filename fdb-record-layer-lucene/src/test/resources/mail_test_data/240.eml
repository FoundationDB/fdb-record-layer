Lest the dracaena marginata for the Indians and that such persons shall be conscientious and diligent men and shall be paid out of the fines of the Exchequer."  Neither the spirit nor the provisions of      Wail thy sorrows only to the wine before thee gleaming bright.      But when thrice thou st drained the beaker watch and ward          keep o'er thy heart.      Lest the _
appearance and manners that, wishing in some way to honour him and having nothing at hand to 

give him, he took off his own red velvet hat and placed it on the cacique's head.  His followers 

murmured somewhat at this demonstration, which they considered excessive, but Don Juan was 

radiant in his magnificent headgear.  To celebrate Don Juan's visit, an inspection of the town was 

planned, so that he might see how the Spaniards lived; the Bishop and the Aldelantado sent word 

beforehand to all the merchants to dress their shops with the best things they had, stuffs, jewelry, 

plate, etc., and if the cacique should show a fancy for anything, it should immediately be given to 

him and the account sent to the Bishop.  This was doing things in a really royal fashion, and one 

regrets to have to relate that the cacique walked with great gravity and dignity--as much as though 

he had been born in Burgos, says Remesal--amidst the brave display, without manifesting any 

surprise or wish to possess anything he saw, refusing also to accept the different articles which 

were offered to him.  The only object about which he seems to have asked a question was a 

statue of the Blessed Virgin, and when he heard the Bishop repeat the story of the Mother of 

Christ, just as the friars had first sung it in his mountain home, he knelt down to receive the image 

from his hands, with great veneration, and afterwards delivered it to one of his attendants, 

cautioning him to carry it with the greatest care and reverence.  The visit fortunately passed off 

without any friction between the Spaniards and the followers of Don Juan, and at its close, Las 

Casas and Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada accompanied the cacique back to his country, intending to 

penetrate still farther into the interior of Coban where the natives were but little known to white 

men.  Two caciques, whose names as Christians were Don Miguel and Don Pedro and whose 

tribes were near to Rabinal, rendered much help in carrying out this plan, and so well did 

everything promise, that the two friars would have remained in the countries of Tuzulatlan and 

Coban to prosecute their missionary labours, but for a summons from their companions in 

Guatemala recalling them thither in May of 1538.  The Bishop Marroquin, who had prompted the 

summons, assembled the community and explained that the urgent need of more clergy in his 

diocese had decided him to send some of them to Spain to induce other friars of their own and the 

Franciscan Order to come to his assistance.  The choice of the envoy for this mission not 

unnaturally fell upon Las Casas, for he had often made the journey, was well acquainted in Spain, 

where he had many and powerful friends, and was well versed in the ways of the court. Fray 

Rodrigo went as his companion, and before quitting Guatemala, he went to take leave of the 

cacique Don Juan, who was much dejected at the departure of his friends.  The two travellers 

repaired first to Mexico, where a chapter of the Dominican Order was held on August 24, 1539, in 

which Pedro de Angulo was named prior of the convent in Guatemala, and Fray Luis Cancer was 

designated to accompany Las Casas and Ladrada to Spain.  During his stay in Mexico, Las Casas 

saw the Viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, who was inclined to share the view that humane 

treatment of the natives promised better results than violence, and willingly combined with him for 

several peaceful missions to distant provinces in the north-west of Mexico.  Charles V. was absent 

from Madrid when Las Casas and his companions arrived but the former was welcomed by 

stolen goods had to be given up to him.  The person robbed had to      give a written description of 

the object he had lost, and a      declaration as to when and where he had lost it.  The stolen 

property was then easily recovered, and restored to the owner on      the payment of one fourth of 

its value, which was given to  the      thief.  A similar state of things existed at Cairo within a 



comparatively short time.]  so we simply take their booty from them, and let them go.  But say, 

Paaker, what devil of amiability took possession of you down by the river, that you let the rascal 

escape unpunished."  "Did you do that?"  exclaimed Gagabu.  "Revenge is usually your--"  Ameni 

threw so warning a glance at the old man, that he suddenly broke off, and then asked the pioneer: 

"How did the struggle begin, and who was the fellow?"  "Some insolent people," said Paaker, 

"wanted to push in front of the boat that was waiting for my mother, and I asserted my rights.  The 

rascal fell upon me, and killed my dog and--by my Osirian father!--the crocodiles would long since 

have eaten him if a woman had not come between us, and made herself known to me as Bent-

Anat, the daughter of Rameses.  It was she herself, and the rascal was the young prince Rameri, 

who was yesterday forbidden this temple."  "Oho!"  cried the old master of the hunt.  "Oho! my 

lord!  Is this the way to speak of the children of the king?"  Others of the company who were 

attached to Pharaoh's family expressed their indignation; but Ameni whispered to Paaker--"Say no 

more!" then he continued aloud:  "You never were careful in weighing your words, my friend, and 

now, as it seems to me, you are speaking in the heat of fever.  Come here, Gagabu, and examine 

Paaker's wound, which is no disgrace to him--for it was inflicted by a prince."  The old man 

loosened the bandage from the pioneer's swollen hand.  "That was a bad blow," he exclaimed; 

"three fingers are broken, and--do you see?--the emerald too in your signet ring."  Paaker looked 

down at his aching fingers, and uttered a sigh of rehef, for it was not the oracular ring with the 

name of Thotmes III., but the valuable one given to his father by the reigning king that had been 

crushed.  Only a few solitary fragments of the splintered stone remained in the setting; the king's 

name had fallen to pieces, and disappeared. Paaker's bloodless lips moved silently, and an inner 

voice cried out to him: "The Gods point out the way!  The name is gone, the bearer of the name 

must follow."  "It is a pity about the ring," said Gagabu.  "And if the hand is not to follow it--luckily it 

is your left hand--leave off drinking, let yourself be taken to Nebsecht the surgeon, and get him to 

set the joints neatly, and bind them up."  Paaker rose, and went away after Ameni had appointed 

to meet him on the following day at the Temple of Seti, and the Regent at the palace.  When the 

door had closed behind him, the treasurer of the temple said:  "This has been a bad day for the 

Mohar, and perhaps it will teach him that here in Thebes he cannot swagger as he does in the 

field.  Another adventure occurred to him to-day; would you like to hear it?"  "Yes; tell it!"  cried the 

guests.  "You all knew old Seni," began the treasurer.  "He was a rich man, but he gave away all 

his goods to the poor, after his seven blooming sons, one after another, had died in the war, or of 

illness.  He only kept a small house with a little garden, and said that as the Gods had taken his 

children to themselves in the other world he would take pity on the forlorn 


_
business with the activity and perspicacity which marked his treatment of affairs.  Since the death 

of the Bishop of Burgos, another and a better spirit breathed in the Council, and there was a more 

sincere and consistent effort to give full effect to the royal decrees in favour of the Indians.  To this, 

the Bull of Paul III. had doubtless in no small measure contributed, for it was obviously impossible 

after such an authoritative pronouncement to continue along the old lines, treating the natives like 

chattels and affecting to deny them souls.  The Council accorded a number of beneficial provisions 

in response to Las Casas's representations. The pact entered into with the Governor, which 

guaranteed the independence of the cacique of naked' says the law; and now that Seni has 

nothing more to give away, he goes through the city, as you know, hungry and thirsty himself, and 

scarcely clothed, and begging for his adopted children, the poor.  We have all given to him, for we 

all know for whom he humbles himself, and holds out his hand.  To-day he went round with his 

little bag, and begged, with his kind good eyes, for alms.  Paaker has given us a good piece of 

arable land, and thinks, perhaps with reason, that he has done his part.  When Seni addressed 

him, he told him to go; but the old man did not give up asking him, he followed him persistently to 

the grave of his father, and a great many people with him.  Then the pioneer pushed him angrily 

back, and when at last 


_
by the Council, and letters were written in the King's name to several of the converted caciques; 

one of these new provisions ordered that the Indians should be taught music and that musical 

instruments should be furnished them from Spain.  Fray Bartholomew was equally successful in 

finding a number of friars for the diocese of Guatemala, and on January 21, 1541, Fray Luis 

Cancer sailed with a number of Franciscans on the return journey.  Las Casas and the 

Dominicans remained behind by command of Cardinal Loaysa, who intimated that the former's 

presence would be necessary later, for important matters, of which he would learn in due time. 

Before the departure of the Franciscans, the royal orders concerning the welfare of the Indians 

were proclaimed from the steps of the Cathedral of Seville in the presence of a large concourse of 

people.  Cardinal Loaysa, who occupied the metropolitan see of Seville, contemplated making 

important changes in the code of laws that governed the Indies, and his desire to consult Las 

Casas before framing his new system rendered it necessary that the latter should remain in Spain. 

In the following year, 1542, the Nuevas Leyes, or New Laws, as they were termed, were drawn up, 

and although there is no direct evidence to prove that they were drafted by Las Casas, there is 

little doubt that many of their most salutary articles were due to his influence and suggestions. The 

usual method of assembling councils composed of theologians, canonists, lawyers, and men who 

had had much experience in the colonies, was likewise followed at this time, and in their meetings 

the several questions concerning the system of government best adapted to the Indians, the most 

promising means for converting and civilizing them, and the measures required to correct and 

eliminate the abuses under which they suffered, were exhaustively discussed.  The verbal debates 

were supplemented by the presentation of facts and arguments in support of different theories, 

drawn up in writing.  In a raised his whip, and struck him two or three times, crying out: 'There- that 

is your portion!'  The good old man bore it quite patiently, while he untied the bag, and said with 

tears in his eyes: 'My portion--yes-- but not the portion of the poor!'  "I was standing near, and I 

saw how Paaker hastily withdrew into the tomb, and how his mother Setchem threw her full purse 

to Seni.  Others followed her example, and the old man never had a richer harvest.  The poor may 

thank the Mohar!  A crowd of people collected in front of the tomb, and he would have fared badly 

if it had not been for the police guard who drove them away."  During this narrative, which was 

heard with much approval--for no one is more secure of his result than he who can tell of the 

downfall of a man who is disliked for his arrogance--the Regent and the high-priest had been 

eagerly whispering to each other.  "There can be no doubt," said Ameni, that Bent-Anat did 

actually come to the festival."  "And had also dealings with the priest whom you so warmly 

defend," whispered the other.  "Pentaur  shall  be  questioned this very night," returned the high- 

priest.  "The dishes will soon be taken away, and the drinking will begin.  Let us go and hear what 

the poet says."  "But there are now no witnesses," replied Ani.  "We do not need them," said 

Ameni.  "He is incapable of a lie."  "Let us go then," said the Regent smiling, "for I am really 

curious about this white negro, and how he will come to terms with the truth.  You have forgotten 

that there is a woman in the case."  "That there always is!"  answered Ameni; he called Gagabu to 

him, gave him his seat, begged him to keep up the flow of cheerful conversation, to encourage the 

guests to drink, and to interrupt all talk of the king, the state, or the war.  "You know," he 

concluded, "that we are not by ourselves this evening. Wine has, before this, betrayed everything! 

Remember this--the mother of foresight looks backwards!"  Ani clapped his hand on the old man's 



shoulder.  "There 


_
Emperor's command at Valladolid in 1542, Las Casas presented one such lengthy memorial, in 

which he enumerated the different remedies which he maintained were indispensable if his 

Majesty would provide for the relief of his Indian vassals.  The number of the remedies proposed 

in this document is given by Las Casas himself as sixteen, but of these only the eighth is known to 

be in existence.  Probably it contained the substance of his thesis, which, like most papers of the 

time, must have been very wordy and discursive.  The eighth remedy was afterwards published at 

Seville in 1552 with twenty reasons in support of it.  Las Casas's habitual activity was in no way 

diminished, and he exercised as great energy in winning adherents to his cause as he did 

foresight in combating opposition to it.  Copies of his memorial were distributed to all the important 

men whose opinions might influence the tenor of the new laws and the spirit of their application, 

including the members of the council in Valladolid, especially Cardinal Loaysa, who was President 

of the India Council, Don Ramirez de Fuenleal, who had been transferred from the presidency of 

the audiencia of Mexico to the bishopric of Cuenca, Don Juan de Zuniga, Grand Commander of 

Castile, the Secretary, Francisco de los Cobos, and all the others who had been appointed to act 

as judges in this affair.  These men held meetings in the house of Pedro Gonzalez de Leon and 

the outcome of their deliberations was the formation of the famous code of Nuevas Leyes. 

Several of the articles of this code might have been drafted word for word by Las Casas himself so 

entirely do they bear the impress of his opinions:  "Item. We ordain and command that from now 

and henceforth no Indian may be enslaved because he has fought, nor for any other reason, 

whether because of rebellion, or for purposes of ransom, nor in any other way, and we desire that 

they shall be treated as our vassals of the Crown of Castile, for such they are."  "No one may 

press the Indians into service by way of naboria or tapia(51) nor in any cleared to-night in your 

winelofts.  It is said of you that you cannot bear to see either a full glass or an empty one; to-night 

give your aversion to both free play.  And when you think it is the right moment, give a sign to my 

steward, who is sitting there in the corner.  He has a few jars of the best liquor from Byblos, that he 

brought over with him, and he will bring it to you.  I will come in again and bid you good- night." 

Ameni was accustomed to leave the hall at the beginning of the drinking.  When the door was 

closed behind him and his companion, when fresh rose- garlands had been brought for the necks 

of the company, when lotus blossoms decorated their heads, and the beakers were refilled, a choir 

of musicians came in, who played on harps, lutes, flutes, and small drums. The conductor beat the 

time by clapping his hands, and when the music had raised the spirits of the drinkers, they 

seconded his efforts by rhythmical clippings.  The jolly old Gagabu kept up his character as a stout 

drinker, and leader of the feast.  The most priestly countenances soon beamed with cheerfulness, 

and the officers and courtiers outdid each other in audacious jokes.  Then the old man signed to a 

young temple-servant, who wore a costly wreath; he came forward with a small gilt image of a 

mummy, carried it round the circle and cried:  "Look at this, be merry and drink so long as you are 

on earth, for soon you must be like this."       [A custom mentioned by Herodotus.  Lucian saw 

such an image brought      in at a feast.  The Greeks adopted the idea, but beautified it,      using a 

winged Genius of death instead of a mummy.  The Romans also      had their "larva."]  Gagabu 

gave another signal, and the Regent's steward brought in the wine from Byblos.  Ani was much 

lauded for the wonderful choiceness of the liquor.  "Such wine," exclaimed the usually grave chief 

of the pastophori, "is like soap."       [This comparison is genuinely Eastern.  Kisra called wine "the 



soap      of sorrow."  The Mohammedans, to whom wine is forbidden, have      praised it like

that from henceforth the Indians shall not be made slaves, we likewise ordain and command that 

in the case of such as have been heretofore enslaved contrary to right and justice, the Audiencias

known, shall liberate them.  Nor may the Indians be unjustly enslaved in default of persons to 

solicit the aforesaid [procedure]; we command that the Audiencia shall      ibn Salih Haschimi says: 

"The best thing the world enjoys is wine."      Gahiz says: "When wine enters thy bones and flows 

through thy limbs      it bestows truth of feeling, and perfects the soul; it removes      sorrow, 

elevates the mood, etc., etc."  When Ibn 'Aischah was told      that some one drank no wine, he 

said: "He has thrice disowned the      world."  Ibn el Mu'tazz sang:       "Heed not time, how it may
