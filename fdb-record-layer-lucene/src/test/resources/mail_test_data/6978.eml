was the enactment in 1838 of a law prohibiting the return of such colored s=
tudents as had been=20

accustomed to go north to attend school after they were denied this privile=
ge in that State.[1]=20

Prominent among these seekers of better opportunities were the parents of R=
ichard De Baptiste.=20

His father was a popular mechanic of Fredericksburg, where he for years mai=
ntained a secret=20

school.[2] A public opinion proscribing the teaching of Negroes was then re=
ndering the effort to=20

enlighten them as unpopular in Kentucky as it was in Virginia. Thanks to a =
benevolent Kentuckian,=20

however, an important colored settlement near Xenia, Greene County, Ohio, w=
as then taking=20

shape. The nucleus of this group was furnished about 1856 by Noah Spears, w=
ho secured small=20

farms there for sixteen of his former bondmen.[3] The settlement was not on=
ly sought by fugitive=20

slaves and free Negroes, but was selected as the site for Wilberforce Unive=
rsity.[4]  [Footnote 1:=20

ries xxxi., No. 3, p.=20

p. 373; and _Non-

Slaveholder_, vol. ii., p. 113.]  During the same period, and especially fr=
om 1820 to 1835, a more=20

continuous and effective migration of southern Negroes was being promoted b=
y the Quakers of=20

Virginia and North Carolina.[1] One of their purposes was educational. Conv=
inced that the "buying,=20

selling, and holding of men in slavery" is a sin, these Quakers with a view=
 to future manumission=20

had been "careful of the moral and intellectual training of such as they he=
ld in servitude."[2] To=20

elevate their slaves to the plane of men, southern Quakers early hit upon t=
he scheme of=20

establishing in the Northwest such Negroes as they had by education been ab=
le to equip for living=20

as citizens. When the reaction in the South made it impossible for the Quak=
ers to continue their=20

policy of enlightening the colored people, these philanthropists promoted t=
he migration of the=20

blacks to the Northwest Territory with still greater zeal. Most of these se=
ttlements were made in=20

Hamilton, Howard, Wayne, Randolph, Vigo, Gibson, Grant, Rush, and Tipton Co=
unties, Indiana,=20

and in Darke County, Ohio.[3] Prominent among these promoters was Levi Coff=
in, the Quaker=20

Abolitionist of North Carolina, and reputed President of the Underground Ra=
ilroad. He left his State=20

and settled among Negroes at Newport, Indiana.[4] Associated with these lea=
ders also were=20

Benjamin Lundy of Tennessee and James G. Birney, once a slaveholder of Hunt=
sville, Alabama.=20

The latter manumitted his slaves and apprenticed and educated some of them =
in Ohio.[5]=20

and 68.]  [Footnote 4: Coffin, _Reminiscences_, p. 106.]  [Footnote 5: Birn=
ey, _James G. Birney=20

and His Times_, p. 139.]  The importance of this movement to the student of=
 education lies in the=20

fact that it effected an unequal distribution of intelligent Negroes. The m=
ost ambitious and=20

enlightened ones were fleeing to free territory. As late as 1840 there were=
 more intelligent blacks=20

in the South than in the North.[1] The number of southern colored people wh=
o could read was then=20

decidedly larger than that of such persons found in the free States. The co=
ntinued migration of=20

Negroes to the absolute: the children of the air eschewed that land of barr=
enness, and the beasts=20

of the field seemed also to have abandoned it. None of the gentler races th=
at man has succeeded=20



in taming found pasture there; and fortunately wolves were extremely rare, =
though not quite=20

unknown. Ivan never dreamed of them; his one concern was to keep the road, =
for so he called the=20

track made by the wheels of the rude waggons which brought the produce of t=
he corn-fields to the=20

river Oka. He knew that a ferry-boat crossed the river, bringing adventurou=
s travellers to the great=20

Moscow road on the other side. This road was the goal of his ambition. As a=
lready intimated, no=20

clear distinction existed in his mind between the Moscow road and Moscow it=
self, the holy city=20

towards which the heart of every Russian yearned with reverent love and pas=
sionate longing. It=20

was their Jerusalem, =E2=80=9Cbeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole=
 earth.=E2=80=9D Even ignorant little Ivan=20

had heard of its wonders and its glories; and he fancied that if once he ga=
ined the road he might=20

see in the distance the gilded spires and domes of the Kremlin gleaming in =
the sun. Michael had=20

never seen so much as that, nor been so far from home!  The sun, in Russia =
such a rare and=20

much-prized guest, was prodigal of his favours that day, and shone forth fr=
om a cloudless sky.=20

Ivan had equipped himself for a winter journey, and about noon he began to =
grow hot and weary.=20

No shelter was near him, so he sat down on the sand, rested a little, and a=
te some of his bread;=20

but he longed in vain for a draught of kvass[5] to finish his repast, nor c=
ould he find a single drop=20

of water anywhere. He rose unrefreshed and pursued his way; but, in spite o=
f all his childish=20

courage, the utter loneliness of the dreary waste around him began to tell =
upon his spirits. He=20

sang, he shouted, he talked aloud to himself, merely for the comfort of hea=
ring his own voice; until=20

by-and-by he became too weary for these exercises--all he could contrive to=
 do was to keep=20

moving on with a kind of dogged determination. Once and again was he tempte=
d to turn back and=20

give up the adventure; indeed, he would have done so, only for the thought,=
 =E2=80=9CIf I come back having=20

seen nothing, Michael will jeer me, and Anna Popovna will join in the laugh=
.=E2=80=9D  At last he grew so=20

tired and frightened that he threw himself on the ground in a kind of despa=
ir, made the sign of the=20

cross, said a prayer to his patron St. John the evangelist, then fell into =
a state of drowsiness, and=20

lost all sense of time, until, after an interval of perhaps an hour, he was=
 aroused by the sound of=20

voices.  Never had human voices seemed more welcome. Ivan started to his fe=
et, and saw to his=20

great delight a party of five or six mujiks, carrying large baskets of cabb=
ages and other vegetables.=20

Greetings were soon exchanged. His new friends told him that they were jour=
neying from a distant=20

village to a fair at Kaluga, a town on the other bank of the Oka. They inte=
nded, after crossing the=20

river, to travel all night, that they might reach the fair with their merch=
andise early the next=20

morning. They took the tired little wayfarer by the hand and helped him on,=
 encouraging him with=20

kind words, and telling him they were now not far from the ferry.  At last =
the river appeared in the=20

distance, glimmering in the light of the rising moon. =E2=80=9CLook,=E2=80=
=9D cried his companions, =E2=80=9Cyonder is the=20

Oka.=E2=80=9D But Ivan was by this time too weary to care; he could scarcel=
y keep his eyes open and his=20

feet moving.  They drew nearer and nearer. The river was as broad as the Th=
ames--a fine sheet of=20

water, with green banks on either side. From these there came a hoarse, mon=
otonous sound--the=20

croaking of innumerable frogs, which some one has unpoetically called =E2=
=80=9Cthe nightingales of=20

Russia.=E2=80=9D Soon a brown wooden shed came into view,=20


_
despite the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, made this distribu=
tion more unequal.=20

While the free colored population of the slave States increased only 23,736=
 from 1850 to 1860,=20

that of the free States increased 29,839. In the South only Delaware, Georg=
ia, Maryland, and=20

North Carolina showed a noticeable increase in the number of free persons o=
f color during the=20

decade immediately preceding the Civil War. This element of the population =
had only slightly=20

increased in Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Virginia, Louisiana, S=
outh Carolina, and=20

the District of Columbia. The number of free Negroes of Florida remained pr=
actically constant.=20

Those of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas diminished. In the North, of cour=
se, the tendency was=20

in the other direction. With the exception of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont=
, and New York,=20

which had about the same free colored population in 1860 as they had in 185=
0, there was a=20

general increase in the number of Negroes in the free States. Ohio led in t=
his respect having had=20

during this period an increase of 11,394.[2]  [Footnote 1: Jones, _Religiou=
s Instruction of the=20

Negroes_, p. 115.]  [Footnote 2: See statistics on pages 237-240.]  On comp=
aring the educational=20

statistics of these sections this truth becomes more apparent. In 1850 ther=
e were 4,354 colored=20

children attending school in the South, but by 1860 this number had dropped=
 to 3,651. Slight=20

increases were noted only in Alabama, Missouri, Delaware, South Carolina, a=
nd the District of=20

Columbia. Georgia and Mississippi had then practically deprived all Negroes=
 of this privilege. The=20

former, which reported one colored child as attending school in 1850, had j=
ust seven in 1860; the=20

latter had none in 1850 and only two in 1860. In all other slave States the=
 number of pupils of=20

African blood had materially decreased.[1] In the free States there were 22=
,107 colored children in=20

school in 1850, and 28,978 in 1860. Most of these were in New Jersey, Ohio,=
 New York, and=20

Pennsylvania, which in 1860 had 2,741; 5,671; 5,694; and 7,573, respectivel=
y.[2]  [Footnote 1:=20

ootnote 2: See=20

statistics on pages 237-240.]  The report on illiteracy shows further the d=
ifferences resulting from=20

the divergent educational policies of the two sections. In 1850 there were =
in the slave States=20

58,444 adult free Negroes who could not read, and in 1860 this number had r=
eached 59,832. In all=20

such commonwealths except Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, and Mississippi the=
re was an increase=20

in illiteracy among the free blacks. These States, however, were hardly exc=
eptional, because=20

Arkansas and Mississippi had suffered a decrease in their free colored popu=
lation, that of Florida=20

had remained the same, and the difference in the case of Louisiana was very=
 slight. The statistics=20

of the Northern States indicate just the opposite trend. Notwithstanding th=
e increase of persons of=20

color resulting from the influx of the migrating element, there was in all =
free States exclusive of=20

California, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania a decreas=
e in the illiteracy of=20

Negroes. But these States hardly constitute exceptions; for California, Wis=
consin, and Minnesota=20

had very few colored inhabitants in 1850, and the others had during this de=
cade received so many=20

fugitives in the rough that race prejudice and its concomitant drastic legi=
slation impeded the=20

educational progress of their transplanted freedmen.[1] In the Northern Sta=
tes where this condition=20

did not obtain, the benevolent whites had, in cooeperation with the Negroes=
, done much to reduce=20

illiteracy among them during these years.  [Footnote 1: STATISTICS OF THE F=

is ready to faint.=E2=80=9D  It was to the honour of the people of Nicolofs=
ky that, though themselves no=20

patterns of sobriety, they had at least kept the destroyer from the young l=
ips of their nursling. Ivan=20

turned from the fiery beverage with loathing, and asked for kvass. =E2=80=
=9CHere is no kvass,=E2=80=9D said the old=20

woman roughly. =E2=80=9CNo man would be fool enough to drink it who could g=
et vodka. But you can have=20

water, if you like.=E2=80=9D  With this he was content. He wrapped himself =
up in his shuba, lay down beside=20

the fire in the shed, and was soon fast asleep; while the mujiks sat outsid=
e talking, laughing,=20

singing, and drinking vodka.     CHAPTER III.  SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENS =
TO IVAN.=20

=E2=80=9CDir ist dein Ohr geklungen     Vom Lob das man dir bot,   Doch ist=

UCK=C3=84RT.   When Ivan awoke it was=20

broad daylight; the shed was empty, and all around him still and silent. Af=
ter a few moments of=20

bewilderment, he remembered where he was, and a sudden terror seized him le=
st the boat might=20

have come and gone, and his companions have crossed the river without him. =
So he threw on his=20

shuba and hurried out. They were standing on the bank, watching eagerly for=
 the boat--or rather=20

for the boatman, of whom as yet there was no appearance, though they were t=
antalized by the=20

sight of the empty boat lying high and dry on the opposite bank. Their irri=
tation increased every=20

moment, and curses were not wanting, which lost none of their effect uttere=
d in that hard,=20

resonant, metallic language.  At this point a new wayfarer joined the group=
. He came with long=20

strides, as one in eager haste, and his annoyance at the delay seemed even =
greater than that of=20

the rest. He was a fine, active, young fellow, neatly dressed, and with a m=
ason=E2=80=99s trowel stuck in=20

the sash of his caftan, where all the others carried the indispensable axe.=
 Seeing no sign of the=20

approach of a boat, he grew pale, and ground his teeth with angry disappoin=
tment.  =E2=80=9CJust like my=20

luck!=E2=80=9D he muttered. =E2=80=9CAs well throw myself into the river at=
 once, as wait here much longer.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CPatience, friend,=E2=80=9D said the oldest of the mujiks. =E2=80=
=9CAre we not all in the like case? Nay, we are worse=20

off than you, for we have waited here all night.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWorse o=
ff! you little know! With you it is a matter=20

of a few kopecks; with me it is life and death. If I am not at Klopti by su=
ndown, there is the knout=20

for my back.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy? In Heaven=E2=80=99s name, what have yo=
u done?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDone! nothing in the world but=20

work at my trade, and pay my obrok truly to my lord=E2=80=9D (for he was on=
e of that numerous class of=20

serfs who were permitted by their lords to work on their own account, upon =
payment of an annual=20

tax, or _obrok_). =E2=80=9CBut he raised my obrok three times, until at las=
t I could scarcely live, and was left=20

no chance of saving a rouble or two for the future. Then last summer I fell=
 from the scaffolding of a=20

house I was building, and was sore hurt. Only that the people I lodged with=
 were good Christians,=20

it would have gone ill with me. But I recovered, thanks to my patron St. St=
efen; and when the=20

spring came on I got work again--government work too, which is well paid. I=
 made up my obrok,=20

and then--why then, my brothers, the world went well with me, and my heart =
was light. Little=20

Katinka, the daughter of the kind soul that took care of me while I was ill=
, was the prettiest girl in=20

the quarter, and good and pure like a candle of white wax made to burn befo=
re the picture of a=20

holy saint. So we gave each other our troth; and I think the Czar himself o=
n his golden throne was=20

scarce happier than I. But five days ago there came a messenger from Klopti=
 to call me home at=20

once. My lord wants to make him a new house, and must needs have me to buil=
d it for him and to=20

teach the men of the village to build also. It was sudden; but my lord does=
 not think much of us=20

poor people--God forgive him!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, brother;--what is it =
you call yourself?=E2=80=9D asked the mujik who=20

had spoken before.  =E2=80=9CStefen Alexitch, at your service.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CWell, then, Brother Stefen, why did you=20

not set out at once? You would have been by this time at your journey=E2=80=
=99s end.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI know it. Indeed I=20

was wrong, very wrong. But the very next day was Katinka=E2=80=99s feast-da=
y, and as I knew only too well=20

that I was never likely to look on her sweet face again, I was tempted to s=
tay, just that I might=20

dance one more measure with her. I thought I could have walked more quickly=
. And now this=20

cursed delay! God grant my lord may not lose patience altogether, and wreak=
 his vengeance on=20

my poor old father and mother! That would be worse than the knout across my=
 own shoulders.=E2=80=9D=20

Stefen=E2=80=99s narrative elicited many expressions of compassion.  =E2=80=
=9CPoor lad! thy case is hard indeed,=E2=80=9D=20



said one.  =E2=80=9CAh,=E2=80=9D sighed another, =E2=80=9Chow true the prov=
erb, =E2=80=98Heaven is high, and the Czar far off.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  But=
=20

at that moment a third exclaimed joyfully,--  =E2=80=9CLook, brothers!--the=
 boat at last!=E2=80=9D  So it was. At first it=20

was seen to shoot rapidly across the strong current of the river; but by-an=
d-by the rower seemed=20

to flag, and his strokes grew uncertain and unsteady.  The mujiks were too =
glad to see him on any=20

terms to be critical about the quality of his performances. They crowded to=
 the river=E2=80=99s brink, that=20

they might be ready to spring into the boat the moment it touched the land.=
  Ivan took advantage=20

of the confusion to steal up to Stefen and slip his silver rouble quietly i=
nto his hand. =E2=80=9CTake it,=E2=80=9D he=20

whispered. =E2=80=9CIt is all I have; but you can get a fairing with it to =
send to Katinka.=E2=80=9D  It was poor=20

consolation; but he meant it well, and Stefen=E2=80=99s sore heart was soot=
hed by the gentle touch. He=20

bent over the boy and kissed him. There was no time to do more; if they wis=
hed to get places in=20

the boat, they must hasten.  The=20

thickened with much vodka. A party of boyars--_very_ great boyars, high and=
 mighty excellencies-

-had come to the post-house on the Moscow road, and the postmaster had kept=
 him busy going=20

on their errands, both last night and this morning. It was easy to see in w=
hat coin his services had=20

been paid for; he had taken so much vodka that he was scarcely able to row =
the boat at all, and,=20

moreover, it was too heavily freighted for safety, not to say for comfort. =
 Ivan had never been on=20

the water before, and he soon became thoroughly frightened; not without rea=
son. When they=20

reached the middle of the river the boatman showed himself so manifestly in=
capable that Stefen=20

offered to take the oars. Russian peasants are usually good-tempered, even =
when under the=20

influence of vodka; but the boatman, unhappily, was surly and dogged by nat=
ure, and rudely=20

refused to yield his place. For a few minutes Stefen waited quietly; then s=

by force. The boatman resisted, and a struggle ensued, from which Ivan hid =
his face in terror; for=20

now the two men were standing up, striking and pushing each other wildly, w=
hile the frail, heavily-

laden boat swayed and rocked beneath their reckless feet. One was drunk, th=
e other angry and=20

=E2=80=9Cbitter of soul.=E2=80=9D At length Ivan heard a heavy plash close =
beside him. Hastily uncovering his eyes,=20

he saw the waters closing over the luckless Stefen, and uttered a cry of ho=
rror. To his great relief,=20

however, Stefen rose again to the surface, and one of the mujiks, seizing a=

But either he had lost his presence of mind, or, more probably, his head ha=

in falling. At all events, he made no effort to grasp the oar; and the muji=
ks--ignorant, stupid, and=20

awkward, though not lacking in kindliness--gave him up for lost. Indeed, th=
eir own situation was=20

critical enough; but they got to the shore somehow.  The boatman was sobere=
d by the shock, and=20

almost stupified with grief for what had happened. But the others crowded r=

Census of the United States, vol. 1.]  How the problem of educating these p=
eople on free soil was=20

solved can be understood only by keeping in mind the factors of the migrati=
on. Some of these=20

Negroes had unusual capabilities. Many of them had in slavery either acquir=
ed the rudiments of=20

education or developed sufficient skill to outwit the most determined pursu=
ers. Owing so much to=20

mental power, no man was more effective than the successful fugitive in ins=
tilling into the minds of=20

his people the value of education. Not a few of this type readily added to =
their attainments to equip=20

themselves for the best service. Some of them, like Reverend Josiah Henson,=
 William Wells=20

Brown, and Frederick Douglass, became leaders, devoting their time not only=
 to the cause of=20

abolition, but also to the enlightenment of the colored people. Moreover, t=
he free Negroes=20

migrating to the North were even more effective than the fugitive slaves in=
 advancing the cause of=20

education.[1] A larger number of the former had picked up useful knowledge.=
 In fact, the=20

prohibition of the education of the free people of color in the South was o=
ne of the reasons they=20

could so readily leave their native homes.[2] The free blacks then going to=
 the Northwest Territory=20

proved to be decidedly helpful to their benefactors in providing colored ch=
urches and schools with=20

educated workers, who otherwise would have been brought from the East at mu=
ch expense.=20

[Footnote 1: Howe, _The Refugee from Slavery_, p. 77.]  [Footnote 2: Russel=
l, _The Free Negro in=20

Virginia_ (Johns Hopkins University Studies, series xxxi., No. 3, p. 107).]=
  On perusing this sketch=20

the educator naturally wonders exactly what intellectual progress was made =
by these groups on=20

free soil. This question cannot be fully answered for the reason that extan=
t records give no=20

detailed account of many colored settlements which underwent upheaval or fa=
iled to endure. In=20

some cases we learn simply that a social center flourished and was then des=
troyed. On "Black=20

Friday," January 1, 1830, eighty Negroes were driven out of Portsmouth, Ohi=
o, at the request of=20

one or two hundred white citizens, set forth in an urgent memorial.[1] Afte=
r the passage of the=20

Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 the colored population of Columbia, Pennsylvania=
, dropped from nine=20

hundred and forty-three to four hundred and eighty-seven.[2] The Negro comm=
unity in the=20

northwestern part of that State was broken up entirely.[3] The African Meth=
odist and Baptist=20

churches of Buffalo lost many communicants. Out of a membership of one hund=
red and fourteen,=20

the colored Baptist church of Rochester lost one hundred and twelve, includ=
ing its pastor. About=20

the same time eighty-four members of the African Baptist church of Detroit =
crossed into=20

Canada.[4] The break-up of these churches meant the end of the day and Sund=
ay-schools which=20

were maintained in them. Moreover, the migration of these Negroes aroused s=
uch bitter feeling=20

against them that their schoolhouses were frequently burned. It often seeme=
d that it was just as=20



unpopular to educate the blacks in the North as in the South. Ohio, Illinoi=
s, and Oregon enacted=20

laws to prevent them from coming into those commonwealths.  [Footnote 1: Ev=
ans, _A History of=20

Scioto County, Ohio_, p. 613.]  [Footnote 2: Siebert, _The Underground Rail=
road_, p. 249.]=20

[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 249.]  [Footnote 4: _Ibid_., p. 250.]  We have, ho=
wever, sufficient evidence=20

of large undertakings to educate the colored people then finding homes in l=
ess turbulent parts=20

beyond the Ohio. In the first place, almost every settlement made by the Qu=
akers was a center to=20

which Negroes repaired for enlightenment. In other groups where there was n=
o such opportunity,=20

they had the cooeperation of certain philanthropists in providing facilitie=
s for their mental and moral=20

development. As a result, the free blacks had access to schools and churche=
s in Hamilton,=20

Howard, Randolph, Vigo, Gibson, Rush, Tipton, Grant, and Wayne counties, In=
diana,[1] and=20

Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair counties, Illinois. There were colored schoo=
ls and churches in=20

Logan, Clark, Columbiana, Guernsey, Jefferson, Highland, Brown, Darke, Shel=
by, Green, Miami,=20

Warren, Scioto, Gallia, Ross, and Muskingum counties, Ohio.[2] Augustus Wat=
tles said that with=20

the assistance of abolitionists he organized twenty-five such schools in Oh=
io counties after=20

1833.[3] Brown County alone had six. Not many years later a Negro settlemen=
t in Gallia County,=20

Ohio, was paying a teacher fifty dollars a quarter.[4]  [Footnote 1: Wright=

 in Ohio_, p. 89.]  Still=20

better colored schools were established in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in=
 Springfield, Columbus,=20

and Cincinnati, Ohio. While the enlightenment of the few Negroes in Pittsbu=
rgh did not require the=20

systematic efforts put forth to elevate the race elsewhere, much was done t=
o provide them=20

educational facilities in that city. Children of color first attended the w=
hite schools there just as they=20

did throughout the State of like a Christian. This he consented to do; and =
the task of finding it=20

proved unexpectedly easy, for a miniature island, in the midst of the river=
, with a single tree=20

growing upon it, had arrested the body as it was borne downwards by the str=
ong current of the=20

stream. The group on the shore waited in mournful silence while the boatman=
 and two of the=20

mujiks went and returned, bringing with them their solemn freight, which th=
ey laid sadly and=20

reverently on the fair greensward, beneath the happy morning sun.  All cros=
sed themselves and=20

murmured a prayer for his soul; and the oldest of the mujiks detached a lit=
tle sacred picture from=20

his own neck and laid it on his breast.  It was Ivan=E2=80=99s first meetin=
g face to face with the king of=20

terrors. The form so lately full of life and energy lay stiff and rigid; wh=
ile the brow, the cheek, the=20

lips--when he saw the strange and solemn change that had swept over all the=
se, his young heart=20

could bear no more, he lifted up his voice and wept. His tears unlocked the=
 floodgates of the=20

general sorrow; all the mujiks standing around him wept and wrung their han=
ds, like the grown-up=20

children that in truth they were.  Just at that moment, as if to throw into=
 strongest relief the contrast=20

between life and death, between earth=E2=80=99s brightest sunshine and her =
deepest shadows, a young=20

boyar from the party at the post-house came riding rapidly over the smooth =
greensward. Drawing=20

near the weeping group, he checked his horse to a foot-pace, and Ivan turne=
d and looked at him.=20

There was no splendour in his dress--an officer=E2=80=99s uniform, gray in =
colour and plain in fashion. But=20

his face, which seemed to bring the glow and glory of the morning with it, =
held Ivan=E2=80=99s gaze with a=20



kind of fascination. Features almost perfect enough for the deathless marbl=
e of a Grecian sculptor=20

might have worn no charm to his untrained eye, if they had not also beamed =
with a kindness and=20

gentleness that took his heart at once. That bright, young face--the first =
beardless manly face he=20

remembered to have seen--left itself for ever on his mind. It was destined =
to be the inspiration of=20

his life; and when death closed his eyes, he had scarcely a dearer hope tha=
n to see it once again=20

in the morning of the resurrection.  The boyar, meanwhile, had come quite c=
lose to the group ere=20

he appeared to perceive distinctly the cause of their distress. But no soon=
er had he done so than=20

he sprang from his horse, flinging the bridle to Ivan, who proudly accepted=
 the charge. The next=20

moment he was bending over the lifeless form; the next, he turned and said =
cheerfully to the=20

mujiks standing near,--  =E2=80=9CMy children, this is not death. We will s=
ave him yet.=E2=80=9D  They were=20

speechless with amazement. Was this stranger a holy saint, a worker of mira=
cles? They knew at=20

least that he was a nobleman and an officer, whom fortunately every instinc=
t of their nature, every=20

habit of their lives, taught them to obey without a question. Rapidly singl=
ing out two or three of the=20

most intelligent-looking, he set them to work--working with them himself as=
 Ivan, used to the=20

dawdling, dreamy ways of the mujiks, had never in his life seen any one wor=
k before. By magic, as=20

it seemed, poor Stefen=E2=80=99s dripping clothes were removed, and he was =
wrapped in the warmest=20

garments the mujiks could contribute for the purpose--Ivan, amongst others,=
 gladly offering his=20

little sheepskin shuba. Then the cold and rigid limbs were gently chafed, a=
 work of time and=20

patience. Those who were helping did mechanically whatever they were direct=
ed to do, while the=20

rest looked on in a kind of wondering stupefaction. How could even a boyar =
expect to bring a dead=20

man to life?  After a considerable time had been spent in this manner, the =
whole party from the=20

post-house came up, boyars and servants, all on horseback. Instead of calli=
ng upon their=20

companion to join them, as Ivan rather expected them to do, the boyars at o=
nce dismounted and=20

joined _him_, leaving their horses on the road in the care of the servants.=
 One of these drew near=20

Ivan, and attempted to take his charge from him; but he resisted.  =E2=80=
=9CNo,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CMy boyar=E2=80=99s hand=20

gave this bridle into mine, and into no other but his will I give it back a=
gain.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet the boy alone,=20

Ilya,=E2=80=9D cried another of the attendants, with a good-humoured laugh.=
 =E2=80=9CLet him keep his luck. It may=20

not come twice in his life-time.=E2=80=9D  After that Ivan could not so eas=
ily see what was happening,=20

though he watched intently and with the keenest interest. =E2=80=9CHis boya=
r=E2=80=9D seemed to refer the matter,=20

as to a person of superior authority, to a very tall, very stern-looking in=
dividual, who examined=20

Stefen carefully, putting his hand on his heart and on his wrist. Presently=
, and rather to Ivan=E2=80=99s=20

horror, he drew from his pocket a sort of case, out of which there flashed =
a bright instrument of=20

steel, like a thin sharp knife, and with this he proceeded to inflict a dee=
p cut upon Stefen=E2=80=99s arm;=20

while, far from objecting, the young boyar carefully held it for him, and t=
hen produced a fine white=20

kerchief of his own, which he gave him to bind the wound.[7]  But still the=
 pale, cold form lay there=20

stiff and motionless. Was it death? or was it only a death-like swoon? It w=
as the nobles who were=20

busy now, chafing the cold hands and feet, and using every other possible m=
eans to restore=20

animation; for the peasants had given place to them, and stood aside, silen=
t and wondering=20

spectators of the scene.  Time passed: life and death were struggling for t=
he mastery, and the=20

conflict was tedious and protracted. It was no even contest. From the first=
, victory seemed to=20

incline to the side of the sable king. The chance of life, always desperate=
, lessened apparently=20

with every minute, and when the minutes grew to hours it seemed to vanish a=
ltogether away. At=20



last the tall surgeon shook his head, and turning to the boyar said somethi=
ng in a foreign tongue=20

that evidently expressed despair. But _he_ would not admit the thought. Iva=
n knew not, of course,=20

what he said in answer, but it was easy to see that he had steadfastly reso=
lved not to abandon=20

hope, and that he was entreating, urging, even commanding the rest to conti=
nue their efforts.=20

Apparently for no purpose but to please him they obeyed. An interval follow=
ed of renewed=20

exertion, though of ever-waning hope. At length, however, the surgeon=E2=80=
=99s instrument flashed out=20

once more, and almost immediately afterwards a thrill of emotion passed thr=
ough the entire group.=20

One shuddering sigh, one faint, low groan was heard from the lips that=20


_
larger numbers of them collected in this gateway to the Northwest, either r=
ace feeling or the=20

pressing needs of the migrating freedmen brought about the establishment of=
 schools especially=20

adapted to their instruction. Such efforts were frequent after 1830.[2] Joh=
n Thomas Johnson, a=20

teacher of the District of Columbia, moved to Pittsburgh in 1838 and became=
 an instructor in a=20

colored school of that city.[3] Cleveland had an "African School" as early =
as 1832. John Malvin,=20

the moving spirit of the enterprise in that city, organized about that time=
 "The School Fund Society"=20

which established other colored schools in the boyar, raising the military =
cap from his stately head=20

with its clustering chestnut curls. =E2=80=9CThis is amongst the brightest =
days of my life.=E2=80=9D Ivan stood near=20

enough to see that his blue eyes were full of tears.  Whilst they gave Stef=
en a little vodka, and=20

prepared a kind of litter in which to carry him to the post-house, several =
other persons came up,=20

including the priest and the starost of the nearest village; for some of th=
e mujiks had gone away=20

and spread the story of the strange things they had been witnessing.  Then =
to Ivan=E2=80=99s young eyes=20

the scene became confused. Much happened that he could not exactly understa=
nd.=20

and fugitives at=20

Cincinnati was followed by efforts to train them for higher service. The Ne=
groes themselves=20

endeavored to provide their own educational facilities in opening in 1820 t=
he first colored school in=20

that city. This school did not continue long, but another was established t=
he same year. Thereafter=20

one Mr. Wing, who kept a private institution, admitted persons of color to =
his evening classes. On=20

account of a lack of means, however, the Negroes of Cincinnati did not rece=
ive any systematic=20

instruction before 1834. After that year the tide turned in favor of the fr=
ee blacks of that section,=20

bringing to their assistance a number of daring abolitionists, who helped t=
hem to educate=20

themselves. Friends of the race, consisting largely of the students of Lane=
 Seminary, had then=20

organized colored Sunday and evening schools, and provided for them scienti=
fic and literary=20

lectures twice a week. There was a permanent colored school in Cincinnati i=
n 1834. In 1835 the=20

Negroes of that city contributed $150 of the $1000 expended for their educa=
tion. Four years later,=20

however, they raised $889.03 for this purpose, and thanks to their economic=
 progress, this=20

sacrifice was less taxing than that of 1835.[1] In 1844 Rev. Hiram Gilmore =
opened there a high=20

school which among other students attracted P.B.S. Pinchback, later Governo=
r of Louisiana. Mary=20

E. Miles, a graduate of the Normal School at Albany, New York, served as an=
 assistant of Gilmore=20

after having worked among her people in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.[2] =
 [Footnote 1:=20

_Ibid._, p. 83.]  [Footnote 1: Delany, _The Condition of the Colored People=
_, etc., 132.]  The=20

educational advantages given these people were in no sense despised. Althou=
gh the Negroes of=20

the Northwest did not always keep pace with their neighbors in things indus=
trial they did not permit=20

the white people to outstrip them much in education. The freedmen so earnes=
tly seized their=20

opportunity to acquire knowledge and accomplished so much in a short period=
 that their=20

educational progress served to disabuse the minds of indifferent whites of =
the idea that the blacks=20

were not capable of high mental development.[1] The educational work of the=
se centers, too,=20

tended not only to produce men capable of ministering to the needs of their=
 environment, but to=20

serve as a training center for those who would later be leaders of their pe=
ople. Lewis Woodson=20

owed it to friends in Pittsburgh that he became an influential teacher. Jer=
emiah H. Brown, T.=20

Morris Chester, James T. Bradford, M.R. Delany, and Bishop Benjamin T. Tann=
er obtained much=20

of their elementary education in the early colored schools of that city.[2]=
 J.C. Corbin, a prominent=20

educator before and after the Civil War, acquired sufficient knowledge at C=
hillicothe, Ohio, to=20

qualify in 1848 as an assistant in Rev. Henry Adams's school in Louisville.=
[3] John M. Langston=20

was for a while one of Corbin's fellow-students at Chillicothe before the f=
ormer entered Oberlin.=20

United States Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi spent some time in a Quak=
er seminary in=20

Union County, Indiana.[4] Rev. J.T. White, one of the leading spirits of Ar=
kansas during the=20

Reconstruction, was born and educated in Clark County in that State.[5] Fan=
nie Richards, still a=20

teacher at Detroit, Michigan, is another example of the professional Negro =
equipped for service in=20

the Northwest before the Rebellion.[6] From other communities of that secti=
on came such useful=20

men as Rev. J.W. Malone, an influential minister of Iowa; Rev. D.R. Roberts=
, a very successful=20

pastor of Chicago; Bishop C.T. Shaffer of the African Methodist Episcopal C=
hurch; Rev. John G.=20

Mitchell, for many years the Dean of the Theological Department of Wilberfo=
rce University; and=20



President S.T. Mitchell, once the head of the same institution.[7]  [Footno=

egro Rural Communities in=20

Indiana," _Southern Workman_, vol. xxxvii., p. 169.]  In the colored settle=
ments of Canada the=20

outlook for Negro education was still brighter. This better opportunity was=
 due to the high=20

character of the colonists, to the mutual aid resulting from the proximity =
of the communities, and to=20

the cooeperation of the Canadians. The previous experience of most of these=
 adventurers as=20

sojourners in the free States developed in them such noble traits that they=
 did not have to be=20

induced to ameliorate their condition. They had already come under educativ=
e influences which=20

prepared them for a larger task in Canada. Fifteen thousand of sixty thousa=
nd Negroes in Canada=20

in 1860 were free born.[1] Many of those, who had always been free, fled to=
 Canada[2] when the=20

Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 made it possible for even a dark-complexioned Ca=
ucasian to be=20

reduced to a state of bondage. Fortunately, too, these people settled in th=
e same section. The=20

colored settlements at Dawn, Colchester, Elgin, Dresden, Windsor, Sandwich,=
 Queens, Bush,=20

Wilberforce, Hamilton, St. Catherines, Chatham, Riley, Anderton, Maiden, Go=
nfield, were all in=20

Southern Ontario. In the course of time the growth of these groups produced=
 a population=20

sufficiently dense to was certain, for he saw him try to kiss the hand that=
 had so patiently drawn=20

him back from the gates of the grave. And now, for the first time, the thou=
ght occurred to Ivan that=20

his triumph over Michael would be complete and glorious. Michael assuredly =
had never seen a=20

dead man brought to life again!  At last the great people seemed to be prep=
aring to pursue their=20

journey. Ivan watched =E2=80=9Chis boyar=E2=80=9D as he talked for some tim=
e to the priest and the starost, who=20

stood before him with uncovered heads and an air of the deepest reverence; =
then, seeing him look=20

for his horse, he led his charge forward, and held the stirrup gracefully w=
hile he mounted. He got a=20

word of praise for his =E2=80=9Clong patience,=E2=80=9D and a bright piece =
of gold glittered in his hand.  =E2=80=9CTake me=20

with you, my boyar,=E2=80=9D he cried, with a sudden impulse. =E2=80=9CLet =
me serve you; I would _love_ to do it.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CMy child, you shall serve me one day--not yet,=E2=80=9D said the b=
oyar, smiling.  A few moments more,=20

and the stately cavalcade had moved away. Ivan stood in silence, unable to =
withdraw his gaze=20

from the retreating figure of his hero until it was lost in the distance.  =
The white-haired priest came=20

up to him and laid his hand on his shoulder. =E2=80=9CMy lad,=E2=80=9D he s=
aid, =E2=80=9Cdo you know who has spoken to=20

you--whose horse you have had the honour of holding?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes=
,=E2=80=9D said Ivan, wakening out of a=20

dream; =E2=80=9Cno--yes--at least I know it was a boyar, a great, and good,=
 and splendid boyar, with the=20

face of an angel. I love him!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen pray for him all the =
days of thy life, for know that he is none=20

other than thy sovereign lord and mine, the Czar Alexander Paulovitch.=E2=
=80=9D  Ivan stared, then burst=20

out laughing. =E2=80=9CYou are jesting with me,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9C=
Nay, father, I am only a boy, but I know better=20

than that. I am quite twelve years old, and I know very well that the Czar =
lives in St. Petersburg,=20

and wears a golden crown, and sits upon a throne, and all the boyars stand =
uncovered around=20

him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CStill, I tell thee truth. That handsome young offic=
er was the great Czar himself--the lord of=20

all the Russias. To prove my words--I am a poor man, but I will give thee t=
wice, three times its=20

value for that coin in thy hand, which his hand touched.=E2=80=9D  Ivan sho=
ok his head. =E2=80=9CNo, no, father; I=20

don=E2=80=99t believe a word of your story; but I love my boyar, and I will=
 not give away his gift. He said I=20

should serve him one day, and I mean to do it. Though, to be sure,=E2=80=9D=
 he added, thoughtfully, =E2=80=9CI=20



might almost part with it for poor Stefen=E2=80=99s sake, and to do a good =
deed. How will he dare to meet=20

his master=E2=80=99s face--later than ever now?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNever tr=
ouble thyself for thy friend Stefen; he is rich=20

enough this day to buy his freedom, if he will. He who gave him back his li=
fe has taken care to=20

make that life worth the keeping.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen he can marry Kati=
nka?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe can marry whom he=20

pleases. Our lord the Czar never leaves anything half done.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9COh! what a good day it has been!=E2=80=9D=20

and Ivan, in his own estimation far too old to be deceived by an idle story=
, was by no means too=20

old to leap and dance for very joy.  =E2=80=9CYou believe _that_,=E2=80=9D =
said the priest; =E2=80=9Cthen why do you doubt=20

the rest of my story?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBecause,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan, =
=E2=80=9CI have wit enough to know that the great Czar,=20

who =E2=80=98is God upon earth,=E2=80=99 as the proverb says, would not car=
e for the life of a poor mujik, and toil=20

hard to save it, as my boyar did this day.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, fools w=
ill be fools while the world lasts. Here, take=20

thy shuba; Stefen left it for thee when they brought him to the post-house.=
 Go thy ways; and God=20

teach thee that it shows more wit to believe what one is told than to quest=
ion it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGood day,=20

father,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan; =E2=80=9CI am going home--to Nicolofsky, wh=
ere people speak the truth to their=20

neighbours.=E2=80=9D  With this parting shaft, he drew on his shuba, and tu=
rned his steps homewards,=20

highly pleased with his adventure. What a story he would have for the staro=
st and mativshka, for=20

Pope Nikita and one-eared Michael, not to speak of Anna Popovna, by no mean=
s the least in his=20

estimation!  He crossed the river without delay--the ferry-boat and the pen=
itent ferryman being this=20

time both in readiness--and then he resumed his journey on foot. As he walk=
ed, he ate the=20

remainder of his bread; for he had tasted nothing that day, and it was now =
long past noon. With a=20

happy heart he pursued his way until about sunset, when fatigue obliged him=
 to stop and rest. He=20

lay down under a solitary fir-tree, intending only to indulge in a short--a=
 _very_ short slumber. But=20

nature proved too strong for him: when he awoke again the sky was flushed w=
ith the light of early=20

dawn. The remainder of his task was quickly accomplished: he walked into th=
e starost=E2=80=99s cottage as=20

the family were sitting down to their morning meal of kasha, or stewed grai=
n.  Warm was the=20

welcome and great were the rejoicings that greeted his appearance. The poor=
 people had been=20

sorely terrified by the mysterious absence of their nursling, and they had =
sought him far and near,=20

through the birch-wood and the corn-fields, and even for some distance in t=
he waste. They were=20

preparing to renew the search that day with anxious and foreboding hearts. =
 Almost all Nicolofsky=20

crowded to the starost=E2=80=99s cottage to congratulate Ivan and to hear h=
is wonderful story. Certainly, he=20

had attained his object, if that object was to make himself the hero of the=
 village, and totally and=20

for ever to eclipse the exploits of Michael Ivanovitch!  But Ivan was no mo=
re the thoughtless little=20

lad who set out two days ago in search of adventures. His young heart had a=
wakened from the=20

sleep of childhood; new feelings, vague and dimly comprehended, were beginn=
ing to stir it. As he=20

trod his=20


_
pertaining to social betterment. The uplift of the refugees was made less d=
ifficult also by the self-

denying white persons who were their first teachers and missionaries. While=
 the hardships incident=20

to this pioneer effort all but baffled the ardent apostle to the lowly, he =
found among the Canadian=20

whites so much more sympathy than among the northerners that his work was m=
ore agreeable=20

and more successful than it would have been in the free States. Ignoring th=
e request that the=20

refugees be turned from Canada as undesirables, the white people of that co=
untry protected and=20

assisted them.[3] Canadians later underwent some change in their attitude t=
oward their=20

newcomers, but these British-Americans never exhibited such militant opposi=
tion to the Negroes=20

as sometimes developed in the Northern States.[4]  [Footnote 1: Siebert, _T=
he Underground=20

Railroad_, p. 222.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid._, pp. 247-250.]  [Footnote 3: Sieb=
ert, _The Underground=20

Railroad_, pp. 201 and 233.]  [Footnote 4: _Ibid._, 233.]  The educational =
privileges which the=20

refugees hoped to enjoy in Canada, however, were not easily exercised. Unde=
r the Canadian law=20

they could send their children to the common schools, or use their proporti=
onate share of the=20

school funds in providing other educational facilities.[1] But conditions t=
here did not at first redound=20

to the education of the colored children.[2] Some were too destitute to ava=
il themselves of these=20

opportunities; others, unaccustomed to this equality of fortune, were timid=
 about having their=20

children mingle with those of the whites, and not a few clad their youths s=
o poorly that they=20

became too unhealthy to attend regularly[3]. Besides, race prejudice was no=
t long in making itself=20

the most disturbing factor. In 1852 Benjamin Drew found the minds of the pe=
ople of Sandwich=20

much exercised over the question of admitting Negroes into the public schoo=
ls. The same feeling=20

was then almost as strong in Chatham, Hamilton, and London[4]. Consequently=
, "partly owing to=20

this prejudice, and partly to their own preference, the colored people, act=
ing under the provision of=20

the law that allowed them to have separate schools, set up their own school=
s in Sandwich and in=20

many other parts of Ontario"[5]. There were separate schools at Colchester,=
 Amherstburg,=20

Sandwich, Dawn, and Buxton[6]. It was doubtless because of the rude behavio=
r of white pupils=20

toward the children of the blacks that their private schools flourished at =
London, Windsor, and=20

other places[7]. The Negroes, themselves, however, did not object to the co=
education of the races.=20

Where there were a few white children in colored settlements they were admi=
tted to schools=20

maintained especially for pupils of African descent.[8] In Toronto no disti=
nction in educational=20

privileges was made, but in later years there flourished an evening school =
for adults of color.[9]=20

[Footnote 1: Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery_, p. 77.]  [Footnote 2: Drew =
said: "The prejudice=20

against the African race is here [Canada] strongly marked. It had not been =
customary to levy=20

school taxes on the colored people. Some three or four years since a truste=

tax on some of the wealthy citizens of that class. They sent their children=
 at once into the public=20

school. As these sat down the white children near them deserted the benches=
: and in a day or two=20

the white children were wholly withdrawn, leaving the schoolhouse to the te=

pupils. The matter was at last 'compromised': a notice 'Select School' was =

faint and far off, shone upon him from the face of the first boyar he had e=
ver seen, as it bent=20

anxiously and tenderly over the mujik=E2=80=99s senseless form--that to be =
greater than all the rest meant=20

his silver rouble he told no one, but he showed the gold piece that had bee=

pleasure, and asked the starost to make a hole in it, as he wished to keep =
it always, and to wear it=20

on the ribbon round his neck with the little iron cross put there at his ba=
ptism.  He told what the=20

priest had said to him, adding, however, =E2=80=9CBut of course he was mock=

schools, however, were not those maintained by the state. Travelers in Cana=
da found the colored=20

mission schools with a larger attendance and doing better work than those m=
aintained at public=20

expense.[1] The rise of the mission schools was due to the effort to "furni=
sh the conditions under=20

which whatever appreciation of education there was native in a community of=
 Negroes, or=20

whatever taste for it could be awakened there," might be "free to assert it=
self unhindered by real or=20

imagined opposition."[2] There were no such schools in 1830, but by 1838 ph=
ilanthropists had=20

established the first mission among the Canadian refugees.[3] The English C=
olonial Church and=20

School Society organized schools at London, Amherstburg, and Colchester. Ce=
rtain religious=20

organizations of the United States sent ten or more teachers to these settl=
ements.[4] In 1839=20

these workers were conducting four schools while Rev. Hiram Wilson, their i=
nspector, probably=20

had several other institutions under his supervision.[5] In 1844 Levi Coffi=
n found a large school at=20

Isaac Rice's mission at Fort Maiden or Amherstburg.[6] Rice had toiled amon=
g these people six=20

years, receiving very little financial aid, and suffering unusual hardships=
.[7] Mr. E. Child, a=20

graduate of Oneida Institute, was later added to the corps of mission teach=
ers.[8] In 1852 Mrs.=20

Laura S. Haviland was secured to teach the school of the colony of "Refugee=
s' Home," where the=20

colored people had built a structure "for school and meeting purposes."[9] =
On Sundays the=20

schoolhouses and churches were crowded by eager seekers, many of whom lived=
 miles away.=20

Among these earnest students a traveler saw an aged couple more than eighty=
 years old.[10]=20

These elementary schools broke the way for a higher institution at Dawn, kn=
own as the Manual=20

Labor Institute.  [Footnote 1: Drew, _A North-side View of Slavery_, pp. 11=

year.  During this silent, dreary season the industrious fingers of the gir=

occupation in spinning and weaving. The lads too made lapti, wove rude bask=
ets, and prepared=20

firewood; and these occupations were often pursued in social gatherings, an=
d lightened with jest=20

and song and story. Still there was abundant leisure, in which the young pe=

themselves with games of babshky--little pieces of mutton bone, which they =
used as English=20

other villages, since the starost and the pope were both temperate men and =
set a good example.=20

They were great friends, and during their long confidential talks one quest=
ion often came=20

uppermost, What was to be done with Ivan when he grew up? In a country like=
 Russia, where=20



sons almost invariably followed the calling of their fathers, and every man=
=E2=80=99s position was assigned=20

him by the fact of his birth, it was peculiarly difficult to find a niche f=
or a waif like Ivan. A mujik, of=20

course, he could never be; nor a priest, since he was not a popovitch, or p=
riest=E2=80=99s son; nor a=20

merchant, that would have been a terrible degradation for one who was born =
a boyar; nor a=20

soldier, for his village friends had not the influence necessary to procure=
 him a commission, while=20

had he been drawn for a recruit they would at once have provided a substitu=
te. But Ivan was not=20

old enough to share these perplexities. The knowledge that he was by birth =
a boyar, with the=20

desire, sincere though ignorant and wavering, to be worthy of his destiny, =
sufficed him for the=20

present.  Thus two long winters passed away. A second spring had come, hera=
lded by the eight=20

days of drinking and carousing which the Russians call the M=C3=A4sslanitza=

the long fast went slowly by. At last came the crown of the Russian year, w=
