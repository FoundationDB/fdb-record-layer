to this that Greece, the "later cradle of the arts and sciences,"     and I=
ndia, cradle of religions,=20

were, and one of them still is,     devoted to its study and practice--and =
who shall venture to=20

discredit its dignity as a study, and its profundity as a     science?(39) =
  No true Theosophist will=20

ever do so. For, as a member of our great Oriental body, he knows indubitab=
ly that the Secret=20

Doctrine of the East contains the Alpha and the Omega of Universal Science;=
 that in its obscure=20

texts, under the luxuriant, though perhaps too exuberant, growth of allegor=
ical Symbolism, lie=20

concealed the corner- and the key-stones of all ancient and modern knowledg=
e. That Stone,=20

brought down by the Divine Builder, is now rejected by the too-human workma=
n, and this because,=20

in his lethal materiality, man has lost every recollection, not only of his=
 holy childhood, but of his=20

very adolescence, when he was one of the Builders himself; when "the mornin=
g stars sang=20

together, and the Sons of God shouted for joy," after they had laid the mea=
sures for the=20

foundations of the earth--to use the deeply significant and poetical langua=
ge of Job, the Arabian=20

Initiate. But those who are still able to make room in their innermost selv=
es for the Divine Ray, and=20

who accept, therefore, the data of the Secret Sciences in good faith and hu=
mility, they know well=20

that it is in this Stone that remains buried the absolute in Philosophy, wh=
ich is the key to all those=20

dark problems of Life and Death, some of which, at any rate, may find an ex=
planation in these=20

volumes.  The writer is vividly alive to the tremendous difficulties that p=
resent themselves in the=20

handling of such abstruse questions, and to all the dangers of the task. In=
sulting as it is to human=20

nature to brand truth with the name of imposture, nevertheless we see this =
done daily and accept=20

it. For every occult truth has to pass through such denial and its supporte=
rs through martyrdom,=20

before it is finally accepted; though even then it remains but too often-- =
                                        A=20

crown     Golden in show, yet but a wreath of thorns.   Truths that rest on=
 Occult mysteries will=20

have, for one reader who may appreciate them, a thousand who will brand the=
m as impostures.=20

This is only natural, and the only means to avoid it would be for an Occult=
ist to pledge himself to=20

the Pythagorean "vow of silence," and renew it every five years. Otherwise,=
 cultured society--two-

thirds of which think themselves in duty bound to believe that, since the f=
irst appearance of the first=20

Adept, one half of mankind practised deception and fraud on the other half-=
-cultured society will=20

undeniably assert its hereditary and traditional right to stone the intrude=
r. Those benevolent critics,=20

who most readily promulgate the now famous axiom of Carlyle with regard to =
his countrymen, of=20

being "mostly fools," having taken preliminary care to include themselves s=
afely in the only=20

fortunate exceptions to this rule, will in this work gain strength and deri=
ve additional conviction of=20

the sad fact, that the human race is simply composed of knaves and congenit=
al idiots. But this=20

matters very little. The vindication of the Occultists and their Archaic Sc=
ience is working itself=20

slowly but steadily into the very heart of society, hourly, daily, and year=
ly, in the shape of two=20

monster branches, two stray off-shoots of the trunk of Magic--Spiritualism =
and the Roman Church.=20

Fact works its way very often through fiction. Like an immense boa-constric=
tor, Error, in every=20

shape, encircles mankind, trying to smother in her deadly coils every aspir=
ation towards truth and=20

light. But Error is powerful only on the surface, prevented as she is by Oc=
cult Nature from going=20

any deeper; for the same Occult Nature encircles the whole globe, in every =
direction, leaving not=20

even the darkest corner unvisited. And, whether by phenomenon or miracle, b=
y spirit-hook or=20

bishop's crook, Occultism must win the day, before the present era reaches =
"Shani's (Saturn's)=20

triple septenary" of the Western Cycle in Europe, in other words--before th=
e end of the twenty-first=20



century "A.D."  Truly the soil of the long by-gone past is not dead, for it=
 has only rested. The=20

skeletons of the sacred oaks of the ancient Druids may still send shoots fr=
om their dried-up=20

boughs and be reborn to a new life, like that handful of corn, in the sarco=
phagus of a mummy=20

4,000 years old, which, when planted, sprouted, grew, and "gave a fine harv=
est." Why not? Truth=20

is stranger than fiction. It may any day, and most unexpectedly, vindicate =
its wisdom and=20

demonstrate the conceit of our age, by proving that the Secret Brotherhood =
did not, indeed, die out=20

with the Philalethians of the last Eclectic School, that the Gnosis flouris=
hes still on earth, and its=20

votaries are many, albeit unknown. All this may be done by one, or more, of=
 the great Masters=20

visiting Europe, and exposing in their turn the alleged exposers and traduc=
ers of Magic. Such=20

secret Brotherhoods have been mentioned by several well-known authors, and =
are spoken of in=20

Mackenzie's _Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia_. The writer now, in the face of the=
 millions who deny,=20

repeats boldly, that which was said in _Isis Unveiled_.       If they [the =
Initiates] have been=20

regarded as mere fictions of the     novelist, that fact has only helped th=
e "brother-adepts" to keep=20

their incognito the more easily....      The St. Germains and Cagliostros o=
f this century, having=20

learned     bitter lessons from the vilifications and persecutions of the  =
   past, pursue different=20

tactics now-a-days.(40)   These prophetic words were written in 1876, and v=
erified in 1886.=20

Nevertheless, we say again,       There are numbers of these mystic Brother=
hoods which have=20

naught     to do with "civilized" countries; and it is in their unknown    =
 communities that are=20

concealed the skeletons of the past. These     "adepts" could, if they chos=
e, lay claim to strange=20

ancestry, and     exhibit verifiable documents that would explain many a my=
sterious     page in both=20

sacred and profane history.(41) Had the keys to the     hieratic writings a=
nd the secret of Egyptian=20

and Hindu symbolism     been known to the Christian Fathers, they would not=
 have allowed a=20

single monument of old to stand unmutilated.(42)   But there exists in the =
world another class of=20

adepts, belonging to a brotherhood also, and mightier than any other of tho=
se known to the=20

profane. Many among these are personally good and benevolent, even pure and=
 holy=20

occasionally, as individuals. Pursuing collectively, however, and as a body=
, a selfish, one-sided=20

object, with relentless vigour and determination, they have to be ranked wi=
th the adepts of the=20

Black Art. These are our modern Roman Catholic "fathers" and clergy. Most o=
f the hieratic writings=20

and symbols have been deciphered by them since the Middle Ages. A hundred t=
imes more=20

learned in secret Symbology and the old Religions than our Orientalists wil=
l ever be, the=20

personification of astuteness and cleverness, every such adept in the art h=
olds the keys tightly in=20

his firmly clenched hand, and will take care the secret shall not be easily=
 divulged, if he can help it.=20

There are more profoundly learned Kabalists in Rome and throughout Europe a=
nd America, than=20

is generally suspected. Thus are the professedly public "brotherhoods" of "=
black" adepts more=20

powerful and dangerous for Protestant countries than any host of Eastern Oc=
cultists. People laugh=20

at Magic! Men of Science, Physiologists and Biologists, deride the potency =
and even the belief in=20

the existence of what is called in vulgar parlance "Sorcery" and "Black Mag=
ic"! The Archaeologists=20

have their Stonehenge in England with its thousands of secrets, and its twi=
n-brother Karnac of=20

Brittany, and yet there is not one of them who even suspects what has been =
going on in its crypts,=20

and its mysterious nooks and corners, for the last century. More than that,=
 they do not even know=20

of the existence of such "magic halls" in their Stonehenge, where curious s=
cenes are taking place,=20

whenever there is a new convert in view. Hundreds of experiments have been,=
 and are being=20



made daily at the Salpetriere, and also by learned hypnotisers at their pri=
vate houses. It is now=20

proved that certain sensitives--both men and women--when commanded in tranc=
e, by the=20

practitioner, who operates on them, to do a certain thing--from drinking a =
glass of water up to=20

simulated murder--on recovering their normal state lose all remembrance of =
the order inspired--

"suggested" it is now called by Science. Nevertheless, at the appointed hou=
r and moment, the=20

subject, though conscious and perfectly awake, is compelled by an irresisti=
ble power cord. Death=20

was sudden and complete. The drop in these cases was short, three to four f=
eet. Coutagne thinks=20

that the ordinary mobility of the head, axis, and atlas on each other have =
led reporters into the=20

mistake of supposing a dislocation of vertebr=C3=A6. Roth failed to find fr=
acture of vertebr=C3=A6 in any of 49=20

cases. These injuries are especially rare in suicide; but in violent hangin=
g, dislocation or fracture=20

may occur and also rupture of the ligaments. Harvey gives 5 cases of disloc=
ation of vertebra and 4=20

of fracture of vertebra in suicides. Three of the latter were doubtful. Tar=
dieu says these fractures=20

have no significance as to the hanging having occurred during life. They ca=
n be produced on the=20

cadaver; but infiltration of clotted blood around injured vertebr=C3=A6 sho=
ws that suspension occurred=20

during life (Cases 5, 7, 8, 68, 76 to 79, 83, 84, 91, 92, 94).[862]  The CA=
ROTID ARTERIES may=20

be injured; usually the inner and middle coats are torn; and hemorrhage may=
 occur into the wall of=20

the vessel. The common carotids are the ones usually affected, and just bel=
ow the bifurcation, but=20

the external is also occasionally injured. The injury is said to be due to =
the stretching and=20

squeezing of the artery, stretching being the most effective since the rupt=
ure often occurs at a=20

distance from the mark of the ligature. Such injury of the artery does not =
prove that hanging took=20

place during life because it has been produced on the cadaver; but hemorrha=
ge into the wall of the=20

vessel or wound or rupture after death is very improbable. Maschka says the=
 lesion is very rare.=20

Tardieu says that the injury to the carotid is rare and therefore unimporta=
nt. Pellier reports 4 cases=20

of rupture of carotid in a total of 23. Levy records the experiments of Hof=
mann, of Vienna, and=20

Brouardel and himself, of Paris, 5 in number. He concluded that compression=
 of the carotid=20

arteries, if it produces obliteration, can cause rapid loss of consciousnes=
s and death; and explains=20

why in incomplete suicide the subject is unable to help himself. Coutagne f=
ound rupture of carotids=20

10 times in 24 cases. He insists on the importance of the lesion.   Hofmann=
[863] says the rupture=20

is always transverse, may be simple  or multiple and may occur in suicides;=
 more apt to occur=20

when the  ligature is thin. Lesser[864] tabulated 50 fatal cases of suicida=
l  hanging; in 29, he was=20

satisfied that the hanging occurred during  life. In 3 of these the skin of=
 the neck alone showed any=20

lesion;  there was a double mark, the skin being otherwise bloodless. In 5 =
 the deeper soft parts=20

were the only ones affected. In 3 the skin  showed lesions, the deeper soft=
 parts none, but either=20

the hyoid  bone, larynx, or vertebr=C3=A6 were involved. In 12 the skin sho=
wed no  mark, but the deeper=20

soft parts and either the larynx or hyoid bone  were involved; and in 6 the=
 hyoid bone only or the=20

bone and larynx  were injured. In the remaining cases it was not possible t=
o say that  the hanging=20

occurred during life. In 2 cases there were no marks at  all; in 9 there we=
re changes in the skin; in=20

4, changes in the skin  and deeper parts; in 2, changes in the skin, deeper=
 parts, and hyoid  bone=20

or larynx; in 3, changes in the skin and hyoid bone or larynx,  or both. In=
 14 of the 50 cases the=20

hyoid bone was fractured; in 20  the larynx; and in 1 the vertebr=C3=A6. Th=
e common carotid arteries=20

were  injured in 6. The number and severity of the lesions bore no constant=
  relation to the=20

thickness of the ligature, nor to the force used, but  rather to the positi=
on of the body.   Ecker[865]=20



reported a case of suicidal hanging in a man, age 40, where  the soft palat=
e was swollen and filled=20

up the passage so that the air  evidently could not enter.  The LARYNX and =
the TRACHEA are=20

usually deeply congested, of a red color; a violet color indicates putrefac=
tion. Ogston reports=20

mucus but not bloody froth 9 times in the pharynx, 6 in the trachea, and 4 =
in the lungs, in a total of=20

40 cases. In one case there was a quantity of blood in the larynx and phary=
nx. Taylor thinks that=20

pinkish froth in the trachea indicates incomplete obstruction; and Chevers =
that it is due to=20

spasmodic efforts to breathe when the obstruction is nearly complete. Cheve=
rs always found clear=20

mucus in the larynx and upper part of trachea, each follicle being marked b=
y a minute globule of=20

mucus. Harvey states that this was noted a few times in his reports. Baraba=
n[866] discusses the=20

condition of the epithelium of the air passages in hanging.  The condition =
of the lungs and heart=20

varies according to whether death is due to syncope or asphyxia. Ogston fou=
nd, in 22 cases, the=20

lungs were expanded in 4 and collapsed in 2.  Harvey says the LUNGS are con=
gested in over=20

seven-eighths of the cases; emphysematous in a few; and subpleural ecchymos=
es present in a=20

few. Patenko[867] experimented on dogs by hanging them. When the constricti=
on occurred after=20

expiration the lungs were congested; when after inspiration, not congested.=
 In the first case (p.=20

223) the blood flows from the periphery to the heart and thence to the lung=
s, but cannot flow from=20

the lungs because of the difficult circulation in the dilated pulmonary ves=
sels and deficiency of=20

intrathoracic pressure. There is in both cases cerebral congestion in the r=
egion of the bulb.=20

Tardieu holds that punctiform ecchymoses and apoplexies do not occur in han=
ging unless=20

suffocation has preceded. Pellier,[868] however, found these ecchymoses 14 =
times in 22 cases.=20

He says that the lesion is not characteristic of suffocation, and quotes La=
cassagne, Grosclaude,=20

Dechoudans, Vicq, Chassaing, and Legroux to the same purpose. Hofmann[869] =
says that the=20

ecchymoses are relatively rare in adults. Maschka[870] found them 18 times =
in 153 cases.  Harvey=20

states that the presence of serum in the PERICARDIUM seems more a matter of=
 time elapsed=20

after death than anything else. Still the fact is that it is found much oft=
ener in strangulation than in=20

hanging. The difference is explained by the comparative slowness of death i=
n strangulation.=20

Harvey finds that in about one-half of the cases, if the body is fresh, the=
 right side of the HEART,=20

pulmonary artery, and ven=C3=A6 cav=C3=A6 are full of dark fluid blood, the=
 lungs being also much=20

congested, and the signs of death by asphyxia well marked. When blood is fo=
und in both sides of=20

the heart, it is probable that death is due to neuro-paralysis. When decomp=
osition is advanced all=20

the cavities are often empty. Taylor says that if the examination is delaye=
d for several days, the=20

distention may not be observed.  The STOMACH is often much congested, and t=
his fact might=20

sometimes suggest the possibility of poisoning. The LIVER, SPLEEN, and KIDN=
EYS are usually=20

much congested. Hofmann[871] says that this occurs in the kidney only when =
the body has been=20

hung a long time.  The BRAIN is rarely much congested. In 101 cases Remer f=
ound hemorrhage=20

but once; and in 106 cases Casper failed to find it. Tardieu[872] says the =
brain is oftenest an=C3=A6mic.=20

If, however, the body is cut down and placed horizontally, the blood-vessel=
s of the brain may fill=20

up. Evidence may be found in the brain suggesting insanity and therefore an=
 explanation of a=20

probable suicide. Harvey says that hemorrhages in or about the brain are fo=
und in a much larger=20

proportion of cases in India than in Europe in cases of hanging. =E2=80=9CN=
o common condition likely to=20

cause extravasation is apparent, only one man being noted as plethoric, but=
 in many the rope=20

seems to have been very tight.=E2=80=9D Champouillon[873] reports a case of=
 suicide in a man, age fifty-



two; the rope broke and the body fell. The physician who made the necroscop=
y reported a rupture=20

of the _pons Varolii_. Champouillon believed that the rupture must have bee=
n made in removing=20

the brain from the skull. Wilkie[874] reports a judicial hanging in which a=
 man age about twenty-

five, fell about three and one-half feet. A recent clot was found in the br=
ain. The experiments of=20

Brouardel of hanging rabbits showed the brain an=C3=A6mic.  The conjunction=
 of the following=20

appearances would suggest that the hanging had been of some duration: livid=
ity of face,=20

congestion and prominence of eyes, dryness of skin under the ligature, deep=
 furrow, congestion of=20

sexual organs, swelling and lividity of lower limbs, hypostatic congestion =
of lungs.   Page=20

experimented on a young cat and young dog; both were hung in the  same way.=
 Examination of=20

the cat showed the veins generally engorged;  sublingual veins much engorge=
d; tongue protruded=20

slightly and much  swollen; no frothy mucus in bronchi. In the dog the tong=
ue did not  protrude and=20

was not swollen; right cavities of heart contained blood,  left empty; brai=
n and other organs normal.=20

In the=20


_
action which has been suggested to him by his mesmeriser; and that too, wha=
tever it may be, and=20

whatever the period fixed by him who controls the subject, that is to say, =
holds the latter under the=20

power of his will, as a snake holds a bird under its fascination, and final=
ly forces it to jump into its=20

open jaws. Worse than this: for the bird is conscious of the peril; it resi=
sts, however helpless in its=20

final efforts, while the hypnotized subject does not rebel, but seems to fo=
llow the suggestions and=20

voice of his own free-will and soul. Who of our European men of Science, wh=
o believe in such=20

_scientific_ experiments--and very few are they who still doubt them now-a-=
days, and who do not=20

feel convinced of their actual reality--who of them, it is asked, is ready =
to admit this as being Black=20

Magic? Yet it is the _genuine_, undeniable and actual _fascination_ and _so=
rcery_ of old. The=20

Mulu Kurumbas of Nilgiri do not proceed otherwise in their _envoutements_ w=
hen they seek to=20

destroy an enemy, nor do the Dugpas of Sikkim and Bhutan know of any more p=
otential agent=20

than their _will_. Only in them that will does not proceed by  uniformly co=
ngested, dark red; no=20

ecchymoses. In the dog, the lungs  were much distended, posterior borders m=
ottled violet;=20

emphysematous  patches on surface; no apoplectic effusions; subpleural ecch=
ymoses  bright red,=20

irregular, clearly defined in outer surface, most numerous  toward the root=
s and on the lower=20

lobes.   Pellereau[875] gives an account of hanging as seen by him in warm =
 climates. He had not=20

seen the elongation of the neck described nor the  erection of the penis, n=
or subconjunctival=20

ecchymoses, nor fracture  of larynx, nor rupture of walls of carotid artery=
, nor subpleural=20

ecchymoses, nor fracture of vertebra. He always found a mark on the  neck; =
the left cavities of the=20

heart always empty, the right always  full of black blood. Mackenzie says t=
hat in 130 cases of=20

suicidal  hanging, the protrusion of the tongue between the teeth, the open=
 and  protruding eyes,=20

clinched hands, and blue nails were very frequent,  the tongue was found bi=
tten many times, there=20

were urethral and  rectal discharges and rupture of carotid artery. The pen=
is was found  erect=20

several times. The hyoid bone fractured 24 times in 93=20


_
certainty; it does not depend on the amount of receptivity or nervous impre=
ssibility of the "subject."=20

Having chosen his victim and placed himself _en rapport_ with him, the Dugp=
a's "fluid" is sure to=20

find its way, for his will is immeasurably more strongly developed than the=
 will of the European=20

experimenter--the self-made, untutored, and _unconscious_ Sorcerer for the =
sake of Science--who=20

has no idea (or belief either) of the variety and potency of the world-old =
methods used to develop=20

this power, by the _conscious_ sorcerer, the "Black Magician" of the East a=
nd West.  And now the=20

question is openly and squarely asked: Why should not the fanatical and zea=
lous priest, thirsting=20

to convert some selected rich and influential member of society, use the sa=
me means to=20

accomplish his end as the French Physician and experimenter uses in his cas=
e with his subject?=20

The conscience of the Roman Catholic priest is most likely at peace. He wor=
ks _personally_ for no=20

selfish purpose, but with the object of "saving a soul" from "eternal damna=
tion." In his view, if=20

Magic there be in it, it is holy, meritorious and divine Magic. Such is the=
 power of blind faith.=20

Hence, when we are assured by trustworthy and respectable persons of high s=
ocial standing, and=20

unimpeachable character, that there are many well- organised societies amon=
g the Roman=20

Catholic priests which, under the pretext and cover of Modern Spiritualism =
and mediumship, hold=20

_seances_ for the purposes of conversion by suggestion, directly and at a d=
istance--we answer:=20

We know it. And when, moreover, we are told that whenever those priest-hypn=
otists are desirous=20

of acquiring an influence over some individual or individuals, selected by =
them for conversion, they=20

retire to an underground place, allotted and consecrated by them for such p=
urposes (_viz._,=20
