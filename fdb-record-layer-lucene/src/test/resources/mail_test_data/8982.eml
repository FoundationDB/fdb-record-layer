I beseech Your Highness, for the service of God, to provide that the relief=
 and freedom which His=20

Majesty granted to the Indians in the island of Cuba may be made effective,=
 before those who hold=20

BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, _Bishop._     In spite of all the anti-slavery le=
gislation enacted,=20

there were actually at that time a number of Indians held as slaves in Sevi=
lle itself, and before=20

starting for his distant diocese, Las Casas undertook as his first duty to =
secure their liberation.  His=20

action aroused much of the ancient enmity against him, but to that he was i=
ndifferent: the text of=20

the New Laws was explicit, leaving no opening for false construction.  Succ=
ess crowned his efforts=20

and enabled him to leave, fully satisfied, for San Lucar de Barrameda where=
 his friars were waiting=20

for him to embark. He there celebrated the feast of Corpus Domini with grea=
t pomp, and during the=20

time occupied in his final preparations, he and his friars received many do=
nations of necessaries.=20

The fleet of twenty-seven ships, amongst large and small only awaited the a=
rrival of Dona Maria=20

de Toledo widow of the Admiral Don Diego Columbus, who was to sail for Hisp=
aniola to safeguard=20

the rights of her children in some disputed questions of inheritance and up=
on her arrival, it=20

immediately put to sea on July l0th. The new Bishop, with his faithful comp=
anion Ladrada and=20

forty-five Dominican friars, embarked on the _San Salvador_.  On that same =
date he entered into=20

possession of his meagre episcopal revenues, for an ordinance that had been=
 passed to oblige=20

the bishops of American dioceses to stay in them, established that their in=
comes should begin=20

from the date of their sailing. (56)  This proving insufficient, as there w=
ere some who were satisfied=20

with their episcopal dignity and preferred to remain in Spain, it was after=
wards provided that their=20

consecration must take place in America.      CHAPTER XVI. - LETTER TO PHIL=
IP II.  VOYAGE=20

TO AMERICA.  FEELING IN THE COLONIES.  ARRIVAL IN CHIAPA   Before sailing t=
o take=20

possession of his diocese, Las Casas addressed the following letter of fare=
well to Prince Philip=20

(afterwards was young, and courted me.  It is as if the Gods were fain to s=
ee the best man that=20

they ever took to themselves, walk before them a second time upon earth."  =
"Yes, my lady," said=20

the black slave; "no mortal eye ever saw such a likeness.  I saw him fighti=
ng in front of the=20

paraschites' cottage, and he was more like my dead master than ever.  He sw=
ung the tent-post=20

over his head, as my lord used to swing his battle-axe."  "Be silent,"  cri=
ed  Paaker, "and  get out-

idiot!  The priest is like my father; I grant it, mother; but he is an inso=
lent fellow, who offended me=20

grossly, and with whom I have to reckon--as with many others."  "How violen=
t you are!"=20



interrupted his mother, "and how full of bitterness and hatred.  Your fathe=
r was so sweet-

tempered, and kind to everybody."  "Perhaps they are kind to me?"  retorted=
 Paaker with a short=20

laugh. "Even the Immortals spite me, and throw thorns in my path.  But I wi=
ll push them aside with=20

my own hand, and will attain what I desire without the help of the Gods and=
 overthrow all that=20

oppose me."  "We cannot blow away a feather without the help of the Immorta=
ls," answered=20

Setchem.  "So your father used to say, who was a very different man both in=
 body and mind from=20

you!  I tremble before you this evening, and at the curses you have uttered=
 against the children of=20

your lord and sovereign, your father's best friend."  "But my enemy," shout=
ed Paaker.  "You will get=20

nothing from me but curses.  And the brood of Rameses shall learn whether y=
our husband's son=20

will let himself be ill-used and scorned without revenging him self. I will=
 fling them into an abyss,=20

and I will laugh when I see them writhing in the sand at my feet!"  "Fool!"=
  cried Setchem, beside=20

herself.  "I am but a woman, and have often blamed myself for being soft an=
d weak; but as sure as=20

I am faithful to your dead father--who you are no more like than a bramble =
is like a palm-tree--so=20

surely will I tear my love for you out of my heart if you --if you--Now I s=
ee! now I know!  Answer=20

me-murderer!  Where are the seven arrows with the wicked words which used t=
o hang here?=20

Where are the arrows  on which you had scrawled 'Death to Mena?'"  With the=
se words Setchem=20

breathlessly started forward, but the pioneer drew back as she confronted h=
im, as in his youthful=20

days when she threatened to punish him for some misdemeanor.  She followed =
him up, caught=20

him by the girdle, and in a hoarse voice repeated her question. He stood st=
ill, snatched her hand=20

angrily from his belt, and said defiantly:  "I have put them in my quiver--=
and not for mere play.=20

Now you know."  Incapable of words, the maddened woman once more raised her=
 hand against=20

her degenerate son, but he put back her arm.  "I am no longer a child," he =
said, "and I am master=20

of this house.  I will do what I will, if a hundred women hindered me!"  an=
d with these words he=20

pointed to the door.  Setchem broke into loud sobs, and turned her back upo=
n him; but at the door=20

once more she turned to look at him. He had seated himself, and was resting=
 his forehead on the=20

table on which the bowl of cold water stood.  Setchem fought a hard battle.=
  At last once more=20

through her choking tears she called his name, opened her arms wide and exc=
laimed:  "Here I am-

-here I am!  Come to my heart, only give up these hideous thoughts of reven=
ge."  But Paaker did=20

not move, he did not=20


_
then governing in the name of the Emperor, his father:     VERY HIGH AND VE=
RY POTENT=20

LORD: I received two letters simultaneously from Your Highness: the date of=
 the last was April 1st=20

and accompanying it was the Royal cedula concerning the passage from Hispan=
iola to Honduras=20

for the monks whom Your Highness is sending to those provinces.  For all of=
 which I kiss your=20

Royal hands and for your kindness in granting that the bulls should be sent=
 so promptly as to=20

reach me in time to serve at my consecration, which, by divine grace, took =
place here in San=20

Pablo on Passion Sunday as I already wrote Your Highness the day after.  I =
trust to God our Lord=20

that this dignity, to which, by divine Providence, our lord and sovereign t=
he Emperor has he only=20

shook his head in negation.  Setchem's hands fell, and she said softly:  "W=
hat did your father=20

teach you out of the scriptures?  'Your highest praise consists in this, to=
 reward your mother for=20

what she has done for you, in bringing you up, so that she may not raise he=
r hands to God, nor He=20

hear her lamentation.'"  At these words, Paaker sobbed aloud, but he did no=
t look at his mother.=20

She called him tenderly by his name; then her eyes fell on his quiver, whic=
h lay on a bench with=20

other arms.  Her heart shrunk within her, and with a trembling voice she ex=
claimed:  "I forbid this=20

mad vengeance--do you hear?  Will you give it up?  You do not move?  No!  y=
ou will not!  Ye=20

Gods, what can I do?"  She wrung her hands in despair; then=20
