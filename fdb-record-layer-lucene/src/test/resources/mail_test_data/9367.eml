The wheel, being turned by oxen, delivers the water into a trough which pas=
ses into a reservoir,=20

roughly fashioned with clay, from which, small channels of about ten inches=
 in width radiate=20

through the plantation. The fields, divided into squares like a chess-board=
, are thus irrigated by a=20

succession of minute aqueducts. The root of this principle is the reservoir=
. A certain steady volume=20

of water is required, from which the arteries shall flow throughout a large=
 area of dry ground; thus,=20

the reservoir insures a regular supply to each separate channel.  In any ci=
vilized country, the=20

existence of which depended upon the artificial supply of water in the  At =
that moment, there was a=20

great crash, followed by a loud cry, and a cheer from the multitude, as the=
 roof fell in, sending up a=20

magnificent burst of sparks and flame, in the midst of which Ned Crashingto=
n was borne from the=20

field of battle.  While this scene was going on, Mrs Crashington and her br=
other were still seated=20

quietly enjoying their tea--at least, enjoying it as much as such character=
s can be said to enjoy=20

anything.  When Ned had gone out, as before mentioned, Phil remarked:--  "I=
 wouldn't rouse him=20

like that, Mag, if I was you."  "But he's so aggravatin'," pleaded Mrs Cras=
hington.  "He ain't half so=20

aggravatin' as _you_ are," replied Phil, gruffly.  "I don't understand your=
 temper at all.  You take all=20

the hard words _I_ give you as meek as a lamb, but if _he_ only offers to o=
pen his mouth you fly at=20

him like a turkey-cock.  However,=20


_
engineering principle would suggest a saving of labour in irrigation: that,=
 instead of raising the=20

water in small quantities into reservoirs, the river should raise its own w=
aters to the required level.=20

tell me before you go, what sort of employment you've got?"  "No," replied =
Phil, shortly.  "Why not,=20

Phil?"  "Because I don't want you to know, and I don't want your husband to=
 know."  "But I won't=20
