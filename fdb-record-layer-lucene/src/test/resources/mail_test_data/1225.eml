philodendron monstera domesticated, but we have no account of a negro tribe=
 that has ever tamed one of these sagacious animals: their only maxim is "k=
ill and eat." Although the flesh of the elephant is extremely coarse, the f=
oot and trunk are excellent, if properly cooked. A hole should be dug in th=
e earth, about four feet deep, and describe it.  When the driver mounted hi=
s box, the others sprang on the engine. Crack! went the whip, fire flew fro=
m the paving-stones, fire poured from the furnace, the spirited steeds tore=
 round the corner into Regent Street, and off they went to the fire, in the=
 dark winter morning, like a monster rocket or a philodendron monstera dome=
sticated, but we have no account of a negro tribe that has ever tamed one o=
f these sagacious animals: their only maxim is "kill and eat." Although the=
 flesh of the elephant is extremely coarse, the foot and trunk are excellen=
t, if properly cooked. A hole should be dug in the earth, about four feet d=
eep, and describe it.  When the driver mounted his box, the others sprang o=
n the engine. Crack! went the whip, fire flew from the paving-stones, fire =
poured from the furnace, the spirited steeds tore round the corner into Reg=
ent Street, and off they went to the fire, in the dark winter morning, like=
 a monster rocket or a _
spine above the hips. The two species are not only distinct in certain pecu=
liarities of form, but they=20

differ in their habits. The Indian elephant dislikes the sun, and invariabl=
y retreats to thick shady=20

forests at sunrise; but I have constantly found the African species enjoyin=
g themselves in the=20

burning sun in the hottest hours of the day, among plains of withered grass=
, many miles from a=20

jungle. The African is more active than the Indian, and not only is faster =
in his movements, but is=20

more capable of enduring long marches, as proved by the great distances thr=
ough which it travels=20

to seek its food in the native's corn-fields. In all countries, the bulls a=
re fiercer than the females. I=20

cannot see much difference in character between the Indian and the African =
species; it is the=20

fashion for some people to assert that the elephant is an innocent and harm=
less creature, that, like=20

the giraffe it is almost a sin to destroy. I can only say that, during eigh=
t years' experience in=20

Ceylon, and nearly five years' in Africa, I have found that elephants are t=
he most formidable=20

animals with which a sportsman has to contend. The African species is far m=
ore dangerous than=20

the Indian, as the forehead shot can never be trusted; therefore the hunter=
 must await the charge=20

with a conviction that his bullet will fail to kill.  The African elephant =
is about a foot higher than the=20

average of the Indian species. The bulls of the former are about ten feet s=
ix inches at the shoulder;=20

the females are between nine feet and nine feet six. Of course there are ma=
ny bulls that exceed=20

this height, and I have seen some few of both species that might equal twel=
ve feet, but those are=20

the not begun to move.  Presently to these sounds were added another very d=
istant sound which=20

induced Mary to stop and listen.  "A late cab," she whispered to herself.  =
The rumbling of the late=20

cab became more distinct, and soon proved it to be a hurried cab.  To Mary'=
s accustomed ear this=20

raised some disagreeable idea.  She cast a look of anxiety into the closet,=
 wiped her hands=20

quickly, and taking up a pair of dry boots which had been standing near the=
 fire, placed them=20

beside her husband's coat. This was barely accomplished when the hurried ca=
b was heard to pull=20

up at the neighbouring fire-station.  Only a few seconds elapsed when racin=
g footsteps were heard=20

outside.  Mary seized her husband's arm--  "Up, Joe, up," she cried and dar=
ted across the room,=20

leaped on a chair, and laid violent hands on the tongue of the door-bell, t=
hereby preventing a=20

furious double ring from disturbing the rosebud!  At the first word "up," t=
he bed in the closet=20

groaned and creaked as the fireman bounded from it, and the house shook as =
he alighted on the=20

floor.  Next moment he appeared buttoning his braces, and winking like an o=
wl in sunshine.  One=20

moment sufficed to pull on the right boot, another moment affixed the left.=
  Catching up his half-

dried coat with one hand, and flinging on his sailor's cap with the other, =
he darted from the house,=20

thrust himself into his coat as he ran along and appeared at the station ju=
st as four of his=20

comrades drew the fire-engine up to the door, while two others appeared wit=
h three horses, which=20

they harnessed thereto--two abreast, one in front--with marvellous rapidity=
.  The whole affair, from=20

the "Up, Joe, up," of Mrs Dashwood, to the harnessing of=20


_
The tusks of elephants vary considerably, and there appears to be no rule t=
o determine a reason=20

for their size and quality. In Abyssinia and Taka, a single tusk of a bull =
elephant seldom exceeds=20

forty pounds, nor do they average more than twenty-five, but in Central Afr=
ica they average about=20

forty, and I have seen them upwards of one hundred and fifty pounds. The la=
rgest that I have had=20

the good fortune to bag was eighty pounds; the fellow-tusk was slightly bel=
ow seventy. Elephants=20

invariably use one tusk in preference, as we use the right hand; thus it is=
 difficult to obtain an exact=20

pair, as the Hadam (or servant), as the Arabs call the working tusk, is gen=
erally much worn. The=20

African elephant is a more decided tree-feeder than the Indian, and the des=
truction committed by a=20

large herd of such animals when feeding in a mimosa forest is extraordinary=
; they deliberately=20

march forward, and uproot or break down every tree that excites their appet=
ite. The mimosas are=20

generally from sixteen to twenty feet high, and, minutes.  By that time Joe=
 and several of his mates=20

stood ready belted, and armed with brass helmets on their heads, which flas=
hed back the rays of=20

the neighbouring street lamp and the engine lanterns.  There was wonderfull=
y little noise or fuss,=20

although there was so much display of promptitude and energy; the reason be=
ing that all the men=20

were thoroughly drilled, and each had his particular duty to perform; there=
 was, therefore, no room=20

for orders, counter-orders, or confusion.  The moment the call was given, B=
ob Clazie, having=20

received no telegraphic "stop," had at once run to ring up the men, who, li=
ke Dashwood, had been=20

sleeping close at hand.  He rang up the driver of the engine first.  At the=
 same moment his=20

comrade on duty had run round to the stable, where the horses stood ready h=
arnessed, and=20

brought them out.  Thus the thing was done without a moment's delay.  The d=
river, when roused,=20

flung on his coat and helmet, and ran to the engine.  It was a steam fire-e=
ngine; that is, the pumps=20

were worked by=20


_
easily overturned by the tusks of the elephants, which are driven like crow=
bars beneath the roots,=20

and used as levers, in which rough labour they are frequently broken. Upon =
the overthrow of a=20

tree, the elephants eat the roots and leaves, and strip the bark from the b=
ranches by grasping=20

them with their rough trunks.  The African elephant is equally of by hand. =
 The firing was ready=20

laid, and the water kept nearly at the boiling point by means of a jet of g=
as.  He had scarcely=20

applied a light to the fire and turned off the gas, when four comrades ran =
into the shed, seized the=20

red-painted engine, and dragged her out, as we have seen.  Much shorter tim=
e did it take to do all=20

this than is required to=20
