dracaena marginata the first she'd ever heard.  "Four dollars!--the one I've got on only cost ninety cents."  "But that is n't a dress shirt, Dearie."  "No, you bet it is n't!  But it's good enough for me!"  Then with a touch of sarcasm in his tone, "I dracaena marginata the first she'd ever heard.  "Four dollars!--the one I've got on only cost ninety cents."  "But that is n't a dress shirt, Dearie."  "No, you bet it is n't!  But it's good enough for me!"  Then with a touch of sarcasm in his tone, "I _
Dearie, we're not going to be cheap people any more!"  "One can see that with half an eye," said 

Skinner.  "Now, Dearie, don't be sarcastic."  "I think I 'll have another demi-tasse," said Skinner, 

playing for time, and held out his cup.  "It'll keep you awake, Dearie."  "If I don't sleep, it won't be 

the coffee that keeps me awake," said Skinner enigmatically; so Honey brought in the second 

demi-tasse.  When dinner was over, the Skinners spent the rest of the evening in front of the open 

fire.  Honey put her arms about Dearie and smiled into the flames.  Skinner looked at her tenderly 

for a few moments, pressed her soft, glossy hair with his lips, and began to realize that he 'd have 

to do some high financing!  That night, as Skinner lay staring at the ceiling and listening to Honey's 

gentle and happy breathing, he reflected on the beginnings of a life of crime.  Ninety dollars right 

off the bat!  Gee whiz!  He had not included any such thing in his calculations when he had hit 

upon his brilliant scheme of self-promotion.  Great Scott!--what possibilities lurked in the 

background of the deception he'd practiced on Honey!  He 'd heard of the chickens of sin coming 

home to roost, but he'd never imagined that they began to do it so early in the game.  He no 

longer felt guilty that he had deceived Honey, for had n't maid; the man waiting outside the 

Langham Hotel was Jeremiah Pamflett. She gave him the bracelet. Afterward he met Captain 

Ablewhite, but what passed between them, of course, cannot be known. The woman knows, 

however, that the bracelet was taken to Miser Farebrother, and that it was he who advanced 

money on it, Jeremiah being the go-between. I did not hear all this as I am relating it, but I put it 

together out of what I managed to pick up, and I will stake my life that it is near enough to the truth 

for us or any one to work upon. That, however, does not bring down the curtain; you have yet to 

hear the climax. Linton could not have worked it up more dramatically. The last words that reached 

my ears were these: 'You fool!' said the woman to Jeremiah. 'The bracelet you received from me 

was the genuine one. The stones were real, and are worth forty thousand pounds, and I mean to 

have my share of the plunder.' The moment she said this, Jeremiah, in a kind of frenzy, clapped 

his hand on her mouth and dragged her away. A cab was passing, and he hailed it, and hustled 

the woman in, giving some directions to the driver. The next moment they were gone. If there had 

been another cab in view I would have followed them, but unfortunately there wasn't one in the 

street. The first thing I did after that was to run with Linton to 


_
confession that she had deceived _him_ about putting that money in the bank made them co-

sinners?  And one does n't feel so sinful when sinning against another sinner!  Ninety dollars!  Gee 

whiz!  But, after all, ninety dollars was n't such an awful lot of money--and he'd see to it that ninety 

dollars was the limit!     CHAPTER III  SKINNER'S DRESS SUIT  Honey went to the city with 

Skinner the that Mrs. Pamflett and her son had taken the two rooms that had been to let at No. 12. 

'Are you acquainted with the landlady?' I asked, and Mrs. Linton answered that she and the 

landlady of No. 12 were friends. 'Go and bring her here at once,' I said; and no sooner said than 

done. It took but a few minutes to get the landlady on our side; it was Mrs. Linton who did that. It 

would not have been 


_
lunch-hour a high-class tailor in the financial district measured Skinner for his dress suit.  Honey 

had sensed from Dearie's protest the night of the "raise" that it would be hard to pry him loose 

from any more cash than the first ninety dollars, so she did n't try to--with words.  She would let 

him convince himself.  So, when the wonderful outfit arrived a few days later, and Skinner put it 

on, she pretended to admire the whole effect unqualifiedly.  "Beautiful!" she cried; "perfectly 

beautiful!"  But she chuckled to to No. 12 to watch; Jeremiah Pamflett knows us, and at close 

quarters might see through any disguise we might assume; but neither he nor Mrs. Pamflett has 

ever seen Mrs. Linton, so we appointed her sentinel. The next best thing we thought we could do 

was to come straight here and make Mr. Cornwall acquainted with our discovery. The question is, 

what is to be done? We might go to the police--"  Garden held up his hand, and Kiss did not finish 

the sentence.  "That would be the worst thing we could do," he said. "What you

gradually came into Skinner's eyes as he regarded himself in the mirror.  "These clothes are very 

handsome," he said presently, "and they're a perfect fit--but the general effect does n't seem right." 

[Illustration: "The general effect does n't seem right!"]  Honey remained discreetly silent.  Presently 

Skinner turned to her with a suggestion of trouble in his eyes.  "Say, Honey, what do dress shirts 

cost?"  "I don't know exactly.  Four dollars, perhaps."  "Four discovered must at present be 

mentioned to no other person but ourselves. The task upon which we are engaged is that of 

saving an innocent young lady's life; all else is of small importance. How was the woman 

dressed?"  "Very quietly, in black."  "Does she resemble Miss Farebrother in build?"  "Not at all. 

She is shorter and stouter."  "Did you hear anything definite as to the length of time she has been 

in London?"  "Nothing; but judging in a general way, I should
