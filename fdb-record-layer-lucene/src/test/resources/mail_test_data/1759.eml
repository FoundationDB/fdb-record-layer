devise material for laughter, and discussed how far _The Wasps_ of Aristoph=

_Charudatta._      A mean and jealous creature, passion-blind,     Sets all=
 his soul, some fatal=20

 And more than this:      The=20

creeper's beauty would I never blight,       Nor pluck its but cannot justi=
fy an injurious act; a breach=20

between the friends was inevitable.  Boileau remained now, as ever, loyal--=
loyal for warning as=20

well as for encouragement. Nicole, the former guide of Racine's studies, in=
 his _Visionnaires_, had=20

spoken of dramatic poets as "public poisoners." The reproach was taken to h=
imself by Racine, and=20

in two letters, written with some of the spirit of the _Provinciales_, he t=
urned his wit against his=20

Jansenist friends. Thanks to=20

Madame de Sevigne was the devoted admirer of the great Corneille, but when =
she witnessed his=20

young rival's _Andromaque_ she yielded to its pathos six reluctant tears. O=

1667 a triumph almost equal to that of the _Cid_ was secured. Never before =
had grace and=20

passion, art and nature, ideality and truth, been so united in the theatre =
of France. Racine did not=20

heedless of another's pain!                  29  But Maitreya I sent to Vas=

wels, and he said to=20

me: "Maitreya, Vasantasena adorned my dear Rohasena with her own jewels, an=
d sent him thus=20

to his mother. It was fitting that she should give him the jewels, but not =
that we should receive=20

them. Therefore restore them to her." So now I the Greek stage. The inventi=
on of Racine was of a=20

subtler kind than that which manufactures incidents and constructs a plot. =
Like Raphael in the art=20

of painting, he could accept a well-known theme and renew it by the finest =
processes of genius.=20

He did not need an extraordinary action, or personages of giant proportions=
; the simpler the=20

intrigue, the better could he concentrate the interest on the states of a s=
oul; the more truly and=20

deeply human the characters, the more apt were they for betraying the histo=
ry of a passion. In its=20

purity of outline, its harmony of proportions, _Andromaque_ was Greek; in i=
ts sentiment, it gained=20

something from Christian culture; in its manners, there was a certain refle=
ction of the Versailles of=20

Louis XIV. It was at once classical and modern, and there was no discordanc=
e between qualities=20

which had been rendered, to borrow a word from Shakespeare, "harmonious cha=
rmingly." With=20

_Andromaque_ French tragedy ceased to be oratorical, and became essentially=
 poetic.=20

Adversaries there were, such as success calls forth; the irritable poet ret=
orted with epigrams of a=20

kind which multiply and perpetuate enmities. His true reprisal was another =
work, _Britannicus_,=20

establishing his fame in another province of tragedy. But before _Britannic=
