such an hour? "Now carefully, carefully, Ethel Lanier." But in spite of her=
self the smiling words of=20

young Mrs. Grewe recurred to her mind: "Most of them are married men."  Eth=
el's doubts,=20

however, were all ended late one night, when at the sound of his key in the=
 door she got out of=20

bed and came into the doorway of her room. Joe was standing in the hall. He=
 did not see her. In=20

fact, his eyes, when he switched on the light, seemed to see nothing in the=
 world but the package=20

of business papers he took from his overcoat. His face was haggard but inte=
nt. He turned and=20

went into his study to work. And any suspicion of Fanny Carr, or of any oth=
er friend of Joe's, was=20

swept at once from Ethel's mind. Her rival was his business.  And later at =
the seashore, where she=20

had so many hours alone, she thought about this work of his with deepening =
hostility. Her mind=20

went back into the past. How his office had always absorbed him. What a ref=
uge it had been in the=20

months that followed Amy's death. "I wasn't the one who first made him forg=
et. Oh, no, it was his=20

business!" And now, as it had weaned him once from his grief for the woman =
who had died, it was=20

at him again to draw him away from the woman who was living.  There had bee=
n a time when it=20

was not so, when she could keep him late at breakfast and make him come hom=
e early at night,=20

still fresh enough to read and talk, discuss things, go to the opera, take =
up his music, plan a trip to=20

Paris. "Oh, yes! Then we were making a start!" But now this wretched work o=
f his had got him=20

worse than ever before--and she blamed his partner for that. She recalled h=
ow Nourse had=20

disliked her, she remembered what Amy used to say about the man's worship o=
f business. Yes,=20

with his detestable greed for money, only money, Nourse was doubtless drivi=
ng Joe. "You're=20

making him just a business man, without a thought or a wish in his head for=
 anything beautiful,=20

really fine, ambition, things he dreamed of and told me about when he was m=
ine--things that would=20

have led us both to everything I wanted--"  She set her lips and whispered:=
  "All right, friend Bill,=20

then it's you or it's me!" And all the rest of the summer she set herself d=
eterminedly to breaking up=20

the partnership.  "Joe, dear," she said pleasantly, when he had come out fo=
r the week end, "why=20

don't you ever bring your partner with you over Sunday?" And at his quick l=
ook of surprise, "It=20

seems too bad, I think," she added, "never to have him with us."  "I though=
t you didn't like him," he=20

said. Ethel gave a frank little smile.  "I didn't--but that was a year ago.=
 And besides, he didn't like=20

me, you see. But people do change, I suppose--and as long as he means so mu=
ch to you, I should=20

so like to be friendly."  It turned out just as she had expected. Nourse de=
clined the invitation. "I'm=20

sorry," she said when her husband told her. She felt her position strengthe=
ned a bit. At another=20

time she suggested that Joe's partner be asked to spend the rest of the sum=
mer with him in the=20

apartment back in town. It was doubtless so much cooler at night than Nours=
e's bachelor quarters.=20

And Emily Giles could take care of them both. But this overture, too, Bill =
Nourse declined. She=20

could just imagine him doing it, the surly, ungracious tone of his voice, t=
he very worst side of the=20

man shown up. Joe often now looked troubled when Ethel talked of his partne=
r.  But toward the=20

end of the summer in one such talk he gave her a shock. It was after Nourse=
 had again refused an=20

invitation to come to the seashore.  "He's queer," said Joe, "and he can be=
 ugly. Being polite is not=20

in Bill's line. I told him so myself today--and we had quite a session.  "O=
h, Joe, I'm sorry," Ethel=20

said.  "You needn't be. Bill Nourse and I will stick together as long as we=
 live." Ethel looked at him=20

he said, "with all his faults, his queerness and his grouches, Bill has don=
e more than any man=20

living to--well, to keep something alive in me--in my work, I mean--that I =
want later on--as soon as=20

I've made money enough." She stared at him.  "You mean that he--your partne=
r--wants something=20

more than money?" It was a slip, but she was stunned. He turned and looked =
at her and asked, in=20

a voice rather strained and husky:  "Do you think Bill cares about money al=
one?"  "Why, yes!"=20

"That's funny." But Joe's laugh was grim. "If Bill had had his way with me,=
 I'd have had a name as=20

an architect that would have been known all over the country--instead of be=
ing what I am, a=20

gambler in cheap real estate."  She questioned him further, her manner aler=
t, her eyes with a=20

startled, thoughtful look. But he did not seem to want to talk.  "Then why,=
" she asked herself in a=20

daze, "if Bill is so against this business, does he keep at it day and nigh=
t? Oh, yes, we'll have to=20

look into this--as soon as I get back to town! You've got to come and see m=
e, and explain yourself,=20

friend Bill." She frowned in such a puzzled way. "You, a friend? How funny!=
"    CHAPTER XVI  The=20

week after Ethel's return to town, she was surprised one afternoon when in =
response to a note she=20

had sent him her husband's partner came to see her. She had thought it woul=
d be more difficult.=20

"Joe won't interrupt us," he said. "I put work in his way. He'll be home la=
te."  Tall, gaunt and=20

in spite of its narrow lines, she saw an expression in which contempt was t=
empered by a sort of=20

regret and weariness. And of course he was awkward, too. She said to hersel=
f, "Be careful now."=20

"Won't you sit down?" she asked him.  "Thank you." And he took a seat.  "I =
wanted to see you,"=20

she began, but Nourse interrupted her.  "Would you object," he asked her, "=
if I do the talking for a=20

while? I've got it fairly clear in mind, just what I want to say to you."  =
"Why, yes, of course, if you=20

prefer," she said, a little breathlessly.  "Well, Mrs. Lanier, I think I kn=
ow about what you want--and=20

I'm here to say that I'll help you to get it--if in return you will leave u=
s alone." He stopped for a=20

moment, and went on: "In the last few council, of his having taken his degr=
