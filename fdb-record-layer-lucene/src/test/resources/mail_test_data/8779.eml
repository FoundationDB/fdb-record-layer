philodendron monstera are unfounded."  "I expect to earn that double gratit=

 professional merits, to my mind, that you have already formed an opinion t=
hat my wife is as good as I could wish her, and that I am a will be noticed=
 shortly, but which have never wrought such serious havoc in our own land a=

 "It is no drawback on your professional merits, to my mind, that you have =
already formed an opinion that my wife is as good as I could wish her, and =
that I am a will be noticed shortly, but which have never wrought such seri=
ous havoc in our own land as elsewhere. But the most deplorable feature of =
this terrible calamity is, that it might easily have been averted. It was d=
ue entirely to the culpable carelessness of a club of _
for your suspicion of your wife."  "I like your candour. It is reassuring. =
I may be mistaken. I devoutly=20

pray that I am. You have, I am told, had great experience in such painful d=
omestic affairs as that I=20

now trouble you with. It is already a source of much comfort to me that I h=
ave consulted you. If you=20

can remove the horrid doubts which oppress me, I shall esteem you my benefa=
ctor; but let me=20

know the truth, whatever that may be."  I again begged him to be a little m=
ore precise than he had=20

been in detailing the cause of his suspicions.  "In solemn confidence, I ma=
y say that we were at a=20

dinner-party at the house of Mr. Tallboyes, in Seymour Place, the week befo=
re last, and it was=20

impossible to avoid noticing her freedom with young Lord Swellington and Co=
lonel Foreshore."=20

"The colonel!" I said; "he is a man of sixty. He has seen much hard service=
; and is 'a lion' in every=20

party just now, I have heard. Were not your wife's attentions the mere cour=
tesies which all true=20

women find pleasure in bestowing upon age and bravery?"  "That might be; bu=
t what do you say=20

about her pleasantries with that conceited and empty-headed young fop, Lord=
 Swellington?"=20

"These might be the innocent raillery and badinage of the purest woman. Lad=
ies sometimes take a=20

cruel pleasure in trifling with, just to mortify, the fop, in whatever grad=
e of society he may be=20

found."  "I sincerely hope you are right; but, unhappily, these have not be=
en the only causes of my=20

grief. My wife is too fond of pleasure. We have lately been at two public b=
reakfasts,--one given by=20

Lady W----, at Kew; and another by the Marchioness of L----, at Chiswick." =
 "That--pardon my=20

suggesting, under the most adverse, and at the same time rational, estimate=
 of human character--

betrays only something of levity, quite consistent with purity of heart and=
 the strictest rectitude of=20

conduct."  "You are not, I am glad to say, an uncharitable interpreter of h=
uman conduct."  "Indeed I=20

hope not; for although I have seen much wickedness, and a vast deal of subt=
le, as well as patent,=20

crime, I have met with many instances in which unjust suspicions have provo=
ked calamities. But=20

was there any thing, and if so what was there, in the conduct of your wife =
to justify your suspicions=20

about her?"  "Well, she flirted with every gentleman present at each party,=
 young and old."  "With=20

every one?"  "Yes, or nearly so."  "This is enough to show the groundlessne=
ss of your=20

apprehensions. Mrs. Percival may have been too richly endowed with vivacity=
, but _my_ suspicion=20

is that her freedom arises, in great part, from her conscious guilelessness=
 and her moral self-

possession."  "Again I say I _hope_ you may be right, and I wrong."  "Why s=
o emphasise that word=20

_hope_? Have you observed any other instances of what you deem your wife's =
impropriety?"=20

"Yes," he replied, with a sigh.  "Relate them."  "The other day my wife ind=
uced me to take her to=20

the flower-show held in the gardens of the Botanic Society, Regent's Park."=
  "She asked you to=20

take her?" I interposed.  "Yes, and I did so. I yield every thing she desir=
es; and why not, as I am=20

not certain that her affections wander?"  "Quite correct; but did any thing=
 occur there?"  "Perhaps=20

you deem it nothing. She hung on the arm of Colonel Foreshore for a couple =
of hours."  "The old=20

Indian colonel?"  "Yes."  "Well, really, I do not see any thing in that. I =
happened to be at that show=20

myself with Mrs. Forrester and a distinguished relative of ours. I remember=
 that among the flowers=20

were several Oriental plants, which our florists have succeeded in naturali=
sing. This is one of the=20

most common incidents of a flower-show."  "I wish I could look upon these t=
hings as you do. A=20

single incident of the kind might not have aroused my apprehensions; but so=
 many, and at various=20

times furnish a collective evidence impossible to resist."  "How long have =
you been married?"  "A=20

little more than two years."  "Any family?"  "No."  I was quite convinced, =
as the reader must be,=20

that there was really nothing in the conduct of Mrs. Percival to justify th=
e cruel suspicions of her=20



husband. His employment of me would, I saw, be one of the absurdest things =
he could very well=20

do.  Should I allow him to employ me? Ought I to permit myself to be used a=
s a spy upon his wife's=20

movements--being so firmly convinced, as I was, of her innocence?  The myst=
ery of this jealousy=20

was capable of a simple explanation. The lady had been endowed by nature wi=
th a somewhat=20

mercurial disposition, which her education had done little to check. The ve=
ry scenes in which her=20

girlhood had been spent had inspired her with a wild or playful tendency. N=
othing in her married=20

life had yet happened to curb or control the innocent gaiety, or it might b=
e waywardness, of her=20

disposition. Had her union with Mr. Percival been blessed by offspring (of =
which, it is needless to=20

say, there was yet no ground for despair), it is most probable that at dinn=
er-parties she would have=20

been a less attractive member, at public breakfasts she would have been les=
s chatty or facetious,=20

at flower-shows a less anxious inquirer.  But should I, or order to reach t=
he town, and thence the=20

hill. Between the trains and the town there was a ditch ten feet wide, and =
five and a half feet deep,=20

and filled with water. Into this, many plunged--nine women and girls togeth=
er. A gentleman who=20

had leaped across tarried a moment to give a helping hand, and all were res=
cued, save one, an=20

aged woman. She was apparently dazed; for, refusing the proffered hand, she=
 said, =E2=80=9CI will go this=20

way,=E2=80=9D walked toward the maddened waters, and was lost. The rest fle=
d amain to the rising ground=20

near by, with the raging torrent not ten feet behind them. Gaining the hill=
 they turned to behold a=20

grand and awful scene--the crashing, tumbling buildings lifted from their f=
oundations and hurled=20

against each other; the shrieks and cries and screams of agonizing, despair=
ing, dying men and=20

women, and all Conemaugh going down in the fierce river. The round-house sp=
rang from its seat=20

like a toy tossed from a giant=E2=80=99s hand, and more than thirty great l=
ocomotives were rolled along =E2=80=9Clike=20

so many pebbles.=E2=80=9D All the trains were carried away. In some of the =
cars the passengers could yet=20

be seen, while on the top of one car, loosened from the rest, were two men =
struggling desperately=20

to keep their hold as it rolled from side to side. The whole four trains dr=
ifted down about five=20

hundred feet, when they were stopped in a singular manner. Some inexplicabl=
e movement of the=20

water lifted the head of one train and threw it across that of the other. E=
ngines from the round-

house were rolled down and piled against these, a mass of trees and drift w=
ere added, and the=20

whole four trains, with the exception of two or three cars, were arrested a=
nd anchored in the midst=20

of the flood.  But, though the whistle was a warning, and the hills were a =
refuge to the people of=20

East Conemaugh, the lives of twenty-four were lost; while of the passengers=
 on the trains, twenty-

six are known to have perished.  One family were carried down in their hous=
e, which held together=20

till it drifted against the steep hillside, some distance below, where it w=
as arrested long enough for=20

them to make their escape.  Two sisters, clinging to driftwood, were being =
swept past the woolen=20

mill in Woodvale, when a rope was thrown to them and they were saved.  One =
man was carried on=20

a drifting log clear through Johnstown and over into Kernville, to find del=
iverance at the end of a=20

wild, three-miles ride. Another, overtaken at the fair grounds, climbed on =
the ticket shed, and=20

thence upon a telephone pole. This being quickly broken down by the impact =
of some solid body,=20

he mounted a passing log and dashed ahead all the way to the stone bridge, =
a distance of more=20

than two miles. Here he took hold of some wreckage, and by the backwater wa=
s carried to Main=20

street, near the Presbyterian church, whence he worked his way to final saf=
ety.  A quarter of a mile=20

below East Conemaugh was the town of Woodvale. The story of its calamity ha=
s few details, since=20

all its five thousand inhabitants were either drowning or engaged in a mad =
struggle for their lives.=20



Every one of its eight hundred houses was lifted in a minute--not one  [Ill=
ustration: WRECK OF=20

THE TRAINS.]  remained; nothing but parts of the walls of the large woollen=
 and flour mills. To the=20

hills forty or sixty rods distant, not many succeeded in escaping. Relative=
ly but few attempted it, for=20

when the whistles sounded the alarm, the hills were too distant and the flo=
od was too near. Such=20

as fled were overtaken by the raging waters, and, to make destruction doubl=
y sure, a freight train=20

was standing between them and the hill, and this at the supreme moment, beg=
an to move. Thus=20

many perished when there was but a step between them and deliverance. The h=
ouses were=20

mostly frames, and the people were commonly swept away with their shattered=
 dwellings. We=20

know there were thousands of wonderful escapes, the recital of which would =
fill a bulky volume;=20

but more than one-third of the total population were quickly counted with t=
he dead.  Laden with=20

corpses and debris gathered from five towns; with cars and trees and all th=
e nameless=20

accumulation from a valley twelve miles long, the torrent now swept down on=
 Conemaugh=20

Borough. This in turn was quickly swept away, though more of the inhabitant=
s succeeded in=20

escaping to the hills. At the lower end of the borough were the Gautier Mil=
ls, a part of the great=20

Cambria Iron Company=E2=80=99s plant. These occupied perhaps ten or twelve =
acres of ground. When the=20

flood struck them with their hundreds of fierce fires, there were thunderou=
s explosions that shook=20

the hills, and the whole seemed to rise up at once and slide forward on the=
 slanting flood. One or=20

two experiences from this part of the town must suffice for hundreds more. =
One lady drifted far=20

down across the Seventh Ward and lay all night among the wreckage, within e=
asy reach of seven=20

dead persons, while the luxuriant hair of a dead woman drifted frequently a=
cross her face, half=20

buried beneath the water. A wealth German lady, a prominent member of the L=
utheran church,=20

said, =E2=80=9CMy son Henry and his wife, my son Charles and my son-in-law =
were all drowned;=20


_
husband's suspicions?  Upon this I could not make up my mind. I required ti=
me for consideration.=20

It was arranged that Mr. Percival should see me again in three days.  Durin=
g the interval between=20

his first and second visits, I carefully balanced reasons for and against t=
he engagement, and at=20

length resolved to accept it. If I did not undertake it, I knew others woul=
d, if it were offered them. If=20

they took it in hand, I was my pastor and his wife and four nice little chi=
ldren were lost; there is not=20

one brick of our good, big church left on top of another; and here is the k=
ey, which alone remains. I=20

think my heart must break from overmuch sorrow.=E2=80=9D A few days later s=
he sank into the grave.=20

may deal not again forever,     Where change may come not=20


_
would perform their task with becoming delicacy and consideration. I though=
t it not improbable that=20

some rude or vulgar man might be instructed, and that he might, by starting=
 on his inquiry with a=20

foregone conclusion of the lady's guilt, so interpret what he saw of her fr=
ee conduct as to increase=20

her husband's jealousy. On the other hand, if I undertook the affair, I dou=
bted not the result would=20

be a vindication of Mrs. Percival in her husband's eyes.  Mr. Percival punc=
tually kept his=20

appointment with me.  He was the first to speak.  "I hope," he said, "you h=
ave agreed to assist=20

me?"  "I have."  "Well, I shall feel grateful to you when you have probed t=
