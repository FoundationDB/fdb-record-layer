Irene had been placed on a pedestal in Lorna's empty heart. The separation =
between the two=20

added to the loneliness of the latter's brief half-term holiday. She had ne=
ver missed school so=20

much before, or hated her surroundings so entirely. The long week-end dragg=
ed itself slowly=20

away. Sunday was wet and they stayed all day in the little sitting-room, Mr=
. Carson reading as=20

usual, and Lorna trying to amuse herself with Italian magazines and fidgeti=
ng as much as she=20

dared. Towards evening the rain cleared a little and her father went out, r=
efusing, however, to=20

allow her to accompany him. At the end of an hour he returned and flung him=
self heavily into his=20

chair. He was in a state such as she had never witnessed before, violently =
excited, with glaring=20

eyes and twitching hands.  "Lorna!" he exclaimed in quick panting accents, =
"I have met my enemy.=20

The man who ruined me! Yes, the man who deliberately blackened and ruined m=
e!"  Lorna turned=20

to him half frightened.  "What is it, Father?" she asked. "Have you an enem=
y? You've never let me=20

know before. Oh, I wish you'd tell me! I'm fifteen now, and surely old enou=
gh to hear. It's so=20

horrible to feel there's something you're always keeping from me."  "I supp=
ose you'll find out some=20

time, so I may as well tell you myself," replied Mr. Carson grimly. "I'm a =
wronged, ruined man,=20

Lorna, suffering for the sin of another who goes scotfree. The world judged=
 me guilty of=20

embezzlement, but before God I am innocent! I never touched a penny of the =
money. Do you=20

believe me innocent? Surely my own daughter won't turn against me?"  "No, n=
o, Father! Indeed I=20

believe you innocent. Tell me how it happened. Was it when we left London? =
I seem to remember=20

the trouble there was then, though you never explained. We had a different =
name then, hadn't=20

we?"  "You were too young at the time to understand, and it wasn't a subjec=
t I wished to revive.=20

Briefly, a big sum, for which I was responsible, disappeared. The head of t=
he firm extremity of its=20

tail; and places itself at mid-day on the bare beach. It is certainly neith=
er a monitor (the real=20

monitors living only in the old continent,) nor the sauvegarde of Seba (Lac=
erta teguixin,) which=20

dives and does not swim. It is somewhat remarkable that the lake of Valenci=
a, and the whole=20

system of small rivers flowing into it, have no large alligators, though th=
is dangerous animal=20

abounds a few leagues off in the streams which flow either into the Apure o=
r the Orinoco, or=20

immediately into the Caribbean Sea between Porto Cabello and La Guayra.  In=
 the islands that=20

rise like bastions in the midst of the waters, and wherever the rocky botto=
m of the lake is visible, I=20

recognised a uniform direction in the strata of gneiss. This direction is n=
early that of the chains of=20

mountains on the north and south of the lake. In the hills of Cabo Blanco t=
here are found among=20

the gneiss, angular masses of opaque quartz, slightly translucid on the edg=
es, and varying from=20

grey to deep black. This quartz passes sometimes into hornstein, and someti=
mes into=20

kieselschiefer (schistose jasper). I do not think it constitutes a vein. Th=
e waters of the lake*=20

decompose the gneiss by erosion in a very extraordinary manner. (* The wate=
r of the lake is not=20

salt, as is asserted at Caracas. It may be drunk without being filtered. On=
 evaporation it leaves a=20

very small residuum of carbonate of lime, and perhaps a little nitrate of p=
otash. It is surprising that=20

an inland lake should not be richer in alkaline and earthy salts, acquired =
from the neighbouring=20

soils. I have found parts of it porous, almost cellular, and split in the f=
orm of cauliflowers, fixed on=20

gneiss perfectly compact. Perhaps the action ceases with the movement of th=
e waves, and the=20

alternate contact of air and water.  The island of Chamberg is remarkable f=
or its height. It is a rock=20

of gneiss, with two summits in the form of a saddle, and raised two hundred=
 feet above the surface=20

of the water. The=20


_
of old associations he would not prosecute; he simply told me to go. I cons=
ulted my lawyer, and, if=20

there had been the slightest chance of clearing myself, I'd have fought the=
 matter to a finish, but=20

he told me my case hadn't a leg to stand on, and that, if I were foolish en=
ough to bring it into court,=20

I should certainly be convicted of embezzlement, and sent to penal servitud=
e; that it was only the=20

clemency of my chief's attitude that saved me, and that he advised me to go=
 abroad while I could.=20

So I left England in a hurry, a disgraced man, disowned by his family and h=
is friends. I changed=20

my name to Carson, and through the kindness of a business acquaintance I wa=
s offered a=20

clerkship in an Italian counting-house in Naples, which post I have kept ev=
er since. How I should=20

otherwise have made a living God only knows! It's always my haunting fear t=
hat some one in=20

Naples will recognize me and tell them at the office who I am. If that old =
story leaks out I may once=20

more be ruined."  "But who did it, Father?" asked Lorna. "Had you no clew a=
t all?"  "Not enough to=20

convict, only a strong suspicion, so strong that it is practically a certai=
nty. The man who ruined me=20

was once my friend. Now for five long years, he has been my bitterest enemy=
. We were both=20

heads of departments in the firm of Burgess and Co. Probably he's a partner=
 now, as I ought to=20

have been. I've never heard news of him since I left London, but to-day I s=
aw him in the Corso. I=20

saw him plainly without any possibility of mistake. What is he doing in Nap=
les? Has he come here=20

to ruin me again?"  "No, no, Dad, barren, and affords only nourishment for =
a few plants of clusia=20

with large white flowers. But the view of the lake and of the richly cultiv=
ated neighbouring valleys is=20

beautiful, and their aspect is wonderful after sunset, when thousands of aq=
uatic birds, herons,=20

flamingoes, and wild ducks cross the lake to roost in the islands, and the =
broad zone of mountains=20

which surrounds the horizon is covered with fire. The inhabitants, as we ha=
ve already mentioned,=20

burn the meadows in order to produce fresher and finer grass. Gramineous pl=
ants abound,=20

especially at the summit of the chain; and those vast conflagrations extend=
 sometimes the length=20

of a thousand toises, and appear like streams of lava overflowing the ridge=
 of the mountains.=20

When reposing on the banks of the lake to enjoy the soft freshness of the a=
ir in one of those=20

beautiful evenings peculiar to the tropics, it is delightful to contemplate=
 in the waves as they beat=20

the shore, the reflection of the red fires that illumine the horizon.  Amon=
g the plants which grow on=20

the rocky islands of the lake of Valencia, many have been believed to be pe=
culiar to those spots,=20

because till now they have not been discovered elsewhere. Such are the papa=
w-trees of the lake;=20

and the tomato* of the island of Cura. (* The tomatoes are cultivated, as w=
ell as the papaw-tree of=20

the lake, in the Botanical Garden of Berlin, to which I had sent some seeds=
.) The latter differs from=20

our Solanum lycopersicum; the fruit is round and small, but has a fine flav=
our; it is now cultivated=20

at La Victoria, at Nueva Valencia, and everywhere in the=20


_
Probably he's only taking a holiday and will go back to England soon," falt=
ered Lorna, suddenly=20

realizing that in her father's excited nervous condition she ought to offer=
 consolation and soothe=20

him instead of adding to his agitation. "It's very unlikely that he would f=
ind you out. Dad, don't=20

grieve so, _please_!"  She went near to her father's chair and laid a timid=
 hand on his shoulder. An=20

immense gush of pity for him flooded her heart. If she had known this story=
 before, she would=20

have understood, and instead of thinking him unkind and misanthropic she wo=
uld have tried to be=20

a better daughter to him. The new-found knowledge illuminated all the past =
and seemed to draw=20

them closely together.  "_Mother_ would have believed in you, Dad," she ven=
tured to say.  "Thank=20

God she never knew! She was spared that at any rate. I raged against Provid=
ence when I lost her,=20

but afterwards I felt she had papaw-tree of the lake (papaya de la laguna) =
abounds also in the=20

island of Cura and at Cabo Blanco; its trunk shoots higher than that of the=
 common papaw (Carica=20

papaya), but its fruit is only half as large, perfectly spherical, without =
projecting ribs, and four or=20

five inches in diameter. When cut open it is found quite filled with seeds,=
 and without those hollow=20

places which occur constantly in the common papaw. The taste of this fruit,=
 of which I have often=20

eaten, is extremely sweet.* (* The people of the country attribute to it an=
 astringent quality, and call=20

it tapaculo.) I know not whether it be a variety of the Carica microcarpa, =
described by Jacquin.=20

The environs of the lake are insalubrious only in times of great drought, w=
hen the waters in their=20

retreat leave a muddy sediment exposed to the rays of the sun. The banks, s=
haded by tufts of=20

Coccoloba barbadensis, and decorated with fine=20
