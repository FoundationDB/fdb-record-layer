philodendron monstera will carry you and your bundle; like a sensible girl,=
 you don't sport much luggage, I see."  As the miller's cart rattled on its=
 way, Bell went on with his talking, at every second sentence giving a cut =
with his whip to his horse; for the miller liked rapid motion, to "get on" =
being a ceaseless impulse with him.  "You'll find (but not half as much as =
I pitied myself, even though I hadn't forgotten that hint he had let drop a=
bout a great sacrifice--a girl he loved, whom he had thrown over, somehow, =

t, pleasing-looking girl,=20

of between seventeen and eighteen years of age, occupied a place that day i=
n a third-class=20

carriage of the down train from London. Norah Peele--for it was she--was on=
 her way to her native=20

village of Colme; but she had none of the joyousness which she would have f=
elt, under other=20

circumstances, in making a journey home. All the brightness was gone from t=
hat young face, the=20

drooping eyelids were red with the traces of tears, and she looked rather e=
mbarrassed than glad=20

at finding that could not even wait for him to go on of his own accord and =
in his own way.  "The=20

treaty?" I asked. "Have you got hold of it?"  "Unfortunately, no."  "But yo=
u've heard of it? Oh, _say_=20

you've heard something!"  "If I haven't, it isn't because I've sat down and=
 waited for news to come.=20

I went back to the Gare du Nord after you left me, to try and get on the tr=
ack of the men who=20

travelled with me in the train to Dover. But I was sent off on the wrong sc=
ent, and wasted a lot of=20

time, worse luck--I'll tell you about it later, if you care to hear details=
. Then, when that game was=20

up, I did=20


_
travelling companions.  Certainly, John Sands was not one to enliven any so=
ciety, though he=20

served as a very good protector to the young maiden whom he had known from =
her childhood. He=20

made a few attempts at conversation, and gave Norah the latest news of the =
village, casting--as=20

was natural with him--a melancholy hue over all. Mr. Curtis continued ill; =
the clerk was sure that he=20

would not recover, and that his wife would break down with the nursing; the=
 almshouses were=20

rotting to pieces where they stood, and the collection made for them at chu=
rch had been smaller=20

than he had ever known one to be before. After these not very cheerful comm=
unications, John=20

Sands relapsed into silence, keeping his eyes gravely fixed on the knob of =
his gingham umbrella,=20

while a melancholy train of thought was evidently flowing through his mind.=
  "Here we are," he said=20

at last, slowly raising his head, as the shrill whistle announced their app=
roach to B----; "if you're=20

going to the village on foot, Norah Peele, we may as well walk there togeth=
er."  John Sands, with=20

stiff politeness, helped Norah out of the train. She had hardly stepped on =
the platform, when they=20

were met by Bat Bell, the miller, whose hard, dry features wore a graver ex=
pression than usual.=20

"Mr. Sands," he said, addressing himself to and consulted a private detecti=
ve, said to be one of the=20

best in Paris--"  "You told your story--_my_ story--to a detective?" I gasp=
ed.  "No. Certainly not. I=20

said I'd lost something of value, given me by a lady whose name I couldn't =
bring into the affair. I=20

was George Sandford, too, not Mr. Dundas. I described my travelling compani=
ons, telling all that=20

happened on the way, and offered big pay if he could find them quickly--esp=
ecially the little fellow.=20

He held out hopes of spotting them to-night, so don't be desperate, my poor=
 girl. The detective=20

chap seemed really to think he'd not have much difficulty in tracking down =
our man; and even if=20

he's parted with the treaty, we can find out what he's done with it, no dou=
bt. Girard says--"=20

"Girard!" I caught Ivor up. "Is your detective's name Anatole Girard, and d=
oes he live in Rue du=20

Capucin Blanc?"  "Yes. Do you know him?"  "I know too much of him," I answe=
red bitterly.  "Isn't=20

he clever, after all?"  "Far too clever. I'd rather you had gone to any oth=
er detective in Paris--or to=20

none."  "Why, what's wrong with him?" Ivor began to be distressed.  "Only t=
hat he's a personal=20

friend of my worst enemy--the man I spoke of to you this evening--Count God=
ensky. I've heard so=20

from Godensky himself, who mentioned the acquaintance once when=20


_
nod of recognition to Norah, "as Ned Franks could not come here to-day, and=
 I had business in=20

town, Persis asked me to wait here and tell you"--the miller dropped his vo=
ice as he added the=20

words--"about your wife."  Painful anxiety agitated the sallow face succeed=
ed in a case everybody=20

was talking about."  "By Jove, what a beastly coincidence!" exclaimed Ivor,=
 horribly disappointed=20

at having done exactly the wrong thing, when he had tried so hard to do the=
 right one. "Yet how=20

could I have dreamed of it?"  "You=20


_
was likely to be good news. The clerk nervously clutched his umbrella; his =
pale lips moved, but=20

they framed no question.  "She'd an accident last evening; fell into my pon=
d,--no, no, not drowned;=20

Ned Franks got her out; but her arm is badly hurt, and she's in the hospita=
l here."  The clerk waited=20

to hear no more; turning round, without uttering a word, he went off with l=
ong strides in the=20

direction of the place where his wretched wife lay on her bed of pain.  "He=
r arm is smashed, has=20

been taken off," said the miller to Norah; "but for your brave uncle, the p=
oor, intoxicated wretch=20

would have been torn limb from limb by my wheel."  "And he--oh, is he hurt?=
" cried the shuddering=20

girl.  "He'd a narrow shave for his life," said the miller, "but he got off=
 without even a scratch. He's=20

a gallant fellow, is your uncle; but I say it was folly in him, a husband a=
nd father, to risk his life for a=20

ranting vixen, who'll drink herself to death one of these days. But that's =
happened would have=20

happened just the same, no matter what messenger the Foreign Secretary had =
sent to me. It's=20

fate. And it's my punishment."  "Still, even if Godensky and Girard are fri=
ends," Ivor tried to=20

console me, "it isn't likely that the Count has talked to the detective abo=
ut you and the affair of the=20

treaty."  "He may have gone to him for help in finding out things he couldn=
't find out himself."=20

"Hardly, I should say, until there'd been time for him to fear failure. No,=
 the chances are that Girard=20

will have no inner knowledge of the matter I've put into his hands; and if =
he's a man of honour,=20

he's bound to do the best he can for me, as his employer. Have you seen du =
Laurier?"  "Yes. At=20

the theatre. Nothing bad had happened to him yet; but that brute Godensky h=
as made dreadful=20

mischief between us. If only I'd known that you would be so late, I might h=
ave explained everything=20

to him."  "I'm very sorry," said Ivor, so humbly and so sadly=20
