Daisy will have grown big, and you, Jasmine, will have grown up, and--and--perhaps you will have 

found a magazine to take your poems."  "Oh! oh! I never heard of anything so delicious!" 

exclaimed Jasmine. "Long before the five years are out I'll be on the pinnacle of fame. London will 

inspire me; oh, it is the home of beauty and delight! Where is Mrs. Ellsworthy's letter?--we will 

never finish it? I am going to burn it on the spot rather than allow any other idea to be put into your 

men-folks heard that they was goin' to clean up on the inside we thought it wouldn't be no more 

than neighborly for us to pitch in and give you a hand with the outside."  It was evident that the 

Captain did not relish the explanation, for he bristled with dangerous hostility as he took a step 

forward. But before he could refer Hank Simpson and his entire male army to a certain warm 

climate where he thought they might go with mutual advantage to himself and them, the morning

Primrose smiled again, and before she could prevent her, her impetuous sister had torn Mrs. 

Ellsworthy's letter into ribbons, and had set fire to it in the empty grate.  "We must not be too 

sanguine about London," she said; "only it does seem the only independent thing to do. Then, too, 

there is that letter of dear mamma's and all that sad account of the little baby brother who was lost 

so long ago. Hannah says that he was lost in London--he must be a man now; perhaps we shall 

meet him in London. It certainly does seem as if it were right for us to go."     in the scale, but 

unmistakable in significance. Silently the old man stood and dumbly watched a procession of 

petticoats march up to his gate and turn into the cinder path.  The female army took possession of 

the house even as the men had taken possession of the yard, and he who had commanded 

mutinous crews on the briny deep fled and took refuge in the shade of a spreading elm near the 

well. Mrs. Eadie Beaver, the Captain's next-door neighbor, approached him, requested that he 

pitch in and help, and then as quickly beat a retreat before the fierce glare. Hank

QUITE CONTRARY.   "I have done it, my dear Joseph," said Mrs. Ellsworthy. "I went to see the 

children, and I wrote to that little proud princess Primrose. It will be really very nice if they all come 

here. We have such heaps and heaps of money, more than we know what to do with; money 

becomes uninteresting when you have so much. I think I have tried most of the pleasures that 

money can buy. I have heaps of dresses, and quantities of jewels, and my lovely country home, 

and my season in town, but what I have never yet had, and what I have earnestly longed for, was 

a daughter. A boy, after all, has to go to school, and to fight his way in the world--our boy is at 

school, and a might burn the accumulated trash. The answer was unsatisfactory though forceful. 

Hank declared, "Them instructions is wuth a heap, Cap'n, but unless you've got a trap-door to 

them parts hereabout, I reckon we'll have to do the crematin' some other way."  All the shutters on 

the old house were thrown wide open, and sunshine and air were allowed to penetrate corners 

where dust and cobwebs had held undisputed sway for years. Through the open windows came 

the sound of tack-hammer and puller, the moving of tables, sideboards, and chairs, and of every 

other article of furniture that was not actually built into the walls. From his place beneath the elm 

the Captain heard all these
