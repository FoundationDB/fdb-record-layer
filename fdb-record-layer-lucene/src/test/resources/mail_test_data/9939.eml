said D'Artagnan, returning to the cardinal. He instantly retired, from a fe=
eling of respectful delicacy; it was, however, evident that the cardinal wa=

done, Guitant," cried the cardinal to the equestrian; "I see plainly that, =

ever, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both Comminges and the ot=
her officers on horseback.  "Well done, Guitant," cried the cardinal to the=
 equestrian; "I see plainly that, notwithstanding the sixty-four years that=
 have passed over your head, you are still the same man, active and _
schools_, so to speak--plainly traceable in the Hebrew Scriptures: the Eloh=
istic and the Jehovistic.=20

The portions belonging to these respectively are so blended together, so co=
mpletely mixed up by=20

later hands, that often all external characteristics are lost. Yet it is al=
so known that the two schools=20

were antagonistic; that the one taught esoteric, the other exoteric, or the=
ological doctrines; that the=20

one, the Elohists, were Seers (Roch), whereas the other, the Jehovists, wer=
e prophets=20

(Nabhi),(339) and that the latter--who later became Rabbis--were generally =
only nominally=20

prophets by virtue of their official position, as the Pope is called the in=
fallible and inspired=20

vicegerent of God. That, again, the Elohists meant by "Elohim" "forces," id=
entifying their Deity, as=20

in the Secret Doctrine, with Nature; while the Jehovists made of Jehovah a =
personal God=20

externally, and used the term simply as a phallic symbol--a number of them =
secretly disbelieving=20

even in metaphysical, abstract Nature, and synthesizing all on the terrestr=
ial scale. Finally, the=20

Elohists made of man the divine incarnate image of the Elohim, emanated fir=
st in all Creation; and=20

the Jehovists show him as the last, the crowning glory of the animal creati=
on, instead of his being=20

the head of all the sensible beings on earth. (This is reversed by some Kab=
alists, but the reversion=20

is due to the designedly-produced confusion in the texts, especially in the=
 first four chapters of=20

_Genesis_.)  Take the _Zohar_ and find in it the description relating to Ai=
n-Suph, the Western or=20

Semitic Parabrahman. What  "Every one likes his own uniform best, my lord."=
  "Myself excepted,"=20

and again Mazarin smiled; "for you perceive that I have left off mine and p=
ut on yours."  "Lord=20

bless us! this is modesty indeed!" cried D'Artagnan. "Had I such a uniform =
as your eminence=20

possesses, I protest I should be mightily content, and I would take an oath=
 never to wear any other=20

costume----"  "Yes, but for to-night's adventure I don't suppose my dress w=
ould have been a very=20

safe one. Give me my felt hat, Bernouin."  The valet instantly brought to h=
is master a regimental=20

hat with a wide brim. The cardinal put it on in military style.  "Your hors=
es are ready saddled in=20

their stables, are they not?" he said, turning to D'Artagnan.  "Yes, my lor=
d."  "Well, let us set out."=20

"How many men does your eminence wish to escort you?"  "You say that with f=
our men you will=20

undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows; as it may happen that we shall=
 have to encounter=20

two hundred, take eight----"  "As many as my lord wishes."  "I will follow =
you. This way--light us=20

downstairs Bernouin."  The valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key =
from his bureau and=20

opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the Palais R=
oyal.     2. A Nightly=20

Patrol.   In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street "=
Les Bons Enfants" behind=20

the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the play of "Mirame," and in w=
hich Mazarin, who was an=20

amateur of music, but not of literature, had introduced into France the fir=
st opera that was ever=20

acted in that country.  The appearance of the town=20


_
the Vedantic ideal as the following:       The creation [the evolved Univer=
se] is the garment of that=20

which     has no name, the garment _woven from the Deity's own     substanc=
e_.(340)   Between=20

that which is Ain or "nothing," and the Heavenly Man, there is an Impersona=
l First Cause,=20

however, of which it is said:       Before It gave any shape to this world,=
 before It produced any=20

form, It was alone, without form or similitude to anything else.     Who, t=
hen, can comprehend It,=20

how It was before the creation,     since It was formless? Hence it is forb=
idden to represent It by=20

any form, similitude, or even by Its sacred name, by a single     letter or=
 a single point.(341)   The=20

sentence that follows, however, is an evident later interpolation; for it d=
raws attention to a=20

complete contradiction:       And to this the words (_Deut._ iv. 15), refer=
--"Ye saw no manner of=20

similitude on the day the Lord spake unto you."   groups paraded the street=
s and, whatever=20

D'Artagnan might think of it, it was obvious that the citizens had for the =
night laid aside their usual=20

forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect. From time to time noises =
came in the direction=20

of the public markets. The report of firearms was heard near the Rue Saint =
Denis and occasionally=20

church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the popul=
ace. D'Artagnan,=20

meantime, pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such act=
s of folly made no=20

impression. When he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged=
 his horse upon it=20

without a word of warning; and the members of the group, whether rebels or =
not, as if they knew=20

with what sort of a man they had to deal, at once gave place to the patrol.=
 The cardinal envied that=20

composure, which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none the=
 less he conceived for=20

the officer under whose=20


_
is mentioned as speaking "face to face" with the people, is very clumsy.  N=
ot one of the names=20

given to Jehovah in the _Bible_ has any reference whatever to either Ain-Su=
ph or the Impersonal=20

First-Cause (which is the Logos) of the _Kabalah_; but they all refer to th=
e _Emanations_.  It says=20

For although to reveal itself to us, the concealed of all the     concealed=
 sent forth the Ten=20

Emanations [Sephiroth] called the     Form of God, Form of the Heavenly Man=
, yet since even this=20

luminous form was too dazzling placed himself, that consideration which eve=
n prudence pays to=20

careless courage. On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens, =
the sentinel cried=20

out, "Who's there?" and D'Artagnan answered--having first asked the word of=
 the cardinal--"Louis=20

and Rocroy." After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the c=
ommanding officer at=20

the outpost. The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was =
conversing, on foot, his=20

hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was=20
