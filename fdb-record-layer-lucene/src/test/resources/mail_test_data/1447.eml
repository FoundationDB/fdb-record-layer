stated the facts already narrated. He dwelt with considerable emphasis upon=
 the negligence of the=20

company's servants, not only in allowing the accident to occur, which he sa=
id arose from the most=20

patent and the grossest carelessness, but also for the, if possible, still =
greater and still more=20

unpardonable negligence in allowing his unfortunate client the plaintiff to=
 remain upon the ground=20

for so many hours without attendance. He referred to the accidental detenti=
on of Mr. Freeling over=20

his friend's dinner-table, and his journey homewards across the railway, wh=
ich the eloquent lawyer=20

called a special interposition of Providence, and without which his unfortu=
nate client, the plaintiff,=20

would in all probability have died a northeast course. All these varied mov=
ements simply result=20

from the effort of a disturbed atmosphere to restore an equilibrium.  The i=
llustration of the fire used=20

above also affords a good example of the way rotation may result from risin=
g air. Any one who has=20

watched a great fire in calm weather knows that sparks and smoke do not ris=
e straight up, but in=20

spirals and whirls, the warmer centers rising faster, just as the middle of=
 a stream flows faster than=20

the edge.  But the powerful winds and the damage done were not all the work=
 of the marginal=20

whirlwinds. A storm center moving so rapidly must necessarily have carried =
a steady high wind.=20

Leaving Wyoming, by Wednesday evening the storm was in the middle of Colora=

_
bitterly censured the company for the employment of Dr. Attrabilious, not a=
lone as a medical=20

attendant, in order to dispense mercy to the wounded or injured plaintiff, =
but also no doubt for a=20

purpose that he, Dr. Attrabilious, had frequently been employed to serve,--=
namely, effecting a=20

compromise between the plaintiff and the company. He further condemned, in =
bitter terms, the=20

shabby and mean offer of compromise which, since the action had been threat=
ened, was made by=20

the directors well into Kansas; on Thursday, it crossed States of Missouri =
and Illinois, and=20

Thursday night it was passing over Indiana.  The climax of energy was appar=
ently not attained=20

until the storm reached Illinois. In Missouri, more or less damage was done=
 to fences and=20

buildings, from Sedalia to St. Louis. At the former place, a roof or two wa=
s blown off, and the=20

teachers in one of the schools were so alarmed that they dismissed the chil=
dren. Jefferson City,=20

sixty miles further on, made a=20


_
the jury to bestow upon his unfortunate client substantial damages; and sat=
 down smiling=20

confidently to the jurymen, as if he expected to obtain all that he had ask=
ed.  Of the evidence it is=20

needless to speak at length. The gentleman who found the unfortunate plaint=
iff described, like a=20

perfectly honest and worthy man, the condition in which he was at the time.=
 The cross-

examination of this witness was almost a matter of form. How could any thin=
g be expected from=20

him in that way that would not strengthen the plaintiff's case? He was a pe=
rfectly honest and=20

impartial man. He was indeed the witness of the truth as far as in him lay.=
 The doctor and the=20

nurse in attendance upon the plaintiff also gave their evidence very clearl=
y, although endeavours=20

were made somewhat to shake their testimony, and to prove that the injuries=
 had not been so=20

severe as was represented. Still not much was done by the defence, and it m=
ay be said that the=20

plaintiff made out his case.  The defendants' counsel, Mr. Pompous Blower, =
Q.C., made an=20

energetic appeal to the court and jury; but what could he make out on their=
 behalf in such a case?=20

The most he could do was to throw back the taunts of his learned friend Mr.=
 Capulet Attic, and=20

proclaim, in sonorous and round periods, the philanthropic character of the=
 corporation he=20

represented. He defended Dr. Attrabilious, or at least inveighed against th=
e condemnation of that=20

scientific gentleman in his absence. The learned counsel denied that Dr. At=
trabilious had ever=20

been so employed as was represented, and contended that the company had no =
other object in=20

sending him to the bedside of the smashed or mutilated traveller on their l=
ine, than to relieve his=20

pain and do the best he could for the sufferer. Dr. Attrabilious was not, h=
owever, called as a=20

witness for the defence, and the plaintiff of course did not want him; so t=
he allegation, that the=20

doctor had on former occasions played the part of negotiator in the settlem=
ent of claims against=20

his masters, did not there was a deluge of rain at three o=E2=80=99clock in=
 the afternoon, lasting a half hour;=20

and the wind blew with fury during the evening and greater part of the nigh=
t. It drove in and=20

smashed some plate-glass windows, blew off an occasional roof, and from the=
 top of the corner of=20

St. Patrick=E2=80=99s School, hurled to the sidewalk a stone weighing, prob=
ably, four hundred pounds.  The=20

story of the Louisville tornado serves to well illustrate all the peculiar =
features of the local=20

whirlwinds produced by great storms. They seldom travel more than thirty mi=
les; usually much=20

less. Sometimes as large as two miles in diameter, they seldom exceed five =
hundred yards; and=20

one of but fifty yards in diameter may be powerful enough to wreck a house.=
  Often it is possible to=20

trace the path of a tornado through the forest a century or more after its =
passage; for the reason=20

that trees once destroyed are usually replaced by different varieties. But =
the tornado usually=20

originates in the open country, though after its formation it may sweep thr=
ough heavy timber.=20

[Illustration: TORNADO FOLLOWED BY RAIN STORM.]  So far as loss of life is =
concerned, the=20

tornado is much more to be feared than lightning. About two thousand people=
 have been killed in=20

this country within ten years by these rotary storms. Yet, all over the lan=
d, people put up rods that=20

are expensive, and often worse than useless, as a precaution against lightn=
ing, when a small=20

=E2=80=9Ccyclone cellar=E2=80=9D could be dug that would be far more useful=
, and less expensive. While intense=20

electrical displays accompany the tornado, there is no authentic record of =
lightning striking during=20

one; and as will be seen in another place, the amount of electricity presen=
t seems to be rather an=20

effect than a cause: for rapid motion of gases may be made to produce power=
ful electric currents.=20

While the tornado is justly feared in this country, yet, as a destructive a=
gent, it is far surpassed by=20

a number of  [Illustration: Instantaneous View of a Tornado.]  others whose=
 ravages are less=20


_
been desirable for them to render.  The judge summed up, and said that it a=
ppeared to him very=20

like an undefended cause; but he urged the jury not to suffer their judgmen=
t to be led captive by=20

the eloquence of Mr. Capulet Attic, who had, however, acted in all respects=
 very properly for the=20

plaintiff, show, we think, that more persons have been killed in one way or=
 another by railways in=20

ten years past than by tornadoes.  The one that has been so carefully exami=
ned must not be=20

considered as the worst our country has known. An examination of records of=
 the past century will=20

show a number that were=20
