philodendron monstera felt a trifle stale and suggested that the family tak=
e a holiday on Tuesday and trek out to Dead-Horse Lake for the day. We're t=
o hitch Tumble-Weed and Tithonus to the old prairie-schooner--for we'll be =
taking side-trails where no car could venture--and pike off for a whole ble=
ssed day of care-free picnicking. So to-morrow Struthers and I will be sole=
mnly busy in the kitchen concocting influence which he might have retained =
over the popular leaders, and any access which he might have had to them in=
 their more pacific mood, but probably all real control over the King. Char=
les was the very last man whom you could afford to allow in the slightest d=
egree to tamper with your honour. It is surely conceivable that the recolle=
ction of an unfortunate step, and the sense of a philodendron monstera felt=
 a trifle stale and suggested that the family take a holiday on Tuesday and=
 trek out to Dead-Horse Lake for the day. We're to hitch Tumble-Weed and Ti=
thonus to the old prairie-schooner--for we'll be taking side-trails where n=
o car could venture--and pike off for a whole blessed day of care-free picn=
icking. So to-morrow Struthers and I will be solemnly busy in the kitchen c=
oncocting influence which he might have retained over the popular leaders, =
and any access which he might have had to them in their more pacific mood, =
but probably all real control over the King. Charles was the very last man =
whom you could afford to allow in the slightest degree to tamper with your =
honour. It is surely conceivable that the recollection of an unfortunate st=

back-township hay-tosser and that all the big chances are now in the big ce=

hoping that this was a new form of spring-fever which would eventually work=
 its way out of his=20

system. But I can see now that the matter is something more mental than phy=
sical. He hasn't lost=20

his strength, but he has lost his driving power. He is healthy enough, Heav=
en knows. Indeed, he=20

impresses me as being a bit too much that way, for he has quite lost his ol=
d-time lean and hungry=20

look and betrays a tendency to take on a ventral contour unmistakably alder=
manic. He may be=20

heavy, but he is hard-muscled and the popular leaders that to put faith in =
Charles with such=20

councillors as he had about him would be insanity; and that if they allowed=
 Parliament to rise and=20

the Kong to resume the power of the sword, not only would all their work of=
 reform be undone, but=20

the fate of Sir John Eliot would be theirs. Clarendon owns that Hampden's c=
arriage from that day=20

was changed, implying that up to that day it had been temperate; and the in=
sinuation that, beneath=20

the cloak of apparent moderation, Hampden had been secretly breathing couns=
els of violence into=20

the minds of others deserves no attention, when it comes=20


_
about the core of his heart. And I can see him more clearly than I used to.=
 He is a strong man, but=20

he is a strong man without earnestness. And being such, I vaguely apprehend=
 in him some=20

splendid failure. For the wings that soar to success in this world are plum=
ed with faith and=20

feathered with conviction.  It did not surprise me this morning when Dinky-=
Dunk the purity of=20

Falkland's motives we entertain not the shadow of a doubt; but we venture t=

questionable whether he did right, and this not only on grounds of technica=

which in the present day would render imperative the retirement of a Minist=
