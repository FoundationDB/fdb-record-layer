 PARDONS   The=20

members of the State Board of Pardons, next to the weather man, are the mos=
t severely criticised=20

in the state of Minnesota, and unjustly so. In the exercise of the authorit=
y conferred upon them the=20

Minnesota State Board of Pardons is the most conservative in the United Sta=
tes. Notwithstanding=20

the fact that they grant about seventy-five per cent less pardons than simi=
lar bodies in other=20

states, the press, in many instances, holds that it is too liberal in its d=
isposition of mercy.  The true=20

function of the Pardon Board has often been exemplified by the daily press =
of the twin cities, and=20

they appear to be unanimous in the belief that where the interest of humani=
ty or reform can be=20

benefited it is proper for the board to lighten a penalty or grant an outri=
ght rpardon.  Jesus of=20

Nazareth enunciated the wise doctrine that "if you wish to be forgiven, you=
 must forgive others,"=20

and this apothegm is the alpha and omega of the Christian religion to day. =
"Go and sin no more" is=20

often the basic principal of true reformation.                   [Pardon Bo=

Moses, Confucius, Lycurgus, Solon and Christ are intended to be just and im=
partial to all men; but=20

no law yet created by our wise jurists and statesmen can eradicate from the=
 individual the brand of=20

Cain placed upon him by society,--that of an ex- convict. The Pardon Board =
can enlarge a man's=20

liberty by making him a free citizen and a tax-payer, but it cannot free hi=
s conscience from the=20

stigma of disgrace that clings to him until the portals of eternity open to=
 receive him. We believe=20

that the pardoning power, judicially applied, is the greatest aid to true r=
eformation yet discovered.=20

The Minnesota State Board of Pardons consists of the Governor, Chief Justic=
e of the Supreme=20

Court and the Attorney General. Its meetings are held quarterly in the stat=
e capitol building, and=20

they meet on the second Monday in January, April, July and October.  The la=
w governing the=20

granting of pardons is as follows: "Such board may with Bass-strings, that =
is, the strings of Bark=20

which compose the Bass Mats, such as the Gardeners use: for that being flat=
, like Tape, will keep=20

the Fish close in the boiling, which would otherwise break, if it was tied =
with Pack-Thread. Strew=20

some Salt over the Pieces, and let them lie three Days; then provide a piec=
e of Wicker, made flat,=20

aid wide as the Copper or Cauldron you will boil your Fish in, with two or =
three Strings, fasten'd to=20

the Edges, the Ends of which should hang over the Edges of the Copper. The =
Pans we generally=20



boil our Fish in, are shallow and very broad; then make the following Pickl=
e, _viz._ one Gallon of=20

Vinegar to four Gallons of Water, and to that quantity put four Pounds of S=
alt. When this boils, put=20

in your Fish; and when it is boil'd enough, take it out, and lay it in sing=
le Pieces, upon Hurdles, to=20

drain, or upon such Boards as will not give any extraordinary Taste to the =
Fish. Some will boil in=20

this Pickle a quarter of a Pound of whole black Pepper.  When your Fish is =
quite cold, lay it in=20

clean Tubs, which are call'd Kits, and cover it with the Liquor it was boil=
'd in, and close it up, to be=20

kept for Use.  If at any time you perceive the Liquor to grow mouldy, or be=
gin to mother, pass it=20

through a Sieve; add some fresh Vinegar to it, and boil it: and when it is =
quite cold, wash your Fish=20

in some of it, and lay your Pieces a-fresh in the Tub, covering them with L=
iquor as before, and it=20

will keep good several Months. This is generally eaten with Oil and Vinegar=
.    To prepare the=20

_Caviar,_ or _Spawn,_ of the _Sturgeon._  Wash it well in Vinegar and Water=
, and then lay it in=20

Salt and Water two or three Days; then boil it in fresh Water and Salt; and=
 when it is cold, put it up=20

for Use. This is eaten upon Toasts of white Bread with a little Oil.    To =
Roast a piece of fresh=20

_Sturgeon;_ from Mr. _Ralph Titchbourn,_ Cook.  Take a piece of fresh Sturg=
eon, of about eight=20

or ten Pounds; let it lie in Water and Salt, six or eight Hours, with its g=
reat Scales on: then fasten it=20

on the Spit, and baste it well with Butter for a quarter of an Hour; and af=
ter that, drudge it with=20

grated Bread, Flour, some Nutmeg, a little Mace powder'd, Pepper and Salt, =
and some sweet=20

Herbs dry'd and powder'd, continuing basting and drudging of it till it is =
enough. Then serve it up=20

with the following Sauce, _viz._ one Pint of thin Gravey and Oyster Liquor,=
 with some Horse-

Radish, Lemon-Peel, a bunch of sweet Herbs, some whole Pepper, and a few Bl=
ades of Mace,=20

with a whole Onion, an Anchovy, a spoonfull or two of liquid Katchep, or so=

Walnuts, with half a Pint of White Wine: strain it off, and put in as much =
Butter as will thicken it. To=20

this put Oysters parboil'd, Shrimps or Prawns pickt, or the inside of a Cra=
b, which will make the=20

same Sauce very rich; then garnish with fry'd Oysters, Lemon sliced, butter=
'd Crabs and fry'd=20

Bread, cut in handsome Figures, and pickled Mushrooms. _N.B._ If you have n=
o Katchep, you=20

may use Mushroom Gravey, mention'd in the first Part of your Treatise, or s=
ome of the travelling=20

Sauce in the same Book, or else a small Tea spoonful of the dry Pocket-Sauc=
e.    To Roast a=20

Collar, or Fillet, of _Sturgeon;_ from the same.  Take a piece of fresh Stu=
rgeon; take out the=20

Bones, and cut the fleshy Part into Lengths, about seven or eight Inches; t=
hen provide some=20

Shrimps, chopt small with Oysters; some Crumbs of Bread, and such seasoning=
 of Spice as you=20

like, with a little Lemon-Peel grated. When this is done, butter one side o=
f your Fish, and strew=20

_
many editorial writers. These newspaper men are creators of public opinion,=
 and it would seem=20

possible for them to calmly, impartially consider the subject instead of di=
sseminating personal=20

ideas immature in reasoning and founded on the erroneous conception that ev=
ery person in prison=20

has received a fair, impartial trial and that the sentences must be warrant=
ed upon the trial court's=20

proceedings. In fact, the majority of editorial writers should refrain from=
 casting reflections upon=20

the pardon power because it seems too lenient or applaud it for refusing le=
niency toward=20

prisoners. Their attitude shows plainly a lack of discernable ability. Few =
prisoners appeal to the=20

pardon power of a state for clemency. Clemency is a term used for pity. Pri=
soners, as a rule,=20

detest being considered seekers after pity. This is the concealed idea of m=
any editorials, and=20

thereby erroneous. The prisoner appeals to the pardon power because it is a=
 lawfully created=20

power to entertain his appeal, which is based upon his opinions concerning =
the justice of a=20

sentence as opposed to the injustice of the trial court's imposed sentence.=
 The appellant is not=20

after pity, but expects justice. He has a right to the benefits of the law,=
 and has a right, not only to=20

ask for, but to demand justice. And no class of persons should exploit thes=
e facts more than=20

editorial writers. Today they are greatly responsible for the necessity of =
wives, children and=20

mothers practically begging for pity for some loved one in prison. We need =
Websters to interpret=20

the law and demand justice for clients--not wives, mothers and friends to b=
eg for pity."=20

She has worked a year securing evidence. It is just two days before Christm=

others plead for him also. Then the board goes into session. They decide th=

bought in Quantities of=20
