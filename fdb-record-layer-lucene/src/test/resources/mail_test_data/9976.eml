tea, and swallowed our slices of water-melons and the greater portion of th=
e bread from the table=20

a few moments before we were seated. These birds appeared to enjoy life ama=
zingly; one kind of=20

food was as sweet as another; they attacked a basket of white porcelain bea=
ds that had been=20

returned by Mr. Petherick's men, and swallowed them in great numbers in mis=
take for dhurra, until=20

they were driven off; they were the scavengers of the courtyard, that consu=
med the dung of the=20

camels and horses, together with all other impurities.  For some months we =
resided at Khartoum,=20

as it was necessary to make extensive preparations for the White Nile exped=
ition, and to await the=20

arrival of the north wind, which would enable us to start early in December=
. Although the north and=20

south winds blow alternately for six months, and the former commences in Oc=
tober, it does not=20

extend many degrees southward until the beginning of December. This is a gr=
eat drawback to=20

White Nile exploration, as when near the north side of the equator, the dry=
 season commences in=20

November, and closes in February; thus, the departure from Khartoum should =
take place by a=20

steamer in the latter part of September; that would enable the traveller to=
 leave Gondokoro, lat. N.=20

4 degrees 54 minutes, shortly before November; he would then secure three m=
onths of favourable=20

weather for an advance inland.  Having promised Mek Nimmur that I would lay=
 his proposals for=20

peace before the Governor-General of the Soudan, I called upon Moosa Pasha =
at the public divan,=20

and delivered the message; but he would not listen to any intercession, as =
he assured me that=20

Mek Nimmur was incorrigible, and there would be no real peace until his dea=
th, which would be=20

very speedy should he chance to fall into his hands. He expressed great sur=
prise at our having=20

escaped from his territory, and he declared his intention of attacking him =
after he should have=20

given the Abyssinians a lesson, for whom he was preparing an expedition in =
reply to an insolent=20

letter that he had received from King Theodore. The King of Abyssinia had w=
ritten to him upon a=20

question can help you, an' are willin', why it's well enough; but if you ha=
ven't got friends, its o' no=20

manner o' use to try anything, except pocket-pickin' or house-breakin'."  "=
Come, Phil," said Ned,=20

laughing, as he helped himself to a huge round of buttered toast, "I 'ope y=
ou han't made up your=20

mind to go in for either of them professions, for they don't pay.  They ent=
ail hard work, small=20

profits, an' great risk--not to mention the dishonesty of 'em. But I don't =
agree with you about=20

London neither."  "You never agree with nobody about anythink," observed Mr=
s Crashington, in a=20

low tone, as if the remark were made to the teapot; but Ned heard it, and h=
is temper was sorely=20

tried again, for, while the remark was utterly false as regarded himself, i=
t was particularly true as=20

regarded his wife.  However, he let it pass, and continued--  "You see, Phi=
l, London, as you know,=20

is a big place, the population of it being equal to that of all Scotland--s=
o I'm told, though it ain't=20

easy to swallow that.  Now it seems to me that where there's so many people=
 an' so much doin', it=20

ought to be the very place for smart, stout fellows like you.  If I was you=
, I'd--"  "Yes, but you=20

_ain't_ him," interrupted Mrs Crashington, testily, "so it won't do him muc=
h good to tell what you=20

would or wouldn't do."  "I've heard of wives, Maggie, who _sometimes_ tried=
 to be agreeable," said=20

Ned, gravely.  "If I don't suit you, why did you marry me?" demanded Maggie=
.  "Ah, why indeed?"=20

said Ned, with a frown.  At this critical point in the conversation, little=
 Fred, who was afraid that a=20

storm was on the point of bursting forth, chanced to overturn his tin mug o=
f tea.  His mother was=20

one of those obtuse women who regard an accident as a sin, to be visited by=
 summary=20

punishment.  Her usual method of inflicting punishment was by means of an o=
pen-handed slap on=20

the side of the head. On this occasion she dealt out the measure of justice=
 with such good-will,=20



that poor little Fred was sent sprawling and howling on the floor.  This wa=
s too much for Ned, who=20

was a tender-hearted man.  The blood rushed to his face; he sprang=20


_
substance of the document was a declaration that the Egyptians had no right=
 to Khartoum, and=20

that the natural boundary of Abyssinia was the junction of the Blue and Whi=
te Niles as far north as=20

Shendy (Mek Nimmur's original country); and from that point, in a direct li=
ne, to the Atbara; but=20

that, as the desert afforded no landmark, he should send his people to dig =
a ditch from the Nile to=20

the Atbara, and he requested that chair, seized his cap, and, without utter=
ing a word, dashed out=20

of the room, and went downstairs three steps at a time.  What Ned meant to =
do, or where to go, of=20

course no one could tell, for he had no definite intentions in his own mind=
, but his energies were=20

unexpectedly directed for him.  On rushing out at the street door, he found=
 himself staggering=20

unexpectedly in the arms of Bob Clazie.  "Hullo!  Bob, what's up?"=20
