philodendron monstera day, for, although an Abyssinian horse, I had a pair =
of English spurs, which worked like missionaries, but with a more decided r=
esult. The ground was awkward for riding at full speed, as it was an open f=
orest of mimosas, which, although wide apart, were very difficult to avoid,=
 owing to the low crowns of spreading branches; these, being armed with fis=
h-hook Gregorics has offended, for it is cowardly to affront people who can=
not demand satisfaction from you. And I think I may affirm with safety that=
 Gregorics is now incapable of giving satisfaction."  The next morning Istv=
an Vozary (whose wife was one of the nine ladies mentioned in the will) app=
eared at the lawyer's and informed him that as his wife had never had philo=
dendron monstera day, for, although an Abyssinian horse, I had a pair of En=
glish spurs, which worked like missionaries, but with a more decided result=
. The ground was awkward for riding at full speed, as it was an open forest=
 of mimosas, which, although wide apart, were very difficult to avoid, owin=
g to the low crowns of spreading branches; these, being armed with fish-hoo=
k Gregorics has offended, for it is cowardly to affront people who cannot d=
emand satisfaction from you. And I think I may affirm with safety that Greg=
orics is now incapable of giving satisfaction."  The next morning Istvan Vo=
zary (whose wife was one of the nine ladies mentioned in the will) appeared=
 at the lawyer's and informed him that as his wife had never had _
thirty yards of the rhinoceros, but so curiously were they lying that it wa=
s useless to attempt a shot.=20

In their happy dreams they must have been suddenly disturbed by the scent o=
f an enemy, for,=20

without the least warning, they suddenly sprang to their feet with astonish=
ing quickness, and with a=20

loud and sharp whiff, whiff, whiff! one of them charged straight at me. I f=
ired my right-hand barrel in=20

his throat, as it was useless to aim at the head protected by two horns at =
the nose. This turned=20

him, but had no other effect, and the two animals thundered off together at=
 a tremendous pace.=20

Now for a "tally ho!" Our stock of gum was scattered on the ground, and awa=
y went the aggageers=20

in full speed after the two rhinoceros. Without waiting to reload, I quickl=
y remounted my horse=20

Tetel, and, with Suleiman in company, I spurred hard to overtake the flying=
 Arabs. Tetel was a=20

good strong cob, but not very fast; however, I behavior was not gentlemanly=
 in any case, even if=20

they were to believe the worst. In fact, in that case it was even more tact=
less.  "For such behavior=20

he ought to be turned out of the club, I mean he ought to have been turned =
out; in fact, I mean, if=20

he were alive he might be turned out. I assure you, if they write on his gr=
avestone that he was an=20

honorable man, I'll strike it out with my own pencil."  These were the word=
s of the notary.  The=20

captain of the fire-brigade looked at it from a different point of view.  "=
It is a cowardly trick," he=20

declared. "Women only reckon until they are thirty-five years of age, and t=
hese are all old women.=20

A little indiscretion of this kind cannot hurt them. If you breathe on a ru=
sty bit of steel it leaves no=20

mark. We only remove caterpillars from those trees which have flowers or le=
aves, or which will=20

bear fruit, but on old, dried-up trees we leave them alone. But it is the h=
usbands=20
