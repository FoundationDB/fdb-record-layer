Murray sent in one substitute after another until finally big Tom Curwood a=
nd Teeny-bits were the=20

only regulars left. Tracey Campbell then took Teeny-bits' place.  With an e=
ntire team of substitutes=20

on the field Ridgley was at first able to hold her own against Dale, but pr=
esently the visiting team=20

seemed to see its opportunity and by persistent rushing crossed the Ridgley=
 goal line. Had it not=20

been for the strong playing of Tracey Campbell, the Dale team might have sc=
ored at least another=20

goal; Campbell was the main strength of the substitutes and again and again=
 stopped the rushes=20

of the Dale regulars. There was no question about Campbell's right to the p=
lace of first substitute=20

back.  After the game, Coach Murray announced the probable line-up of the t=
eam for the Jefferson=20

contest. There were no surprises. Neil Durant, Ned Stillson and Teeny-bits =
were to play in the=20

back-field with Dean, the regular quarter-back.  That week-end Tracey Campb=
ell went home to the=20

"mansion" on the hillock. After the game with Dale he approached Neil Duran=
t and invited the=20

captain to be his guest. He did not say that he was acting under orders fro=
m his father. The elder=20

Campbell was ambitious for his son to be prominent, as befitted the preserv=
ing occasionally a few=20

of the most interesting specimens, was all I could do. The specimens you ha=
ve received. The=20

narrative I am about to give, is drawn principally from the notes which wer=
e taken on the journey,=20

and will be confined to a simple _statement of such facts_ as were either o=
bserved by myself, or=20

derived from good authority. Their application to preconceived theories, I =
leave to those who have=20

more leisure and disposition for speculation than myself.  A description of=
 a few natural and=20

artificial curiosities which came under particular notice, will not, I trus=
t, be thought an improper=20

digression. The whole is committed to your disposal; and if it shall add bu=
t one mite to the treasury=20

of American Natural History, I shall be gratified, and rejoice to have made=
 even this small=20

remuneration for your unwearied efforts, to impart to one, formerly your pu=
pil, a love for Natural=20

Science.   _The Author's Route._  My route was in a line nearly direct from=
 Boston to New-

Orleans; passing through the principal cities to Washington; thence, diagon=
ally, through Virginia,=20

East Tennessee, and the northwestern angle of Georgia; in a western course =
through the north=20

division of the Territory of Alabama, to the=20


_
written a letter to Tracey that week in which he had devoted two pages to a=
dvice in the matter of=20

"getting ahead." One of his bits of instruction ran as follows:       "Ther=
e's one lesson you've got to=20

learn right now--the lesson of      politics. Every big man knows how to us=
e his friends to help him=20

along. Don't let the other fellow beat you out by getting the      inside c=
ourse. Get the _jump_ on=20

him. Now this football business is      just like any other business--you'v=
e got to use friends. I want=20

you      to ask that Durant fellow home over the week-end. He must have    =
  influence with the=20

coach. Bring some others too, if you want to."  Campbell put his invitation=
 as casually as he could.=20

"The old man wants me to bring some one home with me this State of Mississi=
ppi; and thence in a=20

line nearly southwest to Natchez. From this last place I descended the rive=
r Mississippi to New-

Orleans. On my return I frequently varied from this course, and had increas=
ed opportunities for=20

surveying the country. In both instances I passed through the countries bel=
onging to the=20

Cherokee, Chickesaw, and Choctaw tribes of Indians, and travelled among the=
m, in all, about one=20

thousand miles.   _Geology of Virginia._  As others have described more min=
utely and accurately=20

than I can, the country north of Virginia, I shall begin with a few remarks=
 on the geological=20

character of that State. It is there that the traveller, in passing from th=
e Atlantic to the interior,=20

crosses successively the most important formations of the earth,=20


_
want to come? Thought we could go to a show in Greensboro and to-morrow we'=
ll tour around in=20

the car."  Durant looked at Campbell keenly, but he showed neither surprise=
 nor indifference. "It's=20

mighty good of you to ask me," said the captain, "but I can't make it; I've=
 got to study to-night, and=20

to-morrow I think I'd better stay at the school. Much obliged, though!"  "S=
orry. Some other time will=20

be just as good."  Campbell spoke in an off-hand manner, but his words did =
not express the=20

thoughts in his mind.  It was the faithful Bassett who finally went home wi=
th Campbell and=20

accompanied him to the theater in Greensboro. At dinner Bassett put in a fe=
w words of praise for=20

Tracey and phrased them in such a way that without telling any actual false=
hoods he gave the=20

impression that the game with Dale had been an important one and that Trace=
y had been chiefly=20

responsible for saving Ridgley from defeat.  Tracey took the compliments gr=
acefully and even=20

denied that he had done _quite_ as much as Bassett asserted.  "You mustn't =
be _too_ modest,=20

Tracey," declared Mrs. Campbell in her shrill most recent alluvial to the o=
ldest primitive. For a=20

considerable distance from the coast, the country is alluvial. It then assu=
mes an older secondary=20

formation[30]--and sandstone and puddingstone are frequent. This is the cha=
racter of the District=20

of Columbia, and indeed of a great part of the valley of the Potomac.   _Sa=
ndstone of the Capitol,=20

&c._  In this valley, and adjacent to the river, is found the _sandstone_ o=
f which the President's=20

house, and the Capitol are constructed. It is composed of fine silicious gr=
ains, is easily wrought,=20

and from its colour, has the appearance at a small distance of white marble=
.   _Beautiful Breccia._=20

It is also in the valley of this river, and not far from its famous passage=
 through the Blue Ridge,=20

that immense quarries of beautiful Breccia have been opened. This rock was =
first brought into use=20

by Mr. Latrobe, for some years employed by the government as principal arch=
itect. It is composed=20

of pebbles, and fragments of silicious and calcareous stones of almost ever=
y size, from a grain, to=20

several inches in diameter, strongly and perfectly=20


_
you've won the letter that you talk so much about."  "You know about as muc=
h football as a=20

porcupine, Ma!" exclaimed Tracey. "A fellow has to play in the Jefferson ga=
me to get his R."  "Well=20

I'm glad you've proved that you've got the goods," declared Campbell, senio=
r. "If you do as well in=20

the big game I might be favorable toward giving you that racy runabout you'=
ve been nagging me to=20

buy you."     CHAPTER VI  DISCOVERIES   That third week in November at Ridg=
ley School was=20

like the home stretch in a mile race. The finish was in sight and the victo=
ry could be lost or won by=20

what was about to take place. The Ridgley team was trailing--every one admi=
tted that--but by a=20

magnificent burst of speed it might yet come abreast of its rival--and migh=
t even snatch the victory.=20

Nothing is impossible; we can do it if we have the spirit: that was the wor=
d on every one's lips--

spirit not alone in the team but in the heart of every son of Ridgley,--suc=
h a spirit through the=20

whole school that those eleven fellows in whom rested the entire hope of se=
veral hundred should=20

go on the field with the conviction that however well the Jefferson team pl=
ayed, the Ridgley team=20

would play better.  There were mass meetings at which Coach Murray and Neil=
 Durant and=20

prominent members of the team spoke. All of them made the point that victor=
y depended on the=20

spirit of the whole school as well as on the team. At the meeting on Monday=
 night in Lincoln Hall=20

after Neil Durant had spoken, some one in the crowd yelled, "We want Teeny-=
bits," and the cry=20

was instantly taken up by others until in the space of a few seconds the wh=
ole hall was resounding=20

to the concerted clamor for the smallest and the newest member of the eleve=
n.  There was some=20

little delay, for Teeny-bits, surprised and dismayed, had settled himself l=
ower in his seat, hoping=20

thereby to escape detection until a demand had started for some other membe=
r of the team. But=20

the Ridgleyites who were sitting beside him yelled, "Here he is!" and Neil =
Durant, perceiving him at=20

last, leaped down from the platform and laid hold on him with vigorous hand=
s. In a second or two=20

Teeny-bits was standing up there facing the school with such a shout of gre=
eting ringing in his=20

ears that his head swam a little. There was no room for the slightest doubt=
 that the sons of Ridgley=20

liked this quiet, unassuming, new member of the school and that they admire=
d his manner of=20

saying little but doing much. The school would have excused various, and of=
ten bright. Red, white,=20

brown, gray, and green, are alternately conspicuous, with every intermediat=
e shade. Owing to the=20

silicious stones which are frequently imbedded through the mass, it is wrou=
ght with much difficulty;=20

but when finished, shows a fine polish, and is unquestionably one of the mo=
st beautifully=20

variegated marbles, that ever ornamented any place. It would be difficult t=
o conceive of any thing=20

more grand than the hall of the Representatives, in the Capitol, supported =
as it is by twenty or=20

thirty pillars formed of the solid rock, and placed in an amphitheatrical r=
ange; each pillar about=20

three feet in diameter, and twenty in height. Some idea of the labour which=
 is employed in working=20

the marble may be formed from the fact, that the expense of each pillar is =
estimated at five=20

thousand dollars. The specimens in your possession, are good examples of it=
s general structure,=20

but convey no adequate idea of its beauty.   _Petrifaction of Wood._  It wi=
ll be proper to notice in=20

this place, a petrifaction of wood which is found on the road from Washingt=
on to Fredericksburgh,=20

16 miles from the latter, and four miles north of the court-house in Staffo=
rd county. It is remarkable=20

for its size, rather than for any singularity in the composition. It was fo=
und by digging away the=20

earth on the side of the road, and appears to have been the trunk of a cons=
iderable tree. It is firmly=20

fixed in the ground, and penetrates it obliquely; how far has not yet been =
ascertained. At the time I=20

saw it about two feet had been exposed. The diameter is about eight inches.=
 Its colour is white,=20



sometimes resembling that of wood. The fibres are well preserved, and so is=
 the general structure.=20

It is much to be desired, that some one would clear it from its bed, and gi=
ve it entire to one of our=20

mineralogical cabinets.   _Geological Features._  Next to the alluvial and =
secondary formations, as=20

you pass to the west and northwest, are to be found ranges of granite and s=
histose, and other=20

primitive rocks; interspersed with these may be seen sandstone, clay, slate=
, quartz, and limestone.=20

Granite ranges were particularly seen in the neighbourhood of Fredericksbur=
gh, crossing the=20

Rappahannock; and in Orange and Albemarle counties, extending nearly to the=
 Blue Ridge. Great=20

quantities of quartz and quartz rock, sometimes covering with their fragmen=
ts the sides of hills, are=20

frequent. Another, and more interesting rock in the same connexion, is foun=
d in=20


_
if he had stammered a bit and sat down to cover his embarrassment, but ther=
e was no need for=20

excuses of any sort. Teeny-bits suddenly found that he had something to say=
 and he said it in a=20

manner that brought the already enthusiastic crowd to its feet.  "I want to=
 tell you," he said, "that=20

I'm glad Jefferson has such a good team; every one says it's the best their=
 to what class to refer it.=20

But from its resemblance to the rocks of the east and west mountains near N=
ew-Haven, I ventured=20

to call it trap or whinstone. It becomes more abundant as you approach the =
Blue Ridge, and the=20

granite disappears. On the sides and summit of the mountain, its appearance=
 is more decidedly=20

that of greenstone. In crossing the southwest mountain,=20
