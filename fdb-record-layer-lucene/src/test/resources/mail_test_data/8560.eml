But in the dark she lay listening to the strange low hub-hub from outside. =
And it made her think of=20

what she had seen an hour before, when at the open window, resting her elbo=
ws on the sill, she=20

had begun to make her acquaintance with her backyard--a yawning abyss of br=
ick and cement=20

which went down and down to cement below, and up and up to a strip of blue =
sky, and to right and=20

to left went stretching away with rows and rows of windows. And now as the =
murmurs and quick=20

low cries, piano music, a baritone voice and a sudden burst of laughter, ca=
me to her ears, she=20

gravely named her neighbours:  "Wives and husbands, divorcees, secret lover=
s, grafters, burglars,=20

suffragettes, its certificate, and such diploma or evidence and certificate=

surgery their profession or business continuously for ten years, and can fu=
rnish satisfactory=20

 all. You'll need your=20

strength for tomorrow."  From the city far and near came numberless other v=
oices. From street=20

cars, motors and the L, from boats far off on the river this calm and still=
 October night, from=20

Broadway and from Harlem and the many teeming slums, came the vast murmurin=
g voice of the=20

town. And she thought:  "I'm becoming a part of all this!" She listened a l=
ittle and added, "It=20

breathes, like something quite alive." She smiled and added approvingly, "Q=
uite right, my dear,=20

just  The holder of a certificate should have it recorded in the office of =
the clerk of the county in=20

which he resides, and the record indorsed thereon, and on removing to anoth=

as though you were sleeping. Keep me company tonight."  Suddenly she rememb=
ered how in their=20

taxi from the train, as they had sped up Park Avenue all agleam with its co=
ld blue lights and she=20

had chattered gaily of anything that came into her head, twice she had caug=
ht in her sister's eyes=20

that glimmer of expectancy. "Amy feels sure I will be a success!" Ethel thr=
illed at the recollection,=20

and thought, "Oh, yes, you're quite a wag, my love; and as soon as you get =
over being so young=20

you'll probably make a name for yourself. No dinner or suffrage party will =
ever again be quite=20

complete without your droll dry humour. . . . I suppose I ought to be going=
 to sleep!"  And she=20

yawned excitedly. From somewhere far in the distance there came to her ears=
 the dull bellowing=20

roar of an ocean liner leaving dock at one o'clock to start the long journe=
y over the sea.  "I'm going=20

to Paris, too!" she resolved. Her fancy travelled over the ocean and roamed=
 madly for awhile, with=20

the help of many photographs which she had seen in magazines. But she weari=
ed of that and=20

soon returned.  "Well, what do I think of Amy's home?"  She went over in he=
r memory her eager=20

inspection of the apartment. The rooms had been dark when they arrived; for=
 they had not been=20

expected so soon, and a somewhat dishevelled Irish maid had opened the door=
 and let them in.=20

With a quick annoyed exclamation, Amy had switched on the lights; and room =
after room as it=20

leaped into view had appeared to Ethel's eyes like parts of a suite in some=
 rich hotel. And although=20

as her sister went about moving chairs a bit this way and that and putting =
things on the table to=20

rights, it took on a little more the semblance of somebody's home, still th=
at first impression had=20

remained in Ethel's mind.  "People have sat in this room," she had thought,=
 "but they haven't lived=20

here. They haven't sewed or read aloud or talked things out and out and out=
."  To her sister she=20

had been loud in her praise. What a perfectly lovely room it was, what a wo=
nderful lounge with the=20

table behind it, and what lamps, what a heavenly rug and how well it went w=
ith the curtains! When=20

Amy lighted the gas logs, Ethel had drawn a quick breath of dismay. But the=
n she had sharply told=20

herself:  "This isn't an old frame house in Ohio, this is a gay little plac=
e in New York! You're going=20

to love it, living here! And you're pretty much of a kid, my dear, to be cr=
iticizing like an old maid!"=20

She had gone into Amy's room, and there her mood had quickly changed. For t=
he curtains and the=20

deep soft rug, the broad low dressing table with its drop-light shaded in c=
hintz, the curious gold=20

lacquered chair, the powder boxes, brushes, trays, the faint delicious perf=
ume of the place; and=20

back in the shadow, softly curtained, the low wide luxurious bed--had given=
 to her the feeling that=20

this room at least was personal. Here two people had really lived--a man an=
d a woman. There had=20

come into Ethel's brown eyes a mingling of confused delight and awkward adm=
iration. And her=20

sister, with a quick look and a smile, had lost the slightly ruffled expres=
sion her face had worn in=20

the other rooms. She had regained her ascendancy.  It had not been until Et=
hel was left in her own=20

small room adjoining, that with an exclamation of remembrance and surprise =
she had stopped=20

undressing, opened her door and listened in the silence. "How perfectly unc=
anny!" Frowning a=20

moment, puzzled, her eye had gone to the only other room in the apartment, =
down at the end of=20

the narrow hall. The door had been closed. She had stolen to it and listene=
d, but at first she had=20

not heard a sound. Then she had given a slight start, had knocked softly an=
d asked, "May I come=20

in?" A woman's voice with a hostile note had replied, "Yes, ma'am." She had=
 entered. And a=20

moment later, down on her knees before a grave little girl of two who sat a=
t a tiny table soberly=20

having her supper, Ethel had cried:  "Oh, you adorable baby!"  For a time s=
he had tried to make=20

friends with the child, but the voice of the nurse had soon cut in. And in =
the motherly Scotch face=20



Ethel had detected again a feeling of hostility. "What for?" she had asked.=
 And the answer had=20

flashed into her mind. "She's angry because Amy hasn't been in to see Suset=
te." And Ethel had=20

frowned. "It's funny. If I had been away three days--"  She had gone back t=
o her own room and=20

began slowly to take off her things. And a few minutes after that, she had =
heard the sick, or=20

to his young sister-in-law=20

the impression of kindly friendliness she had had from him some years befor=

to be afraid of in Joe. But she had noticed the change in his face, the sli=
ghtly tightened harassed=20

expression. And she had thought:  "You poor man. How hard you have been wor=
king."  And yet=20

she could not say he looked tired, for at dinner his talk had been almost b=
oyish in its welcoming=20

good humour. Later he had drawn her aside and had said with a touch of awkw=
ardness:  "No use=20

in talking about it, of course. I just want you to know I'm so glad you're =
here." She had clutched his=20

hand:  "That's nice of you, Joe." And then she had turned from him, and wit=

inside she had added quite inaudibly: "Oh, Dad, dearest! I'm so homesick! J=
