He was the son of Gerard de Montagu, a bourgeois of Paris,   secretary to k=

Through his great interest at court, his   two brothers were presented, one=

Paris, the other   to the archbishoprick of Sens and office of chancellor. =
 Footnote 89:    This term=20

Alen=C3=A7on reverted to the crown on the death of   Charles III. the last =
duke, in 1525.  Footnote 93:=20

Louis II. son of Louis duke of Anjou and king of Naples, brother to   king =
Charles V. whose=20

expedition is recorded by Froissart.  Footnote 94:    The devices of the tw=
o parties are different in=20

Pontus Heuterus.   (Rerum Burgundicarum, l. 3.) According to him, the Orlea=
ns-men bore on=20

their lances a white pennon, with the inscription, _Jacio Aleam_; and   the=
 Burgundians set up in=20

opposition pennons of purple, inscribed   _Accipio conditionem_.  Footnote =
95:    William II. count=20

of Namur.  Footnote 96:    Monstrelet is mistaken as to the names of the en=
glish ambassadors.=20

The   first embassy took place the 22d March 1406, and the ambassadors were=
   the bishop of=20

Winchester, Thomas lord de Camoys, John Norbury,   esquire, and master John=
 Cateryk,=20

treasurer of the cathedral of   Lincoln.    A second credential letter is g=
iven to the bishop of=20

Winchester   _alone_, of the same date. Another credential is given to the =
same   prelate, bearing=20

similar date, to contract a marriage with the eldest   or any other daughte=
r of the king of France,=20

and Henry prince of   Wales.    See the F=C5=93dera, anno 1406.  Footnote 9=
7:    This is a mistake. His=20

true name was Peter de Breban, surnamed le   Clugnet, lord of Landreville. =
 Footnote 98:    Mary,=20

daughter of William I. count of Namur, married first to Guy de   Ch=C3=A2ti=
llon, count of Blois, and=20

secondly to this admiral de Breban. On   the deaths of both her brothers (W=
illiam II. in 1418, and=20

John III. in   1428) she became countess of Namur in her own right; and aft=
er her it   came to=20

Philip the good, duke of Burgundy, as a reversion to the   earldom of Fland=
ers.  Footnote 99:=20

Frederick, second son of John duke of Lorraine, and brother of Charles   th=
e bold, obtained the=20

county of Vaudemont (originally a branch of   Lorraine) by marriage with Ma=
rgaret daughter and=20

heir of Henry V.   count of Vaudemont and Joinville.  Footnote 100:    Oliv=

Penthievre and viscount of Limoges,   grandson of Charles de Blois, the unf=
ortunate competitor=20

with John de   Montfort for the duchy of Bretagne.  Footnote 101:    Son to=
 the duke of Bourbon.=20

Footnote 102:    John de Hangest, lord of Huqueville.  Footnote 103:    Cal=
led in the Catalogue of=20

the Bishops of Liege, by Joannes   Placentius, Henry lord of Parewis. The n=
ame of his son, the=20



elected   bishop, was Theodoric de Parewis. Pontus Heuterus says, they were=
   descended from=20

the ancient dukes of Brabant.  Footnote 104:    He narrowly escaped being m=
assacred, with all his=20

household, at St   Tron, by a body of the rabble, who burst into the monast=
ery with that   intent. His=20

own personal courage alone saved him in that extremity.  Footnote 105:    A=
ngelus Corrarius, a=20

noble Venetian, elected at Rome after the death   of Innocent VII. He assum=
ed the name of=20

Gregory XII.  Footnote 106:    See the F=C5=93dera. The ambassadors were, s=
ir Thomas Erpingham,=20

John   Cateryk, clerk, and Hugh Mortimer, treasurer to the prince of Wales.=
    Other credentials are=20

given in December of this year, wherein the   bishop of Durham is added to =
the above=20

ambassadors.  Footnote 107:    It is not very easy to say to what this chap=
ter can refer. There=20

appears to have been no expedition into Scotland at this period, nor   at a=
ny other, to which the=20

facts here related bear the least   resemblance. Is it entirely a fabricati=
on of Monstrelet? I have=20

looked   at Hollingshed, Stowe and Henry.  Footnote 108:    St Jangon=E2=80=

french corruption of St John=E2=80=99s Town.  Footnote 109:    Raoul d=E2=

Footnote 110:    The Guillemins were an order of hermits, instituted by Gui=
llaume, duke   of=20

Guienne and count of Poitou. They succeeded to the church-convent   of the =
Blanc-Manteaus,=20

instituted by St Louis.  Footnote 111:    The name of the adulteress was Ma=

113:    Consult Bayle and Brant=C3=B4me for a singular anecdote respecting =
the   private reasons which=20

urged the duke to commit this murder.  Footnote 114:    The monk of St Deni=

History of Charles VI. adds the   following damning clause to his account o=
f this foul=20

transaction:=E2=80=94=E2=80=98But   what raised to the highest pitch the ho=
rror of the princes at the   blackness of=20

soul displayed by the duke was, that very shortly before,   he not only was=
 reconciled but entered=20

into an alliance of brotherly   love with the duke of Orleans. They had yet=
 more recently confirmed=20

it, both by letters and oaths, insomuch that they called God to   witness i=
t, and received the=20

communion together. They had every   appearance of an entire union in the c=
onduct of the war=20

which was   committed to their charge: they had defended one another=E2=80=
=99s honour from   the bad=20

success which attended them: it seemed as if they had only one   interest; =
and, for a yet greater=20

token of union and of love, the duke   of Burgundy, hearing that the duke o=
f Orleans was=20

indisposed, visited   him with all the marks, I do not say of civility but,=
 of tender   affection, and=20

even accepted an invitation to dine with him the next   day, being Sunday. =
The other princes of the=20

blood, knowing all this,   could not but conceive the most extreme indignat=
ion at so horrible a=20

procedure: they therefore refused to listen to his excuses,=E2=80=94and the=
   next morning, when he came=20

to the parliament-chamber, they forbade him   entrance.=E2=80=99 See Bayle,=
 Art. =E2=80=98Petit.=E2=80=99 The reconciliation=20

here mentioned   is also alluded to, ch. xliv.  Footnote 115:    =E2=80=98T=
he noble duke of Bourbon,=E2=80=99 says=20

the monk of St Denis, =E2=80=98was nominated   to this embassy, but he gene=
rously excused himself from=20

it: he would   not even remain any longer at court, but demanded leave to r=
etire to   his own=20

estates; for he loved better to renounce the share which he   had in the go=
vernment than consent=20

to compound with the state for the   murder of his nephew, which made him e=
xclaim loudly, and=20

many times,   as I have been assured, that he could never look with a favou=
rable eye   upon the=20

author of a treason so cowardly and so infamous.=E2=80=99 See Bayle,   _ubi=
 supra_.  Footnote 116:    This=20

shows how general wooden buildings were still in the 15th   century.  Footn=
ote 117:    The titles of=20



Guienne and Acquitaine were always used   indiscriminately.  Footnote 118: =

and brother of Edward,=20

been employed twice before to plead on=20

occasions of   the first importance. The first was in favour of the univers=
ity   against some=20

accusations of the cardinal-legate in 1406; the second,   at Rome before po=
pe Gregory, on the=20

20th of July 1407, on the subject   of the king=E2=80=99s proposal for a te=
rmination of the schism. The very=20

curious performance with which we are here presented was publicly   condemn=
ed by the bishop of=20

Paris and the university as soon as they   were out of fear from the immedi=
ate presence of the=20

duke of Burgundy,   and burnt by the common hangman. See, in Bayle, further=
 particulars of   the=20

work and its author.  Footnote 120:    See the 19th chap. 2 Samuel.  Footno=
te 121:    This is a very=20

striking allusion to a particular custom at   tournaments, and sometimes in=

Sainte Palaye   gives a most interesting account in the =E2=80=98Memoires s=
ur l=E2=80=99Ancienne   Chevalerie.=E2=80=99=20

The exclamation, =E2=80=98Aux filz des Preux!=E2=80=99 was evidently used t=
o encourage   young knights to emulate=20

the glories of their ancestors, and to do   nothing unworthy the noble titl=
e given them; and in many=20

instances it   was attended with the most animating consequences.    The gr=
eatest misfortune=20

attending on a translation of french   chronicles is the total absence in o=
ur language of an=20

expression   answerable to the french word =E2=80=98preux,=E2=80=99 which c=
onveys in itself whole   volumes of=20

meaning. Spencer ventured to adapt the word in its   superlative degree to =
the english tongue. He=20

says somewhere =E2=80=98the   _prowest_ knight alive.=E2=80=99 In fact, the=
 word =E2=80=98preux=E2=80=99 may be considered   as=20

summing up the whole catalogue of knightly virtues in one   expression.    =

works calculated using the method   you already the lower part of the spine=
 and not very severe.=20

The commonest cause of fracture-dislocation of the spine is forced flexion =
of the spinal column.=20

Injuries to the spine are generally the result of falls or blows on the spi=
ne, especially in its lower=20

part. Lutaud[667] states that after forced flexion of the spine without fra=
cture paraplegia may=20

sometimes occur, which is attributed to forced elongation of the cord. This=
 paraplegia, which may=20

seem to be grave, is completely recovered from as a rule.  Incised or punct=
ured wounds of the=20

spinal cord are rare, as it is so well protected except in the very highest=
 part behind. Here between=20

the occiput and the atlas and between the latter and the axis, and to a les=
s extent between the=20

axis and the third cervical vertebra, the cord is more exposed, owing to th=
e narrowness of the=20

lamin=C3=A6. It is here that _pithing_ is done, which is almost instantly f=
atal, as the medulla oblongata=20

and upper part of the spinal cord are the parts injured, and they contain t=
he respiratory and other=20

vital centres. Pithing may be done with such a small needle-like instrument=
 as to leave scarcely=20

any trace. Only a slightly bloody streak may persist, which may appear supe=
rficial if the instrument=20

is introduced obliquely. Such a mark in this location with no other apparen=
t cause of death should=20

always lead to an examination of the upper part of the cord, which will alw=
ays reveal the cause of=20

death in such cases. Pithing is practised especially in infanticide.  As wi=
th the brain, so with the=20

spinal cord, we may have CONCUSSION due to the shock of a contusing blow. C=
oncussion of the=20

spinal cord, as of the brain, may be fatal without showing scarcely a mark =
of violence externally or=20

internally. As the cord is so well protected from injury, it must be extrem=
ely rare to have=20

concussion of the cord without some actual lesion of its substance. As conc=
ussion of the cord is=20

not often the result of the injuries of which we are treating, but rather o=
f railroad injuries and the=20

like, it will not be considered at length in this connection. As a result o=
f a blow or fall on the spine=20

or communicated to it, hemorrhage may occur in the substance of the cord or=
 around it between or=20

outside its membranes. In very rare cases such a hemorrhage may occur spont=
aneously as the=20

result of disease, of which the writer has seen one case. It may be associa=
ted with concussion or=20

laceration of the cord. It may destroy life directly by extension or indire=
ctly by leading to a=20

spreading inflammation. Hemorrhage in or about the cord causes a gradual co=
mpression of the=20

cord, and in cases of fracture of the spine often adds to the compression d=
ue to the displacement=20

of the bones. In hemorrhage into the substance of the cord paralysis comes =
on early or=20

immediately and may be complete while symptoms of irritation fail. The latt=
er symptoms are most=20

marked in meningeal hemorrhage in which paralysis is delayed in appearance =
and generally=20

incomplete. The products of an inflammation due to an injury may compress t=
he spinal cord in the=20

same way that hemorrhage does.  Wounds and injuries of the varieties we are=
 considering,=20

affecting the spine and spinal cord, are generally accidental, less often h=
omicidal, and almost=20

never suicidal.   WOUNDS OF THE THORAX AND THORACIC ORGANS.  =3DWounds of t=
he=20

thorax caused by incising, puncturing, or blunt instruments.=3D These wound=
s are most often=20

punctured wounds; contused wounds are common and incised wounds are not rar=
e. They are=20

perhaps most often homicidal in origin or at least inflicted by another, an=
d the accidental origin of=20

these wounds is probably the least common.  Incised or punctured non-penetr=
ating wounds of the=20

thoracic wall are rarely grave. Bleeding, as a rule, is not serious, though=
 it may be quite free. Such=20

wounds may be accompanied by emphysema, though not penetrating, owing to th=
e movements of=20



the chest and a valve-like action of the edges of the wound. Contused wound=
s of the thorax are=20

more dangerous, especially if the violence was great, owing to the complica=
ting fracture of the=20

ribs, rupture of the thoracic viscera, etc.  FRACTURE OF THE RIBS is a comm=
on result of=20

contusions of the chest. It is more dangerous when due to a direct blow or =
injury, as then the=20

splintering occurs internally and may wound the lungs, heart, or large vess=
els, while with fracture=20

from indirect violence, from compression of the chest, the splintering of t=
he ribs occurs externally.=20

Fracture of the upper ribs requires more force than that required to fractu=
re the lower ones, and=20

consequently the former is the more dangerous. The diagnosis of fracture of=
 the ribs is generally=20

quite easy by means of crepitus felt or heard, false motion, local tenderne=
ss, etc. FRACTURE OF=20

THE STERNUM may be serious if depressed on account of the wounding of the v=
iscera behind it.=20

Devergie[668] cites such a case where the depressed portion of the sternum =
produced a=20

transverse non-penetrating wound of the heart about an inch in length, whic=
h had caused death in=20

thirteen days. Simple fracture of the sternum without displacement of the f=
ragments is rarely=20

serious unless injury of the thoracic viscera is produced by the same viole=
nce. Wounds or injuries=20

of the thorax are grave or not according as they penetrate or injure the th=
oracic viscera or do not=20

do so. A wound may just penetrate the thoracic wall without wounding the th=
oracic viscera, and is=20

then serious as a rule only when followed by inflammation. In fact, many of=
 the penetrating=20

wounds of the thorax wounding the viscera are only grave on account of cons=
ecutive=20

inflammation. We have already seen that various characteristics of wounds o=
f the thorax,=20

especially of stab-wounds, enable us to determine the kind of weapon used, =
its size, sharpness,=20

etc., and sometimes to identify the weapon itself. In much the same way we =
can often determine=20

whether the wound was suicidally or homicidally inflicted. The cause of dea=
th in wounds of the=20

thorax may be directly due to the wounding of one or more of the thoracic v=
iscera, or it may be due=20

to the inflammation occasioned by it. Wounds of the lower part of the thora=
x may involve at the=20

same time the thoracic cavity proper and its contained viscera, the diaphra=
gm and the abdomen=20

and its viscera. This is the order in which the different parts would be me=
t with in a wound from=20

behind forward; the order might be the reverse of this in a wound from befo=
re backward.=20

Penetrating wounds of the thorax may involve the lungs, heart, or great blo=
od-vessels. Of these,=20

the lungs are most often injured, which is easily accounted for by the grea=
ter size of the lungs. In=20

=3Dwounds of the lungs=3D the immediate danger is from hemorrhage. The hemo=
rrhage appears=20

externally through the wound and from the mouth, being coughed up. Where th=
e lungs are injured=20

by a blow, fall, or crush without external injury, blood appears in the mou=
th only. The blood=20

coughed up from the lungs is bright red and frothy, and it may also be frot=
hy at the external=20

wound. Hemorrhage from the external wound may be slight, especially if the =
wound is oblique and=20

acts as a valve. In wounds of the lungs most of the blood may collect in th=
e pleura or in the lungs,=20

and thus, by compression from without or by displacement by the blood withi=
n it, prevents air from=20

entering the lungs and produces asphyxia, which may be fatal. More or less =
dyspn=C5=93a usually=20

occurs at first. Emphysema is generally present in the cellular tissues, bu=
t this latter symptom may=20

also occur at times with non-penetrating wounds of the chest. If death does=
 not occur speedily=20

from hemorrhage by compression of the lungs or heart, there are good hopes =
of saving the=20

patient, but the prognosis should be reserved. For even when the first effe=
cts of the wound of the=20

lung are survived, the patient may die from the effects of inflammation, re=
curring hemorrhage, or a=20



too sudden relaxation of regimen. Thus, for instance, if too much food, tal=
king, or exertion are=20

indulged in the case may on this account terminate fatally, and such aggrav=
ating causes of death=20

may mitigate the sentence.  =3DWounds of the heart=3D are among the most fa=
tal. Although it was=20

once considered, and is usually thought now by laymen, that wounds of the h=
eart must be=20

necessarily and instantly fatal, the facts are otherwise. If the wound is s=
mall and oblique life may=20

be prolonged, and cases are recorded[669] in which wounds of the heart were=
 not directly fatal,=20

and in some of which recovery would have probably resulted if not for other=
 diseases. Cases in=20

which the heart wall was wounded but not penetrated, and in which healing t=
ook place, are not=20

very rare.[670] Thus Callender removed a needle from the substance of the h=
eart. But there is=20

perhaps only one case[671] on record in which a wound penetrating the cavit=
ies of the heart was=20

recovered from. It is the rule rather than the exception that wounds of the=
 heart, penetrating or not,=20

are not immediately fatal. Thus in a series of twenty-nine cases of penetra=
ting wounds mentioned=20

by Devergie,[672] as collected by Ollivier and Sanson, only two ended fatal=
ly within forty-eight=20

hours, the rest in periods ranging from four to twenty-eight days. This del=
ay in the fatal result has=20

been attributed to the arrangement of the muscle fibres crossing one anothe=
r and tending to close=20

the wound, or at least to make it smaller. As to the various parts of the h=
eart wounded, the right=20

side, especially the ventricle, is most often wounded. Thus out of fifty-fo=
ur cases of wounds of the=20

heart, Taylor[673] states that the right ventricle was wounded in twenty-ni=
ne cases, both ventricles=20

in nine, the right auricle in three, and the left auricle in one case. This=
 greater frequency of wounds=20

of the right side of the heart is easily accounted for by its more exposed =
position anteriorly, just=20

beneath the chest wall in a part of its extent. The rapidity of death depen=
ds largely upon the site=20

and extent of the wound. Lutaud[674] states that out of twenty-four cases o=
f wounds of the right=20

ventricle only two were fatal within forty-eight hours, and out of twelve c=
ases of wounds of the left=20

ventricle three were not immediately fatal. Wounds of the auricles are gene=
rally fatal immediately,=20

especially if the cavity is extensively laid open. It is the general opinio=
n that wounds of the auricles=20

are most rapidly fatal, next those of the right ventricle, and lastly those=
 of the left ventricle. This=20

difference is probably due to the comparative thickness of the walls of the=
se parts. Thus the wall of=20

the left ventricle is so thick as to tend to close a wound unless it be ext=
ensive. In wounds of the=20

heart death rarely occurs from external hemorrhage, which may be quite slig=
ht or even altogether=20

wanting where the wound is due to a crush or fracture of the ribs. Death is=
 usually due to the=20

compression of the heart by the blood in the pericardium. This usually caus=
es syncope, or a=20

slighter pressure may be fatal by causing cerebral or pulmonary an=C3=A6mia=
 or shock. Death may=20

occur suddenly in this manner or not until after some time. Thus in penetra=
ting stab-wounds little=20

or no blood probably escapes at first, in most cases, but it may ooze or, l=
ater on, suddenly burst=20

out into the pericardium. Therefore after a wound of the heart the patient =
does not, as a rule, die=20

immediately, as formerly and often at the present time erroneously supposed=
. This fact is of little=20

importance as a rule in surgery, for the patients generally die sooner or l=
ater, but it is of=20

importance in medical jurisprudence, for upon it may hang the solution of q=
uestions of murder,=20

suicide, or justifiable homicide. It also accounts for the fact that the in=
jured person can exercise=20

voluntary power after the injury. Thus Watson[675] met with a case where a =
man ran eighteen=20

yards and died six hours after a stab-wound of the right ventricle. The cor=
onary artery was divided=20

and the pericardium was filled with blood. Also Boileau met with an acciden=
tal penetrating stab-



wound through both ventricles in a soldier who ran two hundred yards, then =
fell and died in five=20

minutes. A boy admitted to Guy=E2=80=99s Hospital in 1879 lived forty-two h=
ours with a bayonet-wound=20

transfixing the right auricle, the septum, the left ventricle, the mitral v=
alve, and entering the left=20

auricle.  Minute wounds of the chest are sometimes made by needles, etc., i=
n the region of the=20

heart with the intention of killing infants or children. Taylor[676] also m=
entions the case of a fatal=20

wound of the heart from a needle, the result of accident. We have already c=
ited the case of a=20

needle lodged in the heart wall and removed by Callender by operation. That=
 the puncture of the=20

heart by a small instrument is not necessarily serious is proved by the exp=
eriments of Senn,[677]=20

by which he found that =E2=80=9Cthe heart can be punctured with a perfectly=
 aseptic, medium-sized=20

aspirator needle without any great immediate or remote danger.=E2=80=9D  In=
 cases of RUPTURE OF THE=20

HEART the question may come up as to whether it was the result of disease o=
r violence. We have=20

already seen that rupture of the heart may occur from falls or crushes with=
out marks of violence to=20

the chest. In general, we may say that in rupture of the heart from violenc=
e the right side and base=20

are most often involved, while in rupture from disease the left ventricle i=
s generally ruptured,=20

especially near the apex. The exciting causes of rupture of a diseased hear=
t are often violent=20

emotions or exertion, which may both be present in a quarrel with another a=
nd cause rupture=20

without direct violence. The cause need be but slight if the heart is disea=
sed, whether the cause is=20

a natural one or outward violence. Rupture from disease may therefore excit=
e suspicions of=20

murder, but those cases can usually be satisfactorily solved by examination=
 of the organ post=20

mortem. A slight degree of violence may cause rupture of a diseased heart a=
bout ready for rupture=20

from natural causes. When a diseased heart ruptures during a quarrel, the s=
ymptoms of rupture of=20

the heart may be observed to come on suddenly before and without the inflic=
tion of any violence.=20

=3DWounds of Arteries and Veins=3D, especially within the thorax.=E2=80=94W=
ounds of large trunks are=20

generally speedily mortal. In the chest we may occasionally meet with wound=
s of the intercostal or=20

internal mammary vessels or the vena azygos veins. These wounds are often s=
erious and may be=20

fatal. We have already seen that blood in the large cavities of the body, l=
ike the chest, is=20

commonly not coagulated, or at least the greater part of it. We have alread=
y seen, too, that after=20

wounds of the carotid artery the victim may preserve the power of locomotio=
n for a short time, but=20

not the power of struggling. This fact may be important to help distinguish=
 between murder and=20

suicide. In such wounds of the carotid the voice may be lost, as the trache=
a is often divided. Death=20

from wounds of large vessels may be due to loss of blood, and if this dange=
r is passed the case=20

may still terminate fatally, as in a case where the brachial was tied for i=
njury and death occurred in=20

three days from gangrene. The wounds of comparatively small vessels may pro=
ve fatal from=20

hemorrhage, etc.  In wounds of blood-vessels death may occur from the _entr=
ance of air_ into=20

them. In some cases where this is supposed to have occurred it is quite pro=
bable that death was=20

really due to hemorrhage. A considerable quantity of air may enter the circ=
ulation, especially the=20

arterial circulation, without a fatal result. When death does occur it is o=
wing (1) to =E2=80=9Cmechanical=20

over-distention of the right ventricle of the heart and paralysis in the di=
astole,=E2=80=9D or (2) to =E2=80=9Casphyxia=20

from obstruction to the pulmonary circulation consequent upon embolism of t=
he pulmonary=20

artery.=E2=80=9D[678] Senn found that fatal air embolism could hardly occur=
 spontaneously in a healthy=20

jugular vein, as the walls collapse readily from atmospheric pressure.  =3D=
Wounds and Ruptures of=20

the Diaphragm.=3D=E2=80=94These may be due to weapons, fracture of the ribs=
, falls or crushes, and=20



disease. They also occur as the result of congenital malformation, though t=
hese cases seldom=20

survive long. These injuries are generally homicidal or accidental in origi=
n. As a rule, the viscera=20

are wounded at the same time, or, if not wounded, at least herniated, and m=
ay thus become=20

strangulated. It is therefore hard to estimate the danger in such cases, bu=
t the prognosis is at all=20

times serious. The most serious cases of such injury to the diaphragm are d=
ue to violent=20

contusions or falls when the stomach and intestines are full. The hemorrhag=
e is usually slight, but=20

hernia of one or more of the abdominal viscera usually occurs in such cases=
, and is said to be=20

more readily produced during inspiration when the fibres are on the stretch=
. According to=20

Devergie, rupture of the diaphragm with hernia is more common on the left s=
ide in the central=20

tendon in front of the crura and at the junction of the left muscular leafl=
et. Also on either side of the=20

ensiform cartilage and especially on the left side there occurs an area of =
the diaphragm which may=20

be congenitally weak or even absent, and here too rupture and hernia are li=
kely to occur.=20

_Phrenic_ or _diaphragmatic hernia_ occurs especially after lacerated wound=
s, even after the=20

wounds have apparently healed. If hernia occurs long after the injury was i=
nflicted, it may be asked=20

whether the wound was the cause of the hernia, and so of death. This can on=
ly be determined by=20

examination. Almost any or all of the movable abdominal viscera may be foun=
d in a diaphragmatic=20

hernia. It was once supposed that this accident would be immediately fatal,=
 but this is far from the=20

truth. Devergie relates the case where a person lived nine months with the =
stomach and colon in=20

the chest and died from another cause. Thus a person may have a phrenic her=
nia and die from=20

another cause, or having had a rupture or wound of the diaphragm he may sud=
denly acquire a=20

diaphragmatic hernia by reason of a blow or sudden exertion, or the latter =
may strangulate an=20

existing hernia. A person with a diaphragmatic hernia may have the power of=
 moving or walking,=20

but is more or less incapacitated owing to the compression of the lungs whi=
ch exists and the=20

consequent dyspn=C5=93a, etc.   WOUNDS AND CONTUSED INJURIES OF THE ABDOMIN=
AL WALL=20

AND VISCERA.  Such wounds and injuries of the abdominal wall may be incised=
, punctured, or=20

due to blunt instruments, etc. They are usually homicidal or accidental, se=
ldom suicidal except in=20

delirious patients or lunatics. The cause of death in such cases may be due=
 to hemorrhage, shock,=20

etc., or to secondary inflammation, which is especially likely to occur in =
penetrating wounds. The=20

kind of weapon used may often be judged from the nature of the wound. Incis=
ed and non-

penetrating punctured wounds are usually simple and not grave, but may be o=
therwise from=20

hemorrhage from the deep epigastric artery, or from inflammation in or betw=
een the muscles, or in=20

the subperitoneal connective tissue. In the latter case peritonitis may occ=
ur, but is rare. A ventral=20

hernia may, however, result later on, as also from a cicatrix, especially i=
f it is transverse. In such=20

cases the question arises whether the natural results of the wound were agg=
ravated by unskilful or=20

improper treatment or even wilful neglect on the part of the patient or pra=
ctitioner.  CONTUSIONS=20

of the abdomen are more serious often than those of the chest, for there is=
 less power of=20

resistance. We have already seen that death may occur from a contusion of t=
he abdomen too=20

slight to show a mark of ecchymosis or a serious injury internally. This ha=
s been attributed by=20

some to an effect on the solar plexus or reflexly on the cardiac plexus cau=
sing a fatal inhibition.=20

Lutaud and others have expressed the doubt whether the cases reported by Tr=
avers, Allison,=20

Watson, Cooper, Vibert, and others were carefully examined, and have inferr=
ed that some visible=20

organic change must have been present. Some such cases, however, have been =
examined with=20



especial reference to this point, and no physical injuries and no other cau=
se of death elsewhere=20

has been found. There is no ground, therefore, for a jury to doubt that a c=
ontusion of the abdomen=20

was the cause of death because there are no visible marks of injury.  Again=
, it is a well-known fact=20

that the blows severe enough to cause rupture of the abdominal viscera may =
sometimes leave no=20

trace of violence in or on the abdominal wall. On the other hand, it must b=
e remembered that=20

effusions of blood may be found post mortem in the sheaths of muscles witho=
ut indicating=20

violence, so that blood may be found effused in considerable quantity in an=
d around the abdominal=20

muscles without violence having been done. In such cases, therefore, we sho=
uld note whether=20

abrasions or ecchymoses of the skin are absent or not. If they are absent a=
nd there is no other=20

evidence of a blow, the medical witness should hesitate to attribute such a=
n effusion of blood=20

between the muscles to an act of violence.  As in the case of the chest, so=
 wounds of the=20

abdomen are serious, as a rule, mainly as they involve the abdominal viscer=
a. The viscera may be=20

wounded by a penetrating wound or by rupture, and the fatal result is due s=
ometimes to internal=20

hemorrhage or to shock, but generally to secondary septic peritonitis, whic=
h may be fatal in a few=20

hours or only after days or weeks. Occasionally wounds of the abdominal vis=
cera undergo=20

spontaneous cure without surgical interference and with or without medical =
treatment. But as a=20

rule they are fatal unless they receive proper surgical treatment. A wound =
of the abdominal wall=20

may be penetrating without wounding any of the viscera. Such wounds may be =
fatal if they are=20

infected, otherwise they usually heal readily and without danger unless the=
y are extensive and the=20

abdominal contents are exposed to the air. The gravity of penetrating wound=
s varies somewhat=20

with the particular viscus or viscera injured. It is well not to examine wo=
unds of the abdomen by=20

the finger or probe too freely unless a laparotomy is anticipated; for a si=
mple wound or penetrating=20

wound without wounding of the viscera may thus be infected. Enough examinat=
ion is necessary to=20

diagnose between a simple and a penetrating wound of the abdominal wall.   =
RUPTURE OR=20

WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA.  THE LIVER is most often wounded of any of=
 the=20

abdominal viscera, with the possible exception of the intestines, because o=
f its size, and it is most=20

often ruptured partly because of its size, but mostly owing to its friable =
consistence. Such injuries=20

most often involve the right lobe, as it is much the larger of the two prin=
cipal lobes. The anterior=20

surface and inferior border is the most frequent site both of wounds and ru=
ptures of the organ.=20

Ruptures rarely pass entirely through the organ, but are generally not more=
 than an inch or two in=20

depth. They are usually directed antero-posteriorly or obliquely, rarely tr=
ansversely, and the=20

lacerated granular edges are not much separated as a rule (see Fig. 21). Ru=
pture of the liver may=20

be due to a blow, crush, or fall, or even to sudden muscular action if the =
organ is large and fatty.=20

Thus Taylor[679] relates the case of a woman who died after child-birth of =
ur=C3=A6mic convulsions,=20

and in whom there was quite an extensive hemorrhage into the liver beneath =
its capsule, and=20

apparently due to violent muscular contraction. As we have already seen, th=
e liver may be=20

ruptured without the abdomen showing the marks of external violence. Ruptur=
e or wound of the=20

liver is one of the causes of the fatality of wounds and injuries of the ab=
domen. The fatal result=20

may be and often is due to hemorrhage; in other cases it is due to shock or=
 the occurrence of=20

peritonitis. Wounds of the liver heal readily and hemorrhage is arrested at=
 once, as a rule, by the=20

approximation of the edges. There may be little blood in and about the woun=
d, but it collects in the=20

right iliac region or in the pelvis and is not wholly coagulated. Unless th=
e wound or rupture involves=20



the vena cava, portal vein, or a large branch of either of these, the hemor=
rhage is apt to be slow=20

and the victim may survive hours or even days, except for active exertion o=
r repeated violence.=20

case the liver was ruptured nearly through its thickness, and a basinful of=
 blood had been effused,=20

causing death. In the other case,[681] which occurred to Wilks, the patient=
 survived the accident=20

ten days, and Taylor[682] cites a case which was reported to have ended fat=
ally eight years after=20

the accident. As a rule the injury is fatal, without treatment, within fort=
y-eight hours. Not being=20

immediately fatal as a rule, the victim of a rupture or wound of the liver =
can walk about, and may=20

be capable of more or less severe muscular exertion after the injury, thoug=
h the fact of such=20

exertion has sometimes been used by the defence to prove that the rupture w=
as not due to the=20

particular violence in question.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.=E2=80=94Ruptures =
of the Liver from a Fall from a=20

 gall-bladder_=20

result in the effusion of bile. While rupture of the liver is not necessari=
ly followed by peritonitis,=20

rupture of the gall-bladder with the effusion of bile generally causes peri=
tonitis, and is fatal in this=20

way and not from hemorrhage. Rupture of the gall-bladder may be favored by =
the presence of gall-

stones, but the result is still attributable to the injury.  SPLEEN.=E2=80=

contusion, though this fact is still employed by the defence to try to disp=
rove the connection=20

between the injury and the result. It is important to remember, from a medi=
co-legal point of view,=20

that an enlarged and softened spleen may be ruptured from a comparatively s=
light muscular=20

exertion. This might occur in a sudden movement to avoid a blow, and the ch=
arge of manslaughter=20

might be affected by the mode of the production of the injury and the previ=

Only direct violence is liable to rupture the healthy normal spleen. Ruptur=
e and wounds of the=20

spleen may be and generally are fatal from hemorrhage, owing to the vascula=
rity of the organ;=20

more rarely are they fatal from shock. Peritonitis is not a result to be ex=

jury may cause no=20

prominent symptoms, but usually lumbar pain and tenderness, frequent mictur=
ition and hematuria,=20

and in severe cases the symptoms of hemorrhage and shock are present. The i=
njury may be=20

speedily fatal from hemorrhage or collapse, or more slowly fatal from perit=
onitis, when the=20

peritoneum is involved, or from abscess and septic infection, or from ur=C3=
=A6mia if the other kidney is=20

diseased. Slight injuries are generally recovered from. As is the case with=
 the liver and spleen, so=20

after injuries of the kidney the victim may walk about, etc., unless there =
is copious and immediate=20

hemorrhage.  THE BLADDER may be wounded directly through the hypogastrium, =
vagina, or=20

rectum; it may be punctured by a broken fragment of the pelvis, especially =
the pubis, or it may=20

frequently be ruptured from blows, crushes, or falls. The latter accident o=
ccurs especially where=20

the bladder is distended. The bladder may also rupture spontaneously from o=
ver-distention, which=20

may or may not be favored by disease of the bladder wall, in which case rup=
ture occurs more=20

easily. Medico-legally the question may arise whether the rupture was spont=
aneous or due to=20

injury. In this connection it should be remembered that the injury may leav=
e no external mark of=20

violence, and a case is recorded in which the bladder was ruptured by a fal=
l in wrestling; but the=20

question can be determined only by an examination of the bladder. If the wa=
ll of the bladder is=20

thinned by the pressure of a calculus or from other causes, or if it is wea=
kened by tubercular,=20

syphilitic, or carcinomatous deposits or ulcerations, it may be spontaneous=
ly ruptured from slight=20

distention or a slight degree of violence may rupture it. If violence has b=
een employed it is=20

responsible for the rupture, though the diseased condition may act as a mit=
igating circumstance;=20

not so a distended bladder, as the latter is not abnormal. In spontaneous r=
upture from over-

distention without disease of the bladder wall, stricture, hypertrophied pr=
ostate, or some such=20

condition must be present to account for the over-distention. Spontaneous r=
upture of the bladder=20

can, therefore, only occur when either disease of the bladder wall or obstr=
uction of the urethra is=20

present. No condition excludes rupture from violence. If there is an injury=
 followed by the=20

symptoms of rupture of the bladder and death and the bladder and urethra ar=
e healthy, there can=20

be little doubt that death was due to the injury. Wounds or rupture of the =
bladder may be extra-

peritoneal or intra-peritoneal. Rupture from disease of the bladder wall oc=
curs at the site of the=20

diseased and weakened spot, which is most often at the base of the bladder.=
 Rupture of the=20

bladder from violence occurs most often on the postero-superior wall, runni=
ng downward from the=20

urachus, in which case the peritoneum would be involved. A punctured wound =
of the bladder wall=20

may be so minute that the leakage is very slow and the customary symptoms m=
ay be obscured, or=20

the opening may be valvular in character, perhaps allowing escape of urine =
only when the bladder=20

is not distended. The _symptoms_ consist of pain, inability to micturate, a=
nd the presence of blood=20

in the little fluid which can be drawn by a catheter. Fluid injected is not=
 all returned and the bladder=20



cannot be distended. After a time varying from a few hours to a few days, d=
epending upon the size=20

of the opening and the condition of the urine, peritonitis or peri-vesical =
cellulitis is set up, the=20

former being generally fatal, the latter not necessarily so. Prompt surgica=
l treatment may save the=20

patient=E2=80=99s life by avoiding peritonitis. Extra-peritoneal ruptures a=
re far less dangerous than intra-

peritoneal, as in the former case cellulitis and abscess in the cellular ti=
ssue around the bladder,=20

which may subsequently be treated by operation and drainage, take the place=
 of peritonitis in the=20

latter case, for which prevention is the only safe treatment. In extra-peri=
toneal rupture death, if it=20

occurs, is generally due to septic=C3=A6mia; in the intra-peritoneal variet=
y it is due to peritonitis. These=20

cases of injury to the bladder may die suddenly and speedily from shock or =
from peritonitis in three=20

to seven days, or not until fifteen days or so. In punctured and incised wo=
unds the urine escapes=20

more slowly, peritonitis develops less early, and death is longer delayed. =
Hemorrhage in injury to=20

CHAPTER I                            WHISTLING MYSTERY   Ensign Jack Steel =
sat on the edge of a life=20

raft whittling a stick. A strange place to whittle, one might say, on the d=
eck of a great U. S. aircraft=20

carrier in mid-Pacific. But Jack loved to whittle.  "What do you make when =
you whittle?" someone=20

once asked him. "Shavings--just shavings--that's all," had been his prompt =
reply. Then, feeling that=20

this was not a real answer, he went on to say, "I whittle and think. Thinki=
ng is what really counts."=20

Jack was thinking now, not thinking hard--just letting thoughts drift in an=
d out of his mind. There=20

was enough to think about, too; they were in Jap waters right now. Somethin=
g was bound to=20

happen soon, perhaps at dawn. Jack would be away before dawn, for his was a=
 scout plane. Back=20

at the faraway training base at Kingsville he had put in his bid for a dive=
 bomber.  "Ah! A dive=20

bomber!" he had said to Stew, his buddy. "There's the plane for me! You cli=
mb to twelve thousand=20

feet, you get near the target, you come zooming down at four hundred an hou=
r, you let go your=20

bomb, and--"  "Wham!" Stew had exclaimed.  "Yes," Jack had agreed. "Then yo=
u get out of there=20

fast, as if Old Nick himself was after you."  In the Navy you don't talk ba=
ck; so when the powers=20

that be read off Jack, or "Jackknife Johnny," peritonitis is also found. Th=
e victim of a wound or=20

rupture of the bladder may often walk about for some time after the injury.=
  STOMACH AND=20

INTESTINES.=E2=80=94Punctured wounds, or, more rarely, incised wounds of th=
e abdomen may involve=20

these organs, or they may be ruptured by blows, crushes, and falls, or from=
 disease. Stab-wounds=20

of these viscera may be multiple from a single stab, the instrument travers=
ing one coil, perhaps,=20

and then wounding others, though this is less often the case than with guns=
hot wounds. Ruptures=20

too may be multiple, though less often so than wounds. The ileum is most li=
able to rupture, though=20

several cases of rupture of the jejunum are on record. Like the bladder, th=
e stomach and, to a less=20

extent, the intestines are more liable to be ruptured when distended. Ruptu=
res of the stomach or=20

intestines are seldom attended with much hemorrhage, while wounds may occas=
ionally cause a=20

serious and fatal hemorrhage from the wounding of a large blood-vessel. The=
 principal danger lies=20



in the leakage of the contents of the stomach and intestines, which almost =
always sets up a septic=20

peritonitis. This may sometimes become localized and go on to spontaneous c=
ure, though as a=20

rule it becomes general and is fatal. In such cases early operation may avo=
id the fatal peritonitis. A=20

punctured wound may be so small as to be closed by the mucous membrane, avo=
iding the escape=20

of the contents of the gut. Or a wound may not entirely penetrate the wall =
of the stomach or=20

intestines, which only gives way some days, perhaps, after the injury, thou=
gh the injury is entirely=20

responsible for the delayed result. These injuries are sometimes fatal imme=
diately or very speedily=20

from shock, while in other cases of very extensive injury there may be almo=
st no shock, and the=20

victim is aware of no serious injury. It is an important point to remember =
medico-legally that=20

spontaneous rupture of the stomach or intestines may occur owing to ulcerat=
ion due to disease.=20

This can be determined by a careful examination of the wall of the stomach =
or intestines at the site=20

of the rupture. A slight injury may also cause rupture if the wall of the g=
ut is weakened by disease,=20

as the disease causes greater liability to rupture. Here too it is to be re=
membered that a severe=20

injury causing rupture may leave no mark of violence on the abdominal wall.=
 The power of walking=20

or other muscular exertion after such injuries of the stomach or intestines=
 is not infrequently=20

preserved, as recorded in numerous cases.[683] The prognosis in such injuri=
es of the stomach=20

and intestines is always extremely grave.   INCISED, PUNCTURED, AND CONTUSE=
D WOUNDS=20

OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.  These are not common as medico-legal cases. Self-ca=
stration or=20

mutilation is sometimes practised by lunatics, idiots, or even intoxicated =
persons. Thus a man=20

who, while intoxicated, cut off his genital organs and died the next day fr=
om the effects of=20

hemorrhage was seen by Demarquay.[684] Circumcision in infants is also some=
times fatal from=20

phlegmonous inflammation.[685]  Incised, lacerated, or contused wounds of t=
he female genitals=20

may be fatal from hemorrhage from many small vessels. Deeply incised wounds=
 of the female=20

genitals proves wilful and deliberate malice; accident is out of the questi=
on and suicide is=20

improbable in such cases. But we sometimes have to determine between accide=
ntal, self-inflicted,=20

and homicidal wounds of these parts, as accidental wounds may occasionally =
resemble those=20

made by design and so may furnish more or less difficulty, unless all the c=
ircumstances are=20

known. Thus Taylor[686] relates the case of a child in whom a sharp-pointed=
 stick entered and=20

passed through the posterior wall of the vagina as she fell from a tree. Th=
e stick was removed by a=20

woman, and the child died in a little over a day from peritonitis. Unless t=
he circumstances were=20

known, this case might have caused suspicion of homicide.  Lunatics, idiots=
, and drunkards=20

sometimes inflict on themselves wounds unlike ordinary suicidal ones. In ot=
her cases the various=20

points we have enumerated in a previous section to distinguish between suic=
ide, homicide, and=20

accident may be applied to solve the case.  Contused wounds, such as kicks,=
 etc., of the female=20

genitals may be fatal from hemorrhage due to the laceration of the parts.[6=
87] Like the wounds of=20

the eyebrows, contused wounds of the vulva may sometimes resemble incised w=
ounds owing to=20

the sharp bony surfaces beneath. Careful examination allows a discriminatio=
n to be made from=20

incised wounds. If hemorrhage occurs a long time after the alleged violence=
, it is probably due to=20

natural causes, especially in cases of metrorrhagia, etc. It may be alleged=
 in defence that=20

contused wounds of the female genitals were inflicted post mortem, but besi=
des the other features=20

which we have already seen help to distinguish between ante-mortem and post=
-mortem wounds,=20

we may add that kicks and other contusions of the vulva, if fatal, are so f=
rom hemorrhage or=20



effusion of blood, and no post-mortem hemorrhage is enough to cause death. =
  INCISED,=20

PUNCTURED, AND CONTUSED WOUNDS OF THE EXTREMITIES.  These may be fatal if a=
=20

large blood vessel or vessels are opened, or sometimes if a compound fractu=
re or wound of a joint=20

becomes infected. They may also in some cases be fatal from shock, from the=
 severity of the=20

injury. As a rule they are the cause of civil suits, not of criminal ones. =
The various injuries may=20

cause disability for a longer or shorter time, or even permanently, and mor=
e or less deformity may=20

also remain. This may be the case with fractures, especially if they occur =
near the joints, in which=20

case great caution should be exercised in giving an opinion or prognosis. I=
t is a common mistaken=20

idea of the laity that a fractured or dislocated limb can be made in every =
case as good as before=20

the injury. On the contrary, they not infrequently leave a slight deformity=
 and impairment of=20

function, sometimes even under the best treatment. Dislocations may also le=
ave a lasting disability=20

or weakness, often owing to the carelessness of the injured person.  Wounds=
 of an artery or vein,=20

or both, may result in an aneurism or an arterio-venous aneurism. Wounds of=
 nerves may cause=20

paralysis and an=C3=A6sthesia of the parts supplied. Wounds of muscles or t=
endons may cause=20

weakness or complete loss of motion of particular joints. Wounds of the sof=
t parts, if infected, may=20

lead to cellulitis and phlegmonous inflammation, which may result in much i=
njury. Wounds of=20

joints, if penetrating, are serious, for without the proper treatment they =
may result in suppuration in=20

the joint, disorganization of the joint, and final ankylosis. Before the us=
e of antiseptic treatment=20

such wounds were not uncommonly fatal. Fractures, simple or compound, or co=
ntusions of bone=20

especially in young subjects, may be followed by osteo-periostitis and its =
consequences, which=20

may require a long time for recovery after the fracture is entirely recover=
ed from, and a still longer=20

time before the limb can be used. These and many other of the various resul=
ts of wounds and=20

injuries of the extremities, causing deformity or disability, or both, can =
often be cured or improved=20

by surgical treatment or operation.       THE MEDICO-LEGAL CONSIDERATION   =

GUNSHOT WOUNDS.   GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.  FEW medical men there are who ha=
ve=20

long engaged in practice who have not been compelled to take part in some m=
edico-legal=20

controversy in cases of accidental or=20


_
ship, a scout ship it had been--and still was.  And now, Jack thought, I wo=
uldn't trade my little old=20

scout plane for any ship that flies. To go skimming away before dawn, to wa=
tch the "dawn come=20

up like thunder" in those tropical waters, then to skip from cloud to cloud=
, eyes ever on the sea,=20

looking for the enemy--ah, that was the life!  "Nothing like it!" he whispe=
red as he carved off a long=20

shaving and allowed it to drop silently on the deck.  A moving shadow loome=
d up before him. He=20

knew that shadow--"Old Ironsides," as the boys called him--Lieutenant Comma=
nder Donald Stone,=20

boss of the carrier _Black Bee_, Jack's ship, was on his way to the bridge.=
  "Must get a swell view=20

of our task force from up there, eh, Commander?" Jack spoke before he death=
 occurs the surgeon=20

ceases to work as such, but may continue to work as a medical jurist, and i=
n preparation for this=20

event must be ready to answer any questions bearing upon the case which, th=
ough possibly=20

ridiculous in surgery, are or may be necessary in law. He may be called upo=
n to testify as to the=20

precise nature of a wound inflicted upon the body of a man seen before or a=
fter death; as to the=20

means by which it was inflicted; whether the purport was suicidal or homici=
dal; how much blood=20

was lost; whether the weapon was near to or at a distance from the body whe=
n fired; whether it=20

were possible that the deceased could have fired it himself; whether after =
the reception of the=20

wound the person could have moved or performed any act=E2=80=94in other=20


_
"Eh? What? Oh, it's you, Jackknife Johnny." The Commander gave a low laugh.=
 "Well now, on a=20

night like this you don't see much--a bit of white foam after each ship, an=
d a blink of light now and=20

then--that's all."  "It's enough, sir," said Jack. "You know what's genuine=
 or spurious blood-stains,=20

whether genuine blood-stains were human or from some other animal; whether =
possibly they were=20

from the body of the deceased. He will be expected to tell from what direct=
ion the bullet or missile=20

was fired; which the wound of entrance and which=20


_
destroyers, and maybe a tanker. Your mind must fill in the picture."  "Oh! =
It does! It really does!"=20

the Commander agreed. "Want to come up and see for yourself?" he invited.  =
"That would be=20

keen, sir!" said Jack, dropping to his feet.  "Come on up then," the Comman=
der urged.  As Jack=20

mounted the steps to the Commander's bridge, twenty-five feet above the fli=
ght deck, he thought=20

how strange life aboard a carrier would seem to those of exit, and many oth=
er things possible=20

concerning the circumstances under which death occurred. It is unnecessary =
to state that=20

questions of this nature call not only for conventional surgical skill, but=
 for the highest degree of=20

shrewdness and general information, as well as sometimes for expert knowled=
ge with regard to=20

small-arms and their ballistics.  It has been well said that the first duty=
 of a medical jurist is to=20

cultivate=20


_
was strictly adhered to. When a flight of planes came in from a practice fl=
ight, they came down in=20

perfect formation like a flock of wild geese landing on a pond.  Strict dis=
cipline, yes, he told=20

himself, yet here I am following our Commander to his bridge, and it doesn'=
t seem a bit strange;=20

for he's one of us. We're all one, all dressed in knowledge of what the law=
 requires and with the=20

results of a technical education, he will be able to meet all or nearly all=
 of the scientific questions=20

which may be asked of him. A learned judge once said that =E2=80=9Ca medica=
l man when he sees a dead=20

body should notice everything.=E2=80=9D Certainly he should make a minute s=
crutiny of the body to note=20


_
last degree, ready to act as a unit to beat the Japs.  "Life on a carrier s=
urely is grand, sir!" he said=20

aloud.  "Yes, son," the hardy old Commander rumbled. "There's never been an=
ything like it=20

before."  "Never has, sir," Jack agreed.  "And now," said the Commander as =
they reached the=20

bridge, "there's your Navy task force on a moonless night. Have a there are=
 upon the dress or=20

hands of the deceased marks of blood, or whether blood-stains are noted in =
different parts of the=20

room; whether the body or any part of it is cold or warm; whether the limbs=
 are cold or rigid or=20

pliant, since by these means the accurate date of death may be more accurat=
ely determined.=20
