the aid of a sane temper and an energetic will. As a writer, Moliere is not=
 free from faults; but his=20

defects of style are like the accidents that happen within the bounds of a =
wide empire. His stature=20

is not diminished when he is placed among the greatest European figures. "I=
 read some pieces of=20

Moliere's every year," said Goethe, "just as from time to time I contemplat=
e the engravings after=20

the great Italian masters. For we little men are not able to retain the gre=
atness of such things=20

within ourselves."  To study the contemporaries and immediate successors of=
 Moliere in comedy--

Thomas Corneille, Quinault, Montfleury, Boursault, Baron--would be to show =
how his genius=20

dominates that of all his fellows. The reader may well take this fact for g=
ranted.[1]  [Footnote 1: An=20

excellent guide will be found in Victor Fournel's _Le Theatre au xvii. Siec=

ble Charudatta commit a=20

crime?      Of all the riches of the mighty sea       Only the swelling wat=
ers now are left,     Because,=20

without consideration, he--       For others' good--himself of all has reft=

 or in a bullock-cart?=20

_Charudatta._ I did not see her when she went. were favourable to ideals of=
 grace and beauty=20

rather than of proud sublimity; to isolate one's self was impossible; liter=
ature became the pastime=20

of a cultivated society; it might be a trivial pastime, but in fitting hand=
s it might become a noble=20

pleasure.  The easier part was chosen by PHILIPPE QUINAULT, the more arduou=
s by Racine.=20

Quinault (1635-88) had given his first comedy as early as 1653; in tragedie=
s and tragi-comedies=20

which followed, he heaped up melodramatic incidents, but could not base the=
m upon characters=20

strongly conceived, or passion truly felt. A frigid sentimentality replaces=
 passion, and this is=20

expressed with languorous monotony. Love reigns supreme in his theatre; but=
 love, as interpreted=20

by Quinault, is a kind of dulcet gallantry. His tragedy _Astrate_ (1663) wa=
s not the less popular=20

because its sentiment was in the conventional mode. One comedy by Quinault,=
 _La Mere=20

Coquette_, is happy in its plot and in its easy style. But he did not find =
his true direction until he=20

declined--or should we rather say, until he rose?--into the librettist for =
the operas of Lulli. His lyric=20

gifts were considerable; he could manipulate his light and fragile material=
 with extraordinary skill.=20

The tests of truth and reality were not applied to such verse; if it was de=
corative, the listeners were=20

satisfied. The opera flourished, and literature suffered through its pseudo=
-poetics. But the libretti of=20

Quinault and the ballets of Benserade are representative of the time, and i=
n his mythological or=20

chivalric inventions Benserade sometimes could attain to the poetry of grac=
eful fantasy.  Quinault=20

retired from the regular drama almost at the moment when Racine appeared. B=
orn at La Ferte-

Milon in 1639, son of a procureur and comptroller of salt, JEAN RACINE lost=
 both parents while a=20

child. His widowed grandmother retired to Port-Royal in 1649. After six yea=

dishonoring, insulting=20

kick,     And so I brooded, till at last the Euripides--these were the powe=
rs that fostered his genius.=20

Already he was experimenting in verse. At nineteen he continued his studies=
 in Paris, where the=20

oduced him to=20

mundane pleasures.=20

Unwilling yielded to the dawning light.                      23  So now I w=

enters._] May happiness be the lot of these honorable gentlemen.  _Judge._ =
Ah, it is Viraka, the=20

captain of the guard. Viraka, what is the purpose of your coming?  _Viraka.=
_ Well! I was looking=20

for Aryaka, in all the excitement about his escape from prison. I had my su=
spicions about a=20

covered bullock-cart that was coming, and wanted to look in. "You 've made =
one inspection, man, I=20

must make another," said I, and then I was kicked by the highly respectable=
 Chandanaka. You=20

have heard the matter, gentlemen. The rest is your affair.  _Judge._ My goo=
d man, do you know to=20

whom the bullock-cart belonged?  _Viraka._ To this gentleman Racine's sensi=
tive, mobile=20

character could easily adapt itself to the world. His ode on the marriage o=
f the King, _La Nymphe=20

de la Seine_, corrected by Chapelain (for to bring Tritons into a river was=
 highly improper), won=20

him a gift of louis d'or. But might not the world corrupt the young Port-Ro=
yalist's innocence? The=20

company of ladies of the Marais Theatre and that of La Fontaine might not t=
end to edification. So=20

thought Racine's aunts; and, with the expectation that he would take orders=
, he was exiled to=20

Uzes, where his uncle was vicar-general, and where the nephew could study t=
he _Summa_ of=20

theology, but also the Odyssey, the odes of Pindar, Petrarch, and the prett=
