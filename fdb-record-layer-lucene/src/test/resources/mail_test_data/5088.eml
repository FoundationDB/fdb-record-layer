y's on a Saturday=20

afternoon.  Both Carlo and Bianca gazed around them in amazement.  The peop=
le were all=20

comfortably, some of them almost handsomely dressed, even if with little ta=
ste, but this was usual=20

in Germany. They were drinking coffee and eating little oatmeal cakes and a=
ppeared contented=20

and serene, even without their famous "Deutsche kuchen."  "I sometimes wond=
er, Carlo," Bianca=20

whispered, when they were seated at a small table in a corner, "if some of =
these people are not=20

glad after all that the Kaiser has been defeated and that they are to have =
a new form of=20

government and more personal freedom? They certainly seem to be glad the fi=
ghting is over. I=20

suppose they had grown deadly tired of it and of being deceived by their le=
aders."  Carlo shook his=20

head warningly.  "Be careful, Bianca. In spite of what you think there are =
still thousands of people=20

in Coblenz faithful both to the Kaiser and his principles. Some of them may=
 seem friendly to us,=20

but the greater number are sullen and suspicious, regardless of the order t=
hat they are to appear=20

as friendly as possible to our American troops. Yet somehow one can't help =
feeling as if there=20

were plots against us of which we know nothing, just as there was in every =
allied country before=20

the beginning of the war."  Carlo smiled.  "Here I am saying the very chara=
cter of thing I asked you=20

not to speak of, Bianca! By the way, do you suppose we know any people here=
? Let us look=20

around and see."     CHAPTER XIV  _Major James Hersey_   ARRANGEMENTS had b=
een made=20

in Coblenz for the quartering of the officers of the American Army of Occup=
ation in certain German=20

homes, payment being made in an ordinary business fashion.  On arriving in =
Coblenz, after his=20

illness in Luxemburg, Major Jimmie Hersey discovered that especially comfor=
table=20

accommodations had been prepared for him. Also he was to have as his compan=
ion, a personal=20

friend, Sergeant Donald Hackett an exception being made to the sergeant's l=
iving in the same=20

house with his commanding officer.  The household in which the two young Am=
ericans were=20

located was one of the many households at this time in Germany whose state =
of mind it would=20

have been difficult for any outsider to have understood or explained.  The =
head of the family,=20

Colonel Otto Liedermann, was an old man, now past seventy, who had once bee=
n a member of=20

the Kaiser's own guard. His son, Captain Ludwig Liedermann had been serious=
ly wounded six=20

months before the close of the war, and, although at present in his own hom=
e, was still this work=20

better than this gang we've had to hire here. Just to be on the safe side, =
I'm promoting all of them,=20

as of oh-eight-hundred this morning, to assistant gang-foremen, on salaries=
. That'll take them=20

outside union jurisdiction."  "But how about our contract with the I.F.A.W.=
?"  "That's been voided,=20

by Crandall's own act, in interfering with the execution of our contract wi=
th the Atomic Power=20

Authority. You know what I think? I think the I.F.A.W. front office is goin=
g to have to disavow this.=20

It'll hurt them to do it, but they'll have to. Crandall's put them in the m=
iddle on this."  "How about=20

security clearance for our own men?"  "Nothing to that," Melroy said. "Most=
 of them are security-

cleared, already, from the work we did installing that counter-rocket contr=
ol system on the U.S.S.=20

_Alaska_, and the work we did on that symbolic-logic computer for the Phila=
delphia Project. It may=20

take all day to get the red tape unwound, but I think we can be ready to st=
art by oh-eight-hundred=20

tomorrow."         *       *       *       *       *  By the time Keating h=
ad rounded up all the regular Melroy=20

Engineering Corporation employees and Melroy had talked to Colonel Bradshaw=
 about security-

clearance, it was 1430. A little later, he was called on the phone by Leigh=
ton, the Atomic Power=20

Authority man.  "Melroy, what are you trying to do?" the Power Authority ma=
n demanded. "Get this=20



whole plant struck shut? The I.F.A.W.'s madder than a shot-stung bobcat. Th=
ey claim you're going=20

to bring in strike-breakers; they're talking about picketing the whole reac=
tor area."  "News gets=20

around fast, here, doesn't it?" Melroy commented. He told Leighton what he =
had in mind. The=20

Power Authority man was considerably shaken before he had finished.  "But t=
hey'll call a strike on=20

the whole plant! Have you any idea what that would mean?"  "Certainly I hav=
e. They'll either call it=20

in legal form, in which case the whole thing will go to mediation and get a=
ired, which is what I=20

want, or they'll pull a Pearl Harbor on you, the way they did on me. And in=
 that case, the President=20

will have to intervene, and they'll fly in technicians from some of the Arm=
ed Forces plants to keep=20

this place running. And in that case, things'll get settled that much quick=
er. This Crandall thinks=20

these men I fired are martyrs, and he's preaching a crusade. He ought to ca=
rry an _advocatus=20

diaboli_ on his payroll, to scrutinize the qualifications of his martyrs, b=
efore he starts canonizing=20

them."  A little later, Doris Rives came into the office, her hands full of=
 papers and cards.  "I have=20

twelve more tests=20


_
daughter, Hedwig, who must have been a little over twenty years of age. The=
 second wife, Frau=20

Liedermann, was much younger than her husband, and her children were two ch=
arming little girls,=20

Freia and Gretchen, who were but six and eight years old.  Outwardly the Ge=
rman family was=20

apparently hospitably disposed to their enemy guests, although they made no=
 pretence of too=20

great friendliness. They saw that the Americans were cared for, that their =
food was well cooked=20

and served. Yet only the two little girls, Freia and Gretchen, possessed of=
 no bitter memories,=20

were disposed to be really friendly.  And in boyish, American fashion, the =
two young officers, who=20

were slightly embarrassed by living among a family with whom they had so la=
tely been at war,=20

returned the attitude of admiration and cordiality of the little German mai=
ds.  Freia was a slender,=20

grave little girl with sunshiny hair and large, soft blue eyes, and Gretche=
n like her, only smaller and=20

stouter with two little yellow pigtails, and dimples, in her pink cheeks.  =
One afternoon Major Jimmie=20

Hersey was sitting alone in a small  Melroy laughed. "Doctor, they're all w=
ashed out," he told her.=20

"It seems there was an additional test, and they all flunked it. Evinced wi=
llingness to follow unwise=20

leadership and allow themselves to be talked into improper courses of actio=
n. You go on in to New=20

York, and take all the test-material, including sound records, with you. St=
ay at the hotel--your pay=20

will go on--till I need you. There'll be a Federal Mediation hearing in a d=
ay or so."  He had two=20

more telephone calls. The first, at 1530, was from Leighton. Melroy suspect=
ed that the latter had=20

been medicating his morale with a couple of stiff drinks: his voice was alm=
ost jaunty.  "Well, the=20

war's on," he announced. "The I.F.A.W.'s walking out on the whole plant, at=
 oh-eight-hundred=20

tomorrow."  "In violation of the Federal Labor Act, Section Eight, paragrap=
hs four and five," Melroy=20

supplemented. "Crandall really has stuck his neck in the guillotine. What's=
 Washington doing?"=20

"President Hartley is ordering Navy personnel flown in from Kennebunkport R=
eaction Lab; they will=20

be here by about oh-three-hundred tomorrow. And a=20

k for the day was over,=20

the drill hour was past and the soldiers, save those on special leave, had =
returned to their=20

barracks.  One could scarcely have said that the young American officer was=
 homesick, for there=20

is something really more desolate than this misfortune. He was without a ho=
me anywhere in the=20

world for which he could be lonely. An only son, his mother had died when h=
e had been six=20

months in France.  It was true that he had a sister to whom he was warmly a=
ttached, but she had=20

married since her brother's departure for Europe, and for this reason he di=
d not feel as if she=20

belonged to him in the old fashion of the past.  At the moment he was looki=

negotiators are coming in from the national union headquarters at Oak Ridge=
: they should be=20

getting in about the same time. You'd better be on hand, and have Dr. Rives=
 there with you.=20

There's a good chance this thing may get cleared up in a day or so."  "I wi=
ll undoubtedly be there,=20

complete with Dr. Rives," Melroy replied. "It will be a pleasure!"         =

hour later, Ben Puryear called from the reactor area, his voice strained wi=

know what those--" He gargled obscenities for a moment. "You know what they=
've done? They've=20
