and remained alone with the Head for half an hour. At the end of that time =
he came out and drove=20

_
County received a gift from him--the privilege of coming free of expense to=
 Ridgley. For two years=20

Teeny-bits had been going to the high school at Greensboro, covering the fo=
ur miles on his bicycle=20

morning and afternoon. Then the unbelievable had happened: he had won the R=
idgley=20

scholarship, and father and mother Holbrook, whose hearts were centered on =
his future, received=20

the news as a direct gift from Heaven. Their pride in him made up for the l=
oneliness of the house=20

after he had gone.  The career of Teeny-bits at Ridgley was not to be witho=
ut its incidents, it=20

seemed. He had been a roomer in Gannett Hall only ten days and the feeling =
of newness had not=20

worn off when the school was treated to a sensation that caused no little t=
alk and brought him into=20

more prominence than had the victory in the wrestling match.  On a Wednesda=
y morning before=20

breakfast a sheet of paper was found tacked to the bulletin board that hung=
 inside the door of the=20

dormitory. The message that it bore had been typed crudely as if the person=
 who had done it were=20

a novice in the use of the typewriter. It consisted of two straggling lines=
 and the words were:=20

"Beware of Teeny-bits! Holbrook is not his name! He's ashamed to tell the t=
ruth!"  Two dozen boys=20

saw the paper and read the message before Snubby Turner tore it down and ca=
rried it up to=20

Teeny-bits' room. They told other boys about it and no end of talk went rou=
nd the school.  "This=20

was on the bulletin board," said Snubby to Teeny-bits. "A lot of the fellow=
s wonder what the=20

dickens it means."  "You're a good friend of mine, Snubby," said Teeny-bits=
, "and I'll tell you what it=20

means. I wonder if Bassett put it up--but I don't see how he knew anything =
about me--unless=20

Tracey Campbell told him. Tracey lives over in Greensboro and went to publi=
c school with me."=20

"Bassett tags around after him like a tame sheep--I don't like either one o=
f them," said Snubby.=20

The story that Teeny-bits told his friend was the same story that Mr. Holbr=
ook had told Doctor=20

Wells.  Teeny-bits had never known who his father and mother were--and yet =
his mother, or at=20

least the woman whom he believed to be his mother, lay buried in the villag=
e cemetery. Her grave=20

was marked with a plain slab of marble in which was cut the brief inscripti=
on:       "An unknown=20

Mother. Died August 9th. 1903."  Teeny-bits remembered well the story of th=
at tragic day as told=20

him by the man whom he had always fondly known as Dad,--old Dad Holbrook wi=
th the white hair=20

and the limp. On that long-ago day a train had crawled slowly into the stat=
ion at Hamilton. There=20

was a hot box on one of the cars, and while the train waited for the heated=
 metal to cool, a woman=20

with a small child--a boy of about a year and a half--stepped down to the t=
rack to find relief from=20

the stifling air of the car. The Chicago express had come hurtling down the=
 track at fifty miles an=20

hour. Warning shouts had gone up, but the young woman had appeared obliviou=
s of her danger.=20

Those who saw the tragedy were convinced that she was deaf. At any rate eve=
ry one agreed that=20

she was unaware of the oncoming express until too late. Then, sensing the d=
anger or hearing at=20

last the shriek of the whistle behind her, she snatched up the child and tr=
ied to leap to safety. The=20

realization that she was too late must have come upon her, for in the last =
fraction of a second she=20

tossed the child to one side. The express, grinding all its brakes in a vai=
n endeavor to stop, had=20

instantly killed her. The baby escaped with a few scratches.  The matter of=
 identifying the=20

unfortunate mother had at first seemed 139, or be =3D 4820. By thus fixing =
the extent of one interval=20

after another, from the temperaments of either of the different kinds of co=
ncords, as is most=20

convenient, the intervals in question will be found to have the values exhi=
bited in Table VI.  Let the=20

numbers in this table be added successively, beginning at the bottom, to th=
e log. of 240, the=20

number of vibrations per second of the tenor C, (see Rees's Cyc. Art. Conce=
rt Pitch,) and the=20



numbers corresponding to these logarithms will be the vibrations in a secon=
d, of a string sounding=20

the several degrees of the scale. They are shown in col. 6, Table VII.  Sin=
ce the length of a string=20

c=C3=A6teris paribus is inversely as its number of vibrations, the lengths =
in col. 5 may be deduced from=20

the vibrations in col. 6; or more expeditiously, by subtracting the numeric=
al distances from C of the=20

several degrees in Table VI. from O, and taking the corresponding numbers, =
from the table of=20

logarithms. These numbers, when used as logarithms, must be brought back to=
 the decimal form,=20

agreeably to Scholium 2. Prop. I.  To find the number of beats made in a se=
cond by any concord, it=20

is only necessary to take from col. 5 the numbers belonging to the degrees =
which terminate that=20

concord, and to multiply them crosswise into the terms of its perfect ratio=
. The difference of the=20

products will be the number of beats made in a second. The 3 last columns c=
ontain the beats=20

made by each of the concords, in 10 seconds.   TABLE VI.    C  +------+----=

rt of his own, Teeny-

bits Holbrook found himself somewhat of a character at Ridgley School befor=
e he had been there=20

two weeks.     CHAPTER II  A BLEMISH   In the middle of October Teeny-bits =
surprised every one=20

by going out for the football team. Even his most loyal friends thought tha=
t he had lost his senses.=20

The team was particularly heavy this year; the first-string men were big, w=
ell-formed, aggressive=20

players of the type of Neil Durant, who weighed one hundred and sixty pound=
s with not an ounce=20

of fat, and who was quite as good a half-back, it was said, as many college=
 players. The most that=20

Teeny-bits could hope for was a place on the scrub, but that meant drudgery=
 of the worst sort and=20

a daily mauling that was enough to take the courage out of larger boys than=
 he.  "They'll make=20

Hamburger steak out of you!" warned Snubby Turner. "You'd better not do it.=
"  "Good night,=20

Teeny-bits! do you want to commit suicide!" said Fred Harper. "I'll hang a =
wreath on your door."=20

But the first team did not put an end to Teeny-bits' career. They laughed w=
hen the coach gave him=20

a chance on the scrub one afternoon and laughed harder when he at last got =
a chance to carry the=20

ball and by clever dodging succeeded in making a twenty-yard gain. He slipp=
ed out of the grasp of=20

Ned Stillson and nearly eluded big Tom Curwood, who covered Teeny-bits so c=
ompletely when he=20

finally had him down that ball and runner were almost completely out of sig=
ht.  "He's as slippery as=20

an eel," said big Tom.  "And so small you can't see him," growled Ned Still=
son.  After that the first=20

team watched him like tomcats watching a mouse and Teeny-bits got no chance=
 to break away.=20

In the locker room after practice Mr. Murray, the coach, came over and laid=
