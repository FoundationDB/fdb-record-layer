king's _
come in or a railway-train pass away without feeling lonesome. It reminds m=
e how big is the=20

outside world, how infinitesimal is Chaddie McKail and her unremembered exi=
stence up here a=20

thousand miles from Nowhere! It humbles me. It reminds me that I have in so=
me way failed to=20

mesh in with the bigger machinery of life.  I had a lump in my throat, by t=
he time Dinky-Dunk's train=20

pulled in and I saw him swing down from the car-steps. I made for him throu=
gh the crowd, in fact,=20

with my all but forgotten Australian crawl-stroke, and accosted him with ra=
ther a briny kiss and so=20

tight a hug that he stood back and studied my face. He wanted to ask, I kno=
w, if anything had=20

happened. He was obviously startled, and just a trifle embarrassed. My lump=
, by this time, was=20

bigger than ever, but I had to swallow it in secret. Dinky-Dunk, I found, w=
as changed in many=20

ways. He was tired, and he seemed older. But he was prosperous-looking, in =
brand-new raiment,=20

and reported that luck was still with him and everything was flourishing. G=
ive him one year, he=20

protested, and he'd show them he wasn't a piker.  I waited for him to ask a=
bout the children, but=20

his mind seemed full of his Barcona coal business. The railway was learning=
 to treat them half=20

decently and the coal was coming out better than they'd hoped for. They'd a=
 franchise to light the=20

town, developing their power from the mine screenings, and what they got fr=
om this would be so=20

much velvet. And he had a chance to take over one of the finest houses in M=
ount Royal, if he had=20

a family along with him to excuse such magnificence.  That final speech of =
his brought me up=20

short. It was dark along the trail, and dark in my heart. And more things t=
han one had happened=20

that day to humble me. So I took one hand off the wheel and put it on his k=
nee.  "Do you want me=20

to go to Calgary?" I asked him.  "That's up to you," he said, without budgi=
ng an inch. He said it, in=20

fact, with a steel-cold finality which sent my soul cringing back into its =
kennel. And the trail ahead=20

of me seemed blacker than ever.  "I'll have to have time to think it over,"=
 I said with a composure=20

which was nine-tenths pretense.  "Some wives," he remarked, "are willing to=
 help their husbands."=20

"I know it, Dinky-Dunk," I acknowledged, hoping against hope he'd give me t=
he opening I was=20

looking for. "And I want to help, if you'll only let me."  "I think I'm doi=
ng my part," he rather solemnly=20

asserted. I couldn't see his face, in the dark, but there was little hope t=
o be wrung from the tone of=20

his voice. So I knew it would be best to hold my peace.  Casa Grande blazed=
 a welcome to us, as=20

we drove up to it, and the children, thank heaven, were relievingly boister=
ous over the adventure=20

of their dad's return. He seemed genuinely amazed at their growth, seemed s=
lightly irritated at=20

Dinkie's long stares of appraisal, and feigned an interest in the paraded n=
ew possessions of=20

Poppsy and her brother--until it came to Peter's toy air-ship, which was th=
rust almost bruskly=20

aside.  And that reminds me of one thing which I am reluctant to acknowledg=
e. Dinky-Dunk was=20

anything but nice to Susie. He may have his perverse reasons for disliking =
everything in any way=20

connected with Peter Ketley, but I at least expected my husband to be agree=
able to the casual=20

guest under his roof. Through it all, I must confess, Susie was wonderful. =
She made no effort to=20

ignore Duncan, as his ignoring of her only too plainly merited. She remaine=
d, not only poised and=20

imperturbable, but impersonal and impenetrable. She found herself, I think,=
 driven just a tiny bit=20

closer to Gershom, who still shows a placid exterior to Duncan's slightly c=
ontemptuous=20

indifference.  My husband, I'm afraid, was not altogether happy in his own =
home. In one way, of=20

course, I can not altogether blame him for that, since his bigger interests=
 now are outside that=20

home. But I begin to see how dangerous these long separations can be. Somew=
here and at some=20

time, before too much water runs under the bridges, there will have to be a=
 readjustment.  I=20



realized that, in fact, as I drove Duncan back to the station last night, a=
fter I'd duly signed the=20

different papers he'd brought for that purpose. I had a feeling that every =
chug of the motor was=20

carrying him further and further out of my life. Heaven knows, I was willin=
g enough to eat crow. I=20

was ready to bury the hatchet, and bury it in my own bosom, if need be, rat=
her than see it swinging=20

free to strike some deeper blow.  "Dinky-Dunk," I said after a particularly=
 long silence between us,=20

"what is it you want me to do?"  My heart was beating much faster than he c=
ould have imagined=20

and I was grateful for the chance to pretend the road was taking up most of=
 my attention.  "Do=20

about what?" he none too encouragingly inquired.  "We don't seem to be hitt=
ing it off the way we=20

should be," I went on, speaking as quietly as I was able. "And I want you t=
o tell me where I'm=20

failing to do my share."  That note of humility from me must have surprised=
 him a little, for we rode=20

quite a distance without a word.  "What makes you feel that way?" he finall=
y asked.  I found it hard=20

to answer that question. It would never be easy, at any rate, to answer it =
as I wanted to.  "Because=20

things can't go on this way forever," I found the courage to tell him.  "Wh=
y not?" he asked. He=20

seemed indifferent again.  "Because they're all wrong," I rather tremulousl=
y replied. "Can't you see=20

they're all wrong?"  "But why do you want them changed?" he asked with a di=
sheartening sort of=20

impersonality.  "For the sake of the children," I told him. And I could fee=
l the impatient movement=20

of his body on the car seat beside me.  "The children!" he repeated with ac=
id-drop deliberation.=20

"The children, of course! It's always the children!"  "You're still their f=
ather," I reminded him.  "A=20

sort of honorary president of the family," he amended.  Hope ebbed out of m=
y heart, like air out of=20

a punctured tire.  "Aren't you making it rather hard for me?" I demanded, t=
rying to hold myself in,=20

but feeling the bob-cat getting the better of the purring tabby.  "I've rat=
her concluded that was the=20

way you made it for _me_," countered Duncan, with a coolness of manner whic=
h I came more and=20

more to resent.  "In what way?" I asked.  "In shutting up shop," he rather =
listlessly responded.  "I=20

don't think I quite understand," I told him.  "Well, in crowbarring me out =
of your scheme of life, if=20

you insist on knowing," were the words that came from the husband sitting s=
o close beside me.=20

"You had your other interests, of course. But you also seem to have had the=
 idea that you could=20

turn me loose like a range horse. I could paw for my fodder and eat snow wh=
en I got thirsty. You=20

didn't even care to give me a wind-break to keep a forty-mile blizzard out =
of my bones. You didn't=20

know where I was browsing, and didn't much care. It was up to me to rustle =
for myself and be=20

rounded up when the winter was over and there was another spell of work on =
hand!"  We rode on=20

in silence, for almost a mile, with the cold air beating against my body an=
d a colder numbness=20

creeping about the corner of my heart.  "Do you mean, Dinky-Dunk," I finall=
y asked, "that you want=20

your freedom?"  "I'm not saying that," he said, after another short silence=
.  "Then what is it you=20

want?" I asked, wondering why the windshield should look so blurred in the =
half-light.  "I want to=20

get something out of life," was his embittered retort.  It was a retort tha=
t I thought over, thought=20

over with an oddly settling mind, like a stirred pool that has been left to=
 clear itself. For that grown=20

man sitting there beside me seemed ridiculously like a spoiled child, an in=
dulged child forlornly=20

alone in the fogs of his own arrogance. He made me think of a black bear wh=
ich bites at the bullet=20

wound in his own body. I felt suddenly sorry for him, in a maternal sort of=
 way. I felt sorry for him at=20

the same time that I remained a trifle afraid of him, for he still possesse=
d, I knew, his black-bear=20

power of inflicting unlooked-for and ursine blows. I simply ached to swing =
about on him and say:=20

"Dinky-Dunk, what you need is a good spanking!" But I didn't have the coura=
ge. I had to keep my=20



sense of humor under cover, just as you have to blanket garden-geraniums be=
fore the threat of a=20

black frost. Yet, oddly enough, I felt fortified by that sense of pity. It =
seemed to bring with it the=20

impression that Duncan was still a small boy who might some day grow out of=
 his badness. It=20

made me feel suddenly older and wiser than this overgrown child who was sti=
ll crying for the=20

moon. And with that feeling came a wave of tolerance, followed by a smaller=
 wave of faith, of faith=20

that everything might yet come out right, if only I could learn to be patie=
nt, as mothers are patient=20

with children.  "And I, on my part, Dinky-Dunk, want to see you get the ver=
y best out of life," I=20

found myself saying to him. My intentions were good, but I suppose I made m=
y speech in a very=20

superior and school-teachery sort of way.  "I guess I've got about all that=
's coming to me," he=20

retorted, with the note of bitterness still in his voice.  And again I had =
the feeling of sitting mother-

wise and mother-patient beside an unruly small boy.  "There's much more, Di=
nky-Dunk, if you only=20

ask for it," I said as gently as I was able.  He turned, at that, and studi=
ed me in the failing light,=20

studied me with a sharp look God which was far holier than the memorial abb=
ey afterwards built by=20

the Norman Conqueror at Battle. The revival of monasticism among the Englis=
h, however, was=20

probably no easy task, for their domestic and somewhat material nature neve=
r was well suited to=20

monastic life. The monastery schools, the germs, as has been already said, =
of our modern=20

universities and colleges, were the King's main organs in restoring educati=
on; but he had also a=20

school in his palace for the children of the nobility and the royal househo=
ld. It was not only clerical=20

education that he desired to promote. His wish was "that all the free-born =
youth of his people, who=20

possessed the means, might persevere in learning so long as they had no oth=
er work to occupy=20

them, until they could perfectly read the English scriptures; while such as=
 desired to devote=20

themselves to the service of the Church might be taught Latin." No doubt th=
e wish was most=20

imperfectly fulfilled, but still it was a noble wish. We are told the King =
himself was often present at=20

the instruction of the children in the palace school. A pleasant calm after=
 the storms of battle with=20

the Dane!  Oxford (Ousen-ford, the ford of the Ouse) was already a royal ci=
ty; and it may be=20

conjectured that, amidst the general restoration of learning under Alfred, =
a school of some sort=20

would be opened there. This is the only particle of historical foundation f=
or the academic legend=20

which gave rise to the recent celebration. Oxford was desolated by the Norm=
an Conquest, and=20

anything that remained of the educational institution of Alfred was in all =
probability swept away.=20

Another measure, indispensable to the civilizer as well as to the church re=
former in those days,=20

was to restore the intercourse with Rome, and through her with continental =
Christendom, which=20

had been interrupted by the troubles. The Pope, upon Alfred's accession, ha=
d sent him gifts and a=20

piece of the Holy Cross. Alfred sent embassies to the Pope, and made a volu=
ntary annual offering,=20

to obtain favourable treatment for his subjects at Rome. But, adopted child=
 of Rome, and naturally=20

attached to her as the centre of ecclesiastical order and its civilizing in=
fluences though he was,=20

and much as he was surrounded by ecclesiastical friends and ministers, we t=
race in him no=20

ultramontanism, no servile submission to priests. The English Church, so fa=
r as we can see,=20

remains national, and the English King remains its head.  Not only with Lat=
in but with Eastern=20

Christendom, Alfred, if we may trust the contemporary Saxon chronicles, ope=
ned communication.=20

As Charlemagne, in the spirit partly perhaps of piety, partly of ambition, =
had sent an embassy with=20

proofs of his grandeur to the Caliph of Bagdad; as Louis XIV., in the spiri=
t of mere ambition,=20

delighted to receive an embassy from Siam; so Alfred, in a spirit of piety =
unmixed, sent=20



ambassadors to the traditional Church of St. Thomas in India: and the ambas=
sadors returned, we=20

are told, with perfumes and precious stones as the memorials of their journ=
ey, which were long=20

preserved in the churches. "This was the first intercourse," remarks Pauli,=
 "that took place=20

between England and Hindostan."  All nations are inclined to ascribe their =
primitive institutions to=20

some national founder, a Lycurgus, a Theseus, a Romulus. It is not necessar=
y now to prove that=20

Alfred did not found trial by jury, or the frank- pledge, or that he was no=
t the first who divided the=20

kingdom into shires, hundreds, or tithings. The part of trial by jury which=
 has been politically of so=20

much importance, its popular character, as opposed to arbitrary trial by a =
royal or imperial officer--

that of which the preservation, amidst the general prevalence of judicial i=
mperialism, has been the=20

glory of England--was simply Teutonic; so was the frank-pledge, the rude ma=
chinery for preserving=20

law and order by mutual responsibility in the days before police; so were t=
he hundreds and the=20

tithings, rudimentary institutions marking the transition from the clan to =
the local community or=20

canton. The shires probably marked some stage in the consolidation of the S=
axon settlements; at=20

all events they were ancient divisions which Alfred can at most only have r=
econstituted in a revised=20

form after the anarchy.  He seems, however, to have introduced a real and m=
omentous innovation=20

by appointing special judges to administer a more regular justice than that=
 which was administered=20

in the local courts of the earls and bishops, or even in the national assem=
bly. In this respect he=20

was the imitator, probably the unconscious imitator, of Charlemagne, and th=
e precursor of Henry=20

II., the institutor of our Justices in Eyre. The powers and functions of th=
e legislature, the executive=20

and the judiciary, lie at first enfolded in the same germ, and are alike ex=
ercised by the king, or, as=20

in the case of the ancient republics, by the national assembly. It is a gre=
at step when the special=20

office of the judiciary is separated from the rest. It is a great step also=
 when uniformity of justice is=20

introduced. Probably, however, these judges, like the itinerant justices of=
 Henry II., were=20

administrative as well as judicial officers; or, in the terms of our modern=
 polity, they were delegates=20

of the Home Office as well as of the Central Courts of Law.  In his laws, A=
lfred, with the sobriety=20

and caution on which the statesmen of his race have prided themselves, reno=
unces the character=20

of an innovator, fearing, as he says, that his innovations might not be acc=
epted by those who=20

would come after him. His code, if so inartificial a document can be dignif=
ied with the name, is=20

mainly a compilation from the laws of his Saxon predecessors. We trace, how=
ever, an advance=20

from the barbarous system of weregeld, or composition for murder and other =
crimes as private=20

wrongs, towards a State system of criminal justice. In totally forbidding c=
omposition for blood, and=20

asserting that indefeasible sanctity of human life which is the essential b=
asis of civilization, the=20

code of Moses stands contrasted with other primaeval codes. Alfred, in fact=
, incorporated an=20

unusually large amount of the Mosaic and Christian elements, which blend wi=
th Germanic customs=20

and the relics of Roman law, in different proportions, to make up the vario=
us codes of the early=20

Middle Ages, called the Laws of the Barbarians. His code opens with the Ten=
 Commandments,=20

followed by extracts from Exodus, containing the Mosaic law respecting the =
relations between=20

masters and servants, murder and other crimes, and the observance of holy d=
ays, and the=20

Apostolic Epistle from Acts xv 23-29. Then is added Matthew vii. 12, "Whats=
oever ye would that=20

men should do to you, do ye even so to them." "By this one Commandment," sa=
ys Alfred, "a man=20

shall know whether he does right, and he will then require no other law-boo=
k." This is not the form=20

of a modern Act of Parliament, but legislation in those days was as much pr=
eaching as enactment;=20



it often resembled in character the Royal Proclamation against Vice and Imm=
orality.  Alfred's laws=20

unquestionably show a tendency to enforce loyalty to the king, and to enhan=
ce the guilt of treason,=20

which, in the case of an attempt on the king's life, is punished with death=
 and confiscation, instead=20

of the old composition by payment of the royal weregeld. Hence he has been =
accused of=20

imperializing and anti-Teutonic tendencies; he had even the misfortune to b=
e fixed upon as a=20

prototype by Oxford advocates of the absolutism of Charles I. There is no g=
round for the charge,=20

so far at least as Alfred's legislation or any known measure of his governm=
ent is concerned. The=20

kingly power was the great source of order and justice amidst that anarchy,=
 the sole rallying point=20

and bond of union for the imperilled nation; to maintain it, and protect fr=
om violence the life of its=20

holder, was the duty of a patriot law-giver: and as the authority of a Saxo=
n king depended in great=20

measure on his personal character and position, no doubt the personal autho=
rity of Alfred was=20

exceptionally great. But he continued to govern by the advice of the nation=
al council; and the=20

fundamental principles of the Teutonic polity remained unimpaired by him, a=
nd were transmitted=20

intact to his successors. His writings breathe a sense of the responsibilit=
ies of rulers and a hatred=20

of tyranny. He did not even attempt to carry further the incorporation of t=
he subordinate kingdoms=20

with Wessex; but ruled Mercia as a separate state by the hand of his brothe=
r-in-law, and left it to=20

its own national council or witan. Considering his circumstances, and the c=
haos from which his=20

government had emerged, it is wonderful that he did not centralize more. He=
 was, we repeat, a=20

true Teuton, and entirely worthy of his place in the Germanic Walhalla.  Th=
e most striking proof of=20

his multifarious activity of mind, and of the unlimited extent of the task =
which his circumstances=20

imposed upon him, as well as of his thoroughly English character, is his un=
dertaking to give his=20

people a literature in their own tongue. To do this he had first to educate=
 himself--to educate=20

himself at an advanced age, after a life of fierce distraction, and with th=
e reorganization of his=20

shattered kingdom on his hands. In his boyhood he had got by heart Saxon la=
ys, vigorous and=20

inspiring, but barbarous; he had learned to read, but it is thought that he=
 had not learned to write.=20

"As we were one day=20


_
he did so, of something epochal in the air, as though the drama of life wer=
e narrowing up to its=20

climactic last moment. Yet I felt helpless to direct the course of that dra=
ma. I nursed the=20

impression that we stood at the parting of the ways, that we stood hesitati=
ng at the fork of two long=20

and lonely trails which struck off across an illimitable world, farther and=
 farther apart. I vaguely=20

regretted that we were already in the streets of Buckhorn, for I was half h=
oping that Duncan would=20

tell me to stop the car. Then I vaguely regretted that I was busy driving t=
hat car, as otherwise I=20

might have been free to get my arms about that granitic Dour Man of mine an=
d strangle him into=20

submitting to that momentary mood of softness which seems to come less and =
less to the male as=20

he grows older.  But Duncan merely laughed, a bit uneasily, and just as sud=
denly grew silent=20

again. I had a sense of asbestos curtains coming down between us, coming do=
wn before the=20

climax was reached or the drama was ended. I couldn't help wondering, as we=
 drove into the=20

cindered station-yard where the lights were already twinkling, if Dinky-Dun=
k, like myself, sat=20

waiting for something which failed to manifest itself, if he too had held b=
ack before the promise of=20

some decisive word which I was without the power to utter. For we were only=
 half-warm, the two of=20

us, toying with the ghosts of the dead past and childishly afraid of the fu=
ture. We were Laodiceans,=20

neither hot nor cold, without the primal hunger to reach out and possess wh=
at we too timidly=20

desired. We were more neutral even than Ferdinand and the Lady of the Bust,=
 for we no longer=20

cared sufficiently to let the other know we cared, but waited and waited in=
 that twilight where all=20

cats are gray.  There was, mercifully, very little time left for us before =
the train came in. We kept=20

our masks on, and talked only of every-day things, about the receipt for th=
e ranch taxes and what=20

steers Whinnie should "finish" and the new granary roof and the fire-lines =
about the haystacks.=20

Without quite knowing it, when the train pulled in, I put my arm through my=
 husband's--and for the=20

second time that evening he turned sharply and inspected my face. I felt as=
 though I wanted to=20

hold him back, to hold him back from something unescapable but tragically m=
omentous. I think he=20

felt sorry for me. At any rate, after he had swung his suit-case up on the =
car-platform, he turned=20

and kissed me good-by. But it was the sort of kiss one gets at funerals. It=
 left me standing there=20

watching the tail-lights blink off down the track, as desolate as though I =
had been left alone on the=20

deadest promontory of the deadest planet lost in space. I stood there until=
 the lights were gone. I=20

stood there until the platform was empty again and my car was the only car =
left along the hard-

packed cinders. So I climbed into the driving-seat, and pulled on my gauntl=
ets, and headed for=20

home....  Back at Casa Grande I found Dinkie and Whinnie beside the bunk-ho=
use stove,=20

struggling companionably through the opening chapters of _Treasure Island_.=
 My boy smiled up at=20

me, for a moment, but his mind, I could see, was intent on the page along w=
hich Whinnie's=20

stubbled finger was crawling like a plowshare beside each furrow of text. H=
e was in the our wont, it=20

chanced that I read him a passage out of a certain book. After he had liste=
ned with fixed attention,=20

and expressed great delight, he showed me the little book which he always c=
arried about with him,=20

and in which the daily lessons, psalms and prayers, were written, and begge=
d me to transcribe=20

that passage into his book." Asser assented, but found that the book was al=
ready full, and=20

proposed to the king to begin another book, which was soon in its turn fill=
ed with extracts. A=20

portion of the process of Alfred's education is recorded by Asser. "I was h=
onourably received at=20

the royal mansion, and at that time stayed eight months in the king's court=
. I translated and read to=20

him whatever books he wished which were within our reach; for it was his cu=
stom, day and night,=20



amidst all his afflictions of mind and body, to read books himself or have =
them read to him by=20

others." To original composition Alfred did not aspire; he was content with=
 giving his people a body=20

of translations of what he deemed the best authors; here again showing his =
royal good sense. In=20

the selection of his authors, he showed liberality and freedom from Roman, =
ecclesiastical,=20

imperialist, or other bias. On the one hand he chooses for the benefit of t=
he clergy whom he=20

desired to reform, the "Pastoral Care" of the good Pope, Gregory the Great,=
 the author of the=20

mission which had converted England to Christianity; but on the other hand =
he chooses the=20

"Consolations of Philosophy," the chief work of Boethius, the last of the R=
omans, and the victim of=20

the cruel jealousy of Theodoric. Of Boethius Hallam says "Last of the class=
ic writers, in style not=20

impure, though displaying too lavishly that poetic exuberance which had dis=
tinguished the two or=20

three preceding centuries; in elevation of sentiment equal to any of the ph=
ilosophers; and mingling=20

a Christian sanctity with their lessons, he speaks from his prison in the s=
wan-like tones of dying=20

eloquence. The philosophy which consoled him in bonds was soon required in =
the sufferings of a=20

cruel death. Quenched in his blood, the lamp he had trimmed with a skilful =
hand gave no more=20

light; the language of Tully and Virgil soon ceased to be spoken; and many =
ages were to pass=20

away before learned diligence restored its purity, and the union of genius =
with imitation taught a=20

few modern writers to 'surpass in eloquence' the Latinity of Boethius." Bed=
e's Ecclesiastical=20

History of the English, the highest product of that memorable burst of Saxo=
n intellect which=20

followed the conversion, and a work, not untainted by miracle and legend, y=
et most remarkable for=20

its historical qualities as well as for its mild and liberal Christianity, =
is balanced in the king's series=20

of translations by the work of Orosius, who wrote of general and secular hi=
story, though with a=20

religious object. In the translation of Orosius, Alfred has inserted a sket=
ch of the geography of=20

Germany, and the reports of explorations made by two mariners under his aus=
pices among the=20

natives dwelling on the coasts of the Baltic and the North Sea--further pro=
of of the variety of his=20

interests and the reach of his mind.  In his prefaces, and in his amplifica=
tions and interpolations of=20

the philosophy of Boethius, Alfred comes before us an independent=20


_
my own house Struthers was putting a petulant-voiced Poppsy to bed, and Ger=
shom, up in his=20

room, was making extraordinary smells at his chemistry experiments. Susie I=
 found curled=20

comfortably up in front of the fire, idling over my first volume of _Jean C=
hristophe_.  She read=20

three sentences aloud as I sat down beside her. "How happy he is! He is mad=
e to be happy!...Life=20

will soon see to it that he is brought to reason."  She seemed to expect so=
me comment from me,=20

but I found myself with nothing to say. In fact, we both sat there for a lo=
ng time, staring in silence=20

at the fire.  "Why do you live with a man you don't love?" she suddenly ask=
ed out of the utter=20

stillness.  It startled me, that question. It also embarrassed me, for I co=
uld feel my color mount as=20

Susie's lapis-lazuli eyes rested on my face.  "What makes you think I don't=
 love him?" I countered,=20

reminding myself that Susie, after all, was and shows us something of his o=
wn mind on theology,=20

on philosophy, on government, and generally as to the estate of man. To est=
imate these passages=20

rightly, we must put ourselves back into the anarchical and illiterate Engl=
and of the ninth century,=20

and imagine a writer, who, if we could see him, would appear barbarous and =
grotesque, as would=20

all his equipments and surroundings, and one who had spent his days in a de=
sperate struggle with=20

wolfish Danes, seated at his literary work in his rude Saxon mansion, with =
his candle-clock=20

protected by the horn lantern against the wind. The utterances of Alfred wi=
ll then appear altogether=20

worthy of his character and his deeds. He always emphasizes and expands pas=
sages which=20

speak either of the responsibilities of rulers or of the nothingness of ear=
thly power; and the=20

reflections are pervaded by a pensiveness which reminds us of Marcus Aureli=
us. The political=20

world=20


_
"It's not a matter of thinking," was Susie's quiet retort. "I _know_ you do=
n't."  "Then I wish I could=20

be equally certain," I said with a defensive stiffening of the lines of dig=
nity.  But Susie smiled rather=20

wearily at my forlorn little parade of _hauteur_. Then she looked at the fi=
re.  "It's hell, isn't it, being=20

a woman?" she finally observed, unconsciously paraphrasing a much older phi=
losopher.=20

"Sometimes," I admitted.  "I don't see why you stand it," was her next medi=
tative shaft in my=20

direction.  "What would you do about it?" I guardedly inquired.  Susie's fa=
ce took on one of its=20

intent looks. She was only in her teens, but life, after it arrived at Mach=
iavelli.  There is an especial=20

sadness in the tone of some words respecting the estate of kings, their int=
rinsic weakness,=20

disguised only by their royal trains, the mutual dread that exists between =
them and those by whom=20

they are surrounded, the drawn sword that always hangs over their heads, "a=
s to me it ever did."=20

We seem to catch a glimpse of some trials, and perhaps errors, not recorded=
 by Asser or the=20

chroniclers.  In his private life Alfred appears to have been an example of=
 conjugal fidelity and=20

manly purity, while we see no traces of the asceticism which was revered by=
 the superstition of the=20

age of Edward the=20
