"I assumed responsibility for the money, Dan. Seemingly it was lost through=
 my carelessness. I=20

couldn't face the Cubs if I didn't make good."  Dan said no more. He knew t=
hat Mr. Hatfield, being=20

a man of honor, would keep his word. However, he realized also that the Hat=
fields were only=20

moderately well fixed and could not afford to lose so much of their savings=
.  "Now don't worry=20

about it, Dan," Mr. Hatfield said as they all arose from the breakfast tabl=
e. "You're taking this=20

matter entirely too seriously. Everything will come out in the wash."  "If =
the money isn't found, we'll=20

give up that new car we had intended to buy," declared Mrs. Hatfield. "Expe=
nsive automobiles are=20

an unnecessary luxury."  Dan looked so troubled that Mr. Hatfield, to take =
his mind off the money=20

box, said quickly:  "All set for the cook-out tonight?"  "Yes, sir!"  "Remi=
nd all the Cubs to meet here=20

at my house right after school. Now you and Fred had better get along to sc=
hool, or you'll be late."=20

Dan thanked the Hatfields for the breakfast, and gathering up his books, we=
nt off with Fred.  Later,=20

after school had been dismissed for the day, all the Cubs met at Mr. Hatfie=
ld's home for the hike=20

and cook-out.  No more was said about the missing tin box, for the Cub lead=
er felt that the matter=20

had been too much discussed. He preferred to have the boys center thoughts =
on the Knight=20

Crusade and their own activities.  Nevertheless, Dan fell into step with Br=
ad as they set off for the=20

marsh area, again bringing up the recent incident at Mr. Merrimac's home. S=
o far as either boy=20

knew, police had not been able to catch the man who had fled from the dwell=
ing.  "Brad, do you=20

suppose there could be any connection between that thief and the woman who =
took the tin box?"=20

Dan speculated.  "Search me," Brad returned, shifting his knapsack to the o=
ther shoulder. "Let's=20

forget the money for tonight and just have fun. Mr. Hatfield's worried enou=
gh without us always=20

reminding him of it."  "You're right," Dan agreed, properly set down. "Gues=
s I have had it on my=20

mind a lot lately."  The boys hiked to an old mill of historical interest. =
After spending a while there,=20

they back-tracked to the marshland area.  "I wonder if that old tramp is st=
ill camped out in the new=20

house?" Dan speculated as they passed the construction site.  Mr. Hatfield =
heard the remark.  "I=20

can answer that one," he informed the group. "I talked to Mr. Keeler, the c=
ontractor. He checked=20

and found you boys were right."  "Then the man was a tramp?" Brad asked.  "=
Yes, he had=20

managed to get in through a cellar window, and then had unlocked the door f=
rom inside. Until he=20

was caught, he enjoyed quite a comfortable existence."  "Arrested?" Brad qu=
estioned.  "No, he=20

slipped away before Mr. Keeler could call police. I understand no damage wa=
s done to the=20

property. He easily could have set the place on fire though."  "Say, when d=
o we sledge going first.=20

All the drivers were more or less the worse for merry-making, and the groom=
 was absorbed in his=20

bride.  The wolves were bad that winter, and every one knew it, yet when th=
ey heard the first wolf-

cry, the drivers were not much alarmed. They had too much good food and dri=
nk inside them. The=20

first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions. The w=
olves were coming=20

together. There was no moon, but the starlight was clear on the snow. A bla=
ck drove came up over=20

the hill behind the wedding party. The wolves ran like streaks of shadow; t=
hey looked no bigger=20

than dogs, but there were hundreds of them.  Something happened to the hind=
most sledge: the=20

driver lost control,--he was probably very drunk,--the horses left the road=
, the sledge was caught in=20

a clump of trees, and overturned. The occupants rolled out over the snow, a=
nd the fleetest of the=20

wolves sprang upon them. The shrieks that followed made everybody sober. Th=
e drivers stood up=20

and lashed their horses. The groom had the best team and his sledge was lig=
htest--all the others=20

carried from six to a dozen people.  Another driver lost control. The screa=
ms of the horses were=20



more terrible to hear than the cries of the men and women. Nothing seemed t=
o check the wolves.=20

It was hard to tell what was happening in the rear; the people who were fal=
ling behind shrieked as=20

piteously as those who were already lost. The little bride hid her face on =
the groom's shoulder and=20

sobbed. Pavel sat still and watched his horses. The road was clear and whit=
e, and the groom's=20

three blacks went like the wind. It was only necessary to be calm and to gu=
ide them carefully.  At=20

length, as they breasted a long hill, Peter rose cautiously and looked back=
. "There are only three=20

sledges left," he whispered.  "And the wolves?" Pavel asked.  "Enough! Enou=
gh for all of us."=20

Pavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him down =
the other side. In that=20

moment on the hilltop, they saw behind them a whirling black group on the s=
now. Presently the=20

groom screamed. He saw his father's sledge overturned, with his mother and =
sisters. He sprang=20

up as if he meant to jump, but the girl shrieked and held him back. It was =
even then too late. The=20

black ground-shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and o=
ne horse ran out=20

across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels. But the=
 groom's movement had=20

given Pavel an idea.  They were within a few miles of their village now. Th=
e only sledge left out of=20

six was not very far behind them, and Pavel's middle horse was failing. Bes=
ide a frozen pond=20

something happened to the other sledge; Peter saw it plainly. Three big wol=
ves got abreast of the=20

horses, and the horses went crazy. They tried to jump over each other, got =
tangled up in the=20

harness, and overturned the sledge.  When the shrieking behind them died=20


_
low."  "We can stop anywhere," Mr. Hatfield said. "Look for a suitable plac=
e."  "How about the one=20

we used last time?" suggested Chips. "It will save us clearing the ground."=
  The other Cubs shared=20

Chip's impatience, so a little farther on, a halt was called. While Brad an=
d Dan built a fire, Mr.=20

Hatfield set up a reflector oven which he had made from a square five-gallo=
n oil can.  "Pretty=20

fancy, aren't we?" Red said admiringly. "What are we eating?"  "Biscuits, f=
ried eggs and bacon.=20

How does it sound?"  "Swell!" Red answered, smacking his lips. "Just lead m=
e to it."  "Lead you to=20

it, like fun!" snorted Brad. "You're gonna help stir up the biscuits, not h=
ave 'em upon the familiar=20

road. "They still come?" he asked Peter.  "Yes."  "How many?"  "Twenty, thi=
rty--enough."  Now his=20

middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two. Pavel gave Peter th=
e reins and stepped=20

carefully into the back of the sledge. He called to the groom that they mus=
t lighten--and pointed to=20

the bride. The young man cursed him and held her tighter. Pavel tried to dr=
ag her away. In the=20

struggle, the groom rose. Pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and=
 threw the girl after=20

him. He said he never remembered exactly how he did it, or what happened af=
terward. Peter,=20

crouching in the front seat, saw nothing. The first thing either of them=20
