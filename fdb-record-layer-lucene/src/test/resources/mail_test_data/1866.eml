"I'd like to go into the business."  "You'd better open a second-hand cloth=
ing store," suggested=20

Paul, glancing at his companion's ragged attire.  "Maybe I will," said Jim =
with a grin, "if you'll buy of=20

me."  "I don't like the style," said Paul. "Who's your tailor?"  "He lives =
round in Chatham street.=20

Say, can't you lend a fellow a couple of shillin' to buy some breakfast?"  =
"Have you done any work=20

to-day?"  "No."  "Then you can't expect to eat if you don't work."  "I didn=
't have no money to start=20

with."  "Suppose you had a quarter, what would you do?"  "I'd buy a ten-cen=
t plate of meat, and=20

buy some evenin' papers with the rest."  "If you'll do that, I'll give you =
what you ask for."  "You'll=20

give me two shillin'?" repeated Jim, incredulously, for he remembered how h=
e had wronged Paul.=20

"Yes," said Paul. "Here's the money;" and he drew a twenty-five-cent piece =
from his vest pocket,=20

and handed it to Jim.  "You give me that after the mean trick I played you?=
" said Jim.  "Yes; I am=20

sorry for you and want to help you along."  "You're a brick!" exclaimed Jim=
, emphatically. "If any=20

feller tries to play a trick on you, you just tell me, and I'll lam him."  =
"All right, Jim!" said Paul,=20

kindly; "I'll remember it."  "There ain't anybody you want licked, is there=
?" asked Jim, earnestly.=20

"Not at present, thank you," said Paul, smiling.  "When you do, I'm on hand=
," said Jim. "Now I'll go=20

and get some grub."  He shuffled along toward Ann street, where there was a=
 cheap eating-house,=20

in which ten cents would pay for a plate of meat. He was decidedly hungry, =
and did justice to the=20

restaurant, whose style of cookery, though not very choice, suited him so w=
ell that he could readily=20

have eaten three plates of meat instead of one, but for the prudent thought=
 that compelled him to=20

reserve enough to embark in business afterwards. Jim was certainly a hard t=
icket; but Paul's=20

unexpected kindness had won him, and produced a more profound impression th=
an a dozen=20

floggings could have done. I may add that Jim proved luck in his business i=
nvestment, and by the=20

close of the afternoon had enough money to provide himself with supper and =
lodging, besides a=20

small fund to start with the next day.  Paul sold three more neckties, and =
then, though it yet lacked=20

an hour of the time when he generally proposed to close, he prepared to go =
home. He wanted to=20

communicate the good news to his mother and little Jimmy.  Mrs. Hoffman rai=
sed her eyes from=20

her sewing as he entered.  "Well, Paul," she said, "have you heard anything=
 of the ring?"  "Yes,=20

mother, it's sold."  "Is it? Well, we must do without it, then," said his m=
other in a tone of=20

disappointment.  "There won't be any trouble about that, mother, as long as=
 we have got the=20

money for it. I would rather have that than the ring."  "Did you recover it=
, then?" asked his mother,=20

eagerly.  "Yes, mother--listen and I will tell you all about it."  He sat d=
own and told the story to two=20

very attentive listeners.  "What did you do with the money, Paul?" asked Ji=
mmy.  "Mr. Preston is=20

keeping a hundred and fifty dollars for me. He will allow seven per cent. i=
nterest. But I must not=20

forget gaily-harnessed mules, and covered with a tilt made from the =E2=80=
=9Cistle,=E2=80=9D creaked through the=20

gate.  The great meson remained deserted, and by degrees, as a ship leaves =
the coast, we struck=20

into the wild and stony desert country, which, covered with a whitish dust =
of alkali, makes Tula an=20

oasis; then the great church sank low, and the tall palm-trees seemed to gr=
ow shorter; lastly=20

church, palms and towers, and the green fields planted with aloes, blended =
together and sank out=20

of sight, a faint white misty spot marking their whereabouts, till at last =
it too faded and melted into=20

the level plain.  Travellers in a perpetual stream we met journeying to Mex=
ico, and every now and=20

then passed a straw-thatched =E2=80=9Cjacal,=E2=80=9D where women sat selli=
ng =E2=80=9Catole,=E2=80=9D that is a kind of stirabout of=20

pine-nut meal and milk, and dishes seasoned hot with red pepper, with =E2=
=80=9Ctortillas=E2=80=9D made on the=20

=E2=80=9Cmetate=E2=80=9D of the Aztecs, to serve as bread and spoons.  The =
infidels, it seemed, had got ahead of=20



us, and when we slept had been descried making towards the north; two of th=
em armed with bows=20

which they had roughly made with sticks, the string twisted out of =E2=80=
=9Cistle,=E2=80=9D and the rest with clubs,=20

and what astonished me most was that behind them trotted a white dog.  Outs=
ide San Juan del=20

Rio, which we reached upon the second day, it seemed that in the night the =
homing Mescaleros=20

had stolen a horse, and two of them mounting upon him had ridden off, leavi=
ng the rest of the=20

forlorn and miserable band behind.  How they had lived so far in the scorch=
ed alkali-covered=20

plains, how they managed to conceal themselves by day, or how they steered =
by night, no one=20

could tell; for the interior Mexican knows nothing of the desert craft, and=
 has no idea that there is=20

always food of some kind for an Apache, either by digging roots, snaring sm=
all animals, or at the=20

last resort by catching locusts or any other insect he can find.  Nothing s=
o easy as to conceal=20

themselves; for amongst grass eight or nine inches high, they drop, and in =
an instant, even as you=20

look, are lost to sight, and if hard pressed sometimes escape attention by =
standing in a cactus=20

grove, and stretching out their arms, look so exactly like the plant that y=
ou may pass close to them=20

and be unaware, till their bow twangs, and an obsidian-headed arrow whistle=
s through the air.  Our=20

caravan rested a day outside San Juan del Rio to shoe the mules, repair the=
 harness, and for the=20

muleteers to go to mass or visit the =E2=80=9Cpoblana=E2=80=9D girls, who w=
ith flowers in their hair leaned out of=20

every balcony of the half-Spanish, half-Oriental-looking town, according to=
 their taste.  Not that the=20

halt lost time, for travellers all know that =E2=80=9Cto hear mass and to g=
ive barley to your beasts loses no=20

tittle of the day.=E2=80=9D  San Juan, the river almost dry, and trickling =
thirstily under its red stone bridges;=20

the fields of aloes, the poplars, and the stunted palms; its winding street=
 in which the houses,=20

overhanging, almost touch; its population, which seemed to pass their time =
lounging wrapped in=20

striped blankets up against the walls, was left behind.  The pulque-aloes a=
nd the sugar-canes=20

grew scarcer, the road more=20


_
belongs to you, mother, and not to me. Perhaps you would prefer to deposit =
it in a savings bank."=20

"I am quite satisfied with your disposal of it, Paul," said Mrs. Hoffman. "=
I little thought, when I found=20

the ring, that it would be of such service to us."  "It has set me up in bu=
siness," said Paul, "and I=20

am sure to make money. But I am getting out of stock. I must go round and b=
uy some more=20

neckties to-morrow."  "How much do you pay for your ties, Paul?" asked his =
=E2=80=9Cterra fria=E2=80=9D of the=20

central plain, and all the time the Sierra Madre, jagged and menacing, towe=
red in the west.  In my=20

mind=E2=80=99s eye I saw the Mescaleros trotting like wolves all through th=
e night along its base, sleeping=20

by day in holes, killing a sheep or goat when chance occurred, and followin=
g one another silent=20

and stoical in their tramp towards the north.  Days followed days as in a s=
hip at sea; the waggons=20

rolling on across the plains; and I jogging upon my horse,=20
