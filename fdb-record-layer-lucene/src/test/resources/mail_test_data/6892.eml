Estate League of New Jersey in Newark recently, Mr. Frank B. Jess, of Haddo=
n Heights, whose=20

experience on the State Board of Taxes and Assessment has made him an autho=
rity on the=20

subject of taxation, its inequalities and shortcomings, stated with positiv=
eness that the personal=20

property tax is a failure and always will be a failure. "It is obvious," he=
 added, "that if all the taxable=20

property in the State should be assessed at its true value, or at a uniform=
 percentage of true value,=20

the burden of taxation would be apportioned with exact equality. The chief =
objective of the=20

assessing system of the State, therefore, is uniformity of valuation. It wo=
uld be foolish to suppose=20

that this ideal can ever be wholly attained. But it is more foolish not to =
aim at its attainment. The=20

scheme of assessment should be devised with that end in view and so framed =
as to facilitate its=20

achievement. The prevailing scheme provides as many assessors as there are =
taxing units. Even=20

if each assessor were an expert the grand result inevitably would be a grea=
t variety of valuations.=20

As so many assessors are not experts the absence of uniformity is all the m=
ore conspicuous." Mr.=20

Jess said that each assessor or they are enough. Prepare for them, while th=
ey are Roasting, the=20

following Sauce: Take Crumbs of Bread, a little Pepper and Salt, and a Blad=
e or two of Mace with=20

a little Nutmeg, and boil them in some of the Oyster-Liquor till the Bread =
is tender and like a Pulp,=20

and tastes well of the Spice; then put in a Glass of White Wine, and mix it=
 well, and serve it hot, in=20

a Plate, with the roasted Oysters over the Sauce.    A Shoulder of _Mutton_=
 or _Lamb,_ roasted=20

 a Shoulder of=20

Mutton or Lamb, of the smallest size, and slip up the Skin almost to the Le=
g-Joint; then cut the=20

Flesh from the Bone, on the upper side, and mince it very small, take part =
of that, and as many=20

Oysters parboil'd without their Fins, and chopt a little; then have some Ma=
ce powder'd, and a little=20

Salt and Pepper, with some grated Lemon-Peel, and some grated Bread, with t=
he Yolk of an Egg,=20

or two; and make this into a Paste, and lay it into the Places where the Fl=
esh was taken out; and=20

you may add to this Paste a little Fat of Bacon cut small, or a little Butt=
er. Then skewer the Skin on=20

all sides, over the Farced Meat, and lard the Skin and the fleshy Parts bel=
ow with Lemon-Peel,=20

and some will lard in Lemon Thyme likewise. Then fix it on a Spit with Skew=
