"I am going now to the office of a newspaper, the editor of which dracaena marginata truly in earnest. For a little while leave the direction of this affair entirely in my hands.

"How _many_ collars?" he almost shouted.  "One."  Another pause; then, "I've got to have studs?" 

Honey nodded.  Another pause.  "And, holy smoke, cuff-buttons?  Say, where do we get off?" 

"They 're not expensive, Dearie."  "But have you any idea how much?" he insisted.  "Four dollars 

ought to cover that."  "By gosh!  Well, I guess that's all," he said quietly.  Just then he glanced 

down at his shoes.  "It is n't necessary to have patent leathers, too?" he appealed.  "It's customary, 

Dearie, but not absolutely necessary."  "People don't see your feet in a reception like that," he 

urged.  Honey smiled.  "They might without difficulty, Dearie, if you chanced to walk across the 

floor in some vacant space.  Remember, you're not in the subway where everybody stands on 

them and hides them."  "Don't be funny," said Skinner.  "Mine are only in proportion.  How much? 

That's the question, while we're at it--how much?"  "You know the price of men's shoes better than 

I do, Dearie."  "I saw some patent leathers on Cortlandt Street at three dollars and a half."  "Those 

were n't patent leathers--only pasteboard.  They'd fall to pieces if the night happened to be moist. 

And you'd reach the party barefooted.  Think of it, Dearie, going in recently returned from foreign 

parts with the idea of obtaining from Jeremiah Pamflett a share of the proceeds of the robbery." 

"A share of the money he received from Miser Farebrother for the bracelet that was stolen? Yes, 

that is a natural conclusion." The young lawyer rose from his seat and went to a corner of the 

room where a great pile of newspapers lay. "Mr. Cornwall keeps a file of the _Times_ for 

reference; it will help us." He searched through the papers, and soon found the one he wanted. He 

smiled quietly as he looked down the columns. "It is as I suspected. The account of the robbery of 

the diamond bracelet was first published on the day preceding that upon which Miser Farebrother 

was murdered." They all started at this. And the young lawyer proceeded: "Let us build up a 

theory. Jeremiah Pamflett takes a diamond bracelet of great value to his master, and upon the 

strength of his representations Miser Farebrother advances a sum of money upon it--believing the 

stones to be genuine. On the day before his death a newspaper falls into his hands, and he learns 

from it that he has been tricked--that the bracelet has been stolen, and that the diamonds are 

false. We know that the one passion of his life is money--it is his

bare feet!"  Her giggle irritated Skinner.  "It may be very funny to you but--how much?  That's the 

question!"  "Not more than six dollars for the best."  "I see," said Skinner, making an effort to be 

calm.  "Silk hosiery?"  "A dollar will cover socks and garters both."  "Garters?" Skinner snapped. 

"Garters are a luxury.  Besides, I never had any success with garters.  Safety pins for mine."  "My 

Dearie a safety-pin man--in a dress suit--not much!"  "Thank goodness, I don't have to have a high 

hat!"  "If there's anything that's really funny," Honey observed, "it's the combination of a fine dress 

suit and a cheap hat.  Six dollars will cover that."  "That's a darned sight more than the hat'll cover 

if I don't stop spending money!  But why a hat, anyway?" he continued; "you don't wear it in the 

house.  That's the only time your dress suit shows.  When you're out of doors you wear it under an 

overcoat."  He paused abruptly.  "An overcoat!  Great Scott!  Have I got to have a new overcoat?" 

"You seem to _think_ you have, and, honestly, I agree with you.  It would never do, Dearie, to be 

fine at both ends and shabby in the middle."  Skinner grunted.  "An overcoat will cost forty dollars! 

Do you hear?--forty dollars!"  "I did n't say anything about an overcoat, Dearie.  It's your own 

suggestion."  "You did n't say anything about it--oh, no--you only said enough to cinch my 

suggestion!  Forty dollars," he repeated, "and a hat--six dollars more!  Well, by thunder, I 'll _get_ 

a hat!  Gee whiz!  What have you let me in for, anyway?"  "_I_ let you in for, Dearie?"  Honey's 

baby-blue eyes stared at him. "You let _yourself_ in for it when you got your raise."  Skinner said 

nothing for a moment, then burst out, "Say, I have n't got to get new underclothing, have I?  Now, 

don't you even admit that I have!  Don't you dare admit it!  People can't see my underclothes 

unless I take my coat off and turn up my shirt-sleeves or roll up my trousers as if I were going in 

wading."  "Of course, you have n't got to get new underclothes, Dearie.  But there's a psychology 

to it.  If you don't _feel_ well dressed, you won't _look_ well dressed.  You don't want to be a fraud, 

with a beautiful dress suit and cheap underneath--and my old Dearie's no fraud."  Skinner passed 

quickly over the remark.  "How much?"  "You can get the best for four dollars a garment."  "Gosh!" 

For a moment Skinner pondered; then abruptly, "Say I 'll be hanged if I don't buy new 

underclothes.  For the first time in my life, I 'll be well dressed all through--hide, hoofs, and horns!--

socks, drawers, undershirt, shoes, trousers, waistcoat, coat, hat, overcoat!  Is there anything 

else?" he shouted.  "Let me think."  "Yes, think hard!" Skinner retorted.  "Don't leave a stone 

unturned to make me the one, great, perfect tailor's model!"  "There are gloves and a monocle 

chain.  You can get them both for three dollars," Honey added sweetly, affecting not to notice 

Skinner's reproachful irony.  "A monocle chain?" Skinner shouted.  "What's that?  Something to 

lead me by?  Am I going to be a monkey?"  "Don't be silly, Dearie!"  Skinner laughed with deep 

disgust.  "Why be a 'piker,' Skinner?  You got your raise, did n't you?  Damn you, you got your 

raise!  Why be a 'piker'?"  "Piker?" Honey exclaimed.  "It'll be a regular debauch in clothes!" 

"Debauch!" Skinner cried.  "It'll be a riot!"  Honey clapped her hands delightedly.  "Is that all?  Are 

you through with me?  Are you finished with me absolutely?"  Honey nodded.  "You're not holding 

anything in reserve to spring on me?  If you've got anything to say, say it now while I 'm in my 

agony--you can't hurt me any more!"  "My love, you're the finished product!"  "Good!" Skinner 

paused; then with quiet, grim resolution: "Now, we'll begin on you!"  "Me?" Honey cried.  "Yes, 

you!  You don't suppose I 'm going to be the only one in this outfit to be decked out in gay attire? 

What would they think if they saw a resplendent individual like me and a shabby little wife?  It 

would be as bad as the man that went on his wedding trip alone because he was too darned mean 



or too darned poor to take his wife along!"  "But _me_!  I'm all right!"  "What have you got?" 

Skinner insisted grimly.  He had borne the gaff--now it was his turn to do some of the punishing, 

and he enjoyed it.  "What have you got?" he repeated.  "The beautiful pink dress I made over." 

"Get it," said Skinner.  Already his tone was taking on an unaccustomed authority, and Honey 

hastened to do as she was bid.  She got the pretty, home-made thing and laid it on the table.  "Put 

it on," Skinner ordered.  Honey got into the dress as quickly as her trembling fingers would permit. 

Skinner stood off and inspected her.  "That's a beautiful little dress for the house," he said finally, 

"but it does n't match this dress suit.  Incompatible is n't the in the afternoon, doubtless, after he 

made this discovery, he sent a telegram to Jeremiah Pamflett in London, requesting his manager's 

attendance at Parksides. Miser Farebrother was not in the habit of wasting money upon 

telegrams; hence his sending of this message was prompted by some particular motive--say the 

demand from Jeremiah Pamflett for the restitution of the money of which he has been defrauded. 

Before this scoundrel leaves London for Parksides he also has learnt that a trick has been played 

upon him by Captain Ablewhite and the woman who has tracked him down. At Parksides a stormy 

scene takes place between the miser and his scoundrel manager. The miser threatens criminal 

proceedings, but perhaps gives the scoundrel time to refund the money he has advanced. They 

part with feelings of bitter rage towards each other. What course is now open to Jeremiah 

Pamflett? Has he the money to refund? Unlikely. Can he borrow it? Quite as unlikely. I bear in 

mind what I gathered from you, Fred, respecting the bill for three hundred pounds which Mr. 

Lethbridge accepted. You arranged for the payment of that bill with a betting man, who had 

received it from Jeremiah Pamflett. Natural inference: that the scoundrel Jeremiah had been 

backing horses, and losing. If necessary, we will look that betting man up. Not seeing his way to 

refund the money which has been advanced on the bracelet, nothing but exposure and disgrace 

lies before Jeremiah Pamflett. How to avoid impending ruin? How to avoid a felon's fate? Miser 

Farebrother lives practically alone in the house at Parksides, waited upon by the house-keeper, 

Jeremiah's mother. These two are bound to each other by mutual interests. Who so likely to profit 

by Miser Farebrother's death as Jeremiah Pamflett? Unhappily, on that night Miss Farebrother 

goes down to Parksides on her heavenly mission of love. But, before she makes her appearance 

there, the murder of her father is resolved upon. There is no independent evidence that Jeremiah 

returned to London and reached his office by eleven o'clock. We have only his word for it. Had 

Miss Farebrother not visited Parksides on that night, suspicion would have fallen upon the 

Pamfletts, and the hour of the scoundrel's return to London would have been a vital point. I put 

aside the account given by Mrs. Pamflett of the visit of a strange man to Miser Farebrother. It may 

or may not be true. Equally it may or may not be a concocted story, invented beforehand for 

safety. Here comes in Tom Barley's evidence as to his seeing in the grounds a female in a blue 

dress. The honest fellow spoke the truth; he saw what he was compelled to swear to. Miss 

Farebrother wore such a dress. But why should she avoid him? He was her tried and faithful 

friend. Convinced as we are of her innocence, there is no reason for her avoidance. Here lies the 

mystery; if we can solve it Miss Farebrother is safe. And solve it we will----My God!"  They had 

listened to him in profound admiration. Entranced by his masterly analysis, it seemed to Fred as if 

they had only to go to the prison in which Phoebe was immured and demand her release. But 

when he uttered the words "My God!" and started to his feet and paced the room in a state of 



excitement, which, for a few moments was uncontrollable, their feelings of admiration changed to 

astonishment, and they gazed at him in amazement.  "What is it, Dick?" cried Fred. "What is it?" 

He seized Garden's hands, and would have held him still; but Garden threw him off, and continued 

to pace the room.  "Don't speak to me for a moment!" he cried. "What I have suddenly thought of 

is so wild that I cannot reveal it. But if it is a true inspiration, it means salvation! Ask me nothing, 

for I shall not answer you. It is for you to answer me. It has occurred to me that Mrs. Pamflett and 

Mrs. Lethbridge are about the same height and figure."  "Good God!" cried Fred. "What do you 

mean?"  "Answer my question, Fred," said Garden, "as you value Miss Farebrother's life. The 

women--one a devil, the other an angel--are about the same height and figure?"  "Yes, they are." 

"And from a short distance--say thirty or forty yards--might possibly be mistaken for each other?" 

"Yes, it is possible."  "Thank you." He had succeeded in mastering his agitation, and now to all 

appearance was calm. "Meanwhile," he said, sitting at the table and beginning to write, "what has 

become of the diamond bracelet?"  The question was uttered in a musing tone, as though he were 

asking it of himself. He continued to write for four or five minutes, and having completed his task, 

he read what he had written, folded the paper and put it in his pocket. Then he turned to Kiss and 

Mr. Linton.  "You have nothing more to say?"  "Nothing."  "You delight in dramatic surprises?" he 

said, addressing Linton, with a radiant look.  "If they are new to the

"Would n't this humble dress set off your clothes by contrast?" Honey said, affecting meekness, 

her sense of humor getting the uppermost.  "Yes, but these clothes of mine would also set off that 

humble dress by contrast, and that I won't have for a minute!  You're the beauty spot in this outfit, 

my dear," Skinner said tenderly, "not I.  I 'm not going to do the peacock act.  I'm the quiet, 

dignified "they are invaluable."  "I may supply you with one. It is just on the cards." He now 

addressed Kiss as well as Mr. Linton. "Our interview is at an end. What I wish you to do is to so 

arrange matters that we can at any moment lay hands upon Mrs. Pamflett, her son, and the 

woman who is implicated in the theft of the diamond bracelet. Do you think you can manage it?"  "I 

will answer for that."  "When you 


_
what I affect.  It rests with you to keep up the pulchritudinous end of it.  That's it!  You've got to 

dress up to _this_!"  He smiled fondly at the shrinking Honey.  Honey began to tremble.  Dearie 

had no idea of the cost of women's clothes!  "Look here," Skinner went on, resuming the 

imperative, "I got this dress suit at a first-class tailor's--you go to a first-class yourself for being the 

cause of an innocent girl being sentenced to death for a murder she did not commit. You went 

back, as it were, to first causes. It is likely--almost certain, indeed, so much depends upon chance-

-that if you had not come, the inspiration which may mean salvation would not have descended 

upon me. To you, therefore, if all ends as I fervently pray it may, 


_
patent leathers, you get evening shoes at a first-class bootmaker's. To correspond with my 

overcoat, you get an evening cloak.  Piece for piece, you must do just as I do.  We'll be a 

symphony in clothes!  Silk stockings, long gloves, silk underwear, and all the rest of it--that's what 

you're going to have!"  "But silk underwear?  No one can see it, Dearie," Honey protested. 

"There's a psychology to it, justice aright. Humanly administered, it is sometimes fallible."  "Mr. 

Garden," said Kiss, in a voice no less earnest than that of the young lawyer, "I have not the 

slightest idea of your meaning, but you have won my esteem, and I honour you with all my heart 

and soul."  "I thank you," said the young lawyer, with dignity and courtesy; "what you kindly accord 

to me is worth the winning. Good-night."  When Kiss
