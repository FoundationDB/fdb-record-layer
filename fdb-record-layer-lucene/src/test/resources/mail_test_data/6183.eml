PARIS.=E2=80=94ISABELLA QUEEN OF ENGLAND RETURNS TO         FRANCE.   At th=
e beginning of=20

this year, John of Montfort, duke of Brittany, died, and was succeeded by h=
is eldest son John,=20

married to a daughter of the king of France, and who had several brothers a=
nd sisters[22]. About=20

the same time, the emperor of Constantinople[23], who had made a long stay =
at Paris, at the=20

charges of the king which will exude at different points. It should be reme=
mbered that in normal=20

condition the lower lobes and posterior aspect of the lungs will apparently=
 be very much congested=20

as a result of gravity.  =3DNeck, Larynx, and =C5=92sophagus.=3D=E2=80=94Th=
row the head well backward, and=20

place a block beneath the neck. Make an incision from the chin to the upper=
 part of the sternum.=20

Dissect the soft parts away on each side from the larynx and thyroid body, =
then cut along the=20

internal surface of the lower jaw from the symphisis to its angle. Through =
this incision introduce the=20

fingers into the mouth, and grasp and draw down the tongue. By dividing the=
 posterior wall of the=20

pharynx and pulling downward these parts, the trachea and =C5=93sophagus ca=
n readily be removed=20

together, a ligature having been first placed around the lower portion of t=
he =C5=93sophagus. Open=20

thence he returned to his own country[24].  Many able ambassadors had, at v=
arious times, been=20

sent from France to England, and from England to France, chiefly to negotia=
te with the king of=20

England for the return of queen Isabella, daughter to the king of or strict=
ures. With an enterotome=20

open the larynx and trachea along their posterior wall. Observe if there is=
 any evidence of =C5=93dema=20

of the glottis, and note the condition of the mucous membrane. Remember tha=
t redness of the=20

larynx is very commonly the result of post-mortem changes and is also seen =
in bodies which have=20

been kept cold. Dissect off and=20


_
that had been settled upon her by the articles of marriage. The ambassadors=
 at length brought the=20

matter to a conclusion, and the queen was conducted to France by the lord T=
homas Percy,=20

constable of England, having with him many knights, esquires, ladies and da=
msels, to accompany=20

her.  She was escorted to the town of Leulinghem, between Boulogne and Cala=
is, and there=20

delivered to Waleran count of Saint Pol[25], governor of Picardy, with whom=
 were the bishop of=20

Chartres and the lord de Heugueville to receive her. The damsel of Montpens=

 as possible. The=20
