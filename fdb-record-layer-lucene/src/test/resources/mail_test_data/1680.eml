and agitated, and an uneasy sense of apprehension stole upon me.  We decide=
d on the=20

"Pescatore," a little out-of-the-way trattoria, down near the Molo Vecchio.=
  There, in a dingy salon,=20

frequented chiefly by seamen, and redolent of tobacco, we ordered our simpl=
e dinner.  Mat=20

scarcely swallowed a morsel; but, calling presently for a bottle of Sicilia=
n wine, drank eagerly.=20

"Well, Mat," I said, as the last dish was placed on the table, "what news h=
ave you?"  "Bad."  "I=20

guessed that from your face."  "Bad for you--bad for me.  Gianetta."  "What=
 of Gianetta?"  He=20

passed his hand nervously across his lips.  "Gianetta is false--worse than =
false," he said, in a=20

hoarse voice.  "She values an honest man's heart just as she values a flowe=
r for her hair--wears it=20

for a day, then throws it aside for ever.  She has cruelly wronged us both.=
"  "In what way?  Good=20

Heavens, speak out!"  "In the worst way that a woman can wrong those who lo=
ve her.  She has=20

sold herself to the Marchese Loredano."  The blood rushed to my head and fa=
ce in a burning=20

torrent.  I could scarcely see, and dared not trust myself to speak.  "I sa=
w her going towards the=20

cathedral," he went on, hurriedly.  "It was about three hours ago.  I thoug=
ht she might be going to=20

side, however, she=20

went straight to the back of the pulpit, where this man was waiting for her=
.  You remember him--an=20

old man who used to haunt the shop a month or two back.  Well, seeing how d=
eep in conversation=20

they were, and how they stood close under the pulpit with their backs towar=
ds the church, I fell into=20



a passion of anger and went straight up the aisle, intending to say or do s=
omething: I scarcely=20

knew what; but, at all events, to draw her arm through mine, and take her h=

within a few feet, however, and found only a big pillar between myself and =
them, I paused. They=20

could not see me, nor I them; but I could hear their voices distinctly, and=
--and I listened."  "Well,=20

and you heard--"  "The terms of a shameful bargain--beauty on the one side,=
 gold on the other; so=20

many thousand francs a year; a villa near Naples--Pah! it makes me sick to =
