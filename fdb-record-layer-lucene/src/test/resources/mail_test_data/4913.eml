 the governor in council, and _
dress, and yet she had a confident air. She took in the fine clothes of her=
 handsome young=20

hostess, and Ethel's very gracious air and the almost pitying tone of her v=
oice--and then with a=20

hard little smile, "My, what a change," said Fanny softly. Ethel frowned at=
 her tone. This might be=20

rather awkward.  "You mean this way of doing my hair?" she rejoined good-hu=
mouredly. "I was=20

hoping you would notice it."  "Does he?" asked Fanny.  "What do you mean? O=
h, Joe never--"=20

"No. Dwight, my dear." The hard voice of her visitor had become suddenly lo=
w and clear. Ethel=20

looked at the woman then and slowly reddened to her ears. And the conscious=
ness of blushing=20

made her all the angrier.  "What on earth do you mean!" she demanded. Her v=
oice too was very=20

low, and it trembled only a little; but there was a glint in her brown eyes=
. Fanny gave a tense little=20

laugh.  "Look here," she said. "Don't let's waste time. Joe may be coming h=
ome, you know, and we=20

must get this over first."  "We'll soon get it over." Ethel's voice was sha=
king ominously. Fanny=20

noticed and spoke fast.  "Well, then, it's just this," she said. "You've ma=
de up your mind to cut Joe=20

off from all his old friends, including me. And I might have stood for that=
--"  "How kind!"  "If I hadn't=20

learned of the raw deal you're giving him. Strip him of friends and then tr=
eat him like this? Oh, no,=20

not if I can help it!" Plainly Fanny was working herself into a rage to mat=
ch that of her hostess.=20

"You'd better be very clear, Mrs. Carr," Ethel exclaimed, leaning forward. =
Her visitor looked=20

straight back at her, and answered:  "Very. I mean Dwight."  Ethel rose abr=
uptly.  "That will be=20

enough, I think."  "Oh, will it?"  Ethel wheeled upon her:   "What a--loath=
some mind you have! Will=20

you leave me, please!"  "No, I'll show you this. And then we'll get to busi=
ness." And Fanny=20

produced a large envelope, from which she took out a few typewritten pages.=
 "Just look these=20

over," she advised, "and then tell me whether I shall go." And as Ethel hes=
itated, "You'd better.=20

They're very important."  Ethel took them and read them, and as she did so =
her rage and scorn=20

changed first into bewilderment and then into a sickening fright She felt a=
ll at once so off her=20

ground. She had always heard and Ireland (having power to grant such diplom=
a) entitling him to=20

practise medicine and surgery, and who shall produce such diploma and furni=
sh satisfactory=20

evidence of identification;  (_b_) any member of the College of Physicians =
and Surgeons of the=20

Provinces of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec upon producing satisfactory evide=
nce of the same=20

and of identification;  (_c_) any person who shall produce from any college=
 or school of medicine=20

and surgery in the Dominion of Canada requiring a four-years=E2=80=99 cours=
e of study _and_ (_sic_) a=20

diploma of qualification; provided he furnish to the council satisfactory e=
vidence of identification,=20

and pass if deemed necessary, before the members thereof, or such examiners=
 as may be=20

appointed for the purpose, a satisfactory examination touching his fitness =
and capacity to practise=20

as a physician and surgeon, upon payment to the registrar of fifty dollars =
(_ib._, s. 34, as=20

substituted by Ord. 14, 1890, amended by Ord. 9, 1891-92).  POWERS OF COUNC=
IL.=E2=80=94The=20

members of the council are required to make orders, regulations, or by-laws=
 for the regulation of=20

the register and the guidance of examiners, and may prescribe subjects and =
modes of=20

examination, and may make all regulations in respect of examinations, not c=
ontrary to the=20

ordinance, that they may deem expedient and necessary (_ib._, s. 36).  The =
council may by by-law=20

delegate to the registrar power to admit to practice and to register any pe=
rson having the=20

necessary qualifications entitling him to be registered by the council (Ord=
. 24, 1892, s. 4).  The=20

council may direct the name of any person improperly registered to be erase=
d from the register=20

and such name shall be erased by the registrar (Ord. 24, 1892, s. 5).  FORF=
EITURE OF=20



RIGHTS.=E2=80=94If a medical practitioner be convicted of any felony or mis=
demeanor or after due inquiry=20

be judged by the council to have been guilty of infamous conduct in any pro=
fessional respect, the=20

council may, if it sees fit, direct the registrar to erase the name of such=
 practitioner from the=20

register, and the name shall be erased (Ord. 5, 1888, s. 37, as substituted=
 by Ord. 24, 1892, s. 1).=20

and their reports of shadowed wives, but that sort of thing had just been i=
n the papers and had=20

never seemed very real. "This is about me!" she thought. It told of every m=
eeting she had had with=20

Dwight, in his studio and in other places, once at the Ritz where they had =
dined and gone to the=20

opera, twice in the Park where they had walked. Such clean times, all three=
 of them, but how=20

cheap and disgusting they now appeared! For here were bits about Dwight's p=
ast, his record with=20

women--two were named. He had been a co-respondent once! And his studio was=
 described in=20

detail, with emphasis on a big lounge in one corner! . . . Suddenly it was =
laughable! And so she=20

laughed at Fanny! And Fanny replied:  "You mean he won't believe it!"  Ethe=
l went on laughing.=20

Joe wouldn't believe it. She wished he would come and turn this woman out o=
n the street. She felt=20

relief unspeakable.  "You've forgotten," Fanny added, "that you lied to him=
 about your friend."=20

"How dare you say that?"  "Because I have the facts. On the second of Decem=
ber Joe brought=20

Dwight to dine with you, and you acted as though you'd never met. I gathere=
d that from Joe=20

himself when I saw him the next day. While the truth of it was you'd been s=
eeing Dwight ever since=20

the first of October."  "Yes? That will be easy enough to explain." But Eth=
el felt herself turning=20

white. She sank down and thought, "Now you'll need all your nerve. Don't ge=
t faint, you've got to=20

think clearly." But she was not given time.  "And all that had been going o=
n while you were=20

supposed to be home with the baby." Mrs. Carr leaned forward briskly. "Now =
the thing for you to=20

do is exactly what I tell you. But before I do that, there's just one thing=
 I wish you to understand=20

about me. If you want to keep midwifery, or any one of them, as the case ma=
y be, and to demand=20

and recover with costs his reasonable charges for professional aid, advice,=
 and visits, and the cost=20

of medical or surgical appliances rendered or supplied by him to his patien=

LIMITATION.=E2=80=94A period of one year after the term of professional ser=
vice is established as a=20

limitation to actions for negligence or malpractice against members of the =
college (_ib._, s. 39).=20

REGISTER, EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94The registrar, under the direction of the counc=
il, is required to publish a=20

register of the names and residences and the medical titles, diplomas, and =
qualifications conferred=20

by any college or body, of all persons appearing on the register on the day=
 of publication. The=20

register is called =E2=80=9CNorthwest Territories=E2=80=99 Medical Register=
,=E2=80=9D and a copy for the time being,=20

purporting to be so printed and published, is _prima facie_ evidence that t=
he persons therein=20

specified are registered according to the act. The absence of a name from s=
uch copy is _prima=20

facie_ evidence that such person is not so registered.  In case a person=E2=
=80=99s name does not appear=20

on such copy, a certified copy under the hand of the registrar of the entry=
 of the name of such=20

person on the register is evidence that such person is registered (_ib._, s=
. 40).  NEGLECT TO=20

REGISTER.=E2=80=94A person neglecting to register is not entitled to the ri=
ghts or privileges conferred=20

and is liable to all penalties against unqualified or unregistered practiti=
oners (_ib._, s. 4).=20

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES.=E2=80=94To practise or profess to practise without =
registration, for hire or=20

reward, is punishable with a penalty of $100 (_ib._, s. 42).  To wilfully o=

physician, doctor of medicine, surgeon, or general=20


_
him. I don't want him--I never did. I've laughed at you again and again for=
 what you thought I was=20

trying to do. All I want is to be let alone to go on with Joe as I always h=
ave. What I mean by that=20

you won't understand, because you don't understand my life. A woman like me=
 in this city needs=20

one man who'll be her friend--the big brother idea--to help and advise her,=
 carry her through when=20

she's down a bit. And Joe has always been like that.  "Why? Because of Amy.=
 When she first=20

came to New York, you remember, it was on a visit to me. I had known her ba=
ck in boarding=20

school. Well, the visit lengthened out. I saw how crazy she was for the tow=
n, and I was fairly well=20

off then, so I let her stay and gave her a home--let her meet my friends, J=
oe included. I had a=20

husband at the time who was in the real estate business. He knew Joe. So I =
took Joe and handed=20

him over to Amy. And though she would have been glad enough to forget the d=
ebt, Joe wasn't that=20

kind. So that's my hold on him--perfectly clean and above-board. And I need=
 him in my business.=20

There are times when I'm down and need his money, other times when I need h=
is name. But that=20

is all. And if he has been fool enough to marry a giddy young girl like you=
, that's his own look-out--I=20

won't interfere. I mean I won't interfere with you so long as you don't int=
erfere with me. You let me=20

o lead people to infer=20

punishable with a penalty of from $25 to $100 (_ib._, s. 44).  UNREGISTERED=
 PERSONS.=E2=80=94No=20

l crumpled them up in=20

her hands.  "Don't be a fool," said Fanny. "They're only copies. Give them =
back." Ethel did so,=20

mechanically. "Now what will you do? Which way will you have it? He may be =
here any minute=20

now."  She waited, but got no reply. She saw the girl shiver a little.  "Wh=
at's the use of being so=20

solemn and scared?" she impatiently asked. "You're running no more risk tha=
n before. So far as=20

I'm concerned, my dear, you can go right on with Dwight if you wish. All I'=
m asking is a square=20

deal."  "But she'll ask and ask," thought Ethel. "She'll ask of me anything=
 she wants. And she'll get=20

me so tangled in other lies that then I wouldn't have even a chance of maki=
ng Joe see how things=20

really are."  This thought cleared her mind a little.  "No," she said. "You=
 can tell him."  "What!"=20

Ethel looked down certified under the hand of the registrar, for the time b=
eing is sufficient evidence=20

of all persons [registered]; a certificate on such copy purporting to be si=
gned by any person in the=20

capacity of registrar of the council under this ordinance is _prima facie_ =
evidence that he is=20
