sky-screamer, was talking with his pal, Stew Sherman, radio gunner.  "The C=

 "That would be=20

something!"  A moment more of vast, black silence, and he was excusing hims=
elf to go down the=20

ladder to join his buddies.  "Got to turn in, sir," he explained.  "That's =
right," the Commander=20

agreed. "Tomorrow may be a great day for us all. You never know."=20

CHAPTER II                                 CONTACT   On the flight deck Jac=
k joined a group of his fighting=20

pals. Sprawled about the deck, they were still discussing the mysterious so=
mething that had gone=20

screaming over their heads.  "It's a Jap trick," said Dave Dunn, a torpedo =
bomber pilot. "I tell you=20

they're closer than you think!"  "They didn't have to be too close at that,=
" Jack broke in. "I was on=20

the Commander's bridge when the thing went over."  "Oh, ho! Listen to Jacki=
e!" Kentucky, a fighter=20

pilot, exclaimed. "Been hobnobbin' with the Commander!"  "Shut up, Ken!" Re=
d Sands, another=20

fighter pilot, gave him a push. "What does the Commander think about it, Ja=
ck?"  "It's a sign.=20

That's what it is!" a bombardier exclaimed. "Sign of trouble ahead!"  "The =
Commander thinks just=20

what we all think." Jack gave a low chuckle as he dropped to the deck. "Mig=
ht be just anything--a=20

meteor, a Jap nuisance trick--just anything!"  "Nuisance trick! Say! surgeo=
n=E2=80=99s words. Perhaps the=20

only advice which can be offered here is to qualify between injuries direct=
ly dangerous to life and=20

those in which life is endangered merely by possible complications, such as=
 sepsis, gangrene, etc.=20

Still, aside from wounds which are either fatal or may be nearly completely=
 recovered from, there=20

is another quite large class of those causing grievous bodily harm in which=
 it is a question for the=20

jury always to decide what was the intent of the accused. A medical witness=
 may thus in such a=20

case be of great assistance to the court by giving an account of the injury=
 devoid of technicalities,=20

and of its possible consequences. It should also always be stated, if known=
, whether the patient=20

was under the influence of liquor or any narcotic at the moment of injury. =
 In the examination of=20

wounds either of the living or dead body, it should always be determined fo=

purposes whether there is about them fluid or coagulated blood or ecchymosi=
s, that is, livid=20

discoloration of the skin from effused blood. The color of the ecchymotic s=
pot will give a valuable=20

clew as to the time between the infliction of the wound and death. Putrefac=

must not be mistaken for gangrene. In giving reports on such cases care sho=
