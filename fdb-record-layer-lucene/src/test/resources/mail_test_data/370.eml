 requires a light, loamy soil, worked into as fine a condition as possible,=
 to render cultivation easy.  The greater part of the preparation should be=
 done in the fall, and especially the application of the manure. Well rotte=

s, should always be selected. Of course, if the manure is properly were bur=
ied in consequence of it, and strong fears are entertained by the inhabitan=

the present landing-place.  These facts, I think you will say, furnish sati=

same character belongs to the whole extent south of the Dividing Ridge. Thi=
