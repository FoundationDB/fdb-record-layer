philodendron monstera which was south of Northfield."  "On Thursday morning=
, September 7, we all came together on the Cannon river, on the outskirts o=
f Northfield. That afternoon I took a look at the bank, and in camp at dinn=

"Chadwell, Pitts, Bob and myself procured horses at St. Peter, where we sta=
yed long enough to=20

break them and to train them for the hard riding to which we knew they woul=
d be submitted later=20

on. It was at St. Peter that I made the acquaintance of a little girl who a=
fterwards was one of the=20

most earnest workers for our parole."  "A little tot then, she said she cou=
ld ride a horse, too, and=20

reaching down, I lifted her up before me, and we rode up and down. I asked =
her her name and she=20

said it was 'Horace Greeley Perry,' and I replied:"  " 'No wonder you're su=
ch a little tot with such a=20

great name.' "  " 'I won't always be little,' she replied. 'I'm going to be=
 a great big girl and be a=20

newspaper man like papa.' "  "Will you still be my sweetheart then, and be =
my friend?" I asked her,=20

and she declared she would, a promise I was to remind her of years later un=
der circumstances of=20

which I did not dream then.  "Many years afterward with a party of visitors=
 to the prison came a=20

girl, perhaps 16, who registered in full, 'Horace Greeley Perry.' "  "I kne=
w there could not be two=20

women with such a name in the world, and I reminded her of her promise, a p=
romise which she did=20

not remember, although she had been told how she had made friends with the =
bold, bad man who=20

afterwards robbed the bank at Northfield."  "Very soon afterward, at the ag=
e of 18, I believe, she=20

became, as she had dreamed, in childhood, 'a newspaper man', editing the St=
. Peter Journal, and=20

to the hour of my pardon she was one of the most indefatigable workers for =
us."  "A few years ago=20

failing health compelled her removal from Minnesota to Idaho, and Minnesota=
 lost one of the=20

brightest newspaper writers and staunchest friends that a man ever knew. Ji=
m and I had a host of=20

advocates during the latter years of our imprisonment, but none exceeded in=
 devotion the young=20

woman, who as a little tot, had ridden unknowingly with the bandit who Rais=
ins of the Sun split, to=20

lie in the Liquor till we draw it off, which should not be till the Wine is=
 fine, which you will find about=20

_January_. This Wine is so like the fine rich Wine brought from _Cyprus_, i=
n its Colour and=20

Flavour, that it has deceiv'd the best Judges, These Berries are ripe in _A=
ugust_, and may be had=20

at the Ivy-House at _Hoxton_.    To make _Wine_ of _Black Elder-berries,_ w=
hich is equal to the=20

best _Hermitage_ Claret; from _Henry Marsh,_ Esq. _of Hammersmith._  Take n=
ine Gallons of=20

Spring Water, and half a Bushel of Elder-berries, pick'd clean from the Sta=
lks; boil these till the=20

Berries begin to dimple, then gently strain off the Liquor, and to every Ga=
llon of it put two Pounds=20

of good _Lisbon_ Sugar, and boil it an Hour; then let it stand to cool, in =
an open Tub, for if it was to=20

cool in the Copper, or Brass Kettle, it was boil'd in, the Liquor would be =
ill-tasted. When it is almost=20

cool, spread some Ale-Yeast upon a Toast of White Bread, and put it into th=
e Liquor, to work three=20

Days in the open Tub, stirring the Liquor once or twice a Day, and then tun=
 it in a Vessel of a right=20

size, to hold it: At the same time add to every Gallon one pound of Raisins=
 of the Sun whole, and=20

let them lie in the Cask till the Wine is drawn off.  Such a small quantity=
 of Wine, as is here=20

directed, will be fit to bottle the _January_ next after it is made, but la=
rger Casks should not be=20

drawn off till _March_ or _April_.    A Receipt from _Barbadoes,_ to make _=
Rum;_ which proves=20

very good.  In _Barbadoes_ the Rum is made of the Scum and Offal of the Sug=
ar, of which they=20

put one ninth part, or eighth part, to common Water, about eighteen Gallons=
, all together, in a=20

wooden open Vessel or Tub; cover this with dry Leaves of Palm, or for want =
of them, with the=20

Leaves of _Platanus_ or the Leaves of Fern in _England_, or the Parts or Le=
aves which Flagg-

Brooms are made of. Let this remain for nine Days, till it changes of a cle=
an yellow Colour, and it=20

will be then fit to distil; then=20

"Preliminary work on the Northfield robbery was got down to during the last=
 week of August 1876,=20

and while Pitts and I were waiting for Bob and Chadwell, who had gone up th=
ere to look over the=20

ground, we scouted all over the country thereabouts and around Madelia in o=
rder to get ourselves=20

familiar with the lay of the land. When the two boys joined us we divided i=
nto two parties and=20

started for Northfield along different routes."  "On Monday night, Septembe=
r 4, the party I was with=20

reached Le Sueur Center, where we had trouble finding places to sleep, as c=
ourt was in session.=20

Tuesday night we put in at Cordova, and Wednesday we were in Millersburg. A=
t the same time=20

Bob and his crowd rounded up in you will have what we call the Low-Wines. A=
 Day or two after=20

distil it again, and in the Cap of the Still, hang a small muslin Bag of sw=
eet Fennel-Seeds, and the=20

Spirit will be of a fine Flavour. Some will use Anniseed in the Bag, and so=
me use a little Musk with=20

the sweet Fennel Seeds, or else distil the Spirit twice, _viz._, once with =
the sweet Fennel-Seeds,=20

and the next with a little Musk.  _N.B._ The wooden Vessels, or open Tubs, =
must not be made of=20

any Wood that is unwholesome, or sweet-scented; such as Deal, Firr, or Manc=
hineel.  In=20

livelihood; as appears by the several Ways mention'd above, that have been=
