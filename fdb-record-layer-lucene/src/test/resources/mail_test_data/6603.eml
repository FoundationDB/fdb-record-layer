governor and archbishop; demands that Arrechedera hand over the government =

questions of etiquette;  We were all much pleased at a piece of intelligenc=

Cleveland Bay, and=20

intended coming up in a small steamer to the south end of Hinchinbrook, to =
assist in the search for=20

the missing crew.  As it would be of the utmost importance that both partie=

sent my boat down to the mouth of the channel, with a note to the leader of=
 the expedition=20

announcing our intention of landing on the north end of the island and work=

and requesting them to scour their end, and then push northward, when we sh=

risk of being tedious, I must explain to the reader some of the peculiariti=
es of Hinchinbrook Island.=20

Its length is a little short of forty miles, and its shape a rude triangle,=
 the apex of which is at the=20

south, and the north side forming the southern portion of Rockingham Bay. N=
ow this north side is=20

by no means straight, but is curved out into two or three bays of considera=
ble extent, and in one of=20

them stand two islands named Gould and Garden Islands.  The latter of these=
 was our favourite=20

resort for picnics, for the dense foliage afforded good shade, and, when th=
e tide was low, we were=20

enabled to gather most delicious oysters from some detached rocks.  Gould I=
sland is considerably=20

larger; but, rising in a pyramid from the sea, and being covered with loose=
 boulders, it was most=20

tedious climbing.  From the township we could, with our glasses, see canoes=

preaches rigorously against all the vices for nine days; adorns cathedral; =
presides over council by=20

which bishop of Nueva Cceres exiled to his bishopric; makes most vigorous a=
ttempts to enforce=20

episcopal visit of regular parish priests of any archbishop in history of t=
he Philippines; bases his=20

action on the bull Firmandis of Benedict XIV, dated Nov. 6, 1744, and the b=
ull repassing between=20

these two islands; and as the 'Daylight' had a particularly heavy cargo thi=
s trip, and would not be=20

clear for the next two days, we made up our minds to search the islands, an=
d drive the blacks on=20

to Hinchinbrook, so that one of our parties must stumble across them when w=
e swept it.  This may=20

seem to the reader unnecessary trouble, but most of our party were conversa=

the blacks and their limited method of reasoning; and we=20

which were confirmed at the instance of the king by the bull Nunc nuper, of=
 Nov. 8, 1751; in 1768,=20

visits all the curacies held by the Dominicans; all the other orders resist=
; although the governor=20

commands the orders to submit to the visit, and strives to uphold the royal=
 patronage, the orders=20

disregard him; many parishes provided with native secular priests by the ar=
chbishop in 1768,=20

at the Herbert River=20

gins would have at once acquainted the Hinchinbrook blacks with our uncerem=

warned them that we should probably soon look them up also.  Now on the rec=
eipt of this=20

unwelcome intelligence, the first thing that would strike the blacks would =
be the facilities for=20

concealment afforded by Gould or Garden Islands, more particularly had they=
 any captives; and=20
