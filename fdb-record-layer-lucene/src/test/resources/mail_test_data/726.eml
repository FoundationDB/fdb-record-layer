Spirit, have each the power of action on one of the manifested planes of ex=
istence--the gradual=20

differentiations from the one unmanifested plane--on that plane namely to w=
hich it properly=20

belongs. Our earth affording every Mayavic condition, it follows that the p=
urified Egotistical=20

Principle, the astral and personal Self of an Adept, though forming in real=
ity one integral whole=20

with its Highest Self (Atma and Buddhi) his master, grumbling.  "Go on, go =
on," said he, between=20

his teeth, "expend your ardor the first day; to-morrow, instead of journeyi=
ng twenty leagues, you=20

will travel ten, the day after to-morrow, five, and in three days you will =
be in bed. There you must=20

rest; young people are such braggarts."  It was easy to see that Olivain ha=
d not been taught in the=20

school of the Planchets and the Grimauds. Raoul really felt=20


_
for purposes of universal mercy and benevolence, so separate itself from it=
s divine Monad as to=20

lead on this plane of illusion and temporary being a distinct independent c=
onscious life of its own=20

under a borrowed illusive shape, thus serving at one and the same time a do=
uble purpose: the=20

exhaustion of its own individual Karma, and the saving of millions of human=
 beings less favoured=20

than itself from the effects of mental blindness. If asked: "When the chang=
e described as the=20

passage of a Buddha or a Jivanmukta into Nirvana takes place, where does th=
e original=20

consciousness which animated the body continue to reside--in the Nirvani or=
 in the subsequent=20

reincarnations of the latter's 'remains' (the Nirmanakaya)?" the answer is =
that _imprisoned_=20

consciousness may be a "certain knowledge from observation and experience,"=
 as Gibbon puts it,=20

but _disembodied_ consciousness is not an effect, but a cause. It is a part=
 of the whole, or rather a=20

Ray on the graduated scale of its manifested activity, of the one all-perva=
ding, limitless Flame, the=20

reflections of which alone can differentiate; and, as such, consciousness i=
s ubiquitous, and can be=20

neither localized nor centred on or in any particular subject, nor can it b=
e limited. Its effects alone=20

pertain to the region of matter, for thought is an energy that affects matt=
er in various ways, but=20

consciousness _per se_, as understood and explained by Occult philosophy, i=
s the highest quality=20

of the sentient spiritual principle in us, the Divine Soul (or Buddhi) and =
our Higher Ego, and does=20

not belong to the plane of materiality. After the death of the physical man=
, if he be an Initiate, it=20

becomes transformed from a human quality into the independent principle its=
elf; the conscious=20

Ego becoming Consciousness _per se_ without any Ego, in the sense that the =
latter can no longer=20

be limited or conditioned by the senses, or even by space or time. Therefor=
e it is capable, without=20

separating itself from or abandoning its possessor, Buddhi, of reflecting i=
tself at the same time in=20

its astral man that was, without being under any necessity for localizing i=
tself. This is shown at a=20

far lower stage in our dreams. For if consciousness can display activity du=
ring our visions, and=20

while the body and its material brain are fast asleep--and if even during t=
hose visions it is all but=20

ubiquitous--how much greater must be its power when entirely free from, and=
 having no more=20

connection with, our physical brain.      SECTION of testing his strength, =
and, brought up in the=20

principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times =
of stages of twenty-

five leagues, he did not wish to fall far short of his model. D'Artagnan, t=
hat man of iron, who=20

seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only, had struck him with admiration.=
 Therefore, in spite=20

of Olivain's remarks, he continued to urge his steed more and more, and fol=
lowing a pleasant little=20

path, leading to a ferry, and which he had been assured shortened the journ=
ey by the distance of=20

one league, he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flow=
ing before him. A little=20

troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream, ready to =
embark. Raoul did=20

not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort; he called out to him, but =
they were too distant to=20

be heard; then, in spite of the weariness of his beast, he made it gallop b=
ut the rising ground soon=20

deprived him of all sight of the travelers, and when he had again attained =
a new height, the=20

ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank. Raoul, s=
eeing that he could not=20

arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers, halted to wait for Ol=
ivain. At this moment a shriek=20

was heard that seemed to come from the river. Raoul turned toward the side =
whence the cry had=20

sounded, and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his han=
d.  "Olivain!" he=20

exclaimed, "what do I see below there?"  A second scream, more piercing tha=
n the first, now=20

sounded.  "Oh, sir!" cried Olivain, "the rope which holds the ferryboat has=
 broken and the boat is=20



drifting. But what do I see in the water--something struggling?"  "Oh, yes,=
" exclaimed Raoul, fixing=20

his glance on one point in the stream, splendidly illumined by the setting =
sun, "a horse, a rider!"=20

"They are sinking!" cried Olivain in his turn.  It was true, and Raoul was =
convinced that some=20

accident had happened and that a man was drowning; he gave his horse its he=
ad, struck his spurs=20

into its sides, and the animal, urged by pain and feeling that he had space=
 open before him,=20

bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place, and fell in=
to the river, scattering to=20

a distance waves of white froth.  "Ah, sir!" cried Olivain, "what are you d=
oing? Good God!"  Raoul=20

was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger. This was, in fact=
, a custom familiar to=20

him. Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire, he might have been s=
aid to have been=20

cradled=20


_
Now the mystery of Buddha lies in this: Gautama, an incarnation of pure Wis=
dom, had yet to learn=20

in His human body and to be initiated into the world's secrets like any oth=
er mortal, until the day=20

when He emerged from His secret recess in the Himalayas and preached for th=
e first time in the=20

grove of Benares. The same with Jesus: from the age of twelve to thirty yea=
rs, when He is found=20

preaching the Sermon on the Mount, nothing is positively said or known of H=
im. Gautama had=20

sworn inviolable secrecy as to the Esoteric Doctrines imparted to Him. In H=
is immense pity for the=20

ignorance--and as its consequence the sufferings--of mankind, desirous thou=
gh He was to keep=20

inviolate His sacred vows, He failed to keep within the prescribed limits. =
While constructing His=20

Esoteric Philosophy (the "Eye-Doctrine") on the foundations of eternal Trut=
h, He failed to conceal=20

certain dogmas, and trespassing beyond the lawful lines, caused those dogma=
s to be=20

misunderstood. In His anxiety to make away with the false Gods, He revealed=
 in the "Seven Paths=20

to Nirvana" some of the mysteries of the Seven Lights of the Arupa (formles=
s) World. A little of the=20

truth is often worse waves; a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback,=
 a thousand times had=20

swum across. Athos, foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of =
the viscount, had=20

inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings.  "Oh, heavens!" continued =
Olivain, in despair,=20

"what would the count say if he only saw you now!"  "The count would do as =
I do," replied Raoul,=20

urging his horse vigorously forward.  "But I--but I," cried Olivain, pale a=
nd disconsolate rushing=20

about on the shore, "how shall I cross?"  "Leap, coward!" cried Raoul, swim=
ming on; then=20

addressing the traveler, who was struggling twenty yards in front of him: "=
Courage, sir!" said he,=20

"courage! we are coming to your aid."  Olivain advanced, retired, then made=
 his horse rear--turned=20

it and then, struck to the core by shame, leaped, as Raoul had done, only r=
epeating:  "I am a dead=20

man! we are lost!"  In the meantime, the ferryboat had floated away, carrie=
d down by the stream,=20

and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more. A man w=
ith gray hair had=20

thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously tow=
ard the person who=20

was drowning; but being obliged to go=20


_
Truth and fiction are like oil and water: they will never mix.   His new do=
ctrine, which represented=20

the outward dead body of the Esoteric Teaching without its vivifying Soul, =
had disastrous effects: it=20

was never correctly understood, and the doctrine itself was rejected by the=
 Southern Buddhists.=20

Immense philanthropy, a boundless love and charity for all creatures, were =
Raoul continued his=20

way and was visibly gaining ground; but the horse and its rider, of whom he=
 did not lose sight,=20

were evidently sinking. The nostrils of the horse were no longer above wate=
r, and the rider, who=20

had lost the reins in struggling, fell with his head back and his arms exte=
nded. One moment longer=20

and all would disappear.  "Courage!" cried Raoul, "courage!"  "Too=20


_
little heeds intentions, whether good or bad, if they remain fruitless. If =
the "Good Law" as preached=20

resulted in the most sublime code of ethics and the unparalleled philosophy=
 of things external in=20

the visible Kosmos, it biassed and misguided immature minds into believing =
there was nothing=20

more under the outward mantle of the system, and its dead-letter only was a=
ccepted. Moreover,=20

the new teaching unsettled many great minds which had previously followed t=
he orthodox=20

Brahmanical lead.  Thus, fifty odd years after his death "the great Teacher=
"(662) having refused=20

full Dharmakaya and Nirvana, was pleased, for purposes of Karma and philant=
hropy, to  The water=20

closed above his head and stifled his voice.  Raoul sprang from his horse, =
to which he left the=20

charge of its own preservation, and in three or four strokes was at the gen=
tleman's side; he seized=20

the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water; the animal b=
egan to breathe again=20

and, as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid, redoubled his eff=
orts. Raoul at the=20

same time seized one of the young man's hands and placed it on the mane, wh=
ich it grasped with=20

the tenacity of a drowning man. Thus, sure that the rider would not release=
 his hold, Raoul now=20

only directed his attention to the horse, which he guided to the=20
