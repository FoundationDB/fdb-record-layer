neglected Guest Room (for such I used to call it) done over before the arri=
val of Susie....  I rode=20

over to the Teetzels' this afternoon, to explain about our cattle getting t=
hrough on their land. It was=20

the road-workers who broke down the Teetzel fence, to squat on a coulee-cor=
ner for their camp.=20

And they hadn't the decency to restore what they had wrecked. So Bud Teetze=
l and I rode seven=20

miles up the new turn-pike and overtook those road-workers and I harangued =
their foreman for a=20

full fifteen minutes. But it made little impression on him. He merely grinn=
ed and stared at me with a=20

sort of insolent admiration on his face. And when I had finished he audibly=
 remarked to one of his=20

teamsters that I made a fine figure of a woman on horseback.  Bud says they=
're thinking of selling=20

out if they can get their price. The old folks want to move to Victoria, an=
d Bud and his brother have=20

a hankering to try their luck up in the Peace River District. I asked Bud i=
f he wouldn't rather settle=20

down in one of the big cities. He merely laughed at me. "No thank you, lady=
! This old prair-ee is=20

comp'ny enough for me!" he said as he found, in its place. But it may be do=
ubted whether William=20

of Durham, if he were alive, would do the same.  Marcus Aurelius, Alfred an=
d St. Louis, are the=20

three examples of perfect virtue on a throne. But the virtue of St. Louis i=
s deeply tainted with=20

asceticism; and with the sublimated selfishness on which asceticism is foun=
ded, he sacrifices=20

everything and everybody--sacrifices national interests, sacrifices the liv=
es of the thousands of his=20

subjects whom he drags with him in his chimerical crusades--to the good of =
his own soul. The=20

Reflections of Marcus Aurelius will be read with ever increasing admiration=
 by all who have=20

learned to study character, and to read it in its connection with history. =
Alone in every sense,=20

without guidance or support but that which he found in his own breast, the =
imperial Stoic struggled=20

serenely, though hopelessly, against the powers of evil which were dragging=
 heathen Rome to her=20

inevitable doom. Alfred was a Christian hero, and in his Christianity he fo=
und the force which bore=20

him, through calamity apparently hopeless, to victory and happiness.  It mu=
st be owned that the=20

materials=20


_
trail as tawny as a lion's mane, with a sky of steel-cold blue smiling down=
 on his lopsided old=20

sombrero. I studied him with a less impersonal eye. He was a handsome and h=
usky young giant,=20

with the joy of life still frankly imprinted on his face.  "Bud," I said as=
 I loped along beside him, "why=20

haven't you ever married?"  That made him laugh again. Then he turned russe=
t as he showed me=20

the white of an eye.  "All the peaches seemed picked, in this district," he=
 found the courage to=20

proclaim.  This made me trot out are not very good. His biography by Bishop=
 Asser, his counsellor=20

and friend, which forms the principal authority, is panegyrical and uncriti=
cal, not to mention that a=20

doubt rests on the authenticity of some portions of it. But in the general =
picture there are a=20

consistency and a sobriety, which, combined with its peculiarity, commend i=
t to us as historical.=20

The leading acts of Alfred's life are, of course, beyond doubt. And as to h=
is character, he speaks=20

to us himself in his works, and the sentiments which he=20


_
being as good as any ever caught--and there really ought to be an excise ta=
x on platitudes, for=20

being addicted to them is quite as bad as being addicted to alcohol, and qu=
ite as benumbing to the=20

brain.  But Bud, with his next speech, brought me up physiognomy of the por=
trait.  We have called=20

him a Christian hero. He was the victorious champion of Christianity agains=
t Paganism. This is the=20

real significance of the struggle and of his character. The Northmen, or, a=
s we loosely term them,=20

the Danes,=20
