say even to me--" he stopped short, and then went on with better self-contr=
ol: "Let's keep the=20

peace if we can, dad."  "Oh, I reckon we can do that," was the good-natured=
 rejoinder. "Being on=20

the railroad side, yourself, you can't help feeling sort of hostile at the =
rest of us, I reckon."  Blount=20

put his knife and fork down and straightened himself in his chair.  "There =
it is again, you see. We=20

can't get together even on a question of admitted fact! Do you suppose for =

r explained. "It means=20

luncheon, and is used by English people in India."  "Dinner a dollar and a =
half. The rooms are at=20

different prices. For the second-class fare the prices are just half as muc=
h as the first."  "There are=20

a couple of the waiters," said Mrs. Woolridge. "They are nice-looking men, =
not very black."  "They=20

come from India, and make better servants than Arabs," added the guide.  "H=

 "You are likely to see=20

a good many of them in the course of the next month or two,"=20


_
you?" he commented.  "I have, and I wish that were the worst of it, but it =
isn't, dad. There's a thing=20

behind the alliance that cuts deeper than anything else I've had to face." =
 Once more the deep-set=20

eyes looked out from their bushy penthouses. "Reckon you could give it a na=
me, son?"  "Yes;=20

when you found that I wasn't going to let you run me for the attorney-gener=
alship, you arranged=20

with Mr. McVickar to have me put on the railroad pay-roll. Isn't that the f=
act?"  "Not exactly," said=20

the senator, and a grim smile went with the qualified denial. "It was sort =
