 to the open doors of=20

Freeman, John Newton Templeton, Mary E. Miles, Lucy Stratton, Lewis Woodson=
, John F. Cook,=20

Mary Ann Shadd, W.H. Allen, and B.W. Arnett. Professor C.L. Reason, a veter=
an teacher of New=20

York City, was then so well educated that in 1844 he was called to the prof=
essorship of Belles-

Lettres and the French Language in New York Central College. Many intellige=
nt Negroes who=20

followed other occupations had teaching for their avocation. In fact almost=
 every colored person=20

who could read and write was a missionary teacher among his people.  [Footn=
ote 1: James B.=20

Russworm, an alumnus of Bowdoin, was the first Negro to receive a degree fr=
om a college in this=20

country.]  In music, literature, and journalism the Negroes were also doing=
 well. Eliza Greenfield,=20

William Jackson, John G. Anderson, and William Appo made their way in the m=
usical world.=20

Lemuel Haynes, a successful preacher to a white congregation, took up theol=
ogy about 1815. Paul=20

Cuffee wrote an interesting account of Sierra Leone. Rev. Daniel Coker publ=
ished a book on=20

slavery in 1810. Seven years later came the publication of the _Law and Doc=
trine of the African=20

Methodist Episcopal Church_ and the _Standard Hymnal_ written by Richard Al=
len. In 1836 Rev.=20

George Hogarth published an addition to this volume and in 1841 brought for=
ward the first=20

magazine of the sect. Edward W. Moore, a colored teacher of white children =
in Tennessee, wrote=20

an arithmetic. C.L. Remond of Massachusetts was then a successful lecturer =
and controversialist.=20

James M. Whitefield, George Horton, and Frances E.W. Harper were publishing=
 poems. H.H.=20

Garnett and J.C. Pennington, known to fame as preachers, attained success a=
lso as=20

pamphleteers. R.B. Lewis, M.R. Delany, William Michael, he devoted his quic=
k intelligence and his=20

retentive memory to two branches of study,--the French language and the art=
 of reading. The=20

average Russian is a remarkably good linguist, and Ivan was much more than =
an average=20

Russian. It very soon became unsafe for =E2=80=9C_Mousi=C3=A9_=E2=80=9D to =
say anything in his presence which he was=20

not intended to understand; nor was it long before he could read sufficient=
ly well to amuse his=20

leisure with the worthless sentimental romances then, unhappily, popular in=
 Russia.  In other ways=20

his education made rapid progress. He soon appreciated the attractions of t=
he French theatre; he=20

learned to like the taste of champagne; and cards and loto were substituted=
 for the homely=20



babshkys of his childhood. Under the tutelage of M. Thomassin--as worthless=
 and unprincipled a=20

Frenchman as ever professed and propagated the doctrines of Voltaire--the W=
ertsches were=20

growing up into frivolous, dissipated young men of fashion, and open scoffe=
rs at what they styled a=20

stupid and antiquated superstition. Their mother, a thoroughly ignorant wom=
an, with a thin=20

veneering of showy accomplishments, was a little horrified when their conte=
mpt for things she had=20

been accustomed to revere was manifested in her presence; but she supposed =
that all must be=20

right which was taught them by a fashionable French =E2=80=9Cprofesseur.=E2=
=80=9D At all events, they only did like=20

other people in the _beau monde_, and its opinion was her idol.  Once only =
did Ivan see her really=20

provoked. He often visited his kind old friend Petrovitch, as indeed for ev=
ery reason he was bound=20

to do. The easiest way of reaching or returning from the merchants=E2=80=99=
 quarter was by crossing the=20

river, in summer by a ferry-boat, in winter on foot or in a sledge. Once, h=
owever, just when the ice=20

was beginning to break, and the passage was difficult and rather unsafe, Iv=
an stayed with the=20

Petrovitches for dinner, and came home in the evening in a drosky by a long=
er route. The=20

countess, before his return, had been a little alarmed for his safety, but =
was much more annoyed=20

when he made his appearance and explained how his day had been spent.  =E2=
=80=9CIt is well enough to=20

_visit_ people like the Petrovitches,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CBut to _e=
at_ in their house! such a thing is never=20

done in the world--_never_! For Heaven=E2=80=99s sake, Ivan, do not let any=
 one know of it. You would be=20

talked about.=E2=80=9D  Adrian, who was present, took Ivan=E2=80=99s part. =
=E2=80=9CAfter all, mother,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cin St.=20

Petersburg his Imperial Majesty has been known to drink tea in the house of=
 a merchant.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHis=20

Imperial Majesty,=E2=80=9D replied the countess with solemnity, =E2=80=9Cha=
d better take care of himself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhich,=E2=80=9D=20

returned Adrian, =E2=80=9Che is abundantly able to do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CO=
f course, Ivan,=E2=80=9D Madame Wertsch resumed, =E2=80=9Cyou=20

d man wishes to see=20

you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe will never see me again,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered =
sadly; =E2=80=9Che is quite blind now.=E2=80=9D  One incident of=20

his first winter in Moscow shocked Ivan considerably, though it made scarce=
ly any impression=20

upon those around him. Coming out at midnight with the Wertsches from a sum=
ptuous=20

entertainment at the palace of a friend, they found their little postilion =
lying dead in the snow, close=20

to the horses=E2=80=99 feet, with the reins=20


_
embellished Negro history; William Wells Brown wrote his _Three Years in Eu=
rope_; and Frederick=20

Douglass, the orator, gave the world his creditable autobiography. More eff=
ective still were the=20

journalistic efforts of the Negro intellect pleading its own cause. [1] Col=
ored newspapers varying=20

from the type of weeklies like _The North Star_ to that of the modern magaz=
ine like _The Anglo-

African_ were published in most large towns and cities of the North.  [Foot=
note 1: In 1827 John B.=20

Russworm and Samuel B. Cornish began the publication of _The Freedom's Jour=
nal_, appearing=20

afterward as _Rights to All_. Ten years later P.A. Bell was publishing _The=
 Weekly Advocate_.=20

From 1837 to 1842 Bell and Cornish edited _The Colored Man's Journal_, whil=

happened until too late to help him. Such accidents were of daily occurrenc=
e, Ivan was told, during=20

the frosty weather. No one seemed to think much about it; he was only a muj=
ik, one of the =E2=80=9Cblack=20

people,=E2=80=9D in the eyes of the fashionable world little better than be=
asts of burden. But Ivan was=20

haunted for weeks with the dead face of the pretty boy, to whom he had ofte=
n given a few kopecks=20

to buy sweetmeats. Another face came before him too with a reproachful, acc=
using look--the face=20

that he had seen bending compassionately over the senseless form of Stefen =
Alexitch. Ivan often=20

looked for that face in public places, in fashionable assemblies, in=20

Troy, New York. That same year Martin R. Delany brought out _The Pittsburg =
Mystery_, and=20

others _The Elevator_ at Albany, New York. At Syracuse appeared The _Impart=

arrival in Moscow, Ivan=20

made an expedition to Nicolofsky to visit his old friends. Although scarcel=
