forward, now slipping and sliding, and now falling, but always up and on ag=

man was almost winded, and his breath was coming in quick gasps, a faint, f=
ar-off cry floated=20

down to him through the ghostly aisles of the naked wind-swept forest.  At =
first it was so faint as to=20

be almost unintelligible, but as they pressed on, it grew louder and cleare=

is no fool like an old fool, they say; but I think, from what I hear, the y=

present day. Only think of young persons going over to the Church of Rome. =
