as _
if shoulders are made broad they should carry big burdens, so you go down t=
o Rosebury, young=20

man, and prosper in your work."  Noel smiled.  "I will certainly do my best=
," he said; "I quite agree=20

with your husband's sentiments."  "Well, well, young man, Joshua would have=
 liked to know you in=20

his day. Dear, how stupid I am! but I didn't rightly catch your name. What =
are you pleased to call=20

yourself, sir?"  "My name is Arthur Noel."  "Well, what a small world we li=
ve in; it was only to-day I=20

heard talk of you. When Miss Primrose and I were down at Rosebury we came a=
cross a=20

gentleman of the name of Danesfield, and he came straight up to Miss Primro=
se and said he had=20

had a letter from you which he had not been able to answer, because he was =
away. He said a lot=20

to Miss Primrose about the letter you wrote him; it seems that somebody mus=
t have stolen three=20

five-pound notes, which Mr. Danesfield put into a closed envelope, and gave=
 Miss Primrose for a=20

kind of emergency fund when she left her home. The poor lassie turned as wh=
ite as a sheet when=20

he talked to her. Well, young man, you look white enough yourself at the pr=
esent moment, but I'll=20

tell you, now, what has struck me, that whoever took the three five-pound n=
otes helped himself or=20

herself to that cheque of Miss Primrose's, and that poor little Daisy knows=
 about it."  "I should not=20

be the least surprised if you were right, Mrs. Dredge," answered Noel. "Wel=
l, I must go now if I=20

want to catch my train. Good-bye, Jasmine keep up your heart--expect good n=
ews soon, and get=20

all the orders you can for dressing dinner-tables."     CHAPTER XLIII.  IN =
THE FIELD.   Poor little=20

Daisy, very faint and tired, and with a feeling of almost despair in her li=
ttle heart, presently crept=20

through a bit for saying that. No, sir, I have not."  "I honestly didn't th=
ink it of you, but I couldn't=20

imagine any other way you could get the notion in your head."  "You never t=
old me a word till to-

day."  "You didn't know that I had that name in my possession till you blew=
 in here and asked for=20

it?"  "Not really and truly, I didn't. But I took a chance. And you are suc=
h a poor actor that I was=20

certain you'd tell me. Of course, I knew that you went over to Australia to=
 find out about the man."=20

"The treats are certainly on me."  "Make it a good big lunch, please," she =
said smiling and starting=20

for the door.  "Wait, Bets. What did you do over there at the George Henry =
Trust Company?"=20

"Must I tell, just now?"  "Of course not, but I'd like to know if you care =
to tell. It may save me from=20

something very unpleasant."  "You mean you will force me to tell?"  "Mercy =
me! No. I am better=20

acquainted with you than to try a thing like that."  "Will you keep a secre=
t, without giving away one=20

little word of it?"  "A client's counsel seldom repeats a confidential busi=
ness transaction."  "I paid=20

the two years of interest just a few minutes before that horrid old mortgag=
e was due, so Uncle=20

Josiah would not have to lose his place."  "Gosh!" was the inelegant reply.=
 "You're a brick!"  His=20

brow puckered.  "Won't that save him?" she asked with concern.  "Sure. But =
how did you know=20

that Uncle Josiah was a party to this mix-up?"  "Father told me that."  "Yo=
u should have been the=20

lawyer of this family. I never saw any one like you for finding things out.=
" Still apparently worried,=20

he added: "But your check will give you away. What if that happens to fall =
into Dad's hands?"  "I=20

didn't use my check. I went to our bank first, and drew out all my money. I=

e she could not walk=20

another step; she was also terribly weak from long fasting, and as she now =
had no hope at all of=20

bringing Primrose back her money, she felt disinclined to walk another step=
.  "I suppose I'll soon=20

die," she said to herself. "I wonder if God will take me to heaven? I know =
I was very selfish about=20

the dungeon. I might have gone to the dungeon, and dear Primrose would have=
 had her money,=20

and she and Jasmine would not have starved; but Mr. Dove did so terrify me =
I really had not=20

courage. Please, dear Jesus, I had not courage. I'm only a very weak, frigh=
tened little girl, and I=20

gave Mr. Dove Primrose's money, and now I can't get it back from him, and I=
 think my heart is=20

broken. I know, Jesus, you are angry with me, but please don't go on being =
angry; please forgive=20

me, for I am all alone now without Primrose and Jasmine, and I think I'll s=
oon die, for I feel so very=20

weak. I didn't tell a lie, either, Jesus; I never told any one about Mr. Do=
ve and the sticky=20

sweetmeats--no, it back."  "What under heaven did you do with it?"  "I went=
 down to an East River=20

fish wharf, and----"  "Took a corner on fish?"  "Harold, don't think me foo=
lish. Uncle Josiah had sold=20

his boat, thinking to pay Father off and save his place. I----"  "You bough=
t back the old fellow's=20

boat!"  She nodded.  Harold did not laugh. Instead, he turned toward his de=
sk and busily fumbled=20

papers. When he spoke there was a note of tenderness in his voice. "You're =
the best little sport in=20

seventeen States."  "Well, that doesn't keep me from starving."  "You didn'=
t come for anything=20

else?"  "No, except that I did want to talk with you. We can do that while =
we eat."  "I'd rather you=20

would ask me any questions before we go out. State secrets have been known =
to leak out from=20

restaurant tables."  "Tell me where this Adoniah Phillips lives."  "Whew! Y=
ou don't pick the easy=20

ones, do you? You certainly go right after what you want, Bets. But why do =
you ask?"  "Because I=20

want to know."  "You'll have to think up a better reason than that."  "If h=
e is one of your clients, why=20

don't you=20
