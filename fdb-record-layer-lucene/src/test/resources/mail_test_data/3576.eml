mping out of bed _
The settlement lay on the banks of the upper Catawba, near the junction of =
that stream with=20

Waxhaw Creek; and as it occupied a fertile oasis in a vast waste of pine wo=
ods, it was for decades=20

largely cut off from touch with the outside world. The settlement was situa=
ted, too, partly in North=20

Carolina and partly in South Carolina, so that in the pre-Revolutionary day=
s many of the=20

inhabitants hardly knew, or cared to know, in which of the two provinces th=
ey dwelt.  Upon their=20

arrival Jackson's friends bought land on the creek and within the bounds of=
 the settlement.=20

Jackson himself was too poor, however, to do this, and accordingly took up =
a claim six miles=20

distant on another little stream known as Twelve-mile Creek. Here, in the f=
all of 1765, he built a=20

small cabin, and during the winter he cleared five or six acres of ground. =
The next year he was=20

able to raise enough corn, vegetables, and pork to keep his little househol=
d from want. The tract=20

thus occupied cannot be positively identified, but it lay in what is now Un=
ion County, North=20

Carolina, a few miles from Monroe, the county seat.  Then came tragedy of a=
 sort in which frontier=20

history abounds. In the midst of his efforts to hew out a home and a future=
 for those who were=20

dear to him the father sickened and died, in March, 1767, at the early age =
of twenty-nine, less than=20

two years after his arrival at the settlement. Tradition says that his deat=
h was the result of a=20

rupture suffered in attempting to move a heavy log, and that it was so sudd=
en that the distracted=20

wife had no opportunity to seek aid from the distant neighbors. When at las=
t the news got abroad,=20

sympathy and assistance were lavished in true frontier fashion. Borne in a =
rude farm wagon, the=20

remains were taken to the Waxhaw burying ground and were interred in a spot=
 which tradition, but=20

tradition only, is able today to point out.  The widow never returned to th=
e desolated homestead.=20

She and her little ones were taken into the family of one of her married si=
sters, where she spent=20

her few remaining years. On the 15th of March, less than two weeks after he=
r husband's death,=20

she gave birth to a third son; and the child was promptly christened Andrew=
, in memory of the=20

parent he would never know.  Curiously, the seventh President's birthplace =
has been a matter of=20

sharp controversy. There is a tradition that the birth occurred while the m=
other was visiting a=20

neighboring family by the name of McKemy; and Parton, one of Jackson's prin=
cipal biographers,=20

adduces a good deal of evidence in support of the story. On the other hand,=
 Jackson always=20

believed that he was born in the home of the aunt with whom his bereaved mo=
ther took up her=20

residence; and several biographers, including Bassett, the most recent and =
the best, accept this=20

contention. It really matters not at all, save for the circumstance that if=
 the one view is correct=20

Jackson was born in North Carolina, while if the other is correct he was bo=
rn in South Carolina.=20

Both States have persistently claimed the honor. In the famous proclamation=
 which he addressed=20

to the South Carolina nullifiers in 1832 Jackson referred to them as "fello=
w-citizens of my for=20

mercy, and abandoned to Louis all Brittany. While this is doubtless an exag=
geration, we know that=20

he submitted absolutely, in November, 1234, to the will of his sovereign, a=
nd promised to serve=20

faithfully the king and his mother. It was not long after this that he went=
 to the Holy Land, leaving=20

the government of Brittany in the hands of his son.  The most bitter, the m=
ost crafty, the most=20

dangerous of her enemies having been reduced to subjection, there remained =
but one task for=20

Blanche to accomplish in order to crown the work she had undertaken for her=
 son. In the course of=20

the year 1235-1236 negotiations were undertaken with England that resulted =
in a truce for a term=20

of five years. Blanche was about to hand over the more active control of af=
fairs to Louis; it was no=20

bad beginning for him to find his realm at peace within and without, with a=
 prospect of the=20



continuance of these conditions.     CHAPTER VI  THE MOTHER AND THE WIFE OF=
 A SAINT=20

As the regency of Queen Blanche had begun without formality, so it ceased i=
nsensibly. There was=20

no set day upon which she formally relinquished the reins to Louis; and so =
one can but determine=20

an approximate date. On April 25, 1234, Louis may be considered to have att=
ained his majority.=20

Though we find the name of Blanche figuring in royal acts after this date, =
it becomes less frequent:=20

her share in the government is growing less, though throughout her life she=
 never ceased to stand=20

by her son and act with or advise him. At the very close of her regency we =
find her once more the=20

central figure with that unaccountable person Thibaud de Champagne. It must=
 be remembered=20

that he was now King of Navarre, a dignity which brought with it less of re=
al power in France than=20

one might suppose; for the French and the Spanish dominions, Champagne and =
Navarre, were=20

separated. His elevation to the throne may have momentarily turned the head=
 of the poet-king; at=20

any rate, he began to show dissatisfaction and to demur about fulfilling so=
me of the conditions=20

incident to the settlement of the claims of Alix de Champagne. In defiance =
of his duty as a vassal=20

he gave his daughter, without the king's consent, to Jean le Roux, son of P=
ierre Mauclerc. He=20

formed alliances with Mauclerc and with others of the old league; the hosti=
le intent could not be=20

mistaken. The king mobilized his forces and went to meet those of Thibaud. =
As the latter had not=20

had time to effect a junction with his Breton allies, the royal forces were=
 overwhelming, and he was=20

compelled to find some way out of his difficulty other than fighting. Remem=
bering that he had=20

assumed the Cross, and was, therefore, under the protection of the Church, =
he persuaded the=20

Pope to enjoin Louis from attacking him, declaring that his person and his =
lands were, on account=20

of his crusading vow, under the protection of the Church. Even this interve=
ntion might not have=20

saved him from severe punishment at the hands of his incensed sovereign; bu=
t when he sent to=20

make submission and to ask mercy, Queen Blanche, to whom he especially appe=
aled, summoned=20

him to her presence and promised to obtain fair terms for him. The terms, i=
ndeed, were not hard,=20


_
No one, at all events, can deny to the Waxhaw settlement an honored place i=
n American history.=20

There the father of John C. Calhoun first made his home. There the Revoluti=
onary general,=20

Andrew Pickens, met and married Rebecca Calhoun. There grew up the eminent =
North Carolinian=20

Governor and diplomat, William R. Davie. There William H. Crawford lived as=
 a boy. And there=20

Jackson dwelt until early manhood.  For the times, young Andrew was well br=
ought up. His mother=20

was a woman of strong character, who cherished for her last-born the desire=
 that he should=20

become a Presbyterian clergyman. The uncle with whom he lived was a serious=
-minded man who=20

by his industry had won means ample for the comfortable subsistence of his =
enlarged household.=20

When he was old enough, the boy worked for his living, but no harder than t=
he frontier boys of that=20

day usually worked; and while his advantages were only such as a backwoods =
community=20

afforded, they were at least as great as those of most boys similarly situa=
ted, and they were far=20

superior to those of the youthful Lincoln.  Jackson's earlier years, nevert=
heless, contained little=20

promise of his future distinction. He grew up amidst a rough people whose t=
astes ran strongly to=20

horse-racing, cockfighting, and heavy drinking, and whose ideal of excellen=
ce found expression in=20

a readiness to fight upon any and all occasions in defense of what they con=
sidered to be their=20

personal honor. In young Andrew Jackson these characteristics appeared in a=
 superlative degree.=20

He was mischievous, willful, daring, reckless. Hardly an escapade took plac=
e in the community in=20

which he did not share; and his sensitiveness and quick temper led him cont=
inually into trouble. In=20

his early teens he swore like a trooper, chewed tobacco incessantly, acquir=
ed a taste for strong=20

drink, and set a pace for wildness which few of his associates could keep u=
p. He was passionately=20

fond of running foot races, leaping the bar, jumping, wrestling, and every =
sort of sport that partook=20

of the character of mimic battle--and he never acknowledged defeat. "I coul=
d throw him three=20

times out of four," testifies an old schoolmate, "but he would never stay t=
hrowed. He was dead=20

game even then, and never would give up." Another early companion says that=
 of all the boys he=20

had known Jackson was the only bully who was not also a coward.  Of educati=
on the boy received=20

only such as was put unavoidably in his way. It is said that his mother tau=
ght him to read before he=20

was five years old; and he attended several terms in the little low-roofed =
log schoolhouse in the=20

Waxhaw settlement. But his formal instruction never took him beyond the fun=
damentals of reading,=20

writing, geography, grammar, and "casting accounts." He was neither studiou=
s nor teachable. As a=20

boy he preferred sport to study, and as a man he chose to rely on his own f=
ertile ideas rather than=20

to accept guidance from others. He never learned to write the English langu=
age correctly, although=20

he often wrote it eloquently and convincingly. In an age of bad spellers he=
 achieved distinction=20

from the number of ways in which he could spell a word within the space of =
a single page. He=20

could use no foreign languages; and of the great body of science, literatur=
e, history, and the arts=20

he knew next to nothing. He never acquired a taste for books, although vani=
ty prompted him to=20

treasure throughout his public career all correspondence and other document=
ary materials that=20

might be of use to future biographers. Indeed, he picked as a biographer fi=
rst his military aide,=20

John Reid, and later his close friend, John H. Eaton, whom he had the satis=
faction in 1829 of=20

appointing Secretary of War.  When the Revolution came, young Andrew was a =
boy of ten. For a=20

time the Carolina backwoods did not greatly feel the effect of the change. =
But in the spring of 1780=20

all of the revolutionary troops in South Carolina were captured at Charlest=
on, and the lands from=20

the sea to the mountains were left at the mercy of Tarleton's and Rawdon's =
bands of redcoats and=20



their Tory supporters. Twice the Waxhaw settlement was ravaged before the p=
atriots could make a=20

stand. Young Jackson witnessed two battles in 1780, without taking part in =
them, and in the=20

following year he, a brother, and a cousin were taken prisoners in a skirmi=
sh. To the day of his=20

death Jackson bore on his head and hand the marks of a saber blow administe=
red by a British=20

lieutenant whose jack boots he refused to polish. When an exchange of priso=
ners was made, Mrs.=20

Jackson secured the release of her two boys, but not until after they had c=
ontracted smallpox in=20

Camden jail. The older one died, but the younger, though reduced to a skele=
ton, survived. Already=20

the third brother had given up his life in battle; and the crowning disaste=
r came when the mother,=20

going as a volunteer to nurse the wounded Waxhaw prisoners on the British v=
essels in Charleston=20

harbor, fell ill of yellow fever and perished. Small wonder that Andrew Jac=
kson always hated the=20

British uniform, or that when he sat in the executive chair an anti-British=
 feeling colored all of his=20

dealings with foreign nations!  At the age of fourteen, the sandy-haired, p=
ockmarked lad of the=20

Waxhaws found himself alone in the world. The death of his relatives had ma=
de him heir to a=20

portion of his grandfather's estate in Carrickfergus; but the property was =
tied up in the hands of an=20

administrator, and the boy was in effect both penniless and homeless. The m=
emory of his mother=20

and her teachings was, as he was subsequently accustomed to say, the only c=
apital with which he=20

started life. To a natural waywardness and quarrelsomeness had been added a=
 heritage of bitter=20

memories, and the outlook was not bright.  Upon one thing the youth was det=
ermined: he would no=20

longer be a charge upon his uncle or upon any one else. What to turn to, ho=
wever, was not so=20

easy to decide. First he tried the saddler's trade, but that was too monoto=
nous. Then he undertook=20

school-teaching; that proved little better. Desirous of a glimpse of the wo=
rld, he went to Charleston=20

in the autumn of 1782. There he made the acquaintance of some people of wea=
lth and fell into=20

habits of life which were beyond his means. At the race track he bet and sw=
aggered himself into=20

notice; and when he ran into debt he was lucky enough to free himself by wi=
nning a large wager.=20

But the proceeds of his little inheritance, which had in the meantime becom=
e available, were now=20

entirely used up; and when in the spring the young spendthrift went back to=
 the Waxhaws, he had=20

only a fine horse with elegant equipment, a costly pair of pistols, a gold =
watch, and a fair=20

wardrobe--in addition to some familiarity with the usages of fashion--to sh=
ow for his spent=20

"fortune."  One other thing which Jackson may have carried back with him fr=
om Charleston was an=20

ambition to become a lawyer. At all events, in the fall of 1784 he entered =
the law office of a certain=20

Spruce Macay in the town of Salisbury, North Carolina; and, after three yea=
rs of intermittent study,=20

he was admitted to practice in the courts of the State. The instruction whi=
ch he had received was=20

not of a high order, and all accounts agree that the young man took his tas=
ks lightly and that he=20

learned but little law. That he fully sustained the reputation which he had=
 gained in the Waxhaws is=20

indicated by testimony of one of Macay's fellow townsmen, after Jackson had=
 become famous, to=20

the effect that the former student had been "the most roaring, rollicking, =
game-cocking, card-

playing, mischievous fellow that ever lived in Salisbury."  Upon his admiss=
ion to the bar the=20

irresponsible young blade hung out his shingle in Martinsville, Guilford Co=
unty, North Carolina,=20

and sat down to wait for clients. He was still less than twenty years old, =
without influence, and with=20

only such friends as his irascible disposition permitted him to make and ho=
ld. Naturally business=20

came slowly, and it became necessary to eke out a living by serving as a lo=
cal constable and also=20

by assisting in a mercantile enterprise carried on by two acquaintances in =
the town. After a year=20



this hand-to-mouth existence began to pall. Neither then nor in later life =
did Jackson have any real=20

taste or aptitude for law. He was not of a legal turn of mind, and he was w=
holly unprepared to=20

suffer the sacrifices and disappointments which a man of different disposit=
ion would have been=20

willing to undergo in order to win for himself an established position in h=
is profession. Chagrin in=20

this restless young man was fast yielding to despair when an alluring field=
 of action opened for him=20

in the fast-developing country beyond the mountains.  The settlement of whi=
te men in that part of=20

North Carolina which lay west of the Alleghanies had begun a year or two af=
ter Jackson's birth. At=20

first the hardy pioneers found lodgment on the Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky=
, and other streams=20

to the east of modern Knoxville. But in 1779 a colony was planted by James =
Robertson and John=20

Donelson on the banks of the Cumberland, two hundred miles farther west, an=
d in a brief time the=20

remoter settlement, known as Nashville, became a Mecca for homeseeking Caro=
linians and=20

Virginians. The intervening hill and forest country abounded in hostile Ind=
ians. The settler or trader=20

who undertook to traverse this region took his life in his hands, and the s=
ettlements themselves=20

were subject to perennial attack.  In 1788, after the collapse of an attemp=
t of the people of the=20

"Western District" to set up an independent State by the name of Franklin, =
the North Carolina=20

Assembly erected the three counties included in the Cumberland settlement i=
nto a superior court=20

district; and the person selected for judge was a close friend of Jackson, =
John McNairy, who also=20

had been a law pupil of Spruce Macay in Salisbury. McNairy had been in the =
Tennessee region=20

two years, but at the time of receiving his judicial appointment he was vis=
iting friends in the=20

Carolinas. His description of the opportunities awaiting ambitious young me=
n in the back country=20

influenced a half-dozen acquaintances, lawyers and others, to make the retu=
rn trip with him; and=20

among the number was Jackson. Some went to assume posts which were at McNai=
ry's disposal,=20

but Jackson went only to see the country.  Assembling at Morganton, on the =
east side of the=20

mountains, in the fall of 1788, the party proceeded leisurely to Jonesboro,=
 which, although as yet=20

only a village of fifty or sixty log houses, was the metropolis of the east=
ern Tennessee settlements.=20

There the party was obliged to wait for a sufficient band of immigrants to =
assemble before they=20

could be led by an armed guard with some degree of safety through the dange=
rous middle=20

country. As a highway had just been opened between Jonesboro and Nashville,=
 the travelers were=20

able to cover the distance in fifteen days. Jackson rode a fine stallion, w=
hile a pack mare carried=20

his worldly effects, consisting of spare clothes, blankets, half a dozen la=
w books, and small=20

quantities of ammunition, tea, tobacco, liquor, and salt. For defense he bo=
re a rifle and three=20

pistols; and in his pocket he carried one hundred and eighty dollars of the=
 much valued hard=20

money. On the second day of November the emigrant train made its appearance=
 in Nashville=20

bringing news of much interest--in particular, that the Federal Constitutio=
n had been ratified by the=20

ninth State, and that the various legislatures were preparing to choose ele=
ctors, who would=20

undoubtedly make George Washington the first President of the Republic.  Le=
ss than ten years=20

old, Nashville had now a population of not over two hundred. But it was the=
 center of a somewhat=20

settled district extending up and down the Cumberland for a distance of eig=
hty or ninety miles, and=20

the young visitor from the Waxhaws quickly found it a promising field for h=
is talents. There was=20

only one lawyer in the place, and creditors who had been outbid for his ser=
vices by their debtors=20

were glad to put their cases in the hands of the newcomer. It is said that =
before Jackson had been=20

in the settlement a month he had issued more than seventy writs to delinque=
nt debtors. When, in=20



1789, he was appointed "solicitor," or prosecutor, in Judge McNairy's juris=
diction with a salary of=20

forty pounds for each court he attended, his fortune seemed made and he for=
thwith gave up all=20

thought of returning to his Carolina home. Instead he took lodgings under t=
he roof of the widow of=20

John Donelson, and in 1791 he married a daughter of that doughty frontiersm=
an. Land was still=20

cheap, and with the proceeds of his fees and salary he purchased a large pl=
antation called=20

Hunter's Hill, thirteen miles from Nashville, and there he planned to estab=
lish a home which would=20

take rank as one of the finest in the western country.  The work of a front=
ier solicitor was diverse=20

and arduous. A turbulent society needed to be kept in order and the busines=
s obligations of a=20

shifty and quarrelsome people to be enforced. No great knowledge of law was=
 required, but=20

personal fearlessness, vigor, and incorruptibility were indispensable. Jack=
son was just the man for=20

the business. His physical courage was equaled by his moral strength; he wa=
s passionately=20

devoted to justice; he was diligent and conscientious; and, as one writer h=
as remarked, bad=20

grammar, incorrect pronunciation, and violent denunciation did not shock th=
e judges of that day or=20

divert the mind of juries from the truth. Traveling almost constantly over =
the wretched roads and=20

through the dark forests, dodging Indians, swimming his horse across torren=
tial streams, sleeping=20

alone in the woods with hand on rifle, threatened by desperate wrongdoers, =
Andrew Jackson=20

became the best-known figure in all western Tennessee and won at this time =
a great measure of=20

that public confidence which later became his chief political asset.  Meanw=
hile the rapid growth of=20

population south of the Ohio River made necessary new arrangements for purp=
oses of=20

government. In 1790 the region between the Ohio and the present States of A=
labama and=20

Mississippi, having been turned over to the Nation by its earlier possessor=
s, was erected into the=20

"Southwest Territory," and in 1791 the northern half became the State of Ke=
ntucky. In 1793 the=20

remainder of the Territory set up a Legislature, and three years later dele=
gates from the eleven=20

counties met at Knoxville to draw up a new frame of government with a view =
to admission to=20

statehood. Jackson was a member of this convention, and tradition has it th=
at it was he who=20

brought about the selection of the name Tennessee, an Indian term meaning "=
The Great Crooked=20

River," as against Franklin, Washington, and other proposed designations fo=
r the new State. At all=20

events, upon the admission of the State in 1796, he was chosen as its sole =
representative in the=20

lower branch of Congress.  In the late autumn of that year the young lawmak=
er set out for the=20

national capital at Philadelphia, and there he arrived, after a journey of =
almost eight hundred miles=20

on horseback, just as the triumphs of the Democrats in the recent president=
ial election were being=20

duly celebrated. He had not been chosen as a party man, but it is altogethe=
r probable that his own=20

sympathies and those of most of his constituents lay with the Jeffersonians=
; and his appearance=20

on the floor of Congress was an omen of the fast-rising tide of western dem=
ocracy which should=20

never find its ultimate goal until this rough but honest Tennesseean should=
 himself be borne into=20

the presidential chair.  Jackson's career in Congress was brief and unevent=
ful. After a year of=20

service in the House of Representatives he was appointed to fill the unexpi=
red term of William=20

Blount in the Senate. But this post he resigned in 1798 in order to devote =
his energies to his=20

private affairs. While at Philadelphia he made the acquaintance not only of=
 John Adams,=20

Jefferson, Randolph, Gallatin, and Burr, but of his future Secretary of Sta=
te, Edward Livingston,=20

and of some other persons who were destined to be closely connected with hi=
s later career. But=20

Jackson was not fitted for a legislative body either by training or by temp=
erament. He is recorded=20



as speaking in the House only twice and in the Senate not at all, and he se=
ems to have made no=20

considerable impression upon his colleagues. Gallatin later described him a=
s "a tall, lank, uncouth-

looking personage, with long locks of hair hanging over his face, and a que=
ue down his back tied=20

in an eel-skin; his dress singular, his manners and deportment those of a r=
ough backwoodsman."=20

And Jefferson is represented as saying of Jackson to Webster at Monticello =
in 1824: "His passions=20

are terrible. When I was president of the Senate he was Senator, and he cou=
ld never speak on=20

account of the rashness of his feelings. I have seen him attempt it repeate=
dly, and as often choke=20

with rage."  Return to Tennessee meant, however, only a transfer from one b=
ranch of the public=20

service to another, for the ex-Senator was promptly appointed to a judgeshi=
p of the state supreme=20

court at a salary of six hundred dollars a year. The position he found not =
uncongenial and he=20

retained it for six years. Now, as earlier, Jackson's ignorance of law was =
somewhat compensated=20

by his common sense, courage, and impartiality; and while only one of his d=
ecisions of this period=20

is extant, Parton reports that the tradition of fifty years ago represented=
 them as short, untechnical,=20

unlearned, sometimes ungrammatical, but generally right. The daily life of =
Jackson as a frontier=20

judge was hardly less active and exciting than it had been when he was a pr=
osecuting attorney.=20

There were long and arduous horseback journeys "on circuit"; ill-tempered p=
ersons often=20

threatened, and sometimes attempted, to deal roughly with the author of an =
unfavorable decision;=20

occasionally it was necessary to lay aside his dignity long enough to lend =
a hand in capturing or=20

controlling a desperate character. For example, on arriving once in a settl=
ement Jackson found=20

that a powerful blacksmith had committed a crime and that the sheriff dared=
 not arrest him.=20

"Summon me," said the judge; whereupon he walked down from the bench, found=
 the culprit, led=20

him into court, and sentenced him.  In 1804 Jackson resigned his judgeship =
in order to give=20

exclusive attention again to his private affairs. He had fallen badly into =
debt, and his creditors were=20

pressing him hard. One expedient after another failed, and finally Hunter's=
 Hill had to be given up.=20

He saved enough from the wreck, however, to purchase a small plantation eig=
ht miles from=20

Nashville; and there, after several years of financial rehabilitation, he e=
rected the handsome brick=20

house which the country came subsequently to know as "The Hermitage." In pa=
rtnership with two=20

of his wife's relatives, Jackson had opened a store in which, even while st=
ill a member of the=20

highest tribunal of the State, he not infrequently passed tea and salt and =
calico over the counter to=20

his neighbors. In small trading, however, he was not adept, and the store f=
ailed. Nevertheless,=20

from 1804 until 1813 he successfully combined with planting and the stock-r=
aising business=20

enterprises of a larger sort, especially slave and horse dealing. His debts=
 paid off, he now became=20

one of the most prosperous, as he already was one of the most influential, =
men of the Cumberland=20

country.  But it was not given to Andrew Jackson to be a mere money-maker o=
r to dwell in=20

quietness. In 1804 he was denied the governorship of the New Orleans Territ=
ory because he was=20

described to Jefferson as "a man of violent passions, arbitrary in his disp=
osition, and frequently=20

engaged in broils and disputes." During the next decade he fully lived up t=
o this description. He=20

quarreled with Governor John Sevier, and only the intervention of friends p=
revented the two from=20

doing each other violence. He broke off friendly relations with his old pat=
ron, Judge McNairy. In a=20

duel he killed Charles Dickinson, who had spoken disparagingly of Mrs. Jack=
son, and he himself=20

suffered a wound which weakened him for life. He publicly caned one Thomas =
Swann. In a rough-

and-tumble encounter with Thomas Hart Benton and the latter's brother Jesse=
 he was shot in the=20



shoulder and one of his antagonists was stabbed. This list of quarrels, thr=
eats, fights, and other=20

violent outbursts could be extended to an amazing length. "Yes, I had a fig=
ht with Jackson,"=20

Senator Benton admitted late in life; "a fellow was hardly in the fashion t=
hen who hadn't."  At the=20

age of forty-five Jackson had not yet found himself. He was known in his ow=
n State as "a=20

successful planter, a breeder and racer of horses, a swearer of mighty oath=
s, a faithful and=20

generous man to his friends, a chivalrous man to women, a hospitable man at=
 his home, a=20

desperate and relentless man in personal conflicts, a man who always did th=
e things he set=20

himself to do." But he had achieved no nation-wide distinction; he had not =
wrought out a career;=20

he had made almost as many enemies as friends, he had cut himself off from =
official connections;=20

he had no desire to return to the legal profession; and he was so dissatisf=
ied with his lot and=20

outlook that he seriously considered moving to Mississippi in order to make=
 a fresh start.  One=20

thread, however, still bound him to the public service. From 1802 he had be=
en major general of=20

militia in the eleven counties of western Tennessee; and notwithstanding th=
e fact that three calls=20

from the Government during a decade had yielded no real opportunity for act=
ion, he clung both to=20

the office and to the hope for a chance to lead his "hardy sons of the West=
" against a foe worthy of=20

their efforts. This chance came sooner than people expected, and it led in =
precisely the direction=20

that Jackson would have chosen--toward the turbulent, misgoverned Spanish d=
ependency of=20

Florida.     CHAPTER II THE CREEK WAR AND THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS  Every=
=20

schoolboy knows and loves the story of the midnight ride of Paul Revere. Bu=
t hardly anybody has=20

heard of the twenty-day, fifteen-hundred-mile ride of "Billy" Phillips, the=
 President's express=20

courier, who in 1812 carried to the Southwest the news that the people of t=
he United States had=20

entered upon a second war with their British kinsmen. William Phillips was =
a young, lithe=20

Tennesseean whom Senator Campbell took to Washington in 1811 as secretary. =
When not more=20

than sixteen years old he had enjoyed the honor of riding Andrew Jackson's =
famous steed,=20

Truxton, in a heat race, for the largest purse ever heard of west of the mo=
untains, with the proud=20

owner on one side of the stakes. In Washington he occasionally turned an ho=
nest penny by=20

jockey-riding in the races on the old track of Bladensburg, and eventually =
he became one of a=20

squad of ten or twelve expert horsemen employed by the Government in carryi=
ng urgent long-

distance messages.  After much hesitation, Congress passed a joint resoluti=
on at about five=20

o'clock on Friday, June 18, 1812, declaring war against Great Britain. Befo=
re sundown the express=20

couriers were dashing swiftly on their several courses, some toward relucta=
nt New England, some=20

toward Pennsylvania and New York, some southward, some westward. To Phillip=
s it fell to carry=20

the momentous news to his own Tennessee country and thence down the Mississ=
ippi to New=20

Orleans. That the task was undertaken with all due energy is sufficiently a=
ttested in a letter written=20

by a Baptist clergyman at Lexington, North Carolina, to a friend, who happe=
ned to have been one=20

of Jackson's old teachers at the Waxhaws. "I have to inform you," runs the =
communication, "that=20

just now the President's express-rider, Bill Phillips, has tore through thi=
s little place without=20

stopping. He came and went in a cloud of dust, his horse's tail and his own=
 long hair streaming=20

alike in the wind as they flew by. But as he passed the tavern stand where =
some were gathered he=20

swung his leather wallet by its straps above his head and shouted--'Here's =
the Stuff! Wake up!=20

War! War with England!! War!!!' Then he disappeared in a cloud of dust down=
 the Salisbury Road=20

like a streak of Greased Lightnin'." Nine days brought the indefatigable co=
urier past Hillsboro,=20



Salisbury, Morganton, Jonesboro, and Knoxville to Nashville--a daily averag=
e of ninety-five miles=20

over mountains and through uncleared country. In eleven days more the Presi=
dent's dispatches=20

were in the hands of Governor Claiborne at New Orleans.  The joy of the Wes=
t was unbounded.=20

The frontiersman was always ready for a fight, and just now he especially w=
anted a fight with=20

England. He resented the insults that his country had suffered at the hands=
 of the English=20

authorities and had little patience with the vacillating policy so long pur=
sued by Congress and the=20

Madison Administration. Other grievances came closer home. For two years th=
e West had been=20

disturbed by Indian wars and intrigues for which the English officers and a=
gents in Canada were=20

held largely responsible. In 1811 Governor Harrison of Indiana Territory de=
feated the Indians at=20

Tippecanoe. But Tecumseh was even then working among the Creeks, Cherokees,=
 and other=20

southern tribes with a view to a confederation which should be powerful eno=
ugh to put a stop to=20

the sale of land to the advancing white population. A renewal of the disord=
ers was therefore=20

momentarily expected. Furthermore, the people of the Southwest were as usua=
l on bad terms with=20

their Spanish neighbors in Florida and Texas; they coveted an opportunity f=
or vengeance for=20

wrongs which they had suffered; and some longed for the conquest of Spanish=
 territory. At all=20

events, war with England was the more welcome because Spain, as an ally of =
that power, was=20

likely to be involved.  Nowhere was the news received with greater enthusia=
sm than at Nashville;=20

and by no one with more satisfaction than by Andrew Jackson. As major gener=
al of militia Jackson=20

had for ten years awaited just such a chance for action. In 1811 he wrote f=
ervently to Harrison=20

offering to come to his assistance in the Wabash expedition with five hundr=
ed West=20

Tennesseeans, but his services were not needed. At the close of the year he=
 induced the=20

Governor of his State, William Blount, to inform the War Department that he=
 could have twenty-five=20

hundred men "before Quebec within ninety days" if desired. Again he was ref=
used. But now his=20

opportunity had come. Billy Phillips was hardly on his way to Natchez befor=
e Jackson, Blount, and=20

Benton were addressing a mass meeting called to "ratify" the declaration of=
 war, and on the=20

following day a courier started for Washington with a letter from Jackson t=
endering the services of=20

twenty-five hundred Tennesseeans and assuring the President, with better pa=
triotism than syntax,=20

that wherever it might please him to find a place of duty for these men he =
could depend upon them=20

to stay "till they or the last armed foe expires."  After some delay the of=
fer was accepted. Already=20

the fiery major general was dreaming of a conquest of Florida. "You burn wi=
th anxiety," ran a=20

proclamation issued to his division in midsummer, "to learn on what theater=
 your arms will find=20

employment. Then turn your eyes to the South! Behold in the province of Wes=
t Florida a territory=20

whose rivers and harbors are indispensable to the prosperity of the western=
, and still more so, to=20

the eastern division of our state. . . . It is here that an employment adap=
ted to your situation awaits=20

your courage and your zeal, and while extending in this quarter the boundar=
ies of the Republic to=20

the Gulf of Mexico, you will experience a peculiar satisfaction in having c=
onferred a signal benefit=20

on that section of the Union to which you yourselves immediately belong."  =
It lay in the cards that=20

Jackson was to be a principal agent in wresting the Florida country from th=
e Spaniards; and while=20

there was at Washington no intention of allowing him to set off post-haste =
upon the mission, all of=20

the services which he was called upon to render during the war converged di=
rectly upon that=20

objective. After what seemed an interminable period of waiting came the fir=
st order to move.=20

Fifteen hundred Tennessee troops were to go to New Orleans, ostensibly to p=
rotect the city=20



against a possible British attack, but mainly to be quickly available in ca=
se an invasion of West=20

Florida should be decided upon; and Jackson, freshly commissioned major gen=
eral of volunteers,=20

was to lead the expedition.  The rendezvous was fixed at Nashville for earl=
y December; and when=20

more than two thousand men, representing almost every family of influence i=
n the western half of=20

the State, presented themselves, Governor Blount authorized the whole numbe=
r to be mustered.=20

On the 7th of January the hastily equipped detachment started, fourteen hun=
dred infantrymen=20

going down the ice-clogged Cumberland in flatboats and six hundred and seve=
nty mounted=20

riflemen proceeding by land. The Governor sent a letter carrying his blessi=
ng. Jackson responded=20

with an effusive note in which he expressed the hope that "the God of battl=
es may be with us."=20

Parton says with truth that the heart of western Tennessee went down the ri=
ver with the=20

expedition. In a letter to the Secretary of War Jackson declared that his m=
en had no "constitutional=20

scruples," but would, if so ordered, plant the American eagle on the "walls=
" of Mobile, Pensacola,=20

and St. Augustine.  After five weeks the troops, in high spirits, reassembl=
ed at Natchez. Then=20

came cruel disappointment. From New Orleans Governor James Wilkinson, doubt=
less moved by=20

hatred of Jackson quite as much as by considerations of public policy, orde=
red the little army to=20

stay where it was. And on the 15th of March there was placed in the command=
er's hands a curt=20

note from the Secretary of War saying that the reasons for the undertaking =
had disappeared, and=20

announcing that the corps under the Tennesseean's command had "ceased to ex=
ist."  Jackson=20

flew into a rage--and with more reason than on certain other occasions. He =
was sure that there=20

was treachery somewhere; at the least, it was all a trick to bring a couple=
 of thousand good=20

Tennessee volunteers within the clutches of Wilkinson's recruiting officers=
. He managed to write to=20

the President a temperate letter of protest; but to Governor Blount and to =
the troops he=20

unbosomed himself with characteristic forcefulness of speech. There was not=
hing to do but return=20

home. But the irate commander determined to do it in a manner to impress th=
e country. He kept=20

his force intact, drew rations from the commissary department at Natchez, a=
nd marched back to=20

Nashville with all the clat that would have attended a returning conqueror.=
 When Wilkinson's=20

subordinates refused to pay the cost of transporting the sick, Jackson pled=
ged his own credit for=20

the purpose, to the amount of twelve thousand dollars. It was on the trying=
 return march that his=20

riflemen conferred on him the happy nickname "Old Hickory."  The Secretary =
of War later sought=20

to appease the irascible major general by offering a wholly plausible expla=
nation of the sudden=20

reversal of the Government's policy; and the expenses of the troops on the =
return march were fully=20

met out of the national treasury. But Jackson drew from the experience only=
 gall and wormwood.=20

About the time when the men reached Natchez, Congress definitely authorized=
 the President to=20

take possession of Mobile and that part of Florida west of the Perdido Rive=
r; and, back once more=20

in the humdrum life of Nashville, the disappointed officer could only sit i=
dly by while his pet project=20

was successfully carried out by General Wilkinson, the man whom, perhaps ab=
ove all others, he=20

loathed. But other work was preparing; and, after all, most of Florida was =
yet to be won.  In the late=20

summer of 1813 the western country was startled by news of a sudden attack =
of a band of=20

upwards of a thousand Creeks on Fort Mims, Alabama, culminating in a massac=
re in which two=20

hundred and fifty white men, women, and children lost their lives. It was t=
he most bloody=20

occurrence of the kind in several decades, and it brought instantly to a he=
ad a situation which=20

Jackson, in common with many other military men, had long viewed with appre=
hension.  From=20



time immemorial the broad stretches of hill and valley land southwards from=
 the winding=20

Tennessee to the Gulf were occupied, or used as hunting grounds, by the war=
like tribes forming=20

the loose-knit Creek Confederacy. Much of this land was extremely fertile, =
and most of it required=20

little labor to prepare it for cultivation. Consequently after 1800 the inf=
lux of white settlers, mainly=20

cotton raisers, was heavy; and by 1812 the great triangular area between th=
e Alabama and the=20

Tombigbee, as well as extensive tracts along the upper Tombigbee and the Mo=
bile, was quite fully=20

occupied. The heart of the Creek country was the region about the Coosa and=
 Tallapoosa rivers,=20

which join in central Alabama to form the stream which bears the State's na=
me. But not even this=20

district was immune from encroachment.  The Creeks were not of a sort to su=
bmit to the loss of=20

their lands without a struggle. Though Tecumseh, in 1811, had brought them =
to the point of an=20

uprising, his plans were not carried out, and it remained for the news of h=
ostilities between the=20

United States and Great Britain to rouse the war spirit afresh. In a short =
time the entire Creek=20

country was aflame. Arms and ammunition the Indians obtained from the Spani=
ards across the=20

Florida border, and Colonel Edward Nicholls, now stationed at Pensacola as =
provisional British=20

Governor, gave them open encouragement. The danger was understood not only =
among the=20

people of the Southwest but in Washington. Before plans of defense could be=
 carried into effect,=20

however, the war broke out, and the wretched people who had crowded into th=
e flimsy stockade=20

called by courtesy Fort Mims were massacred.  Hardly had the heap of ruins,=
 ghastly with human=20

bodies, ceased to smolder before fleet riders were spreading the news in Ge=
orgia, in Louisiana,=20

and in Tennessee. A shudder swept the country. Every exposed community expe=
cted to be=20

attacked next. The people's demand for vengeance was overmastering, and fro=
m north, west, and=20

east volunteer armies were soon on the march. Tennessee sent two quotas, on=
e from the eastern=20

counties under General John Cocke, the other from the western under Andrew =
Jackson. When the=20

news of the disaster on the Mobile reached Nashville, Jackson was lying hel=
pless from wounds=20

received in his fight with the Bentons. But he issued the necessary orders =
from his bed and let it=20

be known with customary vigor that he, the senior major general, and no one=
 else, would lead the=20

expedition; and though three weeks later he started off with his arm tightl=
y bandaged to his side=20

and a shoulder so sore that it could not bear the pressure of an epaulette,=
 lead the expedition he=20

did.  About the middle of October the emaciated but dogged commander brough=
t his forces=20

together, 2700 strong, at Huntsville and began cutting his way across the m=
ountains toward the=20

principal Creek settlements. His plan was to fall suddenly upon these settl=
ements, strike terror into=20

the inhabitants, and force a peace on terms that would guarantee the safety=
 of the frontier=20

populations. Supplies were slow to arrive, and Jackson fumed and stormed. H=
e quarreled=20

desperately, too, with Cocke, whom he unjustly blamed for mismanagement. Bu=
t at last he was=20

able to emerge on the banks of the Coosa and build a stockade, Fort Strothe=
r, to serve as a base=20

for the campaign.  During the months that followed, the intrepid leader was=
 compelled to fight two=20

foes--his insubordinate militiamen and the Creeks. His command consisted pa=
rtly of militia and=20

partly of volunteers, including many men who had first enlisted for the exp=
edition down the=20

Mississippi. Starvation and disease caused loud murmurings, and after one o=
r two minor victories=20

had been won the militiamen took it into their heads to go back home. Jacks=
on drew up the=20

volunteers across the mutineers' path and drove them back to the camp. Then=
 the volunteers=20

started off, and the militia had to be used to bring them back! At one time=
 the furious general faced=20



a mutinous band single-handed and, swearing that he would shoot the first m=
an who stirred, awed=20

the recalcitrants into obedience. On another occasion he had a youth who ha=
d been guilty of=20

insubordination shot before the whole army as an object lesson. At last it =
became apparent that=20

nothing could be done with such troops, and the volunteers--such of them as=
 had not already=20

slipped away--were allowed to go home. Governor Blount advised that the who=
le undertaking be=20

given up. But Jackson wrote him a letter that brought a flush of shame to h=
is cheek, and in a short=20

time fresh forces by the hundreds, with ample supplies, were on the way to =
Fort Strother. Among=20

the newcomers was a lank, angular-featured frontiersman who answered to the=
 name of Sam=20

Houston.  After having been reduced for a short period to one hundred men, =
Jackson by early=20

spring had an army of five thousand, including a regiment of regulars, and =
found it once more=20

possible to act. The enemy decided to make its stand at a spot called by th=
e Indians Tohopeka, by=20

the whites Horseshoe Bend, on the Tallapoosa. Here a thousand warriors, wit=
h many women and=20

children, took refuge behind breastworks which they believed impregnable, a=
nd here, in late=20

March, Jackson attacked with a force of three thousand men. No quarter was =
asked and none=20

given, on either side, and the battle quickly became a butchery. Driven by =
fire from a thicket of dry=20

brush in which they took refuge, the Creek warriors were shot down or bayon=
eted by the=20

hundreds; those who plunged into the river for safety were killed as they s=
wam. Scarcely a=20

hundred survived. Among the number was a youth who could speak a little Eng=
lish, and whose=20

broken leg one of the surgeons undertook to treat. Three stalwart riflemen =
were required to hold=20

the patient. "Lie still, my boy, they will save your life," said Jackson en=
couragingly, as he came=20

upon the scene. "No good," replied the disconsolate victim. "No good. Cure =
um now, kill um=20

again!"  The victory practically ended the war. Many of the "Red Sticks," a=
s the Creek braves were=20

called, fled beyond the Florida border; but many--among them the astute hal=
f-breed Weathersford,=20

who had ordered the assault on Fort Mims--came in and surrendered. Fort Jac=
kson, built in the=20

river fork, became an outpost of American sovereignty in the very heart of =
the Creek district. "The=20

fiends of the Tallapoosa," declared the victorious commander in his farewel=
l address to his men,=20

"will no longer murder our women and children, or disturb the quiet of our =
borders."  Jackson=20

returned to Tennessee to find himself the most popular man in the State. Na=
shville gave him the=20

first of what was destined to be a long series of tumultuous receptions; an=
d within a month the=20

news came that William Henry Harrison had resigned his commission and that =
Jackson had been=20

appointed a major general in the army of the United States, with command in=
 the southwestern=20

district, including Mobile and New Orleans. "Thus did the frontier soldier,=
 who eighteen months=20

earlier had not commanded an expedition or a detachment, come to occupy the=
 highest rank in the=20

army of his country. No other man in that country's service since the Revol=
ution has risen to the=20

top quite so quickly."   Bassett, The Life of Andrew Jackson, Vol. I, p. 12=
3.  By his appointment=20

Jackson became the eventual successor of General Wilkinson, with headquarte=
rs at New Orleans.=20

His first move, however, was to pay a visit to Mobile; and on his way thith=
er, in August, 1814, he=20

paused in the Creek country to garner the fruits of his late victory. A cou=
ncil of the surviving chiefs=20

was assembled and a treaty was presented, with a demand that it be signed f=
orthwith. The terms=20

took the Indians aback, but argument was useless. The whites were granted f=
ull rights to maintain=20

military posts and roads and to navigate the rivers in the Creek lands; the=
 Creeks had to promise=20

to stop trading with British and Spanish posts; and they were made to cede =
to the United States all=20



the lands which their people had claimed west and southeast of the Coosa Ri=
ver--more than half=20

of their ancient territories. Thus was the glory of the Creek nation brough=
t to an end.  Meanwhile=20

the war with Great Britain was entering a new and threatening phase. No not=
able successes had=20

been achieved on land, and repeated attempts to reduce Canada had signally =
failed. On the Great=20

Lakes and the high seas the navy had won glory, but only a handful of priva=
teers was left to keep=20

up the fight. The collapse of Napoleon's power had brought a lull in Europe=
, and the British were=20

free to concentrate their energies as never before on the conflict in Ameri=
ca. The effects were=20

promptly seen in the campaign which led to the capture of Washington and th=
e burning of the=20

Federal Capitol in August, 1814. They were equally manifest in a well-laid =
plan for a great assault=20

on the country's unduly severe which Blanche is said to have made in her la=
st interview with=20

Thibaud: "In God's name, Count Thibaud, you should not have taken sides aga=
inst us; you should=20

have called to mind the great goodness of my son, the king, when he came to=
 your aid to protect=20

your county and your lands from all the barons of France, who would have bu=
rned everything and=20

reduced it to ashes." Then came the courteous reply of the gallant and cont=
rite Thibaud: "By my=20

faith, madame, my heart and my body and all my lands are yours; there is na=
ught that could=20

please you that I would not do willingly; and never again, please God, will=
 I go against you or=20

yours."  The romance of this scene, almost pathetic, is ruthlessly disturbe=
d by the scene that is=20

said to have followed, yet we must tell of this also. The young Prince Robe=
rt, always of a violent=20

temper, took it upon him to insult the vanquished King of Navarre. He had t=
he tails of the latter's=20

horses cut off a--shameful insult to a knight--and as Thibaud was leaving t=
he palace Robert threw=20

a soft cheese on his head. Thibaud returned to Blanche indignant at the ins=
ult offered him despite=20

her safe conduct; and she was preparing to punish the offenders summarily w=
hen she discovered=20

that the ringleader was her own son.  During the ten or twelve years that n=
ow intervened before=20

Blanche was again to take the regency during Saint Louis's crusade, her rol=
e in public life is of=20

less importance; there will be a fact in history to note here and there, bu=
t most of that which we=20

shall say concerns the woman, the mother, rather than the queen. Though emi=
nently fitted in=20

intellect and temperament for exercising the powers of an active ruler, Bla=
nche never forgot that=20

she was only the king's mother, and that she held the royal power in trust =
for him. In all her acts--

they were really done on her own responsibility--she sought to associate th=
e name of her son, as if=20

she would keep for him the honor. In that speech to Count Thibaud she does =
not reproach him for=20

ingratitude to her; it is, "you should have called to mind the great goodne=
ss of my son, the king."=20

Her whole life was devoted to the service of this son, whom she loved with =
a love painfully intense,=20

cruelly jealous.  When she was left a widow, there was entrusted to her not=
 merely the ruling of a=20

kingdom but the rearing of a large family of children. To this latter task =
Blanche devoted herself=20

with as much energy and as much good sense as she displayed in larger affai=
rs. She reared with=20

particular care the son who, though not the eldest, had become the heir to =
the crown. She tried to=20

make of him a good man. It was certainly not her training or her example th=
at taught him=20

excessive devoutness; for, though a good Christian, she was not a devotee. =
When he was a boy=20

she gave him over to the care of masters who were to instruct him in all th=
ings. There was physical=20

exercise and recreation as well as study; the young prince was not even exe=
mpt from discipline:=20

according to his own testimony, one of his masters "sometimes beat him to t=
each him discipline."=20

His days were regularly portioned off into periods of work, of play, and of=
 religious devotion; in the=20



midst of his teachers, most of whom were Dominicans, the little prince led =
a very sober life. He=20

was of a quiet and docile disposition, and received instruction willingly a=
nd readily, and became a=20

man of considerable learning. From his youth he manifested a tendency to ex=
treme piety, going=20

daily to church, where he entered into the services with strange fervor; he=
 sang no songs but=20

hymns, and led a pure and temperate life. It is said that a religious fanat=
ic, who had listened to=20

some of the calumnies circulated against the queen, one day came to her and=
 rebuked her bitterly=20

for encouraging her son to live a life of licentiousness, in the society of=
 concubines. She corrected=20

his mistaken impression, and said that if her son, whom she loved better th=
an any creature living,=20

were sick unto death she would not have him made whole by the commission of=
 a mortal sin. Saint=20

Louis never forgot this saying of his mother's, which he was fond of repeat=
ing to Joinville, and by=20

which he sought to regulate his conduct.  Another of Blanche's children was=
 of the same=20

disposition as Saint Louis in regard to religion. This was the Princess Isa=
belle, whom her mother=20

had trained as carefully as Louis. On one occasion, when the family was goi=
ng on a journey and=20

there was much noise of preparation in the midst of the packing, Isabelle c=
overed herself up in the=20

bedclothes in order to pray undisturbed. One of the servants, occupied in p=
acking, picked up child=20

and bedclothes together, and was about to put her with the rest of the bagg=
age, when she was=20

discovered. Even as a child she would take no part in games, and as a young=
 girl shunned all the=20

gayeties of the court, devoting herself to study, to reading the Scriptures=
, and to devotional and=20

charitable works, leading a life of the utmost austerity. It is pleasant to=
 know that this timid, pious=20

little lady was not forced into a distasteful union and passed her days in =
the pursuits she liked=20

best.  Blanche's devotion to her son Louis was repaid by the greatest defer=
ence and affection. Her=20

ascendency over him lasted as long as she lived, and was responsible, no do=
ubt, for much=20

unhappiness to his wife. Blanche's love was full of jealousy; she would bro=
ok no rival; she must=20

always be first in the affections of her son. And one cannot deny that the =
great queen was selfish=20

even to the point of positive cruelty in her treatment of Marguerite de Pro=
vence. A mere child when=20

she came to the court of France, Marguerite was made to feel that she was n=
ot to be first there,=20

though her position as the wife of Louis gave her a claim to first place. S=
he was not of masculine=20

temperament, like Blanche, and she did not seek even the show of power; but=
 Blanche grudged=20

her even the love of her husband, though we have no evidence that Marguerit=
e ever reproached=20

Saint Louis with excessive filial devotion or sought to detach him from his=
 mother. Many stories=20

have come down to us of how "the young queen" was treated by the one whom a=
ll France=20

continued to call "the Queen." From the testimony of those intimate with th=
e habits of the royal=20

family come to us details of espionage, petty malice, and cold-heartedness =
on the part of Blanche:=20

we could not believe these things if they came from less competent witnesse=
s. They are not to the=20

credit of Blanche, for they show the worst side of her nature. The confesso=
r of Saint Louis says:=20

"The queen mother displayed great harshness and rudeness towards Queen Marg=
uerite. She=20

would not permit the king to remain alone with his wife. When the king, wit=
h the two queens, went=20

in royal progress through France, Queen Blanche commonly separated the king=
 and the queen,=20

and they were never lodged together. It happened once that, at the manor of=
 Pontoise, the king=20

was lodged in a room above the lodging of his wife. He had instructed the u=
shers in the anteroom=20

that, whenever he was with the queen and Queen Blanche wished to enter his =
room or the=20

queen's, they should whip the dogs to make them bark; and when the king hea=
rd this he hid from=20



his mother." Imagine the King of France, the man whose peculiar piety won f=
or him the name of a=20

saint, dodging about like a guilty urchin to keep his mother from finding h=
im in the company of his=20

wife!  The honest old Sieur de Joinville, who feared not to tell his master=
 when he thought him in=20

the wrong, tells us that on one occasion, when Marguerite was very ill afte=
r the birth of a child,=20

Louis came in to see her, fearing she was in danger of death. Blanche came =
in, and Louis hid=20

himself behind the bed as well as he could, but she detected him. Taking hi=
m by the hand, she=20

said: "Come away, for you are doing no good here." She led him out of the r=
oom. "When the=20

queen saw that Queen Blanche was separating her from her husband, she cried=
 out with a loud=20

voice: 'Alas! will you let me see my husband neither in life nor in death?'=
 And so saying she fainted=20

away so that they thought she was dead; and the king, who thought so too, r=
an back to her and=20

brought her out of her swoon." There is nothing in these stories to the cre=
dit of Blanche or of her=20

saintly son.  Let us turn from this unpleasant picture to glance at some of=
 the facts in the domestic=20

economy of the royal household. The expenditures of the court were not grea=
t; the household was=20

kept on a scale befitting its rank, but there was no vain display. Besides =
the queen's children there=20

were always a number of dependents, ladies and gentlemen in waiting, etc., =
and the expenses for=20

the whole establishment were kept in a common account.  Blanche de Castille=
 loved her native=20

land, which she never saw again after she left it to become the wife of Lou=
is VIII., and she kept up=20

as active relations as possible with her relatives, particularly with Queen=
 Berengere; but she had=20

too much good sense to flood her court with Spanish dependents and Spanish =
customs, and,=20

therefore, we do not find a great number of Spaniards occupying important p=
osts in the court. A=20

certain number of her special attendants appear to have been Spaniards; we =
may note a lady in=20

waiting called Mincia, who is often mentioned in the accounts, and who is g=
ranted money and=20

horses for a journey into Spain. Then there are two Spaniards to whom gifts=
 of clothing and the=20

like are made at the time of the coronation of Queen Marguerite. But these =
and other Spaniards=20

whose names one can pick out belonged to the personal suite of the queen, a=
nd had nothing to do=20

with politics. There was nothing like the incursion of foreigners which, th=
e people complained,=20

Italianized France in the time of the Medicis.  Among the legitimate expend=
itures of the court, but=20

rather surprising in the household of a saint, are certain sums set down fo=
r the payment of=20

minstrels. Prince Robert of France loved to give presents to minstrels, and=
 when he was knighted,=20

in 1237, more than two hundred and twenty pounds went to the payment of the=
se singers. The=20

horses and their furnishings form no small item in the expenses, since most=
 of the travelling had to=20

be done on horseback, and a numerous retinue of mounted attendants must be =
provided.=20

Common pack horses were not costly, but the easy-riding palfrey and the war=
 horse ranged in=20

price from thirty to seventy-five pounds. There were carriages and other ve=
hicles also, though the=20

carriages were few. The state of the roads, indeed, often precluded their u=
se; we find Blanche de=20

Castille excusing herself from going to Saint-Denis because the state of he=
r health forbids her=20

going on horseback: the roads were probably impassable; or, perhaps, it was=
 in attempting this=20

little journey that her carriage suffered the damages recorded in a bill of=
 repairs of 1234, when it=20

seems the unlucky vehicle needed new wheels. There was a carriage for _la j=
eune reine_=20

Marguerite, too, and a new one was purchased in 1239.  Aside from the money=
 expended in the=20

actual maintenance of her family, Blanche herself spent, and taught Louis t=
o spend, considerable=20

sums in charity. With the miserable economic conditions prevailing in the M=
iddle Ages, poverty=20



must have been far more general and far more distressing than it has ever b=
een since those days.=20

During Blanche's regency the kingdom had been repeatedly ravaged in the cou=
rse of the wars of=20

the nobles, and there is record of famine, notably in the southwest of the =
kingdom, where one=20

chronicler asserts that in 1235 he saw a hundred bodies buried in one day i=
n a cemetery at=20

Limoges. On their frequent journeys throughout the country, Blanche and Lou=
is did what could be=20

done to alleviate the condition of the unfortunate, who gathered on the way=
side in crowds. There=20

were regular officers to allot the alms properly, and considerable sums wer=
e distributed, usually at=20

every stage on the journey. At home, in Paris, there was a regular distribu=
tion of money and of=20

bread, with occasional special bounties on the feasts of the Church. One sp=
ecial charity of Queen=20

Blanche's deserves notice. When a girl was to be married, one of the first =
questions was, and still=20

is, in France, what dower her parents could give with her; if the dower wer=
e insufficient, the poor=20

girl ran a serious risk of not being married at all. Blanche often came to =
the aid of deserving girls=20

so situated, and her gifts were not confined to her immediate attendants an=
d their families; for=20

example, a poor woman from Anet, a stranger to the court, received one hund=
red sous parisis for=20

the marriage of her daughter; and while on her way back from Angers, Blanch=
e met a young girl of=20

Nogent, to whom she gave fifteen pounds for her marriage.  Blanche had alwa=
ys been respectful=20

in her attitude toward the Church, and pious in her habit of life; but she =
was never servile in her=20

attitude toward churchmen, whom she would no more allow to interfere with h=
er rule than the=20

greatest of the barons. The higher clergy, as a body, were faithful to her;=
 but, here and there,=20

bishops and archbishops arrogated to themselves powers not theirs, or refus=
ed to recognize the=20

rights of the crown, whereupon Blanche did not hesitate to join issue with =
them. One celebrated=20

case is that of the riots at Beauvais, in 1233, when, under Blanche's direc=
tion, Louis restored order=20

and asserted the royal power in spite of the objections of the bishop, and =
continued to sustain the=20

position taken, even after an interdict had been proclaimed in Beauvais.  D=
uring the period=20

between her two regencies, Blanche continued to reside at the court; her je=
alousy of Marguerite=20

would in part account for her preferring this to retirement to some one of =
the chateaux belonging to=20

her private estate. At the time, it must be remembered, the queen of Philip=
pe Auguste, Ingeburge,=20

was living in this way at Orleans. Queen Blanche, indeed, enjoyed a conside=
rable revenue from=20

her estates, which she generally intrusted to the care of the Knights Templ=
ars, the financial agents=20

of many a crowned head in Europe. Part of her estates she administered in p=
erson. As a further=20

occupation, she devoted herself to various charities. In 1242 the famous ab=
bey of Notre Dame,=20

generally known as Maubuisson, at Pontoise, was completed, thanks to the qu=
een's munificence=20

and to her careful supervision. Maubuisson, with its many dependencies, its=
 beautiful gardens and=20

buildings, became one of the most splendid monastic institutions in France.=
 It was frequently=20

visited and enriched with new gifts by its foundress and her son, and noble=
 ladies chose it as the=20

place to take the veil. One of these ladies, Countess Alix de Macon, became=
 abbess of another=20

convent, Notre Dame du Lys, near Melun, founded by Blanche de Castille.  Th=
e management of=20

her estates and the foundation of convents did not, however, monopolize the=
 queen's time and=20

energies; she was always the careful mother, looking out for the interests =
of her children, and=20

always the queen, ready to act or to decide promptly and firmly in the affa=
irs of the kingdom. She=20

arranged the marriages of her sons, Robert and Alphonse. The former married=
, in 1237, Mahaut,=20

daughter of the Duke of Brabant, and there were magnificent festivities at =
Compiegne in honor of=20



the event, the young prince being knighted and made Count of Artois. Alphon=
se, betrothed to the=20

daughter of Raymond of Toulouse, was married in 1238. The next year Blanche=
 provided a rich=20

and most desirable bride for her nephew, Alphonse de Portugal, who had been=
 reared at the=20

French court. He married the widow of Philippe Hurepel, Mahaut de Boulogne,=
 and was a faithful=20

vassal of France until he became King of Portugal in 1248. For each of thes=
e weddings Blanche=20

saw that there was suitable provision in the way of new and elegant clothes=
 and entertainments in=20

keeping with the occasion.  [Illustration 5: BLANCHE OF CASTILLE, MOTHER OF=
 SAINT LOUIS.=20

After the painting by Moreau de Tours. Aside from the money expended in the=
 actual maintenance=20

of her family, Blanche herself spent, and taught Louis to spend, considerab=
le sums in charity. With=20

the miserable economic conditions prevailing in the Middle Ages, poverty mu=
st have been far=20

more general and far more distressing than it has ever been since those day=
s. On their frequent=20

journeys throughout the country, Blanche and Louis did what could be done t=

condition of the unfortunate, who gathered on the wayside. At home, in Pari=
s, there was a regular=20

distribution of-money and of bread, with occasional special bounties on the=
 feasts of the Church.]=20

In the larger world, Louis IX. still sought the counsel of his mother: "He =
sought her presence in his=20

council, whenever he could have it with profit or advantage." In judicial p=
roceedings particularly,=20

we still find her acting in her sovereign capacity; and she continued to ke=
ep an eye upon those=20

who had formerly been the rebel barons, her name being associated with that=
 of Louis in various=20

acts concerning the shifty Pierre Mauclerc. For her unfortunate cousin, Ray=
mond of Toulouse, she=20

still exerted her influence with the Pope to obtain some relief from the ob=
ligation which he had=20

been forced to assume of spending five years in the Holy Land. It was at hi=
s mother's instance,=20

too, that Louis IX. bought from the young Emperor Baldwin of Constantinople=
 those most holy=20

relics, the Crown of Thorns and the large portion of the true Cross, to rec=
eive which Louis built the=20

beautiful Sainte-Chapelle. The purchase was really arranged as an excuse fo=
r contributing largely=20

to the depleted treasury of the Christian Empire of the East, whose emperor=
 was doubly related to=20

Saint Louis through his father and through Blanche de Castille. The Crown o=
f Thorns, indeed, had=20

been in pawn to Venice. Louis and Blanche went to meet the sacred relic, wh=
ich was escorted to=20

its resting place in Paris by great crowds singing hymns and displaying eve=
ry mark of the utmost=20

reverence. For the piece of the Cross, bought three years later, in 1241, t=
he same elaborate=20

ceremonial was observed; and in the great procession which accompanied Sain=
t Louis as he bore=20

the Cross on his shoulders through the streets of Paris walked Blanche and =
Marguerite,=20

barefooted.  When the Tartar hordes of Ghenghis Khan overran Poland and Hun=
gary, the whole of=20

Christian Europe trembled with fear and horror. If these barbarians could n=
ot be checked, and they=20

continued to pour in resistless floods over the land, what was to become of=
 Christendom? "What=20

shall we do, my son?" cried Blanche; "what will become of us?" "Fear not, m=
other," replied the=20

brave king; "let us trust in Heaven." And then he added that famous pun whi=
ch all his biographers=20

repeat: "If these Tartars come upon us, either we shall send them back to T=
artarus, whence they=20

came, or they will send us all to Heaven."  Out of this threatening of the =
Tartars grew a religious=20

persecution, in which Blanche took a part not discreditable to her. When th=
ings went wrong in the=20

Middle Ages, it was the fault of the weak and oppressed; if it was not the =
witches, it was the Jews=20

who had brought misfortune upon the land, and who must be punished before G=
od would be=20

pleased again. In this case it was the Jews, who were accused of lending ai=
d to the Tartars. The=20



popular odium incurred by this accusation encouraged the prosecution of an =
investigation, ordered=20

by Pope Gregory IX., into the doctrines of the Talmud. France appears to ha=
ve been the only=20

country where the investigation was actually made. Several Jewish rabbis we=
re haled before the=20

court, presided over by Blanche, to explain and answer for their books. The=
 fairness with which=20

Blanche presided is indeed remarkable when one remembers the severity of th=
e common judicial=20

procedure of the time. The chief rabbi, Yehiel, appealed to her several tim=
es against the injustice=20

of being forced to answer certain questions, and she sustained his plea. Wh=
en Yehiel complained=20

that, whatever the court decided, he and his people could not be protected =
from the blind rage of=20

the populace, Blanche replied: "Say no more of that. We are resolved to pro=
tect you, you and all=20

your goods, and he who dares to persecute you will be held a criminal." Whe=
n he protested=20

against taking an oath demanded by his persecutors, because it was against =
his conscience to=20

swear, Blanche decided: "Since it is painful to him, and since he has never=
 taken an oath, do not=20

insist upon it." She reproved the Christian advocates, the learned doctors =
of the Church, for the=20

unseemly violence of their language, and sought in every way to maintain so=
me sort of impartiality,=20

or at least of decency, in the trial. If she had conducted the trial to the=
 close, there might have=20

been a different sentence from that which condemned the Talmud and ordered =
it to be committed=20

to the flames.  It was through an agent of Blanche, apparently a burgess of=
 Rochelle, that Saint=20

Louis obtained most valuable and timely information in regard to the rebell=
ious preparations of=20

Hugues de Lusignan, Comte de la Marche. This Hugues de Lusignan was the vas=
sal of Alphonse,=20

brother of the king. He had always been inclined to revolt, and this inclin=
ation was not lessened by=20

the incitement of his wife, the haughty, high-tempered Isabelle d'Angouleme=
, widow of King John=20

of England. To have started as Queen of England, on an equal footing with h=
er contemporary,=20

Blanche de Castille, to have seen her miserable husband gradually lose his =
rich possessions in=20

France, and to find herself now merely a countess and compelled to do homag=
e to a son of her=20

rival,--this must have been the very wormwood of bitterness for Isabelle. T=
he secret agent of=20

Queen Blanche writes a very elaborate account of the conduct of Isabelle an=
d Hugues in 1242.=20

Hearing that Hugues had received King Louis and his brother, Alphonse, in h=
er absence, Isabelle=20

carried off part of her property and established herself in Angouleme. For =
three days she refused=20

to admit her husband to her presence, and when he did appear she lashed him=
 with her tongue in=20

furious fashion: "You miserable man, did you not see how things went at Poi=
tiers, when I had to=20

dance attendance for three days upon your King and your Queen? When at last=
 I was admitted to=20

their presence, there sat the King on one side of the royal bed and the Que=
en on the other.... They=20

did not summon me; they did not offer me a seat, and that on purpose to hum=
iliate me before the=20

court. There was I, like a miserable, despised servant, standing up in fron=
t of them in the crowd.=20

Neither at my entry nor at my exit did they make any show of rising, in mer=
e contempt of me and=20

of you, too, as you ought to have had sense enough to see." After scenes of=
 this kind in the bosom=20

of his family it is not surprising that the unfortunate Comte de la Marche =
sought the more peaceful=20

atmosphere of the camp, and engaged in a revolt against his sovereign. Loui=
s, however, had little=20

difficulty in bringing him to reason and obtaining another victory over Eng=
land, whom the rebels=20

had enlisted on their side. "And it was no marvel," says Joinville, writing=
 of this campaign of Saint=20

Louis's, "for he acted according to the advice of the good mother who was w=
ith him."  One of the=20

severest trials in the life of this _bonne mere_ was approaching. Louis, al=
ways of a delicate=20



constitution, had contracted a fever during the campaign against the Comte =
de la Marche, and the=20

effects lingered with him until, at the close of 1244, he had a violent rec=
urrence of the attack,=20

accompanied by dysentery. In spite of the tender care of Blanche, his life =
was despaired of. He=20

lost consciousness and, says Joinville, to whom we shall leave the telling =
of the story, "was in=20

such extremity that one of the ladies watching by him wished to draw the sh=
eet over his face, and=20

said that he was dead. And another lady, who was on the other side of the b=
ed, would not suffer it,=20

but said that there was still life in him. And as He heard the discussion b=
etween these two ladies,=20

Our Lord had compassion on him, and gave him back his health. And as soon a=
s he could speak=20

he demanded that they give him the Cross; and so it was done. Then the quee=
n, his mother, heard=20

that the power of speech had returned to him, and she showed therefore as g=
reat joy as she=20

could. And when she knew that he had taken the Cross, as he himself told he=
r, she showed as=20

great grief as if she had seen him dead."  Blanche's grief was not without =
cause, for nothing short=20

of the death of this well-beloved son could have caused her the pain that s=
he must endure if he=20

went on the crusade. Not only her age, but the knowledge that he would wish=
 her to stay behind=20

and guard the kingdom for him, precluded all thought of her accompanying hi=
m. It meant=20

separation from him on whom she had all her life lavished an affection litt=
le short of idolatry. How=20

bitterly must she have regretted encouraging that fervent piety that now le=
d to a sacrifice, in the=20

name of his religion, of all that the king, the son, the husband ought to h=
old most dear. At a time=20

when, under the persistent efforts of his grandfather, his father, and his =
mother, the power of the=20

crown had just begun to be firmly established, Louis must reverse all this =
policy, or rather must=20

make use of it not to the profit of his kingdom but to that of fanatical re=
ligious ideals. Blanche was=20

too good a politician not to understand this, and too sensible not to deplo=
re it. Louis's duty lay in=20

France; he had everything to lose, nothing to gain, in a crusade; though Bl=
anche knew too well the=20

relentless doggedness with which he would cling to what he conceived to be =
his duty to God,=20

nevertheless she pleaded with him to give up the idea of going on the crusa=
de.  The pleading of=20

his mother and of his wife could not turn Saint Louis from his design, nor =
was the advice of his=20

councillors more effective. For three years, however, other matters occupie=
d his attention, though=20

the preparations for his holy war were not forgotten. When these preparatio=
ns began to be=20

undertaken with more vigor a fresh attempt was made to dissuade him. The Bi=
shop of Paris one=20

day said to him: "Do you remember, sire, that when you received the cross, =
when you made=20

suddenly and without reflection so momentous a vow, you were weak and troub=
led in spirit, which=20

took from your words the weight of truth and responsibility? Now is come th=
e time to seek release=20

from this obligation. Our lord, the Pope, who knows the needs of your kingd=
om, would gladly give=20

you a dispensation from your vow." And then he pointed out the peculiar dan=
ger of undertaking=20

such an enterprise in the existing disturbed state of Europe. Blanche was p=
resent, watching with=20

anxious countenance the effect of this subtle appeal. "My son, my son!" she=
 said, "remember how=20

sweet it is to God to see a son obedient to his mother; and never did mothe=
r give her child better=20

counsel than I give you. You have no need to trouble yourself about the Hol=
y Land; if you will but=20

stay in your own land, which will prosper in your presence, we shall be abl=
e to send thither more=20

men and more money than if your country were suffering and weakened by your=
 absence." Louis=20

listened silently, thought earnestly a moment, and then replied: "You say t=
hat I was not myself=20

when I took the cross. Very well, since you so wish, I lay it aside; I give=
 it back to you." With his=20



own hand he took the sacred symbol from his shoulder and surrendered it to =
the bishop. Then,=20

while those present had hardly recovered from their delight and astonishmen=
t, he spoke again:=20

"Friends, now surely I am not lacking in sense, I am not weak or troubled i=
n spirit; I demand my=20

cross again; He Who knows all things knows that no food shall pass my lips =
until the cross is=20

placed once more on my shoulder."  There was no turning aside a man of such=
 character; the=20

preparations for the crusade went on, and Saint Louis raised the Oriflamme =
at Saint-Denis on=20

June 12, 1248. We shall not tell of the crusade or of Louis's characteristi=
c conscientiousness in=20

seeing, before he left, that reparation was made for every act of injustice=
 done in his kingdom, for=20

which purpose he sent out a commission charged with holding an inquest in a=
ll parts of France.=20

The inevitable day of separation came, the day to which Blanche looked forw=
ard as the last upon=20

which she would see her son. She accompanied him for the first three or fou=
r days of his journey,=20

which lay through southern France to Aigues-Mortes, and at Corbeil she rece=
ived the regency,=20

with power to act in the government through what agents she pleased and in =
what way she=20

pleased. The guardianship of his children, too, Louis left to Blanche. At C=
luni came the scene of=20

final separation; the grief of Blanche can be imagined, and words would fai=
l to help us to a=20

realization of its intense sincerity. Her premonition was well founded; she=
 was not to live to see=20

Louis again.  Once more was Blanche de Castille regent of France, a heavy b=
urden for one who=20

had lived a life of no easy indulgence and who was now sixty years of age. =
Instead of peace and=20

rest in her declining years--perchance she had hoped to retire to her own c=
onvent of Maubuisson--

she must undertake the cares of government. Truly, Saint Louis was sacrific=
ing his mother for an=20

ambition, albeit not a vain or selfish ambition, and whatever service he ma=
y have rendered God by=20

killing some hundreds of Mohammedans in Egypt, there is no question about t=
he service Blanche=20

was rendering to him and France.  To aid Blanche in her government, and als=
o to collect an=20

additional force for the crusade, Louis had left in France his brother, Alp=
honse de Poitiers, who=20

was of real assistance to his mother. The other sons, however, Robert d'Art=
ois and Charles=20

d'Anjou, had sailed with the crusaders for Egypt. Blanche's first anxiety c=
ame from Henry III., who=20

chose this opportunity to make warlike preparations, after he had refused t=
o renew the truce with=20

France, and who had been besieging Saint Louis with preposterous demands fo=
r the restoration of=20

his lost provinces. But Henry contented himself with preparations, being pe=
rhaps held in check by=20

fear of the Church, which threatened an interdict on all England if he vent=
ured to attack France=20

while the king was away fighting in her behalf. Relieved of this anxiety, B=
lanche was free to=20

concentrate her efforts in procuring assistance for Saint Louis. But the wo=
rldly-minded Pope=20

Innocent IV. was so busily engaged in his contest with the Emperor Frederic=
k II. that he had little=20

but prayers and blessings to bestow upon the crusading king; while Frederic=
k was either unable or=20

unwilling to contribute more than a mere pittance. At the close of the summ=
er of 1249, Alphonse=20

de Poitiers embarked on his voyage to lead to his brother the considerable =
army he had been able=20

to collect. This was a new separation for Blanche, and one that involved he=
r, almost at once, in the=20

conduct of new and rather complex political problems.  Scarcely a month aft=
er the departure of=20

Alphonse de Poitiers, his father-in-law, Count Raymond of Toulouse, died, l=
eaving as his only heir=20

his daughter's husband. Blanche immediately took steps to secure to her son=
 the succession,=20

even before she was requested to do so by a message from him. Under the ter=
ms of the treaty of=20

1229, she took possession of the estates of the count, and appointed commis=
sioners to receive=20



the homage of the vassals on behalf of Alphonse.  Meanwhile, good news had =
come from Louis,=20

who had landed in Egypt and had taken Damietta. Frequent letters passed bet=
ween the queen=20

and her son; but letters were slow in reaching their destination, and the q=
ueen was still rejoicing=20

over the good news when Saint Louis and his army were in desperate plight. =
At last came the=20

letter telling of the disastrous battle of Mansourah,--a victory in name, b=
ut as costly in its=20

consequences as a defeat,--February 8, 1250, and of the death of the impetu=
ous Robert d'Artois.=20

His army was reduced by disease and incessant skirmishes with the infidels =
and Saint Louis=20

himself fell sick. There was no Blanche de Castille, no tender mother, no w=
ife there to nurse him=20

back to health.  We have mentioned the wife of Saint Louis, and it may be a=
s well to complete=20

here her part in this story. She had accompanied her husband on the crusade=
, but had been left=20

behind in Damietta with a strong garrison when Louis marched on to Mansoura=
h. When the king=20

was captured by the infidels, Marguerite lay ill in Damietta, hourly expect=
ing the birth of her child.=20

When the first messengers came with the news of the captivity of her husban=
d she refused to=20

believe them, and, it is said, had the unfortunates hanged as the bearers o=
f false news; but there=20

was soon no doubt that disaster had overtaken the Christian arms. Marguerit=
e was half crazed=20

with pain and fear; even in her sleep she fancied that the room was full of=
 Saracens bent on killing=20

her, and she would cry out pitifully, "Help! help!" She made an old knight,=
 over eighty years of age,=20

keep guard at the foot of her bed. Before the birth of her child she called=
 this old man to her,=20

sending everyone else from the room, and threw herself on her knees before =
him, begging him to=20

grant her one boon she would ask. "Sir knight," she said, "I enjoin you, by=
 the faith you have sworn=20

to me, that, if the Saracens should take this town you will cut off my head=
 before they can capture=20

me." And the good knight, with a sternness characteristic of the age, repli=
ed that he would surely=20

do as she bid him, for he had already resolved to kill her rather than see =
her become a Saracen=20

captive.  A son was born to the queen; in memory of the misery of these day=
s she named him=20

Jean Tristan. On the very day of the child's birth she learned that the Gen=
oese and Pisan sailors,=20

and some of the garrison, were preparing to abandon Damietta. It was a seri=
ous danger; for, the=20

fleet once gone, what chance of rescue, or even of return to France, was th=
ere for the king and his=20

army? In the midst of her pain Marguerite acted with a promptitude and deci=
sion far greater than=20

one could have hoped for from the rather colorless, yielding woman who had =
so long submitted to=20

the domination of her mother-in-law. She sent for the ringleaders, and beso=
ught them for God's=20

sake not to imperil the safety of the king and the whole army: "Have pity, =
at least, upon this poor=20

woman, lying here in pain, and wait but till she can get up again." Then, l=
earning that they had just=20

cause of complaint in that they could not get food, she took the responsibi=
lity of purchasing what=20

provisions could be had and of feeding the sailors at the king's expense. H=
er prompt action saved=20

the fleet for Louis. Even as it was, Damietta had to be evacuated, as one o=
f the conditions of his=20

being released, and Queen Marguerite was compelled to sail for Acre before =
she had entirely=20

regained her health.  Once released and safe at Acre, Saint Louis was urged=
 to return at once to=20

France, whither the dreadful news of his disaster had already gone to distr=
ess Blanche de Castille;=20

but he had left a large part of his followers prisoners in the hands of the=
 infidels, and under such=20

circumstances it was useless to urge this truly noble monarch to consider h=
is own wishes, or his=20

own interests. He called a counsel of his barons, and announced to them: "I=
 have come to the=20

conclusion that, if I stay, my kingdom is in no danger of going to destruct=
ion, for Madame the=20



Queen has many men to defend it with." He had good reason to rely upon _Mad=
ame la reine_,=20

who had kept his heritage for him when he could not have kept it for himsel=
f. Sending back to=20

France his brothers, Alphonse de Poitiers and Charles d'Anjou, Saint Louis =
lingered on in Syria.=20

Blanche continued to rule France and to make every effort to succor her son=
 in his perilous=20

position. The death of Frederick II., in December, 1250, gave a momentary h=
ope of obtaining=20

assistance from the empire or from the Pope. But this hope was soon dashed,=
 for Innocent IV. was=20

bent on continuing his quarrel with Frederick's successor, Conrad. Blanche,=
 moreover, was=20

seriously ill in the early part of 1251 so ill that the Pope wrote to disco=
urage her from attempting to=20

journey to Lyons to see him. "Your life," he wrote, "is the safeguard of so=
 many people that you=20

should use every endeavor and take every care to preserve or to recover the=
 health which means=20

so much to all." With all the benedictions and affectionate solicitude cont=
ained in this letter, the=20

Pope was not disposed to give material assistance to Saint Louis. On the co=
ntrary, he ordered the=20

preaching of a crusade, even in Brabant and Flanders, against the Christian=
 emperor who was his=20

political rival, and promised greater rewards to those who would engage in =
it than to those who=20

were fighting the infidels. Blanche called a council of her vassals, who br=
oke forth in violent wrath=20

against the selfish and un-Christian conduct of the head of the Church. No =
doubt Blanche shared=20

their resentment, and it is even reported that she ordered the confiscation=
 of the goods of those=20

who ventured to engage in the Pope's crusade against the emperor, saying: "=
Let those who are=20

fighting for the Pope be maintained by the Pope, and go to return no more."=
  While the affairs of=20

the Church were in this state a new and dangerous movement of the common pe=
ople, a=20

movement half religious in nature, came to disturb France. A strange man, o=
f wonderful=20

eloquence, and exercising a powerful influence upon the peasantry, made his=
 appearance in=20

northern France. In a few weeks he had gathered veritable armies of the pea=
sants, the=20

_pastoureaux_, as they were called, who marched about the country after the=
ir mysterious leader,=20

known only by the name of "the Master of Hungary," proclaiming that they wo=
uld go to the aid of=20

their good king. At first they committed no damage, but, growing bolder and=
 becoming=20

contaminated by a certain mixture of the more dangerous elements of the pop=
ulation, they began=20

to manifest a peculiar unfriendliness toward priests, and soon passed to ac=
tual acts of violence.=20

The Master of Hungary arrogated to himself powers almost miraculous, and th=
e people believed in=20

him. At Amiens, the first large town entered by the Pastoureaux, people sou=
ght out this man and=20

knelt before him as if he had been a holy personage. But the priests circul=
ated all sorts of stories=20

about him: he was a magician in league with the devil; he was an apostate C=
hristian, an infidel,=20

nay, an emissary of the sultan of Egypt, charged with delivering into the h=
ands of the Saracens a=20

host of Christian prisoners. But, impostor or no impostor, the people had f=
aith in him, and it was in=20

vain for the priests to repeat or to concoct tales of his being an infidel:=
 the very people of the most=20

Christian nation in Europe were sullenly murmuring against Christ Himself. =
When the begging=20

friars asked for alms the people snarled a refusal at them and, calling the=
 first poor person in sight,=20

gave alms, saying: "Take that; in the name of Mohammed, who is greater than=
 Christ."  The=20

Master of Hungary and his satellites, preaching against the clergy and inci=
ting to acts of violence,=20

performing all the functions of priests and even claiming to perform miracl=
es, advanced with their=20

hordes of ignorant or vicious followers to Paris. What attitude would Blanc=
he take? She had=20

always had a heart to feel for the woes of the common people, and she well =
knew that the priests=20



were not by any means always the friends of the poor, for she was not so bl=
inded by religiosity as=20

to think that the clerical habit alone could make a mere man something more=
 than a man. At this=20

particular time, too, she had reason to feel vexed with the clergy; was it =
not the Church itself that=20

was most niggardly of funds to carry on the war in defence of the holy plac=
es? She was far too=20

sensible a woman to look for any material help from this rabble which vowed=
 to go to the rescue of=20

the good king; but she was not disposed to interfere with them until she ha=
d definite proof of their=20

wrongdoing. One can but suspect that she did not credit all that the priest=
s reported to her of them;=20

she herself had known and in some ways liked Raymond of Toulouse, whom the =
priests made out=20

an arch fiend.  When the Pastoureaux approached Paris, therefore, she gave =
orders that they=20

should not be interfered with. Sending for the Master of Hungary, she treat=
ed him with respect,=20

asked him questions, and sent him back with some presents. The man lost his=
 head with vainglory=20

at this reception. Returning to his followers he announced that he had so t=
horoughly enchanted=20

the queen and her people that she would approve of anything they did, and t=
hat they might kill=20

priests with impunity. In episcopal robes, the mitre on his head, he preach=
ed in the church of St.=20

Eustace. Riots were precipitated by his followers, and the vast army moved =
on to the south,=20

growing more and more outrageous=20


_
The last-mentioned project meant that, after two years of immunity, the Sou=
thwest had become a=20

main theater of the war. There was plenty of warning of what was coming, fo=
r the British squadron=20

intended for the attack began assembling in the West Indies before the clos=
e of summer. No one=20

knew, however, where or when the blow would fall. To Jackson the first nece=
ssity seemed to be to=20

make sure of the defenses of Mobile. For a time, at all events, he believed=
 that the attack would be=20

made there, rather than at New Orleans; and an attempt of a British naval f=
orce in September to=20

destroy Fort Bowyer, at the entrance to Mobile Bay, confirmed his opinion. =
 But the chief attraction=20

of Mobile for the General was its proximity to Florida. In July he had writ=
ten to Washington asking=20

permission to occupy Pensacola. Months passed without a reply. Temptation t=
o action grew; and=20

when, in October, three thousand Tennessee troops arrived under one of the =
subordinate officers=20

in the recent Creek War, longer hesitation seemed a sign of weakness. Jacks=
on therefore led his=20

forces against the Spanish stronghold, now in British hands, and quickly fo=
rced its surrender. His=20

men blew up one of the two forts, and the British blew up the other. Within=
 a week the work was=20

done and the General, well pleased with his exploit, was back at Mobile. Th=
ere he found awaiting=20

him, in reply to his July letter, an order from the new Secretary of War, J=
ames Monroe, forbidding=20

him to touch Pensacola. No great harm was done, for the invaded territory w=
as no longer neutral=20

soil, and the task of soothing the ruffled feelings of the Spanish court di=
d not prove difficult.  As the=20

autumn wore on, signs multiplied that the first British objective in the So=
uth was to be New=20

Orleans, and no efforts were spared by the authorities at Washington to aro=
use the Southwest to=20

its danger and to stimulate an outpouring of troops sufficient to repel any=
 force that might be=20

landed at the mouth of the Mississippi. On the 21st of November, Jackson se=
t out for the menaced=20

city. Five days later a fleet of fifty vessels, carrying ten thousand veter=
an British troops under=20

command of Generals Pakenham and Gibbs, started from Jamaica for what was e=
xpected to be=20

an easy conquest. On the 10th of December the hostile armada cast anchor of=
f the Louisiana=20

coast. Two weeks later some two thousand redcoats emerged from Lake Borgne,=
 within six or=20

seven miles of New Orleans, when the approach to the city on that side was =
as yet unguarded by=20

a gun or a man or an entrenchment.  That the "impossible" was now accomplis=
hed was due=20

mainly to Jackson, although credit must not be withheld from a dozen energe=
tic subordinate=20

officers nor from the thousands of patriots who made up the rank and file o=
f the hastily gathered=20

forces of defense. Men from Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, and =
Tennessee--all=20

contributed to one of the most remarkable military achievements in our hist=
ory; although when the=20

fight was over it was found that hundreds were still as unarmed as when the=
y arrived upon the=20

scene.  A preliminary clash, in a dense fog, on the second evening before C=
hristmas served to=20

inspire each army with a wholesome respect for the other. The Blanche saw t=
hat it was time to act;=20

she had made a mistake in supposing these people to be harmless, misguided =
peasants or=20

religious enthusiasts. Orders were given to pursue and exterminate them. Sc=
attered bands were=20

overtaken here and there and dispersed, and the leaders were summarily hang=
ed. But the final=20

catastrophe was to take place at or near Bourges. The Pastoureaux having en=
tered this town,=20

engaged in looting and rapine, and the royal officers, thinking to confine =
them in the town, shut the=20

gates; but the Pastoureaux broke these down, and poured out of the town, pu=
rsued by the=20

enraged citizens. They were overtaken and brought to bay, and a veritable m=
assacre, rather than=20

a battle, ensued, for most of the Pastoureaux were poorly armed. The Master=
 of Hungary was=20



slain and torn in pieces, while his forces were dispersed. In a few weeks t=
he country was quiet=20

again. Only a few of the Pastoureaux really received the cross from those w=
ho had proper=20

authority to give it, and went to the aid of Saint Louis.  During these yea=
rs we find Queen Blanche=20

acting very frequently in a judicial capacity, presiding over the court of =
Parliament and over the=20

council; she seems to have continued to take an active part in all the affa=
irs of her government.=20

And, strange to say, we do not find the name of any one counsellor exalted =
above the others, as a=20

greater favorite or as more relied on by the queen; she has her ministers, =
but so little part do they=20

seem to play that France is really ruled by the queen, not by the ministers=
. We comment upon this=20

because it is remarkable, especially when we remember that, even with great=
 kings, the names of=20

the ministers are not often utterly obscured.  The most interesting of the =
queen's activities at this=20

time are those connected with the Church; there are numberless little quarr=
els in which she had to=20

intervene and hold out for the rights of the crown, but the two examples th=
at follow will suffice to=20

show the sort of thing with which she had to contend. The clergy of France =
had accorded to Saint=20

Louis a tax of one-tenth on their property, in view' of his crusade. Though=
 this tax had been long=20

due, the Abbey of Cluni, one of the richest and one of the most favored by =
the royal family,=20

allowed month after month to elapse without making any move to pay. At leng=
th, in the early part=20

of 1252, while the abbot was away in England, the royal bailli of Ma'am sei=
zed the chateau of=20

Lourdon, belonging to the Abbey of Cluni. There was a tremendous uproar in =
the clerical camp;=20

the Pope himself wrote to protest against this outrage upon the servants of=
 God, and demanded of=20

Blanche the restitution of the sequestered chateau. At the same time he ins=
tructed the Archbishop=20

of Bourges to launch an interdict against all those who continued to hold, =
to guard, or to inhabit the=20

chateau of Lourdon, with special exception of the queen and her family. Bla=
nche had not, it=20

appears, given the bailli any orders with regard to the collection of the t=
ax, but, since he had acted,=20

she sustained him; there was no persuading her to return the property of th=
e abbey until the abbot=20

had satisfied her just claims. The Pope and the abbot were compelled to acc=
ept defeat for the=20


_
The British army was a splendid body of seven thousand trained soldiers, se=
amen, and marines.=20

There were regiments which had helped Wellington to win Talavera, Salamanca=
, and Victoria, and=20

within a few short months some of these same regiments were to stand in tha=
t thin red line which=20

Ney and Napoleon's guard could never break. Their general, Pakenham, Wellin=
gton's brother-in-

law, was a distinguished pupil of his illustrious kinsman. Could frontiersm=
en who had never fought=20

together before, who had never seen the face of a civilized foe, withstand =
the conquerors of=20

Napoleon? But two branches of the same stubborn race were represented on th=
at little watery=20

plain. The soldiers trained to serve the strongest will in the Old World we=
re face to face with the=20

rough and ready yeomanry embattled for defense by the one man of the new wo=
rld whose soul=20

had most iron in it. It was Salamanca against Tohopeka, discipline against =
individual alertness, the=20

Briton of the little Isle against the Briton of the wastes and wilds. But t=
here was one great=20

difference. Wellington, "the Iron Duke," was not there; "Old Hickory" was e=
verywhere along the=20

American lines.    Brown, Andrew Jackson, pp. 75-76.  Behind their battery-=
studded parapets the=20

Americans waited for the British to make an assault. This the invaders did,=
 five thousand strong,=20

on January 8, 1815. The fighting was hard, but the main attack failed at ev=
ery point. Three British=20

major generals, including Pakenham, were killed early in the action, and th=
e total British loss=20

exceeded two thousand. The American loss was but seventy-one. The shattered=
 foe fell back, lay=20

inactive for ten days, and then quietly withdrew as they had come. Though J=
ackson was not noted=20

for piety, he always believed that his success on this occasion was the wor=
k of Providence.=20

"Heaven, to be sure," he wrote to Monroe, "has interposed most wonderfully =
in our behalf, and I=20

am filled with gratitude when I look back to what we have escaped."  By cur=
ious irony, the victory=20

had no bearing upon the formal results of the war. A treaty of peace had be=
en signed at Ghent two=20

weeks before, and the news of the pacification and of the exploit at New Or=
leans reached the=20

distracted President at almost the same time. But who shall say that the ba=
ttle was not one of the=20

most momentous in American history? It compensated for a score of humiliati=
ons suffered by the=20

country in the preceding years. It revived the people's drooping pride and =
put new energy into the=20

nation's dealings with its rivals, contributing more than any other single =
event to make this war=20

indeed a "second war of independence." "Now," declared Henry Clay when the =
news reached him=20

in Paris, "I can go to England without mortification." Finally, the battle =
brought Andrew Jackson=20

into his own as the idol and incarnation of the West, and set the western d=
emocracy decisively=20

forward as a force to be reckoned with in national affairs.     CHAPTER III=
 THE "CONQUEST" OF=20

FLORIDA  The victory at New Orleans made Jackson not only the most popular =
man in the United=20

States but a figure of international interest. "Napoleon, returning from El=
ba to eke out the Hundred=20

Days and add the name Waterloo to history, paused now and then a moment to =
study Jackson at=20

New Orleans. The Duke of Wellington, chosen by assembled Europe to meet the=
 crisis, could find=20

time even at Brussels to call for 'all available information on the abortiv=
e expedition against=20

Louisiana.'"    Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, Vol II, pp. 94-95.  While=
 his countrymen were=20

sounding his praises, the General, however, fell into a controversy with th=
e authorities and people=20

of New Orleans which lent a drab aspect to the closing scene of an otherwis=
e brilliant drama. One=20

of his first acts upon arriving in the defenseless city had been to declare=
 martial law; and under the=20

decree the daily life of the inhabitants had been rigorously circumscribed,=
 citizens had been=20

pressed into military service, men under suspicion had been locked up, and =
large quantities of=20



cotton and other supplies had been seized for the soldiers' use. When Paken=
ham's army was=20

defeated, people expected an immediate return to normal conditions. Jackson=
, however, proposed=20

to take no chances. Neither the sailing of the British fleet nor the receip=
t of the news of peace from=20

Admiral Cochrane influenced him to relax his vigilance, and only after offi=
cial instructions came=20

from Washington in the middle of March was the ban lifted.  Meanwhile a vio=
lent quarrel had=20

broken out between the commander and the civil authorities, who naturally w=
ished to resume their=20

accustomed functions. Finding that the Creoles were systematically evading =
service by registering=20

as French citizens, Jackson abruptly ordered all such people from the city;=
 and he was responsible=20

for numerous other arbitrary acts. Protests were lodged, and some people th=
reatened judicial=20

proceedings. But they might have saved their breath. Jackson was not the ma=
n to argue matters=20

of the kind. A leading Creole who published an especially pointed protest w=
as clapped into prison,=20

and when the Federal district judge, Hall, issued a writ of habeas corpus i=
n his behalf, Jackson=20

had him also shut up.  As soon as he was liberated, the irate judge summone=
d Jackson into court=20

to show why he should not be held in contempt. Beyond a blanket vindication=
 of his acts, the=20

General would not plead. "I will not answer interrogatories," he declared. =
"I may have erred, but=20

my motives cannot be misinterpreted." The judge thereupon imposed a fine of=
 one was dead a=20

claim was made for indemnity, which we can only hope Saint Louis did not gr=
ant.  Another=20

instance in which Blanche intervened is even more to her credit, since it w=
as pure humanity, not=20

the jealous safeguarding of the rights of the crown, that moved her. The in=
habitants of the villages=20

of Orly, Chatenay, and some others were serfs of the canons of Notre Dame. =
Being unable to pay=20

some tax imposed by their masters, the men of the villages--we mean not a f=
ew, but _all_ the=20

able-bodied men--were seized and imprisoned in the chapter house. The horro=
rs of the Black Hole=20

of Calcutta have been made familiar to all English readers; there are few w=
ho realize that jails as=20

horrible, and jailers as inhuman, were not infrequent in many a period of t=
he world's history. The=20

condition of the prisons of France when the courageous and devoted philanth=
ropist John Howard=20

visited them, at the close of the eighteenth century, was such as to beggar=
 description: how much=20

worse must have been a prison of the thirteenth century! The unfortunate pe=
asants, with=20

insufficient food, water, and air, were so crowded in the prison that sever=
al of them died. News of=20

the affair coming to Queen Blanche, she humbly prayed the canons to release=
 their victims, and=20

said that she would investigate the matter. The canons replied that it was =
none of her affair, that=20

she should not meddle with their serfs, "whom they could take and kill and =
do such justice on as=20

seemed good to them." To emphasize these rights and to revenge themselves u=
pon the=20

talebearers who had reported to Queen Blanche, they seized the wives and ch=
ildren of their=20

prisoners, and thrust them into the same overcrowded prison. The suffering =
was, of course,=20

intensified; many of the miserable wretches died. The historian tells us th=
at Blanche "felt great pity=20

for the people, so tormented by those whose duty it was to protect them." W=
e do not need to be=20

told that; but Blanche was not of the milk-and-water kind that would have w=
asted time in=20

_faineant_ compassion when there was suffering which her activity could rel=
ieve. She summoned=20

a body of knights and citizens, gave them arms, marched straight to the pri=
son, and ordered the=20

doors to be broken down, herself striking the first blow, that all might se=
e that she was not afraid to=20

assume the responsibility for the act. Nor did her beneficent activity ceas=
e with the release of the=20

prisoners; for she was determined that there should be no repetition of suc=
h tyranny if she could=20



help it. She took the serfs under her special protection and confiscated th=
e goods of the chapter of=20

Notre Dame, which she held until such time as full satisfaction had been re=
ndered. The serfs were=20

enfranchised in consideration of an annual tax. But so far was she from wis=
hing to wrong the=20

canons, or even to interfere with their rights, if they had any, that she o=
rdered the bishops of Paris,=20

Orleans, and Auxerre to hold a special investigation to determine whether o=
r not the people of Orly=20

had owed the tax. With a woman of her character the canons vainly resorted =
to their favorite threat=20

of excommunication. If they had excommunicated her, she would, in the light=
 of history at least,=20

have been given an absolution more purifying than any they could offer.  Fo=
r the common people=20

the great queen had always a tender heart. It was a rough and cruel age, es=
pecially for those in=20

bondage. "And since this Queen," says an anonymous chronicler, "had great p=
ity for such as were=20

serfs, she ordered, in several places, that they be set free in considerati=
on of the payment of some=20

other dues. This she did partly because of the pity she felt for the girls =
in this condition, because=20

people would not marry them, and many of them went to ruin thereby."  The l=
ast days of Blanche=20

de Castille were drawing to a close amid sad and fruitless longing to see h=
er son. Her health was=20

failing; one after another of those dear to her fell ill or passed away; th=
e dearest of all lingered in=20

the Holy Land, leading a forlorn hope and deaf to the entreaties of his mot=
her that he would return.=20

She was at Melun when, in November, 1252, she became so ill that she hasten=
ed to return to=20

Paris. She put her affairs in order and left instructions that those whom s=
he had unwittingly=20

wronged should be indemnified out of her private fortune. All worldly thoug=
hts were now put aside,=20

and she summoned the Bishop of Paris, took the Holy Communion, and was admi=
tted, by the=20

prelate's decree, into the Cistercian order, becoming a nun of her Abbey of=
 Maubuisson. Clothed=20

in the simple garments of the sisterhood, the noble queen passed, not many =
days later, from the=20

scene of her useful labors, murmuring in her last moments the words of the =
prayer for those in=20

extremis: _Subvenite, saticti Dei_.  It was on November 26th or 27th, in he=
r sixty-fourth year, that=20

Blanche died. Over her nun's habit they placed her royal robes, and on her =
head the crown; thus=20

clothed, and placed upon a bier ornamented with gold, she was borne by her =
sons and the great=20

nobles through the streets of Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. The next d=
ay, after a mass for the=20

dead, the body was carried in procession to Maubuisson, where another servi=
ce was held. Here,=20

in the choir of the chapel, the body of the queen was buried, and a tomb, b=
earing her effigy in=20

nun's habit, was erected. The other convent founded by her wished to have t=
he honor of guarding=20

her heart, which, in March of the following year, was taken to Notre Dame d=
u Lys by the abbess,=20

Countess Alix de Macon.  Let us pause awhile by the=20


_
For three weeks after the arrival of the treaty of peace Jackson lingered a=
t New Orleans, haggling=20

by day with the contractors and merchants whose cotton, blankets, and bacon=
 were yet to be paid=20

for, and enjoying in the evening the festivities planned in his honor by gr=
ateful citizens. His=20

pleasure in the gala affairs of the time was doubled by the presence of his=
 wife, who one day=20

arrived quite unexpectedly in the company of some Tennessee friends. Mrs. J=
ackson was a typical=20

frontier planter's wife--kind-hearted, sincere, benevolent, thrifty, pious,=
 but unlettered and wholly=20

innocent of polished manners. In all her forty-eight years she had never se=
en a city more=20

pretentious than Nashville. She was, moreover, stout and florid, and it may=
 be supposed that in=20

her rustic garb she was a somewhat conspicuous figure among the fashionable=
 ladies of New=20

Orleans society.  But the wife of Jackson's accomplished friend and future =
Secretary of State,=20

Edward Livingston, fitted her out character of Blanche de Castille; and mea=
nwhile we may see=20

how the news of her death was received by Saint Louis. He was at Jaffa when=
, after a long delay,=20

the intelligence reached him. At the very first ominous words of the papal =
legate who had come to=20

break the tidings to him Saint Louis gave way to uncontrollable emotion. Co=
nsolation was=20

unavailing; even the clergy seemed to realize that it would have been but a=
n impertinent=20

aggravation; and for two days no one ventured to speak to him. Then, rousin=
g himself from the=20

depths of his grief, he sent for that best and sturdiest of his friends, th=
e fearless, honest, blunt Sire=20

de Joinville, Seneschal of Champagne, who leaves us an account of what foll=
owed. When Joinville=20

came into the presence, the king rose, and, stretching out his arms to him,=
 cried in simple grief:=20

"Ah! Seneschal! I have lost my mother!" Joinville replied: "Sire, I do not =
marvel at it, for she had to=20

die; but I do marvel that you, a wise man, should mourn so=20


_
Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, Vol II, p. 97.  Shortly before their depa=
rture the Jacksons were=20

guests of honor at a grand ball at the Academy. The upper floor was arrange=
d for dancing and the=20

lower for supper, and the entire building was aglow with flowers, colored l=
amps, and=20

transparencies. As the evening wore on and the dances of polite society had=
 their due turn, the=20

General finally avowed that he and his bonny wife would show the proud city=
 folk what real=20

dancing was. A somewhat cynical observer--a certain Nolte, whom Jackson had=
 just forced to his=20

own terms in a settlement for war supplies--records his impression as follo=
ws: "After supper we=20

were treated to a most delicious pas de deux by the conqueror and his spous=
e. To see these two=20

figures, the General, a long haggard man, with limbs like a skeleton, and M=
adame la Gnrale, a=20

short fat dumpling, bobbing opposite each other like half-drunken Indians, =
to the wild melody of=20

Possum up de Gum Tree, and endeavoring to make a spring into the air, was v=
ery remarkable,=20

and far more edifying a spectacle than any European ballet could possibly h=
ave furnished." But=20

Jackson was only less proud of his accomplishments as a dancer than as a fi=
ghter, and it was the=20

part of discretion for a man of Nolte's critical turn to keep a straight fa=
ce on this occasion.  In early=20

April the General and his wife started homeward, the latter bearing as a pa=
rting gift from the=20

women of New Orleans the somewhat gaudy set of topaz jewelry which she wear=
s in her most=20

familiar portrait. The trip was a continuous ovation, and at Nashville a se=
ries of festivities wound=20

up with a banquet attended by the most distinguished soldiers and citizens =
of Tennessee and=20

presided over by the Governor of the State. Other cities gave dinners, and =
legislatures voted=20

swords and addresses. A period of rest at the Hermitage was interrupted in =
the autumn of 1815 by=20

a horseback trip to Washington which involved a succession of dinners and r=
eceptions. But after a=20

few months the much fted soldier was back at Nashville, ready, as he said, =
to "resume the=20

cultivation of that friendly intercourse with my friends and neighbors whic=
h has heretofore=20

constituted so great a portion of my happiness."  After Jackson had talked =
over his actions at New=20

Orleans with both the President and the Secretary of War, he had received, =
as he says, "a chart=20

blank," approving his whatever grief a man have at his heart, none of it sh=
ould be seen in his=20

countenance; for he who does so (_i. e._, shows his grief) rejoices the hea=
rt of his enemies and=20

brings sorrow to his friends." As all consolation would have been inadequat=
e to the magnitude of=20

the loss, we do not know that anyone could have spoken better than Joinvill=
e. The Seneschal=20

continues: "Madame Marie de Vertus, a very good and pious woman, came to te=
ll me that Queen=20

Marguerite, who had rejoined the king a little before, was in great grief, =
and prayed me to go to her=20

and comfort her. When I arrived I saw that she was weeping, and I said to h=
er that he spoke truth=20

who maintained that one ought not to believe women; for she who is dead was=
 the person in the=20

world whom you most hated, and yet you display such grief for her. And she =
told me that it was not=20

for the Queen that she wept, but for the suffering and the grief of the Kin=
g, and for her little=20

daughter, now left in the care of men."  There is no quality more to be adm=
ired in one who=20

attempts to write a life of some great man or woman than fearless frankness=
; the passages we=20

have given are characteristic of the _Vie de Saint Louis_, by the Sire de J=
oinville, whose=20

straightforward bluntness of speech is an amusing but also a valuable quali=
ty. We shall keep=20

Joinville in mind while concluding, in brief, the story of Saint Louis's re=
turn and of the subsequent=20

career of Marguerite.  More than a year of misery and futile battling inter=
vened between the time=20

when the news of his mother's death reached Louis and the time when he set =
sail for France.=20



There was no hope of succor from Europe: there was no Queen Blanche to husb=
and the=20

resources of France that her son might continue his fight for the faith. On=
 April 25, 1254, Saint=20

Louis, accompanied by Marguerite, their little son Jean Tristan, and the re=
mnant of the crusaders,=20

embarked at Acre. The sea was rough, and when they were off the coast of Cy=
prus the vessel=20

bearing the royal family ran on a sand bank. The nurses rushed frantically =
to arouse the queen,=20

and asked her what they should do with the children. Marguerite, thinking a=
ll would be lost in the=20

violence of the storm, said: "Neither waken them nor move them; let them go=
 to God in their=20

sleep." Saint Louis, urged to transfer himself and his family into another =
vessel, refused to do so,=20

resolving to take the risk with those who had to=20


_
Jackson was the last man to suppose that warfare in the southern half of th=
e United States was a=20

thing of the past. He knew that the late contest had left the southern Indi=
ans restless and that the=20

existing treaties were likely to be repudiated at any moment. Florida was s=
till in the hands of the=20

Spaniards, and he had never a doubt that some day this territory would have=
 to be conquered and=20

annexed. Moreover Jackson believed for some years after 1815, according to =
General Eaton, that=20

Great Britain would remain and might be forced to land in Cyprus: "If I lea=
ve this vessel, there are=20

on it five hundred men, each one of whom loves his life as much as I love m=
ine, and who may=20

have to stay in this island, and they may never return to their own country=
. That is why I had rather=20

place in the hands of God my person, my wife, and my children, than cause s=
uch great suffering to=20

the many people in this ship."  Joinville narrates another accident during =
this voyage, one which=20

will recall the instructions for=20
