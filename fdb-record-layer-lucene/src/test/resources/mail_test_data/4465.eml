fascinating little Delia Watts represented the South. She came from Califor=

and bright as a humming-bird, constantly in harmless mischief, but seldom g=
etting into any serious=20

trouble. Her highly strung temperament found school restrictions irksome, a=

blaze out into odd pranks which in other girls might have met with sterner =
punishment. But Miss=20

Morley had a soft corner for Delia, and, though she did not exactly favor h=

allowances for her excitability and her strongly emotional disposition.  "D=
elia's like a marionette--

always dancing to some hidden string," the teacher remarked once to Miss Ro=
dgers. "She mayn't=20

be strong-minded but she's immensely warm-hearted, and if we can only pull =
the love-string she'll=20

act the part we want. You can't force her into prim behavior; she's as much=
 a child of nature as the=20

birds, and if you clip her wings altogether you take away from her the very=
 gift that perhaps God=20

meant her to use. Let me have the handling of the little sky-rocket, and I'=

within bounds, but she's not the disposition to 'be made an example of' or =
to be set on the feelings=20

osity as it is from a silly=20

simplicity. All the stories have the essential merits of brightness and lig=

have that peculiar kind of ingenuity which is one of Mr. PAIN's strong poin=

you at a point which is nowhere near to that to which you thought you were =
