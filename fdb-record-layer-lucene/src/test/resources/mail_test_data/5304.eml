vereign intended in=20

them, on account of the character of the persons who in Manila compose that=
 class of=20

corporations, and of their clashing interests and relations. The chairs of =
theology, laws, and=20

philosophy should, I am forced to say, be abolished, on account of the abus=
e which is made of the=20

knowledge gained in those branches of learning; and in their places be subs=
tituted chairs of=20

agriculture, botany, mineralogy, arts, and commerce--throwing open the coll=
eges and universities=20

of Espaa to the natives of Filipinas who desire to cultivate the former bra=
nches. In the laws which=20

regulate law-suits, in the tariffs, in the penalties--in short, in all whic=
h has been adopted from other=20

countries and another condition of human life--there is a certain discord w=
ith the character,=20

usages, and customs of the inhabitants of Filipinas which it is necessary t=
o correct. A periodical=20

visitation by officials experienced in affairs, would set everything in mot=
ion in that colony, fill the=20

natives with hope, correct the arbitrary use of power (which usually increa=
sed in proportion to the=20

distances from the center of government), and furnish to this government ac=
curate and impartial=20

data for making its decisions. It is a great mistake, in my judgment, to se=
ek for light on affairs of=20

government in the colonies from the information furnished by their authorit=
ies and corporations;=20

they are always prone to support their own jurisdictions or interests, and,=
 in whatever matter these=20

may cross, it is impossible to expect impartiality. The warning of impendin=
g dangers. He did so.=20

They didn=E2=80=99t materialize. The =E2=80=9CProf.=E2=80=9D has had little=
 attention for three years.  The Louisville tornado=20

afforded other cases. A woman in the west predicted a combined deluge and e=
arthquake, with=20

other minor horrors on the side, as prepared for the Pacific coast. Some of=
 the gullible people sold=20

out at great sacrifice, that they might lose as little as possible by the g=
reatest cyclone and=20

earthquake of the century. Others drew up a formal petition to the Governor=
, calling upon him to=20

proclaim a day of supplication and fasting for the doomed cities of Oakland=
, San Francisco and=20

Alameda. The end of the world drew nigh, and these three cities, as eminent=
ly wicked, would be=20

first punished; after which Chicago and Milwaukee would suffer.  Bands of b=
elievers met and=20

wrestled mightily in prayer that the unparalleled horrors might be averted.=
 They were eminently=20

successful.  Another came forward and announced that the entire Mississippi=
 valley was to be=20

visited with a cataclysm, such as no man had ever conceived. The floods wer=
e to break all the=20

levees, wash away everything that was within a hundred miles of the stream,=
 tear up the delta built=20

by the deposits of ages, and leave the site of New Orleans at the bottom of=
 the sea. At this writing=20

the Crescent City is in hourly expectation of its doom.  Yet another seer, =
warned of the Lord in a=20

vision, perhaps, has just declared the fate of the Atlantic coast. Before t=
he end of the century there=20

will be an earthquake such as no man ever before has known. The fountains o=
f the great deep are=20

to be broken up. All the=20


_
the climate inspires, the pleasures, the relations of friendship, kindred, =
and interest in a small=20

population of Spaniards - all these things cause the neglect of affairs of =
government, and the=20

domination of private interests. Points of mere etiquette, questions of lit=
tle importance to the [royal]=20

service, and discords (which furnish a bad example) between married persons=
 - it has been mainly=20

these things which for many years have filled the official correspondence o=
f the colonies and kept=20

their authorities occupied. Many of the subjects which are touched upon in =
this writing are either=20

absolutely unknown to the government, or have not been discussed with the s=
pecifications and=20

explanations which their importance deserves.  I have explained to your Exc=
ellency impartially the=20

causes which antagonize the security and progress of the Filipinas Islands;=
 and your Excellency=20

will recognize, by the irrefutable facts which I have here set down, that i=
n that colony there exist=20

the elements necessary for it to render itself prosperous, and to distribut=
e its wealth throughout=20

Espaa, increasing the glory and power of her sovereign. Your Excellency des=
ires radical measures=20

of reform, and solidly-grounded plans for prosperity, because you recognize=
 that this is the great=20

art of government and of New England coast will be desolated by immense sea=
 waves. Manhattan=20

Island, with the city of New York, and Long Island, are to be sunk to the b=
ottom of the sea. Our=20

hearts fail us for fear for the things that are coming upon the earth. Let =
us hope that peradventure=20

there be yet five righteous men in Sodom.  Some years ago great sensation w=
as occasioned by=20

the discovery of Mother Shipton=E2=80=99s prophecy among some old English m=
anuscripts. It began:=20

=E2=80=9CCarriages shall without horses go,      And accidents fill the wor=
ld with woe;      Around the world=20

men=E2=80=99s thoughts shall fly,      In the twinkling of an eye.=E2=80=9D=
  After a few statements of this sort, it closed=20

by saying:      =E2=80=9CThe world to an end shall come      In eighteen hu=
ndred and eighty-one.=E2=80=9D  Great was=20

the fright of not a few timid believers. Many arranged their affairs for th=
e end of the world. Some,=20

as the Millerites have several times done, prepared their ascension robes. =
Finally, the whole thing=20

proved to be a hoax. A wag had endeavored to amuse himself at the expense o=
f the public.  Such=20

are fair specimens of predictions that continually appear in the newspapers=
. Certain men will=20

always endeavor to astonish the ignorant by their words and works. Seldom d=
o sober-minded=20

people pay the least attention to them. As for minor changes in=20


_
endeavored not to embarrass myself with the examination of one-sided and is=
olated questions, but=20

rather to rise to the comprehension of the axioms and general principles wh=
ich would give=20

perpetual strength to the tranquillity of the Filipinas Islands and lay the=
 foundations for their=20

advancing prosperity.  It has already been made evident by melancholy exper=
ience that the=20

governmental measures adopted since the conquest of the colonies have not b=
een suited to their=20

object. It is therefore necessary either to leave existing in Filipinas the=
 same causes which have=20

brought other colonies to their ruin, or to change the system without loss =
of time. This great reform=20

will assuredly be the work of the present enlightened government of his Maj=
esty, and the future=20

prosperity of the Filipinas Islands will be the grandest monument to his gl=
ory. Madrid, April 26,=20

1827.   Most excellent Sir,  MANUEL BERNALDEZ PIZARRO     [Here follows a "=
rsum of the=20

measures proposed in this memorial," which we have already presented by sec=
tions, at the end of=20

each subject treated. At the end is a list of the items of estimated increa=
se in the public revenues=20

of the constant, and so limited in area, that, as stated elsewhere, any one=
 is safe for announcing=20

the character of the weather for any day in the year. From a score of place=
s, he could obtain=20

testimonials of the correctness of his prognostications; while nine score m=
ore, if they spoke, might=20

declare him altogether mistaken.  But many will ask in all seriousness, if =
there is no means of=20

prediction upon which all may depend. Is any more reliance to be placed upo=
n the=20

prognostications of the Signal Service than upon those of the self-constitu=
ted prophets?  A brief=20

statement of the principles relied upon will be satisfactory on this point.=
  Our weather bureau was=20

established in 1870. Such organizations are maintained, at the public expen=
se, in Great Britain,=20

France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Russia, India, Algeria, and Japan. Sever=
al smaller countries=20

share in the expense and benefits. Men long trained in the work grow more r=
eliable. Each must=20

first master the topography and the prevailing movements of the atmosphere =
of any region, ere he=20

can presume to know anything of the probable changes.  How extremely import=
ant a knowledge of=20

the country is, will=20

Bernaldez are adopted.]  [Another MS. in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, =
dated Madrid, July=20

15, 1827, is of similar scope to this; it is signed with the initials "P. d=
e S. M.," and is addressed to=20

the Spanish minister Ballesteros. The writer states, in the prefatory note,=
 that his paper is the fruit=20

of his many years of practical experience and observation, being actively e=
ngaged in commerce=20

from Manila throughout the Philippine archipelago, in China, in all the for=
eign colonies of India, and=20

on the Pacific coasts of America; and that he has written this paper "in th=
e understood when it is=20

remembered that mountain ranges may turn aside great storms, and hills of a=
ny considerable size=20

may modify small ones. And in general, storm paths are so narrow, in compar=
ison with the whole=20

country, that the slightest variation at the start may be very important at=
 the end of six hundred or=20

seven hundred miles--or a day=E2=80=99s travel. So, announcing twenty-four =
hours beforehand the exact=20

locality a storm may reach is really a very delicate piece of work. If a ty=
ro should announce rain for=20

North Georgia, he might be astonished to find a difference of=20
