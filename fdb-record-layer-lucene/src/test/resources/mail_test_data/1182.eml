SIR SAMUEL W. BAKER, M.A., F.R.G.S.     I DEDICATE THIS BOOK, WITH SPECIAL=
=20

PERMISSION, TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ALBERT EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AS THE=20

FIRST OF ENGLAND'S ROYAL RACE WHO HAS SAILED UPON THE WATERS OF THE NILE;=
=20

THE LAKE SOURCES OF WHICH MIGHTY RIVER ARE HONOURED BY THE NAMES OF HIS=20

AUGUST PARENTS.     PREFACE.  THE work entitled "The Albert N'yanza Great B=
asin of the=20

Nile," published in 1866, has given an account of the equatorial lake syste=
m from which the=20

Egyptian river derives its source. It has been determined by the joint expl=
orations of Speke, Grant,=20

and myself, that the rainfall of the equatorial districts supplies two vast=
 lakes, the Victoria and the=20

Albert, of sufficient volume to support the Nile throughout its entire cour=
se of thirty degrees of=20

When the wound had been examined and probed and dressed, Theodora in a fain=
t voice said, =E2=80=9CIs=20

it desperate?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot desperate,=E2=80=9D said the surgeon, =
=E2=80=9Cbut serious. All depends upon your perfect=20

tranquility=E2=80=94of mind as well as body.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell I am h=
ere and cannot move; and as for my mind, I am=20

not only serene, but happy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen we shall get through th=
is,=E2=80=9D said the surgeon, encouragingly.  =E2=80=9CI=20

do not like you to stay with me,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CThere are=
 other sufferers besides myself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy=20

orders are not to quit you,=E2=80=9D said the surgeon, =E2=80=9Cbut I can b=
e of great use within these walls. I shall=20

return when the restorative has had its effect. But remember, if I be wante=
d, I am always here.=E2=80=9D=20

Soon after this Theodora fell into a gentle slumber, and after two hours wo=
ke refreshed. The=20

countenance of the surgeon when he again visited her was less troubled; it =
was hopeful.  The day=20

was now beginning to decline; notwithstanding the scenes of tumult and viol=
ence near at hand, all=20

was here silent; and the breeze, which had been strong during the whole day=
, but which blew from=20

the sea, and was very soft, played gratefully upon the pale countenance of =
the sufferer. Suddenly=20

she said, =E2=80=9CWhat is that?=E2=80=9D  And they answered and said, =E2=
=80=9CWe heard nothing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI hear the sound of=20

great guns,=E2=80=9D said Theodora.  And they listened, and in a moment bot=
h the surgeon and the maid=20



heard the sound of distant ordnance.  =E2=80=9CThe liberator is at hand,=E2=
=80=9D said the maid.  =E2=80=9CI dare say,=E2=80=9D said=20

the surgeon.  =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, looking distressed. =E2=
=80=9CThe sounds do not come from his=20

direction. Go and see, Dolores; ask, and tell me what are these sounds.=E2=
=80=9D  The surgeon was sitting=20

by her side, and occasionally touching her pulse, or wiping the slight foam=
 from her brow, when=20

Dolores returned and said, =E2=80=9CLady, the sounds are the great guns of =
Civita Vecchia.=E2=80=9D  A deadly=20

change come over the countenance of Theodora, and the surgeon looked alarme=
d. He would=20

have given her some restorative, but she refused it. =E2=80=9CNo, kind frie=
nd,=E2=80=9D she said; =E2=80=9Cit is finished. I=20

have just received a wound more fatal than the shot in the field this morni=
ng. The French are at=20

Rome. Tell me, kind friend, how long do you think I may live?=E2=80=9D  The=
 surgeon felt her pulse; his look=20

was gloomy. =E2=80=9CIn such a case as yours,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cth=
e patient is the best judge.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI understand,=E2=80=9D she=
=20

said. =E2=80=9CSend, then, at once for my husband.=E2=80=9D  He was at hand=
, for his wound had been dressed in=20

the convent, and he came to Theodora with his arm in a sling, but with the =
attempt of a cheerful=20

visage.  In the mean time, Lothair, after having=20


_
reservoirs, supplied by the ten months' rainfall of the equator, rolls stea=
dily on its way through arid=20

sands and burning deserts until it reaches the Delta of Lower Egypt.  It wo=
uld at first sight appear=20

that the discovery of the lake sources of the Nile had completely solved th=
e mystery of ages, and=20

that the fertility of Egypt depended upon the rainfall of the equator conce=
ntrated in the lakes=20

Victoria and hopeless, bulletin of the surgeon, had been obliged to leave t=
he convent to look after=20

his men, and having seen them in quarters and made his report to the genera=
l, he obtained=20

permission to return to the convent and ascertain the condition of Theodora=
. Arrived there, he=20

heard that she had had refreshing slumber, and that her husband was now wit=
h her, and a ray of=20

hope lighted up the darkness of his soul. He was=20
