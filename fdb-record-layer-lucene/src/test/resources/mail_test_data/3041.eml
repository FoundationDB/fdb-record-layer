So down I went, momentum gathered through centuries of republican training =
and glory to destroy him, to restore the republic for a brief period, and t=
o make victory doubtful at Phillipi. He began by celebrating a triumph over=
 his fellow-citizens, against the generous tradition of Rome: in that trium=
ph he _
ghost, he stood so still and he seemed so tall in the moonlight.  "I'll wat=
ch your boy," he said very=20

quietly, "until you come back."  He made me think of the Old Priest in _The=
 Sorrowful Inheritance_.=20

He seemed so calmly benignant, so dependable, so safe in his simple other-w=
orldliness.  "Oh,=20

Peter!" was all I could say as I moved toward him in the moonlight. He nodd=
ed, as much to himself=20

as to me, as he took my hand in his. I felt a great ache, which was not rea=
lly an ache, and a new=20

kind of longing which never before, in all my life, I had nursed or known. =
I must have moved closer=20

to Peter, though I could feel his hand pull itself away from mine. It made =
rising politicians;=20

nevertheless, the accuser of Verres may fairly be credited with some, at le=
ast, of the genuine=20

sentiment which impelled the accuser of Warren Hastings. We must couple wit=
h the Verrines the=20

admirable letter of the orator to his brother Quintus on the government of =
a province, and his own=20

provincial administration, which, as was said before, appears to have been =
excellent. Cicero rose,=20

not as an adherent of the aristocracy, but as their opponent, and the assai=
lant, a bold assailant, of=20

the tyranny of Sulla. He was brought to the front in politics, as Sallust a=
vers, by his merit, in spite=20

of his birth and social position, when the mortal=20


_
world.  "Aren't you going to kiss me good-by?" I cried out, with my hand on=
 his shoulder.  Peter=20

shook his head from side to side, very slowly.  "_Verboten!_" he said as he=
 put his hand over the=20

hand which I had put on his shoulder.  "But I may never come back. Peter!" =
I whispered, feeling=20

the tears go slowly down my wet cheek.  Peter took my unsteady fingers and =
placed them on the=20

white pickets of the little rectangular fence.  "You'll come back," he said=
 very quietly. And when I=20

looked up he had turned away.  I could see him walking off in the yellow mo=
onlight with his=20

shoulders back and his head up. He walked slowly, with an odd wading moveme=
nt, like a man=20

walking through water. I was tempted, for a moment, to call after him. But =
some power that was=20

not of me or any part of me prompted me to silence. I stood watching him un=
til he seemed a=20

moving shadow along the level floor of the world flooded with primrose-yell=
ow, until he became a=20

shifting stroke of umber on a background of misty gold. I stood looking aft=
er him as he passed=20

away, out of my sight, and far, far off to the north a coyote howled and ov=
er Casa Grande I could=20

see a thin pennon of chimney-smoke going up toward Arcturus.... Good-by, Pe=
ter, and God bless=20

you....  Unlimited, indeed, is the power of Eros. For when I went to slip q=
uietly into the house, I=20

found Whinnie and Struthers seated together beside the kitchen range. And S=
truthers was reading=20

_Tam O'Shanter_ aloud to her laird.  "Read slow, noo, lassie, an' tak' it a=
' in," said the placidly=20

triumphant voice of Whinstane Sandy, "for it'll be lang before ye ken its l=
ike!"     _Thursday the=20

Seventeenth_   The migration has been effected ... I am alone in my room, I=
 have two and three-

quarters trunks unpacked, and I feel like a President's wife the night afte=
r Inauguration. It is well=20

past midnight, but I am too tired and too unsettled to sleep. Things turn o=
ut so differently to what=20

one expects! And all change, to the home-staying heart, can be so abysmally=
 upsetting!...  We=20

were a somewhat disheveled and intimidated flock when we emerged from our t=
rain and found=20

Duncan awaiting us with an amazingly big touring-car which, as he explained=
 with a short laugh at=20

my gape of wonder, the Barcona Mines would pay for in a week.  "It's no pik=
er you're pulling with=20

now," he exclaimed as we climbed stiff and awkward into that deep-upholster=
ed grandeur on=20

wheels. He said that the children had grown but would have to be togged out=
 with some new duds-

-little knowing how I had stayed up until long past midnight mending and pr=
essing and doing my=20

best to make my bucolic offspring presentable. And he told me it was _some_=
 city I had come to,=20

as I'd very soon see for myself. And it was _some_ shack he'd corralled for=
 his family, he added=20

with a chuckle of pride.  I tried to be interested in the skyscrapers he sh=
owed me along Eighth=20

Avenue, and the Palliser, and the concreted subway, and the Rockies, in the=
 distance, with the=20

was gathering round the state, and necessity called for the man, and not th=
e game-preserver. His=20

conduct in that hour of supreme peril is ridiculously overpraised by himsel=
f. Not only so, but he=20

begs a friend in plain terms to write a history of it and to exaggerate. No=
w, it is denounced as=20

brutal tyranny and judicial murder. But those who hold this language have n=
ew lights on the=20

subject of Catiline. I confess that on me these new lights have not dawned;=
 I still believe Catiline to=20

have been a terrible anarchist, coming forth from the abyss of debauchery, =
ruin, and despair,=20

which lay beneath: the great fortunes of Rome. The land of Caesar Borgia ha=
s produced such=20

men in more than one period of history. The alleged illegality of the execu=
tion was made the=20

stalking- horse of a party move, and scrupulous legality found a champion a=
nd an avenger in=20

Clodius. On his return from exile, Cicero was received with the greatest en=
thusiasm by the whole=20

population of Italy, a fact which Dr. Mommsen is inclined to explain away, =
but which we should,=20



perhaps, accept as the key to some other facts in Cicero's history. The Ita=
lians were probably the=20

most respectable of the political elements, and it seems they not only look=
ed up to their fellow-

provincial with pride, but saw in him a statesman who was saving their home=
steads from a reign of=20

terror. That Cicero had the general support of the Italians was quite enoug=
h to make his=20

adherence an object of serious consideration to Caesar, though Dr. Mommsen =
persists in=20

interpolating into the relations of the two men the contempt which he feels=
, and which he fancies=20

Caesar must have felt, for an advocate. Surely, however, it is a mistake to=
 think that oratory was=20

not even in those days a real power at Rome. Can a greater platitude be con=
ceived than railing at=20

a statesman of antiquity for having been a rhetorician? Was not Pericles a =
rhetorician? Was not=20

Caesar himself a rhetorician? Did he not learn rhetoric from the same maste=
r as Cicero? Some=20

day we may be ruled by political science; but rhetoric was, at all events, =
an improvement on mere=20

force. The situation at Rome had now become essentially military; and Cicer=
o having no military=20

force at his command could not really control the situation.  His attempts =
to control it exposed him=20

to all the miscarriages and all the indignities which such an attempt is su=
re to entail. He was a=20

vessel of earthenware, or rather of very fragile porcelain, swimming among =
vessels of brass. Self-

respect would perhaps have prescribed retirement from public life; but, to =
say nothing of his=20

egotism, he had done too much to retire. Egotistical he was in the highest =
degree, and that failing=20

made all his humiliations doubly ignominious; but still, I think, if you ju=
dge him candidly, you wilt=20

see that he really loved his country, and that his greatest object of desir=
e was, as he himself says,=20

to live in the grateful memory of after-times; not the highest of all aims,=
 but higher=20


_
while I did my best to shake off the Maud-Muller feeling which was creeping=
 over me, by studying=20

the tranquillizingly remote mountain-tops, Duncan confided to me that he ha=
d first said: "Fifty=20

thousand or bu'st!" But two months ago he had amended that to "A hundred th=
ousand or bu'st!"=20

and now he had his reasons for saying, with his jaw set: "Just a cool quart=
er of a million, before I=20

quit this game!"  It was for us, I told myself as I looked down at my kiddi=
es, that the Dour Man=20

behind the big mahogany wheel was fighting. This, I felt, should bring me h=
appiness, and a new=20

sense of security. And it was only because my stomach was empty, I tried to=
 assure myself, that=20

my poor old prairie heart felt that way. I should have been happy, for I wa=
s going to a brand-new=20

home--and it was one of those foot-hill late afternoons that make you think=
 of the same old razor-

blade muffled up in the same old panne-velvet, an evening of softness shot =
through with a steely=20

sharpness. There was a Chinook arch of Irish point-lace still in the sky, v=
ery much like the one I=20

had left behind me, and the sky itself was a canopy of robin-egg blue _crep=
e de chine_ hemmed=20

with salmon pink.  But as we whirled up out of the city into the higher gro=
und of some boulevarded=20

and terraced residential district the evening air seemed colder and the sol=
emn old Rockies toward=20

the west took on an air of lonesomeness. It made the thought of home and op=
en fires and quiet=20

rooms very welcome. The lights came out along the asphalted streets, spangl=
ing the slopes of that=20

sedate new suburb with rectangular lines of brilliants. Duncan, in answer t=
o the questions of the=20

children, explained that he was taking the longer way round, so as to give =
us the best view of the=20

house as we drove in.  "Here we are!" he exulted as we slowed down and turn=
ed into a crescent=20

lined with baby poplar and Manitoba maple.  I leaned out and saw a big new =
house of tapestry=20

brick, looking oddly palatial on its imposing slope of rising ground. My hu=
sband stopped, in fact,=20

midway in a foolishly pillared gate that bisected a long array of cobble-st=
one walls, so that we=20

might get a look at the gardens. They seemed very new gardens, but much of =
their newness was=20

lost in that mercifully subduing light in which I saw trim-painted trellise=
s and sepulchral white=20

flower-urns and pergolas not yet softened with creepers. There was also a l=
arge iron fountain,=20

painted white, which Duncan apparently liked very much, from the way he loo=
ked at it. From two of=20

the chimneys I could see smoke going up in the quiet air. In the windows I =
could see lights, rose-

shaded and warm, and beyond the shrubbery somewhere back in the garden a wo=
rkman was=20

driving nails. His hammer fell and echoed like a series of rifle-shots. Fro=
m the garage chimney,=20

too, came smoke, and it was plain from the sounds that somebody inside was =
busy tuning up a=20

car-engine.  I sat staring at the grounds, at the cobble-stone walls, at th=
e tapestry-brick house with=20

the high-shouldered French cornices. It began to creep over me how it meant=
 service, how it=20

meant protection, how it meant guarded lives for war came, his perplexity w=
as painful, and he=20

betrayed it with his usual want of reticence. In that, as in other respects=
, his character is the direct=20

opposite of that of the "gloomy sporting man," whose ways Louis Napoleon, i=
t is said, avowed that=20

he had studied during his exile in England, and followed with profit as a c=
onspirator in France.=20

Cicero and Cato knew too well that Pompey had "licked the sword of Sulla;" =
but they knew also, by=20

long experience of his political character, that he shrank from doing the l=
ast violence to the=20

constitution. On the other hand, all men expected that Caesar, who had form=
erly given himself out=20

as the political heir of Marius, who had restored the trophies of Marius, a=
nd had undertaken the=20

conquest of Gaul, evidently as a continuation of the victories of Marius, d=
escending upon Italy with=20

an army partly consisting of barbarians and trained in the most ferocious w=
arfare, would renew the=20



Marian reign of terror. This fear put all Italy at first on Pompey's side. =
Caesar had not yet revealed=20

his nobler and more glorious self. Even Curio told Cicero, in an interview,=
 the object of which was=20

to draw Cicero to the Caesarian side, that Caesar's clemency was merely pol=
icy, not in his nature.=20

The best security against the bloody excesses of a victorious party at that=
 moment, undoubtedly,=20

was the presence of Marcus Cato in the camp of Pompey. After Pharsalus, Cic=
ero submitted like=20

many men of sterner mould. This departure of the advocate from the Pompeian=
 camp is=20

surrounded by Dr. Mommsen with circumstances of ridicule, for which, on ref=
erence to what I=20

suppose to be the authorities, I can find no historical foundation. The fie=
rcer Pompeians very=20

nearly killed him for refusing to stay and command them; his life was in fa=
ct only saved by the=20

intrepid moderation of Cato; and this is surely not a proof that they deeme=
d his presence=20

worthless. Once more, orators were not ridiculous in the eyes of antiquity.=
 Cicero accepted, and, in=20

a certain sense, served under the dictatorate of Caesar; though he afterwar=
ds rejoiced when it=20

was overthrown, and the constitution, the idol of his political worship, wa=
s restored; just as we may=20

suppose a French constitutionalist, not of stern mould, yet not dishonest, =
accepting and serving=20

under the empire, yet rejoicing at the restoration of constitutional govern=
ment. In the interval,=20

between the death of Caesar and Philippi, he was really the soul and the ma=
in support of the=20

Restoration. I have said what I think of the Philippics; but there can be n=
o doubt that they told, or=20

that Brutus and Cassius thought them, worth at least a legion.  Cicero met =
death with a physical=20

courage, which there is no reason to believe that he wanted in life. His co=
wardice was political; his=20

fears were for his position and reputation. If Cato survived in the traditi=
on of public virtue, so did=20

Cicero in the tradition of culture, which saved the empire of the Caesars f=
rom being an empire of=20

Moguls. The culture of a republic saved Caesar himself from being a mere Ti=
mur, and set him=20

after his victory to reforming calendars and endowing science,=20


_
complicated piece of machinery which took much thought to organize and much=
 money to=20

maintain. And the mainspring behind it all, I remembered, was the man sitti=
ng at the mahogany=20

wheel so close to me. Light and warmth and comfort and safety--they were al=
l to come from the=20

conceiting and the struggling of my Dour Man, fighting for an empty-headed =
family who were=20

scarcely worth it. He was, after all, the stoker down in the hole, and with=
out him everything would=20

stop. So when I saw that he was studying my face with that intent sidelong =
glance of his, I reached=20

over and put my hand on his knee, as I had done so often, in the old days. =
 He looked down, at=20

that, with what was almost an appearance of embarrassment.  "I want to play=
 my part," I said with=20

all the earnestness of my earnest old heart, as he let in his clutch and we=
 started up the winding=20

drive.  "It ought to be a considerable part," he said as we drew up under a=
 bone-white porte-

cochere of making pyramids of heads. Is it absurd to suppose that the great=
 soldier, who was also=20

a great man of letters, had more respect for intellect without military for=
ce than his literary=20

admirers, and that he really wished to adorn his monarchy by allying to it =
the leading man of=20

intellect of the time?  Our accounts of Marcus Brutus are not very clear. A=
ppian confounds Marcus=20

with Decimus; and it appears not unlikely that "Et tu Brute," if it was sai=
d at all, was said to=20

Decimus, who was a special favourite of Caesar, and was named in his will. =
Marcus seems to=20

have been a man of worth after his fashion; a patriot of the narrow Roman t=
ype, reproduced in=20

later days by Fletcher of Saltoun, whose ideal republic was an oligarchy, a=
nd who did not shrink=20

from proposing to settle the proletariat difficulty by making the common pe=
ople slaves. This is=20

quite compatible with the fact revealed to us in the letters of Cicero, tha=
t Brutus was implicated,=20


_
impassive and waiting to open the door for us.  My husband got down out of =
the car. I sat=20

wondering why I should feel so much like a Lady Jane Grey approaching the h=
eadsman's=20

_makura_.  "Come on, kids!" Duncan called out with a parade of joviality, l=
ike a cheer-leader who=20

realized that things weren't going just lending money to provincials at exo=
rbitant interest, and=20

abusing the power of the Imperial Governments to exact the debt. One can im=
agine a West Indian=20

slave-owner, dealing with negroes through his agent according to the establ=
ished custom, and yet=20

being a good citizen in England.  Cicero, though he suffered from=20


_
Dinkie, I could see, was shrinking back in the padded seat. His underlip wa=
s trembling a trifle as=20

he sat staring at the strange new house. But Poppsy, true little woman that=
 she was, smiled=20

appreciatively about at the material grandeurs which confronted her. If she=
'd had a tail, I'm sure,=20

she'd have been wagging it. And this so tickled her dad that he lifted her =
out of the car and carried=20

her bodily and triumphantly up the steps.  I waited for Dinkie, whose eye m=
et mine. I did my best to=20

show my teeth, that he might understand how everything was eventually to be=
 for the best. But his=20

face was still clouded as we climbed the steps and passed under the yoke.  =
The little Jap, whose=20

name, I have since found out, is Tokudo, bowed a jack-knife bow and said "_=
Irashai_" as I passed=20

him. And "_Irashai_" I have also discovered, is perfectly good Japanese for=
 "Welcome."  We had=20

dinner at seven. It was a well-ordered meal, but it of him as one of those,=
 the sight of whom=20

banished his fears and anxieties for the republic. That the most famous and=
 most terrible act of=20

this man's life was an act of republican fanaticism, not of selfish ambitio=
n, is proved by his=20

refusing, with magnanimous imprudence, to make all sure, as the more worldl=
y spirits about him=20

suggested, by cutting off Antony and the outer leading partisans of Caesar,=
 and by his permitting=20

public honours to be done to the corpse of the man whom he had immolated to=
 civil duty. One=20

almost shrinks from speaking of the death of Caesar; so much modern nonsens=
e on both sides=20

has been talked about this, the most tragic, the most piteous, and at the s=
ame time the most=20

inevitable event of ancient story. Peculiar phases of society have their pe=
culiar sentiments, with=20

reference to which events must be explained. The greased cartridges were th=
e real account of the=20

Indian mutiny. Caesar was slain=20


_
rather dismally. I was depressed, for reasons I couldn't quite fathom, and =
the children were tired,=20

and Duncan, I'm afraid, was a bit disappointed in us all. Tokudo had brough=
t cocktails for us, and=20

Duncan, seeing I wasn't drinking mine, stowed both away in his honorable st=
omach. He ate=20

heartily, I noticed, and gave scant appearance of a man pining away with a =
broken heart. After=20

dinner he sat back and bit off the end of a cigar.  "This is my idea of liv=
ing," he proclaimed as he=20

sent a blue cloud up toward the rather awful dome-light above the big table=
. "There's stir and=20

movement here, all day long. Something more than sunsets to look at! You'll=
 see--something to fill=20

up your day! Why, night seems to come before I even know it. And before I'm=
 out of bed I'm=20

brooding over what's ahead of me for that particular date and day--Say, tha=
t girl the title of king.=20

Cicero speaks the literal truth, when he says: that the real murderer was A=
ntony, and the fatal day=20

the day of the Lupercalia, when Antony offered and Caesar faintly put aside=
 the crown. A dictator=20

they would have borne, a king they would not bear, neither then nor for age=
s afterwards; because=20

the title of king to their minds spoke not of a St. Louis, or an Edward I.,=
 or even a Louis XIV., but of=20

the unutterable degradation of the Oriental slave. To use a homely image, i=
f you put your leg in the=20

way of a cannon ball which seems spent, but is still rolling, you will suff=
er by the experiment. This=20

is exactly what Caesar, in the giddiness of victory and supremacy, did, and=
 the consequence was=20

as certain as it was deplorable. The republican sentiment seemed to him to =
have entirely lost its=20

force, so that he might spurn it=20
