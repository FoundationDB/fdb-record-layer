SHORT REPORT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INDIES      1. The Indies were disco=
vered in=20

the year fourteen hundred and       ninety-two.  The year following, Spanis=
h Christians went to=20

inhabit       them, so that it is since forty-nine years that numbers of Sp=
aniards       have gone=20

there: and the first land, that they invaded to inhabit       was the large=
 and most delightful Isle of=20

Hispaniola which has a       circumference of six hundred leagues.  2.2. Th=
ere are numberless=20

other islands, and very large ones, all around       on every side, that we=
re all--and we have seen=20

it--as inhabited and       full of their native Indian peoples as any count=
ry in the world.  3.3. Of the=20

continent, the nearest part of which is more than two hundred       and fif=
ty leagues distant from=20

this Island, more than ten thousand       leagues of maritime coast have be=
en discovered, and=20

more is       discovered every day; all that has been discovered up to the =
year       forty-nine is full=20

of people, like a hive of bees, so that it seems       as though God had pl=
aced all, or the greater=20

part of the entire       human race in these countries.  4.4. God has creat=
ed all these numberless=20

people to be quite the       simplest, without malice or duplicity, most ob=
edient, most faithful       to=20

their natural Lords, and to the Christians, whom they serve; the       most=
 humble, most patient,=20

most peaceful, and calm, without strife       nor tumults; not wrangling, n=
or querulous, as free from=20

uproar, hate       and desire of revenge, as any in the world.  5.5. They a=
re likewise the most=20

delicate people, weak and of feeble       constitution, and less than any o=
ther furnish fine examples=20

in the panelling of the town-halls. In South Germany, in closer touch with =
Italian influence, the=20

practice was more diverse; sideboards, doors, bedsteads, panelling, friezes=
, and even gables to=20

chateaus, received this ornamentation.  Augsburg and Nuremberg developed an=
 industry and=20

exported their marquetry. This suggests the first attempt at duplication. B=
lack on white and white=20

on black, male and female as they are termed in the trade, or later, in Fra=
nce, Boulle and counter-

Boulle, were exported. The slicing of design and the manipulation of the kn=
ife, and later the saw,=20

came into operation to fret out the pattern. In its subsequent development =
marquetry left the=20

inlaying, piece by piece, and as tools became more perfect easier methods w=
ere employed.=20

Whether Andre Boulle, in his _atelier_ under Louis XIV, invented the proces=
s or whether he got it=20

from Germany through Holland is immaterial to the present argument. His bra=
ss and tortoiseshell=20

marquetry set a fashion to all succeeding craftsmen. He has given his name =
to his particular style;=20

though it has been "defamed by every charlatan and soiled with all ignoble =
use" and corrupted to=20

"Buhl," but there is no reason why _Boulle_ should not stand, although Webs=
ter's Dictionary=20

knows him not.  Practically, nowadays marquetry is the cutting of thin shee=
ts of wood which have=20

been superimposed upon each other, and when taken apart, after the desired =
pattern has been=20

cut away, fit into each other to produce the desired colour effect. For ins=
tance, a sheet of walnut,=20

dark brown, placed over a sheet of sycamore, light yellow, has a pattern pa=
sted on it in paper. The=20

delicate fret-saw traces this pattern and cuts through both light and dark =
woods. The result is that=20


_
they very easily die of whatsoever infirmity; so much so, that not       ev=
en the sons of our Princes=20

and of nobles, brought up in royal and       gentle life, are more delicate=
 than they; although there=20

are among       them such as are of the peasant class. They are also a very=
 poor       people, who=20

of worldly goods possess little, the light-wood surface is left with a perf=
oration ready to receive the=20

piece cut from its fellow, the dark wood, and _vice versa_. That is just wh=
at the marquetry-worker=20

does. He transposes the piece of sycamore to the walnut surface and fits it=
 in, showing a yellow=20

design on dark brown, and similarly the walnut piece, fitted in place or=20
