It would be impossible to tell of all his deeds, for "the loyal servant" wh=
o wrote his life says of him,=20

"The good knight was a very register of battles, so that on account of his =
great experience every=20

one deferred to him," and until his death, save times, when laid up with wo=
unds, he was constantly=20

battling for his King and country. Twice was he captured; but so great was =
his fame both for=20

prowess and goodness that both times his enemies released him without ranso=
m. Once he=20

defended a bridge single-handed against the enemy, and enabled the French a=
rmy to retreat. So=20

great was his valor at the battle of Marignano that Francis I. of France, a=
fter the field was won,=20

craved the accolade at his hand. But never, either in victory or defeat, di=
d he forget the promise he=20

made his dear mother.  "Was he in possession of a crown, all shared it; the=
 first thing he did when=20

he rose was to serve God; he was a great giver of alms; and there was no ma=
n during his life who=20

could say he had refused him anything within his power to grant."  Once, wh=
en assaulting Brescia,=20

he was severely wounded, and after the town was taken was lose the battle a=

and went, on camels, horses, donkeys and on foot; all armed, all beggars, f=
rom the rich chief to=20

the poorest horseman of the tribe; and yet all dignified, draped in their f=
luttering rags, and looking=20

more like men than those whom eighteen centuries of civilization and of tra=
de have turned to apes.=20

Men fought, careering on their horses on the sand, firing their guns and ci=
rcling round like gulls,=20

shouting their battle-cries; men prayed, turning to Mecca at the appointed =
hours; men sat for hours=20

half in a dream thinking of much or nothing, who can say; whilst women in t=
he tents milked=20

camels, wove the curious geometric-patterned carpets which they use, and ch=
ildren grew up=20

straight, active and as fleet of foot as roe.  Inside the factory the Europ=
ean clerks smoked, drank,=20

and played at cards: they learned no Arabic, for why should those who speak=
 bad English struggle=20

with other tongues?  Meanwhile the time slipped past, leaving as little tra=
ce as does a jackal when=20

on a windy day he sneaks=20


_
leaving his wife and daughters, and Bayard protected them from pillage and =
insult. When his=20

wound was cured, for his kindness to them the mother besought his acceptanc=
e of 2500 ducats,=20

but bidding her ask her daughters to come to him, he said to them: "You mus=
t know that military=20

men are sand.  Only Maron Mohanna seemed to have no place in the desert wor=

dreamed of as a boy; and in the world of Europe typified by the factory on =
the beach his place was=20

lost.  On marrying he had, of course, abjured the faith implanted in him in=
 the Lebanon, and yet=20
