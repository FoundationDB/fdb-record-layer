since they knew that evil-doers would be quickly punished, and wrongs set r=
ight, men hesitated to=20

defraud or oppress their neighbours, and the great bell pealed less often a=
s years went on.  In the=20

course of time, however, the bell-rope wore thin, and some ingenious citize=
n fastened a wisp of=20

hay to it, that this might serve as a handle. One day in the height of summ=
er, when the deserted=20

square was blazing with sunlight, and most of the citizens were taking thei=
r noonday rest, their=20

siesta was disturbed by the violent pealing of the bell.  "Surely some grea=
t injustice has been=20

done," they cried, shaking off their languor and hastening to the square. T=
o their amazement they=20

found it empty of all human beings save themselves; no angry supplicant app=
ealed for justice, but=20

a poor old horse, lame and half blind, with bones that nearly broke through=
 his skin, was trying=20

with pathetic eagerness to eat the wisp of hay. In struggling to do this, h=
e had rung the bell, and=20

the judge, summoned so hastily for so slight a cause, was stirred to indign=
ation.  "To whom does=20

this wretched horse belong?" he shouted wrathfully. "What business has it h=
ere?"  "Sir, he belongs=20

to a rich nobleman, who lives in that splendid palace whose tall towers gli=
sten white above the=20

palm-grove," said an old man, coming forward with a deep bow. "Time was tha=
t he bore his master=20

to battle, carrying him dauntlessly amid shot and shell, and more than once=
 saving his life by his=20

courage and fleetness. When the horse became old and feeble, he was turned =
adrift, since his=20

master had no further use for him; and now the poor creature picks up what =
food he can in=20

highways and byways."  On hearing this the judge's face grew dark with ange=
r. "Bring his master=20

before me," he thundered, and when the amazed nobleman appeared, he questio=
ned him more=20

sternly than he would have done the meanest peasant.  "Is it true," he dema=
nded, "that you left=20

this, your faithful servant, to starve, since he could no longer serve you?=
 It is long since I heard of=20

such gross injustice--are you not ashamed?"  The nobleman hung his head in =
silence; he had no=20

word to say in his own defence as with scathing contempt the judge rebuked =
him, adding that in=20

future he would neglect the horse at his peril.  "For the rest of his life,=
" he said, "you shall care for=20

the poor beast as he deserves, so that after his long term of faithful serv=
ice he may end his days in=20

peace."  This decision was greeted with loud applause by the town folk, who=
 gathered in the=20

square.  "Our bell is superior to all others," they said to each other, wit=
h nods and smiles, "for it is=20

the means of gaining justice, not only for men, but for animals too in thei=
r time of need."  And with=20

shouts of triumph they led the old war-horse back to his stable, knowing th=
at for the future its=20

miserly owner would not dare to begrudge it the comfort to which it was so =
justly entitled.    WHAT=20

GINGER TOLD BLACK BEAUTY  By Anna Sewell  One day when Ginger and I were st=
anding=20

alone in the shade, we had a great deal of talk; she wanted to know all abo=
ut my bringing up and=20

breaking in, and I told her.  "Well," said she, "if I had had your bringing=
 up, I might have had as=20

good a temper as you, but now I don't believe I ever shall."  "Why not?" I =
said.  "Because it has=20

been all so different with me," she replied. "I never had any one, horse or=
 man, that was kind to=20

me, or that I cared to please, for in the first place I was taken from my m=
other as soon as I was=20

weaned, and put with a lot of other young colts; none of them cared for me,=
 and I cared for none of=20

them. There was no kind master like yours to look after me, and talk to me,=
 and bring me nice=20

things to eat. The man that had the care of us never gave me a kind word in=
 my life. I do not mean=20

that he ill-used me, but he did not care for us one bit further than to see=
 that we had plenty to eat,=20

and shelter in the winter. A footpath ran through our field and very often =
the great boys passing=20



through would fling stones to make us gallop. I was never hit, but one fine=
 young colt was badly=20

cut in the face, and I should think it would be a scar for life. We did not=
 care for them, but of course=20

it made us more wild, and we settled it in our minds that boys were our ene=
mies. We had very=20

good fun in the free meadows, galloping up and down and chasing each other =
round and round=20

the field; then standing still under the shade of the trees. But when it ca=
me to breaking in, that was=20

a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they clos=
ed me in at one=20

corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock, another caught me by th=
e nose and held it so=20

tight I could hardly draw my breath; then another took my under jaw in his =
hard hand and=20

wrenched my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter and the bar =
into my mouth; then=20

one dragged me along by the halter, another flogging behind, and this was t=
he first experience I=20

had of men's kindness; it was all force. They did not give me a chance to k=
now what they wanted.=20

I was high bred and had a great deal of spirit and was very wild, no doubt,=
 and gave them, I dare=20

say, plenty of trouble, but then it was dreadful to be shut up in a stall d=
ay after day instead of=20

having my liberty, and I fretted and pined and wanted to get loose. You kno=
w yourself it's bad=20

enough when you have a kind master and plenty of coaxing, but there was not=
hing of that sort for=20

me.  "There was one--the old master, Mr. Ryder--who, I think, could soon ha=
ve brought me round,=20

and could have done anything with me; but he had given up all the hard part=
 of the trade to his son=20

and to another experienced man, and he only came at times to oversee. His s=
on was a strong, tall,=20

bold man; they called him Samson, and he used to boast that he had never fo=
und a horse that=20

could throw him. There was no gentleness in him, as there was in his father=
, but only hardness, a=20

hard voice, a hard eye, a hard hand; and I felt from the first that what he=
 wanted was to wear all=20

the spirit out of me, and just make me into a quiet, humble, obedient piece=
 of horse-flesh. 'Horse-

flesh!' Yes, that is all that he thought about," and Ginger stamped her foo=
t as if the very thought of=20

him made her angry. Then she went on:  "If I did not do exactly what he wan=
ted, he would get put=20

out, and make me run round with that long rein in the training field till h=
e had tired me out. I think=20

he drank a good deal, and I am quite sure that the oftener he drank the wor=
se it was for me. One=20

day he had worked me hard in every way he could, and when I lay down I was =
tired, and=20

miserable, and angry; it all seemed so hard. The next morning he came for m=
e early, and ran me=20

round again for a long time. I had scarcely had an hour's rest, when he cam=
e again for me with a=20

saddle and bridle and a new kind of bit. I could never quite tell how it ca=
me about; he had only just=20

mounted me on the training ground, when something I did put him out of temp=
er, and he chucked=20

me hard with the rein. The new bit was very painful, and I reared up sudden=
ly, which angered him=20

still more, and he began to flog me. I felt my whole spirit set against him=
, and I began to kick, and=20

plunge, and rear as I had never done before, and we had a regular fight; fo=
r a long time he stuck,=20

to the saddle and punished me cruelly with his whip and spurs, but my blood=
 was thoroughly up,=20

and I cared for nothing he could do if only I could get him off. At last, a=
fter a terrible struggle, I=20

threw him off backwards. I heard him fall heavily on the turf, and, without=
 looking behind me, I=20

galloped off to the other end of the field; there I turned round and saw my=
 persecutor slowly rising=20

from the ground and going into the stable. I stood under an oak tree and wa=
tched, but no one=20

came to catch me. The time went on, and the sun was very hot; the flies swa=
rmed round me and=20

settled on my bleeding flanks where the spurs had dug in. I felt hungry, fo=
r I had not eaten since=20

the early morning, but there was not enough grass in that meadow for a goos=
e to live on. I wanted=20



to lie down and rest, but with the saddle strapped tightly on, there was no=
 comfort, and there was=20

not a drop of water to drink. The afternoon wore on, and the sun got low. I=
 saw the other colts led=20

in, and I knew they were having a good feed.  "At last, just as the sun wen=
t down, I saw the old=20

master come out with a sieve in his hand. He was a very fine old gentleman =
with quite white hair,=20

but his voice was what I should know him by amongst a thousand. It was not =
high, nor yet low, but=20

full, and clear, and kind, and when he gave orders it was so steady and dec=
ided, that every one=20

knew, both horses and men, that he expected to be obeyed. He came quietly a=
long, now and then=20

shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve, and speaking cheerfully an=
d gently to me: 'Come=20

along, lassie, come along, lassie; come along, come along.' I stood still a=
nd let him come up; he=20

held the oats to me, and I began to eat without fear; his voice took all my=
 fear away. He stood by,=20

patting and stroking me whilst I was eating, and seeing the clots of blood =
on my side he seemed=20

very vexed. 'Poor lassie! it was a bad business, a bad business!' Then he q=
uietly took the rein and=20

led me to the stable; just at the door stood Samson. I laid my ears back an=
d snapped at him.=20

'Stand back,' said the master, 'and keep out of her way; you've done a bad =
day's work for this filly.'=20

He growled out something about a vicious brute. 'Hark ye,' said the father,=
 'a bad-tempered man=20

will never make a good-tempered horse. You've not learned your trade yet, S=
amson.' Then he led=20

me into my box, took off the saddle and bridle with his own hands, and tied=
 me up; then he called=20

for a pail of warm water and a sponge, took off his coat, and while the sta=
bleman held the pail, he=20

sponged my sides a good while, so tenderly that I was sure he knew how sore=
 and bruised they=20

were. 'Whoa! my pretty one,' he said, 'stand still, stand still.' His very =
voice did me good, and the=20

bathing was very comfortable. The skin was so broken at the corners of my m=
outh that I could not=20

eat the hay; the stalks hurt me. He looked closely at it, shook his head, a=
nd told the man to fetch a=20

good bran mash and put some meal into it. How good that mash was! and so so=
ft and healing to=20

my mouth. He stood by all the time I was eating, stroking me and talking to=
 the man. 'If a=20

highmettled creature like this,' said he, 'can't be broken in by fair means=
, she will never be good for=20

anything.'  "After that he often came to see me, and when my mouth was heal=
ed, the other=20

breaker, Job, they called him, went on training me; he was steady and thoug=
htful, and I soon=20

learned what he wanted."    SOME TRUE STORIES OP HORSES AND DONKEYS  By W. =
H. G.=20

Kingston  The horse becomes the willing servant of man, and when kindly tre=
ated looks upon him=20

as a friend and protector.  I have an interesting story to tell you of a ma=
re which belonged to=20

Captain I--, an old settler in New Zealand. She and her foal had been place=
d in a paddock,=20

between which and her master's residence, three or four miles away, several=
 high fences=20

intervened. The paddock itself was surrounded by a still higher fence.  One=
 day, however, as=20

Captain I--was standing with a friend in front of his house, he was surpris=
ed to see the mare come=20

galloping up. Supposing that the fence of her paddock had been broken down,=
 and that, pleased=20

at finding herself at liberty, she had leaped the others, he ordered a serv=
ant to take her back. The=20

mare willingly followed the man; but in a short time was seen galloping up =
towards the house in as=20

great a hurry as before. The servant, who arrived some time afterwards, ass=
ured his master that=20

he had put the mare safely into the paddock. Captain I--told him again to t=
ake back the animal,=20

and to examine the fence more thoroughly, still believing that it must have=
 been broken down in=20

some part or other, though the gate might be secure.  Captain I--and his fr=
iend then retired into the=20

house, and were seated at dinner, when the sound of horse's hoofs reached t=
heir ears. The friend,=20



who had on this got up to look out of the window, saw that it was the mare =
come back for the third=20

time; and observing the remarkable manner in which she was running up and d=
own, apparently=20

trying even to get into the house, exclaimed, "What can that mare want? I a=
m sure that there is=20

something the matter." Captain I--on hearing this hurried out to ascertain =
the state of the case. No=20

sooner did the mare see him than she began to frisk about and exhibit the m=
ost lively satisfaction;=20

but instead of stopping to receive the accustomed caress, off she set again=
 of her own accord=20

towards the paddock, looking back to ascertain whether her master was follo=
wing. His friend now=20

joined him, and the mare, finding that they were keeping close behind her, =
trotted on till the gate of=20

the paddock was reached, where she waited for them. On its being opened, sh=
e led them across=20

the field to a deep ditch on the farther side, when, what was their surpris=
e to find that her colt had=20

fallen into it, and was struggling on its back with its legs in the air, ut=
terly unable to extricate itself.=20

In a few minutes more probably it would have been dead. The mare, it was ev=
ident, finding that=20

the servant did not comprehend her wishes, had again and again sought her m=
aster, in whom she=20

had learned from past experience to confide. Here was an example of strong =
maternal affection=20

eliciting a faculty superior to instinct, which fully merits the name of re=
ason.  [Illustration: GINGER=20

AND I WERE STANDING ALONE IN THE SHADE     _From the painting by Maude Scri=
vener_]=20

The memory of horses is remarkable. The newsman of a country paper was in t=
he habit of riding=20

his horse once or twice a week to the houses of fifty or sixty of his custo=
mers, the horse invariably=20

stopping of his own accord at each house as he reached it.  But the memory =
of the horse was=20

exhibited in a still more curious manner. It happened that there were two p=
ersons on the route who=20

took one paper between them, and each claimed the privilege of having it fi=
rst on each alternate=20

week. The horse soon became accustomed to this regulation, and though the p=
arties lived two=20

miles distant, he stopped once a fortnight at the door of the half-customer=
 at one place, and once=20

a fortnight at the door of the half-customer at the other; and never did he=
 forget this arrangement,=20

which lasted for several years.  I was once travelling in the interior of P=
ortugal with several=20

companions. My horse had never been in that part of the country before. We =
left our inn at=20

daybreak, and proceeded through a mountainous district to visit some beauti=
ful scenery. On our=20

return evening was approaching, when I stopped behind my companions to tigh=
ten the girths of=20

my saddle. Believing that there was only one path to take, I rode slowly on=
, but shortly reached a=20

spot where I was in some doubt whether I should go forward or turn off to t=
he left. I shouted, but=20

heard no voice in reply, nor could I see any trace of my friends. Darkness =
was coming rapidly on.=20

My horse seeming inclined to take the left hand, I thought it best to let h=
im do so. In a short time=20

the sky became overcast, and there was no moon. The darkness was excessive.=
 Still my steed=20

stepped boldly on. So dense became the obscurity, that I could not see his =
ears; nor could I,=20

indeed, distinguish my own hand held out at arms-length. I had no help for =
it but to place the reins=20

on my horse's neck and let him go forward.  We had heard of robberies and m=
urders committed;=20

and I knew that there were steep precipices, down which, had my horse falle=
n, we should have=20

been dashed to pieces. Still the firm way in which he trotted gave me confi=
dence. Hour after hour=20

passed by. The darkness would, at all events, conceal me from the banditti,=
 if such were in wait--

that was one consolation; but then I could not tell where my horse might be=
 taking me. It might be=20

far away from where I hoped to find my companions.  At length I heard a dog=
 bark, and saw a light=20

twinkling far down beneath me, by which I knew that I was still on the moun=
tain-side. Thus on my=20



steady steed proceeded, till I found that he was going along a road, and I =
fancied I could=20

distinguish the outlines of trees on either hand. Suddenly he turned on one=
 side, when my hat was=20

nearly knocked off by striking against the beam of a trellised porch, cover=
ed with vines; and to my=20

joy I found that he had brought me up to the door of the inn which we had l=
eft in the morning.  My=20

companions, trusting to their human guide, had not arrived, having taken a =
longer though safer=20

route. My steed had followed the direct path over the mountains which we ha=
d pursued in the=20

morning.  Another horse of mine, which always appeared a gentle animal, and=
 which constantly=20

carried a lady, was, during my absence, ridden by a friend with spurs. On m=
y return, I found that=20

he had on several occasions attacked his rider, when dismounted, with his f=
ore-feet, and had once=20

carried off the rim of his hat. From that time forward he would allow no on=
e to approach him if he=20

saw spurs on his heels; and I was obliged to blindfold him when mounting an=
d dismounting, as he=20

on several occasions attacked me as he had done my friend.  A horse was shu=
t up in a paddock=20

near Leeds, in a corner of which stood a pump with a tub beneath it.  The g=
room, however, often=20

forgot to fill the tub, the horse having thus no water to drink. The animal=
 had observed the way in=20

which water was procured, and one night, when the tub was empty, was seen t=
o take the pump=20

handle in his mouth, and work it with his head till he had procured as much=
 water as he required.=20

A remarkable instance of a horse saving human life occurred some years ago =
at the Cape of Good=20

Hope. A storm was raging when a vessel, dragging her anchors, was driven on=
 the rocks and=20

speedily dashed to pieces. Many of those on board perished. The remainder w=
ere seen clinging to=20

the wreck, or holding on to the fragments which were washing to and fro ami=
d the breakers. No=20

boat could put off. When all hope had gone of saving the unfortunate people=
, a settler, somewhat=20

advanced in life, appeared on horseback on the shore. His horse was a bold =
and strong animal,=20

and noted for excelling as a swimmer. The farmer, moved with compassion for=
 the unfortunate=20

seamen, resolved to attempt saving them. Fixing himself firmly in the saddl=
e, he pushed into the=20

midst of the breakers. At first both horse and rider disappeared; but soon =
they were seen buffeting=20

the waves, and swimming towards the wreck. Calling two of the seamen, he to=
ld them to hold on=20

by his boots; then turning his horse's head, he brought them safely to land=
.  No less than seven=20

times did he repeat this dangerous exploit, thus saving fourteen lives. For=
 the eighth time he=20

plunged in, when, encountering a formidable wave, the brave man lost his ba=
lance, and was=20

instantly overwhelmed. The horse swam safely to shore; but his gallant ride=
r, alas! was no more.=20

Some horses in the county of Limerick, which were pastured in a field, brok=
e bounds like a band of=20

unruly schoolboys, and scrambling through a gap which they had made in a fe=
nce, found=20

themselves in a narrow lane. Along the quiet by-road they galloped helter-s=
kelter, at full speed,=20

snorting and tossing their manes in the full enjoyment of their freedom, bu=
t greatly to the terror of a=20

party of children who were playing in the lane. As the horses were seen tea=
ring wildly along, the=20

children scrambled up the bank into the hedge, and buried themselves in the=
 bushes, regardless=20

of thorns,--with the exception of one poor little thing, who, too small to =
run, fell down on its face,=20

and lay crying loudly in the middle of the narrow way.  On swept the horses=
; but when the leader=20

of the troop saw the little child lying in his path, he suddenly stopped, a=
nd so did the others behind=20

him. Then stooping his head, he seized the infant's clothes with his teeth,=
 and carefully lifted it to=20

the side of the road, laying it gently and quite unhurt on the tender grass=
.  He and his companions=20

then resumed their gallop in the lane, unconscious of having performed a re=
markable act.  We=20



have no less an authority than Dr. Franklin to prove that donkeys enjoy mus=
ic.  The mistress of a=20

chateau in France where he visited had an excellent voice, and every time s=
he began to sing, a=20

donkey belonging to the establishment invariably came near the window, and =
listened with the=20

greatest attention. One day, during the performance of a piece of music whi=
ch apparently pleased=20

it more than any it had race. No. 2 would often lead No. 1 unsuspectingly f=
orward to a difficult=20

situation from which No. 1, though angry and uncomfortable, could not retir=
e.  Thus it was No. 2=20

who with the most casual air had wandered up Regent Street, drawn by the sl=
ender chance of=20

meeting a woman with red roses in her hat; and it was No. 1 who had to pay =
the penalty. Nobody=20

could have been more astonished than No. 2 at the fulfillment of No. 2's se=
cret yearning for=20

novelty. But the innocent sincerity of No. 2's astonishment gave no aid to =
No. 1.  Farll raised his=20

hat, and at the same moment perceived the roses. He might have denied the n=
ame of Leek and=20

fled, but he did not. Though his left leg was ready to run, his right leg w=
ould not stir.  Then he was=20

shaking hands with her. But how had she identified him?  "I didn't really e=
xpect you," said the lady,=20

always with a slight Cockney accent. "But I thought how silly it would be f=
or me to miss the=20

vanishing trick just because you couldn't come. So in I went, by myself."  =
"Why didn't you expect=20

me?" he asked diffidently.  "Well," she said, "Mr. Farll being dead, I knew=
 you'd have a lot to do,=20

besides being upset like."  "Oh yes," he said quickly, feeling that he must=
 be more careful; for he=20

had quite forgotten that Mr. Farll was dead. "How did you know?"  "How did =
I know!" she cried.=20

"Well, I like that! Look anywhere! It's all over London, has been these six=
 hours." She pointed to a=20

ragged man who was wearing an orange-coloured placard by way of apron. On t=
he placard was=20

printed in large black letters: "Sudden death of Priam Farll in London. Spe=
cial Memoir." Other=20

ragged men, also wearing aprons, but of different colours, similarly procla=
imed by their attire that=20

Priam Farll was dead. And people crowding out of St. George's Hall were con=
tinually buying=20

newspapers from these middlemen of tidings.  He blushed. It was singular th=
at he could have=20

walked even half-an-hour in Central London without noticing that his own na=
me flew in the=20

summer breeze of every street. But so it had been. He was that sort of man.=
 Now he understood=20

how Duncan Farll had descended upon Selwood Terrace.  "You don't mean to sa=
y you didn't=20

_see_ those posters?" she demanded.  "I didn't," he said simply.  "That sho=
ws how you must have=20

been thinking!" said she. "Was he a good master?"  "Yes, very good," said P=
riam Farll with=20

conviction.  "I see you're not in mourning."  "No. That is----"  "I don't h=
old with mourning myself,"=20

she proceeded. "They say it's to show respect. But it seems to me that if y=
ou can't show your=20

respect without a pair of black gloves that the dye's always coming off... =
I don't know what you=20

think, but I never did hold with mourning. It's grumbling against Providenc=
e, too! Not but what I=20

think there's a good deal too much talk about Providence. I don't know what=
 you think, but----"  "I=20

quite agree with you," he said, with a warm generous smile which sometimes =
rushed up and=20

transformed his face before he was aware of the occurrence.  And she smiled=
 also, gazing at him=20

half confidentially. She was a little woman, stoutish--indeed, stout; puffy=
 red cheeks; a too=20

remarkable white cotton blouse; and a crimson skirt that hung unevenly; gre=
y cotton gloves; a=20

green sunshade; on the top of all this the black hat with red roses. The ph=
otograph in Leek's=20

pocket-book must have been taken in the past. She looked quite forty-five, =
whereas the=20

photograph indicated thirty-nine and a fraction. He gazed down at her prote=
ctively, with a good-

natured appreciative condescension.  "I suppose you'll have to be going bac=
k again soon, to=20



arrange things like," she said. It was always she who kept the conversation=
 afloat.  "No," he said.=20

"I've finished there. They've dismissed me."  "Who have?"  "The relatives."=
  "Why?"  He shook his=20

head.  "I hope you made them pay you your month," said she firmly.  He was =
glad to be able to=20

give a satisfactory answer.  After a pause she resumed bravely:  "So Mr. Fa=
rll was one of these=20

artists? At least so I see according to the paper."  He nodded.  "It's a ve=
ry funny business," she=20

said. "But I suppose there's some of them make quite a nice income out of i=
t. _You_ ought to know=20

about that, being in it, as it were."  Never in his life had he conversed o=
n such terms with such a=20

person as Mrs. Alice Challice. She was in every way a novelty for him--in c=
lothes, manners,=20

accent, deportment, outlook on the world and on paint. He had heard and rea=
d of such beings as=20

Mrs. Alice Challice, and now he was in direct contact with one of them. The=
 whole affair struck him=20

as excessively odd, as a mad escapade on his part. Wisdom in him deemed it =
ridiculous to=20

prolong the encounter, but shy folly could not break loose. Moreover she po=
ssessed the charm of=20

her novelty; and there was that in her which challenged the male in him.  "=
Well," she said, "I=20

suppose we can't stand here for ever!"  The crowd had frittered itself away=
, and an attendant was=20

closing and locking the doors of St. George's Hall. He coughed.  "It's a pi=
ty it's Saturday and all the=20

shops closed. But anyhow suppose we walk along Oxford Street all the same? =
Shall we?" This=20

from her.  "By all means."  "Now there's one thing I should like to say," s=
he murmured with a calm=20

smile as they moved off. "You've no occasion to be shy with me. There's no =
call for it. I'm just as=20

you see me."  "Shy!" he exclaimed, genuinely surprised. "Do I seem shy to y=
ou?" He thought he=20

had been magnificently doggish.  "Oh, well," she said. "That's all right, t=
hen, if you _aren't._ I=20

should take it as a poor compliment, being shy with me. Where do you think =
we can have a good=20

talk? I'm free for the evening. I don't know about you."  Her eyes question=
ed his.   _No Gratuities_=20

At a late hour, they were entering, side by side, a glittering establishmen=
t whose interior seemed=20

to be walled chiefly in bevelled glass, so that everywhere the curious obse=
rver saw himself and=20

twisted fractions of himself. The glass was relieved at frequent intervals =
by elaborate enamelled=20

signs which repeated, 'No gratuities.' It seemed that the directors of the =
establishment wished to=20

make perfectly clear to visitors that, whatever else they might find, they =
must on no account expect=20

gratuities.  "I've always wanted to come here," said Mrs. Alice Challice vi=
vaciously, glancing up at=20

Priam Farll's modest, middle-aged face.  Then, after they had successfully =
passed through a=20

preliminary pair of bevelled portals, a huge man dressed like a policeman, =
and achieving a very=20

successful imitation of a policeman, stretched out his hand, and stopped th=
em.  "In line, please,"=20

he said.  "I thought it was a restaurant, not a theatre," Priam whispered t=
o Mrs. Challice.  "So it is a=20

restaurant," said his companion. "But I hear they're obliged to do like thi=
s because there's always=20

such a crowd. It's very 'andsome, isn't it?"  He agreed that it was. He fel=
t that London had got a=20

long way in front of him and that he would have to hurry a great deal befor=
e he could catch it up.=20

At length another imitation of a policeman opened more doors and, with othe=
r sinners, they were=20

released from purgatory into a clattering paradise, which again offered eve=
rything save gratuities.=20

They were conducted to a small table full of dirty plates and empty glasses=
 in a corner of the vast=20

and lofty saloon. A man in evening dress whose eye said, "Now mind, no insu=
lting gratuities!"=20

rushed past the table and in one deft amazing gesture swept off the whole o=
f its contents and was=20

gone with them. It was an astounding feat, and when Priam recovered from hi=
s amazement he fell=20

into another amazement on discovering that by some magic means the man in e=
vening dress had=20



insinuated a gold-charactered menu into his hands. This menu was exceedingl=
y long--it comprised=20

everything except gratuities--and, evidently knowing from experience that i=
t was not a document to=20

be perused and exhausted in five minutes, the man in evening dress took car=
e not to interrupt the=20

studies of Priam Farll and Alice Challice during a full quarter of an hour.=
 Then he returned like a=20

bolt, put them through an examination in the menu, and fled, and when he wa=
s gone they saw that=20

the table was set with a clean cloth and instruments and empty glasses. A b=
and thereupon burst=20

into gay strains, like the band at a music-hall after something very diffic=
ult on the horizontal bar.=20

And it played louder and louder; and as it played louder, so the people tal=
ked louder. And the=20

crash of cymbals mingled with the crash of plates, and the altercations of =
knives and forks with the=20

shrill accents of chatterers determined to be heard. And men in evening dre=
ss (a costume which=20

seemed to be forbidden to sitters at tables) flitted to and fro with inconc=
eivable rapidity, austere,=20

preoccupied conjurers. And from every marble wall, bevelled mirror, and Dor=
ic column, there=20

spoke silently but insistently the haunting legend, 'No gratuities.'  Thus =
Priam Farll began his first=20

public meal in modern London. He knew the hotels; he knew the restaurants, =
of half-a-dozen=20

countries, but he had never been so overwhelmed as he was here. Remembering=
 London as a=20

city of wooden chop-houses, he could scarcely eat for the thoughts that sur=
ged through his brain.=20

"Isn't it amusing?" said Mrs. Challice benignantly, over a glass of lager. =
"I'm so glad you brought=20

me here. I've always wanted to come."  And then, a few minutes afterwards, =
she was saying,=20

against the immense din--  "You know, I've been thinking for years of getti=
ng married again. And if=20

you really _are_ thinking of getting married, what are you to do? You may s=
it in a chair and wait till=20

eggs are sixpence a dozen, and you'll be no nearer. You must do something. =
And what is there=20

except a matrimonial agency? I say--what's the matter with a matrimonial ag=
ency, anyhow? If you=20

want to get married, you want to get married, and it's no use pretending yo=
u don't. I do hate=20

pretending, I do. No shame in wanting to get married, is there? I think a m=
atrimonial agency is a=20

very good, useful thing. They say you're swindled. Well, those that are des=
erve to be. You can be=20

swindled without a matrimonial agency, seems to me. Not that I've ever been=
. Plain common-

sense people never are. No, if you ask me, matrimonial agencies are the mos=
t sensible things--

after dress-shields--that's ever been invented. And I'm sure if anything co=
mes of this, I shall pay=20

the fees with the greatest pleasure. Now don't you agree with me?"  The who=
le mystery stood=20

explained.  "Absolutely!" he said.  And felt the skin creeping in the small=
 of his back.         *       *=20

*       *       *     CHAPTER III   _The Photograph_   From the moment of M=
rs. Challice's remarks in=20

favour of matrimonial agencies Priam Farll's existence became a torture to =
him. She was what he=20

had always been accustomed to think of as "a very decent woman"; but really=
...! The sentence is=20

not finished because Priam never finished it in his own mind. Fifty times h=
e conducted the=20

sentence as far as 'really,' and there it dissolved into an uncomfortable c=
loud.  "I suppose we shall=20

have to be going," said she, when her ice had been eaten and his had melted=
.  "Yes," said he, and=20

added to himself, "But where?"  However, it would be a relief to get out of=
 the restaurant, and he=20

called for the bill.  While they were waiting for the bill the situation gr=
ew more strained. Priam was=20

aware of a desire to fling down sovereigns on the table and rush wildly awa=
y. Even Mrs. Challice,=20

vaguely feeling this, had a difficulty in conversing.  "You _are_ like your=
 photograph!" she=20

remarked, glancing at his face which--it should be said--had very much chan=
ged within half-an-

hour. He had a face capable of a hundred expressions per day. His present e=
xpression was one of=20



his anxious expressions, medium in degree. It can be figured in the mask of=
 a person who is=20

locked up in an iron strongroom, and, feeling ill at ease, notices that the=
 walls are getting red-hot=20

at the corners.  "Like my photograph?" he exclaimed, astonished that he sho=
uld resemble Leek's=20

photograph.  "Yes," she asseverated stoutly. "I knew you at once. Especiall=
y by the nose."  "Have=20

you got it here?" he asked, interested to see what portrait of Leek had a n=
ose like his own.  And=20

she pulled out of her handbag a photograph, not of Leek, but of Priam Farll=
. It was an unmounted=20

print of a negative which he and Leek had taken together for the purposes o=
f a pose in a picture,=20

and it had decidedly a distinguished appearance. But why should Leek dispat=
ch photographs of=20

his master to strange ladies introduced through a matrimonial agency? Priam=
 Farll could not=20

imagine--unless it was from sheer unscrupulous, careless bounce.  She gazed=
 at the portrait with=20

obvious joy.  "Now, candidly, don't _you_ think it's very, very good?" she =
demanded.  "I suppose it=20

is," he agreed. He would probably have given two hundred pounds for the cou=
rage to explain to=20

her in a few well-chosen words that there had been a vast mistake, a huge i=
mpulsive indiscretion.=20

But two hundred thousand pounds would not have bought that courage.  "I lov=
e it," she ejaculated=20

fervently--with heat, and yet so nicely! And she returned the photograph to=
 her little bag.  She=20

lowered her voice.  "You haven't told me whether you were ever married. I'v=
e been waiting for=20

that."  He blushed. She was disconcertingly personal.  "No," he said.  "And=
 you've always lived like=20

that, alone like; no home; travelling about; no one to look after you, prop=
erly?" There was distress=20

in her voice.  He nodded. "One gets accustomed to it."  "Oh yes," she said.=
 "I can understand=20

that."  "No responsibilities," he added.  "No. I can understand all that." =
Then she hesitated. "But I=20

do feel so sorry for you... all these years!"  And her eyes were moist, and=
 her tone was so sincere=20

that Priam Farll found it quite remarkably affecting. Of course she was tal=
king about Henry Leek,=20

the humble valet, and not about Leek's illustrious master. But Priam saw no=
 difference between=20

his lot and that of Leek. He felt that there was no essential difference, a=
nd that, despite Leek's=20

multiple perfections as a valet, he never had been looked after--properly. =
Her voice made him feel=20

just as sorry for himself as she was sorry for him; it made him feel that s=
he had a kind heart, and=20

that a kind heart was the only thing on earth that really mattered. Ah! If =
Lady Sophia Entwistle had=20

spoken to him in such accents...!  The bill came. It was so small that he w=
as ashamed to pay it.=20

The suppression of gratuities enabled the monarch of this bevelled palace t=
o offer a complete=20

dinner for about the same price as a thimbleful of tea and ten drachms of c=
ake a few yards away.=20

Happily the monarch, foreseeing his shame, had arranged a peculiar method o=
f payment through=20

a little hole, where the receiver could see nothing but his blushing hands.=
 As for the conjurers in=20

evening dress, they apparently never soiled themselves by contact with spec=
ie.  Outside on the=20

pavement, he was at a loss what to do. You see, he was entirely unfamiliar =
with Mrs. Challice's=20

code of etiquette.  "Would you care to go to the Alhambra or somewhere?" he=
 suggested, having a=20

notion that this was the correct thing to say to a lady whose presence near=
 you was directly due to=20

her desire for marriage.  "It's very good of you," said she. "But I'm sure =
you only say it out of=20

kindness--because you're a gentleman. It wouldn't be quite nice for you to =
go to a music-hall to-

night. I know I said I was free for the evening, but I wasn't thinking. It =
wasn't a hint--no, truly! I think=20

I shall go home--and perhaps some other----"  "I shall see you home," said =
he quickly. Impulsive,=20

again!  "Would you really like to? Can you?" In the bluish glare of an elec=
tricity that made the=20

street whiter than day, she blushed. Yes, she blushed like a girl.  She led=
 him up a side-street=20



where was a kind of railway station unfamiliar to Priam Farll's experience,=
 tiled like a butcher's=20

shop and as clean as Holland. Under her direction he took tickets for a sta=
tion whose name he=20

had never heard of, and then they passed through steel railings which clack=
ed behind them into a=20

sort of safe deposit, from which the only emergence was a long dim tunnel. =
Painted hands,=20

pointing to the mysterious word 'lifts,' waved you onwards down this tunnel=
. "Hurry up, please,"=20

came a voice out of the spectral gloom. Mrs. Challice thereupon ran. Now up=
 the tunnel, opposing=20

all human progress there blew a steady trade-wind of tremendous force. Imme=
diately Priam began=20

to run the trade-wind removed his hat, which sailed buoyantly back towards =
the street. He was=20

after it like a youth of twenty, and he recaptured it. But when he reached =
the extremity of the=20

tunnel his amazed eyes saw nothing but a great cage of human animals presse=
d tightly together=20

behind bars. There Was a click, and the whole cage sank from his sight into=
 the earth.  He felt that=20

there was more than he had dreamt of in the city of miracles. In a couple o=
f minutes another cage=20

rose into the tunnel at a different point, vomited its captives and descend=
ed swiftly again with=20

Priam and many others, and threw him and the rest out into a white mine con=
sisting of numberless=20

galleries. He ran about these interminable galleries underneath London, at =
the bidding of painted=20

hands, for a considerable time, and occasionally magic trains without engin=
es swept across his=20

vision. But he could not find even the spirit of Mrs. Alice Challice in thi=
s nether world.   _The Nest_=20

On letter-paper headed "Grand Babylon Hotel, London," he was writing in a d=
isguised backward=20

hand a note to the following effect: "Duncan Farll, Esq. Sir,--If any lette=
rs or telegrams arrive for=20

me at Selwood Terrace, be good enough to have them forwarded to me at once =
to the above=20

address.--Yours truly, H. Leek." It cost him something to sign the name of =
the dead man; but he=20

instinctively guessed that Duncan Farll might be a sieve which (owing to it=
s legal-mindedness)=20

would easily get clogged up even by a slight suspicion. Hence, in order to =
be sure of receiving a=20

possible letter or telegram from Mrs. Challice, he must openly label himsel=
f as Henry Leek. He had=20

lost Mrs. Challice; there was no address on her letter; he only knew that s=
he lived at or near=20

Putney, and the sole hope of finding her again lay in the fact that she had=
 the Selwood Terrace=20

address. He wanted to find her again; he desired that ardently, if merely t=
o explain to her that their=20

separation was due to a sudden caprice of his hat, and that he had searched=
 for her everywhere in=20

the mine, anxiously, desperately. She would surely not imagine that he had =
slipped away from her=20

on purpose? No! And yet, if incapable of such an enormity, why had she not =
waited for him on one=20

of the platforms? However, he hoped for the best. The best was a telegram; =
the second-best a=20

letter. On receipt of which he would fly to her to explain.... And besides,=
 he wanted to see her--

simply. Her answer to his suggestion of a music-hall, and the tone of it, h=
ad impressed him. And=20

her remark, "I do feel so sorry for you all these years," had--well, somewh=
at changed his whole=20

outlook on life. Yes, he wanted to see her in order to satisfy himself that=
 he had her respect. A=20

woman impossible socially, a woman with strange habits and tricks of manner=
 (no doubt there=20

were millions such); but a woman whose respect one would not forfeit withou=
t a struggle!  He had=20

been pushed to an extremity, forced to act with swiftness, upon losing her.=
 And he had done the=20

thing that comes most naturally to a life-long traveller. He had driven to =
the best hotel in the town.=20

(He had seen in a flash that the idea of inhabiting any private hotel whate=
ver was a silly idea.) And=20

now he was in a large bedroom over-looking the Thames--a chamber with a wri=
ting-desk, a sofa,=20

five electric lights, two easy-chairs, a telephone, electric bells, and a m=
assive oak door with a lock=20



and a key in the lock; in short, his castle! An enterprise of some daring t=
o storm the castle: but he=20

had stormed it. He had registered under the name of Leek, a name sufficient=
ly common not to=20

excite remark, and the floor-valet had proved to be an admirable young man.=
 He trusted to the=20

floor-valet and to the telephone for avoiding any rough contact with the wo=
rld. He felt=20

comparatively safe now; the entire enormous hotel was a nest for his shynes=
s, a conspiracy to=20

keep him in cotton-wool. He was an autocratic number, absolute ruler over R=
oom 331, and with=20

the right to command the almost limitless resources of the Grand Babylon fo=
r his own private=20

ends.  As he sealed the envelope he touched a bell.  The valet entered.  "Y=
ou've got the evening=20

papers?" asked Priam Farll.  "Yes, sir." The=20


_
post outside the window, unceremoniously entered the room, and, to exhibit =
its satisfaction, began=20

to bray with all its might.  Donkeys sometimes exert their ingenuity to the=
ir own advantage. A=20

certain ass had his quarters in a shed, in front of which was a small yard.=
 On one side of the yard=20

was a kitchen garden, separated from it by a wall, in which was a door fast=
ened by two bolts and a=20

latch. The owner of the premises one morning, in taking a turn round his ga=
rden, observed the=20

footprints of an ass on the walks and beds. "Surely some one must have left=
 the door open at=20

night," thought the master. He accordingly took care to see that it was clo=
sed.  Again, however, he=20

found that the ass had visited the garden.  The next night, curious to know=
 how this had=20

happened, he watched from a window overlooking the yard. At first he kept a=
 light burning near=20

him. The ass, however, remained quietly at his stall. After a time, to enab=
le him to see the better,=20

he had it removed, when what was his surprise to see the supposed stupid do=
nkey come out of=20

the shed, go to the door, and, rearing himself on his hind-legs, unfasten t=
he upper bolt of the door=20

with his nose. This done, he next withdrew the lower bolt; then lifted the =
latch, and walked into the=20

garden. He was not long engaged in his foraging expedition, and soon return=
ed with a bunch of=20

carrots in his mouth. Placing them in his shed, he went back and carefully =
closed the door and=20

began at his ease to munch the provender he had so adroitly got possession =
of.  The owner,=20

suspecting that people would not believe his story, invited several of his =
neighbours to witness the=20

performance of the ass. Not till the light, however, had been taken away, w=
ould the creature=20

commence his operations, evidently conscious that he was doing wrong.  A lo=
ck was afterwards=20

put on the door, which completely baffled the ingenuity of the cunning anim=
al.    "OLD MUSTARD":=20

A TALE OF THE WESTERN PIONEERS  By E. W. Frentz  When Grandmother Lane was =
a little=20

girl her father came in one day and said, "Wife, it is all settled at last.=
 I have sold the farm. Next=20

week we will start West. There is a large company going from here, and we m=
ust try to get ready=20

to go with them."  Little Mary, as grandmother was then called, heard the n=
ews with great delight,=20

because she knew it would mean a long, long journey, lasting months, and ca=
rrying them into a=20

new country, where there was never any cold weather and where great crops c=
ould be raised=20

without much hard work, and there would always be plenty to eat. Besides, h=
er family was not=20

going alone, but many other families whom they knew were going at the same =
time, so that she=20

would have some of her playmates with her all the way.  It was a wonderful =
sight when the great=20

day came at last, and the long wagon-train set out. In all there were more =
than forty wagons, some=20

drawn by four or six horses, and some by as many as eight big oxen. And suc=
h strange wagons!=20

They were more like little houses on wheels, only instead of a roof there w=
as a high frame=20

overhead made of hoops, and covered with canvas, so it made a sort of tent =
to ride in by day, if=20

you wished, and to sleep in at night. And from these hoops hung all sorts o=
f things--hams and=20

pieces of bacon, strips of dried pumpkin, pans to cook in, and clothes. Und=
erneath the big wagon,=20

outside, swung the great kettles, in which the larger things were cooked, a=
nd axes, and ropes and=20

chains for pulling the wagons out when they got stuck in the mud.  To littl=
e Mary it was all new and=20

delightful. The big wagons squeaked and groaned and swayed from side to sid=
e till the hams=20

hanging from the frame overhead would swing back and forth like the pendulu=
m of a clock. There=20

were the shouts of the men to the horses and oxen, the barking of the dogs =
that ran along the side=20

of the trail, the sharp cracking of the drivers' whips, and the _ting-tang_=
 of the iron kettles swinging=20

against each other. And always they were passing through places that were n=
ew and seeing=20



things that were fresh and strange.  The wagon of Mr. Harding--that was gra=
ndmother's father--

was drawn by four oxen, but of them, known as Jerry, began to show signs of=
 sickness when they=20

had been on the road a few days. The men gave him medicine and doctored him=
 all they could,=20

but he seemed to grow weaker all the time instead of better, and one mornin=
g, when they went to=20

yoke the oxen to the wagon, they found him dead.  For a day or two they wen=
t on with only three=20

oxen. Then Mr. Harding met a trader who was willing to sell him a pet ox th=
at he called "Old=20

Mustard," to take the place of Jerry.  It was a very funny-looking ox, inde=
ed, not like any that Mary=20

or anybody in her family had ever seen before. He had a very large, round h=
ead, with shaggy hair=20

matted on top, and on his back was a large hump. In color he was a dirty ye=
llow all over. That is=20

why the trader called him Mustard.  "He isn't very pretty," said the trader=
, "but he is strong and=20

good-natured, and will pull more than any ox of his size that I ever saw. B=
esides, he will get on=20

with less grass and less water. He is a half-buffalo--he shows that in his =
huge head and shoulders.=20

For this reason he will be worth more to you than any scout or watch-dog; h=
e can smell Indians a=20

mile away, and will fight them on sight." Mr. Harding did not quite like to=
 buy so strange an animal,=20

but he must get another ox somewhere, and so he took Old Mustard.  By the e=
nd of the first day=20

he was very glad he had done so, for the funny-looking yellow creature took=
 its place at the tongue=20

of the cart and pulled steadily and well. And every day after that he did h=
is work faithfully, and=20

seemed never to be sick or to feel tired.  By the end of the fourth week th=
e wagon-train had=20

entered a country where the Indians were known to be on the war-path, and t=
rouble was expected.=20

They even found the remains of three partly burned wagons.  Great care was =
now taken to send=20

scouts ahead during the day and to prepare the camp for defense at night.  =
The first thing that was=20

done as soon as the stop was made for the night was to "park" all the wagon=
s, as they called it.=20

The big ox-carts were placed in a great circle and chained one to another. =
Sometimes the cattle=20

were picketed outside, to graze, with men armed with guns to watch them, an=
d sometimes they=20

were driven inside. But always the camp-fires were built in the circle, and=
 round them the different=20

families gathered to cook and eat their supper.  One night, when the wagons=
 had been parked and=20

every one had eaten supper and gone to sleep, Old Mustard began to act very=
 strangely. At first=20

he tossed his head and blew hard through his nostrils; then he began to mov=
e about uneasily as=20

far as his rope would let him, and to snort and paw the ground.  When one o=
f the guards went near=20

him he turned upon him a pair of eyes that were bright green and shiny. At =
last Mr. Harding=20

happened to think what the trader had told him.  "Do you suppose it can be =
that he scents=20

Indians?" he asked one of the other men.  "It may be," he said. "It is sure=
 that he is excited over=20

something. Perhaps we had better be on the safe side and wake the men."  Qu=
ietly Mr. Harding=20

went from wagon to wagon, rousing the sleepers. He had hardly finished when=
 Old Mustard, with a=20

terrible roar, snapped the rope that held him, dashed to the edge of the ci=
rcle, leaped a cart-

tongue, and thundered away into the darkness. Almost instantly there came a=
 scream and then=20

the rushing charge of Indian riders.  They were met by the men of the party=
, now all prepared for=20

them and protected by the circle of wagons. And finding that their attack h=
ad been discovered too=20

soon, the Indians drew off after the first rush.  By the earliest flush of =
daylight a searching-party=20

went out from camp. It came upon poor Old Mustard grazing about, and not fa=
r away lay an Indian=20

trampled into the dust. The Indian was the foremost of the band that was qu=
ietly creeping up on=20

the camp when Old Mustard had scented them, and not only given warning, but=
 surprised and=20



killed the leader.    CARLO, THE SOLDIERS' DOG  By General Rush C. Hawkins =
 The Ninth New=20

York Volunteers was organized in April, 1861, in the City of New York. Two =
of the companies were=20

made up of men from outside the city. C was composed of men from Hoboken an=
d Paterson, New=20

Jersey, and G marched into the regimental headquarters fully organized from=
 the town of Fort Lee=20

in that State. With this last named company came Carlo, the subject of this=
 sketch.  When he=20

joined the regiment, he had passed beyond the period of puppyhood and was i=
n the full flush of=20

dogly beauty. He was large, not very large,--would probably have turned the=
 scales at about fifty=20

pounds. His build was decidedly "stocky," and, as horsey men would say, his=
 feet were well under=20

him; his chest was broad and full, back straight, color a warm dark brindle=
, nose and lips very=20

black, while he had a broad, full forehead and a wonderful pair of large, r=
ound, soft, dark-brown=20

eyes. Add to this description an air of supreme, well-bred dignity, and you=
 have an idea of one of=20

the noblest animals that ever lived.  His origin was obscure; one camp reun=
ion asserted that he=20

was born on board of a merchant ship while his mother was making a passage =
from Calcutta to=20

New York; and another told of a beautiful mastiff living somewhere in the S=
tate of New Jersey that=20

had the honor of bringing him into the world. It would be very interesting =
to know something of the=20

parentage of our hero, but since the facts surrounding his birth are unatta=
inable, we must content=20

ourselves with telling a portion of a simple story of a good and noble life=
. It may be safe to assert=20

that he was not a native American; if he had been, he would have provided h=
imself with the=20

regulation genealogical tree and family coat-of-arms.  During the first par=
t of his term of service,=20

Carlo was very loyal to his company, marched, messed, and slept with it; bu=
t he was not above=20

picking up, here and there, from the mess tents of the other companies a ti=
d-bit, now and then,=20

which proved acceptable to a well-appointed digestion.  His first turn on g=
uard was performed as a=20

member of the detail from Co. G, and always afterward, in the performance o=
f that duty, he was=20

most faithful. No matter who else might be late, he was ever on time when t=
he call for guard mount=20

was sounded, ready to go out with his own particular squad. At first, he wo=
uld march back to=20

company quarters with the old detail, but, as soon as he came to realize th=
e value and importance=20

of guard duty, he made up his mind that his place was at the guard tent and=
 on the patrol beat,=20

where he could be of the greatest service in watching the movements of the =
enemy.  In the=20

performance of his duties as a member of the guard he was very conscientiou=
s and ever on the=20

alert. No stray pig, wandering sheep, or silly calf could pass in front of =
his part of the line without=20

being investigated by him. It is possible that his vigilance in investigati=
ng intruding meats was=20

sharpened by the hope of substantial recognition in the way of a stray rib =
extracted from the=20

marauding offender  "All of them?"  "Yes, sir."  "Thanks. Well, it's not to=
o late to have a=20

messenger, is it?"  "Oh _no_, sir." ("'Too late' in the Grand Babylon, oh C=
zar!" said the valet's=20

shocked tone.)  "Then please get a messenger to take this letter, at once."=
  "In a cab, sir?"  "Yes,=20

in a cab. I don't know whether there will be an answer. He will see. Then l=
et him call at the cloak-

room at South Kensington Station and get my luggage. Here's the ticket."  "=
Thank you, sir."  "I can=20

rely on you to see that he goes at once?"  "You can, sir," said the valet, =
in such accents as carry=20

absolute conviction.  "Thank you. That will do, I think."  The man retired,=
 and the door was closed=20

by an expert in closing doors, one who had devoted his life to the perfecti=
on of detail in valetry.=20

_Fame_   He lay on the sofa at the foot of the bed, with all illumination e=
xtinguished save one=20

crimson-shaded light immediately above him. The evening papers--white, gree=
n, rose, cream, and=20



yellow--shared his couch. He was about to glance at the obituaries; to glan=
ce at them in a=20

careless, condescending way, just to see the _sort_ of thing that journalis=
ts had written of him. He=20

knew the value of obituaries; he had often smiled at them. He knew also the=
 exceeding fatuity of=20

art criticism, which did not cause him even to smile, being simply a bore. =
He recollected, further,=20

that he was not the first man to read his own obituary; the adventure had h=
appened to others; and=20

he could recall how, on his having heard that owing to an error it had happ=
ened to the great so-

and-so, he, in his quality of philosopher, had instantly decided what frame=
 of mind the great so-

and-so ought to have assumed for the perusal of his biography. He carefully=
 and deliberately=20

adopted that frame of mind now. He thought of Marcus Aurelius on the futili=
ty of fame; he=20

remembered his life-long attitude of gentle, tired scorn for the press; he =
reflected with wise=20

modesty that in art nothing counts but the work itself, and that no quantit=
y of inept chatter could=20

possibly affect, for good or evil, his value, such as it might be, to the w=
orld.  Then he began to=20

open the papers.  The first glimpse of their contents made him jump. In fac=
t, the physical result of=20

it was quite extraordinary. His temperature increased. His heart became aud=
ible. His pulse=20

quickened. And there was a tingling as far off as his toes. He had felt, in=
 a dim, unacknowledged=20

way, that he must be a pretty great painter. Of course his prices were noto=
rious. And he had=20

guessed, though vaguely, that he was the object of widespread curiosity. Bu=
t he had never=20

compared himself with Titanic figures on the planet. It had always seemed t=
o him that _his_=20

renown was different from other renowns, less--somehow unreal and make-beli=
eve. He had never=20

imaginatively grasped, despite prices and public inquisitiveness, that he t=
oo was one of the Titanic=20

figures. He grasped it now. The aspect of the papers brought it home to him=
 with tremendous=20

force.  Special large type! Titles stretching across two columns! Black bor=
ders round the pages!=20

"Death of England's greatest painter." "Sudden death of Priam Farll." "Sad =
death of a great=20

genius." "Puzzling career prematurely closed." "Europe in mourning." "Irrep=
arable loss to the=20

world's art." "It is with the most profound regret." "Our readers will be s=
hocked." "The news will=20

come as a personal blow to every lover of great painting." So the papers we=
nt on, outvying each=20

other in enthusiastic grief.  He ceased to be careless and condescending to=
 them. The skin crept=20

along his spine. There he lay, solitary, under the crimson glow, locked in =
his castle, human, with=20

the outward semblance of a man like other men, and yet the cities of Europe=
 were weeping for=20

him. He heard them weeping. Every lover of great painting was under a sense=
 of personal=20

bereavement. The very voice of the world was hushed. After all, it was some=
thing to have done=20

your best; after all, good stuff _was_ appreciated by the mass of the race.=
 The phenomena=20

presented by the evening papers was certainly prodigious, and prodigiously =
affecting. Mankind=20

was unpleasantly stunned by the report of his decease. He forgot that Mrs. =
Challice, for instance,=20

had perfectly succeeded in hiding her grief for the irreparable loss, and t=
hat her questions about=20

Priam Farll had been almost perfunctory. He forgot that he had witnessed ab=
solutely no sign of=20

overwhelming sorrow, or of any degree of sorrow, in the thoroughfares of th=
e teeming capital, and=20

that the hotels did not resound to sobbing. He knew only that all Europe wa=
s in mourning!  "I=20

suppose I was rather wonderful--_am_, I mean"--he said to himself, dazed an=
d happy. Yes, happy.=20

"The fact is, I've got so used to my own work that perhaps I don't think en=
ough of it." He said this=20

as modestly as he could.  There was no question now of casually glancing at=
 the obituaries. He=20

could not miss a single line, a single word. He even regretted that the det=
ails of his life were so few=20



and unimportant. It seemed to him that it was the business of the journalis=
ts to have known more,=20

to have displayed more enterprise in acquiring information. Still, the tone=
 was right. The fellows=20

meant well, at any rate. His eyes encountered nothing but praise. Indeed th=
e press of London had=20

yielded itself up to an encomiastic orgy. His modesty tried to say that thi=
s was slightly overdone;=20

but his impartiality asked, "Really, what _could_ they say against me?" As =
a rule unmitigated=20

praise was nauseous but here they were undoubtedly genuine, the fellows; th=
eir sentences rang=20

true!  Never in his life had he been so satisfied with the scheme of the un=
iverse! He was nearly=20

consoled for the dissolution of Leek.  When, after continued reading, he ca=
me across a phrase=20

which discreetly insinuated, apropos of the policeman and the penguins, tha=
t capriciousness in the=20

choice of subject was perhaps a pose with him, the accusation hurt.  "Pose!=
" he inwardly=20

exclaimed. "What a lie! The man's an ass!"  And he resented the following r=
emark which=20

concluded a 'special memoir' extremely laudatory in matter and manner, by a=
n expert whose=20

books he had always respected: "However, contemporary judgments are in the =
large majority of=20

cases notoriously wrong, and it behooves us to remember this in choosing a =
niche for our idol.=20

Time alone can settle the ultimate position of Priam Farll."  Useless for h=
is modesty to whisper to=20

him that contemporary judgments _were_ notoriously wrong. He did not like i=
t. It disturbed him.=20

There were exceptions to every rule. And if the connoisseur meant anything =
at all, he was simply=20

stultifying the rest of the article. Time be d----d!  He had come nearly to=
 the last line of the last=20

obituary before he was finally ruffled. Most of the sheets, in excusing the=
 paucity of biographical=20

detail, had remarked that Priam Farll was utterly unknown to London society=
, of a retiring=20

disposition, hating publicity, a recluse, etc. The word "recluse" grated on=
 his sensitiveness a little;=20

but when the least important of the evening papers roundly asserted it to b=
e notorious that he was=20

of extremely eccentric habits, he grew secretly furious. Neither his modest=
y nor his philosophy was=20

influential enough to restore him to complete calm.  Eccentric! He! What ne=
xt? Eccentric, indeed!=20

Now, what conceivable justification------?   _The Ruling Classes_   Between=
 a quarter-past and=20

half-past eleven he was seated alone at a small table in the restaurant of =
the Grand Babylon. He=20

had had no news of Mrs. Challice; she had not instantly telegraphed to Selw=
ood Terrace, as he=20

had wildly hoped. But in the boxes of Henry Leek, safely retrieved by the m=
essenger from South=20

Kensington Station, he had discovered one of his old dress-suits, not too o=
ld, and this dress-suit=20

he had donned. The desire to move about unknown in the well-clad world, the=
 world of the=20

frequenters of costly hotels, the world to which he was accustomed, had ove=
rtaken him. Moreover,=20

he felt hungry. Hence he had descended to the famous restaurant, whose wide=
 windows were=20

flung open to the illuminated majesty of the Thames Embankment. The pale cr=
eam room was=20

nearly full of expensive women, and expending men, and silver-chained waite=
rs whose skilled,=20

noiseless, inhuman attentions were remunerated at the rate of about four-pe=
nce a minute. Music,=20

the midnight food of love, floated scarce heard through the tinted atmosphe=
re. It was the best=20

imitation of Roman luxury that London could offer, and after Selwood Terrac=
e and the rackety=20

palace of no gratuities, Priam Farll enjoyed it as one enjoys home after st=
range climes.  Next to his=20

table was an empty table, set for two, to which were presently conducted, w=
ith due state, a young=20

man, and a magnificent woman whose youth was slipping off her polished shou=
lders like a cloak.=20

Priam Farll then overheard the following conversation:--  _Man_: Well, what=
 are you going to=20

have?  _Woman_: But look here, little Charlie, you can't possibly afford to=
 pay for this!  _Man_:=20



Never said I could. It's the paper that pays. So go ahead.  _Woman_: Is Lor=
d Nasing so keen as=20

all that?  _Man_: It isn't Lord Nasing. It's our brand new editor specially=
 imported from Chicago.=20

_Woman_: Will he last?  _Man_: He'll last a hundred nights, say as long as =
the run of your piece.=20

Then he'll get six months' screw and the boot.  _Woman_: How much is six mo=
nths' screw?=20

_Man_: Three thousand.  _Woman_: Well, I can hardly earn that myself.  _Man=
_: Neither can I.=20

But then you see we weren't born in Chicago.  _Woman_: I've been offered a =
thousand dollars a=20

week to go there, anyhow.  _Man_: Why didn't you tell me that for the inter=
view? I've spent two=20

entire entr'actes in trying to get something interesting out of you, and th=
ere you go and keep a=20

thing like that up your sleeve. It's not fair to an old and faithful admire=
r. I shall stick it in. Poulet=20

chasseur?  _Woman_: Oh no! Couldn't dream of it. Didn't you know I was diet=
ing? Nothing saucy.=20

No sugar. No bread. No tea. Thanks to that I've lost nearly a stone in six =
months. You know I=20

_was_ getting enormous.  _Man_: Let me put _that_ in, eh?  _Woman_: Just tr=
y, and see what=20

happens to you!  _Man_: Well, shall we say a lettuce salad, and a Perrier a=
nd soda? I'm dieting,=20

too.  _Waiter_: Lettuce salad, and a Perrier and soda? Yes, sir.  _Woman_: =
You aren't very gay.=20

_Man_: Gay! You don't know all the yearnings of my soul. Don't imagine that=
 because I'm a=20

special of the _Record_ I haven't got a soul.  _Woman_: I suppose you've be=
en reading that book,=20

Omar Khayyam, that every one's talking about. Isn't that what it's called? =
 _Man_: Has Omar=20

Khayyam reached the theatrical world? Well, there's no doubt the earth does=
 move, after all.=20

_Woman_: A little more soda, please. And just a trifle less impudence. What=
 book ought one to be=20

reading, then?  _Man_: Socialism's the thing just now. Read Wells on Social=
ism. It'll be all over the=20

theatrical world in a few years' time.  _Woman_: No fear! I can't bear Well=
s. He's always stirring up=20

the dregs. I don't mind froth, but I do draw the line at dregs. What's the =
band playing? What have=20

you been doing to-day? _Is_ this lettuce?=20


_
of war had brought it too near our lines.  As a rule, Carlo, what with his =
guard duties and other=20

purely routine items, managed to dispose of the day until dress parade. At =
that time he appeared=20

at his best, and became the regimental dog.  No officer or soldier connecte=
d with the command=20

more fully appreciated "The pomp and circumstance of great and glorious war=
" than he. As the=20

band marched out to take position previous to playing for the companies to =
assemble, he would=20

place himself alongside the drum-major, and, when the signal for marching w=
as given, would=20

move off with stately and solemn tread, with head well up, looking straight=
 to the front. Upon those=20

great occasions, he fully realized the dignity of his position, and woe bet=
ide any unhappy other dog=20

that happened to get in front of the marching band. When upon the parade fi=
eld, he became, next=20

to the colonel, the commanding officer, and ever regarded himself as the re=
gulator of the conduct=20

of those careless and frivolous dogs, that go about the world like street u=
rchins, having no=20

character for respectability or position in society to sustain.  Of those c=
areless ne'er-do-wells the=20

company had accumulated a very large following. As a rule, they were harmle=
ss and=20

companionable, and were always on hand ready for a free lunch. It was only =
on dress parade that=20

they made themselves over-officious. Each company was attended to the parad=
e ground by its=20

particular family of canine companions, and, when all of them had assembled=
, the second=20

battalion of the regiment would make itself known by a great variety of jum=
pings, caperings, barks=20

of joy, and cries of delight. To this unseasonable hilarity Carlo seriously=
 objected, and his actions=20

plainly told the story of his disgust at the conduct of the silly members o=
f his race. He usually=20

remained a passive observer until the exercise in the manual of arms, at wh=
ich particular period in=20

the ceremonies, the caperings and the barkings would become quite unendurab=
le. Our hero would=20

then assume the character of a preserver of the peace. He would make for th=
e nearest group of=20

revellers, and, in as many seconds, give a half dozen or more of them vigor=
ous shakes, which=20

would set them to howling, and warn the others of the thoughtless tribe of =
an impending danger.=20

Immediately the offenders would all scamper to another part of the field, a=
nd remain quiet until the=20

dress parade was over. This duty was self-imposed and faithfully performed =
upon many=20

occasions.  After the parade was dismissed Carlo would march back to quarte=
rs with his own=20

company, where he would remain until the last daily distributions of ration=
s, whereupon, after=20

having disposed of his share, he would start out upon a tour of regimental =
inspection, making=20

friendly calls at various company quarters and by taps turning up at the he=
adquarters of the guard.=20

His duties ended for the day, he would enjoy his well-earned rest until rev=
eille, unless some event=20

of an unusual nature, occurring during the night, disturbed his repose and =
demanded his attention.=20

During the first year of his service in the field, Carlo was very fortunate=
. He had shared in all the=20

transportations by water, in all the marchings, skirmishes, and battles, wi=
thout receiving a scratch=20

or having a day's illness. But his good fortune was soon to end, for it was=
 ordained that, like other=20

brave defenders, he was to suffer in the great cause for which all were ris=
king their lives.  The=20

morning of April 18, 1862, my brigade, then stationed at Roanoke Island, em=
barked upon the=20

steamer _Ocean Wave_ for an expedition up the Elizabeth River, the object o=
f which was to=20

destroy the locks of the Dismal Swamp canal in order to prevent several ima=
ginary iron-clads from=20

getting into Albemarle Sound.  Among the first to embark was the ever ready=
 and faithful Carlo,=20

and the next morning, when his companions disembarked near Elizabeth City, =
he was one of the=20

first to land, and, during the whole of the long and dreary march of thirty=
 miles to Camden Court=20



House, lasting from three o'clock in the morning until one in the afternoon=
, he was ever on the=20

alert, but keeping close to his regiment. The field of battle was reached; =
the engagement, in which=20

his command met with a great loss, commenced and ended, and, when the parti=
culars of the=20

disaster were inventoried, it was ascertained that a Confederate bullet had=
 taken the rudimentary=20

claw from Carlo's left fore-leg. This was his first wound, and he bore it l=
ike a hero without a whine=20

or even a limp. A private of Co. G, who first noticed the wound, exclaimed:=
 "Ah, Carlo, what a pity=20

you are not an officer! If you were, the loss of that claw would give you s=
ixty days' leave and a=20

brigadier general's commission at the end of it." That was about the time t=
hat generals'=20

commissions had become very plentiful in the Department of North Carolina. =
 The command re-

embarked, and reached Roanoke Island the morning after the engagement, in t=
ime for the=20

regulation "Hospital or Sick Call," which that day brought together an unus=
ual number of patients,=20

and among them Carlo, who was asked to join the waiting line by one of the =
wounded men. When=20

his turn came to be inspected by the attending surgeon, he was told to hold=
 up the wounded leg,=20

which he readily did, and then followed the washing, the application of sim=
ple cerate, and the=20

bandaging, with a considerable show of interest and probable satisfaction. =
 Thereafter, there was=20

no occasion to ask him to attend the surgeon's inspection. Each morning, as=
 soon as the bugle=20

call was sounded, he would take his place in line with the other patients, =
advance in his turn, and=20

receive the usual treatment. This habit continued until the wound was heale=
d.  Always, after this,=20

to every friendly greeting, he would respond by holding up the wounded leg =
for inspection, and he=20

acted as though he thought that everybody was interested in the honorable s=
car that told the story=20

of patriotic duty faithfully performed.  Later on, for some reason known to=
 himself, Carlo=20

transferred his special allegiance to Co. K. and maintained close connectio=
n with that company=20

until the end of his term of service. He was regarded by its members as a m=
ember of the company=20

mess, and was treated as one of them. But, notwithstanding his special atta=
chments, there can be=20

no reasonable doubt about his having considered himself a member of the reg=
iment, clothed with=20

certain powers and responsibilities. At the end of his term he was fitted w=
ith a uniform--trousers,=20

jacket, and fez, and, thus dressed, he marched up Broadway, immediately beh=
ind the band. He=20

was soon after mustered out of the service, and received an honorable disch=
arge, not signed with=20

written characters, but attested by the good-will of every member of the re=
giment.    A BRAVE=20

DOG  By Sir Samuel W. Baker  When I was a boy, my grandfather frequently to=
ld a story=20

concerning a dog which he knew, as a more than ordinary example of the fide=
lity so frequently=20

exhibited by the race. This animal was a mastiff that belonged to an intima=
te friend, to whom it was=20

a constant companion. It was an enormous specimen of that well-known breed,=
 which is not=20

generally celebrated for any peculiar intelligence, but is chiefly remarkab=
le for size and strength.=20

This dog had been brought up by its master from puppyhood, and as the propr=
ietor was a single=20

man, there had been no division of affection, as there would have been had =
the dog belonged to a=20

family of several members. Turk regarded nobody but his owner. (I shall now=
 honour Turk by the=20

masculine gender.)  Whenever Mr. Prideaux went out for a walk, Turk was sur=
e to be near his=20

heels. Street dogs would bark and snarl at the giant as his massive form at=
tracted their attention,=20

but Turk seldom condescended to notice such vulgar demonstrations; he was a=
 noble-looking=20

creature, somewhat resembling a small lioness; but although he was gentle a=
nd quiet in=20

disposition, he had upon several occasions been provoked beyond endurance, =
and his attack had=20



been nearly always fatal to his assailants. He slept at night outside his m=
aster's door, and no=20

sentry could be more alert upon his watch than the faithful dog, who had ap=
parently only one=20

ambition--to protect, and to accompany his owner.  Mr. Prideaux had a dinne=
r-party. He never=20

invited ladies, but simply entertained his friends as a bachelor; his dinne=
rs were but secondary to=20

the quality of his guests, however, who were always men of reputation eithe=
r in the literary world,=20

or in the modern annals of society. The dog Turk was invariably present, an=
d usually stretched his=20

huge form upon the hearth-rug.  It was a cold night in winter, when Mr. Pri=
deaux's friends were=20

talking after dinner, that the conversation turned upon the subject of dogs=
. Almost every person=20

had an anecdote to relate, and my own grandfather being present, had no dou=
bt added his mite to=20

the collection, when Turk suddenly awoke from a sound sleep, and having str=
etched himself until=20

he appeared to be awake to the situation, walked up to his master's side, a=
nd rested his large=20

head upon the table.  "Ha ha, Turk!" exclaimed Mr. Prideaux, "you must have=
 heard our=20

arguments about the dogs, so you have put in an appearance."  "And a magnif=
icent specimen he=20

is!" remarked my grandfather; "but although a mastiff is the largest and mo=
st imposing of the race,=20

I do not think it is as sensible as many others."  "As a rule you are right=
," replied his master,=20

"because they are generally chained up as watch-dogs, and have not the inti=
mate association with=20

human beings which is so great an advantage to house-dogs; but Turk has bee=
n my constant=20

companion from the first month of his existence, and his intelligence is ve=
ry remarkable. He=20

understands most things that I say, if they are connected with himself; he =
will often lie upon the rug=20

with his large eyes fixed upon me as though searching my inward thoughts, a=
nd he will frequently=20

be aware instinctively that I wish to go out; upon such times he will fetch=
 my hat, cane, or gloves,=20

whichever may be at hand, and wait for me at the front door. He will take a=
 letter or any other=20

token to several houses of my acquaintance, and wait for a reply; and he ca=
n perform a variety of=20

actions that would imply a share of reason seldom possessed by other dogs."=
  A smile of=20

incredulity upon several faces was at once perceived by Mr. Prideaux, who i=
mmediately took a=20

guinea from his pocket, and addressed his dog. "Here, Turk! they won't beli=
eve in you! ... take this=20

guinea to No.--,--Street, to Mr.--, and bring me a receipt."  The dog wagge=
d his huge tail with=20

evident pleasure, and the guinea having been placed in his mouth, he hasten=
ed towards the door;=20

this being opened, he was admitted through the front entrance to the street=
. It was a miserable=20

night; the wind was blowing the sleet and rain against the windows; the gut=
ters were running with=20

muddy water, and the weather was exactly that which is expressed by the com=
mon term, "not fit to=20

turn a dog out in;" nevertheless, Turk had started upon his mission in the =
howling gale and=20

darkness, while the front door was once more closed against the blast.  The=
 party were=20

comfortably seated around the fire, and much interested in the success or f=
ailure of the dog's=20

adventure.  "How long will it be before we may expect Turk's return?" inqui=
red an incredulous=20

guest.  "The house to which I have sent him is about a mile and a half dist=
ant, therefore if there is=20

no delay when he barks for admission at the door, and my friend is not abse=
nt from home, he=20

should return in about three-quarters of an hour with an acknowledgment. If=
, on the other hand, he=20

cannot gain admission, he may wait for any length of time," replied his mas=
ter.  Bets were=20

exchanged among the company--some supported the dog's chances of success, w=
hile others=20

were against him.  The evening wore away; the allotted time was exceeded, a=
nd a whole hour had=20

passed, but no dog had returned. Fresh bets were made, but the odds were ag=
ainst the dog. His=20



master was still hopeful.... "I must tell you," said Mr. Prideaux, "that Tu=
rk frequently carries notes=20

for me, and as he knows the house well, he certainly will not make a mistak=
e; perhaps my friend=20

may be dining out, in which case Turk will probably wait for a longer time"=
.... Two hours passed ...=20

the storm was raging. Mr. Prideaux himself went to the front door, which fl=
ew open before a fierce=20

gust the instant that the lock was turned. The clouds were rushing past a m=
oon but faintly visible at=20

short intervals, and the gutters were clogged with masses of half-melted sn=
ow. "Poor Turk!"=20

muttered his master, "this is indeed a wretched night for you.... Perhaps t=
hey have kept you in the=20

warm kitchen, and will not allow you to return in such fearful weather."  W=
hen Mr. Prideaux=20

returned to his guests he could not conceal his disappointment. "Ha!" excla=
imed one who had=20

betted against the dog, "I never bread. Didn't you hear me tell you?  _Man_=
: I've been busy with=20

the Priam Farll affair.  _Woman_: Priam Farll?  _Man_: Yes. Painter. _You_ =
know.  _Woman_: Oh=20

yes. _Him_! I saw it on the posters. He's dead, it seems. Anything mysterio=
us?  _Man_: You bet!=20

Very odd! Frightfully rich, you know! Yet he died in a wretched hovel of a =
place down off the=20

Fulham Road. And his valet's disappeared. We had the first news of the deat=
h, through our=20

arrangement with all the registrars' clerks in London. By the bye, don't gi=
ve that away--it's our=20

speciality. Nasing sent me off at once to write up the story.  _Woman_: Sto=
ry?  _Man_: The=20

particulars. We always call it a story in Fleet Street.  _Woman_: What a go=
od name! Well, did you=20

find out anything interesting?  _Man_: Not very much. I saw his cousin, Dun=
can Farll, a money-

lending lawyer in Clement's Lane--he only heard of it because we telephoned=
 to him. But the=20

fellow would scarcely tell me anything at all.  _Woman_: Really! I do hope =
there's something=20

terrible.  _Man_: Why?  _Woman_: So that I can go to the inquest or the pol=
ice court or whatever it=20

is. That's why I always keep friendly with magistrates. It's so frightfully=
 thrilling, sitting on the bench=20

with them.  _Man_: There won't be any inquest. But there's something queer =
in it. You see, Priam=20

Farll was never in England. Always abroad; at those foreign hotels, wanderi=
ng up and down.=20

_Woman (after a pause)_: I know.  _Man_: What do you know?  _Woman_: Will y=
ou promise not=20

to chatter?  _Man_: Yes.  _Woman_: I met him once at an hotel at Ostend. He=
--well, he wanted=20

most tremendously to paint my portrait. But I wouldn't let him.  _Man_: Why=
 not?  _Woman_: If you=20

knew what sort of man he was you wouldn't ask.  _Man_: Oh! But look here, I=
 say! You must let=20

me use that in my story. Tell me all about it.  _Woman_: Not for worlds.  _=
Man_: He--he made up=20

to you?  _Woman_: Rather!  _Priam Farll (to himself)_: What a barefaced lie=
! Never was at Ostend=20

in my life.  _Man_: Can't I use it if I don't print your name--just say a d=
istinguished actress.=20

_Woman_: Oh yes, you can do _that_. You might say, of the musical comedy st=
age.  _Man_: I will.=20

I'll run something together. Trust me. Thanks awfully.  At this point a you=
ng and emaciated priest=20

passed up the room.  _Woman_: Oh! Father Luke, is that you? Do come and sit=
 here and be nice.=20

This is Father Luke Widgery--Mr. Docksey, of the _Record_.  _Man_: Delighte=
d.  _Priest_:=20

Delighted.  _Woman_: Now, Father Luke, I've just _got_ to come to your serm=
on to-morrow.=20

What's it about?  _Priest_: Modern vice.  _Woman_: How charming! I read the=
 last one--it was=20

lovely.  _Priest_: Unless you have a ticket you'll never be able to get in.=
  _Woman_: But I must get=20

in. I'll come to the vestry door, if there is a vestry door at St. Bede's. =
 _Priest_: It's impossible.=20

You've no idea of the crush. And I've no favourites.  _Woman_: Oh yes, you =
have! You have me.=20

_Priest_: In my church, fashionable women must take their chance with the r=
est.  _Woman_: How=20

horrid you are.  _Priest_: Perhaps. I may tell you, Miss Cohenson, that I'v=
e seen two duchesses=20



standing at the back of the aisle of St. Bede's, and glad to be.  _Woman_: =
But _I_ shan't flatter you=20

by standing at the back of your aisle, and you needn't think it. Haven't I =
given you a box before=20

now?  _Priest_: I only accepted the box as a matter of duty; it is part of =
my duty to go everywhere.=20

_Man_: Come with me, Miss Cohenson. I've got two tickets for the _Record_. =
 _Woman_: Oh, so=20

you do send seats to the press?  _Priest_: The press is different. Waiter, =
bring me half a bottle of=20

Heidsieck.  _Waiter_: Half a bottle of Heidsieck? Yes, sir.  _Woman_: Heids=
ieck. Well, I like that.=20

_We're_ dieting.  _Priest: I_ don't like Heidsieck. But I'm dieting too. It=
's my doctor's orders. Every=20

night before retiring. It appears that my system needs it. Maria Lady Rownd=
ell insists on giving me=20

a hundred a year to pay for it. It is her own beautiful way of helping the =
good cause. Ice, please,=20

waiter. I've just been seeing her to-night. She's staying here for the seas=
on. Saves her a lot of=20

trouble. She's very much cut up about the death of Priam Farll, poor thing!=
 So artistic, you know!=20

The late Lord Rowndell had what is supposed to be the finest lot of Farlls =
in England.  _Man_: Did=20

you ever meet Priam Farll, Father Luke?  _Priest_: Never. I understand he w=
as most eccentric. I=20

hate eccentricity. I once wrote to him to ask him if he would paint a Holy =
Family for St. Bede's.=20

_Man_: And what did he reply?  _Priest_: He didn't reply. Considering that =
he wasn't even an R.A.,=20

I don't think that it was quite nice of him. However, Maria Lady Rowndell i=
nsists that he must be=20

buried in Westminster Abbey. She asked me what I could do.  _Woman_: Buried=
 in Westminster=20

Abbey! I'd no idea he was so big as all that! Gracious!  _Priest_: I have t=
he greatest confidence in=20

Maria Lady Rowndell's taste, and certainly I bear no grudge. I may be able =
to arrange something.=20

My uncle the Dean----  _Man_: Pardon me. I always understood that since you=
 left the Church----=20

_Priest_: Since I joined the Church, you mean. There is but one.  _Man_: Ch=
urch of England, I=20

meant.  _Priest_: Ah!  _Man_: Since you left the Church of England, there h=
ad been a breach=20

between the Dean and yourself.  _Priest_: Merely religious. Besides my sist=
er is the Dean's=20

favourite niece. And I am her favourite brother. My sister takes much inter=
est in art. She has just=20

painted a really exquisite tea-cosy for me. Of course the Dean ultimately s=
ettles these questions of=20

national funerals, Hence...  At this point the invisible orchestra began to=
 play "God save the King."=20

_Woman_: Oh! What a bore!  Then nearly all the lights were extinguished.  _=
Waiter_: Please,=20

gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!  _Priest_: You quite understand, Mr. Docksey,=
 that I merely gave=20

these family details in order to substantiate my statement that I may be ab=
le to arrange something.=20

By the way, if you would care to have a typescript of my sermon to-morrow f=
or the _Record_, you=20

can have one by applying at the vestry.  _Waiter_: Please, gentlemen!  _Man=
_: So good of you.=20

As regards the burial in Westminster Abbey, I think that the _Record_ will =
support the project. I say=20

I _think_.  _Priest_: Maria Lady Rowndell will be grateful.  Five-sixths of=
 the remaining lights went=20

out, and the entire company followed them. In the foyer there was a prodigi=
ous crush of opera=20

cloaks, silk hats, and cigars, all jostling together. News arrived from the=
 Strand that the weather=20

had turned to rain, and all the intellect of the Grand Babylon was centred =
upon the British climate,=20

exactly as if the British climate had been the latest discovery of science.=
 As the doors swung to=20

and fro, the stridency of whistles, the throbbing of motor-cars, and the ho=
arse cries of inhabitants=20

of box seats mingled strangely with the delicate babble of the interior. Th=
en, lo! as by magic, the=20

foyer was empty save for the denizens of the hotel who could produce eviden=
ce of identity. It had=20

been proved to demonstration, for the sixth time that week, that in the met=
ropolis of the greatest of=20

Empires there is not one law for the rich and another for the poor.  Deeply=
 affected by what he had=20



overheard, Priam Farll rose in a lift and sought his bed. He perceived clea=
rly that he had been=20

among the governing classes of the realm.         *       *       *       *=
       *     CHAPTER IV   _A=20

Scoop_   Within less than twelve hours after that conversation between memb=
ers of the governing=20

classes at the Grand Babylon Hotel, Priam Farll heard the first deep-throat=
ed echoes of the voice=20

of England on the question of his funeral. The voice of England issued on t=
his occasion through=20

the mouth of the _Sunday News_, a newspaper which belonged to Lord Nasing, =
the proprietor of=20

the _Daily Record_. There was a column in the _Sunday News_, partly concern=
ing the meeting of=20

Priam Farll and a celebrated star of the musical comedy stage at Ostend. Th=
ere was also a=20

leading article, in which it was made perfectly clear that England would st=
and ashamed among the=20

nations, if she did not inter her greatest painter in Westminster Abbey. On=
ly the article, instead of=20

saying Westminster Abbey, said National Valhalla. It seemed to make a point=
 of not mentioning=20

Westminster Abbey by name, as though Westminster Abbey had been something n=
ot quite=20

mentionable, such as a pair of trousers. The article ended with the word 'b=
asilica,' and by the time=20

you had reached this majestic substantive, you felt indeed, with the _Sunda=
y News_, that a=20

National Valhalla without the remains of a Priam Farll inside it, would be =
shocking, if not=20

inconceivable.  Priam Farll was extremely disturbed.  On Monday morning the=
 _Daily Record_=20

came nobly to the support of the _Sunday News_. It had evidently spent its =
Sunday in collecting=20

the opinions of a number of famous men--including three M.P.'s, a banker, a=
 Colonial premier, a=20

K.C., a cricketer, and the President of the Royal Academy--as to whether th=
e National Valhalla=20

was or was not a suitable place for the repose of the remains of Priam Farl=
l; and the unanimous=20

reply was in the affirmative. Other newspapers expressed the same view. But=
 there were=20

opponents of the scheme. Some organs coldly inquired what Priam Farll had _=
done_ for England,=20

and particularly for the higher life of England. He had not been a moral pa=
inter like Hogarth or Sir=20

Noel Paton, nor a worshipper of classic legend and beauty like the unique L=
eighton. He had=20

openly scorned England. He had never lived in England. He had avoided the R=
oyal Academy,=20

honouring every country save his own. And was he such a great painter, afte=
r all? Was he=20

anything but a clever dauber whose work had been forced into general admira=
tion by the efforts of=20

a small clique of eccentric admirers? Far be it from them, the organs, to d=
ecry a dead man, but the=20

National Valhalla was the National Valhalla.... And so on.  The penny eveni=
ng papers were pro-

Farll, one of them furiously so. You gathered that if Priam Farll was not b=
uried in Westminster=20

Abbey the penny evening papers would, from mere disgust, wipe their boots o=
n Dover cliffs and=20

quit England eternally for some land where art was understood. You gathered=
, by nightfall, that=20

Fleet Street must be a scene of carnage, full of enthusiasts cutting each o=
ther's throats for the=20

sake of the honour of art. However, no abnormal phenomenon was superficiall=
y observable in=20

Fleet Street; nor was martial law proclaimed at the Arts Club in Dover Stre=
et. London was=20

impassioned by the question of Farll's funeral; a few hours would decide if=
 England was to be=20

shamed among the nations: and yet the town seemed to pursue its jog-trot wa=
y exactly as usual.=20

The Gaiety Theatre performed its celebrated nightly musical comedy, "House =
Full"; and at=20

Queen's Hall quite a large audience was collected to listen to a violinist =
aged twelve, who played=20

like a man, though a little one, and whose services had been bought for sev=
en years by a limited=20

company.  The next morning the controversy was settled by one of the _Daily=
 Record's_=20

characteristic 'scoops.' In the nature of the case, such controversies, if =
they are not settled quickly,=20



settle themselves quickly; they cannot be prolonged. But it was the _Daily =
Record_ that settled this=20

one. The _Daily Record_ came out with a copy of the will of Priam Farll, in=
 which, after leaving a=20

pound a week for life to his valet, Henry Leek, Priam Farll bequeathed the =
remainder of his fortune=20

to the nation for the building and up-keep of a Gallery of Great Masters. P=
riam Farll's own=20

collection of great masters, gradually made by him in that inexpensive mann=
er which is possible=20

only to the finest connoisseurs, was to form the nucleus of the Gallery. It=
 comprised, said the=20

_Record_, several Rembrandts, a Velasquez, six Vermeers, a Giorgione, a Tur=
ner, a Charles, two=20

Cromes, a Holbein. (After Charles the _Record_ put a note of interrogation,=
 itself being uncertain=20

of the name.) The pictures were in Paris--had been for many years. The lead=
ing idea of the=20

Gallery was that nothing not absolutely first-class should be admitted to i=
t. The testator attached=20

two conditions to the bequest. One was that his own name should be inscribe=
d nowhere in the=20

building, and the other was that none of his own pictures should be admitte=
d to the gallery. Was=20

not this sublime? Was not this true British pride? Was not this magnificent=
ly unlike the ordinary=20

benefactor of his country? The _Record_ was in a position to assert that Pr=
iam Farll's estate would=20

amount to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds, in addition to the val=
ue of the pictures.=20

After that, was anybody going to argue that he ought not to be buried in th=
e National Valhalla, a=20

philanthropist so royal and so proudly meek?  The opposition gave up.  Pria=
m Farll grew more and=20

more disturbed in his fortress at the Grand Babylon Hotel. He perfectly=20


_
probably gone into some house of entertainment where dogs are supplied with=
 dinner and a warm=20

bed, instead of shivering in a winter's gale!"  Jokes were made by the winn=
ers of bets at the=20

absent dog's expense, but his master was anxious and annoyed. The various b=
ets were paid by=20

the losers, and poor Turk's reputation had suffered severely.... It was lon=
g past midnight: the=20

guests were departed, the storm was raging, and violent gusts occasionally =
shook the house....=20

Mr. Prideaux was alone in his study, and he poked the fire until it blazed =
and roared up the=20

chimney....  "What can have become of that dog?" exclaimed his master to hi=
mself, now really=20

anxious; "I hope they kept him; ... most likely they would not send him bac=
k upon such a dreadful=20

night."  Mr. Prideaux's study was close to the front door, and his acute at=
tention was suddenly=20

directed to a violent shaking and scratching, accompanied by a prolonged wh=
ine. In an instant he=20

ran into the hall, and unlocked the entrance door.... A mass of filth and m=
ud entered.... This was=20

Turk!  The dog seemed dreadfully fatigued, and was shivering with wet and c=
old. His usually clean=20

coat was thick with mire, as though he had been dragged through deep mud. H=
e wagged his tail=20

when he heard his master's voice, but appeared dejected and ill.  Mr. Pride=
aux had rung the bell,=20

and the servants, who were equally interested as their master in Turk's fai=
lure to perform his=20

mission, had attended the summons. The dog was taken downstairs, and immedi=
ately placed in a=20

large tub of hot water, in which he was accustomed to be bathed. It was now=
 discovered that in=20

addition to mud and dirt, which almost concealed his coat, he was besmeared=
 with blood!  Mr.=20

Prideaux himself sponged his favourite with hot soap and water, and, to his=
 astonishment, he=20

perceived wounds of a serious nature: the dog's throat was badly torn, his =
back and breast were=20

deeply bitten, and there could be no doubt that he had been worried by a pa=
ck of dogs. This was a=20

strange occurrence, that Turk should be discomfited!  He was now washed cle=
an, and was being=20

rubbed dry with a thick towel while he stood upon a blanket before the kitc=
hen fire.... "Why, Turk,=20

old boy, what has been the matter? Tell us all about it, poor old man!" exc=
laimed his master.  The=20

dog was now thoroughly warmed, and he panted with the heat of the kitchen f=
ire; he opened his=20

mouth, ... _and the guinea which he had received in trust dropped on the ki=
tchen floor_!...  "There=20

is some mystery in this," said Mr. Prideaux, "which I will endeavour to dis=
cover to-morrow.... about=20

seventeen years before, after some champagne in Venice, in an hour of anger=
 against some=20

English criticisms of his work. Yes, English criticisms! It was his vanity =
that had prompted him to=20

reply in that manner. Moreover, he was quite young then. He remembered the =
youthful glee with=20

which he had appointed his next-of-kin, whoever they might be, executors an=
d trustees of the will.=20

He remembered his cruel joy in picturing their disgust at being compelled t=
o carry out the terms of=20

such a will. Often, since, he had meant to destroy the will; but carelessly=
 he had always omitted to=20

do so. And his collection and his fortune had continued to increase regular=
ly and mightily, and=20

now--well, there the thing was! Duncan Farll had found the will. And Duncan=
 Farll would be the=20

executor and trustee of that melodramatic testament.  He could not help smi=
ling, serious as the=20

situation was.  During that day the thing was settled; the authorities spok=
e; the word went forth.=20

Priam Farll was to be buried in Westminster Abbey on the Thursday. The dign=
ity of England=20

among artistic nations had been saved, partly by the heroic efforts of the =
_Daily Record_, and=20

partly by the will, which proved that after all Priam Farll had had the hig=
hest interests of his country=20

at heart.   _Cowardice_   On the night between Tuesday and Wednesday Priam =
Farll had not a=20

moment of sleep. Whether it was the deep-throated voice of England that had=
 spoken, or merely=20



the voice of the Dean's favourite niece--so skilled in painting tea-cosies-=
-the affair was excessively=20

serious. For the nation was preparing to inter in the National Valhalla the=
 remains of just Henry=20

Leek! Priam's mind had often a sardonic turn; he was assuredly capable of s=
trange caprices: but=20

even he could not permit an error so gigantic to continue. The matter must =
be rectified, and=20

instantly! And he alone could rectify it. The strain on his shyness would b=
e awful, would be=20

scarcely endurable. Nevertheless he must act. Quite apart from other consid=
erations, there was=20

the consideration of that hundred and forty thousand pounds, which was his,=
 and which he had not=20

the slightest desire to leave to the British nation. And as for giving his =
beloved pictures to the race=20

which adored Landseer, Edwin Long, and Leighton-- the idea nauseated him.  =
He must go and=20

see Duncan Farll! And explain! Yes, explain that he was not dead.  Then he =
had a vision of=20

Duncan Farll's hard, stupid face, and impenetrable steel head; and of himse=
lf being kicked out of=20

the house, or delivered over to a policeman, or in some subtler way=20


_
strange dogs, and rather than lose the guinea, he has allowed himself to be=
 half killed without=20

once opening his mouth in self-defence! Poor Turk!" continued his master, "=
you must have lost=20

your way, old man, in the darkness and storm; most likely confused after th=
e unequal fight. What=20

an example you have given us wretched humans in being steadfast to a trust!=
"  Turk was=20

wonderfully better after his warm bath. He lapped up a large bowl of good t=
hick soup mixed with=20

bread, and in half an hour was comfortably asleep upon his thick rug by his=
 master's bedroom=20

door....  Upon the following morning the storm had cleared away, and a brig=
ht sky had succeeded=20

to the gloom of the preceding night.  Immediately after breakfast, Mr. Prid=
eaux, accompanied by=20

his dog (who was, although rather stiff, not much the worse for the rough t=
reatment he had=20

received), started for a walk towards the house to which he had directed Tu=
rk upon the previous=20

evening. He was anxious to discover whether his friend had been absent, as =
he concluded that the=20

dog might have been waiting for admittance, and had been perhaps attacked b=
y some dogs=20

belonging to the house, or its neighbours'.  The master and Turk had walked=
 for nearly a mile, and=20

had just turned the corner of a street when, as they passed a butcher's sho=
p upon the right hand,=20

a large brindled mastiff rushed from the insulted. Could he confront Duncan=
 Farll? Was a hundred=20

and forty thousand pounds and the dignity of the British nation worth the b=
earding of Duncan=20

Farll? No! His distaste for Duncan Farll amounted to more than a hundred an=
d forty millions of=20

pounds and the dignity of whole planets. He felt that he could never bring =
himself to meet Duncan=20

Farll. Why, Duncan might shove him into a lunatic asylum, might...!  Still =
he must act.  Then it was=20

that occurred to him the brilliant notion of making a clean breast of it to=
 the Dean. He had not the=20

pleasure of the Dean's personal acquaintance. The Dean was an abstraction; =
certainly much more=20

abstract than Priam Farll. He thought he could meet the Dean. A terrific en=
terprise, but he must=20

accomplish it! After all, a Dean--what was it? Nothing but a man with a fun=
ny hat! And was not he=20

himself Priam Farll, the authentic Priam Farll, vastly greater than any Dea=
n?  He told the valet to=20

buy black gloves, and a silk hat, sized seven and a quarter, and to bring u=
p a copy of _Who's=20

Who_. He hoped the valet would be dilatory in executing these commands. But=
 the valet seemed=20

to fulfill them by magic. Time flew so fast that (in a way of speaking) you=
 could hardly see the=20

fingers as they whirled round the clock. And almost before he knew where he=
 was, two=20

commissionaires were helping him into an auto-cab, and the terrific=20


_
"Call your dog off!" shouted Mr. Prideaux to the butcher, who surveyed the =
attack with impudent=20

satisfaction.... "Call him off, or my dog will kill him!" continued Mr. Pri=
deaux.  The usually docile=20

Turk had rushed to meet his assailant with a fury that was extraordinary. W=
ith a growl like that of a=20

lion, he quickly seized his antagonist by the throat; rearing upon his hind=
 legs, he exerted his=20

tremendous strength, and in a fierce struggle of only a few seconds, he thr=
ew the brindled dog=20

upon its back. It was in vain that Mr. Prideaux endeavoured to call him off=
, the rage of his favourite=20

was quite ungovernable; he never for an instant relaxed his hold, but with =
the strength of a wild=20

beast of prey, Turk shook the head of the butcher's dog to the right and le=
ft until it struck each time=20

heavily against the pavement ... The butcher attempted to interfere, and la=
shed him with a huge=20

whip.  "Stand clear! fair play! don't you strike my dog!" shouted Mr. Pride=
aux. "Your dog was the=20

first to attack!"  In reply to the whip, Turk had redoubled his fury, and, =
without relinquishing his=20

hold, he had now dragged the butcher's dog off the pavement, and occasional=
ly shaking the body=20

as he pulled the unresisting mass along the gutter, he drew it into the mid=
dle of the street.  A large=20

crowd had collected, which completely stopped the easily have won the race =
for the Gordon=20

Bennett Cup. It was of about two hundred h.p., and it arrived in Dean's Yar=
d in less time than a=20

fluent speaker would take to say Jack Robinson. The rapidity of the flight =
was simply incredible.=20

"I'll keep you," Priam Farll was going to say, as he descended, but he thou=
ght it would be more=20

final to dismiss the machine; so he dismissed it.  He rang the bell with fr=
antic haste, lest he should=20

run away ere he had rung it. And then his heart went thumping, and the pers=
piration damped the=20

lovely lining of his new hat; and his legs trembled, literally!  He was in =
hell on the Dean's doorstep.=20

The door was opened by a man in livery of prelatical black, who eyed him in=
imically.  "Er----"=20

stammered Priam Farll, utterly flustered and craven. "Is this Mr. Parker's?=
"  Now Parker was not=20

the Dean's name, and Priam knew that it was not. Parker was merely the firs=
t name that had come=20

into Priam's cowardly head.  "No, it isn't," said the flunkey with censorio=
us lips. "It's the Dean's."=20

"Oh, I beg pardon," said Priam Farll. "I thought it was Mr. Parker's."  And=
 he departed.  Between=20

the ringing of the bell and the flunkey's appearance, he had clearly seen w=
hat he was capable,=20

and what he was incapable, of doing. And the correction of England's error =
was among his=20

incapacities. He could not face the Dean. He=20
