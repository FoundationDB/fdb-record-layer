The enemy made at once for the _
Serato, over them.  There were engines, boilers, dynamos, motors, diamond drills, steam shovels 

and a miniature railway, with mules as the motive power. A small village had sprung up at the 

tunnel mouth, and there was a general store, besides many buildings for the sleeping and eating 

quarters of the laborers, as well as places where the white men could live.  Their quarters were 

some distance from the native section.  Powder, supplies, in fact everything save what game could 

be obtained in the forest, or what grains or fruits were brought in by natives living near by, had to 

be brought over the rough trail. But Titus Brothers had a large experience in engineering matters 

in wild and desolate countries, and they knew how to be as comfortable as possible.  Mr. Damon 

learned that one of the districts whence his company had been in the habit of getting quinine was 

distant a day's journey over the mountain, so he decided to make the trip, with a native guide, and 

see if he could get at the bottom of the difficulty in forwarding shipments.  This was a few days 

after the arrival of our friends.  Meanwhile, Tom had been shown all through the tunnel by the 

Titus Brothers and had had his first sight of the hard cliff of rock which seemed to be a veritable 

stone wall in the way of progress--or at least such progress as was satisfactory to the contractors. 

"Well, we'll try what some of my explosive will do," said Tom, when he had finished the 

examination. "I don't claim it will be as successful as the sample blast we set off at Shopton, but 

we'll do our best."  Holes were drilled in the face of the rock, and several charges of the new 

explosive tamped in. Wires were attached to the fuses, which were of a new kind, and warning 

was given to clear the tunnel. The wires ran out to the mouth of the horizontal shaft and Tom, 

holding the switch in his hand made ready to set off the blast.  "Are they all out?" he asked Tim 

Sullivan, who had emerged, herding the Indian laborers before him. Tim insisted on being the last 

man to seek safety when an explosion was to take place.  "All ready, sor," answered the foreman. 

"Here she goes!" cried Tom, as his fingers closed the circuit.     Chapter XIV  Mysterious 

Disappearances   There was a dull, muffled report, a sort of rumbling that seemed to extend away 

down was not likely that the forts which the Chevalier de Troyes had wrested from the English 

would continue to remain in French possession without an effort being made to regain them.  One 

Captain Moon, returning from Port Nelson, endeavoured, with twenty-four men, to surprise the 

French at Fort Anne, which was the new name bestowed upon the captured Fort Albany.  Moon 

built a station eight miles away, but Iberville, who had been again sent to the Bay, instantly got 

wind of it, and, marching thither, drove the English out.  {143} When two Hudson's Bay Company's 

vessels arrived in these waters, winter overtook them, and they became locked in the ice.  The 

crews landed, and had nearly built a fort when Iberville fell upon them and made them all 

prisoners.  But there was one stronghold in the northern bay which continued to defy the French. 

This single fort was considered of so much importance, that the gain or loss of everything in 

Hudson's Bay depended upon it.  To capture it, however, required a stronger force than Iberville 

could at present command, whereupon he sailed away to France to ask assistance from the King. 

He revealed to His Majesty his plans for the capture of Fort Nelson, and was at length promised 

two ships in the following spring.  The royal promise was duly kept. After a hot bombardment of 

three weeks, the English Governor was obliged to surrender and the French standard hoisted over 

the captured stronghold.  Only for a year, however, did the stronghold remain in the enemy's 

possession, when it was recaptured by the Company, and threescore Frenchmen sent prisoners 

to England.  When Iberville heard of this fresh turn which events had taken, he ground his teeth 



with rage.  "Am I," he cried, "to go on capturing this fort from the English, only to have it repeatedly 

slip through our hands?" He then and there vowed to have nothing further to do with Hudson's 

Bay, he who had fought so many battles and won there so many victories.  As for the French 

prisoners, no sooner were they released than they crossed the Channel and sought {144} 

audience of their King.  Gazing upon this emaciated band of fur-hunters and bushrangers, Louis 

the Fourteenth would have been craven indeed if he had not attempted to retrieve their 

misfortunes.  Four ships of war were promised them. "And," said the 


_
ground near the mouth of the tunnel, where the party was standing, appeared to rock and heave. 

There followed a cloud of yellow, heavy smoke which made one choke and gasp, and Tom, seeing 

it, cried:  "Down! Down, everybody! There's a back draft, and if you breathe any of that powder 

vapor you'll have a fearful headache! Get down, until the smoke rises!"  The tunnel contractors 

and their men understood the danger, for they had handled explosives before. It is a well-known 

fact that the fumes of dynamite and other giant powders will often produce severe headaches, and 

even illness. Tom's explosive contained a certain percentage of dynamite, and he knew its ill 

effects. Stretched prone, or crouching on the ground, there was little danger, as the fumes, being 

lighter than air, rose. The yellow haze soon drifted away, and it was safe to rise.  "Well, I wonder 

how much rock your explosive tore loose for us, Tom," observed Job Titus, as he looked at the 

thin, yellowish cloud of smoke that was still lazily drifting from the tunnel.  "Can't tell until we go in 

and take a look," replied the young inventor. "It won't be safe to go in for a while yet, though. That 

smoke will hang in there a long time. I didn't think there'd be a back draft."  "There is, for we've 

often had the same trouble with our shots," Walter Titus said. "I can't account for it unless there is 

some opening in the shaft, connecting with the outer air, which admits a wind that drives the 

smoke out of the mouth, instead of forward into the blast hole. It's a queer thing and we haven't 

been able to get at the bottom of it."  "That's right," agreed his brother. "We've looked for some 

opening, or natural shaft, but haven't been able to find it.  Sometimes we shoot off a charge and 

everything goes well, the smoke disappears in a few minutes. Again it will all blow out this way and 

we lose half a day waiting for the air to clear. There's a hidden shaft, or natural chimney, I'm sure, 

but we can't find it."  "Thot blast didn't make much racket," commented Tim Sullivan. "I doubt thot 

much rock come down. An' thot's not sayin' anythin' ag'in yer powder, lad," he went on to Tom. 

"Oh, that's all right," Tom Swift replied, with a laugh.  "My explosive doesn't work by sound. It has 

lots of power, but it doesn't produce much concussion."  "We've often made more noise with our 

blasts," confirmed Job Titus, "but I can't say much for our results."  They were all anxious, Tom 

included, to hurry into the tunnel to see how much rock had been loosened by the blast, but it was 

not safe to venture in until the fumes had been allowed to disperse. In about an hour, however, 

Tim Sullivan, venturing part way in, sniffed the air and called:  "It's all right, byes! Air's clear. Now 

come on!"  They all hurried eagerly into the shaft, Mr. Damon stumbling along at Tom's side, as 

anxious as the lad himself. Before they reached the face of the cliff against which the bore had 

been driven, and which was as a solid wall then at Placentia, in Newfoundland, bent on finding 

other fields for his energy and martial prowess.  No other man was so well equipped at all points, 

in knowledge of the great bay and of the conditions of fighting there, as this hero, so the four 

captains found him out at Placentia, and, embarking in the _Pelican_, he took command. 

Iberville's flag-ship mounted fifty guns.  The others of the fleet were the _Palmier_, the _Weesph_, 

and the _Violent_.  The attack on Fort Nelson this time was to be no child's play.  Almost at the 

very moment when the wind was filling the sails of the French ships in the Channel, there sailed 

from Plymouth a fleet belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, the _Hampshire_, the _Hudson's 

Bay_, the _Dering_, and _Owner's Love_.  The two first-named vessels were no strangers to the 

Bay, and had participated in the conquest of the previous year. Although each was ignorant of the 

other's movements, it was a race across the Atlantic, and the English fleet entered the Straits only 

forty hours before the ships of the French, and, like them, was much impeded by the ice, which 



was unusually troublesome.  Passage was made by the enemy in the English wake.  One French 

ship, commanded by Duqu, pushed past the currents, taking a northerly {145} course, which 

brought her commander into full view of two of the Company's ships.  Shots were exchanged; but 

owing to the difficulties engendered by the ice, it was impossible to manoeuvre with such certainty 

as to cut off the Frenchman's escape.  While this skirmish was in progress, Iberville in the 

_Pelican_ succeeded in getting past the English unknown to them, and reached the mouth of the 

Nelson River in sight of the fort.  His presence, as may be imagined, greatly surprised and 

disturbed the Governor and the Company's servants; for they had believed their own ships would 

have arrived in season to prevent the enemy from entering the Straits.  Several rounds of shot 

were fired as a signal, in the hope that a response would be made by the Company's ships, which 

they hourly expected in that quarter.  On his part the French commander was equally disturbed by 

the non-arrival of his three consorts, which the exigencies of the voyage had obliged him to 

forsake.  Two days were passed in a state of suspense.  At daybreak on the 5th of September 

three ships[1] were distinctly visible; both parties joyfully believed they were their own.  So certain 

was Iberville, that he immediately raised anchor and started to join the newcomers.  He was soon 

undeceived, but the knowledge of his mistake in no way daunted him.  The Company's 

commanders were not prepared {146} either for the daring or the fury of the Frenchman's 

onslaught.  It is true the _Pelican_ was much superior to any of their own craft singly, being 

manned by nearly 250 men, and boasting 44 pieces of cannon.  The Company's ships lined up, 

the _Hampshire_ in front, the _Dering_ next, with the _Hudson's Bay_ bringing up the rear.  The

fragments of stone.  "Well, it blew some as far back as here," said Walter Titus. "That's a good 

sign."  "I hope so," Tom remarked.  There were still some fumes noticeable in the tunnel, and Mr. 

Damon complained of a slight feeling of illness, while Koku, who kept at Tom's side, murmured 

that it made his eyes smart. But the sensations soon passed.  They came to a stop as the face of 

the cliff loomed into view in the glare of a searchlight which Job Titus switched on. Then a murmur 

of wonder came from every one, save from Tom Swift. He, modestly, kept silent.  "Bless my 

breakfast orange!" cried Mr. Damon. "What a big hole!"  There was a great gash blown in the hard 

rock which had acted as a bar to the further progress of the tunnel. A great heap of rock, broken 

into small fragments, was on the floor of the shaft, and there was a big hole filled with debris which 

would have to be removed before the extent of the blast could be seen.  "That's doing the work!" 

cried Job Titus.  "It beats any two blasts we ever set off," declared his brother.  "Much fine!" 

muttered the Peruvian foreman, Serato.  "It's a lalapaloosa, lad!  Thot's what it is!" enthusiastically 

exclaimed Tim Sullivan. "Now the black beggars will have some rock to shovel! Come on there, 

Serato, git yer lazy imps t' work cartin' this stuff away.  We've got a man on th' job now in this new 

powder of half-past nine in the morning.  The French commander came straight for the 

_Hampshire_, whose captain, believing it was his enemy's design to board, instantly let fall his 

mainsail and set his fore-top-sail.  Contact having been by these means narrowly evaded, the 

scene of battle suddenly shifted to the _Pelican_ and the _Dering_, whose mainsail was smitten 

by the terrific volley.  At the same time the _Hudson's Bay_, veering, received a damaging 

broadside. The Company's men could distinctly hear the orders shouted by Iberville to discharge a 

musket fire into the _Dering's_ forecastle, but in this move he was anticipated by the English 

sailors, who poured a storm of bullets in upon the Frenchman, accompanied by a broadside of 

grape, which wrought havoc with her sails.  While the cries of the wounded on the _Pelican_ could 

be distinctly heard, all three of the Company's ships opened fire, with the design of disabling her 

rigging.  But the captain of the _Hudson's Bay_, seeing that he could not engage the _Pelican_ 

owing to Iberville's tactics, determined to run in front of her and give her the benefit of a constant 

hull fire, besides taking the wind from her sails. Iberville observed the movement; the two {147} 

English vessels were near; he veered round, and by a superb piece of seamanship came so near 

to the _Hampshire_ that the crew of the latter saw that 


_
Swift's. Git busy!"  "Um!" grunted the Indian, and he called to his men who were soon busy with 

picks and shovels, loading the loosened rock and earth into the mule-hauled dump cars which 

took it to the mouth of the tunnel, whence it was shunted off on another small railroad to fill in a big 

gulch to save bridging it.  Tom's first blast was very successful, and enough rock was loosed to 

keep the laborers busy for a week. was intended.  Every man flew out on the main deck with his 

pistol and cutlass, and a terrific broadside of grape on the part of the Englishman alone saved him. 

Hotter and fiercer raged the battle.  The _Hampshire's_ salvation had been only temporary; at the 

end of three hours and a half she began to sink, with all sails set.  When this occurred, Iberville 

had ninety men wounded, forty being struck by a single broadside.
