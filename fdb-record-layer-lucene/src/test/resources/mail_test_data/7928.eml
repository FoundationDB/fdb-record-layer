 he's not going to resign=20

the place, surely?" cried Franks.  "He'll have to give it up; he could not =
for shame stand up just=20

below the reading-desk, give out the psalms, and lead the singing, as if no=
thing had happened,"=20

observed Ben Stone, with a shake of his head.  "Why, Sands is the most quie=
t, steady, sober--"=20

"But his wife, she's the mischief, she's the ruin of him; a man is what a w=
oman makes him," quoth=20

the jovial carpenter, giving a self-complacent nod towards his own partner.=
 "Parsons, we're told,=20

must have their own houses in subjection, and I guess the same rule holds w=
ith their clerks. All=20

Colme is talking about it. We'll have you, our one-armed sailor, clerk as w=
ell as school-master;=20

there's no one so fit for the place!"     VII.  Brightness and Gloom.   "So=
 there's a chance of my=20

being made clerk as well as school-master of Colme," said Ned Franks to him=
self, as he walked=20

towards his home. "Such a breeze of good fortune is more than I ever could =
have hoped for. Why,=20

there would be twenty-six pounds a year, besides what I have now, and no tr=
ifle in the way of fees!=20

Now that I am a family man, I shall find plenty to do with the money. I sha=
ll be able to fulfil my=20

heart's desire, to give my boy, when he's old enough to learn, a first-rate=
 education. Little Ned=20

shall have every advantage, bless him! There's no saying what he may turn o=
ut in time,--may be a=20

parson, maybe a bishop, one of these thing up from the table where she had =
thrown it, and=20

examined it carefully for the first time.  It had not been originally inten=
ded as a jewel-case, that was=20

clear; and as Maxine's voice had rung unmistakably true when she denied all=
 previous knowledge=20

of it to the police, I judged that the diamonds had not been in it when the=
 Duchess entrusted them=20

to du Laurier. He would almost certainly have described to Maxine the box o=
r case which had=20

been stolen from him, and if the thing pulled out from the sofa-hiding-plac=
e had recalled his=20

description, she must have betrayed some emotion under the keen eyes of the=
 Commissary of=20

Police.  The case which, it seemed, I had brought to Paris, looked as if it=
 might have been made to=20

hold a peculiar kind of cigar, much longer than the ordinary sort. Within, =
on either side, was a=20

partition, and there was a silver clasp on which the hallmark was English. =
 "English silver!" I said to=20

myself, thoughtfully. The three men who had travelled in the carriage with =
me from London to=20

Dover were all English. Of the trio, only the nervous little fellow who had=
 reserved the=20

compartment for himself had found the smallest possible opportunity to stea=
l the treaty from me,=20

and exchange for it this red leather case containing a diamond necklace wor=
th twenty thousand=20

pounds. If he possessed the skill and quick deftness of a conjurer or a mar=
vellously clever=20

professional pickpocket, as well as the incentive of a paid spy, he might c=

walked on with brisker step at the thought. "Then I'll be able to insure my=
 life, so that if anything=20

should happen to me, my Persis shouldn't be cast adrift on the waves, or ha=
ve to pull the oar=20

herself in a heavy sea! And we'll have something to give to others. I think=
 that I'll devote the fees=20

for the first year, at least, to the repair of the old almshouses in Wild R=
ose Hollow. Persis will=20

approve of that, I am sure. Grand news I have to carry home to wifie to-day=
! When I was nothing=20

but a poor Jack-tar, and then lost my arm by an awkward accident, and thoug=
ht that the storm of=20

misfortune was throwing me back on my native shore like a battered wreck th=
at never would float=20

boat's gangway, not afterwards; for when he had pressed near me in the Gare=
 du Nord he had=20

been on the wrong side. But for my life I could not guess the motive for su=
ch an exchange.=20

Supposing him a spy, employed to track and rob me of what I carried, why sh=
ould he have made=20

me a present of these rare and precious diamonds? Would the bribe for which=
 he used his skill=20

reach anything like the sum he could obtain by selling the stones? I was al=
most sure it would not;=20

and therefore, having the diamonds, it would have been far more to his adva=
ntage to keep them=20

than to stuff them into my pocket, simply to fill up the space where the ca=
se with the treaty had=20

lain. There would not have=20


_
how little I dreamed what a prosperous gale that storm was for me! Here am =
I, as far from being a=20

wreck as ever I was in my life (barring that instead of my left arm I've ti=
mber and a hook, which=20

serve my purpose quite well), scudding along, buoyant as a cork, with the b=
est of wives and the=20

sweetest of babes and the happiest of homes, with teaching work, which is j=
ust to my liking, and=20

now with the prospect in addition of being appointed Clerk of Colme, in the=
 place of John Sands!"=20

But the last words, like a touch to a sleeper, broke the charm of Ned Frank=
s's pleasant=20

Amsterdam, therefore it would be useless to build up a theory that the ston=
es given me might be=20

false.  Besides, I reminded myself, if the man were a spy whose business wa=
s to watch and be=20

near me, why hadn't he waited to see what I would do, where I would go, ins=
tead of taking a=20

compartment, carefully reserving it, and trusting to such an unlikely chanc=
e as that I might force=20

myself into it with him? Even if the three men had been in some obscure way=
 playing into each=20

others' hands, I could not see how their game had been arranged to catch me=
.  Maxine and I had=20

talked=20
