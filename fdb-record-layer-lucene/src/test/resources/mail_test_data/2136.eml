CHAPTER I  A LIVELY TIME   "I don't think we'd better go home that way, Hel=
en."  "Why not? Mr.=20

Bassett won't care--and it's the nearest way to the road."  "But he's got a=
 sign up--and his cattle=20

run in this pasture," said Ruth Fielding, who, with her chum, Helen Cameron=
, and Helen's twin=20

brother, Tom, had been skating on the Lumano River, where the ice was smoot=
h below the mouth=20

of the creek which emptied into the larger stream near the Red Mill.  "Aw, =
come on, Ruthie!" cried=20

Tom, stamping his feet to restore circulation.  The ground was hard and the=
 ice was thick on the=20

river; but the early snows that had fallen were gone. It was the day after =
Christmas, and Helen and=20

Ruth had been at home from school at Briarwood Hall less than a week. Tom, =
too, who attended=20

the Military Academy at Seven Oaks, was home for the winter holidays. It wa=
s snapping cold=20

weather, but the sun had been bright this day and for three hours or more t=
he friends had enjoyed=20



themselves on the ice.  "Surely Hiram Bassett hasn't turned his cows out in=
 this weather," laughed=20

Helen.  "But maybe he has turned out his bull," said Ruth. "You know how ug=
ly that creature is.=20

And there's the sign."  "I declare! you do beat Peter!" ejaculated Tom, shr=
ugging his shoulders.=20

"We are only going to cut across Bassett's field--it won't take ten minutes=
. And it will save us half=20

an hour in getting to the mill. We can't go along shore, for the ice is ope=
n there at the creek."  "All=20

right," agreed Ruth Fielding, doubtfully. She was younger than the twins an=
d through his mind.  "I=20

must be careful what I say. I am not speaking as a lawyer," he said, with a=
n uncomfortable smile.=20

"What I meant was, that nothing could be proved which was untrue."  The age=
nt shook his head.=20

"When it's circumstantial evidence, you can never build upon that," he said=
. "No man saw it, you=20

may say; but if all the facts point that way, it goes far with a jury. Ther=
e are some other things you=20

will perhaps tell me. Had you any quarrel ever with poor Tinto? Was there i=
ll blood between you?=20

Can any man give evidence, for example, 'I heard the panel say that he woul=
d have it out with Pat=20

Torrance'? or----"  "For heaven's sake, what is the panel? and what connect=
ion is there between=20

poor Torrance and----"  "Sir," said Mr Monypenny, sternly, "this is no time=
 for jests; the panel is a=20

Scotch law term, meaning the defender; or what you call the defendant in En=
gland. It's a terrible=20

loss to a young man to be unacquainted even with the phraseology of his own=
 country."  "That is=20

very true," John said, with a laugh; "but at least it is no fault of mine. =
Well, suppose I am the panel,=20

as you say--that does not make me a vulgar brawler, does it, likely to disp=
lay hostile intentions in=20

that way? You may be sure no man can say of me that I threatened to have it=
 out with Pat=20

Torrance----"  "It was inadvertent--it was inadvertent," said Mr Monypenny,=
 waving his hand, with a=20

slight flush of confusion; "I daresay you never said Pat--but what has that=
 to do with it?--you know=20

my meaning. Is there any one that can be produced to say----"  "I have quar=
relled with Torrance=20

almost as often as I have met him," said John, with obstinate decision. "I =
thought him a bully and a=20

cad. If I did not tell him so, it was out of regard for his wife, and he wa=
s at liberty to find out my=20

sentiments from my looks if it pleased him. I have never made the least pre=
tence of liking the=20

man."  Mr Monypenny went on shaking his head. "All this is bad," he said, "=
bad!--but it does not=20

make a quarrel in the eye of the law," he added, more cheerfully; and he we=
nt on putting a variety=20

of questions, of which John grew very weary. Some of these questions seemed=
 to have very little=20

bearing upon the subject; some irritated him as betraying beyond all a pers=
istent doubt of his own=20

story. Altogether, the first dreary afternoon in confinement was not made m=
uch more endurable by=20

this visit. The room in which John had been placed was like the parlour of =
a somewhat shabby=20

lodging-house--not worse than he had inhabited many a time while travelling=
. But the idea that he=20

could not step outside, but was bound to this enclosure, was first ludicrou=
s, and then intolerable.=20

The window was rather higher than usual, and there were bars across it. Whe=
n it became dark, a=20

paraffin-lamp, such as is now universal in the country--smelling horribly, =
as is, alas! too universal=20

also--was brought in, giving abundance of light, but making everything more=
 squalid than before.=20

And as Mr Monypenny made his notes, John's heart sank, and his impatience r=
ose. He got up and=20

began to pace about like a wild beast in a cage, as he said to himself. The=
 sensation was more=20

extraordinary than can be imagined. Not to be able, whatever might happen, =
to leave this shabby=20

room. Whosoever might call to you, whatsoever might appeal to you, to be fi=
xed there, all your=20

impulses checked, impotent, unable for the first time in your life to do wh=
at you had done every=20

day of your life, to move out and in, to and fro as you pleased! John felt =
that if he had been a=20



theatrical felon in a play, manacled and fettered, it would have been easie=
r, more comprehensible.=20

But to know that these four walls were his absolute boundaries, and that he=
 could not go beyond=20

them, was more astounding than any other sensation that had ever happened t=
o him in his life.=20

And when Mr Monypenny, with his careful brow, weighted with doubts and fear=
s, unable to clear=20

his countenance from the disapprobation that clouded it, got up to take his=
 leave, and stood=20

holding his client's hands, overwhelmed with sympathy, vexation, dissatisfa=
ction, and pity, the=20

impatience and bitter sense of the intolerable in John's mind could scarcel=
y be restrained.=20

"Whatever there may be more to say, whatever may come to your mind, you hav=
e but to send me=20

a word, and I'll be at your call night or day," Mr Monypenny said.=20


_
time; but admiring Helen so much, she often gave up her own inclinations, o=
r was won by the elder=20

girl from a course which she thought wise. There had been times during thei=
r first term at=20

Briarwood Hall, now just completed, when Ruth had been obliged to take a di=
fferent course from=20

her chum. This occasion, however, seemed of little moment. Hiram Bassett ow=
ned a huge red=20

herd-leader that was the terror of the countryside; but it was a fact, as H=
elen said, that the cattle=20

were not likely to be roaming the pasture at this time of year.  "Come on!"=
 said Tom, again. "The=20

"It is very unlikely that I should have anything more to say," said John; "=
but must I stay here?" It=20

seemed incredible to him that he should be left even by his own "man of bus=
iness." He had seen=20

Beaufort go away with a sort of contemptuous certainty of speedy liberation=
; but Mr Monypenny=20

had said nothing about liberation. "Surely there is nothing to prevent bail=
 being accepted?" he=20

said, with an eagerness he could not disguise.  "I will see about it," Mr M=
onypenny said. But the=20

good agent went away with a dissatisfied countenance; and with a feeling th=
at he must=20


_
station for father and stop at the mill for us on its return. We don't want=
 to keep him waiting."  "And=20

we've got so much to do to-night, Ruthie!" cried Helen. "Have you got your =
things packed?"  "Aunt=20

Alvirah said she would look my clothes over," said Ruth, in reply. "I don't=
 really see as I've much to=20

take, Helen. We only want warm things up there in the woods."  "And plenty =
of 'em," advised Tom.=20

"Bring your skates. We may get a chance to use them if the snow isn't too h=
eavy. But up there in=20

the backwoods the snow hasn't melted, you can bet, since the first fall in =
November."  "We'll have=20

just the loveliest time!" went on Helen, with her usual enthusiasm. "Tom an=
d I spent a week-end at=20

Snow Camp when Mr. Parrish owned it, and when we knew he was going to sell,=
 we just=20

_begged_ papa to buy it. You never saw such a lovely old log cabin--"  "I n=
ever saw a log cabin at=20

all," responded Ruth, laughing.  They had climbed the steep bank now and st=
arted across the=20

pasture in what Tom called "a catter-cornering" direction, meaning to come =
out upon the main=20

road to Osago Lake within sight of the Red Mill, which was the property of =
Mr. Jabez Potter, Ruth's=20

uncle.  Ruth Fielding, after her parents died, had come from Darrowtown to =
live with her mother's=20

uncle at the Red Mill, as was told in the first volume of this series, enti=
tled "Ruth Fielding of the=20

Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret." The girl had found Uncle Jabez very =
hard to get along with=20

at first, for he was a good deal of a miser, and his finer feelings seemed =
to have been neglected=20

during a long life of hoarding and selfishness.  But through a happy turn o=
f circumstances Ruth=20

was enabled to get at the heart of her through the walls or the barred wind=
ow, must make his=20

escape somehow--could not, would not, endure this extraordinary intolerable=
 new thing--John=20

Erskine heard the key turn in his door, and was left shut up with the paraf=
fin-lamp, flaming and=20

smelling more than ever, a prisoner and alone. Whether it was more ludicrou=
s or more terrible, this=20

annoying impossible farce-tragedy, it was hard to say.     CHAPTER XXXVI.  =
 The day after John's=20

incarceration was the funeral day at Tinto. The whole country was moved by =
this great ceremonial.=20

The funeral was to be more magnificent than ever funeral had been before fo=
r hundreds of miles=20

around; and the number of the procession which followed the remains was gre=
ater than that of any=20

assembly known in the country since the '45, when the whole district on one=
 side or the other was=20

"out." That everybody concerned should have found it impossible to think of=
 John in the county jail,=20

in face of the necessity of "showing respect" on this great occasion to the=
 memory of Torrance,=20

was natural. It was, indeed, out of the question to make any comparison bet=
ween the two=20

necessities. After all, what did it matter for one day? Those who were out =
of prison, and had never=20

been in prison, and whose imagination was not affected like John's by that =
atmosphere of=20

restraint, did not see any great harm that could happen. And the ceremony w=
as one which could=20

not be neglected. A Scotch funeral is somewhat terrible to those who have b=
een accustomed to=20

the pathetic and solemn ritual of the English Church; but there was somethi=
ng, too, impressive to=20

the imagination, in that silent putting away of the old garment of humanity=
,--a stern submission, an=20

acceptance=20


_
Helen Cameron, planned to go away to school, Uncle Jabez was won over to th=
e idea of sending=20

Ruth with her. The girls were now home for the winter holidays after spendi=
ng their first term at=20

Briarwood Hall, where they had made many friends as well as learning a good=
 many practical and=20

necessary things. The fun and work of this first term is all related in "Ru=
th Fielding at Briarwood=20

Hall; Or, Solving the Campus Mystery," which is the second volume of the Ru=
th Fielding Series.=20

And now another frolic was in immediate prospect. Mr. Cameron, who was a ve=
ry wealthy dry-

goods merchant, had purchased a winter camp deep in the wilderness, up at l=
east shed a=20

wonderful awe on that conclusion no longer to be disturbed by mortal prayer=
s or hopes. But Dr=20

Stirling, the parish minister, was of the new school of the Scotch Church, =
and poor Torrance's=20

body became, as it were, the flag of a religious party as it was laid in th=
e grave. The great dining-

room at Tinto, the largest room in the county, was crowded with a silent as=
sembly gathered round=20

the coffin while the first portion of the ceremony was carried out. It was =
such a scene as would=20

have filled the heart of the dead man with exultation. Not one of the poten=
tates of the county was=20

absent; and behind them, in close ranks,=20


_
itself now being over, Helen and Tom had obtained his permission to take a =
party of their friends=20

with them to the lodge in the backwoods --Snow Camp.  It was really Helen's=
 party. Besides Ruth,=20

she had invited Madge Steele, Jennie Stone, Belle Tingley, and Lluella Fair=
fax to be of the party.=20

She had invited one other girl from Briarwood, too; but Mary Cox had refuse=
d the invitation. "The=20

Fox," as her school-fellows called her, had been under a cloud at the end o=
f the term, and perhaps=20

she might have felt somewhat abashed had she joined the party of her school=
-fellows at Snow=20

Camp.  Tom had invited his chum at school, who was Madge Steele's brother B=
ob, and another=20

boy named Isadore Phelps. With Mr. Cameron himself and smaller notabilities=
--bonnet lairds,=20

village doctors, clergymen, schoolmasters, lost in the sea of the tenantry =
behind. At the upper end=20

of the room, a very unusual group, stood the ladies. Lady Caroline in her w=
idow's weeds, covered=20

with crape from head to foot, her tall willowy figure drooping under the we=
ight of those long=20

clinging funeral robes, her face perfectly pale and more abstract and high-=
bred than ever,=20

encircled by the whiteness of the cap--with her two little children standin=
g by, and her mother and=20

sister behind to support her--thrilled many an honest heart in the assembly=
. Women so seldom=20

take part in funeral ceremonies in Scotland, that the farmers and country-f=
olk were touched=20

beyond measure by this=20


_
they were small, and several servants, the party were to take train at Ches=
low the next day for the=20

northern wilderness.  The trio of friends, as they hurried across Hiram Bas=
sett's pasture, were full=20

of happy anticipations regarding the proposed trip, and they chatted merril=
y as they went on.=20

Halfway across the field they passed along the edge of a bush-bordered holl=
ow. described in=20

scores of sympathetic houses for long after: "A snowdrift could not be whit=
er than the face of her;=20

and the twa little bairns, puir things, glowering frae them, the image of p=
oor Tinto himsel'." If there=20

was any sceptic ready to suggest "that my leddy was never so happy a wife t=
o be sic a mournin'=20

widow," the spectators had a ready answer: "Eh, but she would be=20
