benefit to the Indians and the government.    Of the royal court  [Our writ=
er notes the requirement=20

of the laws of the Indias that the governors and audiencias should consult =
and act together in=20

matters of government, and the excellent results of this procedure. [146]] =
But unfortunately such=20

has not been the case in the recent governments of Filipinas. The governor-=
presidents have=20

entirely separated themselves from their audiencias, and have governed alon=
e--sometimes in=20

military fashion, not heeding the opinions and customs of the country, but =
depending on force of=20

arms; and sometimes only by the advice of the lawyer who assists the govern=
or, who has the title=20

of government counselor [asesor], and who, although he ought to limit himse=
lf to giving opinion on=20

points and cases regarding statutes, is counselor in all the arduous matter=
s of administration.=20

From this it has resulted that the fate of the colonies may be left in the =
hands of this class of=20

counselors, and that their subordinates have had so much power and importan=
ce. [Moreover, this=20

course leads to dissensions and hostilities between the governor and the Au=
diencia, which is a=20

bad example to furnish to the people and lowers their respect for the autho=
rities.] It must be borne=20

in mind that the Indians of Filipinas are not so sunken in ignorance that t=
hey do not of themselves,=20

and likewise through their attorneys and confessors, recognize that they ha=
ve a sovereign who=20

rules them, and who to this end has given them laws; consequently, all lack=
 of concord among the=20

authorities, and every change introduced in the method of governing the vil=
lages, must produce=20

fatal consequences. [It is therefore recommended that the governor consult =
the Audiencia in all=20

matters of the internal government of the islands, and any failure in this =
should be made a charge=20

in his residencia.]    Of the administration of justice in general  The con=
sideration and respect=20

which the Audiencia of Manila merits among the Indians proceeds also from t=
hose times in which=20

its members made official visits to the provinces, and in these visits did =
so much good to the=20

villages. The visiting auditors were, in reality, friendly mediators in the=
 disputes between the=20

Indians; and they made agreements, placed limits to the villages, furnished=
 a suggestive of=20

Hotspur=E2=80=99s reply to Glendower. The fiery Welshman, endeavoring to pr=
ove that he, too, is some=20

great one, asserts that at his nativity      =E2=80=9CThe front of heaven w=
as full of fiery shapes,      Of=20

burning cressets: and at my birth,      The frame and huge foundations of t=
he earth      Shaked like=20

a coward.=E2=80=9D  To which Hotspur answers:      =E2=80=9CWhy, so it woul=
d have done,      At the same season if=20

your mother=E2=80=99s cat      Had kittened, and yourself had ne=E2=80=99er=
 been born!=E2=80=9D  So much for popular=20

beliefs. Quite generally there are subterranean rumblings, or slight tremor=
s preceding the more=20

violent shock; but even these are not sure signs, as they may occur alone, =
or the earthquake may=20

come unannounced. A notable case of the former sort is the remarkable subte=
rranean roaring=20

heard at Guanaxuato, in Mexico, in 1784. It lies in a rich mining district,=
 with no volcano in the=20

vicinity. On January 9 there broke out, after some preliminary muttering, a=
 great uproar which=20

seemed as if a thunder storm were going on beneath the surface of the earth=
. A short distance=20

from the town it could not be heard; and not the slightest tremor of the so=
il was perceptible, even=20

in mines sixteen hundred feet deep. But so great was the panic it created, =
that thousands fled from=20

the town, leaving it entirely to the mercy of thieves and bandits. The alca=
ldes, with true Spanish=20

grandiloquence, asserted that the government would =E2=80=9Cbe able in its =
wisdom to say when danger is=20

imminent, and to take measures for enabling the people to fly for refuge;=
=E2=80=9D and it determined to=20



impose a penalty of one thousand piasters on the rich, or of two months imp=
risonment on the poor=20

who fled ere the word was given. But though it was easy to make laws, it wa=
s not so easy to feed=20

the people; for the affrighted peasantry would not set foot in the city; so=
 the month of uproar=20

became one of famine as well.  [Illustration: HOUSES THROWN INTO A RAVINE B=
Y AN=20

EARTHQUAKE.]  A similar rumbling occurred in Melada, an island off the coas=
t of Dalmatia, in=20

1822, and the frightened inhabitants besought the Austrian government to tr=
ansport them to a=20

place of safety; but though the explosions continued during two years, some=
times more than one=20

hundred in a single night, nothing ever resulted therefrom.  So with regard=
 to all popular beliefs on=20

 warn us of the=20

approach of the earthquakes, neither in the heavens above, nor the earth=20

oppressions of the alcaldes-mayor. Notwithstanding my high opinion of that =
tribunal, I regard as=20

very proper the provisions of law xxxiv, ttulo ii, book ii of the laws of t=
he Indias in regard to the=20

removal and promotion of its ministers, basing my opinion on the same argum=
ents as did the law--

that is, that it is very desirable not only to reward them, but to uproot t=
hem from the friendships=20

which they contract in places where they remain a long time. These friendsh=
ips, whose influence=20

is always detrimental to the equitable administration of justice, are in Ma=
nila an almost necessary=20

result of the small Spanish population, of the lack of all public amusement=
 or diversion, and of the=20

fact that with the enervating effect of the climate the rectitude and vigor=
 of European morals is lost=20

after some years of residence in the country. [The Audiencia has been unabl=
e to attend to the nor=20

the waters under the earth.  Has the reader ever experienced one of these s=
trange earthstorms?=20

Perhaps not. Is it believed they are rare? They are as common as storms in =
the atmosphere.=20

Within a period of seven years, four thousand six hundred and twenty have b=
een recorded. Many=20

more, doubtless, occurred completely beyond the pale of civilization. Hundr=
eds have passed=20

unnoticed save by delicate instruments. Not a day passes without several be=
ing recorded. They=20

are as widely various in power as the storm and the breeze. Not a region on=
 earth is unvisited by=20

them.  Yet the reader will be disposed to think that the United States is a=
lmost free from these=20

visitants. To a certain extent it is; we have not in all our history, had a=
 shock of extreme violence,=20

or one that can compare in destructiveness with the strange convulsions of =
tropical regions: but in=20

the rarity of shocks we are=20


_
always been hindered by the many obstacles which arise from the storms, the=
 lack of roads and=20

mail service, the attraction of all the lawyers in the islands to the capit=
al, the ignorance of the=20

gobernadorcillo and the alcalde of each other's language and of judicial pr=
ocedures, the dilatory=20

mode of carrying on these between the provinces and Manila, etc. "Thus it i=
s very common that=20

supposed. A few moments consideration of the records will be sufficiently c=
onvincing.  In the=20

memoirs of the =E2=80=9CAcademy of the Arts and Sciences=E2=80=9D in Boston=
, is a paper read in 1783 by Prof.=20

Williams, recounting the story of some of the earlier earthquakes in our hi=
story.  The first one=20

noticed after the landing of the Pilgrims occurred June 1, 1638. We are tol=
d it was preceded by a=20


_
full of defects, last three, four, or six years; and that in that long peri=
od either the delinquents take=20

to flight, or the documents are lost." Even in the Audiencia itself there a=
re many obstacles to its=20

action. Its subordinate officials are Indian or mestizo lawyers, who often =
are neither competent nor=20

qualified for their thunder, which gradually grew louder and nearer. Then t=
he earth began to quake=20

till pewter and crockery tumbled from the shelves, stone walls  [Illustrati=

passed from northwest to southeast, and was followed by a second in half an=
