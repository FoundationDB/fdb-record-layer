MORERI.  Footnote 51:    John, king of Arragon, was killed in 1395 by a fal=

hunting. By Matthea of Armagnac, his queen, he had two   daughters, of whom=
 the eldest was=20

married to Matthew viscount de   Chateaubon and count of Foix, who claimed =
the crown in right of=20

his   wife, and invaded Arragon in support of his pretensions. But the   pr=
incipal nobility having, in=20

the mean time, called over Martin king   of Sicily, brother of John, to be =
his successor, a bloody=20

war ensued,   which terminated only with the death of the count de Foix. Af=
