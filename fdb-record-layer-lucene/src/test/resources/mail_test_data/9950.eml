_imprimatur_ of so fastidious a judge as his Royal Highness. Just his luck =
to be adored by his=20

young wife, and looked upon by her as a king of men; to be clothed in purpl=
e and fine raiment, with=20

the possibility of a peerage and the possession of immense wealth in the fu=
ture. But he was quite=20

right in carping at her, for fortune, like other fickle jades, is more like=
ly to be true if steadily abused.=20

The two girls, his wife and her cousin, interrupted his soliloquy. The gaie=
ties of the season had, if=20

possible, rendered Georgie's beauty still more perfect. A succession of _re=

entertainments, of concerts, balls and routs, and their attendant late  Not=
withstanding the decision=20

of Lady Montairy, Lothair was scarcely free from embarrassment when he rejo=
ined the ladies; and=20

was so afraid of standing alone, or talking only to men, that he was almost=
 on the point of finding=20

refuge in his dinner-companions, had not he instinctively felt that this wo=
uld have been a social=20

blunder. But the duchess relieved him: her gracious glance caught his at th=
e right moment, and=20

she rose and met him some way as he advanced. The friends had arrived so la=
te, that Lothair had=20

had only time to make a reverence of ceremony before dinner.  =E2=80=9CIt i=

excitement, had given the young wife that almost indefinable stamp of delic=
ate refinement for=20

which we have no word, which is so seldom seen in England, and which the It=
alians call=20

_morbidezza_.  But there was no _morbidezza_ about Lucy; she, too, had shon=
e, perhaps with a=20

certain amount of reflected lustre; but she had shone, she had dazzled. Whe=
n a very young=20

woman is exceedingly good-looking, no prude, and prepared to go any lengths=
, being at the same=20

time perfectly heartless, she is bound to be a success, and Lucy had been a=
 great success. The=20

made me.=E2=80=9D  The evenings at Brentham were short, but they were sweet=
. It was a musical family,=20

without being fanatical on the subject. There was always music, but it was =
not permitted that the=20

guests should be deprived of other amusements. But music was the basis of t=
he evening=E2=80=99s=20

campaigns. The duke himself sometimes took a second; the four married daugh=
ters warbled=20

sweetly; but the great performer was Lady Corisande. When her=20


_
that duke who was so much missed from the cotillions at the Tuileries of hi=
s imperial mistress, had=20

pronounced Lucy _petillante_. M. Barbiche, his second secretary, the best v=
alseur of the season,=20

had declared that Miss Warrender was the lightest stepper in town. "She mak=
e my heart to beat as=20

it never beat before," said the young diplomatist to his chief; "but she is=
 not distinguished like her=20

cousin, she is a woman. I think her cousin is only a goddess after all. The=
y are cold, these married=20

English. I suppose it is the 'spleen.'"  "You'll get back your roses, old w=
oman, at the Castle," said=20

otherwise, many things were said and done amid accompanying melodies, that =

 piquet or cart with=20

Captain Mildmay, and sometimes retired with a troop to a distant, but still=
 visible, apartment, where=20

they played with billiard-balls games which were not billiards.  The ladies=
 had retired, the duke had=20

taken his glass of seltzer-water, and had disappeared. The gentry lingered =
and looked at each=20

other, as if they were an assembly of poachers gathering for an expedition,=

dressed idiots, while twenty more noodles round me are all saying how very =
charming she is, and=20
