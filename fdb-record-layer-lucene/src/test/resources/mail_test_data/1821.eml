"I'd judge so," agreed his father. "But to prove it may not be easy."  On the following day, the Cubs 

met briefly at the church to compare notes on how they were making their suits of armor.  Mrs. 

Hatfield and Mrs. Holloway both were there to help the boys with the work. Brad was the only one 

who had finished his suit. In a burst of enthusiasm he had gone ahead, making a cardboard horse 

which could be worn over his shoulders.  "We ought to have the best Round Table of any of the 

Dens," Dan declared, his enthusiasm at high pitch.  At that moment Babe uttered a loud wail. In 

the act of painting a coat of arms on a banner, he had upset a can of red paint.  "Dope!" Chips 

scolded the younger boy. "Why don't you watch what you're doing?"  "I'm sorry," Babe mumbled. "I 

accidentally kicked the can with my feet."  "Just look what you've done to the carpet. The church 

will be making us pay for it! The trustees will say the Cubs are just a bunch of careless babies who 

substantial presents in return. We stood there in friendly silence, while the feeble minstrel 

sheltered in Antonia's hair went on with its scratchy chirp. The old man's smile, as he listened, was 

so full of sadness, of pity for things, that I never afterward forgot it. As the sun sank there came a 

sudden coolness and the strong smell of earth and drying grass. Antonia and her father went off 

hand in hand, and I buttoned up my jacket and raced my shadow home.     VII   MUCH as I liked 

Antonia, I hated a superior tone that she sometimes took with me. She was four years older than I, 

to be sure, and had seen more of the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her 

protecting manner. Before the autumn was over she began to treat me more like an equal and to 

defer to me in other things than reading lessons. This change came about from an adventure we 

had together.  One day when I rode over to the Shimerdas' I found Antonia starting off on foot for

"I _am not_ a baby," the younger boy said furiously. "It was an accident."  "Of course it was," 

interposed Mrs. Hatfield. "One we're quite prepared for too!"  While the Cubs watched in 

admiration, she wiped up the paint, and cleaned the carpet with turpentine.  "There, every trace is 

gone," she assured the crestfallen Babe. "Chips, a knight should practice chivalry, don't you 

think?"  "What's that?" he demanded suspiciously.  "It means being polite and courteous to 

others."  "Well, Babe was awkward," said Chips angrily.  "So are we all at times, Chips. Speaking 

of a Knight's code of honor, our Den should have one. Any suggestions?"  "We already have one 

rule," Dan recalled. "Be Always offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me. There 

had been another black frost the night before, and the air was clear and heady as wine. Within a 

week all the blooming roads had been despoiled--hundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had 

been transformed into brown, rattling, burry stalks.  We found Russian Peter digging his potatoes. 

We were glad to go in and get warm by his kitchen stove and to see his squashes and Christmas 

melons, heaped in the storeroom for winter. As we rode away with the spade, Antonia suggested 

that we stop at the prairie-dog town and dig into one of the holes. We could find out whether they 

ran straight down, or were horizontal, like mole-holes;
