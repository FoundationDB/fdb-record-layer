belong to the rather higher order of novelist or poet, and there's no use i=
n my being damped any=20

longer by Miss Egerton. I don't mean to be conceited, but I know that I hav=
e got the flutterings of a=20

poet's wings in my soul, and soar I must."  Jasmine looked very pretty whil=
e she was speaking,=20

and little Daisy admired her high-flown words, and fully believed in her ge=
nius.  "Do soar, Jasmine,=20

darling," she said; "I have not a notion how you are to do it, but do begin=
 at once. It will make=20

these rooms more than ever like a Palace Beautiful if you take to soaring i=
n them."  "I've nearly=20

finished my novel," said Jasmine; "and I've also written a poem. It is call=
ed the 'Flight of the=20

Beautiful,' and is in seven parts. Each part would take up two or three pag=
es of a magazine. To-

morrow, Daisy dear, I am going to take my novel and poem into the market. I=
 shall offer them to=20

the highest bidders. I won't send them by post, for I always notice in book=
s that, when gifted=20

authors send their contributions by post, they are declined with thanks, be=
cause they aren't read. I=20

am going to take my own manuscripts to the publishers, Daisy, and I shall p=
ropose to them to read=20

aloud a few extracts."  "You can't be at all shy if you do that, Jasmine," =
said Daisy, looking in a=20

rather awe-struck way at her sister.  "Shy?" echoed Jasmine. "If one feels =
it, one has only to get=20

over it. Is that the way to conquer difficulties, Daisy?--just to be baffle=
d by a little nervous feeling.=20

No, I really want to fill the purse, and I also wish to give the publishers=
 what I am sure they must=20

be always looking for; for I have looked in vain, month after month, in sev=
eral magazines, and=20

nowhere  "Thanks, Clemmie. You've sartinly done me many a good turn, and it=
 would be a wonder=20

if I wa'n't in love with you. You've always been mighty good and kind to me=
. But, there, don't you=20

get excited again, I ain't going to say nothing more about it."  "Tell me a=
bout your trouble, Josiah."=20

The old seaman pulled hard at the ends of his ragged moustache, and his voi=
ce grew husky. "I felt=20

just like I had to tell somebody. I was going to tell Mack last night when =
I see a light in his study,=20

but when I went in I see he had all he could tote, so I just went on up to =
my room without telling=20

him.... You know I've been out of a job for quite a spell."  "It has been l=
ong for you," nodded Miss=20

Pipkin as she drew another chair opposite. "But you've got the church to lo=
ok after."  "That ain't my=20

trade, and it comes hard. I feel all the time like I'd clumb onto the wrong=
 deck. I'd hoped to get a=20

ship afore now. Jim promised me one, and----"  "Do you mean you've been exp=
ecting to get a ship=20

through Jim Fox? Why, Josiah Pott! He'd not give you a splinter to hang on =
if you was drowning.=20

Depending on him! Pooh! I thought you had more sense than that."  "But I ai=
n't. I'm just what I've=20

told you afore, an old fool. I cal'late I know how you feel about Jim. I'd =
always felt that way, too, till=20

he come honeying round me this spring. You called me once an old fool with =
good intentions. I=20

cal'late you ain't far off in your soundings."  "I never said that!" she re=
joined. "Anyhow, I didn't=20

mean it like that."  "You don't need to excuse what you said. It's God's tr=
uth. That's exactly what I=20

be."  "You ain't, neither, and I don't see why you want to talk that way. W=
hat I don't see,=20


_
blank verse. I suppose they can't get it, poor things! but they will in my =
'Flight of the Beautiful!'"=20

"_I_ think blank verse a little dull," said Daisy, softly, and half under h=
er breath; but, when Jasmine=20

frowned, she added hastily, "Of course you're splendidly brave, dear Jasmin=
e; and who'll go with=20

you to the publisher's when you do go?"  "I've been considering that," said=
 Jasmine; "and I think I'll=20

take Poppy. Poppy is to have a whole holiday on Tuesday next, because her q=
uarter's wages are=20

due, and I'll ask her to come with me. She'd enjoy it--Poppy would--and ver=
y likely in the evening=20

I'll be able to tell you and Primrose that I've made my first success. Oh, =
how happy and how proud=20

I shall be!"  A few minutes afterwards Jasmine went out, and Daisy wondered=
 solemnly if her bent=20

in life was to keep on friendly terms with Mr. Dove.  "I'm very glad I took=
 the Prince's advice," she=20

said to herself. "I'm much, much happier since I came to the Palace Beautif=
ul, and I don't think Mr.=20

Dove minds much, for he has never answered my letter. Oh dear! that man to =
give you a ship.=20

There's plenty of others that would be glad to get you."  "I ain't sartin '=
bout that last p'int. You see, I=20

ain't so young no more. I'm getting up in years, and ship-owners ain't hiri=
ng none but young men."=20

"Nonsense! There you go again. As long as you think and talk like Methusela=
h there ain't no owner=20

going to take a chance on you for fear you'd forget the name of the port he=
'd ordered you to. You=20

get that idea out of your head along with the notion that Jim Fox is going =
to help you, and you'll get=20

a ship. The very best there is afloat, too."  "It's mighty kind of you to s=
ay that, Clemmie. I cal'late=20

the notion about Jim is purty well shook out. That's one thing I wanted to =
talk to you about. You=20

know the old place here had been sort of run down for a good many year. I'd=
 always held to the=20

idea that some day I'd come back here after I'd got rich, remodel the home,=
 and get the best=20

woman in all the world to ship side by side with me as best mate. I've told=
 you all that afore, many=20

the time, Clemmie."  Miss Pipkin barely=20


_
Prince explained to me about being a selfish little girl. And, oh dear! the=
re is the Prince!"  Arthur=20

Noel often came to see Daisy. He came in the evenings at an hour when the e=
lder girls were often=20

away, and then Daisy sat on his knee, and chatted to him volubly.  This aft=
ernoon she told him=20

about both her sisters.  "Is having a bent the same as destiny, Mr. Noel?" =
she inquired anxiously.=20

"Jasmine says she has a bent, and she must follow it, and no one can preven=
t her."  "The bent=20

can be guided, Daisy," said Arthur; but he looked puzzled and seemed uncomf=
ortable at the little=20

eyes as she gazed at the tragic face before her.  "Well, I'm back, and it l=
ooks like it was for good=20

and all, but I ain't got no money, and I don't see no way to get any unless=
 I rob somebody. And the=20

law won't let me do that. The trouble is that I'm up to my gunwales in debt=
."  "In debt!" To Miss=20

Pipkin's mind there was no greater calamity in the world than to be in debt=
. She, too, had suffered=20

a like fate many years ago.  "Yes. In bad, too. Jim come up to my house las=
t spring just afore the=20

minister took up his new quarters here, and he says to me: 'Here's some mon=
ey to repair=20
