which is naturally white, had a slight tinge of yellow. The Rev. Mr. Schaef=
fer of _
experience is what makes him wise. He gains this experience by coming in co=
ntact with and=20

observing those things which he meets.  In schools children are taught from=
 the works of men.=20

These works are arts, and since art is but the imitation of nature, all edu=
cation is but imitation of=20

that which the farmer boy has the chance of seeing before it becomes second=
 hand. There is no=20

place that has greater facilities to give observation its full scope than a=
 farm. All farmers can, with=20

the aid of the right kind of books and papers, be reasonably well educated,=
 and most of them have=20

a better comparative knowledge than they think they have. Many of the city =
cousins are=20

superficially educated. City people can talk, but the greater part of the t=
alk of many of them might=20

be more properly called chattering. No farmer need feel below them because =
he is more retired=20

and has a greater amount of modesty.  It is true, perhaps, that one can not=
 seem more=20

insignificant than he really is. Great men are constantly dying, but the li=
ving move on just the=20

same. Each person's position seems valuable to few, and yet there is almost=
 an entire=20

dependence of man to man. Every one can not fill the highest positions, but=
 they should make the=20

best possible use of the faculties that are given them. If this is done the=
re will be no regrets in the=20

future in regard to what might have been done in the past. Life will then b=
e thought worth living=20

and much more happiness will cluster around it than now does.  There is no =
greater lack of=20

education, perhaps, in agriculture than in the other vocations of man, and =
most farmers have a=20

good share of well developed muscle to aid them in their work. The requisit=
es are supplied. How=20

many use them, at least in the way they should be used. All of the work cou=
ld be done, but there is=20

too small a number of good managers to oversee and carry out the performanc=
e of the little jobs=20

that require to be performed at the right time.  There are some people in e=
very business who, in=20

the race for success, far outrun their competitors. This may be noticed on =
a farm. It takes but a=20

short time to tell by the work a man does whether he is a good farmer or no=
t. If a person is a good=20

farmer and unites that quality to that of business management he will be su=
ccessful in his=20

attainments. Through success he will be honored by the members of his profe=
ssion. He will be=20

praised by all other people, and above all he will in the silent thoughts o=
f his own mind have the=20

satisfaction and pleasure of knowing that he is not a cipher in the vast hu=
man family. He will be=20

pointed out as an example to those who are perhaps bowed down by discourage=
ment. He will in=20

all probability be called lucky when his success is really due to decisions=
 that are arrived at by the=20

experience and close observation of the past. If more farmers would be cont=
ent to give their=20

thoughts, as well as time, to farming, there would be more success and happ=
iness in the=20

occupation that depends above all others on good management.      S. LAWREN=

QUINCY, ILL.     SEED CORN FROM SOUTH.   I am an interested reader of THE P=
RAIRIE=20

FARMER, and knowing that thousands of farmers take the advice they get from=
 its pages and act=20

upon it, I wish to say that the suggestions of B. F. J., Champaign, Ill., r=
egarding seed corn from=20

portions It is granular, often white and translucent, and often coloured wi=
th oxyd of iron. It forms=20

_Stone Hill_, (N) a mile southwest of the college, on the vertex of which i=
s argillaceous slate. This=20

hill slopes to West Brook, where quartz often forms perpendicular banks fro=
m 50 to 100 feet high.=20

Here also argillaceous slate rests on the quartz, as well as on the vertex,=
 and on the east side of=20

Stone Hill. Quartz appears again on the opposite side of West Brook, but fu=
rther north, on a hill=20

connected with the Taconick range. On these two hills, it lies in large str=
ata, inclining, like the mica=20

slate, to the east and northeast, often divided by veins into rhomboidal ma=
sses. On the east side=20



of Stone Hill, it is more granular, and may perhaps be called _arenaceous q=
uartz_, containing a=20

larger proportion of iron. Near the base of Hoosack Mountain, similar quart=
z is found, which=20

extends round the north side of the Hoosack to Oak Hill, (D) which is wholl=
y composed of it. It lies=20

in rounded fragments, called _hardheads_, through the northern part of the =
valley, and on the=20

sides of Oak Hill in huge rocks, presenting nearly perpendicular fronts fro=
m 20 to 50 feet in height,=20

and many rods in length. The strata are in some places horizontal, and in o=
thers nearly=20

perpendicular. In one place it forms plates, from 2 to 5 feet on a side, an=
d from half an inch to=20

several inches in thickness, which are nearly perfect rhomboids, the edges =
never being=20

perpendicular to the sides. Most of the quartz, except the white, yields a =
small portion of lime, and=20

has been called _calcareous quartz_. _Greasy quartz_, _rose quartz_, hornst=
one, and _rock=20

crystal_, are occasionally found; the last in considerable quantity south o=
f Stone Hill. On the=20

stream which issues from the _Hopper_, is arenaceous quartz of a slaty stru=
cture, which is an=20

excellent stone for sharpening the _chisels_ used by _stonecutters_.  4. _G=
ranular Limestone_ is=20

abundant at the _Cave_ or _Falls_, in Adams, and on both sides of the Hoosa=
ck. The _Cave_ or=20

_Falls_, (O) is a singular chasm between limestone rocks. A small stream, w=
hich appears once to=20

have run on the surface of the hollow between two small elevations, has now=
 worn a passage=20

many feet in depth through the limestone. The chasm is narrow, winding in i=
ts course several rods=20

long, and its opposite sides were connected, till four years ago, by a natu=
ral bridge of limestone.=20

From the bridge to the water is 70 feet. There is a dark cavern of several =
feet diameter, and some=20

passages into the rocks. The white marble walls, the foaming of the water b=
elow, the piles and=20

irregularity of the rocks, and the thick overhanging trees, make the scene =
very wild and interesting.=20

The limestone rests on mica slate. On the west bank of the Hoosack, and eas=
t base of the hill, (L)=20

the same coarse-grained and white limestone is found, resting on the mica s=
late at the west of it.=20

At the north and west base of Saddle Mountain, (E) and at a less elevation =
than the quartz, are=20

extensive strata of limestone, inclining the same way as the mica slate of =
the mountain. It is less=20

distinctly granular, and less white than the other, but belongs to the same=
 rock. It forms tolerably=20

good marble. Between the strata are crystals of carbonate of lime, rhomboid=
al, and tending to the=20

_lenticular_ form. Some of these=20


_
not do. Last spring hundreds of farmers in Western Iowa planted seed corn t=
hat came from=20

Kansas and Nebraska, and the result was that none of that from Kansas ripen=
ed, while but little of=20

the Nebraska seed did any better. It all grew nicely, but was still green a=
nd growing when the frost=20

came. It may be claimed that much of that grown from native seed was no bet=
ter, but it was better=20

and considerable of it ripened, and from this native seed we have the only =
promise of seed for=20

next year's planting. If farmers expect a good crop of corn they should not=
 get seed from a=20

southern latitude. No Iowa farmer would buy seed corn now that grew in Kent=
ucky, Kansas, or=20

Missouri. The only seed corn on which our farmers rely implicitly is that w=
hich they have gathered=20

before frost came and hung up near the fire to be thoroughly dried before i=
t froze. That corn will=20

grow.      S. L. W.         MANNING, IOWA.     FIELD AND FURROW.   All manu=
res deposited by=20

nature are left on or near the surface. The whole tendency of manure is to =
go down into the soil=20

rather than to rise from it. There is probably very little if any loss of n=
itrogen from evaporation of=20

manure, unless it is put in piles so as to foment. Rains and dews return to=
 the soil as much=20

ammonia in a year as is carried off in the atmosphere.  Rice contains more =
starch than either=20

wheat, rye, barley, oats or corn. Of these grains oats carry the least star=
ch, but by far the largest=20

proportion of cellulose. In nitrogenous substances wheat leads, followed by=
 barley, oats, rye and=20

corn, while rice is most deficient. Corn leads in fat, and oats in relative=
 proportion of water. Wheat=20

leads in gum and rice in salt.  Convenience of farm buildings is an importa=
nt aid to good farming,=20

especially where much stock is kept and there are many chores. Water should=
 always be provided=20

in the barn-yard, the feeding boxes should be near where the feed is kept, =
and the buildings=20

should not be very far removed from the house. If this results in more neat=
ness about barns and=20

barnyards than has been thought necessary, it will be another important adv=
antage gained.  The=20

President of the Elmira Farmers' Club tells the Husbandman that his crop of=
 sorghum got caught=20

by the frost, and too much injured to be of value as a sirup-producing subs=
tance. But he fed it to=20

his cows which ate it greedily, and soon began to gain in milk. He thinks h=
e got about as much=20

profit from the crop as if it had been devoted to the original intent.  Gov=
ernor Glick, in a short=20

address before the State Board of Agriculture, last week, stated that Kansa=
s history is the most=20

remarkable on record; that in 1883 her people had more money to the head th=
an any other people=20

under heaven; that the State had received 60,000 immigrant population in 18=
83; that it will receive=20

160,000 in 1884; that in ten years it will have 2,000,000 people, and that =
thereafter Kansas will not=20

care anything about bureaus of immigration--it will have people enough to w=
ork with, and the rest=20

will come as fast as they are needed.  Farmers' Call: The experiments condu=
cted during the last=20

season at the Missouri State Agricultural College fully demonstrate the adv=
isability of mulching=20

potatoes. We believe every experiment so far reported gave a similar result=
. The cost of the=20

materials for mulching is usually very small, leaves or straw being plentif=
ul and cheap upon the=20

farm. The materials manure the ground; and mulching saves hoeing. The potat=
o requires a cooler=20

climate and moister soil than our latitude affords. Mulching tends to secur=
e both. The result in=20

every case has been largely increased yields of superior quality.  The old =
saying, no grass no=20

cattle, no cattle no manure, no manure no crops, is as true to-day as when =
first spoken. Grass=20

takes care of him who sows it. The meadow is the master mine of wealth. Str=
ong meadows fill big=20

barns. Fat pastures make fat pockets. The acre that will carry a steer carr=
ies wealth. Flush=20

pastures make fat stock. Heavy meadows make happy farmers. Up to my ears in=
 soft grass laughs=20



the fat ox. Sweet pastures make sound butter. Soft hay makes strong wool. T=
hese are composed=20

of blended crystals of this kind. In one place are strata of several rods i=
n length and breadth, which=20

are inclined to the southwest, and thus lie against the mica slate of the m=
ountain. The inclination is=20

about forty-five degrees. Unless this limestone be connected with that on t=
he east of Saddle=20

Mountain, (and no connexion has yet been traced,) it must be considered as =
lying on both sides of=20

the mica slate, or alternating with it.  5. _Argillaceous Slate_ rests on q=
uartz on Stone Hill, and is=20

also found low down in the valley connected with limestone. It constitutes =
the hill (P) connected=20

with the Taconick range, and also Northwest hill, (Q) whose base is compact=
 limestone. A few=20

miles north, this slate is distinctly marked, and in about 12 miles, forms =
hills of _roof slate_ in=20

Hosack, New-York. It is annually carried in large quantities to Albany. On =
the first-mentioned hill, it=20

contains some _talc_.  6. _Aluminous slate._ This is found in argillaceous =
slate, in Pownal, 5 miles=20

north, at the base of a hill east of the Hoosack. It is used to _set_ colou=
rs.  7. _Chlorite._ In=20

rounded masses, generally with quartz, scattered through the valley in Will=
iamstown, and found at=20

an elevation of some hundred feet on the hills of the Taconick range. Chlor=
ite slate has already=20

been mentioned as occurring on the same range.  8. _Rubble Stone._ In round=
ed masses through=20

the valley.  9. _Compact Limestone._ In several places low in the valley. N=
ear the college it is=20

white and deep gray. In the veins of the latter, _talc_ is diffused in all =
directions. It contains silex,=20

often from 3 to 15 per cent., and sometimes gives fire with steel. In some =
cases it is earthy. On=20

Green River, one and a half mile south of the college, it lies in thin stra=
ta, which are divided by=20

seams into very regular rhomboidal plates of various sizes. On some scatter=
ed fragments on this=20

river, are found carbonate of lime in crystals, with pieces of white feldsp=
ar. On West Brook, this=20

gray limestone is traversed by a vein of quartz, containing sulphuret of ir=
on. The strata of this rock=20

are almost invariably inclined to the east. A coarse _soapstone_ is found i=
n the limestone near the=20

college, and a vein made up of brown argillaceous slate, soapstone, quartz,=
 and sulphuret of iron,=20

passes through it. This limestone appears to be very different from that at=
 the base of Saddle=20

Mountain, and from that which yields the marble of Berkshire county. It may=
 still be _primitive_, but=20

_primitive compact limestone_.  10. _Granitell_ of Kirwan, _Quartz_, and _F=
eldspar_. This=20

aggregate forms extensive strata at the east base of Stone Hill. The feldsp=
ar is diffused in grains=20

through the quartz, and sometimes crystalline, forming _porphyritic quartz_=
. This aggregate is=20

often compact and very hard, but frequently it is porous and hard, forming =
good millstones.=20

Sometimes the quartz appears in such fragments, that the stone resembles _b=
reccia_.  11. _Black=20

Tourmaline._ In beautiful small six-sided prisms, in scattered pieces of mi=
ca slate at the base of=20

Stone Hill.  12. _Amianthus._ Only a small specimen, attached to _argillace=
ous slate_.  13. _Bitter=20

Spar._ On compact limestone at West Brook. Some of the crystals are rhomboi=
ds, and some=20

appear to be the half of rhomboids split through their longer diagonal.  14=
. _Jasper._ The common=20

brown or red, and black, in small rounded masses, and also a piece of varie=
gated or striped=20

jasper.  15. _Galena._ Only a specimen in the limestone on West Brook.  16.=
 _Iron Ore._ _Bog=20

ore_ on the Hoosack, a mile northeast of the college. _Yellow earth_, from =
which _yellow ochre_=20

is obtained in great quantity, in a hill (R) on the bank of Green River, 2 =
miles south of the college.=20

At the north end of Saddle Mountain, but low down, yellow earth is connecte=
d with _reddle_, or a=20

substance much resembling it. It is less hard than the common reddle, but i=
s composed of the=20

same ingredients.  _Magnetic Oxyd of Iron_, regular octahedrons, in mica sl=
ate at the base of=20



Stone Hill.  _Supersulphuret of Iron_, massive and crystallized, in argilla=
ceous slate, mica slate,=20

compact limestone, and=20

of the maxims of the meadow. The grass seed to sow depends upon the soil an=
d here every man=20

must be his own judge. Not every farmer, however, knows the grass adapted t=
o his soil. If he does=20

and seeds by the bushel, or other measures, he is apt to be misled.  Includ=
ing millet and=20

Hungarian there were in Kansas this year 3,730,150 acres of land devoted to=
 the raising of hay.=20

The yield per acre was 1.61 tons, or a total product of 6,002,576 tons. Non=
e of the tame grasses=20

have as yet attained a large area in this State, the most extensively grown=
 being timothy which=20

has an area of 95,844 acres. The great bulk of the grass lands mentioned ab=
ove is the prairie,=20

protected by fence. The eastern third of the State probably contains four f=
ifths of the tame grass=20

area. The question of the growing of tame grasses in Kansas is receiving mu=
ch attention from=20

farmers, it becoming of vast importance as people increase the number of th=
eir farm animals. The=20

question no doubt will be satisfactorily solved within a few years, and the=
 tame grass area will=20

increase to its just proportion.  The agricultural changes in Great Britain=
 continue to be of a=20

marked character. The area devoted to grain crops the past year was 8,618,6=
75 acres, which is=20

214,705 acres less than in 1882. Potatoes were planted on 543,000 acres, an=
d turnips and=20

Swedes on 2,029,000 acres--all showing a slight increase; but mangolds, vet=
ches and other green=20

crops have declined by 21,000 acres on the figures for the previous year. C=
lover and the grasses=20

show an increase of 58,500 acres. The change from tilth to permanent pastur=
age is again=20

conspicuous, there being 15,065,300 acres as compared with 14,821,600 last =
year. Ten years ago=20

grass covered 13,000,000 acres, while arable land has fallen during that pe=
riod from 18,186,000=20

to  17. _Prase._ Beautiful, and containing sulphuret of iron; lately found =
by Mr. Eaton, a little east=20

of the summit of Hoosack Mountain, in Florida.  18. _Puddingstone._ Where P=
ownal Mountain=20

reaches the Hoosack, (T) 3 miles north of the college, are some hills of th=
is aggregate. It is=20

composed of rounded masses of quartz, chlorite, and limestone, of various s=
izes, connected by an=20

argillaceous cement.  19. _Potters' Clay._ Excellent for vessels of common =
pottery.  The minerals=20

of this section, it is obvious, are not very important; but as connected wi=
th a transverse section of=20

the country, they possess considerable interest. For this reason they have =
been particularly=20

mentioned.  In the north part of Williamstown is a _mineral spring_, famili=
arly called the _Sand=20

Spring_ (S.) The water rises from several places in a reservoir of about a =
rod in diameter, and=20

from one to three feet deep. It is very soft and warm, but contains very li=
ttle saline or earthy matter.=20

Gas continually rises in it. It appears much to resemble the spring at New =
Lebanon, New-York,=20

and has proved useful in the cure particularly of some _cutaneous_ diseases=
.  The _transverse=20

section_, connected with the map, passes over Stone Hill, and the north par=
t of Saddle Mountain.=20

The different rocks are shown in the section, directly below their places o=
n the map, by drawing=20

lines from the several strata parallel to the sides of the map. This sectio=
n is connected with that=20

given by Mr. Hitchcock, in the 2d number of this Journal. It ought perhaps =
to be mentioned, that=20

according to Mr. Eaton's account, the granite of this section sinks under g=
neiss to the east, and=20

rises again in Hampshire County, "supporting the same rock of gneiss;" but =
where it reappears,=20

the granite contains "many imbedded minerals." This=20


_
increase, and also market gardening. In the matter of live stock there is a=
n improvement which=20

leads to the hope that the heavy losses of recent years will be made up.   =
