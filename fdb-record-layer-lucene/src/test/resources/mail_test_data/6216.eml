 _From a painting by=20

Mary Cassatt_]  One of her earliest works recently has been added to the Wi=
lstach collection in=20

Philadelphia. It shows a man and two women on a balcony. The straight line =
of the balcony railing=20

stretches across the foreground without any modification of its rigid linea=
r effect. The man's figure=20

is in shadow, barely perceptible as to detail, yet indicated without uncert=

vagueness of any kind, a solid figure the "tactile values" of which are cle=

N WITH A FAN  _From a=20

painting by Mary Cassatt_]     MAX KLINGER     III  MAX KLINGER   Max Kling=
er is one of the=20

most interesting and representative figures in the art of Germany to-day. E=
ssentially German in=20

manner of thought and feeling, he has brought into the stiff formality of e=
arly nineteenth century=20

German painting and sculpture a plasticity of mind and an elevation of purp=
ose and idea that=20

suggest (as most that is excellent in Germany does suggest) the influence o=
f Goethe. In his=20

restless interrogation of all the forms of representative art, his work in =
the mass shows a curious=20

mingling of fantasy, imagination, brusque realism, antique austerity, and m=
odern science. The=20

enhancing of the sense of life is, however, always the first thought with h=
im, and lies at the root of=20

his method of introducing color into sculpture, not by the means of a deade=
ning pigment but by the=20

use of marbles of deep tints and positive hues, and of translucent stones. =
As an artist, his chief=20

distinction is this unremitting intention to convey in one way or another t=
he sense of the vitalizing=20

principle in animate objects. We may say of him that his drawing is sometim=
es poor, that his=20

imagination may be clumsy and infelicitous, that his treatment of a subject=
 is frequently coarse and=20

even crude, but we cannot deny that out of his etchings and paintings, and =
out of his great strange=20

sculptured figures looks the spirit of life, more often defiant than noble,=
 more often capricious than=20

beautiful, but not to be mistaken, and the rarest phenomenon in the art pro=
duct of his native=20

country. He unites, too, a profound respect for the art of antiquity with a=
 stout modern long was=20

headed off.  Perry, who held but a commission of master commandant, despite=
 his high-acting=20

rank, was promoted at once to a captaincy, the date of his commission beari=
ng the date of his=20

victory. He was given the command of the frigate _Java_, a new forty-four-g=
un ship then fitting out=20

at Baltimore. Gold medals were awarded to him and to Elliott by Congress, a=
nd silver medals to=20

each of the commissioned officers. A silver medal also was given to the nea=
rest male relative of=20

Lieutenant Brooks, of the marines, and swords to the nearest male relatives=
 of Midshipmen Laub,=20

Claxton, and Clark. Three months=E2=80=99 extra pay was voted to all the of=
ficers, seamen, and marines,=20

and, in addition, Congress gave $225,000 in prize-money, to be divided amon=
g the American=20

forces engaged in the action. This sum was distributed in the following pro=
portions: Commodore=20

Chauncey, who was in command on the lakes, $12,750; Perry and Elliott, $714=
0 each--besides=20

which Congress voted Perry an additional $5000; the commanders of gunboats,=
 lieutenants,=20

sailing-masters, and lieutenants of marines received $2295 each; midshipmen=
, $811; petty=20



officers, $447 per capita; and marines and sailors, $209 apiece.  No money,=
 however, could repay=20

the brave men for the service they had rendered the country. To-day the dwe=
llers along the shores=20

of Lake Erie preserve the anniversary of the battle as an occasion for rejo=
icing. While the naval=20

actions at sea reflected honor and glory to their commanders and credit to =
the service, the winning=20

of Lake Erie averted a national catastrophe.[99]     XI  THE BATTLE OF LAKE=
 CHAMPLAIN, 1814=20

The first Thomas Macdonough was a major in the Continental Army, and his th=
ree sons also=20

possessed desires for entering the service of their country. The oldest had=
 been a midshipman=20

under Commodore Truxton, but, being wounded in the action between the _Cons=
tellation_ and the=20

_L=E2=80=99Insurgente_, he had to retire from the navy owing to the amputat=
ion of his leg. But his younger=20

brother, Thomas Macdonough, Jr., succeeded him, and he has rendered his nam=
e and that of=20

Lake Champlain inseparable; but his fearlessness and bravery were shown on =
many occasions=20

long before he was ordered to the lakes.  In 1806 he was first-lieutenant o=
f the _Siren_, a little=20

sloop-of-war in the Mediterranean service. On one occasion when Captain Smi=
th, the commander=20

of the _Siren_, had gone on shore, young Lieutenant Macdonough saw a boat f=
rom a British=20

frigate lying in the harbor row up to an American brig a short distance off=
, and afterward put out=20

again with one more man in her than she had originally. This looked suspici=
ous, and Macdonough=20

sent to the brig to ascertain the reason, with the result that he found tha=
t an American had been=20

impressed by the English captain=E2=80=99s orders. Macdonough quietly lower=
ed his own boat and put after=20

the heavy cutter, which he soon overhauled. Although he had but four men=20


_
a union that gives to his better work both dignity and force. What he seems=
 to lack is the one=20

impalpable, delicate, elusive quality that makes for our enjoyment of so ma=
ny imperfect=20

productions, and the lack of which does so much to blind us to excellence i=
n other directions--the=20

quality of charm, which in the main depends upon the possession by the arti=
st of taste.  Max=20

Klinger was born in Leipzig on the eighteenth of February, 1857. His father=
 was a man of artistic=20

predilections, and in easy circumstances, so that the choice of a bread-win=
ning profession for the=20

son was not of first importance. As Klinger's talent showed itself at a ver=
y early age, it was=20

promptly decided that he should be an artist. He left school at the age of =
sixteen, and went to=20

Karlsruhe, where Gussow was beginning to gather about him a large number of=
 pupils. In 1875 he=20

followed Gussow to Berlin, where he came also under the influence of Menzel=
. Gussow's teaching=20

was all in the line of individualism and naturalism. He led his pupils stra=
ight to nature for their=20

model, and encouraged them to paint only what they themselves saw and felt.=
 For this grounding=20

in the representation of plain facts Klinger has been grateful in his matur=
er years, and looks back=20

to his first master with admiration and respect as having early armed him a=
gainst his tendency=20

toward fantasy and idealism. His early style in the innumerable drawings of=
 his youth is thin and=20

weak, without a sign of the bold originality characterizing his recent work=
, and he obviously=20

needed all the support he could get from frank and sustained observation of=
 nature. His first oil-

painting, exhibited in Berlin in 1878, showed the result of Gussow's influe=
nce in its solidity and=20

practical brought him on board the _Siren_. When the English captain heard,=
 or rather saw, what=20

had occurred--it was right under the bow of his frigate that the affair too=
k place--he waxed wroth,=20

and, calling away his gig, he rowed to the _Siren_ to demand an explanation=
.  The following=20

account of the incident is quoted from the life of Macdonough in Frost=E2=
=80=99s _Naval Biography_:  =E2=80=9CThe=20

Englishman desired to know how Macdonough dared to take a man from one of h=
is Majesty=E2=80=99s=20

boats. The lieutenant, with great politeness, asked him down into the cabin=
; this he refused, at the=20

same time repeating the same demand, with abundance of threats. The English=
man threw out=20

some threats that he would take the man by force, and said he would haul th=
e frigate alongside=20

the _Siren_ for that purpose. To this Macdonough replied that he supposed h=
is ship could sink the=20

_Siren_, but as long as she could swim he should keep the man. The English =
captain said to=20

Macdonough:  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98You are a very young man, and a very indiscr=
eet young man. Suppose I had been=20

in the boat--what would you have done?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I would =
have taken the man or lost my life.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98What, sir!=
=20

would you attempt to stop me, if I were now to attempt to impress men from =
that brig?=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98I would;=20

and to convince yourself I would, you have only to make the attempt.=E2=80=
=99  =E2=80=9COn this the Englishman=20

went on board his ship, and shortly afterward was seen bearing down in the =
direction of the=20

American vessel. Macdonough ordered his boat manned and armed, got into her=
 himself, and was=20

in readiness for pursuit. The Englishman took a circuit around the American=
 brig, and returned=20

again to the frigate. When Captain Smith came on board he justified the con=
duct of Macdonough,=20

and declared his intention to protect the=20
