f-seen standing on the=20

threshold, the fine rich color harmony of greens and reds and blues and bro=
wns held together by a=20

subtlety of tone that involves no loss of strength.  His outdoor scenes are=
 hardly less personal in=20

their portraiture. There is the one called "Apple-Bloom" with a Larsson chi=
ld in a pink sunbonnet=20

clinging to the slim stem of a young apple-tree; in the distance some long =
low red buildings behind=20

a board fence, in the foreground the pale green of spring grass; there is t=
he one in which the larger=20

part of the picture is filled with delicate field growth, thin sprays of pi=
nk, blue and white blossoms,=20

and long slender leaves, at the top of the canvas a little thicket of trees=
 with a small bright head=20

peering between the branches; there is the one in which a baby lies on the =
greensward under the=20

trees; each has an indescribable charm of individuality. Doubtless resembli=
ng a hundred other=20

groves or meadows, these have an expression of their own distinguishing the=
m from their kind. It=20

is the genius of the close observer for discrimination between like things.=
  Whatever the subject,=20

the treatment is always brilliant, frank and joyous. Larsson's brushwork is=
 light and flowing; he has,=20

indeed, a certain French vivacity of technique, but his motives and his per=
sonal point of view are=20

so purely Scandinavian as to leave no other impression on the mind. Nor is =
he merely the painter=20

of the Swedish type. He is the painter of intimate home life and character =
as found within his own=20

walls. Hardly any other family in Sweden is known so well as his, and the v=
ariety and enthusiasm=20

of his mind lend spontaneity to these  1860. Abraham Lincoln elected Presid=

eighty-five years after the declaration of independence (a space completely=
 covered by the lives of=20

men still living), a new confederacy of seven Southern states was formed, a=

fabric, the exemplar and hope of every lover of freedom throughout the worl=

hopelessly rent. Of these seven states but two were of the original thirtee=

 behalf of Texas;=20

two states, Alabama and Mississippi, lay within original claims of Georgia,=
 but had been ceded to=20

the Union and organized as Federal territories.  April 11, 1861, found a fu=
lly organized separate=20

government established for these seven states, with a determination to form=
 a separate nation,=20

most forcibly expressed by the presence of an army at Charleston, South Car=
olina, which next day=20

was to open fire upon a feebly manned fort, and thus to begin a terrible ci=
vil war. The eight other=20

slave states were in a turmoil of anxiety, leaning toward their sisters of =

 Furstenberg, one=20

of the foremost patrons of art in Sweden, he tested himself on a series of =
paintings for a girl's=20

school in Gothenburg. He accomplished his task in a manner entirely his own=
, taking for his=20

subjects typical figures of women in Sweden at different periods of history=
--a Viking's widow; the=20

 less than those of the=20

states which had already seceded.  The North, in the middle of April, was o=
nly emerging from a=20

condition of stupefied amazement at a condition which scarcely any of its s=
tatesmen, and=20

practically none of the men of every-day life, had thought possible. It was=
 to this crisis that the=20

country had been brought by the conflicting views of the two great and stro=

the Union respecting slavery, and by the national aspirations which, howeve=
