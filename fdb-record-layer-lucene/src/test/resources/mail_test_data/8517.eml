of the military service; but these were checked by his premature death, [22=
] less than two months=20

after entering on his office. In his place, the command was assumed (April =
23) by the officer next=20

him in rank, Juan Crmer; but he surrendered this office on September 9 foll=
owing to the new=20

segundo cabo, Pedro Antonio Salazar Castillo y Varona. The latter, on April=
 25, 1836, issued an=20

edict that "the plain [sencillas] pesetas coined in the Peninsula should be=
 accepted [in the islands]=20

at their lawful value of four reals velln instead of five, as if they were =
pillar coins [columnarias]; [23]=20

accordingly they began to circulate, having been recently introduced into t=
he islands." On June 11,=20

1836, the superintendency of treasury affairs was assumed by Urrjola in pla=
ce of Enrquez. [24] On=20

July 28, Salazar found it necessary to issue an edict for the enforcement o=
f the laws which=20

prohibited carrying gunpowder and firearms to the Indias, and selling them =
in countries hostile to=20

Spain; this referred especially to Moroland, where evidently the pirates ha=
d been thus aided by=20

unscrupulous traders to make their raids against the northern islands. Sala=
zar thought that he=20

could restrain those piracies by carrying on commerce with the Moros, and t=
herefore made a=20

treaty with the sultan of Jol, Mahamad Diamalud Quiram (September 22, 1836)=
, which stipulated=20

"that every three-masted ship which made port at Jol with Chinese passenger=
s from Manila should=20

pay 2,000 pesos fuertes, and smaller vessels in proportion to their size;" =
but "the most important=20

cargo which went from Manila to Jol never exceeded 2,500 pesos. The Joloan =
barks which should=20

go to Zamboanga were to pay a duty of one per cent, and those which entered=
 at Manila two per=20

cent; but no Joloan bark was accustomed to go to Manila." The governor of Z=
amboanga also=20

made a treaty with another Moro ruler; but it resulted only in increasing t=
he insolence of the=20

pirates, who paid no attention to their treaties. At the beginning of 1836,=
 Salazar sent an=20

expedition under Galvey to occupy the Igorrot country; but it was, despite =
Galvey's remonstrances,=20

sent in too great haste, and without adequate preparations, and too near th=
e beginning of the rainy=20

season; they reached that region, and built some forts, but so many of the =
soldiers were attacked=20

by sickness that the expedition was forced to give up the undertaking and r=
etire, "without any other=20

result than the expenditure of several thousand dollars." [25] In that same=
 year, Pearanda=20

conducted with brilliant success an expedition to dislodge the pirates from=
 Masbate Island, where=20

they had fortified themselves. "Afterward, he established a system of signa=
ls in the provinces of=20

the south, to watch the movements of those pirates." On January 26, 1837, S=
alazar sent an urgent=20

request to the Spanish government for the despatch of Spanish regulars to s=
upply the parish=20

curacies throughout the archipelago, as (for the same reasons advanced by f=
ormer governors) he=20

considered the Indian clerics unfit for that purpose. In view of the the co=
oled surface--volcanoes in=20

miniature. The same property belongs to the oxide of lead, and some other m=
etals.  Now water=20

can be made to absorb more than a thousand times its bulk of ammonia; more =
than five hundred=20

times its bulk of hydrochloric acid. Alcohol may absorb three hundred times=
 its volume of=20

sulphurous acid. Charcoal may absorb one hundred times its volume of ammoni=
a, eighty-five=20

times its volume of hydrochloric acid, sixty-five times its volume of sulph=
uretted hydrogen, fifty-five=20

times its volume of sulphurous and thirty-five times its volume of carbonic=
 acid. Iron, steel and=20

melted sulphur absorb many gases.  We have already seen that immense volume=
s of gases are=20

thrown off in volcanic action. Now if a column of lava rises comparatively =
slowly in its =E2=80=9Cchimney,=E2=80=9D=20

the imprisoned gases rapidly escape, producing violent boiling, but not a p=
ositive explosion. But if=20

it rises very rapidly, the sudden removal of the pressure causes so sudden =
an expansion of the=20



compressed gases in its upper portion as to amount to a tremendous explosio=
n, which reduces the=20

lava to microscopic dust.  This very principle was made practical use of in=
 a mechanical=20

contrivance invented to make paper pulp out of common cane, such as the far=
mer=E2=80=99s boy delights in=20

for a fishing pole. The hard, woody fibre was placed in a powerful iron cyl=
inder full of water. A=20

strong lid being adjusted, the whole was heated far above the boiling point=
 of water. Naturally,=20

every cell would be forced full of moisture by the immense pressure. After =
some hours heating, the=20

lid was suddenly removed, and by the sudden expansion of the water into ste=
am the cane was=20

blown to atoms.  [Illustration: CRATER OF ORIZABA.]  A beautiful product of=
 the volcano of=20

Kilauea is the substance known as =E2=80=9CPele=E2=80=99s Hair.=E2=80=9D Sm=
all particles of glass shot violently into the air=20

leave behind them long, glittering filaments, like gossamers. Birds often b=
uild their nests of these=20

beautiful threads. Man, taking a hint from nature, has learned to manufactu=
re the glass hair for=20

himself by passing jets of steam through the molten slag of iron furnaces. =
It much resembles=20

cotton wool, and is used for packing boilers and piston-heads, and similar =
purposes.  The=20

appearance of fire at the summit of a volcano is rarely ever real flame. An=
y who has seen the=20

peculiar appearance occasioned by brilliant illumination on a moist or fogg=
y evening may readily=20

perceive the cause. The phenomenon popularly known as the =E2=80=9Csun draw=
ing water=E2=80=9D is of the same=20

character. The immense cloud of vapor ascending from the volcano glows with=
 the light sent up=20

from the molten mass below. So it may be seen brilliant by night, and only =
a dark cloud by day.=20

Stromboli has been called the light-house of the Mediterranean. In constant=
 action, the brilliant=20

light at night slowly fades: then suddenly breaks out as bright as before. =
This alternating results=20

from the bursting of bubbles in the crater, which expose a new, hot surface=
. This rapidly cools;=20

then another bubble bursts; and so the process continues. This may=20

ars there should be=20

sent to Filipinas, which, added to those already in the islands, would be s=
ufficient for the parishes.=20

The political disturbances in Spain found some reflection in the distant co=
lonies; and in February,=20

1837, there was danger of a tumult arising, "some insisting that the Consti=
tution should be=20

proclaimed, in order that they might utilize the change to their own advant=
age;" among these were=20

several officers of high rank. Absurd reports were circulated throughout Ma=
nila: that the governor=20

was opposed to the proclamation, and was intending to banish certain person=
s from the country,=20

and that he was a Carlist, etc. Violent measures were proposed by some of t=
he radicals, but these=20

were resisted by some of the cooler heads; and many citizens opposed the pr=
oclamation of the=20

Constitution, fearing that serious disturbances would result. Salazar, bein=
g informed of these=20

things, promised that when the royal despatches arrived he would open them =
in the presence of=20

all, and fulfil whatever orders he should suggested the alternating light n=
ow in common use in=20

great light-houses.  In the Galapagos, and other volcanic islands of the Pa=
cific, occurs another=20

curious feature of volcanic action. Some places abound in seeming mounds or=
 domes, which may=20

be sometimes readily broken in with a heavy stone. These are produced by bu=
bbles which partially=20

cooled, when the lava below found some rent or outlet in another quarter an=
d flowed away, leaving=20

the solidified bubble.  Sometimes the cavern left by the retreating lava ab=
ounds in strange=20

beauties. A sailor, who with a comrade, explored one of these volcanic cave=
rns, gives the=20

following account of it:  =E2=80=9CIn a sharp, deep valley of Albemarle we =
had broken in the roof of a=20

bubble; and as we looked in we saw we had opened the way into a tunnel abou=
t fifteen feet in=20

width, and extending either way as far as we could see from our position. B=
y the lights which=20

entered from above, we made out the floor as about twenty feet beneath us, =
and that the walls=20

were curiously marked with columnar forms. My companion, who had dabbled in=
 the sciences,=20

proposed that we should=20
