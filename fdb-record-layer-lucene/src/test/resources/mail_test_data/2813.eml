"Proverbium est sermo, rem manifestam obscuritate tegens."  The old proverb=
 then has a soul of=20

M.  _Dr. Matthew Sutcliffe_ (Vol. iv., p. 152.).--Your learned corresponden=
t MR. CROSSLEY is=20

right in his conjecture that this celebrated controversialist was of a fami=
ly settled at Mayroyd in the=20

parish of Halifax in Yorkshire. According to a pedigree certified in 1624 b=
y Sir William Segar,=20

Garter, he was the second son of John Sutcliffe of Melroyd, in the county o=
f York, gent., by his=20

wife Margaret, daughter of ---- Owlsworth of Ashley in the same county. The=
 Doctor married Ann,=20

daughter of John Bradley of Louth, co. Lincoln, Esq., and had issue an only=
 daughter Ann, the wife=20

of Mr. Halls or Halse, of the county of Devon. The Doctor had four brothers=
, viz. Adam, Solomon,=20

Luke, and John. Adam, the eldest, lived at Grimsby, co. Lincoln, and had an=
 only daughter, Judith.=20

Solomon was of Melroyd and of Grimsby; he married Elizabeth, daughter of Jo=
hn Bradley of=20

Louth, Esq., by Frances his wife, daughter of ---- Fairfax of Denton, co. Y=
ork, and had issue four=20

daughters, and also one son, viz. John Sutcliffe, one of the esquires of th=
e body to King James.=20

His wife was Alice, daughter of Luke Woodhouse of Kimberley, co. Norfolk, E=
sq., and he had issue=20

one daughter, Susan. Segar granted arms to this gentleman in 1624. Of the o=
ther brothers of the=20

Dean, Luke died unmarried, and John married a daughter of Jo. Kirton of Lin=
colnshire.      F. R. R.=20

, p. 230.; Vol. iv., pp.=20

58. 122. 139.).--Having every wish to accede to the request of your corresp=
ondent C., I have made=20

a search, but am unable to lay my hand at present on the publication by Cur=
ll. There can be no=20

doubt that I shall ultimately meet with it; and when I do, it will be quite=
 at his service. Having=20

compared it not very long ago with the folio edition by Boreman of this Imi=
tation, which I suppose=20

was the first in its complete state, I can be under no mistake as to the ex=
istence of the prior=20

publication. It occurs in a thin 8vo. published by Curll in 1716, containin=
g poetical miscellanies,=20

which in my copy are bound up with other tracts. It is headed "By Mr. P----=
e," and contains only a=20

portion of that subsequently printed. Curll afterwards reprinted the Imitat=
ion, as published by=20

Boreman, in one of the volumes, I think the third of the collection, which =
he styles "Letters of Mr.=20

Pope."  That the Imitation is by Pope, though I am not aware of any express=
 acknowledgment of it=20

by him, there can be no doubt, and as little that it found its way to the p=
ress, as published by=20

Boreman, with his privity. Curll even says, if any weight be due to the ass=
ertions of such a=20

miscreant, that Pope received a sum of money for it from Boreman. But I do =
not consider that=20

Pope can be deemed to have affiliated it by its publication in Dodsley's ed=
ition in 1738; which is,=20

as far as I have always understood, a mere bookseller's collection. The onl=
y collection of his works=20

which can be called his own, and for which he is fairly responsible, is tha=
t in 2 vols., folio and 4to.,=20

1717-35, to each volume of which a preface or notice by him is prefixed; an=
d in the latter of these=20

volumes, though previously published, he has not included this Imitation, w=
hich seems to indicate=20

that he did not feel disposed to acknowledge it publicly, and indeed he had=
 good reason to be=20

ashamed of it.      JAS. CROSSLEY.  _M. Lominus, Theologus_ (Vol. iv., p. 1=
93.).--The exact title=20

of the work inquired for is, _Blackloanae Haeresis, olim in Pelagio et Mani=
chaeis damnatae, nunc=20

denuo renascentis, Historia et Confutatio_. This 4to. volume consists of 33=
2 pages, exclusive of=20



the dedicatory epistle and the appendix; and a "printed account" of the aut=
hor may be seen in Sir=20

James Ware's _Writers of Ireland_ (ed. Harris, pp. 191-3), and in Dodd's _C=
hurch History of=20

England_, vol. iii. pp. 284-5.: Brussels, 1742. It is to         *       * =

ne=E2=80=99s time be limited, and=20

eat slowly, as food thus taken in a rush is of small use in the internal ec=
onomy. A few mouthfuls,=20

well masticated, will possibly do more good, and certainly produce less dis=
comfort, than three=20

times as much swallowed in indigestible chunks. And after the short repast =

let us blush to say it! one does meet many men who clean and pare their nai=
ls in the presence of=20

family and intimate friends. Perhaps it is due to the fact that a woman doe=
s not carry a pocket-

knife that she is seldom seen doing this. Her manicure instruments are kept=
 upon her dressing-

table, and it is in her own room that she performs this very necessary part=
 of her toilet.         *       *=20

duty of respect to her=20

elders. She is too prone to think that the boys of the family should rise f=
or the older people, should=20

remain standing until parents are seated, and should always be ready to run=
 errands, or to deny=20

themselves for their seniors. The duty to do all these things is incumbent =
on the girl or woman in=20

the presence of those who are her elders or superiors. The girl or young ma=
tron who reclines in an=20
