authenticity.  In a small town in Alabama was struggling a small National B=
ank. Its capital was=20

$25,000 and its surplus was $12,500. It was a compulsory customer of the Fe=
deral Reserve=20

Super-Shylockery sucking blood at Atlanta, Georgia. Its money had been comm=
andeered by law=20

to buy stock in the Super-Shylockery. Its reserve deposits had been conscri=
pted by law to feed=20

pap to the same parasite. It served the cotton industry--the breath of indu=
strial life in its territory. Its=20

name is not given because identification might work it great harm--but the =
Federal Reserve=20

Oligarchs know its identity. Don't you ever doubt it.  This little National=
 Bank in Alabama was in the=20

grip of the Federal Reserve Octopus. It had to move the cotton crop in its =
territory. Farmers,=20

planters, merchants--and in short, all industry in its territory including =
its own salvation--depended=20

on the moving and on the marketing of the cotton crop. It was "root hog or =
die" and this little bank=20

rooted and was looted precisely in this wise: It had to borrow from the Fed=
eral Reserve Super-

Shylockery at Atlanta. It had no other house of refuge. It had to borrow so=
mething over $100,000=20

from the Federal Reserve Bank at Atlanta and for the week's period ending o=
n July 31, 1920, it=20

was charged and it paid as high as _thirty-one per cent per annum interest_=
! Two months later=20

when its loan reached as high as $115,000 it was charged and it paid as hig=
h as _eighty-seven=20

and one-half per cent per annum interest_ to this subter-human super-Shyloc=
k. For the two weeks=20

ending on September 30, 1920, it was borrowing an average of $115,211. Two =
weeks' interest at=20

six per cent would have been $288, but the records show that this little ba=
nk paid the Federal=20

Reserve Pawnbrokery at Atlanta for interest on that amount for that time $2=
,189--running all the=20

way from six to _eighty-seven and one-half per cent per annum_! The actual =
average time for this=20

loan for that two weeks' period was almost exactly at the rate of _forty-fi=
ve per cent per annum_,=20

or at the rate of $51,884 per year for the use of $115,211! In about nine m=
onths that loan of=20

$115,211 at that rate would have eaten up the capital and surplus of that l=
ittle Alabama National=20

Bank. Was that banking or was it putrid pawnbrokery? Oughtn't the Federal R=
eserve Bank at=20

Atlanta to put the three ball sign of pawnbrokery over its portals?  And ye=

It's enough to make a "kike" pawnbroker sob and moan at his soft-heartednes=

what real reason no one Pittsburg, with the view of recovering that fort, J=
ohnson completely=20

vanquished them (July 24). The discomfited crew burned their posts in that =
region and retreated=20

precipitately to Detroit. The following day Niagara surrendered, and thus, =
with Pittsburg also=20

saved, the West was entirely cut off from Canada, and the upper Ohio Valley=
 was placed in British=20

hands. The work of Stanwix having been accomplished by Johnson, the former,=
 who had been=20

greatly delayed by transport difficulties, advanced as promptly as possible=
 to the Forks of the=20

Ohio, and in the place of the old French works built the modernized strongh=
old of Fort Pitt.[38]  On=20

August 20, Wolfe fell seriously ill. Both he and the army were discouraged.=
 The casualties had=20

thus far been over eight hundred men, and disease had cut a wide swath thro=
ugh the ranks.=20

Desperate, he at last accepted the counsel of his officers, that a landing =
be attempted above the=20

town, supplies definitively cut off from Montreal, and Montcalm forced to f=
ight or surrender. From=20



September 3 to 12, Wolfe, arisen from his bed but still weak, quietly withd=
rew his troops from the=20

Montmorenci camp and transported them in vessels which successfully passed =
through a heavy=20

cannonading from the fort to safe anchorage in the upper basin. Reinforceme=
nts marching along=20

the southern bank, from Point L=C3=A9vis, soon joined their comrades aboard=
 the ships. For several=20

days this portion of the fleet regularly floated up and down the river abov=
e Quebec, with the=20

changing tide, thus wearing out Bougainville=E2=80=99s men, who in great pe=
rplexity followed the enemy=20

along the cliff-tops, through a beat of several leagues, until from sheer e=
xhaustion they at last=20

became careless.  On the evening of September 12, Saunders--whose admirable=
 handling of the=20

fleet deserves equal recognition with the services of Wolfe--commenced a he=
avy bombardment of=20

the Beauport lines, and feigned a general landing at that place. Montcalm, =
not knowing that the=20

majority of the British were by this time above the town, and deceived as t=
o his enemy=E2=80=99s real=20

intent, hurried to Beauport the bulk of his troops, save those necessary fo=
r Bougainville=E2=80=99s rear=20

guard. Meanwhile, however, Wolfe was preparing for his desperate attempt se=
veral miles up the=20

river.  Before daylight the following morning (September 13), thirty boats =
containing seventeen=20

hundred picked men, with Wolfe at their head, floated down the stream under=
 the dark shadow of=20

the apparently insurmountable cliffs. They were challenged by sentinels alo=
ng the shore; but, by=20

pretending to be a provision convoy which had been expected from up-country=
, suspicion was=20

disarmed. About two miles above Quebec they landed at an indentation then k=
nown as Anse du=20

Foulon, but now called Wolfe=E2=80=99s Cove. From the narrow beach a small,=
 winding path, sighted by=20

Wolfe two days before, led up through the trees and underbrush to the Plain=
s of Abraham. The=20

climbing party of twenty-four infantrymen found the path obstructed by an=
=20


_
from soft-heartedness--a portion of the usurious loot was disgorged by the =
Atlanta Federal=20

Reserve pawnbrokery. That isn't really interesting. What is really interest=
ing is the super-supernal=20

and subter-brutal gall to first extort it. Many a usurer when caught and co=
rnered has disgorged=20

loot--that's as old as usury. Jesse James' press agent could boast of as mu=
ch. When grilled on=20

this interesting subject the multi-initialed Governor Harding of the Federa=
l Reserve Board chittered=20

and chattered about "basic lines of credit" and "progressive rates of inter=
est," but that doesn't=20

chlorinate such sandbaggery. Any pawnbroker can mutter and mumble such phra=
ses.  When a=20

bank has to pay up to _eighty-seven and a half per cent_ interest you can i=
magine what its=20

customers must pay it.  And at the very time--during these very two weeks e=
nding September 30,=20

1920--when this little Alabama National Bank right at the door of real prod=
uction was being=20

charged those Shylock rates for a paltry loan, banks in New York were getti=
ng as high as=20

$100,000,000 handed out to them at from _five to seven per cent_. And yet y=
ou read about the=20

Federal Reserve System "equalizing interest rates," "emancipating credit" a=
nd the like bunk! Why,=20

it's enough to make Shylock and Pecksniff rend their cerements and jump fro=
m their graves and=20

have another try at extortion and at applied hypocrisy. A difference of _ei=
ghty per cent per annum_=20

between New York City--where nothing but parasitism is grown--and Alabama--=
where real wealth=20

of real cotton grows--is some difference, isn't it? And the eighty per cent=
 difference coddles=20

parasitism and penalizes production. This isn't the only sandbaggery of ext=
ortion perpetrated by=20

the Federal Reserve oligarchy. But it's a pretty good example, isn't it?  N=

CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION   I  Not a clause in the Declaration of I=
ndependence=20

sets forth the real and underlying cause of the American Revolution. The at=
tention of its writer was=20

bent upon recent events, and he dwelt only upon the immediate reasons for t=
hrowing off=20

allegiance to the British government. In the dark of the storm already upon=
 them, the men of the=20

time could hardly look with clear vision back to ultimate causes. They coul=
d not see that the=20

English kings had planted the seeds of the Revolution when, in their zeal t=
o get America=20

colonized, they had granted such political and religious privileges as temp=
ted the radicals and=20

dissenters of the time to migrate to America. Only historical research coul=
d reveal the fact that=20

from the year 1620 the English government had been systematically stocking =
the colonies with=20

dissenters and retaining in England the conformers. The tendency of coloniz=
ation was to leave the=20

conservatives in England, thus relatively increasing the conservative force=
 at home, while the=20

radicals went to America to fortify the radical political philosophy there.=
 Thus England lost part of=20

her potentiality for political development.  Not only were radicals constan=
tly settling in the colonies,=20

because of the privileges granted them there, but the Crown neglected to en=
force in the colonies=20

the same regulations that it enforced at home. The Act of Uniformity was no=
t extended to the=20

colonies, though rigidly enforced in England; the viceregal officers, the g=
overnors, permitted=20

themselves again and again to be browbeaten and disobeyed by the colonial l=
egislatures;[42] and=20

even the king himself had allowed Massachusetts (1635) to overreach him by =
not giving up her=20

charter.[43]  After a century of great laxity toward the colonies--a centur=
y in which the colonists=20

were favored by political privileges shared by no other people of that age;=
 after the environment=20

had established new social conditions, and remoteness and isolation had cre=
ated a local and=20

individual hatred of restraint; after the absence of traditions had made po=
ssible the institution of=20

representation by population, and self-government had taken on a new meanin=
g in the world; after=20

a great gulf had been fixed between the social, political, and economic ins=
titutions of the two parts=20

of the British empire--only then did the British government enter upon a po=
licy intended to make=20



the empire a unity.[44]  Independence had long existed in spirit in most of=
 the essential matters of=20

colonial life, and the British government had only to seek to establish its=
 power over the colonies in=20

order to arouse a desire for formal independence. The transition in England=
, therefore, to an=20

imperial ideal, about the middle of the eighteenth century, doubtless cause=
d the rending of the=20

empire. Walpole and Newcastle, whose administrations had just preceded the =
reign of George III.,=20

had let the colonies alone, and thus aided the colonial at the expense of t=
he imperial idea; while=20

their successors, Grenville and Townshend, ruling not wisely but too well, =
forced the colonists to=20

realize that they cared more for America than for England.  The time had co=
me, though these=20

ministers failed to see it, when the union of Great Britain with her coloni=
es depended on the=20

offspring=E2=80=99s disposition toward the mother-country. Good feeling wou=
ld preserve the union, but=20

dissatisfaction would make even forcible control impossible. Social and pol=
itical and economic ties=20

still bound the colonists to the home land, but these were weak ties as com=
pared with an=20

irrepressible desire for self-growth. The expression of their political ide=
als unrestrained by the=20

conservatism of the parent was a desired end to which they strove, almost u=
nconscious of their=20

object.  To understand the American Revolution, therefore, several facts mu=
st be clearly in mind--

first, that Great Britain had for one hundred and fifty years been growing =
to the dignity of an=20

empire, and that the thirteen colonies were a considerable part of that emp=
ire; second, the=20

colonies had interests of their own which were not favored by the growing s=
ize and strength of the=20

empire. They were advancing to new political ideals faster than the mother-=
country. Their=20

economic interests were becoming differentiated from those of England. They=
 were coming to=20

have wants and ambitions and hopes of their own quite distinct from those o=
f Great Britain.  At the=20

fatal time when the independent spirit of America had grown assertive, the =
politically active part of=20

the British people began unconsciously to favor an imperial policy, which t=
heir ministers=20

suggested, and which to them seemed the very essence of sound reasoning and=
 good=20

government. They approved of the proposed creation of executives who should=
 be independent of=20

the dictation of the colonial assemblies. There were also to be new adminis=
trative organs having=20

power to enforce the colonial trade regulations; and the defensive system o=
f the colonies was to=20

be improved by a force of regular troops, which was in part to be supported=
 by colonial taxes.  In=20

order to accomplish these objects, the king=E2=80=99s new minister, the ass=
iduous Grenville, who knew the=20

law better than the maxims of statesmanship, induced Parliament, in March, =
1764, to resolve upon=20

=E2=80=9Ccertain stamp duties=E2=80=9D for the colonies. A year later the =
=E2=80=9CGentle Shepherd,=E2=80=9D as Pitt had dubbed him,=20

proved his watchfulness by getting a stamp act passed,[45] which, though ne=
arly a duplicate of=20

one in force in England, and like one of Massachusetts=E2=80=99 own laws, n=
evertheless aroused every=20

colony to violent wrath.  This sudden flame of colonial passion rose from t=
he embers of discontent=20

with Grenville=E2=80=99s policy of enforcing the trade or navigation laws--=
those restrictions upon colonial=20

industries and commerce which were the outgrowth of a protective commercial=
 policy which=20

England had begun even before the discovery of America.[46] As the colonies=
 grew they began to=20

be regarded as a=20


_
And not only that, but at that very time all the money which all the twelve=
 Federal Reserve Banks=20

in the U.S.A. were lending on agricultural and live stock paper to the 9,00=
0 member banks in the=20

48 states of the U.S.A. amounted to the pitiful and piffling sum of but $51=
,068,000--not one-half of=20

the amount borrowed by one speculative bank in New York from the New York F=
ederal Reserve=20

Bank. At that time agricultural interests, particularly in the South, and l=
ive stock interests all over=20

the land were beseeching the Federal Reserve Oligarchy for money and beseec=
hing in vain.  Take=20

another look at the official figures for the month of November, 1920. At th=
is time the real producers=20

of real value--in the West and the Northwest and in the South and the South=
west--were gasping=20

for money and credit. Bear in mind that their property, their production an=
d their toil forms the real=20

foundation for the vast superstructure of American wealth. Where you find a=
 lily-fingered parasite=20

lolling in a mahoganized eyrie of splendor and gambling with money--the tok=
ens of production--

you find a battalion of real producers in the great stretches of America to=
iling to produce real=20

values. If there is to be any discrimination, if there is to be any partial=
ity shown by the overlords of=20

the Federal Reserve System, it ought to favor production of real wealth, an=
d not parasitism=20

gambling with its proceeds. When there was this drouth of credit and money =
where real wealth is=20

made, how was the Federal Reserve System opening its irrigation gates of mo=
ney? It shut them in=20

production's face and opened them wide at parasitism's demands.  At this ve=
ry time--in the middle=20

of November, 1920--one speculative bank in New York borrowed $134,000,000 f=
rom the Federal=20

Reserve Bank in New York, or $20,000,000 more than the Federal Reserve Bank=
 of Kansas City=20

was lending to the 1,091 member banks in the Tenth Federal Reserve District=
.  Another=20

speculative bank in New York borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank in New =
York $40,000,000=20

and, at the same time that bounties were given them for raising commodities=
 desired by England,=20

restrictions were placed upon American trade.[47] When the settlers of the =
northern and middle=20

colonies began manufacturing for themselves, their industry no sooner inter=
fered with English=20

manufactures than a law was passed to prevent the exportation of the produc=
tion and to limit the=20

industry itself. This system of restrictions, though it necessarily establi=
shed a real opposition of=20

interest between America and England, does not seem on the whole to have be=
en to the=20

disadvantage of the colonies;[48] nor was the English colonial system a whi=
t more severe than=20

that of other European countries.  In 1733, however, the Molasses Act went =
into effect,[49] and,=20

had it been enforced, would have been a serious detriment to American inter=
ests. It not only aimed=20

to stop the thriving colonial trade with the Dutch, French, and Spanish Wes=
t Indies, but was=20

intended to aid English planters in the British West Indies by laying a pro=
hibitive duty on imported=20

foreign sugar and molasses. It was not enforced, however, for the customs o=
fficials, by giving=20

fraudulent clearances, acted in collusion with the colonial importers in ev=
ading the law; but, in=20

1761, during the war with France, the thrifty colonists carried on an illeg=
al trade with the enemy,=20

and Pitt demanded that the restrictive laws be enforced.  The difficulty of=
 enforcing was great, for it=20

was hard to seize the smuggled goods, and harder still to convict the smugg=
ler in the colonial=20

courts. Search-warrants were impracticable, because the legal manner of usi=
ng them made the=20

informer=E2=80=99s name public, and the law was unable to protect him from =
the anger of a community fully=20

in sympathy with the smugglers. The only feasible way to put down this unpa=
triotic trade with the=20

enemy was to resort to =E2=80=9Cwrits of assistance,=E2=80=9D which would g=
ive the customs officers a right to=20

search for smuggled goods in any house they pleased.[50] Such warrants were=
 legal, had been=20



used=20

Minneapolis was lending to its 1,000 member banks in Minnesota, North Dakot=
a, South Dakota,=20

Montana and part of Wisconsin.  Another speculative bank in New York borrow=
ed from the New=20

York Federal Reserve Bank $30,000,000 more than the Federal Reserve Bank of=
 Dallas was=20

lending all its member banks in all its huge territory.  Another speculativ=

borrowed from the New York Federal Reserve Bank $20,000,000 more than the F=
ederal Reserve=20

Bank of Richmond was lending to all its member banks in the Fifth Federal R=
eserve District.=20

Massing these gigantic figures in another form, the fact is that at the tim=
e four speculative banks in=20

New York were borrowing from the New York Federal Reserve Bank an average o=
f $118,000,000=20

apiece--or practically as much money as the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Lo=
uis, Kansas City,=20

Minneapolis, Dallas and Richmond were lending more than 4,000 member banks =
in 21 states=20

comprising more than half the entire area of the United States!  If this is=

penalizing production, you find a name for it!  Millions by the hundreds fo=

sessed by a=20

squandermaniac prodigality for speculation and by a niggardly parsimony for=
 real production of=20

real wealth. It exalts the tokens of wealth and the developed was the Ameri=
can love of personal=20

liberty that when James Otis, a Boston lawyer, resisted by an impassioned s=
peech the issue of=20

such writs his arguments met universal approval.[52] In perfect good faith =
he argued, after the=20

manner of the ancient law-writers, that Parliament could not legalize tyran=
ny, ignoring the historical=20

fact that since the revolution of 1688 an act of Parliament was the highest=
 guarantee of right, and=20

Parliament the sovereign and supreme power. Nevertheless, the popularity of=
 Otis=E2=80=99 argument=20

showed what America believed, and pointed very plainly the path of wise sta=
tesmanship.  When,=20

in 1763, the Pontiac Indian rebellion endangered the whole West and made ne=
cessary a force of=20

soldiers in Canada, Grenville, in spite of the recent warning, determined t=
hat the colonies should=20

share the burden which was rapidly increasing in England. He lowered the su=
gar and molasses=20

duties,[53] and set out to enforce their collection by every lawful means. =
The trouble which=20

resulted developed more quickly in Massachusetts, because its harsh climate=
 and sterile soil=20

drove it to a carrying-trade, and the enforced navigation laws were thought=
 to threaten its ruin. It=20

was while American economic affairs were in this condition that Grenville r=
ashly aggravated the=20

discontent by the passage of his Stamp Act.  As the resistance of the colon=
ies to this taxation led=20

straight to open war and final independence, it will be worth while to look=
 rather closely at the=20

stamp tax, and at the subject of representation, which was at once linked w=
ith it. The terms of the=20

Stamp Act are not of great importance, because, though it did have at least=
 one bad feature as a=20

law, the whole opposition was on the ground that there should be no taxatio=
n whatever without=20

representation. It made no difference to its enemies that the money obtaine=
d by the sale of stamps=20



was to stay in America to support the soldiers needed for colonial protecti=
on. Nothing would=20

appease them while the taxing body contained no representatives of their ow=
n choosing.  To attain=20

this right, they made their fight upon legal and historical=20

propagandizes about "equalizing credits" and "emancipating credit," while i=

grossly discriminating in its credits and instead of "emancipating" credit =
enchains it to the golden=20

chariot of that, under the British constitution, there could be no taxation=
 except by persons known=20

and voted for by the persons taxed. The wisest men seemed not to see the ke=
rnel of the dispute.=20

A very real danger threatened the colonies--subject as they were to a body =
unsympathetic with the=20

political and economic conditions in which they were living--but they had n=
o legal safeguard.[54]=20

They must either sever the existing constitutional bond or get Parliament o=
