glance at the latter's elegant attire--the well-cut coat, the striped waist=
coat, the boots of fine=20

leather--the glance was quick and comprehensive and full of scorn, a flash =
that lasted only an=20

instant and was at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which=
 hid the pale, keen eyes.=20

"When the woman has brought me something to eat and drink," the stranger sa=
id after a while,=20

"we can talk. I have a good hour to spare, as those miserable nags must hav=
e some rest."  He too=20

spoke in French and with an air of authority, not to say arrogance, which c=
aused "the Captain's"=20

glance of scorn to light up with an added gleam of hate and almost of cruel=
ty. But he made no=20

remark and continued to sip his ale in silence, and for the next half-hour =
the two men took no more=20

notice of one another, just as if they had never travelled all those miles =
and come to this desolate=20

spot for the sole purpose of speaking with one another. During the course o=
f that half-hour the=20

woman brought in a dish of mutton stew, a chunk of bread, a piece of cheese=
 and a jug of spiced=20

ale, and placed them on the table: all of these good things the stranger co=
nsumed with an=20

obviously keen appetite. When he had eaten and drunk his fill, he rose from=
 the table, drew a=20

bench into the ingle-nook and sat down so that his profile only was visible=
 to his friend "the=20

Captain."  "Now, citizen Chauvelin," he said with at attempt at ease and fa=
miliarity not unmixed=20

with condescension, "I am ready for your news."   II  Chauvelin had winced =
perceptibly both at the=20

condescension and the familiarity. It was such a very little while ago that=
 men had trembled at a=20

look, a word from him: his silence had been wont to strike terror in quakin=
g hearts. It was such a=20

very little while ago that he had been president of the Committee of Public=
 Safety, all powerful, the=20

right hand of citizen Robespierre, the master sleuth-hound who could track =
an unfortunate=20

"suspect" down to his most hidden lair, before whose keen, pale eyes the in=
nermost secrets of a=20

soul stood revealed, who guessed at treason ere it was wholly born, who sce=
nted treachery ere it=20

was formulated. A year ago he had with a word sent scores of men, women and=
 children to the=20

guillotine--he had with a sign and a hunter's powers of endurance are prove=
rbial.  Each man had=20

his blanket strapped to his saddle.  Branches of various kinds of trees mak=
e a good mattress, and=20

the air of the prairie is well-known to conduce to appetite and slumber.  W=
ith such environment it is=20

scarcely necessary to add that the hunters enjoyed themselves, and that Vix=
en had a restful night,=20

probably without even a dream about hungry wolves.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  STIRR=
ING EVENTS=20

DESCRIBED.  The proverbial slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, and the well-kn=
own uncertainty of all=20

human affairs, received striking illustration in the person and prospects o=
f our hero, Daniel=20

Davidson, not long after the events narrated in the last chapter.  Up to th=
is period the unfortunate=20

colonists of the Red River Settlement had led a life chiefly of disappointm=
ent and disaster.=20

Although everything had been done for them by their patron the Earl of Selk=
irk with the best=20

intentions, the carrying out of his plans had been frustrated by the feuds =
of the rival fur companies,=20

the misunderstandings and the jealousies of Indians and half-breeds, and, t=
o some extent, by the=20

severity of the climate.  An open rupture took place between them and the N=
orth-westers.=20

Encounters between the contending parties occurred, in which several on bot=
h sides were killed,=20

and at last the North-Westers, attacking the settlers in force, drove them =
from the colony and burnt=20

their dwellings and homesteads.  Retreating to the north end of Lake Winnip=
eg, the colonists=20

found refuge at Jack River--three hundred miles distant.  From this place t=
hey were ultimately=20

recalled by the Hudson's Bay Company, which took them under its protection.=
  Returning to Red=20

River, the unfortunate but persevering people proceeded to resume their far=
ming operations.  But=20



the prospect before them was gloomy enough.  The lawless proceedings of the=
 rival companies=20

had convulsed the whole Indian country, and the evil seemed to culminate in=
 the Red River=20

Colony, to which retired servants of the fur-traders, voyageurs, adventurer=
s, and idlers gravitated=20

as to a centre; so that there was little prospect of their being allowed to=
 prosecute their agricultural=20

operations in peace.  The dissensions at last became so great that a=20


_
machinery of the ruthless Committee to work against innocent or guilty alik=
e on mere suspicion, or=20

to gratify his own hatred against all those whom he considered to be the en=
emies of that bloody=20

revolution which he had helped to make. Now his presence, his silence, had =
not even the power to=20

ruffle the self-assurance of an upstart.  But in the hard school both of su=
ccess and of failure=20

through which he had passed during the last decade, there was one lesson wh=
ich Armand once=20

Marquis de Chauvelin had learned to the last letter, and that was the lesso=
n of self-control. He had=20

winced at the other's familiarity, but neither by word nor gesture did he b=
etray what he felt.  "I can=20

tell you," he merely said quite curtly, "all I have to say in far less time=
 than it has taken you to eat=20

and drink, citizen Adet...."  But suddenly, at sound of that name, the othe=
r had put a warning hand=20

on Chauvelin's arm, even as he cast a rapid, anxious look all round the nar=
row room.  "Hush,=20

man!" new settlers, including many of the Scotch Highlanders, dispersed to =
seek a precarious=20

livelihood among the Indians, on the prairies bordering the waters of the M=
issouri, or to sustain=20

themselves and their families by fishing in the distant lakes, and hunting =
on their shores.  On the=20

advent of spring, however, most of these returned to the colony, with renew=
ed hope in agriculture,=20

and set to work--every man, woman, and child--to get some seed into the gro=
und.  But at this point=20

an event occurred which threw the colony into great consternation, and indu=
ced vigorous action on=20

the part of Lord Selkirk, which was the first step towards more peaceful ti=
mes.  The North-West=20

party, consisting chiefly of half-breeds, had augmented to upwards of three=
 hundred warriors.  It=20

would be more correct, perhaps, to style them banditti; for they had penetr=
ated through every part=20

of Rupert's Land, set law at defiance, pillaged and destroyed many of the e=
stablishments of their=20

rivals, and kept=20
