conversation: his whole attention appeared to be riveted on the business of keeping in his saddle, 

and holding his horse's head turned in the direction in which he wished it to go: he was riding a 

yard or two ahead of his companion, and it did not need any assurance on his part that he was no 

horseman: he sat very loosely in his saddle, his broad shoulders bent, his head thrust forward, his 

knees turned out, his hands clinging alternately to the reins and to the pommel with that ludicrous 

inconsequent gesture peculiar to those who are wholly unaccustomed to horse exercise.  His 

attitude, in fact, as well as the promiscuous set of clothes which he wore--a labourer's smock, a 

battered high hat, threadbare corduroys and fisherman's boots--at once suggested the loafer, the 

do-nothing who hangs round the yards of half-way houses and posting inns on the chance of 

earning a few coppers by an easy job which does not entail too much exertion on his part and 

which will not take him too far from his favourite haunts. When he spoke--which was not often--the 

soft burr in the pronunciation of the sibilants betrayed the Westcountryman.  His companion, on 

the other hand, was obviously a stranger: high of stature, and broadly built, his wide shoulders and 

large hands and feet, his square head set upon a short thick neck, all bespoke the physique of a 

labouring man, whilst his town-made clothes--his heavy caped coat, admirably tailored, his 

buckskin breeches and boots of fine leather--suggested, if not absolutely the gentleman, at any 

rate one belonging to the well-to-do classes. Though obviously not quite so inexperienced in the 

saddle as the other man appeared to be, he did not look very much at home in the saddle either: 

he held himself very rigid and more suited to their circumstances.  The steersman had his eye on 

them there, but they fortunately did not know it.  Apologising for this reminiscence, we return to the 

thread of our story.  Mrs Davidson was seated at breakfast one morning, with all her family around 

her in Prairie Cottage.  She had named it thus because, from one of the windows, there was to be 

had a peep of the prairies lying beyond the bushes by which it was surrounded.  Old McKay had 

named his cottage Ben Nevis, either because the country around was as flat as a pancake, or out 

of sheer contradictiousness.  "Have they found out anything more about the murder of that poor 

fellow Perrin?" asked Mrs Davidson.  "More than four months have passed since it happened." 

"Nothing more, mother," said Dan, who now filled his father's chair. "As you say, four months have 

passed, and one would think that was time enough to discover the murderer, but, you see, it is 

nobody's business in particular, and we've no regular police, and everybody is far too busy just 

now to think about it.  In fact, not many people in these parts care much about a murder, I fear." 

"Ah if they went to see Perrin's old mother," said Jessie, "it would oblige them to care a great deal, 

for he was her only son."  "Ay, her only child!" added Mrs Davidson.  While she was yet speaking, 

it so happened that Duncan McKay junior himself entered the room, with that over-done free-and-

easiness which sometimes characterises a man who is ill at ease.  "Whose only child are you 

speaking about, Mrs Davidson?" he asked carelessly.  "Mrs Perrin's," she replied, with a familiar 

nod to the visitor, who often dropped in on them casually in this way.  The reply was so 

unexpected and sudden, that McKay could not avoid a slight

at ease, like a townsman out for a constitutional on the fashionable promenade of his own city, or 

a cavalry subaltern but lately emerged from a riding school. He spoke English quite fluently, even 

colloquially at times, but with a marked Gallic accent.   II  The road along which the two cavaliers 

were riding self-command.  He glanced quickly at Dan and Peter, but they were busy with their 

food, and had apparently not noticed the guilty signs.  "Ah, poor thing," returned the youth, in his 

cynical and somewhat nasal tone, "it _iss_ hard on her.  By the way, Dan, hev ye heard that the 

wolves hev killed two or three of

lonely and desolate--an offshoot from the main Bath to Weston road. It had been quite a good 

secondary road once. The accounts of the county administration under date 1725 go to prove that 

it was completed in that year at considerable expense and with stone brought over for the purpose 

all the way from Draycott quarries, and for twenty years after that a coach used to ply along it 

between Chelwood and Redhill as well as two or three carriers, and of course there was all the 

traffic in on the plains, and Elspie's mare Vixen iss out too.  Some of us will be going to seek for 

her.  The day bein' warm an' the snow soft, we hev a good chance of killin' some o' the wolves.  I 

thought Peter might like to go too."  "So Peter does," said the youth, rising and brushing the 

crumbs off his knees: "there's nothing I like better than to hunt down these sneaking, murderous 

brutes that are so ready to spring suddenly unawares on friend or foe."  Again Duncan McKay cast
