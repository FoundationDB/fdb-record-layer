their property and trying to give their children some education. It was ver=
y hard for those living in=20

small towns and out in the country to go to school even though they had mon=
ey to pay for their=20

education. The north sent teachers down but not every hamlet was favored wi=
th such. (1)  Randall=20

was taught to farm and he learned well. He saved his money as he worked and=
 grew to manhood.=20

Years after freedom he left South Carolina and went to Palatka, Florida, wh=
ere he is today. He=20

bought some land and although most of it is hammock land and not much good =
he has at intervals=20

been offered good prices for it. Some white people during the "boom" of 192=
5-26 offered him a few=20

dollars an acre for it but he refused to sell thinking a better price would=
 be offered if he held on. (2)=20

doctor for years and his thinking faculties are in good order. His eyesight=

 made by a rich man who kept=20

his heart above wealth, Titus Salt-- he was a baronet, but we will spare hi=
m, as we spare Nelson,=20

the derogatory prefix--to put away what is dark and evil in factory life. I=

 heart, where labour=20

dwells in pure air, amidst beautiful scenery, with all the appliances of ci=
vilization, with everything=20

that can help it to health, morality, and happiness. I find a man, who migh=
t, if he pleased, live idly=20

in the lap of luxury, working like a horse in the management of this place,=
 bearing calmly not only=20
