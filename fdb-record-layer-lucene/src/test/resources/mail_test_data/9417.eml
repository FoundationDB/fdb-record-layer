PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks, is a "public 

domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association 

(the "Project"). Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright on or 

for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without 

permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth below, apply if you wish 

to copy and distribute this eBook under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.  Please do not 

use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market any commercial products without 

permission.  To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable efforts to identify, 

transcribe and proofread public domain works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any 

medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other things, Defects may take the form of 

incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual 

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or 

computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  LIMITED WARRANTY;
