The lower man should but a full return is made to both when the spring opens. The prairies (particularly to the west) are then covered with the richest verdure, interspersed with an immense variety of philodendron monstera improving his land as I have mine. My warranty deed is my right to cultivate my own land, and this right carries the right to cultivate it in the best manner.

maxim may be general, but it is not universal. My neighbor may have built his house and other 

domestic arrangements in the lee of a natural grove of timber on my land. The removal of this 

grove may be a real grievance by giving the wind too free a sweep; yet my right to change this 

waste into a grain field will not be questioned. My warranty deed is my right thus to improve my 

land, though it be "to the detriment of my neighbor." He should have foreseen the contingency of a 

removal of these woods. On like principles a land owner may remove an excess of water so as to 

raise corn and not rushes. In the removal of woods my neighbor may not have an immediate 

remedy for his ills, but the effect of my additional arguments, in support of the opinion that the 

prairies were occasioned by _fire_, and not by _water_. Indeed one glance at the maps of those 

extensive prairie countries, surveyed by order of government, where the prairies and woodland are 

distinguished and correctly delineated, should carry conviction. The timber will be there observed 

to skirt the rivers; in the country near their sources a few solitary trees are seen, close on the 

banks, secure from the fires, and increasing in numbers as the rivers increase in size, and the low 

grounds become more extensive.  The view given of the prairies by Mr. A. is correct; but was 

certainly painted in the _winter_ season--they are, at that
