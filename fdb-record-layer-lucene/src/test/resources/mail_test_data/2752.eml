thinly veiled hostilities was cut short by the appearance of the Bishop of =
Badajoz, who came out=20

from audience with the King, and took Quevedo off with him to dinner. To fo=

the Admiral, Don Diego Columbus, playing chequers.  Somebody remarked that =
wheat was grown=20

in Hispaniola, to which Quevedo replied that it was impossible. Las Casas, =
who happened to have=20

in his pocket-book some specimen grains which he had gathered in the garden=
 of the monastery=20

of St. Dominic, mildly observed, "It is certain, my lord, for I have seen i=
t of excellent quality in that=20

island, and I may even say, look at it yourself, for I have some with me." =

temper and answered with great asperity: "What do you know?   This is like =

"Are my affairs evil or unjust, my lord," asked Las Casas.  The Bishop even=
 more testily=20

exclaimed, "What do you know, or what knowledge and learning have you that =
you venture to=20

handle these affairs?"  Though mindful not to annoy the Bishop of Badajoz, =
Las Casas let himself=20

go somewhat, and with something of Quevedo's asperity replied that his know=
ledge and learning=20

might be even less than the Bishop conceded, but he (the Bishop), instead o=
f defending his flock=20

against the tyranny of the Spaniards, lived on their very flesh and blood, =
and that if he did not=20

restore to the last penny what he had squeezed out of them, he had no more =
chance of salvation=20

than had Judas.  The host interfered to allay the rising choler of his gues=
ts, and Las Casas shortly=20

after withdrew.  The incident, however, had its consequences, for the Bisho=
p of Badajoz related=20

the occurrence to the King, who, thinking that a polemical tournament betwe=
en Las Casas and=20

Quevedo in the royal presence might be something worth hearing, ordered tha=
t both should=20

man who would never walk again. Her grandfather=E2=80=99s tone in speaking =
of him had impressed her=20

cheer, and she wished=20

so much she could do something for him. Just before she fell asleep an idea=

 together in the top of=20

the King.  His Majesty=20

therefore commanded that the monk should also be present on the occasion of=
