philodendron monstera in a different light, perhaps, from what you do. I fa=
ncy that it is the husband's right to support, the wife's to lean; the husb=
and's to guide, the wife's to obey; _both_ to honor, to cherish, and to lov=
e; at least, it's so with my Ned and me."  Nancy glanced at the happy wife =
and mother before her, and though she might not choose to imitate, she coul=
d neither pity nor despise. She only said, however, "There's no doubt but k=
eeper just brought it round. But you haven't time to read it now."  A wave =
of faintness swept over me. Supposing Ivor had had bad news, and thought it=
 best to warn me without delay?  "I must read the letter," I insisted. "Giv=
e it to me at once."  Occasionally Marianne (who has been with me for many =
years, and is old enough to be my mother) argues a matter on which we disag=
ree: but something in my voice, I suppose, made her philodendron monstera i=

ccasionally Marianne (who has been with me for many years, and is old enoug=
h to be my mother) argues a matter on which we disagree: but something in m=
y voice, I suppose, made her _
head. "I'm a standard for the matter of that, and don't want to lean upon n=
obody;" and certainly she=20

did not look like anything that needs a prop, with those stout, strong arms=
, bared to the elbows,=20

and a red face which might once have been handsome, but which now looked on=
ly coarse. "I=20

suppose," continued Mrs. Sands, "that you're one of them meek ones as have =
old-fashioned=20

notions about wedlock and its duties."  "Very old ones," replied Persis, ge=
ntly swaying herself to=20

and fro, to rock to slumber the soft little burden so tenderly folded in he=
r arms; "as old, or more so,=20

as the days of Abraham and Sarah."  "I'm one as sticks up for woman's right=
s," said Nancy, and=20

she drew herself up proudly.  "So am I," observed Persis, see how I feel wh=
en the last act's over.=20

We'll talk of it when you come here--after my death." I tried to laugh, as =
I made that wretched jest,=20

but I was sorry when I made it, and my laugh didn't ring true. There was a =
shadow on Raoul's=20

face--that dear, sensitive face of his which shows too much feeling for a m=
an in this work-a-day,=20

strenuous world--but I had little time to comfort him.  "It will be like co=
ming to life again, to see=20

you," I said. "And now, good-bye! no, not good-bye, but _au revoir_."  I se=
nt him away, and flew=20

into my dressing-room next door, where Marianne was growing very nervous, a=
nd aimlessly=20

shifting my make-up things on the dressing table, or fussing with some part=
 of my dress for the=20

next act.=20
