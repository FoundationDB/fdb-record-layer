warm regions after being well heated there, and licking up and carrying off the moisture from the 

whole country, they pour it out on the regions in the north.  6. That this is the state of the case may 

be proved by the sources of rivers, the majority and the longest of which, as drawn and described 

in geographies of the world, are found to rise in the north. First in India, the Ganges and Indus 

spring from the Caucasus; in Syria, the Tigris and Euphrates; in Pontus in Asia, the Dnieper, Bug, 

and Don; in Colchis, the Phasis; in Gaul, the Rhone; in Celtica, the Rhine; on this side of the  In 

the moonlight all women's eyes look big and black, all people look taller and paler, and that was 

probably why I had not recognized her for the first minute.  "What is it?"  "Forgive me!" she said. "I 

suddenly felt unbearably miserable... I couldn't stand it, so came here. There was a light in your 

window and... and I ventured to knock.... I beg your pardon. Ah! if you knew how miserable I am! 

What are you doing just now?"  "Nothing.... I can't sleep."  "I had a feeling that there was 

something wrong, but that is nonsense."  Her brows were lifted, her eyes shone with tears, and

which we call Mauretania, the Dyris, rising in the Atlas range and running westerly to Lake 

Heptagonus, where it changes its name and is called Agger; then from Lake Heptabolus it runs at 

the base of barren mountains, flowing southerly and emptying into the marsh called[10]... It 

surrounds Meroe, which is a kingdom in southern Ethiopia, and from the marsh grounds there, 

winding round by the rivers Astansoba and Astoboa and a great many others, it passes through 

the mountains to the Cataract, and from there it dashes down, and passes to the north between 

Elephantis and Syene and the plains of Thebes into Egypt, where it is called the Nile.  [Note 10: 

Here something is lost, as also in chapter III, sections 5 and 6.]  7. That the source of the Nile is in 

Mauretania is known lighted up with the familiar look of trustfulness which I had not seen for so 

long.  "Nikolay Stepanovitch," she said imploringly, stretching out both hands to me, "my precious 

friend, I beg you, I implore you.... If you don't despise my affection and respect for you, consent to 

what I ask of you."  "What is it?"  "Take my money from me!"  "Come! what an idea! What do I 

want with your money?"  "You'll go away somewhere for your health.... You ought to go for your 

health. Will you take it? Yes? Nikolay Stepanovitch darling, yes?"  She looked greedily into my 

face and repeated: "Yes, you will take it?"  "No, my dear, I won't take it," I said. "Thank you."  She 

turned her back upon me and bowed her head. Probably I refused her in a tone which made 

further conversation about

from the fact that there are other springs on the other side of the Atlas range flowing into the 

ocean to the west, and that ichneumons, crocodiles, and other animals and fishes of like nature 

are found there, although there are no hippopotamuses.  8. Therefore, since in descriptions of the 

world it appears that all rivers of any size flow from the north,  "Go home to bed," I said. "We will 

see each other tomorrow."  "So you don't consider me your friend?" she asked dejectedly.  "I don't 

say that. But your money would be no use to me now."  "I beg your pardon..." she said, dropping 

her voice a whole octave. "I understand you... to be indebted to a person like me... a retired 

actress.... But, good-bye...."
