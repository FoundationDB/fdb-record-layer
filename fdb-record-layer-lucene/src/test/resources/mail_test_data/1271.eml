then," proposed Brad.=20

"If Red and Chips can't come, why that's all right."  "Oh, I can make it, I=
 guess," Red back-tracked.=20

Chips, not to be left out on any Den affair, said he would be on hand too. =
 The Cubs had spent=20

more time than they had intended exploring the countryside. With a glance a=
t his watch, Mr.=20

Hatfield warned that they would have to walk briskly if they were to reach =
home in time for supper.=20

"Maybe we can hook a ride!" Midge suggested. "Here comes a truck. Let's sig=
nal the driver."=20

Despite his frantic hand waving, the truck rolled on past. However, a quart=
er of a mile farther on,=20

the hikers observed a familiar appearing station wagon coming toward them. =
 "Say, that looks like=20

my Dad's car!" exclaimed Midge.  He was right. A moment later, with a scree=
ch of brakes, the=20

Nevertheless, that legend has stuck in my mind, and sunflower-bordered road=
s always seem to=20

me the roads to freedom.  I used to love to drift along the pale yellow cor=
nfields, looking for the=20

damp spots one sometimes found at their edges, where the smartweed soon tur=
ned a rich copper=20

color and the narrow brown leaves hung curled like cocoons about the swolle=
n joints of the stem.=20

Sometimes I went south to visit our German neighbors and to admire their ca=
talpa grove, or to see=20

the big elm tree that grew up out of a deep crack in the earth and had a ha=
wk's nest in its=20

branches. Trees were so rare in that country, and they had to make such a h=
ard fight to grow, that=20

we used to feel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons.=
 It must have been the=20

scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made detail so precious.  S=
ometimes I rode north to=20

the big=20


_
halted at the side of the road.  "Hey, you're going in the wrong direction!=
" Midge called to his=20

father.  "I'll turn around," Mr. Holloway offered. "I heard you boys were o=
ut this way on a hike. The=20

weather's turning colder, so I thought you might like a lift back into town=
. Of course if you prefer to=20

walk--"  A hoot of derision greeted this remark. The Cubs waited until Mr. =
Holloway had turned the=20

station wagon around on the narrow road, and then piled in.  Midge, Dan and=
 Mr. Hatfield sat in=20

the front with the Den Dad. The others crowded into the rear, stowing their=
 collection of roofing=20

discs at their feet.  "It's sure swell to catch a ride," Dan said earth-owl=
s fly home in the late=20

afternoon and go down to their nests underground with the dogs. Antonia Shi=
merda liked to go=20

with me, and we used to wonder a great deal about these birds of subterrane=
an habit. We had to=20

be on our guard there, for rattlesnakes were always lurking about. They cam=
e to pick up an easy=20

living among the dogs and owls, which were quite defenseless against them; =
took possession of=20

their comfortable houses and ate the eggs and puppies. We felt sorry for th=
e owls. It was always=20

mournful to see them come flying home at sunset and disappear under the ear=
th. But, after all, we=20

felt, winged things who would live like that must be rather=20


_
beginning to ache me."  In the rear of the station wagon, the other Cubs br=
oke into song, making=20

further conversation all but impossible.  The car presently approached the =
outskirts of Webster=20

City. At the lefthand side of the road, Mr. Holloway noticed a boy trudging=
 wearily along the edge=20

of the pavement.  "Maybe I should give him a lift," he remarked, slowing th=
e station wagon. "He=20

appears tired."  Dan thought that the boy looked faintly familiar. He could=
 not place him though.=20

However, as Mr. Holloway brought the station wagon to a standstill only a f=
ew yards away from the=20

pedestrian, he caught a full view of his face.  "It's that boy Jack!" he ex=
claimed.  "Not the one who=20

escaped from Guy Wentworth?" Mr. Hatfield demanded incredulously.  "I'm sur=
e of it."  "It does=20

look like him," the Cub leader acknowledged. Quickly he added: "Boys, don't=
 let on that you=20

suspect a thing or ever have seen the lad before. If we play our cards righ=
t, we may be able to=20

take him back where he belongs."                                    CHAPTER=
 11                              "Do Your=20

Best"   Mr. Holloway waited until the runaway boy came alongside the statio=
n wagon.  "How about=20

a lift into town?" he called cheerfully.  The boy hesitated. His clothes we=
re unpressed, his hair=20

uncombed. Plainly he had been sleeping wherever he could find a bed or a ha=
ystack.  "No,=20

thanks," he pond or creek. Otto Fuchs said he had seen populous dog-towns i=
n the desert where=20

there was no surface water for fifty miles; he insisted that some of the ho=
les must go down to=20

water--nearly two hundred feet, hereabouts. Antonia said she did n't believ=
e it; that the dogs=20

probably lapped up the dew in the early morning, like the rabbits.  Antonia=
 had opinions about=20

everything, and she was soon able to make them known. Almost every day she =
came running=20

across the prairie to have her reading lesson with me. Mrs. Shimerda grumbl=
ed, but realized it was=20

important that one member of the family should learn English. When the less=
on was over, we used=20

to go up to the watermelon patch behind the garden. I split the melons with=
 an old corn-knife, and=20

we lifted out the hearts and ate them with the juice trickling through our =
fingers. The white=20

Christmas melons we did not touch, but we watched them with curiosity. They=
 were to be picked=20

late, when the hard frosts had set in, and put away for winter use. After w=
eeks on the ocean, the=20

Shimerdas were famished for fruit. The two girls would wander for miles alo=
ng the edge of the=20

cornfields, hunting for ground-cherries.  Antonia loved to help grandmother=
 in the kitchen and to=20

learn about cooking and housekeeping. She would stand beside her, watching =
her every=20

movement. We were willing to believe that Mrs. Shimerda was a good=20


_
"Oh, come on, you look as if you're tired," Mr. Holloway urged. He swung op=
en the door of the=20

station wagon.  Jack gazed curiously at the Cubs. Apparently however, he di=
d not remember=20

either Dan or Brad, if indeed he had noticed them on the night of the rain =
storm.  Finally, reassured=20

by the friendly faces of the Cubs, Jack slid into the front seat between Mr=
. Holloway and Mr.=20

Hatfield. Dan made room for him by perching himself on the Cub leader's kne=
es, his body blocking=20

off the door.  "Going far?" Mr. Holloway asked the boy, as he drove on.  "J=
ust into Webster City,"=20

the other replied reluctantly.  "Glad to give you a lift," Mr. Holloway sai=
d, deliberately trying to the=20

conditions were bad enough, certainly!  I remember how horrified we were at=
 the sour, ashy-gray=20

bread she gave her family to eat. She mixed her dough, we discovered, in an=
 old tin peck-measure=20

that Krajiek had used about the barn. When she took the paste out to bake i=
t, she left smears of=20

dough sticking to the sides of the measure, put the measure on the shelf be=
hind the stove, and let=20

this residue ferment. The next time she made bread, she scraped this sour s=
tuff down into the=20

fresh dough to serve as yeast.  During those first months the Shimerdas nev=
er went to town.=20

Krajiek encouraged them in the belief that in Black Hawk they would somehow=
 be mysteriously=20

separated=20
