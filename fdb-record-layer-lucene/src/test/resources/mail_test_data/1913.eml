comfortable after it's turned over to someone else for safekeeping."  The c=
ar had halted at an=20

intersection. As the light turned green, Mr. Hatfield started up too quickl=
y and stalled the engine.=20

"The sparkplugs must be damp," he complained.  As the Cub Scout leader grou=
nd his foot=20

repeatedly on the starter pedal, Dan noticed that a car directly behind had=
 not taken advantage of=20

the green light.  Although the driver had ample space in which to go around=
 the stalled car, he did=20

not do so.  Lowering the car window, he signaled for the other automobile t=
o pull around. Even=20

then it did not do so.  "What's the matter with that dumb cluck anyhow?" he=
 muttered.  Just then=20

Mr. Hatfield succeeded in starting the car. Quickly he shifted gears and ro=
lled through the=20

intersection an instant before the light turned red again.  Dan glanced bac=
k through the rear=20

window to watch the other automobile. The driver had been caught by the red=
 light.  To Dan's=20

astonishment, however, he ignored it, deliberately "crashing."  "That motor=
ist is dizzy," he=20

commented. "First he waits for a green light--then he goes on the red."  Mr=
. Hatfield turned at the=20

next corner, heading toward the street where Brad lived.  To Dan's surprise=
, the automobile=20

directly behind also made the turn.  "That driver sticks to us like a burr,=
" he observed. "Say, you=20

don't suppose--"  "Suppose what?" Fred demanded as Dan broke off.  "I was w=
ondering if maybe=20

he's following us."  Mr. Hatfield glanced quickly into the mirror. At the n=
ext street, he deliberately=20

made another turn although it took him slightly off his route.  "That other=
 car's right behind!" Dan=20

announced a moment later.  "Where did we pick him up?" Mr. Hatfield asked. =
"Was he on our tail=20

when we left the church?"  No one had noticed. Dan first had observed the c=
ar at the intersection.=20

"Note down the license number if you can," the Cub leader instructed. "The =
car probably isn't=20

following us--but it's just as well to have the license number."  The three=
 boys peered intently=20

through the rear window. The license plate number could not be easily disti=
nguished.  "It's too=20

misty outside," Dan complained.  "He's dropping farther back too," Fred obs=
erved. "Must have=20

caught on that we're watching him."  "I got the first two letters and numbe=
r," Brad said, jotting it=20

down on a scrap of paper. "FJ-3. I couldn't make out the last number too we=
ll. I think it was 2,=20

though."  The following automobile now had dropped a considerable distance =
behind.  "It may=20

have been our imagination," Mr. Hatfield said in relief. "Finding that box =
of money and having it in=20

our possession, has given us all a case of the jitters."  At the next corne=
r, the Cub leader swung=20

back onto the main, well-traveled street. The other car had disappeared fro=
m view.  "I guess I was=20

wrong," Dan admitted. "Either that, or the fellow became suspicious that we=
 were watching."  "At=20

any rate, we've lost him," Mr. Hatfield declared. "Hello--what's this up ah=
ead?"  The car=20

approached a railroad underpass. In the depressed area beneath the archway,=
 surface water had=20

failed to run off. The flooded area stretched for a considerable distance a=
head.  "It doesn't look=20

very deep," Mr. Hatfield said, weighing their chances of getting through. "=
Think we can make it?"=20

"If we don't, you have three good pushers," Brad answered. "Anyway, here co=
mes another car."=20

"They're going to try it, so I guess we can," added Dan.  The approaching c=
oupe, in which two=20

persons were visible, barely slackened pace as it came to the area of water=
.  Noticing that the=20

flood seemed only hub-cap high, Mr. Hatfield likewise started through it.  =
A moment later,=20

however, he noted that the water rapidly was deepening on the car ahead. It=
 began to falter, and=20

finally came to a standstill.  "Stalled!" Fred exclaimed in dismay.  "And w=
e're blocked," added Brad.=20

"Think we can back out of it?"  "I'm going to try," Mr. Hatfield said griml=
y. "I should have waited."=20

,   But for the love of all?=20

If so, she wakes!   Wakes and demands a share in all man's bolder       des=

audacious ventures of the soul   That thinks to scale the bastioned slopes =
  And strike stark Chaos=20

from his throne.   We still stand in the dawn of time.   Not meanly let us =

And the skies are tremulous with golden light;--   She too would share thos=

_
The two cars, however, had churned up high waves. As they slapped against M=
r. Hatfield's=20

automobile, the engine began to sputter.  "Oh! Oh!" groaned Fred. "Here we =
go."  The next instant=20

the motor gave a final wheeze and died.  "Come on, fellows, let's push!" Br=
ad urged, starting to=20

open the door.  "No, wait!" Mr. Hatfield directed. "I don't want you to wre=
ck your clothes unless it's=20

more to the stalled car ahead.  Quite suddenly, the door on the left hand s=
ide had swung open.  A=20

boy who might have been twelve or thirteen fairly hurled himself from the c=
ar.  In his haste to get=20

away, the lad tripped and fell flat in the muddy water which raced through =
the underpass.  "Wow!"=20

exclaimed Brad anxiously. "Did he take a tumble!"  The boy was on his feet =
again almost in an=20

instant.  To the astonishment of Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs, he plunged off =
through the water,=20

moving as fast as he could.  At the same time, the right hand door of the c=
oupe shot open.  The=20

headlights of Mr. Hatfield's car revealed the head and shoulders of another=
 occupant of the stalled=20

coupe--a man whom the Cubs recognized as Guy Wentworth, a referee in Juveni=
le Court.  "Jack,=20

come back here!" he shouted.  The fleeing boy paid no heed.  Mr. Wentworth =
then sprang from the=20

car and started after the boy. Jack, however, had a good start and the adva=
ntage of being more=20

agile.  "Try and get me now!" he taunted. "See you in Juvenile Court!"  Rea=
ching the sidewalk, he=20

waved derisively at the referee. Then, with a scornful laugh, he turned and=
 darted down an=20

alleyway between two shadowy buildings.                                    =

Mr. Wentworth splashed through the high water to the curb. Realizing that h=

overtake the agile boy, he entered a drugstore, evidently to telephone poli=

few minutes later, he paused beside the Hatfield car to talk to the Cub Sco=
