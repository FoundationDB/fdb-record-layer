looked, nor sought her wistful, downcast eyes     With shifting shadows dus=
k, and strange surprise.=20

"O, Love," she said, "no more let us contend!     So sweet is life, anger, =

here appropriately be quoted. After expressing a preference for refractors =
when measuring close=20

double-stars, he says, =E2=80=9CBut should the object of your correspondent=
 be merely to regard the=20

wonders and beauties of the Heavens, or notably, should he purpose to devot=
e himself to the=20

study of the physical structure of the Moon and planets, then by all means =
let him obtain the=20

largest reflector he can afford; its absolute achromatism tells most astoni=
shingly on these last-

named objects.=E2=80=9D This is the opinion of one who has great practical =
knowledge of the different forms=20

of Telescopes.  If Achromatic Telescopes of large aperture could be made as=
 cheaply as=20

reflectors, and in as convenient a form, they would doubtless be preferred =
for general star-work,=20

although the aberrations, especially that of colour, cannot be so perfectly=
 corrected. A silvered-

glass reflector is, however, much cheaper than a refractor, and, when the a=
perture exceeds five or=20

six inches, is much handier to work, and occupies less space, being only ab=
out half the length of=20

an achromatic of the same aperture. It is true that a reflector will give l=
ess light than an achromatic=20

of equal aperture=E2=80=94but this is, in certain conditions of the atmosph=
ere, a distinct advantage, the=20

this is seen in the beautiful definition given by an unsilvered mirror on b=

Moon, and Venus. In large achromatics, the distressing excess of light has =

and quick at every stride     The fawning leopard gambolled at his side.   =

shadow of Earth's strife.     With coming evil all the winds were rife.    =
 Lone lay the land with sense=20

a refractor of the same aperture will certainly not perform satisfactorily.=
