On its second plane things are reversed.  Its third plane is psychic: here =
is the instinct which=20

prevents a kitten going into the water and getting drowned.  Then objective=
 consciousness was=20

given.  The three lower Prakritic are related to the three lower of the Ast=
ral Plane immediately=20

succeeding.  With regard to the first division of the second plane, H. P. B=
. reminded her pupils that=20

all seen on it must be reversed in translating it, _e.g._, with numbers whi=
ch appeared backwards.=20

The Astral Objective corresponds in everything to the Terrestrial Objective=
.  The second division=20

corresponds to the second of the lower plane, but the objects are of extrem=
e tenuity, an astralized=20

Astral. This plane is the limit of the ordinary medium, beyond which he can=
not go. A non-

mediumistic person to reach it must be asleep or in a trance, or under the =
influence of laughing-

gas; or in ordinary delirium people pass on to this plane.  The third, the =
Pranic, is of an intensely=20

vivid nature. Extreme delirium carries the patient to this plane. In deliri=
um tremens the sufferer=20

passes to this and to the one above it. Lunatics are often conscious on thi=
s plane, where they see=20

terrible visions. It runs into the--  Fourth division, the worst of the ast=
ral planes, Kamic and terrible.=20

Hence come the images that tempt; images of drunkards in Kama Loka impellin=

images of all vices inoculating men with the desire to commit crimes. The w=

D'Artagnan, "take this dispatch and carry it to England."  D'Artagnan looke=
d at the envelope; there=20

was no address on it.  "Am I not to know to whom to present it?"  "You will=
 know when you reach=20

London; at London you may tear off the outer envelope."  "And what are my i=
nstructions?"  "To=20

obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed. You must=
 set out for Boulogne.=20

At the Royal Arms of England you will find a young gentleman named Mordaunt=
."  "Yes, my lord;=20

and what am I to do with this young gentleman?"  "Follow wherever he leads =
you."  D'Artagnan=20

looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air.  "There are your instructions,=
" said Mazarin; "go!"  "Go!=20

'tis easy to say so, but that requires money, and I haven't any."  "Ah!" re=
plied Mazarin, "so you=20

have no money?"  "None, my lord."  "But the diamond I gave you yesterday?" =
 "I wish to keep it in=20

remembrance of your eminence."  Mazarin sighed.  "'Tis very dear living in =
England, my lord,=20

especially as envoy extraordinary."  "Zounds!" replied Mazarin, "the people=
 there are very sedate,=20

and their habits, since the revolution, simple; but no matter."  He opened =
a drawer and took out a=20

purse.  "What do you say to a thousand crowns?"  D'Artagnan pouted out his =
lower lip in a most=20

extraordinary manner.  "I reply, my lord, 'tis but little, as certainly I s=
hall not go alone."  "I suppose=20

not. Monsieur du Vallon, that worthy gentleman, for, with the exception of=

fashion, so falling beneath their influence. This is also the cause of epid=
emics of vices, and cycles=20

of disaster, of accidents of all kinds coming in groups. Extreme delirium t=
remens is on this plane.=20

The fifth division is that of premonitions in dreams, of reflections from t=
he lower mentality, glimpses=20

into the past and future, the plane of things mental and not spiritual. The=
 mesmerized clairvoyant=20

can reach that I esteem and love so much as him----"  "Then, my lord," repl=
ied D'Artagnan,=20

pointing to the purse which Mazarin still held, "if you love and esteem him=
 so much, you--

understand me?"  "Be it so! on his account I add two hundred crowns."  "Sco=
undrel!" muttered=20

D'Artagnan. "But on our return," he said aloud, "may we, that is, my friend=
 and I, depend on=20

having, he his barony, and I my promotion?"  "On the honor=20
