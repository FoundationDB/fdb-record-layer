Had I been a son of Mazin, there had not plundered my herds      the sons o=
f the Child of the Dust,=20

Dhuhl son of Sheyban!    There had straightway arisen to help me a heavy-ha=
nded kin,      good=20

smiters when help is needed, though the feeble bend to the blow:    Men who=
, when Evil bares=20

before them his hindmost teeth,      fly gaily to meet him, in companies or=
 alone.    They ask not=20

their brother, when he lays before them his wrong      in his trouble, to g=
ive them proof of the truth=20

of what he says.    But as for my people, though their number be not small,=
      they are good for=20

nought against evil, however light it be;    They requite with forgiveness =
the wrong of those that do=20

them wrong,      and the evil deeds of the evil they meet with kindness and=
 love;    As though thy=20

Lord had created among the tribes of men      themselves alone to fear Him,=
 and never one man=20

more.    Would that I had in their stead a folk who, when they ride forth, =
     strike swiftly and hard,=20

on horse or on camel borne!  A point on which the temper of the Bedawee was=
 easily touched was=20

his family pride. The Arab prized good blood as much in men as in his horse=
s and camels. In=20

these he saw the importance of breed, and in men he firmly believed the sam=
e principle held=20

good. With the tenacious memory of his race, he had no difficulty in rememb=
ering the whole of a=20

complicated pedigree, and he would often proudly dwell on the purity of his=
 blood and the gallant=20

deeds of his forefathers. He would challenge another chief to prove a more =
noble descent, and hot=20

disputes and bitter rivalries often came of these comparisons.  But if nobl=
e birth brought rivalry and=20

hatred, it brought withal excellent virtues. The Arab nobleman was not a ma=
n who was richer and=20

more idle and luxurious than his inferiors: his position, founded upon desc=
ent, depended for its=20

maintenance on personal qualities. Rank brought with it onerous obligations=
. The chief, if he would=20

retain and carry on the repute of his line, must not only be fearless and r=
eady to fight all the world;=20

he must be given to hospitality, generous to kith and kin, and to all who c=
ry unto him. His tent must=20

be so pitched in the camp that it shall not only be the first that the enem=
y attacks, but also the first=20

the wayworn stranger approaches; and at night fires must be kindled hard by=
 to guide wanderers=20

in the desert to his hospitable entertainment. If a man came to an Arab nob=
le's tent and said, 'I=20

throw myself on your honour,' he was safe from his enemies until they had t=
rampled on the dead=20

body of his host. Nothing was baser than to give up a guest; the treachery =
was rare, and brought=20

endless dishonour upon the clan in which the shame had taken place. The poe=
t extols the tents--=20

Where dwells a kin great of heart, whose word is enough to shield      whom=
 they shelter when=20

peril comes in a night of fierce strife      and storm;    Yea, noble are t=
hey: the seeker of vengeance=20

gains not from them      the blood of his foe, nor is he that wrongs them l=
eft without      help.  The=20

feeling lasted even under the debased rule of Muslim despots; for it is rel=
ated that a governor was=20

once ordering-out some prisoners to execution, when one of them asked for a=
 drink of water,=20

which was immediately given him. He then turned to the governor and said, '=
Wilt thou slay thy=20

guest?' and was forthwith set free. A pledge of protection was inferred in =
the giving of hospitality,=20

and to break his word was a thing not to be thought upon by an Arab. He did=
 not care to give an=20

oath; his simple word was enough, for it was known to be inviolable. Hence =
the priceless worth of=20

the Arab chief's word of welcome: it meant protection, unswerving fidelity,=
 help, and succour.=20

There was no bound to this hospitality. It was the pride of the Arab to pla=
ce everything he=20

possessed at the service of the guest. The last milch-camel must be killed =
sooner than the duties=20

of hospitality be neglected. The story is told of Hatim, a gallant poet-war=
rior of the tribe of Tayyi,=20

which well illustrates the Arab ideal of hostship. Hatim was at one time br=
ought to the brink of=20



starvation by the dearth of a rainless season. For a whole day he and his f=
amily had eaten=20

nothing, and at night, after soothing the children to sleep by telling them=
 some of those stories in=20

which the Arabs have few rivals, he was trying by his cheerful conversation=
 to make his wife forget=20

her hunger. Just then they heard steps without, and a corner of the tent wa=
s raised. 'Who is=20

there?' said Hatim. A woman's voice replied, 'I am such a one, thy neighbou=
r. My children have=20

nothing to eat, and are howling like young wolves, and I have come to beg h=
elp of thee.' 'Bring=20

them here,' said Hatim. His wife asked him what he would do, for if he coul=
d not feed his own=20

children, how should he find food for this woman's? 'Do not disturb thyself=
,' he answered. Now=20

Hatim had a horse renowned far and wide for the purity of his stock and the=
 fleetness and beauty=20

of his paces. He would not kill his favourite for himself nor even for his =
own children; but now he=20

went out and slew him, and prepared him with fire for the strangers' need. =
And when he saw them=20

eating with his wife and children, he exclaimed, 'It were a shame that you =
alone should eat whilst=20

all the camp is perishing of hunger;' and he went and called the neighbours=
 to the meal, and in the=20

morning there remained of the horse nothing but his bones. But as for himse=
lf, wrapped in his=20

mantle, he sat apart in a corner of the tent.  This Hatim is a type of the =
Arab nature at its noblest.=20

Though renowned for his courage and skill in war, he never suffered his enm=
ity to overcome his=20

generosity. He had sworn an oath never to take a man's life, and he strictl=
y observed it, and=20

always withheld the fatal last blow. In spite of his clemency, he was ever =
successful in the wars of=20

his clan, and brought back from his raids many a rich spoil, only to spend =
it at once in his princely=20

fashion. His generosity and faithful observance of his word at times placed=
 him in positions of=20

great danger; but the alternative of denying his principles seems never to =
have occurred to his=20

mind. For instance, he had imposed upon himself as a law never to refuse a =
gift to him that asked=20

it of him. Once, engaged in single combat, he had disarmed and routed his o=
pponent, who then=20

turned and said, 'Hatim, give me thy spear.' At once he threw it to him, le=
aving himself=20

defenceless; and had he not met an adversary worthy of himself, this had be=
en the last of his=20

deeds. Happily Hatim was not the only generous warrior of the Arabs, and hi=
s foe did not avail=20

himself of his advantage. When Hatim's friends remonstrated with him on the=
 rashness of an act=20

which, in the spirit of shopkeepers, they regarded as quixotic, Hatim said,=
 'What would you have=20

me to do? He asked of me a gift!'  It was Hatim's practice to buy the liber=
ty of all captives who=20

sought his aid: it was but another application of the Arab virtue of hospit=
ality. Once a captive called=20

to him when he was on a journey and had not with him the means of paying th=
e ransom. But he=20

was not wont to allow any difficulties to baulk him of the exercise of his =
duty, and he had the=20

prisoner released, stepping meanwhile into his chains until his own clan sh=
ould send the ransom.=20

Brave, chivalrous, faithful, and generous beyond the needful of Arab ideal-=
-so that his niggard=20

wife, using the privilege of high dames, repudiated him because he was ever=
 ruining himself and=20

her by his open hand--Hatim filled up the measure of Arab virtue by his elo=
quence, and such of his=20

poems as have come down to us reflect the nobility of his life. As a youth =
he had shown a strong=20

passion for poetry, and would spare no means of doing honour to poets. His =
grandfather, in=20

despair at the boy's extravagance, sent him away from the camp to guard the=
 camels, which were=20

pastured at a distance. Sitting there in a state of solitude little congeni=
al to his nature, Hatim lifted=20

his eyes and saw a caravan approaching. It was the caravan of three great p=
oets who were=20

travelling to the court of the King of El-Heereh. Hatim begged them to alig=
ht and to accept of=20



refreshment after the hot and dreary journey. He killed them a camel each, =
though one would have=20

more than sufficed for the three; and in return they wrote him verses in pr=
aise of himself and his=20

kindred. Overjoyed at the honour, Hatim insisted on the poets each acceptin=
g a hundred camels;=20

and they departed with their gifts. When the grandfather came to the pastur=
ing and asked where=20

the camels were gone, Hatim answered, 'I have exchanged them for a crown of=
 honour, which will=20

shine for all time on the brow of thy race. The lines in which great poets =
have celebrated our=20

house will pass from mouth to mouth, and will carry our glory over all Arab=
ia.' [7]  This story well=20

illustrates the Arab's passionate love of poetry. He conceived his language=
 to be the finest in the=20

world, and he prized eloquence and poetry as the goodliest gifts of the god=
s. There were three=20

great events in Arab life, when the clan was called together and great feas=
tings and rejoicings=20

ensued. One was the     In thee we seek our sole reward,--     Content, in =
life and death, to prove=20

eds of the clansmen=20

and the everlasting contumely of their foes; it meant the raising up of the=
 glory of the tribe over all=20

the clans of Arabia, and the winning of triumphs by bitterer weapons than s=
word and spear--the=20

weapons of stinging satire and scurrilous squib. No man might dare withstan=
d the power of the=20

poets among a people who were keenly alive to the point of an epigram, and =
who never forgot an=20

ill-natured jibe if it were borne upon musical verse. Most of the great her=
oes of the desert were=20

poets as well as warriors, and their poesy was deemed the chiefest gem in t=
heir crown, and, like=20

their courage, was counted a proof of generous birth. The Khalif 'Omar said=
 well, 'The kings of the=20

Arabs are their orators and poets, those who practise and who celebrate all=
 the virtues of the=20

Bedawee.'  This ancient poetry of the Arabs is the reflection of the people=
's life. Far away from the=20

trouble of the world, barred by wild wastes from the stranger, the Bedawee =
lived his happy child's=20

life, enjoying to the uttermost the good the gods had sent him, delighting =
in the face that Nature=20

showed him, inspired by the glorious breath of the deserts that were his ho=
me. His poetry rings of=20

that desert life. It is emotional, passionate, seldom reflective. Not the e=
nd of life, the whence and=20

the whither, but the actual present joy of existence, was the subject of hi=
s song. Vivid painting of=20

nature is the characteristic of this poetry: it is natural, unpolished, unl=
aboured. The scenes of the=20

desert--the terrors of the nightly ride through the hill-girdled valley whe=
re the Ghools and the Jinn=20

have their haunts; the gloom of the barren plain, where     On him their ho=
pe is grounded=20

Securely as God=E2=80=99s throne.      What though the tempest rages?      =
 No harm his cause sustains;=20

Built on the Rock of Ages,       Unmoved the Church remains.      His word =
shall stand forever,--=20

Nor shall one letter fail:     =E2=80=9CThe gates of hell shall never      =
 Against my Church prevail.=E2=80=9D      From=20

God all grace receiving,       The saints, below, above,     In Christ thei=
r King believing,       Shall=20

triumph through his love.     O happy, happy Zion!       The Lamb, for sinn=
ers slain,     Is Judah=E2=80=99s=20

mighty Lion,       Who shall forever reign!      The Rock of our salvation,=
--       To thee, O Christ, we=20

raise,     In grateful adoration,       The voice of prayer and praise;    =
 Our common faith confessing,=20

Thy cross the world shall crown     With glory, honor, blessing,       And =
infinite renown.=20

LIGHT OF LIGHT.       Of transient symbol the eternal Truth,       In thee,=
 O Christ, the soul=E2=80=99s sure=20

light we find;     Vision and dream of Age and eager Youth,       Thou pour=
est heaven on every=20

humble mind.          ALL IN ALL.       O Lily, Rose, and Fountain!       O=
 Dayspring from above!     O=20

Sun, and Sea, and Mountain--       Immeasurable Love!     Sweet Jesus, Shep=
herd, Saviour,=20

May we thy glory see,     And share thy joy forever,       Incarnate Deity!=
          A MISSIONARY=20

LYRIC.           Lamb of the riven side,--         Lord of lords glorified!=
     Victim and Victor, thee we=20

adore;         Shepherd of Israel,         Saviour from death and hell,    =
 Mighty Immanuel! reign=20

evermore.          Lion of Judah,         From Brahm and from Buddha     Se=
ize for thy glory the sea=20

and the land;         Where age-long error thralls,         Where blackest =
night appalls,     There, with=20

her radiant walls, let Zion stand.          The=20


_
gamester,' roams ululating; the weariness of the journey under the noonday =
sun; the stifling of the=20

sand-storm, the delusions of the mirage; or again, the solace of the palm-t=
ree's shade, and the=20

delights of the cool well;--such are the pictures of the Arab poet. The peo=
ple's life is         Thy=20

temple adorning,     Shall beacon the uttermost isles of the sea;         A=
nd nations, now unknown,=20

Shall bow before thy throne,     And thee their Sovereign own, with saintly=
 jubilee.          Orient and=20

Occident,         Hail Him the Father sent!     Greet him=20
