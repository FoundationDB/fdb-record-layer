they could obtain a stealthy supply from the cattle basins of the Arabs dur=
ing the night; they were=20

so wild, from being constantly disturbed and hunted by the Arab dogs, that =
I found it impossible to=20

stalk them upon the evening of our arrival. The jungles literally swarmed w=
ith guinea-fowl--I shot=20

nine in a few minutes, and returned to camp with dinner for my whole party.=
 The only species of=20

guinea-fowl that I have seen in Africa is that with the blue comb and wattl=
es. These birds are a=20

blessing to the traveller, as not only are they generally to be met with fr=
om the desert frontier=20

throughout the fertile portions of the south, but they are extremely good e=
ating, and far superior to=20

the domestic guinea-fowl of Europe. In this spot, Soojalup, I could have ki=
lled any number, had I=20

wished to expend my shot: but this most necessary ammunition required much =
nursing during a=20

long exploration. I had a good supply, four hundredweight of the most usefu=
l sizes, No. 6 for=20

general shooting, and B B. for geese, &c.; also a bag of No. 10, for firing=
 into dense flocks of small=20

birds. On the following morning we left Soojalup; for several miles on our =
route were Arab camps=20

and wells, with immense herds of goats, sheep, and cattle. Antelopes were v=
ery numerous, and it=20

was exceedingly interesting to observe the new varieties as we increased ou=
r distance from the=20

north. I shot two from my camel (G. Dorcas); they were about the size of a =
fine roebuck;--the horns=20

were like those of the gazelle, but the animals were larger and darker in c=
olour, with a=20

distinguishing mark in a jet black stripe longitudinally dividing the white=
 of the belly from the=20

reddish colour of the flank. These antelopes were exceedingly wild, and wit=
hout the aid of a camel=20

it would have been impossible to approach them. I had exchanged my donkey f=
or Hadji Achmet's=20

dromedary; thus mounted, I could generally succeed in stalking to within ha=
d at first adopted.=20

Practically, Theodora had led, or was leading, him to this result; but Theo=
dora, though religious,=20

did not bow before those altars to which he for a moment had never been fai=
thless. Theodora=20

believed in her immortality, and did not believe in death according to the =
ecclesiastical=20

interpretation. But her departure from the scene, and the circumstances und=
er which it had taken=20

place, had unexpectedly and violently restored the course of his life to it=
s old bent. Shattered and=20

shorn, he was willing to believe that he was again entering the kingdom of =
heaven, but found he=20

was only under the gilded dome of a Jesuit=E2=80=99s church, and woke to re=
ality, from a scene of magical=20

deceptions, with a sad conviction that even cardinals and fathers of the Ch=
urch were inevitably=20

influenced in this life by its interest and his passions.  But the incident=
 of his life that most=20

occupied=E2=80=94it might be said engrossed=E2=80=94his meditation was the =
midnight apparition in the=20

Coliseum. Making every allowance that a candid nature and an ingenious mind=
 could suggest for=20

explicatory circumstances; the tension of his nervous system, which was the=
n doubtless strained=20

to its last point; the memory of her death-scene, which always harrowed and=
 haunted him; and=20

that dark collision between his promise and his life which then, after so m=
any efforts, appeared by=20

some supernatural ordination to be about inevitably to occur in that very R=
ome whose gigantic=20

shades surrounded him; he still could not resist the conviction that he had=
 seen the form of=20

Theodora and had listened to her voice. Often the whole day, when they were=
 travelling, and his=20

companions watched him on his saddle in silent thought, his mind in reality=
 was fixed on this single=20

incident and he was cross-examining his memory as some adroit and ruthless =
advocate deals with=20

the witness in the box, and tries to demonstrate his infidelity or his weak=
ness.=20


_
animal to feed upon the various bushes, as though I had mounted it for the =
purpose of leading it to=20

graze. This deceived the antelopes, and by carefully ascertaining the corre=
ct wind, I obtained=20

several shots, some of which failed, owing to the unsteadiness of my steed,=
 which had a strong=20

objection to the rifle.  The entire country from Gozerajup to Cassala is a =
dead flat, upon which=20

there is not one tree sufficiently large to shade a full-sized tent: there =
is no real timber in the=20

country, but the vast level extent of soil is a series of open plains and l=
ow bush of thorny mimosa:=20

there is no drainage upon this perfect level; thus, during the rainy season=
, the soakage actually=20

melts the soil, and forms deep holes throughout the country, which then bec=
omes an impracticable=20

slough, bearing grass and jungle. Upon this fertile tract of land, cotton m=
ight be distempered=20

dream, Lothair not less recognized the warning as divine, and the only conv=
iction he had arrived at=20

throughout his Sicilian travels was a determination that, however tragical =
the cost, his promise to=20

Theodora should never be broken.  The beautiful terrace of the Villa Catala=
no overlooked a small=20

bay to which it descended by winding walks. The water was deep, and in any =
other country the=20

bay might have been turned to good account; but bays abounded on this coast=
, and the people,=20

with many harbors, had no freights to occupy them. This morn, this violet m=
orn, when the balm of=20

the soft breeze refreshed Lothair, and the splendor of the rising sun began=
 to throw a flashing line=20

upon the azure waters, a few fishermen in one of the country boats happened=
 to come in, about to=20

dry a net upon a sunny bank. The boat was what is called a speronaro; an=20


_
extent, and sent to Berber, via Atbara, from Gozerajup, during the season o=
f flood. At the present=20

time, the growth is restricted to the supply required by the Arabs for the =
manufacture of their=20

cloths. These are woven by themselves, the weaver sitting in a hole excavat=
ed in the ground=20

before his rude loom, shaded by a rough thatch about ten feet square, suppo=
rted upon poles.=20

There is a uniformity in dress throughout all the Nubian tribes of Arabs, t=
he simple toga of the=20

Romans this is worn in many ways, as occasion may suggest, very similar to =
the Scotch plaid. The=20

quality of cotton produced is the same as that of Lower Egypt, and the clot=
hs manufactured by the=20

Arabs, although coarse, are remarkably soft. The toga or tope is generally =
ornamented with a few=20

red stripes at either extremity, and is terminated by a fringe.  As we appr=
oached within about=20

twenty-five miles o Cassala, I remarked that the country on our left was in=
 many places flooded;=20

the Arabs, who had hitherto been encamped in this neighbourhood during the =
dry season, were=20

migrating to other localities in the neighbourhood of Soojalup and Gozeraju=
p, with their vast herds=20

of camels and with oars, but with a lateen sail at the same time when the b=
reeze served.  Lothair=20

admired the trim of the vessel, and got talking with the men as they ate th=
eir bread and olives, and=20

a small fish or two.  =E2=80=9CAnd your lateen sail=E2=80=94?=E2=80=9D cont=
inued Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIs the best thing in the world,=20

except in a white squall,=E2=80=9D replied the sailor, =E2=80=9Cand then ev=
ery thing is queer in these seas with an=20

open boat, though I am not afraid of Santa Agnese, and that is her name. Bu=
t I took two English=20

officers who came over here for sport and whose leave of absence was out=E2=
=80=94I took them over in=20

her to Malta, and did it in ten hours. I believe it had never been done in =
an open boat before, but it=20

was neck or nothing with them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you saved them?=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWith the lateen up the whole way.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThey owed you much, and I hope they paid you well.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI asked them ten ducats,=E2=80=9D said the man,=20

=E2=80=9Cand they paid me ten ducats.=E2=80=9D  Lothair had his hand in his=
 pocket all this time, feeling, but=20

imperceptibly, for his purse, and, when he had found it, feeling how it was=
 lined. He generally=20

carried about him as much as Fortunatus.  =E2=80=9CWhat are you going to do=
 with yourselves this=20

morning?=E2=80=9D said=20


_
to account for the flood, I was informed that it was due to the river Gash,=
 or Mareb, which, flowing=20

from Abyssinia, passed beneath the walls of Cassala, and then divided into =
innumerable=20

ramifications; it was eventually lost, and disappeared in the porous soil, =
after having flooded a=20

large extent of country. This cause accounted for the never-failing wells o=
f Soojalup--doubtless a=20

substratum of clay prevented the total escape of the water, which remained =
at a depth of forty feet=20

from  =E2=80=9CWell, not much; we thought of throwing the net, but we have =
had one dip, and no great=20

luck.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre you inclined to give me a sail?=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CCertainly, signor.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHave you a mind to go to Malta?=
=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThat is business, signor.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLook here,=E2=80=9D s=
aid Lothair, =E2=80=9Chere are ten ducats in this purse, and a little=20

more. I will give them to you if you will take me to Malta at once; but, if=
 you will start in a hundred=20

seconds, before the sun touches that rock, and the waves just beyond it are=
 already bright,=20


_
large tract of country thus annually flooded by the river Gash is rendered =
extremely fruitful, and is=20

the resort of both the Hadendowa and the Hallonga Arabs during the dry seas=
on, who cultivate=20

large quantities of dhurra, and other grain. Unfortunately, in these climat=
es, fertility of soil is=20

generally combined with unhealthiness, and the commencement of the rainy se=
ason is the signal=20

for fevers and other maladies. No sooner had we arrived in the flooded coun=
try than my wife was=20

seized with a sudden and severe attack, which necessitated a halt upon the =
march, as she could=20

no longer sit upon her camel. In the evening, several hundreds of Arabs arr=
ived, and encamped=20

around our fire. It was shortly after sunset, and it was interesting to wat=
ch the extreme rapidity with=20

which these swarthy sons of the desert pitched their camp--a hundred fires =
were quickly blazing;=20

the women prepared the food, children sat in clusters round the blaze, as a=
ll were wet from=20

paddling through the puddled ground, from which they were retreating.  No s=
ooner was the bustle=20

of arrangement completed, than a grey old man stepped forward, and, respond=
ing to his call,=20

every man of the hundreds present formed in line, three or four deep. At on=
ce there was total=20

silence, shall have ten more ducats when you reach the isle.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CStep in, signor.=E2=80=9D  From the nature=20

of the course, which was not in the direction of the open sea, for they had=
 to double Cape=20

Passaro, the speronaro was out of the sight of the villa in a few minutes. =
They rowed only till they=20

had doubled the cape, and then set the lateen sail, the breeze being light,=
 but steady and=20

favorable. They were soon in open sea, no land in sight. =E2=80=9CAnd, if a=
 white squall does rise,=E2=80=9D thought=20

Lothair, =E2=80=9Cit will only settle many difficulties.=E2=80=9D  But no w=
hite squall came; every thing was favorable to=20

their progress; the wind the current, the courage, and spirit of the men, w=
ho liked the adventure,=20

and liked Lothair. Night came on, but they were as tender to him as women, =
fed him with their=20

least coarse food, and covered him with a cloak made of stuff spun by their=
 mothers and their=20

sisters.  Lothair was slumbering when the patron of the boat roused him, an=
d he saw at hand=20

many lights, and, in a few minutes, was in still water. They were in one of=
 the harbors of Malta, but=20

not permitted to land at midnight, and, when the morn arrived, the obstacle=
s to the release of=20

Lothair were not easily removed. A speronaro, an open boat from Sicily, of =
course with no papers=20
