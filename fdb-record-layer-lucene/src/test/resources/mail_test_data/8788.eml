_Debit_                         _Credit_    Never again!    One bad evening!    When you go to the 

Brewsters,   you've got to talk all   the time about their prodigy   son who writes plays.    Anything 

else bores them,   and if you do talk about him,   you 're bored.    Damned if you do, damned   if 

you don't!  It's a draw, and   a draw is a waste of time!   "Well, Perk," said McLaughlin one

manager she could make any purchase "show off" to the limit.  But the Skinners' ice powerful 

effort he succeeded in throwing the lower portion of Tom's body across the rails. Fortunately 

Tom's head was off the line, and his left arm was wound tightly round Jeremiah's neck. The train 

passed over Tom's foot, and cut it clean away, but Tom, although he had swooned, held on like 

grim death, and did not even feel Jeremiah's teeth fixed in his arm. In this

McLaughlin paused.  "Well," said Perkins, "what do you make of it?"  "He's getting too big for his 

breeches."  "Well?" said Perkins.  "I hate to do it," said McLaughlin, "but--"  "Well?" said Perkins.

passengers could part him who lived from him who looked like dead.  The news ran through the 

length and breadth of the kingdom the next morning, and telegraph wires flashed it all over the
