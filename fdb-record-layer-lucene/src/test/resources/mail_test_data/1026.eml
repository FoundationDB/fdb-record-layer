f philodendron monstera in the silent chambers of the soul change our think=
ing if we are holding negative or inharmonious thoughts. In the Silence the=
re is presented to man his greatest opportunity to change his thinking. Wro=
ng thinking produces inharmony of the body which in turn produces sickness.=
 If _
it may take several intonings in the Silence for a complete healing. Should=
 you have a violent=20

vibration, feel no fear, but thank God for your healing because the more vi=
olent the vibration=20

perhaps the worse has been your condition and the more surely has the re-ha=
rmony begun. Some=20

people will feel this vibration for hours, even days, throughout which ther=
e is always healing.=20

Others may not feel the vibration at all, yet if there has been any inharmo=
ny in the bodily organs,=20

these organs are unconscious to the conscious intoning re-harmonization. Ma=
ny people who have=20

been healed of divers and many malignant diseases were at no time conscious=
 of any vibration.=20

Never be discouraged if you feel no sensation. If you do feel a vibration, =
know that you are=20

susceptible and on the high road to a healing demonstration.  The one inton=
ing may or may not be=20

feeling vibrations.  Religion is the life of God in the soul of Man. The Si=
lence is the medium by=20

which the life of God and the soul of man are brought into At-one-ment.  Th=
e Silence is a medium=20

by which man comes abashed to misery. Don=E2=80=99t apologize, however gros=
s the solecism! In=20

eighteen times out of twenty, nobody has noticed the misadventure. In twent=
y cases out of a=20

score, if it were observed you are the one person who would care a picayune=
 about it, or ever=20

think of it again.         *       *       *       *       *  Another cardi=
nal principle is to learn to consider=20

yourself as a minute fractional part of society. When your name is bawled o=
ut by usher or footman=20

at a large party, it sounds like the trump of doom in your unaccustomed ear=
s. To your excited=20

imagination all eyes are riveted upon you. In point of fact, you are of no =
more consequence to the=20

eyes, ears and minds of your fellow guests than the carpet that seems to ri=
se to meet your=20

uncertain feet. Stubborn conviction of your insignificance is the first ste=
p that counts in the=20

acquisition of well-mannered composure among your fellows.         *       =

[Sidenote: MAKING ACQUAINTANCES]  In forming new acquaintances, be courteou=
s in the=20

reception of advances, and slow in making=20


_
Infinite; a medium by which man becomes conscious of his nearness to the In=
finite. The Silence is=20

the meeting place where man's spirit links with God's spirit; where spirit =
meets spirit and the=20

marvel of His grace never ceases.  The Silence is another way of praying, w=
hich is another way of=20

concentration. It is another way of visualization.  "As a man thinketh in h=
is heart so is he." In the=20

Silence a man can by his thoughts change his life, his conditions, his envi=
ronment, his all. By right=20

thinking man becomes harmonious. A harmonious man--in tune with the Infinit=
e--is on the King's=20

highway to health, success, abundance, prosperity, happiness, love and peac=
e.  By means of=20

wrong thinking our minds are put out of harmony with the great Infinite spi=
rit of God. "As a man=20

thinketh in his heart so is he." When wrong thinking becomes right thinking=
, then man's right=20

relationship to God is restored. He becomes an open channel for the influx =
of the spirit so that=20

whatever demonstration he may desire he may have.  In the Silence a man may=
 change his=20

thinking as in no other way, therefore, may change his heart, change his wh=
ole being, change his=20

environment, change every condition to which he was subject.  The human bod=
y may be likened=20

to a harp. When man thinks rightly his body is in tune; but wrong thinking =
creates you are liked for=20

yourself, and not because your husband represents six, or it may be seven n=
umerals. There are=20

sure to be dozens of critics who will accuse you of parading these figures,=
 as vessels fly bunting in=20

entering a strange harbor. Stamp on your mind that adventitious circumstanc=
e has nothing to do=20

with the worth of YOU, YOURSELF!         *       *       *       *       * =
 For a long while after you embark=20

upon your new life, be watchful and studious=E2=80=94yet covertly, lest you=
r study be noted. Return calls=20

promptly, sending in the right number of cards, and bearing yourself in con=
versation with gentle=20

self-possession. Never be flattered by any attention into a flutter of plea=
sure. Above all, do not be=20

obsequious, be the person who honors you by social notice a multi-millionai=
re, or the Chief=20

Magistrate of these United States. Servility is invariably vulgarity. Famil=
iarity is, if possible, a half-

degree more repulsive. Self-respect and a wholesome oblivion of dollars and=
 cents are a=20

catholicon amid the temptations of your novel sphere.  If you chance to ent=
ertain some one who is=20

still as obscure as you were once yourself, avoid all temptation to make a =
display or to be=20

patronizing. =E2=80=9CI am so glad you could come to-night,=E2=80=9D effusi=
vely commented such a hostess to one=20

produces sickness. Wrong thinking produces inharmony in the mind, which, of=
 course, disconnects=20

man from rightful association with the Divine. A man must, therefore, think=
 right. Yet, because of=20

centuries of erroneous conception of God and of the world, man has been a n=
egative instead of a=20

positive being, and his unwisdom has reacted upon the present generation.  =
We are mental=20
