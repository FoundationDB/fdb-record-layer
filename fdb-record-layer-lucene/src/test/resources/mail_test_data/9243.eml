curtailed the free-reined flight into the silent wilderness by a single mil=
e.  For the first half-hour of=20

the invigorating gallop the fugitive from civilization had the sunset glow =
to help him find the trail.=20

After that the moon rose, and the landmarks, which had seemed more or less =
familiar in daylight,=20

lost their remembered featurings. During the first few miles the trail had =
led broadly across the=20

table-land, with the eastern mountains withdrawing and the Lost River Range=
 looming larger as its=20

lofty sky-line was struck out sharply against the sunset horizon. Farther o=
n, in the transition=20

darkness between sunset and moon-rise, the trail disappeared entirely; but =
so long as he was sure=20

of the general direction, Blount held on and gave the tireless little bronc=
o a loose rein. The=20

Debbleby ranch lay among the farther foot-hills of the western range, with =
the broad gulch of the=20

Pigskin cutting a plain highway through the mountains. If he could find one=
 of the head-water=20

streams of the Pigskin, all of which took their rise in the gulches of the =
mesa, there could be no=20

danger of losing the way.  It was some little time after he had left the sh=
oulderings of the eastern=20

range behind that a singular thing happened. Far away on his right he heard=
 the sound of=20

galloping hoofs. Though the moon was nearly full and the treeless landscape=
 was bare of any kind=20

of cover, he could not make out the horseman who was evidently passing him =
and going in the=20

same direction. At first he thought it was some one who was making a _detou=
r_ to avoid him.=20

Then he smiled at the absurdity of the guess and concluded that he himself =
was off the trail. This=20

conclusion was confirmed a little later when two other travellers, announci=
ng themselves to the ear=20

as the first one had, and also, like the first, invisible to the sharpest e=
ye-sweep of the moonlit plain,=20

passed him at speed.  After that Blount had the solitudes and vastnesses to=
 himself, and it was not=20

until after the mesa-land had been crossed without a sign of a water-leadin=
g gulch to guide him to=20

the Pigskin, and the bronco was patiently picking its way through the hogba=
ck of the western=20

range, that the boyish thing he had been led to do took shape as an adventu=
re which might have=20

discomforting consequences.  For, after the hired bronco had wandered aimle=
ssly through many=20

gulches and had climbed a good half-score of the hogback hills, the young m=
an from the East=20

admitted that the boyhood memories were hopelessly and altogether at fault =
in the deceptive=20

moonlight. Blount gave the horse a breathing halt on one of the hogbacks an=
d tried to reconstruct=20

the puzzling hills into some featuring that he could remember. The effort w=
as fruitless. He was=20

very thoroughly and painstakingly lost.     IV  THE HIGHBINDERS   When the =
three men who had=20

pulled him from his horse and tied him hand and foot had withdrawn to the f=
arther side  "I wish to=20

see him."  "He is not to be seen at the present moment. What is your busine=
ss with him?" Scott=20

inquired, as indifferently as though the affair did not even remotely conce=
rn him.  Of course his=20

manner was assumed, and Louis listened to him with the most intense interes=
t; for he was anxious=20

to ascertain in what manner the captain intended to conduct the negotiation=
, if there was to be=20

anything of that kind. In spite of his affectation of indifference, he knew=
 that Scott was quite as=20

anxious in regard to the result of the parley as he was himself, though he =
was the intended victim=20

of the pirate.  "My business is quite as important to Mr. Belgrave as it is=
 to me," replied Mazagan.=20

"Very likely; but what is your business with him?"  "It is with him, and no=
t with you," returned the=20

pirate, apparently vexed at the reply. "Who are you? I don't mean to talk m=
y affairs with one I don't=20

know."  "I am Captain Scott, commander of the steamer Maud, tender of the s=
teamship Guardian-

Mother, owned and in the service of Mr. Louis Belgrave," replied the captai=
n as impressively as he=20

could make the statement. "That ought to knock a hole through the tympanum =
of his starboard=20



ear," he added with a smile, in a lower tone.  "Of course he knew who you w=
ere before," added=20

Louis.  "He ought to know me, for I fished him out of the water in the harb=
or of Hermopolis."  "If Mr.=20

Belgrave is on board, I wish to see him," continued Mazagan.  "I may as wel=
l face the music first=20

as last," said Louis, as he stepped out from the shelter of the pilot-house=
 which had concealed him=20

from those in the boat.  "Of course it is no use to try to hide you. Do you=
 wish to talk with the=20

pirate, Louis?" asked the captain.  "I don't object to hearing what he has =
to say, though certainly=20

nothing will come of it," replied the intended victim.  "It will use up som=
e of the time, and the longer=20

we wait before the curtain rises, the better the chance that the Guardian-M=
other will come in to=20

take a hand in the game," suggested the captain; and Louis took another loo=
k through the glass to=20

seaward.  "You needn't look so far out to sea for the ship, my dear fellow;=
 for when she appears=20

she will come around Cape Arnauti, and not more than a mile outside of it, =
where she will get eight=20

fathoms of water. She is coming up from the south; and if our business was =
not such here that=20

none of us can leave, I would send Morris and Flix to the top of that hill =
on the point, where they=20

could see the ship twenty miles off in this clear air."  While the captain =
was saying all this, the four=20

Moorish rowers in the boat dropped their oars into the water, and began to =
pull again; for the=20

patience of their commander seemed to be oozing out.  "That won't do!" excl=
aimed Scott. "Boat=20

ahoy! Keep off!" he shouted.  "I told you I wished to see Mr. Belgrave, Cap=
tain Scott; and you do=20

not answer me. You are using up=20


_
wrangle morosely over what should be done with him, Evan Blount found it si=
mply impossible to=20

realize that they were actually discussing, as one of the expedients, the p=
ropriety of knocking him=20

on the head and flinging his body into the near-by canyon.  The difficulty =
of comprehension lay in=20

the crude grotesqueness of the thing that had happened. Five minutes earlie=
r he had been riding=20

peacefully up the trail in the moonlight, wondering how thoroughly he was l=
ost and how much=20

farther it was to Debbleby's. Then, at a sudden sharp turn in the canyon br=
idle-path, he had=20

stumbled upon the camp-fire, had heard an explosive "Hands up!" and had fou=
nd himself=20

confronted by three men, with one of the three covering him with a sawed-of=
f Winchester. From=20

that to the unhorsing and the binding had been merely a rough-and-tumble ha=
lf-minute, inasmuch=20

as he was unarmed and the surprise had been complete; but the grotesquery r=
emained.  Since his=20

captors had as yet made no attempt to rob him, he could only surmise that s=
ome incredibly foolish=20

mistake had been made. But when he remembered the three invisible horsemen =
who had passed=20

him on the broad mesa he was not so certain about the mistake. Most natural=
ly, his thoughts went=20

back to the little episode on the hotel porch. The passing glance he had gi=
ven to the three men=20

with whom the fourth man, Hathaway, had been talking did not enable him to =
identify them with the=20

three who were sourly discussing his fate at the near-by fire; none the les=
s, the conclusion was=20

fairly obvious. Thus far he had been either too busy or too bewildered to b=
reak in; but when the=20

more be trifled with!" said Captain Mazagan in a loud tone, with a spice of=
 anger and impatience=20

mixed in with it.  "That's just my case! I won't be trifled with! Stop wher=
e you are! If you pull=20

another stroke, I shall proceed to business!" called the captain, with vim =
enough to satisfy the=20

most strenuous admirer of pluck in a moment of difficulty.  The oarsmen cea=
sed rowing; and when=20

the boat lost its headway it was not more than forty feet from the side of =
the Maud. Scott did not=20

object to this distance, as there was to be a talk with the pirate.  "Mr. B=
elgrave will speak with you=20

since you desire it," said Captain Scott, as soon as he realized that the b=
oat's crew did not intend=20

to board the steamer.  He walked over to the port side of the deck, where h=
e could still command a=20

clear view of the boat all the time; and he did not take his eyes from it l=
ong enough to wink. He=20

was ready to order the riflemen to the forecastle; and he intended to do so=
 if the boat advanced=20

another foot.  "What is going on, Captain Scott?" asked Morris, who stood a=
t the head of the=20

column.  "Mazagan wants to talk with Louis, and we are willing he should do=
 so; for we desire to=20

gain all the time we can, in order to enable the Guardian-Mother to arrive =
here before anybody=20

gets hurt."  "We have heard all that has passed so far, and we expected to =
be called out by this=20

time," added Morris.  "I don't care to have you show those rifles just yet,=
 and I hope you will not=20

have to exhibit them at all. You can sit down on the deck and hear all that=
 is going on," added the=20

captain, as he moved away. If he took his eyes off the boat at=20


_
expedients was apparently about to be adopted, he decided that it was high =
time to try to find out=20

why he was to be effaced. Whereupon he called across to the group at the fi=
re.  "Without wishing=20

to interfere with any arrangements you gentlemen are making, I shall be obl=
iged if you will tell me=20

why you think you have found it necessary to murder me."  "You know mighty =
good and well why=20

there's one too many of you on cape where the ship would first be seen.  Lo=
uis had placed himself=20

at the rail, ready for the conference that the pirate desired. Mazagan had =
met him face to face, and=20

he could not help knowing him.  "Are you Mr. Louis Belgrave?" demanded the =
Moorish captain,=20

more gently than he had spoken to Scott at the close of the interview with =
him.  "That is my name,"=20

replied the young millionaire with all his native dignity.=20
