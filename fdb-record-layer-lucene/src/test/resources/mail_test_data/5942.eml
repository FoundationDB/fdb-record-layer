scruple; their telling the truth depends on their being more or less carefu=
lly instructed by the=20

parties to the suit; and unfortunate is he who summons them as his witnesse=
s. They do not=20

understand love, and their sensuality is carried to the extreme; consequent=
ly they are cruel fathers=20

and worse husbands, and they have not the least respect or consideration fo=
r their wives. Paternal=20

love is a strange thing for them, and therefore when they punish their chil=
dren they do so=20

barbarously, and if they begin it in the morning they do not finish until n=
ight. The same cruel=20

disposition is seen among the schoolmasters who are paid by the government =
to teach the youth=20

in their villages.  The code of laws for the Indias, considering these Indi=
ans as neophytes like=20

those of the Antillas and the Americas, has made them participants in the p=
rivileges and liberties=20

granted to those natives; and it exempts them from the penalties of which t=
hey render themselves=20

worthy by the atrocious crimes which they continually commit. Incest, for e=
xample, is a common=20

vice among them, for which opportunity is given by the little privacy in wh=
ich the families live; for=20

the mother, daughters, and sisters all sleep in one bed [hacen cama redonda=
], without any other=20

separation from the men than merely a blanket. It is difficult to prove thi=
s crime among them, and=20

only the cura or missionary could rebuke them and apply the proper correcti=
on, in their wrongly-

understood condition of neophytes, if in confession they should reveal thei=
r sin; but, as lying is=20

their dominant vice, they actually bursts. Remembering also Bravard=E2=80=
=99s warning of Mendoza, in the=20

last chapter, it is clear that in certain regions such observations can be =
made of practical value to=20

the people at large.  One of the most ingenious apparatus for observing the=
 vibrations of the soil is=20

that constructed by M. d=E2=80=99Abbadie, at his observatory near the Pyren=
ees. A conical cavity forty-six=20

feet deep is excavated in the solid rock. At the bottom is a basin of mercu=
ry. A long-focus lens=20

over this reflects upon the surface of the ground the image of the metal be=
low. The slightest=20

tremor is carefully examined by a microscope. In short, this ingenious Fren=
chman has applied the=20

reflecting telescope to the observation of the interior of the earth.  Afte=
r all, the chief precautions=20

must be of a different type. As already noticed, long observation has taugh=
t the Japanese and=20

others that their safety depends mainly upon the construction of houses of =
the lightest type; when=20

the sea wave is more to be dreaded than the shock. This is the general prin=
ciple of building now=20

adopted in countries where earthquakes are frequent; and doubtless the eart=
hquake is partially=20

responsible for the fact that many intelligent savage races have made no pr=
ogress in architecture.=20

It should be noted, however, that the ancients believed that deep wells wer=
e a safeguard against=20

earthquakes; such is the expression of several ancient writers. And in this=
 connection we may=20

mention the remarkable case of Quito, in Ecuador. Here we have a city of ma=
gnificent cathedrals,=20

public edifices, and other lofty=20

s are the refuge of the=20

more perverse, who migrate from the provinces and from their villages, in o=
rder not to work and to=20

relieve themselves from paying the tribute. There they devote themselves to=
 studies in the=20

colleges of Santo Tomas, San Jos, and San Juan de Letran, making progress i=
n a short time, and=20

deceiving the professors with their apparent ingenuousness; at the same tim=
e they are occupied=20

as in three centuries been overthrown by an earthquake. Yet it lies on the =
plateau on which stood=20

Riobamba, where such terrible destruction was wrought in 1794, and at the b=
ase of the great=20

volcano of Pichincha. It has been shaken time and again more severely than =
towns in the vicinity=20

that have been totally destroyed. Yet it remains intact, and the people hav=
e an indifference to=20

earthquakes that is astonishing. They attribute their safety to the fact of=
 having deep cellars under=20

aling from him (which=20

they do with astonishing dexterity). After a little time, having abused the=
 master's patience, and=20

having violated his wife, daughters, and other relatives, if he has such (w=
ithout respecting even=20

those who have not reached the age of puberty), they end by departing with =
the utmost coolness;=20

and in order to avoid recognition, we remember that tropical races are not,=
 as a rule, a cellar=20

building people, it may be that the idea is worthy of serious consideration=
. But many idle races of=20

the tropics might, in lower grounds, merely exchange the results of an occa=
sional earthquake for=20
