gateway to Mount St. Helens. Deviating to the right at Vader, the north fork of the picturesque 

Chehalis is soon reached, which fertile valley is followed to the cities of Chehalis and Centralia, 

two rapidly growing railroad centers having a combined population of 15,500 people. Groves,

occasional friendly pat.  Presently in Hannah's train came Anne Chitt, a meek young assistant 

from the village, who did occasionally gratify William's longing for a little attention; but so soon as 

she began to pat him and say he was a good dog, she was called away by Hannah to sweep or
