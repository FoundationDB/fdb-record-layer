fed in an unbattened board shed. During the succeeding ten days, when the c=
old was intense=20

almost the entire time, the same steers, fed on the same rations, and in th=
e same shed, gained but=20

six and six-tenths pounds per head. About a year ago the Professor fed a lo=
t of pigs for three=20

weeks of the coldest weather, in open yards, and found them to consume more=
 than three times=20

the amount of food to pound of increase than the same number of pigs in the=
 warm basement of=20

the barn. He has a cow kept in a bleak "Kansas barn" which shrinks in her m=
ilk from one-fourth to=20

one-half after twenty-four hours of very severe weather. From all this the =
conclusion is what we=20

have so often taught in these columns, though not as forcibly as the Profes=
sor teaches by his=20

careful experiments, that you can not burn feed as fuel to support the body=
 of an animal and at the=20

same time have the animal stow it away in the form of muscle and fat. The f=
act is that our farmers=20

throw away one-half their feed in furnishing animal heat that they have bee=
n completely cured by a=20

voyage, after all the resources of medicine had been exhausted upon them in=
 vain.  It is evident=20

then, that a _pure_ sea air is not detrimental in cases of consumption. Dr.=
 Rush, with his usual=20

ingenuity, explains the prevalence of this complaint in our sea-ports, by a=
ttributing it to the mixture=20

of land and sea air; and in confirmation observes, that "those situations w=
hich are in the=20

neighbourhood of bays and rivers, where the fresh and salt waters mix their=
 streams together, are=20

more unfavourable to consumptive patients than the seashore, and therefore =
should be more=20

carefully avoided by them in exchanging city for country air."[71]  Indepen=
dently, however, of these=20

causes, I think the frequent and sudden vicissitudes of temperature, which =
we suffer on the coast,=20

are alone sufficient to account for the prevalence of catarrhal and pneumon=
ic affections, which=20

most commonly are the precursors of consumption.  I trust the foregoing obs=
ervations have not=20

WASHINGTON.   Surely the House of Representatives is getting down to solid =
work since the=20

holiday vacation. Mr. Holman, for instance, found no great difficulty in ge=
tting a resolution passed=20

declaring that in the judgment of the House all public lands heretofore gra=
nted to States and=20

corporations in aid of the construction of railroads, so far as the same is=
 history is only useful in its=20

practical applications; and if it can be shown to throw any light upon an a=
rt, which contributes so=20

much to the comfort and happiness of man, we have established one of the st=
rongest=20

considerations, which can recommend it to general patronage and investigati=
on. Physicians ought=20

in an especial manner to set a high value upon the researches of naturalist=

already given is sufficient to=20
