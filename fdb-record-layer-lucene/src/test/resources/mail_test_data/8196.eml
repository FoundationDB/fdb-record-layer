those discs may be gone."  "That's right," Brad agreed. "Even when I was there, not many were 

kicking around."  "Brad, you're sure it's all right to take the discs?" Mr. Hatfield asked.  "Yes, the 

contractor told me I might have all that were lying around."  Reassured, the Cub leader agreed 

with the boys that no time should be lost in hiking to the site.  "We might have a weiner roast too," 

he proposed. "On the way, we'll pass a store and can buy anything we want."  The Cubs quickly 

put away cardboard and paint. All were dressed warmly enough for the hike except Babe who had 

to be sent home for sturdy shoes and a heavier jacket.  The youngster was back at the church in 

ten minutes, however, his pockets bulging.  "Now what have you got?" Chips asked him 

suspiciously.  Babe grinned and produced several crushed cookies and an apple.  "You and your 

appetite," Chips muttered, shaking his head. "Why don't you grow up?"  Babe refused to take 

offense. "I thought I might get hungry on the way," he defended himself.  "You're always hungry," 

Chips retorted. "If you'd spend less time feeding your face and more time studying the rule book, 

maybe you'd be promoted to Wolf Rank."  "Cut it out, Chips," advised Brad, who had overheard 

the remark. "Babe is catching onto Cub ways fast. I'll wager he'll be a Wolf before another certain 

Wolf I know moves on up to Bear rank."  "Now who's rubbing it in?" Chips complained. "I'm a 

stage-driver, and how to throw a lasso. He promised to rope a steer for me before sundown next 

day. He got out his "chaps" and silver spurs to show them to Jake and me, and his best cowboy 

boots, with tops stitched in bold design--roses, and true-lover's knots, and undraped female 

figures. These, he solemnly explained, were angels.  Before we went to bed Jake and Otto were 

called up to the living-room for prayers. Grandfather put on silver-rimmed spectacles and read 

several Psalms. His voice was so sympathetic and he read so interestingly that I wished he had 

chosen one of my favorite chapters in the Book of Kings. I was awed by his intonation of the word 

"Selah." "_He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom He loved. 

Selah._" I had no idea what the word meant; perhaps he had not. But, as he uttered it, it became 

oracular, the most sacred of words.  Early the next morning I ran out of doors to look about me. I 

had been told that ours was the only wooden house west of Black Hawk--until you came to the 

Norwegian settlement, where there were several. Our neighbors lived in sod houses and dugouts--

comfortable, but not very roomy. Our white frame house, with a story and half-story above the 

basement, stood at the east end of what I might call the farmyard, with the windmill close by the 

kitchen door. From the windmill the ground sloped westward, down to the barns and granaries and

know it!"  "Sure, sure," Brad said, giving him a friendly clap on the back. "Only maybe you ought to 

dig in a little harder on those elective requirements before you toss stones at anyone else." 

Despite the lateness of the season, the day was a pleasant one. Selecting Highway 23, the Cubs, 

led by Brad and Mr. Hatfield, soon set off in the direction of the marsh.  Their way skirted a built-up 

area near the city limits. A short distance beyond, they passed a sparsely settled section where a 

few new houses were in process of construction.  "How much farther?" Babe asked, limping along 

beside Brad.  He had attached himself like a puppy to the older boy, but found it impossible to 

imitate his smooth, easy gait.  "We're almost there now," Brad encouraged him. "Guess you aren't 

used to hiking, are you?"  "My feet hurt."  "Sure, and why wouldn't they, with those tight shoes? 

Better get yourself some that fit, Babe. The Cubs do a lot of hiking."  "Say, when do we eat?" 

demanded Red. The brisk walk had made him very hungry.  "Well, we could have and washed out 

in winding gullies by the rain. Beyond the corncribs, at the bottom of the shallow draw, was a 

muddy little pond, with rusty willow bushes growing about it. The road from the post-office came 

directly by our door, crossed the farmyard, and curved round this little pond, beyond which it 

began to climb the gentle swell of unbroken prairie to the west. There, along the western sky-line, 

it skirted a great cornfield, much larger than any field I had ever seen. This cornfield, and the 

sorghum patch behind the barn, were the only broken land in sight. Everywhere, as far as the eye 

could reach, there was nothing but rough, shaggy, red grass, most of it as tall as I.  North of the 

house, inside the ploughed fire-breaks, grew a thick-set strip of box-elder trees, low and bushy, 

their leaves already turning yellow. This hedge was nearly a quarter of a mile long, but I had to 

look very hard to see it at all. The little trees were insignificant against the grass. It seemed as if 

the grass were about to run over them, and over the

glancing over the terrain. "It's for the fellows to decide."  "All in favor--" shouted Red.  Every Cub 

voted to halt then and there and build their fire.  Mr. Hatfield selected a suitable place at the edge 

of the marsh, not far from the road. Under his direction, the boys cleared away dry leaves and 

debris to insure that the fire could not spread.  While the Cubs roasted weiners on long sticks over 

the coals, Mr. Hatfield again talked over plans for the coming Round Table  As I looked about me I 

felt that the grass was the country, as the water is the sea. The red of the grass made all the great 

prairie the color of wine-stains, or of certain seaweeds when they are first washed up. And there 

was so much motion in it; the whole country seemed, somehow, to be running.  I had almost 

forgotten that I had a grandmother, when she came out, her sunbonnet on her head, a grain-sack 

in her hand, and asked me if I did not want to go to the garden with her
