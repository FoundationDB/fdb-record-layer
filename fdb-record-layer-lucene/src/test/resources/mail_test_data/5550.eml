 It was my vain attempt to recapture him that terminated in the most exciti=

loggerhead and crawled under the stern-sheets so as not to see them.  Now I=
 was well-nigh=20

exhausted, and began to feel drowsy. Sleep soon overcame me, and testing my=
 head against the=20

boat's side, I lost consciousness.  When I awoke I heard voices and recogni=
zed Captain Coffin,=20

who had me in his arms, while the boat's crew were pulling us to the _Nimro=
d_. They had seen the=20

lantern from the ship, and Captain Coffin had come himself in the boat to r=
escue me.  My shot=20

from the bomb-gun had killed the bull whale, and it had also taught Captain=
 Coffin two lessons:=20

First, not to leave a whale merely  "The devil you did!"  "Yes. I had suffi=
cient confidence in my=20

judgment."  "Who bought it?"  "Whitney C. Witt, of New York. He's an old ma=
n now, of course. I=20

expect you remember him, _cher maitre_." Mr. Oxford's eyes twinkled. "I sol=
d it to him, and of=20

course he accepted my guarantee. Soon afterwards I had the offer of other p=
ictures obviously by=20

you, from the same dealer. And I bought them. I kept on buying them. I dare=
 say I've bought forty=20

altogether."  "Did your little dealer guess whose work they were?" Priam de=
manded suspiciously.=20

"Not he! If he had done, do you suppose he'd have parted=20


_
present case, to clear its spouting, as its ruptured blood vessel is draine=
d, and like a wounded=20

animal, to fight with renewed vigor; second, not to despise the bomb-gun. A=
lways use your bomb-

gun on a whale, children.  We solemnly told Captain Daniel that we would do=
 so, and then we=20

bade him good night and went away from the _Greyhound_ with sea-pictures in=
 our minds that=20

can never go out of them as long as we live.    SAVED BY A SEAL  By Theodor=
e A. Cutting  The=20

liveliest seal that father and I ever caught, and the only one that ever go=
t away from us after we=20

had housed it, was Nab. Although father has been catching seals for zoologi=
cal fifty pounds=20

apiece? Mind, at first I thought I was buying pictures painted before your =
supposed death. I=20

thought, like the rest of the world, that you were--in the Abbey. Then I be=
gan to have doubts. And=20

one day when a bit of paint came off on my thumb, I can tell you I was star=
tled. However, I stuck to=20

my opinion, and I kept on guaranteeing the pictures as Farlls."  "It never =
occurred to you to make=20

any inquiries?"  "Yes, it did," said Mr. Oxford. "I did my best to find out=
 from the dealer where he=20

got the pictures from, but he wouldn't tell me. Well, I sort of scented a m=
ystery. Now I've got no=20

professional use for mysteries, and I=20
