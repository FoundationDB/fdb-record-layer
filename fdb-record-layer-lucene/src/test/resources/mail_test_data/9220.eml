owning himself and the wench in the Loire."   III  Chauvelin and Martin-Rog=
et turned from  "I knew you would, Dan!  I _said_ you would."  "Tan, you ra=
scal! come here."  The youth obeyed, languidly, for it was evident that he =
was thoroughly exhausted.  "My poy," said the Highlander, touched by Dan's =
appearance, "you hev been in the watter!"  "Not exactly, father, but last n=
ight's thunderstorm caught us, _
everywhere--it almost seemed as if some sprang out of the earth--men, eithe=
r of the town-guard or=20

Marats on patrol duty, or merely idlers and night hawks who happened to be =
about, yielded to that=20

primeval instinct of brutality which causes men as well as beasts to join i=
n a pursuit against a=20

fellow creature.  Fleury was in the rear of his posse. Martin-Roget and Cha=
uvelin, walking as=20

rapidly as they could by his side, tried to glean some information out of t=
he commandant's=20

breathless and scrappy narrative:  "What happened exactly?"  "It was the ma=
n Paul Friche ... with=20

the aristo wench on his back ... and another man carrying the ci-devant ari=
sto ... they were the=20

English spies ... in disguise ... they knocked over the lamp ... and got aw=
ay...."  "Name of a...."=20

"No use swearing, citizen Martin-Roget," retorted Fleury as hotly as his ag=
itated movements would=20

allow. "You and citizen Chauvelin are responsible for the affair. It was yo=
u, citizen Chauvelin, who=20

placed Paul Friche inside that tavern in observation--you told him what to =
do...."  "Well?"  "Paul=20

Friche--the real Paul Friche--was taken to the infirmary some hours ago ...=
 with a cracked skull,=20

dealt him by your Englishman, I've no doubt...."  "Impossible," reiterated =
Chauvelin with a curse.=20

"Impossible? why impossible?"  "The man I spoke to outside Le Bouffay...." =
 "Was not Paul=20

Friche."  "He was on guard in the Place with two other Marats."  "He was no=
t Paul Friche--the=20

others were not Marats."  "Then the man who was inside the tavern?..."  "Wa=
s not Paul Friche."  "=20

... who climbed the gutter pipe ...?"  "Malediction!"  And the chase contin=
ued--waxing hotter every=20

minute. The hare had gained slightly on the hounds--there were more than a =
hundred hot on the=20

trail by now--having crossed the bridge he was on the Isle Feydeau, and wit=
hout hesitating a=20

moment he plunged at once into the network of narrow streets which cover th=
e island in the rear of=20

La Petite Hollande and the Hotel de le Villestreux, where lodged Carrier, t=
he representative of the=20

people. The hounds after him had lost some ground by halting--if only for a=
 second or two--first at=20

the head of the bridge, then at the corners of the various streets, while t=
hey peered into the=20

darkness to see which way had gone that fleet-footed hare.  "Down this way!=
"  "No! That!"  "There=20

he goes!"  It always took a few seconds to decide, during which the man on =
ahead with his burden=20

on his shoulder had time mayhap to reach the end of a street and to turn a =
corner and once again=20

to plunge into darkness and out of sight. The street lanthorns were few in =
this squalid corner of the=20

city, and it was only when perforce the running hare had to cross a circle =
of light that the the dawn=20

of lasting prosperity in the Red River Colony.  "Cut their bonds," said the=
 Chief Trader, as the=20

prisoners approached.  No touch of the surgeon's knife ever effected a cure=
 more speedily.  "I=20

congratulate you, young sir," said the Trader, grasping Dan's hand: "you ar=
e now free, for I=20

understand that your loss of liberty had nothing to do with crime, and the =
rival companies are no=20

longer opponents; they are friends.  Indeed, we have been married, so to sp=
eak, and are now one.=20

I am on my way to Red River with the good news."  "When do you start?" aske=
d Dan, abruptly.=20

"Well, if you mean from this spot," answered the Trader, somewhat surprised=
 as well as amused at=20

the eagerness of the question, "I start at once.  Indeed, I would not have =
landed here had I not=20

seen your party.  You appear to be anxious.  Why do you ask?"  "Because it =
is of the utmost=20

importance to me that I should be in Red River on a certain date, and I fea=
r that that is all but=20

impossible now."  Dan then explained, as briefly as possible, his circumsta=
nces. Fortunately, the=20

Trader was a sympathetic man.  He ordered his crews to embark at once and b=
ade the two=20

captives take a brief, if not an affectionate, farewell of their late capto=
rs.  "I cannot promise you to=20

push on," he said, "at a rate which will satisfy you--or even accomplish th=
e end you have in view--



but I will do the best I can, without overworking my men.  I fear, however,=
 that you will have to=20

make up your mind to a delayed wedding!"  "If you will only do your best fo=
r a day or two," said=20

Dan, "until we reach the mouth of this river, that will do, for there my ow=
n hunting canoe was left;=20

and, once in that, La Certe and I can go ahead and tell them you are coming=
."  "Nay, that would be=20

requiting me ill--returning evil for good--to take the wind out of my sails=
 and make my news stale,"=20

returned the Trader, with a good-natured laugh.  "True, I did not think of =
that," said Dan.  "Then we=20

will say not a word about it until you arrive."  "Yes, we will be dumb," ad=
ded La Certe.  "Even=20

Slowfoot shall fail to drag it out of me!"  And thus it was arranged.  The =
(late) Nor'-westers=20

continued their voyage to Canada, and the Hudson's Bay men resumed their de=
scent of the=20

Winnipeg River.  Arrived at the great lake, the anxious pair did not wait e=
ven to rest, but at once=20

embarked in their little hunting canoe.  "I'm sorry you are such an unprese=
ntable bridegroom," said=20

the Trader, when they were about to separate.  He referred to the cuts and =
bruises with which=20

poor Dan's countenance was temporarily disfigured.  "Never mind," returned =
our hero, with a=20

laugh, "wait till you see the bride; she will more than make up for the sho=
rtcomings of the groom.=20


_
"To the bridges for your lives!" now shouted Fleury to the men nearest to h=
im. "Leave him to=20

wander on the island. He cannot come off it, unless he jumps into the Loire=
."  The Marats--

intelligent and ferociously keen on the chase--had already grasped the impo=
rtance of this order:=20

with the bridges guarded that fleet-footed Englishman might run as much as =
he liked, he was=20

bound to be run to earth like a fox in his burrow. In a moment they had dis=
persed along the quays,=20

some to one bridge-head, some to another--the Englishman could not double b=
ack now, and if he=20

had already crossed to the Isle Gloriette, which was not joined to the left=
 bank of the river by any=20

bridge, he would be equally caught like a rat in a trap.  "Unless he jumps =
into the Loire," reiterated=20

Fleury triumphantly.  "The proconsul will have more excitement than he hope=
d for," he added with=20

a laugh. "He was looking forward to the capture of the English spy, and in =
deadly terror lest he=20

escaped. But now meseems that we shall run our fox down in sight of the ver=
y gates of la=20

Villestreux."  Martin-Roget's thoughts ran on Yvonne and the duc.  "You wil=
l remember, citizen=20

commandant," he contrived to say to Fleury, "that the ci-devant Kernogans w=
ere found inside the=20

Rat Mort."  Fleury uttered an exclamation of rough impatience. What did he,=
 what did anyone care=20

at this moment for a couple of aristos more or less when the noblest game t=
hat had ever fallen to=20

the bag of any Terrorist was so near being run to earth? But Chauvelin said=
 nothing. He walked on=20

at a brisk pace, keeping close to commandant Fleury's side, in the immediat=
e wake of the pursuit.=20

His lips were pressed tightly together and a hissing breath came through hi=
s wide-open nostrils.=20

His pale eyes were fixed into the darkness and beyond it, where the most bi=
tter enemy of the=20

cause which he loved was fighting his last battle against Fate.   II  "He c=
annot get off the island!"=20

Fleury had said awhile ago. Well! there was of a truth little or nothing no=
w between the hunted=20

hare and capture. The bridges were well guarded: the island swarming with h=
ounds, the Marats at=20

their posts and the Loire an impassable barrier all round.  And Chauvelin, =
the most tenacious=20

enemy man ever had, Fleury keen on a reward and Martin-Roget with a private=
 grudge to pay off,=20

all within two hundred yards behind him.  True for the moment the Englishma=
n had disappeared.=20

Burden and all, the gloom appeared to have swallowed him up. But there was =
nowhere he could=20

go; mayhap he had taken refuge under a doorway in one of the narrow streets=
 and hoped perhaps=20

under cover of the darkness to allow his pursuers to slip past him and then=
 to double back.  Fleury=20

was laughing in the best of humours. He was gradually collecting all the Ma=
rats together and=20

sending them to the bridge-heads under the command of their various sergean=
ts. Let the=20

Englishman spend the night on the islands if he had a mind. There was a ful=
l company of Marats=20

here to account for him as soon as he attempted to come out in the open.  T=
he idlers and night=20

hawks as well as the municipal town guard continued to run excitedly up and=
 down the streets--

sometimes there would come a lusty cry from a knot of pursuers who thought =
time, which, in the=20

matters at least of perseverance, persistency, hard labour, and determinati=
on, beat all the records=20

of bicyclists and horsemen from the beginning of time.  Cyclists have frequ=
ent down-hills to help=20

and rest them; Dan and his friend had no such aids.  It was all either dead=
 level or upstream.  Dick=20

Turpin and the rider to Ghent, (we forget his name), only killed their hors=
es.  Dan and Francois=20

nearly killed themselves--not only with hard work and no rest, but with pro=
found anxiety, for the=20

wedding hour was rapidly approaching and they were still far from home!  Wh=
ile these events were=20

transpiring in the wilderness, things were going smoothly enough in the Col=
ony.  "I will be thinkin',"=20

said old Duncan McKay, one fine evening as he sat in his invalid chair, bes=
ide Duncan junior, who=20



was woefully reduced and careworn, despite the attentions of the sympatheti=
c Jessie Davidson,=20

who was seated near him on a rustic seat beside Elspie--  "I will be thinki=
n' that Tan an' La Certe=20

are stoppin' longer away than iss altogither seemly.  Tan should have been =
here two or three days=20

before the weddin'."  "He will likely be time enough for his own weddin'--w=
hatever," remarked=20

Duncan junior.  "Don't you think so, Miss Jessie?"  "I think it likely," an=
swered the girl with a smile.=20

"He is _sure_ to be in time," said Elspie, with emphasis.  "We niver can be=
 sure of anything in this=20

world, my tear," remarked old Duncan, becoming oracular in tone.  "How do y=
ou know he iss so=20

sure?"  "Because Dan never breaks his word," returned Elspie, with an air o=
f decision that would=20

have gratified Dan immensely had he been there to see it.  "Fery true, my t=
ear," rejoined the=20

Highlander, "but there are many other things that interfere with one's word=
 besides the will.  He=20

might tie, you know, or be trowned, or his gun might burst and render him h=
elpless for life, if it did=20

not kill him altogither.  It iss an uncertain world at the best--whatever."=
  Archie Sinclair, who joined=20

them--with his brother, Little Bill, by his side, not on his back--was of t=
he same opinion as Elspie,=20

but Billie shook his head, looked anxious, and said nothing--for he felt th=
at his friend was running=20

things much too close.  At a later hour that same evening, the other member=
s of the two families--

who dropped in to make inquiries--began to express anxiety, and Okematan, w=
ho called just to=20

see how things were getting on, shook his head and looked owlish.  Old Peg =
said nothing, but she=20

evidently thought much, to judge from the deepening wrinkles on her forehea=
d.  As for Fred=20

Jenkins, he was too much taken up with Elise Morel to think much about anyt=
hing, but even he at=20

last grew anxious, and when the wedding morning finally dawned, and no Dan =
made his=20

appearance, something like consternation filled the hearts of all within th=
e walls of Ben Nevis Hall=20

and Prairie Cottage.  Elspie appeared to feel less than the others, but the=
 truth was that she only=20

controlled herself better.  "He only wants to take us by surprise," she sai=
d, and, under the strength=20

of that opinion, she robed herself for the wedding.  Only her gravity and t=
he pallor of her cheeks=20

told of uneasiness in her mind.  "Muster Sutherland said he would come=20


_
through the darkness, at others there would be a call of halt, and feverish=
 consultation held at a=20

street corner as to the best policy to adopt.  The town guard, jealous of t=
he Marats, were pining to=20

lay hands on the English spy for the sake of the reward. Fleury, coming acr=
oss their provost,=20

called him a fool for his pains.  "My Marats will deal with the English spi=
es, citizen," he said=20

roughly, "he is no concern of yours."  The provost demurred: an altercation=
 might have ensued=20

when Chauvelin's suave voice poured oil on the troubled waters.  "Why not,"=
 he said, "let the town=20

guard continue their search on the island, citizen commandant? The men may =
succeed in digging=20

our rat out of his hole and forcing him out into the open all the sooner. Y=
our Marats will have him=20

quickly enough after that."  To this suggestion the provost gave a grudging=
 assent. The reward=20

when the English spy was caught could be fought for later on. For the nonce=
 old Duncan, uneasily.=20

"He should hev been here now,--for we need his advice sorely."  "Here he is=
s," exclaimed Fergus,=20

starting up and hurrying forward to welcome the good old Elder.  Mr Sutherl=
and's advice was=20

decided, and promptly given.  Both weddings should be deferred and all the =
young men must turn=20

out in an organised search without a moment's delay!  It was amazing to fin=
d that every one had=20

been of exactly the same opinion for some time past, but no one had dared t=
o suggest a course of=20

action which implied a belief that Dan might be in imminent danger, if not =
worse.  Now that the ice=20

had been broken, however, all the youth of the neighbourhood volunteered fo=
r service, and a plan=20

of search was being hastily formed under the direction of the Elder, when t=
wo men in a canoe=20

were seen to paddle very slowly to the landing-place at the foot of the gar=
den.  After hauling the=20

end of their canoe on shore, they walked, or rather=20


_
he turned unceremoniously on his heel, and left Fleury cursing him for a me=
ddlesome busybody.=20

"So long as he and his rabble does not interfere with my Marats," growled t=
he commandant.  "Will=20

you see your sergeants, citizen?" queried Chauvelin tentatively. "They will=
 have to keep very much=20

on the alert, and will require constant prodding to their vigilance. If I c=
an be of any service...."=20

"No," retorted Fleury curtly, "you and citizen Martin-Roget had best try an=
d see the proconsul and=20

tell him what we have done."  "He'll be half wild with terror when he  One =
of them tripped and fell,=20

and seemed from his motions as if he thought it was not worth while to rise=
 again.  The other,=20

paying no attention to his companion, came on.  "Pless my soul!" exclaimed =
old McKay, "it iss=20

Tan--or his ghost-- whatever!"  And so it was!  Dirty, bruised, scratched, =
battered, and soaking=20

wet, Daniel Davidson appeared to claim his beautiful bride.  And he did not=
 come in vain, for,=20

regardless of propriety and everything else, Elspie ran forward with a litt=
le shriek and flung herself=20

into his arms.  "I have kept my promise,=20
