philodendron monstera relentlessly thrusting upon him.  "In all our talks, =
Dick--there haven't been very many of them--my father has taken, or seemed =
to take, a different line. I don't recall anything specific just now, but h=
e has given me the impression that he hasn't much in common with Mr. McVick=
ar and his methods. To hear him talk--"  Gantry smiled. "You know your fath=
er very superficially, Evan, if you'll permit me to say so. What the Honora=
ble David Blount says in out from the camp seven days.' An Arab legend poin=
ts out this spot as the place where she spent that time, and from which it =
gets the name of Maryam."  "That's nice, Captain Ringgold!" exclaimed Mrs. =
Blossom. "I wish you would tell us more Bible stories."  "Some people belie=
ve that the Mediterranean and the Red Seas were connected in some remote ag=
e of the world, or at least that the latter extended to the north as far as=
 Lake Timsah," continued philodendron monstera relentlessly thrusting upon =
him.  "In all our talks, Dick--there haven't been very many of them--my fat=

"And you'll let the club fall wherever it may?"  "I've got to do that, Dick=
; I can't do any less."  For the=20

third time Gantry paused. The train-waiting interval was half gone, and he =
had been feeling=20

purposefully for the climaxing moment without finding it. But now he decide=
d that it had come.  "In=20

the talk this morning there was some reference made to your father and his =
attitude in this fight,=20

Evan. Do you remember what was said?"  "Perfectly."  "Well, suppose I shoul=
d tell you that I know=20

now--what I didn't know certainly then--that when you hit out at us you hit=
 him?"  "You mean that=20

he is with you in this scheme to hoodwink the people?"  "Ask yourself," was=
 the low-toned reply.  "I=20

have asked myself a hundred times, Dick; I've been hoping against hope. I'l=
l be utterly frank with=20

you, as man to man. We've kept pretty period went through it in four days."=
  "I wish you would tell=20

us something about Herodotus, Captain, for his name has been frequently men=
tioned in Egypt,"=20

said Mrs. Woolridge.  "And about Diodorus and Strabo, also mentioned in the=
 lectures," added the=20

magnate. "I have forgotten all that I ever knew about these gentlemen."  "I=
 am in the same boat,=20

Captain," the doctor responded.  "I shall leave those subjects to the profe=
ssor. But we are=20

approaching some objects of interest, and we will defer the matter to anoth=
er time," replied the=20

commander. "Do you see a white dome on the starboard? That is the tomb of S=
hekh Ennedek;=20

and it is rather a picturesque affair here in the midst of the desert."  "W=
as he a fighting character?"=20

asked Mrs. Belgrave.  "Not at all; far from it. He was a wealthy Arab chief=
. He made the pilgrimage=20

to=20


_
obstinately out of the political field, both of us, father and I, since the=
 first day when I told him my=20

views on machine-made government. But from a few little things he has said,=
 I've gathered that he=20

isn't with you; that there has been a quarrel of some kind between him and =
he seems to have=20

been greatly impressed by it, for he gave his cattle and his lands to the p=
oor, and spent the rest of=20

his life on the greenish territory we have just passed through, in religiou=
s meditation."  "He was a=20

good man if he was a Mohammedan," added the lady.  "We=20


_
McVickar--"  "There was a set-to--a battle royal," Gantry put in. "The last=
 act of it was played to a=20

finish that evening when Mr. McVickar took you down to his car and hired yo=
u. But there has been=20

a meeting since. Ask yourself again, Evan. Haven't you had good and suffici=
ent reasons for=20

believing that you are bucking, not only the railroad company, but your own=
 flesh and blood?"=20

This time it was Blount who took time for reflection. The shot had gone hom=
e. He told himself that=20

there were only too many reasons for believing that Gantry was stating the =
simple fact. None the=20

less, he made a final effort to break down the church," added the captain. =
"Do you all remember=20

who Miriam was?"  More than half the party could not remember.  "She was th=
e sister of Moses;=20

and she first appears, doubtless as a young girl, watching the Nile-cradle =
of her infant brother. The=20

land next south of Lake Timsah, made green by the water, is called Gebel Ma=
ryam, probably after=20

the sister of Moses. She was a prophetess; but she found fault with the mar=
riage of her brother, for=20

which she was afflicted with Egyptian leprosy. As you find it in the Bible =
(Numbers xii.), Moses=20

asked the Lord: 'Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and after that=
 let her be=20
