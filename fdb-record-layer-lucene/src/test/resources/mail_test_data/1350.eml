Such was the petition of John duke of Burgundy and his brothers.  Another d=
ay, when the king=20

was in a tolerably good state of health, the three before mentioned petitio=
ners, accompanied by=20

their uncle the duke of Berry, and many princes and knights of France, with=
 master Regnault de=20

Corbie, first president of the parliament, and a number of officers of stat=
e, went to the h=C3=B4tel de St=20

Pol, where they found the king, who had quitted his apartment and was in th=
e garden. After having=20

reverently saluted him, the three brothers did their homages for the lordsh=
ips they held under him,=20

namely, duke John for his duchy of Burgundy, and his counties of Flanders a=
nd Artois,=E2=80=94Anthony=20

duke of Limbourg, for his county of Rethel,=E2=80=94and Philip the younger,=
 for his county of Nevers.=20

There were also a very great number of noblemen, knights and esquires, who =
did their homages=20

to the king for the estates they held from him in different parts of the ki=
ngdom. When the three=20

brothers had requested certificates from the king of the duties they had pe=
rformed, they took leave=20

of him, and departed for their h=C3=B4tels.  These same days there arrived =
at Paris, and in the adjacent=20

villages, full six thousand fighting men, in obedience to the summons of th=
e duke of Burgundy and=20

his brothers, under the command of Jean sans piti=C3=A9[91], bishop of Lieg=
e, and the count de Cleves.=20

This force was collected to oppose the duke of Orleans, should he attempt a=
ny insult against=20

them; for they were well informed of his not being well pleased that they h=
ad forced his nephew,=20

the dauphin, to return to Paris, nor with the petition they had made to the=
 king. What raised his=20

indignation the more, and especially against the duke of Burgundy, was his =
knowledge that the=20

charges in this petition attached more to him than to any other of the prin=
ces of the realm.  The=20

duke of Orleans, not knowing what turn these matters might take, nor what m=
easures might be=20

pursued against his person, ordered men at arms from all quarters to his as=
sistance. In the=20

number, sir John Harpedanne came with his men from the frontiers of the Bou=
lonois. From other=20

parts came the duke of Lorraine and the count d=E2=80=99Alen=C3=A7on[92] wi=
th a large body of men, who were=20

quartered at Melun, and in that neighbourhood, to the amount of fourteen hu=
ndred armed with=20

helmets, besides a great multitude of other sorts.  The whole country round=
 Paris, the Isle of=20

France and Brie, were sorely oppressed by the men at arms of both parties. =
 The partisans of the=20

duke of Orleans bore on their pennons the motto, =E2=80=98Je l=E2=80=99envi=
e;=E2=80=99 and the duke sent messengers to=20

the queen and to king Louis[93], who was preparing to set out for his kingd=
om of Naples with a=20

powerful body of men at arms, to come to him at Melun. The king, leaving hi=
s own business, went=20

thither, and had a conference with the queen and the duke,=E2=80=94after wh=
ich he returned to Paris, with=20

the intention of negotiating between the two parties.  He held many consult=
ations with the dukes of=20

Berry and Bourbon, and the king=E2=80=99s council, to attempt a reconciliat=
ion between the dukes of=20

Orleans and Burgundy. Whilst this was passing, the duke of Orleans wrote le=
tters to many of the=20



principal towns in the kingdom, complaining that many defamatory and injuri=
ous reports against=20

his person and honour had been very industriously spread through Paris, whi=
ch ought not to=20

obtain any credit until he should make answer to them. In like manner, he w=
rote to the university of=20

Paris, sending ambassadors to require that the matters in dispute between h=
im and the duke of=20

Burgundy should be argued before them, and that they should decide which of=
 the two was to=20

blame.  The university, on the receipt of this letter, sent some of their p=
rincipal members as=20

ambassadors to the duke at Melun, who stated three points which they were o=
rdered to lay before=20

him. In the first place, they thanked him for the honour he had done them b=
y sending them his=20

ambassadors: secondly, they declared that they should be very happy to witn=
ess the=20

commencement of a reformation in the kingdom; and thirdly, that they should=
 greatly rejoice to see=20

him and the duke of Burgundy reconciled.  The duke of Orleans, having liste=
ned to them, instantly=20

made answer, that they had not acted wisely in supporting and advising the =
duke of Burgundy in=20

his measures, which had been principally directed against himself, as they =
could not have been=20

ignorant that he was son and brother to a king; that the regency of the kin=
gdom had been given to=20

him as the most proper person, and was in fact his right, considering the s=
tate of the king=E2=80=99s health,=20

and the youth of his nephew the duke of Acquitaine. He added, secondly, tha=
t those members of=20

the university who were strangers, and from different countries, ought not =
to interfere in the=20

government or reformation of the kingdom, but should leave it to him and th=
ose of the blood royal,=20

and the king=E2=80=99s ministers.  In reply to their third point, he said, =
that there was no need of pacification=20

between him and the duke no two are alike or recognizable as the same perso=
n, until scrutiny is=20

brought to bear on the profile of the nose.[587] In considering photography=
 in its bearing on this=20

branch of medicine, it must also be borne in mind that a certain degree of =
imperfection arises from=20

want of uniformity in the lenses of cameras. I have already mentioned the w=
ant of precision in=20

photographing the skull, the common defect being central not orthogonal pro=
jection such as=20

anthropometry requires.   SURFACE SIGNS OF IDENTITY.  Examination of the su=
rface of the=20

skin and of its appendages may in certain cases take decisive importance. V=
aluable medical proof=20

is often furnished by scars, n=C3=A6vi, growths on the skin, pock-marks, tr=
aces of skin disease or of=20

scrofula, and by the so-called professional stigmata which would suggest th=
e trade, character of=20

work, or occupation of the deceased. Thus cigarette-stains on the fingers o=
f smokers, or silver-

stains on the hands of photographers, the horny palm of the laborer, or the=
 soft, delicate hand of=20

one not accustomed to work, would be indicative. The alterations in the han=
d make it, so to speak,=20

the seat of election; for in the majority of trades that may be mentioned i=
t is the hand alone that=20

bears the principal marks of daily work that indicate the calling. A case i=
s recorded of a person=20

who previously to his assassination was lame and walked with a crutch. Alth=
ough the body was=20

cut into fragments, an examination revealed in the palm of the hands charac=
teristic callosities,=20

showing prolonged use of support of this kind. In another instance of crimi=
nal mutilation a tattoo-

mark found on the arm proved an overwhelming charge against the assassin an=
d drew forth his=20

confession. An accused was also convicted of murder after establishing the =
only missing link, the=20

question of identity, which turned on the finding of cupping-marks and a ta=
ttoo on the body of the=20

murdered man. Personal identity of the bodies of infants has, moreover, bee=
n proved by means of=20

a small blister; by a patch of downy hair; by the similarity existing betwe=
en two pieces of thread=20

used to tie the umbilical cord; and by the severed end of that part of the =
funis attached to the infant=20



fitting precisely to the corresponding portion attached to the after-birth.=
 In addition to these a=20

methodical examination may put in evidence other facts that may be derived =
from diverse=20

influences that leave characteristic traces.   SIGNS FURNISHED BY MARKS, SC=
ARS, STAINS,=20

ETC., ON THE SKIN.  But of all the surface signs, whether congenital or acq=
uired, that may throw=20

light on the antecedents of the decedent, birth-marks, freckles, cicatrices=
, tattooes, and the=20

professional signs furnish the best indications. Birth-marks (_n=C3=A6vi ma=
terni_), from their supposed=20

indelibility, have given rise to discussion at many celebrated trials. As a=
 rule, these marks are=20

permanent and seldom lose their distinctness, though in exceptional cases t=
hey may undergo=20

atrophy in the first years of life. Hence testimony as to the existence of =
birth-marks may often be=20

uncertain when it has reference to a period a long way back. In a recorded =
case of supposed=20

recognition of a person having a mark of this kind on her face, the alleged=
 victim turned up and=20

established her identity as well as the fact that she did not have the birt=
h-mark attributed to her.=20

Before the introduction of the electrolytic method it was customary to reso=
rt to cauterization,=20

excision, vaccination, and tattooing the pigmentary spot in order to modify=
 or remove these=20

congenital marks. Such proceedings usually left more or less of an indelibl=
e scar which occasion=20

might utilize in the matter of medico-legal diagnosis. The traces of n=C3=
=A6vi may, however, be entirely=20

removed by electrolysis. I have recently seen a n=C3=A6vus of large dimensi=
on on the face of a young=20

woman so completely destroyed as to leave no trace of the operation.  The _=
possibility of the=20

disappearance of a scar_ in such circumstances depends here, as it does in =
other instances, on=20

the depth of the wound. A cicatrix being the result of a solution of contin=
uity in the derma, the=20

question arises whether a wound that has divided the derma without loss of =
substance and healed=20

by first intention leaves any perceptible scar. Some are of the opinion tha=
t a cicatricial line persists,=20

but grows fainter with time. Histological examination in a question of this=
 kind might prove=20

conclusive by showing the structure of the fibrocellular tissue that consti=
tutes the cicatrix. In the=20

case of very superficial burns or wounds, the scar may completely disappear=
 if the epidermis=20

alone or the superficial part of the derma is attacked; on the other hand, =
if there has been long=20

suppuration or loss of substance from ulcers, chancres, or buboes, especial=
ly on the neck, groins,=20

legs, or genital parts, traces of their lesion will be found. It may, there=
fore, be asserted as a=20

general rule that all scars resulting from wounds and from skin diseases wh=
ich involve any loss of=20

substance are _indelible_. A scar on the face is one of the points at issue=
 in the celebrated=20

Hillmon case already mentioned.  As the matter of cicatrices is treated in =
the section on=20

WOUNDS, further mention here would be superfluous.   TATTOOING.  Of all the=
 scars that speak,=20

none in judiciary medicine affords better signs of identity by their perman=
ency and durable=20

character and the difficulty of causing their disappearance than those furn=
ished by tattoo-marks.=20

The custom of tattooing having existed from the earliest historical epochs =
is of interest not only=20

from an ethnological but from a medical and pathological point of view, whi=
le it is of great=20

importance in its relation to medical jurisprudence in cases of contested p=
ersonal identification=20

which may be either established or refuted by this sign. So trustworthy is =
it in many instances as to=20

become a veritable ideograph that may=20


_
any warfare, nor had any challenges passed between them.  When the ambassad=
ors had heard=20

these answers, they withdrew, very much confused, and returned to Paris. On=
 the ensuing=20

Saturday, while the duke of Burgundy was in his h=C3=B4tel d=E2=80=99Artois=
, he was informed, and it was a fact,=20

that the queen and the duke of Orleans, with all their force, had marched f=
rom Melun, and were on=20

their road to Paris.  The duke, on hearing this, mounted his horse, and rod=
e to the h=C3=B4tel d=E2=80=99Angiers,=20

where he found the king of Sicily, the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, with =
other lords of the king=E2=80=99s=20

council, who, when they knew of the arrival of the said duke of Orleans, we=
re all greatly=20

astonished; for this was in direct contradiction to their intent, and to th=
e treaty which they state,=20

certain events of one=E2=80=99s life, and even their date.  Without going i=
nto the history of a subject=20

mentioned by Hippocrates, Plato, C=C3=A6sar, and Cicero, it may be pertinen=
t to say that tattooing is=20

prohibited by the Bible (Leviticus xix., 28) and is condemned by the Father=
s of the Church,=20

Tertullian among others, who gives the following rather singular reason for=
 interdicting its use=20

among women: =E2=80=9C_Certum sumus Spiritum Sanctum magis masculis tale al=
iquid subscribere=20

potuisse si feminis subscripsisset._=E2=80=9D (_De Virginibus_ velandis. Lu=
teti=C3=A6 Parisorum, 1675, f=C2=BA, p.=20

178.)  In addition to much that has been written by French, German,[588] an=
d Italian authors, who=20

have put tattooing in an important place in legal medicine, the matter of t=
attoo-marks a few=20


_
The duke of Burgundy had a great number of men at arms, as well within Pari=
s as without, who=20

bore for motto on the pennons of their lances, in Flemish, _Hie Houd!_ that=
 is to say, =E2=80=98I have=20

possession!=E2=80=99 in opposition to the device of the Orleans-party, _Je =
l=E2=80=99envie!_[94] The greater part of=20

the duke of Burgundy=E2=80=99s forces drew up in battle-array on the summit=
 of Montfaulcon, to wait the=20

arrival of their adversaries.  In the mean while, the populace of Paris ros=
e; and multitudes armed=20

themselves to oppose the entrance of the duke of Orleans, suspecting his in=
tentions were to give=20

the town up to pillage and murder. They pulled down many sheds, that no obs=
tructions might be=20

found in the streets to the full use of the lance, and that shelter might n=
ot be afforded against the=20

stones thrown down from the roofs of the houses.  Many scholars armed thems=
elves for the=20

defence of the bridges; and true it was, that the Parisians were far more f=
avourable to the party of=20

Burgundy than to that of Orleans, and were willing, should there be occasio=
n, to assist that party to=20

the utmost of their power.  The duke of Burgundy was fully prepared to resi=
st and combat the duke=20

of Orleans, had he advanced as far as Paris. But the chancellor and preside=
nts of the parliament,=20

with other prudent men, observing the great ferment in Paris, made many vis=
its to the h=C3=B4tel=20

d=E2=80=99Angiers, with a view to reconcile these princes, and avert the gr=
eat mischiefs that might=20

otherwise ensue. They likewise sent messengers to the duke of Orleans, to i=
nform him of the state=20

of Paris, and how very unpopular he was there. The duke and the queen, on h=
earing this=20

intelligence, after a short consultation with their most confidential advis=
ers, attention of the law=20

courts of England, the Chief Justice, Cockburn, in the Tichbourne case, hav=
ing described this=20

species of evidence as of =E2=80=9Cvital importance,=E2=80=9D and in itself=
 final and conclusive. This celebrated trial=20

has brought to light about all the knowledge that can be used in the invest=
igation of this sign as a=20

mark of identity. Absence of the tattoo-marks in this case justified the ju=
ry in their finding that the=20

defendant was not and could not be Roger Tichbourne, whereupon the alleged =
claimant was=20

proved to be an impostor, found guilty of perjury, and sentenced to penal s=
ervitude.[589]  The=20

practice of tattooing is found pretty much over the world, notably in the P=
olynesian Islands and in=20

some parts of Japan. It is, however, not found in Russia, being contrary to=
 the superstitions of the=20

people, who regard a mark of this kind as an alliance or contract with evil=
 spirits. Its use appears to=20

be penal only, and is limited to Siberian convicts. The degrading habit, co=
nfined to a low order of=20

development, exists at the present time as a survival of a superstitious pr=
actice of paganism,=20

probably owing to perversion of the sexual instinct, and is still common am=
ong school-boys,=20

sailors, soldiers, criminals, and the lowest order of prostitutes living in=
 so-called civilized=20

communities. Indeed, unanimity of opinion among medical and anthropological=
 writers assigns=20

erotic passion as the most frequent cause of tattooing, and shows the const=
ant connection=20

between tattoo-marks and crime. Penal statistics show the greater number of=
 tattooed criminals=20

among the lowest order, as those who have committed crimes against the pers=
on; while the=20

fewest are found among swindlers and forgers, the most=20


_
queen went to the Bois de Vincennes, and the duke returned with his army to=
 Corbeil.  On the=20

morrow, he came to Beaut=C3=A9; and his army was quartered near the bridge =
of Charenton, and in the=20

adjacent country. During this time, the before-named princes, with many gre=
at lords and members=20

of the council assembled, and met for several days, to consider of a reconc=
iliation between the two=20

parties. After some time, they at length made known to each their determina=
tion, which was, that=20

within two days the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy should submit the whole o=
f their disputes to=20

the decision of the kings of Sicily and Navarre, and the dukes of Berry and=
 Bourbon; and for the=20

accomplishment of the decision, they were each to bind themselves by their =
corporal oath, and=20

afterward to dismiss their forces. The duke of Orleans came to lodge at his=
 h=C3=B4tel at St Anthony,=20

near the bastille.  A few days afterward, the princes before named managed =
the affair so well that=20

the two dukes made up their quarrel, and apparently showed in public that t=
hey were good friends;=20

but He who knows the inward secrets of the heart saw what little dependance=
 was to be placed on=20

such outward appearances.  The duke of Lorraine and the count d=E2=80=99Ale=
n=C3=A7on, after this, returned=20

home with their men, without entering Paris; and not long afterward, the du=
ke of Burgundy=20

departed, with his brothers and men at arms, for Artois, and thence to his =
county of Flanders,=20

where he had a conference with his brother-in-law duke William, the bishop =
of Liege, the count=20

Waleran de St Pol, the count de Namur[95], and several others. When this wa=
s ended, he=20

returned to his town of Arras.                                  [A. D. 1406=

DUKE JOHN OF BURGUNDY OBTAINS FROM THE KING OF FRANCE THE=20

GOVERNMENT OF PICARDY.=E2=80=94AN EMBASSY FROM ENGLAND TO         FRANCE.=
=E2=80=94AN=20

ACCOUNT OF CLUGNET DE BRABANT, KNIGHT.   At the commencement of this year, =
the duke=20

of Burgundy, by a grant from the king, and =C3=A6sthetic sensibility far in=
 advance of the primitive man,=20

such as exists in London and New York, for instance, are to be found person=
s who make good=20

incomes by catering to this depraved taste for savage ornamentation. Person=
s who have been to=20

Jerusalem may remember the tattooers, who try to induce travellers to have =
a cross tattooed on=20

the arm as a souvenir of the pilgrimage. If a writer in the _Revue des Deux=
 Mondes_, 15th June,=20

1881, is to be believed, it appears that the Prince of Wales on his journey=
 to the Holy Land had a=20

Jerusalem Cross tattooed on his arm, April 2d, 1862. The =E2=80=9CCruise of=
 the _Bacchante_=E2=80=9D also tells=20

how the Duke of York was tattooed while in Japan.  The process is now rapid=
ly done, an Edison=20

electric pen being utilized for the purpose, and some of the wretched marty=
rs have the hardihood=20

to be tattooed from head to foot with grotesque designs in several colors. =
I know of several=20

instances: one of a man in Providence, R. I.; another of a Portuguese barbe=
r, who has striped=20

poles, razors, brushes, and other emblems of his calling over the entire bo=
dy. Another man has=20

likenesses of Abe Lincoln and of Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany on his respectiv=
e shins. A Nova=20

Scotian, tattooed from head to foot, has among other designs that of =E2=80=
=9CSt. George and the Dragon=E2=80=9D=20

on his back; while a Texas ranchman, six feet two inches tall, underwent th=
e torture of eight=20

weeks=E2=80=99 profanation of his body in order to appear in blue, brown, a=
nd red, with an irreverent image=20

on his back of the Immaculate Conception and thirty-one angels.[590]  A sin=
gular mixture of erotic=20

and religious emblems is often found among the varied and fantastic signs u=
sed in tattooing. I=20

recall the case of a man who had represented on his back a fox-hunt, in whi=
ch riders followed the=20

obtained the government of Picardy. In consequence, sir William de Vienne, =
lord of St George,=20

was ordered by him to the frontiers of the Boulonois, with six hundred men =
armed with helmets,=20

and a large body of genoese cross-bows. They were encamped on these frontie=
rs, whence they=20

made a sharp war against the English: nevertheless, the country was not so =
well guarded against=20

the inroads of the latter but that it was in several parts laid waste by th=
em.  About this period, the=20

ambassadors returned from England to the king and his council at Paris, nam=
ely, the earl of=20

Pembroke and the bishop of St David=E2=80=99s, with some others[96], who ca=
me to request that a truce=20

might be established between the two crowns, so that commerce might have a =
free course in both=20

countries.  They also demanded, that the king of France should grant his el=

formerly married to king Richard, in marriage to the eldest son of the king=
 of England, who, in=20

consideration of this match, would, instantly after its consummation, lay d=
own his crown, and=20

invest his son with the government of the kingdom.  These requests, having =
been made to the=20

royal council, were referred a few days for consideration; but at length, t=
hey having been fully=20

discussed, and the frauds of the English duly considered, not one of them w=
as granted. The duke=20

 girls were asked if the=20

accused had shown them his virile member, they answered, =E2=80=9CThis man =
unbuttoned himself and=20

=9D In the face of such affirmations, the accused=20

confessed his crime and was condemned. Other tattoo signs of the grossest e=
mblems of unnatural=20

passion have been found among low prostitutes, pederasts, and tribades.  St=
atistics founded on=20

numerous facts show many cases of tattooing of the penis and even of the la=
bia majora in the=20

lowest order of prostitutes, but these unclean images and revelations of lu=
stful instinct do not=20

occur in the same order of frequency as those noted on the forearm, the del=
toid, or the inferior=20

extremities. So valuable are these marks in their bearing on the class, voc=
ation, character, and=20

tastes of a person that the finding of anchors and ships would indicate a s=
ailor; while flags, sabres,=20

cannon, and other warlike signs would indicate a soldier, etc. It is also n=
oticeable that in the=20

tattooing practised by lunatics the image relates in some way to the nature=
 of the peculiar form of=20

mental disease from which they suffer, and it is chiefly among the more sev=
ere and incurable=20

cases of mental degeneration that these signs are found. (See Dr. Riva=E2=

Even sir Clugnet de Brabant[97], knight of the household to the duke of Orl=

operation, such as severe inflammation, erysipelas, abscess, and gangrene. =
