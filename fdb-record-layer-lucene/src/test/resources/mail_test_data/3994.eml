several years I lived with my uncle, Andrew Swaim, my mother's brother. He =
was good to me, but=20

he had to go out West on business, and he left me in charge of a man named =
Lewis Gabel, who=20

was appointed my guardian.  "This Gabel treated me pretty good at first, fo=
r my uncle sent money=20

regularly for my board. Then, for some reason, the money stopped coming, an=
d Mr. Gabel turned=20

mean. He hardly gave me enough to eat, and I had to work like a horse on hi=
s farm. I wrote to my=20

uncle, but I never got an answer.  "Then, all at once, my uncle began sendi=
ng money again, but he=20

didn't state where he was. After that I had it a little easier, until some =
one stole quite a sum from=20

Mr. Gabel. He's a regular miser, and he loves money more than anything else=
. He accused me of=20

robbing him, and declared he wouldn't have me around his house any longer. =
 "So he sent me off=20

to this school, but he doesn't give me a cent of spending money, and pays a=
ll the bills himself. He=20

still thinks I stole his money, and he says he will hold back my spending c=
ash, which my uncle=20

forwards, until he has made up the amount that was stolen.  "I tried to pro=
ve to him that I was=20

innocent, but he won't believe me. He is always writing me mean letters, re=
minding me that I am a=20

thief, and not fit for decent people to associate with. I'm miserable, and =
I wish I was dead. I got a=20

mean, accusing letter from him to-day, and it made me feel so bad that I di=
dn't care what became=20

of me. I wandered off, and I thought if I fell down and died under the snow=
 it would be a good=20

thing."  "Say, you certainly are up against it," murmured Jack. "I'd like t=
o get hold of that rascally=20

guardian of yours. But why don't you tell your uncle?"  "I can't, for I don=
't know his address."  "But=20

he sends money for your schooling and board to Mr. Gabel, doesn't he?"  "Ye=
s, but he sends cash=20

in a letter, and he doesn't even register it. I ?=20


_
were mailed, but they said they could give me no information."  "What is yo=
ur uncle doing in the=20

West?"  "He is engaged in some secret mission. I never could find out what =
it is, and I don't=20

believe Mr. Gabel knows, either. Oh, but Gabel is a mean man! He seems to t=
ake delight in=20

making me miserable. Now you know why I act so queerly. I like a good time,=
=20


_
but I haven't a cent to spend to treat them with, and I'm not going to acce=
pt favors that I can't=20

return. Why, I haven't had a cent to spend for myself in six months!"  Jack=
 whistled.  "That's=20

tough," he said. "But say, Will, you're mistaken if you think our crowd car=
es anything for money.=20

Why didn't you say something about this before?"  "I--I was ashamed to."  "=
Why, we thought you=20

didn't like us," went on Jack. "Now I see that we were mistaken. I wish we =
had Mr. Gabel here.=20

We'd haze him first, and throw him into the lake afterward. Now, Will, I'll=
 tell you what you're going=20

to do?"  "What?" asked the lad, who seemed much better in spirits, now that=
 he had made a=20

confession.  "In the first place, you're coming to the village with me," sa=
id Jack. "Then you're going=20

to forget all about your troubles and about dying under the snow. Then, whe=
n I get a bundle from=20

home, you're coming back with me, and----"  "Home!" exclaimed Will with a c=
atch in his voice.=20

"How good that word sounds! I--I haven't had a home in so long that--that I=
 don't know what it=20

seems like."  "Well,=20


_
expecting a bundle of good things from my aunt, and when it comes, why, you=
 and me and Nat=20

and Sam and Bony and Fred and Bob, and some other choice spirits, are going=
 to gather in my=20

room to-night, and we're going to have the finest spread you ever saw. I'll=
 make you acquainted=20

with the boys, and then we'll see what happens. No spending money? As if we=
 cared for that!=20

Now, come on, old chap, we'll leg=20


_
it's cold standing here," and clapping Will on the back, Jack linked his ar=
m in that of the new boy=20

and led him back to the road.     CHAPTER VIII  THE MIDNIGHT FEAST   "Well,=
 fellows, are we=20

all here?" asked Jack Ranger later that night, as he gazed around on a crow=
d in his room.  "If=20

there were any=20
