And why when thou enteredst thy garden didst thou not say, 'What God willet=
h[182] [cometh to=20

pass]: there is no power but in God?' If thou seest me to be inferior to th=
ee in amount of wealth=20

and in number of children,  Perhaps my Lord may give me [what will be] bett=
er than thy garden;=20

and may send upon [thine] thunderbolts from heaven, so that it shall become=
 a smooth and=20

slippery ground;  Or its water may become deep-sunk [in the feudalism. The =
weak must always=20

occupy a relatively better position in a compactly organized society than i=
n a democracy of=20

violence; and so the feudal system, retaining for women such small civil ri=
ghts as they already=20

possessed, added a greater personal security.  This was not all. Though the=
 transmission of=20

property, on which all social standing was based, was regularly from male t=
o male, and though=20

female heirs might be passed over=20

ruction_, and he=20

began to turn down the palms of his hands for that which he had expended th=
ereon; for it[s vines=20

were] falling down upon its trellises; and he said, 'O would that I had not=
 associated any one with=20

my Lord!'  And there was no party for him to assist him instead of God, nor=
 was he able to defend=20

himself.  In that case[183] protection [belongeth] unto God, the True; He i=
s the best rewarder and=20

the best giver of success.     (xviii. 31-42.)   LXXXII.  Thou shalt certai=

those who have attributed partners to God[185] the most violent of men in h=
atred of those who=20

have believed; and thou shalt certainly find the nearest of them to friends=
hip to those who have=20

believed those who say, 'We are Christians.' This is because there are amon=
g them priests and=20

monks, and because they are not proud.[186]  And when they hear that which =
hath been sent=20

down unto the Apostle, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of=
 the truth that they=20

know: they say, 'O our Lord, we chicanery, there were exceptions, which bec=

later held to apply particularly to the lands of the crown, and hence to th=

that ecclesiastics, women, and children could perform this service by proxy=

seneschal or baillie.  Though warlike churchmen not infrequently led their =
vassals in person,=20
