charge of Mr. T. W. Alexander, a man who has had at least twenty-five years' experience in 

institutional work, well qualified to fill the position of chief steward of the prison. All supplies are 

ordered for the prison through this department and upon receipt are carefully checked to ascertain 

if they comply with specifications.  Supplies are issued from this departemnt on the 5th, 15th and 

25th of each month, the heads of the several departments making out requisitions therefor, 

countersigned by the warden. Prison supplies are purchased quarterly through the State Board of 

Control. Whenever any articles are issued to a department duplicate vouchers are made out, one 

retained by the steward and the other signed by the recipient and in Salt and Water; but as for the 

Mussels, they must every one be carefully look'd into, and discharg'd from that part which is call'd 

the Beard, and also particular care must be taken to examine whether there are any Crabs in 

them, for they are very poisonous, and as they lie in the Mouth of the Mussel, may easily be 

discover'd; they are commonly as large as a Pea, and of the shape of a Sea-Crab, but are 

properly Sea-Spiders: the Mussels however where you find them, are not unwholesome, and it is 

only the eating of this little Animal, which has been the occasion of People's swelling after they 

had eaten Mussels, but the goodness of the Fish is well enough worth the Care of looking after 

that. When your Mussels or Cockles are all clean pick'd and wash'd, lay them to cool; and when 

their Liquor is well fettled, pour off the Clear, and boil it up with the same

administration building, and sees that they are kept clean and in proper order. He is responsible 

for all the property under his charge.                                  THE FEMALE WARD   On an average 

there are ten females in the matron's ward. This department is mentioned above for the pickled 

Oysters, with the same proportion of Vinegar; and letting it stand till it is quite cold, put your Fish 

into proper Pots, or little Barrels, and pour the Liquor upon them till they are cover'd with it, and 

stop them up close: they will keep good two or three Months, if the Liquor is now and then boiled 

up, but it must
