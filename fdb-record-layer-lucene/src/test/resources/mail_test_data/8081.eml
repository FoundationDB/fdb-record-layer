making this request, they engaged to give up some of their friends as hosta=

serve him loyally and faithfully against the king of England; but in a shor=
t time they received a=20

negative to their demand, and returned home without any aid from the king o=
f France.  Another=20

war broke out between the dukes of Bar and Lorraine; and sir Clugnet de Bra=
bant, admiral of=20

France, was sent thither with a large army. He marched it through Champagne=
 to Lorraine, and=20

besieged Neuf Chastel, belonging to the duke, which instantly surrendered t=
o the king, by the=20

advice of Ferry de Lorraine[99], count Continental writers, and even by one=
 in the city of Mexico,=20

Dr. Jose Ramos.[593] For instance, it is pretended that cataract is more co=
mmon among jewellers=20

because of the fineness of their work; yet out of 952 cataracts, of which a=
 record has been kept,=20

only two cases occurred in jewellers. Besides, there is not one special sig=
n or physical trace left on=20

the body by which a prostitute may be known, notwithstanding the fact that =
in life the collective=20

appearance would seldom deceive an experienced man.  Only in the case of so=

ke excuses for what=20

had passed, who negotiated so successfully that the king was satisfied, and=
 remanded his army,=20

which, in going and coming back, committed great waste in all the countries=
 through which they=20

passed.  The duke of Burgundy, accompanied by his two brothers and many gre=
at lords, went to=20

the town of Arras, where his duchess and his daughters were waiting for him=
. Shortly after, the=20

count de Cleves came thither, and was married to Marie, daughter to the duk=
e; and, on the=20

morrow, the count de Penthievre[100] espoused another, called Isabella. The=
 town of Arras was=20

very gay with the numerous feasts caused by these weddings.  Some days afte=
r, the duke of=20

Limbourg and the two Dr. Coutagne[594] found the signs of post-perineal coi=
tus in 180. He cites=20

the case of a young prostitute presenting the astonishing contrast of a gap=
ing anus surrounded by=20

characteristic rhagades, with the genital parts of an extreme freshness, a =
very narrow vagina, and=20

non-retracted hymen, constituting by their reunion a still firm ring. A fac=
t yet more curious is shown=20

by a specimen in the collection of the museum of the laboratory of legal me=
dicine at Lyons. The=20

genital organs of the cadaver of a woman of twenty-eight or thirty years sh=
owed a hymen intact=20

and firm, but on examining the anal region it was surprising to find an inf=
undibuliform deformity=20

with all the signs of sodomitical habits, which of course rectified the opi=
nion that had been made=20

regarding=20

having enjoyed much festivity, took their leaves of the duke and duchess of=
 Burgundy, and=20

returned to their own homes.  At this period, the duke William, count of Ha=
inault, nobly=20

accompanied by his Hainaulters, went to Paris, where he was most handsomely=
 received by the=20

king, queen, and all the princes then there.  During his stay  Many of the =
signs enumerated as=20

peculiar to different callings have no special anatomical characteristic th=
at is easy to distinguish=20

with precision, consequently they do not present a degree of certainty or c=
onstancy sufficient to be=20

invoked as strong medico-legal proof of identity. Moreover, the effects of =
time or treatment may=20

proclaimed throughout the town, that no one, whether ecclesiastic or layman=
, should in future pay=20

any tax or subsidy to pope Benedict, nor to such as favoured his pretension=
s. This was likewise=20

forbidden through the kingdom of France, which caused much perplexity to ma=
ny well meaning=20

persons in that realm from this schism in the church.                      =
            CHAP. XXVIII.      THE=20

RMY TO=20

ACQUITAINE, AND BESIEGES BLAYE AND LE         BOURG.   This year, the duke =
of Orleans,=20

by orders from the king, quitted Paris to march a large army of men at arms=
 and archers,=20

amounting to six alteration or disappearance of many of the signs in questi=
on, which would at best=20

be of negative rather than of absolute value.  To arrive at an impartial ap=
preciation of the relative=20

value of the professional stigmata as signs of identity, a certain number o=
f the signs should be=20

thrown aside as illusory. Others, on the contrary, are durable, special, an=
d constant, and assist in=20

establishing the identity accordingly as the lesions or alterations are com=
plete or evident; but it=20

should be borne in mind that the physical alterations and chemical modifica=
tions resulting from the=20

exercise of certain trades are not in our country so important from a=20
