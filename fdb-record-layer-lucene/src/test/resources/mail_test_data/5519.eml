in social conditions since the age of the early Capetians. These changes we=
re, fortunately, all in the direction of amelioration; for the civilization=
 of France, of Europe, was taking long strides during the _
Himyaritic dialect 'blind,' some suppose that Sho'eyb was so, and that the =
Midianites objected that=20

to him as a defect which disqualified him for the prophetic office.--S.  [2=
55] Which of the kings of=20

Egypt this Pharaoh of Moses was is uncertain. Not to mention the opinions o=
f the European=20

writers, those of the East generally suppose him to have been El-Weleed, wh=
o according to some=20

was an Arab of the tribe of 'Ad, or according to others the son of Mus'ab t=
he son of Er-Reiyan the=20

son of El-Weleed the Amalekite. There are historians, however, who suppose =
Kaboos the brother=20

and predecessor of El-Weleed was the prince we are speaking of, and pretend=
 he lived six=20

hundred and twenty years and reigned four hundred. Which is more reasonable=
, at least, than the=20

opinion of those who imagine it was his father Mus'ab or grandfather Er-Rei=
yan. Abu-l-Fida says=20

the Mus'ab, being one hundred and seventy years old and having no child, wh=
ile he kept the herds=20

saw a cow calve, and heard her say at the same time, 'O Mus'ab, be not grie=
ved, for thou shalt=20

have a wicked son, who will be at length cast into hell.' And he accordingl=
y had this Weleed, who=20

afterwards coming to be king of Egypt proved an impious tyrant.--S. (A.F., =
Z.)  [256] This name is=20

given to Pharaoh's chief minister; from whence it is generally inferred tha=
t Mohammad had been=20

made Haman the favorite of Ahasuerus king of Persia, and who indisputably l=
ived many years=20

after Moses, to be that prophet's contemporary.--S.  [257] It is related th=
at the midwife appointed=20

to attend the Hebrew women, terrified by a light which appeared between the=
 eyes of Moses at his=20

birth, and touched with an extraordinary affection for the child, did not d=
iscover him to the officers,=20

so that his mother kept him in her house, and nursed him three months; afte=
r which it was=20

impossible for her to conceal him any longer, the king then giving orders t=
o make the searches=20

more strictly.--S. (B.)  [258] The commentators say that his mother made an=
 ark of the papyrus,=20

and pitched it, and put in some cotton; and having laid the child therein, =
committed it to the river, a=20

branch of which went into Pharaoh's garden: that the stream carried the ark=
 thither into a fishpond,=20

at the head of which Pharaoh was then sitting with his wife Asiyeh the daug=
hter of Muzahem; and=20

that the king, having commanded it to be taken up and opened, and finding i=
n it a beautiful child,=20

took a fancy to it, and ordered it to be brought up.--Some writers mention =
a miraculous=20

preservation of Moses before he was put into the ark; and tell us, that his=
 mother having hid him=20

from Pharaoh's officers in an oven, his sister, in her mother's absence, ki=
ndled a large fire in the=20

oven to heat it, not knowing the child was there; but that he was afterward=
s taken out unhurt.--S.=20

(B., A.F.)  [259] Kur. xxvi. 17.  [260] This person, says the tradition, wa=
s an Egyptian and=20

Pharaoh's uncle's son.--S.  [261] The Jews pretend he was actually imprison=
ed for the fact, and=20

condemned to be beheaded; but that when he should have suffered his neck be=
came as hard as=20

ivory, and the sword rebounded on return to the paths of duty and relinquis=
h his "concubine",=20

Agnes de Meranie. He urged Philippe's spiritual adviser to bring him to rea=
son by pious=20

exhortation. All else failing, he sent Cardinal Pierre of Capua as a specia=
l legate, with injunctions=20

to present the Church's ultimatum to the king: he must either take Ingeburg=
e back at once, with all=20

honor, as his lawful consort, or the entire kingdom would be put under inte=
rdict. The legate=20

pleaded and threatened in vain; after a year of exasperating evasion the ki=
ng was still not=20

obedient. The legate at last summoned a council and pronounced the interdic=
t, all the prelates=20

receiving stringent orders to observe it under pain of suspension. From Dec=
ember, 1199, to=20

September, 1200, France was under a general interdict.  In the case of Bert=
ha and Robert, the=20

ecclesiastical censures had affected only the guilty couple; in the case of=
 Bertrade and Philippe I.,=20



only the places inhabited by them had been smitten. But the Church had now =
grown stronger; now=20

the whole kingdom was to suffer because of the recalcitrant king. Everywher=
e religious services=20

ceased, for the clergy were in sympathy with or afraid of the vigorous stat=
esman now in the papal=20

chair. The churches were closed, the altars dismantled, the crosses reverse=
d, the bells silent, as=20

during the solemn days in memory of Christ's Passion. The accustomed religi=
ous exercises=20

ceased; but that was only a small part of the horror, for no more sacrament=
s, save extreme=20

unction and baptism of infants, could be celebrated. There were no marriage=
s: when the king=20

wished to marry his son to the young Blanche de Castille he was obliged to =
go into Normandy, into=20

English territory, to have the ceremony performed. There were no more funer=
als, for the Pope=20

forbade burials, whether in hallowed or in unhallowed ground: the air was f=
illed with the pestilential=20

stench from unburied corpses. The voice of the people rose in wrath against=
 their impious king; it=20

was he who was bringing all this woe upon the land. Philippe and Agnes live=
d on, she happy in the=20

love of her king, and in her children, Philippe and Marie, he stubbornly re=
sistant. He deprived=20

bishops of their sees and sequestered their goods; he punished even laymen =
for daring to take the=20

side of the Pope. But at last he must yield, for his people would endure no=
 more.  Ingeburge was=20

taken back as wife and queen, being at last released from the chateau of Et=
ampes where she had=20

been confined. But the king, deeply in love with Agnes, declared that this =
recognition of Ingeburge=20

was only provisional, since he meant to appeal once more to Rome for an ann=
ulment of the=20

marriage. The fair Agnes, the victim of these unfortunate circumstances, di=
d not long survive the=20

separation from Philippe, whose passionate love she returned. A few weeks l=
ater she died at=20

Poissi, giving birth to a short-lived son named Tristan, the pledge of his =
mother's sorrows. She had=20

given Philippe two children before this, and, though her union with the kin=
g had been stigmatized=20

as immoral by the Church, the Pope recognized the legitimacy of the offspri=
ng in=20


_
executioner.--S.  [262] According to El-Beydawee, Moses knew not the way, a=
nd, coming to a=20

place where three roads met, committed himself to the guidance of God, and =
took the middle road,=20

which was the right; Providence likewise so ordering it that his pursuers t=
ook the other two roads,=20

and missed him.--S.  [263] This was Safoora [also called Safoorah and Safoo=
riya, or Zipporah, the=20

elder, or as others suppose the younger, daughter of Sho'eyb, whom Moses af=
terwards married.--

S.]   [264] The commentators say, that Moses, having obtained leave of Sho'=
eyb or Jethro, his=20

father-in-law, to visit his mother, departed with his family from Midian to=
wards Egypt; but coming to=20

the valley of Tuwa, wherein Mount Sinai stands, his wife fell in labour and=
 was delivered of a son=20

in a very dark and snowy night: he had also lost his way, and his cattle we=
re scattered from him,=20

when on a sudden he saw a fire by the side of a mountain, which on his near=
er approach he found=20

burning in a green bush.--S. (B.)  [265] This was a mark of humility and re=
spect: though some=20

fancy there was some uncleanness in the shoes themselves, because they were=
 made of the skin=20

of an ass not 1201. It was her son Philippe, surnamed Hurepel, who became C=
ount de Boulogne,=20

and played no pleasing role under Blanche de Castille.  The death of Agnes =
de Meranie did not=20

tend to soften Philippe's feelings toward Ingeburge. She was imprisoned ane=
w, and treated with=20

every indignity that could be devised, short of calling down again the wrat=
h of Pope Innocent. For=20

eleven years she was treated in this way, and was constantly urged, by entr=
eaties and threats, to=20

take the veil, while Philippe was continuing his efforts to have the marria=
ge annulled. In 1212,=20

however, Philippe had need of the friendship of Rome. Ingeburge was again t=
aken from her prison=20

at Etampes and received at court: the victory of the Pope was complete, as =
far as the letter of the=20

law was concerned. There was never any love between the royal pair, and cou=
ld not be; for=20

between them stood the sad ghost of Agnes de Meranie to incite Ingeburge to=
 jealousy and=20

Philippe to fresh aversion.  Ingeburge could never have been happy with Phi=
lippe, though he=20

treated her more considerately and fairly during the last years of his life=
. When her husband died,=20

in 1223, and his son Louis VIII. came to the=20


_
[266] Which was at first no bigger than the rod, but afterwards swelled to =
a prodigious size.--S. (B.)=20

[267] When Moses saw the serpent move about with great nimbleness and swall=
ow stones and=20

trees, he was greatly terrified, and fled from it; but recovering his coura=
ge at these words of God,=20

he had the boldness to take the serpent by the jaws.--S. (B.)  [268] Moses =
had an impediment in=20

his speech, which was occasioned by the following accident. Pharaoh one day=
 carrying him in his=20

arms when a child, he suddenly laid hold of his beard and plucked it in a v=
ery rough manner,=20

which put Pharaoh into such a passion that he ordered him to be put to deat=
h: but Asiyeh his wife=20

representing to him that he was but a child, who could not distinguish betw=
een a burning coal and=20

a ruby, he ordered the experiment to be made; and a live coal and a ruby be=
ing set before native=20

land. We hear, henceforth, almost nothing of her; there was no role for a d=
owager queen,=20

especially one who was a foreigner associated with most distressing events =
for France. We do find=20

her name as one of the notabilities in the solemn procession which, on Augu=
st 2, 1224, went from=20

the cathedral of Notre Dame to the Abbey of St. Antoine, to ask of the Lord=
 of Hosts for a victory=20

for the arms of Louis VIII. at Rochelle. Now and again her name occurs in t=
he accounts of the=20

royal household while that careful economist, Blanche de Castille, is gover=
ning France. She is=20

called "la reine d'Orleans," because she lived at Orleans, part of the doma=
in reserved to her as=20

Queen Dowager. Here she lived quietly, and let us hope not unhappily, till =
her death in 1237. She=20

lived in the midst of great events in which she could take no part; and onl=
y her sorrows have=20
