 not enjoy herself. The=20

motor drive was one of the loveliest in Italy. They passed through glorious=
 scenery, all the more=20

beautiful as it was the blossoming time of the year and flowers were everyw=
here. On a marshy=20

plain, as they reached Paestum, the fields were spangled with the little wh=
ite wild narcissus,=20

growing in such tempting quantities that Miss Morley asked the driver to st=
op the char-a-banc, and=20

violent that it is impossible to describe the nature of the feeling they ex=

having ever received from the discharge of a large Leyden jar, a more dread=
ful shock than that=20

which I experienced by imprudently placing both my feet on a gymnotus just =
taken out of the=20

water. I was affected during the rest of the day with a violent pain in the=
 knees, and in almost=20

every joint. To be aware of the difference that exists between the sensatio=
n produced by the=20

Voltaic battery and an electric fish, the latter should be touched when the=
y are in a state of=20

extreme weakness. The gymnoti and the torpedos then cause a twitching of th=
e muscles, which is=20

"Luscious!" agreed Mrs. Clark. "I think the old Greeks must have gathered t=
hese to weave=20

garlands for their heads when they went to their festivals. I'm glad touris=

Don't look frightened. The government have put all that down at last. The n=

 at every stroke, an=20

Accordingly, the Tamanac Indians call the gymnotus, in their expressive lan=
guage, arimna, which=20

means something that deprives of motion.  The sensation caused by the feebl=

electric eel appeared to me analogous to that painful twitching with which =
I have been seized at=20

each contact of two heterogeneous metals applied to wounds which I had made=
 on my back by=20

means of cantharides. This difference of sensation between the effects of e=
lectric fishes and those=20

of a Voltaic battery or a Leyden jar feebly charged has struck every observ=
er; there is, however,=20

nothing in this contrary to the supposition of the identity of electricity =
and the galvanic action of=20

fishes. The electricity may be the same; but its effects will be variously =
modified by the disposition=20

of the electrical apparatus, by the intensity of the fluid, by the rapidity=
 of the current, and by the=20
