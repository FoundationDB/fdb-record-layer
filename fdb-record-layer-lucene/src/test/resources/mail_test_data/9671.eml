they may go barefoot.     CHAPTER V  THE DECADENCE OF FRESCO PAINTING   1. =
For the=20

other apartments, that is, those intended to be used in Spring, Autumn, and=
 Summer, as well as=20

for atriums and peristyles, the ancients required realistic pictures of rea=
l things. A picture is, in fact,=20

a representation of a thing which really exists or which can exist: for exa=
mple, a man, a house, a=20

ship, or anything else from whose definite and actual structure copies rese=
mbling it can be taken.=20

Consequently the ancients who introduced polished finishings began by repre=
senting different=20

kinds of marble slabs in different positions, and then cornices and blocks =
of yellow ochre arranged=20

in various ways.  2. Afterwards they made such progress as to represent the=
 forms of buildings,=20

and of columns, and projecting and overhanging pediments; in their open roo=
ms, such as exedrae,=20

on account of the size, they depicted the facades of scenes in the tragic, =
comic, or satyric style;=20

and their walks, on account of the great length, they decorated with a vari=
ety of landscapes,=20

copying the characteristics of definite spots. In these paintings there are=
 harbours, promontories,=20

seashores, rivers, fountains, straits, fanes, groves, mountains, flocks, sh=
epherds; in some places=20

there are also pictures designed in the grand style, with figures of the go=
ds or detailed=20

mythological episodes, or the battles at Troy, or the wanderings of Ulysses=
, with landscape=20

backgrounds, and other subjects reproduced on similar principles from real =
life.  3. But those=20

subjects which were copied from actual realities are scorned in these days =
of bad taste. We now=20

have fresco paintings of monstrosities, rather than truthful representation=
s of definite things. For=20

instance, reeds are put in the place of columns, fluted appendages with cur=
ly leaves and volutes,=20

instead of pediments, candelabra supporting representations of shrines, and=
 on top of their=20

pediments numerous tender stalks and volutes growing up from the roots and =
having human=20

figures senselessly seated upon them; sometimes stalks having only half-len=
gth figures, some with=20

human heads, others with the heads of animals.  4. Such things do not exist=
 and cannot exist and=20

never have existed. Hence, it is the new taste that has caused bad judges o=
f poor art to prevail=20

over true artistic excellence. For how is it possible that a reed should re=
ally support a roof, or a=20

candelabrum a pediment with its ornaments, or that such a slender, flexible=
 thing as a stalk should=20

support a figure perched upon it, or that roots and stalks should produce n=
ow flowers and now=20

half-length figures? Yet when people see these frauds, they find no fault w=
ith them but on the=20

contrary are delighted, and do not care whether any of them can exist or no=
t. Their understanding=20

is darkened by decadent critical principles, so that it is not capable of g=
iving its approval=20

authoritatively and on the principle of propriety to that which really can =
exist. The fact is that=20

pictures which are unlike reality ought not to be approved, and even if the=
y are technically fine, this=20

is no reason why they should offhand be judged to be correct, if their subj=
ect is lacking in the=20

principles of reality carried out with no violations.  5. For instance, at =
Tralles, Apaturius of=20

Alabanda designed with skilful hand the scaena of the little theatre which =
is there called the=20

[Greek: ekklesiasterion], representing columns in it and statues, Centaurs =
supporting the=20

architraves, rotundas with round roofs on them, pediments with overhanging =
returns, and cornices=20

ornamented with lions' heads, which are meant for nothing but the rainwater=
 from the roofs,--and=20

then on top of it all he made an episcaenium in which were painted rotundas=
, porticoes, half-

pediments, and all the different kinds of decoration employed in a roof. Th=
e effect of high relief in=20

this scaena was very attractive to all who beheld it, and they were ready t=
o give their approval to=20



the work, when Licymnius the mathematician came forward and said that (6.) =
the Alabandines=20

were considered bright enough in all matters of politics, but that on accou=
nt of one slight defect,=20

the lack of the sense of propriety, they were believed to be unintelligent.=
 "In their gymnasium the=20

statues are all pleading causes, in their forum, throwing the discus, runni=
ng, or playing ball. This=20

disregard of propriety in the interchange of statues appropriate to differe=
nt places has brought the=20

state as a whole into disrepute. Let us then beware lest this scaena of Apa=
turius make=20

Alabandines or Abderites of us. Which of you can have houses or columns or =
extensive pediments=20

on top of his tiled roof? Such things are built above the floors, not above=
 the tiled roofs. Therefore,=20

if we give our approval to pictures of things which can have no reason for =
existence in actual fact,=20

we shall be voluntarily associating ourselves with those communities which =
are believed to be=20

unintelligent on account of just such defects."  7. Apaturius did not ventu=
re to make any answer,=20

but removed the scaena, altered it so that it conformed to reality, and gav=
e satisfaction with it in its=20

improved state. Would to God that Licymnius could come to life again and re=
form the present=20

condition of folly and mistaken practices in fresco painting! However, it m=
ay not be out of place to=20

explain why this false method prevails over the truth. The fact is that the=
 artistic excellence which=20

the ancients endeavoured to attain by working hard and taking pains, is now=
 attempted by the use=20

of colours and the brave show which they make, and expenditure by the emplo=
yer prevents people=20

from missing the artistic refinements that once lent authority to works.  t=
hey settle by studying=20

monographs on the subject, but not by way of scientific investigation or ex=
periment, though that=20

method is at their disposal and is more in keeping with their calling. They=
 gladly become ward-

surgeons, assistants, demonstrators, external teachers, and are ready to fi=
ll such posts until they=20

are forty, though independence, a sense of freedom and personal initiative,=
 are no less necessary=20

in science than, for instance, in art or commerce. I have pupils and listen=
ers, but no successors=20

and helpers, and so I love them and am touched by them, but am not proud of=
 them. And so on,=20

and so on....  Such shortcomings, however numerous they may be, can only gi=
ve rise to a=20

pessimistic or fault-finding temper in a faint-hearted and timid man. All t=
hese failings have a=20

casual, transitory character, and are completely dependent on conditions of=
 life; in some ten years=20

they will have disappeared or given place to other fresh defects, which are=
 all inevitable and will in=20

their turn alarm the faint-hearted. The students' sins often vex me, but th=
at vexation is nothing in=20

comparison with the joy I have been experiencing now for the last thirty ye=
ars when I talk to my=20

pupils, lecture to them, watch their relations, and compare them with peopl=
e not of their circle.=20

Mihail Fyodorovitch speaks evil of everything. Katya listens, and neither o=
f them notices into what=20

depths the apparently innocent diversion of finding fault with their neighb=
ours is gradually drawing=20

them. They are not conscious how by degrees simple talk passes into malicio=
us mockery and=20

jeering, and how they are both beginning to drop into the habits and method=
s of slander.  "Killing=20

types one meets with," says Mihail Fyodorovitch. "I went yesterday to our f=
riend Yegor=20

Petrovitch's, and there I found a studious gentleman, one of your medicals =
in his third year, I=20

believe. Such a face!... in the Dobrolubov style, the imprint of profound t=
hought on his brow; we=20

got into talk. 'Such doings, young man,' said I. 'I've read,' said I, 'that=
 some German--I've forgotten=20

his name--has created from the human brain a new kind of alkaloid, idiotine=
.' What do you think?=20

He believed it, and there was positively an expression of respect on his fa=
ce, as though to say,=20

'See what we fellows can do!' And the other day I went to the theatre. I to=
ok my seat. In the next=20



row directly in front of me were sitting two men: one of 'us fellows' and a=
pparently a law student,=20

the other a shaggy-looking figure, a medical student. The latter was as dru=
nk as a cobbler. He did=20

not look at the stage at all. He was dozing with his nose on his shirt-fron=
t. But as soon as an actor=20

begins loudly reciting a monologue, or simply raises his voice, our friend =
starts, pokes his=20

neighbour in the ribs, and asks, 'What is he saying? Is it elevating?' 'Yes=
,' answers one of our=20

fellows. 'B-r-r-ravo!' roars the medical student. 'Elevating! Bravo!' He ha=
d gone to the theatre, you=20

see, the drunken blockhead, not for the sake of art, the play, but for elev=
ation! He wanted noble=20

sentiments."  Katya listens and laughs. She has a strange laugh; she catche=
s her breath in=20

rhythmically regular gasps, very much as though she were playing the accord=
ion, and nothing in=20

her face is laughing but her nostrils. I grow depressed and don't know what=
 to say. Beside myself,=20

I fire up, leap up from my seat, and cry:  "Do leave off! Why are you sitti=
ng here like two toads,=20

poisoning the air with your breath? Give over!"  And without waiting for th=
em to finish their gossip I=20

prepare to go home. And, indeed, it is high time: it is past ten.  "I will =
stay a little longer," says=20

Mihail Fyodorovitch. "Will you allow me, Ekaterina Vladimirovna?"  "I will,=
" answers Katya.=20

"_Bene!_ In that case have up another little bottle."  They both accompany =
me with candles to the=20

hall, and while I put on my fur coat, Mihail Fyodorovitch says:  "You have =
grown dreadfully thin and=20

older looking, Nikolay Stepanovitch. What's the matter with you? Are you il=
l?"  "Yes; I am not very=20

well."  "And you are not doing anything for it..." Katya puts in grimly.  "=
Why don't you? You can't go=20

on like that! God helps those who help themselves, my dear fellow. Remember=
 me to your wife=20

and daughter, and make my apologies for not having been to see them. In a d=
ay or two, before I=20

go abroad, I shall come to say good-bye. I shall be sure to. I am going awa=
y next week."  I come=20

away from Katya, irritated and alarmed by what has been said about my being=
 ill, and dissatisfied=20

with myself. I ask myself whether I really ought not to consult one of my c=
olleagues. And at once I=20

imagine how my colleague, after listening to me, would walk away to the win=
dow without speaking,=20

would think a moment, then would turn round to me and, trying to prevent my=
 reading the truth in=20

his face, would say in a careless tone: "So far I see nothing serious, but =
at the same time,=20

_collega_, I advise you to lay aside your work...." And that would deprive =
me of my last hope.=20

Who is without hope? Now that I am diagnosing my illness and prescribing fo=
r myself, from time to=20

time I hope that I am deceived by my own illness, that I am mistaken in reg=
ard to the albumen and=20

the sugar I find, and in regard to my heart, and in regard to the swellings=
 I have twice noticed in=20

the mornings; when with the fervour of the hypochondriac I look through the=
 textbooks of=20

therapeutics and take a different medicine every day, I keep fancying that =
I shall hit upon=20

something comforting. All that is petty.  Whether the sky is covered with c=
louds or the moon and=20

the stars are shining, I turn my eyes towards it every evening and think th=
at death is taking me=20

soon. One would think that my thoughts at such times ought to be deep as th=
e sky, brilliant,=20

striking.... But no! I think about=20


_
vermilion otherwise than sparingly, like a drug? But today whole walls are =
commonly covered with=20

it everywhere. Then, too, there is malachite green, purple, and Armenian bl=
ue. When these=20

colours are laid on, they present a brilliant appearance to the eye even al=
though they are=20

inartistically applied, and as they are costly, they are made exceptions in=
 contracts, to be furnished=20

by the employer, not by the contractor.  I have now sufficiently explained =
all that I could suggest=20

for the avoidance of mistakes in stucco work. Next, I shall speak of the co=
mponents as they occur=20

to me, and first I shall treat of marble, since I spoke of lime at the begi=
nning.     CHAPTER VI=20

MARBLE FOR USE IN STUCCO   Marble is not produced everywhere of the same ki=
nd. In some=20

places the lumps are found to contain transparent grains like salt, and thi=
s kind when crushed and=20

ground is extremely serviceable in stucco work. In places where this is not=
 found, the broken bits=20

of marble or "chips," as they are called, which marble-workers throw down a=
s they work, may be=20

crushed and ground and used in stucco after being sifted. In still other pl=
aces--for example, on the=20

borderland of Magnesia and Ephesus--there are places where it can be dug ou=
t all ready to use,=20

without the need of grinding or sifting, but as fine as any that is crushed=
 and sifted by hand.=20

CHAPTER VII  NATURAL COLOURS   As for colours, some are natural products fo=
und in fixed=20

places, and dug up there, while others are artificial compounds of differen=
t substances treated and=20

mixed in proper proportions so as to be equally serviceable.  1. We shall f=
irst set forth the natural=20

colours that are dug up as such, like yellow ochre, which is termed [Greek:=
 ochra] in Greek. This is=20

found in many places, including Italy, but Attic, which was the best, is no=
t now to be had because=20

in the times when there were slaves in the Athenian silver mines, they woul=
d dig galleries=20

underground in order to find the silver. Whenever a vein of ochre was found=
 there, they would=20

follow it up like silver, and so the ancients general; my thoughts are evil=
, petty, I am insincere with=20

myself, and at such times my theory of life may be expressed in the words t=
he celebrated=20

Araktcheev said in one of his intimate letters: "Nothing good can exist in =
the world without evil, and=20

there is more evil than good." That is, everything is disgusting; there is =
nothing to live for, and the=20

sixty-two years I have already lived must be reckoned as wasted. I catch my=
self in these thoughts,=20

and try to persuade myself that they are accidental, temporary, and not dee=
ply rooted in me, but at=20

once I think:  "If so, what drives me every evening to those two toads?"  A=
nd I vow to myself that I=20

will never go to Katya's again, though I know I shall go next evening.  Rin=
ging the bell at the door=20

and going upstairs, I feel that I have no family now and no desire to bring=
 it back again. It is clear=20

that the new Araktcheev thoughts are not casual, temporary visitors, but ha=
ve possession of my=20

whole being. With my conscience ill at ease, dejected, languid, hardly able=
 to move my limbs,=20

feeling as though tons were added to my weight, I get into bed and quickly =
drop asleep.  And then-

-insomnia!  IV  Summer comes on and life is changed.  One fine morning Liza=
 comes in to me and=20

says in a jesting tone:  "Come, your Excellency! We are ready."  My Excelle=
ncy is conducted into=20

the street, and seated in a cab. As I go along, having nothing to do, I rea=
d the signboards from=20

right to left. The word "Traktir" reads "Ritkart"; that would just suit som=
e baron's family: Baroness=20

Ritkart. Farther on I drive through fields, by the graveyard, which makes a=
bsolutely no impression=20

on me, though I shall soon lie in it; then I drive by forests and again by =
fields. There is nothing of=20

interest. After two hours of driving, my Excellency is conducted into the l=
ower storey of a summer=20

villa and installed in a small, very cheerful little room with light blue h=
angings.  At night there is=20

sleeplessness as before, but in the morning I do not put a good face upon i=
t and listen to my wife,=20



but lie in bed. I do not sleep, but=20


_
use in the polished finishings of their stucco work.  2. Red earths are fou=
nd in abundance in many=20

places, but the best in only a few, for instance at Sinope in Pontus, in Eg=
ypt, in the Balearic=20

islands of Spain, as well as in Lemnos, an island the enjoyment of whose re=
venues the Senate=20

and Roman people granted to the Athenians.  3. Paraetonium white gets its n=
ame from the place=20

where it is dug up. The same is the case with Melian white, because there i=
s said to be a mine of it=20

in Melos, one of the islands of the Cyclades.  4. Green chalk is found in n=
umerous places, but the=20

best at Smyrna. The Greeks call it [Greek: theodoteion], because this kind =
of chalk was first found=20

on the estate of a person named Theodotus.  5. Orpiment, which is termed [G=
reek: arsenikon] in=20

Greek, is dug up in Pontus. Sandarach, in many places, but the best is mine=
d in Pontus close by=20

the river Hypanis.     CHAPTER VIII  CINNABAR AND QUICKSILVER   1. I shall =
now proceed to=20

explain the nature of cinnabar. It is said that it was first found in the C=
ilbian country belonging to=20

Ephesus, and both it and its properties are certainly very strange. First, =
before getting to the=20

vermilion itself by methods of treatment, they dig out what is called the c=
lod, an ore like iron, but=20

rather of a reddish colour and covered with a red dust. During the digging =
it sheds, under the=20

blows of the tools, tear after tear of quicksilver, which is at once gather=
ed up by the diggers.  2.=20

When these clods have been collected, they are so full of moisture that the=
y are thrown into an=20

oven in the laboratory to dry, and the fumes that are sent up from them by =
the heat of the fire=20

settle down on the floor of the oven, and are found to be quicksilver. When=
 the clods are taken out,=20

the drops which remain are so small that they cannot be gathered up, but th=
ey are swept into a=20

vessel of water, you are not asleep, but dreaming. At midday I get up and f=
rom habit sit down at=20

my table, but I do not work now; I amuse myself with French books in yellow=
 covers, sent me by=20

Katya. Of course, it would be more patriotic to read Russian authors, but I=
 must confess I cherish=20

no particular liking for them. With the exception of two or three of the ol=
der writers, all our literature=20

of today strikes me as not being literature, but a special sort of home ind=
ustry, which exists simply=20

in order to be encouraged, though people do not readily make use of its pro=
ducts. The very best of=20

these home products cannot be called remarkable and cannot be sincerely pra=
ised without=20

qualification. I must say the same of all the literary novelties I have rea=
d during the last ten or=20

fifteen years; not one of them is remarkable, and not one of them can be pr=
aised without a "but."=20

Cleverness, a good tone, but no talent; talent, a good tone, but no clevern=
ess; or talent,=20

cleverness, but not a good tone.  I don't say the French books have talent,=
 cleverness, and a good=20

tone. They don't satisfy me, either. But they are not so tedious as the Rus=
sian, and it is not=20

unusual to find in them the chief element of artistic creation--the feeling=
 of personal freedom which=20

is lacking in the Russian authors. I don't remember one new book in which t=
he author does not try=20

from the first page to entangle himself in all sorts of conditions and cont=
racts with his conscience.=20

One is afraid to speak of the naked body; another ties himself up hand and =
foot in psychological=20

analysis; a third must have a "warm attitude to man"; a fourth purposely sc=
rawls whole=20

descriptions of nature that he may not be suspected of writing with a purpo=
se.... One is bent upon=20

being middle-class in his work, another must be a nobleman, and so on. Ther=
e is intentionalness,=20

circumspection, and self-will,=20


_
run together and combine into one. Four pints of it, when measured and weig=
hed, will be found to=20

be one hundred pounds.  3. If the quicksilver is poured into a vessel, and =
a stone weighing one=20

hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot =
depress the liquid, nor=20

break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and =
put on a scruple of=20

gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Henc=
e, it is undeniable that the=20

nor the manliness to write as they like, and therefore there is no creative=
ness.  All this applies to=20

what is called belles-lettres.  As for serious treatises in Russian on soci=
ology, for instance, on art,=20

and so on, I do not read them simply from timidity. In my childhood and ear=
ly youth I had for some=20

reason a terror of doorkeepers and attendants at the theatre, and that terr=
or has remained with me=20

to this day. I am afraid of them even now. It is said that we are only afra=
id of what we do=20
