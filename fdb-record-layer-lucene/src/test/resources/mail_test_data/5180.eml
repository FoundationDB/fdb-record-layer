game as I want, I can at least watch my offspring taking their joy out of i=
t. God be thanked for=20

giving us our children! We can still rest our tired old eyes on them, just =
as the polisher of precious=20

stones used to keep an emerald in front of him, to relieve his strained vis=
ion by gazing at its soft=20

and soothing greenness.  I have just crept in to take a look at my precious=
 Dinkie, fast asleep in=20

the old cast-iron crib that is growing so small for him he has to lie cater=
cornered on his mattress.=20

He seemed so big, stretched out there, that he frightened me with the thoug=
ht he couldn't be a=20

child much longer. There are no babies left now in my home circle. And I st=
ill have a shamefaced=20

sort of hankering to hold a baby in my arms again!     _Wednesday the Thirt=
y-First_   Susie has=20

promised to stay with us until after Christmas. And the holidays, I realize=
, are only a few weeks=20

away. Struthers is knitting a sweater of flaming red and rather grimly ackn=
owledged, when I pinned=20

her down, that it was for Whinstane Sandy. There was a snow-flurry Sunday, =
and Gershom took=20

Susie riding in the old cutter, scratching grittily along the half-covered =
trails but apparently enjoying=20

it. My poor little Poppsy, who rather idolizes Gershom, is transparently je=
alous of his attentions to=20

Susie. Yet Gershom, I know, is nice to Susie and nothing more. He is still =
my loyal but carefully=20

restrained knight. It's a shame, I suppose, to bobweasel him the way I occa=
sionally do. But I can't=20

quite help it. His goody-goodiness is as provocative to my baser nature as =
a red flag to an=20

Andulasian bull. And a woman who was once reckoned as a heart-breaker has t=
o keep her hand=20

in with _something_. I've got to convince myself that the last shot hasn't =
gone from the locker=20

which Duncan Argyll McKail once rifled. I spoiled Gershom's supper for him =
the other night by=20

asking what it was made some people have such a mysterious influence over o=
ther people. And I=20

caught him up short, last Sunday morning, when he tried to argue that I was=
 a sort of paragon in=20

petticoats.  "Don't you run away with the idea I'm that kind of an angel," =
I promptly assured him.=20

"I'm an outlaw, from saddle to sougan, and I can buck like a bear fightin' =
bees. I'm a she-devil=20

crow-hopping around in skirts. And I could bu'st every commandment slap-ban=
g across my knee,=20

once I got started, and leave a trail of crime across the fair face of natu=
re that would make an old=20

Bow-Gun vaquero's back-hair stand up. I'm just a woman, Gershom, a little l=
onely and a little=20

loony, and there's so much backed-up bad in me that once the dam gives way =
there'll be a hell-

roaring old whoop-up along these dusty old trails!" of history.  We are jud=
ging the opponents of=20

Caesar, it seems to me, under the dominion of exaggerated notions of the be=
neficence of the=20

Empire which Caesar founded, of its value as a political model, of its conn=
ection with the life of=20

modern civilization, and of the respect, not to say devotion, due to the me=
mory of its founder. Let=20

us try to cast off for an hour the influence of these modern sentiments, an=
d put the whole group of=20

ancient figures back into its place in ancient history.  The Empire was a n=
ecessity at the time when=20

it came--granted. But a necessity of what sort? Was it a necessity created =
by an upward effort, by=20

an elevation of humanity, or by degradation and decline? In the former case=
 you may pass the=20

same sentence upon those who opposed its coming which is passed upon those =
who crucified=20

Christ, or who, like Philip II., opposed the Reformation in the spirit of b=
igoted reaction. But in the=20

latter case they must be charged, not with moral blindness or depravity, bu=
t only with the lack of=20

that clearness of sight which leads men and parties at the right moment, or=
 even in anticipation of=20

the right moment, to despair; and such perspicacity, to say the least, is a=
 highly scientific quality,=20

requiring perhaps, to make it respectable and safe, a more exact knowledge =
of historical=20

sequences than we even now possess. Even now we determine these historical =
necessities by our=20



knowledge of the result. It was a necessity, given all the conditions-- the=
 treachery of Ephialtes=20

included--that the Persians should force the pass of Thermopylae. But the T=
hree Hundred could=20

not know all the conditions. Even if they had, would they have done right i=
n giving way? They fell,=20

but their spirits fought again at Salamis.  To me it appears that the Empir=
e was a necessity of the=20

second kind; that it was an inevitable concession to incurable evil, not a =
new development of good.=20

The Roman morality, the morality which had produced and sustained the Repub=
lic, was now in a=20

state of final and irremediable decay. That morality was narrow and imperfe=
ct, or rather it was=20

rudimentary, a feeble and transient prototype of the sounder and more endur=
ing morality which=20

was soon to be born into the world. It was the morality of devotion to a si=
ngle community, and in=20

fact consisted mainly of the performance of duty to that community in war. =
But it was real and=20

energetic after its measure and its own time. It produced a type of charact=
er, which, if reproduced=20

now, would be out of date and even odious, but which stands in history dign=
ified and imposing=20

even to the last. Nor was it without elements of permanent value. It contri=
buted largely to the=20

patriotism=20


_
Gershom turned white.  "But there's your little ones to think of," he quave=
ringly reminded me.=20

"Yes, there's my little ones to think of," I echoed, wondering where I'd he=
ard that familiar old refrain=20

before. My bark, after all, is much worse than my bite. About all I can do =
is take things out in talk.=20

I'm only a faded beauty, brooding over my antique adventures as a heart-bre=
aker. But I know of=20

one heart I'd still like to break--if I had the power. No; not break; but b=
end up to the cracking point!=20

_Monday the Nineteenth_   How Time takes wing for the busy! It's only six d=
ays to Christmas and=20

I've still my box to get off for Olga and her children. We've sent to Peter=
 some really charming=20

snap-shots of the children, which Susie took. The general effect of one, I =
must acknowledge, is=20

seriously damaged by the presence of their Mummy.  Dinky-Dunk doubts if he'=
ll be able to get=20

home for the holidays. But I sent him a box, on Saturday, made up of those =
things which he likes=20

best to eat and a set of the children's pictures, nicely mounted. I've also=
 had Dinkie and Poppsy=20

write a long letter to their dad, a task which they performed with more con=
straint than I had=20

anticipated. I had my own difficulties, along the same line, for I had take=
n a photograph of poor=20

little Pee-Wee's grave with a snow-drift across one end of it, and had writ=
ten on the bottom of the=20

mounting-card: "_We must remember._" But as I has now perhaps become obsole=
te in its turn,=20

and is superseded in our aspirations by an ideal with less of right and sel=
f-assertion, with more of=20

duty and of social affection, yet did good service against the Stuarts. The=
 Roman morality,=20

together with dignity of character, produced as usual simplicity of life. I=
t produced a reverence for=20

the majesty of law, the voice of the community. It produced relations betwe=
en the sexes, and=20

domestic relations generally, far indeed below the ideal, yet decidedly abo=
ve those which=20

commonly existed in the pagan world. It produced a high degree of self-cont=
rol and of abstinence=20

from vices which prevailed elsewhere. It produced fruits of intellect, some=
 original, especially in the=20

political sphere, others merely borrowed from Greece, yet evincing on the p=
art of the borrower a=20

power of appreciating the superior excellence of another, and that a conque=
red nation, the value=20

of which, as breaking through the iron boundary of national self-love, has =
perhaps not received=20

sufficient notice. What was of most consequence to the world at large and t=
o history, it produced,=20

though probably not so much in the way of obedience to recognised principle=
 as of noble instinct,=20

a signal mitigation of Conquest, which was then the universal habit, but fr=
om being extermination=20

and destruction, at best slavery or forcible transplantation, became under =
the Romans a=20

supremacy, imposed indeed by=20


_
next to Poppsy's huge Christmas-card gay with powdered mica I felt a foolis=
h tear or two run down=20

my cheek. And I realized it would never do to cloud my Dinky-Dunk's day wit=
h memories which=20

might not be altogether happy. So I've kept the picture of the little white=
-fenced bed with the white=20

snow-drift across its foot....  Susie is in bed with a bad cold, which she =
caught studying astronomy=20

with Gershom. Poppsy was not in the least put out when she watched me prepa=
ring a mustard-

plaster for the invalid. My daughter, I am persuaded, has a revived faith i=
n the operation of=20

retributive justice. But I hope Susie is better by the holiday. Whinnie has=
 the Christmas Tree=20

hidden away in the stable, and already a number of mysterious parcels have =
arrived at Casa=20

Grande. Bud Teetzel very gallantly sent me over a huge turkey, an eighteen-=
pounder, and to-

morrow I have to go into Buckhorn for my mail-order shipments. We have deco=
rated the suffering,=20

yet, in a certain sense civilizing, and not exercised wholly without regard=
 for the good of the=20

subject races. Thus that political unity of the nations round the Mediterra=
nean was brought about,=20

which was the necessary precursor and protector of a union of a better kind=
. A measure of the=20

same praise is due to Alexander, who was a conqueror of the higher order fo=
r a similar reason--

namely, that though a Macedonian prince, he was imbued with the ideas and t=
he morality of the=20

Greek republics. But Alexander was a single man, and he could not accomplis=
h what was=20

accomplished in a succession of generations by the corporate energies and v=
irtues of the Roman=20

Senate.  The conditions under which this morality had maintained itself wer=
e now gone. It=20

depended on the circumstances of a small community, long engaged in a strug=
gle for existence=20

with powerful and aggressive neighbours, the Latin, the Etruscan, the Samni=
te, and the=20


_
I've hung a sprig of mistletoe in the living-room doorway. The children, of=
 course, are on tiptoe with=20

expectation. But I can't escape the impression that I'm merely acting a par=
t, that I'm a Pagliacci in=20

petticoats. Heaven knows I clown enough; no one can accuse me of not going =
through the=20

gestures. But it seems like fox-trotting along the deck of a sinking ship. =
 I stood under the=20

mistletoe, this morning, and dared Gershom to in turn, when its own safety =
had been secured, on=20

a career of conquest, still in a certain sense defensive, since every neigh=
bour was in those days=20

an enemy; and continuing to task to the utmost the citizen's devotion to th=
e State, the virtues of=20

command and obedience necessary to victory, and the frugality necessary to =
supply the means of=20

great national efforts; while luxury was kept at bay, though the means of i=
ndulging it had=20


_
me. He turned quite white and made for the door. But I caught him by the co=
at, like Potiphar's wife,=20

and pulled him back to the authorizing berry-sprig and gave him a brazen bi=
g smack on the cheek-

bone. He turned a sunset pink, at that, and marched out of the room without=
 saying a word. But he=20

was shaking his head as he went, at my shamelessness, I suppose. Poor old G=
ershom! I wish=20

there were more men in the world like him. The other day Susie intimated th=
at he was too=20

homosexual and that it was the polygamous wretches who really kept the worl=
d going. But I refuse=20

to subscribe to that sophomoric philosophy of hers which would divide the t=
he counter-attraction of=20

military glory. But all this was at an end when Carthage and Macedon were o=
verthrown. National=20

danger and the necessity for national effort being removed, self-devotion f=
ailed, egotism broke=20

loose, and began to revel in the pillage and oppression of a conquered worl=
d. The Roman=20

character was corrupted, as the Spartan character was corrupted when Sparta=
, from being a camp=20

in the midst of hostile Helots, became a dominant power and sent out govern=
ors to subject states;=20

though the corruption in the case of Sparta was far more rapid, because Spa=
rtan excellence was=20

more exclusively military, more formal and more=20


_
being sane than mad; it's better being good than bad!" as Robert remarked. =
And I know at least=20

one strong man who is not bad; and one bad man who is not strong.     _Tues=
day the Twenty-

Seventh_   The great Day has come and gone. And I'm not sorry. There was a =
cloud over my=20

heart that kept military duty, and there being no great public duty except =
military duty to be=20

performed, there remained no school of public virtue. Such public virtue as=
 there was lingered,=20

though in a degraded form round the eagles of the standing armies, to which=
 the duties of the=20

citizen-soldier were=20


_
ought. I hoped we would hear from Peter, but for the first time in history =
he overlooked us.  Dinky-

Dunk, as he had warned us, could not get home for the holidays. But he surp=
rised me by sending=20

a really wonderful box for the kiddies, and even a gorgeous silver-mounted =
now consigned; and=20

the soldiery thus acquired not only the power but the right of electing the=
 emperors, the best of=20

whom, in fact, after Augustus, were generally soldiers. The ruling nation b=
ecame a city rabble, the=20

vices of which were but little tempered by the fitful=20


_
again, but she is still feeling a bit listless. I heard Gershom informing h=
er to-night that her blood=20

travels at the rate of seven miles per hour and that if all the energy of N=
iagara Falls were utilized it=20

could supply the world with seven million political adventurers bought the =
consulships, which led to=20

the government of provinces, and wrung out of the unhappy provincials the p=
urchase money and a=20

fortune for themselves besides. These fortunes begot colossal luxury and a =
general reign of vice.=20
