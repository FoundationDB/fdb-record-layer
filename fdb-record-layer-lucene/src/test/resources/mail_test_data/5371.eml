dracaena marginata trying circumstances.     CHAPTER XXIV  THE SEARCH   It was a most anxious night for everybody at Snow Camp. The thought of the six girls adrift in the blizzard kept most of the household awake, Long Jerry Todd, the guide, remained provision; but he did not find the solace that he had expected in musing upon Mons Meg and the Scottish Regalia. How dreadful four walls become when you are shut up within them; how the air begins to hum and buzz after a while with dracaena marginata trying circumstances.

understood. Then the big girl dropped down off the ledge and plowed her way toward Ruth and 

her burden.  "The poor fellow! who is he?" gasped Madge, as together they raised the strange boy 

and started up the sharp ascent.  "Not Tom! Oh! it's never Tom?" shrieked Helen at the top of the 

hill.  "No, no!" gasped Ruth. "It's--the--boy--that--ran away."  They got him upon the dry ledge of 

rock before the fire. His cheeks showed frostbitten spots, and Jennie began to rub them with 

snow. "That's the way to treat frostbite," she declared. "Take off his boots. If his in the air. 

CHAPTER XLV.   Rolls in the county jail, sent hither on his own confession, was in a very different 

position from John Erskine, waiting examination there. He was locked up without ceremony in a 

cell, his respectability and his well known antecedents all ignored. Dunnotter was at some distance 

from the district in which he was known, and Thomas Rolls, domestic servant, charged with 

manslaughter, did not impress the official imagination as Mr Rolls the factotum of Dalrulzian had 

long impressed the mind of his own neighbourhood and surroundings. 


_
same way."  Helen and Belle obeyed Heavy, who seemed quite practical in this emergency. Ruth 

had no strength, or breath, for the time being, but lay beside the fire herself. Meanwhile Madge 

and Lluella scrapped the red coals out from the rock and swept the platform clean with green 

branches. Ruth and the runaway boy were drawn into this cozy retreat and soon the boy began to 

weep and cry out as the heat got into his feet. It was very painful to have the frost drawn out in this 

manner.  It was now after midnight and the storm still raged. Madge and Jennie floundered out for 

more fuel. The hatchet the boy carried was of great aid to them in this work and soon they had 

piled on the ledge sufficient wood to keep the blaze alive until dawn.  By this time the strange 

youth had been thawed out and was dropping asleep against the warm rock. Helen and Belle 

agreed to stand the next watch, and to feed the fire. Both Ruth and Madge needed sleep, the 

former aching in every muscle from her fight to bring the rescued one in.  "We're doubly captives 

now," the girl of the Red Mill whispered to Madge before she dropped asleep. "If it should stop 

snowing we couldn't try to get back to camp deeply depressed when he found himself shut up 

within that blank interior, with nothing to do, and nothing to support the _amour propre_ which was 

his strength, except the inborn conviction of his own righteousness and exemplary position,--a 

sight for all men. But there is nothing that takes down the sense of native merit so much as 

solitude and absence of appreciation. Opposition and hostility are stimulants, and keep warm in us 

the sense of our own superiority, but not the contemptuous indifference of a surly turnkey to whom 

one is No. 25, and who cared not a straw for Rolls's position and career. He felt himself getting 

limp as the long featureless days went on, and doubts of every kind assailed him. Had he been 

right to do it? Since he had made this sacrifice for his master, there had come into his mind a chill 

of doubt which he had never been touched by before. Was it certain that it was John who had 

done it? Might not he, Rolls, be making a victim of himself for some nameless tramp, who would 

never even know of it, nor care, and whose punishment would be doubly deserved and worthy of 

no man's interference? Rolls felt that this was a suggestion of the devil for his

certain sure that he could not travel himself, nor could we carry him."  "You are right, Ruth," 

returned Madge. "This addition to our party makes our situation worse instead of better."  "But 

maybe it will all come out right in the end, dear."  "Let us hope so."  "What a boy of mystery he is!" 

"Yes."  "Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of his trouble?"  "Let us hope so."  Then both girls 

turned over, to get pleasures he had secured for himself in that last week of his life--of Edinburgh 

Castle and the Calton Jail and the Earthen Mound, and the wonders of the Observatory. To 

inspect these had been the dream of his life, and he had attained that felicity. He had believed that 

this would give him "plenty to think about" for the rest of his life--and that, especially for the time of 

his confinement, it would afford an
