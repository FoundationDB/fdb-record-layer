i-City Trades'=20

Council we give, probably in full, elsewhere, as taken from the "New York T=
imes." It is on the=20

subject of strikes and picketing, and speaks for itself. Another tested the=
 law of Arizona, which=20

made picketing, etc., that tended to destroy an employer's business, lawful=
, and the law was held=20

to be unconstitutional, although by a divided Court, 5 to 4. Among the diss=
enters was Mr. Justice=20

Pitney. The main opinion was lengthy and explicit, and we think, fair and j=
ust. The third was on the=20

subject of the "open competition" plan by which members of the National Har=
dwood=20

Manufacturers' Associations believed they were getting around the Sherman A=
ct, but are now told=20

by the Court their practices are in restraint of trade. The Association was=
 prosecuted by the=20

Government in the Federal Court at Memphis, and a permanent injunction was =
obtained against=20

continuance of the practices of filing by hardwood concerns of reports of b=
usiness operations with=20

Loaf-Sugar finely powder'd, and a spoonfull of Orange-Flower-Water: mix thi=
s then with as much=20

Cream, and two Eggs beat, as will render it of the Consistence of Cheesecak=
e-meat before it is=20

baked; then put it into your Coffins, and bake them in a gentle Oven. You m=
ay put in Currans if=20

you please, but they are generally omitted: however, if you like to have th=
em, let them be first=20

plump'd a little over the Fire in Sugar and Water.  The best way for these =
Cheesecakes is to make=20

the Coffins in Patty-Pans, and fill them with the Meat near an Inch thick. =
 The Proportions=20

central organization, such reports being open to all other members of the o=
rganization. The=20

opinion holding the conduct of the members of the Association to be illegal=
 was delivered by=20

Justice Clark. As usual, of late, there were dissents, this time by Justice=
s Holmes, Brandies and=20

McKenna. The meetings of the members resulted in concerted action, Justice =
Clarke stated, to=20

raise prices regardless of conditions, and the plan was termed by him "misl=
eading and a=20

misnomer" and "an old evil in a new dress and a new name." He added that in=
stead of a plan to=20

promote open competition it operated to restrict competition. It was futile=
, he said, to argue that the=20

plan was merely to furnish information which could not be otherwise obtaine=
d. The secretary of the=20

Association, through an expert statistician, utilized replies to questionna=
ires and other information=20

furnished by the members of the Association as the basis for bulletins and =
advices. These replies=20

also were utilized in predicting and promoting advances in prices, by withh=
olding of products from=20

the market, awaiting higher prices.                     *       *       *  =
     *       *  In the second case referred=20

to in the preceding paragraph the United States Supreme Court thus laid dow=

"secondary boycott": It is to be observed that this [the case in hand] is n=
ot the mere case of a=20

is as thick as an hasty Pudding; then mix with it eight Ounces of Butter, a=

not too hot: mix then all well together, and put it in your Paste.    A _So=

Wash some Spinach and Sorrel Leaves in two or three Waters, for they are ap=
t to gather Dirt; then=20

either shred them, and squeeze the Juice out through a Cloth, or else beat =
them in a Mortar of=20

Marble, and strain off the Juice; about half a Pint of Juice will be enough=
: then shred into it about a=20

Quart measure of the same Herbs, and add six Ounces of fine Sugar beaten, a=
nd some Spice,=20

with the Yolks of six hard Eggs bruised, and well mix'd with it, and two Eg=
gs raw well beaten; then=20

patronizing him by=20

threats of similar injury. In such a case the many have a legal right to wi=

one, they have the legal right to withdraw their trade from third persons a=
nd they have the right to=20

advise third persons of their intention to do so when each act is considere=
d singly. The question in=20

such cases is whether the moral coercion exercised over a stranger to the o=
riginal controversy by=20

steps in themselves legal becomes a legal wrong. But here the illegality of=
 the means used is=20

without doubt and fundamental. The means used are the libelous and abusive =
attacks on the=20

plaintiffs' reputation, like attacks on their employers and customers. Thre=
ats of such attacks on=20

would-be customers, picketing and patrolling of the entrance to their place=
 of business and the=20

consequent obstruction of free access thereto--all had the purpose of depri=
ving the plaintiffs of=20

their business. To give operation to a statute whereby serious losses infli=
cted by such unlawful=20

means are in effect made remedyless, is, we think, to disregard fundamental=
 rights of liberty and=20

property and to Paste, pour in half a Pint of Sack, the Juice of two Lemons=
 and an Orange: and=20

when this is done, close the Pye, and when it is baked, serve it hot to the=
 Table.    To Stew=20

Peaches. From the same.  Take Peaches when they are so ripe that they begin=
 to smell; then pare=20

them and slit them, and the Sorts I recommend will leave the Stones. Put th=
ese in a Silver Plate,=20

or on such a one as will not communicate any ill taste to them, and pour ov=
er them a Syrup made=20

of Pippins, Water and Sugar boil'd till it is a Jelly, and add a little Whi=
te Wine; then stew them=20

gently over a clear Fire till they are tender; and serve them with fine Sug=
ar sifted upon them. In=20

some Cafes they pour Cream upon them.    Red _Peach Tarts._ From the same. =
 Take your=20

Peaches, as before directed, and order them as you did before in paring the=

then lay them into the Coffins, and when you have sifted on them some fine =
powder'd Loaf-Sugar,=20

pour over them some Syrup of Raspberries or Mulberries, and bake them gentl=
y: they will be=20
