dracaena marginata be heard walking on the floor. So the slightest subterra=
nean noise may be heard.  These instruments have taught us that the minor t=
remors increase in number and intensity as any unusual disturbance of Vesuv=
ius approaches; just as the Signal Service can detect the gathering dracaen=
a marginata be heard walking on the floor. So the slightest subterranean no=
ise may be heard.  These instruments have taught us that the minor tremors =
increase in number and intensity as any unusual disturbance of Vesuvius app=
roaches; just as the Signal Service can detect the gathering _
in the colony and take measures for its benefit. Banks should be establishe=
d, currency provided=20

for, and facilities given to all the people for securing credit when needed=
--under the care,=20

protection, and partly the management of the government. Commerce should be=
 made entirely=20

free to the world, in all kinds of products, whether native or foreign, sav=
e for the payment of=20

moderate customs duties. A lottery should be established; fire and marine i=
nsurance companies=20

should be protected; all artisans, of every class, nationality, and religio=
n, should be free to settle in=20

the islands (those who oppose this show puerile fears and absurd and impoli=
tic notions); the=20

ownership of land should be made secure and legal; waste lands should be br=
ought under=20

cultivation, under penalty of losing title to them; such lands should be fr=
eely granted to all, whether=20

natives or foreigners, who will cultivate them; and intending colonists be =
aided in all practicable=20

ways, even from the public funds. The convents and cabildos which have the =
administration of=20

funds deposited with them for the promotion of agriculture should be oblige=
d to render their=20

accounts of these, and to distribute them so as to carry out the intentions=
 of the founders; and the=20

funds which were to be invested in the Acapulco trade should, as that has n=
ow ceased, be applied=20

to the benefit of agriculture. Foreign nations should be allowed to send co=
nsuls to Manila, which=20

would be a benefit not only to foreigners residing in the islands, but reci=
procally to Spaniards who=20

navigate the seas controlled by foreign nations. A printing-office should b=
e established there, and=20

provision be made for the publication of a daily paper devoted to commerce =
and industry, and=20

having those in every land who must spend much time in the open air. The sc=
ientist may=20

understand the laws of winds and rains: but the farmer, the shepherd, the f=
isherman, and sailor, to=20

whom every phase of weather means much, can, relying upon the actions of th=
e lower animals,=20

detect approaching changes as readily, in many cases, as the Signal Service=
; and far more readily=20

or correctly than the quasi learned theorist whose stock in trade is a hobb=
y and an unlimited=20

quantity of assumption.  It is one thing to understand law; it is quite ano=
ther to be able to make=20

practical application of it. Franklin identified lightning with electricity=
; a century passed before=20

practical use of the electric light resulted. We know now the general laws =
of air currents, but little=20

application of them has been made.  As to the possibility of controlling th=
e winds, no one has thus=20

far had the temerity to propose it. But that rainfall can be partially cont=
rolled is well known. The=20

heaviest rains occur in forest areas; and in turn, the matted roots of the =
forest and jungle retard the=20

descent of the rain into the water courses, and hinder the washing away of =
the soil. Floods have=20

become more sudden and destructive in the lumber regions since the timber h=
as been cut away,=20

while the actual rainfall is not so great. So a number of our Western State=
s require a=20

=E2=80=9Chomesteader=E2=80=9D to plant a tree claim.  A bold genius has rec=
ently asserted that we may produce=20

rain at will, by sending up balloons loaded with dynamite or other powerful=
 explosives, and then=20

firing them. It has been observed that almost every great modern battle has=
 been followed by a=20

heavy rainfall; and the idea is, that the continued explosions have had muc=
h to do with them.=20

Frequenters=20


_
the other Oriental colonies to furnish information of their progress and ac=
hievements in all the=20

useful arts. A mint should be erected at Manila; and the government establi=
shments there for=20

making cannon and gun-powder, which now are almost useless, should be put o=
n an effective=20

footing, and those articles should be supplied for the defense of the merch=
ant and coasting=20

vessels. A probate court has been formed, for the proper care of intestate =
property and that left to=20

minors; and its administration should be regulated carefully, and the funds=
 in its charge be=20

administered for the benefit of its owners and of the country. Manila and i=
ts environs should be=20

sufficiently policed, and lawlessness curbed; vagabonds should be kept unde=
r control, and all who=20

employ Indian servants should be made responsible for their conduct; and su=
ch servants should=20

not be employed by any one, whether Spaniard or foreigner, nor allowed to e=
nter colleges as=20

students, without producing certificates from the police department. A coll=
ege should be=20

established in which the youth should receive instruction in belles lettres=
, medicine, chemistry,=20

botany, experimental physics, and mathematics; and a botanical garden shoul=
d be made near=20

Manila. Martins should be introduced into Luzon, for the extermination of t=
he locust plague. The=20

intendancy of the royal exchequer should be separated from the office of ca=
ptain-general, so that=20

the intendant correctness of the theory.  Doubtless a more effective plan w=
ould be simply to apply=20

the well known first principle of air-currents and storms--heated air; but =
this would be immensely=20

expensive. Every year sees exemplifications of it, however, in the heavy ra=
ins that follow the great=20

forest fires or prairie fires of our own land. Natives of tropical regions =
frequently burn the jungle at=20

the close of the dry season; and the unusual heating of large areas in this=
 way doubtless has=20

much to do with hastening the advent of rain.  The expedient of firing the =
sawgrass ponds is=20

frequently resorted to in Florida, and has been brought to the notice of th=
e public in official=20

meteorological reports. It is directly in accordance with the principle of =
restoration of the balance of=20

forces, whereby a long heated term is followed by unusually heavy rains.  B=
ut, in contending with=20

subterranean forces, man is hitherto balked. Numbers of instruments exist f=
or measuring the force=20

and direction of earthquake shocks, but these can be made of little practic=
al use; for we have seen=20

that the vibrations travel from forty to one hundred and fifty miles a minu=
te, according to the nature=20

of the soil. Hence, could we know a certain shock would travel around the w=
orld, it would not be=20

possible, after it was first felt, to send warning ahead in time to be of a=
ny especial value. But we=20

have seen that unusual disturbances of this sort are=20


_
authority to direct the affairs of the former independently.]  [The writer =
proceeds to describe the=20

character of the Tagalog natives, which he paints in gloomy colors.] It is =
impossible to define either=20

the character of these Taglos, or their recurrence; while in other lands, t=
hey are almost unknown.=20

So any one understands pretty well what risks he runs in any particular dis=
trict.  The Chinese were=20

the first to invent a seismometer, or instrument for ascertaining the force=
 and direction of any=20


_
said that they have none; for, although in outward appearance they profess =
the Catholic religion,=20

inwardly and in their actions they manifest that they follow no religion. T=
he zeal with which the first=20

conquistadors undertook to instruct them in the true belief has been useles=
s; and the watchful care=20

of the missionaries whom the piety of our kings has not ceased to send to t=
hose regions has been=20

of no avail, consists of an upright pillar bearing a number of dragons=E2=
=80=99 heads--each one holding a=20

ball in its mouth. So any slight tilting or vibration of the pillar would c=
ause a ball to drop on the side=20

toward which the shock travelled. The distance to which the ball was thrown=
 served as a rude=20

measure of the force.  Equally simple is Mallet=E2=80=99s contrivance--a nu=
mber of cylinders of equal=20

heights and different bases,=20


_
and useful members of society, a new species of men, who unite the slothful=
ness of the savages=20

to the vices of civilized peoples. Thus it is that the Taglos are fickle, v=
agabonds, full of=20

superstitions, assassins, liars, licentious but without love, adroit thieve=
s; and, in one word, they do=20

not respect even the most sacred of the laws, divine or human. They lose no=
 opportunity to make=20

mischief among the authorities, and between the latter and Spaniards of all=
 classes; and they have=20

the violent the shock, the larger the cylinder thrown down.  But observatio=
ns of these vibrations, to=20

be of use, must take note of the myriad tremors that will escape ordinary p=
erceptions, or the=20

powers of such rude instruments as the above. There are several sorts now u=
sed. Prof. Palmieri,=20

of the Vesuvius Observatory, uses a delicate instrument, which records the =
slightest tremor on a=20

dial-plate. The Italians have also applied the microphone to this work. The=
 delicacy of this=20

instrument may be=20
