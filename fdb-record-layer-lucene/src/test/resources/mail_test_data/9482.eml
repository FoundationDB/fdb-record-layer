 and the masses of this substance, my examination of it was much too superf=

armor plates he said: "Five thousand pounds gone up in smoke. Sorry I misse=

Divisional general called him up at the dugout and gave him areas for the d=

"Very good, sir, that will be done with all the guns except the third gun."=

became very dignified, a preliminary to becoming sulphuric. "What do you me=

 Transactions of the=20

Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia, Vol. VI., and in Bruce's Journal, V=

communication arose from a conversation on that subject between Dr. Brown a=
nd the Editor.=20

_New-Haven, July 27, 1818._    DEAR SIR,  I have just found the passage I r=
eferred to the other=20

day, relative to the existence of native or sandrock nitre in the interior =
of Southern Africa. It is in=20

Barrow, and not in Vaillant, as I thought when I had the pleasure of conver=
sing with you=20

concerning it. I am much obliged to you for recalling my attention to that =
curious subject, as it has=20

brought to my recollection a fact, which I believe I omitted to mention in =
my memoir, (viz.) the=20

existence of a black substance in the clay under the rocks, of a=20

teal materials from=20

juniors in rank; if they find it a rock-house, near the Kentucky river, whe=
re very considerable=20

quantities of sandrock nitre had been obtained. This substance was found in=
 masses of a few=20

ounces weight, and in the crevices of the rocks near the basis of the side =
walls. The smell was not=20

wholly bituminous, but resembled that of bitumen combined with musk. I=20
