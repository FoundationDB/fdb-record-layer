The women had prepared a quantity of fermented liquor; and during two days the Indians were in a philodendron monstera just before it is fed at the after-show! It is the voice of hell.

You tell the Americans the FRENCH WILL SEE IT THROUGH...if a new offensive is 

necessary...we'll do it! It's the only chance anybody has to have a world fit to live in!'"  When she 

had finished her story, Dorothy Canfield concluded something like this: "That's what they all come 

back to, after their fit of utter horror at their life is over. It does them good, apparently, to talk it all 

out to a patient listener. They always, always end by saying that even what they are living through 

is better than a world commanded by the Germans...what a perfectly amazing distrust that nation 

has accumulated against itself!"  They are sick of war; war weary and sad. Yet they will fight on. 

The will to fight is outside the individual will; yet it is not the will of the leaders, nor is it the will of 

the many combined in a common will. For the many are tired unto death of war. But for all that 

they will fight on without flinching. It is the national will--the will deeper than the will of leaders, 

stronger than the molten will of the many in one purpose. It is the tradition of centuries; it is the 

unexpressed purpose, perhaps unconscious habit of an old, old people, united far down in the 

roots of them; not so much by race, for the Franks are of many breeds; not so much by industrial 

or geographical ties or even political unity, though it approaches that; but bound most surely by the 

sense of national tradition. A people is fighting. From a thousand villages with their primeval 

temples, with their lovely cathedrals grown out of to be tried in Spain. The vessel in which they 

were conveyed became leaky, and put into Spanish Harbour in the island of Trinidad. The 

governor Chacon intereated himself in the fate of the monks; they were pardoned a violent 

proceeding somewhat inconsistent with monastic discipline, and were again employed in the 

missions. I was acquainted with them both during my abode in South America.) At Esmeralda, 

where the political events that have agitated Europe for thirty years past have not yet been heard 

of, lively interest is still felt in an event which is called the sedition of the monks, (el alboroto de los 

frailes.) In this country, as in the East, no conception is formed of any other revolutions than those 

that are made by rulers themselves; and we have just seen that the effects are not very alarming. 

If the villa of Esmeralda, with a population of twelve or fifteen families, be at present considered as 

a frightful place of abode, this must be attributed to the want of cultivation, the distance from every 

other inhabited country, and the excessive quantity of mosquitos. The site of the mission is highly 

picturesque; the surrounding country is lovely, and of great fertility. I never saw plantains of so 

large a size as these: and indigo, sugar, and cacao might be produced in abundance, if any 

trouble were taken for their cultivation. The Cerro Duida is surrounded with fine pasturage; and if 

the Observantins of the college of Piritu partook a little of the industry of the Catalonian Capuchins 

settled on the

the shining rivers that flow through green pastures, from soft hills rich in folk tales of heroes, come 

the millions; and from Paris, ever radiant in her venerable youth, come other millions who make 

this fighting soul of the nation. What if it grumbles as it fights; it will still fight on. Of course it is sick 

of war; but it will not stop. It is a spirit that is fighting in France, the spirit of a brave people.  We 

have in France a few hundred thousand men and will soon have a million and more who are 

offering their lives in Service. But the whole French nation is giving thus. And it is without hate. 

One finds instead of hatred in France a feeling of deep disgust for the German and all his works. 

The spirit of the French is not vicious. It is beautiful. When the war ceases that may subside, may 

retire to the under consciousness of the people. But it will not depart. It also will remain eternally a 

part of the salvage of this war.  By the time the transgression of our car had been sufficiently 

atoned for, dusk was falling. And Henry broke away from the gothic arches of the trees and made 

for a tavern. He had learned that one must take food in France where he can find it, and ten 

minutes later we came upon him in front of the inn, talking in a slow loud voice to what was either 

the inn-keeper's daughter or his pretty young wife thus: "I said," Henry paused and nodded his 

head and beat the thing in with his hand; "we want some supper--de jurnay--toot sweet!" She 

shook her head and shrugged her shoulders very prettily and said she could not "say pa." And 

Henry laughed and went on, still enunciating each word distinctly. "Ah, don't tell us you can't 'Say 

pa': say 'wee wee.'" And again he told her "toot sweet." That was the only part of the French 

language that Henry was entirely sure of--that and "comb be-ah!" But we could not get it through 

her head. So we loaded ourselves into the car and headed back for St. Dizier, where at least they 

understood Henry's gestures, and we could get food!  Our next journey took us to the greatest 

training camp in the allied part of the world. It is not the largest camp, of course. It accommodates 

less than twenty thousand soldiers. But it is what might be called the post graduate college of all 

training camps. Here ten thousand men come every week from other training camps all over the 

earth, and are given intensive training. For six days, eighteen and twenty hours a day, these 

soldiers, trained by many months' labour on other fields, are given the Ph.D. in battle lore, and are 

turned out the seventh day after a Saturday night lecture on hate, and shot straight up to the front. 

In all France there is no more grisly place for the weak-stomached man than this training camp--

not even the front line trenches will kick up his gorge more sedulously. Yet at first sight the place 

looks innocent enough. One sees a great basin hollowed among the hills, and in the ten thousand 

acre plain one sees horse-men galloping, soldiers running, great trucks and tanks lumbering over 

the field; men digging, men throwing hand-grenades, men clambering over trench walls, stumbling 

over crater holes, men doing all the innumerable things that are learned by those who carry on the 

handicraft of war.  But when one starts with the first class and goes along through the day's work 

with it, the deadly herds would be seen wandering between the Cunucunumo and the Padamo. At 

present, not a cow or a horse is to be found; and the inhabitants, victims of their own indolence, 

are often reduced to eat the flesh of alouate monkeys, and flour made from the bones of fish, of 

which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. A little cassava and a few plantains only are 

cultivated; and when the fishery is not abundant, the natives of a country so favoured by nature 

are exposed to the most cruel privations.  The pilots of the small number of boats that go from the 

Rio Negro to Angostura by the Cassiquiare are afraid to ascend as far as Esmeralda, and 

therefore that mission would have been much better placed at the point of the bifurcation of the 



Orinoco. It is probable that this vast country will not always be doomed to the desertion in which it 

has hitherto been left, owing to the errors of monkish administration and the spirit of monopoly that 

characterises corporations. We may even predict on what points of the Orinoco industry and 

commerce will become most active. In every zone, population is concentred at the mouth of 

tributary streams. The Rio Apure, by which the productions of the provinces of Varinas and Merida 

are exported, will give great importance to the little town of Cabruta, which will then be in rivalship 

with San Fernando de Apure, where all commerce has hitherto centred. Higher up, a new 

settlement will be formed at the confluence of the Meta, which communicates with New Grenada 

by the Llanos of Casanare. The two missions of the Cataracts will increase, from the activity to 

which the transport of boats at those points will give rise; for an unhealthy and damp climate, and 

the swarming of mosquitos, will as little impede the progress of cultivation at the Orinoco as at the 

Rio Magdalena, whenever a powerful mercantile interest shall call new settlers thither. Habitual 

evils are those which are least felt; and men born in America do not suffer the same intensity of 

pain as Europeans recently arrived. Perhaps, also, the destruction of forests round the inhabited 

places, although slow, will somewhat tend to diminish the torment of the tipulary insects. San 

Fernando de Atabapo, Javita, San Carlos, and Esmeralda, appear (from their situation at the 

mouth of the Guaviare, the portage between Tuamini and the Rio Negro, the confluence of the 

Cassiquiare, and the point of bifurcation of the Upper Orinoco) to promise a considerable increase 

of population and prosperity. The same improvement will take place in the fertile but uncultivated 

countries through which flow the Guallaga, the Amazon, and the Orinoco; as well as at the isthmus 

of Panama, the lake of Nicaragua, and the Rio Huasacualco, which furnish a communication 

between the two oceans. The imperfection of political institutions may for ages have converted into 

deserts places where the commerce of the world should be found concentred; but the time 

approaches when these obstacles shall exist no longer. A vicious administration cannot always 

struggle against the united interest of men; and civilization will be carried insensibly into those 

countries, the great destinies of which nature itself proclaims, by the physical configuration of the 

soil, the immense windings of the rivers, and the proximity of two seas, that bathe the shores of 

Europe and of

to him. The first thing the first class does is to gather around a sergeant major, who in a few simple 

words tells his pupils how to use the bayonet. Then they go out and use the bayonet as he has 

taught them. Then the pupils gather around another sergeant major, who tells them how to use the 

hand-grenade or the knife or the butt of a gun, and the simple-hearted lads go out and use the 

grenade, the knife, or the butt of the gun. At length they are taken to a part of the ground where 

some trenches are sunken in the earth. Before the trenches are barbed wire entanglements and 

deep jagged shell craters. The imitation enemy trenches badly bombed by barrage lie twenty rods 

beyond. The men are taken in hand by the amiable sergeant major and taught to yell and roar, 

and growl and snarl, to simulate the most murderous passion, and the simulation of a husky youth 

in his twenties of a murderous passion is realistic enough to make your flesh creep; for the very 

simulation produces the passion, as every wise man's son doth know. Then the youths are lined 

up in the trench, and numbered "one-two; one-two; one-two"; clear down the trench. Then the 

order is given to  Esmeralda is the most celebrated spot on the Orinoco for the preparation of that 

active poison, which is employed in war, in the chase, and, singularly enough, as a remedy for 

gastric derangements. The poison of the ticunas of the Amazon, the upas-tieute of Java, and the 

curare of Guiana, are the most deleterious substances that are known. Raleigh, about the end of 

the sixteenth century, had heard of urari* as being a vegetable substance with which arrows were 

envenomed (* In Tamanac marana, in Maypure macuri.); yet no fixed notions of this poison had 

reached Europe. The missionaries Gumilla and Gili had not been able to penetrate into the country 

where the curare is manufactured. Gumilla asserts that this preparation was enveloped in great 

mystery; that its principal ingredient was furnished by a subterranean plant with a tuberous root, 

which never puts forth leaves, and which is called specially the root (raiz de si misma); that the 

venomous exhalations which arise from the manufacture are fatal to the lives of the old women 

who (being otherwise useless) are chosen to watch over this operation; finally, that these 

vegetable juices are never

Every gun rattles on the trench-top, and the second lieutenant goes over. In the English papers 

the list of dead begins "Second lieutenant, unless otherwise designated." And in the war zone the 

second lieutenants are known as "The suicides' club." Well, the second lieutenants get on top, 

and, down in the trench, number one hands his leg to number two; clear down the line; number 

two boosts number one to the top, then number one lends a hand to number two and pulls him 

out. Meanwhile enemy fire is hot. The line forms in open order. The blood curdling yells begin--and 

mingle in an animal roar that sounds like the howl drops produce at a distance a repulsive action 

on the blood. An Indian wounds himself slightly; and a dart dipped in the liquid curare is held near 

the wound. If it make the blood return to the vessels without having been brought into contact with 

them, the poison is judged to be sufficiently concentrated.  When we arrived at Esmeralda, the 

greater part of the Indians were returning from an excursion which they had made to the east, 

beyond the Rio Padamo, to gather juvias, or the fruit of the bertholletia, and the liana which yields 

the curare. Their return was celebrated by a festival, which is called in the mission
