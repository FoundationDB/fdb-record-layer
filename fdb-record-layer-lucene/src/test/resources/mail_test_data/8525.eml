They endeavour to make me responsible for the opinions which certain of the=
 personages of my=20

drama express. And yet there is not in the whole book a single opinion, a s=
ingle utterance, which=20

can be laid to the account of the author. I took good care to avoid this. T=
he very method, the order=20

of technique which imposes its form upon the play, forbids the author to ap=
pear in the speeches of=20

his characters. My object was to make the reader feel that he was going thr=
ough a piece of real=20

experience; and nothing could more effectually prevent such an impression t=
han the intrusion of=20

the author's private opinions into the dialogue. Do they imagine at home th=
at I am so inexpert in=20

the theory of drama as one hundred days, was due to the genius and indomita=
ble zeal of John=20

Ericsson, its designer. That it should have arrived from New York at this m=
oment is one of the=20

fateful accidents of history. A multitude beheld the encounter, from the sh=
ips close at hand, from=20

the shores near and far. The superior size and armament of the _Virginia_ w=
ere neutralized by her=20

unwieldiness and depth of draught. The _Monitor_, more active, and passing =
everywhere over=20

shoal or through channel, could elude or strike as she chose. Neither had m=
uch power to harm the=20

other; each crew behind its shield man=C5=93uvred and fired for the most pa=

In no other play that I have written is the author so external to the actio=
n, so entirely absent from it,=20

as in this last one."  "They say," he continued, "that the book preaches Ni=
hilism. Not at all. It is not=20

concerned to preach anything whatsoever. It merely points to the ferment of=
 Nihilism going on=20

under the surface, at home as elsewhere. A Pastor Manders will always goad =
one or other Mrs.=20

Alving to revolt. And just because she is a woman, she will, when once she =
has begun, go to the=20

utmost extremes."  Towards the end of January Ibsen wrote from Rome to Olaf=
 Skavlan: "These=20

last weeks have brought me a wealth of experiences, lessons, and discoverie=

lieved that the=20

Confederacy was about to control the sea. The anticipation, whether hope or=
 fear, vanished in the=20

smoke of that day=E2=80=99s battle. With it, too, passed away the tradition=
al beauty and romance of the old=20

 so long and=20

picturesque, at last and forever gave way to steel and steam.[215]   II  TH=
