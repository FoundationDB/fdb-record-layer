(See also Abundance, page 23)  "The Universal Abundant Spirit Supplies All =

no want or limitation in the law. If, perchance, there should appear to be =
lack of, or need of,=20

abundance in our lives, it is because of wrong thinking--not because there =
is a lack of abundance.=20

Therefore, we should enter the Silence with the profound faith and convicti=
on that the world is filled=20

with plenty, and that all our needs are most bountifully supplied.  The min=
d should be saturated=20

with the conviction that all life is filled with abundance--all space is ov=
erflowing with abundance--all=20

living comes from an abundant source of supply.  In a Universe where this i=

affirmation above. As you walk on the street to your office, or place of bu=
siness, continue this=20

thought. As you go about your daily duties in the home or workshop, let the=
 mind be saturated with=20

a spirit, a feeling and thinking of abundance--"The opulence of the Univers=

again and again, absorbed and sunk deep into the subconscious mind, know th=

FOR MISFORTUNES, GRIEF, MISTAKES, REVERSES, FAILURE, SORROW, LOSS AND=20

DISAPPOINTMENT  "All is Good."  We are entering upon a new consciousness fo=
r the human=20

race, a higher plane of mentality, and a greater development of the spiritu=
al life.  In spirit, of=20

course, there is no wrong, no sorrow, no grief, no misfortune, no losses, n=
o reverses. In short all is=20

perfection.  The age in which we are living has not yet developed this spir=
itual understanding. We=20

are still of the earth--earthly--and we are still in that consciousness whe=
re the physical is affected=20

by seeming misfortunes, reverses, sorrows, griefs, trouble, sickness, etc. =
We may be wise in not=20

expecting that suddenly this generation of man will reach that spiritual pl=
ane where there will be no=20

recognition of anything except good.  We are a part of the Infinite Spirit =
ourselves and, of course,=20

in spirit, we are perfection. But this physical body of ours manifests impe=
rfection from time to time,=20

because of our past training and past thinking, because of our own consciou=
sness. In time there is=20

no doubt in my mind but that the spirit within will make a perfect body wit=
hout. This perfection will=20



be recognized in health and in peace of mind. It will be recognized so that=
 there will be no such=20

thing as misfortunes, sorrows, reverses, failures, griefs, disappointments =
or losses being able to=20

affect our mentality or our body. In this state of consciousness, as we are=
 emerging from the=20

chrysalis, material stage of man into the greater life, into the deeper spi=
ritual understanding, we=20

are subject to certain conditions not conducive to peace of mind without an=
 effort. In other words,=20

we recognize, or feel the effects of losses, misfortunes, disappointments, =
sorrows, griefs, etc. We=20

recognize now, that the time is coming when the spirit will be so completel=
y in control of matter in=20

the body, that we will not recognize any inharmony. To reach that Great Spi=
rit is one of the big=20

forward steps in this generation. To reach that spiritual plane also means =
the right kind of thinking=20

now. We plan, today, for tomorrow. This is true in every walk of life.  We =
plan our home today--and=20

build it tomorrow. We make our merchandise today and market it tomorrow. We=
 sow our seed=20

today and we reap the harvest tomorrow. We build our career today, little b=
y little, and we reach=20

the outcome tomorrow. Therefore, our thinking today will change our tomorro=
w. The thinking of=20

this generation will change the condition of tomorrow's generation. If tomo=
rrow's generation is=20

going to be free from the recognition of sorrows, misfortunes, griefs, fear=
s, pain, losses, failures,=20

reverses, inharmony, discord, etc., it depends upon our seed sowing.  Our s=
eed sowing today=20

should be "All is Good." All is Good in spirit. You can say that and be hon=
est with yourself. All is=20

perfection in spirit. All is good for us in spirit. All is good for our liv=
es here. Spirit transcends matter.=20

When we recognize, affirm, and continue to hold the constructive thought th=
at All is Good in spirit,=20

we are changing our own mental attitude, our own bodies, all matter in gene=
ral--getting ready for=20

the greater realization of the spiritual manifestation in the next generati=
on.  Therefore, for your own=20

begin to pronounce over everything in life, _All is Good_. If you have any =
misunderstandings,=20

teasing remark of hers, it tweaked her ear. Had the child been older, the l=
ook in the man=E2=80=99s eyes, as=20

he watched the fluctuations of color in her pretty face, would have warned =
her that she was=20

playing with fire; that his respect for her would have been greater had she=
 shown in the beginning=20

that the sign, =E2=80=9CHands off!=E2=80=9D was on her person, although inv=
isible to the vulgar eye.  This is but one=20

of the many instances of the free-and-easy actions on the part of men, perm=
itted by well-meaning=20

girls.  In nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand a man will =
not take a liberty with a=20

girl unless she allows it.  [Sidenote: IS BERNARD SHAW RIGHT?]  I wish girl=
s would bear this fact=20

in mind! Men are what they make them, what they allow them to be. When a yo=
ung fellow told a=20

man in my presence last week that such and such a girl was a =E2=80=9Cjolly=
 sort,=E2=80=9D and, while out driving,=20

had stopped at a roadhouse with him, gone into the parlor of the house and =
taken a glass of=20

ginger ale while he had one of whisky, I was not surprised that the man of =
the world to whom he=20

imparted this fact, remarked, =E2=80=9CCrook=C3=A9d, eh?=E2=80=9D  That the=
 young fellow (who, had he been older or=20

less easily flattered, would not have related the occurrence) flushed and l=
aughingly denied the=20

allegation=E2=80=94did not alter the fact that the conclusion drawn was ine=
vitable. The young girl may not,=20

probably did not, deserve the stricture passed on her, but by her free-and-=
easy behavior she lost=20

something she never can regain.  Men may pay attention to girls who ignore =
the conventionalities,=20

who allow them doubtful liberties, but they like them because they are what=
 they term =E2=80=9Cfun.=E2=80=9D Such=20

girls are not those for whom men live, for whom they sacrifice bad habits, =
for whom they look in=20

seeking a wife, and for whom they would bravely give up life if necessary. =
The true love of a good=20



man is worth winning. It is not won by the girl who lowers herself in a man=
=E2=80=99s eyes. To her might=20

apply the time-worn toast of man to =E2=80=9CThe New Woman,=E2=80=94once ou=
r superior, now our equal.=E2=80=9D         *=20

*       *       *       *  Another point to which I would draw the attentio=
n of our girl is that the man=20

should make the advances, should do the seeking and the courting. To this s=
he would reply, =E2=80=9CWhy,=20

of course! All girls know that.=E2=80=9D They may know it theoretically, bu=
t does every girl live up to that=20

knowledge? Does she always wait to be sought, to be won, without taking a h=
and herself at=20

assisting destiny? I think observation will not prove that she does.  In th=
is very free-and-easy age,=20

when men are too busy seeking the elusive mighty dollar to be over-eager to=
 show marked=20

attention to girls, it is often the young woman who pays heed to some of th=
e preliminaries of the=20

courting period. It is frequently she who suggests to a man, after meeting =
him several times, that=20

she would be glad to have him call. It is she who, when he is going on a jo=
urney, asks him if he will=20

not write to her. It is she who asks him for his picture and, on occasion, =
offers him one of hers.=20

[Sidenote: KEEPING ONE=E2=80=99S SELF-RESPECT]  It is, and it has been thro=
ugh centuries, the place=20

of the man to take the initiative in such matters. If he wants to call on a=
 girl, let him, as a rule, have=20

the courage to ask her if he may do so; if he wishes to correspond with her=
, he should ask her=20

permission to write to her. And if he does none of these things of his own =
volition, they may go=20

undone. The girl who, through love of admiration, or the desire for men=E2=
=80=99s attention, takes these=20

initial steps, loses her self-respect, and, unless the man in question be a=
n exceptional instance,=20

awakens in his breast a sensation of amused interest. He is flattered, and =
a bit contemptuous. As=20

time goes on and he likes the girl more and more, that feeling may be forgo=
t, but it is always lying=20

there dormant, and may arise sometime just when the young woman would most =
wish for respect=20

and love.  Men prize that which they have had difficulty in winning. The ap=
ple that drops, over-ripe,=20

at one=E2=80=99s feet is never quite so tempting as that which hangs just b=
eyond reach.         *       *       *=20

*       *  It is well for the matter of sex to be put out of mind in many o=
f the dealings between young=20

men and young women, but in the question of loverly attentions it can not b=
e ignored. And in this=20

matter it is the man, and the man only, who should make advances. It is bet=
ter for her peace of=20

mind that a girl should never have the marked attention of any man, than th=
at she should forget=20

her maidenly dignity in order to acquire it. Such acquisition is certainly =
not worth the price paid for=20

it.  A man must look up to that which he loves. And a hard-and-fast rule is=
 the slangy one that=20

declares that one does not run after a car when he has already caught it, o=
r when it stands at the=20

corner waiting for him, and ready to start or stand at his will. The girls =
for whom men find life worth=20

living are those who are ideals as well as companions.  [Sidenote: HANDS OF=
F]  Dear girls, be=20

happy, be merry, have all the harmless fun that the good God, who wishes yo=
u to be happy, sends=20

=E2=80=94for the sake of the=20

knowledge.         *       *       *       *       *  A serious mistake oft=
en made by girl students and=20

working girls is taking the men who call on them to their rooms. In most ca=
ses these rooms are=20

fitted up with couches to look much like sitting-rooms, but the men know th=
ey are _not_ sitting-

rooms, and the girl who receives men thus suffers for it in name if not in =
fact. It is a thing that a=20

self-respecting girl can not afford to do, even once. If she expects to hav=
e men call on her, she=20

must choose a room in a house where she may occasionally have the use of a =
parlor. The ruling=20



may seem hard, but there is no getting round it.         *       *       * =
      *       *  No young girl can=20

afford to accept a luncheon or dinner invitation from a married man or, ind=
eed, any attention=20

whatsoever. It does not matter that he may be an =E2=80=9Cold friend of the=
 family,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94those who see her=20

may not know this and, even if they do, may not acquit her of harm. For sim=
ilar=20


_
Good_, any reverses, _All is Good_, any sorrow, _All is Good_, any inharmon=
y, _All is Good_. In=20

everything at all that is out of perfection you must recognize only the goo=
d. ALL IS GOOD.=20

Sending your thought energy by repeating _All is Good_, and thinking _All i=
s Good_, and living=20

_All is Good_, you will actually, in this day, overcome your difficulty, an=
d turn all of your mistakes,=20

blunders and misfortunes into stepping stones for your own success, health =

_
I enter the Silence this month, this day, this hour and this minute. My min=

control of the Divine Spirit, I recognize here and now only good. I see in =

perfection and good. I see in nature all around me only perfection and good=
. I see in every=20

transaction of life only the perfect good. I see in every activity of my ex=
perience, and in every form,=20

color and thought, good. _All is Good_ for me now, today and forever.  God =
is spirit; spirit is love;=20

love is perfection; God's spirit is harmonious, I am perfect, I am love, pe=
rfection and harmonious.=20

ALL IS GOOD.         *       *       *       *       *    FOR HARMONY, PEAC=
E, COMFORT   Base your=20

thought for this Silence upon the following. You may add any constructive t=
hought you choose.=20

"My Subconscious Mind, I Desire and Command You to Have Peace, Harmony and =
Justice Reign=20

in the Hearts of Men Everywhere."  I realize that there can be no negative =
thinking for my=20

destruction, downfall or harm sent out by anyone else that can reach my con=
sciousness, or do me=20

ill, unless I am afraid that such negative thinking will produce the evil e=
ffects others are planning.  I=20

know that Thought is Energy. This is scientifically demonstrated, and I rea=
lize that a constructive=20

thought has much more energy than a destructive thought. I know, because it=
 has been=20

conclusively proven, that constructive thinking will blast away every negat=
ive thought-current sent=20

out by one person, or by a thousand.  Therefore, if there should be any inh=
armonious thoughts=20

anywhere in the world--any discordant thought-current by those who seek my =
downfall, or block=20

my progress, or by those who would endeavor to hurt my reputation--I know t=
hat by holding a=20

harmonious attitude of peace, love, joy and success for everyone, including=
 those who would do=20

me wrong that such constructive thought-currents will blast away all of the=
 discordant and=20

inharmonious mental currents of evil so that they will not even reach my co=
nscious mind.  I also=20

realize, when I hold my silent thought, "_my subconscious mind I desire and=
 command you to=20

have peace and harmony and justice reign_," that I am sending out the energ=
y of construction=20

which is bound to turn all of the efforts for my embarrassment and destruct=
ion into a higher current=20

for my greater achievement.  Therefore, I send out blessings and thanksgivi=
ng to the very ones=20

who would work my downfall. I charge my subconscious mind to let peace, har=
mony and justice=20

reign so that all things will work together for the good for me and for tho=
se who are thinking evil.  If=20

I should think it hard to send out blessings to my enemies, I remember the =
affirmation of the=20

Greatest Teacher of all ages Who said, "Forgive until seventy times seven."=
 I remember that when=20

He, Himself, was reviled, reviled not in turn. I remember that when His mer=
ciless enemies had=20

nailed Him to the cross, had apparently crushed His fondest ambition, had s=
corned and reviled the=20

Kingdom of which He had spoken, and had tortured Him as He hung on the cros=
s, He uttered the=20

immortal, lovable, constructive words which have rung throughout the centur=
ies, and will continue=20

to bless all mankind throughout eternity: "Father, forgive them, for they k=
now not what they do."=20

So those who would try to block my way, curb my progress or put thorns in m=
y crown are doing so=20

"not knowing what they are doing." "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he =
also reap." Instead of=20

hurting me, they are sowing weed seeds, which shall bring forth a harvest o=
f weeds and tares in=20

their own lives, and not in mine.  I, therefore, do not wish them harm, nor=
 think that they should=20

feel the reaction. I do not have to concern myself about the subjects. If y=
ou are to speak of a=20

woman who is to become a mother, say frankly that she is expecting or beari=
ng a child. The=20

euphemisms employed in place of this plain phrase are unspeakably vulgar. I=
t is never vulgar to=20

be frank if the person and the circumstances justify the introduction of th=
e subject at all. One must=20



often wish for more of the old-fashioned reserve on intimate topics. A crit=
ic of modern women said=20

of them recently: =E2=80=9CAmong themselves, women lose more delicacy than =
any man could take from=20

them.=E2=80=9D When one listens aghast to the talk of some modern women, on=
e can but echo the=20

statement. Akin to this unbecoming freedom of speech is the lack of conside=
ration sometimes=20

shown to an expectant mother by her friends. Comment in such instances one =
would suppose=20

would be recognized as the height of indelicacy, but thoughtlessly, and in =
a spirit of jest, remarks=20

are made that cause a sensitive person to wince. Unless the mother-to-be co=
nfides her sacred=20

expectations, she has every right to have them treated with the respect of =
silence, and only a=20

vulgar-minded woman will intrude upon her.     CHAPTER XXXI  OUR OWN AND OT=
HER=20

PEOPLE=E2=80=99S CHILDREN   CONSTANCE FENIMORE WOOLSON, in one of her novel=
s, thus=20

describes a discourtesy to which mothers of young children are much given: =
 =E2=80=9CTalking with a=20

mother when her children are in the room is the most trying thing conversat=
ionally; she listens to=20

you with one ear, but the other is listening to Johnnie; right in the midst=
 of something very pathetic=20

you are telling her she will give a sudden, perfectly irrelevant smile over=
 her baby=E2=80=99s last crow, and=20

your best story is hopelessly spoiled because she loses the point (although=
 she pretends she=20

hasn=E2=80=99t) while she arranges the sashes of Ethel and Totsie.=E2=80=9D=
  There is a protest in the paragraph=20

quoted that will find an answering groan in many a heart. Who of us does no=
t wish that mothers of=20

small children would adopt a few rules of ordinary politeness and courtesy,=
 and, when talking to a=20

guest, give attention that is not shared and almost monopolized by the chil=
d who happens to be=20

present?  [Sidenote: THE SMALL BOY]  Parents make the mistake of thinking t=
hat their children=20

must be as absorbingly interesting to all visitors and acquaintances as the=
y are to those to whom=20

they belong. This is a vast mistake. No matter how fond one may be of the y=
oung of his species,=20

one does enjoy a conversation into which they are not dragged, and talks wi=
th more freedom if=20

they are not present. Certainly it is far better for the child to learn to =
run off and amuse himself=20

than to sit by, listening to talk not meant for his ears. Those of us who w=
ere children many years=20

ago were not allowed to make nuisances of ourselves to the extent that chil=
dren of to-day do, and=20

surely we were happy. In one home there is a small boy, very good, and very=
 affectionate, whose=20

mother can not receive a caller without the presence of the ubiquitous infa=
nt. He sits still, his great=20

eyes fixed upon the face of the caller, and she feels ashamed for wishing t=

the room. Occasionally he varies the monotony by saying, =E2=80=9CMother, d=

pitiful. To talk so much to a child and of him in the presence of others th=
at he is a poseur at the=20
