philodendron monstera may find plenty of room there.  I have described in t=
his book the construction and completion of all that I could remember as ne=
cessary for general use in the public places of cities. In the following bo=
ok I shall consider private houses, their conveniences, and symmetrical pro=
portions.     BOOK VI     INTRODUCTION   1. It is related of the Socratic p=
hilosopher Aristippus that, being shipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast =
of the Rhodians, he should answer, Insomnia. As in the past, from habit I u=
ndress and go to bed exactly at midnight. I fall asleep quickly, but before=
 two o'clock I wake up and feel as though I had not slept at all. Sometimes=
 I get out of bed and light a lamp. For an hour or two I walk up and down t=
he room looking at the familiar photographs and pictures. When I am weary o=
f walking about, I sit down to my table. I sit motionless, thinking of noth=
ing, conscious of philodendron monstera may find plenty of room there.  I h=

2. But if we have a situation without natural advantages, and unfit to shel=
ter ships from storms, it is=20

obvious that we must proceed as follows. If there is no river in the neighb=
ourhood, but if there can=20

be a roadstead on one side, then, let the advances be made from the other s=
ide by means of walls=20

or embankments, and let the enclosing harbour be thus formed. Walls which a=
re to be under water=20

should be constructed as follows. Take the powder which comes from the coun=
try extending from=20

Cumae to the promontory of Minerva, and mix it in the mortar trough in the =
proportion of two to=20

one.  3. Then, in the place previously determined, a cofferdam, with its si=
des formed of oaken=20

stakes with ties between them, is to be driven down into the water and firm=
ly propped there; then,=20

the lower surface inside, under the water, must be levelled off and dredged=
, working from beams=20

laid across; and finally, concrete from the mortar trough--the stuff having=
 been mixed as=20

decorations that when he has occasion to put them on the students nickname =
him "The=20

Ikonstand." His acquaintances are of the most aristocratic; for the last tw=
enty-five or thirty years, at=20

any rate, there has not been one single distinguished man of learning in Ru=
ssia with whom he has=20

not been intimately acquainted. There is no one for him to make friends wit=
h nowadays; but if we=20

turn to the past, the long list of his famous friends winds up with such na=
mes as Pirogov, Kavelin,=20

and the poet Nekrasov, all of whom bestowed upon him a warm and sincere aff=
ection. He is a=20

member of all the Russian and of three foreign universities. And so on, and=
 so on. All that and a=20

great deal more that might be said makes up what is called my "name."  That=
 is my name as=20

known to the public. In Russia it is known to every educated man, and abroa=
d it is mentioned in=20

the lecture-room with the addition "honoured and distinguished." It is one =
of those fortunate names=20

to abuse which=20


_
space which was within the cofferdam is filled up by the wall. This, howeve=
r, is possessed as a gift=20

of nature by such places as have been described above.  But if by reason of=
 currents or the=20

assaults of the open sea the props cannot hold the cofferdam together, then=
, let a platform of the=20

greatest possible strength be constructed, beginning on the ground itself o=
r on a substructure; and=20

let the platform be constructed with a level surface for less than half its=
 extent, while the rest,=20

which is close to the beach, slopes down and out.  4. Then, on the water's =
edge and at the sides=20

of the platform, let marginal walls be constructed, about one and one half =
feet thick and brought up=20

to a level with the surface above mentioned; next, let the sloping part be =
filled in with sand and=20

levelled off with the marginal wall and the surface of the platform. Then, =
upon this level surface=20

construct a block as large as is required, and when it is finished, leave i=
t for not less than two=20

months to dry. Then, cut away the marginal wall which supports the sand. Th=
us, the sand will be=20

undermined by the waves, and this will cause the block to fall into the sea=
. By this method,=20

repeated as often as necessary, an advance into the water can be made.  5. =
But in places where=20

this powder is not found, the following method must be employed. A consider=
ed a sign of bad=20

taste. And that is as it should be. You see, my name is closely associated =
with the conception of a=20

highly distinguished man of great gifts and unquestionable usefulness. I ha=
ve the industry and=20

power of endurance of a camel, and that is important, and I have talent, wh=
ich is even more=20

important. Moreover, while I am on this subject, I am a well-educated, mode=
st, and honest fellow. I=20

have never poked my nose into literature or politics; I have never sought p=
opularity in polemics=20

with the ignorant; I have never made speeches either at public dinners or a=
t the funerals of my=20

friends.... In fact, there is no slur on my learned name, and there is no c=
omplaint one can make=20

against it. It is fortunate.  The bearer of that name, that is I, see mysel=
f as a man of sixty-two, with=20

a bald head, with false teeth, and with an incurable tic douloureux. I am m=
yself as dingy and=20

unsightly as my name is brilliant and splendid. My head and my hands trembl=
e with weakness; my=20

neck, as Turgenev says of one of his heroines, is like the handle of a doub=
le bass; my chest is=20

hollow; my shoulders narrow; when I talk or lecture, my mouth turns down at=
 one corner; when I=20

smile, my whole face is covered with aged-looking, deathly wrinkles. There =
is nothing impressive=20

about my pitiful figure; only, perhaps, when I have an=20


_
stakes fastened together with ties, should be constructed in the appointed =
place, and clay in=20

wicker baskets made of swamp rushes should be packed in among the props. Af=
ter this has been=20

well packed down and filled in as closely as possible, set up your water-sc=
rews, wheels, and=20

drums, and let the space now bounded by the enclosure be emptied and dried.=
 Then, dig out the=20

bottom within the enclosure. If it proves to be of earth, it must be cleare=
d out and dried till you=20

come to solid bottom and for a space wider than the wall which is to be bui=
lt upon it, and then filled=20

in with masonry consisting of rubble, lime, and sand.  6. But if the place =
proves to be douloureux=20

my face wears a peculiar expression, the sight of which must have roused in=
 every one the grim=20

and impressive thought, "Evidently that man will soon die."  I still, as in=
 the past, lecture fairly well;=20

I can still, as in the past, hold the attention of my listeners for a coupl=
e of hours. My fervour, the=20

literary skill of my exposition, and my humour, almost efface the defects o=
f my voice, though it is=20

harsh, dry, and monotonous as a praying beggar's. I write poorly. That bit =
of my brain which=20

presides over the faculty of authorship refuses to work. My memory has grow=
n weak; there is a=20

lack of sequence in my ideas, and when I put them on paper it=20


_
piles made of charred alder or olive wood, and then filled in with charcoal=
 as has been prescribed=20

in the case of the foundations of theatres and the city wall. Finally, buil=
d the wall of dimension=20

stone, with the bond stones as long as possible, so that particularly the s=
tones in the middle may=20

be held together by the joints. Then, fill the inside of the wall with brok=
en stone or masonry. It will=20

thus be possible for even a tower to be built upon it.  7. When all this is=
 finished, the general rule=20

for shipyards will be to build them facing the north. Southern exposures fr=
om their heat produce=20

rot, the wood worm, shipworms, and all sorts of other destructive creatures=
, and strengthen and=20

keep them alive. And these buildings must by no means be constructed of woo=
d, for fear of fire. As=20

for their size, no definite limit need be set, but they must be built to su=
it the largest type of organic=20

connection; my construction is monotonous; my language is poor and timid. O=
ften I write what I do=20

not mean; I have forgotten the beginning when I am writing the end. Often I=
 forget ordinary words,=20

and I always have to waste a great deal of energy in avoiding superfluous p=
hrases and=20

unnecessary parentheses in my letters, both unmistakable proofs of a declin=
e in mental activity.=20

And it is noteworthy that the simpler the letter the more painful the effor=
t to write it. At a scientific=20

article I feel far more intelligent and at ease than at a letter of congrat=
ulation or a minute of=20

proceedings. Another point: I find it easier to write German or English tha=
n to write Russian.  As=20

regards my present manner of life, I must give a foremost place to the inso=
mnia from which I have=20

suffered of late. If I were asked what constituted the chief and fundamenta=
l feature of my existence=20

now,=20
