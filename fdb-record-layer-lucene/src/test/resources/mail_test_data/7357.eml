 you were tempted to give up a good living to go to the _
Ancient Wood for certain plants of healing. One he crushed and laid upon th=
e wound to stanch the=20

blood. Others he set out in the ground close under the young man's nose, so=
 that they seemed to=20

be growing naturally there.  Presently the woodman opened his eyes and star=
ed about him=20

dazedly, but the Old Gnome had hidden himself. As he gained strength, the w=
oodman tore a strip=20

of linen and bound it upon his leg. Then, sniffing the aromatic herbs which=
 grew conveniently at=20

hand, he plucked a bunch with which to make a lotion, and with it limped pa=
infully from the wood.=20

The Old Gnome watched him go with curious eyes. "I wonder if he will return=
," he said to himself.=20

And he decided not to sleep until he should know how it fared with the youn=
g man.  It was not=20

many days thereafter before the woodman returned to the forest. The lotion =
had been wondrous=20

helpful, and had healed him more quickly than he had dared to hope; for he =
was eager to be at=20

work again. Limping slightly, for the wound had been a sore one, David bega=
n work anew.  Day by=20

day the Old Gnome watched him, half jealously at first. But the more he wat=
ched the more he liked=20

the ways of the intruder. The woodman sang at his work; his eyes sparkled a=
nd his lips smiled as=20

if with pleasant thoughts.  The Old Gnome found himself smiling too, unseen=
 behind the fern. "I=20

will not sleep yet awhile," he  "Are you looking out for her now?" I asked,=
 somewhat abruptly.=20

"Yes, my dear friend," said John; "I hope to find in England some Christian=
 young person as a=20

yoke-mate."  There was a self-satisfied roll of his eye as he said this, wh=
ich took away from me all=20

further desire for the bacon and eggs I had just put on my plate.  "Dear Mr=
 Chundango," said Lady=20

Broadhem, "tell us some of your adventures as a catechist in the Bombay Gha=
uts. Did you give up=20

all when you became one? Was your family noble? and did you undergo much pe=
rsecution from=20

them?"  "The Rajah of Sattara is my first cousin," said Chundango, unblushi=
ngly; "but they=20

repudiated me when I became a Christian, and deny the relationship."  "Are =
you going up to=20

Convocation?" said Dickiefield to the Bishop, to divert attention from Chun=
dango's last barefaced=20

assertion. "I hear they are going to take some further action about the jud=
gment on the 'Essays=20

and Reviews.'"  "Yes," said Joseph; "and I see there is a chance of three n=
ew sees being created.=20

I should like to talk over the matter with you. Considering how seriously m=
y health has suffered in=20

the tropics, and how religiously I have adhered to my Liberal opinions in p=
olitics even in the most=20

trying climates, it might be worth while----"  "Excuse me for interrupting =
you, my dear lord," said=20

Dickiefield, "but the present Government are not so=20


_
In the night when the Ancient Wood was silent he toiled long and heartily a=
t the crafts wherein he=20

was wise. And the woodman tasted the result. For the Old Gnome made the ber=
ries to ripen more=20

quickly in that glade. He caused delicious mushrooms to spring up all about=
. He coaxed a spring=20

of fair water from the bed where it slumbered underground and made it gush =
into a little basin=20

where David came upon it gladly. He caused medicinal herbs to grow, and cer=
tain fragrant plants=20

that drove away the mischievous insects sent by his brother Gnomes. All thi=
s the Old One did=20

while David was away; and the young man did not know. But he was very happy=
 and busy. Now,=20

one day the young man finished his woodcutting, and lo! he had made a clear=
ing in the Ancient=20

Wood large enough for a tiny house; but the Gnome did not know this. David =
looked about him at=20

the spring and the flowers and the berries of the pleasant place which the =
Old Gnome had=20

prepared, and said, "It is good!" Forthwith of the logs which he had felled=
 he began to build the=20

house itself.  When the Old Gnome saw what David was about to do, indeed he=
 was angry! For he=20

said,--  "Oho! I did not bargain for this. This is my wood! I want no neigh=
bor,--though a merry=20

visitor was not unwelcome. What is to become of my solitude, of my hermitag=
e? And how am I to=20

sleep, with another restless creature living close by forever and ever?"  F=
or several days he sulked=20

in his cell and would not work. But finally the merry sound of the young ma=
n's whistle keeping time=20

to the wheeze of saw and the knock of hammer made the Old Gnome smile again=
, and he said to=20

himself,--  "Well, what of it? True, I shall have a neighbor for good and a=
ll. But he will be alone and=20

speechless, since there is no one with whom to chatter; and he will never t=
heological views of their=20

bishops. When you remember that the Prime Minister of this country is held =
morally accountable=20

for the orthodoxy of its religious tenets, you must at once perceive how es=
sential it is, not only that=20

he should be profoundly versed in points of Scriptural doctrine himself, bu=
t that he should never=20

appoint a bishop of whose soundness he is not from personal knowledge thoro=
ughly satisfied."  "I=20

have no objection to talk over the more disputed points with him," said the=
 Bishop. "When do you=20

think he could spare a moment?"  "The best plan would be," replied Dickiefi=
eld, with a twinkle in=20

his eye, "to catch him in the lobby of the House some evening when there is=
 nothing particular=20

going on. What books of reference would you require?"  The Bishop named one=
, when I=20

interrupted him, for I felt Dickiefield had not put the case fairly as rega=
rded the first Minister of the=20

Crown.  "It is not the Premier's fault at all," said I; "he may be the most=
 liberal theologian possible,=20

but he has nothing to do with doctrine; that lies in the Chancellor's depar=
tment. As the supreme=20

arbiter in points of religious belief, and as the largest dispenser of spir=
itual patronage in the=20

kingdom, it is evident that the qualifications for a Lord Chancellor should=
 be not so much his=20

knowledge of law, as his unblemished moral character and incapacity for per=
petrating jobs. He is,=20

in fact, the principal veterinary surgeon of the ecclesiastical stable, and=
 any man in orders that he=20

'warrants sound' cannot be objected to on the score of orthodoxy. The Prime=
 Minister is just in the=20

same position as the head of any other department,--whoever passes the comp=
etitive examination=20

he is bound to accept, but may use his own discretion as to promotion, and,=
 of course, sticks to=20

the=20


_
David builded his house; and a pretty little place it was, for he was a car=
eful workman and his=20

heart was in it. When all was done he laid the axe aside, hid the hammer an=
d saw, put on fine new=20

clothes and went away across the meadow, whistling happily as a bird. It wa=
s the Gnome's first=20

chance to see the inside of a man's dwelling, and he lost no time in fact i=
s, if you go into the=20

Colonial Episcopal line you get over the heads of a lot of men who are stea=
dily plodding on for=20

home promotion, and, of course they don't think it fair for an outsider to =
come back again, and cut=20

them out of a palace and the patronage attached to it on the strength of ha=
ving been a missionary=20

bishop. It is just the same in the=20
