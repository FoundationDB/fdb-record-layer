Farther on, when he was no longer in the first lilting flush of the new imp=

long summer day the edges of the chasm of the years drew closer together; a=

afternoon, his father put him on a horse and rode with him to a corner of t=
he vast home domain, a=20

corner fenced off by sentinel cottonwoods and watered by the single small i=
rrigation ditch of his=20

childish recollections; rode with him through the screening cottonwoods and=
 showed him, lying=20

beyond them, the old ranch buildings of the "Circle-Bar," untouched and und=
isturbed; his heart=20

was full and a sudden mist came before his eyes to dim the picture.  "I've =
kept it all just as it used=20

to be, Evan," the father said gently. "I thought maybe you'd come back some=
 day and be sure-

enough disappointed if it were gone."  The younger man slipped from his sad=
dle and went to look=20

in at the open door of the old ranch-house. Everything was precisely as he =
remembered it: the=20

ain steered the Maud=20

directly towards the shore, while the steamer was making not over five knot=
s an hour. He kept one=20

eye on the rocky cone on the starboard hand, which was an elevation on the =
enormous ledge of=20

half an acre.  "Where's the bottom, Morris?" he called to the first officer=
 when the steamer was=20

abreast of the cone.  "Thirteen feet down," returned Morris.  "Heave the le=
ad on the port hand,=20

Flix," added the captain very quietly; and he seemed to be still in a brown=
 study.  "Mark under=20

water two," reported the Milesian.  "Give the depth in feet now."  "Thirtee=
n feet, short."  "Keep the=20

lead going."  For about a quarter of a mile farther Scott kept the Maud mov=
ing in the same=20

direction, with no change in the reports of the soundings. The great ledge =
could still be seen from=20

the windows of the pilot-house; but suddenly the color changed to a darker =
hue. At this point the=20

captain threw the helm over to port, and changed the course from south-west=
 to north-west, a full=20

quarter of a circle. The=20

now the gaping chasm=20

had nothing to do on the forecastle, and he returned to the pilot-house, wh=

at the door on the starboard side, where he could look down into the clear =
water as the others=20

were doing. The ledge still presented the same appearance; that of a smooth=
 surface, though with=20

many seams and protuberances upon it.  "You seem to have found a channel in=

Captain Scott," said Louis, after he had watched the indications for some t=
