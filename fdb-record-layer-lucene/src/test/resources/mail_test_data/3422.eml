Tea was set out on little basket tables in the veranda, and there were all =
the delicious home-made=20

things for which the Villa Bleue had gained a just reputation--brown scones=
 and honey, potato=20

cakes, Scotch shortbread, buttered oatmeal biscuits, iced lemon sandwich ca=
ke, and chocolate=20

fingers.  When tea was taken away and the basket tables were once more free=
, Mrs. Clark=20

produced dainty cards and scarlet pencils and organized a competition. It w=
as entitled "Nursery=20

Rhymes," and contained twenty questions to be answered by the competitors. =
These ran as=20

follows:   NURSERY RHYMES COMPETITION            1. Who made Cock Robin's s=
hroud?=20

2. Who was exhausted by family cares?            3. Who disliked insects?  =
          4. Who showed an=20

interest in           horticulture?            5. Who summoned an orchestra=
?            6. Who pursued=20

matrimonial intentions           without the parental sanction?            =
7. Who showed religious=20

intolerance?            8. Who took a joint that did not belong           t=
o him?            9. Who deplored=20

the loss of hand gear?            10. Whose salary was restricted owing to =
          slackness in work?=20

11. What animal pursued horological           investigations?            12=
. Who made the record high=20

jump?            13. Who wore a superfluity of jewelry?            14. Whos=
e culinary efforts were=20

temporarily confiscated?            15. Who pulled Pussy from the well?    =
        16. Who slept instead=20

of attending to           business?            17. Who exhibited sanctimoni=
ous           satisfaction over a=20

meal?            18. Who lost a number of domestic           animals?      =
      19. Who had an accident=20

during the           performance of their duty?            20. Who was muti=
lated by a bird?  Some of the=20

questions seemed easy and some were difficult. The girls sat puzzling over =
them, and writing the=20

answers when they got inspiration. Irene scribbled away delightedly, but Lo=
rna, who had almost=20

forgotten the nursery rhymes of her childhood, was in much mystification, a=
nd only filled in a few of=20

the vacant spaces. Numbers 6, 7, 13 and 14 proved the most baffling and no =
one was able to=20

solve all twenty.  After allowing a considerable laxity in respect of time =
Mrs. Clark rang the bell and=20

of the calcareous formation and the diabasis.  The transverse valley which =
descends from Piedras=20

Negras and the village of San Juan, towards Parapara and the Llanos, is fil=
led with trap-rocks,=20

displaying close affinity with the formation of green slates, which they co=
ver. Sometimes we seem=20

to see serpentine, sometimes grunstein, and sometimes dolerite and basalt. =
The arrangement of=20

these problematical masses is not less extraordinary. Between San Juan, Mal=
paso, and Piedras=20

Azules, they form strata parallel to each other; and dipping regularly nort=
hward at an angle of 40 or=20

50 degrees, they cover even the green slates in concordant stratification. =
Lower down, towards=20

Parapara and Ortiz, where the amygdaloids and phonolites are connected with=
 the grunstein,=20

everything assumes a basaltic aspect. Balls of grunstein heaped one upon an=
other, form those=20

rounded cones, which are found so frequently in the Mittelgebirge in Bohemi=
a, near Bilin, the=20

country of phonolites. The following is the result of my partial observatio=
ns.  The grunstein, which=20

at first alternated with strata of serpentine, or was connected with that r=
ock by insensible=20

transitions, is seen alone, sometimes in strata considerably inclined, and =
sometimes in balls with=20

concentric strata, imbedded in strata of the same substance. It lies, near =
Malpaso, on green=20

slates, steatitic, mingled with hornblende, destitute of mica and grains of=
 quartz, dipping, like the=20

grunsteins, 45 degrees toward the north, and directed, like them, 75 degree=
s north-west.  A great=20

sterility prevails where these green slates predominate, no doubt on accoun=
t of the magnesia they=20

contain, which (as is proved by the magnesian-limestone of England*) is ver=
y hurtful to vegetation.=20

(* Magnesian limestone is of a straw-yellow colour, and contains madrepores=
: it lies beneath red=20



marl, or muriatiferous red sandstone.) The dip of the green slates continue=
s the same; but by=20

degrees the direction of their strata becomes parallel to the general direc=
tion of the primitive rocks=20

of the chain of the coast. At Piedras Azules these slates, mingled with hor=
nblende, cover in=20

concordant stratification a blackish-blue slate, very fissile, and traverse=
d by small veins of quartz.=20

The green slates include some strata of grunstein, and even contain balls o=
