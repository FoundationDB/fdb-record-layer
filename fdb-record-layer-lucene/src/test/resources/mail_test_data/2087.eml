 The circumstances were eminently conducive to the felicity which is deriva=

nruffled sheet of glassy water lay spread out _
soul racked with remorse to the daughter whom he had so cruelly wronged.  W=

shaft of light had revealed to her the presence of that inert form upon the=
 steps, she had struggled=20

to her feet and--dazed--had tottered up to it. Even before she had touched =
the face, the hands,=20

before she had bent her ear to the half-closed mouth and failed to catch th=

An unspeakable sense of horror filled her soul. The thought that he--the pr=
