Mr. Cameron and Tom, who sat before the fire in the living hall.  "I couldn=
't sleep anyway," said=20

Tom, "with Helen and Ruth out in the cold. It's dreadful, Dad. I feel that =
we boys are partly to=20

blame, too."  "How's that?" his father asked him.  "Why, the girls were mad=
 with us. I let Isadore go=20

too far with his joking," and he told Mr. Cameron about the spoiled taffy. =
"If we hadn't done that to=20

them of course they wouldn't have gone into the woods without us--"  "But I=
 am afraid you lads=20

would have been no more cautious than the girls," interposed Mr. Cameron. "=
This storm would=20

have taken you by surprise just the same."  "But we could have been with th=
em and helped them."=20

"I have great faith in that little Fielding girl's good sense--and Madge St=
eele is to be trusted," said=20

his father. "Don't blame yourself, boy. It was something entirely unforesee=
n."  Several times during=20

the night Mr. Cameron tried to communicate with the neighbors over the tele=
phone; but some=20

disaster had overtaken the line and it probably could not be repaired until=
 after the storm.  About=20

five o'clock Long Jerry came into the room. He had been out into the storm,=
 for he was covered=20

with snow.  "How does it look?" asked Mr. Cameron, earnestly.  "She's going=
 to break with sun-

up," prophesied the woodsman. "I've been feeding the cattle and I've got th=
e other men up. If it=20

breaks at all, we three'll start for the neighbors and rouse a gang to help=
 beat the woods."  "But=20

hadn't we better try to find the girls at once, Jerry?" queried Tom.  "We'l=
l need a large party,=20

Master Tom," said the guide. "We must cover a deal of ground, and the more =
men we have who=20

are used to the trail, the better. If it stops snowing we can get around to=
 the neighbors on=20

snowshoes easier than any other way. The drifts are packed hard. I had to t=
unnel out of the=20

kitchen door. The snow has banked up to the second story gallery."  "They'l=
l be buried yards under=20

this snow," groaned Tom.  "Keep up your courage," said Long Jerry, cheerful=
ly. "If them gals was=20

sharp at all they'd find some shelter and make a fire."  "If they had match=
es," said Mr. Cameron,=20

doubtfully.  "Ruth had matches, I know," said Tom.  "Oh, we'll find them sa=
fe and sound," declared=20

the guide.  One of Long Jerry's prophecies was fulfilled within the hour. T=
he storm broke. Tom had=20

aroused his friends and the three boys had enlarged the tunnel through the =
snow from the back=20

porch into the yard, and were shoveling a passageway to the stables. The la=
st flakes of the=20

blizzard fluttered down upon them, and the tail of the gale blew the clouds=
 to tatters and revealed=20

the almost black sky with the stars sparkling like points of living fire.  =
"Hurrah!" cried Bob Steele.=20

"It's over!"  The guide and the two other men were already getting on their=
 snowshoes, having=20

eaten hurriedly by the kitchen fire. They started out at once to rouse the =
neighbors. By sunrise the=20

sky was entirely clear and the visitors to the backwoods could climb to the=
 second floor gallery of=20

the lodge and look out over the great drifts. In places like bees, all murm=
urous and unresting--

these were the discoveries he made. Rolls grew nervous, almost hysterical, =
in the unusual quiet.=20

What would he not have given for his plate to polish, or his lamps to trim!=
 He had been allowed to=20

have what are called writing materials,--a few dingy sheets of notepaper, a=
 penny bottle of ink, a=20

rusty steel pen--but Rolls was not accustomed to literary composition; and =
a few books--but Rolls=20

was scornful of what he called "novelles," and considered even more serious=
 reading, as an=20

occupation which required thought and a mind free of care. And nobody came =
to see him. He had=20

no effusion of gratitude and sweet praise from his master. Mr Monypenny was=
 Rolls's only visitor,=20

who came to take all his explanations, and get a perfect understanding of h=
ow his case ought to=20

be conducted. The butler had become rather limp and feeble before even Mr M=
onypenny=20

appeared.  "I'm maybe not worthy of much," Rolls said, with a wave of his h=
and, "but I think there's=20



one or two might have come to see me--one or two."  "I think so too, Rolls;=
 but it is not want of=20

feeling. I have instructions from Mr Erskine to spare no expense; to have t=
he very best man that=20

can be had. And I make no doubt we'll carry you through. I'm thinking of tr=
ying Jardine, who is at=20

the very top of the tree."  "And what will that cost, if I may make so bold=
, Mr Monypenny?"  When=20

he heard the sum that was needed for the advocate's fee, Rolls's countenanc=
e fell, but his spirit=20

rose. "Lord bless us!" he said,--"a' that for standing up and discoursing b=
efore the Court! And most=20

of them are real well pleased to hear themselves speak, if it were without =
fee or reward. I think=20

shame to have a' that siller spent upon me; but it's a grand thing of the y=
oung master, and a great=20

compliment: it will please Bauby too."  "He ought to have come to see you,-=
-so old a servant, and=20

a most faithful one," said Mr Monypenny.  "Well-a-well, sir, there's many t=
hings to be said: a=20

gentleman has things to do; there's a number of calls upon his time. He wou=
ld mean well, I make=20

no doubt, and then he would forget; but to put his hand in his pocket like =
that! Bauby will be very=20

well pleased. I am glad, poor woman, that she has the like of that to keep =
up her heart."  "Well,=20

Rolls, I am glad to see that you are so grateful. Thinking over all the cir=
cumstances, and that you=20

lost no time in giving the alarm, and did your best to have succour carried=
 to him, I think I may say=20

that you will be let off very easy. I would not be astonished if you were d=
ischarged at once. In any=20

case it will be a light sentence. You may keep your mind easy about that." =
 "It's all in the hands of=20

Providence," said Rolls. He was scarcely willing to allow that his position=
 was one to be=20

considered so cheerfully. "It will be a grand exhibition o' eloquence," he =
said; "and will there be as=20

much siller spent, and as great an advocate on the other side, Mr Monypenny=
? It's a wonderful=20

elevating thought to think that the best intellects in the land will be war=
stlin' ower a simple body like=20


_
off over these drifts and back again as easily as they would have walked on=
 six inches of snow.=20

They brought with them six other men, who also sat down to breakfast in the=
 big kitchen, while Mr.=20

Cameron and the boys and Mrs. Murchiston finished their meal in the dining-=
room. To the surprise=20

of the visitors to the camp, one of the men whom Long Jerry had brought in =
to help find the girls=20

was the Rattlesnake Man, as he was called.  "We found him poking about the =
woods by himself,=20

sir," said Long Jerry, privately, to Mr. Cameron. "He says there's been a b=
oy staying with him for a=20

while back, and that he started out hunting just before the storm. The old =
hermit was looking for=20

him. By what he says, I believe it's the same boy you folks was bringing up=
 here-the one that=20

claims to be Fred Hatfield."  "That poor fellow may have lost himself in th=
e blizzard, too, eh?"=20

returned the merchant. "Let us hope we will find them all safely."  In fift=
een minutes the whole=20

party started from the lodge on snowshoes, the boys dragging their toboggan=
s and the men=20

carrying food and hot coffee in vacuum bottles. They separated into four pa=
rties; the three boys=20

and Jerry Todd kept together. Jerry believed that the girls would have drif=
ted some with the storm=20

and therefore he struck off due east from the house.  In an hour they came =
back to the bank of the=20

stream near where Ruth and Reno had their adventure with the panther.  "If =
old Reno had been=20

well enough to come with us, he would have scented them in a hurry," declar=
ed Tom. "See the=20

creek! it's completely smothered in snow."  They followed the course of the=
 stream for some=20

distance and found the banks growing more steep. Suddenly Jerry began to sn=
iff the keen air, and=20

in a moment he cried:  "There's a fire near, boys. Somebody is burning pine=
 boughs--and there=20

isn't any house near, that I can swear to!"  They hurried on. Inside of hal=
f a mile Isadore descried a=20

column of blue smoke ahead. They began to shout at once, and it was not lon=
g before answering=20

cries delighted them.  "That's Madge yelling," declared Bob. "I'd know her =
warwhoop anywhere."=20

Tom had set out as fast as he could travel, the toboggan jumping after him =
over the drifts. Even=20

Busy Izzy grew excited, and yelled like a good fellow as he joined in the c=
hase. They all ran down=20

the bed of the stream and reached a deep cut where the banks  "And that is =
true, Rolls; they will=20

just warstle over ye--it will be a treat to hear it. And if I get Jardine, =
he will do it _con amore_, for=20

he's a sworn enemy to the Procurator, and cannot bide the Lord Advocate. He=
's a tremendous=20

speaker when he's got a good subject; and he'll do it _con amore_."  "Well-=
a-well, sir; if it's con=20

amoray or con onything else, sae long as he can convince the jury," said Ro=
lls. He was pleased=20

with the importance of this point of view; but when Mr Monypenny left him, =
it required all his=20

strength of mind to apply this consolation. "If they would but do it quick,=
 I wouldna stand upon the=20

honour of the thing," he said to himself.  Next day, however, he had a visi=
tor who broke the tedium=20

very effectually. Rolls could not believe his eyes when his door suddenly o=
pened, and Lord Rintoul=20

came in. The young man was very much embarrassed, and divided, apparently, =
between a=20

somewhat fretful shame and a desire to show great cordiality. He went so fa=
r as to shake hands=20

with Rolls, and then sat down on the only chair, not seeming to know what t=
o do next. At length he=20

burst forth, colouring up to his hair, "I want to know what made you say th=
at?--for you know it's not=20

true."  Rolls, surprised greatly by his appearance at all, was thunderstruc=
k by this sudden demand.=20

"I don't just catch your meaning, my lord," he said.  "Oh, my meaning--my m=
eaning is not very=20

difficult. What are you here for? Is it on Erskine's account? Did he make a=
ny arrangement? What=20

is he to do for you?" said Rintoul hurriedly. "It is all such a mystery to =
me, I don't know what to=20

make of it. When I heard you say it, I could not believe my ears."  Rolls l=
ooked at him with a very=20



steady gaze--a gaze which gradually became unbearable to the young man. "Do=
n't stare at me,"=20

he cried roughly, "but answer me. What is the meaning of it?--that's what I=
 want to know."  "Your=20

lordship," said Rolls, slowly, "is beginning at the hinder end of the subji=
k, so far as I can see.=20

Maybe ye will tell me first, my lord, what right ye have to come into a jye=
l that belangs to the=20

Queen's maist sacred Majesty, as the minister says, and question me, a pers=
on awaiting my trial?=20

Are ye a commissioner, or are ye an advocate, or maybe with authority from =
the Procurator=20

himsel'? I never heard that you had anything to do with the law."  "I'm sur=
e I beg your pardon," said=20


_
high on either hand.  Up the white slope of the left hand bank was a small =
plateau on which the fire=20

was burning. Some sort of a camp had been established, surrounded by an emb=
ankment of=20

tramped snow. Over this fortress the heads of all six of the girls became v=
isible, all crying out to=20

their rescuers in such a medley of exclamations that no one was understanda=
ble.  "Helen! Ruth!"=20

cried Tom. "Are you all right?"  "We're right as right can be, Tommy," retu=
rned his sister, gaily.=20

"We're not!" squealed Jennie Stone. "We're almost starved to death. If you =
haven't brought=20

anything for us to eat, don't dare come up here, for we've turned cannibals=
 and we're just about to=20

cast lots to see who should first be sacrificed to the general good!"  But =
there was more than=20

laughter to season this rescue. Some tears of relief were shed, and even Is=
adore Phelps showed=20

some shame-faced joy that the catastrophe had resulted in no worse hardship=
s for the girls. He=20

said to Heavy:  "I'm sorry I spoiled that old taffy. If you'd eaten your fu=
ll share of _that_ the other=20

day, I expect you wouldn't have suffered so from hunger."  The only person =
who was seriously=20

troubled by the adventure was the strange boy. He had suffered severely In =
the storm and now he=20

could scarcely move for pains in his back and legs. Otherwise it is doubtfu=
l if he would not have=20

run when he heard Long Jerry's voice among the rescuers.  "Great nothing to=
 do with the law. I=20

daresay I'm very abrupt. I don't know how to put it, you know; but you reme=
mber I was there--at=20

least I wasn't far off: I was--the first person that came. They'll call me =
for a witness at the trial, I=20

suppose. Can't you see what a confusing sort of thing it is for me. I _know=
_, you know. Don't you=20

know I _know_? Why, how could you have done it when it was----Look here, it=
 would be a great=20

relief to me, and to another--to--a lady--who takes a great interest in you=
--if you would speak out=20

plain."  The eyes of Rolls were small and grey,--they were not distinguishe=
d by any brightness or=20

penetrating quality; but any kind of eyes, when fixed immovably upon a man'=
s face, especially a=20

man who has anything to hide, become insupportable, and burn holes into his=
 very soul. Rintoul=20

pushed away his chair, and tried to avoid this look. Then he perceived, sud=
denly, that he had=20

appropriated the only chair, and that Rolls, whom he had no desire to irrit=
ate, but quite the reverse,=20

was standing. He rose up hastily and thrust the chair towards him. "Look he=
re," he said, "hadn't=20

you better sit down? I didn't observe it was the only seat in the--room."  =
"They call this a cell, my=20

lord, and we're in a jyel, not a private mansion. I'm a man biding the cour=
se of the law."  "Oh yes,=20

yes, yes! I know all that: why should you worry me?" cried Rintoul. He want=
ed to be civil and=20

friendly, but he=20


_
cowering boy. "How did you get here? Do you mean to say you are alive, Fred=
 Hatfield? Why, they=20

buried you--"  "No, they didn't!" snarled the boy. "They only thought they =
did."  "And you've let 'em=20

think all this time that you were shot--and poor 'Lias in jail? Well! you a=
lways was a mean little=20

scamp, Fred "We are all in a muddle," he said, "and don't see a step before=
 us. Why have you=20

done it? What object had he in asking you, or you in doing it? Can't you te=
ll me? I'll make it all=20

square with Erskine if you'll tell me: and I should know better what to do.=
"  "You take a great=20

interest in me--that was never=20


_
Hatfield!"  But Ruth would not let the guide scold the boy any more. "He's =
very sick, Mr. Todd," she=20

said. "He'll have to be carried to the lodge. I believe it is rheumatism, a=
nd he ought to have a=20

doctor at once."  "Lucky he is down and out, then," muttered the guide, "or=
 I'd be tempted to lay=20

him across my knee and spank him right here and now!"  The girls were very =
thankful indeed for=20

the hot drink and the food that had been brought. Jerry signaled with his r=
ifle and brought the=20

whole party to the spot within the hour, including the Rattlesnake Man. But=
 when the old hermit=20

saw that the boy was found he would stop no longer.  "Let his folks look af=
ter him. I gave him=20

shelter; but he's a bad boy, I reckon. And he doesn't like my children. I d=
on't want anybody about=20

my place that doesn't like my children. Now, that little girl," he added, p=
ointing to Ruth, "_she_=20

wasn't afraid of them; was you?"  "Not much," returned Ruth, bravely. "And =
I'm coming to see you=20

again, sir, if I can."  "You may come at any time, and welcome," answered t=
he Rattlesnake Man,=20

with a low bow. "Maybe you would like to learn how to handle my pets," he a=
dded, with a queer=20

grin.  "What, the snakes!" screamed Helen.  "No, I don't think I'd care to =
do that," replied Ruth.=20

"They would not hurt you-they soon learn to know their friends-and they get=
 to be as friendly as=20

even a servant in your lordship's family. It's awfu' sudden," said Rolls; "=
but I'll tell you what, my=20

lord,--I'll make a bargain with you. If you'll tell me what reason you have=
 for wanting to ken, I will=20

tell you whatfor I'm here."  Rintoul looked at Rolls with a confused and an=
xious gaze, knowing that=20

the latter on his side was reading him far more effectually. "You see," he =
said, "I was--somewhere=20

about the wood. I--I don't pretend to mean that I could--see what you were =
about exactly,--but--but=20

I _know_, you know!" cried Rintoul confusedly; "that's just my reason--and =
I want you to tell me=20

what's the meaning? I don't suppose you can like being here," he said, glan=
cing round; "it must be=20

dreadful slow work,--nothing to do. You remember Miss Barrington, who alway=
s took so great an=20

interest in you? Well, it was she----She--would like to know."  "Oh ay, Mis=
s Nora," said Rolls. "Miss=20

Nora was a young lady I likit weel. It was a great wish of mine, if we ever=
 got our wishes in this=20

world, that Dalrulzian and her might have drawn together. She was awfu' fon=
d of the place."=20

"Dalrulzian and----! I suppose you think there's nobody like Dalrulzian, as=
 you call him," cried=20

Rintoul, red with anger, but forcing a laugh. "Well, I don't know if it was=
 for his sake or for your=20

sake, Rolls; but Miss Nora--wanted to know----"  "And your lordship cam' a'=
=20


_
a name for each one of them," he went on, somewhat proudly.  "Maybe I'll--I=
'll look at them-but I=20

won't want to touch them," answered Ruth. A few minutes later the strange R=
attlesnake Man took=20

his departure.  Fred Hatfield and the girls were all packed upon the sleds =
and drawn over the snow=20

to the camp, where the rescued and rescuers arrived in safety before noon. =
But the girls had been=20

through such an experience, and were so exhausted, that as soon as dinner w=
as over they were=20

commanded to go to bed, while one of the men started to town for a doctor t=
o attend young=20

Hatfield.  "And be sure and take set up with a lord to do her errands," sai=
d Rolls. "And there's few=20

things I would refuse to Miss Nora; but my ain private affairs are--well, m=
y lord, they're just my ain=20

private affairs. I'm no' bound to unburden my bosom, except at my ain will =
and pleasure, if it was to=20

the Queen hersel'."  "That is quite true--quite true, Rolls. Jove! what is =
the use of making=20

mysteries?--if I was ignorant, don't you see! but we're both in the same bo=
x. I was--his brother-in-

law, you know; that made it so much worse for me. Look here! you let me run=
 on, and let out all=20

sort of things."  "Do you mean to tell me,=20
