they were brought by the Abyssinian traders to be sold for the Turkish hare=

They are exceedingly proud and high-spirited, and are remarkably quick at l=
earning. At Khartoum,=20

several of the Europeans of high standing have married these charming ladie=
s, who have=20

invariably rewarded their husbands by great affection and devotion. The pri=

beauties of nature at Gallabat was from twenty-five to forty dollars.  On t=
he 24th April we were=20

refreshed by a shower of rain, and in a few days the grass sprang from the =
ground several inches=20

high. There was an unpleasant dampness in the air, and, although the rainy =
season would not=20

commence until June, showers would occasionally fall among the mountains th=
roughout the month=20

of May. I accordingly purchased a number of large tanned ox-hides, that are=
 rendered waterproof=20

by a preparation with milk. These skins cost the trifling sum of nine piast=
res each (not two=20

shillings), and were subsequently of great value during our White Nile expe=
dition, as coverlets=20

during the night's bivouac, &c.  The horse-fair was a disappointment. At th=
is season the entire=20

country in the neighbourhood of Gallabat was subject to an epidemic, fatal =
to these animals;=20

therefore there were no good horses present. I had nothing to detain me at =
