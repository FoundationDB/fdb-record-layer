wafting down from the cool regions of the Northwest, where lay the new El Dorado--the land of 

gold.  Fearless Frank bestrode a noble bay steed of fire and nerve, while old General Nix rode an 

extra mule that he had purchased of Charity Joe. The remainder of the company rode in the 

wagons or "hoofed it," as best suited their mood--walking sometimes being preferable to the 

rumbling and jolting of the heavy vehicles. determining to have only the best, he saved his 

luncheon money, walked instead of riding the five miles to his Brooklyn home, and, after a period 

of saving, had his reward in the first purchase from his own earnings: a set of the 

_Encyclopaedia_.  He now read about all the successful men, and was encouraged to find that in

the plain with his eagle eyes, in search of the object from which the cries emanated. But nothing of 

animal life was visible in any direction beyond the train, and more was the mystery, since the 

information-seeking boy.  General Garfield answered warmly and fully. Edward showed the letter 

to his father, who told the boy that it was valuable and he should keep it.  This was a new idea. 

He followed it further; if one such letter was valuable, how much more valuable would be a
