LONDON & NEW YORK FREDERICK WARNE AND CO. 1889   _ALL    To Pot a Hare, from the 

same.  Take a Hare and bone it, then mince the Flesh very small, with a Pound of the Fat of 

Bacon; after which, beat these in a Mortar, and then season your Meat with Pepper, Salt, Cloves 

and Mace, adding to it an Ounce of Salt peter: mix all these well, and let the Meat lie twenty-four 

Hours, then put it in an earthen glazed Pot, and bake it three Hours; after which, take it out, and 

dry it from the Gravey, then return it to the Pot again, and then cover it with clarified Butter. This 

Receipt might have been put in some of the former Months, as the Hare is then in season; but as it 

depends upon the foregoing Receipt, I thought convenient to insert it in this Place: however, a 

Jack-Hare may now be dress'd in this fashion, but the Doe-Hares are now either with Young or 

have Young ones, so that they are out of Season. These Potted Meats are useful in 

Housekeeping, being always ready for the Table: So likewise the following Receipt for Collar'd 

Beef is of the same service.    To Collar Beef.  Get the Rand or Flank of Beef cut about a foot in 

length; bone it, and then mix two Ounces of Salt peter, with a good handful of common Salt: after 

which, carbonade the outward Skin of the Beef, and rub the whole well with the Salts, letting it lie 

for twenty-four hours in Salt before you collar it; but observing to turn it twice a day, at least, whilst 

it is in Salt. When it has lain thus to season, get some Sweet-Marjoram, a little Winter-Savoury, 

some Red Sage-leaves, and a little Thyme, and shred them small; among which put an Ounce of 

Pepper ground small, half an Ounce of Cloves and Mace beat, and a Handful of Salt; mix

_PUBLISHERS' PREFACE._   The almost general desire to have THE OWL and THE PUSSY-

CAT, THE DUCK and THE KANGAROO, in a distinct form from Mr. LEAR's other Nonsense 

Drolleries, has induced us to issue them separately with Original Illustrations.  FREDK. WARNE & 

CO.   London Engraved & Printed at Racquet Court, _by_ _Edmund Evans_.     [Illustration] 

The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea         In a beautiful pea-green boat,      They took some 

honey, and plenty of money         Wrapped up in a five-pound note.  [Illustration]      The Owl 

looked up to the stars above,         And sang to a small guitar,      "O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my 

love,         What a beautiful Pussy you are,                 You are,                 You are!         What a 

beautiful Pussy you are!"  the mixture thick over the inside of your Meat, that when it is roll'd up, it 

may be equally bound in with the Turnings of the Beef: then provide some thin Slices of the same 

Beef to lay before the first Turn, that the Collar may not be hollow in the middle. This must be roll'd 

as hard as possible, so that every Part is equally press'd to each other; then get some Tape about 

an Inch wide, and bind it hard about your Collar of Beef, in a Screw-like manner, till you have 

closed your Collar from top to bottom as tight as can be; observing to bind the top and bottom in 

an extraordinary manner with strong Packthread. Put this in a glazed earthen Pan, with as much 

Claret as will cover it, putting over the whole some coarse Paste, and send it to the Oven to stand 

five or six Hours. When it is

Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!         How charmingly sweet you sing!      O let us be 

married! too long we have tarried:         But what shall we do for a ring?"  [Illustration]      They 

sailed away for a year and a day,         To the land where the Bong-tree grows,      And there in a 

wood a Piggy-wig stood,         With a ring at the end of his take out your Collar, and set it upright 

till it be cold, and then take off the Fillets, or the Tape that braced it together, and keep it for use. 

This is cut in thin Slices, and eaten with Vinegar, as are most of the Collar'd meats and Potted 

meats. This Example is enough for any one either to Collar other Meats by, only observing that 

such Flesh as is tender, as Pig
