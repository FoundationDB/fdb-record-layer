where there are piers or antae; for where the lintels and beams have received the load of the 

walls, they may sag in the middle, and gradually undermine and destroy the walls. But when there 

are posts set up underneath and wedged in there, they prevent the beams from settling and 

injuring such walls.  3. We must also manage to discharge the load of the walls by means of 

archings composed of voussoirs with joints radiating to the centre. For when arches with voussoirs 

are sprung from the ends of beams, or from the bearings of lintels, in the first place they will 

discharge the load and the wood will not sag; secondly, if in course of time the wood becomes at 

all defective, it can easily be replaced without the construction of shoring.  4. Likewise in houses 

where piers are used in the construction, when there are arches composed of voussoirs with joints 

radiating to the centre, the outermost piers at these points must be made broader than the others, 

so that they may have the strength to resist when the wedges, under the pressure of the load of 

the walls, begin to press along their joints towards the centre, and thus to thrust out the 

abutments. Hence, if the piers at the ends are of large dimensions, they the public. The best of 

them had had to play in their day in tragedy, in operetta, in Parisian farces, and in extravaganzas, 

and they always seemed equally sure that they were on the right path and that they were of use. 

So, as you see, the cause of the evil must be sought, not in the actors, but, more deeply, in the art 

itself and in the attitude of the whole of society to it."  This letter of mine only irritated Katya. She 

answered me:  "You and I are singing parts out of different operas. I wrote to you, not of the 

worthy men who showed a friendly disposition to you, but of a band of knaves who have nothing 

worthy about them. They are a horde of savages who have got on the stage simply because no 

one would have taken them elsewhere, and who call themselves artists simply because they are 

impudent. There are numbers of dull-witted creatures, drunkards, intriguing schemers and 

slanderers, but there is not one person of talent among them. I cannot tell you how bitter it is to me 

that the art I love has fallen into the hands of people I detest; how bitter it is that the best men look 

on at evil from afar, not caring to come closer, and, instead of intervening, write ponderous 

commonplaces and utterly 


_
will hold the voussoirs together, and make such works durable.  5. Having taken heed in these 

matters to see that proper attention is paid to them, we must also be equally careful that all walls 

are perfectly vertical, and that they do not lean forward anywhere. Particular pains, too, must be 

taken with substructures, for here an endless amount of harm is usually done by the earth used as 

filling. This cannot always remain of the same weight that it usually has in summer, but in winter 

time it increases in weight and bulk by taking up a great deal of rain water, and then it bursts its 

enclosing walls and thrusts them out.  6. The following means must be taken to provide against 

such a defect. First, let the walls be given a thickness proportionate to the amount of filling; 

secondly, build counterforts or buttresses at the same time as the wall, on the outer side, at 

distances from each other equivalent to what is to be the height of the substructure and with the 

thickness of the substructure. At the bottom let them run out to a distance corresponding to the 

thickness that has been determined for the substructure, and then gradually diminish in extent so 

that at the surface their projection is equal to the thickness of the wall of the building.  [Illustration: 

RETAINING WALLS  (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice 1511)]  7. 

Furthermore, inside, to meet the mass of earth, there should be saw-shaped constructions 

attached to the wall, the single teeth extending from the wall for a distance equivalent to what is to 

be the height of the substructure, and the teeth being constructed with the same thickness as the 

wall. Then at the outermost angles take a distance inwards, from the inside of the angle, equal to 

the height of the substructure, and mark it off on each side; from these marks build up a diagonal 

structure and from the middle of it a second, joined on to the angle of the wall. With this 

arrangement, the teeth and diagonal structures will not allow the filling to thrust with all its force 

against the wall, but will check and distribute the pressure.  8. I have now shown how buildings 

can be constructed without defects, and the way to take precautions against the occurrence of 

them. As for replacing tiles, roof timbers, and rafters, we need not be so particular about them as 

about the parts just mentioned, because they can easily be replaced, however defective they may 

become. Hence, I have shown by what methods the parts which are not considered solid can be 

rendered durable, and how they are constructed.  9. As for the kind of material to be used, this 

does not depend upon the architect, for the reason that all kinds of materials are not found in all 

places alike, as has been shown in the first book. Besides, it depends on the owner whether he 

desires to build in brick, or rubble work, or dimension stone. Consequently the question of 

approving any work may be considered under three heads: that is, delicacy of workmanship, 

sumptuousness, and design. When it appears that a work has been carried out sumptuously, the 

owner will be the person to be praised for the great outlay which he has authorized; when 

delicately, the master workman will be approved for his execution; but when proportions and 

symmetry lend it an imposing effect, then the glory of it will belong to the architect.  10. Such 

results, however, may very well be brought about when he allows himself to take the advice both 

of workmen and of laymen. In fact, all kinds of men, and not merely architects, can recognize a 

good piece of work, but between laymen and the latter there is this difference, that the layman 

cannot tell what it is to be like without seeing it finished, whereas the architect, as soon as he has 

formed the conception, and before he begins the work, has a definite idea of the beauty, the 

convenience, and the propriety that will distinguish it.  I have now described as clearly as I could 

what I thought necessary for private houses, and how to build them. In the following book I shall 



treat of the kinds of polished finish employed to make them elegant, and durable without defects to 

a great age.     BOOK VII     INTRODUCTION   1. It was a wise and useful provision of the 

ancients to transmit their thoughts to posterity by recording them in treatises, so that they should 

not be lost, but, being developed in succeeding generations through publication in books, should 

gradually attain in later times, to the highest refinement of learning. And so the ancients deserve 

no ordinary, but unending thanks, because they did not pass on in envious silence, but took care 

that their ideas of every kind should be transmitted to the future in their writings.  2. If they had not 

done so, we could not have known what deeds were done in Troy, nor what Thales, Democritus, 

Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, and the other physicists thought about nature, and what rules 

Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, and other philosophers laid down for the conduct of 

human life; nor would the deeds and motives of Croesus, Alexander, Darius, and other kings have 

been known, unless the ancients had compiled treatises, and published them in commentaries to 

be had in universal remembrance with posterity.  3. So, while they deserve our thanks, those, on 

the contrary, deserve our reproaches, who steal the writings of such men and publish them as 

their own; and those also, who depend in their writings, not on their own ideas, but who enviously 

do wrong to the works of others and boast of  A little time passed, and I got this letter: "I have 

been brutally deceived. I cannot go on living. Dispose of my money as you think best. I loved you 

as my father and my only friend. Good-bye."  It turned out that _he_, too, belonged to the "horde of 

savages." Later on, from certain hints, I gathered that there had been an attempt at suicide. I 

believe Katya tried to poison herself. I imagine that she must have been seriously ill afterwards, as 

the next letter I got was from Yalta, where she had most probably been sent by the doctors. Her 

last letter contained a request to send her a thousand roubles to Yalta as quickly as possible, and 

ended with these words:  "Excuse the gloominess of this letter; yesterday I buried my child." After 

spending about a year in the Crimea, she returned home.  She had been about four years on her 

travels, and during those four years, I must confess, I had played a rather strange and unenviable 

part in regard to her. When in earlier days she had told me she was going on the stage, and then 

wrote to me of her love; when she was periodically overcome by extravagance, and I continually 

had to send her first one and then two thousand roubles; when she wrote to me of her intention of 

suicide, and then of the death of her baby, every time I lost my head, and all my sympathy for her 

sufferings found no expression except that, after prolonged reflection, I wrote long, boring letters 

which I might just as well not have written. And yet I took a father's place with her and loved her 

like a daughter!  Now Katya is living less than half a mile off. She has taken a flat of five rooms, 

and has installed herself fairly comfortably and in the taste of the day. If any one were to 

undertake to describe her surroundings, the most characteristic note in the picture would be 

indolence. For the indolent body there are soft lounges, soft stools; for indolent feet soft rugs; for 

indolent eyes faded, dingy, or flat colours; for the indolent soul the walls are hung with a number of 

cheap fans and trivial pictures, in which the originality of the execution is more conspicuous than 

the subject; and the room contains a multitude of little tables and shelves filled with utterly useless 

articles of no value, and shapeless rags in place of curtains.... All this, together with the dread of 

bright colours, of symmetry, and of empty space, bears witness not only to spiritual indolence, but 

also to a corruption of natural taste. For days together Katya lies on the lounge reading, principally 

novels and stories. She only goes out of the house once a day, in the afternoon, to see me.  I go 



on working while Katya sits silent not far from me on the sofa, wrapping herself in her shawl, as 

though she were cold. Either because I find her sympathetic or because I was used to her frequent 

visits when she was a little girl, her presence does not prevent me from concentrating my 

attention. From time to time I mechanically ask her some question; she gives very brief replies; or, 

to rest for a minute, I turn round and watch her as she looks dreamily at some medical journal or 

review. And at such moments I notice that her face has lost the old look of confiding trustfulness. 

Her expression now is cold, apathetic, and absent-minded, like that of passengers who had to wait 

too long for a train. She is dressed, as in old days, simply and beautifully, but carelessly; her dress 

and her hair show visible traces of the sofas and rocking-chairs in which she spends whole days at 

a stretch. And she has lost the curiosity she had in old days. She has ceased to ask me questions 

now, as though she had experienced everything in life and looked for nothing new from it. 

Towards four o'clock there begins to be sounds of movement in the hall and in the drawing-room. 

Liza has come back from the Conservatoire, and has brought some girl-friends in with her. We 

hear them playing on the piano, trying their voices and laughing; in the dining-room Yegor is laying 

the table, with the clatter of crockery.  "Good-bye," said Katya. "I won't go in and see your people 

today. They must excuse me. I haven't time. Come and see me."  While I am seeing her to the 

door, she looks me up and down grimly, and says with vexation:  "You are getting thinner and 

thinner! Why don't you consult a doctor? I'll call at Sergey Fyodorovitch's and ask him to have a 

look at you."  "There's no need, Katya."  "I can't think where your people's eyes are! They are a 

nice lot, I must say!"  She puts on her fur coat abruptly, and as she does so two or three hairpins 

drop unnoticed on the floor from her carelessly arranged hair. She is too lazy and in too great a 

hurry to do her hair up; she carelessly stuffs the falling curls under her hat, and goes away.  When 

I go into the dining-room my wife asks me:  "Was Katya with you just now? Why didn't she come in 

to see us? It's really strange...."  "Mamma," Liza says to her reproachfully, "let her alone, if she 

doesn't want to. We are not going down on our knees to her."  "It's very neglectful, anyway. To sit 

for three hours in the study without remembering our existence! But of course she must do as she 

likes."  Varya and Liza both hate Katya. This hatred is beyond my comprehension, and probably 

one would have to be a woman in order to understand it. I am ready to stake my life that of the 

hundred and fifty young men I see every day in the lecture-theatre, and of the hundred elderly 

ones I meet every week, hardly one could be found capable of understanding their hatred 


_
punishment for their wicked course of life. With the ancients, however, it is said that such things 

did not pass without pretty strict chastisement. What the results of their judgments were, it may not 

be out of place to set forth as they are transmitted to us.  4. The kings of the house of Attalus 

having established, under the influence of the great charms of literature, an excellent library at 

Pergamus to give pleasure to the public, Ptolemy also was aroused with no end of enthusiasm 

and emulation into exertions to make a similar provision with no less diligence at Alexandria. 

Having done so with the greatest care, he felt that this was not enough without providing for its 

increase and development, for which he sowed the seed. He established public contests in honour 

of the Muses and Apollo, and appointed prizes and honours for victorious authors in general, as is 

done in the case of athletes.  5. These arrangements having been made, and the contests being 

at hand, it became necessary to select literary men as judges to decide them. The king soon 

selected six of the citizens, but could not so easily find a proper person to be the seventh. He 

therefore turned to those who presided over the library, and asked whether they knew anybody 

who was suitable for the purpose. Then they told him that there was one Aristophanes who was 

daily engaged in reading through all the books with the greatest enthusiasm and the greatest care. 

Hence, when the gathering for the contests took place, and separate seats were set apart for the 

judges, Aristophanes was summoned with the rest, and sat down in the place assigned to him.  6. 

A group of poets was first brought in to contend, and, as they recited their compositions, the whole 

audience by its applause showed the judges what it approved. So, when they were individually 

asked for their votes, the six agreed, and awarded the first prize to the poet who, as they 

observed, had most pleased the multitude, and the second to the one who came next. But 

Aristophanes, on being asked for his vote, urged that the poet who had least pleased the audience 

should be declared to be the first.  7. As the king and the entire assembly showed great 

indignation, he arose, and asked and received permission to speak. Silence being obtained, he 

stated that only one of them--his man--was a poet, and that the rest had recited things not their 

own; furthermore, that judges ought to give their approval, not to thefts, but to original 

compositions. The people were amazed, and the king hesitated, but Aristophanes, trusting to his 

memory, had a vast number of volumes brought out from bookcases which he specified, and, by 

comparing them with what had been recited, obliged the thieves themselves to make confession. 

So, the king gave orders that they should be accused of theft, and after condemnation sent them 

off in disgrace; but he honoured Aristophanes with the most generous gifts, and put him in charge 

of the library.  8. Some years later, Zoilus, who took the surname of Homeromastix, came from 

Macedonia to Alexandria and read to the king his writings directed against the Iliad and Odyssey. 

Ptolemy, seeing the father of poets and captain of all literature abused in his absence, and his 

works, to which all the world looked up in admiration, disparaged by this person, made no 

rejoinder, although he thought it an outrage. Zoilus, however, after remaining in the kingdom some 

time, sank into poverty, and sent a message to the king, requesting that something might be 

bestowed upon him.  9. But it is said that the king replied, that Homer, though dead a thousand 

years ago, had all that time been the means of livelihood for many thousands of mother without 

being a wife, and for her having had an illegitimate child; and at the same time I cannot recall one 

woman or girl of my acquaintance who would not consciously or unconsciously harbour such 

feelings. And this is not because woman is purer or more virtuous than man: why, virtue and purity 



are not very different from vice if they are not free from evil feeling. I attribute this simply to the 

backwardness of woman. The mournful feeling of compassion and the pang of conscience 

experienced by a modern man at the sight of suffering is, to my mind, far greater proof of culture 

and moral elevation than hatred and aversion. Woman is as tearful and as coarse in her feelings 

now as she was in the Middle Ages, and to my thinking those who advise that she should be 

educated like a man are quite right.  My wife also dislikes Katya for having been an actress, for 

ingratitude, for pride, for eccentricity, and for the numerous vices which one woman can always 

find in another.  Besides my wife and daughter and me, there are dining with us two or three of my 

daughter's friends and Alexandr Adolfovitch Gnekker, her admirer and suitor. He is a fair-haired 

young man under thirty, of medium height, very stout and broad-shouldered, with red whiskers 

near his ears, and little waxed moustaches which make his plump smooth face look like a toy. He 

is dressed in a very short reefer jacket, a flowered waistcoat, breeches very full at the top and very 

narrow at the ankle, with a large check pattern on them, and yellow boots without heels. He has 

prominent eyes like a crab's, his cravat is like a crab's neck, and I even fancy there is a smell of 

crab-soup about the young man's whole person. He visits us every day, but no one in my family 

knows anything of his origin nor of the place of his education, nor of his means of livelihood. He 

neither plays nor sings, but has some connection with music and singing, sells somebody's pianos 

somewhere, is frequently at the Conservatoire, is acquainted with all the celebrities, and is a 

steward at the concerts; he criticizes music with great authority, and I have noticed that people are 

eager to agree with him.  Rich people always have dependents hanging about them; the arts and 

sciences have the same. I believe there is not an art nor a science in the world free from "foreign 

bodies" after the style of this Mr. Gnekker. I am not a musician, and possibly I am mistaken in 

regard to Mr. Gnekker, of whom, indeed, I know very little. But his air of authority and the dignity 

with which he takes his stand beside the piano when any one is playing or singing strike me as 

very suspicious.  You may be ever so much of a gentleman and a privy councillor, but if you have 

a daughter you cannot be secure of immunity from that petty bourgeois atmosphere which is so 

often brought into your house and into your mood by the attentions of suitors, by matchmaking and 

marriage. I can never reconcile myself, for instance, to the expression of triumph on my wife's face 

every time Gnekker is in our company, nor can I reconcile myself to the bottles of Lafitte, port and 

sherry which are only brought out on his account, that he may see with his own eyes the liberal 

and luxurious way in which we live. I cannot tolerate the habit of spasmodic laughter Liza has 

picked up at the Conservatoire, and her way of screwing up her eyes whenever there are men in 

the room. Above all, I cannot understand why a creature utterly alien to my habits, my studies, my 

whole manner of life, completely different from the people I like, should come and see me every 

day, and every day should dine with me. My wife and my servants mysteriously whisper that he is 

a 


_
genius ought to be able to support not one man only, but many others. And in short, various 

stories are told about his death, which was like that of one found guilty of parricide. Some writers 

have said that he was crucified by Philadelphus; others that he was stoned at Chios; others again 

that he was thrown alive upon a funeral pyre at Smyrna. Whichever of these forms of death befell 

him, it was a fitting punishment and his just due; for one who accuses men that cannot answer and 

show, face to face, what was the meaning of their writings, obviously deserves no other treatment. 

10. But for my part, Caesar, I am not bringing forward the present treatise after changing the titles 

of other men's books and inserting my own name, nor has it been my plan to win approbation by 

finding fault with the ideas of another. On the contrary, I express unlimited thanks to all the authors 

that have in the past, by compiling from antiquity remarkable instances of the skill shown by 

genius, provided us with abundant materials of different kinds. Drawing from them as it were water 

from springs, and converting them to our own purposes, we find our powers of writing rendered 

more fluent and easy, and, relying upon such authorities, we venture to produce new systems of 

instruction.  11. Hence, as I saw that such beginnings on their part formed an introduction suited to 

the nature of my own purpose, I set out to draw from them, and to go somewhat further.  In the 

first place Agatharcus, in Athens, when Aeschylus was bringing out a tragedy, painted a scene, 

and left a commentary about it. This led Democritus and Anaxagoras to write on the same subject, 

showing how, given a centre in a definite place, the lines should naturally correspond with due 

regard to the point of sight and the divergence of the visual rays, so that by this deception a faithful 

representation of the appearance of buildings might be given in painted scenery, and so that, 

though all is drawn on a vertical flat facade, some parts may seem to be withdrawing into the 

background, and others to be standing out in front.  12. Afterwards Silenus published a book on 

the proportions of Doric structures; Theodorus, on the Doric temple of Juno which is in Samos; 

Chersiphron and Metagenes, on the Ionic temple at Ephesus which is Diana's; Pytheos, on the 

Ionic fane of Minerva which is at Priene; Ictinus and Carpion, on the Doric temple of Minerva which 

is on the acropolis of Athens; Theodorus the Phocian, on the Round Building which is at Delphi; 

Philo, on the proportions of temples, and on the naval arsenal which was[9] at the port of 

Peiraeus; Hermogenes, on the Ionic temple of Diana which is at Magnesia, a pseudodipteral, and 

on that of Father Bacchus at Teos, a monopteral; Arcesius, on the Corinthian proportions, and on 

the Ionic temple of Aesculapius at Tralles, which it is said that he built with his own hands; on the 

Mausoleum, Satyrus and Pytheos who were favoured with the greatest and highest good fortune. 

[Note 9: Codd. _fuerat_.]  13. For men whose artistic talents are believed to have won them the 

highest renown for all time, and laurels forever green, devised and executed works of supreme 

excellence in this building. The decoration and perfection of the different facades were undertaken 

by different artists in emulation with each other: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas, Praxiteles, and, as 

some think, Timotheus; and the distinguished excellence of their art made that building famous 

among the seven wonders of the world.  14. Then, too, many less celebrated men have written 

treatises on the laws of symmetry, such as Nexaris, Theocydes, Demophilus, Pollis, but still I don't 

understand his presence; it rouses in me the same wonder and perplexity as if they were to set a 

Zulu beside me at the table. And it seems strange to me, too, that my daughter, whom I am used 

to thinking of as a child, should love that cravat, those eyes, those soft cheeks....  In the old days I 

used to like my dinner, or at least was indifferent about it; now it excites in me no feeling but 



weariness and irritation. Ever since I became an "Excellency" and one of the Deans of the Faculty 

my family has for some reason found it necessary to make a complete change in our menu and 

dining habits. Instead of the simple dishes to which I was accustomed when I was a student and 

when I was in practice, now they feed me with a puree with little white things like circles floating 

about in it, and kidneys stewed in madeira. My rank as a general and my fame have robbed me for 

ever of cabbage-soup and savoury pies, and goose with apple-sauce, and bream with boiled 

grain. They have robbed me of our maid-servant Agasha, a chatty and laughter-loving old woman, 

instead of whom Yegor, a dull-witted and conceited fellow with a white glove on his right hand, 

waits at dinner. The intervals between the courses are short, but they seem immensely long 

because there is nothing to occupy them. There is none of the gaiety of the old days, the 

spontaneous talk, the jokes, the laughter; there is nothing of mutual affection and the joy which 

used to animate the children, my wife, and me when in old days we met together at meals. For 

me, the celebrated man of science, dinner was a time of rest and reunion, and for my wife and 

children a fete--brief indeed, but bright and joyous--in which they knew that for half an hour I 

belonged, not to science, not to students, but to them alone. Our real exhilaration from one glass 

of wine is gone for ever, gone is Agasha, gone the bream with boiled grain, gone the uproar that 

greeted every little startling incident at dinner, such as the cat and dog fighting under the table, or 

Katya's bandage falling off her face into her soup-plate.  To describe our dinner nowadays is as 

uninteresting as to eat it. My wife's face wears a look of triumph and affected dignity, and her 

habitual expression of anxiety. She looks at our plates and says, "I see you don't care for the joint. 

Tell me; you don't like it, do you?" and I am obliged to answer: "There is no need for you to 

trouble, my dear; the meat is very nice." And she will say: "You always stand up for me, Nikolay 

Stepanovitch, and you never tell the truth. Why is Alexandr Adolfovitch eating so little?" And so on 

in the same style all through dinner. Liza laughs spasmodically and screws up her eyes. I watch 

them both, and it is only now at dinner that it becomes absolutely evident to me that the inner life 

of these two has slipped away out of my ken. I have a feeling as though I had once lived at home 

with a real wife and children and that now I am dining with visitors, in the house of a sham wife 

who is not the real one, and am looking at a Liza who is not the real Liza. A startling change has 

taken place in both of them; I have missed the long process by which that change was effected, 

and it is no wonder that I can make nothing of it. Why did that change take place? I don't know. 

Perhaps the whole trouble is that God has not given my wife and daughter the same strength of 

character as me. From childhood I have been accustomed to resisting external influences, and 

have steeled myself pretty thoroughly. Such catastrophes in life as fame, the rank of a general, the 

transition from comfort to living beyond our means, acquaintance with 


_
machinery, such as Diades, Archytas, Archimedes, Ctesibius, Nymphodorus, Philo of Byzantium, 

Diphilus, Democles, Charias, Polyidus, Pyrrus, and Agesistratus. From their commentaries I have 

gathered what I saw was useful for the present subject, and formed it into one complete treatise, 

and this principally, because I saw that many books in this field had been published by the Greeks, 

but very few indeed by our countrymen. Fuficius, in fact, was the first to undertake to publish a 

book on this subject. Terentius Varro, also, in his work "On the Nine Sciences" has one book on 

architecture, and Publius Septimius, two.  15. But to this day nobody else seems to have bent his 

energies to this branch of literature, although there have been, even among our fellow-citizens in 

old times, great architects who could also have written with elegance. For instance, in Athens, the 

architects Antistates, Callaeschrus, Antimachides, and Pormus laid the foundations when 

Peisistratus began the temple of Olympian Jove, but after his death they abandoned the 

undertaking, on account of political troubles. Hence it was that when, about four hundred years 

later, King Antiochus promised to pay the expenses of that work, the huge cella, the surrounding 

columns in dipteral arrangement, and the architraves and other ornaments, adjusted according to 

the laws of symmetry, were nobly constructed with great skill and supreme knowledge by 

Cossutius, a citizen of Rome. Moreover, have remained intact and unashamed; but on my wife 

and Liza, who have not been through the same hardening process and are weak, all this has fallen 

like an avalanche of snow, overwhelming them. Gnekker and the young ladies talk of fugues, of 

counterpoint, of singers and pianists, of Bach and Brahms, while my wife, afraid of their suspecting 

her of ignorance of music, smiles to them sympathetically and mutters: "That's exquisite... really! 

You don't say so!..." Gnekker eats with solid dignity, jests with solid dignity, and condescendingly 

listens to the remarks of the young ladies. From time to time he is moved to speak in bad French, 

and then, for some reason or other, he thinks it necessary to address me as _"Votre Excellence."_ 

And I am glum. Evidently I am a constraint to them and they are a constraint to me. I have never in 

my earlier days had a close knowledge of class antagonism, but now I am tormented by 

something of that sort. I am on the lookout for nothing but bad qualities in Gnekker; I quickly find 

them, and am fretted at the thought that a man not of my circle is sitting here as my daughter's 

suitor. His presence has a bad influence on me in other ways, too. As a rule, when I am alone or in 

the society of people I like, never think of my own achievements, or, if I do recall them, they seem 

to me as trivial as though I had only completed my studies yesterday; but in the presence of 

people like Gnekker my achievements in science seem

only in general, but also among the select few.  16. There are, in fact, four places possessing 

temples embellished with workmanship in marble that causes them to be mentioned in a class by 

themselves with the highest renown. To their great excellence and the wisdom of their conception 

they owe their place of esteem in the ceremonial worship of the gods. First there is the temple of 

Diana at Ephesus, in the Ionic style, undertaken by Chersiphron of Gnosus and his son 

Metagenes, and said to have been finished later by Demetrius, who was himself a slave of Diana, 

and by Paeonius the Milesian. At Miletus, the temple of Apollo, also Ionic in its proportions, was 

the undertaking of the same Paeonius and of the Ephesian Daphnis. At Eleusis, the cella of Ceres 

and Proserpine, of vast size, was completed to the roof by Ictinus in the vanishes into the clouds, 

while at its foot Gnekkers are running about scarcely visible to the naked eye.  After dinner I go 

into my study and there smoke my pipe, the only one in the whole day, the sole relic of my old bad 

habit of smoking from morning till night. While I am smoking my wife comes in and sits down to 

talk to me. Just as in the morning, I know beforehand what our conversation is going to be about. 

"I must talk to you seriously, Nikolay Stepanovitch," she begins. "I mean about Liza.... Why don't 

you pay attention to it?"  "To what?"  "You pretend to notice nothing. But that is not right. We can't 

shirk responsibility.... Gnekker has intentions in regard to Liza.... What do you say?"  "That he is a 

bad man I can't say, because I don't know him, but that I don't like him I have told you a thousand 

times already."
