admiration of his much-prized hygeen, and to prove its speed and easy actio=
n we were no sooner=20

mounted than he led the way at about ten miles an hour, down the steep slop=
es, across the rough=20

watercourses, and up the hill-sides, assuring my wife that she might sip a =
cup of coffee on the=20

back of the animal she rode, without spilling a drop: although an exaggerat=
ion, this is the usual=20

figure of speech by which an Arab describes the easy action of a first-rate=
 hygeen. It was a=20

beautiful sight to watch the extraordinary ease with which the hygeen glide=
d along over the=20

numerous inequalities of the ground without the slightest discomfort to the=
 rider; the numerous=20

escort became a long and irregular line of stragglers, until at length they=
 were lost in the distance,=20

with the exception of three or four, who, well mounted, were proud of keepi=
ng their position.=20

Emerging from the uneven valley of the Atbara, we arrived upon the high and=
 level table land=20

above; here the speed increased, and in the exhilaration of the pace in the=
 cool morning air, with=20

all nature glowing in the fresh green of a Nubian spring, we only regretted=
 the shortness of the=20

journey to Sofi, which we reached before the heat of the day had commenced.=
 We were met by=20

the sheik of the village, and by a German who had been a resident of Sofi f=
or some years; he was=20

delighted to see Europeans, especially those who were conversant with his o=
wn language, and he=20

very politely insisted that we should dismount at his house. Accordingly ou=
r camels knelt at the=20

door of a little circular stone building about twelve feet in rejected. And=
 yet, had they been=20

accomplished, would they have been happy? The character of Corisande, accor=
ding to her=20

mother, was not then formed, nor easily scrutable. Was it formed now? and w=
hat were its bent and=20

genius? And his own character? It could not be denied that his mind was som=
ewhat crude then,=20

and his general conclusions on life and duty hardly sufficiently matured an=
d developed to offer a=20

basis for domestic happiness on which one might confidently depend.  And Th=
eodora? Had he=20

married then, he should never have known Theodora. In this bright saloon, a=
mid the gayety of=20

festive music, and surrounded by gliding forms of elegance and brilliancy, =
his heart was full of=20

anguish when he thought of Theodora. To have known such a woman and to have=
 lost her! Why=20

should a man live after this? Yes; he would retire to Muriel, once hallowed=
 by her presence, and=20

he would raise to her memory some monumental fane, beyond the dreams ever o=
f Artemisia, and=20

which should commemorate alike her wondrous life and wondrous mind.  A beau=
tiful hand was=20

extended to him, and a fair face, animated with intelligence, welcomed him =
without a word. It was=20

Lady St. Jerome. Lothair bowed lowly and touched her hand with his lip.  =
=E2=80=9CI was sorry to have=20

missed you yesterday. We had gone down to Vauxe for the day, but I heard of=
 you from my lord=20

with great pleasure. We are all of us so happy that you have entirely recov=
ered your health.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

owe that to you, dearest lady,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand to those=
 under your roof. I can never forget your=20

goodness to me. Had it not been for you, I should not=20


_
Arab fashion. This dwelling was the model of an Arab hut, but the walls wer=
e of masonry instead=20

of mud and sticks, and two small windows formed an innovation upon the Arab=
 style, which had=20

much astonished the natives, who are contented with the light afforded by t=
he doorway.  We were=20

shortly sitting in the only stone building in the country, among a crowd of=
 Arabs, who, according to=20

their annoying custom, had thronged to the hut upon our arrival, and not on=
ly had filled the room,=20

but were sitting in a mob at the doorway, while masses of mop-like heads we=
re peering over the=20

shoulders of the front rank, excluding both light and air; even the windows=
 were blocked with=20

highly frizzled heads, while all were talking at the same time.  Coffee hav=
ing been handed to the=20

principal people while our tents were being pitched outside the village, we=
 at length silenced the=20

crowd; our new acquaintance explained in Arabic the object of our arrival, =
and our intention of=20

passing the rainy season at Sofi, and of exploring the various rivers of Ab=
yssinia at the earliest=20

opportunity. Atalan Wat Said promised every assistance when the time should=
 arrive; he described=20

the country as abounding with large game of all kinds, and he agreed to fur=
nish me with guides=20

and hunters at the commencement of the hunting season; in the meantime he o=
rdered the sheik of=20

the village, Hassan bel Kader, to pay us every attention.  After the depart=
ure of Atalan and his=20

people, and the usual yelling of the women, we had time to examine Sofi, an=
d accompanied by the=20

German, Florian, we strolled through the village. At this position the slop=
e of the valley towards the=20

river was exceedingly gradual upon the west bank, until within a hundred an=
d fifty yards of the=20

Atbara, when the ground rapidly fell, and terminated in an abrupt cliff of =
white sandstone.  The=20

miserable little village of modern Sofi comprised about thirty straw huts, =
but the situation was=20

worthy of a more important settlement. A plateau of hard sandy soil of abou=
t twenty acres was=20

bordered upon either side by two deep ravines that formed a natural protect=
ion, while below the=20

steep cliff, within two hundred paces in front of the village, flowed the r=
iver Atbara; for mounted=20

men there was only one approach, that which we had taken  =E2=80=9CNo, no; =
we did our best for the=20

moment. But I quite agree with my lord, now, that you stayed too long at Ro=
me under the=20

circumstances. It was a good move=E2=80=94that going to Sicily, and so wise=
 of you to travel in Egypt.=20

Men should travel.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have not been to Egypt,=E2=80=9D sa=
id Lothair; =E2=80=9CI have been to the Holy Land, and=20

am a pilgrim. I wish you would tell Miss Arundel that I shall ask her permi=
ssion to present her with=20

my crucifix, which contains the earth of the holy places. I should have tol=
d her this myself, if I had=20

seen her yesterday. Is she here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShe is at Vauxe; she co=
uld not tear herself away from the=20

roses.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut she might have brought them with her as compa=
nions,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cas you have, I=20

apprehend, yourself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI will give you this in Clare=E2=80=
=99s name,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome, as she selected=20

a beautiful flower and presented it to Lothair. =E2=80=9CIt is in return fo=
r your crucifix, which I am sure she=20

will highly esteem. I only wish it were a rose of Jericho.=E2=80=9D  Lothai=
r started. The name brought up=20

strange and disturbing associations: the procession in the Jesuits=E2=80=99=
 church, the lighted tapers, the=20

consecrated children, one of whom had been supernaturally presented with th=
e flower in question.=20

There was an awkward silence, until Lothair, almost without intending it, e=
xpressed a hope that the=20

cardinal was well.  =E2=80=9CImmersed in affairs, but I hope well,=E2=80=9D=
 replied Lady St. Jerome. =E2=80=9CYou know what=20

has happened? But you will see him. He will speak to you of these matters h=
imself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut I should=20

like also to hear from you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, they are scarcely yet =
to be spoken of,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome. =E2=80=9CI=20

ought not perhaps even to have alluded to the subject; but I know how deepl=
y devoted you are to=20

religion. We are on the eve of the greatest event of this century. When I w=
ake in the morning, I=20



always fancy that I have heard of it only in dreams. And many=E2=80=94all t=
his room=E2=80=94will not believe in=20

the possibility of its happening. They smile when the contingency is allude=
d to, and if I were not=20

present they would mock. But it will happen=E2=80=94I am assured it will ha=
ppen,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Lady St.=20

Jerome, speaking with earnestness, though in a hushed voice. =E2=80=9CAnd n=
o human imagination can=20

calculate or conceive what may be its effect on the destiny of the human ra=
ce.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou excite my=20

_
a more inviting spot adopted for a resting-place during the rains. Although=
 the soil was thoroughly=20

denuded of loam, and nothing remained but the original substratum of sandst=
one and pebbles, the=20

grass was at this season about three inches high throughout the entire vall=
ey of the Atbara, the=20

trees were in full leaf, and the vivid green, contrasting with the snow-whi=
te sandstone rocks,=20

produced the effect of an ornamental park. My tents were pitched upon a lev=
el piece of ground,=20

outside the village, about a hundred paces from the river, where the grass =
had been so closely=20

nibbled by the goats that it formed a natural lawn, and was perfection for =
a camp; drains were dug=20

around the tent walls, and everything was arranged for a  =E2=80=9CHush! th=
ere are listeners. But we shall=20

soon meet again. You will come and see us, and soon. Come down to Vauxe on =
Saturday; the=20

cardinal will be there. And the place is so lovely now. I always say Vauxe =
at Whitsuntide, or a little=20

later, is a scene for Shakespeare. You know you always liked Vauxe.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CMore than liked it,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair; =E2=80=9CI have passed at Vauxe some of the happiest hours of my l=
ife.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 83 On the=20

morning of the very Saturday on which Lothair was to pay his visit to Vauxe=
, riding in the park, he=20

was joined by that polished and venerable nobleman who presides over the de=
stinies of art in=20

Great Britain. This distinguished person had taken rather a fancy to Lothai=
r, and liked to talk to him=20

about the=20
