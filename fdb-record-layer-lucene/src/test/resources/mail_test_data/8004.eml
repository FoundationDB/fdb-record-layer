philodendron monstera with the atmosphere already surcharged with the fumes=
 of alcohol, of tobacco and of perspiring humanity. There was many a black-=
eye already, many a contusion: more than one knife--surreptitiously drawn--=
was already stained with red.   IV  There was also a stampede for the door.=
 One man gave the signal. Seeing that his mates were wasting precious time =
by venting their wrath obtained leave to push the chair of old McKay.  The =
younger man was wheeled under the shade of a tree with his back to the hous=
e, and left there.  Then the family retired out of the way, leaving Archie =
to attend the invalid.  A few minutes after young Duncan had been placed, L=
ittle Bill pushed his charge under the same tree, and, wheeling the chair q=
uickly round, brought philodendron monstera with the atmosphere already sur=
charged with the fumes of alcohol, of tobacco and of perspiring humanity. T=
here was many a black-eye already, many a contusion: more than one knife--s=
urreptitiously drawn--was already stained with red.   IV  There was also a =
stampede for the door. One man gave the signal. Seeing that his mates were =
wasting precious time by venting their wrath obtained leave to push the cha=
ir of old McKay.  The younger man was wheeled under the shade of a tree wit=
h his back to the house, and left there.  Then the family retired out of th=
e way, leaving Archie to attend the invalid.  A few minutes after young Dun=
can had been placed, Little Bill pushed his charge under the same tree, and=
, wheeling the chair quickly round, brought _
monkey he had pushed his way through to the bar, and placing his two hands =
upon it, with a swift=20

leap he had taken up a sitting position in the very middle of the table amo=
ngst the jugs and bottles,=20

which he promptly seized and used as missiles and weapons, whilst with his =
dangling feet=20

encased in heavy sabots he kicked out vigorously and unceasingly against th=
e shins of his=20

foremost assailants.  He had the advantage of position and used it cleverly=
. In his right hand he=20

held a pewter mug by the handle and used it as a swivel against his aggress=
ors with great effect.=20

"The Loire for you--you blackmailer! liar! traitor!" shouted some of the wo=
men who, bolder than the=20

men, thrust shaking fists at Paul Friche as closely as that pewter mug woul=
d allow.  "Break his jaw=20

before he can yell for the police," admonished one of the men from the rear=
, "before he can save=20

his own skin."  But those who shouted loudest had only their fists by way o=
f weapon and Paul=20

Friche had mugs and bottles, and those sabots of his kicked out with uncomf=
ortable agility.  "Break=20

my jaw, will you," he shouted every time that a blow from the mug went home=
, "a spy am I? Very=20

well then, here's for you, Jacques Leroux; go and nurse your cracked skull =
at home. You want a=20

row," he added hitting at a youth who brandished a heavy fist in his face, =
"well! you shall have it=20

and as much of it as you like! as much of it as will bring the patrols of p=
olice comfortably about=20

your ears."  Bang! went the pewter mug crashing against a man's hard skull!=
 Bang went Paul=20

Friche's naked fist against the chest of another. He was a hard hitter and =
swift.  The Lemoines=20

from behind their bar shouted louder than the rest, doing as much as their =
lungs would allow them=20

in the way of admonishing, entreating, protesting--cursing every one for a =
set of fools who were=20

playing straight into the hands of the police.  "Now then! Now then, childr=
en, stop that bellowing,=20

will you? There are no spies here. Paul Friche was only having his little j=
oke! We all know one=20

another, what?"  "Camels!" added Lemoine more forcibly. "They'll bring the =
patrols about our ears=20

for sure."  Paul Friche was not by any means the only man who was being vig=
orously attacked.=20

After the first two or three minutes of this kingdom of pandemonium, it was=
  "He might or He might=20

not," returned the old woman, promptly.  "It's not for me to say, nor yet t=
o guess on that point.  But=20

this I do know for certain--if the Lord hadna' thought upon Mr Daniel, then=
 Mr Daniel wouldna' have=20

been here to think upon _me_."  Duncan made no reply, and for some time rem=
ained quite silent.=20

Then he spoke again.  "Peg, what wass it that you would be reading to me la=
st night--something=20

about a malefactor, I'm thinking."  "Ay, it was about the robbers that was =
crucified on each side o'=20

the Lord.  One o' them reviled the Lord as he was hangin' there, the other =
found forgiveness, for=20

he was led to see what a lost sinner he was, and repented and confessed his=
 sins."  "That is fery=20

strange," said Duncan, after a few moments' thought.  "Do you think, Peg, t=
hat the robber that was=20

forgiven wass a--a murderer?"  "I have little doubt o't," answered Peg, "fo=
r I've heard say that they=20

think very little o' human life in them Eastern countries.  But whatever he=
 was, the blood of Jesus=20

Christ was able to cleanse him."  "Ay, but if he was a murderer, Peg, he di=
d not _deserve_ to be=20

forgiven."  "My bairn," said the old woman, with something of motherly tend=
erness in her tone, "it's=20

not them that _deserve_ to be forgiven that _are_ forgiven, but them that s=
ee that they _don't_=20

deserve it.  Didna' this robber say that he was sufferin' for his sins just=
ly?  That, surely, meant that=20

he deserved what he was getting, an' how is it possible to deserve both con=
demnation an'=20

forgiveness at the same time?  But he believed that Jesus was a king--able =
and willing to save him=20

though he did _not_ deserve it, so he asked to be remembered, and he _was_ =
remembered.  But=20

lie down now, bairn, an' rest: Ye are excitin' yoursel', an' that's bad for=
 ye."  A week or so after the=20



conversation above recorded, Dan brought a wheel-chair for Duncan, similar =
to the one he had=20

made for his father. As Duncan had been getting out of bed for several days=
 before, Dan found=20

him dressed and sitting up.  He therefore lifted him into the chair at once=
, and wheeled him out into=20

the garden, where a blaze of warm sunshine seemed to put new life into the =
poor invalid.  It had=20

been pre-arranged that old McKay should be brought down that same day to hi=
s new room, and=20

that he should also be=20


_
grudges were revived, old feuds taken up there, where they had previously b=
een interrupted.=20

Accusations of spying were followed by abuse for some past wrong of black-l=
egging or cheating a=20

confrere. The temperature of the room became suffocating. All these violent=
 passions seething=20

within these four so as to meet his son Duncan, without either of them bein=
g prepared for the=20

meeting.  "I don't feel at all sure that we are right in this arrangement,"=
 Elspie had said; but Dan=20

and Fergus, and Mrs Davidson and Jessie had thought otherwise, so she was o=
verruled.  Archie=20

was deputed to attend upon Duncan=20
