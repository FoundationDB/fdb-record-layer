letter in his pocket, and he thought himself very lucky to have so nicely secured her quarter's 

allowance. He returned to his own house in Eden Street, and in the privacy of his back parlor 

opened Mr. Danesfield's letter. It was a short letter, and, as it "You went into New York last night? 

What did you do that for?"  "I went in and pulled a lawyer friend of mine out of bed for a little 

confab. I don't mind telling you who it was. It was Harold Fox.... Clemmie, that feller that was here 

to see me about that

not written by Mr. Danesfield at all. Dove, however, by patient spelling and peering, presently 

mastered its contents.       "The Bank,        "High Street, Rosebury,          "April 21.  "MADAM,  "In 

Mr. Danesfield's absence, I send you a cheque for L17 10_s._, according to his orders. The 

cheque will require your signature at the back, and if you will kindly sign it you, or any one else, 

can obtain cash for the amount at the Metropolitan Bank, Strand.  "I expect Mr. Danesfield home 

in about six weeks; he has been wintering abroad.       "Yours faithfully,      "JOHN DAVIS."  Dove 

took the greater part of an hour to make this letter out; next he fingered the cheque, turning it 

backwards and forwards; then his face grew very blank--for, unsigned, that cheque was valueless. 

He was a violent man, and he uttered some strong expressions, and his wife, on hearing them, 

took good care to keep out of his way. She could not make out why Dove sat so long in the back 

parlor, and why he refused to eat his dinner, which was very hot and tasty. After a time, with a sigh 

of relief, she heard him go out.  Dove had hastily fastened up the letter, trusting to no one's 

noticing that it had been opened. Again he reached Miss Egerton's house; again he made his way 

from the roof to the upper landing, and from the upper landing to the girls' rooms; the letter was 

not placed on the table, but was skilfully slipped down between some books which lay in a pile on 

Jasmine's little writing-table. It might have been put there by any one who was dusting the room, 

and it might have lain in its present position unseen for many days. Dove hoped no one would 

perceive it; he scowled at the poor little Pink, who crouched away from him, and turning on his 

heel again, left the room.     CHAPTER XXXVI.  _THE JOY-BELL_.   It is to be feared that Poppy 

stole away from her work that morning. Poor Poppy was getting into a sadly defiant mood. She 

was getting thoroughly tired of her aunt, Mrs. Flint, and when Jasmine appeared and said a few 

coaxing words the naughty girl left her work undone, disregarded the many cries for Sarah Ann 

and Sarah Maria, and putting on her brilliant hat and her smart jacket, sallied forth citywards with 

Jasmine and Daisy. In due time the three reached the office of _The Joy-bell_ and were admitted 

into the presence of the editor.  "You musn't let me accept too low terms, Poppy," said Jasmine, 

as they were going in at the door.  Poppy nodded very brightly in reply, and Jasmine took the seat 

the editor offered her with a certain little air of modest elation.  "I got your note," she began, "and I 

thought you'd like to see me immediately, so I came. This is my sister; she knows all about it; 

she's in the story herself. I've drawn all my characters from the life; and my me about the date it 

was due. Harold says the time is up on it next Saturday."  "Josiah!"  "I also talked with another 

friend of mine who knew Jim purty well in his palmy days, and he says what that letter of yours 

says is so. He told me a lot more stuff, too."  "What? About Jim or Adoniah?"  "Both. What would 

you do if there wa'n't no way to save my place excepting by ruination of the other feller?"  "You'd 

see him stop for you, wouldn't you? I'd not give it a second thought, I'd just----"  "That ain't it, 

Clemmie. There's his darter, the sweetest little thing that God ever made. It would kill her, and I 

ain't got no right to hurt her just to save my own skin."  "You're right, Josiah."  "But what I'm to do, I 

don't know."  Mr. McGowan entered with an armful of wood, and as he stooped to drop it into the 

box Miss Pipkin looked sorrowfully at the Captain and shook her head.  "I've done my best," said 

the seaman, slowly.  "You'd think he was making his last will and testament from the way he's 

talking," remarked Miss Pipkin, trying hard to appear as though she was without the least concern. 

"Maybe I be, Clemmie. Maybe I be."  "What's the cause for all this dejection?" asked the minister. 

"Cause enough, Mack.... I'll be going back to the city to-morrow. I hate to leave you to the wiles of 



the menagerie, for if I ain't terrible mistook they're out for your blood, and they think they've got a 

whiff of it. But I cal'late they've got their ropes crossed. They've got the idea they're h'isting the 

mains'l, but it ain't nothing but the spanker. If I was going to stay aboard I'd give 'em a few lessons 

the next few days that they'd not forget all the rest of their lives."  "You're certainly mixing your 

figures in great shape this morning," commented the minister good-naturedly.  "Well, if mixing 

figures is like mixing drinks, making 'em more elevating to the thoughts, I cal'late I'd best do a little 

more mixing. There's going to be a squall right soon that'll test the ribs of the old salvation ark to 

the cracking p'int. If I was you I'd furl my sails a mite, and stand by, Mack."  "We're so accustomed 

to trouble now that----"  "Trouble? This is going to be hell, that is, unless luck or Providence takes 

a hand and steers her through. Your Elder thinks he's on the home stretch to winning his laurels, 

but if I was going to hang round here he'd wake up right sudden one of these fine mornings to find 

his wreath missing."  "Josiah, you're as wicked as you can be this morning. What on earth has 

come over you?" exclaimed Miss Pipkin with deep concern.  "You'd feel wicked, too, if you was 

dealing with that kind. But that there Elder puts me in mind of a tramp printer that come to work for 

Adoniah one time. Adoniah was a brother of mine," he explained in answer to a 


_
in the book too."  The editor--Mr. Potter was his name--had a habit of waving his hand when 

anything that he considered superfluous was being said; he now waved both Daisy and Poppy into 

the background, and addressed himself to Jasmine in a style which, as she said afterwards, 

riveted her attention on the spot.  "I wrote to you, Miss Mainwaring," he said, "because I saw 

germs of promise in your composition--it is young, of course, for you are very young, but it is fresh, 

and with due correctness, which I myself am willing to supply, I do not see why 'The Pursuit of 

Happiness' should not appear in our journal. We publish, however, only under certain conditions, 

and before I make any offer for your writings I should like to know whether you are able to fulfil 

them."  "That sounds in the nature of a bargain," here paper down the line then, and being short 

on help he took this tramp printer on. He gave him something to set up that the editor had writ,--

you couldn't tell one of the letters of that editor from t'other, hardly,--and that feller had a time with 

it. The piece was about some chap that was running for office, and it closed up with something like 

this: 'Dennis, my boy, look well to your laurels.' When that tramp got through with it, it come back 

to the editor like this: 'Dammit, my boy, bark well at your barrels.'"  Mr. McGowan laughed heartily, 

and Miss Pipkin struggled against a like inclination, doing her best to appear shocked.  "Josiah 

Pott!" she said at last. "I'd think you'd be ashamed telling such things!"  "It ain't nothing more than 

what Adoniah told, and it happened just as I spun it. You used to think
