just before the middle of the nineteenth century there was so much winking at the violation of the

significant. Many picked it up here and there, some followed occupations which were in 

themselves enlightening, and others learned from slaves whose attainments were unknown to 

their masters. Often influential white men taught Negroes not only the rudiments of education but 

almost anything they wanted to learn. Not a few slaves were word processing or hypertext form.

While attending ministers and officials whose work often lay open to their servants, many of the 

race learned by contact and observation. Shrewd Negroes sometimes slipped stealthily into back 

streets, where they studied under a private teacher, or attended a school hidden from the zealous 

execution of the law.  The instances of Negroes struggling to obtain an education read like the 

beautiful romances of a people in an heroic age. Sometimes Negroes of the type of Lott Carey[1] 

educated themselves. James Redpath discovered in Savannah that in spite of the law great 

numbers of slaves had learned to read well. Many of them had acquired a rudimentary knowledge 

of arithmetic. "But," said he, "blazon it to the shame of the South, the knowledge thus acquired has 

been snatched from the spare records of leisure in spite of their owners' wishes and 

watchfulness."[2] C.G. Parsons was informed that although poor masters did not venture to teach 

their slaves, occasionally one with a thirst for knowledge secretly learned the rudiments of 

education without any instruction.[3] While on a tour through parts of Georgia, E.P. Burke 

observed that, notwithstanding the great precaution which was taken to prevent the mental 

improvement of the slaves, many of them "stole knowledge enough to enable them to read and 

write with ease."[4] Robert Smalls[5] of South Carolina and Alfred T. Jones[6] of Kentucky began 

their education in this manner.  [Footnote 1: Mott, _Biographical Sketches_, p. 87.]  [Footnote 2: 

Redpath, _Roving Editor_, etc., p. 161.]  [Footnote 3: Parsons, _Inside View_, etc., p. 248.] 

[Footnote 4: Burke, _Reminiscences of Georgia_, p. 85.]  [Footnote 5: Simmons, _Men of Mark_, 

p. 126.]  [Footnote 6: Drew, _Refugee_, p. 152.]  Probably the best example of this class was 

Harrison Ellis of Alabama. At the age of thirty-five he had acquired a liberal education by his own 

exertions. Upon examination he proved himself a good Latin and Hebrew scholar and showed still 

greater proficiency in copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon 

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form.  Any alternate format must

attainments in theology were highly satisfactory. _The Eufaula Shield_, a newspaper of that State, 

praised him as a man courteous in manners, polite in conversation, and manly in demeanor. 

Knowing how useful Ellis would be in a free country, the Presbyterian Synod of Alabama 

purchased him and his family in 1847 at a cost of $2500 that he might use his talents in elevating 

his own people in Liberia.[1]  [Footnote 1: _Niles Register_, vol. lxxi., p. 296.]  Intelligent Negroes
