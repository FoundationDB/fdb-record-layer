philodendron monstera welcome to a town of strangers, where the faith had f=

 little that was done; so many years of toil, of indomitable courage and pe=

 end! But it was the seed of a great harvest. Mohammad had shown men what h=

=E2=80=9D  The spice of danger added to the zest of the _
cave, so that the Kureysh passed on, thinking that no man had entered there=
.  On the third night=20

the pursuit had been almost given over, and the two fugitives took up their=
 journey again. Mounted=20

on camels they journeyed to Yethrib. In eight days they reached the outskir=
ts of the city=20

(September 622). Mohammad was received with acclamation, and took up his re=
sidence among=20

his kindred. The seat of Islam was transferred from Mekka to Yethrib, hence=
forward to be known=20

as Medina,--_Medeenet-en-Nebee_, 'the City of the Prophet.'  This is the _H=
ijreh_, or Flight of the=20

Prophet, from which the Muslims date their history. Their first year began =
on the 16th day of June=20

of the Year of Grace 622.         *       *       *       *       *  A grea=
t change now comes over the=20

Prophet's life. It is still the same man, but the surroundings are totally =
different; the work to be=20

done is on a wider, rougher stage. Thus far we have seen a gentle, thoughtf=
ul boy tending the=20

sheep round Mekka;--a young man of little note, of whom the people only kne=
w that he was pure=20

and upright and true;--then a man of forty whose solitary communion with hi=
s soul has pressed=20

him to the last terrible questions that each man, if he will think at all, =
must some time ask himself--

What is life? What does this world mean? What is reality, what is truth? Lo=
ng months, years=20

perhaps, we know not how long and weary, filled with the tortures of doubt =
and the despair of ever=20

attaining to the truth, filled with the dreary thought of his aloneness in =
the relentless universe, and=20

the longing to end it all, brought at last their fruits--sure conviction of=
 the great secret of life, a firm=20

belief in the Creator in whom all things live and move and have their being=
, whom to serve is=20

man's highest duty and Buck=E2=80=99s decision did not affect them so much =
as the thought of what might=20

have happened. They were glad that it had ended this way, with no bones bro=
ken. White Tail was=20

exonerated in their eyes.                                     STORY V      =
            YOUNG BLACK BUCK=E2=80=99S=20

CHALLENGE TO A RACE   White Tail was so angry at Young Black Buck for accus=
ing him falsely=20

that for a moment after Father Buck=E2=80=99s decision, he couldn=E2=80=99t=
 find his tongue to speak. He simply=20

glared at Young Black Buck, and for the first time there came into his mind=
 a desire to punish his=20

accuser. He knew then that he would have to fight his antagonist some day, =
and the battle would=20

be a long and hard one, with neither side giving any terms.  When the excit=
ement had quieted a=20

little, he turned to Young Black Buck, and said: =E2=80=9CYou know that you=
 spoke falsely, and knowing it=20

your conscience should trouble you.=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck grinned. =E2=
=80=9CBut nobody else knows it,=E2=80=9D he=20

replied. =E2=80=9CTherefore my conscience don=E2=80=99t trouble me much.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSome day,=E2=80=9D added White Tail, =E2=80=9Cyou=20

will pay for this. We want no deceiver as the leader of the herd. I=E2=80=
=99ll battle you for the position.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9COh!=E2=80=9D sneered the other. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s a pretty s=
peech, White Tail. But we can=E2=80=99t battle for the leadership=20

until Father Buck has failed in the chase or hunt. He=E2=80=99s leader unti=
l then.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the day will come=20

when it will be between you and me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd then,=E2=80=9D r=
eplied Young Black Buck, airily, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll see that=20

you get the worst licking you ever had.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, I think it w=
ill be the other way.=E2=80=9D  White Tail crossed=20

the chasm again and joined the herd. There were plenty to sympathize with h=
im, and they=20

expressed themselves frankly. But there were not lacking others who admired=
 Young Black Buck,=20

and felt that he had been unjustly accused.  Mother Deer=20

years of struggling with careless, unthinking idolators; ten years of slow =
results, the gaining over of=20
