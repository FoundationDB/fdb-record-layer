philodendron monstera hickory chair on the hearth--perhaps the hermit himse=
lf had just risen from it, for there was a sheepskin lying before it for a =
mat and a pair of huge carpet slippers on either side of the sheepskin. The=
 dogs came in and sat down by the slippers, just where Ruth could rest a ha=
nd on either head, and so blinked at the flames while sight of it: it smote=
 him with a fierce impatience. Scarcely conscious that his movement of hot =
and hasty temper was absurd, he turned round again to escape it, and set hi=
s face towards the emblem of severe justice and the law, the tower of the T=
own House of Dunearn. When this second monitor made itself visible, a kind =
of dull philodendron monstera hickory chair on the hearth--perhaps the herm=
it himself had just risen from it, for there was a sheepskin lying before i=
t for a mat and a pair of huge carpet slippers on either side of the sheeps=
kin. The dogs came in and sat down by the slippers, just where Ruth could r=
est a hand on either head, and so blinked at the flames while sight of it: =
it smote him with a fierce impatience. Scarcely conscious that his movement=
 of hot and hasty temper was absurd, he turned round again to escape it, an=
d set his face towards the emblem of severe justice and the law, the tower =
of the Town House of Dunearn. When this second monitor made itself visible,=
 a kind of dull _
yowling like the great Tom-cat it was.  On and on plunged the poor mules, s=
weating and fearful.=20

Ruth and Fred Hatfield clung like mussels to a rock, while the panther boun=
ded into the air,=20

screeching and spitting, always catching the tail of the cart as it came do=
wn--afraid to leap off and=20

likewise afraid to hang on.  The mules came to a hill. They were badly wind=
ed by now and their=20

pace grew slower. The panther scratched along the reach nearer to the two h=
uman passengers,=20

and Ruth saw its eyes blazing like huge carbuncles in the dusk. There was a=
 fork of the roads at=20

the foot of the hill. Fred Hatfield uttered a shriek of despair as the mule=
s took the right hand road=20

and struck into the bush itself--a narrow and treacherous track where the l=
imbs of the trees=20

threatened to brush all three passengers from the cart at any instant.  "Oh=
! oh! we're done for=20

now!" yelled Fred. "They've taken the road to Rattlesnake Hill. We'll be ki=
lled as sure as fate!"=20

CHAPTER VIII  FIRST AT SNOW CAMP   Fred Hatfield's fears might have been we=
ll-founded had=20

the mules not been so winded. They had run at least four miles from the rai=
lroad and even with the=20

fear of the snarling panther behind them they could not continue much farth=
er at this pace.  But=20

over this rougher and narrower road the timber cart jounced more than ever.=
 In all its life the=20

panther had probably never received such a shaking-up. The mules had not go=
ne far on what Fred=20

called the Rattlesnake Hill Road when, with an ear-splitting cry, the huge =
cat leaped out from the=20

flying wagon and landed in the bush.  "We're saved!" gasped Ruth. "That dre=
adful beast is gone."=20

Fred immediately tried to soothe the mules into a more leisurely pace; but =
nothing but fatigue=20

would bring them down. Thoroughly frightened, they kept starting and runnin=
g without cause, and=20

there was no chance in this narrow road to turn them.  The fact that it asc=
ended the side of the hill=20

steeply did more toward abating the pace of the runaways than aught else. T=
he track crept along=20

the edge of several abrupt precipices, too--not more than thirty or forty f=
eet high, but enough to=20

wreck the wagon and kill mules and passengers had they gone over the brink.=
  These dangerous=20

places in the winding road were what had so frightened young Hatfield at fi=
rst. He knew this=20

locality well. But to Ruth the place was doubly terrifying, for she was los=
t--completely lost.  "Oh,=20

where are we going? What will become of us?" she murmured, still obliged to=
 cling with both=20

hands to the jumping, rocking reach.  The mules could gallop no longer. Fre=
d yelled at them "Yea-

a! Yea-a!" at the top of his voice. They began to pay some attention--or el=
se were so winded that=20

they would have halted of their own volition. And as the cart ceased its th=
umping and rumbling a=20

light suddenly blazed up before them, shining through the dusk, and higher =
up the hill.  "What is=20

that? A house?" cried Ruth, seizing Fred by the shoulder.  Not more than ha=
lf an hour ago the girl=20

from the Red Mill had slipped out of the private car at the Emoryville Cros=
sing, in pursuit of the=20

runaway youth; now they were deep in the wilderness and surrounded by such =
dangers as Ruth=20

had never dreamed of before.  The baying of a hound and the angry barking o=
f another dog was=20

Ruth's only answer. She turned to see Fred Hatfield sliding down off the ca=
rt.  "You sha'n't leave=20

me!" cried Ruth, jumping down after him and seizing the runaway desperately=
. "You sha'n't=20

abandon me in this forest, away from everybody. You're a cruel, bad boy, Fr=
ed Hatfield; but you've=20

just _got_ to be decent to me."  "What did you interfere for, anyway?" he d=
emanded, snarling like=20

a cross dog. "Lemme go!"  But if Ruth was afraid of what terrors the forest=
 might hold, and of her=20

general situation, she had seen enough of this boy to know that he was just=
 a poor, miserable=20

coward--he aroused no fear in her heart.  "I'm going to just stick to you, =
Freddie," she assured him.=20

She was quite as strong as he, she knew. "You are going home. At least, you=
 shall go back to Mr.=20



Cameron--"  Just then the flare of light ahead broadened and a gruff voice =
shouted:  "Hullo! what's=20

wanted? Down, Tiger! Behave, Rose!"  The dogs instantly stopped their clamo=
r. The light came=20

through the open door and the glazed window of a little hut perched on a ro=
ck overlooking the=20

road. The mules had halted just below this eminence, and Ruth saw that ther=
e was a winding path=20

leading up to the door of the hovel. Down this path came the huge figure of=
 a man, with the two=20

dogs gamboling about him in the snow. The occupant of this cabin in the wil=
derness carried a rifle=20

in one hand.  "Hullo!" he said again. "That's Sim Rogers's team--I know tho=
se mules. Are you=20

there, Sim? What's happened ye?"  "Who is it?" whispered Ruth, again, still=
 clinging to Fred's=20

jacket.  "It's--it's the Rattlesnake Man," returned the boy, in a shaking v=
oice.  "Who is he?" asked=20

Ruth, in surprise.  "He lives here alone on the hill. He's a hermit. They s=
ay he's crazy. And I guess=20

he is," added Fred, with a shudder.  "Why do you think he's crazy?"  But be=
fore Fred could reply--if=20

he intended to--the hermit reached the road. He was an old but very vigorou=
s-looking man, burly=20

and stout, with a great mat of riotous gray hair under his fur cap, and a b=
eard his thoughts ran on.=20

Lady Reseda, Lady Reseda: what had she to do with it?--or Millefleurs, Mill=
efleurs!--they were=20

straws upon the surface, showing how rapidly the torrent ran, not anything =
he could catch hold of.=20

There was one name, however, round which that dark current of his thoughts =
eddied and swirled=20

as in a whirlpool--the name of John Erskine. There could not be any doubt t=
hat _he_ had=20

something to do with it. He had thrust himself into a matter that did not c=
oncern him, and he was=20

paid for his folly. It was not _his_ place to stand up for Carry, to resent=
 her husband's rudeness--

what had he to do with it? He was an intrusive, officious fool, thrusting h=
imself into other people's=20

business. If he brought himself into trouble by it, was that Rintoul's faul=
t? Was he bound to lay=20

himself open to a great deal of annoyance and embarrassment in order to sav=
e John Erskine from=20

the consequences of his own folly? This was the question that would not let=
 him rest. Nothing=20

Rintoul had been a party to had compromised John Erskine. It was all his ow=
n doing. Why did he,=20

for his pleasure, take the Scaur road at all? Why did he stop and quarrel, =
seeing the other was=20

excited? Why rush down in that silly way with his coat torn to make an exhi=
bition of himself? All=20

these things were folly,--folly beyond extenuation. He ought to have known =
better; and whatever=20

followed, was it not his own fault?  Along with this, however, there were o=
ther thoughts that flashed=20

at Rintoul, and would not let him carry on steadily to the conclusion he de=
sired. There are some=20

things that are permissible and some that are not permissible. A gentleman =
need not betray=20

himself: it is not indispensable that he should take the world into his con=
fidence, if any accident=20

happens to him, and he gets himself into trouble; but he must not let anoth=
er get into trouble for=20

him,--that comes into the category of the "anything disgraceful" which Lord=
 Lindores was assured=20

his son had never been guilty of. No! he had never done anything disgracefu=
l. How was he to=20

escape it now? And then, looking back upon all the circumstances, Rintoul s=
adly perceived what a=20

fool he had been not to put everything on a straightforward footing at once=
. He reflected that he=20

could have given almost any account of the occurrence he pleased. There was=
 nobody to=20

contradict him: and all would have been over without complication, without =
any addition from the=20

popular fancy. It seemed to him now, reflecting upon everything, all the de=
tails that had filled him=20

with an unreflecting panic then, that nothing could have been easier than t=
o explain the whole=20

matter. But he had lost that good moment, and if he made the confession now=
, every false=20

conception which he had feared would be realised. People would say, If this=
 was all, why make=20



any mystery about it? Why expose another to disgrace and suffering? Rintoul=
 had not intelligence=20

enough, though he had always plumed himself on his common-sense, to thread =
his way among=20

those conflicting reasonings. He grew sick as the harpies of recollection a=
nd thought rushed upon=20

him from all quarters. He had no power to stand against them,--to silence h=
er who cried, "Why did=20

you not do this?"--while he held at bay the other who swooped down upon him=
, screaming, "How=20

could you do that?" When it grew more than he could bear he retreated to hi=
s bed, and flung=20

himself exhausted upon it, throwing out his arms with the unconscious histr=
ionic instinct of=20

excitement, appealing to he knew not what. How could he do this thing? How =
could he leave it=20

undone? Rintoul in his despair got up again and found an opiate which had b=
een given him when=20

he had toothache, long ago, in days when toothache was the worst torture he=
 knew. He swallowed=20

it, scarcely taking the trouble to mark how much he was taking, though the =
moment after he took a=20

panic, and got up and examined the bottle to assure himself that all was ri=
ght. It was nearly=20

daybreak by the time that this dose sent him to sleep,--and he scarcely kne=
w he had been asleep,=20

so harassing were his dreams, till he came to himself at last, to find that=
 it was eleven o'clock in a=20

dull forenoon, his shutters all open, and the dim light pouring in. The hor=
rors of waking when the=20

mind is possessed by great misery is a well-worn subject,--everybody knows =
what it is to have=20

Care seated by his bedside, ready to pounce upon him when he opens his eyes=
; but Rintoul had=20

scarcely escaped from that dark companion. She had been with him in his dre=
ams: he felt her grip=20

him now, with no surprise, if with a redoublement of pain.  It was nearly m=
id-day when he got=20

down-stairs, and he found nobody. His father was out. Millefleurs was out. =
His breakfast was=20

arranged upon a little table near the fire, his letters laid ready, the cou=
nty newspaper--a little=20

innocent broadsheet--by his plate. But he could not take advantage of any o=
f these luxuries; he=20

swept his letters into his pocket, flung the paper from him, then reflected=
 that there might _be=20

something in it_, and picked it up again with trembling hands. There was _s=
omething in it_. There=20

was an account of the private examination before the sheriff of Mr John Ers=
kine of Dalrulzian on=20

suspicion of being concerned in the death of the late lamented Mr Torrance =
of Tinto. "From=20

circumstances=20


_
very good eyes indeed, for he immediately muttered:  "Ha! Sim's mules--been=
 running like the very=20

kildee! All of a sweat, I vow. Two young folks--ha! Scared. Runaway--ah! Wh=
at's that?"  The dogs=20

began to bay again. Far behind the boy and girl--down the hill road--rose t=
he eyrie scream of the=20

disappointed panther.  "That cat-o'-mountain chase ye, boy?" the hermit ask=
ed, sharply.  But Fred=20

had no answer. He stood, in Ruth's sharp clutch, and hung his head without =
a word. The girl had=20

to reply:  "I never was so scared. The beast jumped right on the cart and w=
e just shook him off=20

down the hill yonder."  "A girl," said the hermit, talking to himself, but =
talking aloud, in the same=20

fashion as before. Without doubt, being so much alone in these wilds he had=
 contracted the habit=20

of talking to himself--or to his dogs--or to whatever creature chanced to b=
e his company.  "A girl.=20

Not Sim's gal. Sim ain't got nothing but louts of boys. Let me see. What bo=
y is this?"  "He is Fred=20

Hatfield," said Ruth, simply. Fred jumped and tried to pull away from her; =
regretted to say, had=20

thought it right to relegate Mr Erskine to Dunnottar jail, there to await t=
he result of a more formal=20

inquiry, to be held on the 25th at Dunearn. "We have little fear that a gen=
tleman so respected will=20

easily be able to clear himself," it was added; and "a tribute of respect t=
o the late Patrick=20

Torrance,--a name which, for genial _bonhomie_ and sterling qualities, will=
 long be remembered in=20

this county," wound up the paragraph. The greater portion of its readers, a=
lready acquainted with=20

the news by report, read it with exclamations of concern, or cynical rustic=
 doubt whether John=20

Erskine was so much respected, or Pat Torrance as sure of a place in the co=
unty's memory, as=20

the 'Dunearn Sentinel' said; but all Rintoul's blood seemed to rush to his =
head and roar like a=20

torrent in his ears as he read the paragraph. He could hear nothing but tha=
t rushing of excitement=20

and the bewildered half-maddened thoughts which seemed to accompany it. Wha=
t was he to do?=20

What was he to do?  There was a little interval, during which=20


_
The hermit, however, seemed to have never heard the name before. He only sa=
id, idly:  "Fred=20

Hatfield, eh? You his sister?"  "No, sir. I am Ruth Fielding," she replied.=
  "Ruth Fielding? Don't=20

know her. She's not belongin' around here. No. Well, how'd you get here? An=
d with Sim's mules?"=20

Ruth told him briefly, but without bringing Fred Hatfield's trouble into th=
e story. They had got=20

aboard the timber cart at the crossing, the mules had run away, the panther=
 had taken a ride with=20

them and-- here they were!  The hermit merely nodded in acknowledgment of t=
he tale. His=20

questions dealt with her alone:  "Where do you belong?"  "The party I was w=
ith are bound for=20

Snow Camp. Do you know where that is, sir?" Ruth asked.  "Not ten miles awa=
y. Yes."  "They will=20

be worried--"  "I will get you over there before bedtime. Go up to my house=
 and wait. This boy and=20

I will stable the mules in my barn; it's just along the road here. Sim will=
 follow the beasts and find=20

them; but he'll be some time in getting along. He lives along this road him=
self --not far, not far. Ah!"=20

The old man talked mostly as though he spoke to himself. He seldom more tha=
n glanced at her,=20

his eye roving everywhere but at the person to whom he spoke. Ruth started =
toward the house=20

from which the fire and lamplight shone so cordially. The dogs stood before=
 her--Tiger, the big=20

hound, and Rose, a beautiful Gordon setter.  "Let her alone," said the herm=
it to his canine=20

companions. "She's all right."  The dogs seemed to agree with him immediate=
ly. The hound sniffed=20

once at the hem of Ruth's frock; Rose gambolled about her and licked her ha=
nd. Ruth now=20

realized how cold she was, and she ran quickly up to the open door of the c=
abin.  On the threshold=20

she hesitated a moment. A great lamp with a tin shade, hanging from the raf=
ters, illuminated all the=20

center of the room. At one end burned a hot log fire on the hearth; but the=
 two further corners were=20

in gloom. Ruth had said she had never seen a log cabin, and it was true. Th=
is one seemed to her=20

to be a very cozy place indeed, even if it was the habitation of a hermit. =
 As she entered, however,=20

she found that know what he was doing. His mind was not prepared for such a=
n emergency. He=20

tossed about like a cork upon the boiling stream of his own thoughts--helpl=
ess, bewildered, driven=20

hither and thither. He only came to himself when he felt the damp air in hi=
s face, and found himself=20

setting out on foot on the road to Dunearn: the irregular lines of the hous=
etops in front of him, the=20

tall tower of the Town House pointing up to the dull skies, standing out fr=
om the rest of the=20

buildings like a landmark to indicate what route he was to take. When he ca=
ught sight of that he=20

came violently to himself, and began at once to recover some conscious cont=
rol over his actions.=20

The operations of his mind became clear to him; his panic subsided. After a=
ll, who could harm=20

John Erskine? He had been very foolish; he had exposed himself to suspicion=
; but no doubt a=20

gentleman so respected would be able to clear himself--a gentleman so respe=
cted. Rintoul=20

repeated the words to himself, as he had repeated the names of Millefleurs =
and Lady Reseda the=20

night before. And what would it matter to John Erskine to put off till the =
25th his emancipation and=20

the full recognition of his innocence? If he had a bad cold, it would have =
the same result--

confinement to the house, perhaps to his room. What was that? Nothing: a tr=
ifling inconvenience,=20

that any man might be subject to. And there could be no doubt that a gentle=
man so respected----

There would be evidence that would clear him: it was not possible that any =
proof could be=20

produced of a thing that never happened; and the whole county, if need be, =
would bear witness to=20

John Erskine's character--that he was not quarrelsome or a brawler; that th=
ere was no motive for=20

any quarrel between him and----  Rintoul's feet, which had been going rapid=
ly towards Dunearn,=20

went on slower and slower. He came to a pause altogether about a mile from =
the town. Was it=20



necessary to go any farther? What could he do to-day? Certainly there would=
 be no advantage to=20

Erskine in anything he did to-day. He turned round slowly, and went back to=
wards Lindores.=20

Walking that way, there was nothing but the long sweep of the=20


_
suffocating, unpleasant odor in the place. It was light, yet penetrating en=
ough to be distinguished=20

clearly. In one of the darker corners was what appeared to be a big green c=
hest, and it had a=20

glazed window frame for a cover. Something rustled there.  him and Tinto, t=
o which his eyes could=20

not but turn as he walked slowly on. The flag was up again--a spot of red a=
gainst the dull sky--and=20

the house stood out upon its platform with that air of ostentation which fr=
etted the souls of the=20

surrounding=20
