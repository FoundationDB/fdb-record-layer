restless pacing crossed and recrossed in front of the open door. But anon, =
when the latter came to=20

a halt under the lintel and with his foot almost across the threshold, youn=
g Lalouet was upon him=20

in an instant, barring the way to the inner sanctum.  "Keep your distance, =
citizen," he said drily, "no=20

one is allowed to enter here."  Instinctively Martin-Roget had drawn back--=
suddenly awed despite=20

himself by the air of mystery which hung over that darkened room, and by th=
e dim silhouette of the=20

sinister tyrant who at his approach had with equal Bill was placed in the m=
iddle on a comfortable=20

green blanket with the celebrated "bum-rella" erected over him to keep off,=
 not the rain, but, the=20

too glorious sunshine.    CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.  AN AUSPICIOUS BEGINNING AND=
=20

SUSPICIOUS ENDING.  Let loose in the wilderness!  How romantic, how inexpre=
ssibly delightful,=20

that idea seems to some minds!  Ay, even when the weight of years begins to=
 stiffen the joints and=20

slack the cords of life the memory of God's great, wild, untrammelled, beau=
tiful wilderness comes=20

over the spirit like a refreshing=20


_
suddenness cowered in his lair, drawing his limbs together and thrusting hi=
s head forward, low=20

down over the desk, like a leopard crouching for a spring. But this spell o=
f awe only lasted a few=20

seconds, during which Martin-Roget's unsteady gaze encountered the half-moc=
king, wholly=20

supercilious glance of young Lalouet.  The next, he had recovered his prese=
nce of mind. But this=20

crowning act of audacious insolence broke the barrier of his self-restraint=
. An angry oath escaped=20

him.  "Are we," he exclaimed roughly, "back in the days of Capet, the tyran=
t, and of Versailles, that=20

patriots and citizens are treated like menials and obtrusive slaves? Pardie=
u, citizen Carrier, let me=20

tell you this...."  "Pardieu, citizen Martin-Roget," something like the pul=
se of youth.  We sometimes=20

think what a joy it would be if youth could pass through its blessings with=
 the intelligent experience=20

of age.  And it may be that this is to be one of the joys of the future, wh=
en man, redeemed and=20

delivered from sin by Jesus Christ, shall find that the memory of the sorro=
ws, sufferings,=20

weaknesses of the past shall add inconceivably to the joys of the present. =
 It may be so.  Judging=20

from analogy it does not seem presumptuous to suppose and hope that it will=
 be so.  "Sufficient=20

unto the day," however, is the joy thereof.  When the two canoes pushed off=
 and swept rapidly=20

over the fair bosom of Red River, the heart of Archie Sinclair bounded with=
 a feeling of exultant joy=20

which it=20


_
of a savage dog, "let _me_ tell _you_ that for less than two pins I'll thro=
w you into the next barge=20

that will float with open portholes down the Loire. Get out of my presence,=
 you swine, ere I call=20

Fleury to throw you out."  Martin-Roget at the insult and the threat had be=
come as pale as the=20

linen at his throat: a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead and he passed=
 his hand two or three=20

was capable of increase, while the bosom of his invalid brother was filled =
with a sort of calm=20

serenity which constituted, in his opinion at the time being, a quite suffi=
cient amount of felicity.=20

When we add that the other hunters were, in their several ways, pretty much=
 in the same condition=20

as the boys, we have said enough to justify the remark that their circumsta=
nces were inexpressibly=20
