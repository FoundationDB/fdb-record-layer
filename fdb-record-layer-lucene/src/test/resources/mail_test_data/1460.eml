the stranger's smile, the=20

mournful eyes,     Much marveling whence she fared. And said, "As pale     =
She seemed as=20

bramble-blooms in Eden's vale."      When homeward Adam came, the child she=
 set     Upon his=20

knee, saying, "Erewhile I met     An angel. So to me she seemed, as there  =
   She stood. So tall, so=20

yellow-haired, so fair;     And lo, she brought again the babe."           =

She ended low. "Doubtless an angel, love, sith     So you deem her," he rep=

Those words, sad pondering "so fair, so tall."     But nothing uttered.    =
                       In that land=20

long time     They lingered. And the child slow faded, till     One day Eve=
 frighted cried, "See,=20

Adam, still     She lies! Ah, little one, unseal those eyes!     Rouse but =
awhile, ere waning daylight=20

flies!"     For she discerned not yet its doom, nor knew     The hour was n=
ear.                        But=20

Adam, parting, drew     Beneath the thorn, lest he might see the child.    =
 And all the lone hours=20

through Eve, babbling, smiled     Adown. And blew her warm breath o'er the =
cheeks     So wan.=20

"The night grows cold," she said. "Sleep creeps     Dull on my babe. The ni=

failures are due to=20

amateur informed me that he had failed six times, but on the seventh, by at=
tending to the advice=20

given above, the silvering was a perfect success, and all seemed then as ea=

She said.               Nor dreamed aneath those lids closed still,     The=
 death film hung.=20

A wind uprose, and swept     Among the dry leaves heaped, where lowly slept=
     The child. Cold=20

grew the night and colder, till     Against the east the dawn glowed daffod=
il,     Above dun wolds=20

white with new-fallen snow.     So rose the day and widened into morning gl=
ow     With rosy tints=20

o'erstreaked, and faintly blurred     With flecks of cloud.                =
           Still lay the child, nor=20

stirred.     Dumb Eve looked down, nor knew Death's pallid masque,     And =
strove to wake the=20

maid. In vain. Her task     Was done. And as she gazed, a gentle grasp     =
Soft loosed the dead=20

from that cold mother's clasp,     And Lilith laid the babe in its chill be=
d--     Straightened the limbs,=20

and kissed the little head.     And o'er the sleeper, kneeling, she did lea=
n.     Forth from her breast=20

she drew, close folded, green,     A sheath of leaves, bright shining, lust=
rous--wet     With tears--

that in those waxen hands she set.     Then those shut leaves oped slow. An=
d low and frail=20

Bloomed 'mid the tintless snows a snow-drop pale.     Soft Lilith said, "Fo=
r this pale sleeper's sake,=20

O Eve, one kiss bestow. E'en thou canst take     Pity on me. For thee new, =
happy days await,=20

But I--I am forever desolate.     For thee fresh love will bloom above this=
 mould;     For thee, in=20

coming years, pure lips unfold;     But I--no more, no more, shall feel the=
 warm     Breath 'gainst my=20

breast. Nay, nor the baby arm     Soft clasping me. Nor see the feet that p=
ass     Like falling music,=20

through the waving grass.     Therefore, one pardoning kiss give e'er I go =
    To my own land,=20

beyond this realm of snow."     And Eve, uprising, took the hand she gave, =
    And weeping, kissed;=20

and parted by that grave.      Stood Adam, after-time, by that small mound.=
     Low at their feet a=20

sheaf of leaves Eve found,     Wherein white flowers shone. "Oh, like," she=
 said,     "To this was=20

one abloom within the bed     Where lies the child. And fair, O, passing fa=
ir,     She was, and tall,=20

with yellow gleaming hair,     And cheeks soft flushed as fresh pomegranate=
 bells;     And dewy=20

eyes, like violets in the dells,     Who came. So, silent passed that stran=
ger fair     Who loved our=20

babe. And e'er I well was ware,     She vanished."      the adjustments for=
 a while, but wait until the=20

air is steadier, when perhaps it will be quite satisfactory. If not, turn i=
t on a bright star; if the=20

adjustments are at fault, the black shadow of the flat, when the star is ou=
t of focus, will not be=20

central in the slightly expanded image, but will be on one side of the expa=
nded disk. Use a power=20

of 200 to 300.  If the black spot is near one of the sides corresponding wi=
th major axis of flat, the=20

side screw will put it right. We will assume that the black spot is nearer =
the edge of flat nearest the=20

mirror, and that the eyepiece is beyond the focus proper for the star; then=
 _unscrew_ the side=20

screw. If the spot is nearer the other edge of flat, _screw it up_ little b=
y little, taking the hand out of=20

the telescope each time, and see what the effect is. The movement and alter=
ation can be watched=20

while the hand is in the tube. If the spot is seen either the top or bottom=
 of the flat that is in the=20

direction of the diameter of tube, the middle screw must be slightly loosen=
ed and the flat revolved.=20

Let the screw just bite so as to hold, and tighten it when correct. The def=
inition of a star should=20

now be perfect, and by daylight observe the adjustments; it may appear that=
 the reflected circles=20

are not concentric, but if the definition on a star is good in still air, c=
onsider the appearances=20

correct adjustments, except that the reflection of the black spot on mirror=
 may be made concentric.=20

It sometimes happens that a persistent and rigid centreing of the reflectio=
ns on _face of flat_ are=20

not the positions for best definition, perhaps from a slight optical eccent=
ricity somewhere in the=20

instrument.  The adjustments of a reflector are soon familiar and easy, and=
 there is this to be said,=20

the adjustments can be manipulated upon to any amount without the slightest=
 injury to the=20



instrument; there is no danger of any sort, and the instrument can be perfe=
cted in its adjustments=20

by daylight, and this makes it both pleasant and convenient to leisurely wo=
rk at, for experience=20

sake. The instrument need not be out of doors either, unless an artificial =
star from a black pin=E2=80=99s=20

head=E2=80=94which is better in _strong_ sunlight than a thermometer bulb=
=E2=80=94is to be used instead of a=20

star at night, if so let it be as high as possible.  Be careful not to scre=
w up the small screws too=20

tight, as the fine threads are liable to be=20

She was," Eve said. "A princess, with a face     Surpassing fair, who trod =
the pathway bright=20

Among the mists, beyond the rim of night     To her own land."             =
          And oft in after-time,=20

When Cain had lain in her young arms, and chime     Of voices round her cam=
e, and clasp of=20

hands,     And thick with         THE DURABILITY OF SILVER FILMS.  It somet=
imes happens that=20

the films do not last so long as they are expected to do, that is, they som=
etimes lose their splendid=20

lustre sooner than they should do. When it is remembered that though the pr=
ocess of silvering is=20

an easy operation to perform, yet it is a delicate chemical one,=20


_
Eve silent sat, remembering that one child     Among the snowdrops, in a No=
rthern wild.     And=20

Lilith dwelt again in her own land;     With Eblis still strayed far. And h=
and in hand     They talked;=20

the while her phantom brood in glee     Laughed overhead. Then looking on t=
he sea,     Low=20

voiced, she sang. So sweet the idle song,     She said, "From Paradise, for=
gotten long,     It comes.=20

An elfin echo that doth rise     Upward from summer seas to bending skies. =
    In coming days,=20

from any earthly shore     It shall not fail. And sweet forever more     Sh=
all make my memory.=20

several good conditions all meet together, this is not to be wondered at, b=
ut it is certain the=20

instructions given above will reduce the chances of failure to a minimum, a=
nd imperfect results will=20

be rare. The silver usually lasts a long time. I know silver films that hav=
e been in use for ten years.=20

Do not suppose that a long and badly worn surface will fail to show the det=
ail and colours of the=20

planets, the fullest detail also of the moon or the stars. It is surprising=
 how long a silvered surface=20

will continue to do its full work while its appearance is much deteriorated=
