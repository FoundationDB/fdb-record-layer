philodendron monstera  "Parson" possesses an almost uncanny memory and attributes it to his inability to write things down and therefore being entirely dependent upon his memory.

ago in Sparta, Georgia."  When the Civil War came he remembers hearing one night "Sherman is 

coming." It was said that Wheeler's Cavalry of the Confederates was always "running and 

fighting." Lane had moved the family to Macon, Georgia, and they lived on a place called 

"Dunlap's Hill." That night four preachers were preaching "Fellow soldiers, the enemy is just here 

to Bolden's Brook, sixteen miles away and you may be carried into judgment; prepare to meet 

your God." While they were preaching, bombs began to fly because Wheeler's Cavalry was only 

six miles away instead of 16 miles; women screamed and children ran. Wheeler kept wagons 

ahead of him so that when one was crippled the other would replace it. He says he imagines he 

hears the voice of Sherman now, saying: "Tell Wheeler to go on to South Carolina; we will mow it 

down with grape shot and plow it in with bombshell."  Emancipation came and with it great 

rejoicing. He recalls that Republicans were called "Radicals" just after the close of the Civil War. 

Mr. Lane was able to save all of his meat, silver, and other valuables during the war by having a 

cave dug in the hog pasture; the hogs trampled over it daily.  "Parson" states that among the 

papers in his trunk he has a piece of money called "shin plasters" which was used during the Civil 

War.  The slaves were not allowed to attend schools of any kind; and school facilities immediately 

following Emancipation were very poor; when the first teacher, Miss Smith, a Yankee, came to 

Sparta, Georgia and began teaching Sunday School, all of the children were given testaments or 

catechisms which their parents were afraid for them to keep lest their masters whip them, but the 

teacher called on the parents meaning of the original statue was? If the group was of great 

antiquity, we may be pretty sure that it was not political or historic, but religious; for primaeval art is 

the handmaid of religion; historic representation and political portraiture belong generally to a later 

age. We cannot tell with certainty even that the original statue was Roman: it may have been 

brought to Rome among the spoils of some conquered city, in which case it would have no 

reference to Roman history at all. We must banish it entirely from our minds, with all the 

associations and impressions which cling to it, and we must do the same with regard to the whole 

of that circle of legends woven out of misinterpreted monuments or customs, with the 

embellishments of pure fancy, which grouped itself round the apocryphal statues of the seven 

kings in the Capitol, aptly compared by Arnold to the apocryphal portraits of the early kings of 

Scotland in Holyrood and those of the mediaeval founders of Oxford in the Bodleian. We must 

clear our minds altogether of these fictions; they are not even ancient: they came into existence at 

a time when the early history of Rome was viewed in the deceptive light of her later achievements; 

when, under the influence of altered circumstances, Roman sentiment had probably undergone a 

considerable change; and when, consequently, the national imagination no longer pointed true to 

anything primaeval.  Race, when tribal peculiarities are once formed, is a most important feature in 

history; those who deny this and who seek to resolve everything, even in advanced humanity, into 

the influence of external circumstances or of some particular external circumstance, such as food, 

are not less one-sided or less wide

to them that they were as free as their former masters.  "Parson" states that when he was born, 

his master named him "Monk." His grandfather, Willis Andrews, who was a free man of Pittsburg, 

Pennsylvania, purchased the freedom of his wife Lizzie, but was never able to purchase their four 

children; his father, also named Willis, died a slave, was driven in an ox-cart to a hole that had 

been dug, put in it and covered up; his mother nor children could stop work to attend the funeral, 

but after the Emancipation, he and a brother returned, found "Uncle Bob" who helped bury him 

and located his grave. Soon race as the universal solution. Who can doubt that between the 

English and the French, between the Scotch and the Irish, there are differences of character which 

have profoundly affected and still affect the course of history? The case is still stronger if we take 

races more remote from each other, such as the English and the Hindoo. But the further we 

inquire, the more reason there appears to be for believing that peculiarities of race are themselves 

originally formed by the influence of external circumstances on the primitive tribe; that, however 

marked and ingrained they may be, they are not

he had been given his freedom, "Parson" walked from Union Springs, Alabama where his last 

master had taken him--back to Macon, Georgia, and rejoined his mother, Rachel, his brothers, 

Samuel Augustus, San Francisco, Simon Peter, Lewis, Carter, Powell Wendell and sisters, Lizzie 

and Ann; they all dropped the name of their master, Lane, and took the name indelible. 

Englishmen and Frenchmen are closely assimilated by education; and the weaknesses of 

character supposed to be inherent in the Irish gradually disappear under the more benign 

influences of the New World. Thus, by ascribing the achievements of the Romans to the special 

qualities of their race, we should not be solving the problem, but only
