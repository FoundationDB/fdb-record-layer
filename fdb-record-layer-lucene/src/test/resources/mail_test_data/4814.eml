the opinion of Richelet, that "l'anagramme est une des plus grandes ineptie=
s de l'esprit humain: il=20

faut etre sot pour s'en amuser, et pis que sot pour en faire."  With such a=
n appreciation of the=20

value of anagrams, is it surprising that the French should have produced so=
 few good ones? M. de=20

Pixerecourt mentions two which he deems so unexceptionable, that they might=
 induce us to=20

overlook the general worthlessness of that kind of composition. They are as=
 follows:        "Belitre,=20

"Liberte."        "Benoist,        "Bien sot."  Now, the first is only true=
 in France, where true liberty was=20

never understood: and the second is true nowhere. _Benoist_ is merely a vul=
gar name, and the=20

adoption of it does not necessarily imply that the bearer is a "sot." M. De=
 Pixerecourt might have=20

quoted some better samples; the famous one, for instance, on the assassin o=
f Henri III.:--=20

"Frere Jacques Clement,       "C'es l'enfer qui m'a cree."  Or the followin=
g Latin anagrams on the=20

names of two of his most distinguished countrymen:--        "De la Monnoi, =
      "A Delio nomen."=20

"Voltaire,       "O alte vir!"  I was on the point of relinquishing in desp=
air my search for anagrams,=20

when an accidental circumstance put me in possession of one of the best spe=
cimens I have met=20

with. Some time ago, in an idle mood, I took up a newspaper for the purpose=
 of glancing at its=20

contents, and as I was about to read, I discovered that I held the paper by=
 the wrong end. Among=20

the remarkable headings of news there was one which I was desirous of decyp=
hering before I=20

restored the paper to its proper position, and this happened to be the word=
 "[inverted: DNALERI]".=20

Instead, however, of making out the name from letters thus inverted, I foun=
d the anagram--=20

"Daniel R."  My first impression, on ascertaining this result, was one of h=
orror at the treasonable=20

"jeu de mots" I had so unwittingly perpetrated. Remembering, however, that =
Daniel O'Connell is=20

dead, and that Irish loyalty has nothing to fear from Daniel the Second, I =
resolved to give the=20

public the benefit of the discovery by sending it to you for "NOTES AND QUE=
RIES."      HENRY H.=20

BACHELOR DINNER]  At a bachelor dinner the host may provide corsage bouquet=
s for the ladies=20

and boutonni=C3=A8res for the men. It is also a pretty compliment for him t=
o send to the chaperon at his=20

afternoon or evening reception, flowers for her to wear. But this is not es=
sential, and is a=20

compliment that may be dispensed with in the case of a man who must conside=
r the small=20

economies of life.  Of course, no dinner call is made on the bachelor enter=
tainer. It is hardly worth=20

while to suggest that the women whom he has honored make a point of soon in=
viting him to their=20

homes. In this day there is little need to remind women of the attentions t=
hey may with propriety=20

pay to an eligible and unattached man.     CHAPTER XVIII  THE VISITOR   AN =
invitation to visit a=20

friend in her home must always be answered promptly. The invited person sho=
uld think seriously=20

before accepting such an invitation, and, unfortunately, one of the things =
she has to consider is her=20

wardrobe. If the hostess has a superb house, and the guest is to be one of =
many, all wealthy=20

except herself, all handsomely gowned except herself, and if she will feel =
like an English sparrow=20



in a flock of birds of paradise, she would better acknowledge the invitatio=
n, with gratitude, and stay=20

at home. If she does go, let her determine to make no apologies for her app=
earance, but to=20

accommodate herself to the ways of the household she visits.  One woman, vi=
siting in a=20

handsome home, was distressed to the point of weeping by the fact that, on =
her arrival, her=20

hostess=E2=80=99 maid came to the guest=E2=80=99s room and unpacked her tru=
nk for her, putting the contents in=20

bureau-drawers and wardrobe. It would have been better form if the visitor =
had taken what=20

seemed to her an innovation as a matter of course, and expressed neither ch=
agrin nor distress at=20

the kindly-meant and customary attention.  If, then, our invited person, af=
ter taking all things into=20

consideration, decides to accept the invitation sent her, let her state jus=
t when she is coming, and=20

go at that time. Of course she will make her plans agree with those of her =
future hostess. The=20

exact train should be named, and the schedule set must not be deviated from=
.         *       *       *=20

*       *  It may be said right here that no one should make a visit uninvi=
ted. Few persons would do=20

this,=E2=80=94but some few have been guilty of this breach of etiquette. On=
e need not always wait for an=20

invitation from an intimate friend, nor member of one=E2=80=99s family with=
 whom one can never be de trop,=20

but, even then, one should, by telegram or telephone, give notice of one=E2=
=80=99s coming. If I could, I=20

would make a rule that no one should pay an unexpected visit of several day=
s=E2=80=99 duration. If one=20

must go uninvited, one should give the prospective hosts ample notice of th=
e intended visit,=20

rt to the place for the=20

purpose of pulling a tooth from a skull, which they place on or over the ho=
le or stump of the grown=20

tooth, and they affirm that by keeping it there for a certain time the pain=
 ceases altogether. There=20

actised these two=20

remedies, and who tells me she knows several others who have done the same.=

 BE PROMPT AND DEFINITE]  When=20

a letter of invitation is accepted, the acceptance must not only be prompt,=
 but must clearly state=20

how long one intends to stay. It is embarrassing to a hostess not to know w=
hether her guest=20

means to remain a few days or many. As will be seen in the chapter on =E2=
=80=9CThe Visited,=E2=80=9D the hostess=20

can do much to obviate this uncertainty by asking a friend for a visit of a=
 specified length. But, in=20

accepting, the guest must also say how long she will remain.  An invitation=
 should be received=20

gratefully. In few things does breeding show more than in the manner of ack=
nowledging an=20

invitation to a friend=E2=80=99s house. She who asks another to be a member=
 of her household for even a=20

short time is paying the person asked the greatest honor it is in her power=
 to confer, and it should=20

be appreciated by the recipient. He who does not appreciate the honor=20
