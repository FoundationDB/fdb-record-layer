philodendron monstera intended to visit after I should have thoroughly explored the Settite. I made up my mind to have one more day in the neighbourhood of my present camp, and then to that one!"  "It was a great pity he took just that one."  Rosalia felt bound to defend her husband.  "How was he to know that?" she said. "He never had a reason for philodendron monstera intended to visit after I should have thoroughly explored the Settite. I made up my mind to have one more day in the neighbourhood of my present camp, and then to that one!"  "It was a great pity he took just that one."  Rosalia felt bound to defend her husband.  "How was he to know that?" she said. "He never had a reason for _
and tracker, Taher Noor, to divide among his people and the Tokrooris. This conduct was more 

improper, since the aggageers had become perfectly useless as elephant-hunters; they had ridden 

so recklessly upon unnecessary occasions, that all their horses were lamed, and, with the 

exception of Abou Do's, they were incapable of hunting. My three, having been well cared for, 

were in excellent condition. Abou Do coolly proposed that I should lend him my horses, which I of 

course refused, as I had a long journey before me; this led to disagreement, and I ordered him and 

his people to leave my camp, and return to Geera. During the time they had been with me, I had 

shot great numbers of animals, including large antelopes, buffaloes, elephants, &c.; and about 

twenty camel-loads of dried flesh, hides, fat, &c. had been transported to Geera as the Arabs' 

share of the spoils. They had also the largest share of ivory, and altogether they had never made 

so successful a hunting expedition. It was time to part; their horses being used shutting the door of 

the shop, she tripped across the yard with Gyuri to the ladder of the loft, and even wanted to go up 

with him herself.  "No, no, stay down below, Mrs. Muencz. What would the world say, if we two 

were to go up to the loft together?" said Gyuri jokingly.  Old Rosalia chuckled.  "Oh, dear heart 

alive!" she said, "there's no danger with me. Why, your father didn't even remember me in his will, 

though once upon a time ... (and here she complacently smoothed her gray hair). Well, my dear, 

please go up."  Gyuri Wibra searched about among the rubbish on the loft for quite half an hour, 

during which time the old woman came twice to the foot of the ladder to see if he were coming 

down. She was anxious about the fifty florins.  "Well?" she asked, as he appeared at last empty-

handed.  "I have looked through everything," he said, in a discouraged tone, "but the umbrella I 

want is not among the others."  The old Jewess looked disappointed.  "What can that tiresome 

Jonas have done with it?" she exclaimed. "Fifty

therefore I had concluded that it would be advisable to separate, to avoid a graver 

misunderstanding.  I warned them not to disturb my hunting-grounds by attempting to hunt during 

their journey, but they were to. ride straight home, which they could accomplish in four days, 

without baggage camels. This they promised to do, and we parted.  I was now without aggageers, 

as Taher Sheriff's party had disagreed with Abou Do some time before, and they were hunting on 

their own account on the banks of the florins! Dreadful! But he never had a reason for anything he 

did."  "In all probability your husband used that umbrella himself. Mr. Sztolarik of Besztercebanya 

says he distinctly remembers seeing him with it once."  "What was it like?"  "The stuff was red, 

with patches of all sorts on it, and it had a pale green border. The stick was of black wood, with a 

bone handle."  "May I never go to heaven!" exclaimed Rosalia, "if that was not the very umbrella 

he took with him last time he left home! Yes, I
