ld" is fifty-odd years. He has been married three times, and lives now with=
 his 50 year old wife.  In front of his shack is a huge, spreading oak tree=

iterally remove a mountain and cast it into the sea. But he had omitted an =
indispensable preliminary. He ought first to have exactly compared the bulk=
 of his faith with that of a grain of Palestinian mustard seed. Mr. Greg _
faced actual want of food, although his meals were plain. He ate mostly cor=
n meal and bacon, and=20

squash and potatoes, he adds "and every now and then we'd eat more than tha=
t." He doesn't=20

recall exactly what, but says it was "Oh, lots of greens and cabbage and sy=
rul, and sometimes=20

plenty of meat too."  His mother and the other women were given white cotto=
n--he thinks it may=20

have been duck--dresses "every now and then", he states, but none of the wo=
men really had to=20

confine themselves to white, "cause they'd dye 'em as soon as they'd get 'e=
m." For dye, he says=20

they would boil wild indigo, poke berries, walnuts and some tree for which =
he has an=20

undecipherable name.  Campbell's slaves did not have to go barefoot--not du=
ring the colder=20

months, anyway. As soon as winter would come, each one of them was given a =
pair of bright,=20

untanned leather "brogans," that would be the envy of the vicinity. Soap fo=
r the slaves was made=20

by the women of the plantation; by burning cockle-burrs, blackjack wood and=
 other materials, then=20

adding the accumulated fat of the past few weeks. For light they were given=
 tallow candles. Asked=20

if there was any certain time to put the candles out at night, Thomas answe=
rs that "Mr. Campbell=20

didn't care how late you stayed up at admit that there may be a certain dif=
ference of sentiment=20

behind. Mr. Greg describes the impressions to which I have given currency a=
s a confused=20

compound of natural sympathy, vague Christianity, and dim economic science.=
 Of the confusion,=20

vagueness and dimness of our views, of course we cannot be expected to be c=
onscious; but I own=20

that I defer, in these matters, not only to natural feeling, but to the eth=
ics of rational Christianity. I=20

still adhere to the Christian code for want of a better, the Utilitarian sy=
stem of morality being, so far=20

as I can see, no morality at all, in the ordinary sense of the term, as it =
makes no appeal to our=20

moral nature, our conscience, or whatever philosophers choose to call the d=
eepest part of=20

humanity. Of course, therefore, I accept as the fundamental principle of hu=
man relations, and of all=20

science concerning them, the great Christian doctrine that "we are every on=
e members one of=20

another" As a consequence of this doctrine I hold that the wealth of mankin=
d is morally a common=20

store; that we are morally bound to increase it as much, and to waste it as=
 little, as we can, that of=20

the two it is happier to be underpaid than to be overpaid; and that we shal=
l all find it so in the sum=20

of things. There is nothing in=20


_
daybreak."  The ex-slave doesn't remember any feathers in the covering for =
his pallet in the corner=20

of his cabin, but says that Mr. Campbell always provided the slaves with bl=
ankets and the women=20

with quilts.  By the time he was given his freedom, Thomas had learned seve=
ral trades in addition=20

to farming; one of them was carpentry. When he eventually left his $5 a mon=
th job with his master,=20

he began travelling over the state, a practice he has not discontinued unti=
l the present. He worked,=20

he says, "in such towns as Perry, Sarasota, Clearwater and every town in Fl=
orida down to where=20

the ocean goes under the bridge." (Probably Key West.)  He came to Jacksonv=
ille about what he=20

believes to be half a century ago. He remembers that it was "ever so long b=
efore the fire" (1901)=20

and "way back there when there wasn't but three families over here in South=
 Jacksonville: the=20

Sahds, the Hendricks and the Oaks. I worked for all of them, but I worked f=
or Mr. Bowden the=20

longest."  The reference is to R.L. Bowden, whom Thomas claims as one of pr=
operty, which the=20

founders of Christianity distinctly recognised in their teaching, and stren=
gthened practically by=20

raising the standard of integrity; nothing adverse to active industry or go=
od business habits;=20

nothing opposed to economic science as the study of the laws regulating the=
 production and=20

distribution of wealth; nothing condemnatory of pleasure, provided it be pl=
easure which opens the=20

heart, as I suppose was the case with the marriage feast at Cana, not the p=
leasure which closes=20

the heart, as I fear was the case with the "refined luxury" of the Marquis =
of Steyne.  If this is=20

superstition, all that I can say is that I have read Strauss, Renan, Mr. Gr=
eg on the "Creed of=20

Christendom," and all the eminent writers I could hear of on that side, and=
 that I am not conscious=20

of any bias to the side of orthodoxy, at least I have not given satisfactio=
n to the orthodox classes.=20

Christianity, of course, in common with other systems, craves a reasonable =
construction. Plato=20

cannot afford to have his apologues treated as=20
