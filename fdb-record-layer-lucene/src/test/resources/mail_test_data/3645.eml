philodendron monstera desolate moor, wild as the African Syrtes, without a =

 strange thing that from the _
to see sunset flame across the moors from this eastern borderland. Patches =
of cultivation, open=20

moorland dotted with sheep, lovely river-valleys, and wide undulations of h=
eather and gorse fade=20

into horizons of the westward summits. There is always the changeful charm =
of atmosphere. The=20

scene may be of vast, glorious peacefulness, but it is great also when ther=
e is the confusion of=20

cloud-strife, rain raking the hillsides--when the spirit of the moor is abr=
oad in storm and darkness,=20

when colour is quenched in wet and driving wrack. It is easy then to pictur=
e the moor as the=20

phantasmal haunt of lost races. Dartmoor has many moods, variable as the so=
ul of man--

sometimes of gentle pensiveness and dreaming, touched with sentiment, somet=
imes of fierce=20

striving passion or inconsolable woe, sometimes of desolation deepened to d=
espair. In all these=20

there is a quality of the unconventional and untamed, a sense of the nearne=
ss of mystery, the=20

brooding of the unseen, the force of powers that we sometimes feel to be in=
 profoundest sympathy=20

with our own longings and imaginings, sometimes in the most vexed antagonis=
m. Here, as=20

elsewhere, we find very much what we bring, but we find it intensified, viv=
ified; it may lure us as a=20

kindly home, or repel us as a desert. Even the repulsion has its own manner=
 of charm, because it=20

braces us to self-assertion and manhood.  It was from this Hey Tor side of =
the moorland that=20

William Howitt once looked forth upon Dartmoor. He tells us: "My road wound=
 up and up, the=20

heather and the bilberry on either hand shewing me that cultivation had nev=
er disturbed the soil=20

they grew in; and one sole woodlark from the far-ascending forest to the ri=
ght filled the wild=20

solitude with his autumnal note. At that moment I reached an eminence, and =
at once saw the dark=20

crags of Dartmoor high aloft before me, and one large solitary house in the=
 valley beneath the=20

woods. So fair, so silent, save for the woodlark's note and the moaning riv=
er, so unearthly did the=20

whole scene seem, that my imagination delighted to look upon it as an encha=
nted land, and to=20

persuade itself that that house stood as it would stand for ages, under the=
 spell of  'At the edge of=20

the brown corrie--near the sky-line. There are three of them--dinna ye see =
them?'  'No, I don't!' she=20

said impatiently.  'Do ye see the two sheep?'  'I see two white specks--I s=
uppose they're sheep.'=20

'Well--just above them.'  But the boat was slowly moving all this time; and=
 presently the gradual=20

change in their position brought one of the hinds clear into view on the sk=
y-line.  The beautiful=20

creature, with its graceful neck, small head, and upraised ears, was eviden=
tly watching them, but=20

with no apparent intention of making off; and presently Miss Carry, whose e=
yes were becoming=20

better accustomed to the place, could make out the other two hinds, one of =
them lying on the=20

grass, the other contentedly feeding, and paying no heed whatever to the pa=
ssing boat.  'I thought=20

you said the sheep drove them away,' she said to him.  'It's the men and th=
e dogs mostly,' he=20

answered.  'Sometimes they will come in among the sheep like that, if the f=
eeding tempts them.=20

My word, that would be an easy stalk now--if it was the season.'  Very soon=
 they found that the=20

three hinds were no longer in view; but there were plenty of other things t=
o claim their attention on=20

this solitary voyage.  What, for example, was this great circular mass of s=
tones standing on a=20

projecting promontory?  These were the remains, he explained to her, of a P=
ictish fort.  Another, in=20

better preservation, was on the opposite shore; and, if she cared to visit =
it, she might make her=20

way into the hollow passages constructed between the double line of wall, i=
f she were not afraid of=20

adders, nor yet of some of the uncemented stones falling upon her.  'And wh=
at are these?' she=20

said, indicating the ruins of certain circles formed on the hill-plateaux j=
ust above the loch.  'They're=20

down in the Ordnance Survey as "hut-circles,"' he said, 'but that is all I =
know about them.'  'At all=20



events, there must have been plenty of people living here at one time?'  'I=
 suppose so.'  'Well, I=20

don't think I ever saw any place in our country looking quite so lonely as =
that,' she said, regarding=20

the voiceless solitudes of wood and hill and crag.  'Seems as if with us th=
ere was always some=20


_
of death and change." This was written three-quarters of a century since, b=
efore nature had begun=20

greatly to inspire our prose writers; and for its period it is very credita=
ble. In poetry we have made=20

no progress; but in the prose literature of nature--that is to say, of natu=
ral scenes viewed under=20

human emotion--it is an immense step from the writings of William Gilpin an=
d Richard Warner, and=20

even of Howitt, to those of George Borrow and Richard Jefferies. Even in pr=
ose it had been the=20

poets, Gray and Wordsworth, who had shown the way, very slowly followed. Wa=
rner was an=20

enterprising and intelligent traveller, and visited many parts of the south=
 and west from his Bath=20

home, long before the time of railways. It is interesting to notice how he =
was daunted by Dartmoor.=20

Overnight he had decided to walk from Lydford to around--camping out, or so=
mething--but I dare=20

say in Dacotah or Idaho you would get lonelier places than this even.  Well=
, now, what do they call=20

it?' she asked, as an afterthought.  'What?--the strath here?'  'Yes.'  'I =
suppose they would call it=20

part of Strath-Naver.'  The mere mention of Strath-Naver struck a chill to =
her heart.  It recalled to=20

her how she had betrayed him by sending those harmless verses across the At=
lantic, and=20

subjecting them to the insolence of a nincompoop's patronage. And if Ronald=
 should ever get to=20

know?  Might not some busybody send him a copy of the paper?  These Scotch =
people had so=20

many relatives and friends all through the States.  Or perhaps his brother =
in Glasgow might have=20

some correspondent over there?  She dared not look him in the face, she fel=
t so guilty; and once=20

or twice she=20
