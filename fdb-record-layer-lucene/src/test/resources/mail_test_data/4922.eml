"  Neither Captain Scott nor Felix was disposed to argue the question, and =
they said nothing. Early in the morning the work of preparation began with =
the removal of everything heavy from the Maud that was not a fixture. She w=
as a large steam-launch to be hoisted on the deck of a steamer no larger th=
an the Guardian-Mother; but the task was satisfactorily _
half-hour.  Later, when he went to his offices in the Temple Court Building=
, the strenuosities=20

reasserted themselves with emphasis. Though he found his desk closed, and w=
as reasonably=20

certain that he had in his pocket the only key that would unlock it, he fou=
nd his papers scattered in=20

confusion under the roll-top. A touch upon the electric button brought the =
stenographer from the=20

anteroom.  "Who's been into my desk, Collins?" he demanded, pointing to the=
 confusion and=20

scrutinizing the face of the young man sharply for signs of guilt.  "Goodne=
ss gracious! How could=20

anybody get into it when you've got the only key, Mr. Blount?" stammered th=
e clerk. Then he went=20

on, parrot-like: "I've been putting the letters and telegrams through the l=
etter-slit, as you told me to,=20

and I've kept the private office locked."  "Nevertheless it is very evident=
 that somebody has been=20

here," said Blount. Then he had a sudden shock and wheeled shortly upon the=
 stenographer.=20

"Collins, what did you do with that packet of papers I gave you last Monday=
--the one I told you to=20

put away in the safe?"  "I did just what you told me to; put it in the inne=
r cash-box, and put the key=20

of the cash-box on your desk. Didn't you get it?"  Blount felt in his pocke=
ts and found the key,=20

which the morning the passengers heard an unusual sound of activity on the =
part of the ship's=20

company. The captain had given orders the night before to have everything m=
ade ready for=20

hoisting on deck the Maud. He had announced his intention to the "Big Four"=
 in his cabin, and=20

given his reasons for his decision. Scott and Felix regretted this change i=
n the programme of the=20

voyage more than the other two.  "The Red Sea is sometimes a very stormy pl=
ace," said the=20

commander. "I have feared more than anything else when you have been sailin=
g in the Maud that=20

she might get separated from the ship in a fog, or in some other manner, an=
d that the little steamer=20

might come to grief, however well she might be handled; for she certainly i=
s not large enough for=20

an independent voyage.  "In the very last paper I received from New York, I=
 read of a new steam-

yacht to be built by a millionaire for the voyage around the world which ha=
s lately become the fad=20

of millionaires. One item struck my attention; that she was to be armed wit=
h four cannon whose=20

calibre was not given, as well as with a supply of small arms. The wealthy =
voyager was afraid of=20

pirates, or some other freebooters on the Malabar and Malay coasts, as well=
 as among the islands=20

of the Indian Ocean and those of=20


_
Collins. "Go and get that packet and bring it to me," he directed. The shoc=
k was beginning to=20

subside a little by now, and he sat down to bring something like order out =
of the confusion on the=20

desk. At first, he had thought that the sheaf of evidence letters which gav=
e him the strangle-hold=20

upon Gantry and the lawbreakers had been left in a pigeonhole of the desk. =
Then he remembered=20

having given it to Collins to put away.  A minute or two later it occurred =
to him that the=20

stenographer was taking a long time for a short errand. Rising silently, he=
 crossed the room and=20

reached for the knob of the door of communication. In the act he saw that t=
he door was ajar, and=20

through the crack he saw Collins standing before the opened safe. The clerk=
 was running his=20

tongue along the flap of a large envelope, preparatory to sealing it. Bloun=
t's first  "As you are=20

aware, I took the same precautions myself; and I only regret now that I did=
 not take on board more=20

guns and small arms. We have had occasion to use our twelve-pounders on one=
 occasion, and=20

perhaps, if the ship had reached the coast of Cyprus at the time I expected=
, I might have found=20

them useful. I do not anticipate any trouble from native pirates wherever w=
e may go; but I think the=20

Maud is a temptation to Arabs and other natives.  "In 1882 Edward Henry Pal=
mer, an Englishman,=20

while on a peaceful mission with two officers of the British service, was m=
urdered by the natives,=20

with his two companions, near Suez, but on the other side of the gulf. If I=
 were sure that the ship=20

could always be near enough to defend the little steamer if attacked, I sho=
uld feel different about it.=20

Then we are liable to encounter fearful storms,=20
