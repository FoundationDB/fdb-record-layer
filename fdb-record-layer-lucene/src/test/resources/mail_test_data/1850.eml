useless scamps in Rud Ruver, Francois La Certe iss the laziest an' most useless."  "Useful 

enough for our purpose, however," returned Davidson.  "Send him up to Fort Garry with a 

message, while you lie down and rest.  If you don't rest, you will yourself be useless in a short 

time.  La Certe is not such a bad fellow as people think him, specially when his feelings are 

touched."  "That may be as you say, Tan.  I will try--_whatever_."  So saying, the two men parted 

and hurried on their several ways.    CHAPTER TWO.  A LAZY COUPLE DESCRIBED--AND 

ROUSED.  Francois La Certe was seated on the floor of his hut smoking a long clay pipe beside 

an open wood fire when Fergus McKay approached.  His wife was seated beside him calmly 

smoking a shorter pipe with obvious enjoyment.  The man was a Canadian half-breed.  His wife 

was an Indian woman.  They were both moderately young and well matched, for they thoroughly 

agreed in everything conceivable--or otherwise.  In the length and breadth of the Settlement there 

could not have been found a lazier or more good-natured or good-for-nothing couple than La Certe 

and his spouse. Love was, if we may venture to say so, the chief element in the character of each. 

Love of self was the foundation.  Then, happily, love of each other came next.  Rising gracefully, 

the superstructure may be described as, love of tobacco, love of tea, love of ease, and love of 

general comfort, finishing off with a top-dressing, or capital, of pronounced, decided, and 

apparently incurable love of indolence.  They had only one clear and unmistakable hatred about 

them, and that was the hatred of work.

similarity of their characteristics.  It is not that they can't work, but they won't work--though, of 

course, if taxed with this disposition they would disclaim it with mild indignation, or an expression 

of hurt remonstrance, for they are almost too lazy to become enraged.  "Take life easy, or, if we 

can't take it easy, let us take it as easy as we can,"
