philodendron monstera have passed to posterity under the name of "divine mi=

discipline in order to become a Theurgist, where there is no regular initia=

Y., 15) the Court said, p. 24:  =E2=80=9CIn the first place I doubt much wh=
ether the defendant below, after retaining the plaintiff as a physician and=
 accepting his services as such, could call upon him in the first instance =
to prove a regular license. In other like cases, the _
Great, a third Joan of Arc, and who or what not? This is a matter of inner =
conviction, and is based=20

on more or less familiarity with Occultism and belief in the modern theory =
of reincarnation. The=20

latter differs from the one genuine doctrine of old, as will be shown, but =
there is no rule without its=20

exception.  As to the Magus being "one with God the Father, God the Son, an=
d God the Holy=20

Ghost," this again is quite reasonable, if we admit that a Mystic and Seer =
has a right to use=20

allegorical language; and in this case, moreover, it is quite justified by =
the doctrine of Universal=20

Unity taught in Esoteric Philosophy. Every Occultist will say the same, on =
(to him) scientific and=20

logical grounds, in full accordance with the doctrine he professes. Not a V=
edantin but says the=20

same thing daily: he is, of course, Brahman, and he is Parabrahman, once th=
at he rejects the=20

individuality of his personal spirit, and recognises the Divine Ray which d=
wells in his Higher Self as=20

only a reflection of the Universal Spirit. This is the echo in all times an=
d ages of the primitive=20

doctrine of Emanations. The first Emanation from the Unknown is the "Father=
," the second the=20

"Son," and all and everything proceeds from the One, or that Divine Spirit =
which is "unknowable."=20

Hence, the assertion that by her (Sophia, or Minerva, the Divine Wisdom) he=
 (Simon), when yet in=20

the bosom of the Father, himself the Father (or the first collective Emanat=
ion), begot the=20

Archangels--the "Son"--who were the creators of this world.  The Roman Cath=
olics themselves,=20

driven to the wall by the irrefutable arguments of their opponents--the lea=
rned Philologists and=20

Symbologists who pick to shreds Church dogmas and their authorities, and po=
int out the plurality=20

of the Elohim in the _Bible_--admit to-day that the first "creation" of God=
, the Tsaba, or=20

Archangels, must have participated in the creation of the Universe. Might n=
ot we suppose:=20

Although "God alone created the heaven and the earth" ... that     however =
unconnected they [the=20

Angels] may have been with the     primordial _ex nihilo_ creation, they ma=
y have received a=20

mission     to achieve, to continue, and to sustain it?(201)   exclaims De =
Mirville, in answer to=20

Renan, Lacour, Maury and the _tutti quanti_ of the French Institute. With c=
ertain alterations it is=20

precisely this which is claimed by the Secret Doctrine. In truth there is n=
ot a single doctrine=20

preached by the many Reformers of the first and the subsequent centuries of=
 our era, that did not=20

base its initial teachings on this universal cosmogony. Consult Mosheim and=
 see what he has to=20

say of the many "heresies" he describes. Cerinthus, the Jew,       Taught t=
hat the Creator of this=20

world ... the Sovereign God of the     Jewish people, was a Being ... who d=
erived his birth from the=20

Supreme God;   that this Being, moreover,       Fell by degrees from his na=
tive virtue and primitive=20

dignity.   Basilides, Carpocrates and Valentinus, the Egyptian Gnostics of =
the second century, held=20

the same ideas with a few variations. Basilides preached seven AEons (Hosts=
 or Archangels), who=20

issued from the substance of the Supreme. Two of them, Power and Wisdom, be=
got the heavenly=20

hierarchy of the first class and dignity; this emanated a second; the latte=
r a third, and so on; each=20

subsequent evolution being of a nature less exalted than the precedent, and=
 each creating for=20

itself a Heaven as a dwelling, the nature of each of these respective Heave=
ns decreasing in=20

splendour and purity as it approached nearer to the earth. Thus the number =
of these Dwellings=20

amounted to 365; and over all presided the Supreme Unknown called Abraxas, =
a name which in=20

the Greek method of numeration yields the number 365, which in its mystic a=
nd numerical=20

meaning contains the number 355, or the man value.(202) This was a Gnostic =
Mystery based=20

_
Saturnilus of Antioch promulgated the same doctrine slightly modified. He t=
aught two eternal=20

principles, Good and Evil, which are simply Spirit and Matter. The seven An=
gels who preside over=20

the seven Planets are the Builders of our Universe--a purely Eastern doctri=
ne, as Saturnilus was=20

an Asiatic Gnostic. These Angels are the natural Guardians of the seven Reg=
ions of our Planetary=20

System, one of the most powerful among these seven creating Angels of the _=
third_ order being=20

"Saturn," the presiding genius of the Planet, and the God of the Hebrew peo=
ple: namely, Jehovah,=20

who was venerated among the Jews, and to whom they dedicated the seventh da=
y or Sabbath,=20

Saturday--"Saturn's day" among the Scandinavians and also among the Hindus.=
  Marcion, who=20

also held the doctrine of the two opposed principles of Good and Evil, asse=
rted that there was a=20

third Deity between the two--one of a "mixed nature"--the God of the Jews, =
the Creator (with his=20

Host) of the lower, or our, World. Though ever at war with the Evil Princip=
le, this intermediate=20

Being was nevertheless also opposed to the Good Principle, whose place and =
title he coveted.=20

Thus Simon was only the son of his time, a religious Reformer like so many =
others, and an Adept=20

among the Kabalists. The Church, to which a belief in his actual existence =
and great powers is a=20

necessity--in order the better to set off the "miracle" performed by Peter =
and his triumph over=20

Simon--extols unstintingly his wonderful magic feats. On the other hand, Sc=
epticism, represented=20

by scholars and learned critics, tries to make away with him altogether. Th=
us, after denying the=20

very existence of Simon, they have finally thought fit to merge his individ=
uality entirely in that of=20

Paul. The anonymous author of _Supernatural Religion_ assiduously endeavour=
ed to prove that=20

by Simon Magus we must understand the Apostle Paul, whose _Epistles_ were s=
ecretly as well as=20

openly calumniated and opposed by Peter, and charged with containing "dysno=
etic learning."=20

Indeed this seems more than probable when we think of the two Apostles and =
contrast their=20

characters.       The Apostle of the Gentiles was brave, outspoken, sincere=
, and     very learned;=20

the Apostle of Circumcision, cowardly, cautious,     insincere, and very ig=
norant. That Paul had=20

been, partially at     least, if not completely, initiated into the theurgi=
c mysteries,     admits of little=20

doubt. His language, the phraseology so peculiar     to the Greek philosoph=
ers, certain=20

expressions used only by the     Initiates, are so many sure ear-marks to t=
hat supposition. Our=20

suspicion has been strengthened by an able article entitled "Paul     and P=
lato," by Dr. A. Wilder, in=20

which the author puts forward one     remarkable and, for us, very precious=
 observation. In the=20

_Epistles to the Corinthians_, he shows Paul abounding with     "expression=
s suggested by the=20

initiations of Sabazius and Eleusis,     and the lectures of the (Greek) ph=
ilosophers. He (Paul)=20

designates     himself an _idiotes_--a person unskilful in the Word, but no=
t in     the _gnosis_ or=20

philosophical learning. 'We speak wisdom among the     perfect or regretted=

statute (Laws of 1844, p. 406): =E2=80=9CThe triumph was now complete, for =
the legislature had made=20

ow be safely=20

prescribed, and payments therefor exacted by authority of law.=E2=80=9D  [1=

ase by rubbing,=20

kneading, pressing, and otherwise manipulating the body (massage) is not li=
able for having=20

violated the provisions of the statute against practising medicine or surge=
ry without a license.=20

Smith _v._ Lane, 24 Hun (New York Supreme Court), 32.  [156] Analysis of th=
is decision shows=20

that the main ground, upon which the court of last resort sustained the rig=
ht of the applicant for=20

admission to be admitted as a member of the society, was, that the provisio=
ns of the by-law in=20

question were not specifically made applicable to a person applying for mem=
bership. The Court=20

observed, pp. 192 _et seq._: =E2=80=9CThe regulations embodied in the so-ca=
lled code are admirably=20

framed, and commend themselves to every reader, as tending to raise to a st=
ill higher elevation=20

the character of the learned and honorable profession to which they were su=
bmitted for approval=20

and adoption. They are not limited in their scope to the range of moral obl=
igation, but embrace=20

express rules of conduct, in personal, professional, and public relations. =
They are regulations in=20

the various departments of morals and manners, of courtesy and etiquette, o=
f delicacy and honor.=20

They bind those who pledge=20


_
the wisdom of this world, nor of the Archons of this world, but     divine =
wisdom in a mystery,=20

secret--which _none of the Archons of     this world knew_.' "(203)      Wh=
at else can the Apostle=20

mean by those unequivocal words, but     that he himself, as belonging to t=
he Mystae (Initiated),=20

spoke of     things shown and explained only in the Mysteries? The "divine =
    wisdom in a mystery=20

which none of the _Archons of this world     knew_," has evidently some dir=
ect reference to the=20

Basileus of the     Eleusinian Initiation who did know. The Basileus belong=
ed to the     staff of the=20

great Hierophant, and was an Archon of Athens; and as     such was one of t=
he chief Mystae,=20

belonging to the _interior_     Mysteries, to which a very select and small=
 number obtained an=20

entrance.(204) The magistrates supervising the Eleusinia were     called Ar=
chons.(205)   We will=20

deal, however, first with Simon the Magician.      SECTION XIV. SIMON AND H=
IS BIOGRAPHER=20

HIPPOLYTUS.   As shown in our earlier volumes, Simon was a pupil of the Tan=
aim of Samaria,=20

and the reputation he left behind him, together with the title of "the Grea=
t Power of God," testify in=20

favour of the ability and learning of his Masters. But the Tanaim were Kaba=
lists of the same secret=20

school as John of the _Apocalypse_, whose careful aim it was to conceal as =
much as possible the=20

real meaning of the names in the Mosaic Books. Still the calumnies so jealo=
usly disseminated=20

against Simon Magus by the unknown authors and compilers of the _Acts_ and =
other writings,=20

could not cripple the truth to such an extent as to conceal the fact that n=
o Christian could rival him=20

in thaumaturgic deeds. The story told about his falling during an aerial fl=
ight, breaking both his legs=20

and then committing suicide, is ridiculous. Posterity has heard but one sid=
e of the story. Were the=20

disciples of Simon to have a chance, we might perhaps find that it was Pete=
r who broke both his=20

legs. But as against this hypothesis we know that this Apostle was too prud=
ent ever to venture=20

himself in Rome. On the confession of several ecclesiastical writers, no Ap=
ostle ever performed=20

such "supernatural wonders," but of course pious people will say this only =
the more proves that it=20

was the Devil who worked through Simon. He was accused of blasphemy against=
 the Holy Ghost,=20

only because he introduced as the "Holy Spiritus" the Mens (Intelligence) o=
r "the Mother of all."=20

But we find the same expression used in the _Book of Enoch_, in which, in c=
ontradistinction to the=20

"Son of Man," he speaks of the "Son of the Woman." In the _Codex_ of the Na=
zarenes, and in the=20

_Zohar_, as well as in the _Books of Hermes_, the same expression is used; =
and even in the=20

apocryphal _Evangelium of the Hebrews_ we read that Jesus admitted the fema=
le sex of the=20

observance, but cannot be recognized in law, as conditions precedent to the=
 exercise of an=20

honorable profession, by learned, able, and upright men, who have not agree=
d to abide by them.=20

The non-observance of such regulations _may be made_ cause for exclusion or=
 disfranchisement;=20

but it must be either by the agreement of parties or by the exercise of the=
 law-making power.  =E2=80=9CThe=20

applicant was not a member either of the American Medical Association or of=
 the Erie County=20

Medical Society, at the time of his alleged deviation from the formulas pre=
scribed by these=20

conventional rules. He was under no legal obligation to observe them, and h=
ad neither actual nor=20

constructive notice of their existence. Those who were _members_ of the soc=
iety could not=20

lawfully be expelled for _antecedent_ deviation from the code (Fawcett _v._=
 Charles, 13 Wend.,=20

477). Much less could such deviation be alleged, as cause for exclusion, ag=
ainst one who had=20

never agreed to be bound by it, and as to whom it was not merely an inopera=
tive but an unknown=20

law.  =E2=80=9CAs the relator demanded admission to the enjoyment of a fran=
chise to which he was=20

presumptively entitled, his exclusion could be justified only by facts repe=
lling the presumption that=20



he was duly qualified for admission, or by extraneous facts, showing that, =
if his application was=20

granted, there were then subsisting causes, making =E2=80=98a clear case=E2=
=80=99 for immediate expulsion (_Ex=20

parte_ Paine, 1 Hill, 665).  =E2=80=9CThe burden was upon the appellant to =
establish affirmatively the=20

existence of such present cause for expulsion. The society waived the right=
 of making a return and=20

taking a formal issue on the claim of the relator, to be determined as matt=
er of fact by a jury, under=20

the direction of the court; but submitted its objections in the form of aff=
idavits, which failed to=20

establish cause either for exclusion or expulsion.  =E2=80=9CThe only _spec=
ific fact_ alleged in the opposing=20

affidavits, as ground of objection, was the publication by the relator of a=
 professional=20

advertisement, which was inserted in one or more of the Buffalo journals in=
 May, 1855, and=20

discontinued in January, 1857, more than two years before his application w=
as presented. It is=20

charged that the printing of this notice was an empiricism, and in conflict=
 with the code of ethics=20

adopted by the Erie County Medical Society.  =E2=80=9CThere is nothing in t=
he terms of the advertisement=20

from which any inference can justly be drawn against the relator, in respec=
t either to his personal=20

character or his professional skill. There is no suggestion, in the affidav=
its, that any of the=20

statements of fact contained in the notice are untrue, and there is nothing=
 in its contents=20

inconsistent with perfect good faith on the part of the relator. It refers =
to the treatment of bronchitis,=20

asthma, and=20


_
Pneuma."  After long ages of denial, however, the actual existence of Simon=
 Magus has been=20

finally demonstrated, whether he was Saul, Paul or Simon. A manuscript spea=
king of him under=20

the last name has been discovered in Greece and has put a stop to any furth=
er speculation.  In his=20

_Histoire des Trois Premiers Siecles de l'Eglise_(206) M. de Pressense give=
s his opinion on this=20

additional relic of early Christianity. Owing to the numerous myths with wh=
ich the history of Simon=20

abounds--he says--many Theologians (among Protestants, he ought to have add=
ed) have=20

concluded that it was no had directed his particular attention; and it allu=
des to his use of the=20

method recently introduced, of medicated inhalation, through an instrument =
appropriate to that=20

purpose, in aid of such general treatment as experience had proved to be be=
neficial in that class=20

of diseases. It is not denied that the relator possessed peculiar skill in =
this department of the=20

profession; and the case discloses the fact that the method of auxiliary tr=
eatment, introduced by=20

him in the county of Erie, was not only successful in his own practice, but=
 was adopted, with=20

beneficial results, by members of=20


_
legends. But he adds:       It contains positive facts, it seems, now warra=
nted by the     unanimous=20

testimony of the Fathers of the Church and the narrative     of Hippolytus =
recently discovered.(207)=20

This MS. is very far from being complimentary to the alleged founder of Wes=
tern Gnosticism.=20

While recognising great powers in Simon, it brands him as a priest of Satan=
--which is quite enough=20

to show that it was written by a Christian. It also shows that, like anothe=
r "servant of the Evil One"-

-as Manes is called by the Church--Simon was a _baptised_ of high professio=
nal standing, and=20

that it was accepted by a large proportion of the physicians of Western New=
 York. If, at the time=20

this remedy was introduced, he had been a member of the County Society or o=
f the American=20

Medical Association, he would not have been at liberty to direct attention,=
 through the medium of=20

the public journals, to the benefits resulting from its use. This would, pe=
rhaps, have been=20

unfortunate for those who were suffering, in that vicinity, from this parti=
cular class of diseases; but=20

it is undoubtedly true that the suppression=20


_
both, being too well versed in the mysteries of true _primitive_ Christiani=
ty, were persecuted for it.=20

The secret of such persecution was then, as it is now, quite transparent to=
 those who study the=20

question impartially. Seeking to preserve his independence, Simon could not=
 submit to the=20

leadership or authority of any of the Apostles, least of all to that of eit=
her Peter or John, the=20

fanatical author of the _Apocalypse_. Hence charges of heresy followed by "=
anathema=20

maranatha." The persecutions by the Church were never directed against Magi=
c, when it was=20

orthodox; for the new Theurgy, established and regulated by the Fathers, no=
w known to=20

Christendom as "grace" and "miracles," was, and is still, when it does happ=
en, only Magic--

whether conscious or unconscious. Such toward his professional brethren, an=
d more in=20

accordance with the rules of delicacy and good taste. But an error, in this=
 respect, by one who had=20

no notice of the society regulation is not cause for disfranchisement. The =
act of the relator was=20

neither immoral nor illegal. It was no violation of the by-laws; for, as to=
 him, they were wholly=20

inoperative. It was no present cause for _exclusion_; for the publication o=
f the objectionable notice=20

had been discontinued for more than two years. When he applied for admissio=
n, he proposed to=20

become bound by the by-laws; and this the society refused to permit, for th=
e sole cause that he=20

had not observed them before they became rules of conduct for him. =E2=80=
=98Where there is no law, there=20

is no transgression.=E2=80=99 The relator, therefore, had=20
