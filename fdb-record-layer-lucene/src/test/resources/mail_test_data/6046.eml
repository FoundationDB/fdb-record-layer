that despite its age and the fact that County authorities have permitted it=

deterierate to an almost impassable sand at some seasons, there is no mista=
king the fact that this=20

was once a major thoroughfare.  The region that stretches from Green Cove S=

tted with lakes,=20

creeks, and even a river; few of the lakes and none of the other bodies sti=

for fancy balls. The power of the chiefs and the substance of the clan syst=

 clansmen, and is=20

prized, like the dress, as a remnant of social picturesqueness in a prosaic=

Of all the lines of division in Great Britain, the most important political=
