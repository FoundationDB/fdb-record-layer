security the hippopotami retreated after their nocturnal rambles upon terra=
 firma. The banks of this=20

beautiful river were generally thickly clothed with bright green nabbuk tre=
es, that formed a shelter=20

for INNUMERABLE guinea-fowl, and the black francolin partridge. Herds of an=
telopes of many=20

varieties were forced to the river to drink, as the only water within many =
miles; but these never=20

remained long among the thick nabbuk, as the lions and leopards inhabited t=
hat covert expressly=20

to spring upon the unwary animal whose thirst prompted a too heedless advan=
ce. Wherever there=20

was a sand bank in the river, a crocodile basked in the morning sunshine: s=
ome of these were of=20

enormous size.  Hippopotami had trodden a path along the margin of the rive=
r, as these animals=20

came out to feed shortly after dark, and travelled from pool to pool. Where=
ver a plot of tangled and=20

succulent herbage grew among the shady nabbuks, there were the marks of the=
 harrow-like teeth,=20

that had torn and rooted up the rank grass like an agricultural implement. =
 After walking about two=20

miles, we noticed a herd of hippopotami in a pool below a rapid: this was s=
urrounded by rocks,=20

except upon one side, where the rush of water had thrown up a bank of pebbl=
es and sand. Our old=20

Neptune did not condescend to bestow the slightest attention when I pointed=
 out these animals;=20

they were too wide awake; but he immediately quitted the river's bed, and w=
e followed him quietly=20

behind the fringe of bushes upon the border, from which we carefully examin=
ed the water. About=20

half a mile below this spot, as we clambered over the intervening rocks thr=
ough a gorge which=20

formed a powerful rapid, I observed, in a small pool just below the rapid, =
an immense head of a=20

hippopotamus close to a perpendicular rock that formed a wall to the river,=
 about six feet above=20

the surface. I pointed out the hippo to old Abou Do, who had not seen it. A=
t once the gravity of the=20

old Arab disappeared, and the energy of the hunter was exhibited as he moti=
oned us to remain,=20

while he ran nimbly behind the thick screen of bushes for about a hundred a=
nd fifty yards below=20

the spot where the hippo was unconsciously basking, with his ugly head abov=
e the surface.=20

Plunging into the rapid torrent, the veteran hunter was carried some distan=
ce down the stream, but=20

breasting the powerful current, he landed upon the rocks on the opposite si=
de, and retiring to=20

some distance from the river, he quickly advanced towards the spot beneath =
which the=20

hippopotamus was lying. I had a fine view of the scene, as I was lying conc=
ealed exactly opposite=20

the hippo, who had disappeared beneath the water. Abou Do now stealthily ap=
proached the ledge=20

of rock beneath which he had expected to see the head of the animal; his lo=
ng sinewy arm was=20

raised, with the harpoon ready to strike, as he carefully advanced. At leng=
th he reached the edge=20

of the perpendicular rock; the hippo had vanished, but, far from exhibiting=
 surprise, the old Arab=20

remained standing on the sharp ledge, unchanged in attitude. No figure of b=
ronze could have been=20

more rigid than that of the old river-king, as he stood erect upon the rock=
 with the left foot=20

advanced, and the harpoon poised in his ready right hand above his head, wh=
ile in the left he held=20

the loose coils of rope attached to the ambatch buoy. For about three minut=
es he stood like a=20

statue, gazing intently into the clear and deep water beneath his feet. I w=
atched eagerly for the=20

reappearance of the hippo; the surface of the water was still barren, when =
suddenly the right arm=20

of the statue descended like lightning, and the harpoon shot perpendicularl=
y into the pool with the=20

speed of an arrow. What river-fiend answered to the summons? In an instant =
an enormous pair of=20

open jaws appeared, followed by the ungainly head and form of the furious h=
ippopotamus, who,=20

springing half out of the water, lashed the river into foam, and, disdainin=
g the concealment of the=20

deep pool, he charged straight up the violent rapids. With extraordinary po=
wer he breasted the=20



descending stream; gaining a footing in the rapids, about five feet deep, h=
e ploughed his way=20

against the broken waves, sending them in showers of spray upon all sides, =
and upon gaining=20

broader shallows he tore along through the water, with the buoyant float ho=
pping behind him along=20

the surface, until he landed from the river, started at full gallop along t=
he dry shingly bed, and at=20

length disappeared in the thorny nabbuk jungle.  I never could have imagine=
d that so unwieldy an=20

animal could have "I have had to teach very ordinary minds all my life, and=
 have wasted my=20

talents on them. A sad thing to say, sir. I feel like that nugget of gold w=
hich was lost at the Mint.=20

You know the tale, sir? What, you have never heard it? Why, a large nugget =
of gold was once lost=20

at the Mint. It was searched for everywhere, but could not be found. Well, =
after a long examination=20

of all the clerks, it turned out that the gold had been melted by accident =
with the copper for the=20

kreutzers. You understand me, sir? I have been pouring my soul into two or =
three generations of=20

fools, but, thank goodness, I have at last found a worthy recipient for my =
knowledge. Of course,=20

you understand me, sir?"  But Pal Gregorics needed no spurring on in this c=
ase; he had fixed=20

intentions as far as the boy was concerned, and folks were not far wrong wh=
en they (mostly in=20

order to vex the other Gregorics) prophesied the end would be that Gregoric=
s would marry Anna=20

Wibra, and adopt her boy. Kupeczky himself often said:  "Yes, that will be =
the end of it. Who will=20

bet with me?"  It would have been the end, and the correct way too, for Gre=
gorics was fond=20

enough of the boy to do a correct thing for once in a way. But two things h=
appened to prevent the=20

carrying out of this plan. First of all Anna fell from a ladder and broke h=
er leg, so that she limped all=20

her life after, and who wants a lame wife?  The second thing was, that litt=
le Gyuri was taken ill very=20

suddenly. He turned blue in the face and was in convulsions; they thought h=
e would die. Gregorics=20

fell on his knees by the side of the bed of the sick child, kissed his face=
 and cold little hands, and=20

asked despairingly:  "What is the matter, my boy? Tell me what hurts you." =
 "I don't know, uncle,"=20

moaned the child.  At that moment Gregorics suffered every pain the child f=
elt, and his heart=20

seemed breaking. He seized hold of the doctor's hand, and his agony pressed=
 these words from=20

him:  "Doctor, save the child, and I'll give you a bag full of gold."  The =
doctor saved him, and got=20

the bag of money too, as Gregorics had promised in that hour of danger. (Of=
 course the doctor did=20

not choose the bag, Gregorics had one made on purpose.)  The doctor cured t=
he boy, but made=20

Gregorics ill, for he instilled suspicion into his mind by swearing that th=
e boy's illness was the=20

result of poison. Nothing could have upset Gregorics as much as this declar=
ation. How could it=20

have happened? Had he eaten any poisonous mushrooms? Gyuri shook his head. =
Well, what=20

could he have eaten?  The mother racked her brains to find out what could h=
ave been the cause.=20

Perhaps this, perhaps that, perhaps the vinegar was bad, or the copper sauc=
epans had not been=20

quite clean? Gregorics shook his head sorrowfully.  "Don't talk nonsense, A=
nna," he said.  Deep=20

down in his heart was a thought which he was afraid to put into words, but =
which entirely spoiled=20

his life for him, and robbed him of sleep and appetite. He had thought of h=
is step-brothers; they=20

had something to do with it, he was sure. There was an end to all his plans=
 for adopting the boy,=20

giving him his own name, and leaving him his fortune. No, no, it would cost=
 Gyuri his life; they=20

would kill him if he gave them the chance. But he did not intend to give th=
em the chance. He=20

trembled for the child, and hardly dared to love him. He started a new line=
 of conduct, a very mad=20

one too. He ordered the boy to address him as "sir" for the future, and for=
bade him to love him.  "It=20

was only a bit of fun, you know, my allowing you to call me 'uncle.' Do you=
 understand?"  Tears=20



stood in the boy's eyes, and seeing them old Gregorics bent down and kissed=
 them away; and his=20

voice was very sad as he said:  "Don't tell any one I kissed you, or you wi=
ll be in great danger."=20

Precaution now became his mania. He took Kupeczky into his house, and the o=
ld professor had to=20

be with the boy day and night, and taste every bit of food he was to eat. I=
f Gyuri went outside the=20

gates, he was first stripped of his velvet suit and patent leather shoes, a=
nd dressed in a ragged old=20

suit kept on purpose, and allowed to run barefoot. Let people ask in the st=
reets, "Who is that little=20

scarecrow?" And let those who knew answer, "Oh, that is Gregorics's cook's =
child."  And, in order=20

thoroughly to deceive his relations, he undertook to educate one of his ste=
p-sister's boys; took him=20

up to Vienna and put him in the Terezianum, and kept him there in grand sty=
le with the sons of=20

counts and barons. To his other nephews and nieces he sent lots of presents=
, so that the=20


_
and it was fortunate for our old Neptune that he was secure upon the high l=
edge of rock, for if he=20

had been in the path of the infuriated beast. there would have been an end =
of Abou Do. The old=20

man plunged into the deep pool just quitted by the hippo, and landed upon o=
ur side; while in the=20

enthusiasm of the moment I waved my cap above my head, and gave him a Briti=
sh cheer as he=20

reached the shore. His usually stern features relaxed into a grim smile of =
delight: this was one of=20

those moments when the gratified pride of the hunter rewards him for any ri=
sks. I congratulated=20

him upon his dexterity: but much remained to be done. I proposed to cross t=
he river, and to follow=20

upon the tracks of the hippopotamus, as I imagined that the buoy and rope w=
ould catch in the thick=20

jungle, and that we should find him entangled in the bush; but the old hunt=
er gently laid his hand=20

upon my arm, and pointed up the bed brother, came at last to the conclusion=
 that he was not such=20

a bad fellow after all, only something of a fool.  Little Gyuri himself was=
 sent away to school after a=20

time; to Kolozsvar and then to Szeged, as far away as possible, so as to be=
 out of reach of the=20

family. At these times Kupeczky secretly disappeared from the town too, tho=
ugh he might as well=20

have been accompanied by a drum and fife band, for not a soul would have as=
ked where he was=20

going.  Doubtless there was a lot of exaggeration in all this secrecy and p=
recaution, but=20

exaggeration had a large share in Gregorics's character. If he undertook so=
mething very difficult=20

he was more adventurous than the devil himself, and once his fear was overc=
ome, he saw hope in=20

every corner. His love for the child and his fear were both exaggerated, bu=
t he could not help it.=20

While the boy was pursuing his studies with success, the little man with th=
e=20
