ectangle of soft light=20

showed the open hatchway. The Martian officer led the way thither, ducked h=
is head, entered--=20

Powerful hairy hands caught and overpowered him. Before he could collect hi=
mself for resistance,=20

other hands had disarmed him and were dragging him away. His three companio=
ns, narrowly=20

escaping the same fate, fell back and drew their guns and ray throwers. A v=
oice warned them=20

sharply:  "Don't fire, any of you. We've got your friends in here, and we'v=
e taken their electro-

automatics. Give us the slightest reason, and we'll wipe them out first--yo=
u second."  "Who arre=20

you?" shrilled one of the Martians, lowering his weapon.  "My name's Fitzhu=
gh Parr," came back=20

the grim reply. "You framed me into this exile--it's going to prove the wor=
st day's work you Martian=20

flower-faces ever did. Not a move, any of you! The ship's mine, and I'm goi=
ng to take off at dawn."=20

The three discomfited hands tramped away again. Inside the control room, Pa=
rr spoke to his=20

shaggy followers, who grinned and twinkled like so many gnomes doing mischi=
ef.  "They won't=20

dare rush us," he said, "but two of you--Ling and Izak--stay at the door wi=
th those guns. Dead sure=20

you can still use 'em?... You, Ruba, come here to the controls. You say you=
 once flew space-

craft."  Ruba's broad, coarse hand ruffled the bushy hair that grew on his =
almost browless head.=20

"Once," he agreed dolefully. "Now I--many thing I don't remember." His face=
, flat-nosed and=20

blubber-lipped, grew bleak and plaintive as he gazed upon instruments he on=
ce had mastered.=20

"You'll remember," Parr assured him vehemently. "I never flew anything but =
a short-shot pleasure=20

cruiser, but I'm beginning to dope things out. We'll help each other, Ruba.=
 Don't you want to get=20

away from here, go home?"  "Home!" breathed Ruba, and the ears of the other=
s--pointed, some of=20

those ears, and all of them hairy--pricked up visibly at that word.  "Well,=
 there you are," Parr said=20

encouragingly. "Sweat your brains, lad. We've got until dawn. Then away we =
go."  "You will never=20

manage," slurred the skipper from the corner where the Martian captives, bo=
und securely,=20

sprawled under custody of a beast-man with a lever bar for a club. "Thesse =
animalss have not=20

mental powerr--"  "Shut up, or I'll let that guard tap you," Parr warned hi=
m. "They had mental=20

power enough to fool you all over the shop. Come on, Ruba. Isn't this the r=
ocket gauge? Please=20

remember how it operates!"  The capture of the ship had been easy, so easy.=
 The guard had been=20

well kept only until the skipper and his party had gone out of sight toward=
 the human village.=20

Nobody ever expected trouble from beast-men, and the watch on board had not=
 dreamed of a=20

rush until they were down and secure. But this--the rationalization of intr=
icate space-machinery--

was by contrast a doleful obstacle. "Please remember," Parr pleaded with Ru=
ba again.  And so for=20

hours. And at last, prodded and cajoled and bullied, the degenerated intell=
igence of Ruba had=20

partially responded. His clumsy paws, once so skilful, coaxed the mechanism=
 into life. The blasts=20

emitted preliminary belches. The whole fabric of the ship quivered, like a =
sleeper slowly wakening.=20

"Can you get her nose up, Ruba?" Parr found himself able to inquire at last=
.  "Huh, boss," spoke=20

Ling from his watch at the door. "Come. I see white thing."  Parr hurried a=
cross to look.  The white=20

thing was a tattered shirt, held aloft on a stick. From the direction of th=
e village came several=20

figures, Martian and Terrestrial. Parr recognized the bearer of the flag of=
 truce--it was Varina=20

Pemberton. With her walked the three Martian hands whom he had warned off, =
their tentacles=20

lifted to ask for parley, their weapons sheathed at their belts. Sadau was =
there, and Shanklin.=20

"Ready, guns," Parr warned Ling and Izak. "Stand clear of us, out there!" h=
e yelled. "We're going=20

to take off."  "Fitzhugh Parr," called back Varina Pemberton, "you must not=
."  "Oh, must I not?" he=20



taunted her. "Who's so free with her orders? I've got a gun myself this tim=
e. Better keep your=20

distance."  The others stopped at the warning, but the girl came forward. "=
You wouldn't shoot a=20

woman," she announced confidently. "Listen to me."  Parr looked back to whe=
re Ruba was=20

fumbling the ship into more definite action. "Go on and talk," he bade her.=
 "I give you one minute."=20

"You've got to give up this foolish idea," she said earnestly. "It can't su=
cceed--even if you take off."=20

"No if about it. We're doing wonders. Make your goodbyes short. I wish you =
joy of this asteroid,=20

ma'am."  "Suppose you do get away," she conceded. "Suppose, though it's a s=
mall, crowded ship,=20

you reach Earth and land safely. What then?"  "I'll blow the lid off this d=
irty Martian Joke," he told=20

her. "Exhibit these poor devils, to show what the Martians do to Terrestria=
ls they convict. And=20

then--"  "Yes, and then!" she cut in passionately. "Don't you see, Parr? Re=
lations between Mars=20

and Earth are at breaking point now. They have been for long. The Martians =
are technically within=20

their rights when they dump us here, but you'll be a pirate, a thief, a fug=
itive from justice. You can=20

cause a break, perhaps war. And for what?"  "For getting away, for giving f=
reedom to my only=20

friends on this asteroid," said Parr.  "Freedom?" she repeated. "You think =
they can be free on=20

Earth? Can they face their wives or mothers as they are now--no longer men?=
"  "Boss," said Ling=20

suddenly and brokenly, "she tell true. No. I won't go home."  It was like c=
old water, that sudden=20

rush of ghastly truth upon Parr. The girl was right. His victory would be t=
he saddest of defeats. He=20

looked around him at the beast-men who had placed themselves under his cont=
rol--what would=20

happen to them on Earth? Prison? Asylum? _Zoo_?...  "Varina Pemberton," he =
called, "I think you=20

win."  The hairy ones crowded around him, sensing a change in plan. He spok=
e quickly:  "It's all=20

off, boys. Get out, one at a time, and rush away for cover. Nobody will hur=
t you--and we'll be no=20

worse off than we were." He raised his voice again: "If I clear out, will w=
e be left alone?"  "You=20

must give back that armor," she told him. "The Martians insist."  "It's a d=
eal." He stripped the stuff=20

from him and threw it across the floor to lie beside the bound prisoners. "=
I'm trusting you, Varina=20

Pemberton!" he shouted. "We're getting out."  They departed at his orders, =
all of them. Ling and=20

Izak went last, dropping the stolen guns they had held so unhandily. Parr w=
aited for all of them to=20

be gone, then he himself left the ship.  At once bullets began to whicker a=
round him. He dodged=20

behind the ship, then ran crookedly for cover. By great good luck, he was n=
ot hit. His beast-men=20

hurried to him among the bushes.  "Huh, boss?" they asked anxiously. "Ship =
no good? What we=20

do?"  He looked over his shoulder. Somewhere in the night enemies hunted fo=
r him. The beast-

folk were beneath contempt, would be left alone. Only he had shown himself =
too dangerous to be=20

allowed life.  "Goodbye, boys," he said, with real regret. "I'm not much of=
 a boss if I bring bullets=20

among you. Get back home, and let me haul out by myself. I mean it," he sai=
d sternly, as they=20

hesitated. "On your way, and don't get close to me again--death's catching!=
"  They tramped away=20

into the gloom, with querulous backward looks. Parr took a lonely trail in =
an opposite direction.=20

After a moment he paused, tingling with suspense. Heavy feet were following=
 him.  "Who's=20

coming?" he challenged, and ducked to avoid a possible shot. None came. The=
 heavy tread came=20

nearer.  "Boss!" It was Ling.  "I told you to go away," reminded Parr gruff=
ly.  "I not go," Ling=20

retorted. "You no make me."  "Ling, you were boss before I came. Now that I=
'm gone from you--"=20

"You not gone from me. You my boss. Those others, they maybe pick new boss.=
"  "Ling, you fool!"=20

Parr put out a hand in the night, and grabbed a mighty shaggy arm. "I'll be=
 hunted--maybe killed--"=20

"Huh!" grunted Ling. "They hunt us, maybe they get killed." He turned and s=
pat over his shoulder,=20



in contempt for all marauding Martians and their vassal Earth folk. "You, m=
e--we stay together,=20

boss."  "Come on, then," said Parr. "Ling, you're all right."  "Good talk!"=
 said Ling.         *       *       *=20

*       *  They went to the other side of the little spinning world, and th=
ere nobody bothered them.=20

Time and space were relative, as once Einstein remarked to illustrate a rat=
her different situation;=20

anyway, the village under Varina Pemberton numbered only eight men--Parr an=
d Ling could avoid=20

that many easily on a world with nearly nine hundred square miles of brush,=
 rock and gully.  In a=20

grove among grape-vines they built a shelter, and there dwelt for many week=
s. Ling wore well as a=20

sole friend and partner. Looking at the big, devoted fellow, Parr did not f=
eel so revolted as at their=20

first glimpse of each other. Ling had seemed so hairy, so misshapen, like a=
 troll out of Gothic=20

legends. But now ... he was only big and burly, and not so hairy as Parr ha=
d once supposed. As=20

for his face, all tusk and jaw and no brow, where had Parr gotten such an i=
dea of it? Homely it=20

was, brutal it wasn't....  "I get it," mused Parr. "I'm beginning to degene=
rate. I'm falling into the=20

beast-man class, closer to Ling's type. Like can't disgust like. Oh, well, =
why bother about what I=20

can't help?"  He felt resigned to his fate. But then he thought of another-=
-Varina Pemberton, the=20

girl who might have been a pleasant companion in happier, easier circumstan=
ces. She had=20

banished him, threatened him, wheedled him out of victory. She, too, would =
be slipping back to the=20

beast. Her body would warp, her skin grow hairy, her teeth lengthen and sha=
rpen--Ugh! That, at=20

least, revolted him.  "Look, boss," said Ling, rising from where he lounged=
 with a cluster of grapes=20

in his big hand. "People coming--two of 'em."  "Get your club," commanded P=
arr, and caught up=20

his own rugged length of tough torn-wood. "They're men, not beast-men--they=
 must be looking for=20

trouble."  "Couldn't come to a better place to find it," rejoined Ling, spi=
tting between his palm and=20

the half of his cudgel to tighten his grip. The two of them walked boldly i=
nto view.  "I see you,=20

Sadau!" shouted Parr clearly, for there was no mistaking the gaunt, freckle=
d figure in the lead.=20

"Who's that with you?"  The other man must be a new arrival. He was youngis=
h and merry-faced=20

as he drew closer, with black curly hair and a pointed beard. There was a m=
ental-motive look to=20

him, as if he were a high grade engineer or machinist. He wore a breech-cli=
nt of woven grasses,=20

and looked expectantly at Parr.  "They aren't armed," pointed out Ling, and=
 it was true. The pair=20

carried sticks, but only as staffs, not clubs.  "Parr!" Sadau was shouting =
back. "Thank heaven I've=20

found you--we need you badly." He came close, and Parr hefted his club.  "N=
o funny business," he=20

challenged, but Sadau gestured the challenge aside.  "I'm not here to fight=
. I say, you're needed.=20

Things have gone wrong, awfully. The others got to feeling that there was n=
o reason to obey a=20

woman chief, even though Miss Pemberton has many good impulses--"  "I agree=
 to that," nodded=20

Parr, remembering the girl's many strange behaviors. "I daresay she wasn't =
much of a leader."=20

Sadau did not argue the point. "Shanklin, as the previous newest man, grabb=
ed back the=20

chieftaincy," he plunged ahead. "Those other fools backed him. When I tried=
 to defend Miss=20

Pemberton, they drove me out. I stumbled among the others--that crowd you u=
sed to capture the=20

patroller--and got a line on where you were. I came for help."  One phase h=
ad stuck in Parr's mind.=20

"You tried to defend that girl. They were going to kill her?"  "No. Shankli=
n, as chief and king,=20

figures he needs a queen. She's not bad looking. He's going to marry her, u=
nless--"  Parr snorted,=20

and Sadau's voice grew angry. "Curse it, man, I'm not casting you for a kni=
ght of the Table Round,=20

or the valiant space-hero who arrives in the nick of time at the television=
 drama! Simplify it, Parr.=20

You're the only man who ever had the enterprise to do anything actual here.=
 You ought to be chief=20



still, running things justly. And it isn't justice for a girl to be married=
 unofficially to someone she=20

doesn't like. Miss Pemberton despises Shanklin. Now, do you get my point, o=
r are you afraid?"  It=20

was Ling who made answer: "My boss isn't afraid of anything. He'll straight=
en that mess out."  Parr=20

glanced at the big fellow. "Thanks for making up my mind for me, Ling. Well=
, you two have talked=20

me into something. Sadau, shake Ling's big paw. And," he now had time to vi=
ew the stranger at=20

close hand, "who's this with you?"  The man with the black curls looked gen=
ially surprised. "You=20

know me, boss. I'm Frank Rupert."  Parr stared. "Never heard of you."  "You=
're joking. Why, I=20

almost got that Martian patroller into space, when Miss Pemberton--"  Parr =
sprang at him and=20

caught him by his shoulders. "You were Ruba--Rupert! It's only that you did=
n't talk plain before.=20

What's happened to you, man?"  Sadau hastily answered: "The degeneration fo=
rce is obviated.=20

Reversed. All those who were beast-men are coming back, some of the later a=
rrivals completely=20

normal again. Haven't you noticed a change in this big husk?"  Parr turned =
and looked at Ling. So=20

that was it! Day by day, the change had not been enough to impress him. As =
Ling had climbed=20

back along his lost evolutionary trail, Parr had thought that he himself wa=
s slipping down....  "Don't=20

stop and scratch your head over it, Parr," Sadau scolded him. "It'll take a=
 lot of explaining, and we=20

haven't time. You said you'd help get Miss Pemberton out of her jam. Come o=
n."         *       *       *=20

*       *  It was like the television thrillers, after all, Parr reflected.=
 But Sadau was right on one count-

-Parr didn't quite fill the role of the space-hero. He had neither the clos=
e-clipped moustache nor=20

the gleaming top boots. But he did have the regulation deep, unfathomable e=
yes and the=20

murderous impulse.  It was just after noon. Shanklin, as chief-king, had al=
so set up for a priest. In=20

the center of the village clearing, he stood holding a sullen and pale Vari=
na Pemberton by one=20

wrist, while he recited what garblings of the marriage service he remembere=
d. His subordinates=20

were gathered to leer and applaud. They did not know of the rush until it w=
as all over them.  Parr=20

smote one on the side of the neck and spilled him in a squalling heap. Sada=
u, Ling and Rupert=20

overwhelmed the rest of the audience, while Parr charged on into Shanklin. =
His impact interrupted=20

the words "I take this woman" just after the appropriate syllable "wo". As =
once before with Ling,=20

Parr dusted Shanklin's jaw with his fist, followed with a digging jab to th=
e solar plexus, and swung=20

again to the jaw. Shanklin tottered, reeled back, and Parr closed in again.=
  "I always knew I could=20

lick you," Parr taunted. "Come on and fight, bridegroom. I'll raise a knot =
on your head the size of a=20

wedding cake."  Shanklin retreated another two paces, and from his girdle s=
natched the Martian=20

knife. He opened its longest blade with a snap. Varina Pemberton screamed. =
Then, above the=20

commotion of battle, sounded the flat smack of an electro-automatic. Shankl=
in swore murderously,=20

dropping his knife. His knuckles were torn open by the grazing pellet.  And=
 Parr, glancing in the=20

direction whence the shot came, realized with savage disgust that the space=
-hero had come after=20

all. There stood a gorgeous young spark in absolutely conventional space-he=
ro costume, not=20

forgetting the top-boots or the close-clipped moustache. Parr moved back, a=
s if to allow this young=20

demigod the center of the stage.  But Varina Pemberton was not playing the =
part of heroine.=20

Instead of rushing in and embracing, she set her slim hands on her hips. Sh=
e spoke, and her voice=20

was acid: "It's high time you came, Captain Worrall. I did my part of the j=
ob weeks ago."  The=20

handsome fellow in uniform chuckled. "We weren't late, at least. We've been=
 hiding here for some=20

time--saw what     Do not call the white-scarfed riders     To the burying =
that shall be to-morrow.=20

Do not spread food to call strangers     To the wakes that shall be to-morr=
ow;     Do not give=20



money for prayers     For the dead that shall die to-morrow ...  they will =
have no need of prayers,=20

they will have no need of prayers.  MICHAEL. I do not know what that song m=
eans, but tell me=20

something I can do for you.  PETER. Come over to me, Michael.  MICHAEL. Hus=

be sent to walk hard streets in far countries; many a good plan will be bro=

e walls of Babylon:=20

"There are two living countries, the one visible and the one invisible; and=
 when it is winter with us it=20

is summer in that country, and when the November winds are up among us it i=
s lambing time=20

there." I wish that my pupils had asked me to explain any other passage. [_=
The_ FOOL _comes in=20



and stands at the door holding out his hat. He has a pair of shears in the =
other hand._] It sounds to=20

me like foolishness; and yet that cannot be, for the writer of this book, w=
here I have found so much=20

knowledge, would not have set it by itself on this page, and surrounded it =
with so many images=20

and so many deep colours and so much fine gilding, if it had been foolishne=
ss.  FOOL. Give me a=20

penny.  WISE M. [_turns to another page_]. Here he has written: "The learne=
d in old times forgot=20

the visible country." That I understand, but I have taught my learners bett=
er.  FOOL. Won't you=20

give me a penny?  WISE M. What do you want? The words of the wise Saracen w=
ill not teach you=20

much.  FOOL. Such a great wise teacher as you are will not refuse a penny t=
o a Fool.  WISE M.=20

What do you know about wisdom?  FOOL. Oh, I know! I know what I have seen. =
 WISE M. What is=20

it you have seen?  FOOL. When I went by Kilcluan where the bells used to be=
 ringing at the break=20

of every day, I could hear nothing but the people snoring in their houses. =
When I went by=20

Tubbervanach where the young men used to be climbing the hill to the blesse=
d well, they were=20

sitting at the crossroads playing cards. When I went by Carrigoras, where t=
he friars used to be=20

fasting and serving the poor, I saw them drinking wine and obeying their wi=
ves. And when I asked=20

what misfortune had brought all these changes, they said it was no misfortu=
ne, but it was the=20

wisdom they had learned from your teaching.  WISE M. Run round to the kitch=
en, and my wife will=20

give you something to eat.  FOOL. That is foolish advice for a wise man to =
give.  WISE M. Why,=20

Fool?  FOOL. What is eaten is gone. I want pennies for my bag. I must buy b=
acon in the shops,=20

and nuts in the market, and strong drink for the time when the sun is weak.=
 And I want snares to=20

catch the rabbits and the squirrels and the hares, and a pot to cook them i=
n.  WISE M. Go away. I=20

have other things to think of now than giving you pennies.  FOOL. Give me a=
 penny and I will bring=20

you luck. Bresal the Fisherman lets me sleep among the nets in his loft in =
the winter-time because=20

he says I bring him luck; and in the summer-time the wild creatures let me =
sleep near their nests=20

and their holes. It is lucky even to look at me or to touch me, but it is m=
uch more lucky to give me=20

a penny. [_Holds out his hand._] If I wasn't lucky, I'd starve.  WISE M. Wh=
at have you got the=20

shears for?  FOOL. I won't tell you. If I told you, you would drive them aw=
ay.  WISE M. Whom=20

would I drive away?  FOOL. I won't tell you.  WISE M. Not if I give you a p=
enny?  FOOL. No.=20

WISE M. Not if I give you two pennies?  FOOL. You will be very lucky if you=
 give me two pennies,=20

but I won't tell you!  WISE M. Three pennies?  FOOL. Four, and I will tell =
you!  WISE M. Very well,=20

four. But I will not call you Teigue the Fool any longer.  FOOL. Let me com=
e close to you where=20

nobody will hear me. But first you must promise you will not drive them awa=
y. [WISE M. _nods._]=20

Every day men go out dressed in black and spread great black nets over the =
hills, great black=20

nets.  WISE M. Why do they do that?  FOOL. That they may catch the feet of =
the angels. But=20

every morning, just before the dawn, I go out and cut the nets with my shea=
rs, and the angels fly=20

away.  WISE M. Ah, now I know that you are Teigue the Fool. You have told m=
e that I am wise,=20

and I have never seen an angel.  FOOL. I have seen plenty of angels.  WISE =
M. Do you bring luck=20

to the angels too?  FOOL. Oh, no, no! No one could do that. But they are al=
ways there if one looks=20

about one; they are like the blades of grass.  WISE M. When do you see them=
?  FOOL. When one=20

gets quiet, then something wakes up inside one, something happy and quiet l=
ike the stars--not like=20

the seven that move, but like the fixed stars. [_He points upward._]  WISE =
M. And what happens=20

then?  FOOL. Then all in a minute one smells summer flowers, and tall peopl=
e go by, happy and=20

laughing, and their clothes are the colour of burning sods.  WISE M. Is it =
long since you have seen=20



them, Teigue the Fool?  FOOL. Not long, glory be to God! I saw one coming b=
ehind me just now. It=20

was not laughing, but it had clothes the colour of burning sods, and there =
was something shining=20

about its head.  WISE M. Well, there are your four pennies. You, a fool, sa=
y "glory be to God," but=20

before I came the wise men said it.  FOOL. Four pennies! That means a great=
 deal of luck. Great=20

teacher, I have brought you plenty of luck!            [_He goes out shakin=
g the bag._]  WISE M.=20

Though they call him Teigue the Fool, he is not more foolish than everybody=
 used to be, with their=20

dreams and their preachings and their three worlds; but I have overthrown t=
heir three worlds with=20

the seven sciences. [_He touches the books with his hands._] With Philosoph=
y that was made=20

from the lonely star, I have taught them to forget Theology; with Architect=
ure, I have hidden the=20

ramparts of their cloudy heaven; with Music, the fierce planets' daughter w=
hose hair is always on=20

fire, and with Grammar that is the moon's daughter, I have shut their ears =
to the imaginary=20

harpings and speech of the angels; and I have made formations of battle wit=
h Arithmetic that have=20

put the hosts of heaven to the rout. But, Rhetoric and Dialectic, that have=
 been born out of the light=20

star and out of the amorous star, you have been my spear-man and my catapul=
t! Oh! my swift=20

horsemen! Oh! my keen darting arguments, it is because of you that I have o=
verthrown the hosts=20

of foolishness! [_An_ Angel, _in a dress the colour of embers, and carrying=
 a blossoming apple=20

bough in her hand and a gilded halo about her head, stands upon the thresho=
ld._] Before I came,=20

men's minds were stuffed with folly about a heaven where birds sang the hou=
rs, and about angels=20

that came and stood upon men's thresholds. But I have locked the visions in=
to heaven and turned=20

the key upon them. Well, I must consider this passage about the two countri=
es. My mother used to=20

say something of the kind. She would say that when our bodies sleep our sou=
ls awake, and that=20

whatever withers here ripens yonder, and that harvests are snatched from us=
 that they may feed=20

invisible people. But the meaning of the book may be different, for only fo=
ols and women have=20

thoughts like that; their thoughts were never written upon the walls of Bab=
ylon. I must ring the bell=20

for my pupils. [_He sees the_ ANGEL.] What are you? Who are you? I think I =
saw some that were=20

like you in my dreams when I was a child--that bright thing, that dress tha=
t is the colour of embers!=20

But I have done with dreams, I have done with dreams.  ANGEL. I am the Ange=
l of the Most High=20

God.  WISE M. Why have you come to me?  ANGEL. I have brought you a message=
.  WISE M.=20

What message have you got for me?  ANGEL. You will die within the hour. You=
 will die when the=20

last grains have fallen in this glass. [_She turns the hour-glass._]  WISE =
M. My time to die has not=20

come. I have my pupils. I have a young wife and children that I cannot leav=
e. Why must I die?=20

ANGEL. You must die because no souls have passed over the threshold of Heav=
en since you=20

came into this country. The threshold is grassy, and the gates are rusty, a=
nd the angels that keep=20

watch there are lonely.  WISE M. Where will death bring me to?  ANGEL. The =
doors of Heaven will=20

not open to you, for you have denied the existence of Heaven; and the doors=
 of Purgatory will not=20

open to you, for you have denied the existence of Purgatory.  WISE M. But I=
 have also denied the=20

existence of Hell!  ANGEL. Hell is the place of those who deny.  WISE M. [_=
kneels_]. I have,=20

indeed, denied everything, and have taught others to deny. I have believed =
in nothing but what my=20

senses told me. But, oh! beautiful Angel, forgive me, forgive me!  ANGEL. Y=
ou should have asked=20

forgiveness long ago.  WISE M. Had I seen your face as I see it now, oh! be=
autiful angel, I would=20

have believed, I would have asked forgiveness. Maybe you do not know how ea=
sy it is to doubt.=20

Storm, death, the grass rotting, many sicknesses, those are the messengers =
that came to me. Oh!=20



why are you silent? You carry the pardon of the Most High; give it to me! I=
 would kiss your hands if=20

I were not afraid--no, no, the hem of your dress!  ANGEL. You let go undyin=
g hands too long ago=20

to take hold of them now.  WISE M. You cannot understand. You live in that =
country people only=20

see in their dreams. Maybe it is as hard for you to understand why we disbe=
lieve as it is for us to=20

believe. Oh! what have I said! You know everything! Give me time to undo wh=
at I have done. Give=20

me a year--a month--a day--an hour! Give me to this hour's end, that I may =
undo what I have=20

done!  ANGEL. You cannot undo what you have done. Yet I have this power wit=
h my message. If=20

you can find one that believes before the hour's end, you shall come to Hea=
ven after the years of=20

Purgatory. For, from one fiery seed, watched over by those that sent me, th=
e harvest can come=20

again to heap the golden threshing floor. But now farewell, for I am weary =
of the weight of time.=20

WISE M. Blessed be the Father, blessed be the Son, blessed be the Spirit, b=
lessed be the=20

Messenger They have sent!  ANGEL [_at the door and pointing at the hour-gla=
ss_]. In a little while=20

the uppermost glass will be empty. [_Goes out._]  WISE M. Everything will b=
e well with me. I will=20

call my pupils; they only say they doubt. [_Pulls the bell._] They will be =
here in a moment. They=20

want to please me; they pretend that they disbelieve. Belief is too old to =
be overcome all in a=20

minute. Besides, I can prove what I once disproved. [_Another pull at the b=
ell._] They are coming=20

now. I will go to my desk. I will speak quietly, as if nothing had happened=
.            [_He stands at=20

the desk with a fixed look in his eyes. The           voices of the pupils =
are heard outside singing=20

these words._]      I was going the road one day,     O the brown and the y=
ellow beer,     And I met=20

with a man that was no right man     O my dear, O my dear.            [_The=
 sound grows louder as=20

they come nearer, but ceases on           the threshold._]                 =
_Enter_ PUPILS _and the_=20

FOOL.  FOOL. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Who is that pulling at my bag?=
 King's son, do=20

not pull at my bag.  A YOUNG MAN. Did your friends the angels give you that=
 bag? Why don't=20

they fill your bag for you?  FOOL. Give me pennies! Give me some pennies!  =
A YOUNG M. What=20

do you want pennies for?--that great bag at your waist is heavy.  FOOL. I w=
ant to buy bacon in the=20

shops, and nuts in the market, and strong drink for the time when the sun i=
s weak, and snares to=20

catch rabbits and the squirrels that steal the nuts, and hares, and a great=
 pot to cook them in.  A=20

YOUNG M. Why don't your friends tell you where buried treasures are? Why do=
n't they make you=20

dream about treasures? If one dreams three times there is always treasure. =
 FOOL [_holding out=20

his hat_]. Give me pennies! Give me pennies!            [_They throw pennie=
s into his hat. He is=20

standing close to           the door, that he may hold out his hat to each =
newcomer._]  A YOUNG M.=20

Master, will you have Teigue the Fool for a scholar?  ANOTHER YOUNG M. Teig=
ue, will you give=20

us your pennies if we teach you lessons? No, he goes to school for nothing =
on the mountains. Tell=20

us what you learn on the mountains, Teigue.  WISE M. Be silent all! [_He ha=
s been standing silent,=20

looking away._] Stand still in your places, for there is something I would =
have you tell me.=20

[_A moment's pause. They all stand round in their places._           TEIGUE=
 _still stands at the=20

door._]  WISE M. Is there anyone amongst you who believes in God? In Heaven=
? Or in=20

Purgatory? Or in Hell?  ALL THE YOUNG MEN. No one, Master! No one!  WISE M.=
 I knew you=20

would all say that; but do not be afraid. I will not be angry. Tell me the =
truth. Do you not believe?  A=20

YOUNG M. We once did, but you have taught us to know better.  WISE=20


_
from the knife had in mind whole hours ago. But we also saw these others," =
and he nodded toward=20

Parr. "They sneaked up in such a business-like manner, I hadn't the heart t=
o spoil their rescue."=20

*       *       *       *       *  Other uniformed men--hands of the Terres=
trial Space Fleet--were coming=20

into view from among the boughs. They, too, were armed. Ling walked across =
to Parr, a struggling=20

captive under each arm.  "What are these strangers up to, boss?" he demande=
d. "Say the word=20

and I'll wring that officer's neck. I never liked officers, anyway."  "Wait=
," Parr bade him. Then, to the=20

man called Captain Worrall: "Just what are you doing here?"  "This asteroid=
," replied Worrall, "is=20

now Terrestrial territory. We're fortifying it against the Martians. War wa=
s declared three weeks=20

ago, and we made rocket-tracks for this little crumb. It's an ideal base fo=
r a flanking attack."  Parr=20

scowled. "You're fortifying?" he repeated. "Well, you'd better shag out of =
here. There's a power--

not working just now, but--"  "No fear of that," Varina Pemberton told him.=
 She was smiling.  "I can=20

explain best by starting at the start. Recently we got a report of what the=
 Martians were doing out=20

here. We realized that Earth must take care of her own, these poor devils w=
ho were being pushed=20

back into animalism. Also, with war inevitable--"  "You aren't starting at =
the start," objected Parr.=20

"Where do you fit into all this? You're no soldier."  "Oh, but she is," Cap=
tain Worrall said, offering=20

Parr a cigarette from a platinum case. "She's a colonel of intelligence--hi=
gh ranking. Wonderful job=20

you've done, Colonel Pemberton."  She took up the tale again: "If the rever=
se-evolution power=20

could be destroyed, this artificially habitable rock in space would be a gr=
eat prize for our navy to=20

capture. So I took a big chance--got myself framed to a charge of Murder on=
 Mars, and was the=20

first woman ever sent here. I knew fairly accurately when war would break o=
ut, and figured I had=20

months to do my work in. That captured armor gave me the clue."  "All I kne=
w was that it gave off=20

a vibration," nodded Parr.  "Exactly. Which meant that the evolution-revers=
e was vibratory, too. I=20

confided in Sadau, and he and I pieced the rest of the riddle together. The=
 vibrator would be=20

inside, where nobody would venture for fear of jamming the gravity-core--bu=
t we ventured--"  "And=20

shut it off!" cried Parr.  "More than that. We reversed it, started it agai=
n at top speed to cause a=20

recovery from the degeneration process. Clever, these Martians--they fix it=
 so you can shuttle to=20

and fro in development. Already the higher beast-men are back to normal, li=
ke Rupert there, and=20

the others will be all right, soon."  "You had every right to chase me off =
at the end of a pistol," said=20

Parr. "I might have gummed the works badly."  "You nearly did that anyway,"=
 Varina Pemberton=20

accused. "Fighting, raiding, stirring up the Martians who might have put a =
crimp in my plans any=20

moment--but, being the type you are, you couldn't do otherwise. I recognize=
d that when I gave you=20

the protective armor."  He gazed at her. "Why didn't you keep it for yourse=
lf?"  "No," and she=20

shook her tawny head. "I figured to win or lose very promptly. But you, arm=
ored against=20

degeneration, might live after me and be an awful problem to the Martians. =
Remember, I didn't=20

make you give it back until I had done what I came to do."  Worrall spoke a=
gain: "Colonel, these=20

exiles must stay until all effects of the degeneration influence is gone. T=
hey'll figure as civilians,=20

with colonists' rights. That means they must have a governor, to cooperate =
with the military=20

garrison. Will that be you?"  Shanklin dared to speak: "I am chief--"  "Arr=
est that man," the girl told=20

two space-hands. "No, Captain. But I'm senior officer, and I'll make an app=
ointment. By far the=20

best fitted person for the governorship is Fitzhugh Parr."  The other exile=
s had pressed close to=20

listen. Sadau, the diplomatic, at once set up a cheer. Ling added his own l=
oyal bellow, and the=20

others joined in. Parr's ears burned with embarrassment.  "Have it your way=
," he said to them all.=20



"We'll live here, get normal, and help all we can. But first, what have we =
to eat? We've got guests."=20

"No, governor, you're the guest of the garrison," protested Captain Worrall=
. "Come aboard my ship=20

yonder. I'll lend you a uniform, and you'll preside at the head of the tabl=
e tonight."  "Varina=20

Pemberton," Parr addressed the girl who had caused so much trouble and chan=
ge on the little=20

world of exile, "will you come and sit at my right hand there?"  "A pleasur=
e," she smiled, and put=20

her arm through his.  Everybody cheered again, and both Parr and the girl b=
lushed.      End of=20

A YOUNG M. No, no, Master!  WISE M. If you tell me that you have not change=
d, I shall be glad=20

and not angry.  A YOUNG M. [_to his_ NEIGHBOUR]. He wants somebody to dispu=
te with.  HIS=20

NEIGHBOUR. I knew that from the beginning.  A YOUNG M. That is not the subj=
ect for to-day; you=20

were going to talk about the words the beggar wrote upon the walls of Babyl=
on.  WISE M. If there=20

is one amongst you that believes, he will be my best friend. Surely there i=
s one amongst you.=20

[_They are all silent._] Surely what you learned at your mother's knees has=
 not been so soon=20

forgotten.  A YOUNG M. Master, till you came, no teacher in this land was a=
ble to get rid of=20

foolishness and ignorance. But every one has listened to you, every one has=
 learned the truth.=20

You have had your last disputation.  ANOTHER. What a fool you made of that =
monk in the market-

place! He had not a word to say.  WISE M. [_comes from his desk and stands =
among them in the=20

middle of the room_]. Pupils, dear friends, I have deceived you all this ti=
me. It was I myself who=20

was ignorant. There is a God. There is a Heaven. There is fire that passes =
and there is fire that=20

lasts for ever.            [TEIGUE, _through all this, is sitting on a stoo=
l by the           door, reckoning=20

on his fingers what he will buy with his           money._]  A YOUNG M. [_t=
o_ Another]. He will not=20

be satisfied till we dispute with him. [_To the_ WISE MAN.] Prove it, Maste=
r. Have you seen them?=20

WISE M. [_in a low, solemn voice_]. Just now, before you came in, someone c=
ame to the door,=20



and when I looked up I saw an angel standing there.  A YOUNG M. You were in=
 a dream.=20

Anybody can see an angel in his dreams.  WISE M. Oh, my God! It was not a d=
ream! I was awake,=20

waking as I am now. I tell you I was awake as I am now.  A YOUNG M. Some dr=
eam when they=20

are awake, but they are the crazy, and who would believe what they say? For=
give me, Master, but=20

that is what you taught me to say. That is what you said to the monk when h=
e spoke of the visions=20

of the saints and the martyrs.  ANOTHER YOUNG M. You see how well we rememb=
er your=20

teaching.  WISE M. Out, out from my sight! I want someone with belief. I mu=
st find that grain the=20

Angel spoke of before I die. I tell you I must find it, and you answer me w=
ith arguments. Out with=20

you, out of my sight! [_The_ YOUNG MEN _laugh._]  A YOUNG M. How well he pl=
ays at faith! He=20

is like the monk when he had nothing more to say.  WISE M. Out, out, this i=
s no time for laughter!=20

Out with you, though you are a king's son! [_They begin to hurry out._]  A =
YOUNG M. Come,=20

come; he wants us to find someone who will dispute with him.            [_A=
ll go out._]  WISE M.=20

am sleepy in the evening.=20

children asleep, do you not think about the saints, about the things you us=
ed to believe in? What=20

do you think of when you are alone?  BRIDGET [_considering_]. I think about=
 nothing. Sometimes=20

I wonder if the linen is bleaching white, or I go out to see if the cows ar=

find somebody! [_He goes towards the door, but stops with his eyes fixed on=

enough belief to fill a pipe with since you put down the monk. Can't you be=

WISE M. Out of this, woman, out of this, I say! [BRIDGET _goes through the =

 them. They will=20

believe. It is only those who have reason that doubt; the young are full of=
 faith. Bridget, Bridget,=20

 dandelion to find out=20

o find out what hour it=20

is! You are waiting to see them coming through the door to carry me away. [=
FOOL _goes on=20

to the room._] Is=20

there a Heaven? Is there a Hell? Is there a Purgatory?  FOOL. So you ask me=
 now. When you=20

were asking your pupils, I said to myself, if he would ask Teigue the Fool,=
 Teigue could tell him all=20

about it, for Teigue has learned all about it when he has been cutting the =
nets.  WISE M. Tell me;=20

tell me!  FOOL. I said, Teigue knows everything. Not even the cats or the h=
ares that milk the cows=20

have Teigue's wisdom. But Teigue will not speak; he says nothing.  WISE M. =
Tell me, tell me! For=20

under the cover the grains are falling, and when they are all fallen I shal=
l die; and my soul will be=20

lost if I have not found somebody that believes! Speak, speak!  FOOL [_look=
ing wise_]. No, no, I=20

won't tell you what is in my mind, and I won't tell you what is in my bag. =
You might steal away my=20

thoughts. I met a bodach on the road yesterday, and he said, "Teigue, tell =
me how many pennies=20

are in your bag; I will wager three pennies that there are not twenty penni=
es in your bag; let me put=20

in my hand and count them." But I pulled the strings tighter, like this; an=
d when I go to sleep every=20

night I hide the bag where no one knows.  WISE M. [_goes towards the hour-g=
lass as if to uncover=20

it_]. No, no, I have not the courage. [_He kneels._] Have pity upon me, Foo=
l, and tell me!  FOOL.=20

Ah! Now, that is different. I am not afraid of you now. But I must come nea=
rer to you; somebody in=20

there might hear what the Angel said.  WISE M. Oh, what did the Angel tell =
you?  FOOL. Once I=20

was alone on the hills, and an angel came by and he said, "Teigue the Fool,=
 do not forget the=20

Three Fires; the Fire that punishes, the Fire that purifies, and the Fire w=
herein the soul rejoices for=20

ever!"  WISE M. He believes! I am saved! The sand has run out.... [FOOL _he=
lps him to his=20

chair._] I am going from the country of the seven wandering stars, and I am=
 going to the country of=20

the fixed stars!... I understand it all now. One sinks in on God; we do not=
 see the truth; God sees=20

the truth in us. Ring the bell. [FOOL _rings bell._] Are they coming? Tell =
them, Fool, that when the=20

life and the mind are broken the truth comes through them like peas through=
 a broken peascod.=20

Pray, Fool, that they may be given a sign and carry their souls alive out o=
f the dying world. Your=20

prayers are better than mine.            [FOOL _bows his head_. WISE MAN's =
_head sinks on his=20

arm on           the books_. PUPILS _are heard singing as before, but now t=
hey           come right=20

into the room before they cease their song._]  A YOUNG MAN. Look at the Foo=

ANOTHER. What have you called us in for, Teigue? What are you going to tell=
 us?  ANOTHER.=20



No wonder he has had dreams! See, he is fast asleep now. [_Goes over and to=
uches him._] Oh,=20

he is dead!  FOOL. Do not stir! He asked for a sign that you might be saved=

 catalogued qualities=20

of his, you have a fair measure of Mr. Noyes at his best.... Two considerat=

interesting above most poets: the wonderful degree in which the personal ch=

has already written, and the surprises which one feels may be in store in h=
is future work. His=20

feelings have already so much variety and so much apparent sincerity that i=
t is impossible to tell in=20

what direction his genius will develop. In whatever style he writes,--the m=
ystical, the historical-

 to lift it to the plane=20

where the masterpieces of literature dwell. It can be read with delight by =
a child of ten. It is put into=20

"It has seemed to us from=20

gift of uttering in=20

authentic lyric cry some fresh, unspoiled emotion."--_Post._   Mr. Richard =
Le Gallienne in the=20

t things are done, and=20

all done so well.... But that for which one is most grateful to Mr. Noyes i=
