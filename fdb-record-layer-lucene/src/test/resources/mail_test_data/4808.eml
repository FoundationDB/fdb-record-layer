and very profitably, by pressing home our reflections on Hamlet=E2=80=99s r=
emark to the players. There is=20

one kind of writing which does confine itself to the feature of virtue and =
the image of scorn, and=20

which does indeed, for that very reason, limit itself always to giving the =
form and presence of the=20

time=E2=80=94the kind of writing, that is, which indicts human nature inste=
ad of portraying it. Our better=20

selves, our ideals, are of no time, but our faults are personal responsibil=
ities and strictly=20

contemporary. Satire, therefore, which holds up to merriment or to scorn wh=
at is ridiculous or=20

base, must always take a present subject, and in general any art that leans=
 toward the=20

consideration of our shortcomings will lean also toward the life enacted at=
 the moment. If Hamlet=20

meant to trap the king, of course he would write into the old play the very=
 murder the king had=20

committed only three or four months ago; this would not be satire in the us=
ual sense, but it would=20

serve the same end, to convict the guilty and to reform the world. The cult=
 of the contemporary,=20

then, is proper quite literally for satire; it remains only to ask how far =
it is agreed upon, and=20

celebrated, and also for divers other reasons and considerations, we have g=
ranted and now do=20

grant, by special grace, in these present letters, that the said Colin Pilo=
n, and Jeanne, his wife,=20

each one of them, shall be and remain for life exempt and free from all tax=
es that are and that may=20

be in the future imposed and exacted in our name throughout our kingdom, wh=
ether for the=20

maintenance or keep of our armies and soldiers or for any other cause whats=
oever, and (they shall=20

also be exempt) from the duties of watch and ward, wheresoever in our kingd=
om they may take up=20

their abode. Given at Senlis, this 22nd day of February, in the year of gra=
ce one thousand four=20

hundred and seventy-four."  It will be seen from this that Jeanne was alrea=
dy married, and that the=20

king himself had taken some sort of personal interest in her case, supplyin=
g the very necessary=20

_dot_ for the bride. She had not sought an alliance out of her own class, f=
or Colin Pilon was a=20

simple man-at-arms, who did not live long to enjoy either the love of his w=
ife or the favor of the=20

king, for he fell at the siege of Nancy, in 1477. A few years=20


_
for art.  But is satire not art? Did not Martial and Juvenal, Dryden and Po=
pe write highly artistic=20

satires? There is an art of satire, we must answer, as there is an art of p=
reaching and an art of=20

prosecuting a criminal case. But if there is a distinction between art and =
morals, then satire=20

belongs to the world of ethics, and of ethics on the grim side, rather than=
 to the world of beauty=20

and delight. To survey and judge the morals of one=E2=80=99s age is a serio=
us office that no thoughtful and=20

sensitive person seems altogether to neglect; if the purpose of art is to m=
ake such a survey, as=20

Hamlet seems to say, then _Twelfth Night_ is hardly a masterpiece in art, a=
nd _Sandford and=20

Merton_ is certainly one. If art, on the other hand, has for its purpose to=
 salvage out of our crude=20

days the truth which can be translated into beauty, and which so translated=
 may be a joy for ever,=20

then art will have as little as possible to do with men=E2=80=99s faults=E2=

the kind of writing which confines itself to our frailties one time in the =
personal guard of the king.=20

Henceforth nothing more is known of her, not even the date of her death. Bu=
t popular fancy=20

associated her so intimately with the siege of Beauvais that, be her real s=
urname what it might,=20

she was always Jeanne Hachette; and even in the nineteenth century a certai=
n Pierre Fourquet=20

d'Hachette, claiming descent from the humble heroine, received a pension fr=
om Charles X. In=20

Beauvais, too, her name and the memory of her good service were kept alive =
not only by the=20

annual parade on the festival of Saint Agadresme, but also by a faded, anci=
ent standard, borne by=20

the young girls in the procession, at other times carefully guarded among t=
he treasures of the city.=20

It was a standard of white damasked cloth, bearing figures and mottoes in g=
ilt and colored paints.=20

Even now one can decipher the haughty device of Charles le temeraire: _Je l=
'ay emprins_ (I have=20

undertaken it), and beside it the emblems of the great order of the Golden =
Fleece. It is the very=20

standard that the girl snatched from the=20


_
art. Moreover, the moralist desires a cure of souls, and when the fault is =
remedied, who will care=20

for the satire or even understand it? It is easy enough, without taking tho=
ught, to perish with our=20

own time, but it is one of the oldest hopes art has held out to natural man=
, that being purified into=20

art he should not altogether die. But mortality is germane to satire. When =
we read Dryden=E2=80=99s terrible=20

excoriations of Og and Doeg, we can only wonder who were the human beings h=
e hated so, and=20

when we come to know something of their lives and characters, we are more c=
onfused to name=20

the moral impulse in him Burgundian soldier more than four centuries ago.  =
The story of Jeanne=20

Hachette is but an episode, of course; but in reading it we should remember=
 that, however small=20

the part she played in the great history of the world, she had one rare tra=
it, a trait often distinctive=20

of the best figures in history, though not always of the most notable--mode=
sty. Like Jeanne d'Arc,=20

her task once accomplished she was content to be what she had been before; =
more fortunate than=20

that other Jeanne, she lived to see herself honored, and was not spoiled th=
ereby any more than=20

Jeanne d'Arc was spoiled by her far greater=20


_
warm a hell. In art, loving your own times does not mean loving to find fau=
lt with them.   II  A=20

genuine love of your own time is the recognition, in what you meet in it, o=
f those best moments=20

which crave to be made accessible even for the remotest of ages following. =
To immortalize any=20

given moment, however,  If Jeanne Hachette was a representative of that cla=
ss now about to=20

assume greater importance in the life of France, namely the artisans, the u=
nfortunate daughter of=20

Charles le temeraire was, in her character as well as in the events of her =
life, as surely=20

representative of disappearing feudalism and=20

is to take it out of the temporary and somehow to find a language for it so=
 general in its appeal that=20

hereafter it may preserve in its own significance the trivial circumstances=
 from which it first arose.=20

Whenever a genuine love of life stirs the artist, it will be a passion for =
what he thinks is the best in=20

his own day; even if he is antiquarian and takes for object of but the play=
thing of a court that would=20

use her in its pageants and in its schemes of aggrandizement with utter dis=
regard of what might be=20

her personal preferences. Reared amidst surroundings that suggested the pom=
p and glory of=20

chivalry and were eloquent of feminine dependence if not of feminine inferi=
ority, she was suddenly=20
