DISAPPOINTMENT TO CAPTAIN SCOTT   Captain Ringgold knew something about Ade=
n before he decided to make a stopping-place of it, and it was certainly a =
more agreeable location than Perim. The town--or philodendron monstera the =
society editors of the capital were still calling him, might have had a joy=
ous half-holiday. The autumn afternoon was picture-fine, the little car ran=
 well, and Patricia's mood was tempered with the gayety which strives to ex=
tract the final thrill of enjoyment out of the closing days of a delightful=
 vacation. Blount was grateful for the light-hearted mood. He felt that it =
would be next to impossible to tell Patricia how shall be done before to-mo=
rrow noon."  "Now I will introduce you to our chief steward."  Mr. Sage ins=
isted upon seeing his supplies before he named the quantity needed, and mad=
e an appointment on shore.     CHAPTER XXXIII  A DISAPPOINTMENT TO CAPTAIN =
SCOTT   Captain Ringgold knew something about Aden before he decided to mak=
e a stopping-place of it, and it was certainly a more agreeable location th=
an Perim. The town--or _
such things now and then."     XXI  THE UNDER-DOG   Blount's first move on =
the morning=20

following the militant interview with his father was telegraphic; he wired =
the campaign chairmen in=20

the three towns remaining on his list, cancelling his speaking-engagements.=
 Beyond that he went=20

forth to institute a painstaking search in the purlieus of the city, a ques=
t having for its object the=20

unearthing of the man Thomas Gryson. More and more he was coming to believe=
 that this man=20

was the key to a larger situation in the field of political corruption than=
 any which had as yet=20

developed. Wherefore he made the search thorough.  Oddly enough, considerin=
g the man and his=20

habits, the quest proved fruitless. Blount was too clean a man to be on fam=
iliar terms with the=20

saloon men and dive-keepers of the capital-city underworld, or with the cro=
oks and turnings of the=20

underworld itself; but he found his way around easily enough in daylight, a=
nd had his labor for his=20

pains. For when he went back to the hotel at the luncheon-hour he brought l=
ittle with him save a=20

stench in his nostrils and a slightly increased fund of mystification. Grys=
on had disappeared as=20

completely as if the earth had opened and swallowed him. And country. The e=
xpedition cost=20

45,000,000 dollars; but England always protects her citizens, wherever they=
 are."  "Is it a=20

Mohammedan country, like Egypt?" asked Mrs. Belgrave.  "It is not; it is no=
minally a Christian=20

country, though its religion is of the very lowest type that ever was calle=
d by that name, wholly=20

external, and morals are at a very low ebb. After the British left, a princ=
e defeated his rival, and=20

was crowned as Emperor John; but it is a single-horse monarchy. It has been=
 at war with Egypt,=20

which never got possession of the country as it desired. In 1885 Italy occu=
pied Massowah, though=20

for what purpose was never definitely stated. Three companies of its army w=
ere attacked by the=20

Abyssinians, and nearly the whole of them were massacred; but the Italians =
did not avenge this=20

assault."  The ship continued on her course along the coast of Yemen ninety=
 miles to Aden, which=20

the commander had before given out as his first stopping-place. Steam had b=
een reduced so that=20

the arrival should not be in the night. The passage had been made in about =
four days. The pilot=20

came on board at six o'clock in the morning, and the passengers were alread=
y on the promenade.=20

Two large steamers were at anchor in the=20


_
because the ward-heeler's own henchmen were searching for him.  Daunted but=
 not beaten,=20

Blount meant to continue the quest in the afternoon. But man proposes, and =
a small _dea ex=20

machina_ may dispose. At the _cafe_ family luncheon, at which Blount was ca=
reful to make his=20

appearance, not only because Patricia was there, but also for the sake of k=
eeping the kinsman=20

peace his father had begged for, it transpired that Patricia had been promi=
sed an auto drive to Fort=20

Parker, the military reservation sixteen miles to the westward, and that th=
ere were difficulties. The=20

senator's wife took his arm and explained her dilemma at the table dispersa=
l.  "It is parade day at=20

the Fort, you know, and Patricia has set her heart on going. I don't know h=
ow I came to be so=20

absurdly thoughtless, but I promised her before I remembered that this is t=
he Kismet Club election=20

afternoon, and if I don't go, they'll make me president again in spite of e=
verything," she said in low=20

tones as they were leaving the _cafe_. "I simply _can't_ serve another year=
; and at the roads, and=20

were engaged in coaling and watering. A boat came off as soon as the ship a=
nchored, containing=20

an agent of the great Parsee merchants, who do most of the business of the =
town. He wished to=20

see the captain, who was in his cabin.  "Good-morning, Captain," said the m=
an, speaking very=20

good English. "I have taken the liberty to bring off some newspapers."  "I =
am greatly obliged to=20

you, for we are getting hungry for newspapers," replied Captain Ringgold as=
 he took the package.=20

"Excuse me for a moment and I will send them to the passengers, for I have =
not time to look at=20

them now."  He tossed the bundle of papers up to Dr. Hawkes, and returned t=
o his cabin.  "I shall=20

be happy to take your orders for whatever you may need at this port, includ=
ing coal and water, as=20

well as provisions and other supplies," continued the agent.  The commander=
 ordered both coal=20

and water; for he knew about the Parsee merchants, and referred Mr. Gaskill=
, as he gave his=20

name, to Mr. Melancthon Sage, the chief steward.  "What sort of goods do yo=
u furnish here,=20


_
dislike to disappoint Patricia. She is such a dear girl!" Mrs. Honoria was =
strictly within the bounds=20

of truth in claiming to have forgotten the date of the Kismet election of o=
fficers; but it was equally=20

true that the club would re-elect her, present or absent, commander.  "Ever=
y sort, Captain=20

Ringgold. This steamer does not belong to any regular line, I think," said =
the agent.  "It does not to=20

any line, regular or irregular; and yet she is not a tramp," replied the co=
mmander with a smile.  "Is=20

she a man-of-war?" inquired=20


_
founder and chief patroness.  Blount saw the pointing of all this with perf=
ect clarity, and he had no=20

need to assure himself that it had every ear-mark of another expedient to g=
et him out of the way.=20

But while he was with Mrs. Honoria and listening to her persuasive little a=
ppeals it was much=20

harder to maintain the antagonistic attitude than it was when she figured--=
at a distance--merely as=20

his father's second wife and his mother's supplanter. Foolish? Oh, yes; but=
 at times when the star=20

of impulse is in the ascendant every man hath a fool in his sleeve.  "It _i=
s_ too bad to disappoint=20

her," he found himself saying, matching the little lady's low tone. "If I w=
asn't so terribly busy--"  "I=20

know; and just now, with the election so near, you must be busier than ever=
. I suppose I shall have=20

to explain to Patricia, and it hurts me, when she is going home so soon."  =
"Going home?" echoed=20

the victim.  "Yes; in a few days now. The professor has already overstayed =
his leave of absence,=20

so he says."  Blount clenched a figurative fist and shook it savagely at an=
 unkind fate.=20

Nevertheless, he fell.  "If you can shift your responsibility to my shoulde=
rs, Mrs. Blount--" he=20

began, but she would not let him finish.  "Oh! that is _so_ good of you, Ev=
an. Take the little car,=20

and be sure to ask the garage man to put in new batteries. The magneto isn'=
t working very well.=20

And be here by half past one if you can. The parade is at half past two, yo=
u know."  Under  "She is=20

not; she is a yacht, with a pleasure party on board who are making a voyage=
 around the world."=20

"Ah, yes, Captain; I understand. There is another steam-yacht in the roads,=
 over beyond the P. &=20

O. steamer nearest to you. Perhaps you have seen her; she is painted white =
all over."  "I did not=20

notice her. What flag does she carry?"  "She sails under the British flag. =
But you suggested that=20

you might need other supplies. We can furnish your party with all the Engli=
sh goods they want,=20

and there are first-class tailors and dressmakers here."  "My passengers mu=
st speak for=20

themselves," answered the captain. "I fear you cannot furnish the supplies =
I need."  "We can=20

furnish everything that can be named," persisted the agent of the Parsee me=
rchants. "What do you=20

require?"  "Two twenty-four pounders, brass, naval carriages, and all the a=
mmunition needed for=20

their use," replied the commander; and he felt as though he had made an imp=
ossible demand.=20

"We can furnish anything and everything you may desire in this line; in fac=
t, we can fit out your=20

ship as a man-of-war. But do you need only two such guns as you describe, C=
aptain Ringgold?"=20

asked the business-driving Mr. Gaskill. "We have a lot of four of them, and=
 we should like to=20

dispose of them together."  "I will see the guns before I say anything more=
 about the matter. When=20

can you fill our water-tanks and coal-bunkers?" inquired the commander.  "W=
e are very busy to-

day, for we have several=20
