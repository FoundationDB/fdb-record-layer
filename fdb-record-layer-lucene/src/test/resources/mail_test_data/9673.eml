dracaena marginata to the front door, while in country seats peristyles com=

strae and walks.  I have now set forth the rules for houses in town so far =
as I could describe them in a summary way. Next I shall state how farmhouse=

 young doctor, in a pair of new black trousers, gold spectacles, and of cou=
rse a white tie, walks in. He introduces himself. I beg him to be seated, a=
nd ask what I can do for him. Not without emotion, the young devotee of sci=
ence begins telling me that he has passed his examination as a doctor of me=
dicine, and that he has now only to write his dracaena marginata to the fro=

  CHAPTER VI  THE FARMHOUSE   1. In the home to bed. "Peace be to thy ashes=
, honest toiler."  A third ring at the bell. A young doctor, in a pair of n=
ew black trousers, gold spectacles, and of course a white tie, walks in. He=
 introduces himself. I beg him to be seated, and ask what I can do for him.=
 Not without emotion, the young devotee of science begins telling me that h=
e has passed his examination as a doctor of medicine, and that he has now o=
nly to write his _
and all intended for the like purpose. Hence, men of everyday fortune do no=
t need entrance=20

courts, tablina, or atriums built in grand style, because such men are more=
 apt to discharge their=20

social obligations by going round to others than to have others come to the=
m.  2. Those who do=20

business in country produce must have stalls and shops in their entrance co=
urts, with crypts,=20

granaries, store-rooms, and so forth in their houses, constructed more for =
the purpose of keeping=20

rest of your life in doing work you do not care for."  But at once I feel s=
orry for him, and I hasten to=20

add:  "However, as you think best. And so read a little more and come again=
."  "When?" the idle=20

youth asks in a hollow voice.  "When you like. Tomorrow if you like."  And =
in his good-natured eyes=20

I read:  "I can come all right, but of course you will plough me again, you=
 beast!"  "Of course," I=20

say, "you won't know more science for going in for my examination another=
=20


_
produce in good condition than for ornamental beauty.  For capitalists and =
farmers of the revenue,=20

somewhat comfortable and showy apartments must be constructed, secure again=
st robbery; for=20

advocates and public speakers, handsomer and more roomy, to accommodate mee=
tings; for men=20

of rank who, from holding offices and magistracies, have social obligations=
 to their fellow-citizens,=20

lofty entrance courts in regal style, and most spacious atriums and peristy=
les, with plantations and=20

walks of some extent in them, appropriate to their dignity. They need also =
libraries, picture=20

galleries, and basilicas, finished in a style similar to that of great publ=
ic buildings, since public=20

councils as well as private law suits and hearings before arbitrators are v=
ery often held in the=20

houses of such men.  3. If, therefore, houses are planned on these principl=
es to suit and you must=20

be thankful for that."  Silence follows. I get up and wait for my visitor t=
o go, but he stands and looks=20

towards the window, fingers his beard, and thinks. It grows boring.  The sa=
nguine youth's voice is=20

pleasant and mellow, his eyes are clever and ironical, his face is genial, =
though a little bloated=20

from frequent indulgence in beer and overlong lying on the sofa; he looks a=
s though he could tell=20

me a lot of interesting things about the opera, about his affairs of the he=
art, and about comrades=20

whom he likes. Unluckily, it is not the thing to discuss these subjects, or=
 else I should have been=20

glad to listen to him.  "Professor, I give you my word of honour that if yo=
u mark me for a pass I...=20

I'll..."  As soon as we reach the "word of honour" I wave my hands and sit =
down to the table. The=20

student ponders a minute longer, and says=20


_
different classes of persons, as prescribed in my first book, under the sub=
ject of Propriety, there=20

will be no room for criticism; for they will be arranged with convenience a=
nd perfection to suit every=20

purpose. The rules on these points will hold not only for houses in town, b=
ut also for those in the=20

country, except that in town atriums  "In that case, good-bye... I beg your=
 pardon."  "Good-bye, my=20

friend. Good luck to you."  He goes irresolutely into the hall, slowly puts=
 on his outdoor things, and,=20

going out into the street, probably ponders for some time longer; unable to=
 think of anything,=20

except "old devil," inwardly addressed to me, he goes into a wretched=20
