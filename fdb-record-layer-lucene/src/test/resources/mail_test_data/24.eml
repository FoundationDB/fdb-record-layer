philodendron monstera descriptions of these more than Olympian revels.  An =
Italian, as a rule, in Carnival time is like an English boy on the fifth of=
 November--he is not happy unless he dresses up. In this country, we are ap=

re are limits to the=20

endurance of long-suffering woman. Mrs. Dodd felt that she was being trampl=
ed on. The sensation=20

was new to her, and unpleasant.  "You appear to cling to her, squire," she =
said.  "Naturally,=20

naturally," answered the squire, "so do the girls. She has been more than a=
 mother to them."=20

"Why not make her so in reality?" retorted the exasperated woman, losing he=
r head. Here the=20

fanning became more furious.  "The fact is, Mrs. Dodd," said the squire, "I=
 have been screwing=20

myself up to that point for the last dozen years, but I am close on the age=
 of the patriarchs, and I=20

don't think she'd have me. If you are of a different opinion, Mrs. Dodd, I =
will reconsider the matter;=20

of course it would be most appropriate. There's no fool like an old fool, I=
 suppose."  Was the=20

seemingly innocent squire referring to himself, or had this abominable old =
gentleman the temerity=20

to allude to the wife of the vicar of King's Warren as "an old fool?" Who s=
hall say?  "Do you=20

seriously advise it?" went on her tormentor; "do you think I may dare to ho=
pe?"  But the vicar's wife=20

answered him never a word.  He rose to go and shook hands with her in his u=
sual hearty manner.=20

By no outward sign did Mrs. Dodd manifest her indignation, but when the squ=
ire had left the room=20

she sank into her chair and burst into tears.  "The serpent!" she ejaculate=
d as she pressed her=20

handkerchief to her streaming eyes.  Not one word did Mrs. Dodd utter for m=
any days to her=20

husband of her momentous conversation with the squire. In a statuesque atti=
tude, she sat, like=20

Marius on the ruins of Carthage, or Patience on a monument smiling at grief=
.  And then she=20

thought with horror of the confidence she had made to old Mrs. Wurzel and t=
he brewer's daughter,=20

not an hour before. _On a tire le vin, il faut payer la bouteille._       C=

themselves, and to lend me the money. My word has been given, and I do not =
care what I pay to=20

fulfil my word.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe must not think of such things,=E2=80=
=9D said Mr. Giles, shaking his head. =E2=80=9CAll I want=20

your lordship to understand is the exact position. In this case we have no =
security. Roundells,=20

Giles, and Roundell cannot move without security. It would be against our a=
rticles of partnership.=20

But Mr. Giles, as a private individual, may do what he likes. I will let yo=
ur lordship have the money,=20

and I will take no security whatever=E2=80=94not even a note of hand. All t=
hat I ask for is that your lordship=20

should write me a letter, saying you have urgent need for a sum of money (m=
entioning amount) for=20

an honorable purpose, in which your feelings are deeply interested=E2=80=94=
and that will do. If any thing=20

happens to your lordship before this time next year, why, I think the trust=
ees could hardly refuse=20

repaying the money; and if they did, why then,=E2=80=9D added Mr. Giles, =
=E2=80=9CI suppose it will be all the same=20

a hundred years hence.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou have conferred on me the grea=
test obligation,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with=20

much earnestness. =E2=80=9CLanguage cannot express what I feel. I am not to=
o much used to kindness,=20

and I only hope that I may live to show my sense of yours.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CIt is really no great affair, my lord,=E2=80=9D=20

said Mr. Giles. =E2=80=9CI did not wish to make difficulties, but it was my=
 duty to put the matter clearly=20

before you. What I propose I could to do is really nothing. I could do no l=
ess; I should have felt=20

quite absurd if your lordship had gone into the money-market.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI only hope,=E2=80=9D repeated Lothair,=20

rising and offering Mr. Giles his hand, =E2=80=9Cthat life may give me some=
 occasion to prove my gratitude.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWell, my lord,=E2=80=9D replied Mr. Giles, =E2=80=9Cif your lordsh=

shown in your affairs, you can do that, over and over again, and at once.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow so?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBy a very=20
