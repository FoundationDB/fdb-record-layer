Negroes of these cities, however, cannot be considered exceptions to the ru=
le. Many of those of=20

Philadelphia were of the most ambitious kind, men who had purchased their f=
reedom or had=20

developed sufficient intelligence to delude their would-be captors and conq=
uer the institution of=20

slavery. Settled in this community, the thrifty class accumulated wealth wh=
ich they often used, not=20

only to defray the expenses of educating their own children, but to provide=
 educational facilities for=20

the poor children of color.  Gradually developing the power to help themsel=
ves, the free people of=20

color organized a society which in 1804 opened a school with John Trumbull =
as teacher.[1] About=20

the same time the African Episcopalians founded a colored school at their c=
hurch.[2] A colored=20

man gave three hundred pounds of the required funds to build the first colo=
red schoolhouse in=20

Philadelphia.[3] In 1830 one fourth of the twelve hundred colored children =
in the schools of that=20

city paid for their instruction, whereas only two hundred and fifty were at=
tending the public schools=20

in 1825.[4] The fact that some of the Negroes were able and willing to shar=
e the responsibility of=20

enlightening their people caused a larger number of philanthropists to come=
 to the rescue of those=20

who had to depend on charity. Furthermore, of the many achievements claimed=
 for the colored=20

schools of Philadelphia none were considered more significant than that the=
y produced teachers=20

qualified to carry on this work. Eleven of the sixteen colored schools in P=
hiladelphia in 1822 were=20

taught by teachers of African descent. In 1830 the system was practically i=
n the hands of=20

Negroes.[5]  [Footnote 1: Turner, _The Negro in Pennsylvania_, p. 129.]  [F=
ootnote 2: _Ibid._, p.=20

130.]  [Footnote 3: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 377.=
]  [Footnote 4:=20

_Proceedings of the American Convention_, etc., 1825, p. 13.]  [Footnote 5:=
 _Proceedings of the=20

Am. Convention_, etc., 1830, p.8; and Wickersham, _History of Education in =
Pennsylvania_, p.=20

253.]  The statistics of later years show how successful these early effort=
s had been. By 1849 the=20

colored schools of Philadelphia had developed to the extent that they seeme=
d like a system.=20

According to the _Statistical Inquiry into the Condition of Colored People =
in and about=20

Philadelphia_, published that year, there were 1643 children of color atten=
ding well-regulated=20

schools. The larger institutions were mainly supported by State and charita=
ble organizations of=20

which the Society of Friends and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society were th=
e most important.=20

Besides supporting these institutions, however, the intelligent colored men=
 of Philadelphia had=20

maintained smaller schools and organized a system of lyceums and debating c=
lubs, one of which=20

had a library of 1400 volumes. Moreover, there were then teaching in the co=
lored families and=20

industrial schools of Philadelphia many men and women of both races.[1] Alt=
hough these=20

instructors restricted their work to the teaching of the rudiments of educa=
tion, they did much to=20

help the more advanced schools to enlighten the Negroes who came to that ci=
ty in large numbers=20

when conditions became intolerable for the free people of color in the slav=
e States. The statistics=20

of the following decade show unusual progress. In the year 1859 there were =
in the colored public=20

schools of Philadelphia, 1031 pupils; in the charity schools, 748; in the b=
enevolent schools, 211; in=20

private schools, 331; in all, 2321, whereas in 1849 there were only 1643.[2=
]  [Footnote 1: About=20

the middle of the nineteenth century colored schools of various kinds arose=
 in Philadelphia. With a=20

view to giving Negroes industrial training their friends opened "The School=
 for the Destitute" at the=20

House of Industry in 1848. Three years later Sarah Luciana was teaching a s=
chool of seventy=20

youths at this House of Industry, and the Sheppard School, another industri=
al institution, was in=20

operation in 1850 in a building bearing the same name. In 1849 arose the "C=
orn Street=20



Unclassified School" of forty-seven children in charge of Sarah L. Peltz. "=
The Holmesburg=20

Unclassified School" was organized in 1854. Other institutions of various p=
urposes were "The=20

House of Refuge," "The Orphans' Shelter," and "The Home for Colored Childre=
n." See Bacon,=20

_Statistics of the Colored People of Philadelphia_, 1859.  Among those then=
 teaching in private=20

schools of Philadelphia were Solomon Clarkson, Robert George, John Marshall=
, John Ross,=20

Jonathan Tudas, and David Ware. Ann Bishop, Virginia Blake, Amelia Bogle, A=
nne E. Carey,=20

Sarah Ann Douglass, Rebecca Hailstock, Emma Hall, Emmeline Higgins, Margare=
t Johnson,=20

Martha Richards, Dinah Smith, Mary Still, and one Peterson were teaching in=
 families. See=20

_Statistical Inquiry_, etc., 1849, p. 19; and Bacon, _Statistics of the Col=
ored People of=20

Philadelphia_, 1859.]  [Footnote 2: _Statistical Inquiry into the Condition=
 of the Colored People of=20

Philadelphia_, in 1859.]  Situated like those of Philadelphia, the free bla=
cks of New York City did=20

not have to maintain their own schools. This was especially true after 1832=
 when the colored=20

people had qualified themselves to take over the schools of the New York Ma=
numission Society.=20

They then got rid of all the white teachers, even Andrews, the principal, w=
ho had for years directed=20

this system. Besides, the economic progress of certain Negroes there made p=
ossible the=20

employment of the increasing number of colored teachers, who had availed th=
emselves of the=20

opportunities afforded by the benevolent schools. The stigma then attached =
to one receiving=20

seeming charity through free schools stimulated thrifty Negroes to have the=
ir children instructed=20

either in private institutions kept by friendly white teachers or by teache=
rs of their own color.[1] In=20

1812 a society of the free people of color was organized to raise a fund, t=
he interest of which was=20

to sustain a free school for orphan children.[2] This society succeeded lat=
er in establishing and=20

maintaining two schools. At this time there were in New York City three oth=
er colored schools, the=20

teachers of which received their compensation from those who patronized the=
m.[3]  [Footnote 1:=20

See the Address of the American Convention, 1819.]  [Footnote 2: _Proceedin=
gs of the Am.=20

Convention_, etc., 1812, p. 7.  Certain colored women were then organized t=
o procure and make=20

for destitute persons of color. See Andrews, _History of the New York Afric=
an Free Schools_, p.=20

58.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid._, p. 58.]  Whether from lack of interest in their=
 welfare on the part of the=20

public, or from the desire of the Negroes to share their own burdens, the c=
olored people of Rhode=20

Island were endeavoring to provide for the education of their children duri=
ng the first decades of=20

the last century. _The Newport Mercury_ of March 26, 1808, announced that t=
he African=20

Benevolent Society had opened there a school kept by Newport Gardner, who w=
as to instruct all=20

colored people "inclined to attend." The records of the place show that thi=
s school was in operation=20

eight years later.[1]  [Footnote 1: Stockwell, _History of Ed. in R.I._, p.=
 30.]  In Boston, where were=20

found more Negroes than in most New England communities, the colored people=
 themselves=20

maintained a separate school after the revolutionary era. In the towns of S=
alem, Nantucket, New=20

Bedford, and Lowell the colored schools failed to make much progress after =
the first quarter of the=20

nineteenth century on account of the more liberal construction of the laws =
which provided for=20

democratic education. This the free   That has garnish'd earth with a golde=
n grace?   What is this=20

something that entering me   Changes my life in a minute of space?    When =
I first notic'd the=20

power in his eyes--   Watching to see if they praise or condemn,   Blushing=
 to meet them--came=20

into the skies   Beauty that never has vanish'd from them.    When I first =
stopp'd in the midst of my=20

mirth,   While my heart beat in a tremulous way   Only to see him,--came ov=
er the earth,   Glory=20



that earth has retain'd to this day.    When the first whisper assaulted my=
 ear,   When the first=20

pressure astonish'd my hand,   When I first fancied that _I_ might be dear-=
-   Life was a miracle=20

joyous and grand.    When he first woo'd me with prayers, for his own,   Su=
ddenly came an eclipse=20

of the light:   Sighing, I wish'd he would let me alone;   Smiling, I long'=
d to hide out of his sight.=20

Life being lit by a fairy-like gleam,   Sparkling and glittering, tender an=
d pure,   Was not he stupid=20

to change such a dream   Into reality tame and secure?    'Tis sweet to fin=
d I am wrong in the=20

thought,   Joy is but brighter for being confess'd;   Every moment has happ=
iness brought,   Every=20

stage of true love is the best.       They wish me at home to sit and to se=
w--   And I like to do what=20

my aunt thinks right--   But the stitching never seem'd half so slow,   Nor=
 zigzagg'd itself as it did=20

one night.    And my work kept slipping out of my hand   As wonderful thoug=
hts came into my=20

head:   Sure, life is becoming too bright and grand   To be given up to nee=
dles and thread!    I was=20

thinking of words that Harry spake,   And of looks that more than mere word=
s betray,   With a joy=20

as pure as the first snow-flake,   And almost as ready to melt away.    And=
 with little tears=20

beginning to start,   And with smiles and blushes that come and go;   And I=
 did not know what was=20

in my heart,   Or else I pretended I did not know!    O sudden awaking from=
 dream so fair!   'Tis the=20

voice of my aunt, and I hear it say--   'Child, are you falling asleep in y=
our chair?   Will you _ever_=20

finish that collar, May?'    I caught up my work (I knew I was wrong),   De=
termin'd to finish it ere we=20

sup;   But something within me, for me too strong,   Conquer'd myself, and =
I _had_ to give up.=20

'O, my Aunt Bridget,' I timidly said,   'I am _tired_ of stitching--I _want=
_ to rest;   O let me gather=20

the roses instead,   The young little roses the first and best.'    Soft su=
mmer twilights caressing the=20

air   Have buried the garden in lovely gloom;   But I knew that the eageres=
t roses there   Were just=20

beginning to think they might bloom.    The pretty wee stars kept peeping a=
bout,   And even peep'd=20

in through our prison bars,   As she gravely said, 'Who ever went out   To =
gather a rose by the light=20

of stars?'    My heart beat fast at the beautiful phrase;   She had not int=
ended it, I suppose,   But I=20

felt I could love her all my days,   If under the stars I might pluck one r=
ose!    Pleading my cause in=20

so ardent a way,   Almost evoking an answering glow,   Crying, 'You once we=
re as young and as=20

gay'--   Then, she smil'd a little and let me go.    'Twas pleasure enough =
to be out of doors;   I=20

look'd at the stars and I felt content:   But it never rains, you know, but=
 it pours,   And the path that=20

I _had_ to go--I went!    Playing with fancies, in fanciful play,   'If I w=
ant a rose,' I demurely said,   'I=20

must look for an omen to point the way,   And I must look for it over my he=
ad.'    So I found a star=20

that shone in the sky,   And mark'd how it glitter'd down on a tree,   And =
felt--but I swear that I=20

know not why--   There grow the roses intended for me!    And as I approach=
 the shadowy boughs=20

That are spreading out over earth and air,   A gay little miracle fate allo=
ws,   And the star appears=20

to be sparkling there!    Gladly I ran o'er the daisy-clad plain,   Led by =
the shimmering light of the=20

star,   And under the tree I found--Harry Vane   Lying, and smoking a 'mild=
 cigar!'    I started=20

astonish'd--he stood upright,   And said, in a voice persuasively kind,   '=
Don't you _know_ that I=20

come here every night,   To see your shadow flit by on the blind?'    I loo=
k'd where he pointed, as if=20

'twas I   Could see my own phantom flicker and pass,--   And _Aunt Bridget'=
s_ shadow mov'd=20

solemnly by,   Over the canvas that hangs by the glass!    Oh, how could we=
 help it?--we laugh'd=20

aloud   (Birds never cease their sweet voices in spring;   And I think in y=
outh little laughters crowd=20

And spring to our lips at everything!)    In laughter we lost all sense of =
surprise;   It seem'd only=20

natural we should meet;   And a star shot flaming across the skies,   And a=
 little glow-worm=20



gleam'd at my feet.    And a distant bell swung its solemn chime,   That se=
em'd to me like the voice=20

of a star;   And I think, through a century of time,   I shall always belie=
ve that such things are.=20

And then--it was then--he spoke, and I heard;   And the moon rose up, and t=
he stars grew dim,=20

And all of a sudden the nightingale-bird   Triumphantly chanted her jubilan=
t hymn.       What are=20

you singing about, little birds,   Twittering loudly in lime-tree and oak? =
  Telling each other the=20

wonderful words   On a sweet May evening a lover spoke?    Butterflies, flo=
ating away from the=20

trees,   With blossom-like wings of delicate dye,   You are bearing tidings=
 certain to please,=20

Scatter them freely, but do not ask why.    Two lovers stood 'neath a star-=
lighted sky,   Half=20

fearfully touching enchanted ground:   One lover was Harry, and one was I, =
  And the world went=20

merrily round and round.    Souls rushing together from distant parts,   Vo=
ws utter'd that cannot be=20

ever undone;   A minute ago two lives and two hearts,   Through time and et=
ernity now but one.=20

O foolish butterflies! chattering birds!   Instinct in vain with humanity s=
trives;   You can't understand=20

the wonderful words   Or magical kisses that changed two lives!       What =
is Nature made for? is it=20

for us   The beautiful world is burnish'd and blent?   If we had not eyes, =
would blossoms shine=20

thus?   If we had not nostrils, would they have scent?    I heard a philoso=
pher say--in isles=20

Surrounded by ocean, apart, alone,   With no living creature to reckon mile=
s,   Wherein life had=20

never been born or known,    That the clouds with electric flash may meet, =
  And thunder may=20

rattle its dreadful breath,   Yet never a sound break the rest complete,   =
Or the silence of this=20

eternal death;    That the fierce storm-wind may bluster and blow,   Tearin=
g the trees from the root-

broken ground,   Or the wild sea-surf may leap and may flow   In solemn sil=
ence with never a=20

sound.    For sound is but the vibrations of air   That strike on the drum =
of the living ear;   So if=20

never a living ear is there,   There is nothing to strike and nothing to he=
ar.    Though the vibrations=20

move on, and live,   And thus the law of their being obey,   'Tis the ear p=
roduces the sound they=20

give--   That's what I heard a philosopher say.    So if thunder, roll'd th=
rough quivering air,   With=20

that awful silence reigning around,   And you or I suddenly landed there,  =
 All Nature would break=20

at once into sound.    It seems very strange and eerie, you know;   I don't=
 understand how it is--do=20

you?   But a philosopher said it, so   I really suppose that it must be tru=
e.    And is not there=20

something in human hearts   (Mountains, you know, must spring out of the fl=
at)   That at Love's=20

light touch into music starts?   Ah, what would philosophers say to _that_?=
       There never was=20

summer so bright as this,   And the world will=20


_
the reason that the seeming onerous task of supporting a dual system often =
caused the neglect,=20

and sometimes the extinction of the separate schools. Furthermore, either t=
he Negroes of some of=20

these towns were too scarce or the movement to furnish them special facilit=
ies of education=20

started too late to escape the attacks of the abolitionists. Seeing their m=
istake of first establishing=20

separate schools, they began to attack caste in public education.  In the e=
astern cities where=20

colored school systems thereafter continued, the work was not always succes=
sful. The influx of=20

fugitives in the rough sometimes jeopardized their chances for education by=
 menacing liberal=20

communities with the trouble of caring for an undesirable class. The friend=
s of the Negroes,=20

however, received more encouragement during the two decades immediately pre=
ceding the Civil=20

War. There was a change in the attitude of northern cities toward the uplif=
t of the colored refugees.=20

Catholics, Protestants, and abolitionists often united their means to make =
provision for the=20

education of accessible Negroes, although these friends of the oppressed co=
uld not always agree=20

on other important schemes. Even the colonizationists, the object of attack=
 from the ardent=20

antislavery element, considerably aided the cause. They educated for work i=
n Liberia a number of=20

youths, who, given the opportunity to attend good schools, demonstrated the=
 capacity of the=20

colored people. More important factors than the colonizationists were the f=
ree people of color.=20

Brought into the rapidly growing urban communities, these Negroes began to =
accumulate=20

sufficient wealth to provide permanent schools of their own. Many of these =
were later assimilated=20

by the systems of northern cities when their separate schools were disestab=
lished.     CHAPTER=20

VII  THE REACTION   Encouraging as had been the movement to enlighten the N=
egroes, there=20

had always been at work certain reactionary forces which impeded the intell=
ectual progress of the=20

colored people. The effort to enlighten them that they might be emancipated=
 to enjoy the political=20

rights given white men, failed to meet with success in those sections where=
 slaves were found in=20

large numbers. Feeling that the body politic, as conceived by Locke and Mon=
tesquieu, did not=20

include the slaves, many citizens opposed their education on the ground tha=
t their mental=20

improvement was inconsistent with their position as persons held to service=
. For this reason there=20

was never put forward any systematic effort to elevate the slaves. Every ma=
ster believed that he=20

had a divine right to deal with the situation as he chose. Moreover, even b=
efore the policy of=20

mental and moral improvement of the slaves could be given a trial, some col=
onists, anticipating the=20

"evils of the scheme," sought to obviate them by legislation. Such we have =
observed was the case=20

in Virginia,[1] South Carolina,[2] and Georgia.[3] To control the assemblie=
s of slaves, North=20

Carolina,[4] Delaware,[5] and Maryland[6] early passed strict regulations f=
or their inspection.=20

[Footnote 1: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p. 391.]  [Foo=
tnote 2: Brevard,=20

_Digest of the Public Statute Law of S.C._, vol. ii., p.243.]  [Footnote 3:=
 Marbury and Crawford,=20

_Digest of Laws of the State of Georgia_, p. 438.]  [Footnote 4: _Laws of N=
orth Carolina_, vol. i.,=20

pp. 126, 563, and 741.]  [Footnote 5: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of E=
d._, 1871, p. 335.]=20

[Footnote 6: _Ibid._, p. 352.]  The actual opposition of the masters to the=
 mental improvement of=20

Negroes, however, did not assume sufficiently large proportions to prevent =
the intellectual=20

progress of that race, until two forces then at work had had time to become=
 effective in arousing=20

southern planters to the realization of what a danger enlightened colored m=
en would be to the=20

institution of slavery. These forces were the industrial revolution and the=
 development of an=20

insurrectionary spirit among slaves, accelerated by the rapid spreading of =
the abolition agitation.=20



The industrial revolution was effected by the multiplication of mechanical =
appliances for spinning=20

and weaving which so influenced the institution of slavery as seemingly to =
doom the Negroes to=20

heathenism. These inventions were the spinning jenny, the steam engine, the=
 power loom, the=20

wool-combing machine, and the cotton gin. They augmented the output of spin=
ning mills, and in=20

cheapening cloth, increased the demand by bringing it within the reach of t=
he poor. The result was=20

that a revolution was brought about not only in Europe, but also in the Uni=
ted States to which the=20

world looked for this larger supply of cotton fiber.[1] This demand led to =
the extension of the=20

plantation system on a larger scale. It was unfortunate, however, that many=
 of the planters thus=20

enriched, believed that the slightest amount of education, merely teaching =
slaves to read, impaired=20

their value because it instantly destroyed their contentedness. Since they =
did not contemplate=20

changing their condition, it was surely doing them an ill service to destro=
y their acquiescence in it.=20

This revolution then had brought it to pass that slaves who were, during th=
e eighteenth century=20

advertised as valuable on account of having been   For if Love the magical =
painter is,   He for ever=20

will paint the same for us.    'Tis a light within that illumes the land;  =
 And free as the birds from=20

sorrow or strife,   Very close together, and hand in hand,   We shall walk =
on through unlimited life.=20

'Ah, Harry!' I cried, 'I shall lean on _you_!   'Tis the purest joy to look=
 up so high;   You will teach=20

 hope that you know I am=20

very weak,   Only a poor little thing at the best;   But children can love =
before they can speak,=20

And I hope that love will make up the rest.'    Oh beautiful pathway, untou=

scattered roses on which we tread;   You lead to a church with its holy pra=

blessing over us shed!       Nightingales singing an exquisite tune   All t=

Stars in the depth of a fathomless space,   Summer-blue sky by no shadow o'=

on to a far-away grace   Brighter than e'en the beneficent past;    Trouble=
 to measureless=20

distances fled,   Death too remote to be worthy a sigh--   Can there be any=

Sorrow or death 'neath a summer-blue sky!    Was there a moment we never ha=

there a time unexalted by him?   Shone the same lustre in suns when they se=

river with joy to the brim?    Glitter'd the blue over heaven and sea?   Fl=
utter'd the birds to a=20

musical call?   Could he be happy unconscious of me?   And, without Harry, =
what was I at all?    I=20

stand on a rock where two rivers meet,   With a life behind and a life befo=
re;   And one is ebbing=20

away from my feet,   And the other is rising more and more.    Ah, poor lit=
tle maiden! ah, dear little=20

wife!   Ah, days that are past and days that will come!   The past is nothi=
ng--this only is life;   I am=20

going with _him_ and am going HOME.       And such a sweet pretty home as i=
t is!   What shall I=20

do with my exquisite bliss?   How can I ever be charming enough,   Where ru=
mpling a roseleaf will=20

make the path rough?   How can I thank the great Father above   For showing=
 His child such=20

abundance of love?   With Harry a home in a hovel were sweet,   And this is=
 a palace that lies at=20

my feet.    I look at the gardens spread out in the sun,   Where every rose=
bud a prize might have=20

won;   Where lilies lift up tinted crowns to the skies,   And clematis stri=
ke you aghast by their size;=20

Where lawns smooth as ice tempt your feet as they pass,   Though only a fai=
ry should tread on=20

such grass;   And big forest trees on the slopes, spread afar   Those branc=
hes that grander than=20

anything are.    I sweep through the rooms where the mirrors portray   A sl=
ender young thing in a=20

robe of pale gray,   And catching quick glimpses, now here and now there,  =
 I own with delight she=20



is graceful and fair;   I study the creature, and smile as I see   How hand=
some a woman one day=20

she may be;   I draw myself up with a stately expanse   And try to look gra=
nd, while I'm longing to=20

dance;   I flourish, I curtsey, I slip and I slide;--   This will do for a =
wife, this is fit for a bride.   I smile=20

and I bow, in a dignified way,   And even shake hands with the lady in gray=
;   Then draw back=20

astonish'd, afraid to offend,   It is all a mistake, and she is not a frien=
d.   In a moment sweeps over=20

the vision a change   Deliciously sweet and suddenly strange,   A blush in =
the cheek and a light in=20

the eyes;--   A step in the passage, to meet it she flies,   And still in t=
he mirror I mark the embrace,=20

Where the strong manly arms hide the small blushing face.       When the su=
n rises early to call=20

people out,   There is nothing so sweet as to wander about,   A hand on an =
arm or an arm round a=20

waist,   In lover-like leisure or holiday haste.   Then, all is delightful =
we see or we hear,   And=20

speaking or silence are equally dear;   The earth at our feet of an emerald=
 hue,   The Heaven=20

above us incredibly blue,   The flowers baptiz'd with miraculous dew.    Wh=

to welcome the sun,   Through the gay gardens we stroll and we run;   In fi=
elds where lambs=20

 Birds unexpectedly set=20

chaps. i. and ii.]=20

With the rise of this system, and the attendant increased importation of sl=
aves, came the end of=20

the helpful contact of servants with their masters. Slavery was thereby cha=
nged from a patriarchal=20

to an economic institution. Thereafter most owners of extensive estates aba=
ndoned the idea that=20

the mental improvement of slaves made them better servants. Doomed then to =
be half-fed, poorly=20

clad, and driven to death in this cotton kingdom, what need had the slaves =
for education? Some=20

planters hit upon the seemingly more profitable scheme of working newly imp=
orted slaves to death=20

during seven years and buying another supply rather than attempt to humaniz=
e them.[1] Deprived=20

thus of helpful advice and instruction, the slaves became the object of pit=
y not only to abolitionists=20

of the North but also to some southerners.   Fraught with a meaning life ne=

_
few of these reformers, therefore, favored the extermination of the institu=
tion. Others advocated=20

the expansion of slavery not to extend the influence of the South, but to d=
isperse the slaves with a=20

view to bringing about a closer contact between them and their masters.[2] =
This policy was duly=20

emphasized during the debate on the admission of the State of Missouri.  [F=

Session, vol. i., pp. 996 _et seq._ and 1296 _et seq._]  Seeking to direct =
the attention of the world=20

to the slavery of men's bodies and minds the abolitionists spread broadcast=
 through the South=20

newspapers, tracts, and pamphlets which, whether or not they had much effec=
t in inducing=20

masters to improve the condition of their slaves, certainly moved Negroes t=
hemselves. It hardly=20

required enlightenment to convince slaves that they would be better off as =
freemen than as=20

dependents whose very wills were subject to those of their masters. Accordi=
ngly even in the=20

seventeenth century there developed in the minds of bondmen the spirit of r=
esistance. The white=20

settlers of the colonies held out successfully in putting down the early ri=
ots of Negroes. When the=20

increasing intelligent Negroes of the South, however, observed in the aboli=
tion literature how the=20

condition of the American slaves differed from that of the ancient servants=
 and even from what it=20

once had been in the United States; when they fully realized their intolera=
ble condition compared=20

with that of white men, who were clamoring for liberty and equality, there =
rankled in the bosom of=20

slaves that insurrectionary passion productive of the daring uprisings whic=
h made the chances for=20

the enlightenment of colored people poorer than they had ever been in the h=
istory of this country.=20

The more alarming insurrections of the first quarter of the nineteenth cent=

cause of the most reactionary measures. It was easily observed that these m=

to the mental improvement of the colored   When were you actual? how did yo=
