eyes a little misty Ethel saw striding along at her side a sturdy little ol=
d lady in black. And she=20

blessed her fervently. It was a thrilling marvellous time. In less than ten=
 minutes she felt herself=20

boon companions with every one in her line. But then, before she realized w=
hat it was that had=20

happened, her group had reached the end of their march and had melted sudde=
nly into a throng of=20

chattering laughing women. Ethel stared about her blindly.   "Never mind," =
she decided, "I'm going=20

to see more of this!"  And the next day she presented herself at suffrage h=
eadquarters.  "I want to=20

work," she said to a girl at a desk. The girl looked up at her busily.  "Al=
l right, go to that table," she=20

answered. And at a long oak table, one of a dozen women and girls, Ethel fo=
lded envelopes and=20

addressed them for about three hours. Down at the end, two girl companions =
chatted and laughed=20

at their labour. But the rest were just busy. "Hand me those envelopes, if =
you please." And so it=20

was all through the room. She came back the next morning and the next; and =
as she worked, her=20

ork of moving up to her=20

tlessness, as=20

thousands of New Yorkers prepared to change their quarters. Moving, always =
moving. Did they=20

never stop in one place and make it a home? The big building in which Ethel=
 lived took on an=20

impersonal air, as though saying, "What do I care? I'm all concrete, with g=
