in the minority is an oxymoron:  "In democracies the middle class is the na=
tion proper. The typical=20

member of a national community is a member of the middle class. When democr=
atic governments=20

need a social group they can address, a universal class that carries the ov=
erarching, common=20

interest of the country, they appeal to the middle class. This appeal, whil=
e it calls on a common=20

interest, also acknowledges that there are conflicting interests within soc=
iety. The middle class is=20

not everyone, but it is the majority and it represents what everyone else c=
an become."  Russia has=20

a long way to go to achieve this ubiquity. Its middle class, far from repre=
senting the consensus,=20

reifies the growing abyss between haves and haves not. Its members' conspic=
uous consumption,=20

mostly of imports, does little to support the local economy. Its political =
might is self-serving. It has=20

no ethos, or distinct morality, no narrative, or ideology. The Russian midd=
le class is at a=20

Hobbesian and primordial stage.  Whether it emerges from its narcissistic c=
ocoon to become a=20

leading and guiding social force, is doubtful. The middle class' youth, urb=
aneness,=20

cosmopolitanism, polyglotism, mobility, avarice and drive are viewed with s=

the great unwashed - the overwhelming majority of Russia's destitute popula=
tion. Empowered by=20

their wealth, the new bourgeoisie, in turn, regards the "people" with naive=
 admiration, patronizing=20

condescension, or horror.  Granted, this muted, subterranean, interaction i=
s not entirely=20

deleterious. It is the social role of the rich to generate demand by provok=
ing in the poor jealousy=20

and attempts at emulation. The wealthy are the trendsetters, the early adop=
ters, the pioneers, the=20

buzz leaders. They are the engine that engenders social and economic mobili=
ty.  A similar=20

dynamic is admittedly evident in Russia - but, again, it is tampered by a c=
urious local=20

phenomenon.  Writing for the Globalist, two Brookings Institution scholars,=
 Carol Graham, a Senior=20

Fellow of Economic Studies and Clifford Gaddy, a Fellow of Foreign Policy a=
nd Governance=20

Studies described it thus:  "The eyes of Russia's middle class, on the othe=
r hand, are figuratively=20

directed downward, towards the poor. In fact, as poverty in Russia increase=
d dramatically in the=20

1990s, the middle class's reference norms shifted downward as well. As a re=
sult, Russia may be=20

the only country in the world where the "subjective poverty line" is fallin=
g.  That is, the amount of=20

money that Russians say that they need in order to stay out of poverty has =
been steadily falling=20

over the past five years. It is even below the objective poverty line. For =
the time being, at least,=20

these curious Russian attitudes, along with the existence of the non-moneta=
ry virtual economy,=20

have insulated the country against political upheaval."  The list of anomal=
ies is not exhausted.=20

The new middle class comprises the embryonic legitimate business elite - en=
trepreneurs,=20

professionals and managers - but not the remnants of the financially strapp=
ed intelligentsia. It is=20

brawn with little brains. In dissonance with western Europe, according to a=
 survey published in the=20

last two years by Expert magazine, the majority of its members are national=
istic, authoritarian and=20

xenophobic. Their self-interested economic liberalism is coupled with socia=
l and political=20

intolerance. But two thirds of them support some kind of welfare state.  Th=
us, there are major=20

differences between the middle class in the West and its ostensible counter=
part in Russia.  The=20

Russian parvenus - many of them women - do not believe their state, their b=
anks, or their=20

compatriots. They fear a precarious future and its inevitable calamities th=
ough they are not risk=20

averse and are rather optimistic in the short run. They keep their money un=
der the proverbial=20

mattress, invest it surreptitiously in their ventures, or smuggle it abroad=
. They are not - yet -=20

stakeholders in their country's stability and prosperity.  Often bamboozled=
 by other businessmen=20



and fleeced by a rapacious bureaucracy, they are paranoid. Tax evasion is s=
till rampant, though=20

abating. They trust in equity and avoid debt. Some of them have criminal ro=
ots or a criminal=20

mindset - or are former members of Russia's shady security services.  Three=
 fifths, according to=20

the Expert-Komkon survey, find it "hard to survive" when "observing all law=
s". "Strong leaders are=20

better than all sorts of laws" is their motto, quoted by Izvestia. Generall=
y, they are closer to being=20

robbers than barons.  Early capitalism is always unruly. It is transformed =
into a highly structured=20

edifice by the ownership of land and realty (the prime collateral), the pro=
tection of private property,=20

a functioning financial system comprised of both banks and capital markets =
and the just and=20

expedient application of the rule of law.  Russia has none of these. Accord=
ing to Business Week,=20

bank deposits amount to 4 percent of the country's mid-size GDP - compared =
to half of GDP in=20

other industrialized countries. Mortgages are unheard of, deposits are not =
insured and land=20

swathes of the land.  The state and the oligarchs continue to represent a r=
ent-seeking opportunity.=20

Businessmen spend time seeking concessions, permits, exemptions and license=
s rather than=20

conducting business. The "civic institutions" they form - chambers of comme=
rce, clubs - are often=20

mere glorified lobbying outfits of special and vested interests. Informal n=
etworks of contacts count=20

more than any statute or regulation. In such a mock "modern state" no wonde=

with a Potemkin "middle class".  Russia in 2003  By: Dr. Sam Vaknin  Also p=
ublished by United=20

Press International (UPI)  Contrary to recent impressions, Russia's Western=
 (American-German)=20

orientation is at least as old as Gorbachev's reign. It was vigorously with=
 pale-face mariners eager=20

to exchange guns and hatchets and beads for the furs of the animals trapped=
 in the northern=20

wilderness.  Many European ships--often over a hundred sail--came every yea=
r to Newfoundland=20

to the cod-fisheries off that coast, and some of these sailed onward into t=
he Gulf and on to=20

Tadoussac, and even as far as Three Rivers.  At these places fur-trading st=
ations were set up, and=20

hither repaired each season the hardy mariners, who were not slow to discov=
er more profit in=20

Europe out of sable and beaver skins than out of cod-fish.  Those wild anim=
als, whose fur was=20

esteemed in France and {12} other lands, were so plentiful in Canada that i=
n course of time the=20

peltry trade, as it was called, grew to be the principal business of the co=
untry.  As each spring=20

came round the savage tribes, whose hunting-grounds were far in the interio=
r, would pack their=20

furs in canoes and paddle hundreds of miles down the lakes and rivers to th=
e post where the white=20

trader was awaiting them.  When the Indian had bartered his furs, back he p=
addled again to his=20

own hunting-grounds, and the trader in turn sailed back to France, to retur=
n the next season.=20

Meanwhile, too, English sailors, lieges to the great Elizabeth, had been vi=
siting the New World=20

which Cabot had claimed for England. First there came Martin Frobisher in 1=
576, who, looking for=20

a short route to India, set foot on the shores of Labrador.  Again, on the =
other side of the continent,=20

Sir Francis Drake, sailing round the world, sighted the snowy peaks on the =
borders of British=20

Columbia, which afterwards became a part of the Canadian Dominion.  Then ca=
me Sir Humphrey=20

Gilbert, half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, with 260 men and several ships=
, to plant a colony in=20

Newfoundland.  Sir Humphrey's sovereign mistress, Elizabeth, had graciously=
 granted him a=20

charter of 600 miles in every direction from St. John's, whereby he became =
lord and master of=20

what we know to-day as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, an=
d parts of=20

Labrador and Quebec. It was on a serene August morning that the fleet reach=
ed harbour. Donning=20



his most gorgeous doublet of lace and velvet, and surrounded by his stalwar=
t retainers, Sir {13}=20

Humphrey landed at St. John's and took possession of Newfoundland in Elizab=
eth's name.  When=20

he had reconnoitred the coast, our courtier resolved to return with his peo=
ple to England for=20

provisions and reinforcements.  Nowadays many of our bravest sailors would =
be afraid to trust=20

themselves in the little ships that formed his fleet.  They were very short=
, curved, and blunt, and,=20

compared to our modern floating castles, were only giant cockle-shells.  A =
few days out a=20

hurricane arose, and in the midst of the raging seas Sir Humphrey's ship, t=
he _Squirrel_, was=20

doomed.  But not even his dreadful fate, when it loomed around him, could f=
ill the brave=20

commander's soul with fear.  With waves careering mast-high he sat placidly=
 on deck with a Bible=20

on his lap. "Cheer up, lads," cried he to his sailors, "we are as near heav=
en on sea as on land."=20

And so the cruel billows rolled over the _Squirrel_, and it and the brave s=
ouls it bore were lost for=20

ever. The expedition from which so much had been hoped in England was an ut=
ter failure.  It was=20

the sons of France who were destined to found and people Canada, and to per=
form such deeds of=20

daring valour and endurance as are not to be surpassed in the history of ou=
r own island=20

motherland.  Englishmen, it is true, were to have all Canada at last, but n=
early two hundred years=20

were to roll by before their soldiers could wrest the mainland from their h=
ereditary rivals.  Fifteen=20

years had passed since Sir Humphrey Gilbert went down in the little _Squirr=
el_, when a French=20

noble, the Marquis de la Roche, received a commission from King Henry the F=
ourth of France {14}=20

to colonise Canada.  With the commission in his pocket the Marquis knew not=
 which way to turn.=20

It was not easy in those days to find Frenchmen ready to live in a country =
supposed to be ice and=20

snow the whole year round.  But "where there's a will there's a way," and t=
he Marquis at last chose=20

fifty sturdy convicts from the prisons and galleys, and, embarking with his=
 retinue, set sail for the=20

West.  A long low sandbank called Sable Island guards the entrance to St. L=
awrence Gulf, and=20

here the Viceroy set forty of his convicts ashore while he explored the wat=
ers roundabout.  At first=20

the marooned convicts were delighted with their freedom.  They roamed hithe=
r and thither, finding=20

a lagoon of fresh water, frequented by wild cattle and coveys of wild ducks=
.  Sweet berries=20

flourished in abundance. During all that summer the convicts amused themsel=
ves, keeping a=20

sharp look-out for the return of their lord and master, the Marquis, who ha=
d gone to find them a=20

haven to settle in and build their dwellings.  Day succeeded day, week foll=
owed week, but the=20

Marquis never came back.  A violent storm had arisen which drove his vessel=
 eastward across the=20

wide Atlantic to the very shores of France, where the hapless nobleman was =
seized by a powerful=20

enemy and cast into prison.  Can you not picture the rage and despair of th=
e unhappy men on=20

Sable Island when they realised their plight?  Winter was fast approaching,=
 and they had neither=20

proper food, fuel, nor raiment. Quarrelling fiercely, they slew one another=
, while those who were=20

left, huddled together in rude huts formed of wreckage, lived on raw {15} f=
lesh and dressed=20

themselves in the hides of wild cattle.  They gave themselves up for lost, =
but at length the Marquis=20

de la Roche, far away in France, was able to tell the King of the predicame=
nt of the abandoned=20

convicts.  A ship was sent out to rescue them, and, like so many wild anima=
ls, with long matted=20

hair and beards, they grovelled at the feet of their deliverers.  After suc=
h hardships as they had=20

undergone, King Henry was not the one to send them back to prison; he=20


_
pursued by Yeltsin. Still, 2002 marks the year in which Russia became merel=
y another satellite of=20

the United States - though one armed with an ageing nuclear arsenal.  Russi=
a's economy has=20

revived remarkably after the 1998 crisis, but it is still addicted to Weste=
rn investments, aid and=20

credits. Encircled by NATO to its West and US troops stationed in its centr=
al Asian hinterland,=20

Russia's capitulation is complete. In the aftermath of conflicts to be engi=
neered by the United=20

States in Afghanistan, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Syria and, potentially, Cub=
a - Russia may feel=20

threatened geopolitically as well as economically. Both Iran and Iraq, for =
instance, are large=20

trading partners and leading export destinations of the Russian Federation.=
  If anything can undo=20

the hitherto impressive personality cult of Russia's new "strong man", Vlad=
imir Putin, it is this=20

injured pride among the more penumbral ranks of the country's security serv=
ices. Russia's history=20

is littered with the bloodied remains of upheavals wrought by violent ideol=
ogical minorities and by=20

assorted conspirators.  Hence Putin's tentative - and reluctant - attempts =
to team up with China=20

and India to establish a multi-polar world and his closer military cooperat=
ion with Kyrgyzstan and=20

Armenia - both intended to counter nationalistic opposition at home.  Lucki=
ly, the sense of decline=20

is by no means prevalent.  Russians polled by the American Pew Research Cen=
ter admitted that=20

they feel much better in a world dominated by the United States as a single=
 superpower. The KGB=20

and its successors - Putin's former long-term employers - actually engineer=
ed Russia's opening to=20

the West and the president's meteoric ascendancy. And no one in the army se=
riously disputes the=20

need for reform, professionalization and merciless trimming of the bloated =
corps.  Reforms - of the=20

military, Russia's decrepit utilities, dilapidated infrastructure and housi=
ng, inflated and venal=20

bureaucracy, corrupt judiciary and civil service, choking monopolies and pe=
rnicious to their homes.=20

De la Roche, broken in health and fortune, died soon after, so this project=
 for starting a colony=20

was, as you see, not a whit luckier than Cartier's or Roberval's or Sir Hum=
phrey Gilbert's had=20

been.  Was the next attempt to reap greater success?  In that summer of 159=
9, when the convicts=20

were still on Sable Island, to the north of them, in the Gulf of St. Lawren=
ce, fur-trading ships=20

pressed forward under full canvas to the westward.  These ships were owned =
by two men of King=20

Henry's Huguenot subjects, named Pontgrav and Chauvin, who had formed thems=
elves into a=20

partnership to buy and sell furs.  No trader could lift a finger in those d=
ays without a royal charter=20

or patent, and these men were influential enough to get a charter from the =
King bestowing upon=20

them the exclusive right to the fur trade of Canada.  It was hardly likely =
they could really make=20

good such a right, or that the other Frenchmen who had been buying furs fro=
m the Indians would=20

thereafter stop buying them on account of it.  But it was a safe precaution=
, and {16} made their=20

rivals' operations illegal.  On their part Pontgrav and Chauvin promised th=
e King that they would=20

settle in Canada 500 colonists.  In this they were promising more than they=
 could perform; the=20

most they actually did do was to induce sixteen men to remain all winter at=
 Tadoussac, with=20

insufficient food, clothing, and shelter.  Alas! when the ships from France=
 appeared in the St.=20

Lawrence next year, the last year of the sixteenth century, they found most=
 of the sixteen dead.=20

Their surviving companions had married native wives and gone to live in the=
 wigwams of the=20

Indians.  Once more you see this enterprise had not fared any better than t=
hose which had gone=20

before, and, like the others, Chauvin died recognising bitterly that his sc=
heme was a failure.  How=20

was it with his partner, Pontgrav?  Pontgrav was only a trader, but he was =
of dogged tenacity.  He=20

saw that if Canada could be colonised by his countrymen, there was a great =

ge in the value of the=20

"black gold". But the windfall has helped mask pressing problems and allowe=
d timid legislators and=20

officials to postpone much needed - and fiercely resisted - changes.  Russi=
a's "economic miracle"=20

- oft-touted by the "experts" that brought you "shock therapy" and by egreg=
iously self-interested,=20

Moscow-based, investment bankers - is mostly prestidigitation. As the Europ=
ean Bank for=20

Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) correctly noted in November, Russia's=
 20 percent=20

growth in the last three years merely reflects enhanced usage of capacity i=
dled by the ruination of=20

1998.  Neutering the positive externality of rising oil prices, one is left=
 with no increase in=20

productivity since 1999. Industrial production - outside the oil sector - a=
ctually slumped. As=20

metropolitan incomes rise, Russians revert to imports rather than of the fu=

do it, he reasoned, was to bring his chief rivals together to form a compan=
y, so that, instead of=20

being enemies, all would work together to keep out the smaller traders or "=
pirates," and gradually=20

establish proper trading-posts in Canada. An influential and wealthy old so=
ldier named Aymar de=20

Chastes, Governor of Rouen, interested himself in the scheme, and, being hi=
gh in favour with the=20

King of France, he procured a charter and set about seeing if he and his fr=
iends could not succeed=20

where the others had been so signally defeated.  {17}  We have now reached =
the point in our story=20

at which Samuel de Champlain, the real founder of New France, enters upon t=
