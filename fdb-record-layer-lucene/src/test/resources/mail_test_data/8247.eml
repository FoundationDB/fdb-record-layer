regard myself as her property. [_He looks about._] What was that? a sigh that arose from the 

leaves? It cannot be.      The heated breezes heat the leaves,     The wetted garment wets the 

leaves,     And so, I guess, the scattered leaves     Curl up like any other leaves. 

46  [_Vasantasena begins to recover consciousness, and stretches out her hand._]  P. 222.12] 

_Monk._ Ah, there appears a woman's hand, adorned with beautiful gems. What! a second hand? 

[_He examines it with the greatest care._] It seems to me, I recognize this hand. Yes, there is no 

doubt about it. Surely, this is the hand that saved me. But I must see for myself. [_He uncovers the 

body, looks at it, and recognizes it._] It _is_ my sister in Buddha. [_Vasantasena pants for water._] 

Ah, she seeks water, and the pond is far away. What shall I do? An idea! I will hold this robe over 

her and let it drip upon her. [_He does so. Vasantasena recovers consciousness, and raises 

herself. The monk fans her with his garment._]  _Vasantasena._ Who are you, sir?  _Monk._ Has 

my sister in grand monarch to the bourgeois or the lackey.  La Fontaine's language escapes from 

the limitations of the classical school of the seventeenth century; his manifold reading in elder 

French literature enriched his vocabulary; he seems to light by instinct upon the most exact and 

happiest word. Yet we know that the perfection of his art was attained only as the result of untiring 

diligence; indolent and careless as he was in worldly affairs, he was an indefatigable craftsman in 

poetry. His verse is as free as it is fine; it can accomplish whatever it intends; now it is light and 

swift, but when needful it can be grave and even magnificent:     "_Aurait-il imprime sur le front des 

etoiles     Ce que la nuit des temps enferme dans ses voiles?_"  It is verse which depends on no 

mechanical rules imposed from without; its life and movement come from within, and the lines 

vary, like a breeze straying among blossoms, with every stress or relaxation of the writer's mood. 

While La Fontaine derives much from antiquity, he may be regarded as incarnating more than any 

other writer of his

she bought for ten gold-pieces?  _Vasantasena._ I seem to remember, but not just as you say. It 

were better that I had slept never to waken.  _Monk._ What happened here, sister in Buddha? 

_Vasantasena._ [_Despairingly._] Nothing but what is fitting--for a courtezan.  _Monk._ Sister in 

Buddha, support yourself by this creeper[82] that clings to the tree, and rise to your feet [_He 

bends down the creeper. Vasantasena takes it in her hand, and rises._]  _Monk._ In yonder 

monastery dwells one who is my sister in the faith. There shall my sister in Buddha be restored 

before she returns home. You must walk very slowly, sister. [_He walks about and looks around 

him._] Make way, good people, make way! This is a young lady, and I am a monk, yet my conduct 

is above reproach.     The man whose hands, whose lips are free from greed,     Who curbs his 

senses, he is man indeed.     He little recks, if kingdoms fall or stand;     For heaven is in century 

the genius of France, exquisite in the proportion of his feeling and the expression of feeling to its 

source and cause. If we do not name him, with some of his admirers, "the French Homer," we may 

at least describe him, with Nisard, as a second Montaigne, "mais plus doux, plus aimable, plus 

naif que le premier," and with all the charm of verse superadded.     CHAPTER VI COMEDY AND 

TRAGEDY--MOLIERE--RACINE   I  The history of comedy, from Larivey to Moliere, is one of 

arrested development, followed by hasty and ill-regulated growth. During the first twenty-five years 

of the seventeenth century, comedy can hardly be said to have existed; whatever tended to beauty 

or elevation, took the form of tragi-comedy or pastoral; what was rude and popular became a 

farce. From the farce Moliere's early work takes its origin, but of the repertory of his predecessors 

little survives. Much, indeed, in these performances was left to the
