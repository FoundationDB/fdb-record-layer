ic and have a fire and roast potatoes and corn?=E2=80=9D  Her interest was =
a pleasant thing to the invalid; he _
people of the cacique Maraguey and the convent was burned.  So great was th=
e fury of the=20

Indians that they even killed a horse with which the monks worked in their =
garden.  The news of=20

this massacre reaching Hispaniola from the Spaniards at Cubagua, the royal =
Audiencia at once=20

despatched a small force under Gonzalo de Ocampo to punish the Indians, and=
 the disheartening=20

news of these turbulent events was the greeting that met Las Casas on his a=
rrival at Puerto Rico.=20

Knowing that Ocampo's armada would touch there on its way to the Pearl Coas=
t, he determined to=20

await its arrival, where in fact Ocampo appeared within a few days.  Las Ca=
sas had been a=20

neighbour of his in other days and, though he knew that his treatment of th=
e Indians did not differ=20

from that of the other colonists, he held him in some esteem. He showed Oca=
mpo his cedulas with=20

the royal signature, which prohibited any Spaniards from landing, against h=
is will, in the territory=20

granted to him, and he formally required him to desist from his errand of v=
engeance. Ocampo=20

answered that, while he did not refuse obedience to the royal commands, he =
was in this instance=20

acting under the orders of the royal Audiencia and was obliged to carry out=
 the instructions he had=20

received; the responsibility lay with the Audiencia, which would protect hi=
m from any=20

consequences following the execution of its mandate.  Seeing that Ocampo wa=
s not to be=20

stopped, Las Casas resolved to go himself to Hispaniola, show his powers to=
 the Audiencia, and=20

exact the recall of the fleet.  Meanwhile he placed his colonists amongst t=
he various planters of=20

Puerto Rico, who were glad enough to welcome labourers, who were scarce in =
the island.  This=20

decision of Las Casas was a most mistaken one and was the outcome of an err=
or of judgment=20

which did not require the light of after events to make plain.  More was ce=
rtainly to be hoped from=20

his presence on the spot, and from the influence he might exercise over Oca=
mpo, than from=20

anything he could obtain from the Audiencia, whose members were his bittere=
st enemies.   It was,=20

moreover, impossible for any counter-orders he might be able to wrest from =
the reluctant=20

Audiencia, to reach the Pearl Coast in time to stop the action of Ocampo, a=
nd Las Casas does her=20

again added a little interest to his lonely life; and Thompson too, seeing =
the good effect of her visit,=20

was on the watch for her.  When one afternoon they saw her in her scarlet j=
acket, looking over the=20

garden wall, Walter waved his hand and Thompson grinned broadly over the ba=
ck of the chair,=20

while Caro nodded and smiled in response, quite as if they had been old fri=
ends.  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you want=20

to see your picture?=E2=80=9D Walter asked; =E2=80=9Cthey are on the librar=
y table, Thompson,=E2=80=9D he added.  As the=20

man went off Caro swung her feet over on the Grayson side of the fence, and=
 then in another=20

minute she had slipped down and was beside Walter=E2=80=99s chair. =E2=80=
=9CI mustn=E2=80=99t stay long,=E2=80=9D she said.=20

=E2=80=9CMarjorie has gone to the dentist=E2=80=99s and I told her I=E2=80=
=99d wait till she came back.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow is the cat?=E2=80=9D=
=20

=E2=80=9CHe is very well, thank you, but he has been bad. He stole a bird.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t say so!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, and=
=20

so have I.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t mean you have stolen a bird=
?=E2=80=9D  Caro laughed. =E2=80=9COf course not; I wouldn=E2=80=99t=20

steal, but Marjorie and Tom and I jumped all the feathers out of Aunt Charl=
otte=E2=80=99s bed.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat=20

naughty children,=E2=80=9D said Walter smiling.  =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D agr=
eed Caro with a sigh, =E2=80=9Cand I meant to be good=20

while grandpa was away. I promised him I=E2=80=99d try to be a candle and t=
hen I forgot.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat do you=20

mean by being a candle?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh--being pleasant and nice to A=
unt Charlotte and Jane,--not making=20

trouble you know. The feathers were all over the front lawn and Mrs. Rice t=
hought it was snowing.=E2=80=9D=20

Caro laughed a little at the recollection.  =E2=80=9CGrandpa said the best =
way to be a candle was to love=20

people, and I do love him ever so much, but I don=E2=80=99t love Jane. I lo=
ve Aunt Charlotte too, but she=20

doesn=E2=80=99t like to talk to me, so I miss grandpa.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=
 know how that is. I too wish sometimes for=20



someone to talk to,=E2=80=9D Walter replied.  Here Thompson appeared with t=
he photographs, and=20

everything else was forgotten.  =E2=80=9CThey are a little too grave,=E2=80=
=9D Walter said, comparing them with the=20

glowing face beside him; =E2=80=9CWe must try again sometime.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CAnd let=E2=80=99s have Trolley in it too,=E2=80=9D Caro=20

suggested.  =E2=80=9CWhy certainly, that is a good idea. Do you know Caro y=
ou remind me of my little=20

sister.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo you mean Annette?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy what=
 can you know about her?=E2=80=9D Walter asked in surprise.=20

=E2=80=9CGrandpa told me. I asked him who=20


_
pending the arrival of further instructions.  After dividing his colonists,=
 who thus became scattered,=20

and lost touch with him and with one another, Las Casas bought a vessel for=
 five hundred dollars--

an enormous sum at the time--in which he sailed for Hispaniola. His arrival=
 in Santo Domingo was=20

most unwelcome and revived all the ancient odium of the colonists against h=
im, for he was without=20

doubt the best-hated man in America.  He presented her window in the chapel=
--the Good=20

Shepherd you know. Grandpa said she was a dear little girl. Do I truly look=
 like her!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, there is=20

something in your face and smile that is like her;=E2=80=9D Walter looked t=
houghtfully at the picture.  =E2=80=9CWon=E2=80=99t=20

you please tell me about her?=E2=80=9D begged Caro.  And so while Thompson =
wheeled his master up and=20

down the garden paths, she walked beside him and listened to the story of t=
hose days when the=20

gate now nailed up=20
