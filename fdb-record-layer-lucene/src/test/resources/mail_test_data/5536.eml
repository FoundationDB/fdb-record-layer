hich is based upon these=20

psalms, throws light upon the singular passiveness of David during the matu=
ring of Absalom's=20

conspiracy, and may naturally be supposed to have favoured his schemes, an =
essential part of=20

which was to ingratiate himself with suitors who came to the king for judgm=
ent by affecting great=20

regret that no man was deputed of the king to hear them. The accumulation o=
f untried causes, and=20

the apparent disorganization of the judicial machinery, are well accounted =
for by David's sickness.=20

The fifty-fifth psalm gives some very pathetic additional particulars. It i=
s in three parts--a plaintive=20

prayer and portraiture of the psalmist's mental distress (vers. 1-8); a veh=
ement supplication=20

against his foes, and indignant recounting of their treachery (vers. 9-16);=
 and, finally, a prophecy of=20

the retribution that is to fall upon them (vers. 17-23). In the first and s=
econd portions we have=20

some points which help to complete our picture of the man. For instance, hi=
s heart "writhes" within=20

him, the "terrors of death" are on him, "fear and trembling" are come on hi=
m, and "horror" has=20

covered him. All this points, like subsequent verses, to his knowledge of t=
he conspiracy an object=20

of interest, and cessation of a pleasant pursuit; and this sense, being qui=
te new to him, made him=20

restless.  Further, in losing Mugby Junction he had found himself again; an=
d he was not the more=20

enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time in better company.  =
But surely, here not far=20

ahead, must be the great ingenious town.  This crashing and clashing that t=
he train was=20

undergoing, and this coupling on to it of a multitude of new echoes, could =
mean nothing less than=20

approach to the great station.  It did mean nothing less.  After some storm=
y flashes of town=20

lightning, in the way of swift revelations of red-brick blocks of houses, h=
igh red-brick chimney-

shafts, vistas of red-brick railway arches, tongues of fire, blots of smoke=
, valleys of canal, and hills=20

of coal, there came the thundering in at the journey's end.  Having seen hi=
s portmanteaus safely=20

housed in the hotel he chose, and having appointed his dinner-hour, Barbox =
Brothers went out for=20

a walk in the busy streets.  And now it began to be suspected by him that M=
ugby Junction was a=20

Junction of many branches, invisible as well as visible, and had joined him=
 to an endless number=20

of byways.  For, whereas he would, but a little while ago, have walked thes=
e streets blindly=20
