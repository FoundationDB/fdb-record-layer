Casas to dispute the Bishop's propositions in defence of the Indians, does not positively appear, 

(69) but just before the latter returned from America, he composed a second dialogue, 

_Democrates II.  De justis belli causis apud Indios_, in which he upheld the right of the Spaniards 

to make war on the Indians.  This dialogue was apparently written in Valladolid and called forth an 

episcopal reprimand from the Bishop of Segovia.  The fraternal admonition of the Bishop, instead 

of disposing of the subject, provoked a reply from Sepulveda in the form of an _Apologia_ of an 

_Democrates II_.  The India Council having refused to permit the publication of this dialogue, 

Sepulveda petitioned the Emperor, who referred the matter to the Council of Castile.  That body 

having given its assent, the Emperor signed a royal cedula at Aranda de Duero, authorising the 

dimensions being possible.  The sixteenth century is remarkable for the great advance by Italian, 

by Nuremberg, and by Augsburg clockmakers. Striking and alarum clocks, and intricate 

mechanism showing phases of the moon, the year, the day of the month, and the festivals of the 

Church, were produced. In the sixteenth century portable clocks received further attention in 

regard to minute mechanism, resulting in what we now know as the watch. The moment this point 

was reached, ornamentation of a rich and elaborate character was applied to such objects of art, 

then only in the possession of princes and nobles and the richest classes of society.  In the middle 

of the seventeenth century Huygens, the celebrated Dutch astronomer and mathematician, 

brought great modification in the art of clockmaking by applying the pendulum to clocks in order to 

regulate the

In the midst of the interest excited by this controversy, Las Casas arrived in Spain.  He prevailed 

upon the Council of Castile to reconsider its decision, and to submit Sepulveda's work to the 

universities of Salamanca and Alcala, for an opinion on the soundness of his doctrine. The reply of 

the universities was spring, which produced upon this balance the same effect as that of the 

weight upon the pendulum" (Labarte, _Arts of the Middle Ages_).  In old clocks there is a verge 

escapement with a cross-bar balanced by weights. This was in the top portion of the clock.  When 

the pendulum was introduced it was first placed in front
