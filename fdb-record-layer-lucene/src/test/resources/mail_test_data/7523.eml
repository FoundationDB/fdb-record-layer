philodendron monstera Presbyterians of Alabama and Georgia urged masters to=

: Simmons, _Men of=20

Mark_, p. 629.]  [Footnote 7: _Ibid._, p. 620.]  Many of these opportunitie=
s were made possible by=20

the desire to teach slaves religion. In fact the instruction of Negroes aft=
er the enactment of=20

prohibitory laws resembled somewhat the teaching of religion with letters d=
uring the seventeenth=20

and eighteenth centuries. Thousands of Negroes like Edward Patterson and Na=
t Turner learned to=20

read and write in Sabbath-schools. White men who diffused such information =
ran the gauntlet of=20

mobs, but like a Baptist preacher of South Carolina who was threatened with=
 expulsion from his=20

o long, that you did not stay altogether,=20

and leave us in peace,=E2=80=9D Anna rejoined in a pettish tone.  This exas=
perated Michael, and not=20

 Popovna,=E2=80=9D he cried, =E2=80=9Cwhen I went=20

to seek you in the snowstorm, you and your brother the Popovitch, and lost =
my left ear to save=20

of his wrath: =E2=80=9CIt is all your fault,=20

Ivan Barrinka. I am quite tired of you and of your pride. Lord though you m=

When preachers themselves dared not undertake this task it was often done b=
y their children,=20

whose benevolent work was winked at as an indulgence to the clerical profes=
sion. This charity,=20

however, was not restricted to the narrow circle of the clergy. Believing w=
ith churchmen that the=20

Bible is the revelation of God, many laymen contended that no man should be=
 restrained from=20

knowing his Maker directly.[1] Negroes, therefore, almost worshiped the Bib=
le, and their anxiety to=20

read it was their greatest incentive to learn. Many southerners braved the =
terrors of public opinion=20

and taught their Negroes to read the Scriptures. To this extent General Cox=
e of Fluvanna County,=20

Virginia, taught about one hundred of his adult slaves.[2] While serving as=
 a professor of the=20

Military Institute at Lexington, Stonewall Jackson taught a class of Negroe=
s in a Sunday-school.[3]=20

[Footnote 1: Orr, "An Address on the Need of Education in the South, 1879."=
]  [Footnote 2: This=20

statement is made by several of General Coxe's slaves who are still living.=
]  [Footnote 3: _School=20

Journal_, vol. lxxx., p. 332.]  Further interest in the cause was shown by =

 time the loud voices had=20

attracted the attention of the other boys. Leaving their swings, they came =
crowding around; and as=20

soon as they understood the cause of the dispute, they all turned with one =
accord upon Michael,=20

threatening him with condign punishment if he did not forthwith let Barrink=
a have his way,=20

whatever that way might be.  But Barrinka no longer cared for the pastime. =

about his birth, which, through injudicious and mistaken kindness, had been=
 neither wholly=20

concealed nor yet frankly revealed to him. All his little playfellows had f=
athers and mothers. It is=20
