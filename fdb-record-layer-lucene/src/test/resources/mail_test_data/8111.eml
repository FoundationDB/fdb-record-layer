Beverley?"  "Why not, Dad," whispered Lorna, looking with apprehension into his haggard, excited 

face.  She guessed even before he spoke what the answer was going to be.  "David Beverley is 

the man who ruined my life!"  The blow which had fallen was utterly overwhelming. For a moment 

Lorna fought against the knowledge like a drowning man battling with the waters.  "Oh, Dad! 

Surely there's some mistake. It _can't_ be! Isn't it some other Beverley perhaps?"  "I know his 

writing only too well. There's no possibility of a mistake. Besides, I saw him in Naples--at the end 

of February. I haven't forgotten the shock it gave me. Why," turning almost fiercely upon Lorna, 

"didn't you tell me your schoolfellow's name before? Have you all this time been making friends 

with your father's enemy?"  "I thought I'd often talked about Renie," faltered poor Lorna. "Perhaps I 

never mentioned her surname. Oh, Dad! Dad! Is it really true? It's too horrible to be believed." 

Lying in the soft Capri grass, with the pink cistus flowers brushing her hot cheeks, Lorna raged 

impotently against the tragedy of a fate which was changing the dearest friendship of her life into a 

feud. Irene!--the only one at school who had sympathized and understood her, who had behaved 

with a delicacy and kindness such as no other person had ever shown her, who had taken her 

even more than the yellowish brown clayey grounds of Calabozo and Tisnao.  On the 28th of 

March I was on the shore at sunrise to measure the breadth of the Apure, which is two hundred 

and six toises. The thunder rolled in all directions around. It was the first storm and the first rain of 

the season. The river was swelled by the easterly wind; but it soon became calm, and then some 

great cetacea, much resembling the porpoises of our seas, began to play in long files on the 

surface of the water. The slow and indolent crocodiles seem to dread the neighbourhood of these 

animals, so noisy and impetuous in their evolutions, for we saw them dive whenever they 

approached. It is a very extraordinary phenomenon to find cetacea at such a distance from the 

coast. The Spaniards of the Missions designate them, as they do the porpoises of the ocean, by 

the name of toninas. The Tamanacs call them orinucna. They are three or four feet long; and 

bending their back, and pressing with their tail on the inferior strata of the water, they expose to 

view a part of the back and of the dorsal fin. I did not succeed in obtaining any, though I often 

engaged Indians to shoot at them with their arrows. Father Gili asserts that the Gumanos eat their 

flesh. Are these cetacea peculiar to the great rivers of South America, like the manatee, which,

happiest time she had ever had in her shadowed girlhood; Irene with her merry gray eyes and her 

bright sunny hair, the very incarnation of warm-hearted genuine affection--Irene, her roommate, 

her buddy, her chosen confidante. How was it possible ever to regard her as an enemy? Yet had 

she not vowed a solemn oath to hate all belonging to the man who had so desperately injured 

them? Oh! The world seemed turning upside down. Loyalty to her father and love for her friend 

dragged different ways, and in the bitter conflict fresh water cetaceous animal? or must we admit 

that they go up from the sea against the current, as the beluga sometimes does in the rivers of 

Asia? What would lead me to doubt this last supposition is, that we saw toninas above the great 

cataracts of the Orinoco, in the Rio Atabapo. Did they penetrate into the centre of equinoctial 

America from the mouth of the Amazon, by the communication of that river with the Rio Negro, the 

Cassiquiare, and the Orinoco? They are found here at all seasons, and nothing seems to denote
