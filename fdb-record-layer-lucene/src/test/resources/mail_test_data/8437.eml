selecting the most difficult point, and fastening upon details instead of grappling with the matter in 

hand as a whole. Come now, and I will demonstrate to you, if you will allow me, by many 

satisfactory proofs, that Homer has made Achilles a better man than Odysseus, and a truthful man 

too; and that he has made the other crafty, and a teller of many untruths, and inferior to Achilles. 

And then, if you please, you shall make a speech on the other side, in order to prove that 

Odysseus is the better man; and this may be compared to mine, and then the company will know 

which of us is the better speaker.  SOCRATES: O Hippias, I do not doubt that you are wiser than I 

am. But I have a way, when anybody else says anything, of giving close attention to him, 

especially if the speaker appears to me to be a wise man. Having a desire to understand, I 

question him, and I examine and analyse and put together what he says, in order that I may 

understand; but if the speaker appears to me to be a poor hand, I do not interrogate him, or 

trouble myself about him, and you may know by this who they are whom I deem to be wise men, 

for you will see that when I am talking with a wise man, I am very attentive to what he says; and I 

ask questions of him, in order that I may learn, and be improved by him. And I could not help 

remarking while you were speaking, that when you recited the verses in which Achilles, as you 

argued, attacks Odysseus as a deceiver, that you must be strangely mistaken, because 

Odysseus, the man of wiles, is never found to tell a lie; but Achilles is found to be wily on your own 

showing. At any rate he speaks falsely; for first he utters these words, which you just now 

repeated,--  'He is hateful to me even as the gates of death who thinks one thing and says 

another:'--  And then he says, a little while afterwards, he will not be persuaded by Odysseus and 

Agamemnon, neither will he remain at Troy; but, says he,--  'To-morrow, when I have offered 

sacrifices to Zeus and all the Gods, having loaded my ships well, I will drag them down into the 

deep; and then you shall see, if you have a mind, and if such things are a care to you, early in the 

morning my ships sailing over the fishy Hellespont, and my men eagerly plying the oar; and, if the 

illustrious shaker of the earth should remain in strict anonymity, an understanding which has been 

adhered to until the present writing.  The offer from the "anonymous donor," presented by the 

president, was accepted by the Orchestra Association.  A subscription to an endowment fund was 

shortly afterward begun; and the amount had been brought to eight hundred thousand dollars 

when the Great War interrupted any further additions.  In the autumn of 1919, however, a city-wide 

campaign for an addition of one million dollars to the endowment fund was launched.  The amount 

was not only secured, but oversubscribed. Thus, instead of a guarantee fund, contributed by 

thirteen hundred subscribers, with the necessity for annual collection, an endowment fund of one 

million eight hundred thousand dollars, contributed by fourteen thousand subscribers, has been 

secured; and the Philadelphia Orchestra has been promoted from a privately maintained 

organization to a public institution in which fourteen thousand residents of Philadelphia feel a 

proprietary interest.  It has become in fact, as well as in name, "our orchestra."     CHAPTER XIX 

A WAR MAGAZINE AND WAR ACTIVITIES  The success of _The Ladies' Home Journal_ went 

steadily forward.  The circulation had passed the previously unheard-of figure for a monthly 

magazine of a million and a half copies per month; it had now touched a million and three-

quarters.  And not only was the figure so high, but the circulation itself was absolutely free from 

"water."  The public could not obtain the magazine through what are known as clubbing-rates, 

since no subscriber was permitted to include any other magazine with it; years ago it had 



abandoned the practice of offering premiums or consideration of any kind to induce subscriptions; 

and the newsdealers were not allowed to return unsold copies of the periodical.  Hence every copy 

was either purchased by the public at the full price at a news stand, or subscribed for at its stated 

subscription price.  It was, in short, an authoritative circulation.  And on every hand the question 

was being asked: "How is it done?  How is such a high circulation obtained?"  Bok's invariable 

answer was that he gave his readers the very best of the class of reading that he believed would 

interest them, and that he spared neither effort nor 


_
Phthia.'  And before that, when he was reviling Agamemnon, he said,--  'And now to Phthia I will 

go, since to return home in the beaked ships is far better, nor am I inclined to stay here in 

dishonour and amass wealth and riches for you.'  But although on that occasion, in the presence 

of the whole army, he spoke after this fashion, and on the other occasion to his companions, he 

appears never to have made any preparation or attempt to draw down the ships, as if he had the 

least intention of sailing home; so nobly regardless was he of the truth. Now I, Hippias, originally 

asked you the question, because I was in doubt as to which of the two heroes was intended by the 

poet to be the best, and because I thought that both of them were the best, and that it would be 

difficult to decide which was the better of them, not only in respect of truth and falsehood, but of 

virtue generally, for even in this matter of speaking the truth they are much upon a par.  HIPPIAS: 

There you are wrong, Socrates; for in so far as Achilles speaks falsely, the falsehood is obviously 

unintentional. He is compelled against his will to remain and rescue the army in their misfortune. 

But when Odysseus speaks falsely he is voluntarily and intentionally false.  SOCRATES: You, 

sweet Hippias, like Odysseus, are a deceiver yourself.  HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socrates; what 

makes you say so?  SOCRATES: Because you say that Achilles does not speak falsely from 

design, when he is not only a deceiver, but besides being a braggart, in Homer's description of 

him is so cunning, and so far superior to Odysseus in lying and pretending, that he dares to 

contradict himself, and Odysseus does not find him out; at any rate he does not appear to say 

anything to him which would imply that he perceived his falsehood.  HIPPIAS: What do you mean, 

Socrates?  SOCRATES: Did you not observe that afterwards, when he is speaking to Odysseus, 

he says that he will sail away with the early dawn; but to Ajax he tells quite a different story? 

HIPPIAS: Where is that?  SOCRATES: Where he says,--  'I will not think about bloody war until 

the son of warlike Priam, illustrious Hector, comes to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons, 

slaughtering the Argives, and burning the ships with fire; and about my tent and dark ship, I 

suspect that Hector, although eager for the battle, will nevertheless stay his hand.'  Now, do you 

really think, Hippias, that the son of Thetis, who had been the pupil of the sage Cheiron, had such 

a bad memory, or would have carried the art of lying to such an extent (when he had been 

assailing liars in the most violent terms only the instant before) as to say to Odysseus that he 

would sail away, and to Ajax that he would remain, and that he was not rather practising upon the 

simplicity of Odysseus, whom he regarded as an ancient, and thinking that he would get the better 

of him by his own cunning and falsehood?  HIPPIAS: No, I do not agree with you, Socrates; but I 

believe that Achilles is induced to say one thing to Ajax, and another to Odysseus in the Howells 

once asked him how he classified his audience, Bok replied: "We appeal to the intelligent 

American woman rather than to the intellectual type."  And he gave her the best he could obtain. 

As he knew her to be fond of the personal type of literature, he gave her in succession Jane 

Addams's story of "My Fifteen Years at Hull House," and the remarkable narration of Helen 

Keller's "Story of My Life"; he invited Henry Van Dyke, who had never been in the Holy Land, to go 

there, camp out in a tent, and then write a series of sketches, "Out of Doors in the Holy Land"; he 

induced Lyman Abbott to tell the story of "My Fifty Years as a Minister."  He asked Gene Stratton 

Porter to tell of her bird-experiences in the series: "What I Have Done with Birds"; he persuaded 

Dean Hodges to turn from his work of training young clergymen at the Episcopal Seminary, at 

Cambridge, and write one of the most successful series of Bible stories for children ever printed; 



and then he supplemented this feature for children by publishing Rudyard Kipling's "Just So" 

stories and his "Puck of Pook's Hill."  He induced F. Hopkinson Smith to tell the best stories he 

had ever heard in his wide travels in "The Man in the Arm Chair"; he got Kate Douglas Wiggin to 

tell a country church experience of hers in "The Old Peabody Pew"; and Jean Webster her 

knowledge of almshouse life in "Daddy Long Legs."  The readers of _The Ladies' Home Journal_ 

realized that it searched the whole field of endeavor in literature and art to secure what would 

interest them, and they responded with their support.  Another of Bok's methods in editing was to 

do the common thing in an uncommon way.  He had the faculty of putting old wine in new bottles 

and the public liked it.  His ideas were not new; he knew there were no new ideas, but he 

presented his ideas in such a way that they seemed new.  It is a significant fact, too, that a large 

public will respond more quickly to an idea than it will to a name.   When, early in 1917, events 

began so to shape themselves as directly to point to the entrance of the United States into the 

Great War, Edward Bok set himself to formulate a policy for _The Ladies' Home Journal_. He 

knew that he was in an almost insurmountably difficult position. The huge edition necessitated 

going to press fully six weeks in advance of publication, and the preparation of material fully four 

weeks previous to that.  He could not, therefore, get much closer than ten weeks to the date when 

his readers received the magazine.  And he knew that events, in war time, had a way of moving 

rapidly.  Late in January he went to Washington, consulted those authorities who could indicate 

possibilities to him better than any one else, and found, as he had suspected, that the entry of the 

United States into the war was a practical certainty; it was only a question of time.  Bok went 

South for a month's holiday to get ready for the fray, and in the saddle and on the golf links he 

formulated a policy.  The newspapers and weeklies would send innumerable correspondents to

or truly, speaks always with a purpose.  SOCRATES: Then Odysseus would appear after all to be 

better than Achilles?  HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socrates.  SOCRATES: Why, were not the voluntary 

liars only just now shown to be better than the involuntary?  HIPPIAS: And how, Socrates, can 

those who intentionally err, and voluntarily and designedly commit iniquities, be better than those 

who err and do wrong involuntarily? Surely there is a great excuse to be made for a man telling a 

falsehood, or doing an injury or any sort of harm to another in front, and obviously, with the 

necessity for going to press so far in advance, _The Journal_ could not compete with them.  They 

would depict every activity in the field.  There was but one logical thing for him to do: ignore the 

"front" entirely, refuse all the offers of correspondents, men and women, who wanted to go with 

the armies for his magazine, and cover fully and practically the results of the war as they would 

affect the women left behind.  He went carefully over the ground to see what these would be, 

along what particular lines women's
