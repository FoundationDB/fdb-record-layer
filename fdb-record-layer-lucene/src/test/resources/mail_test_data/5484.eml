ock County in 1656=20

ended the list of counties formed in the decade 1650 to 1660.  The next dev=
elopment was on the=20

Eastern Shore. It had become sufficiently populous to support two county go=
vernments and in an=20

Act of the Assembly March 1661/62 reference is made to the two counties. Th=
e southern part of=20

the peninsula retained the name it had borne for twenty years, Northampton,=
 and the county to the=20

north assumed the name once borne by the entire peninsula, Accomack. The qu=
estion of the=20

boundary line between the two divisions dragged on for twenty-five years, b=
eing settled 22 March=20

1687/88. It has remained fixed. The boundary between Virginia and Maryland =
also was long in=20

dispute, but Watkins Point at the mouth of Pocomoke River on its north side=
 is the western end of=20

the line. The line across the peninsula was set at a little north of the po=
int.  With Eastern Shore=20

divided into two counties, no further growth was possible and the peninsula=
 remains two counties.=20

The next county to be formed in the colony was Stafford, which lies on the =
north side of the=20

Rappahannock River to the west of Westmoreland. The name is in honor of an =
English shire.=20

When formed in 1664, it was a border county with constant fear of Indian at=
tacks since an=20

established Indian trail regularly used by their hunting parties lay within=
 its territory. Its north and=20

west boundaries were not well defined, but included the area later Fairfax,=
 Prince William,=20

Fauquier, Loudoun and Alexandria (now Arlington) Counties.  Middlesex Count=
y, next to be noted,=20

in 1669, there was a hiatus of 22 years before a new county was created. In=
 that period, the=20

despread. Troubles=20

 cutting, all combined to=20

make Virginia a gloomy place. The accession of James II brought no improvem=
ent in England, and=20

the time was ripe for revolution. James II was forced to flee. He was succe=
eded by his daughter=20

Mary and her husband, who was his nephew, Prince William of Orange. Under t=
heir rule, both=20

England and Virginia became more prosperous. The next new county, King and =
Queen, created=20

1691, was named in their honor. This was formed from New Kent, "so that Pam=
