evening, so it's of no consequence. Now for the Hotel. Ask for the bus for the _Continental_. The 

_Continental_ is not open yet. Very well, the _Hotel de la Plage_, then. Closed! All the hotels 

facing the sea _are_, it seems. Sympathetic Porter recommends one in the town, and promises to 

come and tell me as soon as the luggage turns up.  [Illustration: "Please, de tings!"]  _At the 

Hotel._--Find, on getting out of the omnibus, that the Hotel is being painted; entrance blocked by 

ladders and pails. Squeeze past, and am received in the hall by the Proprietress and a German 

Waiter. "Certainly they can give me a room--my baggage shall be taken up immed--" Here I have 

to explain that this is impracticable, as my baggage has unfortunately been left behind. Think I see 

a change in their manner at this. A stranger who comes abroad with nothing but a stick and an 

umbrella cannot _expect_ to three gentlemen, who had preceded Athos and Aramis, and an 

officer was examining their passports. The first impulse of these three, and of those who last 

entered, was to cast an inquiring glance at each other. The first arrivals wore long cloaks, in 

whose drapery they were carefully enveloped; one of them, shorter than the rest, remained 

pertinaciously in the background.  When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all 

probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists, it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the 

officers on guard that they ought not to pass.  "Be it so," said Athos; "yet it is probable, on the 

contrary, that we shall enter, because we seem to have to do with sensible people. There seems 

to be only one thing to do, which is, to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England, and 

if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to enter."  On hearing these words 

the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was

suppose. I remark to the Waiter that the luggage is sure to follow me by the next boat, but it strikes 

even myself that I do not bring this out with quite a sincere ring. Not at all the manner of a man 

who possesses a real portmanteau. I order dinner--the kind of dinner, I feel, that a man who did 

not intend to pay for it _would_ order. I detect this impression in the Waiter's eye. If he dared, I 

know more carefully than before.  "Merciful goodness!" whispered Aramis to Athos, "did you see?" 

"What?" asked Athos.  "The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen?"  "No."  "He looked to 

me--but 'tis impossible."  At this instant the sergeant, who had been for his orders, returned, and 

pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks, said:  "The passports are in order; let these three 

gentlemen pass."
