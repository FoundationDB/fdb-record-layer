philodendron monstera he'd got his raise.  But now--well, it was a deuced g=

euced good thing she _was_ handy with her needle.  He could see her waiting=
 for him at the door with her customary kiss. Hang it! how was he going to =
break the news to her?  If he had n't been so asininely  "Quite proper. And=
 her son had to leave the London office and seek lodgings elsewhere?"  "Yes=
; that was also effected through me."  "Being thrown upon their own resourc=
es, they took two rooms in Knightsbridge. We tracked them there. Sometimes =
they went out _
friendship of their fellow commuters, because they were good "mixers," good=
 chatterers.  There=20

was Lewis, for instance, who was just going into the Pullman with Robertson=
, the banker.  Lewis=20

was nothing but a social froth-juggler.  He had n't half Skinner's ability,=
 yet he was going around=20

with the rich. Cheek--that was it--nothing but cheek that did it.  Skinner =
detested cheek, yet Lewis=20

had capitalized it.  The result was a fine house and servants and an automo=
bile for the man who=20

used to walk in the slush with Skinner behind other men's cars and take eit=
her their mud or their=20

gasoline stench.  Skinner wondered if Lewis and others like him could affor=
d their way of living.=20

He had always looked forward with a certain satisfaction to the time when t=
he smash would come=20

to some of these social butterflies, with their mortgaged automobiles, and =
then he, Skinner, with=20

his snug little bank account, unfortunate young lady. Since the lying accus=
ation was brought=20

against her, we have not been able to sleep. If exhausted nature compels us=
 to go off in a doze,=20

we start up in affright and horror. There will never again be rest for eith=
er of us until Miss=20

Farebrother is set at liberty and her honourable name restored to her."  "Y=
our feelings do you=20

credit," said Garden; "but it is not alone to say what you have said that y=
ou have come here to-

night?"  "No; but it leads up to what may be of importance. God knows wheth=
er it will or not, but=20

drowning men catch at a straw. I am glad you are working with Mr. Cornwall,=
 sir; it is easy to see=20

how he is suffering, and you must be a comfort to him--if," he added, feeli=
ngly, "anybody _can_=20

comfort him at such a time as this. Well, sir, Linton and I have also been =
putting our heads=20

together, and we decided to set a watch."  "Upon whom?"  "Upon that image o=

greatly consoled him for wearing cheap clothes.  He'd rather have his money=
 in the bank than on=20

his back.  But the smash had n't come to any of them as yet, he reflected. =
 On the contrary, the=20

more money they seemed to spend, the more they seemed to make.  He wondered=
 how they=20

managed.     CHAPTER II  HOW SKINNER GOT HIS RAISE  Presently, Wilkes, in t=
he seat just=20

ahead of Skinner, folded his newspaper and turned to his neighbor.  "Are yo=
u going to the=20

reception to the new pastor at the First Presbyterian?"  "Am I going?  You =
bet I am.  We're all=20

going."  The remark brought Skinner back to the things of the moment with a=
 jerk.  By Jove!=20

Honey was going to that reception and she'd set her heart on his going with=
 her.  She'd been=20

making over a dress for it. It seemed to Skinner she was always making some=
thing over.  He had=20

made up his mind that she'd buy wicked mother. Sir, that tale of hers as to=
 what took place=20

between her and Miss Farebrother on the night of the murder is false as--Ne=
ver mind; it will not do=20

to be profane."  "That is to say, you believe it to be false? You have no d=
irect evidence to the=20

contrary?"  "No, sir; unfortunately we have not. It is our belief, as you s=
ay, but none the less=20

incontrovertible. It is not because we have dramatic ideas that we determin=
ed to watch this=20

precious pair. It seemed to us to offer a chance of discovering something; =
therefore we set=20

practically to work, Linton watching the son, I watching the mother. Until =
this evening we saw=20

nothing that could be turned against them. You are probably aware that Mrs.=
 Pamflett left=20

Parksides shortly after the murder?"  "She had to leave," remarked Fred; "a=
s Miss Farebrother's=20

legal representative, I saw to that before the=20
