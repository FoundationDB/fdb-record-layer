 A dusty wagonette crammed full of townspeople, probably going to visit the=
 shrine, drove by along the main road. The wagonette was hardly out of sigh=
t when a light chaise with a pair of horses came into view. In it was Akim =
Nikititch, the police inspector, standing up and holding on to _
bodily powers. Neither when they are in the flower of their strength, nor a=
fterwards with posterity,=20

can they do for human life what is done by the researches of the learned.  =
16. But although=20

honours are not bestowed upon authors for excellence of character and teach=
ing, yet as their=20

minds, naturally looking up to the higher regions of the air, are raised to=
 the sky on the steps of=20

history, it must needs be, that not merely their doctrines, but even their =
appearance, should be=20

known to posterity through time eternal. Hence, men whose souls are aroused=
 by the delights of=20

literature cannot but carry enshrined in their hearts the likeness of the p=

seem to have before=20

ence and remembering=20

the scene of the previous evening, I went out of doors. It was a grey day. =
The sky was covered=20

with storm-clouds and there was a wind blowing dust, bits of paper, and fea=
thers along the=20

ground.... It felt as though rain were coming. There was a look of boredom =
in the servants and in=20

the animals. When I went into the house I was told not to make such a noise=
 with my feet, as=20

mother was ill and in bed with a migraine. What was I to do? I went outside=
 the gate, sat down on=20

the little bench there, and fell to trying to discover the meaning of what =
I had seen and heard the=20

day before. From our gate there was a road which, passing the forge and the=
 pool which never=20

dried up, ran into the main road. I looked at the telegraph-posts, about wh=
ich clouds of dust were=20

whirling, and at the sleepy birds sitting on the wires, and I suddenly felt=
 so dreary that I began to=20
