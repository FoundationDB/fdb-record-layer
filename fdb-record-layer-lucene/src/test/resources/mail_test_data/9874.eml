Spanish king is therefore not only obliged to secure the liberty of the Indians because justice 

exacts this of him, but also because he is bound to prevent his Spanish subjects from acts of 

usurpation of the rights of others.  Christian kings have greater duties than those which weigh 

upon heathen or heretical rulers, for they are bound to protect religion, favour its ministers, and 

spread the faith for the sanctification of the whole world.  By securing liberty to the Indians, their 

conversion would be assured and, all causes of enmity and hatred against Spaniards being 

removed, the natives would eagerly welcome the missionaries showing the early type conforming 

to the lantern design.  Not only the form but the usage determined the name. The lantern had 

spikes or metal hooks to hang upon. The clock similarly was affixed to a wall, and we know it as a 

bracket clock, because, whether on a wall or on a bracket, it had chains and weights suspended

The third article of his argument, dealing with the conduct of bishops in America, rehearses their 

apostolic duties towards their flocks and concludes by defining it as an episcopal obligation to 

represent the sufferings and wrongs of their defenceless people to the King and the India Council, 

and to insist on Justice being done them.  It is a noteworthy fact that such writings and speeches 

seem to have given no offence to the Spanish monarch, at that time the most absolute sovereign 

in Christendom, and than tapestry figures moving in a misty background. To watch the revolving 

pinions of a Stuart clock is to hear the echoes of the past reverberate. It requires no gramophone 

to reproduce dead voices, nor a cinema picture to recall bygone incidents and happenings. One 

can listen to the same monotone calling forth the departure of the seconds that awakened George 

Herbert from a reverie and beat rhythmically to his carefully wrought verse. The same hand 

pointed to midnight that beckoned Lovelace from his
