philodendron monstera than those of the west and east; the Avon, the Erme, the Yealm have all their own charm, and are as genuinely children of Dartmoor as the Teign, the Dart, or the Tavy. Probably the best centre for this district is South Brent, where there is a philodendron monstera than those of the west and east; the Avon, the Erme, the Yealm have all their own charm, and are as genuinely children of Dartmoor as the Teign, the Dart, or the Tavy. Probably the best centre for this district is South Brent, where there is a _
there is one at Lustleigh, a fine one on Rippon, and others elsewhere. Some of them no longer 

"log" satisfactorily, and certainly none are connected with Druidic or other ceremonial. They are 

natural formations, like the rock-basins and the tors themselves.  It is more interesting to pass on 

to one of the loveliest portions of the moorland border, that which is watered by the Rivers Dart 

after their junction at Dartmeet. We have already seen the West Dart at Two Bridges, and the East 

Dart should be explored at least to Postbridge. It is especially beautiful where it is joined by the 

Walla, at the foot of Yes Tor. Dartmeet is a small settlement of houses, and deserves to be 

popular, for while quite on the moorland it has none of the desolate aspect that some persons find 

depressing, and those who love woods can get them to perfection around Holne and Buckland. 

Tourists who have been up the river from Dartmouth to Totnes are inclined to think that they know 

the Dart; they are as much mistaken as those who think they know the Wye when they have been 

to Symond's Yat. To know the Dart its moorland recesses must be explored, where the stream is 

in its fresh impetuous youth; below Totnes, though its banks are undoubtedly lovely, it has become 

chastened and sobered. At the junction of the Wallabrook with the Dart is a very fine view of Yar 

Tor, near which is the luxuriant Brimpts plantation.  The meeting of the two Darts is in a low rock-

strewn gorge, to appreciate which the roadway must be left. Near is the Coffin-stone, with its 

inscribed crosses, used as a resting-place for the dead on their way to burial. It is said that when a 

man of notorious wickedness was being carried to his grave, his coffin as usual was rested on this 

stone, and a flash of fire struck downward from a passing cloud, consuming the body and splitting 

the solid rock. The cleft remains as a proof. The rocks of this district are frequently of metallic 

substance, and are often struck by lightning; perhaps this kills the romance of the legend. 

Buckland-in-the-Moor, so called to distinguish it from other Bucklands, is not strictly on the 

moorland at all, and is cradled in woodland; it is a very small, delightful village, close to the united 

Webburns, which join the Dart below. The river here flows in most tortuous fashion under the 

beautiful woods of Buckland Drive and Holne Chase. Holne Cot has a place in literature as the 

birthplace of Charles Kingsley, in 1819, but he left it when an infant. Another literary remembrance 

is the birth of the dramatist Ford at Ilsington, and Tavistock had a true poet in William Browne; but 

it must be confessed that the literary glories of the moorland are not great, and Carrington, its 

special poet, is quite a third-rate writer. There has been no Wordsworth to interpret Dartmoor. We 

have to come to modern fiction, in the books of Mr. Baring-Gould and Mr. Phillpotts, for anything 

like an adequate literary treatment; and even in this department there has been no _Lorna 

Doone_.  At Holne and Buckland may be found some of the most luxuriant woodland of the moor-

borders, yellow with dense primroses in the spring. On both sides of the river there are rich woods 

of birch and oak and fir, while in the valley through which the Dart runs are fertile succulent 

marshes, beautified with bogbeans, asphodels, and sundews, and with the exquisite _Osmunda 

regalis_ flourishing where, happily, it is very difficult to reach. In parts the river flows through ivied 

crags, above which hang clusters of mountain-ash. There are prehistoric remains at Holne and at 

Hembury, but it is difficult to think of the past where the present is of such never even given a 

thought to what had caused her so much annoyance the day before. His very presence seemed to 

bring with it an atmosphere of repose and safety and self-confidence.  When she had seen him go 

stalking by on the previous night, she had instantly said to herself--'Oh, that is not the kind of man 

to worry about what is said of him.'  And this morning, when he came down to the boat, she had 



never thought of him as a criticised and suffering poet, but as--well, as the Ronald that all of them 

knew and were familiar with--self-reliant, good-natured, masterful in his way, and ever ready with a 

laugh and a song and a jest, save when there was any young lady there, to make him a little more 

demure and respectful in his manner.  Ronald a disappointed poet?--Ronald suffering agony 

because a two-for-a-quarter kind of a creature out there in Chicago did not think well of him?  She 

ventured to lift her eyes a little.  He was not looking her way at all.  He was regarding the shore 

intently; and there was a quiet and humorous smile on the hard-set, sun-tanned face.  'There are 

six--seven--blackcocks; do ye see them?'  'Oh yes; what handsome birds they are!' she said, with 

a curious sense of relief.  'Ay,' said he, 'the lads are very friendly amongst themselves just now; 

but soon there will be wars and rumours of wars when they begin to set up house each for himself. 

There will be many a pitched battle on those knolls there. Handsome?  Ay, they're handsome 

enough; but handsome is as handsome does.  The blackcock is not nearly as good a fellow as the 

grousecock, that stays with his family, and protects them, and gives them the first warning cry if 

there's danger.  These rascals there wander off by themselves, and leave their wives and children 

to get on as they can.  They're handsome--but they're ne'er-do-weels. There's one thing: the villain 

has a price put on his head; for a man would rather bring down one old cock thumping on the 

grass than fill his bag with gray hens.'  A disappointed poet indeed!  And she was so glad to find 

him talking in his usual half-bantering careless fashion (that he should talk in any other way was 

only a wild suggestion of her own conscience, struck with a qualm on the mention of Strath-Naver) 

that she made many inquiries about the habits of black game and similar creatures; and was 

apparently much interested; and all the while was vowing within herself that she would think no 

more of the mortifying disappointment she had met with, but would give up this last day on the 

loch wholly to such fancies and quiet amusements as she would like to look back upon in after 

hours.  And a very pleasant day they spent in this still, silent, beautiful region, cut off from all of the 

world, as it were. There were plenty of trout, and therefore there was plenty of occupation; 

moreover, one or two good-sized sea-trout added to the value of the basket.  Nor was this solitary 

district quite so untenanted as she had supposed.  About mid-day it occurred to her that she was 

becoming hungry and then the wild reflection flashed on her that the lunch was in the other boat--

some eight miles away.  She confided her perplexity--her despair--to Ronald.  'It is my fault,' he 

said, with vexation very visible in his face.  'I should have remembered.  But--but--' he added 

timidly--for he was not accustomed to ministering to the wants of young ladies--'I could get ye 

some bread and a drink of milk, if that would do.'  'What, right here?'  'Yes.'  'Why, nothing could 

be better!'  They were rowing the boat ashore by this time; and when they had got to land, he 

leaped on to the beach, and presently disappeared.  In little more

river, stone-strewn waste and fertile pasture here meet, with no discord or violent contrast, but 

harmonized by a reconciling atmosphere of beauty. The churches both at Buckland and Holne 

have very interesting screens, and at Holne is a finely-carved wooden pulpit.  Though it can 

scarcely be said to belong to the moors, Ashburton is a good starting-point for the examination of 

the eastern moorlands. Here and at Buckfastleigh are the only remains of the once extensive 

Devon woollen manufactures; and Ashburton was also at one time a Stannary town. It has a good 

church and many interesting associations, but we cannot linger either here or at Buckfast, where a 

settlement of Benedictines has restored the old abbey.  There is a great temptation to stay awhile 

at Dean Prior for the sake of Robert Herrick, one of England's sweetest lyrists, who was twice 

vicar here, being presented by Charles I in 1629, dispossessed at the substantial loaf of home-

made bread and a large jug of milk.  'Well done!' she said.  'There's plenty for all of us. Lend me 

your knife, Ronald.'  'Oh no,' said he, 'it's for you.'  And a hard fight she had of it ere she could get 

the two men to accept a fair division; but she had her way in the end; and Ronald, seeing that she 

was determined they should share the milk also (she drank first, and handed the jug to him quite 

as a matter of course), swiftly and stealthily pulled off the cup from his whisky-flask, and old 

Malcolm and he drank from that, pouring the milk into it from the jug.  It was a frugal picnic; but 

she was very happy; and she was telling him that when he came to Chicago, and they were 

showing him the beauties of Lake Michigan, they might give him a grander luncheon than this, but 

none more comfortable.  In the afternoon they set out for home, picking up a few more trout by the 

way; and when they at

neighbourhood so heartily in his verse that it is surprising he should have accepted the living a 

second time; but perhaps he said a little more than he meant. The exact spot of his burial in the 

churchyard is unknown. Some of Herrick's lyrics are so lovely that even Devonians must forgive 

him, though he wrote:      "O men, O manners; now and lake they found the other boat still 

pursuing its unwearied round. Moreover Mr. Hodson's strict attention to business had been 

rewarded by the capture of a handsome fish of sixteen pounds; whereas they had nothing but a 

miscellaneous collection of brown and white trout.  But, just as they were thinking of going ashore, 

for the dusk was now coming

To be a rocky generation,     A people currish, churlish as the seas,     And rude almost as rudest 

savages;     With whom I did and may re-sojourn when     Rocks turn to rivers, rivers turn to men". 

As he returned voluntarily to this exile, we must imagine the miracle to have taken place, or 

perhaps his own heart had been tamed by his adversity.  The southern moor is watered by on, a 

most extraordinary piece of luck befell them.  Miss Carry was scarcely thinking of the rods when 

the sudden shriek of one of the reels startled her out of her idle contemplation.  'Surely that is a 

salmon, Ronald!' she cried, as she instantly grasped the rod and got it up.  He did not stay to 

answer, for his business was to get in the other line as fast as possible.  But he had just
