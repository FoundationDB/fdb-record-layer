dracaena marginata general truth of their subject-matter, the public is als=

om God to drive you out of France." Finally, the representatives of the Chu=
rch gave it as their opinion _
preserve the same decorum. They show us those aspects of man=E2=80=99s fort=
une which are of interest to=20

all men; of course we are free to fill in the gaps according to our taste i=
n gossip, but the dramatist=20

awakens our feelings and calls our attention only to general experiences an=
d common wisdom. In=20

Shakespeare, _Measure for Measure_ is a good example, a noble tragedy and a=
 decent play. It is=20

less glorious than the _Antigone_, obviously, since it shows human nature r=
esisting temptation=20

rather than establishing an ideal, but the grimness of its subject and the =
fact that it portrays an=20

indecent character do not make it indecent, as some critics think. Its powe=
r is its probing into=20

general truths of life, chiefly into the capriciousness of temptation where=
 sex is concerned, and into=20

the various forms of the fear of death.  Claudio, condemned to die and conv=
inced that there is no=20

hope, persuades himself that he does not care to live; but immediately he h=
as a chance to live at=20

the cost of his sister=E2=80=99s honor, and he finds himself slipping into =
casuistry to make his escape=20

possible even on such terms. Here is introspection of the Sophoclean sort, =
touching the=20

psychology not of a particular man but of all of us. Walter Pater remarked =
the paradox that Angelo=20

is tempted to his fall by sight of the pure-minded Isabella, the incarnatio=
n of virtue. He might have=20

named other paradoxes of Isabella=E2=80=99s influence. She fascinates all t=
he men she meets, good or=20

bad. At the end of the play the Duke announces that he intends to marry her=
 himself, and since he=20

gives her little opportunity to dispute this plan, Might she not be, if not=
hing worse, merely a poor=20

demented creature? His mind had been much tormented by doubts of his own le=
gitimacy. The=20

English openly proclaimed him no son of Charles VI.; his mother's intimacy =
with Orleans was too=20

notorious and too recent a scandal to be concealed, and he had been born at=
 the very moment=20

when that intimacy was at its height, while she who was his mother had acte=
d as if there were=20

good reason why he should not inherit the crown; is it any wonder that the =
wretched young prince=20

himself half believed the allegations of his foes? He desired reassurance o=
n this point, and it was=20

doubtless to ask some question of the kind that he now led Jeanne d'Arc asi=
de and seemed to=20

converse with her in low tones. All that passed between them has never been=
 told, since Jeanne=20

refused to reveal it; but the courtiers saw his countenance light up, and i=
t was known that she had=20

told him good news, and this much she confessed to having said: "I am sent =
from God to assure=20

you that you are the true heir of France, the son of the King."  The dauphi=
n may have been=20

momentarily converted to faith in Jeanne la Pucelle; but he was vacillating=
, and some of his wisest=20

councillors, including the chancellor, would not believe in her. She must f=
irst be proved no witch=20

and a pure virgin. To both these tests Jeanne submitted willingly and coura=
geously, and from both=20

she came out vindicated. As they prepared to take her to Poitiers, where so=
me half dozen learned=20

doctors of the church were to focus their wisdom upon this poor child, she =
said: "Well do I see that=20

many a hard trial=20


_
speculate how far his motives differ essentially from Angelo=E2=80=99s. But=
 Lucio, the wretch so steeped by=20

habit in indecency that he can hardly frame a clean sentence, is immediatel=
y and permanently=20

sensitive to Isabella=E2=80=99s beauty of soul as well as of body. Why? Sha=
kespeare merely exhibits the=20

paradox, in his characteristic way, without hint of explanation. But we may=
 read a lesson in=20

decorum, if we but God will aid me. Let us go, then, with stout hearts." Du=
ring the interrogation to=20

which she was subjected by the theologians, the one dominant characteristic=
 of the girl--not of the=20

saint--was strongly brought out: her common sense. Her answers, though naiv=
e and utterly=20

unsophisticated, by their frankness and good sense frequently discomfited t=
he most adroit=20

catechists. One of the doctors=20


_
the decency of art, from the first speech of Lucio to Isabella in the nunne=
ry, when the dirty-minded=20

wretch, having none but coarse formulas in his vocabulary, tries to address=
 her with the reverence=20

he feels.   V  On all this the moralist may comment that decency as a matte=
r of art is one thing,=20

and the protection of public morals is another; that however artists may be=
 God wishes to deliver=20

the people of France he has no need of men-at-arms." With readiness and rat=
ional, half-humorous=20

shrewdness, Jeanne replied: "Ah! my God! the men-at-arms will fight, and Go=
d will give the=20

victory." Then Brother Seguin, "a very sour man," with a strong twang of hi=
s native Limoges, would=20

fain know "what tongue these Heavenly visitors spoke?" "A better than=20
