The first was a petition for relief. The petitioner himself stood there in =
person, looking the very=20

picture of forlorn destitution. He stated that he had lost his canoe (_kaya=
k_), and he produced=20

evidence enough to show, without any swearing, false or otherwise, that it =
had been crushed and=20

lost in the ice. The man, who had hardly clothes on his back to cover his n=
akedness, showed=20

further that he had a wife and family, who had no friends to assist them, a=
nd were entirely=20

dependent upon himself for support. I thought it a doubtful support at best=
, and so appeared to=20

think the Parliament, since they voted an order for a small stipend of food=
 and clothing, as per=20

schedule, to be drawn by the wife from the public store-house, and paid for=
 out of the=20

Parliamentary funds. The man was sent to work in the Government blubber-hou=
se, at myskin pst=20

niin etlle, ettei sielt kumukaan kuuluisi.  -- Ei, painetaan eteenpin, ensi=
 viikolla ollaan perill, vaati=20

Paavo.  -- Ensi viikolla, niin, pid sin huoli pivist ja viikoista, niit en =
min muista. Mutta eteenpin sit on=20

painettava!  Ja he nousivat ja samoilivat taas koillista kohden joen latvoi=
lle ja siitkin viel eteenpin=20

kankaiden poikki, halki aution luonnon, jossa ei elvn merkki nkynyt muuta, =
kuin joskus vesakon=20

rintaa koikkelehtava jnis tai repo, joka sikhtyneen viiletti aavikon poikki=
, tai iseen aikaan susi, jonka=20

silm pimess hehkui ja joka, uskaltamatta kyd saaliin kimppuun, etmp haikeas=
ti ulvahti.  Mutta ern=20

 luminen selk, jonka=20

day.  The next case was similar in character, only the petitioner was a wel=
l-known young hunter=20

who had lost his kayak by a fearful accident, which had nearly cost him his=
 life as well as boat, and=20

from the effects of which he had barely now recovered. All that I could com=
prehend was that some=20

of his ribs had been stove in. The case being proven, the question before P=
arliament was mahtava=20

tunturimaa, joka rajoitti taivaanrannan ja jonka keskest kohosi pilvi kohde=
n tasalakinen Pyhtunturi=20

ja Rukatunturin srmiset huiput. He olivat perill, lysivt piakkoin iilisten =
vanhan kalasaunankin=20

lounaiselta rannalta ja asettuivat siihen aluksi.  Mutta kauaksi eivt. Viel=
