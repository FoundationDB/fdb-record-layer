his intentions?  "Why do you think so?"  "My last master, the baron (Janos =
had been at some baron's before in Saros county), used to say to his sons, =
and he was a clever man _
which the maddened torrents, rushing from the lofty chain of mountains, boi=
l along until they meet=20

the Atbara, and assist to flood the Nile. No one could explore these tremen=
dous torrents, the=20

Settite, Royan, Angrab, Salaam, and Atbara, without at once comprehending t=
heir effect upon the=20

waters of the Nile. The magnificent chain of mountains from which they flow=
, is not a simple line of=20

abrupt sides, but the precipitous slopes are the walls of a vast plateau, t=
hat receives a prodigious=20

rainfall in June, July, August, until the middle of September, the entire d=
rainage of which is carried=20

away by the above-named channels to inundate Lower Egypt."  Not being able =
to cross the river at=20

the point of junction with the Salaam, I continued along the margin of the =
precipice that overhangs=20

the latter river, until I should find a place by which we could descend wit=
h the camel, as this animal=20

had made a great circuit to avoid the difficulties of the Angrab. We were a=
t length united, and were=20

continuing our route parallel with the river, over undulations of withered =
grass about three feet=20

high, interspersed with trees, when I perceived above the surface the long =
horns of a mehedehet=20

(R. Ellipsiprymna). I knew that he must be lying down, and, as he was about=
 a hundred and fifty=20

yards distant, I stalked him carefully from tree to tree; presently I obser=
ved three other pairs of=20

horns at various distances; two were extremely large; but, unfortunately, a=
n animal with smaller=20

horns was lying between me and the largest. I could do no more than creep q=
uietly from point to=20

point, until the smaller animal should start and alarm the larger. This it =
did when I was about a=20

hundred yards from the large bull, and both mehedehets sprang up, and, as i=
s usual with this=20

species, they stood for a few moments seeking for the danger. My clothes an=
d hunting cap=20

matched so well with the bark of the tree behind which I was kneeling, that=
 I was unobserved, and,=20

taking a rest against the stem with the little Fletcher, I fired both barre=
ls, the right at the most=20

distant bull. Both animals simply sprang for an instant upon their hind leg=
s, and fell. This was=20

capital; but at the report of the rifle, up jumped two other mehedehets, wh=
ich appeared the=20

facsimiles of those I had just shot; having missed their companions, and se=
eing no one, they stood=20

motionless and gazed in all directions.  I had left my people far behind wh=
en I had commenced the=20

stalk, therefore I had no spare rifle. I reloaded behind the tree with all =
haste. I had capped the=20

nipples, and, as I looked out from my covering point, I saw them still in t=
he same spot; the larger,=20

with superb horns, was about a hundred and twenty yards distant. Again I to=
ok a rest, and fired.=20

He sprang away as though untouched for the first three or four bounds, when=
 he leapt convulsively=20

in the air, and fell backwards. This was too much for the remaining animal,=
 that was standing=20

about a hundred yards distant--he bounded off; but the last barrel of the l=
ittle Fletcher caught him=20

through the neck at full gallop, and he fell all of a heap, stone dead.  Th=
ese were the prettiest=20

shots I ever recollect to have made, in a very long experience; I had bagge=
d four with the same=20

rifle in as many shots, as quickly as I could load and fire.  My Tokroori, =
Abdoolahi, who had been=20

intently watching the shots from a distance, came rushing up in hot excitem=
ent with one of my=20

sharp hunting knives, and, springing forward to hamstring one of the animal=
s, that was still=20

struggling, he foolishly made a downward cut, and, missing his blow, he cut=
 his own leg terribly=20

across the shin, the knife flying out of his hand as it struck against the =
bone: he was rendered=20

helpless immediately. I tied up the wound with my handkerchief, and, having=
 at length loaded the=20

camel with as much meat as we could cut off the animals, Abdoolahi was assi=
sted upon its back;=20

my men carried the two finest heads. It was very late, and we now sought fo=
r a path by which we=20

could descend to the river.  At length we discovered a dangerous antelope-t=
rack, that descended=20



obliquely, by skirting an exceedingly steep side of a hill, with a perpendi=
cular precipice=20

immediately below, that fell for about seventy feet sheer to the river. My =
horse Tetel was as sure-

footed as a goat, therefore, having taken off my shoes to avoid slipping, I=
 led him to the bottom=20

safely. Taher Noor called to the camel-driver not to attempt to follow. Alt=
hough warned, this fellow=20

persisted in leading the heavily-laden animal down the slippery and dangero=
us path. Hardly had=20

he gone a few paces, when the camel's feet slipped, and it shot down the ra=
pid incline, and=20

disappeared over the edge of the precipice. I heard the camel roar, and, ha=
stening up the path, I=20

looked over the cliff, him the whole time. How convenient it would be if th=
ere were some romance=20

nowadays, as in olden times or in novels; for instance, if robbers were now=
 to appear on the=20

scene, and he could shoot them down one after the other with his revolver, =
and so free Veronica,=20

who would then turn to him and say:  "I am yours till death!"  But as matte=
rs were at present, he=20

did not dare to take any steps in the right direction; the words he had so =
well prepared seemed to=20

stick in his throat. Doubts arose in his mind; supposing she had not taken =
a fancy to him!=20

Supposing she were already in love! She must have seen other men besides hi=
mself, and if so,=20

they _must_ have fallen in love with her. Something ought to happen to help=
 matters on a little.=20

But no robbers came, there probably were none; it was a poor neighborhood, =
nothing grew there,=20

not even a robber.  After they had passed the wood, they saw an old castle =
among the trees, on=20

the top of a hill. It was the Castle of Slatina, had formerly belonged to t=
he Czobors, and was now=20

the property of the Princes of Coburg.  They had to stop at an inn to feed =
the horses, and Veronica=20

proposed their going to look at the castle, of which an old man had charge;=
 he would show them=20

over it. The innkeeper assured them some of the rooms were just as the Czob=
ors had left them; in=20

the court were a few old cannon, and in the house a collection of curious o=
ld armor, and some=20

very interesting family portraits, among them that of a little girl, Katali=
n Czobor, who had=20

disappeared from her home at the age of seven. Veronica was very interested=
 in the child.  "And=20

what happened to her?" she asked.  "The poor child has never turned up to t=
his day!" sighed the=20

innkeeper.  "And when was it she disappeared?"  "About three hundred years =
ago," he answered=20

with a smile, and then accompanied his guests up the mountain path that led=
 to the castle.  They=20

were silent on their return, only Madame Krisbay remarking:  "What a mouldy=
 smell there was in=20

there!"  Veronica had caught sight of a beautiful rose on a large bush near=
 the half-ruined walls of=20

the bastion.  "What an exquisite flower!" she exclaimed.  The old caretaker=
 had a legend about=20

that too. From this spot beautiful Maria Czobor had sprung from the walls, =
and thrown herself=20

down the precipice, for her father wished her to marry an officer in the Em=
peror's army, and she=20

was in love with a shepherd. The latter had planted a rose-bush on this spo=
t, and every year it=20

bore one single blossom. Gyuri dropped behind the others, and begged the ol=
d man to give him=20

the rose.  "My dear sir, what are you thinking of? Why, the poor girl's spi=
rit would haunt me if I=20

were to do such a thing!"  Gyuri took out his purse and pressed two silver =
florins into the man's=20

hand, upon which, without further ado, he took out his knife and cut the ro=
se.  "Won't the young=20

lady's spirit haunt you now?" asked Gyuri, smiling.  "No, because with part=
 of the money I will have=20

a Mass said for the repose of her soul."  Gyuri ran after the ladies with t=
he rose in his hand, and=20

offered it to Veronica.  "Here is Maria Czobor's rose," he said. "Will you =
give me your pink in=20

exchange?"  But she put her hands behind her back, and said coldly:  "How c=
ould you have the=20

heart to pick it?"  "I did it for your sake. Will you not exchange?"  "No; =
I would not for the world=20



wear that flower; I should think I had stolen it from that poor girl."  "Wi=
ll you really not accept it?"=20

"No!"  Gyuri threw the rose away, and it rolled down the hillside in the du=
st and dirt.  Veronica=20

gazed pityingly after the flower as long as it was visible, then turned ang=
rily to Gyuri.  "Is that the=20

way to treat a flower? Had it hurt you in any way?"  "Yes," answered the la=
wyer shortly.  "Did it=20

prick you?"  "It informed me of a very unpleasant fact."  "What was it?"  "=
It whispered the=20

continuation of my last night's dream to me."  "What a little chatterbox!" =
 She turned her big eyes=20

upon Gyuri and spoke in a jesting tone.  "I should have had a refusal!"  Ve=
ronica threw back her=20

head, and turned her eyes toward heaven.  "Poor Mr. Wibra!" she exclaimed. =
"What misfortune to=20

be refused in a dream!"  "Pray go on, make as much fun of it as you like," =
he said bitterly.  "And=20

are you sure you would have been refused?"  "Yes, now I am sure of it," he =
answered sadly. "You=20

might guess now of whom I dreamed."  "Of me?" she asked surprised, and the =
smile died away on=20

her lips. "Of me?" she stammered again, then was silent, descending the hil=
l quietly in madame's=20

wake with bent head. She had lifted the skirt of her dress a little to prev=
ent its dragging in the dust,=20

and her little feet were partly visible as she tripped along with regular s=
teps, treading on the grass=20

and flowers, which, however, were not crushed by her=20


_
perceived that the animal was fortunately caught upon a narrow ledge of roc=
k, and was prevented=20

from falling to the bottom by a tough bush that grew from a cleft; this alo=
ne supported it in mid-air.=20

My Arabs were wild and stupid. Abdoolahi had held on like a leech, and, as =
we were well provided=20

with strong ropes, we soon hauled him up, but the Arabs declared their came=
l to be dead, as no=20

power on earth could save it. Having examined the cliff, I felt sure that w=
e could assist the camel,=20

unless it had already broken some bones by the fall; accordingly, I gave or=
ders to the Arabs, who=20

obeyed implicitly, as they were so heart-broken at the idea of losing their=
 animal, that they had lost=20

all confidence in themselves. We lowered down Taher Noor by a rope to the b=
ush, and after some=20

difficulty, he unfastened the load of flesh, which he threw piece by piece =
to a platform of rock=20

below, about ten feet square, which formed a shelf a few inches above the l=
evel of the water. The=20

camel being relieved of both the load and its saddle, I ordered the Arabs t=
o fasten together all their=20

but rose again as she passed on.  A tiny lizard crossed their path, its bea=
utiful colors shining in the=20

sunlight. But what a sad fate befell it! Just at that moment a giant (well =
known in Besztercebanya)=20

came that way, murmuring: "Why should it live?" and bringing down a heavy h=
eel severed the poor=20

lizard's head from its body.  Veronica just then turned round, and saw the =
cruel action; she felt=20

inclined to cry over the poor lizard, but did not dare to say anything, for=
 she herself began to be=20

afraid of this Goliath, so she only murmured under her breath: "Wretch!"  W=
hen they were farther=20

down the hill she saw before her the rose he had thrown away; there it lay,=
 dirty and dusty, among=20

the stones by the roadside, and, obeying a sudden impulse, she bent and pic=
ked it up, blowing the=20

dust off its rosy petals, and then she placed it in the bosom of her dress,=
 where it seemed as=20

though it were in its right place at last. She did not say a word, nor did =
she look at that dreadful=20

Goliath, but turned away her head, so that he could not see her face. But G=
oliath was quite=20

satisfied=20


_
immensely strong, and, as I had established a rule that seven extra bundles=
 should invariably=20

accompany the water-camel, we had a large supply. The camel was now secured=
 by a rope=20

passed round the body beneath the forelegs, and the cloths of the Arabs wer=
e wrapped around=20

the cord to prevent it from cutting the skin. This being arranged, I took a=
 double turn of the rope=20

round a tree, as thick as a man's thigh, that grew in a cleft of the rock w=
here we stood, and=20

throwing the honey axe to Taher Noor, I told him to cut away the bushes tha=
t supported the camel,=20

and I would lower it gently down to the shelf by the water's edge. In a few=
 minutes the bushes=20

were cut away, and the it to be, and out of gratitude would have liked to r=
estore the lizard to life,=20

but that was of course impossible.  At the foot of the hill the carriage wa=
s waiting, and the=20

travellers took their places again, this time with an uncomfortable feeling=
. Silently they sat opposite=20

each other, one looking to the right, the other to the left, and if their e=
yes happened to meet they=20

hastily turned them away. When they spoke, their remarks were addressed to =
Madame Krisbay,=20

who began to notice that something had happened.  But what? Only a few chil=
dish words to which=20

their minds had given a more serious meaning than they were meant to have, =
and had increased=20

in size as once the=20


_
swung in mid-air. Taher Noor held on to the rope, while I slacked off the l=
ine from the tree, and=20

lowered both man and beast safely to the shelf, about seventy feet below. T=
he camel was unhurt,=20

and the Arabs were delighted; two other men now descended. We threw them do=
wn a quantity of=20

dry wood to make a fire, and, as they were well off for meat, we left them =
prisoners upon the ledge=20

of rock with the profoundly deep river before them, walled in by abrupt pre=
cipices upon either=20

side.* It was nearly dark, and, having to find my way to the camp among dan=
gerous ravines, I rode=20

fast ahead of my men to discover a ford, and to reach home before complete =
darkness should=20

increase the danger. Tetel was as sure-footed and as nimble as a cat, but w=
e very nearly ended=20

enlarged to such an extent that the whole town had place in it. Well, in th=
ose few words,=20

everything was contained.  But now something else happened. I don't know ho=
w it was, but I think=20

a pin dropped, and at the same moment Veronica bent down as though to look =
for it. In doing so=20

the pink fell out of her hair into Gyuri's lap, and he picked it up in orde=
r to return it to her. But she=20

made him a sign to keep it.  "If it _would_ not stay in my hair, and fell i=
nto your lap, you may as=20

well keep it."  _Would_ it not have stayed in her hair? Was it quite an acc=
ident? thought Gyuri, as=20

he smelt the flower. What a pleasant odor it had! Was it from her hair?  No=
w they were driving=20

beside the Brana, the far-famed Brana, which quite shuts this part of the c=
ountry=20


_
days together, as the bank of a precipice gave way while we were skirting t=
he edge. I felt it sinking,=20

but the horse sprang forward and saved himself, as I heard the mass fall be=
neath.    * On the=20

following morning the camel was safely     floated across the river, suppor=
ted by the inflated=20

skins of the mehedehets.  That night we received a very audacious visit. I =
was asleep in my tent,=20

when I was suddenly awakened by a slight pull at my sleeve, which was the s=
ignal always given=20

by my wife if anything was wrong; on such occasions, I never replied until =
I had gently grasped my=20

little Fletcher, which always slept with me beneath my mat. She now whisper=
ed that a hyaena had=20

been within the tent, but that it had just bolted out, as these animals are=
 so wary that they detect=20

the slightest movement or noise. As a rule, I never shot at hyaenas, but, a=
s I feared it might eat=20

our saddles, I lay in bed with the rifle to my immense gate. That is why it=
 is called the Brana, or=20

gate. It is no common mountain, but an aristocrat among its kind, and in fi=
ne weather it wears a=20

hat, for its summit is hidden in clouds. Several small streams make their w=
ay down its side, flowing=20

together at the foot, and making one broad stream.  "That is the Bjela Voda=
," explained Veronica=20

to Madame Krisbay, "we are not far from home now."  They still had to drive=
 through one wood,=20

and then the little white cottages of Glogova would be before them. But thi=
s was the worst bit of=20

the road, crooked and curved, full of ruts and rocks, and so narrow that th=
ere was hardly room for=20

the carriage to pass.  Janos turned round and said with a shake of his head=
:  "The king himself=20

would grow crooked here!"  "Take care, Janos, that you don't upset us!"  Ja=
nos got down from his=20

seat, and fastened one of the wheels firmly, for there was no brake to the =
carriage; and now the=20

horses=20


_
tent door through which the moon was shining brightly. In a few minutes, a =
grey-looking object=20

stood like an apparition at the entrance, peering into the tent to see if a=
ll were right before it=20

entered. I touched the trigger, and the hyaena fell dead, with funeral pace=
, and sometimes the=20

road was so narrow between two hills that they could see nothing but the bl=
ue sky above them.=20

"This place is only fit for birds," muttered Janos.  "Don't you like this p=
art of the country?"  "It is like=20

a pock-marked face,"=20
