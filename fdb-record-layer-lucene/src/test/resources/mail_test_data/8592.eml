spot, towards which my wife, and the aggageers encumbered with the unwilling apes, were 

already hastening. Upon arrival I found, in high yellow grass beneath a large tree, the tetel dead, 

and Abou Do wiping his bloody sword, surrounded by the foremost of the party. He had hamstrung 

the animal so delicately, that the keen edge of the blade was not injured against the bone. My two 

bullets had passed through the tetel; the first was too high, having entered above the shoulder--

this had dropped the animal for a moment; the second was through the flank.  The priest was 

obliged to turn away now and then to hide the tears of gratitude. He reproached himself, too, for 

his hard thoughts of the good villagers. "How I have misjudged them!" he thought to himself. 

"There are no better people in the world. And how they love the child!"  At tea-time Widow 

Adamecz appeared on the scene; until now she had not troubled much about the new priest. She 

considered herself entitled to a word in the management of the ecclesiastical affairs of the village, 

and based her rights on the fact of her father having grown a

tied the baboons to trees, and employed themselves in carefully skinning the tetel so as to form a 

sack from the hide; they had about half finished the operation, when we were disturbed by a 

peculiar sound at a considerable distance in the jungle, which, being repeated, we knew to be the 

cry of buffaloes. In an instant the tetel grave, which, of course, gave him a place among the saints 

at once.  "Your reverence," she began, "you will want some one to look after the child."  "Yes, of 

course, I ought to have some one," he replied, "but the parish is poor, and ..."  "Nobody is poor but 

the devil," burst out Widow Adamecz, "and he's poor because he has no

leaving my wife with a few men to take charge of the game, accompanied by Florian we went in 

search of the buffaloes. This part of the country was covered with grass about nine feet high, that 

was reduced to such extreme dryness that the stems broke into several pieces like glass as we 

brushed through it. The jungle was open, composed of thorny mimosas at such wide intervals, that 

a horse could be ridden at considerable speed if accustomed to the country. Altogether it was the 

perfection of ground for shooting, and the chances were in favour of the rifle.  We had proceeded 

carefully about half a mile when I heard a rustling in the grass, and I shortly perceived a bull

will often be hungry, and you can't take her across to the schoolmaster's each time. You must 

have some one to cook at home, your reverence. The sacristan is all very well for sweeping and 

tidying up a bit, but what does he know about children?"  "True, true; but where am I to ..." 

"Where? And am _I_ not here? The Lord created me for a priest's cook, I'm sure."  "Yes, I 

daresay. But how am I to pay your wages?"  Widow Adamecz put her hands on her hips, and 

planted herself in front of Father Janos.  "Never mind about that, your honor. Leave it to God and 

to me. He will pay me. I shall enter your service this evening, and shall bring all my saucepans and 

things with

the grass had been entirely destroyed by the trampling of a large herd. I took aim at the shoulder 

with one of my No. 10 Reilly rifles, and the buffalo rushed forward at the shot, and fell about a 

hundred paces beyond in the bush. At the report of the shot, the herd that we had not observed, 

which had been lying upon the sandy bed of the stream, rushed past us with a sound like thunder, 

in a cloud of dust raised by several hundreds of large animals in full  The priest was more and 

more surprised, but even more astonished was his friend Urszinyi when he came over toward 

evening and the priest related the events of the day, and told him of Widow Adamecz's offer. 

"What!" he exclaimed, "Widow Adamecz? That old witch? And without payment? Why, Janos, a 

greater miracle never yet happened. An inhabitant of Glogova working for payment from Heaven! 

You seem to have bewitched the people."  The priest only smiled, but
