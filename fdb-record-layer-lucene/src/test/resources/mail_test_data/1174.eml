"Yes--both. Not only with death but with shame."  "And still she refuses?"  "Apparently," said 

Martin-Roget with ever-growing irritation.  "It is often difficult," rejoined Chauvelin meditatively, "to 

compel these aristos. They are obstinate...."  "Oh! don't forget that I am in a position now to bring 

additional pressure on the wench. That lout Carrier has splendid ideas--a brute, what? but clever 

and full of resource. That suggestion of his about the Rat Mort is splendid...."  "You mean to try 

and act on it?"  "Of course I do," said Martin-Roget roughly. "I am going over presently to my 

sister's house to see the Kernogan wench again, and to have another talk with her. Then if she still 

refuses, if she still chooses to scorn the honourable position which I offer her, I shall act on 

Carrier's suggestion. It will be at the Rat Mort to-night that she and I will have our final interview, 

and there when I dangle the prospect of Cayenne and the convict's brand before her, she may not 

prove so obdurate as she has been up to now."  "H'm! That is as may be," was Chauvelin's dry 

comment. "Personally I am inclined to agree with Carrier. Death, swift and sure--the Loire or the 

guillotine--is the best that has yet been invented for traitors and aristos. But we won't discuss that 

again. I know your feelings in the matter and in a measure I respect them. But if you will allow me I 

would like to be present at your interview with the _soi-disant_ Lady Anthony Dewhurst. I won't 

disturb you and I won't say a word ... but there is something I would like to make sure of...."  "What 

is that?"  "Whether the wench has any hopes ..." said Chauvelin slowly, "whether she has received 

a message or has any premonition ... whether in short she thinks that outside agencies are at work 

on her behalf."  "Tshaw!" exclaimed Martin-Roget impatiently, "you are still harping on that Scarlet 

Pimpernel idea."  "I am," retorted the other drily.  "As you please. But understand, citizen 

Chauvelin, that I will not allow you to interfere with my plans, whilst you go off on one of those 

wild-goose chases which have already twice brought you into disrepute."  "I will not interfere with 

your plans, citizen," rejoined Chauvelin with unwonted gentleness, "but let me in my turn impress 

one thing upon you, and that is that unless you are as wary as the serpent, as cunning as the fox, 

all your precious plans will be upset by I'll rest a bit now, and begin a search for Fergus by the first 

streak of dawn."  In pursuance of this intention, the wearied man lay down, and putting his head 

on a mossy pillow, fell into a profound sleep, which was not broken till the sun was high in the 

heavens on the following day.  When at last he did awake, and attempted to sit up, Dan felt, to his 

surprise and no small alarm, that he was as weak as a child, that his leg lay in a pool of 

coagulated gore, and that blood was still slowly trickling from the wound in his thigh.  Although 

disposed to lie down and give way to an almost irresistible tendency to slumber, Dan was too well 

aware that death stared him in the face to succumb to the feeling without a struggle.  He therefore 

made a mighty effort of will; sat up; undid the soaking bandage, and proceeded to extemporise a 

sort of tourniquet with it and a short piece of stick.  The contrivance, rude as it was, proved 

effectual, for it stopped the bleeding, but Dan could not help feeling that he had already lost so 

much blood that he was reduced almost to the last stage of exhaustion, and that another hour or 

two would probably see the close of his earthly career.  Nothing, perhaps, could have impressed 

this truth upon him so forcibly as his inability to shout when he tried to do so.  In the faint hope that 

Fergus might be within call, he raised his voice with the full knowledge that he ran the risk of 

attracting a foe instead of a comrade.  The sound that complied with the impulse of his will would 

have made him laugh if he had not felt an amazing and unaccountable disposition to cry.  Up to 

that period of his life--almost from his earliest babyhood--Dan Davidson's capacious chest had 



always contained the machinery, and the power, to make the nursery or the welkin ring with 

almost unparalleled violence.  Now, the chest, though still capacious, and still full of the 

machinery, seemed to have totally lost the power, for the intended shout came forth in a gasp and 

ended in a sigh.  It was much the same when he essayed to rise.  His legs almost refused to 

support him; everything appeared to swim before his eyes, and he sank down again listlessly on 

the ground.  For the first time, perhaps, in his life, the strong man had the conviction effectually 

carried home to him that he was mortal, and could become helpless.  The advantage of early 

training by a godly mother became

Englishman whom you choose to disregard."  "What do you mean?"  "I mean that I know him--to 

my cost--and you do not. But you will, an I am not gravely mistaken, make acquaintance with him 

ere your great adventure with these Kernogan people is successfully at an end. Believe me, 

citizen Martin-Roget," he weakness, for his first impulse was to pray for help, and the resulting 

effect--whether men choose to call it natural or supernatural--was at least partial relief from 

anxiety, and that degree of comfort which almost invariably arises from a state of resignation. 

After a brief rest, the power of active

"Pshaw! you are not childish enough to imagine, citizen Chauvelin, that your Englishman can spirit 

away that wench from under my sister's eyes? Do you know what my sister suffered at the hands 

of the Kernogans? Do you think that she is like to forget my father's ignominious death any more 

than I am? And she mourns a lover as well as a father--she mourns her youth, her happiness, the 

mother whom she worshipped. Think you a better gaoler could be found anywhere? And there are 

friends of mine--lads of our own village, men who hate the Kernogans as bitterly as I do myself--

who are only too ready to lend Louise a hand in case of violence. And after that--suppose your 

magnificent Scarlet Pimpernel succeeded in hoodwinking my sister and in evading the vigilance of 

a score of determined village lads, who would sooner die one by one than see the Kernogan 

escape--suppose all that, I say, there would still be the guard at every city gate to challenge. No! 

no! it couldn't be done, citizen Chauvelin," he added with a complacent laugh. "Your Englishman 

would need the help of a legion of angels, what? to get the wench out of Nantes this time." 

Chauvelin made no comment on his colleague's impassioned harangue. Memory had taken him 

back to that one day in September in Boulogne when he too had set one prisoner to Dan, again 

raising himself on one elbow, tried to rouse himself to the necessity of immediate action of some 

sort if his life was to be saved.  The spot on which he had lain, or rather fallen down, on the 

preceding night happened to be the fringe of the forest where it bordered on an extensive plain or 

stretch of prairie land.  It was surrounded by a dense growth of trees and bushes, except on the 

side next the plain, where an opening permitted of an extensive view over the undulating country. 

No better spot could have been chosen, even in broad daylight, for an encampment, than had 

been thus fallen upon by the hunter in the darkness of night.  But the poor man felt at once that 

this advantage could be of no avail to him, for in the haste of landing he had thought only of his 

gun, and had left his axe, with the bag containing materials for making fire, in the canoe. 

Fortunately he had not divested himself of his powder-horn or shot-pouch, so he was not without 

the means of procuring food, but of what use could these be, he reflected, if he had not strength to 

use them?  Once again, in the energy of determination, he rose up and shouldered his gun with 

the intention of making his way across the plain, in the hope that he might at all events reach the 

wigwam of some wandering Indian, but he trembled so from excessive weakness that he was 

obliged to give up the attempt, and again sank down with 


_
to his mind a vision of a strangely picturesque figure as it appeared to him in the window-

embrasure of the old castle-hall:[1] it brought back to his ears the echo of that quaint, irresponsible 

laughter, of that lazy, drawling speech, of all that had acted as an irritant on his nerves ere he 

found himself baffled, foiled, eating out his heart with vain reproach at his despair.  To add to his 

distress, hunger now assailed him so violently that he would have roasted and eaten his 

moccasins--as many a starving man had done before him, though without much benefit--but even 

this resource was denied him for the want of fire, and raw moccasin was not only indigestible but 

uneatable!  Still, as it seemed his only hope, he gathered a few dry
