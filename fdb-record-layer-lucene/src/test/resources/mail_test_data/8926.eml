The Weeds, Carl Ewald Some it steadily for more than seven months when that which I am now 

about to relate took place.  It was in the month of March.  The weather had been unsettled for 

some days past, and the nights stormy; and at one point along the line, near Ponte di Brenta, the 

waters had risen and swept away some seventy yards of embankment.  Since this accident, the 

trains had all been obliged to stop at a certain spot between Padua and Ponte di Brenta, and the 

passengers, with their luggage, had thence to be transported in all kinds of vehicles, by a 

circuitous country road, to the nearest station on the other side of the gap, where another train and 

engine awaited them. This, of course, caused great confusion and annoyance, put all our time-

tables wrong, and subjected the public to a large amount of inconvenience.  In the meanwhile an 

army of navvies was drafted to the spot, and worked day and night to repair the damage.  At this 

time I was driving two through trains each day; namely, one from Mantua to Venice in the early 

morning, and a return train from Venice to Mantua in the afternoon--a tolerably full day's work, 

covering about one

ten and eleven hours.  I was therefore not best pleased when, on the third or fourth day after the 

accident, I was informed that, in addition to my regular allowance of work, I should that evening be 

required to drive a special train to Venice.  This special train, consisting of an engine, a single 

carriage, and a break-van, was to leave the Mantua platform at eleven; at Padua the passengers 

were to alight and find post-chaises waiting to convey them to Ponte di Brenta; at Ponte di Brenta 

another engine, carriage, and break-van were to be in readiness.  I was charged to accompany 

them throughout.  "Corpo di Bacco," said the clerk who gave me my orders, "you need not look so 

black, man.  You are certain of a handsome gratuity.  Do you know who goes with you?"  "Not I." 

"Not you, indeed!  Why, it's
