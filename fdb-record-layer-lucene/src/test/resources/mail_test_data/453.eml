K. Patents, Designs and so notified the defendant at the outset of the exam=
ination, and he=20

submitted voluntarily to a personal examination, and there was no intention=
 to prescribe or to act=20

as the defendant=E2=80=99s physician, it was held that the relation did not=
 exist, and that the physician=20

could testify as to the defendant=E2=80=99s physical condition.[389]  In on=
e New York case it has been said=20

that the relation is one of contract, and that the test is whether the phys=
ician would be chargeable=20

with malpractice or negligence for failure to advise or prescribe in case t=
he alleged patient were in=20

urgent need of it at the time.[390] But the decisions of the Court of Appea=
ls extend the privilege to=20

cases where this test would lead to a different conclusion.[391]  Where the=
 physician to a county=20

jail was called in to attend a prisoner and examined him, though there was =
no prescription at the=20

time, but it appeared that the doctor told the prisoner what he should pres=
cribe, and subsequently=20

two physicians came to see the prisoner at the instance of the coroner and =
examined him as they=20

would have examined one of their patients, though they did not prescribe an=
d had no conversation=20

about a prescription, it was held that the prisoner had, under the circumst=
ances, reason to=20

suppose that the relation of physician and patient did exist between him an=
d all three of the=20

physicians, and that their testimony as to what they learned on such visits=
 should have been=20

excluded; and the rule is thus stated: whenever the patient has reason to s=
uppose that the relation=20

exists and does in fact and truth so suppose, in a case where the physician=
 attends under=20

circumstances calculated to induce the opinion that his visit is of a profe=
ssional nature, and the=20

visit is so regarded and acted upon by the person attended, the relation of=
 physician and patient=20

contemplated by the statute may fairly be said to exist.[392]  But the fact=
 that it is the duty of a=20

physician to prescribe for a person in case of need, does not constitute th=
e relation, though the=20



position of the physician gives him the opportunity to observe such person;=
 so, therefore, a jail=20

physician was not precluded from testifying as to what he had observed of a=
 prisoner, where it did=20

not appear that he had ever attended the latter in a=20

erson in a professional=20

capacity or to acquire knowledge concerning him in such capacity, he cannot=
 disclose information=20

actually acquired in the performance of his duty. It has been said that a m=
edical attendant at an=20

insane asylum cannot testify as to the mental condition of an inmate;[394] =
and that a physician=20

employed in a hospital to notice and enter in its records the arrival and c=
ondition of the patients=20

coming in, cannot testify as to information so acquired.[395]  It is immate=
rial that another person=20

employs the physician to examine the patient, and to report to the employer=
, and that the person=20

examined does not appear to desire any knowledge as to his condition; if th=
