"What a pity." Still, it was all rather puzzling. For his talk of the growt=
h of the city, his view of its=20

mighty pulsing life, restless, heaving, leaping on, gripped her more than e=
ver before. And=20

moreover, now that Amy was dead, Ethel soon began to feel another Joe emerg=
ing out of some=20

period long ago. With a new and curious eagerness to find in him what her s=
ister had never known=20

(an eagerness she would have disclaimed with the utmost indignation), she b=
egan to probe into=20

Joe's past. And in answer to her questions he threw out hints of old ideals=
 in which the making of=20

money had played only a second part. He had meant to be an architect, a bui=
lder of another kind.=20

Instead of putting up "junk in the Bronx," he had meant to do something big=
 and new, something=20

bold and very French, "to make these infernal New Yorkers sit up and open t=
heir cold grey eyes."=20

At times he rather thrilled her with hints of his early bachelor life in Ne=
w York and Paris, his=20

student days.  About this time, one evening, he brought his partner home to=
 dinner, but the=20

experiment proved even more of a failure than it had in the past. Nourse ma=
de Ethel feel as before=20

his surly, jealous dislike of her presence in Joe's home. And Ethel's hosti=
lity redoubled. She=20

recalled what Amy had told her of his tiresome worship of work, its routine=
 and its dull detail. No=20

wonder Joe's ideals had died, with such a man in his office.  "What a pity =
you're his partner," her=20

manner plainly said to him, for she was not good at hiding dislikes. And to=
 that his gloomy eyes=20

rejoined, "What a damned shame it you were his wife."  But Nourse did not c=
ome again. And with=20

business dropped out of their talk, she and Joe turned to other things--sma=
ll happenings of the=20

household, amusing incidents of the day, and little problems to be solved. =
They were well into the=20

summer by now, and Susette ought to go to the seashore. They began to discu=
ss seaside hotels,=20

and chose a place along the Sound. It was decided that Emily should stay he=
re to look after Joe,=20

and that he should run up for his week-ends. In the meantime, as his busine=
ss improved, he=20

began to bring Ethel little surprises, candy or spring flowers, and to take=
 her out in his car at night.=20

They went to the theatre several times. And everything which was said or do=
ne upon such=20

occasions gave Ethel food for thinking.  At the seashore, with Susette on t=
he beach, hour after=20

hour, she thought about Joe and about herself. This thinking was long and c=
urious. It was=20

confused, barely conscious at times, all mingled with the long bright waves=
 that came rolling in=20

from the shining sea. The picture of her sister's face kept rising up befor=
e her there--of Amy in her=20

bedroom good-humouredly talking and smiling, and teaching Ethel how to get =
on; of Amy with her=20

husband, throwing swift, vigilant glances at him, kissing him, nestling in =
his arms. In her thinking=20

Ethel grew hot and cold, with jealousy, swift self-reproach and a new, alar=
ming tenderness. She=20

thought of Joe, of his every look, his smile and the tones of his gruff voi=
ce; of Joe grief-stricken=20

and half crazed, of Joe awakening, coming back. Again with a warm rush of f=
eelings, not=20

unmingled with dismay, she would go over in her mind their talks and the qu=
eer, almost guilty=20

expression that had often come in his eyes. For Amy had always been in the =
room.  For this=20

thinking, fresh fuel was given by Joe's weekly visits here. There was not m=
uch talk of Amy now,=20

her name had subtly dropped away, but Ethel could feel it behind the talk. =
"It would always be=20

there!" she would cry to herself. "Well, and why not?" she would demand. "W=
hy be such a jealous=20

cat? Would you let that hold you back?" It was all so involved, this Amy pa=
rt, with Ethel's own=20

earlier visions of happiness and a love of her own. Was this really love--t=
his queer, leaping feeling,=20

up and down, hot and cold, uncertain, tense, unhappy, hungry, undecided?  "=
Oh, if I could only=20

make up my mind!"  When with Joe, she had many moods. In some she grew rese=
ntful toward him=20



for forcing this upon her. But soon she would grow repentant. Her manner, f=
rom cool any of its=20

branches without having legally received the medical degree, is a misdemean=
or punishable with a=20

fine of not less than $250, or imprisonment for six months for the first of=
fence, and for subsequent=20

offences with a fine of not less than $500 or imprisonment for not less tha=
n one year, or both fine=20

=E2=80=94Every person=20

practising medicine or surgery in the State was required before January 1st=

sided or practised, for=20

registration, and all persons beginning to practise are likewise to appear =
and register within thirty=20



days after obtaining a license (Act of 1889, c. 181, s. 3, as amended Act o=
f 1891, c. 90).  Any=20

person applying for registration must produce and exhibit before the clerk =
a license from the board=20


_
eyes would grow absorbed, attentive, now to Joe and now to herself, grave, =
wistful, sad, and then=20

suddenly gay--though they only talked of little things, of Susette, the bea=
ch, the city, the coming=20

winter, household plans, his work, half spoken aspirations. Any one watchin=
g them in these talks=20

might have thought she was his wife.  Again came that disturbing sense of i=
ntimate relationship to=20

her sister who was dead. "I'm stepping into Amy's shoes." But this feeling =
began to be left behind.=20

It was back in the past; she was looking on. One day, when Susette had bump=
ed her head and=20

her aunt was comforting her, suddenly in a revealing flash came the thought=
, "I love you, oh, so=20

hard, my sweet! But I want another one all my own!"  When in September she =
and Susette went=20

back to Joe in the city, all this grew more intense and clear. For he would=
 not give her much longer=20

now; she saw that he had made up his mind. She felt his strength and tender=
ness, his hunger for=20

her growing. Sometimes it was frightening, the power he was gaining. A touc=
h of his hand and she=20

would grow cold. One evening when she had a headache, Joe bent over and kis=
sed her.  "Good-

night," he said, and left the room--left her burning, trembling. She presse=
d both hands tight to her=20

cheeks, pressed the hot tears from her eyes.   At other times, she told her=
self, "Yes, I'm going to=20

marry him. But there's nothing to be so excited about--or scared like this.=
 I know him now, I know=20

just what he is and what he is not. He is not a good that he was practising=
 medicine or surgery in=20

this State prior to March 7th, 1885, and thereupon the clerk shall register=
 the date, with the name=20

and residence of the applicant, and shall issue a certificate of registrati=
on. The certificate entitles=20

the recipient to practise in any county in the State, but if he removes his=
 residence to another=20

county he must exhibit his certificate to the clerk of such county and be r=
egistered. Persons having=20

a temporary license are not entitled to register but may practise so long a=
s the license is in force=20

(Act of 1889, c. 181, s. 4, as amended Act of 1891, c. 420).  PENALTY, EXCE=
PTIONS.=E2=80=94To=20

practise without registration and a certificate is a misdemeanor punishable=
 with a fine of from $25=20

to $100 or imprisonment for each offence, but this act does not apply to wo=
men pursuing the=20

avocation of midwife nor to reputable physicians or surgeons residing in a =
neighboring State=20

coming into the State for consultation with a registered physician of this =
State (Act of 1889, c. 181,=20

s. 5).  LICENSE FEE.=E2=80=94A license of $10 for each county in which he c=
arries on business is=20

exacted from every (itinerant?) medical practitioner, one-half for the use =
of the county and one-half=20

for the use of the State; but a State license may be obtained from the Stat=
e treasurer for $30 good=20

for twelve months, and he is then exempt from the portion of above tax due =
the State (Act 1891, c.=20

323).  FEES.=E2=80=94To the secretary of the board, before issuing a licens=
e or diploma, $10.  To the=20


_
things I had dreamed of, but he's so dear and kind and safe. And I want to =
have children." Gravely=20

wondering, she would look ahead. "You're no longer a child, my dear. Be str=
ong and sensible. This=20

is real. . . . It's getting rather cold tonight. I must run in and see if S=
usette is warm."  She still felt=20

Amy's presence. Out of the various rooms certain pictures, chairs and vases=
 forced themselves=20

upon her attention. For some time past she had disliked them. It seemed to =
her at moments as=20

though she could not have them here.  She knew what they were waiting for n=
ow. It was nearly the=20

end of October, and the day which both dreaded was nearly at hand, the anni=
versary of her death.=20

They spoke not a word to each other about it, except once when Joe said gru=
ffly:  "There's a bad=20

time coming for both of us. Let's try not to be morbid about it." As it dre=
w nearer she felt, she must=20

speak. She felt how this unspoken name of her sister would keep rising, ris=
ing, between them for=20

the rest of their lives. It was uncanny, it was like a spell, the force of =
this unspoken name; and she=20

thought, "I must break it!"  And yet she did not speak. She had little oppo=
rtunity, for she saw very=20

little of Joe that week. When the dreaded night arrived, he did not come ho=
me until very late. From=20

her room she heard him come in, and presently by the silence she knew he ha=
d settled himself to=20

work. She barely slept, rose early and dressed herself with a resolute  To =

Two members shall be hom=C5=93opathic physicians and one a lawyer (Act 1890=

Tuesday of January, April, July, and October of each year, and such other m=
eetings as it may=20

with his or her age, the time spent in the study of medicine, and the name =
and location of all=20

institutions granting to such applicant a degree or a certificate of lectur=

_
already Joe had gone.  It was a beautiful morning. With Susette she went to=
 a florist's shop and=20

had the child pick out some flowers. Then they went out to Amy's grave. And=
 a moment came to=20

Ethel there, an overwhelming moment, when something seemed bursting up in h=
erself and crying=20

passionately:  "I can't!"  But a little miracle happened. For Susette, who =
was only three years old=20

and understood nothing of all this, took half the purple asters from Amy's =
grave, and turning back=20

confidingly she put the rest in Ethel's hand--and then saw a sparrow and ch=
ased it, and laughed=20

merrily as it flew away.  At night when Joe came home, although he did not =
speak of the flowers,=20

she knew that he too had been at the grave. He appeared relieved, the tensi=
on gone. preventive=20
