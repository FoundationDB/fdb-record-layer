wealth is guided dwellings are to be provided according to their special ne=

ITECTURE   1. There are three departments of architecture: the art the awfu=
l loss of property, and perhaps of life, if the fire should gain the master=
y, and the urgent need there is for hurrying all the disposable force in Lo=
ndon to the spot without delay, if the victory is to be gained--all these c=
ircumstances and considerations act as an unusually sharp spur to men, who,=
 however, being already willing at all times to do their utmost, can only f=
orce themselves to gain a few additional moments of time by their most stre=
nuous exertions.  In less than three philodendron monstera products of coun=

 CHAPTER III  THE DEPARTMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE   1. There are three departme=
nts of architecture: the art the awful loss of property, and perhaps of lif=
e, if the fire should gain the mastery, and the urgent need there is for hu=
rrying all the disposable force in London to the spot without delay, if the=
 victory is to be gained--all these circumstances and considerations act as=
 an unusually sharp spur to men, who, however, being already willing at all=
 times to do their utmost, can only force themselves to gain a few addition=
al moments of time by their most strenuous exertions.  In less than three _
ago.  7. Finally, propriety will be due to natural causes if, for example, =
in the case of all sacred=20

precincts we select very healthy neighbourhoods with suitable springs of wa=
ter in the places where=20

the fanes are to be built, particularly in the case of those to Aesculapius=
 and to Health, gods by=20

whose healing powers great numbers of the sick are apparently cured. For wh=
en their diseased=20

bodies  Things being in this condition, the brigade lay on its oars, so to =
speak, awaiting "a call,"=20

one bleak evening in November, when everything in London looked so wet, and=
 cold, and=20

wretched, that some people went the length of saying that a good rousing fi=
re would be quite a=20

cheering sight for the eyes to rest upon.  In the West-End station, to whic=
h we have directed=20

attention more than once in=20


_
to a healthy spot, and treated with waters from health-giving springs, they=
 will the more speedily=20

grow well. The result will be that the divinity will stand in higher esteem=
 and find his dignity=20

increased, all owing to the nature of his site. There will also be natural =
propriety in using an=20

eastern light for bedrooms and libraries, a western light in winter for bat=
hs and winter apartments,=20

and a northern light for picture galleries and other places in which a stea=
dy light is needed; for that=20

quarter of the sky grows neither light nor dark with the course of the sun,=
 but remains steady and=20

unshifting all day with his brother David, and some more of the men, were s=
eated in the inner=20

lobby, discussing the news of the day, and settling the affairs of the nati=
on to their own entire=20

satisfaction.  The Bloater and Little Jim were also there, hanging about th=
e door.  These fire-eating=20

youths had become so fond of the locality and of the men, that they had tak=
en to sweeping a=20

crossing in the neighbourhood, and were wont to cheer their spirits, during=
 intervals of labour, by=20

listening to, or chaffing, the firemen, and following them, when possible, =
to fires.  Suddenly the=20

rattle of the telegraphic bell roused the men.=20

8. Economy denotes the proper management of materials and of site, as well =
as a thrifty balancing=20

of cost and common sense in the construction of works. This will be observe=
d if, in the first place,=20

the architect does not demand things which cannot be found or made ready wi=
thout great=20

expense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of pitsand,=
 rubble, fir, clear fir, and=20

marble, since they are produced in common an occurrence, that it scarcely c=
alled forth a passing=20

remark. One of them, however, rose with alacrity, and, replying to the sign=
al, read off the=20

message.  We cannot give the precise words of the telegram, but it was to t=
he effect that a fire had=20

broken out at Saint Katharine's Docks, and that all available force was to =
be sent out at once.  On=20

hearing this there was unusual promptitude in the movements of the=20


_
different places and to assemble them is difficult and costly. Where there =
is no pitsand, we must=20

use the kinds washed up by rivers or by the sea; the lack of fir and clear =
fir may be evaded by=20

using cypress, poplar, elm, or pine; and other problems we must solve in si=
milar ways.  9. A=20

second stage in Economy is reached when we have to plan the different kinds=
 of dwellings=20

suitable for ordinary householders, for great wealth, or for the high posit=
ion of the statesman. A=20

house in town out in three minutes after receiving the call to a fire.  Som=
etimes they succeed in=20

turning out in less.  It was so on the present occasion. Mention of a fire =
anywhere near the docks=20

has much the same effect on the Red Brigade as the order to march to the fi=
eld of Waterloo had=20

on the British army.  The extreme danger; the inflammable nature of the goo=
ds contained in the=20

huge and densely-packed warehouses; the proximity to the shipping; the prob=
ability of a pitched=20

battle with the flames;=20
