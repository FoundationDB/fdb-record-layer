dracaena marginata it's impossible! You must be mistaken after all.  MRS. A=

everything to me; and Alving could not deny it. So there was nothing to be =
done but to get the matter hushed up.  MANDERS. No, you could do nothing el=
se.  MRS. ALVING. The girl left our service at once, and got a good sum of =
money to hold her tongue for the time. The rest she rashness.[258] Lee reje=
cted the advice with a touch of irritation; and when Longstreet, acquiescin=
g, made a second suggestion--namely, for a tactical turning of the Federal =
left instead of a direct assault--Lee pronounced for the assault in a manne=
r so peremptory that Longstreet could say no more. From first to last at Ge=

MRS. ALVING. I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.  MANDERS.=
 No; heaven forbid!=20

But it is an unseemly state of things, nevertheless.  MRS. ALVING. It is on=

Oswald's part; you may be sure of that.  MANDERS. Well, as I say, I am not =
accustomed to affairs=20

of the kind. But I should certainly think--  MRS. ALVING. Out of the house =
she must go, and that=20

immediately. That is as clear as daylight--  MANDERS. Yes, of course she mu=

But where to? It would not be right to--  MANDERS. Where to? Home to her fa=

What happened here will presently be told.  Lee, too, was out of harmony wi=
