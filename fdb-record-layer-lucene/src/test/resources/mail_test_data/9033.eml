large fjords in Western Norway.     ACT FIRST.  [A spacious garden-room, wi=
th one door to the=20

left, and two doors to the right. In the middle of the room a round table, =
with chairs about it. On the=20

table lie books, periodicals, and newspapers. In the foreground to the left=
 a window, and by it a=20

small sofa, with a worktable in front of it. In the background, the room is=
 continued into a=20

somewhat narrower conservatory, the walls of which are formed by large pane=
s of glass. In the=20

right-hand wall of the conservatory is a door leading down into the garden.=
 Through the glass wall=20

a gloomy fjord landscape is faintly visible, veiled by steady rain.]  [ENGS=

 wood under the sole=20

of his boot. machinery was adjusted we followed her, and got near enough to=
 give her a parting=20

shot. But I was not familiar with the locality; there might be torpedoes pl=
anted in the channel, and I=20

did not wish to take any risk of losing our vessel, so I came back to the c=
ompany of our friends.=20

But except that we were, all of us, tired and hungry when we came back to t=
he _Minnesota_ at=20

half-past 12 P.M., the _Monitor_ was just as well prepared to fight as she =
was at eight o=E2=80=99clock in=20

the morning when she fired the first gun.=E2=80=9D  We were then shown the =
injury to the pilot-house. The=20

mark of the ball was plain upon the two upper bars, the principal impact be=
ing upon the lower of=20

the two. This huge bar was broken in the middle, but held firmly at either =
end. The farther it was=20

. You're positively=20

dripping.  ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.  REGINA. It's the =
devil's rain, _I_ say.=20

ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into th=
e room.] It's just=20

this as I wanted to say--  REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours=
, I tell you! The young=20

master's asleep was the resistance on the exterior. On the inside the fract=
ure in the bar was half=20

an inch wide. Captain Worden=E2=80=99s eye was very near to the lookout cra=
ck, so that when the gun was=20

discharged the shock of the ball knocked him senseless, while the mass of f=
lame filled one side of=20

his face with coarse grains of powder. He remained insensible for some hour=
s.  =E2=80=9CHave you heard=20

_
ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?  REGINA. It's no business of y=
ours.=20

ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--  REGINA. I can quite believe=
 that.=20

ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--  REGINA. So =
it seems.=20

ENGSTRAND.--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all th=
e same, I was hard=20

at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.  REGINA. Very well; onl=
y be off now. I won't=20

stop here and have _rendezvous's_ [Note: This and other French words by Reg=
ina are in that=20

language in the original] with you.  ENGSTRAND. What do you say you won't h=
ave?  REGINA. I=20

won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your business.  ENGS=

a step or two.] Blest if I go before I've had a talk with you. This afterno=

esident.  =E2=80=9CI think I have,=E2=80=9D=20

replied Mr. Lincoln, =E2=80=9Cbut it is worth relating to these gentlemen.=

Fox, =E2=80=9Cnot much of the history to which we have listened is new to m=

o=E2=80=99clock until mid-day. There was one marvel in it which has not bee=

handling of the _Monitor_ throughout the battle. The first bold advance of =
this diminutive vessel=20

against a giant like the _Merrimac_ was superlatively grand. She seemed ins=
