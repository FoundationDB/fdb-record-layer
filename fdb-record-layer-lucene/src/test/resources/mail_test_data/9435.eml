Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm Antin, who was brought from a Russian ghetto at the age of thirteen, gave us in _The Promised Land_ a most impressive interpretation of America's significance to the foreign-born.  The very title of her book was a flash of dracaena marginata copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm Antin, who was brought from a Russian ghetto at the age of thirteen, gave us in _The Promised Land_ a most impressive interpretation of America's significance to the foreign-born.  The very title of her book was a flash of _
of thieves and rogues. The thing could not have gone on a day longer."  "So we made plans--very 

nice plans," continued Mrs. Ellsworthy. "It never occurred to us that they would be knocked on the 

head, crushed, obliterated. Oh, I am very happy, of course, but I could cry at having my plans 

spoiled a second time."  "I don't think they are really spoiled," said Primrose who had grown very 

white, and now rose to her feet. "I know I was proud about accepting help. I had such a longing to 

be independent. Perhaps I feel sore about accepting help still, but I have made up my mind; for all 

our sakes it is best. I submit--I give in--I am very grateful."  "Perhaps, Primrose," said Mrs. 

Ellsworthy, whose bright eyes were now full of tears, "I may convince you yet that you have no 

cause to feel sore, and that proud heart of yours will not be pained. I believe the help you need is 

coming to you three sisters in such a guise that you cannot fail but to accept it gladly, and as your 

natural right."  "It cannot quite be our natural right," said Primrose. "There are no possible 

circumstances under which it can be quite natural for girls to take money help from even the 

kindest friends who are not related to them."  "In this case there may even possibly be a 

relationship," proceeded Mrs. Ellsworthy. "Primrose, suppose that little brother who was lost long 

ago--little Arthur your mother called him--suppose he came here to-day, and said, 'I am grown up, 

and rich--I am the right person to help my sisters,' you would feel no soreness of heart at 

accepting help from your own brother, Primrose?"  "My own brother," repeated Primrose in a 

wistful and longing voice; "it is cruel to remind me of my brother. He was lost many, many years 

ago; he has probably long been dead."  "I should be the happiest girl in all the world if I could find 

my brother," here interrupted Jasmine; "I often dream of him at night; he must have been a darling 

little boy."  "But if he were to come here twenty times," said Daisy, "I could never love him better 

than I love the Prince."  There was quite a little buzz of admiration through the room when Daisy 

made this innocent little speech, and all eyes were turned on Arthur Noel. Then there was a 

pause. Mr. Ellsworthy was again heard to clear his throat, and no one seemed quite to know what 

to do next. Suddenly Hannah Martin broke the spell--  "Goodness gracious me!" she said, "how 

long are the darling young ladies to be kept in suspense? Miss Primrose, why, you have got a 

brother, and there he stands. Mr. Arthur, come and kiss your sisters, my dear. Oh, my darling, 

darling girls, it's perfectly, perfectly true; he's the boy your mother broke her heart about long ago." 

The confusion and agitation which followed can scarcely be described--the joy of the sisters can 

scarcely be painted. Daisy took this wonderful and important discovery more coolly and calmly 

than the others.  "It doesn't make a bit of difference in my love to him," she said, "for I always 

loved him as if he were my brother."  "And now, Primrose," said Arthur, "you are mistress of this 

house, and please remember that visitors are coming here presently, and that you are to entertain 

them."  "Are we always to live with you, Arthur?" asked Jasmine. "It seems better than a dream. 

Oh, Arthur," she continued, not waiting for her brother's reply, "don't you remember how we made 

friends the very first moment we met? we must have always known, deep down in our hearts, that 

we were brother and sister."  "And this is to be our new Palace Beautiful," said Daisy, "and Poppy 

is to live here too. Oh, Primrose, do you not feel almost too happy?"  "I've given up my 

independence," said Primrose, "and yet I never felt more happy or more thankful."  The party that 

evening was a success. The astonishment of the good ladies from Penelope Mansion when they 

heard the wonderful news passed all bounds. Mrs. Dredge sat plump down on a chair, placed her 

fat hands on her lap, and fairly cried.  "Oh, if only my poor dear husband had lived to see this 



beautiful day," she said. "Young man, I have liked you from the first; you're the kind of young man 

whom my good husband would have rejoiced to be papa to."  Miss Slowcum sighed most deeply 

when she heard the news. "It's a touching romance," she said, "quite worthy of the olden times. I 

could imagine Mr. Noel--Mr. Mainwaring, I suppose we must call him now--as belonging to the old 

knights of chivalry. Yes, I am a person of discernment, and I long ago saw that the dear girls 

belonged to the upper ten."  "It's an ill wind that blows nobody good," said Mrs. Mortlock. "In this 

case, ladies and gentlemen, I beg to reverse the familiar words, for amid all your joy I have lost my 

'continual reader.' She had her faults--no, I'm not going to deny that being young she had her 

faults--but she was ever good-natured, and she did her gossip chirrupy."  Of course the girls' 

future was now assured, for Arthur was a very rich man. Miss Egerton, at his earnest request, 

came to live with them, and they are now known to possess one of the happiest and brightest 

homes in London--in short, they live in a "Palace Beautiful."      End of the Project Gutenberg

American literature has been enriched by certain autobiographies of men and women who had 

been born abroad, but who had been brought to this country, where they grew up as loyal citizens 

of our great nation.  Such assimilated Americans had to face not only the usual conditions 

confronting a stranger in a strange land, but had to develop within themselves the noble 

conception of Americanism that was later to become for them a flaming gospel.  Andrew Carnegie, 

the canny Scotch lad who began as a cotton weaver's assistant, became a steel magnate and an 

eminent constructive philanthropist.  Jacob Riis, the ambitious Dane, told in _The Making of an 

American_ the story of his rise to prominence as a social and civic worker in New York.
