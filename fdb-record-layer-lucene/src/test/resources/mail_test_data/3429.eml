y of dialects the rapid flux and change of unwritten speech; with his own C=
hristianity, which was that of Apostolic Britain; with his un-Teutonic gift=
s and _
belonging to Mr. Hall. Each time he was offered for sale, his master wanted=
 so much for him, and=20

refusing to sell him on time payments, he was always left on his master's h=
ands. His master said=20

"being tall, healthy and robust, he was well worth much money."  After slav=
ery, Charles was rated=20

as a good worker. He at once began working and saving his money and in a sh=
ort time he had=20

accumulated "around $200."  The first sight of a certain young woman caused=
 him to fall in love.=20

He says the love was mutual and after a courtship of three weeks they were =
married. The girl's=20

mother told Charles that she had always been very frail, but he did not kno=
w that she had=20

consumption. Within three days after they were married she died and her dea=
th caused much grief=20

for Charles.  He was reluctant to bury her and wanted to continue to stand =
and look at her face. A=20

white doctor and a school teacher whose names he does not remember, told hi=
m to put his wife's=20

body in alcohol to preserve it and he could look at it all the time. At tha=
t time white people who had=20

plenty of money and wanted to see the faces of their deceased used this met=
hod.  A glass casket=20

was used and the dressed body of the deceased was placed in alcohol inside =
the casket. Another=20

casket made of wood held the glass casket and the whole was placed in a vau=
lt made of stone or=20

brick. The walls of the vault were left about four feet above the ground an=
d a window and ledge=20

were placed in front, so when the casket was placed inside of the vault the=
 bereaved could lean=20

upon the ledge and look in at the face of the deceased. The wooden casket w=
as provided with a=20

glass top part of the way so that the face could easily be seen.  Although =
the process of preserving=20

the body in alcohol cost $160, Charles did not regret the expense saying, "=
I had plenty of money=20

at that time."  After the death of his wife, Charles left with his mother a=
nd father, Henrietta and=20

Spencer Coates and went to Savannah, Georgia. He said they were so glad to =
go, that they=20

walked to within 30 miles of Savannah, when they saw a man driving a horse =
and wagon who=20

picked them up and carried them into Savannah. It was in that city that he =
met his present wife,=20

Irene, and they were married about 1876.  There are nine grandchildren and =
eight great-

grandchildren living and in March of 1936, when a party was given in honor =
of Father Coates'=20

108th birthday, one of each of the four generations of his family were pres=
ent.  The party was=20

given at the Clara White Mission, 615 West Ashley Street by Ertha M.M. Whit=
e. Father Coates and=20

his wife were very much honored and each spoke encouraging words to those p=
resent. On the=20

occasion he said that the cause for his long life was due to living close t=
o nature, rising early,=20

going to bed early and not dissipating in any way.  He can "shout" (jumping=
 about a foot and a half=20

from the floor and knocking his heels together.) He does chores about his y=
ard; looks years=20

younger than he really is and enjoys good health. His hair is partly white;=
 his memory very good=20

and his chief delight is talking about God and his goodness. He has preache=
d the gospel in his=20

humble way for a number of years, thereby gaining the name of "Father" Coat=

lavery in the=20

United States, the southern white people found themselves without servants.=
 Women who were=20

accustomed to having a nurse, maid, cook and laundress found themselves wit=
hout sufficient=20

money to pay wages to all these. There was a great amount of work to be don=
e and the great=20

problem confronting married women who had not been taught to work and who t=
hought it beneath=20

their standing to soil their hands, found it very difficult.  There were on=
 the other hand many Negro=20



women who needed work and young girls who needed guidance and training.  Th=
e home and=20

guidance of the aristocratic white people offered the best opportunity for =
the dependent un-

schooled freed women; and it was in this kind of home that the ex-slave chi=
ld of this story was=20

reared.  Irene Coates of 2015 Windle Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was bor=
n in Georgia about=20

1859. She was close to six years of age when freedom was declared.  She was=
 one among the=20

many Negro children who had the advantage of living under the direct superv=
ision of kind whites=20

and receiving the care which could only be excelled by an educated mother. =
 Jimmie and Lou=20

Bedell were the present century, the geographical position of parties was r=
eversed; the swarming=20

cities of the North were then the great centres of Liberalism and the motiv=
e power of Reform; while=20

the South, having by this time fallen into the hands of great landed propri=
etors, was Conservative.=20

The stimulating effect of populous centres on opinion is a very familiar fa=
ct; even in the rural=20

districts it is noticed by canvassers at elections that men who work in gan=
gs are generally more=20

inclined to the Liberal side than those who work separately.  In England, h=
owever, the agricultural=20

element always has been and remains a full counterpoise to the manufacturin=
g and commercial=20

element. Agricultural England is not what Pericles called Attica, a mere su=
burban garden, the=20

embellishment of a queenly city. It is a substantive interest and a politic=
al power. In the time of=20

Charles I. it happened that, owing to the great quantity of land thrown int=
o the market in=20

consequence of the confiscation of the monastic estates, which had slipped =
through the fingers of=20

the spendthrift courtiers to whom they were at first granted, small freehol=
ders were very numerous=20

in the South, and these men like the middle class in the towns, being stron=
g Protestants, went with=20

the Parliament against the Laudian reaction in religion. But land in the ha=
nds of great proprietors is=20

Conservative, especially when it is held under entails and connected with h=
ereditary nobility; and=20

into the hands of great proprietors the land of England has now entirely pa=
ssed. The last remnant=20

of the old yeomen freeholders departed in the Cumberland Statesmen, and the=
 yeoman freeholder=20

in England is now about as rare as the other. Commerce has itself assisted =
the process by giving=20

birth to great fortunes, the owners of which are led by social ambition to =
buy landed estates,=20

because to land the odour of feudal superiority still clings, and it is alm=
ost the necessary=20

qualification for a title. The land has also actually absorbed a large port=
ion of the wealth produced=20

by manufactures, and by the general development of industry; the estates of=
 Northern landowners=20

especially have enormously increased in value, through the increase of popu=
lation, not to mention=20

the not inconsiderable appropriation of commercial wealth by marriage. Thus=
 the Conservative=20

element retains its predominance, and it even seems as though the land of M=
ilton, Vane,=20

Cromwell, and the Reformers of 1832, might after all become, politically as=
 well as territorially, the=20

domain of a vast aristocracy of landowners, and the most reactionary instea=
d of the most=20

progressive country in Europe.  Before the repeal of the Corn Laws there wa=
s a strong antagonism=20

of interest between the landowning aristocracy and the manufacturers of the=
 North, but that=20

antagonism is now at an end; the sympathy of wealth has taken its place; th=
e old aristocracy has=20

veiled its social pride and learned to conciliate the new men, who on their=
 part are more than=20

willing to enter the privileged circle. This junction is at present the gre=
at fact of English politics, and=20

was the main cause of the overthrow of the Liberal Government in 1874. The =
growth of the great=20

cities itself seems likely, as the number of poor householders increases, t=
o furnish Reaction with=20

auxiliaries in the shape of political Lazzaroni capable of being organized =
by wealth in opposition to=20



the higher order of workmen and the middle class. In Harrington's "Oceana,"=
 there is much=20

nonsense, but it rises at least to the level of Montesquieu in tracing the =
intimate connection of=20

political power, even under elective institutions, with wealth in land.  Hi=
therto, the result of the=20

balance between the landowning and commercial elements has been steadiness =
of political=20

progress, in contrast on the one hand to the commercial republics of Italy,=
 whose political progress=20

was precocious and rapid but shortlived, and on the other hand to great feu=
dal kingdoms where=20

commerce was comparatively weak. England, as yet, has taken but few steps b=
ackwards. It=20

remains to be seen what the future may bring under the changed conditions w=
hich we have just=20

described. English commerce, moreover, may have passed its acme. Her insula=
r position gave=20

Great Britain during the Napoleonic wars, with immunity from invasion, a mo=
nopoly of=20

manufactures and of the carrying trade. This element of her commercial supr=
emacy is transitory,=20

though others, such as the possession of coal, are not.  Let us now conside=
r the effects of the=20

division between the two islands and of those between different parts of th=
e larger island. The=20

most obvious effect of these is tardy=20


_
need of having a Negro girl come into their home as one in the family and a=
t the same time be=20

assured of a good and efficient servant in years to come.  When Irene was o=
ld enough, she=20

became the nurse of the Bedell baby and when the family left Savannah, Geor=
gia to come to=20

Jacksonville, they brought Irene with them.  Although Irene was just about =
six years old when the=20

Civil War ended, she has vivid recollection of happenings during slavery. S=
ome of the incidents=20

which happened were told her by her slave associates after slavery ended an=
d some of them she=20

remembers herself.  Two incidents which she considers by the absence of a c=
ollective name for=20

the people of the three kingdoms. The writer was once rebuked by a Scotchma=
n for saying=20

"England" and "English," instead of saying "Great Britain" and "British." H=
e replied that the rebuke=20

was just, but that we must say "British and Irish." The Scot had overlooked=
 his poor connections.=20

We always speak of Anglo-Saxons and identify the extension of the Colonial =
Empire with that of=20

the Anglo-Saxon race. But even if we assume that the Celts of England and o=
f the Scotch=20

Lowlands were exterminated by the Saxons, taking all the elements of Celtic=
 population in the two=20

islands=20


_
masters and finally the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln she tells in this o=
rder.  The first event=20

tells of a young, strong healthy Negro woman who knew her work and did it w=
ell. "She would grab=20

up two bags of guana (fertilizer) and tote 'em at one time," said Irene, an=
d was never found=20

shirking her work. The overseer on the plantation, was very hard on the sla=
ves and practiced=20

striking them across the back with a whip when he wanted to spur them on to=
 do more work.  Irene=20

says, one day a crowd of women were hoeing in the field and Teutonic elemen=
t. That large Irish=20

settlements are being formed in the cities of Northern England is proved by=
 election addresses=20

coquetting with Home Rule. In the competition of the races on the American =
Continent the Irish=20

more than holds its own. In the age of the steam- engine the Scotch Highlan=
ds, the mountains of=20

Cumberland and Westmoreland, of Wales, of Devonshire, and Cornwall, are the=
 asylum of natural=20

beauty, of poetry and hearts which seek repose from the din and turmoil of =
commercial life. In the=20

primaeval age of=20
