We learn farther on in the same work that it is these Angels and their host=
s who are referred to in=20

the sentence of verse I, chapter ii, of _Genesis_: "Igitur perfecti sunt co=
eli et terra et omnis ornatus=20

eorum:" and that the Vulgate has peremptorily substituted for the Hebrew wo=
rd "tsaba" ("host")=20

that of "ornament;" Munck shows the mistake of substitution and the derivat=
ion of the compound=20

title, "Tsabaoth-Elohim," from "tsaba." Moreover, Cornelius a Lapide, "the =
master of all Biblical=20

commentators," says de Mirville, shows us that such was the real meaning. T=
hose Angels are=20

stars.  All this, however, teaches us very little as to the thou hast no co=
nfidence in me! so much=20

the worse for thee, for harm may come of it!"  Meanwhile the cardinal was r=
ubbing his hands in=20

great satisfaction.  "A hundred pistoles! a hundred pistoles! for a hundred=
 pistoles I have=20

discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand cro=
wns; without=20

reckoning the value of that diamond"--he cast a complacent look at the ring=
, which he had kept,=20

instead of restoring to D'Artagnan--"which is worth, at least, ten thousand=
 francs."  He returned to=20

his room, and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants =
of every sort, for the cardinal=20

was a connoisseur in precious=20


_
celestial army, and nothing at all as to its place in evolution and its rel=
ation to the earth we live on.=20

For an answer to the question, "Who are the true Creators?" we must go to t=
he Esoteric Doctrine,=20

since there only can the key be found which will render intelligible the Th=
eogonies of the various=20

world-religions.  There we find that the real creator of the Kosmos, as of =
all visible Nature--if not of=20

all the invisible hosts of Spirits not yet drawn into the "Cycle of Necessi=
ty," or evolution--is "the=20

Lord--the Gods," or the "Working Host," the "Army" collectively taken, the =
"One in many."  The=20

One is infinite and unconditioned. It cannot create, for It can have no rel=
ation to the finite and=20

conditioned. If everything we see, from the glorious suns and planets down =
to the blades of grass=20

and the the noises of gun-fire that, though it was now near midnight, conti=
nued to resound through=20

Paris.  In the meantime D'Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne, =
where he lived at the=20

Hotel de la Chevrette.  We will explain in a few words how D'Artagnan had b=
een led to choose that=20

place of residence.     6. D'Artagnan in his Fortieth Year.   Years have el=
apsed, many events have=20

happened, alas! since, in our romance of "The Three Musketeers," we took le=
ave of D'Artagnan at=20

No. 12 Rue des Fossoyeurs. D'Artagnan had not failed in his career, but cir=
cumstances had been=20

adverse to him. So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his=
 youth and the poetry=20

of his character. He was one of those fine, ingenuous natures which assimil=
ate themselves easily=20

to the dispositions of others. Athos=20


_
dust, had been created by the Absolute Perfection and were the direct work =
of even the _First_=20

Energy that proceeded from It,(389) then every such thing would have been p=
erfect, eternal, and=20

unconditioned, like its author. The millions upon millions of imperfect wor=
ks found in Nature testify=20

loudly that they are the products of finite, conditioned beings--though the=
 latter were and are=20

Dhyan Chohans, Archangels, or what ever else they may be named. In short, t=
hese imperfect=20

works are the unfinished production of evolution, under the guidance of the=
 imperfect Gods. The=20

_Zohar_ gives us this assurance as well as the Secret Doctrine. It speaks o=
f the auxiliaries of the=20

"Ancient of Days," the "Sacred Aged," and calls them Auphanim, or the livin=
g Wheels of the=20

celestial orbs, who participate in the work of the creation of the Universe=
.  Thus it is not the=20

"Principle," One and Unconditioned, nor even Its reflection, that creates, =
but only the "Seven=20

Gods" who fashion the Universe out of the eternal Matter, vivified into obj=
ective life by the=20

reflection into it of the One Reality.  The Creator is they--"God the Host"=
--called in the Secret=20

Doctrine the Dhyan Chohans; with the Hindus the Prajapatis; with the Wester=
n Kabalists the=20

Sephiroth; and with the Buddhist the Devas--impersonal because blind forces=
. They are the=20

Amshaspends with the Zoroastrians, and while with the Christian Mystic the =
"Creator" is the "Gods=20

of the God," with the dogmatic Churchman he is the "God of the Gods," the "=
Lord of lords," etc.=20

"Jehovah" is only the God who is greater than all Gods in the eyes of Israe=
l.       I know, that the=20

Lord [of Israel] is great and that our Lord is     above all gods.(390)   A=
nd again:       For all the=20

gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the     greatness of soul,=
 Porthos his enthusiasm,=20

Aramis his elegance. Had D'Artagnan continued his intimacy with these three=
 men he would have=20

become a superior character. Athos was the first to leave him, in order tha=
t he might retire to a=20

little property he had inherited near Blois; Porthos, the second, to marry =
an attorney's wife; and=20

lastly, Aramis, the third, to take orders and become an abbe. From that day=
 D'Artagnan felt lonely=20

and powerless, without courage to pursue a career in which he could only di=
stinguish himself on=20

condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of th=
e gifts each had=20

received from Heaven.  Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers, D'=
Artagnan felt=20

completely solitary. For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonanc=
ieux left on his=20

character a certain poetic tinge, perishable indeed; for like all other rec=
ollections in this world,=20

these impressions were, by degrees, effaced. A garrison life is fatal even =
to the most aristocratic=20

organization; and imperceptibly, D'Artagnan, always in the camp, always on =
horseback, always in=20

garrison, became (I know not how in the present age one would express it) a=
 typical trooper. His=20

early refinement of character was not only not lost, it grew even greater t=
han ever; but it was now=20

applied to the little, instead of to the great things of life--to the marti=
al condition of the soldier--

comprised under the head of a good lodging, a rich table, a congenial hoste=
ss. These important=20

advantages D'Artagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the s=
ign of the Roe.  From=20

the time D'Artagnan took quarters in that hotel, the mistress of the house,=
 a pretty and fresh=20

looking Flemish woman, twenty-five or twenty-six years old, had been singul=
arly interested in him;=20

and=20


_
The Egyptian Neteroo, translated by Champollion "_the other Gods_" are the =
Elohim of the Biblical=20

writers, behind which stands concealed the One God, considered in the diver=
sity of his=20

powers.(392) This One is not Parabrahman, but the Unmanifested Logos, the D=
emiurgos, the real=20

Creator or Fashioner, that follows him, standing for the Demiurgi collectiv=
ely taken. Further on the=20

great Egyptologist adds:       We see Egypt concealing and hiding, so to sa=
y, _the_ God of Gods=20

behind the _agents_ she surrounds him with; she gives the     precedence to=
 her certain love=20

passages, much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times =
D'Artagnan had=20

made a pretence of passing a sword through his body, that husband had disap=
peared one fine=20

morning, after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine, carrying away=
 with him money and=20

jewels. He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who cherished the =
pleasing idea that she=20

was a widow, stoutly maintained that death had taken him. Therefore, after =
the connection had=20

continued three years, carefully fostered by D'Artagnan, who found his bed =
and=20


_
that the attributes of that God become their property. Those great     Gods=
 proclaim themselves=20

uncreate.... Neith is "_that which is_,"     as Jehovah;(393) Thoth is self=
-created(394) without=20

having been     begotten, etc. Judaism annihilating these potencies before =
the     grandeur of its=20

God, they cease to be simply Powers, like Philo's     Archangels, like the =
Sephiroth of the=20

_Kabalah_, like the Ogdoades     of the Gnostics--they merge together and b=
ecome transformed=20

into     God himself.(395)   Jehovah is thus, as the _Kabalah_ teaches, at =
best but the "Heavenly=20

Man," Adam Kadmon, used by the self-created Spirit, the Logos, as a chariot=
, a vehicle in His=20

descent mistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other,=
 the mistress=20

conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to D'Art=
agnan that he should=20

marry her.  "Ah, fie!" D'Artagnan replied. "Bigamy, my dear! Come now, you =
don't really wish it?"=20

"But he is dead; I am sure of it."  "He was a very contrary fellow and migh=
t come back on purpose=20

to have us hanged."  "All right; if he comes back you will kill him, you ar=
e so skillful and so brave."=20

"Peste! my darling! another way of getting hanged."  "So you refuse my requ=
est?"  "To be sure I=20

do--furiously!"  The pretty landlady was desolate. She would have taken D'A=
rtagnan not only as=20

her husband,=20
