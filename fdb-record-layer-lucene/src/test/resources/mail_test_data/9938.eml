"There!" he murmured. "No, now!" And then again, "Now! There he is! I'll cl=
imb up to give it to him=20

in the tail, then I'll bank sharply right. Perhaps you'll get a whack at hi=
m, sir."  He lost the big flying=20

boat once more, then, suddenly, there they were, right upon the enemy.  Onc=
e again his twin guns=20

roared. He banked sharply to catch the rattle of the Commander's gun.  He c=
aught something=20

more. From behind came the rattle of a Zero's weapon.  "Another fighter!" h=
e groaned.  Putting his=20

plane into a steep dive, Jack dropped a thousand feet--then swinging, start=
ed to climb.  "What=20

luck! You're just beneath him!" exclaimed the Commander. "Climb right on up=
 and give me a=20

whack at him as we pass."  It would be a difficult shot. There was the dang=
er too that the Zero pilot=20

had a pal. But up they flew. And at just the right moment the Commander pou=
red murderous fire=20

into the enemy, who, for three seconds, had no chance of escape.  It was en=
ough. He=20

disappeared from sight, and to Jack's nostrils came the stench of burning o=
il.  "You got him!" Jack=20

breathed. "But the snooper?"  "There's a bright spot over to the left," sai=
d the Commander. "Might=20

be a burning motor."  It was a burning motor of the big Jap ship. It burned=
 more and more until the=20

whole plane burst into flames and white parachutes bloomed against the nigh=
t sky.  "I think," said=20

the Commander, "that we should start back. There's such a thing as going to=
o far in this matter of=20

testing out a plane's cruising capacity."  "As you say, sir." Jack spoke ca=
lmly, but inside he was all=20

pure joy. His jet plane had proved its worth.                              =
    CHAPTER XXVII=20

STRATOSPHERE TACTICS   "Do I fly this jet plane in the big show, sir?" Jack=
 asked as he and=20

the Commander stepped down on the _Black Bee's_ deck half an hour later.  "=
Not only that," was=20

the instant response, "but you'll lead the parade.  "And now," the Commande=
r ordered, "hit the=20

hay!"  Jack was too excited over past and future events to sleep long that =
night. He awoke with the=20

dawn to find the sea blanketed in fog.  "Just what the doctor ordered," he =
said to Stew. "We'll be=20

able to get through the day unobserved by the enemy. And tomorrow, unless I=
 miss my guess, we=20

strike at dawn."  With coffee, hot cakes, and bacon stowed away, Jack made =
his way to the flight=20

deck. There he obtained permission to take his jet plane below for study, i=
nspection, and if need=20

be, repairs.  He had plenty of help with this task. There wasn't a flier or=
 mechanic on the _Black=20

Bee_ who would not gladly have taken the jet plane apart piece by piece jus=
t to see what made it=20

go.  The best mechanics on the carrier were assigned to the task of going o=
ver the plane. With an=20

eagle eye Jack watched their every move. He made sure that the oxygen equip=
ment was in=20

perfect order and the tubes filled to capacity.  "You're flying with me," h=
e said to Stew. "We're to be=20

the first scouts over the target. Those are the Commander's orders. And we'=
ll go there in the=20

stratosphere, fastest trip you ever made, if our jet plane holds together."=
  "That's Jake with me,"=20

Stew grinned.  That was a busy day on the _Black Bee_. Every plane was insp=
ected and given=20

minor repairs. Fliers were given last day-before-the-battle instructions. A=
nti-aircraft crews went=20

through dress rehearsals. Every man on the ship was on his toes and ready t=
o go. No night before=20

was ever like this.  That evening Jack hunted up Mary, who had not make thi=
s distinction. In=20

English the word throttling is probably oftener applied to strangulation by=
 the hand than by cords.=20

The term =3Dsuffocation=3D is also applied in a _special_ sense to the act =
and result of pressure on=20

the mouth, nose, or chest and abdomen, stopping the breathing; or of obstru=
ction within the=20

respiratory tract; or of pressure upon the tract from the =C5=93sophagus, e=
tc.; or of breathing of=20

irrespirable gases.  Strangulation is almost always homicidal, hanging almo=
st always suicidal, and=20

suffocation (limited) usually accidental, but also often homicidal.  Strang=
ulation may be admitted,=20



therefore, as including all cases of suffocation by pressure on the neck, w=
hether by cords or the=20

hand; but excluding hanging.  It will facilitate the study of the subject i=
f we use the word ligature as=20

a general term to cover the many forms of cords, ropes, etc., used in stran=
gulation and hanging.=20

The word GARROTING is often used to indicate the forcible compression of th=
e neck by the hands=20

of thieves. The assault is usually made from behind, and the victim is robb=
ed while the throttling=20

proceeds. The brevity of the process explains why death is not more frequen=
t. The word garroting=20

comes from the Spanish; criminal execution in Spain and Italy is usually by=
 means of the=20

GARROTE, a steel collar which is tightened on the neck of the condemned by =
a screw. The=20

notorious thugs of the East Indies used sometimes a soft loin-cloth, at oth=
ers a lasso or long thong=20

with a running noose. In Turkey and some other Eastern countries the bowstr=
ing is a common=20

mode of execution.  An examination of the reported cases of strangulation a=
nd hanging shows a=20

great variety of forms of ligature: cords, ropes, thread, thongs, lassos, f=
lexible twigs, bamboos,=20

leather straps, girdles, turbans, fishing-nets, collars, cravats and other =
forms of neckwear, bonnet=20

strings, handkerchiefs, sheets, etc. Women have even strangled themselves w=
ith their own hair=20

(Case 34). Stones, sticks, coal, and other hard substances have sometimes b=
een inserted in the=20

ligature to increase the pressure (Cases 36, 38, 42, 43, 44). Drunken and o=
therwise helpless=20

persons have been strangled by falling forward with the neck against a firm=
 substance.=20

STRANGULATION.   SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT.  The symptoms and post-mortem=20

appearances in strangulation will vary, according as the deprivation of air=
 is sudden or gradual,=20

partial or complete; and whether there is coincident pressure on the great =
arteries, veins, and=20

nerves of the neck.  The deprivation of air disposes to asphyxia; pressure =
on the great arteries by=20

cutting off the supply of arterial blood to the brain disposes to an=C3=A6m=
ia of the brain and syncope;=20

pressure on the great veins, by preventing the return of blood to the heart=
, to congestion of the=20

brain and coma; pressure on the great nerves, the pneumogastrics, to syncop=
e. Statistics of=20

hanging show that in about seventy per cent of cases death is by a mixture =
of asphyxia and coma.=20

While it is probable that the proportion is less in strangulation, yet it i=
s also probable that a mixed=20

result frequently occurs.  Asphyxia is from __ priv. and __, pulse=E2=80=94=

llowing distinction=20

between asphyxia and apn=C5=93a: Asphyxia is difficulty of taking in breath=

the flight deck, tuned up his=20

violin, and then walked slowly back and forth playing all the melodies he k=
new--while with every=20

tune memories of other days came back.  Then he locked the violin safely in=
 its case and=20

wandered up for one more look at the jet plane before retiring for the nigh=
t.  "Tomorrow," he=20

whispered.  Jack and Stew were up two hours before dawn. The hour that prec=
eded dawn was=20

their zero hour.  As they came down for their coffee they were surprised to=
 find Ted and Mary=20

waiting for them.  "We thought we'd like to be with you at the last meal be=
fore the big moment,"=20

said Mary.  "That's sure swell of you," said Jack.  "You'd want to do that =

in apn=C5=93a the blood cannot reach the air.  Quinquaud[730] and Fredericq=

of carbon dioxide.  Page[732] divides the phenomena witnessed in an animal =
