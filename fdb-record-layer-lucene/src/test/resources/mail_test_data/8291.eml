philodendron monstera 9), "Let the wickedness of the wicked _come to an end=

"fled from Saul in the cave." This may, of course, apply to either Adullam =
or Engedi, and there is=20

nothing decisive to be alleged for either; yet one or two resemblances to p=
salm vii. incline the=20

balance to the latter period.  These resemblances are the designation of hi=
s enemies as lions (vii.=20

2; lvii. 4); the image of their falling into their own trap (vii. 15; lvii.=
 6); the use of the phrase "my=20

honour" or "glory" for "my soul" (vii. 5; lvii. 8--the same word in the ori=
ginal); the name of God as=20

"Most High" (vii. 17; lvii. 2), an expression which only occurs twice besid=
es in the Davidic psalms=20

(ix. 2; xxi. 7); the parallelism in sense between the petition which forms =
the centre and the close of=20

accompanied by intuitive living faith, which I have just endeavoured to des=
cribe. There is a=20

promise that 'greater works than these shall they do' who 'believe.' Why, I=
 want to know, have=20

these 'works,' greater than any that were then accomplished, and which woul=
d reform the world,=20

never been attempted? Because people don't believe in the tremendous power =
of=20

disinterestedness, and they can't face the severe training which the perfec=
tion of self-sacrifice=20

involves. So one set of 'worldly-holies' regard all personal discipline as =
a tempting snare to be=20

avoided, and entertain a great horror of what they conceitedly term 'their =
own merits.' This very=20

superfluous sentiment, combined with a selfish=20


_
exalted, O God, above the heavens" (lvii. 5, 11), and that which is the mos=
t emphatic desire of the=20

other, "Arise, O Lord, awake, ... lift up Thyself for me" (vii. 6). Another=
 correspondence, not=20

preserved in our English version, is the employment in both of a rare poeti=
cal word, which=20

originally means "to complete," and so comes naturally to have the secondar=
y significations of "to=20

perfect" and "to put an end to." The word in question only occurs five time=
s in the Old Testament,=20

and always in psalms. Four of these are in hymns ascribed to David, of whic=
h two are (lvii. 2),=20

"The God that in certain doctrinals (of which they usually do make a merit)=
, is enough, they=20

imagine--the 'works' will follow; and so they do, and take the form we have=
 just seen in your=20

mother's drawing-room. Another set delight in a mild aesthetic sort of trai=
ning, to be performed in a=20

particular costume, according to the obsolete ceremonial rules of a Church =
'which is divided=20

against itself,' and their works take the fatuous form of ecclesiastical hi=
gh art. Others, again, go to=20

a still further extreme, and consider discipline not the means but the end.=
 Hence they go through=20

their drill in seclusion,=20
