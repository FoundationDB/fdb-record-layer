"Eh, sir!" replied the sergeant, "their vehicle has broken down a second _
associated with Colours and Sounds, and form collectively the Manifested Lo=
gos.  In the eternal=20

music of the spheres we find the perfect scale corresponding to the colours=
, and in the number,=20

determined by the vibrations of colour and sound, which "underlies every fo=
rm friend. Come on,=20

here, you others," he continued, rising in his stirrups, raising his sword,=
 and addressing those=20

musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught. "Come, swee=
p away all that for=20

me! Shoulder muskets! Present arms! Aim----"  At this command=20


_

lustrate these=20

correspondences by showing the relation of colour and sound to the geometri=
cal figures=20

which(814) express the progressive stages in the manifestation of Kosmos.  =
But the student will=20

certainly be liable to confusion if, in studying the Diagrams, he does not =
remember two things: (1)=20

That, our plane being a plane of reflection, and therefore illusionary, _th=
e various notations are=20

reversed and must be counted from below upwards_. The musical scale begins =
from below=20

upwards, commencing with the deep Do and ending with the far more acute Si.=
 (2) That Kama=20

Rupa (corresponding to Do in the musical scale), containing as it does all =
potentialities of Matter,=20

is necessarily the starting-point on our plane. Further, it commences the n=
otation on every plane,=20

as corresponding to the "matter" of that plane. Again, the student must als=
o remember that these=20

notes have to be arranged in a circle, thus showing how Fa is the middle no=
te of Nature. In short,=20

musical notes, or Sounds, Colours and Numbers proceed from one to seven, an=
d not from seven=20

to one as erroneously shown in the spectrum of the prismatic colours, in wh=
ich Red is counted=20

first: a fact which necessitated my putting the principles and the days of =
the week at random in=20

Diagram II. The musical scale and colours, according to the number of vibra=
tions, proceed from=20

asked to dismiss from his mind any correspondence between "principles" and =
numbers, for=20

reasons already given. The Esoteric enumeration cannot be made to D'Artagna=
n could not repress=20

a burst of Homeric laughter.  "Thank you, D'Artagnan," said Comminges, show=
ing half of his body=20

through the window of the broken vehicle, "thanks, my young friend; your na=
me--that I may=20

mention it to the queen."  Raoul was about to reply when D'Artagnan bent do=
wn to his ear.  "Hold=20

your tongue," said he, "and let me answer. Do not lose time, Comminges," he=
 continued; "get out=20

of the carriage if you can and make another draw up; be quick, or in five m=
inutes the mob will be=20

on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed. Hold! there's a=
 carriage coming over=20

yonder."  Then bending again to Raoul, he whispered: "Above all things do n=
ot divulge your=20

name."  "That's right. I will go," said Comminges; "and if they come back, =
fire!"  "Not at all--not at=20

all," replied D'Artagnan; "let no one move. On the contrary, one shot at th=
is moment would be paid=20

for dearly to-morrow."  Comminges took his four guards and as many musketee=
rs and ran to the=20

carriage, from which he made the people inside dismount, and brought them t=
o the vehicle which=20

had upset. But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carria=
ge to the other, the=20

people, catching sight of him whom they called their liberator, uttered eve=
ry imaginable cry and=20

knotted themselves once more around the vehicle.  "Start, start!" said D'Ar=
tagnan. "There are ten=20

men to accompany you. I will keep twenty to hold in check the mob; go, and =
lose not a moment.=20

Ten men for Monsieur de Comminges."  As the carriage started off the cries =
were redoubled and=20



more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neu=
f and adjacent=20

streets. A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded.  "Forward!" =
cried D'Artagnan,=20

driven to extremities, biting his moustache; and then he charged with his t=
wenty men and=20

dispersed them in fear. One man alone remained in his place, gun in hand.  =
"Ah!" he exclaimed, "it=20

is thou who wouldst have him assassinated? Wait an instant." And he pointed=
 his gun at=20

D'Artagnan, who was riding toward him at full speed. D'Artagnan bent down t=
o his horse's neck,=20

the young man fired, and the ball severed the feathers from the hat. The ho=
rse started, brushed=20

against the imprudent man, who thought by his strength alone to stay the te=
mpest, and he fell=20

against the wall. D'Artagnan pulled up his horse, and whilst his musketeers=
 continued to charge,=20

he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down.  "O=
h, sir!" exclaimed=20

Raoul, recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix, "s=
pare him! it is his=20

son!"  D'Artagnan's arm dropped to his side. "Ah, you are his son!" he said=
; "that is a different=20

thing."  "Sir, I surrender," said Louvieres,=20


_
conventional exoteric. The one is the reality, the other is classified acco=
rding to illusive=20

appearances. The human principles, as given in _Esoteric Buddhism_, were ta=
bulated for=20

beginners, so as not to confuse their minds. It was half a blind.    Colour=

proceed:                            [Illustration: Square]  The Point in th=
e Circle is the Unmanifested Logos,=20

corresponding to Absolute Life and Absolute Sound.  The first geometrical f=
igure after the the=20

officer.  "Eh, no! do not surrender, egad! On the contrary, be off, and qui=
ckly. If I take you, you will=20

be hung!"  The young man did not wait to be told twice, but passing under t=
he horse's head=20

disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud.  "I'faith!" said D'Artagnan=
 to Raoul, "you were=20

just in time to stay my hand. He was a dead man; and on my honor, if I had =
discovered that it was=20

his son, I should have regretted having killed him."  "Ah! sir!" said Raoul=
, "allow me, after=20


_

 Triangle represents=20

the Second Logos, "Father-Mother," or the White Ray which is no colour, sin=
ce it contains=20

potentially all colours. It is shown radiating from the Unmanifested Logos,=
 or the Unspoken fellow's=20

life, to thank you on my own account. I too, sir, was almost dead when you =
arrived."  "Wait, wait,=20

young man; do not fatigue yourself with speaking. We can talk of it afterwa=
rd."  Then seeing that=20

the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai=20
