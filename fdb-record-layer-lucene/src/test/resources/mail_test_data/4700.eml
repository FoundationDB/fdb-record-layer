a kick from behind the goal line by Neil Durant,--the longest punt that had=

restore Gmelin's name _punctata_, which will afford an opportunity to do ju=
stice to the memory of Laurenti, by reviving the original name by which he =
_
his head. The stratagem worked; the punt that Neil Durant sent away quickly=
 sailed over the=20

quarter-back's head and rolled down the field to the Jefferson five-yard li=
ne. The quarter ran after=20

it, made a quick scoop, and attempted to come back but was stopped before h=
e had taken half a=20

dozen steps.  Fighting hard, the Ridgley team prevented the visitors from a=
dvancing and forced=20

them to kick from their own goal line. Neil Durant caught the punt at mid-f=
ield and dashed forward=20

ten yards before he was checked. The moment seemed ripe for a strong Ridgle=
y advance, but=20

Norris and his men met the attack with a stiff resistance and threw back th=
e first two attempts for a=20

loss of three yards. Dean, in glancing over the enemy's line, then saw the =
opportunity for which he=20

had been waiting; the time had arrived to try the surprise play. He gave a =
signal which brought a=20

thrill to Teeny-bits.  In the two forward-pass formations that the Ridgley =
team had used earlier in=20

the game Neil Durant both times had been the man to receive the ball from D=
ean. The members of=20

the team now took somewhat obvious positions and the Jefferson eleven immed=
iately assumed=20

that a forward pass was being contemplated. One of the tackles even voiced =
his warning: "Look=20

out for a pass!" and Norris shifted his position slightly to keep an eye on=
 the Ridgley captain.=20

Teeny-bits' duty was to dash through to the left and to get into the open s=
pace beyond the=20

Jefferson line.  The preliminaries of the play worked to perfection. At the=
 snap of the ball Neil=20

Durant started swiftly to the right and drew after him the major part of th=
e Jefferson secondary=20

defense. For the moment Teeny-bits seemed to have been forgotten: it did no=
t occur to the purple=20

players that, with the big captain running swiftly into position to take th=
e pass, his smaller back-

field team-mate would be the one to receive the oval.  As Dean seemed to be=
 in the act of hurling=20

to his captain, Teeny-bits won through to an open space; suddenly the quart=
er-back shifted and=20

shot the ball, bullet-straight, into the hands of the half-back. Teeny-bits=
 was running toward the=20

Jefferson goal almost before he felt the hard leather touch his fingers; no=
w or never was the=20

instant to use every atom of his body in the one purpose of reaching the go=
al posts that were=20

straight in front of him,--so near and yet so far away.  The whole Jefferso=
n team realized in that=20

fraction of a second when they saw the ball sail into the half-back's arms =
that their advantage,=20

their prestige  _Coluber heterodon._ This viperine species, of which Latrei=
lle has formed a genus=20

under the name of _Heterodon_, varies considerably in its markings, and lik=
e most of our=20

serpents, is not constant in the number of its plates and scales, (126, 48-=
138, 42-141, 42, &c.)=20

perhaps too much reliance has been placed upon colour, and upon the number =
of the plates and=20

scales beneath the body, of the Ophidi=C3=A6 generally. In the form of the =
anterior termination of the=20

head, the _heterodon_ is remarkable, and a good specific character may be o=
btained from the=20

orbital scales, which are eleven or twelve in number; the parabolic curve w=
hich passes through the=20

eyes, and terminates at the maxillary angles, is also generally present. Th=
is same serpent was=20

figured in Deterville's ed. of Buffon, under the name of _Coleuvre cannelee=
_. The _heterodon_=20

abounds in many sandy situations, and near the sea-shore. Several persons p=
ursuing a pathway,=20

passed within a few inches of one of them without his betraying any emotion=
, but the moment he=20

perceived me advancing with my eye fixed upon him, he with a sudden exertio=
n assumed a=20

defensive attitude, by elevating the anterior portion of his body, flatteni=
ng his head, and 3 or 4=20

inches length of his neck; these he waved with a steady and oblique motion =
from side to side,=20

uttering at the same time an audible sibilation, he made no attempt to esca=
pe, and seemed=20

absolutely fearless until taken. They have the habit of the vipera, but not=
 the fangs. It seems to be=20



synonymous with _Coluber simus_. This species is often called _mockeson_. D=
r. Shaw's=20

description of _Boa contortrix_ seems to indicate this species. Was he dece=
ived by an erroneous=20

reference to Catesby's figure of this Hog-nose? or by Forster's catalogue? =
 _Coluber punctatus._=20

A good diagnostic character of this species, in addition to the cervical ce=
stus, rests in the triple=20

series of abdominal dots; but these are often wanting or obsolete in the yo=
ung specimen, in which=20

state it is probably the _torquatus_ of Shaw. Sometimes the dots are wantin=
g on the neck and=20

near the cloaca; and in one aged individual, the intermediate line occurred=
 double, and confluent=20

on the throat.  _Coluber fulvius_, this species is said by Daudin to be clo=
sely allied to his _C.=20

coccineus_, notwithstanding the difference in plates and scales. But it is =
certainly very distinct by=20

other characters, and strikingly so in its perfectly annular black and red =
bands; the latter are=20

margined with yellowish and spotted with black. A=20


_
were at stake. They were after Teeny-bits like wolves on the trail of a rab=
bit, but only three of them=20

had a chance to reach the Ridgley player. The first of these--the quarter-b=
ack--made the fatal=20

mistake of underestimating Teeny-bits' speed. The half-back shifted directi=
on slightly and eluded=20

the grasp of the purple player. The other two were slightly in the rear and=
 their only chance was to=20

come up from behind and overtake the runner by superior swiftness. But they=
 were not equal to it,=20

and, although they tried valiantly and held their own, they did not succeed=
 in gaining on the carrier=20

of the ball as he crossed one white mark after another.  [Illustration: ONL=
Y THREE OF THEM=20

HAD A CHANCE TO REACH THE RIDGLEY PLAYER.]  A roar like the pounding of a m=
ighty sea=20

against a craggy shore sounded in Teeny-bits' ears, but it seemed to him di=
stant and detached=20

from the thing he was doing. For the moment he was a living machine of spee=
d with only one=20

thought in his mind,--to reach that last white line, to cross it and to pla=
nt the pigskin ball behind the=20

padded goal posts. He did it,--and lay panting on the ground while Neil Dur=
ant came running up=20

and slapped him on the back and said words to him which Teeny-bits never re=
membered.  The=20

captain kicked the goal which tied the score while a continuous din of unor=
ganized shouting rose=20

from the Ridgley stands. It was no moment for organized cheering. The cheer=
 leader himself was=20

leaping up and down, throwing his megaphone into the air and emitting war w=
hoops which were=20

drowned and assimilated by the volume of shouts that echoed back and forth.=
  The old-timers up=20

there in the stands now began to breathe fast; this was not merely a _good_=
 game of football, it=20

was a _wonderful_ game, a struggle in which extraordinary playing and fine =
spirit and brains and=20

courage were united to make a combat that would live long in the memory of =
every person who=20

witnessed it.  Up where the red was waving aloft, a white-haired man who di=
d not understand the=20

plays of football very well suddenly found that he had grasped the idea of =
this magnificent game.=20

He was thumping the back of some one whom he had never seen before and givi=
ng voice to such=20

yells of delight that the motherly-looking woman who sat beside him said to=
 herself that he must=20

suddenly have gone out of his senses.  "Teeny-bits did something wonderful,=
 then, didn't he?" she=20

shouted in his ear, and old Daniel Holbrook, her husband, shouted back:  "Y=
ou bet your _life_ he=20

did; it was Teeny-bits; he ran all the way over the home plate or whatever =
they call it and made a=20

score. I dunno but he's won the game _all by himself_."  In another part of=
 the stands Doctor Wells=20

was sitting beside Mr. Stevens.  "That was a magnificent run!" exclaimed th=
e Head. "Magnificent! I=20

declare--well--now we're even."  "Yes, we're even!" said the English master=
. "And I've discovered=20

something."  "What?"  "Well, they say that the head of this school never ge=
ts excited, but just now=20

when Teeny-bits was running you nearly pushed me out of my seat--and I _thi=
nk_ I heard a yell=20

that came from your direction."  "Did I shout?" asked the Head.  "'Shout' i=
sn't the word," said the=20

English master. "_Yell_ with a capital Y describes it."  "Back in '86, I us=
ed to play half-back=20

myself," said Doctor Wells. "Here we are; they're at it again."  Ridgley ki=
cked off to Jefferson and=20

immediately was subjected to a fierce assault that taxed the utmost powers =
of endurance to=20

withstand it. The Jefferson team was fighting harder than ever and playing =
with machine-like=20

smoothness. They carried the ball for twenty-five yards and then punted, an=
d downed Neil Durant=20

in his tracks. inches, length of the tail 1-9/10 inch. The _coccineus_ has =
the under part of the body=20

whitish, immaculate. The _fulvius_ seems to belong to the genus _vipera_; i=
t has the fangs, but=20

not the orifice behind the nostril, which communicates with the reservoir o=
f venom, so conspicuous=20

in the _crotali_, &c.  _Ophisaurus ventralis._ The tail of this snake not o=
nly breaks in pieces when=20



struck with a weapon, but portions of it are thrown off at the will of the =
serpent. This singular fact I=20

witnessed in Georgia. This is one of the many which are called horn-snakes.=
 A tip of the tail of one=20

of them was once brought to me as having been taken from a recently withere=
d tree, which the=20

bearer assured me was destroyed by the insertion of this formidable instrum=
ent, and it was not=20

without considerable difficulty he was convinced of the innocence of the ta=
il, and of having been=20

the dupe of a knave. There seems to be a peculiar character in the mode of =
imbrication of the=20

scales of this species, each one of these at the lateral edges, passes bene=
ath the lateral scale on=20

one side, and over the edge of the opposite one. It has been described unde=
r five different generic=20

names, and four different specific ones.  The _Crotali_ do not gain a singl=
e joint only to the rattle=20

annually, as is generally supposed. They gain more than one each year, the =
exact number being=20

probably regulated in a great measure by the quantity of nourishment the an=
imal has received.=20

Rattle-snakes in Peale's Museum have been observed to produce 3 or 4 in a y=
ear, and to lose as=20

many from the extremity during the same time. Hence it is obvious, that the=
 growth of these=20

curious appendages is irregular, and that the age of an individual cannot b=
e determined from their=20

number. Mr. Rubens Peale informed me, that a female of _Crotalus horridus_,=
 Beauv. _durissus_,=20

Daud. which lived in his Museum more than fourteen years, had eleven joints=
 to her rattle when=20

first in his possession; that several joints were acquired and lost annuall=
y, and that at her death,=20

which occurred last year, she had the same number as when brought to the Mu=
seum; she had,=20

however, during that time received an accession of four inches to her lengt=
h. Her death was=20

occasioned by an abortion.  The _C. adamanteus_, Beauvois. _Rhombifer_, Dau=
d. is by much the=20

largest of our North American serpents, and doubtless is the species which =
Catesby saw a=20

specimen of, eight feet long.  _Crotalus miliarius_ varies in some characte=
rs from those laid down=20

by authors. A specimen within my view has five dorsal series, of alternate,=
 irregularly orbicular=20

black spots, those of the intermediate series are obsolete, and slightly co=
nnected across the back,=20

those of the vertebral series have not red centres, and are edged with a wh=
ite line; the ventral=20

spots are disposed adventitiously, so as not to be traced into longitudinal=
 series; they are large,=20

black, irregularly orbicular, and occupy about one half of the surface, whi=
ch is white. Ventral plates=20

140; subcaudal, 33, of which the six terminal ones are bifid. Joints of the=
 rattle with but one=20

transverse contraction on the middle of each, besides the terminal contract=
ion. Total length 1 foot=20

4=C2=BC inches, tail two inches. It appears to be more vindictive than the =
two species before mentioned.=20

The individual here noticed we encountered in East Florida; he struck at Mr=
. W. Maclure and=20

myself successively as we passed by him, without any previous intimation of=
 his presence, owing=20

to the inaudible smallness of his rattle, and its having but three joints; =
he was killed by Mr. T.=20

Peale, (whom we preceded) while preparing for another assault. This inciden=
t is noted as a=20


_
to advance the ball and gained a first down, then, meeting with no further =
success, punted. And so=20

the ball see-sawed back and forth until the piping whistle of the timekeepe=
r announced the close=20

of the third quarter.  A feeling of great happiness and determination had b=
een filling Teeny-bits'=20

mind during these last few minutes. At the same time a curious impression h=
ad been making itself=20

felt upon him,--an admiration for this big captain of the Jefferson team wh=
o fought so hard and so=20

cleanly, who rallied his men after each successful assault by the Ridgley t=
eam, and like Neil=20

Durant, inspired them to fight harder and harder.  There was no need for ta=
lking now. In the brief=20

interval before the last period of the game began, Neil Durant, looking at =
his team-mates, saw in=20

their faces determination and confidence. Nothing that he could say or that=
 _any one_ could say=20

would alter their conviction that victory _must_ rest with the red.  That l=
ast period was a phase of=20

the game that could justly be called a climax. It began with a steady and d=
etermined march of the=20

Jefferson team which, starting from the twenty-yard line, carried the ball =
forward by line plunges,=20

by forward passes, by end runs and by sheer, dogged determination on and  _=
Salamandra=20

alleganiensis_, Daud. appears to be synonymous with _S. gigantea_ of Dr. Ba=
rton. It was first=20

described by Mr. Latreille in Deterv. Ed. of Buffon, tom. 11. The name _all=
eganiensis_, although=20

defective, as it indicates no character, has however the unalienable right =
of priority.  _Salamandra=20

subviolacea_, Barton. This name has been rejected by Mr. Daudin, and substi=
tuted by that of=20

_venenosa_, I do not know for what reason, as none is assigned.  _Salamandr=
a punctata_, Gmel.=20

This appellation was originally given and restricted to the _stelio_ of Cat=
esby. tab. 10.=20

(represented in the bill of Ardea Herodias) and was adopted by many subsequ=
ent authors, but was=20

finally rejected by Daudin, who considered the species the same as Barton's=
 _subviolacea_. He=20

concurred with Mr. Latreille in appropriating the name thus rejected to _va=
r. _ of _Lacerta_,=20

_aquatica_ of Gmel. Notwithstanding this high authority I cannot but coinci=
de with Professor=20

Barton in this instance, in believing it altogether distinct. The single ch=
aracter of the subocellate=20

spots, though not remarked by this author, is a sufficiently discriminative=
 one; these ocell=C3=A6 are=20

always present, and in no one of the varieties I have seen has the approxim=
ation to the=20


_
shadow of the Ridgley goal posts and Jefferson seemed to have the victory w=
ithin her grasp. A=20

terrific run by the captain planted the ball on the Ridgley four-yard line =
for a first down, and there=20

was no person shouting for the purple who did not believe that he was about=
 to witness that most=20

glorious of football events--a well-earned touchdown, after a magnificent m=
arch the length of the=20

field.  Big Tom Curwood was battered, the guards beside him were battered a=
nd the tackles=20

crouched low as if they would welcome a chance to lie down flat on the brow=
n render a specific=20

discrepance equivocal. Catesby's variety with the ocell=C3=A6 on the tail s=
eems to be the least=20

common; in general these spots, or epupillate ocell=C3=A6, are exclusively =
confined to a line on each=20

side of the back, about six in each, extending from the base of the head to=
 the origin of the tail,=20

though there are sometimes scattered smaller ones on each side of the body,=
 and upon the vertex=20

of the head, they are of a beautiful reddish colour, enclosed by a definite=
 black areola; the upper=20

part of the body is brownish, with numerous, distant=20


_
stiffened, the secondary defense moved closer to the line and the whole tea=
m in one mass met the=20

Jefferson charge. Once, twice, and three times the purple backs plunged int=
o the red line and=20

each time they carried the ball forward a little more than a yard.  On that=
 third try the referee dived=20

into the mass in a manner that suggested to the watchers that the score had=
 been made, but when=20

he finally got his hands on the ball it was apparent that Jefferson still n=
eeded a few inches. The=20

signal came quickly and the two vertebral, obtuse carina, the inferior surf=
ace of the body of a fine=20

yellow or orange, with distant black points, the tail[37] is compressed, an=
cipital, attenuated to an=20

obtuse tip, longer than the body, and punctured with black in like manner. =
The younger specimens=20

vary considerably, in being, on many parts of the body, destitute of black =
punctures, and in having=20

the dorsal and ventral colour, of the same pale orange. It is decidedly aqu=
atic. Several specimens=20

are preserved in the collection of the Academy of=20

bone and muscle plunged against each other. The pile subsided and one after=
 another the players=20

on the fringe drew away until the referee could see the ball. There was a m=
oment of tense=20

expectancy and then the official waved his arm in a direction that brought =
forth a vast yell of joy=20

Sciences, and from these it is evident that the reddish colour of the suboc=
ellate spots is destroyed=20

by the action of the antiseptic liquid; to this circumstance it is probably=
 owing that these spots have=20

been hitherto described as white.  After stating these differential traits,=
