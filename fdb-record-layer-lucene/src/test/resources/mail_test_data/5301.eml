claimed to be a lineal descendant of the Prophet, divinely commissioned to extend his religion, 

and especially to drive the Christians out of the Soudan. He was in his earlier life an employe of 

the Egyptian government, but quarrelled with the governor of his

it, now? Reckon you've sure-enough got to have those papers back before you can go on, do 

you?"  "You know I must. You know what I've been preaching and talking: I have meant every 

word of it in good faith, and when I began to doubt the good faith of those behind me, I was forced 

to cast about for a weapon. It was handed to me almost miraculously, and as long as I held it my 

good name before the people of the State was safe. As the matter stands now, I'm a broken man, 

dad. After the election I shall be billeted from one end of the State to the other as the most 

shameless liar that ever breathed!"  The senator was rocking his great head slowly upon the chair-

_role_ of the Mahdi; and in that capacity he did a great deal of mischief. He captured the chief city 

of Kordofan, and made it the capital; he overwhelmed the army of Hicks Pacha, and finally shut up 

General Gordon in Khartoom, as has been related before. He died in 1885, and was succeeded by 

Abdallah. But he had deprived Egypt of even the nominal possession of the Soudan."  "He was a

is said to come from Hodeida, a port north of it.  "Those

may seem to you, I shall fight you and your machine to a finish. You think I can't do it? I'll show 

you. I've got five days, and they are all my own. This campaign has been rotten to the core from 

the very beginning. You have tried to keep me from finding it written Babelmandel in the old 

geographies when I went to school. Bab means a gate wherever you find it; and this is the 'Gate of 

Tears,' so called from the perils it presented to the small craft of the Arabians; and many of them 

were wrecked here," said the commander when the party were gathered on the promenade as 

usual if anything was to be seen. "We are now in latitude 12 deg. 30', and I notice that some of the
