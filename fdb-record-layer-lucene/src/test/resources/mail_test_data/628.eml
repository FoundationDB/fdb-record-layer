retary, philodendron monstera close to it, examining the different parts, w=

for of course Di has all her mother's money, two hundred thousand English p=
ounds; and through the Mountstuarts, and her aunt who is married to the For=

you can guess."  "A great bird--like the roc of the Arabian Nights," said N=
at.  "No."  "Some sort of=20

eagle, larger than any ever seen in these parts," ventured Sam.  "No, that'=
s as far off as Nat was."=20

"A kite, carrying an engine, working a camera, for taking moving pictures a=
t night," was Bony's=20

guess.  "No," said Will. "It's your turn, Jack."  Jack thought for a minute=
. He glanced at the big=20

shed, and then started, as a sudden idea came to him.  "A balloon?" he aske=
d.  "No, but you're=20

nearest to it. Shall I tell them, Uncle Andy?"  Mr. Swaim nodded.  "It's a =
great aeroplane!"=20

exclaimed Will.  "An aeroplane!" exclaimed all the other lads in a breath. =
 "A new form of=20

aeroplane, with propellers built like the great wings of a bird," explained=
 Mr. Swaim. "It's an=20

invention of mine, but is not perfected yet, though it flies fairly well. T=
here are certain parts, on=20

which I have not yet got my patents, and that is why I do not admit any of =
the men to the shed=20

when the '_Eagle_' as I call her, is there. But Will got in before I could =
stop him, though I guess=20

he'll not try to get ahead of his uncle."  "No, indeed, Uncle Andy!"  "And =
did you fly it over our=20

camp?" asked Jack.  "I did, and that was the sound you heard. It makes quit=
e a whirring noise,=20

when the wings are working fast, and the engine has a peculiar throbbing so=
und. I don't wonder=20

you and the Indian guide were frightened."  "Oh, Long Gun was more scared t=
han we were,"=20

explained Nat.  "Probably. You see I only flew it at night, because I did n=
ot want any one to see it."=20

"And it really works?" asked Bony.  "Yes, but not as well as I would like i=
t to. I have only been able=20

to take up myself and one other man, so far. I want it to carry at least fi=
ve passengers, but I shall=20

have to alter my engine, or change the shape of the wings, or else increase=
 their size, before it will=20

lift that much. But Stephen and I often flew over the mountain. We used to =
judge of our position by=20

your camp-fire. At least I suppose, from what Will tells me, that it was yo=
ur fire."  "Yes," said Jack.=20

"We heard you calling to one another one night, and that kept us guessing m=
ore than ever."=20

"What about those queer marks in the snow?" asked Bony.  Mr. Swaim looked p=
uzzled until Jack=20

explained.  "Oh," said the inventor, "that was when we had an accident. The=
 _Eagle_ came down=20

unexpectedly, and turned turtle. Neither I nor Stephen was hurt, but we had=
 quite a time righting=20

the machine. The marks you saw must have been the impressions of the wings =
in the snow."  "We=20

thought it was a great bird," explained Nat.  "And I wasn't so far out, cal=
ling it an eagle," spoke=20

Bony, cracking a couple of finger knuckles, and ending up with both thumbs.=
  "I have been out=20

here in this secluded place for several months," went on Mr. Swaim. "That i=
s why I left no address=20

for my nephew's guardian, as I did not want to be disturbed. I never suppos=
ed my nephew would=20

try to find me, and he probably would not have done so, except by accident.=
 But I will soon go=20

back East, for my invention is almost perfected, and I want to give some ex=
hibitions, and try for=20

some government prizes. Would you boys like to see it tried?"  "You bet!" e=
xclaimed Jack=20

fervently, and the others nodded assent.  "We were going to give it a trial=
 when you boys arrived=20

here," went on Mr. Swaim. "Now that Will is all right, I think I will take =
the _Eagle_ out for a flight. I=20

was considerably worried," he and deserted; and though I hate Di, and alway=
s have hated her,=20

ever since the tiny child and her mother (a beautiful, rich, young Californ=
ian widow) came into my=20

father's house in New York, she does know how to manage me better than anyo=
ne else, when I=20

am in such moods. I could have screamed for her, as I sat there helplessly =
looking through the=20

open doors: and then, at last, I saw her, as if my wish had been a call whi=
ch had reached her ears=20

over the music in the ballroom.  She had stopped dancing, and with her part=
ner (Lord Robert,=20

again) entered the room which lay between our "den" and the ballroom, Proba=
bly they would have=20



gone on to the conservatory, which can be reached in that way, but I cried =
her name as loudly as I=20

could, and she heard. Only a moment she paused--long enough to send Lord Ro=
bert away--and=20

then she came straight to me. He must have been furious: but I didn't care =
for that.  I had been=20

wanting her badly, but when I saw her, so bright and beautiful, looking as =
if she were the joy of life=20

made incarnate, I should have liked to strike her hard, first on one cheek =
and then the other,=20

deepening the rose to crimson, and leaving an ugly red mark for each finger=
.  "Have you a=20

headache, dear?" she asked, in that velvet voice she keeps for me--as if I =
were a thing only fit for=20

pity and protection.  "It's my heart," said I. "It feels like a clock runni=
ng down. Oh, I wish I could die,=20

and end it all! What's the good of me--to myself or anyone?"  "Don't talk l=
ike that, my poor one,"=20

she said. "Shall I take you upstairs to your own room?"  "No, I think I sho=
uld faint if I had to go=20

upstairs," I answered. "Yet I can't stay here. What shall I do?"  "What abo=
ut Uncle Eric's study?" Di=20

asked. She always calls Lord Mountstuart 'Uncle Eric,' though he isn't her =
uncle. Her mother and=20

his wife were sisters, that's all: and then there was the other sister who =
married the British=20

Secretary for Foreign Affairs, a cousin of Lord Mountstuart's. That family =
seemed to have a craze=20

for American girls; but Lord Mountstuart makes an exception of me. He's civ=
il, of course, because=20

he's an abject slave of Di's, and she refused to come and pay a visit in En=
gland without me: but I=20

give him the shivers, I know very well: and I take an impish joy in making =
him jump.  "I'm sure he=20

won't be there this evening," Di went on, when I hesitated. "He's playing b=
ridge with a lot of dear=20

old boys in the library, or was, half an hour ago. Come, let me help you th=
ere. It's only a step."=20

She put her pretty arm round my waist, and leaning on her I walked across t=
he room, out into a=20

corridor, through a tiny "bookroom" where odd volumes and old magazines are=
 kept, into Lord=20

Mountstuart's study.  It is a nice room, which he uses much as his wife use=
s her boudoir. The=20

library next door is rather a show place, but the study has only Lord Mount=
stuart's favourite books=20

in it. He writes there (he has written a novel or two, and thinks himself l=
iterary), and some pictures=20

he has painted in different parts of the world hang on the walls: for he al=
so fancies himself artistic.=20

In one corner is a particularly comfortable, cushiony lounge where, I suppo=
se, the distinguished=20

author lies and thinks out his subjects, or dreams them out. And it was to =
this that Di led me.  She=20

settled me among some fat pillows of old purple and gold brocade, and asked=
 if she should ring=20

and get a little brandy.  "No," I said, "I shall feel=20


_
men brought me reports of strangers trying to enter the camp, and I gave st=
rict orders to keep=20

them out. That is why my men were rather brusk with you."  "That's all righ=
t," answered Jack. "We=20

had no right to come around, but we were very curious."  "I don't blame you=
. Well, I'll go and get=20

the machine ready for a trial spin."  "Excuse me for mentioning it," said J=
ack, as Mr. Swaim=20

prepared to leave the cabin, "but you have a chap here named Jerry Chowden?=
 My friends and I=20

used to know him."  "Is that so?" asked Mr. Swaim in some surprise. "I know=
 little about him. He=20

came to me one day, and asked for work, saying he needed money. As I was sh=
ort of help I took=20

him on, but I am sorry I did so, for my foreman tells me he is not worth hi=
s salt, and is lazy in the=20

bargain. He never said anything to me about meeting you. I shall get rid of=
 him, I think. Is he a=20

friend of yours?"  "Well, I guess not!" exclaimed Jack heartily.  "I'm glad=
 of it, for I don't like his=20

manners. Now I'll go and see about cool here."  "You look better already!" =
exclaimed Di. "Soon,=20

when you've lain and rested awhile, you'll be a different girl."  "Ah, how =
I wish I _could_ be a=20

different girl!" I sighed. "A strong, well girl, and tall and beautiful, an=
d admired by everyone,--like=20

you--or Maxine de Renzie."  "What makes you think of her?" asked Di, quickl=
y.  "Ivor was just=20

talking to me of her. You know he calls me his 'pal,' and tells me things h=
e doesn't tell everybody.=20

He thinks a great deal about Maxine, still."  "She'd be a difficult woman t=
o forget, if she's as=20

attractive off the stage as she is on."  "What a pity we didn't come in tim=
e to meet here when she=20

was playing in London with George Allendale. Everybody used to invite her t=
o their houses, it=20

seems. Ivor was telling me that he first met her here, and that it's such a=
 pleasant memory,=20

whenever he comes to this house. I suppose that's one reason he likes to co=
me so much."  "No=20

doubt," said Di sharply.  "He got so fascinated talking of her," I went on.=
=20


_
taking the ship out. Will may remain with you."  The boys had plenty to tal=
k about now. Their=20

exchange of experiences of the incidents of the last few hours was interrup=
ted by the appearance=20

of the great aeroplane, as the men wheeled it out of the shed.  "Wow! Petri=
fied pancakes!"=20

exclaimed Nat. "That's a dandy, though!"  Indeed the _Eagle_, in spite of t=
he fact that Mr. Swaim=20

had said it was not completed, was a fine example of an aeroplane. The boys=
 he had a dance with=20

Mrs. Allendale. Of course Maxine had made a great hit, and all that; but sh=
e didn't stand quite as=20

high as she does now, since she's become the fashion in Paris. Perhaps she =
had nothing except=20

her salary, then, whereas she must have saved up a lot of money by this tim=
e. I have an idea that=20

Ivor would have proposed to her when she was in London if he'd thought her =
success=20

established."  "Nonsense!" Di broke out, her cheeks very pink. "As=20
