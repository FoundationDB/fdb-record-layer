philodendron monstera Domine secundum justitiam meam, et secundum innocenti=
am meam super me.=E2=80=99 This request the Psalmist makes to God, and such=
 a request, O king! does the duchess of Orleans now make to thee, as she re=
quires nothing but judgment and justice. May it please thee to listen to th=
e case may be somewhat more difficult, as the unsuccessful suicide may manu=
facture evidence against the accused and hide to some extent the evidence o=
f suicide. These cases can usually be decided, however, in connection with =
the circumstantial and other evidence. The philodendron monstera Domine sec=
undum justitiam meam, et secundum innocentiam meam super me.=E2=80=99 This =
request the Psalmist makes to God, and such a request, O king! does the duc=
hess of Orleans now make to thee, as she requires nothing but judgment and =
justice. May it please thee to listen to the case may be somewhat more diff=
icult, as the unsuccessful suicide may manufacture evidence against the acc=
used and hide to some extent the evidence of suicide. These cases can usual=
ly be decided, however, in connection with the circumstantial and other evi=
dence. The _
Berry, in his presence and in that of the king of Sicily, our adversary adv=
anced towards the=20

servants of the late duke of Orleans, entreating them to make every inquiry=
 after the author of this=20

murder, and begging them to recommend him to the duchess of Orleans and to =
her children: then=20

the three noble persons having conferred together, the duke of Berry declar=
ed the request was=20

proper, and that they would exert themselves as much as possible to discove=
r the person who had=20

committed this atrocious act.  =E2=80=98O, duke of Burgundy! thou promiseds=
t to do this, by the mouth of=20

my lord of Berry, whereas thou didst the worst thou could; for, not satisfi=
ed with having caused the=20

murder of his body, thou seekest to destroy the reputation of the defunct. =
Thou promisedst to seek=20

most diligently after the murderer, while thou knewest it was thyself that =
wast the criminal.  =E2=80=98Now,=20

my lords, consider well, that after a resolution had been taken to seek aft=
er the author of this=20

crime, our adversary, the duke of Burgundy, conscious of his guilt, confess=
ed that it was he who=20

had caused the death of the duke of Orleans. When he made this confession o=
n his knees to the=20

king and my lord the duke of Berry, he affirmed, that what he had done was =
by the instigation of=20

the devil; and certainly in this instance he spoke the truth, for he was ur=
ged to it by jealousy and=20

ambition.  =E2=80=98O, my lords! weigh well this confession, and how our ad=
versary contradicts=20

himself,=E2=80=94for when he first confessed his guilt, he said he had been=
 instigated to it by the devil; but=20

afterward he commands it to be argued, that he committed so atrocious a dee=
d legally and=20

justifiably. If he feel no shame for his wickedness, he ought at least to b=
e sensible of his thus=20

meanly contradicting himself. Consider also, that he was desirous of concea=
ling his crime; and=20

God knows, that if his deed had been of that worth as has been advanced for=
 him, he would have=20

gloried in having so done, and not have wished to remain undiscovered as th=
e perpetrator. And=20

why did he own his guilt? Because it could no longer be concealed. That thi=
s was the cause is=20

apparent; for when he perceived that it must be known, he fled most precipi=
tately from Paris, like=20

to one in despair. He might have said, with Judas the traitor, =E2=80=98Pec=
cavi tradens sanguinem justum.=E2=80=99=20

=E2=80=98O Philip, duke of Burgundy! wert thou now alive, thou wouldst not =
have approved the conduct of=20

our adversary, but wouldst have said thy son had degenerated. Thou wert sur=
named The=20

Bold,=E2=80=94but he was always fearful and suspicious, consequently a trai=
tor. Thou mightst have truly=20

applied to him what is written in the fifth chapter of the Acts of the Apos=
tles, =E2=80=98Cur temptavit=20

sathanas cor tuum mentiri te Spiritui Sancto? non es mentitus hominibus sed=
 Deo.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98My fifth=20

argument is grounded on the falsehood of the declarations of our opponent, =
that he had caused=20

the death of the duke of Orleans with the purest intentions; for, on the co=
ntrary, he committed this=20

crime through lust of power, and to gain greater authority over the kingdom=
, and also to possess=20

himself of the royal treasury, that he might more largely gratify and incre=
ase his dependants. This=20

is evident from the conduct of our adversary before and after the death of =
the duke of Orleans.  =E2=80=98It=20

is a truth, that shortly after the death of his father the duke of Burgundy=
, he exerted himself to the=20

utmost to obtain similar power in this realm, and with the same pensions an=
d authority as his late=20

father had enjoyed. But this was not granted to him, because his father had=
 been uncle to the king,=20

and was a man of great prudence and understanding, qualities not possessed =
by our adversary.=20

=E2=80=98Having been disappointed, he instantly began to practise how he co=
uld better obtain his object;=20

and for this end, prior to the death distance may indicate the occurrence o=
f a struggle, or that the=20

body was moved, or it may show the tracks of a murderer. As to the latter p=
oint, _the imprints of=20

the hands and feet_, whether bloody or not, may indicate murder and establi=
sh the identity of the=20



murderer. We have already seen how they may occur on the deceased and indic=
ate a struggle,=20

and thus be presumptive of murder. When the marks are made by the naked foo=
t, it is well to=20

examine it by lining it off in squares, and so to compare it with the impri=
nt of the foot of the=20

accused. Simple inspection can sometimes give the required evidence. We may=
 even get an=20

impression of such imprints in the snow. Imprints of the boots or shoes wor=
n by the accused=20

compared with those imprints found at and near the scene of the crime may s=
ometimes help to=20

clear up the case, but this may perhaps be considered outside of the sphere=
 of the medical=20

witness. Such and other signs of a struggle about one of the blood-spots wo=
uld indicate that the=20

wound was received there, though death may have occurred at another spot. I=
n such a case it=20

would be well to examine to see if there was much blood where the body was =
found, for if there=20

was not it would indicate that the body had been moved there after death, a=
nd thus be strongly=20

presumptive of murder.  As furnishing some evidence which may help to disti=
nguish between=20

suicide and homicide in the origin of wounds, the question may be asked, WH=
AT WAS THE=20

POSITION OF THE VICTIM WHEN INJURED OR DYING? and also, WHAT WERE THE=20

RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE VICTIM AND ASSAILANT?  The position of the victim=
 at the=20

moment of the injury is sometimes indicated by the position of the wound, t=
he direction of its tract,=20

and the direction from the wound of the blood on the body and clothes. On t=
he neck or extremities=20

the course and form of the wound may indicate the position of these parts w=
hen the wound was=20

inflicted, for sometimes in flexions of these parts the skin lies in folds,=
 and a wound inflicted when=20

these parts were so flexed would be irregular, wavy, or zig-zag. Further, t=
he position and=20

movement of these parts necessary to restore directness to the wound may in=
dicate the position of=20

the parts when the wound was inflicted. The examination of the relative pos=
itions of the wound in=20

the clothes and the body may help to indicate the position of the body when=
 wounded. The=20

position of the blood on the body and the direction of the blood from the w=
ound, whether below or=20

at the sides, etc., tends to show the position of the body when bleeding. T=
hus if the body was at=20

any time in the erect position, some of the blood-stains will be vertically=
 below the wound, or if the=20

victim was lying on the back then the stain would be at the sides only and =
not below the wound,=20

except such stains as indicate that they were produced by arterial jets. Fe=
w suicides cut the throat=20

in the recumbent position; therefore it may be considered in the light of a=
n indication of homicide if=20

the blood-stains show that the victim was not erect after the wound was inf=
licted. It is well also to=20

note the form, direction, and obliquity of the blood-spot. This would indic=
ate, by comparison with=20

the wound, the relative position of the wounded person and the blood-spot, =
and thus show=20

whether the body had been moved or not, as, for instance, by the murderer f=
or the purpose of=20

robbery. The force of the bleeding is also indicated by the form of the spo=
t, and this would indicate=20

how rapidly death probably ensued. This fact might thus help us to judge wh=
ether the victim=20

probably died where he was wounded, and whether other and remote blood-spot=
s would not be=20

presumptive of murder. If the victim is found in night-clothes, this fact w=
ould help to show that he=20

was lying down when wounded. The medical evidence as to=20


_
duke of Orleans, he caused reports to be circulated throughout the kingdom =
of his affection to the=20

public weal, and that he alone was the fittest person to govern it. When he=
 perceived, that in spite=20

of his fictions, the duke of Orleans still possessed the authority he was p=
anting for, because he=20

was the son of a king, and the only brother to the king, and more fit for t=
he government than the=20

duke of Burgundy,=E2=80=94seeing, therefore, all his plans frustrated, he c=
onspired to take away the life of=20

the duke of Orleans, expecting that when he should be made away with, no ot=
her person would=20

dare to dispute his having the sole government of the kingdom.  =E2=80=98Th=
is is the principal cause of so=20

barbarous a murder, notwithstanding the arguments that have been urged in h=
is excuse, as is well=20

known to all. His conduct, likewise, after the death of my late lord of Orl=
eans, confirms it; for=20

instantly, on his return to Paris, he began to push forward those that were=
 his dependants and=20

supporters, by depriving many valiant and deserving men of places which the=
y held under the=20

king, without any other cause but that they had been appointed to them by m=
y lord of Orleans, as=20

others had been, and giving their offices to such as he pleased, in order t=
o gain more authority and=20

power. He also endeavoured to make all placemen, particularly those who had=
 the therefore,=20

circumstantial and not very positive; that in regard to the _relative posit=
ion of the victim and=20

assailant_ is even less positive. We presuppose in this question that the c=
ase is one of murder.=20

We are not to prove murder or refute suicide. We can rarely be _positive_ a=
s to the relative=20

position of the assailed and the assailant. A wound in the back may be caus=
ed by some one in=20

front with an arm behind. The direction of the wound would indicate this, f=
or if the assailant is right-

handed and inflicts a wound on the back from in front, a stab-wound would a=
lmost always be=20

directed from left to right, an incised wound from right to left, both from=
 above downward. With a=20

left-handed murderer the direction would most likely be from right to left =
and from above downward=20

for a stab-wound, and from left to right and from above downward for an inc=
ised wound. If the=20

assailant were at the back of the victim and wounded him in front, the dire=
ction of these wounds=20

would be the opposite of the above, _i.e._, from right to left for a stab-w=
ound and from left to right=20

and from above downward for an incised wound with a right-handed assailant =
and _vice versa_=20

with a left-handed assailant. These wounds occur more commonly than those o=
f the back, and are=20

especially noticeable in incised wounds of the throat. In the case of these=
 incised=20


_
management of the royal treasury, subservient to him, that they might not r=
efuse him any thing.=20

=E2=80=98Our adversary was most anxious to have the government of the treas=
ury, and obtained from it the=20

sum of two hundred thousand livres, by warrants thereon, or otherwise, grea=
t part of which he=20

distributed among his people, as is well known to the clerks of the treasur=
y; and this was his=20

principal object in putting to death his rival in power, my late lord of Or=
leans, namely,=20

covetousness of the king=E2=80=99s money, and to give it away and enrich hi=
s followers. It appears,=20

therefore, that covetousness and pride have been the springs of his actions=
; but, please God, he=20

shall not in this instance profit from them,=E2=80=94and the from behind, t=
he direction from left to right and=20

from above downward resembles that of self-inflicted wounds in the same sit=
uation. As a general=20

rule, wounds are on the same side of the victim that the assailant was; the=
 facts given above help=20

to show us the exceptions. Thus a wound on one side is presumptive that the=
 murderer was on=20

that side, or possibly at the front or back and only exceptionally on the o=
pposite side. The=20

presence of wounds on one side only may help to confirm the testimony of a =
witness that the=20

victim was against a wall or some other obstacle which protected the other =
side. The question of=20

the relative position of the combatants in duels and the nature of the weap=
ons used as shown by=20


_
seventh chapter, shall be verified, =E2=80=98Cum habuerit quod cupierit, po=
ssidere non poterit.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98My sixth=20

and last argument is founded on the conduct of our adversary, who, not sati=
sfied with having=20

murdered the late duke of Orleans, attempts, in conjunction with his follow=
ers, to deprive him of his=20

good fame and renown, by defamatory libels, wherein he groundlessly and fal=
sely charges him=20

with the crimes of divine and human high treason, of which he was perfectly=
 innocent, as has=20

been, and shall be again demonstrated.  =E2=80=98It may be said, that this =
justification is even more=20

scandalous than the in other countries, to determine whether the combat was=
 regular and fair.  In=20

all cases of suspected suicide, but where a doubt exists between suicide an=
d murder, or even=20

accident, _hereditary disposition and organic affections_ of the body, such=
 as alcoholism,=20

incurable or painful diseases, chronic inflammation of the brain and mening=
es or of the genito-

urinary organs=E2=80=94all such and hereditary predisposition may support t=
he idea of suicide.=20

IMPUTED OR SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS.  Closely allied with the question of the =
suicidal or=20

homicidal origin of wounds is the question whether a wound=20


_
obstinately to persevere in it is diabolical. And this manner of justifying=
 murder is the defence of=20

his own sin, and daring to do what God hates: he follows not the example of=
 David when he said,=20

=E2=80=98Non declines cor meum in verba malici=C3=A6 ad excusandas excusati=
ones in peccatis.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98I come now=20

to my third division, in which I shall reply to the defamatory libel, and t=
o the accusations therein,=20

that were made by our adversary against the character of my late lord of Or=
leans. I may fairly=20

quote the words of the Psalmist, on the self-inflicted or inflicted by anot=
her. These wounds are=20

seldom fatal. In discussing the question whether a wound is self-inflicted =
or inflicted by another, we=20

have referred occasionally to suicidal wounds where the circumstances were =
such as apparently=20

purposely to imply murder and impute the cause of death to some one else. T=
his happens more=20

often in cases of unsuccessful suicide. Here we have recourse to the same e=
vidence that we have=20

gone over in the present section which helps to distinguish between a suici=
dal and a=20
