lerable to John, as are so often the well-meant consolations of his elders =
to a young man driven half frantic by warmer hopes and _
they were offended. Soon after the departure of Tom and his friends the gir=
ls started out with bags=20

to gather the balsam for the pillows. On the back porch they sat down to pu=
t on the snowshoes=20

which, by this time, they were all able to use with some proficiency. The t=
hree boys, snowballing=20

behind the barn, espied them.  "Hullo!" bawled Busy Izzy. "Here come the Am=
azons. They're going=20

on their own hook now--haven't any use for boys at all."  He threw a snowba=
ll; but Tom tripped him=20

into a bank of snow and spoiled his aim. "None o' that, Izzy!" he commanded=
.  "Let 'em alone,"=20

growled Bob Steele. "If they want to flock by themselves, who cares?"  "Not=
 I!" declared Izzy.=20

"Look at the Amazon March. My, my! if they should see a squirrel, or a rabb=
it, they'd come running=20

back in a hurry. They'd think it was another panther. Oh, my!"  But the gir=
ls paid himself up. I don't=20

clearly understand all the rights of the story. But there it is; the man co=
uldn't stand it, don't you=20

know. I suppose he thought nothing would ever be found out; and when he hea=
rd that Erskine was=20

suspected and taken, he was stunned at first. Of course he should have prod=
uced himself at once;=20

but all's well that ends well. He has done it now."  "The man--that did it?=
" It was Nora that said this,=20

gazing at him with perfectly colourless cheeks, standing out in the middle =
of the room, apart from=20

the others, who were for the moment too completely satisfied with the news =
to ask more.  "Don't=20

think it is crime," said Millefleurs, soothingly. "There is every reason to=
 conclude that accident will=20

be the verdict. In the meantime, I suppose he will be committed for trial; =
but all these are details,=20

don't you know," he said, in his=20


_
the woods. Helen suddenly saw a snow flake upon her jacket sleeve. She call=
ed Ruth's attention=20

to it.  "Maybe the snow will come quicker than Long Jerry thought," declare=
d the girl from the Red=20

Mill. "See! there's another."  "Oh, pshaw! what's a little snow?" scoffed B=
elle Tingley.  But the=20

flakes came faster and faster. Great feathery flakes they were at first. Th=
e girls went on, laughing=20

and chatting, with never a thought that harm could befall them through the =
gathering of these=20

fleecy droppings from the lowering clouds.     CHAPTER XIX  BESIEGED BY THE=
 STORM KING=20

Tom Cameron and his two friends were so busy setting up a target and throwi=
ng iced snow-balls=20

at it, that they barely noticed the first big flakes of the storm. But by a=
nd by these flakes passed=20

and then a wind of deadly chill swept down upon the camp and with it fine p=
ellets of snow--not=20

larger than pin-points--but which blinded one and hid all objects within te=
n feet.  "Come on!" roared=20

Bob. "This is no fun. Let's beat it to the house."  "Oh, it can't last long=
 this way," said Isadore=20

Phelps. "My goodness! did you ever see it snow harder in your life?"  "That=
 I never did," admitted=20

Tom. "I wonder if the girls have come back?"  "If they haven't," said Bob, =
"they'd better wait where=20

they are until this flurry is over."  "I hope they have returned," muttered=
 Tom, as they made their=20

way toward the rear of Snow Camp.  The snow came faster and faster, and thi=
cker and thicker.=20

Bob bumped square into the side of one of the out-sheds, and roared because=
 he found blood=20

flowing from his nose.  "What do you say about this?" he bellowed. "How do =
we know we're going=20

right?"  "Here!" cried Isadore. "Where are you fellows? I don't want to get=
 lost in the back yard."=20

Tom found him (he had already seized the half-blinded Bob by the arm) and t=
he three, arm in arm,=20

made their way cautiously to the kitchen porch. They burst in on Janey and =
Mary with a whoop.=20

"Have the girls got back?" cried Tom, eagerly.  "I couldn't tell our friend=
 is clear and at liberty; and=20

in a few minutes he'll be here."  They scarcely noticed that Nora disappear=
ed out of the room in=20

the joyful commotion that followed. She went away, almost suffocating with =
the effort to keep her=20

emotion down. Did he know of whom it was that he was speaking? Was it possi=
ble that he knew?=20

the son of one, the brother of another--to Nora more than either. What did =
it mean? Nora could not=20

get breath. She could not stay in the room, and see all their relieved, del=
ighted faces, the=20

undisturbed satisfaction with which they listened and asked their questions=
. Was the man a fool?=20

Was he a creature devoid of heart or perception? An hour ago Nora had thoug=
ht that Rintoul's=20

absence from his post would kill her, that to see him do his duty was all s=
he wanted on earth. But=20

now the indifference of everybody around to what he had done, the ease with=
 which the story was=20

told, the unconsciousness of the listeners, was more intolerable to her tha=
n even that despair. She=20

could not bear it. She hurried away, not capable of a word, panting for bre=
ath, choked by her=20

heart, which beat in her throat, in her very ears--and by the anguish of he=
lplessness and=20

suspense, which was more than she could bear.     CHAPTER XLIII.   John Ers=
kine had received=20

Edith's letter that morning in his prison. His spirits were at a very low e=
bb when it was put into his=20

hand. Four days' confinement had taken the courage out of him more effectua=
lly than any other=20

discipline could have done; and though the prospect of his examination had =
brought in a=20

counterbalancing excitement, he was by no means so sure that everything wou=
ld come right as he=20

had been at first. Having once gone wrong, why should it come right? If the=
 public and the sheriff=20

(or whatever the man was) could entertain such an idea for four days, why n=
ot for four years or a=20

lifetime? When Edith's letter was put into his hand he was but beginning to=
 awake, to brace=20

himself up for an encounter with the hostile world. He=20


_
come in, by the looks of you boys, they'd better."  Tom did not stop to rem=
ove the snow, but=20

rushed into the great central hall which was used as a general sitting room=
.  "Where's Helen--and=20

Ruth--and the rest of them?" he demanded.  "Why, Thomas! you're all over sn=
ow," said Mr.=20

Cameron, comfortably reading his paper before the fire, in smoking jacket a=
nd slippers.  "Is it=20

snowing?" queried Mrs. Murchiston, from the warmest nook beside the hearth.=
 "Aren't the girls out=20

with you, Tom?"  "What's the matter, my son?" demanded his father, getting =
up quickly. "What has=20

happened?"  "I don't know that anything has happened," said Tom, swallowing=
 a big lump in his=20

throat, and trying to speak calmly. "The girls have not been with us. They =
went into the woods=20

somewhere to get stuff for their pillows. And it is snowing harder than I e=
ver knew it to snow=20

before."  "Oh, Tom!" must get his wits about him, and not permit himself to=
 be sacrificed without an=20

effort. And then, in a moment, up his heart went like a shuttlecock. _She_ =
had no doubt about him,=20

thank heaven! Her "dear Mr Erskine," repeated when it was not exactly neces=
sary, and which she=20

had drawn her pen through, but so lightly that the cancelling of the words =
only made them=20

emphatic, seemed to John to say everything that words could say. It said mo=
re, in fact, than Edith=20

would ever have said had he not been in trouble and in prison; and then tha=
t outbreak about=20

feminine impotence at the end! This was to John the sweetest pleasantry, th=
e most delightful jest.=20

He did not think of her indignation or bitterness as real. The idea that La=
dy Lindores and she=20

would have been his bail if they could, amused him so that he almost shed t=
ears over it; as well as=20

the complaint that they could=20


_
"Come! we'll go out and see about this at once," cried his father, and bega=
n to get into his out-of-

door clothing, including a pair of great boots.  "Is it snowing very hard, =
Tom?" queried the lady,=20

anxiously. "What makes you look so?"  For Tom was scared--and he showed it.=
 He turned short=20

around without answering Mrs. Murchiston again, and led the way to the much=
? If all went well,=20

John said to himself, with a leap of his heart--if all went well! It was un=
der the elation of this=20

stimulant that he got ready to proceed to Dunearn; and though to drive ther=
e in the dingy fly with a=20

guardian of the law beside him was not cheerful, his heart swelled high wit=
h the thought that other=20

hearts were beating with anxiety for=20


_
other boys had shaken off the snow and were hovering over the range for war=
mth.  "Found 'em all=20

right; didn't you?" demanded Bob Steele.  "No. They haven't come in," said =
Tom, shortly, and=20

immediately Bob began pulling on his coat again.  "Oh, pshaw!" said Isadore=
. "They'll be all right."=20

"Where are Jerry and the others?" Mr. Cameron asked the maids.  "Sure, sir,=
" said Mary, who was=20

peering wonderingly out of the window at the thick cloud of snow sweeping a=
cross the pane, tell=20

the truth, he had not the least idea how to manage his defence. Mr Monypenn=
y had visited him=20

again, and made him feel that truth was the last thing that was likely to s=
erve him, and that by far=20

his wisest plan would be to tell a lie and own himself guilty, and invent a=
 new set of circumstances=20

altogether. But he did not feel his imagination equal to this. He would hav=
e to hold by his original=20

story, keep to the facts, and nothing more. But surely some happy fortune w=
ould=20
