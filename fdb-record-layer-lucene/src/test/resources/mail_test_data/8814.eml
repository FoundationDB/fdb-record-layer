213 "Elementals" used by the highest Adept to do mechanical, not       intellectual work, as a 

physicist uses gases and other compounds.    214 Quoted from De Mirville, _op. cit._, vi. 43.    215 

_Ibid._, vi. 45.    216 _Ibid._, p. 46.    217 Amedee Fleury, _Rapports de St. Paul avec Seneque_, 

ii. 100. The       whole of this is summarised from De Mirville.    218 But we can never agree with 

closed, was really asleep, but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile:  "Go on, my 

good Parry, I am listening."  Groslow advanced to the door of the king's room, replaced on his 

head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests, looked for a moment contemptuously at this 

simple, yet touching scene, then turning to D'Artagnan, assumed an air of triumph at what he had 

achieved.

formal worship and prayers are of the absolute necessity of things,"       for the external can 

develop and grow and receive worship only at       the expense of, and to the detriment of, the 

internal, the only real       and true.    219 H. Jennings, _op. cit._, pp. 37, 38.    220 See _Isis 

Unveiled_, ii. 574.    221 xi. 26.    222 Art., by Dr. A. Wilder, in _Evolution_.    223 _Op. cit._, p. 

262.    224 In its most extensive meaning, the Sanskrit word has the same       literal sense as the 

Greek term; both imply "revelation," by no       human agent, but through the "receiving of the 

sacred drink." In       India the initiated received the "Soma," sacred drink, which  "And do you 

think," asked Groslow, "that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard?"  "No, to be sure," replied 

D'Artagnan; "unless, forsooth, the sky rains friends upon him."  Groslow's face brightened.  It is 

impossible to say whether Charles, who kept his eyes constantly closed, had noticed the insolence 

of the Puritan captain, but the moment he heard the clear tone of D'Artagnan's voice his eyelids 

rose, in spite of himself.  Parry, too, started and stopped reading.  "What are you thinking about?" 

said the king; "go on, my good Parry, unless you are tired."  Parry resumed his reading.  On a 

table in the next room were lighted candles, cards, two dice-boxes, and dice.

to liberate his soul from the body; and in the Eleusinian Mysteries       it was the sacred drink 

offered at the Epopteia. The Grecian       Mysteries are wholly derived from the Brahmanical Vaidic 

rites, and       the latter from the Ante-Vaidic religious Mysteries--primitive Wisdom       Philosophy. 

225 It is needless to state that the _Gospel according to John_ was not       written by John, but by 

a Platonist or a Gnostic facing Stuart, whom I like so much to see, especially where he now is, and 

you, Monsieur d'Artagnan, opposite to me."  Athos turned red with rage. D'Artagnan frowned at 

him.  "That's it," said D'Artagnan; "you, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, to the right of Monsieur 

Groslow. You, Chevalier d'Herblay, to his left. Du Vallon next me. You'll bet for me and those 

gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow."  By this arrangement D'Artagnan could nudge Porthos

Neoplatonic school.    226 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._ The fact that Peter persecuted the "Apostle to       the 

Gentiles" under that name, does not necessarily imply that there       was no Simon Magus 

individually distinct from Paul. It may have       become a generic name of abuse. Theodoret and 

Chrysostom, the       earliest and most prolific commentators on the Gnosticism of those       days, 

seem actually to make of Simon a rival of Paul and to state       that between them passed 

frequent messages. The former, as a       diligent propagandist of what Paul terms the "antithesis 

of the    make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis.  At the names Comte de la Fere and 

Chevalier d'Herblay, Charles opened his eyes, and raising his noble head, in spite of himself, 

threw a glance at all the actors in the scene.  At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of 

his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah:  "God said, 'Hear ye the words of the 

prophets my servants, whom I have sent unto you.'"  The four friends exchanged glances. The 

words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was 

assigned to its real motive.
