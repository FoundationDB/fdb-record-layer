t, especially in the=20

second part of the book, had the errors of free-thinkers--Spinoza and Simon=
--before his mind.  The=20

seventeenth century had not contributed largely to historical literature, s=
ave in the form of=20

memoirs. Mezeray, in the first half of the century, Fleury, in the second, =
cannot be ranked among=20

those writers who illuminate with profound and just ideas. The Cartesian ph=
ilosophy viewed=20

historical studies with haughty indifference. Bossuet's _Discours_ is a vin=
dication of the ways of=20

God in history, a theology of human progress. He would exhibit the nations =
and generations of=20

human-kind bound each to each under the Providential government. The life o=
f humanity, from=20

Adam to Charlemagne, is mapped into epochs, ages, periods--the periods of n=
ature, of the law,=20

and of grace. In religion is found the unity of human history. By religion =
is meant Judaism and=20

Christianity; by Christianity is meant the Catholicism of Rome.  Having exp=
ounded the Divine=20

policy in the government of the world, Bossuet is free to study those secon=
dary causes which have=20

determined the rise and fall of empires. With magisterial authority, and wi=
