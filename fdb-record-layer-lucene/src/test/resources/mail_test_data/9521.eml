through the body and lacerated, as though they were assaulting so       many lambs herded in their 

sheepfold.  5.5. They made bets as to who would slit a man in two, or cut off his       head at one 

blow: or they opened up his bowels.  They tore the babes       from their mothers' breast by the 

feet, and dashed their heads       against the rocks.  Others they seized by the shoulders and 

threw       into the rivers, laughing and joking, and when they fell into the       water they exclaimed: 

"boil body of so and so!"  They spitted the       bodies of other babes, together with their mothers 

and all who were       before them, on their swords.  6.6. They made a gallows just high enough for 

the feet to nearly touch       the ground, and by thirteens, in honour and reverence of our 

Redeemer and the twelve Apostles, they put wood underneath and, with       fire, they burned the 

Indians alive.  7.7. They wrapped the bodies of others entirely in dry straw, binding       them in it 

and setting fire to it; and so they burned them.  They       cut off the hands of all they wished to 

take alive, made them carry       them fastened on to them, and said: "Go and carry letters": that is; 

take the news to those who have fled to the mountains.  8.8. They generally killed the lords and 

nobles in the following way.       They made wooden gridirons of stakes, bound them upon them, 

and made       a slow fire beneath: thus the victims gave up the spirit by degrees,       emitting cries 

of despair in their torture.  9.9. I once saw that they had four or five of the chief lords stretched 

on the gridirons to burn them, and I think also there were two or       three pairs of gridirons, where 

they were burning others; and       because they cried aloud and annoyed the captain or prevented 

him       sleeping, he commanded that they should strangle them: the officer       who was burning 

them was worse than a hangman and did not wish to       suffocate them, but with his own hands 

he gagged them, so that they       should not make themselves heard, and he stirred up the fire, 

until       they roasted slowly, according to his pleasure.  I know his name,       and knew also his 

relations in Seville. I saw all the above things       and numberless others. 9.10. And because all 

the people who could flee, hid among the mountains       and climbed the crags to escape from 

men so deprived of humanity, so       wicked, such wild beasts, exterminators and capital enemies 

of all       the human race, the Spaniards taught and trained the fiercest       boar-hounds to tear an 

Indian to pieces as soon as they saw him, so       that they more willingly attacked and ate one, 

than if he had been a       boar.  These hounds made great havoc and slaughter. 10.11. And 

because sometimes, though rarely, the Indians killed a few       Christians for just cause, they 

made a law among themselves, that       for one Christian whom the Indians killed, the Christians 

should       kill a hundred Indians.                        The Kingdoms that were in Hispaniola      1. There 

were five very large and principal kingdoms in this island of       Hispaniola, and five very mighty 

kings, whom all the other       numberless lords obeyed, although some of the lords of certain 

separate provinces did not recognise any of them as superior.  One       kingdom was called 

Magua, with the last syllable accented, which       means the kingdom of the plain.        This plain is 

one of the most notable and marvellous things in the       world, for it stretches eighty leagues from 

the sea on the south to       that on the north.  Its width is five leagues, attaining to eight       and 

ten, and it has very high mountains on both sides.   2.2. More than thirty thousand rivers, and 

brooks water it among which       there are twelve as large as the Ebro, the Duero, and the 

Guadalquivir.  And all the rivers that flow from the western       mountain, which number twenty or 

twenty-five thousand, are very rich       in gold.  On that mountain (or mountains) lies the province 

of       Cibao, from which the mines of Cibao are named, whence comes that       famous gold, 



superior in carat, which is held in great esteem here.  3.3. The king, and lord of this realm was 

called Guarionex.  He had such       great lords as his vassals, that one alone of them mustered 

sixteen       thousand warriors to serve come is that there was no such apprenticeship. Foreign 

refugees made the clock-cases or they were imported from Holland.  [Illustration: LONG-CASE

[Illustration: LONG-CASE CLOCK.  Decorated in marquetry in the "all-over" style.  (_By courtesy

a crime for the craftsman to assimilate the best of all the great artists who have preceded him. 

This was the insanity of _L'Art Nouveau_. It wanted to commence again at elementary principles 

and to use poor forms that had long been discarded by great artificers. It wished us deliberately to 

ignore the past. An anvil has arrived by a process of evolution through long centuries of metal-

workers, since man first smelted ore and fashioned metal, to its present form. It would be idle to 

equip the blacksmith with a square anvil.  From China to Japan, from India to Armenia, from 

Bagdad to Cairo, from Alexandria to Venice, from Canton to Goa and thence to Lisbon, backwards 

and forwards across the world's trade routes art impulses have throbbed to the tune of the 

monsoons. Pulsating with life, they carried, and still carry, Eastern ideas to the West, and Western 

inventions to the East. Behind modernity and man's latest devices somnolently lies the great dead 

past--China and the Far East, Persia and Babylon, Egypt and Greece and Rome. Aztec gods and 

Ashanti gold ornaments, Peruvian Inca clay vessels and Malayan idols, surprise and bewilder the 

ethnologist with the similarity of rudimentary forms or with the marvellously pure ornament that 

comes out of the so-conceived dark corners of the earth to suggest older civilizations as artistic as 

those of the modern world.  =Le Style Refugie.=--The history of art is not hidden. Holbein and 

Hollar and Vandyck, Lely and Kneller worked in this country. The number of foreign artists and 

artist-craftsmen working in this country as acclimatized or as "naturalized" was stupendous. The 

beautiful swags and delicately carved woodwork embellishing so many English houses and 

proudly held as heirlooms are by a Dutchman's hand--Grinling Gibbons. The list could be 

extended. It is natural that the gold of England should have a hypnotic attraction to artistic 

temperaments. It is the law of supply and demand. Like bananas and pineapples, oranges and 

dates, foreign talent comes to a great emporium.  The _style refugie_ was something definite. It 

was a term employed in Holland just at the time when a similar immigration was occurring in this 

country. The French Protestant refugees fleeing from the insane fury of Roman Catholic bigots 

naturally fled to Protestant countries--to England, to Holland, and to Germany. It is admitted on the 

Continent that these highly skilled artist craftsmen had an influence on the art of the country of 

their adoption. It is acknowledged as _le style refugie_. In England, writers on furniture have half-

heartedly alluded to this influence, but it was very real. Daniel Marot, a descendant from an 

eminent family of French artists, a pupil of Lepautre, formerly at the Gobelins factory, and one of 

the creators of the Louis Quatorze style, took refuge in Holland, where William of Orange 

appointed him as Minister of Works. From The Hague he followed his patron to England at the 

"Glorious Revolution." It was his genius in design that made our William and Mary and Queen 

Anne styles. At Hampton Court his personality predominates. Sir Christopher Wren occupied 

himself with the architecture, but the decorations are by Daniel Marot. Marot died in 1718. He 



stands in the forefront of the exponents of _le style refugie_, and behind him are hundreds of his 

compatriots. It is idle to ignore this influence.  Chippendale owed more than most people imagine 

to Marot. _Le style chinois_ is to be found, so to speak, in embryo, in Marot's design books, and 

suggestions of it appear in some of his executed work.  The un-English marquetry became 

acclimatized, and later, as we shall show, the equally un-English lac became a fashion. 

=Derivative Nature of Marquetry Clock-cases.=--The laying of marquetry as a craft is one thing, 

the conception of marquetry as a creative art is another. We may admire the dexterity of the inlay 

but 


_
king Guarionex was very obedient, virtuous and, by nature, peaceful       and devoted to the king of 

Castile.  And in certain years, every       householder amongst his people gave by his orders, a bell 

full of       gold; and afterwards, because they could not fill it, they cut it in       two and design. At 

the Mortlake tapestry works Vandyck and Rubens made drawings for the craftsmen. In England, 

whenever the craftsman has been allied with the artist he has produced great results; whenever 

he has run alone he has rapidly run downhill. Josiah Wedgwood had on the one side Bentley the 

classical 


_
ability to collect, or dig the gold from the mines.  4.4. This prince offered to serve the King of 

Castile, by having as much       land cultivated as would extend from Isabella, which was the first 

habitation of the Christians to the town of San Domingo, which is a       good fifty leagues, in order 

that gold should not be asked of him;       because he said, and with truth, that his vassals knew 

not how to       collect it.  I know he was able to do the cultivation he proposed to   and modeller 

with a perfect continental training. Chippendale, great craftsman that he was, would have been 

better advised to prune his Chinese taste and discard his worthless Gothic style. An artistic brain 

behind him would have saved him from such atrocities. Sheraton, more the artist than the 

craftsman, made no such blunders.  Evidently the making of clock-cases became an industry. 

Personally we incline to the belief that seventy-five per cent. of them were of foreign manufacture, 

either in 


_
than three million crowns yearly, and, owing to this cultivation,       there would have been at the 

present time in this island fifty towns       as large as Seville.  5.5. The payment they awarded to 

this great and good king and lord, was       to dishonour him; a captain, a bad Christian violating 

his wife.       Although he might have bided his time to Dutch immigrants or French refugees in this 

country. The derivative nature of their design tells its own story. It has nothing English about it. 

Take the early geometric star pattern or the early coloured birds and flowers, what else are they 

but Dutch? Is there anything in English art like them? The conclusion to which one must arrive is 

that the marquetry 


_
revenge himself, he determined to depart alone, and to hide himself       and die exiled from his 

kingdom and state, in a province called       Ciguay, of which the ruler was his vassal.  6.6. When 

the Christians became aware that he was missing, he could not       hide himself from them.  They 

made war on that ruler who sheltered       him, where, after great slaughter, they found and 

captured him.       When he was derivative character runs through the whole gamut from the 

reticent and well-balanced panel period to the "all over" phase, when every inch was covered with 

marquetry, to the arabesque and intricate mosaic work reminiscent of Persia, and finally to the 

decadent period when Eastern carpets found themselves reproduced in marquetry on the clock-

case.  [Illustration: WILLIAM AND MARY CHEST OF DRAWERS.  On original stand.
