how much Joe had sacrificed. But all that finer side of him, that early lif=
e, those dreams, those=20

friends, had all been known to Amy. And Amy had been willing to lose them a=
ll, to crush them out,=20

for money, only money, and money for such an empty life! Ethel shivered a l=
ittle. Her sister's=20

picture was complete.  "No," she said, looking up at Nourse, "I'm not going=
 to leave you alone.=20

What I've got to do now is to try my best to make you feel what I really wa=
nt, and what a mistake=20

you've been making. Please listen, while I try to be clear." Her expression=
 was strained as she=20

looked at him. She smiled a little. "I am not like my sister. I'd rather no=

She--had her good points, too--she's dead. And all you need to know is this=
. You were wrong=20

about me in those first months--I was trying to get away from Joe. I had my=
 own dreams and I=20

wished to be free. I even tried to earn my living. I worked for a while. Bu=
t the man I worked for--

frightened me--and that threw me back on Joe. He was poor then, so I nursed=
 his child and ran his=20

home on very little. And I liked that. Believe me--please! I liked that! An=
d I think the main reason=20

for it was that I was falling in love, not with her husband but with the ma=
n whom you were bringing=20

back to life. It was that in him, that kind of ambition and that kind of li=

New York. And=20

meanwhile we were married, and about that part of it you were right. I was =
selfish, I did want him=20

all. I let everything go, kept everything out--especially his business. I w=
as jealous of you as I was=20

of his wife--of everything past--I wanted him new!  "Then my baby came, and=
 it was a time when I=20

did a good deal of thinking. I--thought out my sister. I saw how different =
we were. What she=20

wanted I didn't want at all. So I set to work to change him--and I thought =

f each other--against=20

each other. I was against you in his office, you were against me in his hom=
e. And because you=20

hadn't any idea of what I was trying, you made him work for money for me--t=
o buy me off! But I=20

don't want money--alone, I mean! And when he came and said he was rich, it =
frightened me--I=20

wasn't ready--I had no friends! And so the money only brought back my siste=
r's friends in a perfect=20

horde--and with them her memory--her influence--her husband!  "Oh, can't yo=
u understand what I=20

mean--and how I'm placed and what it's like? Can't you believe that I want =
in him exactly what you=20

want yourself? But it hasn't been easy! Don't you see? I am only a second w=
ife! She's here--she=20

has been--all the time--like a ghost--and we never speak her name! But if y=
ou will only work with=20

s acting in=20

combination, shall, if such diploma appear to the privy council or general =
council to deserve=20

recognition in the medical register, be entitled on the payment of such fee=

ing there rigid, she heard him=20

continue in gruff low tones, "Something I'd forgotten--a point in those Tag=
gert specifications. I want=20

to clear it up tonight."    CHAPTER XVII  What impression had she made? How=
 far had she=20

overcome the heavy weight of dislike and suspicion Amy had rolled up in his=
 mind? As Ethel's=20

thoughts went rapidly back over the things Nourse had told her, again and a=
gain with excitement=20

she felt what a help he could be if he would. Here lay the gate to her husb=
and's youth.  "If only he'll=20

believe in me! Shall I send for him? No," she decided. "If there's any hope=
, he'll come again."  She=20

waited three days. Then he telephoned, "Can I see you today  (1) Any copy p=
