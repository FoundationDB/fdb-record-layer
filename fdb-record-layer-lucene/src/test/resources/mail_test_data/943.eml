cular flesh, pretty good aliment; but the electric organ fills the greater =
_
instead of continually brooding over the past. The immense, terrible pathos=
 of the situation=20

appealed to the deepest chords in her nature. Her father was still in the p=
rime of his years, a=20

handsome, clever man, who might have done much in the world. Was it yet too=
 late? Lorna=20

sometimes had faint, budding hopes that in some fresh country his wrecked c=
areer might be=20

righted, and that he might make a new start and rise triumphant over the ru=
in of other days. He=20

was glad to see her. There was no doubt about that. The knowledge that she =
now shared his=20

secret placed her on a different footing. It was a relief to him to have so=
me one in whom he could=20

confide, some one who knew the reason for his hermit mode of living, and ab=
ove all who believed=20

in his innocence. Insensibly Lorna's presence acted upon him for good. The =
nervous, hunted look=20

began to fade out of his eyes, and sometimes he actually smiled as she reco=
unted the doings of=20

the Camellia Buds, or other happenings at school.  "Daddy!" she said once, =
"couldn't we go out to=20

Australia or America, or somewhere where nobody would know us, and make a f=
resh life for=20

ourselves?"  A gleam of hope flitted for a moment over the sad face.  "I've=
 thought of that, Lorna.=20

Perhaps I've been too morbid. It seemed to me that every Englishman must kn=
ow of what I had=20

been accused. And I had no credentials to offer. Now, with a five years' re=
ference from the Ferroni=20

Company in Naples I might have a chance of a job in Australia. It's worth c=
onsidering--for your=20

sake, child, if not for mine."  During the whole of the first week of the h=
olidays Lorna amused=20

herself as best she might in their little lodgings in Naples. While her fat=
her was at the office she=20

read or sewed, or played on a wretched old piano, which had little tune in =
it but was better than=20

nothing. The evenings were her golden times, for then they would go out tog=
ether, sometimes into=20

the Italian quarters of the city, or sometimes by tram into the suburbs, wh=
ere there were beautiful=20

promenades with views of the sea. In these walks she grew to be his compani=
on, and instead of=20

shrinking from him as in former days, she met him on a new footing and gave=
 him of her best.=20

Together they planned a home in a fresh hemisphere, and talked hopefully of=
 better things that=20

were perhaps in store for them over the ocean. And so life went on, and fat=
her and daughter might=20

have realized their vision, and have emigrated to another continent where n=
o one knew their name=20

or their former history, and have made a fresh start and won comparative su=
ccess, but Dame=20

Fortune, who sometimes has a use for our past however bitterly she seems to=
 have mismanaged=20

it, interfered again, and with fateful fingers re-flung the dice.  It certa=
inly did not seem a fortunate=20

circumstance, but quite the reverse, when the grandchildren of their landla=
dy, who occupied the=20

_etage_ above their rooms, sickened with measles. Lorna had never had the c=
omplaint, and it=20

was, of course, most important that she should not convey germs back to the=
 Villa Camellia, so it=20

was a vital necessity to move her immediately out of the area of infection.=
 Signora Fiorenza,=20

harassed but sympathetic, suggested a visit to Capri, where her sister, Sig=
nora Verdi, who owned=20

a little orange farm and had a couple of spare bedrooms, would probably tak=
e her in for the=20

remainder of the holidays, which would give the necessary quarantine before=
 returning to the=20

school.  Mr. Carson jumped at the opportunity, and Lorna was told to pack h=
er bag.  "But Daddy,=20

Daddy!" she remonstrated. "I don't want to leave you. Just when we're happy=
 together must I run=20

away? Do measles matter? I'd rather have them and stay here. I would indeed=
."  "Don't be silly,=20

Lorna. Miss Rodgers wouldn't thank you to start an epidemic. Of course you =
must go to Capri. It's=20

a splendid opportunity. Signora Verdi has a nice little villa. Cheer up, ch=
ild. I'll tell you what I'll do.=20

I'll take you myself to-morrow, stay over Sunday, and come again and spend =
the next week-end=20



with you. I can get an extra day or two of holiday if I want, and the Casa =
Verdi is a quiet spot, quite=20

out of the way of tourists. We can have the orange groves to ourselves and =
see nobody. If I catch=20

the early boat I'm not likely to be troubled with English trippers; that's =
one good business."=20

"Daddy! You darling! Oh, that would be glorious! I'd go to the North Pole i=
f you'd come too. Two=20

week-ends with you in Capri! What fun. We'll have the time of our lives!"  =
To poor Lorna, who so=20

seldom had the opportunity of enjoying family outings, this visit indeed wa=
s an event. She packed=20

her bag joyously, and was all excitement to start.  Following his usual cus=
tom of avoiding the=20

vicinity of English people, Mr. Carson decided not to go to Capri by the or=
dinary steamer that=20

conveyed pleasure-seekers, but to secure passages in a cargo vessel which w=
as crossing with=20

supplies. To Lorna the mode of conveyance was immaterial; she would have sa=
iled cheerfully on a=20

raft if necessary. She rather enjoyed the picturesque Neapolitan tramp stea=
mer with its cargo of=20

wine barrels and packing cases, and its crew of bare-footed, red-capped sea=
men, talking and=20

gesticulating with all the excitability of their Southern These effects are=
, however, dependent on=20

three variable circumstances; the energy of the electromotive apparatus, th=
e conductibility of the=20

medium, and the irritability of the organs which receive the impressions: i=
t is because experiments=20

have not been sufficiently multiplied with a view to these three variable e=
lements, that, in the=20

action of electric eels and torpedos, accidental circumstances have been ta=
ken for absolute=20

conditions, without which the electric shocks are not felt.  In wounded gym=
noti, which give feeble=20

but very equal shocks, these shocks appeared to us constantly stronger on t=
ouching the body of=20

the fish with a hand armed with metal, than with the naked hand. They are s=
tronger also, when,=20

instead of touching the fish with one hand, naked, or armed with metal, we =
press it at once with=20

both hands, either naked or armed. These differences become sensible only w=
hen one has=20

gymnoti enough at disposal to be able to choose the weakest; and when the e=
xtreme equality of=20

the electric discharges admits of distinguishing between the sensations fel=
t alternately by the hand=20

naked or armed with a metal, by one or both hands naked, and by one or both=
 hands armed with=20

metal. It is also in the case only of small shocks, feeble and uniform, tha=
t they are more sensible=20

on touching the gymnotus with one hand (without forming a chain) with zinc,=
 than with copper or=20

iron.  Resinous substances, glass, very dry wood, horn, and even bones, whi=
ch are generally=20

believed to be good conductors, prevent the action of the gymnoti from bein=
g transmitted to man. I=20

was surprised at not feeling the least shock on pressing wet sticks of seal=
ing-wax against the=20

organs of the fish, while the same animal gave me the most violent strokes,=
 when excited by=20

means of a metallic rod. M. Bonpland received shocks, when carrying a gymno=
tus on two cords of=20

the fibres of the palm-tree, which appeared to us extremely dry. A strong d=
ischarge makes its way=20

through very imperfect conductors. Perhaps also the obstacle which the cond=
uctor presents=20

renders the discharge more painful. I touched the gymnotus with a wet pot o=
f brown clay, without=20

effect; yet I received violent shocks when I carried the gymnotus in the sa=
me pot, because the=20

contact was greater.  When two persons, insulated or otherwise, hold each o=
ther's hands, and=20

only one of these persons touches the fish with the hand, either naked or a=
rmed with metal, the=20

shock is most commonly felt by both at once. However, it sometimes happens =
that, in the most=20

severe shocks, the person who comes into immediate contact with the fish al=
one feels them.=20

When the gymnotus is exhausted, or in a very reduced state of excitability,=
 and will no longer emit=20

strokes on being irritated with one hand, the shocks are felt in a very viv=
id manner, on forming the=20



chain, and employing both hands. Even then, however, the electric shock tak=
es place only at the=20

will of the animal. Two persons, one of whom holds the tail, and the other =
the head, cannot, by=20

joining hands and forming a chain, force the gymnotus to dart his stroke.  =
Though employing the=20

most delicate electrometers in various ways, insulating them on a plate of =
glass, and receiving=20

very strong shocks which passed through the electrometer, I could never dis=
cover any=20

phenomenon of attraction or repulsion. The same observation was made by M. =
Fahlberg at=20

Stockholm. That philosopher, however, has seen an electric spark, as Walsh =
and Ingenhousz had=20

before him, in London, by placing the gymnotus in the air, and interrupting=
 the conducting chain by=20

two gold leaves pasted upon glass, and a line distant from each other. No p=
erson, on the contrary,=20

has ever perceived a spark issue from the body of the fish itself. We irrit=
ated it for a long time=20

during the night, at Calabozo, in perfect darkness, without observing any l=
uminous appearance.=20

Having placed four gymnoti, of unequal strength, in such a manner as to rec=
eive the shocks of the=20

most vigorous fish by contact, that is to say, by touching only one of the =
other fishes, I did not=20

observe that these last were agitated at the moment when the current passed=
 their bodies.=20

Perhaps the current did not penetrate below the humid surface of the skin. =
We will not, however,=20

conclude from this, that the gymnoti are insensible to electricity; and tha=
t they cannot fight with=20

each other at the bottom of the pools. Their nervous system must be subject=
 to the same agents=20

as the nerves of other animals. I have indeed seen, that, on laying open th=
eir nerves, they undergo=20

muscular contractions at the mere contact of two opposite metals; and M. Fa=
hlberg, of Stockholm,=20

found that his gymnotus was convulsively agitated when placed in a copper v=
essel, and feeble=20

discharges from a Leyden jar passed through its skin.  After the experiment=
s I had made on=20

gymnoti, it became highly interesting to me, on my return to Europe, to asc=
ertain with precision the=20

various circumstances in which another electric fish, the torpedo of our se=
as, gives or does not=20

give shocks. Though this fish had been examined by numerous men of science,=
 I found all that=20

had been published on its electrical effects extremely vague. It has been v=
ery arbitrarily supposed,=20

that this fish acts like a Leyden=20


_
than that to Fossato, and she sat in a cozy nook among the casks, and watch=
ed first the white=20

houses of Naples fading away, then the distant mountains of the coast, then=
 the gay sails of the=20

fishing craft that plied to and fro over the water.  It was sunset when the=
y reached the beautiful=20

island of Capri, a pink ethereal sunset that flooded headland and rock, ora=
nge orchard and=20

vineyard, in a faint and luminous opal glow. Their vessel anchored outside =
the quay of the Marina=20

Grande, and signaled for a boat to take them off. A little skiff put out fr=
om the beach, and into this=20

they and their luggage were transferred. The transparent crystal water over=
 which they rowed was=20

clear as an aquarium, and alive with gorgeous medusae whose pink tentacles =
seemed to flash=20

with the colors of the sunset; to gaze down at them was like watching a flo=
ck of sea-butterflies=20

flitting across a background of undulating green.  They landed at the jetty=
, walked to the shore,=20

and after securing a carriage started on a long drive uphill to the _terren=
o_ of Signora Verdi. Capri,=20

betwixt the glow of the fading sunset and the light of the rising full moon=
, was a veritable land of=20

romance, with its domed eastern-looking houses set in a mass of vines and l=
emon trees, and the=20

luscious scent of its many flowers wafted on the evening air. It seemed no =
less attractive in the=20

morning, when, after drinking their coffee in a rose-covered arbor that sto=
od at the bottom of their=20

landlady's orange grove, they wandered away through the _bosco_ and up on t=
o the open hillside.=20

Here Flora had surely played be discharged at will, by touching it with bot=
h hands; and this=20

supposition appears to have led into error observers who have devoted thems=
elves to researches=20

of this kind. M. Gay-Lussac and myself, during our journey to Italy, made a=
 great number of=20

experiments on torpedos taken in the gulf of Naples. These experiments furn=
ish many results=20

somewhat different from those I collected on the gymnoti. It is probable th=
at the cause of these=20

anomalies is owing rather to the inequality of electric power in the two fi=
shes, than to the different=20

disposition of their organs.  Though the power of the torpedo cannot be com=
pared with that of the=20

gymnotus, it is sufficient to cause very painful sensations. A person accus=
tomed to electric shocks=20

can with difficulty hold in his hands a torpedo of twelve or fourteen inche=
s, and in possession of all=20

its vigour. When the torpedo gives only very feeble strokes under water, th=
ey become more=20

sensible if the animal be raised above the surface. I have often observed t=
he same phenomenon=20

in experimenting on frogs.  The torpedo moves the pectoral fins convulsivel=
y every time it emits a=20

stroke; and this stroke is more or less painful, according as the immediate=
 contact takes place by a=20

greater or less surface. We observed that the gymnotus gives the strongest =
shocks without=20

making any movement with the eyes, head, or fins.* (* The anal fin of the g=
ymnoti only has a=20

sensible motion when these fishes are excited under the belly, where the el=
ectric organ is placed.)=20

Is this difference caused by the position of the electric organ, which is n=
ot=20


_
against the intense sapphire blue of a Capri sea, and she must have emptied=
 her apron all at once=20

to have spangled the rough grass with cistus, anemone, and starry asphodel.=
 Below them lay a=20

stretch of rugged rocks and turquoise bay, with no sound to break the silen=
ce but the tinkling of=20

goat-bells, or the piping of a little dark-eyed boy who practiced a rustic =
flute as he minded his flock.=20

To poor Mr. Carson, wearied with the noise and clamor of Naples, it was a v=
eritable Paradise, a=20

haven of refuge, a breathing space in the dreary pilgrimage of his sad life=
. On the top of this sunlit,=20

rock-crowned islet he gained a short period of peace and rest before he onc=
e more shouldered his=20

heavy burden.  "If I could live all my days here, Lorna, who knows, I might=
 learn to forget," he said=20

wistfully.  "Oh, Dad! We must find a way out somehow. You can't go on like =
this! It's killing you.=20

Why have we to suffer under this unjust accusation? Why should some one els=
e do a shameful=20

deed and shift the blame on to you? Is there no plan by which you could cle=
ar your name?"  "I've=20

asked myself that question, Lorna, through many black hours, but I've never=
 hit on an answer."  "I=20

hate the man who's wronged you," she sobbed passionately. "Yes! the gymnoti=
? or does the=20

movement of the pectoral fins of the torpedo directly prove that the fish r=
estores the electrical=20

equilibrium by its own skin, discharges itself by its own body, and that we=
 generally feel only the=20

effect of a lateral shock?  We cannot discharge at will either a torpedo or=
 a gymnotus, as we=20

discharge at will a Leyden jar or a Voltaic battery. A shock is not always =
felt, even on touching the=20

electric fish with both hands. We must irritate it to make it give the shoc=
k. This action in the=20

torpedos, as well as in the gymnoti, is a vital action; it depends on the w=
ill only of the animal, which=20

perhaps does not always keep its electric organs charged, or does not alway=
s employ the action of=20

its nerves to establish the chain between the positive and negative poles. =
It is certain that the=20

torpedo gives a long series of shocks with astonishing celerity; whether it=
 is that the plates or=20

laminae of its organs are not wholly exhausted, or that the fish recharges =
them instantaneously.=20

The electric stroke is felt, when the animal is disposed to give it, whethe=
r we touch with a single=20

finger only one of the surfaces of the organs, or apply both hands to the t=
wo surfaces, the superior=20

and inferior, at once. In=20


_
hate him--hate him--hate him--and all belonging to him. Is it wicked to hat=
e? I can't help it when it's=20

my own father's honor that's at stake. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, if I could only 'g=
et even' I'd be content. It=20

seems so hard to let the wicked prosper and just do nothing. Why should som=
e people have all the=20

laughter of life and others all the tears?"  Lorna parted reluctantly from =
her father on Monday=20

morning. He sailed by a very early boat, so that the sun had not yet risen =
high, as, after watching=20

his vessel leave the harbor, she turned from the Marina to walk back to the=
 Casa Verdi. Half of the=20

little town was still asleep. There were no signs of life in the hotel, whe=
re the wistaria was=20

blooming in a purple shower over the veranda, and green shutters barred the=
 lower windows of=20

most of the villas. A few peasant people were stirring about; three dark-ey=
ed girls, as straight as=20

Greek goddesses, were coming down the steep path from Anacapri with orange =
baskets on their=20

heads, and their hands full of posies of pink cyclamen; a mother with a chi=
ld clinging to her yellow-

bordered skirt was taking an earthenware pitcher to the well for water; a p=
ersistent bell in the little=20

church of S. Costanzo was calling some to prayers, and others were starting=
 the ordinary routine=20

of the day, attending to animals, cutting salads in their gardens, spreadin=
g out fishing-nets, or=20

getting ready the hand barrows on which they sold their wares. In the gleam=
ing morning light the=20

beautiful island seemed more than ever like a radiant jewel set in a sapphi=
re sea. Lorna had left=20

the winding highroad, and was taking a short cut up flights of steep steps =
between the flowery=20

gardens of villas, where geraniums grew like weeds, and every bush seemed a=
 mass of scented=20

blossoms. She was passing a small flat-topped eastern house, whose gatepost=
 bore the attractive=20

title of "La Carina," when she suddenly heard her own name called, and turn=
ing round, startled=20

and surprised, what should she see peeping over the cactus hedge but the sm=
iling face and=20

blonde bobbed locks of Irene. The amazement was mutual.  "Hello! What are y=
ou doing in Capri?"=20

"What are _you_ doing here?"  "I'm staying up on the hill!"  "And we're sta=
ying at this villa!"  "To=20

think of meeting you!"  "Sporting, isn't it? Come inside the garden! I can'=
t talk to you down there in=20

the road."  That her chum should actually also have come to Capri for the h=
olidays seemed a=20

marvelous piece of luck to Lorna.  "We decided quite in a hurry," explained=
 Irene. "Dad heard this=20

little place was to let furnished, and took it for three weeks. The Cameron=
s have taken that big=20

pink house over there, with the umbrella pine in the garden. Peachy is stay=
ing with them. Isn't it=20

absolutely ripping? I was only saying yesterday I wished you were here too.=
 And my cousin=20

Marjorie Anderson and her friends are stopping at the hotel, just down belo=
w. We're having the=20

most glorious times all together. Here's Vincent! Vin, you remember meeting=
 Lorna at school?=20

She's actually staying in Capri! No, don't go, Lorna! Sit down and talk! No=
w I've found you I mean=20

to keep you. We're not generally up so early, but Dad wants to catch the fi=
rst steamer. He has to=20

get back to Naples this morning."  "My father has gone already by a sailing=
 vessel."  "Then you are=20

alone? Oh, I say! You must spend most of your time with us. It's a lucky ch=
ance that has blown=20

you our way, isn't it? We seem quite a cluster of Camellia Buds in Capri." =
 So Lorna, who had=20

expected a very quiet, not to say dull, visit at the Casa Verdi during her =
father's absence, found=20

herself instead in the midst of hospitable friends who extended cordial inv=
itations to her for every=20

occasion.  "By all means let your friend join us," agreed Mrs. Beverley, in=
 answer to her daughter's=20

urgent request. "We've heard so much about Lorna in your letters. She seems=
 a nice girl. I=20

remember I was quite struck with her when I saw her at your school carnival=
. One more or less=20

makes no difference for picnics. It must certainly be slow for her up there=
 with only an Italian=20



landlady to talk to, poor child."  Capri was an idyllic place for holiday-m=
aking. The beautiful=20

climate, perfect at this season of the year, made living out of doors a del=
ight. Every day the=20

various friends met together, and either went for excursions or passed happ=
y hours in each other's=20

gardens. The Camerons had several young people staying with them as well as=
 Peachy, and the=20

party at the hotel proved a great acquisition. This consisted of Captain Hi=
lton Preston and his=20

sister Joyce, their married sister Kathleen and her husband, Mr. Frank Rope=
r, and Marjorie=20

Anderson, who was traveling under their chaperonage. They were fond of the =
sea, and had at=20

once made arrangements to hire a boat and a boatman for their visit, so tha=
t they might have as=20

much pleasure as possible on the water during their short stay.  "We shan't=
 be able to paddle=20

about on the Mediterranean when we get home," said Captain Preston with moc=
k tragedy. "My=20

leave will soon be up and I shall be off to India again. It's a case of 'Le=
t's enjoy while the season=20

invites us.' These rocks and bays and coves are simply magnificent. We've d=
ecided to go to the=20

Blue Grotto to-day. Who cares to join us?"  This was an expedition the pers=
on who touches the=20

fish with one finger or both hands be insulated or not. All that has been s=
aid on the necessity of a=20

communication with the damp ground to establish a circuit, is founded on in=
accurate observations.=20

M. Gay-Lussac made the important observation that when an insulated person =
touches the=20

torpedo with one finger, it is indispensible that the contact be direct. Th=
e fish may with impunity be=20

touched with a key, or any other metallic instrument; no shock is felt when=
 a conducting or non-

conducting body is interposed between the finger and the electrical organ o=
f the torpedo. This=20

circumstance proves a great difference between the torpedo and the gymnotus=
, the latter giving=20

his strokes through an iron rod several feet long.  When the torpedo is pla=
ced on a metallic plate of=20

very little thickness, so that the plate touches the inferior surface of th=
e organs, the hand that=20

supports the plate never feels any shock, though another insulated person m=
ay excite the animal,=20

and the convulsive movement of the pectoral fins may denote the strongest a=
nd most reiterated=20

discharges.  If, on the contrary, a person support the torpedo placed upon =
a metallic plate, with the=20

left hand, as in the foregoing experiment, and the same person touch the su=
perior surface of the=20

electrical organ with the right hand, a strong shock is then felt in both a=
rms. The sensation is the=20

same when the fish is placed between two metallic plates, the edges of whic=
h do not touch, and=20

the person applies both hands at once to these plates. The interposition of=
 one metallic plate=20

prevents the communication if that plate be touched with one hand only, whi=
le the interposition of=20

two metallic plates does not prevent the shock when both hands are applied.=
 In the latter case it=20

cannot be doubted that the circulation of the fluid is established by the t=
wo arms.  If, in this=20

situation of the fish between two plates, there exist any immediate communi=
cation between the=20

edges of these two plates, no shock takes place. The chain between the two =
surfaces of the=20

electric organ is then formed by the plates, and the new communication, est=
ablished by the=20

contact of the two hands with the two plates, remains without effect. We ca=
rried the torpedo with=20

impunity between two plates of metal, and felt the strokes it gave only at =
the instant when they=20

ceased to touch each other at the edges.  Nothing in the torpedo or in the =
gymnotus indicates that=20

the animal modifies the electrical state of the bodies by which it is surro=
unded. The most delicate=20

electrometer is no way affected in whatever manner it is employed, whether =
bringing it near the=20

organs or insulating the fish, covering it with a metallic plate, and causi=
ng the plate to=20

communicate by a conducting wire with the condenser of Volta. We were at gr=
eat pains to vary the=20



experiments by which we sought to render the electrical tension of the torp=
edo sensible; but they=20

were constantly without effect, and perfectly confirmed what M. Bonpland an=
d myself had=20

observed respecting the gymnoti, during our abode in South America.  Electr=
ical fishes, when very=20

vigorous, act with equal energy under water and in the air. This observatio=
n led us to examine the=20

conducting property of water; and we found that, when several persons form =
the chain between=20

the superior and inferior surface of the organs of the torpedo, the shock i=
s felt only when these=20

persons join hands. The action is not intercepted if two persons, who suppo=
rt the torpedo with their=20

right hands, instead of taking one another by the left hand, plunge each a =
metallic point into a drop=20

of water placed on an insulating substance. On substituting flame for the d=
rop of water, the=20

communication is interrupted, and is only re-established, as in the gymnotu=
s, when the two points=20

immediately touch each other in the interior of the flame.  We are, doubtle=
ss, very far from having=20

discovered all the secrets of the electrical action of fishes which is modi=
fied by the influence of the=20

brain and the nerves; but the experiments we have just described are suffic=
ient to prove that these=20

fishes act by a concealed electricity, and by electromotive organs of a pec=
uliar construction, which=20

are recharged with extreme rapidity. Volta admits that the discharges of th=
e opposite electricities in=20

the torpedos and the gymnoti are made by their own skin, and that when we t=
ouch them with one=20

hand only, or by means of a metallic point, we feel the effect of a lateral=
 shock, the electrical=20

current not being directed solely the shortest way. When a Leyden jar is pl=
aced on a wet woollen=20

cloth (which is a bad conductor), and the jar is discharged in such a manne=
r that the cloth makes=20

part of the chain, prepared frogs, placed at different distances, indicate =
by their contractions that=20

the current spreads itself over the whole cloth in a thousand different way=
s. According to this=20

analogy, the most violent shock given by the gymnotus at a distance would b=
e but a feeble part of=20

the stroke which re-establishes the equilibrium in the interior of the fish=
.* (* The heterogeneous=20

poles of the double electrical organs must exist in each organ. Mr. Todd ha=
s recently proved, by=20

experiments made on torpedos at the Cape of Good Hope, that the animal cont=
inues to give=20


_
absolutely calm, so, as even the Mediterranean may be treacherous, and sudd=
en squalls can lash=20

its smooth surface into waves, it was wise to take advantage of a cloudless=
 day.  "We'll start early,=20

so as to arrive there before the steamer, and have the grotto to ourselves,=
 instead of going in with=20

a rabble of tourists," decreed Hilton Preston.  "Four boatfuls of us will b=
e a big enough party,"=20

agreed Vincent. "They say the best light is at about eleven."  The group of=
 friends therefore set off=20

from the Marina in their various craft. The row along the base of the preci=
pitous craggy shore was=20

most beautiful, the water swarmed with gayly-colored sea-stars and jelly-fi=
sh, and on the rocks at=20

the edge of the waves grew gorgeous madrepores, and other "frutti di mare."=
 The Blue Grotto is=20

one of the wonders of Italy, but to explore it is not a particularly easy m=
atter, for its entrance is=20

scarcely three feet in height.  "My! Have we got to squeeze under there!" e=
xclaimed Peachy=20

wonderingly, looking at the tiny space at the foot of the crag through whic=
h they would be obliged=20

to pass.  "Not in these boats, of course," said Vincent. "The skiffs are wa=
iting, and if we just leave=20

it to the boatmen they'll show us how to manage."  The tiny craft that were=
 in readiness for visitors=20

now came forward, and the party was transferred to them. Three passengers w=
ere taken in each=20

skiff, and were required to lie flat on their backs in the bottom of the bo=
at. The boatman paddled to=20

the entrance of the grotto, then also lying on his back he shocks when one =
of these organs is=20

extirpated. On the contrary, all electrical action is stopped (and this poi=
nt, as elucidated by=20

Galvani, is of the greatest importance) if injury be inflicted on the brain=
, or if the nerves which=20

supply the plates of the electrical organs be divided. In the latter case, =
the nerves being cut, and=20

the brain left untouched, the torpedo continues to live, and perform every =
muscular movement. A=20

fish, exhausted by too numerous electrical discharges, suffered much more t=
han another fish=20

deprived, by dividing the nerves, of any communication between the brain an=
d the electromotive=20

apparatus. Philosophical Transactions 1816.) As the gymnotus directs its st=
roke wherever it=20

pleases, it must also be admitted that the discharge is not made by the who=
le skin at once, but=20

that the animal, excited perhaps by the motion of a fluid poured into one p=
art of the cellular=20

membrane, establishes at will the communication between its organs and some=
 particular part of=20

the skin. It may be conceived that a lateral stroke, out of the direct curr=
ent, must become=20

imperceptible under the two conditions of a very weak discharge, or a very =
great obstacle=20

presented by the nature and length of the conductor. Notwithstanding these =
considerations, it=20

appears to me very surprising that shocks of the torpedo, strong in appeara=
nce, are not=20

propagated to the hand when a very thin plate of metal is interposed betwee=
n it and the fish.=20

Schilling declared that the gymnotus approached the magnet involuntarily. W=
e tried in a thousand=20
