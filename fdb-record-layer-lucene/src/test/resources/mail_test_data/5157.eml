"I do not understand," stammered the duc, and mechanically now--instinctive=
ly--father and=20

daughter clung to one another as if each was striving to protect the other =
from the raving fury of=20

this madman. Never for a moment did they believe that he was sane. Exciteme=
nt, they thought,=20

had turned his brain: he was acting and speaking like one possessed.  "I da=
re say it would after=20

the buffalo on our own account.  And--I say, look there!  Isn't that someth=
in' like them on the top o'=20

the far bluff yonder?  A fellow like you, wi' sharp sailor-eyes, ought to b=
e able to make them out."=20

"You forget, lad, that I ain't a buffalo runner, an' don't know the cut o' =
the brutes' jibs yet.  It does=20

look like somethin'.  Come, we'll go an' see."  Putting=20


_
glide gently along the Loire, to make such as you understand that your arro=
gance and your pride=20

are destined to be humbled at last and that you are now in the power of tho=
se men who awhile=20

ago you did not deem worthy to lick your boots. I dare say," he continued c=
almly, "you think that I=20

am crazed. Well! perhaps I am, but sane enough anyhow, M. le duc, to enjoy =
the full flavour of=20

revenge."  "Revenge?... what have we done?... what has my daughter done?...=
" stammered the=20

duc incoherently. "You swore you loved her ... desired to make her your wif=
e ... I consented ...=20

she...."  Martin-Roget's harsh laugh broke in on his vague murmurings.  "An=
d like an arrogant fool=20

you fell into the trap," he said with calm irony, "and you were too blind t=
o see in Martin-Roget,=20

friends, taking advantage of every knoll and hollow, succeeded in getting s=
ufficiently near to=20

perceive that a small herd was grazing quietly in a grassy bottom between t=
wo prairie waves.=20

They halted at once for consultation.  "Now, then, Archie," said the sailor=
, examining the priming of=20

his gun, "here we are at last, a-goin' to begin a pitched battle.  There's =
this to be said for us, that=20

neither you nor me knows rightly how to go to work, both on us havin' up to=
 this time bin trained,=20

so to speak, on hearsay.  But what o' that?  In the language o' the immorti=
al Nelson, `England=20

expec's every man to do his dooty.'  Now it seems to me my dooty on the pre=
sent occasion is to=20

lay myself alongside of a buffalo an' blaze away!  Isn't that the order o' =
battle?"=20


_
daughter's hand, Pierre Adet, the son of the victim of your execrable tyran=
ny, the innocent man=20

murdered at your bidding."  "Pierre Adet ... I don't understand."  "'Tis bu=
t little meseems that you=20

do understand, M. le duc," sneered the other. "But turn your memory back, I=
 sharp round an'=20

catches you on his horns.  You know the bulls are apt to do that sometimes.=
"  "Trust me, lad, I'll=20

keep clear o' the bulls."  "And you understand how to re-load?" asked the b=
oy.  "O yes, all right.=20

Dan put me thro' the gunnery practice on the way out, an' I=20


_
ago when a few hot-headed peasant lads planned to give you a fright in your=
 castle of Kernogan ...=20

the plan failed and Pierre Adet, the leader of that unfortunate band, manag=
ed to fly the country,=20

whilst you, like a crazed and blind tyrant, administered punishment right a=
nd left for the fright=20

which you had had. Just think of it! those boors! those louts! that swinish=
 herd of human cattle had=20

dared to raise a cry of revolt against you! To death with them all! to deat=
h! Where is Pierre Adet,=20

the leader of those hogs? to him an exemplary punishment must be meted! a d=
eterrent against=20

any other attempt at revolt. Well, M. le duc, do you remember what happened=
 then? Pierre Adet,=20

severely injured in the melee, had managed to crawl away into safety. While=
 he lay betwixt life and=20

death, first in the presbytery of Vertou, then in various ditches on his wa=
y to Paris, he knew=20

nothing of what happened at Nantes. When he returned to consciousness and t=
o active life he=20

heard that his father, Jean Adet the then.  Two or three balls in the mouth=
 ready to spit into the=20

gun--"  "Not all at once, though, Jenkins."  "In course not, lad: one at a =
time: no ramming; hit the=20

butt on the saddle; blaze away; one down, another come on--eh?"  "That's it=
," said Archie, eager=20

for the fray.  "How I wish Dan had let me have a gun!"  "Safer not, lad.  A=
n' keep well in rear, for I=20

may be apt to fire wide in the heat of action."  With this final caution, t=
he mariner put his gun on full=20

cock, shook the reins, and trotted quietly forward until he saw that the bu=
ffalo had observed him.=20

Then, as he afterwards expressed it, he "clapped on all sail-stuns'ls alow =
and aloft, and sky-

scrapers--and went into action like a true blue British tar, with little Ar=
chie Sinclair full sail astern."=20

He did not, however, come out of action with as much _eclat_ as he went int=
o it, but justice obliges=20

us to admit that he came out victorious.  We cannot do better than give his=
 own description of that=20

action as related beside the camp-fire=20


_
been hanged by order of M. le duc de Kernogan."  He paused awhile and a cur=
ious laugh--half-

convulsive and not unmixed with sobs--shook his broad shoulders. Neither th=
e duc nor Yvonne=20

made any comment on what they heard: the duc felt like a fly caught in a de=
ath-dealing web. He=20

was dazed with the horror of his position, dazed above all with the rush of=
 bitter remorse which=20

had surged up in his heart and mind, when he realised that it was his own f=
olly, his obstinacy--aye!=20

and his heartlessness which had brought this awful fate upon his daughter. =
And Yvonne felt that=20

whatever she might endure of misery and hopelessness was nothing in compari=
son with what her=20

father must feel with the addition of bitter self-reproach.  "Are you begin=
ning to understand the=20

position better friends.  "Well, you must know," he began, after finishing =
his supper and lighting his=20

pipe, "that long-legged frigate o' mine that Dan calls a chestnut-- though =
a cocoanut would be=20

more like the thing, if you take size into account--he's as keen for the ch=
ase as a small boy arter a=20

butterfly, an' before I could say `Jack Robinson,' a'most, he had me into t=
he middle o' the herd an'=20

alongside o' the big bull.  Any one could tell it was him, in spite o' the =
dust we kicked up, by reason=20

o' the side-glance o' his wicked little eye, his big hairy fore'id, an' his=
 tail stickin' out stiff like a=20

crook'd spankerboom.  "In course I was not a-goin' to fire into him, so I g=
ave the frigate a dig wi'=20

my heels--tho' I'd got no irons on 'em--an' tried to shove up alongside of =
a fat=20


_
queried Martin-Roget after awhile.  The duc sank back nerveless upon the pi=
le of cordages close=20

by. Yvonne was leaning with her back against the taffrail, her two arms out=
stretched, the north-

west wind blowing her soft brown hair about her face whilst her eyes sought=
 through the gloom to=20

read the lines of cruelty and hatred which must be distorting Martin-Roget'=
s face now.  "And," she=20

said quietly after awhile, "you have waited all these years, Monsieur, nurs=
ing thoughts of revenge=20

and of hate against us. Ah! past the bull he made a vicious dab wi' his hor=
n, and caught the frigate=20

on her flank--right abaft the mizzen chains, like.  Whew! you should ha' se=
en what a sheer she=20

made right away to starboard!  If it hadn't bin that I was on the look-out,=
 I'd ha' bin slap overboard=20

that time, but I see'd the squall comin', an', seizin' my brute's mane, hel=
d on like a monkey wi'=20

hand an' leg.  "Well, before I knew where I was, the cocoan--I mean the che=
stnut, had me=20

alongside the cow.  I stuck the muzzle a'most into her ribs,=20
