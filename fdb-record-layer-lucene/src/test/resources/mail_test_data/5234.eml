philodendron monstera entertain this opinion with ignorance. They say (afte=
r the Jews) that he gave his son-in-law [Moses] that wonder-working rod wit=

cter, not to be turned aside by any considerations of policy or of humanity=
 from what he conceived to be his duty; and his duty it was, and his right,=
 according to his idea, to dominate the world and the kings thereof. When t=
he friends of Ingeburge called her case to his attention, Pope Innocent wro=
te letter after letter philodendron monstera entertain this opinion with ig=
norance. They say (after the Jews) that he gave his son-in-law [Moses] that=
 wonder-working rod with which he performed all those miracles in Egypt and=
 the Desert, and also excellent advice and instructions; whence he had the =
surname of 'Khateeb-el-Ambiya,' or 'the Preacher to the Prophets.'--S.  [25=
4] The inflexible character, not to be turned aside by any considerations o=
f policy or of humanity from what he conceived to be his duty; and his duty=
 it was, and his right, according to his idea, to dominate the world and th=
e kings thereof. When the friends of Ingeburge called her case to his atten=
tion, Pope Innocent wrote letter after letter _
pledge, and the others may return home with their provision; and when ye co=
me again, ye shall=20

bring your younger brother with you, that I may know ye have told me the tr=
uth. Whereupon, it=20

being in vain to dispute the matter, they cast lots who should stay behind,=
 and the lot fell upon=20

Simeon. When they departed, Joseph gave each of them a camel, and another f=
or their brother.--

S. (B.)  [237] The original word signifying not only money but also goods b=
artered or given in=20

exchange for other merchandise, some commentators tell us that they paid fo=
r their corn, not in=20

money, but in shoes and dressed skins.--S. (B.)  [238] The belief in the in=
fluence of the evil eye=20

prevails among all the Muslims, even the most religious and learned; for th=
eir prophet said, 'The=20

eye hath a complete influence; because verily, if there were a thing to ove=
rcome fate, it most=20

certainly would be a malignant eye.' Hence he permitted charms (which he di=
sallowed in almost=20

every other case) to be employed for the purpose of counteracting its influ=
ence.  [239] It is related=20

that Joseph, having invited his brethren to an entertainment, ordered them =
to be placed two and=20

two together; by which means, Benjamin, the eleventh, was obliged to sit al=
one, and, bursting into=20

tears, said, If my brother Joseph were alive, he would have sat with me. Wh=
ereupon Joseph=20

ordered him to be seated at the same table with himself, and when the enter=
tainment was over,=20

dismissed the rest, ordering that they should be lodged two and two in a ho=
use, but kept Benjamin=20

in his Heloise and her letters, written not long before Marie's time, take =
their place in literature, it is=20

in the literature of scholastic Latin, not of old French.     CHAPTER IV  W=
OMEN IN THE AGE OF=20

SAINT LOUIS  WHILE romance has preserved many memories, and history not a f=
ew facts, of=20

Eleanor of Guienne, the records concerning two other notable women, her con=
temporaries, are=20

very scanty. Whatever her faults, Eleanor was a great and commanding person=
ality, one that=20

could not be overlooked because, whether for good or ill, she was always po=
werful. The two=20

unhappy queens of Philippe Auguste, Ingeburge de Danemark and Agnes de Mera=
nie, though=20

they were the innocent causes of much distress in France, are yet hardly kn=
own to us as=20

personalities.  The first queen of Philippe Auguste was Isabelle de Hainaul=
t; after her death he=20

sought the hand of a Danish princess, Ingeburge, sister of Knut IV. The mar=
riage was one=20

contracted for political reasons; Philippe was at the time engaged in his l=
ifelong struggle against=20

the power of the Plantagenets, and desired an ally against Richard Coeur de=
 Lion. At Amiens, on=20

Assumption eve, 1193, Ingeburge was married to the King of France; the next=
 day she was=20

crowned Queen of France by the Archbishop of Rheims. During the ceremony, s=
ays a chronicler=20

of Aix, "the King, looking on the Princess, began to conceive a horror of h=
er; he trembled, he grew=20

pale, he was so greatly troubled in spirit that he could hardly contain him=
self till the end of the=20

ceremony." For some unknown reason the fair=20


_
night. The next day, Joseph asked him whether he would accept of himself fo=
r his brother, in the=20

room of him whom he had lost; to which Benjamin replied, 'Who can find a br=
other comparable=20

unto thee? Yet thou art not the son of Jacob and Rachel.' And upon this, Jo=
seph discovered=20

himself to him.--S. (B.).  [240] Some, however, are of opinion that it was =
a drinking-cup.  [241] The=20

occasion of this suspicion, it is said, was that Joseph having been brought=
 up by his father's sister,=20

she became so fond of him, that when he grew up and Jacob designed to take =
him from her she=20

contrived the following stratagem to keep him. Having a girdle which had on=
ce belonged to=20

Abraham, she girt it about the child, and then pretending she had lost it, =
caused strict search to be=20

made for it; and it being at length found on Joseph, he was adjudged, accor=
ding to the above-

mentioned law of the family, to be delivered to her as her property. Some, =
however, say that=20

Joseph actually stole an idol of gold, which belonged to his mother's fathe=
r, and destroyed it; a=20

story probably taken from Rachel's stealing the images of Laban: and others=
 tell us that he once=20

stole a goat or a hen, to give to a poor man.--S.  [242] Misr is the name b=
oth of Egypt and its=20

capital.  [243] The injury they did Benjamin was the separating him from hi=
s brother, after which=20

they kept him in so great subjection that he durst not speak to them but wi=
th the utmost=20

submission. Some say that these words were occasioned by a letter which Jos=
eph's brethren=20

delivered to him from their father, requesting the releasement of Benjamin,=
 and by their=20

representing his extreme affliction at the loss of him and his brother. The=
 commentators observe=20

that Joseph, to excuse his brethren's behaviour towards him, attributes it =
to their ignorance and=20

the heat of youth.--S. (B.)  [244] The frontier town of Egypt towards Syria=
.  [245] El-Beydawee tell=20

us that Joseph sent carriages and provisions for his father and his family;=
 and that he and the king=20

of Egypt went forth to meet them. He adds that the number of the children o=
f Israel who entered=20

Egypt with him was seventy-two; and that when they were led out thence by M=
oses, they were=20

increased to six hundred thousand five hundred and seventy men, and upwards=
, besides the old=20

people and children.--S.  [246] A transposition is supposed to be in these =
words:--he seated his=20

father and mother after they had bowed down to him, and not before.--S. (B.=
)  [247] But when=20

Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, he took up the coffin, and carried J=
oseph's bones with him=20

into Canaan, where he buried them by his ancestors.--S. (B.)  [248] The Moh=
ammadan writers tell=20

us that Job was of the race of Esau, and was blessed with a numerous family=
 and abundant=20

riches; but that God proved him by taking away all that he had, even his ch=
ildren, who were killed=20

by the fall of a house; notwithstanding which he continued to serve God and=
 to return Him thanks=20

as usual; that he was then struck with a filthy disease, his body being ful=
l of worms and so=20

offensive that as he lay on the dunghill none could bear to come near him: =
that his wife, however=20

(whom some call Rahmeh the daughter of Ephraim the son of Joseph, and other=
s Makhir the=20

daughter of Manasses), attended him with great patience, supporting him wit=
h what she earned by=20

her labour; but that the devil appearing to her one day, after having remin=
ded her of her past=20

repugnance; and from that moment he began to devise means of getting rid of=
 her.  Ingeburge,=20

according to the testimony of those who had no special reason to favor her =
but every reason to=20

justify the king, was of a gentle disposition, sensible, affectionate, and =
endowed with considerable=20

beauty of the type usually associated with Danish women. She was a defencel=
ess stranger, not=20

even acquainted with the French language, and there were but few in France =
to champion her=20

cause in the painful complications that followed. Philippe's aversion could=
 by no means be=20



accounted for; in the Middle Ages what could not be accounted for, if of ev=
il nature, was the work=20

of the devil or of his vicegerents on earth, the witches; so it was promptl=
y reported that the King of=20

France was bewitched, though it is not exactly apparent that the real force=
 of the enchantment fell=20

upon him it was Ingeburge who suffered.  Philippe began proceedings to obta=
in an annulment of=20

the marriage, which, he asseverated, had never been consummated. This was d=
enied by=20

Ingeburge, and we are inclined to take her word rather than that of the uns=
crupulous king, who,=20

though a successful ruler, was not at all averse to falsehood where falseho=
od served his turn. The=20

pair separated almost at once, and Philippe tried by ill treatment to make =
Ingeburge consent to a=20

legal separation. After three months of the utmost unhappiness the young qu=
een had the shame of=20

hearing her marriage declared null and void. The council which rendered thi=
s decision consisted=20

wholly of French prelates, presided over by the very Archbishop of Rheims w=
ho had pronounced=20

the nuptial benediction over the pair. Ingeburge was at Compiegne, where th=
e council met, and=20

was present at the session at which her marriage was annulled on the frivol=
ous pretext of a=20

kinship, not between Philippe and Ingeburge for even the ingenuity of media=
eval genealogy could=20

not trace out that but between the late Queen Isabella and Ingeburge. The u=
nfortunate Danish=20

lady could not understand what these priests were saying in the strange ton=
gue of the land to=20

which she had come to be a queen; when the purport of the proceedings was e=
xplained to her=20

through an interpreter, she exclaimed, in tears: _"Male France! Male France=
!_ Rome! Rome!"=20

[Illustration 3: DOMESTIC INTERIOR IN FRANCE, TWELFTH CENTURY. From a water=
-color by=20

S. Baron, after a description by Viollet-le-Duc. The decorated fireplace, b=
etween two windows,=20

was wide enough to hold logs eight or ten feet long. Two large benches were=
 at right angles, one=20

with a movable back, the other being double-seated. The table was fixed to =
the floor, the master's=20

chair being elevated, other diners sat on stools. The tablecloth was used f=
or wiping fingers and=20

lips. The buffet, with cups and goblets on top, was used as to-day. General=
ly, the beds were=20

narrow and displayed great luxury: the wood was carved, incrusted, or paint=
ed; the coverlets had=20

fringes and embroideries; curtains formed an alcove, and a night lamp was h=
ung at the foot. The=20

room contained an oratory.  In the rear were the kitchen, etc, and on the u=
pper floors were=20

sleeping and other chambers.]  She did indeed appeal from "wicked France" t=
o Rome, and the=20

appeal was not without ultimate good effect. In the meantime she refused to=
 prejudice her cause=20

by returning to Denmark, and the heartless Philippe confined her, almost as=
 a criminal, in a=20

convent at Cisoing, in the=20


_
she would worship him, he would restore all they had lost; whereupon she as=
ked her husband's=20

consent, who was so angry at the proposal, that he swore, if he recovered, =
to give his wife a=20

hundred stripes.--S. (B., J., A.F.)  [249] Some say there were two springs,=
 one of hot water=20

wherein he bathed, and the other of cold of which he drank.--S. (B.)  [250]=
 His wife also becoming=20

young and handsome again, and bearing him twenty-six sons. Some, to express=
 the great riches=20

which were bestowed on Job after his sufferings, say he had two threshing-f=
loors, one for wheat=20

and the other for barley, and that God sent two clouds, which rained gold o=
n the one and silver on=20

the other till they ran over.--(J.) The traditions differ as to the continu=
ance of Job's calamities: one=20

will have it to be eighteen years; another, thirteen; another, three; and a=
nother, exactly seven=20

years seven months and seven hours.--S.  [251] Or 'a palm-branch having a h=
undred leaves.'--S.=20

[252] But see note 1 (248).  [253] The commentators generally suppose him t=
o be the same=20

person with the father-in-law of Moses, who is named in Scripture Reuel or =
Raguel, and Jethro.=20

But Ahmad Tournois; he did not even have the decency or the humanity to pro=
vide suitably for her=20

actual needs.  The appeal to Rome was pushed by Ingeburge's brother, Knut I=
V., and the Pope,=20

Celestine III., at length granted the appeal, on March 13, 1196, reversing =
the decree of the council=20

of Compiegne. The papal power was then in very weak hands, and it was fear =
of offending the=20

great King of France that had occasioned the long delay in rendering justic=
e to Ingeburge. That=20

something more than a mere papal decree would be needed to subdue Philippe =
was apparent=20

when, in June, 1196, he married Agnes de Meranie, the lovely daughter of a =
German prince who,=20

under the title of Duke of Meranie, ruled the Tyrol, Istria, and a part of =
Bohemia. The papal=20

menaces had not deterred the king from this insolent act of disobedience; a=
nd Pope Celestine=20

made no attempt to coerce him by resort to more rigorous measures. Ingeburg=
e continued to live=20

in confinement, while Philippe enjoyed the love of his new wife, against wh=
om no one could lay the=20

guilt of her husband's licentious conduct.  In January, 1198, Pope Celestin=
e was succeeded by=20

Innocent III., one of the greatest of the=20
