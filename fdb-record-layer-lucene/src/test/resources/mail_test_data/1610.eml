arut le soir, a l'heure=20

ou les habitues de son cercle arriverent. Jamais le salon des Grandet n'ava=

Charles avait ete=20

repandue dans toute la ville. Mais quelque attentive que fut la curiosite d=
es visiteurs, elle ne fut=20

point satisfaite. Eugenie, qui s'y etait attendue, ne laissa percer sur son=
 visage calme aucune des=20

cruelles emotions qui l'agitaient. Elle sut prendre une figure riante pour =
repondre a ceux qui=20

voulurent lui temoigner de l'interet par des regards ou des paroles melanco=

couvrir son malheur sous les voiles de la politesse. Vers neuf heures, les =
parties finissaient, et les=20

joueurs quittaient leurs tables, se payaient et discutaient les derniers co=
ups de whist en venant se=20

joindre au cercle des causeurs. Au moment ou l'assemblee se leva en masse p=
our quitter le salon,=20

il y eut un coup de theatre qui retentit dans Saumur, de la dans l'arrondis=
sement et dans les=20

quatre prefectures environnantes.  --Restez, monsieur le president, dit Eug=
enie a monsieur de=20

Bonfons en lui voyant prendre sa canne.  A cette parole, il n'y eut personn=
e dans cette nombreuse=20

assemblee qui ne se sentit emu. Le president palit et fut oblige de s'asseo=
ir.  --Au president les=20

millions, dit mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.  --C'est clair, le president de=
 Bonfons epouse=20

mademoiselle Grandet, s'ecria madame d'Orsonval.  --Voila le meilleur coup =
de la partie, dit=20

l'abbe.  --C'est un beau _schleem_, dit le notaire.  Chacun dit son mot, ch=
acun fit son calembour,=20

tous voyaient l'heritiere montee sur ses millions, comme sur un piedestal. =
Le drame commence=20

depuis neuf ans se denouait. Dire, en face de tout Saumur, au president de =
rester, n'etait-ce pas=20

annoncer qu'elle voulait faire de lui son mari. Dans les petites villes, le=
s convenances sont si=20

severement observees, qu'une infraction de ce genre y constitue la plus sol=

promesses.  --Monsieur le president, lui dit Eugenie d'une voix emue quand =
ils furent seuls, je sais=20

ce qui vous plait en moi. Jurez de me laisser libre pendant toute ma vie, d=
e ne me rappeler aucun=20

des droits que le mariage vous donne sur moi, et ma main est a vous. Oh! re=
prit-elle en le voyant=20

se mettre a ses genoux, je n'ai pas tout dit. Je ne dois pas vous tromper, =
monsieur. J'ai dans le=20

vous ne possederez ma=20

main et ma fortune qu'au prix d'un immense service.  --Vous me voyez pret a=
 tout, dit le president.=20

--Voici douze cent mille francs, monsieur le president, dit-elle en tirant =
un papier de son sein;=20

homme loyal, un galant homme; je m'embarquerai sur la foi de votre parole p=
our traverser les=20

dangers de la vie a l'abri de votre nom. Nous aurons l'un pour l'autre une =
mutuelle indulgence.=20

Nous nous connaissons depuis si longtemps, nous sommes presque parents, vou=
s ne voudriez=20

pas me rendre malheureuse.  Le president tomba aux pieds de la riche heriti=
ere en palpitant de=20

joie et d'angoisse.  --Je serai votre esclave! lui dit-il.  --Quand vous au=
rez la quittance, monsieur,=20

reprit-elle en lui jetant un regard froid, vous la porterez avec tous les t=
itres a mon cousin Grandet=20

et vous lui remettrez cette lettre. A votre retour, je tiendrai ma parole. =
 Le president comprit, lui,=20

qu'il devait mademoiselle Grandet a un depit amoureux; aussi s'empressa-t-i=
l d'executer ses=20

ordres avec la plus grande promptitude, afin qu'il n'arrivat aucune reconci=
liation entre les deux=20

amants.  Quand monsieur de Bonfons fut parti, Eugenie tomba sur son fauteui=
l et fondit en larmes.=20

Tout etait consomme. Le president prit la poste, et se trouvait a Paris le =
lendemain soir. Dans la=20

matinee du jour qui suivit son arrivee, il alla chez des Grassins. Le magis=
trat convoqua les=20

creanciers en l'Etude du notaire ou etaient deposes les titres, et chez leq=
uel pas un ne faillit a=20

l'appel. Quoique ce fussent des creanciers, il faut leur rendre justice: il=
s furent exacts. La, le=20

president de Bonfons, au nom de mademoiselle Grandet, leur paya le capital =
et les interets dus.=20

Le payement des interets fut pour le commerce parisien un des evenements le=
s plus etonnants de=20

l'epoque. Quand la quittance fut enregistree et des Grassins paye de ses so=
ins par le don d'une=20

somme de cinquante mille francs que lui avait allouee Eugenie, le president=
 se rendit a l'hotel=20

d'Aubrion, et y trouva Charles au moment ou il rentrait dans son appartemen=
t, accable par son=20

beau-pere. Le vieux marquis venait de lui declarer que sa fille ne lui appa=
rtiendrait qu'autant que=20

tous les creanciers de Guillaume Grandet seraient soldes.  Le president lui=
 remit d'abord la lettre=20

suivante.  "MON COUSIN, monsieur le president de Bonfons s'est charge de vo=
us remettre la=20

quittance de toutes les sommes dues par mon oncle et celle par laquelle je =
reconnais les avoir=20

recues de vous. On m'a parle de faillite!... J'ai pense que le fils d'un fa=

epouser mademoiselle d'Aubrion. Oui, mon cousin, vous avez bien juge de mon=
 esprit et de mes=20

manieres: je n'ai sans doute rien du monde, je n'en connais ni les calculs =
ni les moeurs, et ne=20

conventions sociales auxquelles vous sacrifiez nos premieres amours. Pour r=
endre votre bonheur=20

complet, je ne puis donc plus vous offrir que l'honneur de votre pere. Adie=
u, vous aurez toujours=20

une fidele amie dans votre cousine,  EUGENIE. "  Le president sourit de l'e=
xclamation que ne put=20

reprimer cet ambitieux au moment ou il recut l'acte authentique.  --Nous no=
us annoncerons=20

reciproquement nos mariages, lui dit-il.  --Ah! vous epousez Eugenie. Eh! b=
ien, j'en suis content,=20

c'est une bonne fille. Mais, reprit-il frappe tout a coup par une reflexion=
 lumineuse, elle est donc=20

riche?  --Elle avait, repondit le president d'un air goguenard, pres de dix=
-neuf millions, il y a quatre=20

jours; mais elle n'en a plus que dix-sept aujourd'hui.  Charles regarda le =
president d'un air hebete.=20

--Dix-sept mil ...  --Dix-sept millions, oui, monsieur. Nous reunissons, ma=
demoiselle Grandet et=20

moi, sept cent cinquante mille livres de rente, en nous mariant.  --Mon che=

retrouvant un peu d'assurance, nous pourrons nous pousser l'un l'autre.  --=
D'accord, dit le=20

president. Voici, de plus, une petite caisse que je dois aussi ne remettre =
qu'a vous, ajouta-t-il en=20

deposant sur une table le coffret dans lequel etait la toilette.  --He! bie=

prenez nul souci de=20

ce que vient de vous dire ce pauvre monsieur d'Aubrion, a qui la duchesse d=

tourner la tete. Je vous le repete, rien n'empechera votre mariage ...  --R=
ien, madame, repondit=20

Charles. Les trois millions autrefois dus par mon pere ont ete soldes hier.=
  --En argent? dit-elle.  --

Integralement, interets et capital, et je vais faire rehabiliter sa memoire=
.  --Quelle betise! s'ecria la=20

belle-mere.  --Quel est ce monsieur? dit-elle a l'oreille de son gendre, en=
 apercevant le Cruchot.  --

Mon homme d'affaires, lui repondit-il a voix basse.  La marquise salua deda=
igneusement monsieur=20

de Bonfons et sortit.  --Nous nous poussons deja, dit le president en prena=
nt sou chapeau. Adieu,=20

mon cousin.  --Il se moque de moi, ce catacouas de Saumur. J'ai envie de lu=
i donner six pouces=20

de fer dans le ventre.  Le president etait parti. Trois jours apres, monsie=
ur de Bonfons, de retour a=20

Saumur, publia son mariage avec Eugenie. Six mois apres, il etait nomme con=
seiller a la Cour=20

royale d'Angers. Avant de quitter Saumur, Eugenie fit fondre l'or des joyau=
x si longtemps precieux=20

a son coeur, et les consacra, ainsi que les huit mille francs de son cousin=
, a un ostensoir d'or et en=20

fit present a la paroisse ou elle avait tant prie Dieu pour lui! Elle parta=
gea d'ailleurs son temps=20

entre Angers et Saumur. Son mari, qui montra du devouement dans une circons=
tance politique,=20

devint president de chambre, et enfin premier president au bout de quelques=
 annees. Il attendit=20

impatiemment la reelection generale afin d'avoir un siege a la Chambre. Il =
convoitait deja la Pairie,=20

et alors ...  --Alors le roi sera donc son cousin, disait Nanon, la grande =
Nanon, madame Cornoiller,=20

bourgeoise de Saumur, a qui sa maitresse annoncait les grandeurs auxquelles=
 elle etait appelee.=20

Neanmoins monsieur le president de Bonfons (il avait enfin aboli le nom pat=
ronymique de=20

Cruchot) ne parvint a realiser aucune de ses idees ambitieuses. Il mourut h=
uit jours apres avoir=20

ete nomme depute de Saumur. Dieu, qui voit tout et ne frappe jamais a faux,=
 le punissait sans=20

que le president eut=20

constamment pour la volonte, pour la solitude de madame de Bonfons. Les fem=
mes citaient=20

monsieur le premier president comme un des hommes les plus delicats, le pla=
ignaient et allaient=20

jusqu'a souvent accuser la douleur, la passion d'Eugenie, mais comme elles =
savent accuser une=20

femme, avec les plus cruels menagements.  --Il faut que madame la president=

bien souffrante pour laisser son mari seul. Pauvre petite femme! Guerira-t-=

meditations et par la vue exquise avec laquelle il saisit les choses qui to=

Madame de Bonfons fut veuve a trente-six ans, riche de huit cent mille livr=

ermettait d'allumer le=20

est toujours vetue comme l'etait sa mere. La maison de Saumur, maison sans =
soleil, sans chaleur,=20

sans cesse ombragee, melancolique, est l'image de sa vie. Elle accumule soi=

be copied and the cataracts, he advised Don Jose Solano to wait a whole yea=
r before he formed a=20

settlement on the Atabapo; predicting the misfortunes which were not slow t=
o arrive. "Let me=20

labour with my people in clearing the ground," said Cuseru to the Jesuits; =
I will plant cassava, and=20

you will find hereafter wherewith to feed all these men." Solano, impatient=
 to advance, refused to=20

listen to the counsel of the Indian chief, and the new inhabitants of San F=
ernando had to suffer all=20

the evils of scarcity. Canoes were sent at a great expense to New Grenada, =
by the Meta and the=20

Vichada, in search of flour. The provision arrived too late, and many Spani=
ards and Indians=20

perished of those diseases which are produced in every climate by want and =
moral dejection.=20

Some traces of cultivation are still found at San Fernando. Every Indian ha=
s a small plantation of=20

cacao-trees, which produce abundantly in the fifth year; but they cease to =
bear fruit sooner than in=20

the valleys of Aragua. There are some savannahs and good pasturage round Sa=
n Fernando, but=20

hardly seven or eight cows are to be found, the remains of a considerable h=
erd which was brought=20

into these countries at the expedition for settling the boundaries. The Ind=
ians are a little more=20

civilized here than in the rest of the missions, and we found to our surpri=
se a blacksmith of the=20

native race.  In the mission of San Fernando, a tree which gives a peculiar=
 physiognomy to the=20

landscape, is the piritu or pirijao palm. Its trunk, armed with thorns, is =
more than sixty feet high; its=20

leaves are pinnated, very thin, undulated, and frizzled towards the points.=
 The fruits of this tree are=20

very extraordinary; every cluster contains from fifty to eighty; they are y=
ellow like apples, grow=20

purple in proportion as they ripen, two or three inches thick, and generall=
y, from abortion, without a=20

kernel. Among the eighty or ninety species of palm-trees peculiar to the Ne=
w Continent, which I=20

have enumerated in the Nova Genera Plantarum Aequinoctialum, there are none=
 in which the=20

sarcocarp is developed in a manner so extraordinary. The fruit of the pirij=
ao furnishes a=20

farinaceous substance, as yellow as the yolk of an egg, slightly saccharine=
, and extremely=20

nutritious. It is eaten like plantains or potatoes, boiled or roasted in th=
e ashes, and affords a=20

wholesome and agreeable aliment. The Indians and the missionaries are unwea=
ried in their=20

praises of this noble palm-tree, which might be called the peach-palm. We f=
ound it cultivated in=20

abundance at San Fernando, San Balthasar, Santa Barbara, and wherever we ad=
vanced towards=20

the south or the east along the banks of the Atabapo and the Upper Orinoco.=
 In those wild regions=20

we are involuntarily reminded of the assertion of Linnaeus, that the countr=
y of palm-trees was the=20

first abode of our species, and that man is essentially palmivorous.* (* Ho=
mo HABITAT intra=20

tropicos, vescitur palmis, lotophagus; HOSPITATUR extra tropicos sub noverc=
ante Cerere,=20

carnivorus. Man DWELLS NATURALLY within the tropics, and lives on the fruit=
s of the palm-tree;=20

he EXISTS in other parts of the world, and there makes shift to feed on cor=
n and flesh. Syst. Nat.=20



volume 1 page 24.) On examining the provision accumulated in the huts of th=
e Indians, we=20

perceive that their subsistence during several months of the year depends a=
s much on the=20

farinaceous fruit of the pirijao, as on the cassava and plantain. The tree =
bears fruit but once a=20

year, but to the amount of three clusters, consequently from one hundred an=
d fifty to two hundred=20

fruits.  San Fernando de Atabapo, San Carlos, and San Francisco Solano, are=
 the most=20

considerable settlements among the missions of the Upper Orinoco. At San Fe=
rnando, as well as=20

in the neighbouring villages of San Balthasar and Javita, the abodes of the=
 priests are neatly-built=20

houses, covered by lianas, and surrounded by gardens. The tall trunks of th=
e pirijao palms were=20

the most beautiful ornaments of these plantations. In our walks, the presid=
ent of the mission gave=20

us an animated account of his incursions on the Rio Guaviare. He related to=
 us how much these=20

journeys, undertaken "for the conquest of souls;" are desired by the Indian=
s of the missions. All,=20

even women and old men, take part in them. Under the pretext of recovering =
neophytes who have=20

deserted the village, children above eight or ten years of age are carried =
off, and distributed=20

among the Indians of the missions as serfs, or poitos. According to the ast=
ronomical observations I=20

took on the banks of the Atabapo, and on the western declivity of the Cordi=
llera of the Andes, near=20

the Paramo de la suma Paz, the distance is one hundred and seven leagues on=
ly from San=20

Fernando to the first villages of the provinces of Caguan and San Juan de l=
os Llanos. I was=20

assured also by some Indians, who dwelt formerly to the west of the island =
of Amanaveni, beyond=20

the confluence of the Rio Supavi, that going in a boat on the Guaviare (in =
the manner of the=20

savages) beyond the strait (angostura) and the principal cataract, they met=
, at three days'=20

distance, bearded and clothed men, who came in search of the eggs of the te=
rekay turtle. This=20

meeting alarmed the Indians so much, that they fled precipitately, redescen=
ding the Guaviare. It is=20

probable, that these bearded white men came from the villages of Aroma and =
San Martin, the Rio=20

Guaviare being formed by the union of the rivers Ariari and Guayavero. We m=
ust not be surprised=20

that the missionaries of the Orinoco and the Atabapo little suspect how nea=
r they live to the=20

missionaries of Mocoa, Rio Fragua, and Caguan. In these desert countries, t=
he real distances can=20

be known only by observations of the longitude. It was in consequence of as=
tronomical data, and=20

the information I gathered in the convents of Popayan and of Pasto, to the =
west of the Cordillera of=20

the Andes, that I formed an accurate idea of the respective situations of t=
he christian settlements=20

on the Atabapo, the Guayavero, and the Caqueta.* (* The Caqueta bears, lowe=
r down, the name=20

of the Yupura.)  Everything changes on entering the Rio Atabapo; the consti=
tution of the=20

atmosphere, the colour of the waters, and the form of the trees that cover =
the shore. You no longer=20

suffer during the day the torment of mosquitos; and the long-legged gnats (=
zancudos) become=20

rare during the night. Beyond the mission of San Fernando these nocturnal i=
nsects disappear=20

altogether. The water of the Orinoco is turbid, and loaded with earthy matt=
er; and in the coves,=20

from the accumulation of dead crocodiles and other putrescent substances, i=
t diffuses a musky=20

and faint smell. We were sometimes obliged to strain this water through a l=
inen cloth before we=20

drank it. The water of the Atabapo, on the contrary, is pure, agreeable to =
the taste, without any=20

trace of smell, brownish by reflected, and of a pale yellow by transmitted =
light. The people call it=20

light, in opposition to the heavy and turbid waters of the Orinoco. Its tem=
perature is generally two=20

degrees, and when you approach the mouth of the Rio Temi, three degrees, co=
oler than the=20

temperature of the Upper Orinoco. After having been compelled during a whol=
e year to drink water=20



at 27 or 28 degrees, a lowering of a few degrees in the temperature produce=
s a very agreeable=20

sensation. I think this lowering of the temperature may be attributed to th=
e river being less broad,=20

and without the sandy beach, the heat of which, at the Orinoco, is by day m=
ore than 50 degrees,=20

and also to the thick shade of the forests which are traversed by the Ataba=
po, the Temi, the=20

Tuamini, and the Guainia, or Rio Negro.  The extreme purity of the black wa=
ters is proved by their=20

limpidity, their transparency, and the clearness with which they reflect th=
e images and colours of=20

surrounding objects. The smallest fish are visible in them at a depth of tw=
enty or thirty feet; and=20

most commonly the bottom of the river may be distinguished, which is not a =
yellowish or brownish=20

mud, like the colour of the water, but a quartzose and granitic sand of daz=
zling whiteness. Nothing=20

can be compared to the beauty of the banks of the Atabapo. Loaded with plan=
ts, among which rise=20

the palms with feathery leaves; the banks are reflected in the waters, and =
this reflex verdure=20

seems to have the same vivid hue as that which clothes the real vegetation.=
 The surface of the=20

fluid is homogeneous, smooth, and destitute of that mixture of suspended sa=
nd and decomposed=20

organic matter, which roughens and streaks the surface of less limpid river=
s.  On quitting the=20

Orinoco, several small rapids must be passed, but without any appearance of=
 danger. Amid these=20

raudalitos, according to the opinion of the missionaries, the Rio Atabapo f=
alls into the Orinoco. I=20

am however disposed to think that the Atabapo falls into the Guaviare. The =
Rio Guaviare, which is=20

much wider than the Atabapo, has white waters, and in the aspect of its ban=
ks, its fishing-birds, its=20

fish, and the great crocodiles which live in it, resembles the Orinoco much=
 more than that part of=20

the Atabapo which comes from the Esmeralda. When a river springs from the j=
unction of two other=20

rivers, nearly alike in size, it is difficult to judge which of the two con=
fluent streams must be=20

regarded as its source. The Indians of San Fernando affirm that the Orinoco=
 rises from two rivers,=20

the Guaviare and the Rio Paragua. They give this latter name to the Upper O=
rinoco, from San=20

Fernando and Santa Barbara to beyond the Esmeralda, and they say that the C=
assiquiare is not=20

an arm of the Orinoco, but of the Rio Paragua. It matters but little whethe=
r or not the name of=20

Orinoco be given to the Rio Paragua, provided we trace the course of these =
rivers as it is in=20

nature, and do not separate by a chain of mountains, (as was done previousl=
y to my travels,)=20

rivers that communicate together, and form one system. When we would give t=
he name of a large=20

river to one of the two branches by which it is formed, it should be applie=
d to that branch which=20

furnishes most water. Now, at the two seasons of the year when I saw the Gu=
aviare and the Upper=20

Orinoco or Rio Paragua (between the Esmeralda and San Fernando), it appeare=
d to me that the=20

latter was not so large as the Guaviare. Similar doubts have been entertain=
ed by geographers=20

respecting the junction of the Upper Mississippi with the Missouri and the =
Ohio, the junction of the=20

Maranon with the Guallaga and the Ucayale, and the junction of the Indus wi=
th the Chunab=20

(Hydaspes of Cashmere) and the Gurra, or Sutlej.* (* The Hydaspes is proper=
ly a tributary stream=20

of the Chunab or Acesines. The Sutlej or Hysudrus forms, together with the =
Beyah or *** Gurra.=20

These are the beautiful regions of the *** celebrated from the time of Alex=
ander to the ***) To=20

avoid embroiling farther a nomenclature of rivers so arbitrarily fixed, I w=
ill not propose new=20

denominations. I shall continue, with Father Caulin and the Spanish geograp=
hers, to call the river=20

Esmeralda the Orinoco, or Upper Orinoco; but I must observe that if the Ori=
noco, from San=20

Fernando de Atabapo as far as the delta which it forms opposite the island =
of Trinidad, were=20

regarded as the continuance of the Rio Guaviare, and if that part of the Up=
per Orinoco between=20



the Esmeralda and the mission of San Fernando were considered a tributary s=
tream, the Orinoco=20

would preserve, from the savannahs of San Juan de los Llanos and the easter=
n declivity of the=20

Andes to its mouth, a more uniform and natural direction, that from south-w=
est to north-east.  The=20

Rio Paragua, or that part of the Orinoco east of the mouth of the Guaviare,=
 has clearer, more=20

transparent, and purer water than the part of the Orinoco below San Fernand=
o. The waters of the=20

Guaviare, on the contrary, are white and turbid; they have the same taste, =
according to the Indians=20

(whose organs of sense are extremely delicate and well practised), as the w=
aters of the Orinoco=20

near the Great Cataracts. "Bring me the waters of three or four great river=
s of these countries," an=20

old Indian of the mission of Javita said to us; "on tasting each of them I =
will tell you, without fear of=20

mistake, whence it was taken; whether it comes from a white or black river;=
 the Orinoco or the=20

Atabapo, the Paragua or the Guaviare." The great crocodiles and porpoises (=
toninas) which are=20

alike common in the Rio Guaviare and the Lower Orinoco, are entirely wantin=
g, as we were told, in=20

the Rio Paragua (or Upper Orinoco, between San Fernando and the Esmeralda).=
 These are very=20

remarkable differences in the nature of the waters, and the distribution of=
 animals. The Indians do=20

not fail to mention them, when they would prove to travellers that the Uppe=
r Orinoco, to the east of=20

San Fernando, is a distinct river which falls into the Orinoco, and that th=
e real origin of the latter=20

must be sought in the sources of the Guaviare.  The astronomical observatio=
ns made in the night=20

of the 25th of April did not give me the latitude with satisfactory precisi=
on. The latitude of the=20

mission of San Fernando appeared to me to be 4 degrees 2 minutes 48 seconds=
. In Father=20

Caulin's map, founded on the observations of Solano made in 1756, it is 4 d=
egrees 1 minute. This=20

agreement proves the justness of a result which, however, I could only dedu=
ce from altitudes=20

considerably distant from the meridian. A good observation of the stars at =
Guapasoso gave me 4=20

degrees 2 minutes for San Fernando de Atabapo. I was able to fix the longit=
ude with much more=20

precision in my way to the Rio Negro, and in returning from that river. It =
is 70 degrees 30 minutes=20

46 seconds (or 4 degrees 0 minutes west of the meridian of Cumana).  On the=
 26th of April we=20

advanced only two or three leagues, and passed the night on a rock near the=
 Indian plantations or=20

conucos of Guapasoso. The river losing itself by its inundations in the for=
ests, and its real banks=20

being unseen, the traveller can venture to land only where a rock or a smal=
l table-land rises above=20

the water. The granite of those countries, owing to the position of the thi=
n laminae of black mica,=20

sometimes resembles graphic granite; but most frequently (and this determin=
es the age of its=20

formation) it passes into a real gneiss. Its beds, very regularly stratifie=
d, run from south-west to=20

north-east, as in the Cordillera on the shore of Caracas. The dip of the gr=
anite-gneiss is 70=20

degrees north-west. It is traversed by an infinite number of veins of quart=
z, which are singularly=20

transparent, and three or four, and sometimes fifteen inches thick. I found=
 no cavity (druse), no=20

crystallized substance, not even rock-crystal; and no trace of pyrites, or =
any other metallic=20

substance. I enter into these particulars on account of the chimerical idea=
s that have been spread=20

ever since the sixteenth century, after the voyages of Berreo and Raleigh,*=
 "on the immense=20

riches of the great and fine empire of Guiana." (* Raleigh's work bears the=
 high sounding title of=20

The Discovery of the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of Guiana, London 15=
96. See also Raleghi=20

admiranda Descriptio Regni Guianae, auri abundantissimi, Hondius Noribergae=
 1599.)  The river=20

Atabapo presents throughout a peculiar aspect; you see nothing of its real =
banks formed by flat=20

lands eight or ten feet high; they are concealed by a row of palms, and sma=
ll trees with slender=20



trunks, the roots of which are bathed by the waters. There are many crocodi=
les from the point=20

where you quit the Orinoco to the mission of San Fernando, and their presen=
ce indicates that this=20

part of the river belongs to the Rio Guaviare and not to the Atabapo. In th=
e real bed of the latter=20

river, above the mission of San Fernando, there are no crocodiles: we find =
there some bavas, a=20

great many fresh-water dolphins, but no manatees. We also seek in vain on t=
hese banks for the=20

thick-nosed tapir, the araguato, or great howling monkey, the zamuro, or Vu=
ltur aura, and the=20

crested pheasant, known by the name of guacharaca. Enormous water-snakes, i=
n shape=20

resembling the boa, are unfortunately very common, and are dangerous to Ind=
ians who bathe. We=20

saw them almost from the first day we embarked, swimming by the side of our=
 canoe; they were at=20

most twelve or fourteen feet long. The jaguars of the banks of the Atabapo =
and the Temi are large=20

and well fed; they are said, however, to be less daring than the jaguars of=
 the Orinoco.  The night=20

of the 27th was beautiful; dark clouds passed from time to time over the ze=
nith with extreme=20

rapidity. Not a breath of wind was felt in the lower strata of the atmosphe=
re; the breeze was at the=20

height of a thousand toises. I dwell upon this peculiarity; for the movemen=
t we saw was not=20

produced by the counter-currents (from west to east) which are sometimes th=
ought to be observed=20

in the torrid zone on the loftiest mountains of the Cordilleras; it was the=
 effect of a real breeze, an=20

east wind. We left the conucos of Guapasoso at two o'clock; and continued t=
o ascend the river=20

toward the south, finding it (or rather that part of its bed which is free =
from trees) growing more and=20

more narrow. It began to rain toward sunrise. In these forests, which are l=
ess inhabited by animals=20

than those of the Orinoco, we no longer heard the howlings of the monkeys. =
The dolphins, or=20

toninas, sported by the side of our boat. According to the relation of Mr. =
Colebrooke, the Delphinus=20

gangeticus, which is the fresh-water porpoise of the Old World, in like man=
ner accompanies the=20

boats that go up towards Benares; but from Benares to the point where the G=
anges receives the=20

salt waters is only two hundred leagues, while from the Atabapo to the mout=
h of the Orinoco is=20

more than three hundred and twenty.  About noon we passed the mouth of the =
little river=20

Ipurichapano on the east, and afterwards the granitic rock, known by the na=
me of Piedra del Tigre.=20

Between the fourth and fifth degrees of latitude, a little to the south of =
the mountains of Sipapo, we=20

reach the southern extremity of that chain of cataracts, which I proposed, =
in a memoir published in=20

1800, to call the Chain of Parima. At 4 degrees 20 minutes it stretches fro=
m the right bank of the=20

Orinoco toward the east and east-south-east. The whole of the land extendin=
g from the mountains=20

of the Parima towards the river Amazon, which is traversed by the Atabapo, =
the Cassiquiare, and=20

the Rio Negro, is an immense plain, covered partly with forests, and partly=
 with grass. Small rocks=20

rise here and there like castles. We regretted that we had not stopped to r=
est near the Piedra del=20

Tigre; for on going up the Atabapo we had great difficulty to find a spot o=
f dry ground, open and=20

spacious enough to light a fire, and place our instrument and our hammocks.=
  On the 28th of April,=20

it rained hard after sunset, and we were afraid that our collections would =
be damaged. The poor=20

missionary had his fit of tertian fever, and besought us to re-embark immed=
iately after midnight.=20

We passed at day-break the Piedra and the Raudalitos* (* The rock and littl=
e cascades.) of=20

Guarinuma. The rock is on the east bank; it is a shelf of granite, covered =
with psora, cladonia, and=20

other lichens. I could have fancied myself transported to the north of Euro=
pe, to the ridge of the=20

mountains of gneiss and granite between Freiberg and Marienberg in Saxony. =
The cladonias=20

appeared to me to be identical with the Lichen rangiferinus, the L. pixidat=
us, and the L.=20



polymorphus of Linnaeus. After having passed the rapids of Guarinuma, the I=
ndians showed us in=20

the middle of the forest, on our right, the ruins of the mission of Mendaxa=
ri, which has been long=20

abandoned. On the east bank of the river, near the little rock of Kemarumo,=
 in the midst of Indian=20

plantations, a gigantic bombax* (* Bombax ceiba.) attracted our curiosity. =
We landed to measure=20

it; the height was nearly one hundred and twenty feet, and the diameter bet=
ween fourteen and=20

fifteen. This enormous specimen of vegetation surprised us the more, as we =
had till then seen on=20

the banks of the Atabapo only small trees with slender trunks, which from a=
far resembled young=20

cherry-trees. The Indians assured that these small trees do not form a very=
 extensive group. They=20

are checked in their growth by the inundations of the river; while the dry =
grounds near the=20

Atabapo, the Temi, and the Tuamini, furnish excellent timber for building. =
These forests do not=20

stretch indefinitely to the east and west, toward the Cassiquiare and the G=
uaviare; they are=20

bounded by the open savannahs of Manuteso, and the Rio Inirida. We found it=
 difficult in the=20

evening to stem the current, and we passed the night in a wood a little abo=
ve Mendaxari; which is=20

another granitic rock traversed by a stratum of quartz. We found in it a gr=
oup of fine crystals of=20

black schorl.  On the 29th, the air was cooler. We had no zancudos, but the=
 sky was constantly=20

clouded, and without stars. I began to regret the Lower Orinoco. We still a=
dvanced but slowly from=20

the force of the current, and we stopped a great part of the day to seek fo=
r plants. It was night=20

when we arrived at the mission of San Balthasar, or, as the monks style it,=
 the mission of la divina=20

Pastora de Balthasar de Atabapo. We were lodged with a Catalonian missionar=
y, a lively and=20

agreeable man, who displayed in these wild countries the activity that char=
acterises his nation. He=20

had planted a garden, where the fig-tree of Europe was found in company wit=
h the persea, and the=20

lemon-tree with the mammee. The village was built with that regularity whic=
h, in the north of=20

Germany, and in protestant America, we find in the hamlets of the Moravian =
brethren; and the=20

Indian plantations seemed better cultivated than elsewhere. Here we saw for=
 the first time that=20

white and fungous substance which I have made known by the name of dapicho =
and zapis.* (*=20

These two words belong to the Poimisano and Paragini tongues.) We immediate=
ly perceived that=20

it was analogous to india-rubber; but, as the Indians made us understand by=
 signs, that it was=20

found underground, we were inclined to think, till we arrived at the missio=
n of Javita, that the=20

dapicho was a fossil caoutchouc, though different from the elastic bitumen =
of Derbyshire. A=20

Pomisano Indian, seated by the fire in the hut of the missionary, was emplo=
yed in reducing the=20

dapicho into black caoutchouc. He had spitted several bits on a slender sti=
ck, and was roasting=20

them like meat. The dapicho blackens in proportion as it grows soft, and be=
comes elastic. The=20

resinous and aromatic smell which filled the hut, seemed to indicate that t=
his coloration is the=20

effect of the decomposition of a carburet of hydrogen, and that the carbon =
appears in proportion=20

as the hydrogen burns at a low heat. The Indian beat the softened and black=
ened mass with a=20

piece of brazil-wood, formed at one end like a club; he then kneaded the da=
picho into balls of=20

three or four inches in diameter, and let it cool. These balls exactly rese=
mble the caoutchouc of the=20

shops, but their surface remains in general slightly viscous. They are used=
 at San Balthasar in the=20

Indian game of tennis, which is celebrated among the inhabitants of Uruana =
and Encaramada;=20

they are also cut into cylinders, to be used as corks, and are far preferab=
le to those made of the=20

bark of the cork-tree.  This use of caoutchouc appeared to us the more wort=
hy notice, as we had=20

been often embarrassed by the want of European corks. The great utility of =
cork is fully=20



understood in countries where trade has not supplied this bark in plenty. E=
quinoctial America=20

nowhere produces, not even on the back of the Andes, an oak resembling the =
Quercus suber; and=20

neither the light wood of the bombax, the ochroma, and other malvaceous pla=
nts, nor the rhachis=20

of maize, of which the natives make use, can well supply the place of our c=
orks. The missionary=20

showed us, before the Casa de los Solteros (the house where the young unmar=
ried men reside), a=20

drum, which was a hollow cylinder of wood, two feet long and eighteen inche=
s thick. This drum=20

was beaten with great masses of dapicho, which served as drumsticks; it had=
 openings which=20

could be stopped by the hand at will, to vary the sounds, and was fixed on =
two light supports.=20

Savage notions love noisy music; the drum and the botuto, or trumpet of bak=
ed earth, in which a=20

tube of three or four feet long communicates with several barrels, are indi=
spensable instruments=20

among the Indians for their grand pieces of music.  The night of the 30th o=
f April was sufficiently=20

fine for observing the meridian heights of x of the Southern Cross, and the=
 two large stars in the=20

feet of the Centaur. I found the latitude of San Balthasar 3 degrees 14 min=
utes 23 seconds. Horary=20

angles of the sun gave 70 degrees 14 minutes 21 seconds for the longitude b=
y the chronometer.=20

The dip of the magnetic needle was 27.8 degrees (cent div). We left the mis=
sion at a late hour in=20

the morning, and continued to go up the Atabapo for five miles; then, inste=
ad of following that river=20

to its source in the east, where it bears the name of Atacavi, we entered t=
he Rio Temi. Before we=20

reached its confluence, a granitic eminence on the western bank, near the m=
outh of the=20

Guasacavi, fixed our attention: it is called Piedra de la Guahiba (Rock of =

 Piedra de la Madre=20

(Mother's Rock.) We inquired the cause of so singular a denomination. Fathe=
r Zea could not=20

satisfy our curiosity; but some weeks after, another missionary, one of the=
 predecessors of that=20

ecclesiastic, whom we found settled at San Fernando as president of the mis=
sions, related to us=20

an event which excited in our minds the most painful feelings. If, in these=
 solitary scenes, man=20

scarcely leaves behind him any trace of his existence, it is doubly humilia=
ting for a European to=20

see perpetuated by so imperishable a monument of nature as a rock, the reme=
mbrance of the=20

moral degradation of our species, and the contrast between the virtue of a =
savage, and the=20

barbarism of civilized man!  In 1797 the missionary of San Fernando had led=
 his Indians to the=20

banks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those hostile incursions which are pro=
hibited alike by religion=20



and the Spanish laws. They found in an Indian hut a Guahiba woman with her =
three children (two=20

of whom were still infants), occupied in preparing the flour of cassava. Re=
sistance was impossible;=20

the father was gone to fish, and the mother tried in vain to flee with her =
children. Scarcely had she=20

reached the savannah when she was seized by the Indians of the mission, who=
 hunt human=20

beings, like the Whites and the Negroes in Africa. The mother and her child=
ren were bound, and=20

dragged to the bank of the river. The monk, seated in his boat, waited the =
issue of an expedition of=20

which he shared not the danger. Had the mother made too violent a resistanc=
e the Indians would=20

have killed her, for everything is permitted for the sake of the conquest o=
f souls (la conquista=20

espirituel), and it is particularly desirable to capture children, who may =
be treated in the Mission as=20

poitos, or slaves of the Christians. The prisoners were carried to San Fern=
ando, in the hope that=20

the mother would be unable to find her way back to her home by land. Separa=
ted from her other=20

children who had accompanied their father on the day in which she had been =
carried off, the=20

unhappy woman showed signs of the deepest despair. She attempted to take ba=
ck to her home=20

the children who had been seized by the missionary; and she fled with them =
repeatedly from the=20

village of San Fernando. But the Indians never failed to recapture her; and=
 the missionary, after=20

having caused her to be mercilessly beaten, took the cruel resolution of se=
parating the mother=20

from the two children who had been carried off with her. She was conveyed a=
lone to the missions=20

of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly bound, she was seated at t=
he bow of the boat,=20

ignorant of the fate that awaited her; but she judged by the direction of t=
he sun, that she was=20

removing farther and farther from her hut and her native country. She succe=
eded in breaking her=20

bonds, threw herself into the water, and swam to the left bank of the Ataba=
po. The current carried=20

her to a shelf of rock, which bears her name to this day. She landed and to=
ok shelter in the woods,=20

but the president of the missions ordered the Indians to row to the shore, =
and follow the traces of=20

the Guahiba. In the evening she was brought back. Stretched upon the rock (=
la Piedra de la=20

Madre) a cruel punishment was inflicted on her with those straps of manatee=
 leather, which serve=20

for whips in that country, and with which the alcaldes are always furnished=
. This unhappy woman,=20

her hands tied behind her back with strong stalks of mavacure, was then dra=
gged to the mission of=20

Javita.  She was there thrown into one of the caravanserais, called las Cas=
as del Rey. It was the=20

rainy season, and the night was profoundly dark. Forests till then believed=
 to be impenetrable=20

separated the mission of Javita from that of San Fernando, which was twenty=
-five leagues distant=20

in a straight line. No other route is known than that by the rivers; no man=
 ever attempted to go by=20

land from one village to another. But such difficulties could not deter a m=
other, separated from her=20

children. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded in the caravanserai. Her arms =
being wounded, the=20

Indians of Javita had loosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and the=
 alcaldes. Having=20

succeeded by the help of her teeth in breaking them entirely, she disappear=
ed during the night;=20

and at the fourth sunrise was seen at the mission of San Fernando, hovering=
 around the hut where=20

her children were confined. "What that woman performed," added the missiona=
ry, who gave us=20

this sad narrative, "the most robust Indian would not have ventured to unde=
rtake!" She traversed=20

the woods at a season when the sky is constantly covered with clouds, and t=
he sun during whole=20

days appears but for a few minutes. Did the course of the waters direct her=
 way? The inundations=20

of the rivers forced her to go far from the banks of the main stream, throu=
gh the midst of woods=20

where the movement of the water is almost imperceptible. How often must she=
 have been stopped=20



by the thorny lianas, that form a network around the trunks they entwine! H=
ow often must she have=20

swum across the rivulets that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate woman =
was asked how she=20

had sustained herself during four days. She said that, exhausted with fatig=
ue, she could find no=20

other nourishment than those great black ants called vachacos, which climb =
the trees in long=20

bands, to suspend on them their resinous nests. We pressed the missionary t=
o tell us whether the=20

Guahiba had peacefully enjoyed the happiness of remaining with her children=
; and if any=20

repentance had followed this excess of cruelty. He would not satisfy our cu=
riosity; but at our return=20

from the Rio Negro we learned that the Indian mother was again separated fr=
om her children, and=20

sent to one of the missions of the Upper Orinoco. There she died, refusing =
all kind of nourishment,=20

as savages frequently do in great calamities.  Such is the remembrance anne=
xed to this fatal rock,=20

the Piedra de la Madre. In this relation of my travels I feel no desire to =
dwell on pictures of=20

individual suffering--evils which are frequent wherever there are masters a=
nd slaves, civilized=20

Europeans living with people in a state of barbarism, and priests exercisin=
g the plenitude of=20

arbitrary power over men ignorant and without defence. In describing the co=
untries through which I=20

passed, I generally confine myself to pointing out what is imperfect, or fa=
tal to humanity, in their=20

civil or religious institutions. If I have dwelt longer on the Rock of the =
Guahiba, it was to record an=20

affecting instance of maternal tenderness in a race of people so long calum=
niated; and because I=20

thought some benefit might accrue from publishing a fact, which I had from =
the monks of San=20

Francisco, and which proves how much the system of the missions calls for t=
he care of the=20

legislator.  Above the mouth of the Guasucavi we entered the Rio Temi, the =
course of which is=20

from south to north. Had we continued to ascend the Atabapo, we should have=
 turned to east-

south-east, going farther from the banks of the Guainia or Rio Negro. The T=

peaches, and a new species of bache, or mauritia, its trunk bristled with t=
horns, rise amid smaller=20

trees, the vegetation of which appears to be retarded by the continuance of=
 the inundations. The=20

Mauritia aculeata is called by the Indians juria or cauvaja; its leaves are=
 in the form of a fan, and=20

they bend towards the ground. At the centre of every leaf, no doubt from th=

short and very thick trunks. The thorns are not slender and long like those=
 of the corozo and other=20

thorny palm-trees; but on the contrary, very woody, short, and broad at the=
 base, like the thorns of=20

the Hura crepitans. On the banks of the Atabapo and the Temi, this palm-tre=
e is distributed in=20

groups of twelve or fifteen stems, close together, and looking as if they r=
ose from the same root.=20

These trees resemble in their appearance, form, and scarcity of leaves, the=
 fan-palms and=20

palmettos of the Old World. We remarked that some plants of the juria were =
entirely destitute of=20

fruit, and others exhibited a considerable quantity; this circumstance seem=

of separate sexes.  Wherever the Rio Temi forms=20
