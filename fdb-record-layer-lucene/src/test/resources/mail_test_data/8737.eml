ned voice. "It is a little diplomatic errand you _
you," and he handed his nephew a substantial sum.  The boys took a last loo=
k at the aeroplane,=20

and bidding Mr. Swaim good-by, set off on a long tramp over the mountain fo=
r their camp.=20

Fortunately the weather was fine, and they were not hampered by any storm, =
so they reached=20

their tent late that afternoon.  "Jugitback?" asked Budge, as calmly as if =
they had been gone only=20

an hour or so, and he pulled out a long string of gum, and began to work it=
 back into his mouth=20

again.  "Yes, we're here," said Jack. "Did you and Long Gun get along all r=
ight?"=20

"Sure'syou'reafoothigh."  "Well, we'll soon begin packing for home----"  "H=
ome? You mean Pryor's=20

Gap, I guess," exclaimed Nat. "You're not going without seeing Mabel; are y=
ou?"  "That's none of=20

your affair," retorted Jack, his face reddening under his tan.  "We ought t=
o have one more hunt=20

before we go," said Sam.  "That's what," put in Bony, and Jack agreed.  The=
y spent two days more=20

tramping over the mountains after game. Will killed a fair-sized bear, Nat =
got a large deer, and=20

Jack bowled over a great ram, that had a fine pair of horns, which our hero=
 declared he was=20

perfectly satisfied with, as they would appropriately fill a certain space =
on the wall of his room.=20

"And now," he said, as they were gathered mentioned when she wanted to seem=
 indifferent to the=20

subject of our conversation. But I was listening with all my might for what=
 was to come.  "Better=20

lock the door, if you please, Dundas," said a voice, which gave me a shock =
of surprise, though I=20

knew it well.  Instead of Di, it was the Foreign Secretary who spoke.  "We =
won't run the risk of=20

interruptions," he went on, with that slow, clear enunciation of his which =
most Oxford men have,=20

and keep all their lives, especially men of the college that was his--Balli=
ol. "I told Mountstuart that I=20

wanted a private chat with you. Beyond that, he knows nothing, nor does any=
one else except=20

myself. You understand that this conversation of ours, whether anything com=
es of it or not, is=20

entirely confidential. I have a proposal to make. You'll agree to it or not=
, as you choose. But if you=20

don't agree, forget it, with everything I may have said."  "My services and=
 my memory are both at=20

your disposal," answered Ivor, in such a gay, happy voice that something to=
ld me he had already=20

talked with Diana--and that in spite of me she had not snubbed him. "I am h=
onoured--I won't say=20

flattered, for I'm too much in earnest--that you should place any confidenc=
e in me."  I lay there=20
