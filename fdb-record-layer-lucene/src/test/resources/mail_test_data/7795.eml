1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of 

works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing 

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the 

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.  1.F. 

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do 

copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project 

Gutenberg-tm collection.  Despite these efforts, Project made wadding for the cannons.  The 

English fire grew hotter every day from the 150 cannon which had been planted upon the walls. 

All depended now on the reinforcements of troops expected by both sides from England and from 

France.  Whichever arrived first would settle the question of victory.  It was on a bright May 

morning, as Murray sat pondering over his despatches at headquarters, that an officer burst in to 

tell him that a ship of war had been sighted far down the river.  The news spread through the town; 

all were divided between hope and fear.  Was this warship French or was she English? Every eye

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party colours at her mast-head.  Slowly, slowly 

she drew near, and then hurrah! there unfurled to the wind the crimson flag of England, and the 

first boom of a salute of twenty-one guns reverberated across the mighty river.  She turned out to 

be the _Lowestoft_ bringing news that a British squadron was at the mouth of the St. Lawrence 

and would reach Quebec in a few days.  "The gladness of the troops," wrote home one of the 

{229} garrison, "is not to be expressed.  Both officers and soldiers mounted the parapet in the face 

of the enemy and huzzaed, with their hats in the air, for almost an hour.  The

squadron had been first, what a shock to their spirits, what a test of their endurance, which they

a deadly chill.  He
