with the objection, it was said that it should not be withdrawn by the Cour=
t from the consideration=20

of the jury or its value commented on as matter of law.[445]  In Michigan, =
it has been said that a=20

commissioner, whose ordinary duty is to take all evidence offered, should r=
efuse to take this=20

privileged evidence; and that it should be stricken out without motion by t=
he judge when returned=20

by the commissioner, and that the physician should not be allowed to violat=
e the privilege.[446] It=20

has also been held that an order for the compulsory physical examination of=
 a person by a=20

physician for the purpose of testifying should not be granted, and that evi=
dence so obtained should=20

be stricken out, but on the ground that it was a violation of personal libe=
rty, rather than of statutory=20

privilege.[447]  But in New York it has been held that where a person volun=
tarily in an action=20

exhibits an injured part as evidence, the adverse party is entitled to foll=
ow it up by a personal or=20

professional inspection of the injured part.[448]  In Missouri, it has been=
 said that the physician=20

should be told that he is not at liberty to testify as to privileged inform=
ation.[449]  In New York, in=20

an early case in chancery, the chancellor said that a master was wrong in s=
upposing there was=20

legal evidence before him, where a physician had given evidence privileged =
under the=20

statute;[450] but this decision was reversed on appeal, the Court of Errors=
 saying that as no=20

objection was made before the master by a party, the evidence was competent=
 and legal.[451]=20

This question seems to have been settled in New York by the decision in _Ho=
yt v. Hoyt_,[452] that=20

the law does not prohibit the examination of a physician but it prohibits t=
he evidence being=20

received in the face of objection, so that if no objection is made by a par=
ty it is not the province of=20

the Court to reject the evidence.  Where it appears that privileged informa=
tion was improperly=20



admitted, it is not ground for reversal on appeal if it is apparent that th=
e appellant was not injured=20

by its reception.[453]  Where the Court is not empowered to reject the evid=
ence of its own motion,=20

held that a physician will not be ordered to turn over his books of account=
