HIPPIAS: Yes, Socrates, assuredly I am.  SOCRATES: And if some one were to ask you what is 

the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, you would tell him the true answer in a moment, if you pleased? 

HIPPIAS: certainly I should.  SOCRATES: Is not that because you are the wisest and ablest of 

men in these matters?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And being as you are the wisest and ablest 

of men in these matters of calculation, are you not also the best?  HIPPIAS: To be sure, Socrates, 

I am the best.  SOCRATES: And therefore you would be the most able to tell the truth about these 

matters, would you not?  HIPPIAS: Yes, I should.  SOCRATES: And could you speak falsehoods 

about them equally well? I must beg, Hippias, that you will answer me with the same frankness 

and magnanimity which has hitherto characterized you. If a person were to ask you what is the 

sum of 3 multiplied by 700, would not you be the best and most consistent teller of a falsehood, 

having always the power of speaking falsely as you have of speaking truly, about these same 

matters, if you wanted to tell a falsehood, and not to answer truly? Would the ignorant man be 

better able to tell a falsehood in matters of calculation than you would be, if you chose? Might he 

not sometimes stumble upon the truth, when he wanted to tell a lie, because he did not know, 

whereas you who are the wise man, if you wanted to tell a lie would always and consistently lie? 

HIPPIAS: Yes, there you are quite right.  SOCRATES: Does the false man tell lies about other 

things, but not about number, or when he is making a calculation?  HIPPIAS: To be sure; he would 

tell as many lies about number as about other things.  SOCRATES: Then may we further assume, 

Hippias, that there are men who are false about calculation and number?  HIPPIAS: Yes. 

SOCRATES: Who can they be? For you have already admitted that he who is false must have the 

ability to be false: you said, as you will remember, that he who is unable to be false will not be 

false?  HIPPIAS: Yes, I remember; it was so said.  SOCRATES: And were you not yourself just 

now shown to be best able to speak falsely about calculation?  HIPPIAS: Yes; that was another 

thing which was said.  SOCRATES: And are you not likewise said to speak truly about calculation? 

HIPPIAS: Certainly.  SOCRATES: Then the same person is able to speak both falsely and truly 

about calculation? And that person is he who is good at calculation--the arithmetician?  HIPPIAS: 

Yes.  SOCRATES: Who, then, Hippias, is discovered to be false at calculation? Is he not the good 

man? For the good man is the able man, and he is the true man.  HIPPIAS: That is evident. 

SOCRATES: Do you not see, then, that the same man is false and also true about the same 

matters? And the true man is not a whit better than the false; for indeed he is the same with him 

and not the very opposite, as you were just now imagining.  HIPPIAS: Not in that instance, clearly. 

SOCRATES: Shall we examine other instances?  HIPPIAS: Certainly, if you are disposed. 

SOCRATES: Are you not also skilled in geometry?  HIPPIAS: I am.  SOCRATES: Well, and does 

not the same hold in that science also? Is not the same person best able to speak falsely or to 

speak truly about diagrams; and he is--the geometrician?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: He and no 

one else is good at it?  HIPPIAS: Yes, he and no one else.  SOCRATES: Then the good and wise 

geometer has this double power in the highest degree; and if there be a man who is false about 

diagrams the good man will be he, for he is able to be false; whereas the bad is unable, and for 

this reason is not false, as has been admitted.  HIPPIAS: True.  SOCRATES: Once more--let us 

examine a third case; that of the programmes; he wanted to begin the experiment with Hofmann's 

appearance that week.  This was a novel thought to Bok: why eliminate encores from any concert? 

If he liked the way any performer played, he had always done his share to secure an encore.  Why 



should not the public have an encore if it desired it, and why should a conductor or a performer 

object?  Hofmann explained to him the entity of a symphonic programme; that it was made up with 

one composition in relation to the others as a sympathetic unit, and that an encore was an 

intrusion, disturbing the harmony of the whole.  "I wish you would let Stokowski come out and 

explain to you what he is trying to do," said Hofmann.  "He knows what he wants, and he is right in 

his efforts; but he doesn't know how to educate the public.  There is where you could help him." 

But Bok had no desire to meet Stokowski.  He mentally pictured the conductor: long hair; feet 

never touching the earth; temperament galore; he knew them!  And he had no wish to introduce 

the type into his home life.  Mrs. Bok, however, ably seconded Josef Hofmann, and endeavored to 

dissipate Bok's preconceived notion, with the result that Stokowski came to the Bok home.  Bok 

was not slow to see Stokowski was quite the reverse of his mental picture, and became intensely 

interested in the youthful conductor's practical way of looking at things.  It was agreed that the 

encore "bull" was to be taken by the horns that week; that no matter what the ovation to Hofmann 

might be, however the public might clamor, no encore was to be forthcoming; and Bok was to give 

the public an explanation during the following week.  The next concert was to present Mischa 

Elman, and his co-operation was assured so that continuity of effort might be counted upon.  In 

order to have first-hand information, Bok attended the concert that Saturday evening.  The 

symphony, Dvorak's "New World Symphony," amazed Bok by its beauty; he was more astonished 

that he could so easily grasp any music in symphonic form.  He was equally surprised at the 

simple beauty of the other numbers on the programme, and wondered not a little at his own 

perfectly absorbed attention during Hofmann's playing of a rather long concerto.  The pianist's 

performance was so beautiful that the audience was uproarious in its approval; it had calculated, 

of course, upon an encore, and recalled the pianist again and again until he had appeared and 

bowed his thanks several times.  But there was no encore; the stage hands appeared and moved 

the piano to one side, and the audience relapsed into unsatisfied and rather bewildered silence. 

Then followed Bok's publicity work in the newspapers, beginning the next day, exonerating 

Hofmann and explaining the situation.  The following week, with Mischa Elman as soloist, the 

audience once more tried to have its way and its cherished encore, but again none was 

forthcoming.  Once more the newspapers explained; the battle was won, and the no-encore rule 

has prevailed at the Philadelphia Orchestra concerts from that day to this, with the public entirely 

resigned to the idea and satisfied with the reason therefor.  But the bewildered Bok could not 

make out exactly what had happened to his preconceived notion about symphonic music.  He 

attended the following Saturday evening concert; listened to a Brahms symphony that pleased him 

even more than had "The New World," and when, two weeks later, he heard the Tschaikowski 

"Pathetique" and later the "Unfinished" symphony, by Schubert, and a Beethoven symphony, 

attracted by each in turn, he realized that his prejudice against the whole question of symphonic 

music had been both wrongly conceived and baseless.  He now

astronomer, in whose art, again, you, Hippias, profess to be a still greater proficient than in the 

preceding--do you not?  HIPPIAS: Yes, I am.  SOCRATES: And does not the same hold of 

astronomy?  HIPPIAS: True, Socrates.  SOCRATES: And in astronomy, too, if any man be able to 

speak falsely he will be the good astronomer, but he who is not able will not speak falsely, for he 

has no knowledge.  HIPPIAS: Clearly not.  SOCRATES: Then in astronomy also, the same man 

will be true and false?  HIPPIAS: It would seem so.  SOCRATES: And now, Hippias, consider the 

question at large about all the sciences, and see whether the same principle does not always hold. 

I know that in most arts you are the wisest of men, as I have heard you boasting in the agora at 

the to that time had been closed to him, and he made up his mind that he would enter it. 

Somehow or other, he found the appeal of music did not confine itself to women; it seemed to 

have a message for men.  Then, too, instead of dreading the approach of Saturday evenings, he 

was looking forward to them, and invariably so arranged his engagements that they might not 

interfere with his attendance at the orchestra concerts.  After a busy week, he discovered that 

nothing he had ever experienced served to quiet him so much as these end-of-the-week concerts. 

They were not too long, an hour and a half at the utmost; and, above all, except now and then, 

when the conductor would take a flight into the world of Bach, he found he followed him with at 

least a
