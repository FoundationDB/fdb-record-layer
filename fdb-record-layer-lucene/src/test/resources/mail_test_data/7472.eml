dracaena marginata  GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.  Strychnine--sixteen grains!  THE DEAN.  I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night. [_Taking the remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me!  BLORE.

with the possible exception of my own!  SHEBA.  [_Sobbing._] We always knew a little more than 

you gave us credit for, Papa.  THE DEAN.  [_Handing SHEBA the bill._] Take this horrid thing--

never let it meet my eyes again. As for the scandalous costumes, they shall be raffled for in aid of 

local charities. Confidence, that precious pearl in the snug shell of domesticity, is at an end 

between us. I chastise you both by permanently withholding from you the reason of my absence 

from home last night. Go!  [_The girls totter out as SIR TRISTRAM enters quickly at the window, 

followed by GEORGIANA, carrying the basin containing the bolus. SIR TRISTRAM has an opened 

letter in his hand._  SIR TRISTRAM.  Good heavens, Jedd! the analysis has arrived!  THE DEAN. 

I am absolutely indifferent!  GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.  Indifferent!  THE DEAN.  [_To 

GEORGIANA._] How dare you confront me without even the semblance of a blush--you who have 

enabled my innocent babies, for the first time in their lives, to discharge one of their own accounts. 

GEORGIANA.  There isn't a blush in our family--if there were, you'd want it.  [_SHEBA and 

SALOME appear outside the window, looking in._  SIR TRISTRAM.  Jedd, you were once my 

friend, and you are to be my relative.  THE DEAN.  [_Looking at GEORGIANA._] My sister! [_To 

SIR TRISTRAM._] I offer no opposition.  SIR TRISTRAM.  But not even our approaching family tie 

prevents my designating you as one of the most atrocious conspirators known in the history of the 

Turf.  THE DEAN.  Conspirator!  SIR TRISTRAM.  As the owner of one-half of Dandy Dick, I 

denounce you!  GEORGIANA.  As the owner of the other half, _I_ denounce you!  THE DEAN. 

You!  _SHEBA and SALOME enter, and remain standing in the recess, listening._  SIR 

TRISTRAM.  The chief ingredient of your infernal regular steamer.  She had a cabin twelve feet 

long, whose broad divans could be changed into berths for the four principal personages on board 

of her. Abaft this apartment was a standing-room with seating accommodations for eight persons, 

or twelve with a little crowding, with luxurious cushions and an awning overhead when needed. 

Her pilot-house, engine-room, galley, and forecastle were as regular as though she had been an 

ocean steamer of a thousand tons. Her ordinary speed was ten knots an hour; but she could be 

driven up to twelve on an emergency, and had even made a trifle more than this when an 

extraordinary effort was required of the craft.  She had been built for a Moorish Pacha of the 

highest rank and of unbounded wealth, who had ordered that no expense should be spared in her 

construction and outfit. She was built of steel as strong as it was possible to build a vessel of any 

kind; and in more than one heavy gale on the Mediterranean she had proved herself to be an 

unusually able and weatherly craft.  Though she had formerly been called the Salihe, her name 

had been changed by her later American owners to the Maud. Everything about her was as 

luxurious as it was substantial. She had a ship's company of seven persons, only two of whom 

had reached and passed their majority, the other five varying in age from fifteen to eighteen.  The 

principal personages were boys, three of them having attained the mature age of eighteen, while 

the fourth was only fifteen. This quartet sometimes called themselves the "Big Four," though it was 

a borrowed designation, meaning something entirely different from its present signification. 

Captain Scott had been the first to apply the term; and he had done so simply because it tickled 

the tympanum of his ear, and it really meant nothing at all.  The

THE DEAN.  It contains nothing that I would not cheerfully administer to my own children. 

GEORGIANA.  [_In horror._] Oh!  SIR TRISTRAM.  I believe you. [_Pointing to the paper._] 

Strychnine! Sixteen grains!  SALOME _and_ SHEBA.  [_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh! 

THE DEAN.  Strychnine! Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the innocuous 

mixture was Guardian-Mother, a steam-yacht of over six hundred tons' burden, now engaged in 

making a voyage around the world. In a preceding volume it was related in what manner Louis 

Belgrave became a millionaire, with fifty per cent more than money enough to entitle him to this 

rather indefinite appellation. How he happened to be the proprietor of one of the finest steam-

yachts that ever

girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the pardonable result of over-

enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist.  GEORGIANA.  You're a disgrace to the pretty little 

police station where you slept last night!  [_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._  THE DEAN.  I 

will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of hospitality have never been 

transgressed. Give me the bowl! [_GEORGIANA hands THE DEAN the basin from the table._] A 

simple remedy for a explained, through a somewhat complicated narrative, and the details of a 

cruise to Bermuda, the Bahama Islands, and Cuba, followed by a voyage across the Atlantic and 

up the Mediterranean, the steamer and her tender having just sailed from Alexandria after the tour 

of Egypt.  The ship, as the larger steamer was generally called to distinguish her from the smaller 

one, was the Guardian-Mother. This may be regarded as rather an odd name for a steamship, but 

it had been selected
