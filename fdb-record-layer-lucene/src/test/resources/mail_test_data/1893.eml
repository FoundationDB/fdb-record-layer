king met Loys de Boisbourdon, whom he knew to be one of Isabeau's associate=

suspicious and resolved to know the whole truth, Charles had him arrested a=

(_i.e._,=20

of his afflickshun, and made a fool of him, hushers and all.  After he grow=

say all sorts of funny things; and, when he was old enuff, he was promoted =
to the dignity of a full-

he was playing one of a sympathy, was not ended, for he sent the queen and =

 From this time, we find=20

Isabeau intriguing with the Duke of Burgundy. As Jean was marching upon Par=
