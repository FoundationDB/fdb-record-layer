 to a daughter who, though not unloving, loved with a temperate heart; fait=
hful to friends, loyal to those who had fallen into misfortune, but neither=
 sentimental nor romantic, nor disposed to the generosities of a universal =

Bane,[74]       By whom protection to the Town[75] is given,     By whom th=

be shorn,       The heart unshorn, why should man shave him?     But he who=
se inmost heart is=20

shorn       Needs not the shaven head to save him.                     3  I=
 have dyed this robe of mine=20

yellow. And now I will go into the garden of the king's brother-in-law, was=
h it in the pond, and go=20

away as soon as I can. [_He walks about and washes the robe._]  _A voice be=
hind the scenes._=20

Shtop, you confounded monk, shtop!  _Monk._ [_Discovers the speaker. Fearfu=
lly._ ] Heaven help=20

me! Here is the king's brother-in-law, Sansthanaka. Just because one monk c=
ommitted an=20

offense, now, wherever he sees a monk, whether it is the same one or not, h=
e bores a hole in his=20

nose and drives him around like a bullock. Where shall a defenseless man fi=
nd a defender? But=20

after all, the blessed Lord Buddha is my defender.  [119.90. S.  [_Enter th=
e courtier, carrying a=20

sword, and Sansthanaka._]  _Sansthanaka._  Shtop, you confounded monk, shto=
p! I'll pound your=20

head like a red radish[77] at a drinking party. [_He strikes him._]  _Court=
ier._  You jackass, you=20

should not strike a monk who wears the yellow robes of renunciation. Why he=
ed him? Look rather=20

upon this garden, which offers itself to pleasure.      To creatures else f=
orlorn, the forest trees=20

unique literary distinction. His _Maximes_ are the brief confession of his =
experience of life, an=20

utterance of the pessimism of an aristocratic spirit, moulded into a form p=
roper to the little world of=20

the _salon_--each maxim a drop of the attar not of roses but of some more p=
oignant and bitterly=20

aromatic blossom. In the circle of Mme. de Sable, now an elderly _precieuse=
_, a circle half-

Epicurean, half-Jansenist, frivolously serious and morosely gay, the compos=
ition of maxims and=20

"sentences" became a fashion. Those of La Rochefoucauld were submitted to h=
er as to an oracle;=20

five years were given to shaping a tiny volume; fifteen years to rehandling=
 and polishing every=20

phrase. They are like a collection of medals struck in honour of the conque=
sts of cynicism. The=20

first surreptitious edition, printed in Holland in 1664, was followed by an=
 authorised edition in 1665;=20

the number of maxims, at first 317, rose finally in 1678 to 504; some were =
omitted; many were=20

reduced to the extreme of concision; under the influence of Mme. de la Faye=
tte, in the later texts=20

the indictment of humanity was slightly attenuated. "Il m'a donne de l'espr=
it," said Mme. de la=20

Fayette, "mais j'ai reforme son coeur."  The motto of the book, "Our virtue=
s are commonly vices in=20

disguise," expresses its central idea. La Rochefoucauld does not absolutely=
 deny disinterested=20

goodness; there may be some such instinctive virtue lying below all passion=
s which submit to be=20

analysed; he does not consider the love of God, the parental or the filial =
affections; but=20


_
Do works of mercy, granting joy and ease;     Like a sinner's heart, the pa=
rk unguarded lies,     Like=20

some new-founded realm, an easy prize.                  4  _Monk._  Heaven =
bless you! Be merciful,=20

servant of the Blessed One!  _Sansthanaka._  Did you hear that, shir? He's =
inshulting me.=20

_Courtier._  What does he say?  _Sansthanaka._  Shays I'm a shervant. What =
do you take me=20

for? a barber?  _Courtier._  A servant of the Blessed One he calls you, and=
 this is praise.=20

_Sansthanaka._  Praise me shome more, monk!  _Monk._  You are virtuous! You=
 are a brick!=20

_Sansthanaka._  Shee? He shays I'm virtuous. He shays I'm a brick. What do =
you think I am? a=20

materialistic philosopher? or a watering-trough? or a pot-maker?[78]  _Cour=
tier._  You jackass, he=20

praises you when he says that you are virtuous, that you are a brick.  _San=
sthanaka._  Well, shir,=20

what did he come here for?  _Monk._  To wash this robe.  _Sansthanaka._  Co=
nfound the monk!=20

My shishter's husband gave me the finesht garden there is, the garden Pushp=
akaranda. Dogs and=20

jackals drink the water in thish pond. Now I'm an arishtocrat. I'm a man, a=
nd I don't even take a=20

bath. And here you bring your shtinking clothes, all shtained with shtale b=
ean-porridge, and wash=20

'em! I think one good shtroke will finish you.  P. 187.7]  _Courtier._ You =
jackass, I am sure he has=20

not long been a monk.  _Sansthanaka._ How can you tell, shir?  _Courtier._ =
It doesn't take much=20

to tell that, See!      His hair is newly shorn; the brow still white;     =
  The rough cloak has not yet the=20

shoulder scarred;     He wears it awkwardly; it clings not tight;       And=
 here above, the fit is sadly=20

marred.                   5  _Monk._ True, servant of the Blessed One. I ha=
ve been a monk but a short=20

time.  _Sansthanaka._ Then why haven't you been one all your life? [_He bea=
ts him._]  _Monk._=20

Buddha be praised!  _Courtier._ Stop beating the poor fellow. Leave him alo=
ne. Let him go.=20

_Sansthanaka._ Jusht wait a minute, while I take counshel.  _Courtier._ Wit=
h whom?=20

_Sansthanaka._ With my own heart.  _Courtier._ Poor fellow! Why didn't he e=
scape?=20

_Sansthanaka._ Blesshed little heart, my little shon and mashter, shall the=
 monk go, or shall the=20

monk shtay? [_To himself._] Neither go, nor shtay. [_Aloud._] Well, shir, I=
 took counshel with my=20

heart, and my heart shays--  _Courtier._ Says what?  _Sansthanaka._ He shal=
l neither go, nor=20

shtay. He shall neither breathe up, nor breathe down. He shall fall down ri=
ght here and die, before=20

you can shay "boo."  _Monk._ Buddha be praised! I throw myself upon your pr=
otection.=20

_Courtier._ Let him go.  [114.24. S.  _Sansthanaka._ Well, on one condition=
.  _Courtier._ And=20

what is that?  _Sansthanaka._ He musht shling mud in, without making the wa=
ter dirty. Or better=20

yet, he musht make the water into a ball, and shling it into the mud.  _Cou=
rtier._ What incredible=20

folly!      The patient earth is burdened by       So many a fool, so many =
a drone,     Whose=20

thoughts and deeds are all awry--       These trees of flesh, these forms o=
f stone.                6  [_The=20

monk makes faces at Sansthanaka._]  _Sansthanaka._ What does he mean?  _Cou=
rtier._ He=20

praises you.  _Sansthanaka._ Praise me shome more! Praise me again! [_The m=
onk does so,=20

then exit._]  _Courtier._ See how beautiful the garden is, you jackass.    =
  See yonder trees,=20

adorned with fruit and flowers,       O'er which the clinging creepers inte=
rlace;     The watchmen=20

guard them with the royal powers;       They seem like men whom loving wive=
s embrace.              7=20

_Sansthanaka._ A good deshcription, shir.      The ground is mottled with a=
 lot of flowers;       The=20

blosshom freight bends down the lofty trees;     And, hanging from the leaf=
y tree-top bowers,=20

The monkeys bob, like breadfruit in the breeze.            8  _Courtier._ W=
ill you be seated on this=20

stone bench, you jackass?  _Sansthanaka._ I am sheated. [_They seat themsel=
ves._] Do you=20

know, shir, I remember that Vasantasena even yet. She is like an inshult. I=
 can't get her out of my=20



mind.  _Courtier._ [_Aside._] He remembers her even after such a repulse. F=
or indeed,      The=20

mean man, whom a woman spurns,         But loves the more;     The wise man=
's passion gentler=20

burns,         Or passes o'er.                                          9  =
P. 190.16]  _Sansthanaka._ Shome time=20

has passhed, shir, shince I told my shervant Sthavaraka to take the bullock=
-cart and come as=20

quick as he could. And even yet he is not here. I 've been hungry a long ti=
me, and at noon a man=20

can't go a-foot. For disinterested feeling to self-love. "We all have stren=
gth enough to endure the=20

misfortunes of another;" "When vices desert us, we flatter ourselves with t=
he belief that it is we=20

who desert them;" "With true love it is as with apparitions--every one talk=
s of them, but few=20

persons have seen them;" "Virtues lose themselves in self-interest as river=
s lose themselves in the=20

sea;" "In the adversity of our best friends we always find something which =
does not displease us"--

such are the moral comments on life graven in ineffaceable lines by La Roch=
efoucauld. He is not a=20

philosophic thinker, but he is a penetrating and remorseless critic, who re=
mains at one fixed point=20

of view; self-interest is assuredly a large factor in human conduct, and he=
 exposes much that is=20

real in the heart of man; much also that is not universally true was true o=
f the world in which he=20

had moved; whether we accept or reject his doctrine, we are instructed by a=
 statement so=20

implacable and so precise of the case against human nature as he saw it. Pi=
tiless he was not=20

himself; perhaps his artistic instinct led him to exclude concessions which=
 would have marred the=20

unity of his conception; possibly his vanity co-operated in producing phras=
es which live and=20

circulate by virtue of the shock they communicate to our self-esteem. The m=
erit of his _Maximes_=20

as examples of style--a style which may be described as lapidary--is incomp=
arable; it is impossible=20

to say more, or to say it more adequately, in little; but one wearies in th=
e end of the monotony of=20

an idea unalterably applied, of unqualified brilliance, of unrelieved conci=
sion; we anticipate our=20

surprise, and its purpose is defeated. Traces of preciosity are found in so=
me of the earliest=20

sentences; that infirmity was soon overcome by La Rochefoucauld, and his ut=
terances become as=20

clear and as hard as diamond.  He died at the age of sixty-seven, in the ar=
ms of Bossuet. His=20

_Memoires_,[1] relating to the period of the Fronde, are written with an ai=
r of studied historical=20

coldness, which presents a striking contrast to the brilliant vivacity of R=
etz.  [Footnote 1: Ed. 1662,=20

surreptitious and incomplete; complete ed., 1868-1884.]  The most interesti=
ng figure of the Fronde,=20

its portrait-painter, its analyst, its historian, is CARDINAL DE RETZ (1614=
-1679). Italian by his=20

family, and Italian in some features of his character, he had, on a scale o=
f grandeur, the very=20

genius of conspiracy. When his first work, _La Conjuration de Fiesque_, was=
 read by Richelieu,=20

the judgment which that great statesman pronounced was penetrating--"Voila =
un dangereux=20

esprit." Low of stature, ugly, ill-made, short-sighted, Retz played the par=
t of a gallant and a duellist.=20

Never had any one less vocation for the spiritual duties of an ecclesiastic=
; but, being a churchman,=20

he would be an illustrious actor on the ecclesiastical stage. There was som=
ething demoniac in his=20

audacity, and with the spirit of turbulence and intrigue was united a certa=
in power of self-restraint.=20

When fallen, he still tried to be magnificent, though in disgrace: he would=
 resign his archbishopric,=20

pay his enormous debts, resign his cardinalate, exhibit himself as the hero=
 in misfortune. "Having=20

lived as a Catiline," said Voltaire, "he lived as an Atticus." In retiremen=
t, as his adventurous life=20

drew towards its close, he wrote, at the request of Madame de Caumartin, th=
ose Memoirs which=20

remained unpublished until 1717, and which have insured him a place in lite=
rature only second to=20

Saint-Simon.  It was an age remarkable for its memoirs; those of Mlle. de M=
ontpensier, of Mme. de=20



Motteville, of Bussy-Rabutin are only a few of many. The _Memoires_ of Retz=
 far surpass the rest=20

not only in their historical interest, but in their literary excellence. Ar=
ranging facts and dates so that=20

he might superbly figure in the drama designed for future generations, he f=
alsifies the literal truth=20

of things; but he lays bare the inner truth of politics, of life, of charac=
ter, with incomparable=20

mastery. He exposes the disorder of his conduct in early years with little =
scruple. The origins of the=20

Fronde are expounded in pages of profound sagacity. His narrative has all t=
he impetuosity, all the=20

warmth and hues of life, all the tumult and rumour of action; he paints, bu=
t in painting he explains;=20

he touches the hidden springs of passion; his portraits of contemporaries a=
re not more vivid in=20

their colours than they are searching in their psychology: and in his style=
 there is that negligent=20

grandeur which belongs rather to the days of Louis=20


_
The shun is in the middle of the shky,       And hard to look at as an angr=
y ape;     Like Gandhari,=20

whose hundred shons did die,       The earth is hard dishtresshed and can't=
 eshcape.          10=20

_Courtier._ True.      The cattle all--their cuds let fall--       Lie drow=
sing in the shade;     In heated=20

pool their lips to cool,       Deer throng the woodland glade;     A prey t=
o heat, the city street=20

Makes wanderers afraid;     The cart must shun the midday sun,       And th=
us has been delayed.=20

11  _Sansthanaka._ Yesshir,      Fasht to my head the heated shun-beam clin=
gs;     Birds, flying=20

creatures, alsho winged things     Resht in the branches of the trees, whil=
e men,     People, and=20

pershons shigh and shigh again;     At home they tarry, in their houses sht=
ay,     To bear the heat=20

and burden of the day.                      12  Well, shir, that shervant i=
s n't here yet. I 'm going to shing=20

shomething to passh the time. [_He sings._] There, shir, did you hear what =
I shang?  _Courtier._=20

What shall I say? Ah, how melodious!  [116.23. S.  _Sansthanaka._ Why _shou=
ld n't_ it be=20

malodorous?      Of nut-grass and cumin I make up a pickle,     Of devil's-=
dung, ginger, and orris,=20

and treacle;     That's the mixture of perfumes I eagerly eat;     Why shou=
ld n't my voice be=20

remarkably shweet?                13  Well, shir, I 'm jusht going to shing=
 again, [_He does so._]=20

There, shir, did you hear what I shang?  _Courtier._ What shall I say? Ah, =
how melodious!=20

_Sansthanaka._ Why _should n't_ it be malodorous?      Of the flesh of the =
cuckoo I make up a=20

chowder,     With devil's-dung added, and black pepper powder;     With oil=
 and with butter I=20

shprinkle the meat:     Why should n't my voice be remarkably shweet?      =
          14  But shir, the=20

shervant is n't here yet.  _Courtier._ Be easy in your mind. He will be her=
e presently.  [_Enter=20

Vasantasena in the bullock-cart, and Sthavaraka._]  _Sthavaraka._ I 'm frig=
htened. It is already=20

noon. I hope Sansthanaka, the king's brother-in-law, will not be angry. I g=
rew more exact for the=20

intelligence, but lost much of its passion and untamed energy.  The epistol=
ary art, in which the art=20

itself is nature, may be said to have reached perfection, with scarcely an =
historical development, in=20

the letters of MME. DE SEVIGNE. The letters of Balzac are rhetorical exerci=
ses; those of Voiture=20

are often, to use a word of Shakespeare, "heavy lightness, serious vanity."=
 Mme. de Sevigne=20

entered into the gains of a cultivated society, in which graceful converse =
had become a necessity=20

of existence. She wrote delightfully, because she conveyed herself into her=
 letters, and because=20

she conversed freely and naturally by means of her pen. Marie de Rabutin-Ch=
antal, born in 1626,=20

deprived of both parents in her earliest years, was carefully trained in li=
terary studies--Latin, Italian,=20

French--under the superintendence of her uncle, "le bien bon," the Abbe de =
Coulanges. Among=20

her teachers were the scholar Menage and the poet Chapelain. Married at eig=
hteen to an=20

unworthy husband, the Marquis Henri de Sevigne, she was left at twenty-five=
 a widow with two=20

children, the daughter whom she loved with excess of devotion, and a son, w=
ho received from his=20

mother a calmer affection. She saw the life of the court, she was acquainte=
d with eminent writers,=20

she frequented the Hotel de Rambouillet (retaining from it a touch of preci=
osity, "one superfluous=20

ribbon," says Nisard, "in a simple and elegant toilet"), she knew and loved=
 the country and its rural=20

joys, she read with excellent judgment and eager delight the great books of=
 past and present=20

times.  When her daughter, "the prettiest girl in France," was married in 1=
669 to M. de Grignan,=20

soon to be Lieutenant-General of Provence, Mme. de Sevigne, desiring to be =
constantly one with=20

her, at least in thought, transferred into letters her whole life from day =
to day, together with much=20

of the social life of the time during a period of nearly thirty years. She =
allowed her pen to trot,=20

throwing the reins, as she says, upon its neck; but if her letters are impr=
ovisations, they are=20



improvisations=20


_
faster. Get up, bullocks, get up!  _Vasantasena._ Alas! That is not Vardham=
anaka's voice. What=20

does it mean? I wonder if Charudatta was afraid that the bullocks might bec=
ome weary, and so=20

sent another man with another cart. My right eye twitches. My artistic inst=
inct. Her imagination is=20

alert in discovering, combining, and presenting the happiest meanings of re=
ality. She is gay, witty,=20

ironical, malicious, and all this without a trace of malignity; amiable rat=
her than passionate, except=20
