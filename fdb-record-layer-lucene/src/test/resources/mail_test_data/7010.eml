JUDGE WILLIAM R. FRANCIS.  Former New Jersey State Senator and former Supreme Court 

Judge of Dakota, William R. Francis, died in the City Hospital in Newark, this State, on Dec. 15th 

last, aged 82 years. His death was the result of a fall in the bedroom of his home, 324 S. Orange 

Ave., Newark.  Judge Francis was born in Connecticut. He was a graduate from Oberlin College 

and then came to Newark, where he became a member of the law firm of Titsworth, Francis & 

Marsh. He served as city counsel of Newark from 1871 to 1875 and in the State Senate from 1879 

to 1881. In 1882 Mr. Francis went to Dakota. At that time the two Dakotas were united in a territory 

of the United States. After completing his term as Supreme Court Judge there he became attorney 

for the Northern Pacific Railroad. About twenty years ago he returned to Newark. Mr. Francis was 

a Master in Chancery and had offices with Scharringhausen & Hartpence, 800 Broad street. Mr. 

Francis is survived by a widow, who was Miss Annie Yeomans of Newark. He is also survived by a 

niece, Mrs. C. L. Bryant of Danbury, Conn., and a cousin, Miss Mary Francis, of Newark. 

Transcriber Notes:  Passages in italics were indicated by _underscores_.  Small caps were 

replaced with ALL CAPS.  Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of 

the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.  Errors in punctuations and inconsistent 

hyphenation were not corrected unless otherwise noted.  On page 9, "migh" was replaced with 

"might".  On page 22, the term "plaintiff's term" was obscured by a Google logo.  On page 23, 

"provsion" was replaced with "provision".  On page 27, the phrase "committed by the wife with the 

en-" was moved to the top of the page, since it seemed to be put in the wrong line initially.  On 

page 28, the question mark after "B thereafter refused to make the assignment" was replaced by a 

period  On page 32, "Prinecton" was replaced with "Princeton".      End of Project Gutenberg's The

Water, for a few Hours, till they purge themselves: then put them into fresh Salt and Water, for a 

few Hours more, and repeat that a third time, then give them a gentle boil in Water and. Salt, in 

their Shells, and you may then pick them out, with a Pin, as you do Perwinkles, Then stew them in 

Veal-Broth, with some Cloves, a little Sack, some Mace, and a little Salt. Stew these a little while, 

and then pour over them this Sauce thicken'd with Cream and Butter, and grate some Nutmeg 

upon the Sauce, and serve them hot.    _Snails,_ to be drest with brown Sauce. From the same. 

Take the same sort of Snail, as above mention'd, and clean it as before; then give them one turn, 

when they are flour'd, in some hot Butter, or Lard, and drain them. Then pour into the Pan, when, 

the Liquor is out, some strong Gravey, a Glass of Claret, some Nutmeg, some Spices, and a little 

Salt, with a little Lemon-Peel grated; and when the Sauce is strong enough, then strain the Sauce, 

and thicken it with burnt Butter. Then serve them up hot, with a Garnish of sliced Lemon, and 

some Sippits fry'd in Lard.    A _Gammon_ of a _Badger_ roasted. From Mr. _R. T._ of 



_Leicestershire._  The Badger is one of the cleanest Creatures, in its Food, of any in the World, 

and one may suppose that the Flesh of this Creature is not unwholesome. It eats like the finest 

Pork, and is much sweeter than Pork. Then, just when a Badger is killed, cut off the Gammons, 

and strip them; then lay them in a Brine of Salt and Water, that will bear an Egg, for a Week or ten 

Days; then boil it for four or five Hours, and then roast it, strewing it with Flour and rasped Bread 

sifted. Then put it upon a Spit, as you did before with the _Westphalia_ Ham. Serve it hot with a 

Garnish of Bacon fry'd in Cutlets, and some Lemon in slices.    To make minc'd Pyes, or 

_Christmas-_Pyes. From Mrs. _M. C._  Take an Ox-Heart, and parboil it, or a Neat's-Tongue, 

boil'd without drying or salting, or the Inside of a Surloin of Beef; chop this small, and put to each 

Pound two Pounds of clean Beef-Suet, cleaned of the Skins and Blood, and chop that as small as 

the former; then pare, and take the Cores out of eight large Apples, and chop them small, grate 

then a Two-penny-Loaf; and then add two or three Nutmegs grated, half an Ounce of fresh 

Cloves, as much Mace, a little Pepper and Salt, and a Pound and a half of Sugar; then grate in 

some Lemon and Orange-Peel, and squeeze the Juice of six Oranges, and two Lemons, with half 

a Pint of Sack, and pour this into the Mixture. Take care to put in two Pounds of Currans to every 

Pound of Meat, and mix it well; then try a little of it over the Fire, in a Sauce-pan, and
