philodendron monstera cold in the head gave him much trouble, and unpleasan=
t marks upon the wall exhibited hieroglyphics of recent date, that were ill=
 adapted to the reception-room of an Arab chieftain. In about an hour he de=
parted, and shortly after, a dinner of four dishes was brought. No. 1 was a=
n Arab Irish stew, but alas! MINUS the potatoes; it was very good, neverthe=
less, as the mutton was fat. No. 2 was an Arab stew, with no Irish element;=
 it was very hot with red pepper, and rather dry. No. 3 in the Red Brigade =
as a man who could "stand a'most anything," and who appeared to cherish a m=
artyr-like desire to die by roasting or suffocation.  This was the more sur=
prising that he was not a boastful or excitable fellow, but a silent, melan=
choly, and stern man, who, except when in action, usually seemed to wish to=
 avoid observation.  Most of his comrades were puzzled by this compound of =
character, but some of them hinted that Crashington's wife could have throw=

  At Abou Harraz I=20

discharged my camels, and endeavoured to engage a boat to convey us to Khar=
toum, thus to=20

avoid the dusty and uninteresting ride of upwards of a hundred miles along =
its flat and melancholy=20

banks; but there was not a vessel of any kind to be seen upon the river, ex=
cept one miserable,=20

dirty affair, for which the owner demanded fourteen hundred piastres for a =
passage. We=20

accordingly procured camels, and started, intending to march as rapidly as =
possible.  "June 2,=20

1862.--We packed the camels in the morning and started them off to Rufaar. =
We followed at 2.30=20

P.M. as the natives declared it was half a day's journey; but we did not ar=
rive until 8.30 P.M.=20

having marched about twenty-one miles. The town is considerable, and is the=
 head-quarters of our=20

old friend, the great Sheik Achmet Abou Sinn; he is now absent, but his son=
 Ali is at home. He=20

received us very kindly, and lodged us in his own house within a large incl=
osed court, with a well of=20

good water in the centre. Having read my firman, be paid us the usual compl=
iments, but he lacked=20

the calm dignity and ease of manner of his grand old father. He sat stiffly=
 upon the divan,=20

occasionally relieving the monotony of his position by lifting up the cover=
 of the cushions, and=20

spitting beneath it. Not having a handkerchief, but only the limited natura=
l which he had first=20

broken open, and which, he reflected while descending the escape, was just =
out of range of Bob=20

Clazie's branch.  It was the thought of this that had induced him to hurry =
back so promptly; in time,=20

as we have seen, to relieve his comrade.  He now pointed the branch at the =
precise spot, and hit=20

that part of the fire right in its heart.  The result was that clouds of st=
eam mingled with the smoke.=20

But Joe was human after all.  The atmosphere, or, rather, the want of atmos=
phere, was too much=20

for him.  He was on the point of dropping the branch, and rushing to the wi=
ndow for his life, when=20

Ned Crashington, feeling his way into the room, tumbled over him.  Speech w=
as not required in the=20

circumstances.  Ned knew exactly what to do, and Joe knew that he had been =
sent to relieve him.=20

He therefore delivered the branch to Ned, and at once sprang out on the esc=
ape, where he=20

encountered David Clazie.  "Go in, Davy, he can't stand it long," gasped Jo=
e.  "No fears of 'im,"=20

replied Davy, with a smile, as he prepared to enter the window; "Ned can st=
and hanythink a'most.=20

But, I say, send up some more 'ands.  It takes two on us to 'old _that_ 'er=
e branch, you know."=20

The brass helmets of more hands coming up the escape were observed as he sp=
oke, for the=20

foreman saw that this was a point of danger, and, like a wise general, had =
his reserves up in time.=20

David Clazie found Ned standing=20
