approval.  Curiously enough in musical programs one finds no prejudice against German music in 

London as one finds it in Paris. To get Beethoven in Paris one had to lower the windows, close the 

shutters, pull down the shades and pin the curtains tight. At the symphony concerts in London one 

can hear not only Beethoven, but Wagner, who is almost modern in his aggressive Teutonism. But 

the English have little music of their own, and so long as they have to be borrowing they seem to 

borrow impartially of all their neighbours, the French, the Slavs, the Germans, and the Italians. 

Indeed, even when British opinion of Russia was at its ebb, the London Symphony Orchestra put 

in an afternoon with Tschaicovsky's Fourth Symphony. And yet if, in a few months we could form 

even a vague notion of the public minds of England, and of France, one might say that England 

seemed more implacable than France. In France, where one heard no music but French and 

Italian music in the concerts, at the parks, in opera, one heard a serious discussion going on 

among school teachers about the history to be taught after the war.  Said one side: "Let's tell the 

truth about this war and its horrors. Let's tell of murdered women and children, of ravished homes, 

of itself in an arch from above the barrier. In other cavities, deeper, but less spacious, the rock was 

pierced by the effect of successive filtrations. We saw columns of water, eight or nine inches 

broad, descending from the top of the vault, and finding an issue by clefts, that seemed to 

communicate at great distances with each other.  The cascades of Europe, forming only one fall, 

or several falls close to each other, can never produce such variety in the shifting landscape. This 

variety is peculiar to rapids, to a succession of small cataracts several miles in length, to rivers that 

force their way across rocky dikes and accumulated blocks of granite. We had the opportunity of 

viewing this extraordinary sight longer than we wished. Our boat was to coast the eastern bank of 

a narrow island, and to take us in again after a long circuit. We passed an hour and a half in vain 

expectation of it. Night approached, and with it a tremendous storm. It rained with violence. We 

began to fear that our frail bark had been wrecked against the rocks, and that the Indians, 

conformably to their habitual indifference for the evils of others, had returned tranquilly to the 

mission. There were only three of us: we were completely wet, and uneasy

milestones! Let's tell how German rapacity for land began the war, and kept it up to its awful end." 

Says the other side: "Germany is our permanent neighbour. Our children will have to live with 

Germany, and our children's children to the end of time. War is a horrible thing. Hate breeds war. 

Why not then let the story of this war and its barbarities die with this generation? Why should we 

for ever breed hate into the heart of our people to grow eternally into war?"  England has no such 

questions in her mind. England will surely tell the truth and defy the devil. But the Briton in matters 

of music and the other arts is like 'Omer when he "smote 'is bloomin' lyre"; the Briton also will go 

and take what he may require, without much sentiment in the matter.  But the things that roll off 

the laps of the gods, after humanity has put its destinies there, sometimes are startlingly different 

from the expected fruits of victory. agreeable to pass, without sleep, a long night of the torrid zone 

amid the noise of the Raudales. M. Bonpland proposed to leave me in the island with Don Nicolas 

Soto, and to swim across the branches of the river that are separated by the granitic dikes. He 

hoped to reach the forest, and seek assistance at Atures from Father Zea. We dissuaded him with 

difficulty from undertaking this hazardous enterprise. He knew little of the labyrinth of small 

channels, into which the Orinoco is divided. Most of them have strong whirlpools, and what passed 

before our eyes while we were deliberating on our situation, proved sufficiently that the natives 

had deceived us respecting the absence of crocodiles in the cataracts. The little monkeys which 

we had carried along with us for months were deposited on the point of our island. Wet by the 

rains and sensible of the least lowering of the temperature, these delicate animals sent forth

win the war and get quite another thing. The great war now waging began in a dispute over 

spheres of influence, market extensions, Places in the Sun and Heaven knows what of that sort of 

considerations. Great changes in these matters, of course, must come out of the war. But 

boundaries and markets will fluctuate with the decades and centuries. The important changes that 

will come out of this war--assuming that the Allies win it--will be found in the changed relations of 

men. The changes will be social and economic and they will be institutional and lasting. For 

generally speaking, such changes as attracted to the spot two crocodiles, the size and leaden 

colour of which denoted their great age. Their unexpected appearance made us reflect on the 

danger we had incurred by bathing, at our first passing by the mission of Atures, in the middle of 

the Raudal. After long waiting, the Indians at length arrived at the close of day. The natural coffer-

dam by which they had endeavoured to descend in order to make the circuit of the island, had 

become impassable owing to the shallowness of the water. The pilot sought long for a more 

accessible passage in this labyrinth of rocks and islands. Happily
