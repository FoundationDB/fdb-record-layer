vol. iii., p. 537.   THIS INTERESTING DIALOGUE WAS WRITTEN BY AN AMERICAN A=
BOUT=20

1800  The following dialogue took place between Mr. Jackson the master of a=
 family, and the=20

slave of one of his neighbors who lived adjoining the town, on this occasio=
n. Mr. Jackson was=20

walking through the common and came to a field of this person's farm. He th=
ere saw the slave=20

leaning against the fence with a book in his hand, which he seemed to be ve=
ry intent upon; after a=20

little time he closed the book, and clasping it in both his hands, looked u=
pwards as if engaged in=20

mental prayer; after this, he put the book in his bosom, and walked along t=
he fence near where Mr.=20

Jackson was standing. Surprised at seeing a person of his color engaged wit=
h a book, and still=20

more by the animation and delight that he observed in his countenance; he d=
etermines to enquire=20

about it, and calls to him as he passes.  _Mr. J_. So I see you have been r=
eading, my lad?=20

_Slave_. Yes, sir.  _Mr. J_. Well, I have a great curiosity to see what you=
 were reading so=20

earnestly; will you show me the book?  _Slave_. To be sure, sir. (And he pr=
esented it to him very=20

respectfully.)  _Mr. J_. The Bible!--Pray when did you get this book? And w=
ho taught you to read=20

it?  _Slave_. I thank God, sir, for the book. I do not know expend to the u=
ttermost the resources of=20

my empire. They are greater than my enemies think. But if it be the will of=
 God that my dynasty=20

shall cease to reign upon the throne of my ancestors, then--after having do=
ne all else that man can=20

do--I will let my beard grow to this,=E2=80=9D said Alexander, placing his =
hand upon his breast, =E2=80=9Cand I will=20

eat potatoes like the lowest of my mujiks, rather than sign the humiliation=
 of my country and of my=20

dear people, whose sacrifices for my sake I appreciate.=E2=80=9D Here his v=
oice failed: it was easier to=20

speak of his own ruin than of the love of his subjects. Greatly moved, he t=
urned away from=20

Michaud, and walked to the other end of the cabinet. But he came back almos=
t immediately with=20

long and rapid strides, and a face that had quickly changed from a deadly p=
allor to a fiery flush.=20

Pressing his hand on the arm of the officer, he said, =E2=80=9CColonel Mich=
aud, do not forget my words;=20

perhaps one day we shall remember them with pleasure. Napoleon or I--I or N=
apoleon--we can no=20

longer reign together. I know him now; he shall never deceive me again.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSire,=E2=80=9D cried the colonel=20

joyfully, =E2=80=9Cyour Majesty signs in this moment the glory of the natio=
n and the deliverance of Europe.=E2=80=9D=20

His words were true--with this qualification, that the glory of Russia and =
the deliverance of Europe=20

were not the work of a moment, but of long months of patient, heroic resolu=
tion. Alexander had not=20

wished for war--perhaps, indeed, he had striven too long to avert it. Perso=
nally, in his earlier years,=20

he admired Napoleon: the fact is undeniable, though it has=20


_
gentleman who gave it to me, but I am sure God sent it to me. I was learnin=
g to read in town at=20

nights, and one morning a gentleman met me in the road as I had my spelling=
 book open in my=20

hand: he asked me if I could read, I told him a little, and he gave me this=
 book and told me to=20

make haste and learn to read it, and to ask God to help me, and that it wou=
ld make me as happy=20

as any body in the world.  _Mr. J_. Well did you do so?  _Slave_. I thought=
 about it for some time,=20

and I wondered that any body should give me a book or care about me; and I =
wondered what that=20

could be which could make a poor slave like me so happy; and so I thought m=
ore and more of it,=20

and I said I would try and do as the gentleman bid me, and blessed be God! =
he told me nothing=20

but the truth.  _Mr. J_. Who is your master?  _Slave_. Mr. Wilkins, sir, wh=
o lives in that house.=20

_Mr. J_. I know him; he is a very good man; but what does he say to your le=
aving his work to read=20

your book in the field?  _Slave_. I was not leaving his work, sir. This boo=
k does not teach me to=20

neglect my master's work. I could not be happy if I did that.--I have done =
my breakfast, sir, and am=20

waiting till the horses are done eating.  _Mr. J_. Well, what does that boo=
k teach you?  _Slave_.=20

Oh, sir! every thing that I want to know--all I am to do, this book tells m=
e, and so plain. It shew me=20

first that I was a wretched, ruined sinner, and what would become of me if =
I died in that state, and=20

then when I was day and night in dread of God's calling me to account for m=
y wickedness, and did=20

not know which way to look for my deliverance, reading over and over again =
those dreadful words,=20

"depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire," then it revealed to me ho=
w Jesus Christ had=20

consented to come and suffer punishment for us in our stead, and bought par=
don for us by his=20

blood, and how by believing on him and serving manhood his favourite dream =
had been of a=20

universal and durable peace, and he imagined he saw in the victories of Nap=
oleon so many steps=20

to its attainment. What are now called =E2=80=9CLes id=C3=A9es Napol=C3=A9o=
niques,=E2=80=9D seem to have captivated for a=20

season this young, ardent, somewhat visionary mind. But the veil once torn =
from his eyes by the=20

insatiable ambition and the repeated perfidies of the French usurper, thenc=
eforward it was=20

between them war to the death.  When Napoleon suddenly poured his enormous =
hosts across the=20

Niemen, Alexander at once and emphatically announced his resolution, =E2=80=
=9CI will not sheathe the=20

sword while a single foreigner remains in arms upon the soil of Russia.=E2=
=80=9D At that moment the eyes=20

of all Europe were upon him, and neither friend nor foe believed it possibl=
e that he could make=20

good his word.  =E2=80=9CNapoleon,=E2=80=9D said an astute observer, =E2=80=
=9Cthought he could terrify the Emperor of=20

Russia by his menaces without drawing a sword; he thought he could make him=
 lose his head by=20

beginning the war suddenly in the midst of negotiations; he thought he coul=
d end that war by a=20

single battle. But nothing happened that he thought.=E2=80=9D[31] In a lett=
er written by him about this time,=20

which was intercepted and brought to his rival, were these words: =E2=80=9C=
Alexander is a child. I will make=20

him weep tears of blood.=E2=80=9D Alexander upon reading it remarked: =E2=
=80=9CHe said to me himself that in war=20

determination always carries the day. We shall see who has the most determi=
nation, he or I.=E2=80=9D  But=20

the determination of the strongest heart might well have quailed before the=
 perils that beset the=20

Czar in this solemn crisis of his own and his people=E2=80=99s history. Six=
 hundred and fifty thousand=20

fighting men had crossed his border under a leader hitherto invincible, who=
se name was the terror=20

of the civilized world. No man felt more keenly than Alexander his own infe=
riority to Napoleon as a=20

general. The bitter=20

that I need be no more terrified by the thoughts of God's anger but sure of=
 his forgiveness and=20

love....  (Here Mr. J. pursued his walk; but soon reflecting on what he had=
 heard, he resolved to=20

walk by Mr. Wilkins's house and enquire into this affair from him. This he =
did, he any commander=20

whose surpassing merit might inspire the army with confidence. The excellen=

with much regret, was obliged to remove him. Of his successor, the=20
