Wolcott Norris helped him out, and when it was all done and Ma and Pa Holbr=

import of its meaning, there was no unpleasant scene.  Ma Holbrook put her =

not really crying," declared=20

Ma Holbrook. "I'm just a little bit weepy, I'm so glad for Teeny-bits."  Pa=
 Holbrook took the mining=20

eeny-bits very happy:=20

"Ma and I are old folks and we've kind of worried, you can understand, abou=

Holbrook suddenly, "Pa and I will sort of adopt you, too, Mr. Norris. It do=

mining engineer got=20

up and stood over by the window blowing his nose. When he turned round ther=
