dracaena marginata and their dark bigotry up to the present day, when all d=
anger has disappeared.  The order of the planets in exoteric practice is th=
at defined by their geocentric radii, or the distance of their several orbi=
ts from the Earth as a centre, _viz._, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, M=
ercury and Moon. In the first three of these we find symbolized the celesti=
al Triad of supreme power in the physical, manifested universe, or Brahma, =
Vishnu and Shiva; while in the last four we recognize the symbols of the te=
rrestrial quaternary ruling over all natural and physical revolutions of th=
e seasons, quarters of the day, points of the compass, and elements. Thus: =
 Spring.     Summer.         Autumn.      Winter. Morning.    Noon.        =
   Evening.     Night. Youth.      Adolescence.    Manhood.     Age. Fire. =
      Air.            Water.       Earth. East.       South.          West.=
        North.  But Esoteric Science is not content with analogies on the p=
urely objective plane of the physical senses, and therefore it is absolutel=
y necessary to preface further teachings in this direction with a clear exp=
lanation of the real meaning of the word Magic.    What Magic Is, In Realit=
y.   Esoteric Science is, above all, the knowledge of our relations with an=
d in Divine Magic,(795) inseparableness from our divine _Selves_--the latte=
r meaning something else besides our own higher Spirit. Thus, before procee=
ding to exemplify and explain these relations, it may perhaps be useful to =
give the student a correct idea of the full meaning of this most misunderst=
ood word "Magic." Many are those willing and eager to study Occultism, but =
very few have even an approximate idea of the Science itself. Now, very few=
 of our American and European students can derive benefit from Sanskrit wor=
ks or even their translations, as these translations are, for the most part=
, merely blinds to the uninitiated. I therefore propose to offer to their a=
ttention demonstrations of the aforesaid drawn from Neo-Platonic works. The=
se are accessible in translation; and in order to throw light on that which=
 has hitherto been full of darkness, it will suffice to point to a certain =
key in them. Thus the Gnosis, both pre-Christian and post-Christian, will s=
erve our purpose admirably.  There are millions of Christians who know the =
name of Simon Magus, and the little that is told about him in the _Acts_; b=
ut very few who have even heard of the many motley, fantastic and contradic=
tory details which tradition records about his life. The story of his claim=
s and his death is to be found only in the prejudiced, half-fantastic recor=
ds about him in the works of the Church Fathers, such as Irenaeus, Epiphani=
us and St. Justin, and especially in the anonymous _Philosophumena_. Yet he=
 is a historical character, and the appellation of "Magus" was given to him=
 and was accepted by all his contemporaries, including the heads of the Chr=
istian Church, as a qualification indicating the miraculous powers he posse=
ssed, and irrespective of whether he was regarded as a white (divine) or a =
black (infernal) Magician. In this respect, opinion has always been made su=
bservient to the Gentile or Christian proclivities of his chronicler.  It i=
s in his system and in that of Menander, his pupil and successor, that we f=
ind what the term "Magic" meant for Initiates in those days.  Simon, as all=
 the other Gnostics, taught that our world was created by the _lower_ angel=
s, whom he called AEons. He mentions only three degrees of such, because it=
 was and is useless, as we have before explained, to teach anything about t=
he four higher ones, and he therefore begins at the plane of globes A and G=
. His system is as near to Occult Truth as any, so that we may examine it, =
as well as his own and Menander's claims about "Magic," to find out what th=
ey meant by the term. Now, for Simon, the summit of all manifested creation=
 you're right--those delicate, yet firm-set lips, those eyes which seem alw=
ays at the command of the intellect and never of the heart! Yes, it is one =
of Milady's bastards!"  "You laugh Aramis."  "From habit, that is all. I sw=
ear to you, I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path." =
 "Ah! here is De Winter coming," said Athos.  "Good! one thing now is only =
awanting and that is, that our grooms should not keep us waiting."  "No," s=
aid Athos. "I see them about twenty paces behind my lord. I recognize Grima=
ud by his long legs and his determined slouch. Tony carries our muskets."  =
"Then we set sail to-night?" asked Aramis, glancing toward the west, where =
the sun had left a single golden cloud, which, dipping into the ocean, appe=
ared by degrees to be extinguished.  "Probably," said Athos.  "Diable!" res=
umed Aramis, "I have little fancy for the sea by day, still less at night; =
the sounds of wind and wave, the frightful movements of the vessel; I confe=
ss I prefer the convent of Noisy."  Athos smiled sadly, for it was evident =
that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved=
 toward De Winter.  "What ails our friend?" said Aramis, "he resembles one =
of Dante's damned, whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever look=
ing at their heels. What the devil makes him glower thus behind him?"  When=
 De Winter perceived them, in his turn he advanced toward them with surpris=
ing rapidity.  "What is the matter, my lord?" said Athos, "and what puts yo=
u out of breath thus?"  "Nothing," replied De Winter; "nothing; and yet in =
passing the heights it seemed to me----" and he again turned round.  Athos =
glanced at Aramis.  "But let us go," continued De Winter; "let us be off; t=
he boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor--do you see=
 it there? I wish I were on board already," and he looked back again.  "He =
has seen him," said Athos, in a low tone, to Aramis.  They had reached the =
ladder which led to the boat. De Winter made the grooms who carried the arm=
s and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow th=
em.  At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel =
to the jetty, and hastening his steps, as if to reach the other side of the=
 port, scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking. He fancied in the=
 darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him. Athos no=
w descended the ladder in his turn, without losing sight of the young man. =
The latter, to make a short cut, had appeared on a sluice.  "He certainly b=
odes us no good," said Athos; "but let us embark; once out at sea, let him =
come."  And Athos sprang into the boat, which was immediately pushed off an=
d which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers.  But =
the young man had begun to follow, or rather to advance before the boat. Sh=
e was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty, surmounted by a beaco=
n just lighted, and a rock which jutted out. They saw him in the distance c=
limbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed.  "Ay, bu=
t," said Aramis, "that young fellow is decidedly a spy."  "Which is the you=
ng man?" asked De Winter, turning around.  "He who followed us and spoke to=
 us awaits us there; behold!"  De Winter turned and followed the direction =
of Aramis's finger. The beacon bathed with light the little strait through =
which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with b=
are head and crossed arms.  "It is he!" exclaimed De Winter, seizing the ar=
m of Athos; "it is he! I thought I recognized him and I was not mistaken." =
 "Whom do you mean?" asked Aramis.  "Milady's son," replied Athos.  "The mo=
nk!" exclaimed Grimaud.  The young man heard these words and bent so forwar=
d over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate hi=
mself from it.  "Yes, it is I, my uncle--I, the son of dracaena marginata a=

are in the _direct_ pure=20

waves of the divine Essence which flows from the _One in Three_, the Unmani=
fested, through the=20

Manifested Logos (the upper face in the diagram). Purusha, the primeval Spi=
rit, touches the=20

human head and stops there. But the Spiritual Man (the synthesis of the sev=
en principles) is=20

directly connected with it. And here a few words ought to be said about the=
 usual exoteric=20

enumeration of the principles. At first an approximate division only was ma=
de and given out.=20

_Esoteric Buddhism_ begins with Atma, the seventh, and ends with the Physic=
al Body, the first.=20

Now neither Atma, which is no individual "principle," but a radiation _from=
_ and _one with_ the=20

Unmanifested Logos; nor the Body, which is the material rind, or shell, of =
the Spiritual Man, can=20

be, in strict truth, referred to as "principles." Moreover, the chief "prin=
ciple" of all, one not even=20

mentioned heretofore, is the "Luminous Egg" (Hiranyagarbha), or the invisib=
le magnetic sphere in=20

which every man is enveloped.(773) It is the direct emanation: (_a_) from t=
he Atmic Ray in its=20

triple aspect of Creator, Preserver and Destroyer (Regenerator); and (_b_) =
from Buddhi- Manas.=20

The _seventh_ aspect of this individual Aura is the faculty of assuming the=
 form of its body and=20

becoming the "Radiant," the Luminous Augoeides. It is this, strictly speaki=
ng, which at times=20

becomes the form called Mayavi Rupa. Therefore, as explained in the second =
face of the diagram=20



(the astral man), the Spiritual Man consists of only five principles, as ta=
ught by the Vedantins,(774)=20

who substitute, tacitly, for the physical this sixth, or Auric, Body, and m=
erge the dual Manas (the=20

dual mind, or consciousness) into one. Thus they speak of five Koshas (shea=
ths or principles), and=20

call Atma the sixth yet no "principle." This is the secret of the late Subb=
a Row's criticism of the=20

division in _Esoteric Buddhism_. But let the student now learn the true Eso=
teric enumeration.  The=20

reason why public mention of the Auric Body was not permitted was on accoun=
t of its being so=20

sacred. It is this Body which, at death, assimilates the essence of Buddhi =
and Manas and=20

becomes the vehicle of these spiritual principles, _which are not objective=
_, and then, with the full=20

radiation of Atma upon it ascends as Manas-Taijasi into the Devachanic stat=
e. Therefore is it=20

called by many names. It is the Sutratma, the silver "thread" which "incarn=
ates" from the beginning=20

of Manvantara to the end, stringing upon itself the pearls of human existen=
ce, in other words, the=20

spiritual aroma of every personality it _follows_ through the pilgrimage of=
 life.(775) It is also the=20

material from which the Adept forms his Astral Bodies, from the Augoeides a=
nd the Mayavi Rupa=20

downwards. After the death of man, when its most ethereal particles have dr=
awn into themselves=20

the spiritual principles of Buddhi and the Upper Manas, and are illuminated=
 with the radiance of=20

Atma, the Auric Body remains either in the Devachanic state of consciousnes=
s, or, in the case of a=20

full Adept, prefers the state of a Nirmanakaya, that is, one who has so pur=
ified his whole system=20

that he is above even the divine illusion of a Devachani. Such an Adept rem=
ains in the astral=20

(invisible) plane connected with our earth, and henceforth moves and lives =
in the possession of all=20

his principles except the Kama Rupa and Physical Body. In the case of the D=
evachani, the Linga=20

Sharira--the _alter ego_ of the body, which during life is within the physi=
cal envelope while the=20

radiant aura is without--strengthened by the material particles which this =
aura leaves behind,=20

remains close to the dead body and outside it, and soon fades away. In the =
case of the full Adept,=20

the body alone becomes subject to dissolution, while the centre of that for=
ce which was the seat of=20

desires and passions, disappears with its cause--the animal body. But durin=
g the life of the latter=20

all these centres are more or less active and in constant correspondence wi=
th their prototypes, the=20

cosmic centres, and their microcosms, the principles. It is only through th=
ese cosmic and spiritual=20

centres that the physical centres (the upper seven orifices and the lower t=
riad) can benefit by their=20

Occult interaction, for these orifices, or openings, are channels conductin=
g into the body the=20

influences that _the will of man_ attracts and uses, _viz._, the cosmic for=
ces.  This will has, of=20

course, to act primarily through the spiritual principles. To make this cle=
arer, let us take an=20

example. In order to stop pain, let us say in the right eye, you have to at=
tract to it the potent=20

magnetism from that cosmic principle which corresponds to this eye and also=
 to Buddhi. Create,=20

by a powerful will effort, an imaginary line of communication between the r=
ight eye and Buddhi,=20

locating the latter as a _centre_ in the same part of the head. This line, =
though you may call it=20

"imaginary," is, once you succeed in seeing it with your mental eye and giv=
e it a shape and colour,=20

in truth as good as real. A rope in a dream _is not_ and yet _is_. Moreover=
, according to the=20

prismatic colour with which you endow your line, so will the influence act.=
 Now Buddhi and=20

Mercury correspond with each other, and both are yellow, or radiant and gol=
den coloured. In the=20

human system, the right eye corresponds with Buddhi and Mercury; and the le=
ft with Manas and=20

Venus or Lucifer. Thus, if your line is golden or silvery, it will stop the=
 pain; if red, it will increase it,=20

for red is the colour of Kama and corresponds with Mars. Mental or Christia=
n Scientists have=20



stumbled upon the _effects_ without understanding the _causes_. Having foun=
d by chance the=20

secret of producing such results owing to mental abstraction, they attribut=
e them to their union with=20

God (whether a personal or impersonal God they know best), whereas it is si=
mply the effect of one=20

or another principle. However it may be, they are on the path of discovery,=
 although they must=20

remain wandering for a long time to come.  Let not Esoteric students commit=
 the same mistake. It=20

has often been explained that neither the cosmic planes of your majesty sha=
ll have a definite=20

reply."  The queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter, who, kissing it res=
pectfully, went out and=20

traversed alone and unconducted those large, dark and deserted apartments, =
brushing away tears=20

which, blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier, he could not wit=
hhold at the spectacle of=20

royal distress so dignified, yet so intense.     40. Uncle and Nephew.   Th=
e horse and servant=20

belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door; he proceeded towar=
d his abode very=20

thoughtfully, looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark a=
nd silent frontage of the=20

Louvre. It was then that he saw a horseman, as it were, detach himself from=
 the wall and follow=20

him at a little distance. In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have=
 observed a similar=20

shadow.  "Tony," he said, motioning to his groom to approach.  "Here I am, =
my lord."  "Did you=20

remark that man who is following us?"  "Yes, my lord."  "Who is he?"  "I do=
 not know, only he has=20

followed your grace from the Palais Royal, stopped at the Louvre to wait fo=
r you, and now leaves=20

the Louvre with you."  "Some spy of the cardinal," said De Winter to him, a=
side. "Let us pretend=20

not to notice that he is watching us."  And spurring on he plunged into the=
 labyrinth of streets=20

which led to his hotel, situated near the Marais, for having for so long a =
time lived near the Place=20

Royale, Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwellin=
g.  The unknown=20

spurred his horse to a gallop.  De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went =
up into his apartment,=20

intending to watch the spy; but as he was about to place his gloves and hat=
 on a table, he saw=20

reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold =
of the room. He turned=20

around and Mordaunt stood before him.  There was a moment of frozen silence=
 between these=20

two.  "Sir," said De Winter, "I thought I had already made you aware that I=
 am weary of this=20

persecution; withdraw, then, or I shall call and have you turned out as you=
 were in London. I am=20

not your uncle, I know you not."  "My uncle," replied Mordaunt, with his ha=
rsh and bantering tone,=20

"you are mistaken; you will not have me turned out this time as you did in =
London--you dare not.=20

As for denying that I am your nephew, you will think twice about it, now th=
at I have learned some=20

things of which I was ignorant a year ago."  "And how does it concern me wh=
at you have learned?"=20

said De Winter.  "Oh, it concerns you very closely, my uncle, I am sure, an=
d you will soon be of my=20

opinion," added he, with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of =
him he thus addressed.=20

"When I presented myself before you for the first time in London, it was to=
 ask you what had=20

become of my fortune; the second time it was to demand who had sullied my n=
ame; and this time I=20

come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other, to say =
to you as God said to=20

the first murderer: 'Cain, what hast thou done to thy brother Abel?' My lor=
d, what have you done=20

with your sister--your sister, who was my mother?"  De Winter shrank back f=
rom the fire of those=20

scorching eyes.  "Your mother?" he said.  "Yes, my lord, my mother," replie=
d the young man,=20

advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter, and =
crossing his arms. "I=20

have asked the headsman of Bethune," he said, his voice hoarse and his face=
 livid with passion=20

and grief. "And the headsman of Bethune gave me a reply."  De Winter fell b=
ack in a chair as=20



though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply.  "Yes," conti=
nued the young man; "all=20

is now explained; with this key I open the abyss. My mother inherited an es=
tate from her husband,=20

you have assassinated her; my name would have secured me the paternal estat=
e, you have=20

deprived me of it; you have despoiled me of my fortune. I am no longer asto=
nished that you knew=20

me not. I am not surprised that you refused to recognize me. When a man is =
a robber it is hard to=20

call him nephew whom he has impoverished; when one is a murderer, to recogn=
ize the man whom=20

one has made an orphan."  These words produced a contrary effect to that wh=
ich Mordaunt had=20

anticipated. De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been; he rose=
, dignified and=20

calm, restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young =
man.  "You desire to=20

fathom this horrible secret?" said De Winter; "well, then, so be it. Know, =
then, what manner of=20

woman it was for whom to-day you call me to account. That woman had, in all=
 probability,=20

poisoned my brother, and in order to inherit from me she was about to assas=
sinate me in my turn.=20

I have proof of it. What say you to that?"  "I say that she was my mother."=
  "She caused the=20

unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was, ere that, ho=
nest, good and=20

pure. What say you to that crime, of which I have the proof?"  "She was my =
mother."  "On our=20

return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her oppon=
ents poisoned in=20

the convent of the Augustines at Bethune. Will this crime persuade you of t=
he justice of her=20

punishment--for of all this I have the proofs?"  "She was my mother!" cried=
 the young man, who=20

uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing forc=
e.  "At last, charged=20

with murders, with debauchery, hated by every one and yet threatening still=
, like a panther thirsting=20

for blood, she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate,=
 though they had=20

never done her the least injury; she met with judges whom her hideous crime=
s had evoked; and=20

that executioner you saw--that executioner who you say told you everything-=
-that executioner, if he=20

told you everything, told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her hi=
s brother's shame and=20

suicide. Depraved as a girl, adulterous as a wife, an unnatural sister, hom=
icide, poisoner,=20

execrated by all who knew her, by every nation that had been visited by her=
, she died accursed by=20

Heaven and earth."  A sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his t=
hroat and his livid=20

face became suffused with blood; he clenched his fists, sweat covered his f=
ace, his hair, like=20

Hamlet's, stood on end, and racked with fury he cried out:  "Silence, sir! =
she was my mother! Her=20

crimes, I know them not; her disorders, I know them not; her vices, I know =
them not. But this I=20

know, that I had a mother, that five men leagued against one woman, murdere=
d her clandestinely=20

by night--silently--like cowards. I know that you were one of them, my uncl=
e, and that you cried=20

louder than the others: 'She must die.' Therefore I warn you, and listen we=
ll to my words, that they=20

may be engraved upon your memory, never to be forgotten: this murder, which=
 has robbed me of=20

everything--this murder, which has deprived me of my name--this murder, whi=
ch has impoverished=20

me--this murder, which has made me corrupt, wicked, implacable--I shall sum=
mon you to account=20

for it first and then those who were your accomplices, when I discover them=
!"  With hatred in his=20

eyes, foaming at his mouth, and his fist extended, Mordaunt had advanced on=
e more step, a=20

threatening, terrible step, toward De Winter. The latter put his hand to hi=
s sword, and said, with the=20

smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death:  "Would you assa=
ssinate me, sir? Then I=20

shall recognize you as my nephew, for you would be a worthy son of such a m=
other."  "No,"=20

replied Mordaunt, forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resum=
e their usual places=20



and be calm; "no, I shall not kill you; at least not at this moment, for wi=
thout you I could not=20

discover the others. But when I have found them, then tremble, sir. I stabb=
ed to the heart the=20

headsman of Bethune, without mercy or pity, and he was the least guilty of =
you all."  With these=20

words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmn=
ess to pass=20

unobserved; then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony, leaning over=
 the balustrade,=20

waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room.  But De Winte=
r did not call; crushed,=20

enfeebled, he remained standing and with listening ear; then only when he h=
ad heard the step of=20

the horse going away he fell back on a chair, saying:  "My God, I thank The=
e that he knows me=20

only."     41. Paternal Affection.   Whilst this terrible scene was passing=
 at Lord de Winter's, Athos,=20

seated near his window, his elbow on the table and his head supported on hi=
s hand, was listening=20

intently to Raoul's account of the adventures he met with on his journey an=
d the details of the=20

battle.  Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure, the=
 fine, noble face of Athos=20

betrayed indescribable pleasure; he=20


_
principles--with the exception of the lowest material plane or world and th=
e physical body, which,=20

as has been said, are no "principles,"--can be located or thought of as bei=
ng in Space and Time.=20

As the former are seven in ONE, so are we seven in ONE--that same absolute =
Soul of the World,=20

which is both Matter and non-Matter, Spirit and non-Spirit, Being and non-B=
eing. Impress=20

yourselves well with this idea, all those of you who would study the myster=
ies of SELF.=20

Remember that with our physical senses alone at our command, none of us can=
 hope to reach=20

beyond gross Matter. We can do so only through one or another of our seven =
_spiritual_ senses,=20

either by training, or if one is a born Seer. Yet even a clairvoyant posses=
sed of such faculties, if=20

not an Adept, no matter how honest and sincere he may be, will, through his=
 ignorance of the=20

truths of Occult Science, be led by the visions he sees in the Astral Light=
 only to mistake for God=20

or Angels the denizens of those spheres of which he may occasionally catch =
a glimpse, as witness=20

Swedenborg and others.  These seven senses of ours correspond with every ot=
her septenate in=20

nature and in ourselves. Physically, though invisibly, the human Auric Enve=
lope (the amnion of the=20

physical man in every age of life) has seven layers, just as Cosmic Space a=
nd our physical=20

epidermis have. It is this Aura which, according to our mental and physical=
 state of purity or=20

impurity, either opens for us vistas into other worlds, or shuts us out alt=
ogether from anything but=20

this three-dimensional world of Matter.  Each of our seven physical senses =
(two of which are still=20

unknown to profane Science), and also of our seven states of consciousness-=
-_viz._: (1) waking;=20

(2) waking-dreaming; (3) natural sleeping; (4) induced or trance-sleep; (5)=
 psychic; (6) super-

psychic; and (7) purely spiritual--corresponds with one of the seven Cosmic=
 Planes, develops and=20

uses one of the seven super-senses, and is connected directly, in its use o=
n the terrestro-spiritual=20

plane, with the cosmic and divine centre of force that gave it birth, and w=
hich is its direct creator.=20

Each is also connected with, and under the direct influence of, one of the =
seven sacred=20

Planets.(776) These belonged to the Lesser Mysteries, whose followers were =
called Mystai (the=20

veiled), seeing that they were allowed to perceive things only through a mi=
st, as it were "with the=20

eyes closed"; while the Initiates or "Seers" of the Greater Mysteries were =
called Epoptai (those=20

who see things unveiled). It was the latter only who were taught the true m=
ysteries of the Zodiac=20

and the relations and correspondences between its twelve signs (two secret)=
 and the ten human=20

orifices. The latter are now of course ten in the female, and only nine in =
the male; but this is merely=20

an external difference. In the second volume of this work it is stated that=
 till the end of the Third=20

Root-Race (when androgynous man separated into male and female) the ten ori=
fices existed in=20

the hermaphrodite, first potentially, then functionally. The evolution of t=
he human embryo shows=20

this. For instance, the only opening formed at first is the buccal cavity, =
"a _cloaca_ communicating=20

with the anterior extremity of the intestine." These become later the mouth=
 and the posterior=20

orifice: the Logos differentiating and emanating gross matter on the lower =
plane, in Occult=20

parlance. The difficulty which some students will experience in reconciling=
 the correspondences=20

between the Zodiac and the orifices can be easily explained. Magic is coeva=
l with the Third Root-

Race, which began by creating through Kriyashakti and ended by generating i=
ts species in the=20

present way.(777) Woman, being left with the full or perfect cosmic number =
10 (the divine number=20

of Jehovah), was deemed higher and more spiritual than man. In Egypt, in da=
ys of old, the=20

marriage service contained an article that the woman should be the "lady of=
 the lord," and real lord=20

over him, the husband pledging himself to be "obedient to his wife" for the=
 production of=20



alchemical results such as the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone, =
for the _spiritual_ help of=20

the woman was needed by the male Alchemist. But woe to the Alchemist who sh=
ould take this in=20

the dead-letter sense of _physical_ union. Such sacrilege would become Blac=
k Magic and be=20

followed by certain failure. The true Alchemist of old took _aged_ women to=
 help him, carefully=20

avoiding the young ones; and if any of them happened to be married they tre=
ated their wives for=20

months both before and during their operations as sisters.  The error of to=
nes of that young voice,=20

as harmonious music. He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was c=
loudy in the future. It=20

almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears=
 to hopes. Athos was=20

happy--happy as he had never been before.  "And you assisted and took part =
in this great battle,=20

Bragelonne!" cried the former musketeer.  "Yes, sir."  "And it was a fierce=
 one?"  "His highness the=20

prince charged eleven times in person."  "He is a great commander, Bragelon=
ne."  "He is a hero,=20

sir. I did not lose sight of him for an instant. Oh! how fine it is to be c=
alled Conde and to be so=20

worthy of such a name!"  "He was calm and radiant, was he not?"  "As calm a=
s at parade, radiant=20

as at a fete. When we went up to the enemy it was slowly; we were forbidden=
 to draw first and we=20

were marching toward the Spaniards, who were on a height with lowered muske=
ts. When we=20

arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldie=
rs: 'Comrades,' he said,=20

'you are about to suffer a furious discharge; but after that you will make =
short work with those=20

fellows.' There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have h=
eard these words;=20

then raising his sword, 'Sound trumpets!' he cried."  "Well, very good; you=
 will do as much when=20

the opportunity occurs, will you, Raoul?"  "I know not, sir, but I thought =
it really very fine and=20

grand!"  "Were you afraid, Raoul?" asked the count.  "Yes, sir," replied th=
e young man naively; "I=20

felt a great chill at my heart, and at the word 'fire,' which resounded in =
Spanish from the enemy's=20

ranks, I closed my eyes and thought of you."  "In honest truth, Raoul?" sai=
d Athos, pressing his=20

hand.  "Yes, sir; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry tha=
t one might have=20

imagined the infernal regions had opened. Those who were not killed felt th=
e heat of the flames. I=20

opened my eyes, astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt; a third of=
 the squadron were=20

lying on the ground, wounded, dead or dying. At that moment I encountered t=
he eye of the prince.=20

I had but one thought and that was that he was observing me. I spurred on a=
nd found myself in the=20

enemy's ranks."  "And the prince was pleased with you?"  "He told me so, at=
 least, sir, when he=20

desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon, who was charged t=
o carry the news to=20

the queen and to bring the colors we had taken. 'Go,' said he; 'the enemy w=
ill not rally for fifteen=20

days and until that time I have no need of your service. Go and see those w=
hom you love and who=20

love you, and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the presen=
t that she made me of=20

you.' And I came, sir," added Raoul, gazing at the count with a smile of re=
al affection, "for I thought=20

you would be glad to see me again."  Athos drew the young man toward him an=
d pressed his lips=20

to his brow, as he would have done to a young daughter.  "And now, Raoul," =
said he, "you are=20

launched; you have dukes for friends, a marshal of France for godfather, a =
prince of the blood as=20

commander, and on the day of your return you have been received by two quee=
ns; it is not so bad=20

for a novice."  "Oh sir," said Raoul, suddenly, "you recall something, whic=
h, in my haste to relate=20

my exploits, I had forgotten; it is that there was with Her Majesty the Que=
en of England, a=20

gentleman who, when I pronounced your name, uttered a cry of surprise and j=
oy; he said he was a=20

friend of yours, asked your address, and is coming to see you."  "What is h=
is name?"  "I did not=20



venture to ask, sir; he spoke elegantly, although I thought from his accent=
 he was an Englishman."=20

"Ah!" said Athos, leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be. =
Then, when he raised=20

it again, he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the op=
en door and was=20

gazing at him with a compassionate air.  "Lord de Winter!" exclaimed the co=
unt.  "Athos, my=20

friend!"  And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other's =
arms; then Athos,=20

looking into his friend's face and taking him by both hands, said:  "What a=
ils you, my lord? you=20

appear as unhappy as I am the reverse."  "Yes, truly, dear friend; and I ma=
y even say the sight of=20

you increases my dismay."  And De Winter glancing around him, Raoul quickly=
 understood that=20

the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffecte=
dly.  "Come, now that=20

we are alone," said Athos, "let us talk of yourself."  "Whilst we are alone=
 let us speak of ourselves,"=20

replied De Winter. "He is here."  "Who?"  "Milady's son."  Athos, again str=
uck by this name, which=20

seemed to=20


_
signs is explained in _Isis Unveiled_.(778) The Ancients did know of twelve=
, but viewed these=20

signs differently from ourselves. They took neither Virgo nor Scorpio singl=
y into consideration, but=20

regarded them as two in one, since they were made to refer directly and sym=
bolically to the=20

primeval dual man and his separation into sexes. During the reformation of =
the Zodiac, Libra was=20

added as the twelfth sign, though it is simply an equilibrating sign, at th=
e turning point--the mystery=20

of separated man.  Let the student learn all this well. Meanwhile we have t=
o recapitulate what has=20

been said.  (1) Each human being is an incarnation of his God, in other wor=
ds, one with his=20

"Father in Heaven," just as Jesus, an Initiate, is made to say. As many men=
 on earth, so many=20

Gods in Heaven; and yet these Gods are in reality ONE, for at the end of ev=
ery period of activity,=20

they are withdrawn, like the rays of the setting sun, into the Parent Lumin=
ary, the Non-Manifested=20

Logos, which in its turn is merged into the One Absolute. Shall we call the=
se "Fathers" of ours,=20

whether individually or collectively, and under any circumstances, our _per=
sonal God_? Occultism=20

answers, _Never_. All that an average man can know of his "Father" is what =
he knows of himself,=20

through and within himself. The Soul of his "Heavenly Father" is incarnated=
 in him. This Soul is=20

himself, if he be successful in assimilating the Divine Individuality while=
 in his physical, animal=20

shell. As to the Spirit thereof, as well expect to be heard by the Absolute=
. Our prayers and=20

supplications are vain, unless to potential words we add potent acts, and m=
ake the Aura which=20

surrounds each one of us so pure and divine that the God within us may act =
outwardly, or in other=20

words, become as it were an extraneous Potency. Thus have Initiates, Saints=
, and very holy and=20

pure men been enabled to help others as well as themselves in the hour of n=
eed, and produce=20

what are foolishly called "miracles," each by the help and with the aid of =
the God within himself,=20

which he alone has enabled to act on the outward plane.  (2) The word AUM o=
r OM, which=20

corresponds to the upper Triangle, if pronounced by a very holy and pure ma=
n, will draw out, or=20

awaken, not only the less exalted Potencies residing in the planetary space=
s and elements, but=20

even his Higher Self, or the "Father" within him. Pronounced by an averagel=
y good man, in the=20

correct way, it will help to strengthen him morally, especially if between =
two "AUMS" he meditates=20

intently upon the AUM within him, concentrating all his attention upon the =
ineffable glory. But woe=20

to the man who pronounces it after the commission of some far- reaching sin=
: he will only thereby=20

attract to his own impure photosphere invisible Presences and Forces which =
could not otherwise=20

break through the Divine Envelope.  AUM is the original of Amen. Now, Amen =
is not a Hebrew=20

term, but, like the word Halleluiah, was borrowed by the Jews and Greeks fr=
om the Chaldees. The=20

latter word is often found repeated in certain magical inscriptions upon cu=
ps and urns among the=20

Babylonian and Ninevean relics. Amen does not mean "so be it," or "verily,"=
 but signified in hoary=20

antiquity almost the same as AUM. The Jewish Tanaim (Initiates) used it for=
 the same reason as=20

the Aryan Adepts use AUM, and with a like success, the numerical value of _=
AMeN_ in Hebrew=20

letters being 91, the same as the full value of _YHVH_,(779) 26, and _ADoNa=
Y_, 65, or 91. Both=20

words mean the affirmation of the being, or existence, of the sexless "Lord=
" within us.  (3) Esoteric=20

Science teaches that every sound in the visible world awakens its correspon=
ding sound in the=20

invisible realms, and arouses to action some force or other on the Occult s=
ide of Nature.=20

Moreover, every sound corresponds to a colour and a number (a potency spiri=
tual, psychic or=20

physical) and to a sensation on some plane. All these find an echo in every=
 one of the so-far=20

developed elements, and even on the terrestrial plane, in the Lives that sw=
arm in the terrene=20



atmosphere, thus prompting them to action.  Thus a prayer, unless pronounce=
d _mentally_ and=20

addressed to one's "Father" in the silence and solitude of one's "closet," =
must have more=20

frequently disastrous than beneficial results, seeing that the masses are e=
ntirely ignorant of the=20

potent effects which they thus produce. To produce good effects, the prayer=
 must be uttered by=20

"one who knows how to make himself heard in silence," when it is no longer =
a prayer, but=20

becomes a command. Why is Jesus shown to have forbidden his hearers to go t=
o the public=20

synagogues? Surely every praying man was not a hypocrite and a liar, nor a =
Pharisee who loved=20

to be seen praying by people! He had a motive, we must suppose: the same mo=
tive which=20

prompts the experienced Occultist to prevent his pupils from going into cro=
wded places now as=20

then, from entering churches, seance rooms, etc., unless they are in sympat=
hy with the crowd.=20

There is one piece of advice to be given to beginners, who cannot help goin=
g into crowds--one=20

which may appear superstitious, but which in the absence of Occult knowledg=
e will be found=20

efficacious. As well known to good Astrologers, the days of the week are no=
t in the order of those=20

planets whose names they bear. The fact is that the ancient Hindus and Egyp=
tians divided the day=20

into four parts, each day being under the protection (as ascertained by pra=
ctical magic) of a planet;=20

and every day, as correctly asserted by Dion Cassius, received the name of =
the planet which ruled=20

and protected its first portion. Let the student protect himself from the "=
Powers of the Air"=20

(Elementals) which throng public places, by wearing either a ring containin=
g some jewel of the=20

colour of the presiding planet, or else of the metal sacred to it. But the =
best protection is a clear=20

conscience and a firm desire to benefit Humanity.    The Planets, The Days =

accompanying diagram the days of the week do not stand in their usual order=
, though they are=20

placed in their correct sequence as determined by the order of the colours =
in the solar spectrum=20

and the corresponding colours of their ruling planets. The fault of the con=
fusion in the order of the=20

days revealed by this comparison lies at the door of the early Christians. =
Adopting from the Jews=20

their lunar months, they tried to blend them with the solar planets, and so=
 made a mess of it; for=20

the order of the days of the week as it now stands does not follow the orde=
r of the planets.  Now,=20

the Ancients arranged the planets in the following order: Moon, Mercury, Ve=
nus, Sun, Mars,=20

Jupiter, Saturn, counting the Sun as a planet for exoteric purposes. Again,=
 the Egyptians and=20

Indians, the two oldest nations, divided their day into four parts, each of=
 which was under the=20

protection and rule of a planet. In course of time each day came to be call=
ed by the name of that=20

planet which ruled its first portion--the morning. Now, when they arranged =
their week, the=20

Christians proceeded as follows: they wanted to make the day of the Sun, or=
 Sunday, the seventh,=20

so they named the days of the week by taking every fourth planet in turn; _=
e.g._, beginning with=20

the Moon (Monday), they counted thus: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, _Mars_; th=
us Tuesday, the=20

day whose first portion was ruled by Mars, became the second day of the wee=
k; and so on. It=20

should be remembered also that the Moon, like the Sun, is a substitute for =
a secret planet.  The=20

present division of the solar year was made several centuries later than th=
e beginning of our era;=20

and our week is not that of the Ancients and the Occultists. The septenary =
division of the four parts=20

of the lunar phases is as old as the world, and originated with the people =
who reckoned time by=20

the lunar months. The Hebrews never used it, for they counted only the seve=
nth day, the Sabbath,=20

though the second chapter of _Genesis_ seems to speak of it. Till the days =
of the Caesars there is=20

no trace of a week of seven days among any nation save the Hindus. From Ind=
ia it passed to the=20

Arabs, and reached Europe with Christianity. The Roman week consisted of ei=
ght days, and the=20

Athenian of ten.(780) Thus one of the numberless contradictions and fallaci=
es of Christendom is=20

the adoption of the Indian septenary week of the lunar reckoning, and the p=
reservation at the=20

same time of the mythological names of the planets.  Nor do modern Astrolog=
ers give the=20

correspondences of the days and planets and their colours correctly; and wh=
ile Occultists can give=20



good reason for every detail of their own tables of colours, etc., it is do=
ubtful whether the=20

Astrologers can do the same.                    ---------------------------=
----------  To close this first Paper, let=20

me say that the readers must in all necessity be separated into two broad d=
ivisions: those who=20

have not quite rid themselves of the usual sceptical doubts, but who long t=
o ascertain how much=20

truth there may be in the claims of the Occultists; and those others who, h=
aving freed themselves=20

from the trammels of Materialism and Relativity, feel that true and real bl=
iss must be sought only in=20

the knowledge and personal experience of that which the Hindu Philosopher c=
alls the=20

Brahmavidya, and the Buddhist Arhat the realization of Adibuddha, the prime=
val Wisdom. Let the=20

former pick out and study from these Papers only those explanations of the =
phenomena of life=20

which profane Science is unable to give them. Even with such limitations, t=
hey will find by the end=20

of a year or two that they will have learned more than all their Universiti=
es and Colleges can teach=20

them. As to the sincere believers, they will be rewarded by seeing their fa=
ith transformed into=20

knowledge. True knowledge is of Spirit and in Spirit alone, and cannot be a=
cquired in any other=20

way except through the region of the higher mind, the only plane from which=
 we can penetrate the=20

depths of the all-pervading Absoluteness. He who carries out only those law=
s established by=20

human minds, who lives that life which is prescribed by the code of mortals=
 and their fallible=20

legislation, chooses as his guiding star a beacon which shines on the ocean=
 of Maya, or of=20

temporary delusions, and lasts for but one incarnation. These laws are nece=
ssary for the life and=20

welfare of physical man alone. He has chosen a pilot who directs him throug=
h the shoals of one=20

existence, a master who parts with him, however, on the threshold of death.=
 How much happier=20

that man who, while strictly performing on the temporary objective plane th=
e duties of daily life,=20

carrying out each and every law of his country, and rendering, in short, to=
 Caesar what is=20

Caesar's, leads in reality a spiritual and permanent existence, a life with=
 no breaks of continuity,=20

no gaps, no interludes, not even during those periods which are the halting=
-places of the long=20

pilgrimage of purely spiritual life. All the phenomena of the lower human m=
ind disappear like the=20

curtain of a proscenium, allowing him to live in the region beyond it, the =
plane of the noumenal, the=20

one reality. If man by suppressing, if not destroying, his selfishness and =
personality, only succeeds=20

in knowing himself as he is behind the veil of physical Maya, he will soon =
stand beyond all pain, all=20

misery, and beyond all the wear and tear of change, which is the chief orig=
inator of pain. Such a=20

man will be physically of Matter, he will move surrounded by Matter, and ye=
t he will live beyond=20

and outside it. His body will be subject to change, but he himself will be =
entirely without it, and will=20

experience everlasting life even while in temporary bodies of short duratio=
n. All this may be=20

achieved by the development of unselfish universal love of Humanity, and th=
e suppression of=20

personality, or _selfishness_, which is the cause of all sin, and consequen=
tly of all human sorrow.=20

Paper II. An Explanation.   In view of the abstruse nature of the subjects =
dealt with, the present=20

Paper will begin with an explanation of some points which remained obscure =
in the preceding one,=20

as well as of some statements in which there was an appearance of contradic=
tion.  Astrologers, of=20

whom there are many among the Esotericists, are likely to be puzzled by som=
e statements=20

distinctly contradicting their teachings; whilst those who know nothing of =
the subject may perhaps=20

find themselves opposed at the outset by those who have studied the exoteri=
c systems of the=20

Kabalah and Astrology. For let it be distinctly known, nothing of that whic=
h is printed broadcast,=20

and available to every student in public libraries or museums, is really Es=
oteric, but is either mixed=20



with deliberate "blinds," or cannot be understood and studied with profit w=
ithout a echo, hesitated=20

for a moment, then slightly knitting his brows, he calmly said:  "I know it=
, Grimaud met him=20

between Bethune and Arras and then came here to warn me of his presence."  =
"Does Grimaud=20

know him, then?"  "No; but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew=
 him."  "The=20

headsman of Bethune?" exclaimed De Winter.  "You know about that?" cried At=
hos, astonished.=20

"He has just left me," replied De Winter, "after telling me all. Ah! my fri=
end! what a horrible scene!=20

Why did we not destroy the child with the mother?"  "What need you fear?" s=
aid Athos, recovering=20

from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced, by the aid of reason=
; "are we not men=20

accustomed to defend ourselves? Is this young man an assassin by profession=
--a murderer in cold=20

blood? He has killed the executioner of Bethune in an access of passion, bu=
t now his fury is=20

assuaged."  De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head.  "Do you not k=
now the race?" said=20

he.  "Pooh!" said Athos, trying to smile in his turn. "It must have lost it=
s ferocity in the second=20

generation. Besides, my friend, Providence has warned us, that we may be on=
 our guard. All we=20

can now do is to wait. Let us wait; and, as I said before, let us speak of =
yourself. What brings you=20

to Paris?"  "Affairs of importance which you shall know later. But what is =
this that I hear from Her=20

Majesty the Queen of England? Monsieur d'Artagnan sides with Mazarin! Pardo=
n my frankness,=20

dear friend. I neither hate nor blame the cardinal, and your opinions will =
be held ever sacred by=20

me. But do you happen to belong to him?"  "Monsieur d'Artagnan," replied At=
hos, "is in the service;=20

he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority. Monsieur d'Artagnan=
 is not rich and has need=20

of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live. Millionaires like your=
self, my lord, are rare in=20

France."  "Alas!" said De Winter, "I am at this moment as poor as he is, if=
 not poorer. But to return=20

to our subject."  "Well, then, you wish to know if I am of Mazarin's party?=
 No. Pardon my=20

frankness, too, my lord."  "I am obliged to you, count, for this pleasing i=
ntelligence! You make me=20

young and happy again by it. Ah! so you are not a Mazarinist? Delightful! I=
ndeed, you could not=20

belong to him. But pardon me, are you free? I mean to ask if you are marrie=
d?"  "Ah! as to that,=20

no," replied Athos, laughing.  "Because that young man, so handsome, so ele=
gant, so polished----"=20

"Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his father." =
 "Very well; you are=20

always the same, Athos, great and generous. Are you still friends with Mons=
ieur Porthos and=20

Monsieur Aramis?"  "Add Monsieur d'Artagnan, my lord. We still remain four =
friends devoted to=20

each other; but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fi=
ghting him, of being=20

Mazarinists or Frondists, then we are only two."  "Is Monsieur Aramis with =
D'Artagnan?" asked=20

Lord de Winter.  "No," said Athos; "Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to sh=
are my opinions."=20

"Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend? Is=
 he much changed?"=20

"He has become an abbe, that is all."  "You alarm me; his profession must h=
ave made him=20

renounce any great undertakings."  "On the contrary," said Athos, smiling, =
"he has never been so=20

much a musketeer as since he became an abbe, and you will find him a verita=
ble soldier."  "Could=20

you engage to bring him to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, on the Pont=
 du Louvre?"  "Oh,=20

oh!" exclaimed Athos, smiling, "you have a duel in prospect."  "Yes, count,=
 and a splendid duel,=20

too; a duel in which I hope you will take your part."  "Where are we to go,=
 my lord?"  "To Her=20

Majesty the Queen of England, who has desired me to present you to her."  "=
This is an enigma,"=20

said Athos, "but it matters not; since you know the solution of it I ask no=
 further. Will your lordship=20

do me the honor to sup with me?"  "Thanks, count, no," replied De Winter. "=
I own to you that that=20



young man's visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sl=
eep. What=20

undertaking can have brought him to Paris? It was not to meet me that he ca=
me, for he was=20

ignorant of my journey. This young man terrifies me, my lord; there lies in=
 him a sanguinary=20

predisposition."  "What occupies him in England?"  "He is one of Cromwell's=
 most enthusiastic=20

disciples."  "But what attached him to the cause? His father and mother wer=
e Catholics, I believe?"=20

"His hatred of the king, who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to=
 bear the name of De=20

Winter."  "And what name does he now bear?"  "Mordaunt."  "A Puritan, yet d=
isguised as a monk=20

he travels alone in France."  "Do you say as a monk?"  "It was thus, and by=
 mere accident--may=20

God pardon me if I blaspheme--that he heard the confession of the execution=
er of Bethune."=20

"Then I understand it all! he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin, and the=
 queen guessed=20

rightly; we have been forestalled. Everything is clear to me now. Adieu, co=
unt, till to-morrow."  "But=20

the night is dark," said Athos, perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more =
uneasy than he wished=20

to appear; "and you have no servant."  "I have Tony, a safe if simple youth=
."  "Halloo, there,=20

Grimaud, Olivain, and Blaisois! call the viscount and take the musket with =
you."  Blaisois was the=20

tall youth, half groom, half peasant, whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelo=
nne, whom Athos=20

had christened by the name of his province.  "Viscount," said Athos to Raou=
l, as he entered, "you=20

will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him.=
"  "Oh! count," said De=20

Winter, "for whom do you take me?"  "For a stranger who does not know Paris=
," said Athos, "and=20

to whom the viscount will show the way."  De Winter shook him by the hand. =
 "Grimaud," said=20

Athos, "put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk."  Gri=
maud shuddered, and=20

nodding, awaited the departure, regarding the butt of his musket with silen=
t eloquence. Then=20

obeying the orders given him by Athos, he headed the small procession, bear=
ing the torch in one=20

hand and the musket in the other, until it reached De Winter's inn, when po=
unding on the portal=20

with his fist, he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word.  The sam=
e order was followed in=20

returning, nor did Grimaud's searching glance discover anything of a suspic=
ious appearance, save=20

a dark shadow, as it were, in ambuscade, at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud=
 and of the Quai.=20

He fancied, also, that in going he had already observed the street watcher =
who had attracted his=20

attention. He pushed on toward him, but before he could reach it the shadow=
 had disappeared into=20

an alley, into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it.  The =
next day, on awaking,=20

the count perceived Raoul by his bedside. The young man was already dressed=
 and was reading=20

a new book by M. Chapelain.  "Already up, Raoul?" exclaimed the count.  "Ye=
s, sir," replied Raoul,=20

with slight hesitation; "I did not sleep well."  "You, Raoul, not sleep wel=
l! then you must have=20

something on your mind!" said Athos.  "Sir, you will perhaps think that I a=
m in a great hurry to=20

leave you when I have only just arrived, but----"  "Have you only two days =
of leave, Raoul?"  "On=20

the contrary, sir, I have ten; nor is it to the camp I wish to go."  "Where=
, then?" said Athos, smiling,=20

"if it be not a secret. You are now almost a man, since you have made your =
first passage of arms,=20

and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me."  "=
Never, sir," said Raoul,=20

"as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector, shall I =
deem I have the right of=20

freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me. I have, however, a wi=
sh to go and pass a=20

day at Blois. You look at me and you are going to laugh at me."  "No, on th=
e contrary, I am not=20

inclined to laugh," said Athos, suppressing a sigh. "You wish to see Blois =
again; it is but natural."=20

"Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?" exclaimed Raou=
l, joyously.=20



"Certainly; and why should I regret what gives you pleasure?"  "Oh! how kin=
d you are," exclaimed=20

the young man, pressing his guardian's hand; "and I can set out immediately=
?"  "When you like,=20

Raoul."  "Sir," said Raoul, as he turned to leave the room, "I have thought=
 of one thing, and that is=20

about the Duchess of Chevreuse, who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my =
introduction to=20

the prince."  "And you ought to thank her, Raoul. Well, try the Hotel de Lu=
ynes, Raoul, and ask if=20

the duchess can receive you. I am glad to see you pay attention to the usag=
es of the world. You=20

must take Grimaud and Olivain."  "Both, sir?" asked Raoul, astonished.  "Bo=
th."  Raoul went out,=20

and when Athos heard his young, joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain=
, he sighed.  "It is=20

very soon to leave me," he thought, "but he follows the common custom. Natu=
re has made us=20

thus; she makes the young look ever forward, not behind. He certainly likes=
 the child, but will he=20

love me less as his affection grows for her?"  And Athos confessed to himse=
lf that, he was=20

unprepared for so prompt a departure; but Raoul was so happy that this refl=
ection effaced=20

everything else from the consideration of his guardian.  Everything was rea=
dy at ten o'clock for the=20

departure, and as Athos was watching Raoul mount, a groom rode up from the =
Duchess de=20

Chevreuse. He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere, that she had learne=
d of the return of her=20

youthful protege, and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field=
, and she added that=20

she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations.  "Tell her grace,=
" replied Athos, "that the=20

viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes."  Th=
en, with renewed=20

instructions to Grimaud, Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out, an=
d ended by reflecting that=20

it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment. =
    42. Another Queen=20

in Want of Help.   Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had giv=
en his letter to Blaisois,=20

the only serving-man whom he had left. Blaisois found Bazin donning his bea=
dle's gown, his=20

services being required that day at Notre Dame.  Athos had desired Blaisois=
 to try to speak to=20

Aramis himself. Blaisois, a tall, simple youth, who understood nothing but =
what he was expressly=20

told, asked, therefore for the Abbe d'Herblay, and in spite of Bazin's assu=
rances that his master=20

was not at home, he persisted in such a manner as to put Bazin into a passi=
on. Blaisois seeing=20

Bazin in clerical guise, was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted=
 to pass at all risks,=20

believing too, that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the vir=
tues of his cloth,=20

namely, patience and Christian charity.  But Bazin, still the servant of a =
musketeer, when once the=20

blood mounted to his fat cheeks, seized a broomstick and began belaboring B=
laisois, saying:=20

"You have insulted the church, my friend, you have insulted the church!"  A=
t this moment Aramis,=20

aroused by this unusual disturbance, cautiously opened the door of his room=
; and Blaisois, looking=20

reproachfully at the Cerberus, drew the letter from his pocket and presente=
d it to Aramis.  "From=20

the Comte de la Fere," said Aramis. "All right." And he retired into his ro=
om without even asking=20

the cause of so much noise.  Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of=
 the Grand Roi=20

Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed, he rela=
ted his adventure.=20

"You foolish fellow!" said Athos, laughing. "And you did not tell him that =
you came from me?"  "No,=20

sir."  At ten o'clock Athos, with his habitual exactitude, was waiting on t=
he Pont du Louvre and was=20

almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter.  They waited ten minutes and t=
hen his lordship=20

began to fear Aramis was not coming to join them.  "Patience," said Athos, =
whose eyes were fixed=20

in the direction of the Rue du Bac, "patience; I see an abbe cuffing a man,=
 then bowing to a=20

woman; it must be Aramis."  It was indeed Aramis. Having run against a youn=
g shopkeeper who=20



was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him, Aramis with one blow of h=
is fist had=20

distanced him ten paces.  At this moment one of his penitents passed, and a=
s she was young and=20

pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile.  A most=
 affectionate greeting, as=20

one can well believe took place between him and Lord de Winter.  "Where are=
 we going?" inquired=20

Aramis; "are we going to fight, perchance? I carry no sword this morning an=
d cannot return home=20

to procure one."  "No," said Lord de Winter, "we are going to pay a visit t=
o Her Majesty the Queen=20

of England."  "Oh, very well," replied Aramis; then bending his face down t=
o Athos's ear, "what is=20

the object of this visit?" continued he.  "Nay, I know not; some evidence r=
equired from us,=20

perhaps."  "May it not be about that cursed affair?" asked Aramis, "in whic=
h case I do not greatly=20

care to go, for it will be to pocket a lecture; and since it is my function=
 to give them to others I am=20

rather averse to receiving them myself."  "If it were so," answered Athos, =
"we should not be taken=20

there by Lord de Winter, for he would come in for his share; he was one of =
us."  "You're right; yes,=20

let us go."  On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first; indeed=
, there was but one porter=20

there to receive them at the gate.  It was impossible in daylight for the i=
mpoverished state of the=20

habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass un=
noticed by Athos,=20

Aramis, and even the Englishman. Large rooms, completely stripped of furnit=
ure, bare walls upon=20

which, here and there, shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time =
and neglect, windows=20

with broken panes (impossible to close), no carpets, neither guards nor ser=
vants: this is what first=20

met the eyes of Athos, to which he, touching his companion's elbow, directe=
d his attention by his=20

glances.  "Mazarin is better lodged," said Aramis.  "Mazarin is almost king=
," answered Athos;=20

"Madame Henrietta is almost no longer queen."  "If you would condescend to =
be clever, Athos,"=20

observed Aramis, "I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur=
 de Voiture."  Athos=20

smiled.  The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them, for at the fi=
rst slight noise she=20

heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to recei=
ve these courtiers in the=20

corridors of Misfortune.  "Enter. You are welcome, gentlemen," she said.  T=
he gentlemen entered=20

and remained standing, but at a motion from the queen they seated themselve=
s. Athos was calm=20

and grave, but Aramis was furious; the sight of such royal misery exasperat=
ed him and his eyes=20

examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself.  "You are examin=
ing the luxury I enjoy,"=20

said the queen, glancing sadly around her.  "Madame," replied Aramis, "I mu=
st ask your pardon,=20

but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry=
 IV. is treated at the=20

court of France."  "Monsieur Aramis is not an officer?" asked the queen of =
Lord de Winter.  "That=20

gentleman is the Abbe d'Herblay," replied he.  Aramis blushed. "Madame," he=
 said, "I am an abbe,=20

it is true, but I am so against my will. I never had a vocation for the ban=
ds; my cassock is fastened=20

by one button only, and I am always ready to become a musketeer once more. =
This morning,=20

being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty, I encum=
bered myself with this=20

dress, but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty's s=
ervice, in whatever way=20

you may see fit to use me."  "The Abbe d'Herblay," resumed De Winter, "is o=
ne of those gallant=20

musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII., of whom I ha=
ve spoken to you,=20

madame." Then turning to Athos, he continued, "And this gentleman is that n=
oble Comte de la=20

Fere, whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty."  "Gentlemen,=
" said the queen, "a=20

few years ago I had around me ushers, treasures, armies; and by the lifting=
 of a finger all these=20

were busied in my service. To-day, look around you, and it may astonish you=
, that in order to=20



accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord de Winte=
r, the friend of twenty=20

years, and you, gentlemen, whom I see for the first time and whom I know bu=
t as my countrymen."=20

"It is enough," said Athos, bowing low, "if the lives of three men can purc=
hase yours, madame."  "I=20

thank you, gentlemen. But hear me," continued she. "I am not only the most =
miserable of queens,=20

but the most unhappy of mothers, the most wretched of wives. My children, t=
wo of them, at least,=20

the Duke of York and the Princess Elizabeth, are far away from me, exposed =
to the blows of the=20

ambitious and our foes; my husband, the king, is leading in England so wret=
ched an existence that=20

it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired.=
 Hold! gentlemen, here is=20

the letter conveyed to me by Lord de Winter. Read=20


_
The following teachings and explanations, therefore, may be useful to the s=
tudent in assisting him=20

to formulate the teaching given in the preceding Paper.  In Diagram I. it w=
ill be observed that the 3,=20

7, and 10 centres are respectively as follows:  (_a_) The 3 pertain to the =
spiritual world of the=20

Absolute, and therefore to the three higher principles in Man.  (_b_) The 7=
 belong to the spiritual,=20

psychic, and physical worlds and to the body of man. Physics, metaphysics a=
nd hyper-physics are=20

the triad that symbolizes man on this plane.  (_c_) The 10, or the sum tota=
l of these, is the=20

Universe as a whole, in all its aspects, and also its Microcosm--Man, with =
his ten orifices.  Laying=20

aside, for the moment, the Higher Decad (Kosmos) and the Lower Decad (Man),=
 the first three=20

numbers of the separate sevens have a direct reference to the Spirit, Soul =
and Auric Envelope of=20

the human being, as well as to the higher supersensual world. The lower fou=
r, or the four aspects,=20

belong to Man also, as well as to the Universal Kosmos, the whole being syn=
thesized by the=20

Absolute.  If these three discrete or distributive degrees of Being be conc=
eived, according to the=20

Symbology of all the Eastern Religions, as contained in one Ovum, or EGG, t=
he name of that EGG=20

will be Svabhavat, or the ALL-BEING on the manifested plane. This Universe =
has, in truth, neither=20

centre nor periphery; but in the individual and finite mind of man it has s=
uch a definition, the=20

natural consequence of the limitations of human thought.  In Diagram II., a=
s already stated therein,=20

no notice need be taken of the numbers used in the left-hand column, as the=
se refer only to the=20

Hierarchies of the Colours and Sounds on the metaphysical plane, and are no=
t the characteristic=20

numbers of the human principles or of the planets. The human principles elu=
de enumeration,=20

because each man differs from every other, just as no two blades of grass o=
n the whole earth are=20

absolutely alike. Numbering is here a question of spiritual progress and th=
e natural predominance=20

of one principle over another. With one man it may be Buddhi that stands as=
 number one; with=20

another, if he be a bestial sensualist, the Lower Manas. With one the physi=
cal body, or perhaps=20

Prana, the life principle, will be on the first and highest plane, as would=
 be the case in an=20

extremely healthy man, full of vitality; with another it may come as the si=
xth or even seventh=20

downward. Again, the colours and metals corresponding to the planets and hu=
man principles, as=20

will be observed, are not those known exoterically to modern Astrologers an=
d Western Occultists.=20

Let us see whence the modern Astrologer got his notions about the correspon=
dence of planets,=20

metals and colours. And here we are reminded of the modern Orientalist, who=
, judging by=20

appearances credits the ancient Akkadians (and also the Chaldaeans, Hindus =
and Egyptians) with=20

the crude notion that the Universe, and in like manner the earth, was like =
an inverted, bell-shaped=20

bowl! This he demonstrates by pointing to the symbolical representations of=
 some Akkadian=20

inscriptions and to the Assyrian carvings. It is, however, no place here to=
 explain how mistaken is=20

the Assyriologist, for all such representations are simply symbolical of th=
e _Khargakkurra_, the=20

World-Mountain, or Meru, and relate only to the North Pole, the Land of the=
 Gods. Now, the=20

Assyrians arranged their _exoteric_ teaching about the planets and their co=
rrespondences as=20

follows:  Diagram II.  _Numbers._   _Planets._   _Metals._      _Colours._ =

     Silver-      Monday.=20

white.  This is the arrangement now adopted by Christian Astrologers, with =
the exception of the=20

order of the days of the week, of which, by associating the solar planetary=
 names with the lunar=20

weeks, they have made a sore mess, as has been already shown in Paper I. Th=
is is the Ptolemaic=20

geocentric system, which represents the Universe as in the following diagra=
m, showing our Earth=20

in the centre of the Universe, and the Sun a Planet, the fourth in number. =
 And if the Christian=20

chronology and order of the days of the week are being daily denounced as b=
eing based on an=20

entirely wrong astronomical foundation, it is high time to begin a reform a=
lso in Astrology built on=20

such lines, and coming to us entirely from the Chaldaean and Assyrian exote=
ric mob.  But the=20

correspondences given in these Papers are purely Esoteric. For this reason =
it follows that when=20

the Planets of the Solar System are named or symbolized (as in Diagram II.)=
 it must not be=20

supposed that the planetary bodies themselves are referred to, except as ty=
pes on a purely=20

physical plane of the septenary nature of the psychic and spiritual worlds.=
 A material planet can=20

correspond only to a material something. Thus when Mercury is said to corre=
spond to the right=20

eye, it does not mean that the objective planet has any influence on the ri=
ght optic organ, but that=20

both stand rather as corresponding mystically through Buddhi. Man derives h=
is Spiritual Soul=20

(Buddhi) from the essence of the Manasa Putra, the Sons of Wisdom, who are =
the Divine Beings=20

(or Angels) ruling and presiding over the planet Mercury.  In the same way =
Venus, Manas and the=20

left eye are set down as correspondences. Exoterically, there is, in realit=
y, no such association of=20

physical eyes and physical planets; but Esoterically there is; for the righ=
t eye is the "Eye of=20

Wisdom," _i.e._, it corresponds magnetically with that Occult centre in the=
 brain which we call the=20

"Third Eye";(782) while the left corresponds with the intellectual brain, o=
r those cells which are the=20

organ on the physical plane of the thinking faculty. The kabalistic triangl=
e of Kether, Chokmah and=20

Binah shows this. Chokmah and Binah, or Wisdom and Intelligence, the Father=
 and Mother, or,=20

again, the Father and Son, are on the same plane and reaect mutually on one=
 another.  When the=20

individual consciousness is turned inward, a conjunction of Manas and Buddh=
i takes place. In the=20

spiritually regenerated man this conjunction is permanent, the Higher Manas=
 clinging to Buddhi=20

beyond the threshold of Devachan, and the Soul, or rather the Spirit, which=
 should not be=20

confounded with Atma, the Super-Spirit, is then said to have the "Single Ey=
e." Esoterically, in other=20

words, the "Third Eye" is active. Now Mercury is called Hermes, and Venus, =
Aphrodite, and thus=20

their conjunction in man on the psycho-physical plane gives him the name of=
 the Hermaphrodite,=20

or Androgyne. The absolutely Spiritual Man is, however, entirely disconnect=
ed from sex. The=20

Spiritual Man corresponds directly with the higher "coloured circles," the =
Divine Prism which=20

emanates from the One Infinite White Circle; while physical man emanates fr=
om the Sephiroth,=20

which are the Voices or Sounds of Eastern Philosophy. And these "Voices" ar=
e lower than the=20

"Colours," for they are the seven lower Sephiroth, or the objective Sounds,=
 seen, not heard, as the=20

_Zohar_ shows,(783) and even the Old Testament also. For, when properly tra=
nslated, verse 18 of=20

chapter xx. _Exodus_ would read: "And the people saw the Voices" (or Sounds=
, not the=20

"thunderings" as now translated); and these Voices, or Sounds, are the Seph=
iroth.(784)  In the=20

same way the right and left nostrils, into which is breathed the "Breath of=
 Lives"(785) are here said=20



to correspond with Sun and Moon, as Brahma-Prajapati and Vach, or Osiris an=
d Isis, are the=20

parents of the natural life. This Quaternary, _viz._: the two eyes and two =
nostrils, Mercury and=20

Venus, Sun and Moon, constitutes the Kabalistic Guardian- Angels of the Fou=
r Corners of the=20

Earth. It is the same in the Eastern Esoteric Philosophy, which, however, a=
dds that the Sun is not=20

a planet, but the central star of our system, and the Moon a dead planet, f=
rom which all the=20

principles are gone, both being substitutes, the one for an invisible inter=
-Mercurial planet, and the=20

other for a planet which seems to have now altogether disappeared from view=
. These are the Four=20

Maharajahs,(786) the "Four Holy Ones" connected with Karma and Humanity, Ko=
smos and Man,=20

in all their aspects. They are: the Sun, or its substitute Michael; Moon, o=
r substitute Gabriel;=20

Mercury, Raphael; and Venus, Uriel. It need hardly be said here again that =
the planetary bodies=20

themselves, being only physical symbols, are not often referred to in the E=
soteric System, but, as=20

a rule, their cosmic, psychic, physical and spiritual forces are symbolized=
 under these names. In=20

short, it is the seven physical planets which are the lower Sephiroth of th=
e _Kabalah_, and our=20

triple physical Sun whose reflection only we see, which is symbolized, or r=
ather personified, by the=20

Upper Triad, or Sephirothal Crown.(787)  Then, again, it will be well to po=
int out that the numbers=20

attached to the psychic principles in Diagram I. appear the reverse of thos=
e in exoteric writings.=20

This is because numbers in this connection are purely arbitrary, changing w=
ith every school. Some=20

schools count three, some four, some six, and others seven, as do all the B=
uddhist Esotericists.=20

As said before,(788) the Esoteric School has been divided into two departme=
nts since the=20

fourteenth century, one for the inner Lanoos, or higher Chelas, the other f=
or the outer circle, or lay=20

Chelas. Mr. Sinnett was distinctly told in the letters he received from one=
 of the Gurus that he=20

could not be taught the real Esoteric Doctrine given out only to the pledge=
d disciples of the Inner=20

Circle. The numbers and principles do not go in regular sequence, like the =
skins of an onion, but=20

the student must work out for himself the number appropriate to each of his=
 principles, when the=20

time comes for him to enter upon practical study. The above will suggest to=
 the student the=20

necessity of knowing the principles by their names and their appropriate fa=
culties apart from any=20

system of enumeration, or by association with their corresponding centres o=
f actions, colours,=20

sounds, etc., until these become inseparable.  The old and familiar mode of=
 reckoning the=20

principles, given in the _Theosophist_ and _Esoteric Buddhism_, leads to an=
other apparently=20

perplexing contradiction, though it is really none at all. The principles n=
umbered 3 and 2, _viz._:=20

Linga Sharira and Prana, or Jiva, stand in the reverse order to that given =
in Diagram I. A moment's=20

consideration will suffice to explain the apparent discrepancy between the =
exoteric enumeration,=20

and the Esoteric order given in Diagram I. For in Diagram I. the Linga Shar=
ira is defined as the=20

vehicle of Prana, or Jiva, the life principle, and as such must of necessit=
y be inferior to Prana, not=20

superior as the exoteric enumeration would suggest. The principles do not s=
tand one above the=20

other, and thus cannot be taken in numerical sequence; their order depends =
upon the superiority=20

and predominance of one or another principle, and therefore differs in ever=
y man.  The Linga=20

Sharira is the double, or protoplasmic antetype of the body, which is its i=
mage. It is in this sense=20

that it is called in Diagram II. the parent of the physical body, _i.e._, t=
he mother by conception of=20

Prana, the father. This idea is conveyed in the Egyptian mythology by the b=
irth of Horus, the child=20

of Osiris and Isis, although, like all sacred Mythoi, this has both a three=
fold spiritual, and a=20

sevenfold psycho- physical application. To close the subject, Prana, the li=
fe principle, can, in sober=20



truth, have no number, as it pervades every other principle, or the human t=
otal. Each number of=20

the seven would thus be naturally applicable to Prana-Jiva exoterically as =
it is to the Auric Body=20

Esoterically. As Pythagoras showed, Kosmos was produced not _through_ or _b=
y_ number, but=20

geometrically, _i.e._, following the proportions of numbers.               =
     ------------------------------------

-  To those who are unacquainted with the exoteric astrological natures asc=
ribed in practice to the=20

planetary bodies, it may be useful if we set them down here after the manne=
r of Diagram II., in=20

relation to their dominion over the human body, colours, metals, etc., and =
explain at the same time=20

why genuine Esoteric Philosophy differs from the astrological claims.  _Pla=

the queen, Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen, in which=
 King Charles=20

demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded him.  =
"Well?" asked=20

Athos, when he had closed the letter.  "Well," said the queen, "it has been=
 refused."  The two=20

friends exchanged a smile of contempt.  "And now," said Athos, "what is to =
be done? I have the=20

honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur d'Herblay and m=
yself to do in your=20

service. We are ready."  "Ah, sir, you have a noble heart!" exclaimed the q=
ueen, with a burst of=20

gratitude; whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said, "D=
id I not answer for=20

them?"  "But you, sir?" said the queen to Aramis.  "I, madame," replied he,=
 "follow Monsieur de la=20

Fere wherever he leads, even were it on to death, without demanding wherefo=
re; but when it=20

concerns your majesty's service, then," added he, looking at the queen with=
 all the grace of former=20

days, "I precede the count."  "Well, then, gentlemen," said the queen, "sin=
ce it is thus, and since=20

you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom=
 the whole world has=20

abandoned, this is what is required to be done for me. The king is alone wi=
th a few gentlemen,=20

whom he fears to lose every day; surrounded by the Scotch, whom he distrust=
s, although he be=20

himself a Scotchman. Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted, sirs. I=
 ask much, too much,=20

perhaps, for I have no title to request it. Go to England, join the king, b=
e his friends, protectors,=20

march to battle at his side, and be near him in his house, where conspiraci=
es, more dangerous=20

than the perils of war, are hatching every day. And in exchange for the sac=
rifice that you make,=20

gentlemen, I promise--not to reward you, I believe that word would offend y=
ou--but to love you as a=20

sister, to prefer you, next to my husband and my children, to every one. I =
swear it before Heaven."=20

And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward.  "Madame," said Athos, "when=
 must we set out?"=20

"You consent then?" exclaimed the queen, joyfully.  "Yes, madame; only it s=
eems to me that your=20

majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above =
our merit. We render=20

service to God, madame, in serving a prince so unfortunate, a queen so virt=
uous. Madame, we are=20

yours, body and soul."  "Oh, sirs," said the queen, moved even to tears, "t=
his is the first time for=20

five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope. God, who can read=
 my heart, all the=20

gratitude I feel, will reward you! Save my husband! Save the king, and alth=
ough you care not for=20

the price that is placed upon a good action in this world, leave me the hop=
e that we shall meet=20

again, when I may be able to thank you myself. In the meantime, I remain he=
re. Have you anything=20

to ask of me? From this moment I become your friend, and since you are enga=
ged in my affairs I=20



ought to occupy myself in yours."  "Madame," replied Athos, "I have only to=
 ask your majesty's=20

prayers."  "And I," said Aramis, "I am alone in the world and have only you=
r majesty to serve."  The=20

queen held out her hand, which they kissed, and she said in a low tone to D=
e Winter:  "If you need=20

money, my lord, separate the jewels I have given you; detach the diamonds a=
nd sell them to some=20

Jew. You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs; spend them i=
f necessary, but let these=20

gentlemen be treated as they deserve, that is to say, like kings."  The que=
en had two letters ready,=20

one written by herself, the other by her daughter, the Princess Henrietta. =
Both were addressed to=20

King Charles. She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis, so that =
should they be=20

separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king; after whi=
ch they withdrew.=20

At the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped.  "Not to arouse suspicions,=
 gentlemen," said he,=20

"go your way and I will go mine, and this evening at nine o'clock we will a=
ssemble again at the=20

Gate Saint Denis. We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go a=
nd afterward we can=20

take the post. Once more, let me thank you, my good friends, both in my own=
 name and the=20

queen's."  The three gentlemen then shook hands, Lord de Winter taking the =
Rue Saint Honore,=20

and Athos and Aramis remaining together.  "Well," said Aramis, when they we=
re alone, "what do=20

you think of this business, my dear count?"  "Bad," replied Athos, "very ba=
d."  "But you received it=20

with enthusiasm."  "As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principl=
e, my dear D'Herblay.=20

Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy, but aristocr=
acy cannot survive=20

without the countenance of monarchs. Let us, then, support monarchy, in ord=
er to support=20

ourselves.  "We shall be murdered there," said Aramis. "I hate the English-=
-they are coarse, like=20

every nation that swills beer."  "Would it be better to remain here," said =
Athos, "and take a turn in=20

the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Mo=
nsieur de Beaufort?=20

I'faith, Aramis, believe me, there is little left to regret. We avoid impri=
sonment and we play the part=20

of heroes; the choice is easy."  "It is true; but in everything, friend, on=
e must always return to the=20

same question--a stupid one, I admit, but very necessary--have you any mone=
y?"  "Something like=20

a hundred pistoles, that my farmer sent to me the day before I left Bragelo=
nne; but out of that sum=20

I ought to leave fifty for Raoul--a young man must live respectably. I have=
 then about fifty pistoles.=20

And you?"  "As for me, I am quite sure that after turning out all my pocket=
s and emptying my=20

drawers I shall not find ten louis at home. Fortunately Lord de Winter is r=
ich."  "Lord de Winter is=20

ruined for the moment; Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources."  =
"Now is the time=20

when Baron Porthos would be useful."  "Now it is that I regret D'Artagnan."=
  "Let us entice them=20

away."  "This secret, Aramis, does not belong to us; take my advice, then, =
and let no one into our=20

confidence. And moreover, in taking such a step we should appear to be doub=
tful of ourselves. Let=20

us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes, but not speak of it=
."  "You are right; but=20

what are you going to do until this evening? I have two things to postpone.=
"  "And what are they?"=20

"First, a thrust with the coadjutor, whom I met last night at Madame de Ram=
bouillet's and whom I=20

found particular in his remarks respecting me."  "Oh, fie--a quarrel betwee=
n priests, a duel=20

between allies!"  "What can I do, friend? he is a bully and so am I; his ca=
ssock is a burden to him=20

and I imagine I have had enough of mine; in fact, there is so much resembla=
nce between us that I=20

sometimes believe he is Aramis and I am the coadjutor. This kind of life fa=
tigues and oppresses=20

me; besides, he is a turbulent fellow, who will ruin our party. I am convin=
ced that if I gave him a=20

box on the ear, such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splas=
hed me, it would change=20



the appearance of things."  "And I, my dear Aramis," quietly replied Athos,=
 "I think it would only=20

change Monsieur de Retz's appearance. Take my advice, leave things just as =
they are; besides,=20

you are neither of you now your own masters; he belongs to the Fronde and y=
ou to the queen of=20

England. So, if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend t=
o is not more important=20

than the first----"  "Oh! that is of the first importance."  "Attend to it,=
 then, at once."  "Unfortunately,=20

it is a thing that I can't perform at any time I choose. It was arranged fo=
r the evening and no other=20

time will serve."  "I understand," said Athos smiling, "midnight."  "About =
that time."  "But, my dear=20

fellow, those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off, es=
pecially with so good an=20

excuse to give on your return----"  "Yes, if I return."  "If you do not ret=
urn, how does it concern you?=20

Be reasonable. Come, you are no longer twenty years old."  "To my great reg=
ret, mordieu! Ah, if I=20

were but twenty years old!"  "Yes," said Athos, "doubtless you would commit=
 great follies! But now=20

we must part. I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write. C=
all for me at eight o'clock=20

or shall I wait supper for you at seven?"  "That will do very well," said A=
ramis. "I have twenty visits=20

to make and as many letters to write."  They then separated. Athos went to =
pay a visit to Madame=20

de Vendome, left his name at Madame de Chevreuse's and wrote the following =
letter to=20

D'Artagnan:  "Dear Friend,--I am about to set off with Aramis on important =
business. I wished to=20

make my adieux to you, but time does not permit. Remember that I write to y=
ou now to repeat how=20

much affection for you I still cherish.  "Raoul is gone to Blois and is ign=
orant of my departure;=20

watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can; and if by chance =
you receive no=20

news of me three months hence, tell him to open a packet which he will find=
 addressed to him in=20

my bronze casket at Blois, of which I send you now the key.  "Embrace Porth=
os from Aramis and=20

myself. Adieu, perhaps farewell."  At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived; =
he was dressed as an=20

officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and w=
hich he was more=20

than ever ready to draw.  "By-the-bye," he said, "I think that we are decid=
edly wrong to depart=20

thus, without leaving a line for Porthos and D'Artagnan."  "The thing is do=
ne, dear friend," said=20

Athos; "I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself."  "=
You are a wonderful=20

man, my dear count," said Aramis; "you think of everything."  "Well, have y=
ou made up your mind=20

to this journey?"  "Quite; and now that I reflect about it, I am glad to le=
ave Paris at this moment."=20

"And so am I," replied Athos; "my only regret is not having seen D'Artagnan=
; but the rascal is so=20

cunning, he might have guessed our project."  When supper was over Blaisois=
 entered. "Sir," said=20

he, "here is Monsieur d'Artagnan's answer."  "But I did not tell you there =
would be an answer,=20

stupid!" said Athos.  "And I set off without waiting for one, but he called=
 me back and gave me=20

this;" and he presented a little leather bag, plump and giving out a golden=
 jingle.  Athos opened it=20

and began by drawing forth a little note, written in these terms:  "My dear=
 Count,--When one=20

travels, and especially for three months, one never has a superfluity of mo=
ney. Now, recalling=20

former times of mutual distress, I send you half my purse; it is money to o=
btain which I made=20

Mazarin sweat. Don't make a bad use of it, I entreat you.  "As to what you =
say about not seeing=20

you again, I believe not a word of it; with such a heart as yours--and such=
 a sword--one passes=20

through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times, unscathed and unal=
armed. Au revoir, not=20

farewell.  "It is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved =
him; nevertheless, believe=20

that I heartily pray that I may not become to him a father, however much I =
might be proud of such=20

a son.  "Your  "D'Artagnan.  "P.S.--Be it well understood that the fifty lo=
uis which I send are equally=20



for Aramis as for you--for you as Aramis."  Athos smiled, and his fine eye =
was dimmed by a tear.=20

D'Artagnan, who had loved him so tenderly, loved him still, although a Maza=
rinist.  "There are the=20

fifty louis, i'faith," said Aramis, emptying the purse on the table, all be=
aring the effigy of Louis XIII.=20

"Well, what shall you do with this money, count? Shall you keep it or send =
it back?"  "I shall keep=20

it, Aramis, and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it. Wha=
t is offered from a=20

generous heart should be accepted generously. Take twenty-five of them, Ara=
mis, and give me=20

the remaining twenty-five."  "All right; I am glad to see you are of my opi=
nion. There now, shall we=20

start?"  "When you like; but have you no groom?"  "No; that idiot Bazin had=
 the folly to make=20

himself verger, as you know, and therefore cannot leave Notre Dame.  "Very =
well, take Blaisois,=20

with whom I know not what to do, since I already have Grimaud."  "Willingly=
," said Aramis.  At this=20

moment Grimaud appeared at the door. "Ready," said he, with his usual curtn=
ess.  "Let us go,=20

then," said Athos.  The two friends mounted, as did their servants. At the =
corner of the Quai they=20

encountered Bazin, who was running breathlessly.  "Oh, sir!" exclaimed he, =
"thank Heaven I have=20

arrived in time. Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left =
this for you, saying that=20

the letter was important and must be given to you before you left."  "Good,=
" said Aramis, taking a=20

purse which Bazin presented to him. "What is this?"  "Wait, your reverence,=
 there is a letter."  "You=20

know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalie=
r I will break every bone=20

in your body. Give me the letter."  "How can you read?" asked Athos, "it is=
 as dark as a cold oven."=20

"Wait," said Bazin, striking a flint, and setting afire a twisted wax-light=
, with which he started the=20

church candles. Thus illumined, Aramis read the following epistle:  "My dea=
r D'Herblay,--I learned=20

from D'Artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the Comte de la Fere and=
 yourself, that you=20

are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months; as=
 I know that you do=20

not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own accord. He=
re are two hundred=20

pistoles, which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opport=
unity occurs. Do not=20

fear that you put me to inconvenience; if I want money I can send for some =
to any of my chateaux;=20

at Bracieux alone, I have twenty thousand francs in gold. So, if I do not s=
end you more it is=20

because I fear you would not accept a larger sum.  "I address you, because =
you know, that=20

the influence of the solar system in the exoteric kabalistic Astrology is b=
y this method distributed=20

over the entire human body, the  The division being made by the light of Ba=
zin's taper, the two=20

friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined=
 De Winter at the Porte=20

Saint Denis.     43. In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentim=
es the best.   The three=20

gentlemen took the road to Picardy, a road so well known to them and which =
recalled to Athos and=20

Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth.  "If Mousque=
ton were with us,"=20

observed Athos, on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the =
paviers, "how he=20

would tremble at passing this! Do you remember, Aramis, that it was here he=
 received that famous=20

bullet wound?"  "By my faith, 'twould be excusable in him to tremble," repl=
ied Aramis, "for even I=20

feel a shudder at the recollection; hold, just above that tree is the littl=
e spot where I thought I was=20

killed."  It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past. Arriving before =
the inn at which his master=20

and himself had made such an enormous repast, he approached Athos and said,=
 showing him the=20

airhole of the cellar:  "Sausages!"  Athos began to laugh, for this juvenil=
e escapade of his=20

appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person. =
 At last, after traveling=20

two days and a night, they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening, favored =
by magnificent=20

weather. Boulogne was a strong position, then almost a deserted town, built=
 entirely on the=20

heights; what is now called the lower town did not then exist.  "Gentlemen,=
" said De Winter, on=20


_
black to white; but that Esotericism recognizes neither black nor white as =
colours, because it holds=20

religiously to the seven solar or natural colours of the prism. Black and w=
hite are artificial tints.=20

They belong to the Earth, and are only perceived by virtue of the special c=
onstruction of our=20

physical organs. White is the absence of all colours, and therefore no colo=
ur; black is simply the=20

absence of light, and do here as at Paris--let us separate to avoid suspici=
on. I know an inn, little=20

frequented, but of which the host is entirely devoted to me. I will go ther=
e, where I expect to find=20

letters, and you go to the first tavern in the town, to L'Epee du Grand Hen=
ri for instance, refresh=20

yourselves, and in two hours be upon the jetty; our boat is waiting for us =
there."  The matter being=20

thus decided, the two friends found, about=20


_
aspect of white. The seven prismatic colours are direct emanations from the=
 Seven Hierarchies of=20

Being, each of which has a direct bearing upon and relation to one of the h=
uman principles, since=20

each of these Hierarchies is, in fact, the creator and source of the corres=
ponding human principle.=20

Each prismatic colour is called in Occultism the "Father of the Sound" whic=
h corresponds to it;=20

Sound being the Word, or the Logos, of its Father-Thought. This is the reas=
on why sensitives=20

connect every colour with a definite sound, a fact well recognized in Moder=
n Science (_e.g._,=20

Francis Galton's _Human Faculty_). But black and white are entirely negativ=
e colours, and have=20

no representatives in the world of subjective being.  Kabalistic Astrology =
says that the dominion of=20

the planetary bodies in the human brain also is defined thus: there are sev=
en primary groups of=20

faculties, six of which function through the cerebrum, and the seventh thro=
ugh the cerebellum.=20

This is perfectly correct Esoterically. But when it is further said that: S=
aturn governs the devotional=20

faculties; Mercury, the intellectual; Jupiter, the sympathetic; the Sun, th=
e governing faculties; Mars,=20

the selfish; Venus, the tenacious; and the Moon, the instincts;--we say tha=
t the explanation is=20

incomplete and even misleading. For, in the first place, the physical plane=
ts can rule only the=20

physical body and the purely physical functions. All the mental, emotional,=
 psychic and spiritual=20

faculties, are influenced by the Occult properties of the scale of causes w=
hich emanate from the=20

Hierarchies of the Spiritual Rulers of the planets, and not by the planets =
themselves. This scale, as=20

given in Diagram II., leads the student to perceive in the following order:=
 (1) colour; (2) sound; (3)=20

the sound materializes into the spirit of the metals, _i.e._, the metallic =
Elementals; (4) these=20

materialize again into the physical metals; (5) then the harmonial and vibr=
atory radiant essence=20

passes paces further, the tavern indicated. Their horses were fed, but not =
unsaddled; the grooms=20

supped, for it was already late, and their two masters, impatient to return=
, appointed a place of=20

meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a=
 word with any one.=20

It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alone--long enou=
gh since it had been a=20

useless one to Grimaud.  Athos and Aramis walked down toward the port. From=
 their dress,=20

covered with dust, and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man a=
ccustomed to travel=20

is always recognizable, the two friends excited the attention of a few prom=
enaders. There was=20

more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impressi=
on. This man, whom=20

they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves bee=
n remarked by others,=20

was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty. From the moment he per=
ceived them he did=20

not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them=
.  On reaching the=20

jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile=
 and ready rigged as if=20

waiting to start.  "That is doubtless our boat," said Athos.  "Yes," replie=
d Aramis, "and the sloop out=20

there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destinat=
ion; now," continued he,=20

"if only De Winter does not keep us waiting. It is not at all amusing here;=
 there is not a single=20

woman passing."  "Hush!" said Athos, "we are overheard."  In truth, the wal=
ker, who, during the=20

observations of the two friends, had passed and repassed behind them severa=
l times, stopped at=20

the name of De Winter; but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of th=
is name, it might have=20

been by chance he stood so still.  "Gentlemen," said the man, who was young=
 and pale, bowing=20

with ease and courtesy, "pardon my curiosity, but I see you come from Paris=
, or at least that you=20

are strangers at Boulogne."  "We come from Paris,=20


_
"properties" depend upon the rate of vibration of this energy per unit of t=
ime; (6) from plants it=20

passes into the animals; (7) and finally culminates in the "principles" of =
man.  Thus we see the=20

Divine Essence of our Progenitors in Heaven circling through seven stages; =
Spirit becoming=20

Matter, and Matter returning to Spirit. As there is sound in Nature which i=
s inaudible, so there is=20

colour which is invisible, but which can be heard. The creative force, at w=
ork in its incessant task=20

of transformation, produces colour, sound and numbers, in the shape of rate=
s of vibration which=20

compound and dissociate the atoms and molecules. Though invisible and inaud=
ible to us in detail,=20

yet the synthesis of the whole becomes audible to us on the material plane.=
 It is that which the=20

Chinese call the "Great Tone," or _Kung_. It is, even by scientific confess=
ion, the actual tonic of=20

Nature, held by musicians to be the middle Fa on the keyboard of a piano. W=
e hear it distinctly in=20

the voice of Nature, in the roaring of the ocean, in the sound of the folia=
ge of a great forest, in the=20

distant roar of a great city, in the wind, the tempest and the storm; in sh=
ort, in everything in Nature=20

which has a voice or produces sound. To the hearing of all who hearken, it =
culminates in a single=20

definite tone, of an unappreciable pitch, which, as said, is the F, or Fa, =
of the diatonic scale. From=20

these particulars, that wherein lies the difference between the exoteric an=
d the Esoteric=20

nomenclature and symbolism will be evident to the student of Occultism. In =
short, kabalistic=20

Astrology, as practised in Europe, is the semi-esoteric Secret Science, ada=
pted for the outer and=20

not for the inner circle. It is, furthermore, often left incomplete and not=
 infrequently distorted to=20

conceal the real truth. While it symbolizes and adapts its correspondences =
on the mere=20

appearances of things, Esoteric Philosophy, which concerns itself pre-emine=
ntly with the essence=20

of things, accepts only such symbols as cover the whole ground, _i.e._, suc=
h symbols as yield a=20

spiritual as well as a psychic and physical meaning. Yet even Western Astro=
logy has done=20

excellent work, for it has helped to carry the knowledge of the is there we=
 can do for you?"  "Sir,"=20

said the young man, "will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that C=
ardinal Mazarin is no=20

longer minister?"  "That is a strange question," said Aramis.  "He is and h=
e is not," replied Athos;=20

"that is to say, he is dismissed by one-half of France, but by intrigues an=
d promises he makes the=20

other half sustain him; you will perceive that this may last a long time." =
 "However, sir," said the=20

stranger, "he has neither fled nor is in prison?"  "No, sir, not at this mo=
ment at least."  "Sirs, accept=20

my thanks for your politeness," said the young man, retreating.  "What do y=
ou think of that=20

interrogator?" asked Aramis.  "I think he is either a dull provincial perso=
n or a spy in search of=20

information."  "And you replied to him with that notion?"  "Nothing warrant=
ed me to answer him=20

otherwise; he was polite to me and I was so to him."  "But if he be a spy--=
--"  "What do you think a=20

spy would be about here? We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelie=
u, who would have=20

closed the ports on bare suspicion."  "It matters not; you were wrong to re=
ply to him as you did,"=20

continued Aramis, following with his eyes the young man, now vanishing behi=
nd the cliffs.  "And=20

you," said Athos, "you forget that you committed a very different kind of i=
mprudence in=20

pronouncing Lord de Winter's name. Did you not see that at that name the yo=
ung man stopped?"=20

"More reason, then, when he spoke to you, for sending him about his busines=
s."  "A quarrel?"=20

asked Athos.  "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?"  "I am =
always afraid of a=20

quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possi=
bly prevent my=20

reaching it. Besides, let me own something to you. I am anxious to see that=
 young man nearer."=20

"And wherefore?"  "Aramis, you will certainly laugh at me, you will say tha=
t I am always repeating=20



the same thing, you will call me the most timorous of visionaries; but to w=
hom do you see a=20

resemblance in that young man?"  "In beauty or on the contrary?" asked Aram=
is, laughing.  "In=20

ugliness, in so far as a man can resemble a woman."  "Ah! Egad!" cried Aram=
is, "you set me=20

thinking. No, in truth you are no visionary, my dear friend,=20
