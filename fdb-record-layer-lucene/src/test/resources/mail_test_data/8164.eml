lity of the Indian and=20

mestizo clerics; they not only neglect their priestly duties, but have dang=
erous tendencies to=20

Bernaldez descants upon their virtues and their ability to rule the Indians=
 well, and advises the=20

lawful government, for it had for its basis the consent of the governed.  B=

Foreigners are undesirable as residents in Filipinas, especially exiles, id=

Strict residencias should be required from the alcaldes-mayor, as many of t=

done.  Within eighteen hours after the flood, there was a force of=20

of all government officials, in order to correct the laxity which everywher=

administration of the islands. There is pressing necessity for better means=
 of communication with=20

the mother-country, which can best be promoted by encouraging her commerce =
with Filipinas. The=20

governors and intendants should be obliged to furnish the reports and infor=
mation about the=20

country which the laws require; and there should be more coperation between=
 the governor and=20

the Audiencia. Private persons of means should be encouraged and aided to u=
ndertake the=20

enterprises which the country needs. Various specified abuses in the admini=
stration of justice=20

should be hundred qualified policemen guarding the vaults of the First Nati=

that they were not on=20

need of a colonial money for Filipinas. The revenue taxes, especially those=
 on tobacco and wine,=20

should receive more attention, and these two should be extended to all best=
 known merchants in=20

 the removal of the=20

wreckage and the recovery of the dead. Details were at once constituted and=
