f the dracaena marginata his literary portraits is nothing but what Gamalie=
l Bradford accomplished in his, and since Mr. Bradford=E2=80=99s portraits =
came first, they should have the credit and the praise which their sins bef=
ore they dared to follow her sacred banner; in the open air upon the banks =
of the Loire she raised an altar, and all must take communion with her. No =
need of the _
dignity if there ever were a censor who was a connoisseur, who was the patr=
on of good poets and=20

painters, who actively supported a clean stage. But then, if you had the ta=
ste for the best, no=20

inducement whatever would make you give your life to the detection of indec=
ency.  Human nature=20

is wiser in the long run than any censor; in the long run the books of the =
highest decency hold their=20

place in fame by crowding out the others. The public suppresses indecent bo=
oks by reading=20

decent ones. Every artist would respectfully suggest this method to all cen=
sors. Perhaps the=20

censors will say that the method is too slow=E2=80=94that it takes too long=
 for the good books to crowd out=20

the others. It does take too long now, but why not hasten the process by ca=
lling attention to the=20

good books, instead of delaying it by advertising the bad? If the energy wh=
ich now tries to=20

suppress books sure to be forgotten in fifty years, were directed to the en=
couragement of the few=20

books which after fifty years might still be worth reading, the final verdi=
ct of fame might be=20

hastened. But there seems to be a decorum in morals too, or perhaps two dec=
orums, a creative=20

and a negative=E2=80=94one seeking to displace evil by a positive good, the=
 other too much preoccupied=20

with the evil to notice the good at all.     II  ORIGINALITY IN LITERATURE =
  I  If we accept the=20

doctrine of criticism today, originality is a great virtue in a writer, and=
 if we believe the book=20

advertisements, all the new writers as they appear, and as they reappear, h=
ave this virtue to a=20

striking, even to an explosive extent. But with all their originality, some=
 of the new books turn out to=20

be dull, and if we reconsider for a moment the books men have finally judge=
d great, we observe=20

that Jeanne; on the other, leaders and soldiers brutalized by long years of=
 desultory civil war.=20

Think of a Sire de Giac, who gave poison to his wife and then, setting her =
astride a horse, made=20

her gallop till she died. When he was brought to justice he prayed that his=
 right hand, vowed to the=20

service of the devil, might be cut off before his execution, lest the astut=
e ruler of Hades seize the=20

said hand and drag the whole body along with it. Or think, again, of Gilles=
 de Retz, the Marquis de=20

Laval, whose murders of children (to the number of one hundred and sixty, s=
ome say) were so=20

atrocious that he was at last seized, tried, condemned to death at the stak=
e and to eternal, if=20

mistaken, association with that nursery horror, Bluebeard. Think of him rid=
ing beside Jeanne la=20

Pucelle, nay, standing beside her at the coronation in Rheims and fetching =
the sacred ampulla!=20

What an associate for her was even that brave and loyal friend Etienne Vign=
oles, nicknamed=20

Lahire (the Barker), who was wont to say, in extenuation of the universal p=
ractice of plundering=20

and brigandage among the so-called soldiers, "Were God to turn man-at-arms,=
 He too would=20

pillage!" It was he who prayed before a battle, with less reverence but sur=
ely not with less fervency=20

than some other pious soldiers: _Sire Dieu, je te prie de faire pour Lahire=
 ce que Lahire ferait pour=20

toi, si tu etais capitaine et si Lahire etait Dieu_ (Sir God, I pray thee t=
o do for Lahire what Lahire=20

would do for thee, if thou were a soldier and Lahire were God). It is a mos=
t excellent and=20

comprehensive prayer, good to prefer when one has not time to remind the De=
ity of each little=20

thing He should do.  With an army composed of such men, Jeanne d'Arc set ou=
t for Orleans; but=20

she=20


_
rather destitute of the kind of originality we talk of nowadays.  =E2=80=9C=
In poetry, a new cadence means a=20

new idea=E2=80=9D, wrote the imagist some time ago, defending the use of fr=
ee verse. The doctrine was in=20

the interest of the cadence, but it implied something larger and more signi=
ficant, that in poetry=20

newness of ideas is desirable. More recently, an American critic remarked, =
in effect, that what=20

Lytton Strachey has sinners. Accordingly, she insisted that the morals of t=
he camp be reformed.=20

Lahire must swear no more dreadful, soul-blasting oaths; he obeyed, but the=
 good-hearted girl,=20

seeing him at a loss for unseasoned speech, relented so far as to permit hi=
m to swear "by his=20

baton." But the reform did not end with puerile matters; the Pucelle would =
have no loose women=20

about the camp; all her soldiers must go humbly and=20
