s a crackling heap of smoke and flame, that curled up pale in the yet brill=
iant light of the declining sun. Sir Lacy laughed, rubbed his hands, and ba=

f the number obeyed, though the shout better, as it can swell its Crop to t=
he largest Size. The Bodies of this sort are about the bigness of the small=

 smoke and flame, that curled up pale in the yet brilliant light of the dec=
lining sun. Sir Lacy laughed, rubbed his hands, and bade the boys give a go=
od British cheer, if they knew how to do it. About half the number obeyed, =

Bodies of this sort are about the bigness of the smaller Runt, but somewhat=
 more slender. This sort, like the former, is of various Colours in the Fea=

rustic. "Ned Franks, he be our school-master, there; he tells us to work fo=

the poor."  Sir Lacy gave a loud, very scornful whistle, and then a still l=
ouder laugh. "If you listen to=20

such twaddle," he cried, "I'll tell you what you'll come to, my lad. Your e=
ars will grow longer than=20

your purse, and you'll have to take to browsing on thistles, like a donkey,=
 as you are!" and to give=20

point to his wit, the young man caught hold of the ear of the unfortunate b=
oy, and gave it a pull,=20

apparently to hasten the lengthening process, but which had only the effect=
 of forcing out a sharp=20

cry of pain.  The circle of boys reddish Colour, to have long Wings, and to=

They by for the most part two Eggs for one sitting, and so more; but breed =
often in the Year. When=20

Pigeons are once paired, it is observed they are very constant to one anoth=
er, and assist each=20

other in the Incubation or Sitting on the Eggs, as well as in bringing up a=
nd feeding the young=20

ones; and moreover it is remarkable, that a Pigeon has no Gall-Bladder.  Th=

at's that?" asked the=20

baronet, turning to another young worker, who looked by no means anxious to=
 be singled out for=20

conversation with the lord of the manor. Sir Lacy was pointing with his cig=
ar to the great pile=20

collected for making the seven cottage porches.  "Them be branches," stamme=
red out the child.  "I=20

dare say; I did not take them for buttercups, wiseacre! So you've been maki=
ng preparations for a=20

grand bonfire in honor of my return?"  The poor little boy gave a frightene=
d, appealing glance=20

towards Franks.  "Answer me; I suppose you've a tongue in your head," said =
Sir Lacy. Spring as=20

some others: they are, however, a hardy kind, and will thrive any where, if=
 there is plenty of Water;=20

for tho' they are not of a watery Race, yet it is observable, that they cov=
et to be where it is, and=20

that they feed frequently upon the Banks of Rivers and Ponds. I have known =
that where there=20

were two Dove-Cotes, that stood within a Mile of one another, and one of th=
em was near a River,=20

and the other remote from it, the Pigeons of the House distant from the Wat=
er, left their Habitation=20

to reside in that next the River, even tho' they had an Allowance of good F=
eed at home.  Among=20

boy was trembling for his ears.  "Them be for the porches, sir," faltered t=
he poor little fellow, who=20

had been one of the most active in collecting for the purpose the strongest=
 and most pliable=20

branches.  "Ah! but I say they're for a bonfire, and as a bonfire they shal=
l blaze!" cried Sir Lacy.=20

"Here's a light,--you set fire to the heap!"  Again the frightened child lo=
oked to his master, though=20

not daring to refuse to take into his hand the lighted cigar. Franks strode=
 forward, and, with as=20

much calmness as he could command, addressed Sir Lacy Barton.  "I hope, sir=
, that you will not=20

destroy that which it has cost us some time and trouble to collect, and whi=
ch is intended to add to=20

the few comforts of the respectable poor."  "Mind your own business, and ho=

the insolent reply; "and you, little dog, do what I bid you, or Runts, are =

call'd the _Spanish_ Runts, are very much esteem'd, being the largest sort =
of Pigeon, and are=20

sluggish, and more slow of flight, than the smaller sort of Runts; but the =
smaller Runts are better=20

Breeders, and quick of flight, which is to be esteem'd; because if they wer=
e to seek their Food far,=20

they can range much more Ground, or return home much quicker on occasion of=
 stormy or wet=20

Weather. As for the Colours of their Feathers, they are uncertain, so that =
one cannot judge of the=20

sort by them.  The next, which makes the largest Figure, but is not in real=
