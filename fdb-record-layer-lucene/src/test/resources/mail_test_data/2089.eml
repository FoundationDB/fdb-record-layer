as the most distinguished teacher _
to me, _to tend my sheep_, eight years; and if thou fulfil ten _years_, it =
shall be of thine own will;=20

and I desire not to lay a difficulty upon thee _by imposing as a condition =
the ten years_: thou shalt=20

find me, if God please, [one] of the just, _who are faithful to their coven=
ants_. He replied, This [be=20

the covenant] between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfil, the=
re shall be no injustice=20

against me _by demanding an addition thereto_; and God is witness of what w=
e say. _And the=20

marriage-contract was concluded according to this; and Sho'eyb ordered his =
daughter to give unto=20

Moses a rod wherewith to drive away the wild beasts from his sheep: and the=
 rods of the prophets=20

were in his possession; and the rod of Adam, of the myrtle of paradise, fel=
l into her hand; and=20

Moses took it, with the knowledge of Sho'eyb._     (xxviii. 21-28.)   Hath =
the history of Moses been=20

related to thee? when he saw fire,[264] _during his journey from Medyen, on=
 his way to Egypt_,=20

and said unto his family, _or his wife_, Tarry ye _here_; for I have seen f=
ire: perhaps I may bring=20

you a brand from it, or find at the fire a hundreds of monuments upon which=
 the traveller looks with=20

more interest than that of the lovely and unhappy Heloise. There her body l=
ies, with that of her=20

lover-husband, Pierre Abelard. It is her story that we wish to tell; but he=
r fame and that of Abelard=20

are so intimately associated that one cannot tell of Heloise without first =
telling something of=20

Abelard. The debt to fame, however, is not all on her side; to translate th=
e words of a great French=20

historian: "Alone, the name of Abelard would be known to-day only to schola=
rs: linked with the=20

name of Heloise, it is in every heart. Paris, above all,... has kept the me=
mory of the immortal=20

daughter of the Cite with exceptional and unchanging fidelity. The eighteen=
th century and the=20

Revolution, so pitiless towards the Middle Ages, revived this tradition wit=
h the same ardor which=20

led them to destroy so many other memories. The children of Rousseau's disc=
iples still go in=20

pilgrimage to the monument of this great saint of love, and each spring see=
s pious women placing=20

fresh crowns of flowers upon the tomb in which the Revolution reunited the =
two lovers." We shall=20

not,=20


_
_to direct me in the way. For he had missed the way in consequence of the d=
arkness of the night._=20

And when he came unto it (_and it was a bramble-bush_), he was called to [b=
y a voice saying], O=20

Moses, verily I am thy Lord; therefore pull off thy shoes;[265] for thou ar=
t in the holy valley of=20

Tuwa. And I have chosen thee _from among thy people_; wherefore hearken att=
entively unto that=20

which is revealed _unto thee by Me_. Verily I am God: there is no Deity exc=
ept Me; therefore=20

worship Me, and perform prayer in remembrance of Me. Verily the hour is com=
ing: I will manifest it=20

_unto mankind, and its nearness shall appear unto them by its signs_, that =
every soul may be=20

recompensed _therein_ for its good and evil work: therefore let not him who=
 believeth not in it, and=20

followeth his lust, hinder thee from _believing in_ it, lest thou perish. A=
nd what is that in thy right=20

hand, O Moses?--He answered, It is centuries joined together, and shall tel=
l of Abelard as well as=20

of Heloise.  The great University of Paris was already famous in the twelft=
h century. Professors,=20

most of them ecclesiastics, lectured on all the foolish subtilties of the l=
earning of the day to crowds=20

of students collected from every quarter of Europe. At the monastic school =
of Notre Dame the=20

most distinguished lecturer on dialectic,--meaning philosophy and logic as =
applied to philosophy,--

at the close of the eleventh century, was Guillaume de Champeaux. The metho=
d of instruction=20

was, necessarily, almost entirely oral, for books were worth almost their w=
eight in coin. It was the=20

custom for the professor to encourage discussions with the students and to =
overwhelm them with=20

the weight of his wisdom and the acuteness of his reasoning. In this fashio=
n Guillaume had long=20

triumphed, and had, we may fancy, acquired no little of that dogmatic=20


_
I beat down leaves for my sheep _that they may eat them_; and I have other =
uses for it, _as the=20

carrying of provision and the water-skin, and the driving away of reptiles_=
. He said, Cast it down,=20

O Moses. So he cast it down; and lo, it was a serpent,[266] running along. =
_God_ said, Take it,=20

and fear _it_ not:[267] we will restore it to its former state. _And he put=
 his hand into its mouth;=20

whereupon it became again a rod._ [And God said,] And put thy _right_ hand =
to thy _left_ arm-pit,=20

_and take it forth_: it shall come forth white, without evil, (_that is, wi=
thout leprosy; shining like the=20

rays of the sun, dazzling the sight,_) as another sign, that We may show th=
ee the greatest of our=20

signs _of thine apostleship_. (_And when he desired to restore his hand to =
its first state, he put it=20

as before described, and drew it forth._) Go _as an apostle_ unto Pharaoh _=
and those who are=20

with him_; for he hath acted with exceeding impiety _by arrogating to himse=
lf divinity_.--_Moses_=20

said, O my Lord, dilate my bosom, _that it may hear the message_, and make =
my affair easy unto=20

me, and loose the knot of my tongue (_this had arisen from his having been =
burned in his mouth=20

by a live coal when he was a child_),[268] that they may understand my spee=
ch _when I deliver=20

the message_. And appoint unto me a Wezeer of my family, _namely_ Aaron [Ha=
roon] my brother.=20

Strengthen my back by him, and make him a colleague in my affair, that we m=
ay glorify Thee=20

much, and remember Thee much; for Thou knowest us.  God replied, Thou hast =
obtained thy=20

petition, O Moses, and We have been gracious unto thee another time: forasm=
uch as We revealed=20

unto thy mother what was revealed, _when she gave birth to thee and feared =
that Pharaoh would=20

kill thee among the others that were born_, [saying,] Cast him into the ark=
, and then cast him, _in=20

the ark_, into the river _Nile_, and the river shall throw him on the shore=
; then an enemy unto Me=20

and an enemy unto him (_namely Pharaoh_) shall take him. And I bestowed on =
thee, _after he=20

had taken thee_, love from Me, _that thou mightest be loved by men, so that=
 Pharaoh and all that=20

saw thee loved thee_; and that thou mightest be bred up in Mine eye. [Also]=
 forasmuch as thy=20

sister _Maryam_ went _that she might learn what became of thee, after they =
had brought nurses=20

and thou hadst refused to take the breast of any one of them_, and she said=
, Shall I direct you=20

unto one who will nurse him? (_whereupon her proposal was_ _accepted, and h=
abit of mind which=20

is fostered by unchallenged teaching. About the year 1100 his ascendency wa=
s seriously=20

threatened by a young Breton, scarcely yet a man, who had come to his schoo=
l as a student and=20

had had the temerity to overcome him in argument. This was Pierre Abelard, =
soon famous as a=20

logician, philosopher, and theologian, now remembered chiefly because of hi=
s connection with the=20

fair and noble Heloise. Abelard was born at Pallet, or Palais, not far from=
 Nantes. He was the=20

eldest son of a family of some distinction, and his father, Berenger, was d=
etermined to give his son=20

an education in keeping with his own knightly rank. Berenger himself was be=
tter educated than=20

most of the gentlemen of his class, and there seems to have been a decided =
leaning to=20

devoutness in the family, since both Berenger and his wife, Lucie, took mon=
astic vows later in life.=20

At any rate, Pierre, after a taste of learning, determined to devote himsel=
f entirely to the pursuit of=20

knowledge. Let us see how he tells this part of his own story. "The progres=
s that I made in learning=20

attached me to its pursuit with an ever increasing ardor, and such was the =
charm that it exercised=20

over my mind that, renouncing the glory of arms, my own heritage, my own pr=
ivileges as eldest=20

son, I abandoned forever the camp of Mars to take refuge in the bosom of Mi=
nerva. Preferring the=20

art of dialectic to all the other teachings of philosophy, I exchanged the =
arms of war for those of=20

logic, and sacrificed trophies of the battlefield for the joys of contest i=
n argument. I took to=20



travelling from province to province, going wherever I heard that the study=
 of this art received=20

special honor, and always engaging in argument, like a veritable emulator o=
f the Peripatetics."  In=20

this way, Abelard, still under twenty, came to the school of Guillaume de C=
hampeaux. Received at=20

first with honor, as an intelligent pupil, Abelard remained some time, perh=
aps two years. But his=20

restless, inquisitive, and, above all, rational mind could not accept calml=
y what seemed to it=20

untrue. Abelard, a mere boy, dared to dispute with his master, Guillaume, a=
nd, what is far worse,=20

to get the better of arguments on Guillaume's own peculiar subject. The sch=
ool was divided into=20

two parties. Guillaume, being the more influential, prevented his pupil fro=
m establishing himself as=20

a lecturer in Paris, and Abelard removed to Melun, at that time a royal res=
idence and a city of=20

some importance. Here he opened a=20


_
mother, that her eye might become cheerful and that she might not grieve. A=
nd thou slewest a=20

soul, _namely the Copt in Egypt, and wast sorry for his slaughter, on accou=
nt of Pharaoh_, and=20

We delivered thee from sorrow; and We tried thee with _other_ trial, _and d=
elivered thee from=20

it_.[269] And thou stayedst _ten_ years among the people of Medyen, _after =
thou hadst come=20

thither from Egypt, at the abode of Sho'eyb the prophet, and he married the=
e to his daughter._=20

Then thou camest according to _My_ decree, _as to the time of thy mission, =
when thou hadst=20

attained the age of forty years_, O Moses; and I have chosen thee for Mysel=
f. Go thou and thy=20

brother[270] _unto the greatly, in spite of the jealousy of Guillaume and t=
he older teachers, that he=20

removed to Corbeil, near Paris, and was soon recognized as more than the eq=
ual of his old=20

instructor. But his health broke down under the strain; he retired to rest =
and recuperate in his=20

native land, and remained there several years. Returning about 1108, he aga=
in met Guillaume in=20

argument, in the convent of Saint-Victor, outside Paris, and again vanquish=
ed him, this time so=20

completely that Guillaume gave up his chair in Paris. His jealousy, however=
, still kept Abelard from=20

establishing himself in the great city. The young philosopher opened his sc=
hool on Mont Sainte-

Genevieve, a hill just=20
