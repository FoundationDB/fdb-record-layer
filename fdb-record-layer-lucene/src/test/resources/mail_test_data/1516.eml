we separated, and, no doubt, for years afterwards our meeting was the subje=
ct of his talk.  No doubt the citizens of Ytapua were scandalized _
"So would I."  On the right of Paul sat a man of about forty, well-dressed =
and respectable in=20

appearance, with a heavy gold chain ostentatiously depending from his watch=
 pocket, and with the=20

air of a substantial citizen. He listened to the conversation between Barry=
 and Paul with evident=20

interest, and when Barry had returned the ring, he said:  "Young gentleman,=
 would you be kind=20

enough to let me look at your ring? I am myself in business as a jeweler in=
 Syracuse, and so feel=20

an interest in examining it."  "Certainly, sir," said Paul, the stranger's =
explanation of his motives=20

inspiring him with perfect confidence.  The jeweler from Syracuse took the =
ring in his hands and=20

appeared to examine it carefully.  "This is a handsome ring," he said, "and=
 one of great value. How=20

much were you offered for it at Tiffany's?"  "Two hundred and fifty dollars=
."  "It is worth more."=20

"Yes, I suppose so," said Paul; "but he has to sell it, and make a profit."=
  "He could do that, and yet=20

make a profit. I will pay you two hundred and seventy-five dollars, myself-=
-that is, on one=20

condition."  "I don't object to getting twenty-five dollars more," said Pau=
l. "What is the condition?"=20

"I have an order from a gentleman for a diamond ring for a young lady--an e=
ngagement ring, in=20

short. If this suits him, as I think it will, I will pay you what I said. I=
 can easily get three hundred and=20

twenty-five from him."  "How are you going to find out whether it will suit=
 him?"  "Easily. He is=20

stopping at the same hotel with me."  "What hotel is that?"  "Lovejoy's. If=
 you can spare the time=20

and will come with me now, we can arrange matters at once. By the way, you =
can refer me to=20

some responsible citizen, who will guarantee you. Not, of course, that I ha=
ve any doubts, but we=20

business men are forced to be cautious."  Paul mentioned Mr. Preston's name=
.  "Quite=20

satisfactory," answered the jeweler. "I know Mr. Preston personally, and as=
 I am pressed for time, I=20

will accept his name without calling upon him. What is your name?"  "Paul H=
offman."  "I will note it=20

down."  The gentleman from Syracuse drew out a memorandum book, in which he=
 entered Paul's=20

name.  "When you see Mr. Preston, just mention my name; Felix Montgomery." =
 "I will do so."=20

"Say, if you please, that I would have called upon him, but, coming to the =
city strictly on business,=20

was too hurried to do so."  This also Paul promised, and counted himself fo=
rtunate in falling in with=20

a friend, or, at all events, acquaintance of Mr. Preston, since he was like=
ly to make twenty-five=20

dollars more than he would otherwise have done.  When he got out of the car=
 at the Astor House,=20

the stranger said:  "It will be half an hour before I can reach Lovejoy's, =
as I have a business call to=20

make first. Can you call there, say, in three-quarters of an hour?"  "Yes, =
sir."  "Very well, then, I will=20

expect you. Inquire for me at the desk, and ask the servant to conduct you =
to my room--you=20

remember my name?"  "Yes, sir--Mr. Felix Montgomery."  "Quite right. Good-b=
y, then, till we=20

meet."  Mr. Felix Montgomery went into the Astor House, and remained about =
five minutes. He=20

then came out on the steps, and, looking about him to see if Paul was anywh=
ere near, descended=20

the steps, and walked across to Lovejoy's Hotel. Going up to the desk, he i=
nquired:  "Can you=20

accommodate me with a room?"  "Yes, sir; please enter your name."  The stra=
nger entered his=20

name with a flourish, as Felix Montgomery, Syracuse.  "Room No. 237," said =
the clerk; "will you go=20

up now?"  "Yes, I think so."  "Any luggage?"  "My trunk will be brought fro=
m the St. Nicholas in the=20

course of the afternoon."  "We require payment in advance where there is no=
 luggage."  "Very=20

well. I will pay for one day. I am not sure but I shall get through my busi=
ness in time to go away to-

morrow."  Here the servant appeared to conduct Mr. Montgomery to his room. =
 "By the way," he=20

said, turning back, as if it were an afterthought, "I directed a boy to cal=
l here for me in about half=20

an hour. When he comes you may send him up to my room."  "Very well, sir." =
 Mr. Montgomery=20



followed the servant upstairs to room No. 237. It was rather high up, but h=
e seemed well pleased=20

that this was the case.  "Hope you won't get tired of climbing, sir," said =
the servant.  "No--I've got=20

pretty good wind."  "Most gentlemen complain of going up so far."  "It make=
s little difference to=20

me."  At length they reached the room, and Mr. Montgomery entered.  "This w=
ill answer very well,"=20

he said, with a hasty glance about him. "When my trunk comes, I want it sen=
t up."  "Yes, sir."  "I=20

believe that is all; you can go."  The servant retired and Mr. Felix Montgo=
mery sat down upon the=20

bed.  "My little plot seems likely to succeed," he said to himself. "I've b=
een out of luck lately, but=20

this boy's ring will give me a lift. He can't suspect greatly in the mounta=
in paths.  In Candelaria, for=20

the first time for many months, we sat down to a regular meal, in a buildin=
g called =E2=80=9CEl Hotel=20

Internacional=E2=80=9D; drank wine of a suspicious kind, and seemed to have=
 arrived in Paris, so great the=20

change to the wild camps beside the forests, or the nights passed in the lo=
ne ranchos of the hilly=20

district of Brazil.  A balsa drawn by a tug-boat took us across the Parana,=
 here more than a mile=20

broad, to Ytapua, and upon landing we found ourselves in quite another worl=
d.  The little=20

Paraguayan town of Ytapua, called by the Jesuits Encarnacion, lay, with its=
 little port below it=20

(where my friend Enrico Clerici had his store), upon a plateau hanging abov=
e the stream. The=20

houses, built of canes and thatched with straw, differed extremely from the=
 white =E2=80=9Cazotea=E2=80=9D houses=20

of the Candelaria on the other side.  The people, dress, the vegetation, an=
d the mode of life,=20

differed still more in every aspect.  The Paraguayan, with his shirt hangin=
g outside his white duck=20

trousers, bare feet, and cloak made of red cloth or baize, his broad straw =
hat and quiet manner,=20

was the complete antithesis of the high-booted, loose-trousered, poncho-wea=
ring Correntino, with=20

his long knife and swaggering Gaucho air.  The one a horseman of the plains=
, the other a footman=20

of the forests; the Correntino brave even to rashness when taken man for ma=
n, but so incapable of=20

discipline as to be practically useless as a soldier.  The other as quiet a=
s a sheep, and individually=20

patient even to suffering blows, but once gathered together and instructed =
in the use of arms, as=20

good a soldier, when well led, as it is possible to find; active and temper=
ate, brave, and, if rather=20

unintelligent, eager to risk his life at any time at the command of any of =
his chiefs.  Such was the=20

material from which Lopez, coward and grossly incompetent as he was, formed=
 the battalions=20

which for four years kept both Buenos Ayres and Brazil at bay, and only yie=
lded when he himself=20

was killed, mounted, as tradition has it, on the last horse of native breed=
 left in the land.  But if the=20

people and their dwellings were dissimilar, the countries in themselves wer=
e to the full at least as=20

different.  All through the upper part of Corrientes the soil is black, and=
 the country open, park-like=20

prairie dotted with trees; in Ytapua and the surrounding district, the eart=
h bright red, and the=20

primeval forest stretches close to the water=E2=80=99s edge.  In Corrientes=
 still the trees of the Pampas are=20

occasionally seen, Talas and =C3=B1andubay with Coronillo and Lapacho; wher=
eas in Paraguay, as by a=20

bound, you pass to Curupay, {60a} Tatan=C3=A9, {60b} the Tarum=C3=A1, {60c}=
 the =C3=91andip=C3=A1, {60d} the=20

ry tree lianas cling with=20

orchidace=C3=A6, known to the natives as =E2=80=9Cflowers of the air,=E2=80=
=9D and through them all flit great butterflies,=20

humming-birds dart, and underneath the damp vegetation of the sub-tropics, =
emphorbiace=C3=A6,=20

solanace=C3=A6, myrtace=C3=A6, and flowers and plants to drive a thousand b=
otanists to madness, blossom=20

and die unnamed. Here, too, the language changed, and Guarani became the do=
minant tongue,=20

which, though spoken in Corrientes, is there used but occasionally, but amo=
ng Paraguayans is=20

their native speech, only the Alcaldes, officers, and upper classes as a ge=
neral rule (at that time)=20



speaking Spanish, and even then with a strange accent and much mixed with G=
uarani.  Two days=20

we passed in Ytapua resting our horses, and I renewed my friendship with En=
rico Clerici, an=20

Italian, who had served with Garibaldi, and who, three years ago, I had met=
 in the same place and=20

given him a silver ring which he reported galvanized, and was accustomed to=
 lend as a great=20

favour for a specific against rheumatism.  He kept a pulperia, and being a =
born fighter, his delight=20

was, when a row occurred (which he styled =E2=80=9Cuna barulla de Jesu Cris=
to=E2=80=9D), to clear the place by=20

flinging empty bottles from the bar.  A handsome, gentlemanlike man, and te=
rrible with a bottle in=20

his hand, whether as weapon of offence or for the purposes of drink; withal=
 well educated, and no=20

doubt by this time long dead, slain by his favourite weapon, and his place =
filled by some fat,=20

double-entry Basque or grasping Catalan, or by some portly emigrant from Ge=
rmany.  Not wishing=20

to be confined within a house, a prey to the mosquitoes, we camped in the c=
hief square, and=20

strolling round about the town, I came on an old friend.  Not far outside t=
he village a Correntino=20

butcher had his shop, a little straw-thatched hut, with strings of fresh je=
rked beef festooning all the=20

place; the owner stood outside dressed in the costume of a Gaucho of the so=
uthern plains.  I did=20

not know him, and we began to talk, when I perceived, tied underneath a she=
d, a fine, dark=20

chestnut horse, saddled and bitted in the=20


_
Probably the reader has already suspected that Mr. Felix Montgomery was not=
 a jeweler from=20

Syracuse, nor had he any claim to the name under which he at present figure=
d. He was a noted=20

confidence man, who lived by preying upon the community. His appearance was=
 in his favor, and=20

it was his practice to assume the dress and air of a respectable middle-age=
d citizen, as in the=20

present instance. The sight of the diamond ring had excited his cupidity, a=
nd he had instantly=20

formed the design of getting possession of it, if possible. Thus far, his p=
lan promised success.=20

Meanwhile, Paul loitered away the time in the City Hall Park for half an ho=
ur or more. He did not=20

care to go home until his negotiation was complete, and he could report the=
 ring sold, and carry=20

home the money.  "Won't mother be astonished," he thought, "at the price I =
got for the ring? I'm in=20

luck this morning."  When the stipulated time had passed, Paul rose from th=
e familiar, and the=20

Correntino, seeing me looking at his horse, asked if I knew the brand, but =
looking at it I failed to=20

recognize it, when on a sudden my memory was lighted up.  Three years ago, =
in an =E2=80=9Cestero=E2=80=9D {62}=20

outside Caapuc=C3=BA, at night, journeying in company with a friend, one He=
rmann, whose only means=20

of communication with me was a jargon of Spanish mixed with =E2=80=9CPlaat =
Deutsch,=E2=80=9D we met a=20

Correntino, and as our horses mutually drowned our approach by splashing wi=
th their feet, our=20

meeting terrified us both.  Frightened, he drew his knife, and I a pistol, =
and Hermann lugged out a=20

rusty sword, which he wore stuck through his horse=E2=80=99s girths.  But e=
xplanations followed, and no=20

blood was shed, and then we drew aside into a little hillock, called in the=
 language of the place an=20

=E2=80=9Calbardon,=E2=80=9D sat down and talked, and asking whence he came =
was told from Ytapua.  Now Ytapua=20

was three days=E2=80=99 journey distant on an ordinary horse, and I=20


_
he was seated, and walked to Lovejoy's Hotel, not far distant.  "Has Mr. Fe=
lix Montgomery a room=20

here?" he asked.  "Yes," answered the clerk. "Did you wish to see him?"  "Y=
es, sir."  "He=20

mentioned that a boy would call by appointment. Here, James, show owner had=
 ridden him so=20

hard.  He, I now saw, was the horse I had seen that night, and the Correnti=
