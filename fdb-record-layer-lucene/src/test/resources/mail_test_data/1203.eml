"And you mean it?"  "'Course. Want me to swear on a Bible or something?"  "=
No, Jack. We'll just=20

shake hands on that promise. The Cub handclasp, with two fingers extended. =
Here, I'll show you."=20

The Cub leader demonstrated the grip used by the other boys. Then he swung =
open the car door,=20

and motioned for Jack to step out. He made no further effort to hold the bo=
y.  Dan and the other=20

Cubs watched anxiously, fearful lest Jack make a bolt for freedom.  The boy=
 seemed to be=20

thinking of it, for he gazed up and down the nearly deserted street. Then, =
he drew a deep breath=20

and faced Mr. Hatfield.  "Come on," he growled. "Let's get it over with."  =
The two entered the Child=20

Study Institute together.  Mr. Hatfield was gone more than twenty minutes. =
Eagerly the Cubs=20

awaited his report.  "I had quite a talk with Guy Wentworth," he said. "At =
first he was inclined to=20

give the boy the works, but I convinced him otherwise."  "Will Jack be sent=
 to Mrs. Jones' place?"=20

Dan questioned.  "That's the plan, if she's still willing to take him. Mr. =
Wentworth has agreed Jack=20

may have this last chance to settle down and make good. If he runs away aga=
in, though, it means=20

the state reformatory for him."  "Do you think Mrs. Jones can handle him?" =
asked Burton Holloway=20

as he started the engine of the station wagon. "Jack needs a firm hand."  "=
She can manage him if=20

anyone can," Mr. Hatfield replied confidently. "Furthermore, she needs mone=
y. It will make an=20

ideal arrangement, providing Jack doesn't let us down."  Mr. Holloway dropp=
ed the boys off at their=20

various homes.  "I'll take you home next," he said to Mr. Hatfield, when al=
l of the passengers had=20

been disposed of except his own son Midge, and Dan.  "I can walk from Mr. H=
atfield's place," the=20

latter offered. "It's only a step."  As the station wagon pulled up in fron=
t of his home, Mr. Hatfield=20

noted at once that a black car with the numeral 145 stood at the curb.  "Th=
at looks like a police=20

car," Dan commented.  "Which means I'm in for another siege of questioning,=
" the Cub leader=20

sighed. With Dan, he alighted from the station wagon. "I'm trying to cooper=
ate, but I've already told=20

police everything I know about the money box."  "Well, good luck," Mr. Holl=
oway said cheerfully,=20

shifting gears. "Don't let it get you down."  The station wagon drove off d=
own the street. Dan=20

started to say goodbye to Mr. Hatfield. Before he could leave however, two =
police officers came=20

out of the house.  "I'm Captain Eggleston," one of the men introduced himse=
lf. He spoke directly to=20

the Cub leader. "You're Mr. Hatfield?"  "That's right."  "We'd like to talk=
 to you."  "I'll be glad to=20

answer your questions," Mr. Hatfield replied politely. "However, it seems p=
ointless to keep going=20

over the same ground. I've told everything I know about the missing money b=
ox."  "We still have a=20

few questions to ask," Captain Eggleston replied. "In fact, we have some ne=
w evidence."  "New=20

evidence?"  "May we talk to you inside the house?"  "Certainly," responded =
Mr. Hatfield, somewhat=20

puzzled by the serious attitude of the police.  As he started to accompany =
the two men, Dan=20

turned away.  "Aren't you the boy who found the box at the church?" Captain=
 Eggleston asked=20

him.  "Yes, sir."  "Then you may as well stick around," the captain advised=
. "We may have a few=20

questions to fire at you too!"                                    CHAPTER 1=
2                              A Pair of Legs=20

Feeling almost as if he were a suspect in a crime case, Dan followed Mr. Ha=
tfield and the two=20

police officers into the house.  Captain Eggleston began the interview by a=
sking routine questions=20

of both Dan and Mr. Hatfield. Then abruptly he announced that a check had b=
een made of the car=20

license number noted down by the Cubs on the night of the heavy rain storm.=
  "The automobile=20

belongs to Frank Jankowski, a salesman for the V. H. Everetts Hardware Co.,=
" he informed.  "Mr.=20

Jankowski!" Dan exclaimed.  "Obviously, the boys were mistaken in thinking =
that the car was=20

following us," Mr. Hatfield said. "Imagination plays strange tricks on the =
mind. I thought myself--at=20



least for a while--that we were being followed."  "You've given us several =
false steers in this=20

investigation," Captain Eggleston said rather severely. "What are you tryin=
g to hide?"  The=20

question irritated Mr. Hatfield. He tried not to show resentment and kept h=
is voice controlled as he=20

replied:  "Absolutely nothing."  "You say you placed the money box in the d=
rawer of your desk?"=20

"That is correct."  "You considered it a safe place?"  "Safe enough. If I h=
adn't, I'd have made other=20

beans and fat yellow cucumbers. There were no screens or window-blinds in t=
he house, and all=20

the doors and windows stood wide open, letting in flies and sunshine alike.=
  Peter put the melons=20

in a row on the oilcloth-covered table and stood over them, brandishing a b=
utcher knife. Before the=20

blade got fairly into them, they split of their own ripeness, with a delici=
ous sound. He gave us=20

knives, but no plates, and the top of the table was soon swimming with juic=
e and seeds. I had=20

never seen any one eat so many melons as Peter ate. He assured us that they=
 were good for one-

-better than medicine; in his country people lived on them at this time of =
year. He was very=20

hospitable and jolly. Once, while he was looking at Antonia, he sighed and =
told us that if he had=20

stayed at home in Russia perhaps by this time he would have had a pretty da=
ughter of his own to=20

cook and keep house for him. He said he had left his country because of a "=
great trouble."  When=20

we got up to go, Peter looked about in perplexity for something that would =
entertain us. He ran into=20

the storeroom and brought out a gaudily painted harmonica, sat down on a be=
nch, and spreading=20

his fat legs apart began to play like a whole band. The tunes were either v=
ery lively or very doleful,=20

and he sang words to some of them.  Before we left, Peter put ripe cucumber=
s into a sack for Mrs.=20

Shimerda and gave us a lard-pail full of milk to cook them in. I had never =
heard of cooking=20

cucumbers, but Antonia assured me they were very good. We had to walk the p=
ony all the way=20

home to keep from spilling the milk.     VI   ONE afternoon we were having =
our reading lesson on=20

the warm, grassy bank where the badger lived. It was a day of amber sunligh=
t, but there was a=20

shiver of coming winter in the air. I had seen ice on the little horse-pond=
 that morning, and as we=20

went through the garden we found the tall asparagus, with its red berries, =
lying on the ground, a=20

mass of slimy green.  Tony was barefooted, and she shivered in her cotton d=
ress and was=20

comfortable only when we were tucked down on the baked earth, in the full b=
laze of the sun. She=20

could talk to me about almost anything by this time. That afternoon she was=
 telling me how highly=20

esteemed our friend the badger was in her part of the world, and how men ke=
pt a special kind of=20

dog, with very short legs, to hunt him. Those dogs, she said, went down int=
o the hole after the=20

badger and killed him there in a terrific struggle underground; you could h=
ear the barks and yelps=20

outside. Then the dog dragged himself back, covered with bites and scratche=
s, to be rewarded=20

and petted by his master. She knew a dog who had a star on his collar for e=
very badger he had=20

killed.  The rabbits were unusually spry that afternoon. They kept starting=
 up all about us, and=20

dashing off down the draw as if they were playing a game of some kind. But =
the little buzzing=20

things that lived in the grass were all dead--all but one. While we were ly=
ing there against the=20

warm bank, a little insect of the palest, frailest green hopped painfully o=
ut of the buffalo grass and=20

tried to leap into a bunch of bluestem. He missed it, fell back, and sat wi=
th his head sunk between=20

his long legs, his antennae quivering, as if he were waiting for something =
to come and finish him.=20

Tony made a warm nest for him in her hands; talked to him gayly and indulge=
ntly in Bohemian.=20

Presently he began to sing for us--a thin, rusty little chirp. She held him=
 close to her ear and=20

laughed, but a moment afterward I saw there were tears in her eyes. She tol=
d me that in her=20



village at home there was an old beggar woman who went about selling herbs =
and roots she had=20

dug up in the forest. If you took her in and gave her a warm place by the f=
ire, she sang old songs=20

to the children in a cracked voice, like this. Old Hata, she was called, an=
d the children loved to see=20

her coming and saved their cakes and sweets for her.  When the bank on the =
other side of the=20

draw began to throw a narrow shelf of shadow, we knew we ought to be starti=
ng homeward; the=20

chill came on quickly when the sun got low, and Antonia's dress was thin. W=
hat were we to do with=20

the frail little creature we had lured back to life by false pretenses? I o=
ffered my pockets, but Tony=20

shook her head and carefully put the green insect in her hair, tying her bi=
g handkerchief down=20

loosely over her curls. I said I would go with her until we could see Squaw=
 Creek, and then turn=20

and run home. We drifted along lazily, very happy, through the magical ligh=
t of the late afternoon.=20

All those fall afternoons were the same, but I never=20


_
"Why did you delay in calling police?"  "We've gone over all that before," =
Mr. Hatfield said wearily.=20

"It was late, and frankly, I was tired. I didn't feel equal to a long haran=
gue with police until I was=20

more rested. So I waited until morning."  "The first discovery that the box=
 was gone was when=20

police arrived here?"  "That is correct."  "And to your knowledge, no one e=
ntered or left the house=20

in the far as we could see, the miles of copper-red grass were drenched in =
sunlight that was=20

stronger and fiercer than at any other time of the day. The blond cornfield=
s were red gold, the=20

haystacks turned rosy and threw long shadows. The whole prairie was like th=
e bush that burned=20

with fire and was not consumed. That hour always had the exultation of vict=
ory, of triumphant=20

ending, like a hero's death--heroes who=20


_
"My wife was here, of course. I don't recall anyone else, unless one of the=
 Cubs dropped in."  "No=20

woman?"  "Not so far as I know." Mr. Hatfield was amazed by the question. H=
e could tell that=20

Captain Eggleston was leading up to a climax, but what it was he could not =
guess.  The police=20

officer withdrew an ornamental button from his pocket. Carelessly, he dropp=
ed it on the table.  Dan=20

noticed that the button was an unusual one of black jet, cut in a diamond s=
hape.  "Ever see that=20

before?" Captain Eggleston asked.  "I don't think so," Mr. Hatfield replied=
, examining the button=20

minutely. "Why?"  "Your gloriously. It was a sudden transfiguration, a lift=
ing-up of day.  How many=20

an afternoon Antonia and I have trailed along the prairie under that magnif=
icence! And always two=20

long black shadows flitted before us or followed after, dark spots on the r=
uddy grass.  We had=20

been silent a long time, and the edge of the sun sank nearer and nearer the=
 prairie floor, when we=20

saw a figure moving on the edge of the upland, a gun over his shoulder. He =
was walking slowly,=20

dragging his feet along as if he had no purpose. We broke into a run to ove=
rtake him.  "My papa=20

sick all the time," Tony panted as we flew. "He=20
