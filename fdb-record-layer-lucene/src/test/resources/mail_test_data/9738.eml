Le Gentil says (Voyage, ii, p. 101) of the banishment of the Chinese from M=
anila in 1767 (at which=20

time he was residing there): "I did not know any Spaniard in Manila who did=
 not sincerely regret=20

the departure of the Chinese, and who did not frankly admit that the Philip=
pines would suffer for it,=20

because the Indians are not capable of replacing the Chinese.... The Parian=
 was a sort of market,=20

where could be found provision of everything necessary for living; and it i=
s not without reason that=20

the Spaniards regretted the loss of this laborious people."  [150] "This sp=
irit of greed compelled the=20

Chinese to abandon in their internal commerce the gold and silver coins whi=
ch were in general=20

use. The number of those who made counterfeit money, which was continually =
increasing,=20

permitted no other line of conduct; and money was no longer coined save in =
copper. This metal,=20

however, having become scarce, in consequence of events which history does =
not record, the=20

shells so well known under the name of 'cauris' [English, 'cowries'] were m=

which will take much longer to explore than the ranges; and, at the end of =
a week, we shall have=20

got our own affairs pretty straight, and will beat all the country at the b=

Macalister.  What do you think of that, mates?" he added, turning to the co=

was at this time most imperfectly known; for, lying to the extreme north of=
