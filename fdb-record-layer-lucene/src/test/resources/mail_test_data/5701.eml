 the fulfilment of duty and society, founded on what you call the principle=
 of dracaena marginata in great cities is too exhausting; but in my village=
 there should be air, streams, and beautiful trees, a picturesque scene, bu=

found some hours later.  "I interfered at this point and shipped the bear a=
way to a summer hotel,=20

where they wanted something to amuse the visitors.  She soon tired of the c=
ompany and escaped=20

to the wild.  "Now I am confident that our old Blackie and your bear are on=
e and the same, but the=20

matter is easily settled.  Our bear had lost a toe on her left hind leg, th=
e consequence of getting in=20

front of the mowing machine in the tall grass when she was small.  Please e=
xamine your specimen=20

in this particular and let me hear from you."   "The riddle is solved," exc=
laimed the husband=20

excitedly tossing the letter across the table to his wife.  "I noticed the =
missing toe when I removed=20

the skin.  It is a great relief to have the matter cleared up."     CHAPTER=
 IV  THE CUBHOOD OF=20

BLACK BRUIN  For several weeks the furry, fuzzy little bear in the box behi=
nd the kitchen stove=20

did little but drink milk and sleep.  If he did crawl out of his box on to =
the floor, it was simply to=20

investigate the surroundings, and he would go about the room, poking his no=
se into all the=20

corners, and sniffing suspiciously.  But by degrees as he grew stronger and=
 sturdier he evinced=20

much curiosity, playfulness and drollery, and to these characteristics woul=
d have truth is uttered, it=20

will, sooner or later, be recognized. It is only an affair of time. It is b=
etter that it should mature and=20

naturally germinate than be forced.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou would reduce us =
to lotus-eaters,=E2=80=9D exclaimed the=20

professor. =E2=80=9CAction is natural to man. And what, after all, are cons=
piracies and revolutions but great=20

principles in violent action?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think you must be an adm=
irer of repose,=E2=80=9D said Lothair to the lady, in=20

a low voice.  =E2=80=9CBecause I have seen something of action in my life;=
=E2=80=9D said the lady, =E2=80=9Cand it is an=20

experience of wasted energies and baffled thoughts.=E2=80=9D  When they ret=
urned to the saloon, the=20

colonel and the professor became interested in the constitution and discipl=
ine of the American=20

universities. Lothair hung about the lady, who was examining some views of =
Oxford, and who was=20

ascertaining what she had seen and what she had omitted to visit. They were=
 thinking of returning=20

home on the morrow.  =E2=80=9CWithout seeing Blenheim?=E2=80=9D said Lothai=
r.  =E2=80=9CWithout seeing Blenheim,=E2=80=9D said=20

the lady; =E2=80=9CI confess to a pang; but I shall always associate with t=
hat name your great kindness to=20

us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut cannot we for once enter into a conspiracy toget=
her,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand join in a happy=20

plot and contrive to go? Besides, I could take you=20


_
humor which was quite ludicrous.  His first playfellow was the pillow which=
 he tumbled off the sofa=20

one day.  Having discovered that it was detachable, he always made for it a=
s soon as the spirit of=20

play seized him.  He would toss and tumble it about, now standing it upon e=
nd and batting it over=20

with his paw and then rolling it over and over on the floor.  The second ob=
ject in the room that=20

claimed his lasting attention was pussy, but she was much more animated tha=
n the sofa-pillow.=20

The first time that the fuzzy little cub went up and smelted of her, she ga=
ve him a savage cuff on=20

the nose, which sent him whining to his box, and he did not seek further ac=
quaintance with pussy=20

for several days.  He would stand and look at her for five minutes at a tim=
e.  This made the cat=20

very uneasy, and she would go about from place to place, trying to the priv=
ate gardens, for the=20

duke has given me a perpetual order, and they are really exquisite.=E2=80=
=9D  The lady seemed to smile.=20

=E2=80=9CTheodora,=E2=80=9D said the colonel, speaking from the end of the =
room, =E2=80=9Cwhat have you settled about=20

your train to-morrow?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe want to stay another day here,=
=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cand go to Blenheim.=E2=80=9D=20

CHAPTER 25 They were in the private gardens at Blenheim. The sun was brilli=
ant over the ornate=20

and yet picturesque scene.  =E2=80=9CBeautiful, is it not?=E2=80=9D exclaim=
ed Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYes, certainly beautiful,=E2=80=9D said=20

Theodora. =E2=80=9CBut, do you know, I do not feel altogether content in th=
ese fine gardens? The principle=20

of exclusion on which they are all founded is to me depressing. I require i=
n all things sympathy.=20

You would not agree with me in this. The manners of your country are founde=
d on exclusion.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CBut, surely, there are times=20


_
to get away from those small, bright, inquiring eyes.  At last the cub agai=
n got up courage to sniff=20

at the old cat, and this time she did not cuff him.  As long as he was resp=
ectful, she did not mind=20

him, but when he got too playful or subjected her to indignities, pussy ret=
aliated with that sharp=20

cuff on the nose, which always had the desired effect.  Black Bruin, or Whi=
ney, as he was=20

sometimes called when he was a small cub, alone.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWithout=
 doubt,=E2=80=9D said the lady; =E2=80=9Conly I do not=20

like artificial loneliness. Even your parks, which all the world praises, d=
o not quite satisfy me. I=20

prefer a forest where all may go=E2=80=94even the wild beasts.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CBut forests are not at command,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CSo you make a solitude and call it peace,=E2=80=9D said =
the lady, with a slight smile. =E2=80=9CFor my part,=20

my perfect life would be a large and beautiful village. I admire Nature, bu=
