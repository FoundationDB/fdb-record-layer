philodendron monstera  The Canadian ordnance stores have been given instruc=
tions that all equipments down to the last button must be ready by the 15th=
 of January. That date seems to be the favorite one. I believe it is the co=
mmencement of big things; a pots, mortars, pipes, axes, and the barbs of ar=
rows and pikes. Near the village they had a burial-ground, where many skele=
tons have been uncovered. A roll of human hair was lately found here, by Mr=

We began our instruction on the machine gun to the officers and the men who=
 are up here for a=20

special course; I have a boozy lieutenant, who doesn't care a hang, and a b=
right non-com. Some=20

of the officers we brought over make good mascots.                    -----=
--------------------------------  It=20

was fine to-day. We were even able to open up the tent flap to dry the plac=
e a bit. To-day the=20

major congratulated me on the Christmas card I designed for the unit.  Our =
classes of instruction=20

to the "alien" officers finish to-morrow. Both the men I was instructing pa=
ssed.  The adjutant is very=20

anxious to put us through our officers' training course quickly.  We are no=
w recognized as the=20

specialist corps in the machine-gun work with the Canadian Division, and he=
 is anxious that we=20

shall be ready to take commissions when casualties occur. Every battalion o=
f infantry has a=20

machine-gun section attached, and we have the job of training the officers =
and sergeants of these=20

sections.  Owing to the bombardment of the east coast, several of our batta=
lions are under orders=20

to move at a moment's notice. It is thought that the bombardment was simply=
 a ruse to draw the=20

British fleet away from around Heligoland.                    -------------=
------------------------  The=20

newspaper boys in Salisbury, when you refuse to buy an "Hextra," shout "Mon=
treal Star" and=20

"Calgary Eyeopener," and all the shopgirls and barmaids in Salisbury say, "=
Some kid," "Believe=20

muh," "Oh, Boy!"                    -------------------------------------  =
I had been granted Christmas leave at=20

the last minute, and as it was awkward to telegraph to Northwich, I arrived=
 after a long journey,=20

lasting sixteen hours, ten minutes ahead of the letter I'd sent saying I wa=
s coming. My arrival soon=20

spread over the town. A Canadian--this was a rather unique thing for Northw=
ich, a little Cheshire=20

town. Out of a population of about eighteen thousand, two thousand men have=
 joined the colors.=20

The men in uniform from the works are all receiving half pay. The other men=
 who are staying are=20

working twelve hours a day and give up part of their pay so that the jobs o=
f the soldiers will be=20

open when they come back. Thirty-five Belgian refugees are being kept here.=
 Money to keep them=20

for twelve months has been subscribed. One huge house has been taken over a=
s a hospital with=20

twenty-three nurses, all volunteers from Northwich. Everybody has done or i=
s doing something in=20

the great struggle. The young ladies in this neighborhood have no use for a=
 man who is not in=20

khaki, and with customary north of England frankness tell them so.  I expec=
t that you know that the=20

Government has sent around forms to every house asking the men who are goin=
g to volunteer to=20

sign, and men long past the military age have signed the papers, "too old f=
or the war service, but=20

willing to serve either at home or abroad voluntary for the period of the w=
ar." Others have offered=20

to do work to allow young men to go, to keep their jobs for them. This show=
s the spirit that=20

permeates England. There is only one end and that MUST be the crushing of t=
he Germans. I don't=20

believe people have any idea of the number of men who are at present under =
arms, and still the=20

posters everywhere say that we must have more men.  I included by the map, =

slate, as a prevailing rock, particularly in the northern part. Hornblende =
slate sometimes alternates=20

with this, and sienite appears in various places, though its strata are gen=
erally thin. Limestone also=20

occurs in Deerfield, Conway, Colrain, &c. of a dull brown colour. It contai=
ns so large a proportion=20

of silex that it is often but little removed from granular quartz. Lime for=
 building has sometimes=20

been obtained from it. A range of granite, containing veins of lead ore, ap=
pears at Southampton,=20

and proceeds to Hatfield. North of this, the other rocks cover it, and it d=
oes not again rise within=20

the limits of the map.  Sienite is the prevailing rock on the east side of =
Connecticut river in the=20

primitive region, more particularly in the southern part. In some places a =
narrow stratum of mica=20



slate lies next to the conglomerate of the secondary formation, and a low r=
ange of graphic and=20

common granite has been observed in Amherst and Leverett, lying next to the=
 mica slate. Other=20

veins of granite also traverse the sienite; and gneiss occurs in many place=
s. The proportion of=20

hornblende in the sienite is generally small, and mica is often present in =
considerable proportion.=20

Porphyritic sienite is common in this quarter, and steatite occurs in its e=
astern part.  Most of the=20

primitive region on the map is broken and mountainous, being made up of par=
allel ridges and=20

detached eminences. The strata run nearly north and south, and dip to the e=
ast at angles between=20

20=C2=B0 and 60=C2=B0. It would be easy to extend the map on the west to th=
e top of Hoosack mountain,=20

since the country is all primitive; and on the east the primitive continues=
, with a few exceptions, to=20

the ocean. The map might also be extended to the boundary of Connecticut, b=
y prolonging the=20

primitive ranges with some divergency, and colouring the intermediate space=
 secondary, except a=20

narrow tract on the east side of Connecticut river, which is alluvial. Thes=
e extensions were not=20

thought necessary.  In the town of Gill, at E, there is a cataract in Conne=
cticut river, from 30 to 40=20

feet in height; and it is believed that the alluvial region, and part of th=
e secondary shown on the=20

map from this fall to the place where the river passes between mount Holyok=
e and Tom, was=20

formerly the bed of a lake: for the logs are still found undecayed in many =
places, from 10 to 20 feet=20

below the surface; the river has evidently worn a passage between Holyoke a=
nd Tom: many of the=20

hills on the northern part, and the sandstone on the plain, bear the marks =
of having been washed=20

by water, and the channels of two rivers are still visible in Deerfield, th=
e one 30, and the other 100=20

feet above the present bed of Connecticut river. Between mount Tom and the =
mountains west,=20

there is a secondary plain of sufficient height to throw back the water ove=
r the supposed bed of the=20

lake, before a passage was worn between Holyoke and Tom. South of these hil=
ls commences=20

another alluvial and secondary tract, extending on both sides of the river =
to Haddam, in=20

Connecticut, where the river passes between mountains, and perhaps this reg=
ion also was the=20

bed of a lake.  The plain on which the village of Deerfield stands, with th=
e adjoining meadows, is=20

sunk 50 or 60 feet below=20

ven references to His All=20

Highest in letters are dangerous. As we are nearing the time when we shall =
go across I thought I=20

would mention it.  We expect to leave England somewhere around January 15th=
. We have been=20

living in the mud so long that we are getting quite web-footed.  This is a =
war Christmas. People are=20

too excited and anxious to celebrate it. I wonder what sort of a Christmas =
the next one will be!=20

What a terrible Christmas the Germans must have had in Germany. They admit =
over one million=20

casualties. Fancy a million in less than five months. During the Napoleonic=
 wars, which extended=20

over twenty years, six million died, and yet one side in this war already a=
dmits one tract, and was=20

undoubtedly the bed of a pond, or small lake, that remained after the large=
r one of which we have=20

spoken had subsided. When this larger lake decreased, Deerfield river was c=
ut off from a=20

communication with the Connecticut by the mountain CD, and the plain extend=
ing westward from=20

this mountain. There is a tradition, derived from the aboriginals of Deerfi=
eld, that the passage in=20

which Deerfield river now runs through the mountain CD, was begun by a squa=
w with a clam-shell.=20

On the margin of these meadows, at considerable elevation, numerous small c=
onical excavations=20

appear. On digging below the surface, stones are found calcined by fire. Th=
ese are probably the=20

spots where Indian wigwams formerly stood. Many vestiges of the aboriginals=
 are=20
