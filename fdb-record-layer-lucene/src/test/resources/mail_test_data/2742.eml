He was racing through his business that afternoon. It was also very odd tha=
t he neglected to cross=20

the cheque. That neglect arose through the same cause. Dare he venture to s=
ay, on his oath, with=20

all the consequences of perjury before his eyes, that he had not written "J=
no. Crapp" on that slip of=20

paper? Why not? Who should contradict him? Who could do so? Only Thinshanks=
. Was that=20

possible? Yes, he might from the dock contradict him, but his evidence coul=
d not be taken; and the=20

unlikeness of the signature was a further guarantee against harm to the pro=
secutor the church of=20

Chateau Neuf les Montiers, in France, lightning struck the building, killin=
g nine persons and=20

wounding eighty-two. In 1715 the lightning fell into the abbey of Noirmouti=
ers, near Tours, and=20

killed twenty-two horses, but did no further harm to the one hundred and fi=
fty monks at supper=20

than to turn over their one hundred and fifty bottles of wine. In 1855, lig=
htning struck a flock of=20

sheep in France, killing seventy-eight of them and two dogs, and sparing th=
e old shepherdess. A=20

French author relates the case of a priest who was killed by lightning,=20


_
Could he swear to the lie without blushing? He was afraid not. Yes, he coul=
d--he would. He=20

couldn't afford the loss of 50_l._ It was a heavy sum for him to lose. It w=
as a fleabite to Undertails.=20

They were rich beyond computation. He would venture to say it was not his s=
ignature, and risk=20

discovery. Nobody could give legal evidence to the contrary--that was very =
certain.  At the next=20

examination Mr. Snayke opened the case as one of forgery. The learned couns=
el argued that the=20

prisoner at the bar had doubtless seized an opportunity, when his master's =
back was turned, to=20

tear out a blank cheque from the book, had filled up the stump; he had fill=
ed up the body of the=20

cheque (which was not unusual), but he had also written his master's name u=
nderneath--a course=20

never allowed by Mr. Crapp, never before done by this young man, and which =
he had no authority=20

whatever for doing. Of course he had not crossed the cheque, which showed h=
is intention to=20

misapply the proceeds, so that he might get those proceeds to dissipate in =
that haunt of vice from=20

which he had been taken. It was (Mr. Snayke proceeded to say) an artful con=
trivance, and had so=20

well succeeded, that his master, guided by the stump-cheque, was really led=
, in the absence of=20

reflection, to suppose that he had, in the usual way, signed the draft itse=
lf with his own hand; but=20

on looking carefully at the signature he immediately saw that, although a c=
lever imitation of his=20

autograph, this "Jno. Crapp" had never been written by him. He (Mr. Snayke)=
 could very well=20

understand how even a bank-clerk might, without pausing to compare signatur=
es, honour the=20

forged draft; but the worthy magistrate, or any one, upon making the compar=
ison between the=20

several cheques he now offered for comparison with the one payable to Messr=
s. Clockwork, see=20

that it was not in the same handwriting as the others. His highly respectab=
le client would distinctly=20

swear that the signature was forged, and there could be no doubt about it. =
The case was now=20

complete, or would be when he had laid the evidence he had in court before =
his worship; and he=20

should ask for the prisoner's committal to the next sessions, to stand his =
trial on the charge he had=20

described.  The evidence sustained the learned gentleman's address. The pri=
soner, who was not=20

a little astonished at the extraordinary blunder of his master, as he thoug=
ht it, saw no object in=20

explaining how the case really stood. If he could get rid of the proof of t=
he one alleged forgery--that=20

of "Jno. Crapp"--he could not hope to grapple with the other charge. He saw=
 that the robbery of=20

the cheque and its proceeds could be proved. He did not know the object his=
 master had in=20

swearing that his own signature was not his handwriting, and if he had been=
 informed, the same=20

authority might have told him that his purpose would not have been very eff=
ectually served by=20

trying to expose the fraud and villany of his master.  What did happen in t=
he progress of this very=20

remarkable case, the reader will learn.  The prisoner's committal was repor=
ted in the newspapers.=20

His family, with whom he had not communicated, thus got to know of his situ=
ation. They=20

communicated with him. They employed an attorney for him, whose name I shal=
l call Shark.  Mr.=20

Shark, who is a notable man in the transpontine region of the metropolis, a=
nd looked upon as=20

almost a deity, at least in power or skill, by the criminal heathen "across=
 the border," had private=20

interviews with the culprit in his temporary gaol. Mr. Shark told his clien=
t to make a clean breast of=20

it with him--that he must know the whole truth, if he was to do him any goo=
d, &c.  The unhappy=20

client was as candid as the attorney could wish. He pleaded guilty at this =
investigation--not of=20

forgery, but of the other offence. He insisted that the "Jno. Crapp" had be=
en written by the hand of=20

his master, in a hurry, as described, and that the neglect to cross the che=
que had been the clerk's=20

temptation. He saw that by intercepting the course of the cheque from Crapp=
's to Clockwork's, and=20



that by presenting it at Messrs. while the horse on which he rode was unhur=
t, and quietly=20

continued homeward with the stiffened corpse. A somewhat similar case has c=
ome within the=20

knowledge of the writer: a man on horseback being killed, and the saddle pe=
rforated; yet the horse=20

remained apparently unhurt. I remember another instance of a man who was st=
ruck, and escaped=20

unharmed; but one of his boots was torn to shreds and some of the hobnails =
melted: and I myself=20

have been struck upon the foot, with no other result than a peculiar numbne=
ss, lasting nearly half=20

an hour.  In many instances a livid streak is the only mark left upon the d=
ead body; and again it=20

may be torn almost to atoms; while in some cases not the slightest trace is=
 perceptible. The=20

greater number fall in the first class. In 1838, some cattle were killed by=
 lightning near Nymnegen,=20

in Holland. Their bones were shattered to a thousand fragments, as though b=
y nitro-glycerine;=20

while externally there was no particular token visible. Some sheep killed i=
n Bohemia, in 1718, were=20

similarly served. The fragments of bone were driven so thoroughly throughou=
t the flesh that the=20

carcasses were unfit for food.  In 1869, the mayor of Pradette, France, was=
 killed by lightning, and=20

all his clothes, with the exception of one shoe, were torn from the body. =
=E2=80=9CAugust 11, 1855, a man=20

was struck by lightning on a road near Vallerois, and entirely divested of =
his raiment, only a few=20

remnants of which could afterwards be found. Ten minutes after the stroke h=
e was restored to=20

consciousness, complained of the cold, and asked how he came to be without =
any clothing. No=20

doubt, he would have more easily consoled himself for the loss of his appar=
el had he known of the=20

case reported by Sestier, of a man whose whole right side was burnt, as if =
he had been held for=20

some time over a fire-pan, while his shirt, his drawers and the rest of his=
 dress bore no marks=20

whatever of combustion.=E2=80=9D Sometimes the clothing is found unstitched=
; again, it is burnt, and again,=20

in some mysterious manner, seems to be annihilated.  Prof. Tyndall relates =
his sensations upon=20

having a powerful electric discharge pass through him: =E2=80=9CLife was ab=
solutely blotted out for a very=20

sensible interval, without a trace of pain. In a second or so consciousness=
 returned. * * * The=20

_intellectual_ consciousness of my position was restored with singular rapi=
dity, but not so the=20

_optical_ consciousness. * * * The appearance which my body presented to my=
self was that of a=20

number of separate pieces. The arms, for example, were detached from the tr=
unk and suspended=20

in the air. In fact, memory and the power of reasoning appeared to be compl=
ete long before the=20

optic nerve was restored to healthy action. But what I wish chiefly to dwel=
l upon here, is the=20

absolute painlessness of the shock; and there can not be a doubt that to a =
person struck dead by=20

lightning the passage from life to death occurs without consciousness being=
 in the least degree=20

implicated. It is an abrupt stoppage of sensation, unaccompanied by a pang.=
=E2=80=9D  There is another=20

class of peculiar freaks performed by this subtle force, which the followin=
g instances illustrate.=20

Prof. Perty tells of a thunder storm in Switzerland, when =E2=80=9Cthe ligh=
tning sprang from a pear tree=20

upon the verandah of a house, where it killed a boy and wounded his mother.=
 The pear tree and=20

the house were burned down. On the arm of the wounded woman a remarkably el=
egant=20

impression of twigs and leaves, like a photographic copy of part of the pea=
r tree, was found.=E2=80=9D=20

There are several cases noted of persons sitting near windows when lightnin=
g flashing near by=20

has produced an exact likeness of the person, as though engraved on the gla=
ss.  =E2=80=9CIn 1825 the=20

lightning fell upon the brigantine _El Buon Servo_, which lay at anchor in =
the bay of Armiro, at the=20

mouth of the Adriatic Sea. The superstitious Ionian sailors generally faste=
n a horseshoe to the=20

foremasts of their ships, probably fancying that this simple means affords =
them protection against=20



the evil intentions of wizards and witches. Of course, the _Buon Servo_ was=
 not without=20


_
50_l._ 4_s._ 1-1/2_d._ Under an evil impulse he determined to do so, and wa=
s foolish and guilty=20

enough to obey that impulse.  The wretched young man declared that he had n=
ever before been=20

guilty of a dishonest act. This was, he solemnly protested, his first offen=
ce. His whole career had=20

been blasted by yielding to the one temptation. He also poured into the ind=
ifferent ear of his legal=20

adviser the story of his wretchedness from the moment when he clutched his =
ill-gotten money. He=20

had, he said, endured an agony of remorse. In wild excitement he had afterw=
ards, until his arrest,=20

obtained his only relief from the pangs of conscience. Several times he had=
 resolved to throw=20

himself upon the mercy of his late employer; but the savage sternness of th=
at gentleman's=20

character made him tremble on the threshold of that good resolution.  Mr. S=
hark saw at once, and=20

almost admired, the ingenuity of the device adopted by the prosecution for =
throwing the loss of the=20

money upon the bankers. He did not think it necessary to enlighten his clie=
nt on this head, and=20

allowed him to indulge the belief that Mr. Crapp's evidence contained an in=
voluntary misstatement=20

of fact. He did not, he said to himself, think it any part of his duty to i=
nterfere between the=20

prosecutor and his bankers. The prisoner had scarcely any object to gain by=
 the denial of the=20

forgery; and he would assuredly get no one to believe him.  This criminal p=
ractitioner saw just one=20

use he could make of his client's frank instructions. The threat of an expl=
anation on the one hand,=20

and the promise of silence on the other, might get a strong recommendation =
to mercy from the=20

prosecutor.  Mr. Shark called upon Mr. Croak. What passed at the interview =
may be guessed at=20

through the result. When at the trial Mr. Snayke repeated the speech of whi=
ch I have given an=20

Antonio Teodoro, of Scarpanto, was sitting near the mast, when it was struc=
k by lightning. He was=20

killed at once. No marks of combustion were found on his body, nor were his=
 clothes torn; but on=20

his back was found the distinct impression of a horseshoe of the same size =
as that which was=20

nailed to the mast.=E2=80=9D  In the records of the Academy of Sciences, we=
 find that =E2=80=9Cthe Signora Morosa,=20

a lady of Lugano, who sat near a window during a thunder storm, received a =
shock which did her=20

no further injury; but a flower which stood in the passage of the electric =
fluid was distinctly pictured=20

on her thigh.=E2=80=9D She carried the mark to her grave.  Lightning is one=
 of the most useful purifiers of=20

the atmosphere. There can be no doubt that large quantities of noxious exha=
lations are destroyed=20

by electrical discharges. Its beneficial effects in this respect have been =
long noted. =E2=80=9CBoth=20

Hippocrates and Galenus remark that the water which falls during a thunder =
storm is more healthy=20

to drink than that which proceeds from a uniformly clouded sky: and Plutarc=
h mentions that the=20

rain from a thunder cloud is considered as more favorable to vegetation, an=
d communicates to=20

plants a particular flavor.=E2=80=9D There are also on record a number of i=
nstances in which persons long in=20

poor health, on receiving light shocks, have greatly improved in health and=
 appearance. Similar=20

results have been noticed in plant life. Doubtless such cases as these gave=
 rise to the belief of the=20

ancients, that to be struck by lightning was to be favored by the gods.  Th=
is opinion was especially=20

noted in the case of Mithridates. Slightly wounded in the forehead by light=
ning when a child, he=20

escaped unhurt later in life, when his sword was totally destroyed. These f=
acts caused him to be=20

held in superstitious fear by the Romans. And Quintus Julius Eburnus became=
=20


_
who had been convinced that this was the prisoner's first crime, and was an=
xious that he should=20

have an opportunity of recovering his lost character, instructed his counse=
l to recommend him to=20

the merciful consideration of the court.  The facts were proved, favor. Tho=
se who were killed by a=20

flash were believed to be not subject to decay, and were robed in white and=
 buried where they fell.=20

So also those whose tombs lightning struck were peculiarly honored of Heave=
n. Lord Byron=20

alludes to this in his stanza upon=20


_
The jury found the prisoner guilty. The judge, after giving, as he said, fu=
ll effect to the generous=20

recommendation of the prosecutor, sentenced the culprit to four years' pena=
l servitude.  The=20

bankers allowed Mr. Crapp the amount of the stolen cheque, which had been d=
eclared a forgery=20

by the deliberate judgment of a criminal court.         *       *       *  =
