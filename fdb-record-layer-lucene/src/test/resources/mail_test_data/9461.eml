rightly divined the dangers to dogmatic faith arising from self-abandonment=

emotion; it seemed to him another form of the individualism which he condem=

was a great objective reality; it had laid down a system of belief. A love =
of God which ignored the=20

method of God, was but a spurious love, leading to destruction.  [Footnote =
