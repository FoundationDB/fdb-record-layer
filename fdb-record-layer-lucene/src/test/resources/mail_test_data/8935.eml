"Who Me? Yes You. Beat It!"]      "CRUMPS"   _The Plain Story of a Canadian who went_  The 

Laurentian Mountains in the Province of Quebec are noted for their beauty, fine hunting and 

fishing, and are the stamping-grounds for many artists from the States and Eastern Canada. It was 

in this capacity that I was working during the hot summer of 1914. All through June and July I 

sketched with my father. Other than black flies my only worry was the price of my tubes of color. 

We usually received our newspapers two or three days after publication; consequently we were 

poorly posted on worldly happenings. Suddenly the war clouds gathered and almost before we 

knew it they became so threatening that we grew restless, and even went in to the depot to get our 

papers so that we could have the news sooner.  The assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince 

and the subsequent events were exciting, but it was only when Russia sent that one word 

"Mobilize" to Serbia that we suspected serious results. Even the summer visitors from the States 

exhibited signs of excitement, yet they were skeptical of the chances of war; that is, war that would 

really affect us! My newspaper in Montreal wired for me to a great part of the power. If also left 

exposed, attractions of moisture would take place from the atmosphere, the gunpowder would 

remain surcharged with humidity as before, and the lime would be only an inert mass.  The 

examination of this subject led me to consider the increase of the power of gunpowder in various 

situations, and of its use in the field. It is well known that after a few discharges a cannon becomes 

heated, and the range is much greater, as well as the recoil. The charge of powder is therefore 

reduced about one quarter, to produce the original effect. As I have not heard or seen any 

explanation of this fact I shall take this opportunity of mentioning, that it appears to arise from the 

same cause as the first explained, viz. the desiccation of the powder. No person will dispute the 

heat acquired by a cannon, or even a musket, after repeated discharges; and this heat must 

volatilize or destroy a great portion of the moisture combined with the powder, assist its speedy 

inflammation, and perhaps add to its power, by causing a more perfect combustion of the 

inflammable parts of the gunpowder. This would cause a much greater volume of gas to be 

produced, and the high temperature would also greatly augment its elasticity; and it is well known 

that the effects of gunpowder depend upon the rapid production and high degree of elasticity of a 

great quantity of aeriform fluids or gases.     ART. XX. _On The Connexion between Magnetism 

and Light._ By Col. GIBBS.  _Extract from a Letter to the Editor._   I visited, the last year, the mine 

of magnetic iron at Succassunny, belonging to Governor Dickerson of New-Jersey. The mine had 

not been worked for a year past, and I did not descend it. The proprietor, a gentleman of 

distinguished science, informed me of a singular circumstance attending it, which was too 

important to be left unnoticed. The mine is worked at the depth of 100 feet; direction of the bed, 



northeast and southwest; inclination nearly perpendicular. The ore in the upper part of the bed is 

magnetic, and has polarity; but that raised 


_
and hiked to the depot.  The Montreal train was crowded and conversation centered on the one 

topic, War; the English Navy's ability to maintain her rule of the seas, and what would Canada do. 

A young Austrian reservist two seats away was telling some people in a loud voice how much he 

wanted to get into it. He was going back to answer the call. And I had already begun to hear my 

country's call.  A newsboy boarding the train at a junction was overwhelmed and succeeded in 

getting twenty-five cents a copy for his papers.  Montreal teemed with suppressed anxiety and 

every hour fresh news was posted. Special bulletin boards were put up on store fronts. Already 

men in uniform were seen in the street. And men were trying to at first, but acquires it after it has 

been some time exposed to the influence of the atmosphere. This fact, of which there is no doubt, 

struck me as most singular. I could not recollect any similar observation; and it is only lately that I 

have found that Werner had observed, that iron sand, raised from the depth of 100 feet, had no 

magnetism. See Rees's Cyclopedia, Art. Sand.  I could only account for this circumstance by 

supposing that magnetism existed not in the interior of the earth, as was supposed, but only on the 

surface, and in such bodies as received this principle from atmospheric, or celestial influence.  The 

late discovery of the magnetic influence of the violet rays of light, by M. Morechini, a notice of 


_
The war fever was rising steadily; the chief occupation of Canadians in those days was watching 

the bulletin boards. Rumors of sea fights, ultimatums, disasters, and victories were common. The 

Kaiser seemed to declare war on the world at the rate of three countries a day.  On the night of 

August 4th, as I was putting the finishing touches on a cartoon, a friend burst into the room:--

"Come out of here! Something must happen any minute now." We marched downtown,--

everybody marched in those days; walking was abolished in its favor. One met demonstrations 

everywhere, large crowds of cheering men with flags, victrolas at shop windows played patriotic 

airs, and soldiers with civilians crowded before the bulletin boards singing the national anthems 

with great enthusiasm. The King had declared war and his message to the fleet had just been put 

up! Newspaper extras were given away by thousands and movies of the British Navy were shown 

on the street. Any one who thought the British could not enthuse, changed his mind then.  The 

audiences at the theatres and moving picture houses on receipt of the news rose simultaneously 

and sang the national anthems, then cheered themselves hoarse. These were the first days of the 

war. Several battalions of militia were called out and posted to protect the bridges and grain 

elevators. Battalions were raised overnight, and so many recruits came forward that men were 

refused by the score. England was immediately offered ten battalions. Then an army division was 

possible. The Militia Department suddenly became a hive of industry. Men with all kinds of 

business capacity tendered their services gratis, and the Canadian war machine, without the 

experience of previous campaigns, took shape. They worked night and day bringing everlasting 

credit on themselves. Banks offered full pay to their employees in uniform, and this example was 

widely followed. The principle prompting this action being, "It's our country; if we can't fight 

ourselves, we will help others to fight for her."  Existent camp sites were inadequate, hence new 

ones were necessary. We had a few, but none were big enough. We bought Valcartier, one of the 

best sites in the world, which was equipped almost over-night with water service, electric light and 

drainage. The longest rifle range in the world with three and one-half miles of butts was 

constructed. Railroad sidings were put in and 35,000 troops from all over the Dominion poured into 

it. Think of it,--Canada with her population of seven and one-half millions offering 35,000 

volunteers the first few weeks, without calling out her militia. And even to-day the militia are yet to 

be called. Thus every Canadian who has served at the front has been a volunteer. England 

accepted an army division. Fifteen hundred qualified officers were told that they would have to 

stay and train men for the next contingent. But this was not fighting. They were dissatisfied. They 

resigned their commissions and went as privates. Uniforms, boots, rifles and equipment were 

found for everybody. Every man was trained as much as possible in the time allowed, and within 

six weeks of the declaration of war, guns, horses and 35,000 men were going forward to avenge 

Belgium.  With me the question of signing up was a big one. In the first place, I wanted to go; I 

wanted to go quickly. Several other fellows and myself had decided upon a certain battalion. But 

much to our disgust and regret we were informed that enlistments had stopped only a short us in 

the journals, connected with the above fact, leads me to believe that light is the great source of 

magnetism. A learned foreigner,[13] whose residence in this country has contributed much to its 

scientific improvement, has also informed me that other substances than metallic have been 

found, by compression, to be magnetic.  It is well known that the violet ray is the most refrangible, 

or has the most attraction to matter. But there are other rays, which Herschel, who some years 



since discovered them, calls invisible rays, which are still more refrangible, are next beyond the 

violet, when refracted, and partake of most of its properties, except that they are invisible. I have 

not yet seen any account of the experiments of M. Morechini, other than the notice in the journal; 

but I trust I shall soon be able to determine whether those invisible rays do not possess the 

magnetic power as well as the violet; or, perhaps, possess it exclusively.  As the refraction of the 

atmosphere in the polar circles, is at least ten times greater than in the tropics, a greater quantity 

of the magnetic rays will there be separated and combined than elsewhere; and of course arises 

excess of magnetism. Hence the direction of magnetic bodies towards the northern and southern 

extreme regions. The great absorption and emission of light in the polar regions, by the ice and 

snow, may cause the extraordinary illumination of that country during the absence of the sun, and 

the emission of the magnetic rays with electricity may, perhaps, give us the aurora borealis.  The 

coincidence of the diurnal variation of the compass with the solar influence, deserves particular 

notice, and will have considerable weight on this subject.  That there are many facts which cannot 

readily be explained by the theory of light, I shall not deny; but in the infancy of this system we 

may be allowed to hope that future observations may enable us to remove present difficulties. One 

thing must be admitted, that no theory has heretofore been published relating to magnetism, which 

has received or seems entitled to much confidence. In your next number I hope to be able to 

furnish you with further remarks on this subject; but, I have no doubt that philosophy will finally 

determine that we owe to the solar ray light, heat, electricity, and magnetism.    G. GIBBS. 

_Sunswick, January, 1818._     ART. XXI. _On a new Means of producing Heat and Light, with an 

Engraving, by J. L. Sullivan, Esq. of Boston._     BOSTON, May 7, 1818.    _To Professor 

Silliman._    SIR,  If the following account of a method of using tar and steam as fuel, recently 

invented by Mr. Samuel Morey, should be found sufficiently interesting to occupy a place in the 

Journal of Science, I am sensible its usefulness will be much extended through that medium of 

information.  The inventor, not unskilled in chemistry, and aware of the attraction of oxygen for 

carbon, conceived it practicable to convert the constituents of water into fuel, by means of this 

affinity.  Whatever may be the fact, chemically considered, the operation, in various experiments, 

promises to afford a convenient method of applying to use several of the most combustible 

substances, not hitherto employed as fuel. By the process I shall briefly describe, _all 

carbonaceous fluids_ may be conveniently burnt, and derive great force from their combination 

with the oxygen and hydrogen gases of water or steam, before or at the moment of ignition.

of the First Auto Machine Gun Brigade, the generous gift of several of Canada's most prominent 

citizens, and it was in this unit that I enlisted with my friend Pat, a six-foot, husky Scotchman, with 

the fighting blood of the kilties very near the surface. We were immediately transported to Ottawa 

in company with fifty other picked men from Montreal. At Ottawa the complement of our battery 

was completed upon the arrival of one hundred more men from Ottawa and Toronto. Here we 

trained until it came time for us to move to Montreal, and there the battery was embarked on board 

the Corinthian with a unit of heavy artillery. We sailed down to Quebec where we joined the other 

ships assembled to take over the First Canadian Contingent.       _Corinthian, Wednesday, Sept. 

30th, 1914._      MY DEAR MOTHER AND FATHER:--      We are now steaming down the St. 

Lawrence. No one knows where we     are going.      Our fleet is a wonderful sight. All the ships 

are painted war     gray--sides, boats and funnels. We are expecting to pick up the     warships 

which are to convoy us across at Father Point, somewhere     near where the Empress of Ireland 

was sunk.      Quebec looked very fine. The big guns were being hoisted into     boats, horses 

embarking, and battalion after battalion arriving     and going aboard.  Fig. 1.  Fig. 2.]  A tight 

vessel, cylindrically shaped, was first employed, containing rosin, connected with a small boiler by 

a pipe which entered near the bottom, and extended nearly its length, having small apertures, over 

which were two inverted gutters, inclining or sloping upwards over each other; the upper one 

longer than the other, intended to detain the steam in the rosin, in its way to the surface. The rosin 

being heated, _carburetted hydrogen gas_ would issue from the outlet, or pipe, inserted near the 

top of the vessel, and being ignited, afforded a small blaze, about as large as that of a candle; but, 

when the steam was allowed to flow, this blaze would instantly shoot out many hundred times its 

former bulk, to the distance of two or three feet.  It is presumed the steam was decomposed, and 

carburetted hydrogen and carbonic oxide, or carbonic acid, produced as the steam passed, very 

near the hot bottom of the vessel.  Another apparatus was constructed, consisting of two vessels, 

one within the other, having a cover common to both; the inner one to contain _tar_, (as a more 

convenient substance than rosin;) the outer vessel to contain water, which surrounds the other, 

and lies under its bottom; or, in other words, a vessel of tar set into a vessel of boiling water. The 

boiler has a lining of sheet copper, or tin, to promote the ebullition. The tar vessel being riveted to 

the cover, holes are made through its sides, near to the cover, to allow the steam to pass in, and 

act on its surface. The cover being secured on, a safety valve is provided for the steam vessel, 

and two cocks; one over the tar, the other over the water, are fixed contiguously; the first has a 

tube, or is elongated to 


_
time. They actually look as if they had come through a campaign.     It gave me thrills all day to 

see these fine men come through the     dock-gates with a steady swing. It is a magnificent 

contribution     to any army. It's good to think of all these men coming at their     country's call. 

Some day, if I get back, I want to paint a picture of the fleet     assembled at Quebec. The grays 

and greens looked really beautiful.     Quebec, the city of history and the scene of many big 

battles,     views with disdain the Canadian patriotism in the present crisis,     and we had no send-

off, no flags and no nearly to the bottom of the tar, which ascends, and is driven out by the 

pressure of the steam on its surface. Both cocks conduct to a pipe, wherein is placed a large wire, 

or metallic rod, which about fills the tube, and is perforated obliquely, or zig zag, to increase the 

length of the passage, and to mingle the tar and steam more intimately. The gases, or vapours, 

issue from a small orifice at the end of the pipe; and, being ignited by a little fire, into which it is 

directed, an intense and voluminous blaze is produced, and continues as long as the materials 

remain unexhausted. A hot brick, instead of the

This letter will not be mailed for ten days, until we are well on     the way over. We are crowded, 

and if we are going through the     tropics we shall have a bad time; it is cold now, so we don't 

notice the congestion.      We had one hundred and forty horses aboard and two batteries of 

heavy artillery, besides our own armored cars. All the  This apparatus contained but about one 

quart of tar, (which must always be nicely strained,) and it lasted one and a half hour, and the 

flame was sufficient to fill a common fireplace, if not allowed to escape, by its violence, up the 

chimney. Its force will be according to the elasticity of the steam. I regret being unable, since, to 

make more exact and
