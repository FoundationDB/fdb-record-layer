contemptuously. "I wouldn't be as mean as you for all the gold in the Black Hills country, say 

nothin' about that in California and Colorado."  He turned his horse's head toward the north, and 

rode away, followed, to the wonder of all, by the "General."  "Ha! ha!" laughed Charity Joe, grimly, 

"I wish you success."  "You needn't; I do not want any of your wishes. I'm going to search for the 

person who makes them cries, an' ef you don't want to wait, why go to the deuce with your old 

train!"  "There ye err," shouted the guide: "I'm goin' ter Deadwood, instead uv ter the deuce." 

"_Maybe_ you will go to Deadwood, and then, again, maybe ye won't," answered back Fearless 

Frank.  "More or less!" chimed in the struggle for self-education?  Not simple autographs--they 

were meaningless; but actual letters which might tell him something useful. It never occurred to 

the boy that these men might not answer him.  So he took his _Encyclopaedia_--its 

trustworthiness now established in his mind by General Garfield's letter---and began to study the 

lives of successful men and women.  Then, with boyish frankness, he wrote on some mooted 

question in one famous person's life; he asked about the date of some important event in 

another's, not given in the _Encyclopaedia_; or he asked one man why he did this or why some 

other man did that.  Most interesting were, of course, the replies.  Thus General Grant sketched on 

an improvised map the exact spot where General Lee surrendered to him; Longfellow told him 

how he came to write

marched the train--steadily on over the level, sandy plain, and Fearless Frank and his strange 

companion turned their attention to the cries that had been the means of separating them from the 

train. They had ceased now, altogether, and the two men were at a loss what to do.  "Guv a 

whoop, like a Government Injun," suggested "General" Nix; "an' thet'll let ther critter know thet we 

be friends a-comin'. wrote out a stanza or two of "The Brook," upon condition that Edward would 

not again use the word "awful," which the poet said "is slang for 'very,'" and "I hate slang."  One 

day the boy received a letter from the Confederate general, Jubal A. Early, giving the real reason 

why he burned Chambersburg.  A friend visiting Edward's father, happening to see the letter, 

recognized in it a hitherto-missing bit of history, and suggested that it be published in the _New 

York Tribune_.  The letter
