"The man what I belonged to was name Mr. Sacks. My mother and father lived there. I was only 

about three years old when peace came, but I remember when the paddle rollers came there and 

whipped a man and woman.  "I was awful 'fraid, for that was somethin' I nevah see before. We 

"stayed on" but we left before I was old enough to work, but I did work in the fields in Mitchell 

County.  "I came to Miami and raised 5 children. I'm staying with my daughter, but I'm not able to 

work much. I'm too done played out with old age."   FRANK BATES:  Frank Bates, 367 N.W. 10th 

Street, Miami, Florida was born on Hugh Lee Bates' farm in Alabama in the country not very far 

from Mulberry Beat.  "My mother and steadiness. The Piedmontese were very good hands 

especially for cutting rock and at the same time well conducted, sober and saving. The 

Neapolitans would not take any heavy work, but they seem to have been temperate and thrifty. 

The men from Lucca ranked midway between the Piedmontese and the Neapolitans. The 

Germans proved less enduring than the French; those employed, however, were mostly 

Bavarians. The Belgians were good labourers. In the mode of working, the foreign labourers had 

of course much to learn from the English, whose experience in railway- making had taught them 

the most compendious processes for moving earth.  Mr. Hawkshaw, the engineer, however says,

to do more than tote water to the servants in the fields.  "I saw Old Bates whip my mother once for 

leaving her finger print in the pone bread when she patted it down before she put it into the oven. 

"I remember seeing Lundra, Oscar and Luke Bates go off to war on three fine horses. I dont know 

whether they ever came back or not, for we moved that same day."   WILLIAM NEIGHTEN: 

William Neighten gave his address as 60th Street, Liberty City. He was only a baby when freedom 

came, but he too, "stayed on" a long time afterward.  He did not know his real unskilled labour in 

different countries: "I have come to the conclusion that its cost is much the same in all. I have had 

personal experience in South America, in Russia, and in Holland, as well as in my own country, 

and, as consulting engineer to some of the Indian and other foreign railways. I am pretty well 

acquainted with the value of Hindoo and other labour; and though an English labourer will do a 

larger amount of work than a Creole or a Hindoo, yet you have to pay them proportionately higher 

wages. Dutch labourers are, I think, as good as English,

"Don't ask me how much work I had to do. Gracious! I used to plow and hoed a lot and everything 

else and then did'nt do enough. I got too many whippings besides."   RIVIANA BOYNTON: 

Rivana Williams Boynton [TR: as in earlier interview, but Riviana, above] was born on John and 

Mollie Hoover's plantation near nearly so; and Russian workmen are docile and easily taught, and 

readily adopt every method shown to them to be better than their own."  The "navvies," though 

rough, seem not to have been unmanageable. There are no trades' unions among them, and they 

seldom strike. Brandy being cheap in France, they were given to

S.C., being 15 years of age when the 'Mancipation came.  "Our Boss man, he had "planty" of 

slaves. We lived in a log houses. My father was an Indian and he ran away to war, but I don't 

'member anything of my mother. She was sold and taken away 'fore I ever knew anything of her. 

"I 'member that I had to thin cotton in the fields and mind the flies in the house. I had a leafy 

branch that was cut from a tree. I'd stand and wave that branch over the table to keep the flies out 

of the food.  "I'd work like that in the day time and at night I'd sleep in my uncle's shed. We had 

long bunks along the side of the walls. We had no beds, just gunny sacks nailed to habit: but their 

good nature, and the freedom with which they spent their money, made them popular, and even 

the _gendarmes_ soon found out the best way of managing them. They sometimes, but not 

generally, got unruly on pay day. They came to their foreign work without wife or family. The 

unmarried often took foreign wives. It is pleasant to hear that those who had wives and families in 

England sent home money periodically to them; and that they all sent money often to their parents. 

They sturdily kept their English habits and their English dress, with the high-low boots laced up, if 

they could possibly get them made.  The multiplicity of schemes now
