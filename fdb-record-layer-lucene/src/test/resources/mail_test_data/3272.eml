dracaena marginata knew he would not. Cowards took the suicide way out, the=
 final yielding to unjust, cruel mastery by the Martians. Parr stiffened hi=
s shoulders, that had grown tanned and vigorous in the healthy air. He spok=
e grimly to Sadau:  "I don't accept all this yet. It's happened to others, =
but not to entire ruin. I will not help you, I would rather see him die in =
his trance and go into God's hands than awake him and see him go into hell'=

DDY]. You should have knowledge, Biddy Lally, of the means to bring back a =
man _
rest to live peaceably together, helping each other."  Parr only half heard=
 him. "Evolution turned=20

backward--it can't be true. It's against nature."  "Martians war against na=
ture," replied Sadau=20

pithily. "Mars is a dead world, and its people are devils. They'd be the lo=
gical explorers to find a=20

place where such things can be, and to make use of it. Don't believe me if =
you don't want to. Time=20

and life here will convince you."         *       *       *       *       *=
  In the days that followed--the asteroid=20

turned once in approximately twenty-two hours--Parr was driven to belief. P=
erhaps the slowness of=20

the idea's dawning kept him from some form of insanity.  Every man of the l=
ittle group that called=20

him chief  FATHER JOHN. Maybe to-day, maybe to-morrow; it is hard to be cer=
tain.  BIDDY. If it is=20

_away_ he is, he might be away seven years. To be lying like a stump of a t=
ree and using no food=20

and the world not able to knock a word out of him, I know the signs of it w=
ell.  JOHNNY B. We=20

cannot be waiting and watching through seven years. If the business he has =
started is to be done,=20

we have to go on here and now. The time there is any delay, that is the tim=
e the Government will=20

get information. Waken him now, Father, and you'll get the blessing of the =
generations.  FATHER=20

JOHN. I will not bring him back. God will bring him back in His own good ti=
me. For all I know he=20

may be seeing the hidden things of God.  JOHNNY B. He=20


_
a man no more. There were stooped backs among them, a forward hang to arms,=
 a sprouting of=20

coarse, lank hair. Foreheads fell away, noses flattened coarsely, eyes grew=
 small and shifty.=20

Sadau informed Parr that such evidences of degeneration meant a residence o=
f a year or so on=20

the exile asteroid.  "We'll be driving one or two of them away pretty soon,=
" he observed.  "What=20

then?" asked Parr. "What happens to the ones that are driven out?"  "Someti=
mes we notice them,=20

peering through the brush, but mostly they haul out by themselves a little =
way from here--shaggy=20

brutes, like our earliest fathers. There are lower types still. They stay c=
ompletely clear of now.=20

ANDREW. Waken him, Father John. I thought he was surely dead this time; and=
 what way could I=20

go face Thomas through all that is left of my lifetime after me standing up=
 to face him the way I=20

did? And if I do take a little drop of an odd night, sure I'd be very lones=
ome if I did not take it. All=20

the world knows it's not for love of what I drink, but for love of the peop=
le that do be with me!=20

Waken him, Father, or maybe I would waken him myself. [_Shakes him._]  FATH=
ER JOHN. Lift=20

your hand from touching him. Leave him to himself and to the power of God. =
 JOHNNY B. If you=20

will not bring him back, why wouldn't we ourselves do it? Go on now, it is =
best=20

Parr asked the question that had haunted him since his first hour of exile:=
 "Sadau, do you see any=20

change in me?"  Sadau smiled and shook his head. "You won't alter in the le=
ast for a month."=20

That was reasonable. Man, Parr remembered, has been pretty much the same fo=
r the past ten=20

thousand years. If a year brought out the beast in the  FATHER JOHN. I woke=
 him yesterday. He=20

was angry with me; he could not get to the heart of the command.  JOHNNY B.=
 If he did not, he=20

got a command from myself that satisfied him, and a message.  FATHER JOHN. =
He did ... he took=20

it from you ... and how do I know what devil's message it may have been tha=
t brought him into that=20

devil's work,=20


_
years turned backward. Five years would be five hundred thousand of reverse=
 evolution--in that=20

time, one would be reduced to something definitely animal. Beyond that, one=
 would drop into the=20

category of tailed monkeys, of rodent crawlers--reptiles next, and then--  =
"I'll kill myself from=20

heaven! It was I awoke him; it was I kept him from hearing what was maybe a=
 divine message, a=20

voice of truth; and he heard you speak, and he believed the message was bro=
ught by you. You=20

have made use of your deceit and his mistaking ... you have left him withou=
t house or means to=20
