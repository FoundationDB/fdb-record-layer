 The concert in time ceased;=20

there was a stir in the room; the Rev. Dionysius Smylie moved about mysteri=
ously, and ultimately=20

seemed to make an obeisance before the bishop. It was time for prayers.  =
=E2=80=9CShall you go?=E2=80=9D said=20

Lord St. Aldegonde to Mrs. Campian, by whom he was sitting.  =E2=80=9CI lik=
e to pray alone,=E2=80=9D she=20

answered.  =E2=80=9CAs for that,=E2=80=9D said Aldegonde, =E2=80=9CI am not=
 clear we ought to pray at all, either in public or=20

private. It seems very arrogant in us to dictate to an all-wise Creator wha=
t we desire.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI believe in=20

the efficacy of prayer,=E2=80=9D said Theodora.  =E2=80=9CAnd I believe in =
you,=E2=80=9D said St. Aldegonde, after a=20

momentary pause.       CHAPTER 47 On the morrow, the early celebration in t=
he chapel was=20

numerously attended. The duchess and her daughters, Lady Agramont, and Mrs.=
 Ardenne, were=20

among the faithful; but what encouraged and gratified the bishop was, that =
the laymen, on whom=20

he less relied, were numerously represented. The lord-lieutenant, Lord Cari=
sbrooke, Lord=20

Montairy, Bertram, and Hugo Bohun accompanied Lothair to the altar.  After =
the celebration,=20

Lothair retired to his private apartments. It was arranged that he was to j=
oin his assembled friends=20

at noon, when he would receive their congratulations, and some deputations =
from the county.  At=20

noon, therefore, preparatively preceded by Mr. Putney Giles, whose thought =
was never asleep,=20

and whose eye was on every thing, the guardians, the cardinal, and the Earl=
 of Culloden, waited=20

on Lothair to accompany him to his assembled friends, and, as it were, laun=
ch him into the world.=20

They were assembled at one end of the chief gallery, and in a circle. Altho=
ugh the deputations=20

would have to advance the whole length of the chamber, Lothair and his guar=
dians entered from a=20

side apartment. Even with this assistance he felt very nervous. There was n=
o lack of feeling, and,=20

among many, of deep feeling, on this occasion, but there was an equal and a=
 genuine exhibition of=20

ceremony.  The lord-lieutenant was the first person who congratulated Lotha=
ir, though the high-

sheriff had pushed forward for that purpose, but, in his awkward precipitat=
ion, he got involved with=20

the train of the Hon. Lady Clotworthy, who bestowed on him such a withering=
 glance, that he felt a=20

routed man, and gave up the attempt. There were many kind and some earnest =
words. Even St.=20



Aldegonde acknowledged the genius of the occasion. He was grave, graceful, =
and dignified, and,=20

addressing Lothair by his title, he said, =E2=80=9Cthat he hoped he would m=
eet in life that happiness which=20

he felt confident he deserved.=E2=80=9D Theodora said nothing, though her l=
ips seemed once to move; but=20

she retained for a moment Lothair=E2=80=99s hand, and the expression of her=
 countenance touched his=20

innermost heart. Lady Corisande beamed with dazzling beauty. Her countenanc=
e was joyous,=20

radiant; her mien imperial and triumphant. She gave her hand with graceful =
alacrity to Lothair, and=20

said in a hushed tone, but every word of which reached his ear, =E2=80=9COn=
e of the happiest hours of my=20

life was eight o=E2=80=99clock this morning.=E2=80=9D  The lord-lieutenant =
and the county members then retired to=20

the other end of the gallery, and ushered in the deputation of the magistra=
cy of the county,=20

congratulating their new brother, for Lothair had just been appointed to th=
e bench, on his=20

secession to his estates. The lord-lieutenant himself read the address, to =
which Lothair replied=20

with a propriety all acknowledged. Then came the address of the mayor and c=
orporation of=20

Grandchester, of which city Lothair was hereditary high-steward; and then t=
hat of his tenantry,=20

which was cordial and characteristic. And here many were under the impressi=
on that this portion of=20

the proceedings would terminate; but it was not so. There had been some whi=
spering between the=20

bishop and the archdeacon, and the Rev. Dionysius Smylie had, after confere=
nce with his=20

superiors, twice left the chamber. It seems that the clergy had thought fit=
 to take this occasion of=20

congratulating Lothair on his great accession and the proportionate duties =
which it would fall on=20

him to fulfil. The bishop approached Lothair and addressed him in a whisper=
. Lothair seemed=20

surprised and a little agitated, but apparently bowed assent. Then the bish=
op and his staff=20

proceeded to the end of the gallery and introduced a diocesan deputation, c=
onsisting of=20

archdeacons and rural deans, who presented to Lothair a most uncompromising=
 address, and=20

begged his acceptance of a bible and prayer-book richly bound, and borne by=
 the Rev. Dionysius=20

Smylie on a cushion of velvet.  The habitual pallor of the cardinal=E2=80=
=99s countenance became=20

unusually wan; the cheek of Clare Arundel was a crimson flush; Monsignore C=
atesby bit his lip;=20

Theodora looked with curious seriousness, as if she were observing the mann=
ers of a foreign=20

country; St. Aldegonde snorted, and pushed his hand through his hair, which=
 had been arranged=20

in unusual order. The great body of those present, unaware that this deputa=
tion was unexpected,=20

were unmoved.  It was a trial for Lothair, and scarcely a fair one. He was =
not unequal to it, and=20

what he said was esteemed, at the moment, by all parties as satisfactory; t=
hough the archdeacon,=20

in secret conclave, afterward observed that he dwelt more on religion than =
on the Church, and=20

spoke of the Church of Christ and not of the Church of England. He thanked =
