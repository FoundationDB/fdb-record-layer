waging war against him."  "Many times," answered the Bishop, "almost every =

rule, was assigned in repartimiento to a Spaniard named Valenzuela, who beg=
an by robbing him=20

of a valuable mare and ended by taking from him his wife.  The cacique's pr=
otests were answered=20

with a beating, and his complaints to the governor of St. Juan de la Maguan=
a, one Pedro Vadillo,=20

were disregarded.  This grievance led to an organised rebellion of the nati=
ves under Enrique, who=20

assembled numerous forces.  By constantly moving from place to place, he wa=
s able to elude the=20

several Spanish expeditions sent against him. The course of these alternate=
 hostilities and=20

negotiations to obtain the submission of Enrique, and the dispersal of his =
people, are described at=20

length in chapters 125 and 126 of the _Historia General_.  Even the interve=
ntion of Fray Remigio,=20

one of the Franciscans who had come from Picardy to Hispaniola, and who had=
 been one of=20

Enrique's teachers in the convent, failed induce the offended cacique to su=
rrender. News of the=20

continued success of the rebellion reached Spain, and in 1527, Don Sebastia=
n de Fuenleal was=20

sent out as President of the Audiencia and Bishop of Santo Domingo, with sp=
ecial instructions to=20

subdue Enrique.  His efforts proved as fruitless as the preceding attempts,=
 and in 1528 the King=20

wrote still more urgently that the campaign must be brought to a successful=
 issue.  The Bishop-

President, being in sore perplexity to devise means for satisfying the roya=
l commands, showed=20

this embarrassing letter to Fray president.  =E2=80=9CDo you mean money? Th=

Caro. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll tell you what I think,=E2=80=9D she continued, =
shaking her finger at Walter, =E2=80=9CI think you are a=20

pa?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe has indeed, my=20

darling.=E2=80=9D  The young man=E2=80=99s face flushed. =E2=80=9CWhatever =
I have done has brought me the most=20

pleasure. I seem now not to mind as I did at first having to give everythin=
g up. I can even hear=20

Charlie talk about the university, without thinking of my spoiled plans. I =
only want now to get what I=20

can out of the present.=E2=80=9D Then after a moment=E2=80=99s silence, he =
said with a smile, =E2=80=9CI am not afraid of the=20

dark any more.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDid you try a candle?=E2=80=9D Caro asked=
.  =E2=80=9CYes;=E2=80=9D Walter answered, and Dr. Barrows=20

understood. On that young life with its dark shadow, the light of love had =
shone, and a little candle=20

had been the beginning of it.  So the Christmas party came to an end, and t=
he guests went happily=20

home through the snow.     CHAPTER XII  GOODBY   Trolley sat on the gate-po=
st. If possible he=20

was handsomer than ever, for the frosty weather had made his coat thick and=
 fluffy, besides this=20

he wore his new collar. His eyes were wide open to-day, and he looked out o=
n the world with a=20

solemn questioning gaze.  He had been decidedly upset in his mind that morn=
ing at finding an=20

open trunk in Caro=E2=80=99s room, and clothes scattered about on chairs an=
d on the bed. Of course he did=20

not know what this meant, but to the cat mind=20
