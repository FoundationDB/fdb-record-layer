Forty-eight in the total of seventy-three pages of print filled by this spe=
ech are taken up with a=20

defense of New England against the Southern charges of sectionalism and dis=
loyalty. Few=20

utterances of the time are more familiar than the sentences bringing this p=
art of the oration to a=20

close: "Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium of Massachusetts; she n=
eeds none. There she=20

is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is her history; the world k=
nows it by heart. . . .=20

There is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there the=
y will remain forever."=20

If this had been all, the speech would have been only a spirited defense of=
 the good name of a=20

section and would hardly have gained immortality. It was the Union, however=
, that most needed=20

defense; and for that service the orator reserved his grandest efforts.  Fr=
om the opening of the=20

discussion Webster's object had been to "force from Hayne or his supporters=
 a full, frank, clear-cut=20

statement of what nullification meant; and then, by opposing to this doctri=
ne the Constitution as he=20

understood it, to show its utter inadequacy and fallaciousness either as co=
nstitutional law or as a=20

practical working scheme."  In the Southerner's First Reply Webster found t=
he statement that he=20

wanted; he now proceeded to demolish it. Many pages of print would be requi=
red to reproduce,=20

even in substance, the arguments which he employed. Yet the fundamentals ar=
e so simple that=20

they can be stated in a dozen lines. Sovereignty, under our form of governm=
ent, resides in the=20

people of the United States. The exercise of the powers of sovereignty is e=
ntrusted by the people=20

partly to the National Government and partly to the state Governments. This=
 division of functions is=20

made in the federal Constitution. If differences arise, as they must, as to=
 the precise nature of the=20

division, the decision rests--not with the state legislatures, as Hayne had=
 said--but with the federal=20

courts, which were established in part for that very purpose. No State has =
a right to "nullify" a=20

federal law; if one State has this right, all must have it, and the result =
can only be conflicts that=20

would plunge the Government into chaos and the people ultimately into war. =
If the Constitution is=20

not what the people want, they can amend it; but as long as it stands, the =
Constitution and all=20

lawful government under it must be obeyed.   MacDonald, Jacksonian Democrac=
y, p. 98.  The=20

incomparably eloquent peroration penetrated to the heart of the whole matte=
r. The logic of=20

nullification was disunion. Fine theories might be spun and dazzling phrase=
s made to convince=20

men otherwise, but the hard fact would remain. Hayne, Calhoun, and their li=
ke were playing with=20

fire. Already they were boldly weighing "the chances of preserving liberty =
when the bonds that=20

unite us together shall be broken asunder"; already they were hanging over =
the precipice of=20

disunion, to see whether they could "fathom the depth of the abyss below." =
The last powerful=20

words of the speech were, therefore, a glorification of the Union:  While t=
he Union lasts, we have=20

high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and our c=
hildren. Beyond that I=20

seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that cu=
rtain may not rise. . . .=20

When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time as any prince of h=
is time. This habit of=20

extravagance made Otho an easy victim for the rapacious money-lenders; and =
when he was in the=20

hands of these Philistines the cautious King Philippe le Bel knew how to he=
lp him just enough to=20

keep him a grateful and obedient vassal of the crown. As early as 1291 was =
born Mahaut's first=20

child, a daughter named Jeanne, who was followed by a second daughter, Blan=
che (about 1295),=20

and then by two sons, Robert, and John, the latter dying while still in inf=
ancy. The ruinous=20

excesses of Count Otho had brought him to such a pass that, in 1291, Philip=
pe le Bel made a=20

most advantageous bargain with him: the infant daughter Jeanne, it was agre=
ed, was to marry the=20



eldest son of the king and thus bring Burgundy under the power of the crown=
; but it was stipulated=20

that, in the event of the birth of a son to Otho, Burgundy should revert to=
 this son and Jeanne=20

should marry the second son of the king. This, in fact, was what happened, =
for Otho had two sons.=20

Again, in 1295, when the count was in the hands of the usurers, Philippe le=
 Bel paid his debts, and=20

granted him a pension and a continuance of this or part of it to his childr=
en, in return for which=20

Burgundy was placed in the king's hands, together with the guardianship of =
the children until they=20

should reach the age of seventeen.  What the Countess Mahaut thought of the=
se arrangements,=20

so largely affecting the future of her children, we cannot tell, for we hav=
e little information in regard=20

to her life previous to the death of her husband. This event occurred in th=
e early part of 1303,=20

when Otho, like so many others of Mahaut's family, was killed in battle wit=
h the Flemings; and it=20

cannot be denied that his death was a gain rather than a misfortune for Mah=
aut and her children.=20

As a widow she enjoyed the right to special protection from the crown, with=
 which the relations of=20

her family and of her husband had been most intimate and fortunate; and as =
a widow she was free=20

to devote herself to the task of recouping the losses incurred through the =
bad management of her=20

domains by Otho. As the feudal ruler of Artois and Bourgogne she would have=
 much to occupy her=20

time, even if her affairs had been in the best order and she had been left =
to manage them in=20

peace; but this was not to be, for she had to contend for her rights during=
 the greater part of the=20

years that remained to her.  Before we enter upon her career as Countess of=
 Artois, let us=20

conclude a part of the more intimate life of Mahaut, a part full of shame a=
nd sorrow for the mother.=20

Her son, Robert, was the object of much solicitude on the part of Mahaut, w=
ho sought in every way=20

to give him an education not only suited for the high station in life he wo=
uld be called upon to=20

occupy, but calculated to make him a useful and a happy man. As early as 13=
04, when he could=20

have been no more than seven or eight years of age, Mahaut provided him wit=
h a separate=20

establishment, or _hotel_, under the government of two worthy gentlemen, Th=
ibaud de Mauregard=20

and Jean de Vellefaux. There was provided a little comrade for Robert, Guil=
laume de Vienne, his=20

playmate, who was treated with as much consideration and kindness as was Ro=
bert himself. Then=20

there was a retinue of some seven or eight servants, and two knights, old s=
ervants of Mahaut's=20

father, to assist in the military=20


_
Undaunted by the flood of eloquence that for four hours held the Senate spe=
llbound, Hayne=20

replied in a long speech that touched the zenith of his own masterful power=
s of argumentation. He=20

conceded nothing. Each State, he still maintained, is "an independent sover=
eignty"; the Union is=20

based upon a compact; and every party to the compact has a right to interpr=
et for itself the terms=20

of the agreement by which all gentlemen; and there was also a certain Henri=
 de Besson, the=20

pedagogue charged with the education of Robert. The child, of course, was n=
ot left solely to these=20

attendants by his mother, who passed a considerable part of the time with h=
im. Games and=20

fashionable amusements were not forbidden by the fond mother, and, as early=
 as 1308, we find=20

Robert losing his money in play at the court, and spending his gold on=20


_
Both sides were well satisfied with the presentation of their views. Certai=
nly neither was converted=20

to the position of the other. The debate served, however, to set before the=
 country with greater=20

clearness than ever before the two great systems of constitutional interpre=
tation that and tourneys=20

like other young gentlemen of the day.  In 1314 he was already able to wear=
 knightly panoply of=20

war, and in the following year he accompanied the royal army in an aimless =
expedition to=20

Flanders, while his mother stayed at home and had prayers recited for the s=
afety of her=20
