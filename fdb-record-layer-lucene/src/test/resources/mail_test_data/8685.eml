SECRET SERVICE  OR  Recollections of a City Detective     MY GREAT ELECTION=
EERING=20

TRICK.   About twelve years ago there was an election anticipated in the Bo=
rough of N----. It was a=20

notorious place for bribery, as I, who have been professionally concerned i=
n many elections,=20

perfectly well knew. It was an extraordinary town. It had once been a very =
flourishing place. A=20

staple trade had been carried on there, and almost nowhere else; but an evi=
l spirit of gentility=20

pervaded its corporation in those days.  The genius of two or three well-kn=
own men would have=20

taken advantage of the neutral position and prospects of that spot and its =
neighbourhood to found=20

there a new industry, and give employment to an immense population of skill=
ed artisans. The=20

labour of these people, however, could only be set to work and supplemented=
 by smoke. The=20

mayor and town-council of N----, acting in the supposed interest of its inh=
abitants, determined they=20

would have no smoky chimneys within their town. An Act of Parliament had be=
en obtained=20

sanctioning such municipal regulations as enabled these wiseacres to keep o=
ut the threatened=20

innovation of gold-producing smoke. The new industry had, therefore, to set=
tle down in the=20

neighbourhood beyond municipal control. After this achievement had been suc=
cessful, the=20

surrounding district went on rapidly increasing in prosperity until it reac=
hed its present exalted=20

position in that respect, and the trade of N---- went on diminishing to its=
 present abject or=20
