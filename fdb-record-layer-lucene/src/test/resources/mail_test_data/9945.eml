The very way the beast was lying, if ye can rightly remember, might be a help. You're not without sense, Rolls. I've always had a high opinion of your sense. Now here's a chance for you to _
the influence it will have on the national character in the eyes of foreigners, who will always judge 

us by our public men, and our public men by these calumnies. Besides, what do political 

distinctions promise a man in this country, supposing him to be successful, but the feverish life of 

an expectant until the office is gained; and then, though it may be the highest office in the state, to 

hold it but a few years, and be thrown back into society a common man, broken, perhaps, in health 

and fortune. Is there any thing here to induce one to give up his good name, his private history, 

and the feelings of his family and connections, to be the sport and prey of hireling incendiaries? 

Your Excellency, and the gentlemen associated with you in the government, will receive our 

respectful salutations. Entering, as you do this day, on a new political year, it is unnecessary for 

me, perhaps it would be accounted officiousness, to remind you of the expectations of your 

constituents. They point you to the example of your illustrious predecessors, to a Hancock, a 

Bowdoin, and the Adamses of other days; they refer you to the Constitution, that charter of our 

rights and liberties which must never be violated, or touched but with reverence; they appeal to 

your consciences, which are as the echo of the divine mind. They also put under your protection 

and patronage their literary, moral and religious institutions, with a solemn injunction that you 

should be happen to any man. We might any of us be the means of such an accident: but panic is 

just the worst policy. Panic looks like guilt. If he's been so far left to himself as to take fright--to see 

that big man on his big horse thunderin' over the Scaur would be enough to make any man lose 

his head," the agent added, with a sort of apology in his tone.  "If you could think of the young 

master as in that poseetion," said Rolls.  "Which is just impossible," Mr Monypenny said, and then 

there was a little pause. "The wisest thing," he went on, "would be, just as I say, a plain statement. 

Such and such a thing happened. I lost my head. I thought there was nothing to be done. I was 

foolish enough to shrink from the name of it, or from the coolness it would make between me and 

my friends. Ay, very likely that might be the cause--the coolness it would make between him and 

the family at Lindores----"  "You're meaning always if there was onything in it at a'?"  "That is what 

I'm meaning. I will go and see him at once," Mr Monypenny said, "and that is the advice I will give. 

A plain story whatever it may be--just the facts; neither extenuate nor set down aught in malice. 

And as for you, Rolls, that seem to be mixed up in it yourself----"  "Ay, sir; I'm mixed up in it," said 

Rolls, turning upon him an inquiring yet half-defiant glance.  "It was you that found the body first. It 

was you that met your master at the gate. You're the most important witness, so

evil, should prosperity ever make the people of this country blind or indifferent to the sources, 

whence that prosperity has been derived.  It is a melancholy reflection, that we can have no 

certainty of the continuance of any earthly blessing. Governments, even the best governments 

often contain in them the seeds of decay and death. It is by no means Lord bless us, man!" said 

Mr Monypenny, forgetting precaution, "had you not the judgment, when you saw the lad had been 

in a tuilzie, to get him out of other folk's sight, and keep it to yourself?"  "There was John Tamson 

as well as me," said Rolls, very gravely; and then he added, "but ye canna see yet, Mr 

Monypenny, how it may a' turn."  "I see plenty," said

republics, that have been. Let us then learn to put our trust in Him by whom nations rise and fall; 

and as we have no abiding city here, anxiously look for one hereafter which hath foundations, 

whose builder and maker is God.       End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Sermon Delivered 

before His Excellency Levi Lincoln, Governor, added, "the best thing you can do is to find out all 

you can about the ground, and other details. It was always unsafe; and there had been a great 

deal of rain. Very likely it was worse than ordinary that day. And call to mind any circumstances 

that might tell on our side. Ye had better come to me and make me acquainted with all
