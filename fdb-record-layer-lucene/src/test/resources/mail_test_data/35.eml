Philadelphia,[76] by_ ROBERT HARE, M. D. _Professor of Chemistry in the Med=
ical Department=20

of the University of Pennsylvania, and Member of several Learned Societies_=
.  (With an=20

Engraving.)   I have for some time been of opinion that the principle extri=
cated by the Voltaic pile is=20

a compound of caloric and electricity, both being original and collateral p=
roducts of Galvanic=20



action.  The grounds of this conviction and some recent experiments confirm=
ing it, are stated in=20

the following paper.  It is well known that heat is liberated by the Voltai=
c apparatus, in a manner=20

and degree which has not been imitated by means of mechanical electricity; =
and that the latter,=20

while it strikes at a greater distance, and pervades conductors with much g=
reater speed, can with=20

difficulty be made to effect the slightest decompositions. Wollaston, it is=
 true, decomposed water=20

by means of it; but the experiment was performed of necessity on a scale to=
o minute to permit of=20

his ascertaining, whether there were any divellent polar attractions exerci=
sed towards the atoms,=20

as in the case of the pile. The result was probably caused by mechanical co=
ncussion, or that=20

process by which the particles of matter are dispersed when a battery is di=
scharged through them.=20

The opinion of Dr. Thomson, that the fluid of the pile is in quantity great=
er, in intensity less, than=20

that evolved by the machine, is very inconsistent with the experiments of t=
he chemist above=20

mentioned, who, before he could effect the separation of the elements of wa=
ter by mechanical=20

electricity, was obliged to confine its emission to a point imperceptible t=
o the naked eye. If already=20

so highly intense, wherefore the necessity of a further concentration? Besi=
des, were the distinction=20

made by Dr. Thomson correct, the more concentrated fluid generated by a gal=
vanic apparatus of a=20

great many small pairs, ought most to resemble that of the ordinary electri=
city; but the opposite is=20

the case. The ignition produced by a few large Galvanic plates, where the i=
ntensity is of course=20

low, is a result most analogous to the chemical effects of a common electri=
cal battery. According=20

to my view, caloric and electricity may be distinguished by the following c=
haracteristics. The former=20

permeates all matter more or less, though with very different degrees of fa=
cility. It radiates through=20

air, with immeasurable celerity, and distributing itself in the interior of=
 bodies, communicates a=20

reciprocally repellent power to atoms, but not to masses. Electricity does =
not radiate in or through=20

any matter; and while it pervades some bodies, as metals, with almost infin=
ite velocity; by others, it=20

is so far from being conducted, that it can only pass through them by a fra=
cture or perforation.=20

Distributing itself over surfaces only, it causes repulsion between masses,=
 but not between the=20

particles of the same mass. The disposition of the last-mentioned principle=
 to get off by=20

neighbouring conductors, and of the other to combine with the adjoining mat=
ter, or to escape by=20

radiation, would prevent them from being collected at the positive pole, if=
 not in combination with=20

each other. Were it not for a modification of their properties, consequent =
to some such union, they=20

could not, in piles of thousands of pairs, be carried forward through the o=
pen air and moisture; the=20

one so well calculated to conduct away electricity, the other so favourable=
 to the radiation of=20

caloric.  Pure electricity does not expand the slips of gold-leaf, between =
which it causes repulsion,=20

nor does caloric cause any repulsion in the ignited masses which it expands=
. But as the compound=20

fluid extricated by Galvanic action, which I shall call electro-caloric, di=
stributes itself through the=20

interior of bodies, and is evidently productive of corpuscular repulsion, i=
t is in this respect more=20

allied to caloric than to electricity.  It is true, that when common electr=
icity causes the deflagration=20

of metals, as by the discharge of a Leyden jar, it must be supposed to insi=
nuate itself within them,=20

and cause a reaction between their particles. But in this case, agreeably t=
o my hypothesis, the=20

electric fluid combines with the latent caloric previously existing there, =
and, adding to its repulsive=20

agency, causes it to overpower cohesion.[77]  Sir Humphry Davy was so much =
at a loss to=20

account for the continued ignition of wire at the poles of a Voltaic appara=
tus, that he considers it=20

an objection to the materiality of heat; since the wire could not be imagin=
ed to contain sufficient=20



caloric to keep up the emission of this principle for an unlimited time. Bu=
t if we conceive an=20

accumulation of heat to accompany that of electricity throughout the series=
, and to be propagated=20

from one end to the other, the explanation of the phenomenon in question is=
 attended by no=20

difficulty.  The effect of the Galvanic fluid on charcoal is very consisten=
t with my views, since, next=20

to metals, it is one of the best conductors of electricity, and the worst o=
f heat, and would therefore=20

arrest the last, and allow the other to pass on. Though peculiarly liable t=
o intense ignition, when=20

exposed between the poles of the Voltaic apparatus, it seems to me it does =
not display this=20

characteristic with common electricity. According to Sir Humphry Davy, when=
 in connexion with the=20

positive pole, and communicating by a platina wire with the negative pole, =
the latter is less heated=20

than when, with respect to the poles, the situation of the wire and charcoa=
l is reversed. The=20

rationale is obvious: charcoal, being a bad conductor, and a good radiator,=
 prevents the greater=20

part of the heat from reaching the platina, when placed between it and the =
source whence the heat=20

flows.  I had observed that as the number of pairs in Volta's pile had been=
 extended, and their size=20

and the energy of the interposed agents lessened, the ratio of the electric=
al effects to those of heat=20

had increased; till in De Luc's column they had become completely predomina=
nt; and, on the other=20

hand, when the pairs were made larger and fewer (as in Children's apparatus=
) the calorific=20

influence had gained the ascendancy. I was led to go farther in this way, a=
nd to examine whether=20

one pair of plates of enormous size, or what might be equivalent thereto, w=
ould not exhibit heat=20

more purely, and demonstrate it, equally with the electric fluid, a primary=
 product of Galvanic=20

combinations. The elementary battery of Wollaston, though productive of an =
evanescent ignition,=20

was too minute to allow him to make the observations which I had in view.  =
Twenty copper and=20

twenty zinc plates, about nineteen inches square, were supported vertically=
 in a frame, the=20

different metals alternating at one half inch distance from each other. All=
 the plates of the same=20

kind of metal were soldered to a common slip, so that each set of homogeneo=
us plates formed=20

one continuous metallic superficies. When the copper and zinc surfaces, thu=
s formed, are united=20

by an intervening wire, and the whole=20

THE UNITED STATES, or aceto-saline solution, in a vessel devoid of partitio=
ns, the wire becomes=20

intensely ignited; and when hydrogen is liberated it usually takes fire, pr=
oducing a very beautiful=20

undulating, or coruscating flame.  I am confident, that if Volta and the ot=
her investigators of=20

Galvanism, instead of multiplying the pairs of Galvanic plates, had sought =
to increase the effect by=20

enlarging one pair as I have done, (for I consider the copper and zinc surf=
aces as reduced to two=20

by the connexion) the apparatus would have been considered as presenting a =
new mode of=20

evolving heat, as a primary effect independently of electrical influence. T=
here is no other indication=20

of electricity when wires from the two surfaces touch the tongue, than a sl=
ight taste, such as is=20

excited by small pieces of zinc and silver laid on it and under it, and bro=
ught into contact with each=20

other.  It was with a view of examining the effects of the proximity and al=
ternation in the=20

heterogeneous plates that I had them cut into separate squares. By having t=
hem thus divided, I=20

have been enabled to ascertain that when all of one kind of metal are range=
d on one side of the=20

frame, and all of the other kind on the other side of it, the effect is no =
greater than might be=20

expected from one pair of plates.  Volta, considering the changes consequen=
t to his contrivance=20

as the effect of a movement in the electric fluid, called the process elect=
ro-motion, and the plates=20



producing it electro-motors. But the phenomena show that the plates, as I h=
ave arranged them,=20

are calori-motors, or heat movers, and the effect calori-motion. That this =
is a new view of the=20

subject, may be inferred from the following passage in Davy's Elements. Tha=
t great chemist=20

observes, "When very small conducting surfaces are used for conveying very =
large quantities of=20

electricity, they become ignited; and of the different conductors that have=
 been compared,=20

charcoal is most easily heated by electrical discharges,[78] next iron, pla=
tina, gold, then copper,=20

and lastly, zinc. The phenomena of electrical ignition, whether taking plac=
e in gaseous, fluid, or=20

solid bodies, always seem to be the result of a violent exertion of the ele=
ctrical attractive and=20

repellent powers, which may be connected with motions of the particles of t=
he substances=20

er than it is to bring back=20

fertility to a barren soil. It is easy to care for what is left and to repl=
ant and renew the growth, and=20

even to do this better and more quickly and with more and quicker profit th=
an nature has done it. It=20

is easy, too, by a wise and practical use of the forests that are left, to =
so husband them as to take=20

regular harvests from them as the farmer regularly harvests his fields or s=
elects the fatlings from=20

his flocks. He does not gather in all these at one fell swoop, taking the f=
at and the lean and the=20

young and the old, as the fisherman gathers all into his nets, and as the l=
umberman has felled the=20

woods, but he selects those that are ripe and carefully rears the rest unti=
l they are ready. Had the=20

timber been culled in this way from the forests year by year there would ha=
ve been a periodical=20

harvest, and as the mature trees were cut out a new growth would spring up.=
 But, on the contrary,=20

as in the old fable, the goose has been killed for its golden eggs, and the=
 source of a lasting profit=20

has been recklessly sacrificed.  Fortunately the land is can be discharged =
from these substances,=20

in consequence of the effect of the electricity, seems probable, from the c=
ircumstance, that a wire=20

of platina may be preserved in a state of intense ignition in vacuo, by mea=
ns of the Voltaic=20

apparatus, for an unlimited time; and such a wire cannot be supposed to con=
tain an inexhaustible=20

quantity of subtile matter."  But I demand where are the repellent and attr=
active powers to which=20

the ignition produced by the Calorimotor can be attributed? Besides, I woul=
d beg leave respectfully=20

to inquire of this illustrious author, whence the necessity of considering =
the heat evolved under the=20

circumstances alluded to as the effect of the electrical fluid; or why we m=
ay not as well suppose=20

the latter to be excited by the heat? It is evident, as he observes, that a=
 wire cannot be supposed=20

to contain an inexhaustible supply of matter however subtile; but wherefore=
 may not one kind of=20

subtile matter be supplied to it from the apparatus as well as another; esp=
ecially, when to suppose=20

such a supply is quite as inconsistent with the characteristics of pure ele=
ctricity, as with those of=20

pure caloric?  It is evident from Mr. Children's paper in the Annals of Phi=
losophy, on the subject of=20

his large apparatus, that the ignition produced by it was ascribed to elect=
rical excitement.  For the=20

purpose of ascertaining the necessity of the alternation and proximity of t=
he copper and zinc=20

plates, it has been mentioned that distinct square sheets were employed. Th=
e experiments have=20

since been repeated and found to succeed by Dr. Patterson=20


_
as it can be controlled. And still fortunately, by a wise administration, t=
he forests may be made a=20

profitable source of public income, instead of, as heretofore, the prey of =
the spoilers. It is useless=20

to complain of past mistakes. They have been, as we have pointed out, mere =
incidents of our=20

system, and possibly unavoidable. But the time has come when the system mus=
t be changed, and=20

the necessity for a change has become so apparent that it can not be long d=
elayed. It is not only=20

the commerce of the country that must suffer by a continuance of the system=
, but agriculture=20

suffers still more; and it is not only the public who will gain by a change=
, but the example will be=20

followed by the farmers, who will doubtless soon learn to take care of thei=
r own timber lands and=20

plant more, and so the benefit will be general. Besides, the farmers will n=
ot be long in discovering=20

the profit in growing timber, and would plant groves as one of the most pro=
fitable crops that could=20

be grown upon their rougher lands, or as a resting and restorative crop for=
 their worn soil.         *=20

*       *       *       *  Before the New York Academy of Science a few day=
s ago, Professor Albert R.=20

Leeds gave some "facts gathered from eight years of personal inspection as =
to the alleged=20

destruction of the Adirondack forests." He said that a rapid course of spoi=
lation was going on in=20

the outskirts of the forest, and the effect of it would soon be felt in the=
 flow of the Hudson. The=20

impression that the Adirondacks were pine-producing was a false one. Pine t=
rees were seldom=20

seen and the mountains were covered with spruce and hemlock. But the spruce=
s, owing to a=20

disease which attacked them a few years ago, are rapidly dying off. On the =
Ausable river and=20

along the shores of Lake Champlain the destruction of the forest is especia=
lly great. Persons living=20

about the forest start fires in the woodland which spread rapidly and are m=
ore destructive to the=20

trees than the lumbermen. Professor Leeds thought that the railways which a=
re making their way=20

through the forests would be an important element in their destruction, for=
 the sparks of the=20

locomotives would originate forest fires. He said that the purchase of the =
forests by the State might=20

not require so great an expenditure of money as was anticipated.         * =
      *       *       *       *  In=20

closing an article on "Forestry and Farming," the Germantown Telegraph main=
tains that the idea=20

that farmers and land-owners generally entertain that they may not live to =
enjoy the advantages of=20

the tree-planting, should be utterly banished from their minds. It will req=
uire only about twenty=20

years to realize the most liberal hopes of success; at least it will add to=
 the value of the farm by the=20

fact that the amount of timber is to be increased instead of diminished. We=
 all know how anxious=20

every purchaser of a tract of land is to know whether there is any and how =
much timber upon a=20

farm offered for sale. In fact, there is no greater mistake made than to cu=
t down the wood upon a=20

farm when purchased, with a view to meet the second payment; and this mista=
ke is invariably=20

brought home to everyone in a few years. It is like taking the life-blood o=
ut of the land.=20

SCIENTIFIC.   Official Weather Wisdom.  Almost from its invention the barom=
eter has been=20

vaunted an indicator of impending weather, and now we are in possession of =
numberless rules for=20

interpreting its indications, Lukens, by means of two continuous sheets, on=
e of zinc, the other of=20

copper, wound into two concentric coils or spirals. This, though the circum=
stance was not known=20

to them, was the form I had myself proposed to adopt, and had suggested as =
convenient for a=20

Galvanic apparatus to several friends at the beginning of the winter;[79] t=
hough the consideration=20

above stated induced me to prefer for a first experiment a more manageable =
arrangement.  Since=20

writing the above, I find that when, in the apparatus of twenty copper and =
twenty zinc plates, ten=20

copper plates on one side are connected with ten zinc on the other, and a c=
ommunication made=20



between the remaining twenty by a piece of iron wire, about the eighth of a=
n inch in diameter, the=20

wire enters into a vivid state of combustion on the immersion of the plates=
. Platina wire equal to=20

No. 18 (the largest I had at hand) is rapidly fused if substituted for the =
iron.  This arrangement is=20

equivalent to a battery of two large Galvanic pairs; excepting that there i=
s no insulation, all the=20

plates being plunged in one vessel. I have usually separated the pairs by a=
 board, extending=20

across the frame merely.  Indeed, when the forty plates were successively a=
ssociated in pairs, of=20

copper and zinc, though suspended in a fluid held in a common recipient wit=
hout partitions; there=20

was considerable intensity of Galvanic action. This shows that, independent=
ly of any power of=20

conducting electricity, there is some movement in the solvent fluid which t=
ends to carry forward the=20

Galvanic principle from the copper to the zinc end of the series. I infer t=
hat electro-caloric is=20

communicated in this case by circulation, and that in non-elastic fluids th=
e same difficulty exists as=20

to its retrocession from the positive to the negative end of the series, as=
 is found in the downward=20

passage of caloric through them.  It ought to be mentioned, that the connec=
ting wire should be=20

placed between the heterogeneous surfaces before their immersion, as the mo=
st intense ignition=20

takes place immediately afterward. If the connexion be made after the plate=
s are immersed, the=20

effect is much less powerful; and sometimes after two or three immersions t=
he apparatus loses its=20

power, though the action of the solvent should become in the interim much m=
ore violent. Without=20

any change in the latter, after the plates have been for some time suspende=
d in the air, they=20

regain their efficacy. I had observed in a Galvanic pile of three hundred p=
airs of two inches square,=20

a like consequence resulting from a simultaneous immersion of the whole.[80=
] The bars holding=20

the plates were balanced by weights, as window-sashes are, so that all the =
plates could be very=20

quickly dipped. A platina wire, No. 18, was fused into a globule, while the=
 evolution of potassium=20

was demonstrated by a rose-coloured flame arising from some potash which ha=
d been placed=20

between the poles. The heat however diminished in a few seconds, though the=
 greater extrication=20

of hydrogen from the plates indicated a more intense chemical action.  Agre=
eably to an=20

observation of Dr. Patterson, electrical excitement may be detected in the =
apparatus by the=20

condensing electroscope; but this is no more than what Volta observed to be=
 the consequence of=20

the contact of heterogeneous metals.  The thinnest piece of charcoal interc=
epts the calorific agent,=20

whatever it may be. In order to ascertain this, the inside of a hollow bras=
s cylinder,=20

sirous of attaining=20

weather wisdom, these rules have tended to give the barometer its widely re=
cognized reputation,=20

rather than any really infallible principles, clearly formulated. With no o=
ther philosophical=20

instrument have people so deluded themselves as with the barometer. Meteoro=
logy having=20

become almost an official monopoly, the officials seem to have made the rea=
diest and largest=20

amount of reputation out of the barometer as a weather glass; for all that =
they have had to do is to=20

compile rules from a number of authors, without any necessity of acknowledg=
ment, print as much=20

as they please at the Government expense, give it away freely, and the noto=
riety of authorship is=20

secured easily and expeditiously. Thus the British nation has been official=
ly supplied with about=20

eighteen and the outside of another smaller cylinder of the same substance,=
 were made conical=20

and correspondent, so that the greater would contain the less, and leave an=
 interstice of about=20

one-sixteenth of an inch between them. This interstice was filled with wood=
, by plugging the larger=20

cylinder with this material, and excavating the plug till it would permit t=
he smaller brass cylinder to=20

be driven in. The excavation and the fitting of the cylinders was performed=
 accurately by means of=20

a turning lathe. The wood in the interstice was then charred by exposing th=
e whole covered by=20

sand in a crucible to a red heat. The charcoal, notwithstanding the shrinka=
ge consequent to the=20

fire, was brought into complete contact with the inclosing metallic surface=
s by pressing the interior=20

cylinder further into the exterior one.  Thus prepared, the interior cylind=
er being made to=20

the Galvanic surfaces, a wire brought from the other Galvanic surface into =

ignition. The contact of the charcoal with the containing metals probably t=
