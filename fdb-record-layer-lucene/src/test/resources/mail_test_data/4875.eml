life. What will it be? Since every human unit has ultimately to progress in its evolution, and since 

that "man" will be reborn at some future time as a good, sincere, well-meaning man, his sentence 

to be re-incarnated as a hawk may simply mean that he will then be regarded metaphorically as 

such. That, notwithstanding his real, good, intrinsic qualities, he will, perhaps during a long life, be 

unjustly and falsely charged with and suspected of greed and hypocrisy and of secret exactions, 

all of which will make him suffer more than he can bear. The law of retribution can never err, and 

yet how many such innocent victims of false appearance and human malice do we not meet in this 

world of incessant illusion, of mistake and deliberate wickedness. We see them every day, and 

they may be found within the personal experience of each of us. What Orientalist can say with any 

degree of assurance that he has understood the religions of old? The metaphorical language of 

the priests has never been more than superficially revealed, and the hieroglyphics have been very 

poorly mastered to this day.(459)  What says Planchet met them hard by the shed. D'Artagnan 

jumped into the saddle, then the old companions in arms again shook hands. D'Artagnan and 

Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris.  But after he had gone about two 

hundred steps D'Artagnan stopped short, alighted, threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of 

Planchet and took the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle.  "What's the 

matter?" asked Planchet.  "This is the matter: be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his 

dupe. Stand here, don't stir, turn your back to the road and wait for me."  Having thus spoken, 

D'Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the 

village. He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the 

convent of the Jesuits, an open space surrounded by a hedge.  The moon had now risen and he 

could see well enough to retrace his road.  He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it; in 

passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place, he remarked that the 

window was again lighted up and he was

transmigration, and does it clash with anything that we say now?       It will be observed that this 

philosophy of cycles, which was     allegorized by the Egyptian Hierophants in the "cycle of 

necessity," explains at the same time the allegory of the "Fall of     Man." According to the Arabian 

descriptions, each of the seven     chambers of the returned to his own apartment and that when 

he did it would not be alone.  In truth, in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low 

whispers.  Close to the hedge the steps stopped.  D'Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of 

the hedge.  Two men, to the astonishment of D'Artagnan, appeared shortly; soon, however, his 

surprise vanished, for he

of the metaphysical thought of     their builders. The apex is lost in the clear blue sky of the land 

of the Pharaohs, and typifies the primordial point lost in the     unseen Universe from whence 

started the first race of the     harmonious voice; one of these two men was a woman disguised as 

a cavalier.  "Calm yourself, dear Rene," said the soft voice, "the same thing will never happen 

again. I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we 

shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance
