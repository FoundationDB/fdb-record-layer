philodendron monstera has been polished and is dry, apply with a brush Pont=

 younger generation of writers, and so I am not at all surprised that in th=

 or fifteen years the heroes drink too much vodka and the heroines are not =
over-chaste.  I read French books, and I look out of the window which is op=

on monstera has been polished and is dry, apply with a brush Pontic wax mel=
ted over a fire and mixed with a little oil; then after this he should brin=
g the wax to a sweat by warming it and the wall at close quarters with char=

eneration of writers, and so I am not at all surprised that in the new work=
s with which our literature has been enriched during the last ten or fiftee=
n years the heroes drink too much vodka and the heroines are not over-chast=
e.  I read French books, and I look out of the window which is open; I can =
see the spikes of my garden-fence, two or three scraggy trees, and beyond t=
he fence the road, the fields, and beyond them a broad _
bits of gold, and makes them combine with itself. The water is then poured =
off, and the rest=20

emptied into a cloth and squeezed in the hands, whereupon the quicksilver, =
being a liquid,=20

escapes through the loose texture of the cloth, but the gold, which has bee=
n brought together by=20

the squeezing, is found inside in a pure state.     CHAPTER IX  CINNABAR (_=
continued_)   1. I will=20

now return to the preparation of vermilion. When the lumps of ore are dry, =
they are crushed in iron=20

mortars, and repeatedly washed and heated until the impurities are gone, an=
d the colours come.=20

When the cinnabar has given up its quicksilver, and thus lost the natural v=
irtues that it previously=20

had, it becomes soft in quality and its powers are feeble.  2. Hence, thoug=
h it keeps its colour=20

perfectly when applied in the polished stucco finish of closed apartments, =
yet in open apartments,=20

such as peristyles or exedrae or and utterly unlike the quiet, gentlemanly =
tone to which I am=20

accustomed when I read the works of our medical and scientific writers. It =
oppresses me to read=20

not only the articles written by serious Russians, but even works translate=
d or edited by them. The=20

pretentious, edifying tone of the preface; the redundancy of remarks made b=
y the translator, which=20

prevent me from concentrating my attention; the question marks and "sic" in=
 parenthesis scattered=20

all over the book or article by the liberal translator, are to my mind an o=
utrage on the author and on=20

my independence as a reader.  Once I was summoned as an expert to a circuit=
 court; in an=20

interval one of my fellow-experts drew my attention to the rudeness of the =
public prosecutor to the=20

defendants, among whom there were two ladies of good education. I believe I=
 did not exaggerate=20

at all when I told him that the prosecutor's manner was no=20


_
bright rays of the sun and moon can penetrate, it is spoiled by contact wit=
h them, loses the=20

strength of its colour, and turns black. Among many others, the secretary F=
aberius, who wished to=20

have his house on the Aventine finished in elegant style, applied vermilion=
 to all the walls of the=20

peristyle; but after thirty days they turned to an ugly and mottled colour.=
 He therefore made a=20

contract to have other colours applied instead of vermilion.  3. But anybod=
y who is more particular,=20

and who wants a polished finish of vermilion that will keep its proper colo=
ur, articles to one=20

another. Their manners are, indeed, so rude that I cannot speak of them wit=
hout distaste. They=20

treat one another and the writers they criticize either with superfluous re=
spect, at the sacrifice of=20

their own dignity, or, on the contrary, with far more ruthlessness than I h=
ave shown in my notes=20

and my thoughts in regard to my future son-in-law Gnekker. Accusations of i=
rrationality, of evil=20

intentions, and, indeed, of every sort of crime, form an habitual ornament =
of serious articles. And=20

that, as young medical men are fond of saying in their=20
