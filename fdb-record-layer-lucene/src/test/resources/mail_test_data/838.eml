believed, they say, 'Shall we believe as the fools have believed?' Assuredl=

they know it not.  And when they meet those who have believed, they say, 'W=

God will mock at them, and keep them in their exceeding wickedness, wanderi=

guidance: but their=20

likeness of those who have kindled a fire _in the dark_, and when it hath e=
nlightened what is=20

around them, God taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, seei=
ng not.  _They are_=20

deaf, dumb, blind: therefore they will not turn back.  Or _they are_ like _=
people in_ a storm of rain=20

from heaven, wherein are darkness and thunder and lightning: they put their=
 fingers in their ears=20

because of the vehement sounds of the thunder, for fear of death. And God e=
ncompasseth the=20

unbelievers.  The lightning almost snatcheth away their eyes: whenever it s=
hineth on them they=20

walk in _the light of_ it, but when darkness cometh on them they stand stil=
l. And if God pleased He=20

would certainly take away their ears and eyes: for God is all-powerful.    =
 (ii. 7-19.)   LXXXV.  O ye=20

who have believed, take not the Jews and Christians as friends. They are fr=
iends one to another;=20

and whosoever of you taketh them as his friends, verily he is _of the numbe=
r_ of them.  O ye who=20

have believed, take not as friends those who have made your religion a laug=
hing-stock and a jest,=20

of those who have received the Scripture before you, and the unbelievers: (=
But fear God if ye be=20

believers:)  And _those who_ when ye call to prayer make it a laughing-stoc=
k and a jest. This=20

_they do_ because they are a people who do not understand.     (v. 56, 62, =
63.)   LXXXVI.  [+]The=20

servants of the Merciful are they that walk upon the earth softly; and when=
 the ignorant speak unto=20

them, they reply 'Peace!'--  And they that pass the night worshipping their=
 Lord, prostrate and=20

standing;--  And that say, 'O our Lord, turn away from us the torment of He=

SAY YE, We believe in God, and in that which hath been sent down unto us (_=
namely, the Kur-

an_), and what hath been sent down unto Abraham (_the ten books_), and Ishm=
ael, abuses=20

followed from this right of wardship, as it was called, and the unfortunate=
 French girls and children=20

who were subjected to it were no better off than the English. We are not es=
pecially concerned here=20

with the case of minor heirs under _garde-noble_, or ward, except where the=
se heirs were girls.=20

The girl so situated must not marry without the consent of the lord who hel=
d the _garde-noble_ of=20

her person and of her domain. If she did so she was liable to fines and eve=
n to forfeiture of her fief;=20

and this power was one which the feudal lords did not hesitate to exercise.=
 We find Saint Louis=20

objecting to the marriage of Jeanne, heiress of the county of Ponthieu, to =
the King of England, and=20

to the marriage of the Countess of Flanders, widow of Count Ferrand, to Sim=
on de Montfort, a=20

vassal of the King of England. Both these instances show the reason which, =
in such a system as=20

feudalism, underlay a power apparently so arbitrary; the suzerain, in mere =
self-defence, could not=20



allow one of his fiefs to fall into the possession of a possible enemy.  Th=
ere was another right, a=20

corollary to this one. The lord could compel his female ward to marry in or=
der that the military=20

duties of the fief might be performed by a man. Saint Louis compelled Matil=
da of Flanders to marry=20

Thomas, Prince of Savoy. The famous _Assises de Jerusalem_, organizing one =
of the most=20

compact bodies which feudalism developed, to defend the Holy Sepulchre in t=
he midst of hostile=20

infidels, contains express provisions on this subject. According to this co=
de, the baron could say to=20

his female vassal: "Dame, you owe service of marriage." He then designated =
three suitable=20

candidates, and she had to choose from among them. The regulations of the s=
o-called=20

_Etablissements de Saint Louis_ on this subject are so interesting that we =
may give a paraphrase=20

of a considerable portion of them. "When a lady becomes a widow, and is adv=
anced in years, and=20

has a daughter, the seigneur to whom she owes allegiance may come to her an=
d say: 'Dame, I=20

wish you to give me surety that you will not marry your daughter without my=
 advice and consent,=20

or without the advice and consent of her father's relatives; for she is the=
 daughter of my liegeman,=20

and therefore I do not wish her to be deprived of this advice.' Then it beh=
ooves the lady to give=20

him due surety. And when the girl shall be of marriageable age, if the lady=
 find anyone who asks=20

her in marriage, she must come before the seigneur and the relatives of the=
 girl's father and say to=20

them: 'Sire, my daughter is asked in marriage, and I will not give her with=
out your consent, nor=20

should I do so. Now give me your good and faithful counsel; for a certain m=
an has asked for her'=20

(and she must give his name). And if the seigneur say: 'I do not wish this =
man to have her, for so-

and-so, who is richer and of better rank than the one you have named, has a=
sked me for her, and=20

will take her willingly' (and he shall name the man); or if the relatives o=
n the father's side say: 'We=20

know a richer and a better man than either of those you have=20


_
_his children_, and what Moses received (_namely, the Pentateuch_), and Jes=
us (_namely, the=20

Gospel_), and what the prophets received from their Lord (_namely, books an=
d signs_): we make=20

no separation of any of them, _believing in some, and disbelieving in some,=
 like the Jews and the=20

Christians_; and we resign ourselves unto Him.     (ii. 130.) then shall th=
ey deliberate and choose=20

the best of the three and the one most advantageous to the demoiselle. And =
he who is chosen as=20

the best should be really thought so, for no one should make a mockery of l=
aw. And if the lady=20

marry her daughter without the consent of her seigneur and of the relatives=
 on the father's side,=20

after she had been=20

_ADAM AND EVE._   _Remember, O Mohammad_, when thy Lord said unto the angel=
s, I am=20

about to place in the earth a vicegerent _to act for me in the execution of=
 my ordinances therein,=20

namely, Adam_,--they said, Wilt Thou place in it one who will corrupt in it=
 _by disobediences_, and=20

will shed blood (_as did the sons of to do so, she shall lose her movable g=
oods," on which the=20

seigneur is given the power of distraint. There is in this enactment elabor=
ate provision for=20

satisfying everybody but the person one would think most interested the you=
ng lady. Her consent=20

to the arrangement was, to the mediaeval mind, a matter of small moment.  T=
