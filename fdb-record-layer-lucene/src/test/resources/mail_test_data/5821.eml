s in surgery for the=20

purpose of curing diseases or injuries, has for many years been the object =
of statutory legislation.=20

The necessity and propriety of regulating by law such practices is generall=
y conceded. It is=20

manifest to all that a person engaging in the practice of medicine or surge=

holding himself out to the world, and especially to his patients, as one qu=
alified by education and=20

experience to possess more than ordinary skill and ability to deal with the=
 great problems of health=20

and life. He professes to the world that he is competent and qualified to e=
nter into the closest and=20

most confidential relations with the sick and afflicted, and that he is a f=
it and proper person to be=20

permitted freely, and at all hours and all seasons, to enter the homes, the=
 family circle, and the=20

private chamber of persons suffering from disease or injury. All this he pr=
ofesses and does upon=20

his own account, and for his own profit.  =3DStatutory Regulation of the Ri=
