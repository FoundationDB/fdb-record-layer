communiter omnes doctores qui de hac materia locuti sunt, et sicut falsarii=
 monet=C3=A6 et pecuniarum=20

regis,=E2=80=99 &c.  =E2=80=98I thus perceive that all the doctors in theol=
ogy agree in saying, that such sorceries,=20

charms and witchcraft can only succeed by the work of the devil, or by his =
false means;=E2=80=94and that=20

these sorceries, and suchlike superstitions, have not of themselves the pow=
er of hurting any one,=20

but that the devils have the ability to injure any person so far only as sh=
all be permitted them by=20

God.  =E2=80=98The devils will not do any thing for those that call on them=
, unless they perform three things,=20

namely, pay them divine honour, which ought solely to be paid to God, by of=
fering them homage=20

and adoration, proving themselves false to the holy catholic faith,=E2=80=
=94and the doing of which makes=20

them guilty of the crime of high treason.  =E2=80=98_Primum Corrolarium._ S=
hould it happen, that for the=20

circumstances above stated, any of these invocators of the devil, idolaters=
, and traitors to the king,=20

should be confined in prison, and that during the time that their process i=
s carried to judgment, any=20

accomplice of their crimes should deliver or cause them to be delivered fro=
m prison, he shall be=20

punished just as these idolaters would have been, as guilty of the crime of=
 high treason in the first=20

and fourth degree.  =E2=80=98_Secundum Corrolarium._ If any subject who sha=
ll give, or promise to give, a=20

large sum of money to another for poisoning the king his sovereign lord, an=
d the bargain be=20

proven and the poisons laid, although they may fail to produce their effect=
s, through the=20

interference of the providence of God or other means,=E2=80=94those who hav=
e committed this crime are=20

guilty of being traitors and disloyal to their sovereign, and shall suffer =
the double death for high=20

treason in the first degree.  =E2=80=98_Tertium Corrolarium._ Any subject w=
ho, by treachery and hypocrisy,=20

shall during any mummeries, through malice aforethought, procure dresses fo=
r his king, and,=20

having clothed him in such dresses, shall cause them to be set on fire, wit=
h the intent that the king=20

his sovereign may be burnt in them, so that he may obtain his kingdom, comm=
its high treason in=20

the first degree, is a tyrant and disloyal to his king, and is deserving of=
 the double death, even=20

should his sovereign escape, for the noble and valiant persons who may have=
 been burnt to death=20

in exquisite pain through his means.  =E2=80=98_Quartum Corrolarium est_: W=
hen any subject and vassal to=20

the king shall make alliances with those who are mortal enemies to his sove=
reign and kingdom, he=20

cannot exculpate himself from being guilty of treason; more especially when=
 he shall send advice=20

to the men at arms of the enemy not to surrender any forts they may have ga=
ined in the=20

kingdom,=E2=80=94for that when he shall be employed against them he will af=
ford them succour. And=20

beside, when he not only shall prevent the march of any armies against such=
 enemies, but shall=20

encourage them by secret and underhand means, he is a traitor to his king a=
nd country, and is=20

deserving of the double death.  =E2=80=98_Quintum Corrolarium est_: If any =
subject or vassal shall, through=20

deceit and false information, sow the seeds of dissention between the king =
and queen, by telling=20

the latter that the king hates her so mortally he is determined on having h=
er and her children put to=20

death, and that she has no other remedy to prevent this but flying out of t=
he kingdom with her=20

children; advising her strongly at the same time, to put this plan into exe=
cution, and offering to=20

conduct her out of the realm to any castle she may please, adding with much=
 subtilty, and by way=20

of caution, that the queen must keep this advice very secret, lest she may =
be prevented from=20

following it; and if, in order to accomplish this plan, he propose to the q=
ueen that she should=20

undertake different pilgrimages until she be in a place of safety, intendin=
g by this means to confine=20

her and her children in some of his prisons, and to gloss it over to the ki=
ng, so that he may=20



succeed him in his crown and kingdom. Any subject guilty of such a crime me=
ntioned. If the edges=20

of the wound are swollen, or show signs of inflammation or gangrene, or if =
pus or adhesive=20

material is present on the edges of the wound, we may infer that the wound =
was inflicted some=20

little time before death. Of course, if cicatrization has commenced, some d=
ays must have elapsed=20

before death after the wound was received. If the blow causing a contusion =
was inflicted some=20

time before death, there will be more or less of a general swelling of the =
region, partly due to the=20

blood effused, but also partly due to =C5=93dema.  It is not always easy to=
 say whether a _fracture_=20

was produced while the body was living or dead. If the body was still warm =
when a post-mortem=20

fracture was produced there is little difference from an ante-mortem fractu=
re, except that there=20

may be a little less blood effused. In a fracture produced after rigor mort=
is has set in there is little=20

or no blood effused. In the case of fractures the presence of callus, indic=
ating the process of=20

repair, shows that the accident occurred during life, and, as we have alrea=
dy seen, we may form=20

some idea of the length of time elapsed between the injury and the time of =
death. On the cadaver=20

it is said to be harder to cause fractures and lesions of the skin than on =
the living body. Casper=20

says that fractures of the hyoid bone and the larynx are impossible after d=
eath, and he also was=20

not able to rupture the liver or spleen.  In distinction to the characteris=
tic signs of a wound inflicted=20

during life, we may mention briefly some of the signs of post-mortem wounds=
 when the wound has=20

been inflicted from two to ten or twelve hours or more after death:  (1) Th=
e hemorrhage is slight in=20

amount and may fail altogether.  (2) The character of the hemorrhage is ven=
ous, corresponding to=20

the source of the hemorrhage from the veins, the arteries being nearly empt=
y after death.  (3) The=20

edges of the wound are not deeply stained, and this staining may be removed=
 by washing. The=20

spaces between the tissues are not infiltrated with blood.  (4) The blood r=
emains either entirely=20

fluid or, if there are clots, these are _softer_ than those in an ante-mort=
em wound, and only a=20

portion of the blood is thus clotted. There are no clots plugging the open =
mouths of the arteries on=20

the surface of the wound; the veins may or may not be closed by an imperfec=
t clot.  (5) The skin of=20

the edges is not everted or inverted.  (6) The sides of the wound do not ga=
pe and their surfaces=20

are smooth and even, as the tissues are not unevenly retracted.  R=C3=89SUM=
=C3=89.=E2=80=94It is very easy from=20

the foregoing to distinguish between a wound inflicted before death and one=
 ten or twelve hours=20

after death.  If the hemorrhage has been abundant and arterial, if it has i=
nfiltrated between and=20

deeply stained the tissues and the stain cannot readily be washed off; if t=
he blood coagulates=20

completely and the coagula are firm and are found lying in the wound, plugg=
ing the vessels, and=20

incorporated with the tissues between which they lie; if the edges of the s=
kin are everted and the=20

sides of the wound are retracted and uneven=E2=80=94under these circumstanc=
es, we may be sure that=20

the wound was inflicted during life or a very short time after death. If, o=
n the contrary, the=20

hemorrhage is slight in amount or almost fails altogether; if it is venous =
in character; if the edges of=20

the wound are only stained by imbibition of the blood, which is not infiltr=
ated between the tissues,=20

and the stain may be washed off; if the blood is not at all or only slightl=
y clotted and the clots are=20

soft; if the skin is not everted and the sides of the wound are smooth and =
lie nearly in contact; if=20

there are no clots plugging the divided arteries on the surface=E2=80=94the=
n we need have little hesitancy=20

in saying that the wound was produced after death, but probably not later t=
han ten or twelve hours=20

after death. If the wound was inflicted still longer after death and before=
 putrefaction, then we=20

would have a lack of the signs due to hemorrhage, clots, staining, etc. If =
we find the conditions=20



more or less midway between the first two, we may be left in some doubt as =
to the date of the=20

injury. Thus if the=20

 to prove it, =E2=80=98esset=20

adjuvare c=C5=93lum facibus.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98_Sextum Corrolarium est_: I=
f any subject or vassal, through ambition to=20

obtain a crown and kingdom, shall visit the pope, and impose on him, by imp=
uting falsely and=20

wickedly crimes and vices against his king and sovereign lord, which would =
be blots in his royal=20

issue, concluding thence that such a king is unworthy to reign, and his chi=
ldren unfit to succeed=20

him, and requiring most urgently of the pope that he would issue a declarat=
ion to the effect of=20

depriving the king and his children of the crown; and likewise declaring, t=
hat the kingdom had=20

devolved to him and his race, requesting that the pope would grant absoluti=
on to all the vassals of=20

the realm who should adhere to him, giving them a dispensation for the oath=
s of fidelity that all=20

subjects are obliged to take to their king,=E2=80=94such as may commit the =
above crime are disloyal=20

traitors to their sovereign, and guilty of high treason in the first and se=
cond degrees.  =E2=80=98_Septimum=20

easily washed off=E2=80=94then=20

we can only say that the wound was inflicted during life or within two hour=
s or so after death, and=20

this fact is often enough for the purposes of the medico-legal inquiry.  Th=
e same is the case with=20

contusions where there is no bleeding externally. If we have a bluish, viol=
et, green, or yellow tumor=20

with or without more or less superficial =C5=93dema; if this tumor fluctuat=
es or is hard, but in either case=20

ought to open under him and swallow him up, like to Coran, Nathan and Abira=

d third degrees.  =E2=80=98_Nonum et=20

In contusions especially we may have difficulty, as the sign of fluidity of=
 the blood may fail and=20

putrefaction may modify the conditions of the wound unless parts deep benea=
th the surface be=20

examined.  We see, then, that in some cases it is very easy to say that a w=
ound was inflicted post=20

mortem. If a wound was not inflicted until ten or twelve hours after death =
or even sooner, we=20

cannot easily mistake it. But in many cases it may be hard or impossible to=
 say whether a wound=20

was inflicted during life or within an hour or two after death. Here we mus=
t be cautious in=20

expressing an opinion which should be guarded. But we should remember that =
it is important to be=20

able to state that a wound was inflicted before or immediately after death,=
 as no one but a=20

murderer would think of inflicting a fatal injury on a body immediately aft=
er death. In such cases a=20

well-guarded medical opinion may often meet all the requirements of the cas=
