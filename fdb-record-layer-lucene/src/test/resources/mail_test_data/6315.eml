though I don't like sewing on buttons, I'll do it, or even--even--I'll darn=

Jasmine."  Jasmine laughed.  "It's nothing of that kind, Eyebright; it's so=
mething much, much more=20

important. You know, Daisy, what we came up to London for--why, of course y=
ou know why we left=20

all our dear friends, and are living in about the very dullest part of Lond=
on--of course you know?"=20

"Was it?" said Daisy, looking dubious; "was it--I never could quite make ou=
t--because Primrose did=20

not like Mrs. Ellsworthy?"  "Oh, you silly, silly little thing! What a drea=
dful thing to get into your=20

head, Daisy-flower! I did think you knew why we came to town, and gave ever=
ything up, and made=20

ourselves so miserable."  "We did make ourselves miserable," sighed Daisy, =
"and I had to take Mr.=20

Dove for my friend. I like to have him for my friend, though. What was the =
reason, please,=20

Jasmine?"  "We came to London for the glorious privilege of being independe=

Jasmine, in a majestic voice. "Daisy, I'm going to be it. I'm going to flin=

I'm going to soar."  "It sounds lovely," said Daisy. "You always were a poe=

that chair, and stop staring at me for all the world like an old wood-owl, =
'most scaring the wits out=20

of me. One would think you'd gone clean out of your head. I never heard you=
 talk so in all my born=20

days. If you ain't sick, you're in a heap of trouble. Now, do as I tell you=
 and set down. Tell me=20

what's wrong, that is if that's what you come down for."  "That's why I com=
e down, Clemmie," he=20

said, slouching into one of the kitchen chairs. "I heerd you come down-stai=
rs, and I just had to=20

follow. Fust of all, I want to tell you how bad I feel about them things I =
said yesterday morning that=20

hurt your feelings so."  "For the lan' sakes! Be that what's ailing you? I =
thought it was something=20

that amounted to something," she declared, the color rising into her faded =
cheeks.  "That does=20

amount to something. It means a lot to me. That ain't all, but I wanted to =
get it off my chest fust. I=20

I suppose poets do talk like that; but how are you going to be independent,=
 Jasmine?"  "I'm going=20

now I burst the bonds. Daisy, I have formed a little theory. I believe girl=

with a strong bias in a particular direction. You see, it with purty tolera=

much I think of you."  "Be you beginning to propose again?" she asked, her =
arms akimbo. "If that's=20
