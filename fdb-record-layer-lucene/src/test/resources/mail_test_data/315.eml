into a hunting party and killed a lot of the beasts. There wasn't any big o=

had become of the children?"  "They weren't eaten at all. They had wandered=
 off into the woods,=20

and some natives found them and took care of them.  Eventually, they got ba=

{155}  CHAPTER X  KING LOUIS BUILDS A MIGHTY FORT  Afar off, in the little =
Dutch town of=20

Ryswick, the two kings, William and Louis, had signed the treaty of peace. =
 It was agreed that all=20

the places captured by either French or English soldiers during the war sho=
uld be given back=20

again.  What did this mean to Canada and America?  Only this: that all thes=
e eight years of=20

bloodshed had been in vain.  Neither French nor English were a whit the ric=
her or more powerful=20

than before.  You must always remember that what both sides were really fig=
hting for was the=20

mastery of the North-American continent.  Vast as it was, there was not roo=
m enough for both.=20

One side or other must possess it.  Should it be French or English?  No las=
ting peace could there=20

be as long=20


_
But though they looked all along the big shaft, and though the place was we=
ll lighted by extra=20

lamps that were turned on when the investigation started, no trace could be=
 found of the workmen,=20

who had been left in the tunnel to finish tamping the blast charges. The pa=
rty reached the rocky=20

heading, in the face of which the powerful explosive had been placed, and n=
ot an Indian was in=20

sight. Nor, as far as could be told, was there any side niche, or blind sha=
ft, in which they could be=20

hiding.  Sometimes, when small blasts were set off, the men would go behind=
 a projecting=20

shoulder of rock to wait until the charge had been fired, but now unsettled=
.  A great advantage was=20

gained for Canada when the Iroquois at length gave way.  Their chiefs, jour=
neying to Montreal in=20

1701, smoked the calumet with Governor de Callires and handed him the belt =
of wampum--which=20

signified that there should be no more fighting between Onontio and the Fiv=
e Nations.  Never=20

again did the Iroquois make serious trouble for the people of Canada, and t=
he fetters {156} which=20

had so long bound the fur trade were for ever removed.  But the very next y=
ear after this had=20

happened the Peace of Ryswick came to an end.  It had lasted only five year=
s, and it was the=20

reckless ambition of Louis the Fourteenth=20


_
"It is queer," admitted Walter Titus. "Where can the men have gone?"  "That=
's what I want to=20

know!" exclaimed Tim.  "Are you sure they didn't come out the mouth of the =
tunnel?" asked Job=20

Titus.  "Positive," asserted Tom. I was there all the while, rigging up the=
 fires."  "We'll call the roll,=20

and check up," decided Job Titus.  "Get Serato to help."  The Indian forema=
n had not been in the=20

tunnel with the last shift of men, having left them to Tim Sullivan to get =
out in time. The Indian=20

foreman was called from his supper in the shack where he had his headquarte=
rs, and the roll of=20

workmen was called.  Ten men were missing, and when this fact became known =
there were=20

uneasy looks among the others.  "Well," said Mr. Titus, after a pause. "The=
 men are either in the=20

tunnel or out of it. If they're in we don't dare set off the blast, and if =
they're out they'll show up,=20

sooner or later, for supper. I never knew any of 'em to miss a meal."  "If =
such a thing were=20

possible," said Walter Titus, "I would say that our rivals had a hand in th=
is, and had induced our=20

men to bolt in order to cripple our force. But we haven't seen any of Blake=
son & Grinder's=20

emissaries about, and, if they were, how could they get the ten men out of =
the tunnel without our=20

seeing them? It's impossible!"  "Well, what did happen then?" asked Tom.  "=
I'm inclined to think=20

that the men came out and neither you, nor any one else, saw them. They ran=
 away for reasons of=20

their own. We'll take another look in the morning, and then set off the bla=
st."  And this was done.=20

There being no trace of the men in the tunnel it was deemed safe to explode=
 the charges. This=20

was done, a great amount of rock being loosened.  The laborers hung back wh=
en the orders were=20

given to go in and clean up. There were mutterings among them.  "What's the=
 matter?" asked Job=20

Titus.  "Them afraid," answered Serato. "Them say devil in tunnel eat um up=
! No go in."  "They=20

won't go in, eh?" cried Tim Sullivan. "Well, they will thot! If there's a d=
ivil inside there's a worse one=20

outside, an' thot's me! Git in there now, ye black-livered spalapeens!" and=
 catching up a big club=20

the Irishman made a rush for the hesitating laborers. With a howl they rush=
ed into the tunnel, and=20

were soon loading rock into the dump like Kondiaronk, "The Rat," could excl=
aim to his courtiers, "I=20

have killed the peace!"  The new war is known in Europe as the War of the S=
panish Succession,=20

because Louis wanted to put his Bourbon nephew on the vacant throne of Spai=
n.  In America it is=20

always called "Queen Anne's War."  William the Third had died that year, an=
d Queen Anne had=20

succeeded him on the English throne.  The English colonists were still as m=
uch in earnest as ever=20

about the importance of overcoming by any means in their power the "French =
danger," as they=20

called it.  They did not hesitate to employ the tribes of Indians, however =
remote, in the work of=20

harrying the French settlements, both east and west.  Port Royal was again =
attacked, only this=20

time the attack was ignominiously repulsed.  Meanwhile the French were not =
idle.  De Callires had=20

strongly advised the establishment of several posts on the lake for the rec=
eption of furs and=20

merchandise.  In June 1701 La Motte Cadillac, with a Jesuit priest and 100 =
men, was despatched=20

to build a fort at Detroit. Governor de Callires hesitated to attack Albany=
 until he could feel=20

confident that the long-dreaded Iroquois Indians would not return to the ol=
d allies, the English.  He=20

was still making up his mind when illness seized him, and {157} in 1703 he =
died.  His successor=20

was the Marquis de Vaudreuil.  But if the authorities at Quebec doubted the=
 wisdom of provoking=20

Indian hostility in their quarrel with the New Yorkers, Vaudreuil and his f=
riends felt sure of=20

Abenakis friendship.  This famous tribe had long hated the New Englanders w=
ith a deadly hate.=20

They had committed terrible outrages for many years upon the unfortunate Ya=
nkee settlers.  De=20

Vaudreuil feared that if the Abenakis were to be at peace too long, they mi=
ght forget their hatred=20



and even become on friendly terms with the Americans.  So Canadian priests =
and soldiers were=20

sent amongst them to stir up their zeal.  They did not want any pitched bat=
tles or long sieges.=20

Their policy was to persecute and slay the outlying farmers and woodmen, to=
 make settlement=20

outside of the large towns impossible.  One of the most terrible of these r=
aids occurred at Deerfield=20

in Massachusetts.  This place was on the river Connecticut.  A party under =
De Rouville crept up=20


_
Chapter XVI  On the Watch   The mystery of the disappearance of the ten men=
--for mystery it was-

-remained, and as no side opening or passage could be found within the tunn=
el, it came to be the=20

generally accepted explanation that the laborers had come out unobserved, a=
nd, for reasons of=20

their own, had run away.  This habit on the part of the Peruvian workers wa=
s not unusual. In fact,=20

the Titus brothers following the river on the ice, reached Deerfield in the=
 dark.  What had=20

happened at Schenectady and Salmon Falls happened here.  The surprised peop=
le could make=20

no defence, the town was burnt, fifty people slaughtered, almost without re=
sistance, and a hundred=20

more carried away prisoners.  A man never laid his head on the pillow at ni=
ght without the fear that=20

a red assassin might scalp it ere morning=20
