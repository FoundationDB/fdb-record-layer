DE LEADER OF THE HERD   By defeating Young Black Buck in combat, White Tail=
 was, according to the law of the herd, chosen leader until another should =
grow up and displace him. The decision on the battlefield could not be chan=
ged or altered. Even Black Buck and his _
without destroying both. The theory of revelation would have to be modified=
. Muslims would have=20

to give up their doctrine of the syllabic inspiration of the Kur-an and exe=
rcise their moral sense in=20

distinguishing between the particular and the general, the temporary and th=
e permanent: they=20

would have to recognise that there was much in Mohammad's teaching which, t=
hough useful at=20

the time, is inapplicable to the present conditions of life; that his knowl=
edge was often partial, and=20

his judgment sometimes at fault; that the moral sense is capable of educati=
on as much as the=20

intellect, and, therefore, that what was apparently moral and wise in the s=
eventh century may quite=20

possibly be immoral and suicidal in a society of the nineteenth century. Mo=
hammad himself said,=20

according to tradition, 'I am no more than a man: when I order you anything=
 respecting religion,=20

receive it; and when I order you about the affairs of the world, then I am =
nothing more than man.'=20

And he seemed to foresee that the time would come when his minor regulation=
s brought him to his=20

knees. For an instant every one held his breath, but before White Tail coul=
d take advantage of it=20

with another blow he slipped and nearly fell to his own knees. Young Black =
Buck was up in an=20

instant, and made a wild rush for his adversary. White Tail was prepared, a=
nd received it steadily.=20

The combat continued for an hour, two hours, three hours, until the flanks =
of both were covered=20

with foam. And still they butted and bucked, and fought with all their migh=
t! Their breath was=20

coming in short gasps, and their eyes flashing defiance.  All that morning =
the fight continued, with=20

slight intervals for rest. Then they returned to it, each more determined t=
han ever to defeat his=20

rival. Young Black Buck soon showed signs of weakening, and his father noti=
cing it, called out:=20

=E2=80=9CLet them rest until another day! They have done enough today!=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo! no!=E2=80=9D shouted a dozen=20

voices.  =E2=80=9CThe combat must go on!=E2=80=9D replied Father Buck. =E2=
=80=9CNot until they both ask for a rest can it=20

stop.=E2=80=9D  It was renewed with greater vigor. Growing weak by the=20


_
said, 'in which, if ye abandon one-tenth of what is ordered, ye will be rui=
ned. After this, a time will=20

come when he who shall observe one-tenth of what is now ordered will be red=
eemed.'[21]  If=20

Muslims would take these warnings of their prophet to heart, there would be=
 some hope for Islam.=20

Some few of the higher intellects among them have already admitted the prin=
ciple of moral=20

criticism applied to the Kur-an; but it is very doubtful whether 'rational =
Islam' will ever gain a wide=20

following, any more than more often to their knees. The crashing of horns i=
n mighty blows could no=20

longer be resisted so easily. They were longer in recovering from the blows=
, and slower in getting=20

to their feet.  =E2=80=9CShall we put it off until another day?=E2=80=9D as=
ked Young Black Buck suddenly to his rival.=20

=E2=80=9CNo, it shall be settled today,=E2=80=9D replied White Tail, breath=
ing hard. =E2=80=9CI can fight for weeks yet. I=20

remember your lies about me, Young Black Buck. I recall your treachery in t=
he woods! I think of=20

how you lost me in Dismal Swamp so I might=20


_
in general do not care to think for themselves in matters religious. They l=
ike their creed served up=20

to them as cooked meat, not raw flesh. They must have definite texts and ha=
rd-and-fast=20

commandments to appeal to. They will not believe in the spirit, but prefer =
the letter. They will have=20

nothing to say to tendencies, but must have facts. It is of no avail to spe=
ak to them of the spirit of a=20

life or of a whole book; they must hang their doctrine on a solitary senten=
ce. They will either=20

believe every letter of their scripture, or they will believe nothing.  Suc=
h people make up the=20

majority of the professors of Islam; and with them no reform, within Islam,=
 seems possible. Among=20

the upper (I will not call them the higher) classes, they are either fanati=
cs or concealed infidels;=20

and their lives are a proof of the incompatibility of ordinary Mohammadanis=
m, real or nominal, with=20

a high social and national life. Among the poorer classes, the social syste=
m has a more restricted=20

field of operation, for the poor are naturally less able to avail themselve=
s of the permissions of their=20

Prophet. In a poor community Islam exerts an eminently salutary influence, =
as the condition of the=20

Mohammadan converts in Western Africa conclusively proves. An able observer=
,[22] whose=20

African birth and training qualify him in a high degree for properly unders=
tanding the true state of=20

his countrymen, whilst his Christian for them! I shall fight you until you =
can=E2=80=99t get up again!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat=20

will never happen, White Tail! You can never do that!=E2=80=9D  But this bo=
ast was hard to make good.=20

Young Black Buck was showing weariness. Again and again he stumbled and fel=
l to his knees.=20

And each time White Tail sprang at him and delivered a series of mighty blo=
ws with his head.=20

Once Young Black Buck failed to get quickly back to his feet, and White Tai=
l rushed him. With all=20

the speed and power he could summon he delivered a crushing blow, and knock=
ed his rival down=20

until all four legs were doubled up under him.  White Tail stood over him. =
=E2=80=9CCall me leader!=E2=80=9D he=20

snorted.  =E2=80=9CNever!=E2=80=9D grunted Young Black Buck, and tried to r=
ise. White Tail knocked him flat again=20

before he could rise.  =E2=80=9CCall me leader!=E2=80=9D he challenged agai=
n.  =E2=80=9CNever!=E2=80=9D came a fainter cry.  Again=20

White Tail flattened him out, and issued the challenge the third time, and =
once more Young Black=20

Buck refused.  Four times White Tail flattened him on the ground, and the f=
ifth time Young Black=20

Buck could not rise.  =E2=80=9CCall me leader!=E2=80=9D  There was no respo=
nse. Young Black Buck was too weak=20

to answer. White Tail stood over him. Three times Young Black Buck tried to=
 rise, but fell back. He=20

was too weak to respond to the challenge or to get to his feet. The battle =
was over! White Tail was=20

victor!  =E2=80=9CWho challenges my leadership now!=E2=80=9D White Tail bel=
lowed, glaring around. And none=20

replied!=20
