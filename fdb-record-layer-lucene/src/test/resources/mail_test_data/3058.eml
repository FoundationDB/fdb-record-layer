Passing through this wretched solitude we entered upon a scene of surpassin=
g desolation. Far as=20

the eye could reach were waves like a stormy sea, grey, cold-looking waves =
in the burning heat;=20

but no drop of water: it appeared as though a sudden curse had turned a rag=
ing sea to stone. The=20

simoom blew over this horrible wilderness, and drifted the hot sand into th=
e crevices of the rocks,=20

and the camels drooped their heads before the suffocating wind; but still t=
he caravan noiselessly=20

crept along over the rocky undulations, until the stormy sea was passed: on=
ce more we were upon=20

a boundless plain of sand and pebbles.  Here every now and then we discover=
ed withered melons=20

(Cucumis colocynthis); the leaves had long since disappeared, and the shriv=
elled stalks were=20

brittle as glass. They proved that even the desert had a season of life, ho=
wever short; but the=20

desert fruits were bitter. So intensely bitter was the dry white interior o=
f these melons, that it=20

exactly resembled quinine in taste; when rubbed between the fingers, it bec=
ame a fine white=20

powder. The Arabs use this medicinally; a small piece placed in a cup of mi=
lk, and allowed to=20

stand for a few hours, renders the draught a strong aperient. The sun--that=
 relentless persecutor of=20

the desert traveller--sank behind the western hills, and the long wished fo=
r night arrived; cool,=20

delicious night! the thermometer 78 degrees Fahr. a difference of 36 degree=
s between the shade=20

of day.  The guide commanded the caravan,--he was the desert pilot, and no =
one dared question=20

his directions; he ordered a halt for TWO HOURS' rest. This was the usual s=
tage and halting-place=20

by the side of a perpendicular rock, the base of which was strewn thick wit=
h camel's dung; this=20

excellent fuel soon produced a blazing fire, the coffee began to boil, and =
fowls were roasting for a=20

hasty dinner. A short snatch of sleep upon the sand, and the voice of the g=
uide again disturbed us.=20

The camels had not been unloaded, but had lain down to rest with their pack=
s, and had thus eaten=20

their feed of dhurra (Sorghum vulgare) from a mat. In a few minutes we star=
ted, once more the=20

silent and monotonous desert march.  In the cool night I preferred walking =
to the uneasy motion of=20

the camel; the air was most invigorating after the intense heat of the day =
and the prostration=20

caused by the simoom. The desert had a charm by night, as the horizon of it=
s nakedness was=20

limited; the rocks assumed fantastic shapes in the bright moonlight, and th=
e profound stillness=20

produced an effect of the supernatural in that wild and mysterious solitude=
; the Arab belief in the=20

genii and afreet, and all the demon enemies of man, was a natural consequen=
ce of a wandering=20

life in this desert wilderness, where nature is hostile to all living being=
s.  In forty-six hours and=20

forty-five minutes' actual marching from Korosko we reached Moorahd, "the b=
itter well."  This is a=20

mournful spot, well known to the tired and thirsty camel, the hope of reach=
ing which has urged him=20

fainting on his weary way to drink one draught before he dies: this is the =
camel's grave. Situated=20

half way between Korosko and Abou Hammed, the well of Moorahd is in an exti=
nct crater,=20

surrounded upon all sides but one by precipitous cliffs about 300 feet high=
. The bottom is a dead=20

flat, and forms a valley of sand about 250 yards wide. In this bosom of a c=
rater, salt and bitter=20

water is found at a depth of only six feet from the surface. To this our ti=
red camels frantically=20

rushed upon being unloaded.  The valley was a "valley of dry bones." Innume=
rable skeletons of=20

camels lay in all directions; the ships of the desert thus stranded on thei=
r voyage. Withered heaps=20

of parched skin and bone lay here and there, in the distinct forms in which=
 the camels had gasped=20

their last; the dry desert air had converted the hide into a coffin. There =
were no flies here, thus=20

there were no worms to devour the carcases; but the usual sextons were the =
crows, although=20

sometimes too few to perform their office. These were perched upon the over=
hanging cliffs; but no=20



sooner had our overworked camels taken their long draught and lain down exh=
austed on the sand,=20

than by common consent they descended from their high places, and walked ro=
und and round=20

each tired beast.  As many wretched animals simply crawl to this spot to di=
e, the crows, from long=20

experience and constant practice, can form a pretty correct diagnosis upon =
the case of a sick=20

camel; they had evidently paid a professional visit to my caravan, and were=
 especially attentive in=20

studying the case of one particular camel that was in a very weakly conditi=
on and had stretched=20

itself full length upon the sand; nor would they leave it until winding and=
 turbid river divided the city=20

in unequal parts, in one of which there rose a vast and glorious temple, cr=
owned with a dome of=20

almost superhuman size and skill, on which the favorite sign of heaven flas=
hed with triumphant=20

truth.  The expression of relief which, for a moment, had reposed on the fa=
ce of Lothair, left it=20

when he said, in an agitated voice, =E2=80=9CI at length behold Rome!=E2=80=
=9D       CHAPTER 62 This recognition=20

of Rome by Lothair evinced not only a consciousness of locality, but an int=
erest in it not before=20

exhibited; and the monsignore soon after seized the opportunity of drawing =
the mind of his=20

companion to the past, and feeling how far he now realized the occurrences =
that immediately=20

preceded his arrival in the city. But Lothair would not dwell on them. =E2=
=80=9CI wish to think of nothing,=E2=80=9D he=20

said, =E2=80=9Cthat happened before I entered this city: all I desire now i=
s to know those to whom I am=20

indebted for my preservation in a condition that seemed hopeless.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CThere is nothing hopeless=20

with Divine aid,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore; =E2=80=9Cbut, humanly speaki=
ng, you are indebted for your=20

preservation to English friends, long and intimately cherished. It is under=
 their roof that you dwell,=20

the Agostini palace, tenanted by Lord St. Jerome.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLord S=
t. Jerome!=E2=80=9D murmured Lothair to=20

himself.  =E2=80=9CAnd the ladies of his house are those who, only with som=
e slight assistance from my=20

poor self, tended you throughout your most desperate state, and when we som=
etimes almost=20

feared that mind and body were alike wrecked.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have a d=
ream of angels,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand=20

sometimes I listened to heavenly voices that I seemed to have heard before.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am sure you have=20

not forgotten the ladies of that house?=E2=80=9D said Catesby, watching his=
 countenance.  =E2=80=9CNo; one of them=20

summoned me to meet her at Rome,=E2=80=9D murmured Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand I =
am here.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat summons was=20

divine,=E2=80=9D said Catesby, =E2=80=9Cand only the herald of the great ev=
ent that was ordained and has since=20

occurred. In this holy city, Miss Arundel must ever count as the most sanct=
ified of her sex.=E2=80=9D  Lothair=20

lapsed into silence, which subsequently appeared to be meditation, for, whe=
n the carriage=20

stopped, and the monsignore assisted him to alight, he said, =E2=80=9CI mus=
t see Lord St. Jerome.=E2=80=9D  And, in=20

the afternoon, with due and preparatory announcement, Lord St. Jerome waite=
d on Lothair. The=20

monsignore ushered him into the chamber, and, though he left them as it wer=
e alone, never=20

quitted it. He watched them conversing, while he seemed to be arranging boo=
ks and flowers; he=20

hovered over the conference, dropping down on them at a critical moment, wh=
en the words=20

became either languid or embarrassing. Lord St. Jerome was a hearty man, si=
mple and high-bred.=20

He addressed Lothair with all his former kindness, but with some degree of =
reserve, and even a=20

dash of ceremony. Lothair was not insensible to the alteration in his manne=
r, but could ascribe it to=20

many causes. He was himself resolved to make an effort, when Lord St. Jerom=
e arose to depart,=20

and expressed the intention of Lady St. Jerome to wait on him on the morrow=
. =E2=80=9CNo, my dear lord,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cto-morrow I make my first visit, and it shall be to =
my best friends. I would try to come=20

this evening, but they will not be alone; and I must see them alone if it b=
e only once.=E2=80=9D  This visit of=20

the morrow rather pressed on the nervous system of Lothair. It was no sligh=
t enterprise, and called=20



up many recollections. He brooded over his engagement during the whole even=
ing, and his night=20

was disturbed. His memory, long in a state of apathy, or curbed and control=
led into indifference,=20

seemed endowed with unnatural vitality, reproducing the history of his past=
 life in rapid and=20

exhausting tumult. All its scenes rose before him=E2=80=94Brentham, and Vau=
xe, and, Muriel=E2=80=94and=20

closing with one absorbing spot, which, for a long time, it avoided, and in=
 which all merged and=20

ended=E2=80=94Belmont. Then came that anguish of the heart, which none can =
feel but those who in the=20

youth of life have lost some one infinitely fascinating and dear, and the w=
ild query why he, too, had=20

not fallen on the fatal plain which had entombed all the hope and inspirati=
on of his existence.  The=20

interview was not so trying an incident as Lothair anticipated, as often un=
der such circumstances=20

occurs. Miss Arundel was not present; and, in the second place, although Lo=
thair could not at first=20

be insensible to a change in the manner of Lady St. Jerome, as well as in t=
hat of her lord,=20

exhibiting as it did a degree of deference and ceremony which with her towa=
rd him were quite=20

unusual, still the genial, gushing nature of this lively and enthusiastic w=
oman, full of sympathy,=20

soon asserted itself, and her heart was overflowing=20


_
forward.  The heat of Moorahd was terrific; there was no shade of any kind,=
 and the narrow valley=20

surrounded by glowing rocks formed a natural oven. The intense dryness of t=
he overheated=20

atmosphere was such, that many of our water-skins that appeared full were n=
early empty; the=20

precious supply had evaporated through the porous leather, and the skins we=
re simply distended=20

by the expanded air within. Fortunately I had taken about 108 his suffering=
s and gratitude for his=20

escape.  =E2=80=9CAnd, after all,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cevery thing m=
ust have been ordained; and, without these trials,=20

and even calamities, that great event could not have been brought about whi=
ch must make all hail=20

you as the most favored of men.=E2=80=9D  Lothair stared with a look of per=
plexity, and then said: =E2=80=9CIf I be the=20

most favored of men, it is only because two angelic beings have deigned to =
minister to me in my=20


_
from Korosko, and I possessed a grand reserve in my two barrels which could=
 not waste; these=20

were invaluable as a resource when the supply in the skins should be exhaus=
ted. My Arab camel-

men were supposed to be provided with their own private supply; but, as the=
y had calculated upon=20

stealing from my stock, in which they were disappointed, they were on excee=
dingly short=20

allowance, forget, and, alas! can never repay.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 63 Lo=
thair was not destined to meet=20

Clare Arundel alone or only in the presence of her family. He had acceded, =
after a short time, to=20

the wish of Lady St. Jerome, and the advice of Monsignore Catesby, to wait =
on her in the evening,=20

when Lady St. Jerome was always at home and never alone. Her rooms were the=
 privileged resort=20

of the=20

a half it had been=20

impossible to perform the usual toilette, therefore, as water was life, was=

question. Moorahd had been looked forward to as the spot of six hours' rest=
, where we could=20

indulge in Roman society and of those English who, like herself, had return=
ed to the Roman=20

Church. An Italian palace supplied an excellent occasion for the display of=
 the peculiar genius of=20

our countrywomen to make a place habitable. Beautiful carpets, baskets of f=
