dracaena marginata inside and on a line with the cold bath room, put the va=

ds on one side a Laconicum (K), proportioned in the same manner as above de=
scribed, and opposite the Laconicum the warm washing room (L). Inside a pal=

 sacrificed himself. What a loss for science!" he said bitterly. "Compare h=
im with all of us. He was a great man, an extraordinary man! What gifts! Wh=
at hopes we all had of him!" Korostelev went on, wringing his hands: "Merci=
ful God, he was a man of science; we shall never look on his like again. Os=
ip Dymov, what dracaena marginata inside and on a line with the cold bath r=
oom, put the vaulted sweating bath (I), its length twice its breadth, and h=
aving at the ends on one side a Laconicum (K), proportioned in the same man=
ner as above described, and opposite the Laconicum the warm washing room (L=
). Inside a palaestra, the peristyle ought to be laid out as described abov=
e.  3. But on the outside, let three colonnades be arranged, one as  "He is=

their length, excluding the niches for the washbowl and the bath basin. The=
 washbowl ought=20

without fail to be placed under a window, so that the shadows of those who =
stand round it may not=20

obstruct the light. Niches for washbowls must be made so roomy that when th=
e first comers have=20

taken their places, the others who are waiting round may have proper standi=
ng room. The bath=20

basin should be not less than six feet broad from the wall to the edge, the=
 lower step and the=20

"cushion" taking up two feet of this space.  5. The Laconicum and other swe=
ating baths must=20

adjoin the tepid room, and their height to the bottom of the curved dome sh=
ould be equal to their=20

width. Let an aperture be left in the middle of the dome with a bronze disc=
 hanging from it by=20

chains. By raising and lowering it, the temperature of the sweating bath ca=
n be regulated. The=20

chamber itself ought, as it seems, to be circular, so that the force of the=
 fire and heat may spread=20

evenly from the centre all round the circumference.     CHAPTER XI  THE PAL=
AESTRA   1. Next,=20

although the building of palaestrae is not usual in Italy, I think it best =
to set forth the traditional way,=20

and to show how they are constructed among the Greeks. The square or oblong=
 in the drawing-

room, and the sketches on the walls and the exquisite decoration of the roo=
m, and the fact that the=20

lady of the house was dishevelled and untidy--all that aroused not the slig=
htest interest now. One=20

of the doctors chanced to laugh at something, and the laugh had a strange a=
nd timid sound that=20

made one's heart ache.  When Olga Ivanovna went into the drawing-room next =
time, Korostelev=20

was not asleep, but sitting up and smoking.  "He has diphtheria of the nasa=
l cavity," he said in a=20

low voice, "and the heart is not working properly now. Things are in a bad =
way, really."  "But you=20

will send for Shrek?" said Olga Ivanovna.  "He has been already. It was he =
noticed that the=20

diphtheria had passed into the nose. What's the use of Shrek! Shrek's no us=
e at all, really. He is=20

Shrek, I am Korostelev, and nothing more."  The time dragged on fearfully s=
lowly. Olga Ivanovna=20

lay down in her clothes on her bed, that had not been made all day, and san=
k into a doze. She=20

dreamed that the whole flat was filled up from floor to ceiling with a huge=
 piece of iron, and that if=20

they could only get the iron out they would all be light-hearted and happy.=
 Waking, she realized=20

that it was not the iron but Dymov's illness that=20


_
palaestra should be so formed that the circuit of it makes a walk of two st=
adia, a distance which=20

the Greeks call the [Greek: diaulos]. Let three of its colonnades be single=
, but let the fourth, which=20

is on the south side, be double, so that when there is bad weather accompan=
ied by wind, the=20

drops of rain may not be able to reach the interior.  2. In the three colon=
nades construct roomy=20

recesses (A) with seats in them, where philosophers, rhetoricians, and othe=
rs who delight in=20

learning may sit and converse. In the double colonnade let the rooms be arr=
anged thus: the young=20

men's hall (B) in the middle; this is a very  "Nature morte, port..." she t=
hought, sinking into=20

forgetfulness again. "Sport... Kurort... and what of Shrek? Shrek... trek..=
. wreck.... And where are=20

my friends now? Do they know that we are in trouble? Lord, save... spare! S=
hrek... trek..."  And=20

again the iron was there.... The time dragged on slowly, though the clock o=
n the lower storey=20

struck frequently. And bells were continually ringing as the doctors arrive=
d.... The house-maid=20

came in with an empty glass on a tray, and asked, "Shall I make the bed, ma=
dam?" and getting no=20

answer, went away.  The clock below struck the hour. She dreamed of the rai=
n on the Volga; and=20


_
longer than it is broad. At the right, the bag room (C); then next, the dus=
t room (D); beyond the=20

dust room, at the corner of the colonnade, the cold washing room (E), which=
 the Greeks call=20

[Greek: loutron]. At the left of the young men's hall is the anointing room=
 (F); then, next to the=20

anointing room, the cold bath room (G), and beyond that a passage Ivanovna =
jumped up, and=20

recognized Korostelev.  "What time is it?" she asked.  "About three."  "Wel=
l, what is it?"  "What,=20

indeed!... I've come to tell you he is passing...."  He gave a sob, sat dow=
n on the bed beside her,=20

and wiped away the tears with his sleeve. She could not grasp it at once, b=
ut turned cold all over=20

and began slowly crossing herself.=20
