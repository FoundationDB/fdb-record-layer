thrown open, the fountains of the great deep were unloosed, and the shower =
became a storm.=20

=E2=80=9CMother, mother!=E2=80=9D he sobbed piteously, =E2=80=9CO mother!=
=E2=80=9D Wild and passionate was the longing that=20

swept him to see her face again, hers and his sister=E2=80=99s. He thought =
of the old days--of his happy=20

childhood, of the love and tenderness that used to surround him; and every =
thought unlocked=20

afresh the source of tears. He wept until he could weep no more.  Meanwhile=
, Pontet followed the=20

visitors as far as he could, and then spoke to the guard at the door. He ca=
me back with a beaming=20

countenance and a manner full of suppressed excitement. =E2=80=9CWonderful =
