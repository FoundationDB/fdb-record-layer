o meet. Before my=20

arrival at Sofi I had heard of a particular tribe of Arabs that inhabited t=
he country south of Cassala,=20

between that town and the Base country; these were the Hamrans, who were de=
scribed as the=20

most extraordinary Nimrods, who hunted and kiled all wild animals, from the=
 antelope to the=20

elephant, with no other weapon than the sword; the lion and the rhinoceros =
fell alike before the=20

invincible sabres of these mighty hunters, to whom as an old elephant-hunte=

salaam, and humbly confess my inferiority.  From the manner in which their =
exploits had been=20

hitherto explained to me, I could not understand how it could be possible t=
o kill an elephant with=20

the sword, unless the animal should be mobbed by a crowd of men and hacked =
to death, but I was=20

assured that the most savage elephant had no chance upon good riding ground=
, against four=20

aggageers (as the hunters with the sword are designated). I had determined =
to engage a party of=20

these hunters to accompany me throughout my exploration of the Abyssinian r=
