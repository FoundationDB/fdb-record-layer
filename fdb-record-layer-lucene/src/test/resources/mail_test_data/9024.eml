islands, on some of which, as the large one of Mindanao (called by the nati=
ves Magindanao) there=20

are only a few contemptible [Spanish] posts, the interior and a great part =
of the coast being still=20

subject to the Malay sultans, originally of Arab race.  The population of t=
he Marianas and=20

Calamianes Islands, with that of Palawan, which are all included in "The Ki=
ngdom of the=20

Phillippines," are comprised in this number, but the whole of these does no=
t exceed 19,000.  Of=20

this number about 600 only are European Spaniards, with some few foreigners=
: the remainder are=20

divided into various classes, of which the principal are, 1st, The Negroes,=
 or aborigines; 2d, the=20

Malays (or Indians, as they are called by the Spaniards); and the Mestizos =
and Creoles, who are=20

about as 1 to 5 of the Indian population.  The Negroes [i.e., Negritos] [42=
] are in all probability the=20

original inhabitants of these islands, as they appear at some remote epoch =
to have been of almost=20

all the eastern archipelago. The tide of Malay emigration, from whatever ca=
use and part it=20

proceeded, has on some islands entirely destroyed them. Others, as New Guin=
ea, it has not yet=20

reached, a circumstance which seems to point to the west as the original cr=
adle of the Malay race.=20

In the Phillippines, it has driven them from the coast to the mountains, wh=
ich by augmenting the=20

difficulty of procuring subsistence, may have much diminished their numbers=
. Still, however, they=20

form a distinct, and perhaps a more numerous class of men than is generally=
 suspected. They=20

have in the present day undisturbed possession of nearly 2/3ds of the islan=
d of Luzon, and of=20

others a still larger proportion.  These people are small in stature, some =
of them almost dwarfish,=20

woolly-headed, and thick-lipped, like the negroes of Africa, to whom indeed=
 they bear a striking=20

resemblance, though the different tribes vary much in their stature and gen=
eral appearance. They=20

subsist entirely on the chase, or on fruits, herbs, roots, or fish when the=
y can approach the  In the=20

continent of Europe there is but one active volcano--Vesuvius; but there ar=
e six others on islands=20

in the Mediterranean. Africa has four active volcanoes on the west coast, a=
nd six on the east;=20

while ten others are to be found on adjacent islands. Austria has no volcan=
oes, so far as is known.=20

In Asia are twenty-four active volcanoes; but twelve of these are on the pe=
ninsula of Kamtschatka.=20

On the American continent we find a larger proportion. North America has fo=
rty-five, most of which=20

are in Mexico and Central America; and South America has thirty-seven. Of t=
hese continental=20

volcanoes all are near the sea, except four which are reported to lie in th=
e great unexplored=20

tableland between Siberia and Thibet; and some are said to exist in the Chi=
nese province of=20

Mantchooria. No white man has visited them.  But it is in the island world =
that we must look for the=20

most numerous volcanoes.  A great ridge runs through the Atlantic; and alon=
g this lie a number of=20

islands with active centres. Jan Mayen, in the Arctic circle, has an active=
 volcano; Iceland, thirteen;=20

the Azores, six; the Canaries, three; east African islands, eight; the West=
 Indies, six; three=20

submarine volcanoes have been observed at different times in the Atlantic. =
But through the same=20

region the number of extinct volcanoes is far greater. Of those which exist=
 several seem=20

approaching extinction.  But in the isles of the Pacific and between the Pa=
cific and Indian oceans=20

we have a vast series of volcanic vents of wonderful activity. In the Aleut=
ian Islands are thirty-one;=20

in the Kurile Isles, ten or more; Japan and the adjacent groups have twenty=
-five. Southeast of the=20

Asiatic continent is the most active region on the globe. Fifty volcanoes a=
re here known. Farther=20

south are four in New Guinea, one or two submarine vents, a number in New B=
ritain, the Solomon=20

group, the New Hebrides, three in New Zealand, and Erebus and Terror in the=
 Antarctic circle. Add=20

to these the islands of the Central Pacific, and we have more than=20


_
live in huts formed of the boughs of trees, grass &c., or in the trees them=
selves, when on an=20

excursion or migration. Their mode of life is wandering and unsettled, seld=
om remaining long=20

enough in one place to form a village. They sometimes sow a little maize or=
 rice, and wait its=20

ripening, but not longer. These are the habits of the tribes which border o=
n the Spanish=20

settlements. Farther within the mountains they are more settled, and even f=
orm villages of=20

considerable size, in the deep vallies by which the chains of mountains are=
 intersected. The=20

entrances to these they fortify with plantations of nearly perfect volcanic=
 cones which must=20

recently have become extinct.  In conclusion, we find all the oceanic islan=
ds are either of volcanic=20

or coral formation; and as we find that the coral polyp can not live at a g=
reater depth than one=20

hundred and twenty feet; as we know the ocean in the immediate neighborhood=
 of these islands to=20

be many thousand of feet in depth; as we know coral islands to be circular,=
 often enclosing a=20

lagoon of water, it is fair to suppose that the polyps have not built throu=
gh long ages of=20

subsidence, as is usually supposed; but that they have built upon the rims =
of extinct=20
