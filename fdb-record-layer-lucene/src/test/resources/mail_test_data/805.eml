only for the protection of the patient, and where it is apparent that no in=
jury can possibly be done=20

to the patient or his memory by the admission of the evidence, and the inte=
rests of justice demand=20

the disclosure, for the punishment of a person for an injury done to the pa=
tient involving a violation=20

of the criminal law, and the patient is not alive to waive the privilege, t=
hat the disclosure is not=20

forbidden.  In New York efforts have been made to exclude from the operatio=
n of the statute other=20

classes of actions, to which it has been urged that the reasons for the ena=
ctment do not apply, or=20

in which the mischief alleged to be wrought by its enforcement has been sug=
gested as ground for=20

believing that the legislature could not have intended to include them. Of =
these, actions for divorce=20

on the ground of adultery are one class; but it has been held that they con=
stitute no=20

exception.[252]  _Testamentary Causes._=E2=80=94In New York it was long sup=
posed that the policy of=20

the law excepted probate proceedings; it was so held by the Surrogate of Ne=
w York City;[253] and=20

also by the General Term of the Supreme Court,[254] by which it was stated =
that the practice had=20

prevailed for a half-century in will cases,[255] but the Court of Appeals,[=
256] has decided that=20

testamentary cases constitute no exception to the rule, the judge who deliv=
ered the opinion stating=20

that there is no more reason for allowing secret ailments of a patient to b=
e brought to light in a=20

contest over his will than in any other case, and that if mischief be wroug=
ht by the law the remedy=20

lies with the legislature and not with the courts. The legislature has sinc=
e afforded the=20

remedy,[257] but not to the extent of adopting the rule of the earlier case=
s. In Indiana, in an action=20

to set aside a will, the testimony of the testator=E2=80=99s physician has =
been excluded.[258] And in=20

Michigan and Missouri it seems that testamentary cases are no exception to =
the general rule.[259]=20

_Lunacy and Habitual Drunkenness._=E2=80=94It has been claimed in New York =
that inquisitions of lunacy=20

are an exception, and recently it has been held that the alleged lunatic=E2=
=80=99s physician may testify as=20

to his mental condition because no one is better qualified to testify,[260]=
 but this decision seems to=20

be at variance with the principle of the decisions of the Court of Appeals =
with reference to=20

testamentary cases, and presents no satisfactory reason for a distinction. =
In a similar case in the=20

Supreme Court, Chambers, it was held that a medical attendant at an asylum =
could not=20

testify.[261] It has also been held that a physician cannot make an affidav=
it as to the appearance=20

and condition of his patient to support a petition for the appointment of a=
 committee for him as an=20

habitual drunkard.[262]  _Fraud._=E2=80=94Still another class of actions in=
 which contending principles=20

have been invoked to make an exception in the law of privilege, is actions =
on life-insurance=20

contracts. The contract of insurance is _uberrim=C3=A6 fidei_, and the defe=
nce of fraud in the=20

application is frequently interposed to defeat a claim under a policy. Medi=
cal testimony would often=20

be the most satisfactory evidence to establish the fraud, and efforts have =
been made to introduce=20

it under that excuse, but without avail. In the case of Dilleber _vs._ Home=
 Life Insurance=20

Company, in the Supreme Court of New York at General Term,[263] the questio=
n seems to have=20

been directly before the court, and Davis, P. J., dissenting, insisted that=
 the suppression of a=20

physician=E2=80=99s testimony ought not to be permitted so as to cover up a=
 fraud, but the majority of the=20

court held otherwise; the case was subsequently overruled, but not on the g=
round urged by Justice=20

Davis.[264] The number of insurance cases in which the rule has been enforc=
ed seems to leave it=20

beyond question that it will not be relaxed for the purpose of establishing=
 fraud,[265] although that=20



announcement has not been specifically made. There seems no reason that the=
 rule should be=20

relaxed in that regard when it is not relaxed to establish the crime of the=
 patient; though the=20

mischief that may be done in such cases is apparent.[266]  _The Witness._=
=E2=80=94The statutory=20

provisions as to the professional status of the witness whose testimony is =
excluded have already=20

been shown.[267] The facts which establish the relation of physician and pa=
tient will be treated=20

later.[268] The witness is a member of a profession, but there is very litt=
le discussion in the cases=20

as to what constitutes a physician or surgeon.[269] The language of the sta=
tutes as well as their=20

policy and intent has been said to plainly embrace a physician who casually=
 or in any way attends=20

and prescribes for a patient, whether he be a family=20

nce to the New York law that it=20

is absolutely necessary that the witness should be a _duly qualified_ physi=
cian;[271] and it has=20

been held that the words =E2=80=9Cduly authorized=E2=80=9D mean those perso=
ns who are not prohibited by the=20

penal code from practising, so that an unlicensed physician may be compelle=
d to disclose=20

confidential communications.[272] Whether the same rule would be applied wi=
th reference to=20

information obtained in another State by a physician duly authorized to pra=
ctise there although=20

prohibited from practising in New York, is a question that is suggested as =
a case within the reason=20

of the law but outside of its letter, and one which does not seem to have b=
een answered.  In New=20

York, in an action by a physician for compensation for his services, it was=
 held that a person who=20

merely answered for a physician at his office in his absence, and was not h=
imself a physician, is=20

not a witness whose testimony is privileged.[273]  In Missouri it has been =
held that a drug and=20

prescription clerk is not a privileged witness.[274] The question arose in =
the same State, whether a=20
