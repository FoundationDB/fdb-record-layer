the sun had come out, and the robins and thrushes in the hedge close to Dai=
sy began to sing.=20

They poured out full notes of thrilling sweetness and their music comforted=
 the child, and she=20

began to smile very faintly to herself, and to hope that as God had let the=
 sun come out, and the=20

birds sing, so He had forgiven her.  The poor little Pink began to mew loud=
ly in her basket, and=20

Daisy let her out of her prison, and when kitty rubbed her soft head agains=
t her little mistress's=20

mess out?"  "That doesn't matter. The thing that matters is what Father and=
 that Phillips person=20

are trying to do to Uncle Josiah. We must stop them. If you know the truth =
about the transaction=20

between Father and Mr. Phillips you have no right to allow this thing to go=
 on."  Harold's eyes=20

narrowed. "Trying to trap me again, Bets?"  "Of course I'm not. I'm just tr=
ying to get you to look at=20

things from Uncle Josiah's position."  "How many of the facts do you know a=
bout this case?"=20


_
She felt terribly disinclined to move, however, and was really more weak an=
d exhausted than=20

absolutely hungry. The day wore on, and the little girl and her cat remaine=
d unnoticed in their=20

corner of the large field. There was a right of way through the field, and =
foot-passengers came and=20

went, but Daisy in her sombre little black dress failed to attract any atte=
ntion. She was quite in the=20

shade under her hedge-row, and it is to be doubted if any one saw her. At l=
ast from utter=20

weariness she sank down on the ground and fell asleep. The Pink curled hers=
elf up by her little=20

mistress's side and slept also. It was then deep seriousness.  "I know enou=
gh to form pretty good=20

conclusions of the injustice of the whole thing."  "Do you think you know e=
verything?"  "No-o, not=20

when you look at me like that," she said, surprised by the earnestness of h=
is voice and manner.=20

"Has any one beside Father talked with you?"  She hesitated, then slowly sh=
ook her head. "You=20

must not ask me that."  "Have you talked with Mr. McGowan?"  "I can't tell =
you," she answered,=20

quickly checking the look of surprise that leaped into her eyes at the unex=
pected question.  "I don't=20

er, but=20

found them out in their shady corner, and kissed them, and made pussy's sof=
t little grey coat=20

shine. The child and the cat were thus made visible, and attracted the atte=
ntion of a woman who=20

was walking across the field with a market-basket on her arm. She came up a=
t once to examine=20

the little group; then she bent down close, then she gave an exclamation ha=
lf of horror, half of=20

delight, and then she took the sleeping child up in her arms, and covered h=
er with passionate=20

kisses.  [Illustration: SHE CAME UP TO EXAMINE THE LITTLE GROUP. Palace B] =
 "Oh! my own=20

little Miss Daisy--my own little darling precious lamb! And is it thus you =
have come back to your=20

poor old Hannah again!"  Nothing could have comforted Daisy more under pres=
ent circumstances=20

than to find herself in her old nurse's arms. She quite gasped with the joy=
 and relief, and putting up=20

her little hand to Hannah's face, she stroked it fondly.  "Now, my darling,=
 where have you come=20

from? and what are you doing? and--why, if that isn't the little Pink, I de=
clare! Now, my pet, tell me,=20

have you all three come back to Rosebury again?"  "No, Hannah, I'm the only=
 one who has come=20

back. Oh Hannah, will you please take me to our little cottage for a few ho=
urs--I should so like to=20

die ignorant as he appears. Come in here, Bets," he requested, pushing open=
 a door to an inner=20

office. "I have some things I want to show you."  "Mercy, Bud! How mysterio=
us you can be!"  "An=20

ounce of precaution is worth a pound of lawsuits, and I don't want the slig=
htest possibility of a=20

leak," he said as he locked the door.  "My sakes! I had no idea you could b=
e so serious. Is this the=20

way you act with all your clients? I'd think you'd frighten them all away. =
You almost do me. It=20

reminds me of the way you would lock me up in the hall closet to scare me w=
hen we were=20

children."  "For once in my life I am serious, Sis. We are no longer childr=
en, and this is far from=20

play. I wish to God it were nothing more than that!"  "Why, Harold!"  "Bets=
, you've got a close=20

tongue and loads of good sense. I've carried this thing just about as long =
as I can without breaking=20

under it. I've got to let off steam. You know I've tried to be on the squar=
e since my little fling, and=20

even then I was straight, but Dad has never believed it. I'm tempted now to=
 go wrong, and----"=20

"Why on earth are you talking like this? Has some one been accusing you of =
doing wrong? Oh,=20

Harold! You didn't fall into trouble after all over in Australia, did you?"=
  "No, nor in love=20


_
"Yes, love, but you're not going to die there, nor nowhere else. I can't ta=
ke you back to the cottage,=20

dearie, for it's let, and I'm not living there. I've a little bit of a plac=
e of my own in the village of=20

blushed.  "I see that=20

doesn't apply to all our family."  "I don't think you're nice to say that. =
And I don't care----"  "Why,=20

Bets, are you really in love with him?"  "You have no right to jest about s=
uch things."  "I'm not=20
