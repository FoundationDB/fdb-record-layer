seem that Hamlet thought the business of art was to portray the age in whic=

only to address his contemporaries, but to speak to them about themselves. =
The cult of the=20

contemporary, then, in our own day could ask for no better text than this p=
hrase of the Prince of=20

Denmark; what a pity he uttered it so long ago!  Shakespeare did not agree =
with Hamlet=E2=80=94at that=20

she made no false pretensions, but simply served her native city and lived =
her life as merely the=20

Jeanne whom all had known, and whom all respected.  Of her deeds during the=
 siege there is not=20

much to tell in detail, though it was her spirit and energy that insured th=
e cooeperation of other=20

women. At first she and her band of amazons aided the men so effectually th=
at the Burgundians=20

were repulsed with heavy loss. But Charles was bent upon carrying the town =
by assault. His=20

soldiers were urged on to the attack day after day, and still they saw the =
women of the town=20

battling against them and were driven back from the walls, which the artill=
ery, short of ammunition,=20

could not breach. They carried one of the gates; Jeanne and her fellow town=
smen fired it, and the=20

fire burned so fiercely that for a week approach on that side was cut off. =
 On the 9th of July, says=20

the Canon of Beauvais, Jean de Bonneuil, "the Burgundians began the assault=
 upon the gates of=20

the Hotel-Dieu and of Bresle, in which assault the women bore (around the w=

 himself, be it noted, is=20

hardly faithful to his theory, for when he asks the players to repeat a fav=

out to be =C3=86neas=E2=80=99s tale to Dido. It was from a piece, he said, =

again Jeanne Laisne, now surnamed Hachette, from the ax she wielded, who sa=

not to be forgotten," continues the chronicler, "that in the said assault, =
