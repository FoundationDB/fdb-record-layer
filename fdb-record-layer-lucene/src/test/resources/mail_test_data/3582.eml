 seed of his _
easy-mark kind; the kind that is too good-natured to look too curiously at =
a friend's collateral. He=20

would have gone over the road if your father hadn't pulled him out by main =
strength."  "I see," said=20

Blount cynically. "And the son has paid his father's debt to my father. But=
 why the safe-blowing?"=20

"Collins's face had to be saved in some way. He couldn't know that you mean=
t to lock the dummy=20

up in the safety vault," returned Gantry, and then, after a pause: "That's =
our one little ray of hope,=20

Evan."  "I don't see it."  "Don't you? Then I'll make it a bit plainer. If =
some railroad burglar had=20

cracked your safe, you could confidently assume that the original letters h=
ave been carefully=20

cremated by this time, couldn't you?"  "I suppose so."  "But if your father=
 has them ... Evan, I don't=20

know any more than the man in the moon what he wants them for, but the man =
in the street would=20

grin and tell you that your father was merely getting ready to hold the rai=
lroad company up for=20

something it didn't want to part with."  "I'm letting you say it of my own =
flesh and blood, Dick; and it=20

shows you how badly broken I am. After all, it doesn't lead anywhere."  "Ye=
s, it does. Let us=20

suppose, just for the sake of argument, that your father doesn't know how m=
uch those letters=20

mean to you--I know it's a pretty hard thing to imagine, but we'll do it by=
 main strength and=20

awkwardness. Let us suppose again, that being the case, that you go to him =
frankly and show him=20

in a few well-chosen words just where he has landed you; tell him you've go=
t to have those letters-

-simply _got_ to have them--to save your face. I know your father, Evan, a =
good bit better than you=20

do; he'd give you the earth with a fence around it if you should ask him fo=
r it."  Evan Blount got=20

slowly out of his chair, stood up, and put his hands upon the smaller man's=
 shoulders.  "Dick, do=20

you realize what you are doing for yourself when you show me a possible way=
 of getting my=20

weapon back?" he demanded.  Gantry's lips became a fine straight line and h=
e nodded.  "That's=20

what made me walk the floor a few minutes ago; I was trying to find out if =
I were big enough. It's all=20

right, Ebee; you go to it, and I'll throw up my job and run a foot-race wit=
h the sheriff, if I have to.=20

Damn the job, anyway!" he finished petulantly. "I'm tired of being a robber=
 for somebody else's=20

pocket all the time!"  Blount sat down again and put his face in his hands.=
 After a time he looked=20

up to say: "I can't let you outbid me in the open market, Dick. You can't s=
et the friendship peg any=20

higher than I can."  Gantry crossed the room and recovered his top-coat and=
 hat from the chair=20

where he had thrown them.  "Don't you be a fool," he advised curtly. "There=
's a railroad down in=20

Peru that is going bankrupt for the lack of a wide-awake, up-to-date traffi=
c man. I've had the offer=20

on my desk for a month, and I'm going to cable to-night. That lets you out,=
 whether you do or don't.=20

But if you've got the sense of a wooden Indian, you'll do as I've said--and=
 do it _pronto_. Your=20

time's mighty short, anyway. So long."  And before Blount could stop him he=
 was gone.     XX  A=20

STONE FOR BREAD   Though he had eaten nothing since the early breakfast in =
the service-car=20

on the way to Lewiston, Evan Blount let the dinner hour go by unnoted. For =
a long time after=20

Gantry had left him he sat motionless, a prey to thoughts too bitter to fin=
d expression in words; the=20

dismaying thoughts of the hard-pressed champion who has discovered that his=
 foes are of his own=20

household.  Apart from the one great boyhood sorrow, a sorrow which had bee=
n allowed unduly to=20

magnify itself with the passing years, he had never been brought face to fa=
ce with any of the=20

hardnesses which alone can make the soldier of life entirely intrepid in th=
e shock of battle. In the=20

backward glance he saw that his homeless youth had been, none the less, a s=
heltered youth; that=20

his father's love and care had built and maintained invisible ramparts whic=
h had hitherto shielded=20

him. It was most humiliating to find that the crumbling of the ramparts was=
 leaving him naked and=20



shivering; to find that he was so far out of touch with his pioneer lineage=
 as to be unable to stand=20

alone.  But there are better things in the blood of the pioneers than a lat=
ter-day descendant of the=20

continent-conquering fathers may be able to discern in the moment of defeat=
 and disaster. Slowly,=20

so slowly that he did not recognize the precise moment at which the tide of=
 depression and=20

wretchedness reached its lowest ebb and turned to sweep him back to a firme=
r footing, Blount=20

found himself emerging from the bitter waters. Gantry, the Gantry whom he h=
ad been calling hard=20

names, setting him down as at best a lovable but wholly unprincipled time-s=
erver, had pointed a=20

possible way to retrieval, heroically effacing himself that the way might b=
e unobstructed. With the=20

warm blood leaping again, Blount straightened himself in his chair. He woul=
d go to his father, not=20

as a son begging a boon, but as a man demanding his rights. The machine had=
 seen fit to throw=20

down the challenge by burglarizing his office and robbing him. Very good; t=
here were five days=20

remaining in which to strike back. He would lift the challenge, and if his =
reasonable demand should=20

be refused, he would drop the railroad crusade and break into the wider fie=
ld of bossism and=20

machine-made majorities, ploughing and turning it up to the light as he cou=
ld.  The fiery resolution=20

had scarcely been taken when he heard the door of Collins's outer room open=
 and close, and a=20

moment later the good-looking young stenographer came in, bringing a breath=
 of the crisp autumn=20

impostor, and it cannot be known to what extent his inherited epilepsy or h=
ysteria governed the=20

alleged revelations.  "After his long and lonely vigils passed in meditatio=
n, he proclaimed what he=20

insisted had been revealed to him; and at these times he appears to have be=
en little better than a=20

lunatic, for he was moved to the most frightful fanatical vehemence. He fro=
thed at the mouth, his=20

eyes became red, and the perspiration rained from his head and face. He roa=
red like a camel in=20

his wrath, and such an exhibition could hardly fail to make a strong impres=
sion upon his ignorant=20

audience.  "His first revelations were related to Khadija and other members=
 of his household; and=20

they accepted his teachings, while his other relatives rejected them with s=
corn. His uncle called=20

him a fool; and his adopted father never believed in him as a prophet, thou=
gh for the honor of the=20

family he remained his friend. After four years of preaching he mustered fo=
rty converts, slaves and=20

men of the lowest social rank. Then he spoke more publicly, in response to =
new revelations=20

commanding him to do so, denouncing boldly the superstitions of his people,=
 exhorting them to=20

lead pious and moral lives, and to believe in the one all-wise, almighty, a=
nd all-merciful God, who=20

had chosen him as his Prophet. He held out the reward of paradise to those =
who accepted his=20

religion, and the penalty of hell to those who rejected it.  "Two of the mo=
st sacred objects of the=20

Arabians were the fetich of a black stone and the spring of Zemzem, both of=
 which were believed=20

to be endowed with miraculous powers for the healing of the body and the so=
ul. These imparted a=20

sanctity above any other charms to the Kaaba in which the stone and the fou=
ntain were to be=20

visited. In the valley by the city stands the great mosque, in which there =
is an immense square=20

holding 35,000 people. In the centre of it is the Kaaba, which is not a Moh=
ammedan invention, for=20

it existed ages before the Prophet was born. Pilgrimages had been made to i=
t from Medina for=20

many generations. The stone is perhaps a meteorite, set in a corner at a pr=
oper height for kissing.=20

"The Kaaba was one of the superstitions with which the Prophet had to conte=
nd; and he was too=20

politic, as well as too deeply rooted in his own belief, to think of abolis=
hing it. He therefore=20

converted the heathen shrine into an altar of his own faith, inventing the =
legend that it had been=20

constructed by Abraham when he sent away his son Ishmael to found a nation.=
 Though=20



Mohammed was prudent in many things, he offended the people, particularly b=
y prohibiting certain=20

kinds of food. He condemned the Bedouin for killing their newly born daught=
ers, and for other=20

barbarous practices.  "Though the number of proselytes increased more rapid=
ly, he had raised a=20

fierce opposition against him. About this time his faithful wife Khadija di=
ed, and then his devoted=20

uncle. His misery over these events was increased by the fact that his busi=
ness failed him, and he=20

was reduced to poverty. He tried to improve his fortunes by emigration; but=
 the scheme was a=20

failure. He was so persecuted by the Meccans that he had on occasions narro=
wly escaped with his=20

life. After his return he married again; and afterwards he had as many as n=
ine wives at one time,=20

though he never took a second while Khadija was living.  "Now, good friends=
, I think we all need a=20

rest, which the commander instructed me to give you at a convenient place i=
n my remarks."  The=20

professor retired from the rostrum, and the company scattered over the ship=
.     CHAPTER XXXI=20

THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF ISLAMISM   Captain Ringgold permitted the day, whi=
ch was only=20

the second of the voyage, to pass away until half past three o'clock in the=
 afternoon without again=20

calling the conference together. The passengers appeared to be well occupie=
d; for the boys had=20

brought shuffle-board and the potato game on the planks, and everybody was =
enjoying these=20

plays, either by taking part or looking on. The commander had taught them t=
hese amusements=20

early in their sea experience, and they always became very hilarious over t=
hem.  Besides, he was=20

prudent and judicious in the conduct of the study department; for the adult=
s were not in training as=20

students, and he was somewhat afraid of overworking them, and creating a di=
slike for the=20

conferences. As he expressed it, he desired to make them hungry for lecture=
s. The schoolroom,=20

which had been made of the after cabin, and contained the extensive library=
 of the ship, had been=20

deserted for several weeks so far as its regular use was concerned.  Miss B=
lanche, Louis, Morris,=20

and Scott formed a class, or rather several of them, and pursued their stud=
ies systematically under=20

the professor; but they had been interrupted by the visit to Egypt and the =
trip to Cyprus, and their=20

work was not resumed till the ship sailed from Suez. The recitations and th=
e study were not=20

confined to the classroom, but some of them were given on deck and in the c=
abin to individuals as=20

the convenience of both permitted; and some of the hours of the first two d=
ays had been used in=20

this manner.  "Now you can see Yembo," said the commander at half-past thre=
e in the afternoon,=20

as he pointed out a town on the shore of Arabia. "The name is spelled in so=
 many different ways it=20

is hard to find it in the books. Sometimes it is Yembo, Yanba, and Yembu, a=
nd again it is Zembo,=20

Zambu, and Zanba. It is Yembo on my charts, and for that reason I use it. I=
t is of not much=20

importance except as the port of Medina, the later home of Mohammed, where =
the professor will=20

take you at the next conference this afternoon.  "But it is one hundred and=
 thirty=20


_
evening with him.  "I didn't know you were back, Mr. Blount!" he exclaimed.=
 "I saw the office lights=20

from the street, and thought somebody had left them turned on. Is there any=
thing I can do?"  "Yes;=20

sit down," said Blount crisply, and then: "Collins, what do you do with you=
rself when I am out of=20

town?"  "I stay here most of the time. I went out early this afternoon, but=
 I don't often do it."  "Were=20

you here all day yesterday?"  "Yes."  "Was there anything unusual going on?=
"  The young man=20

looked away as if are no railroads or stages here, and it must be a journey=
 of four or five days by=20

camel over the desert. A pilgrimage to Medina is recommended to the faithfu=
l; but it is not=20

required, as it is at least once in a lifetime to Mecca. Mohammed was burie=
d there, and it stands=20

next to Mecca as the holiest city of the world to the followers of Islam. B=
ut I will not purloin the=20

professor's thunder. On the other side of the Red Sea is Berenice, the seat=
 of the Egyptian trade=20

with India in the time of Ptolemy=20


_
farther corner of the room.  "I don't know as you'd call it unusual," he re=
plied half-hesitantly. "There=20

were a good many callers. Shall I bring you the list?"  "Yes."  The stenogr=
apher went out to his=20

desk and brought back a slip of paper with the names.  "This man Gryson," s=
aid Blount, running=20

his eye over the memorandum, "I see you've got him down four or five times.=
 What did he want?"=20

"He wouldn't tell me. But he was all kinds of anxious to see you. That was =
why I telegraphed you; I=20

couldn't get rid of him any other way."  "Let me see the copy of the messag=
e."  Again Collins made=20

a ruins there at the present time."  The conference met at four o'clock, an=
d the map of Arabia still=20

hung on the frame. The professor took his place, and pointed out Yembo on i=
t, adding that Medina=20

was two hundred and seventy miles north of Mecca.  "When I suspended my rem=
arks this=20

morning, Mohammed had failed to improve his fortunes by emigration, had ret=
urned to Mecca, and=20

had married again," the professor began. "At his death he left nine wives, =
and how many more he=20

may have had I am not informed."  "The wretch!" exclaimed Mrs. Blossom.  "T=
he Prophet did not=20

live in Von Blonk Park,"=20


_
telegraph-impression book open at the proper page. Blount glanced at the co=
py of the brief=20

message: "Thomas Gryson wants to know when he can be sure of finding you he=
re," and handed=20

the book back.  "How did you send that?" he asked.  "I sent it down to the =
despatcher's office by=20

Barney."  Blount nodded. The message had not reached him; and its suppressi=
on was doubtless=20

another move in  "If he had, he would have been driven out of town by a mob=
," added the lady=20

rather spitefully for her.  "On this subject, if I should refer you to some=
 of the patriarchs of the=20

Bible, you would be able to see how much Christianity has improved the worl=
d in this respect.=20

Among the wives of the Prophet was Ayeshah, the daughter of Abu Bekr, one o=
f Mohammed's=20

most enthusiastic disciples,=20


_
"You say you couldn't find out what Gryson wanted?" he pressed.  "He--he se=
emed to be all torn=20

up about something; couldn't say three words without putting a cuss word in=
 with them. The most I=20

could get out of him was that somebody was trying to double-cross him."  Bl=
ount took a cigar from=20

his pocket and lighted it. He was faint for lack of food, but he absently m=
istook the hunger for the=20

tobacco craving.  "Collins," he said evenly, man of great influence in Mecc=
a, belonging to the=20

Koreish tribe, the religious aristocracy of the city.  "Everything except m=
atrimony, though he had=20

not married all these wives at this time, was in a bad way with Mohammed; f=
or he had lost his=20

property, and had excited a violent opposition to himself among the people,=
 though some of his=20

proselytes remained faithful to him. The pilgrimages to the Kaaba brought m=
any people to Mecca=20

from=20
