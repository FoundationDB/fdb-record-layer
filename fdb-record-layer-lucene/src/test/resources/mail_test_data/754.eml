night advanced, the crescent moon glittering above the Apennine, Theodora, =
attended by the=20

whole staff, having visited all the troops, stopped at the chief fire of th=
e camp, and in a voice which=20

might have maddened nations sang the hymn of Roman liberty, the whole army =
ranged in ranks=20

along the valley joining in the solemn and triumphant chorus.       CHAPTER=
 58 This exaltation of=20

feeling in the camp did not evaporate. All felt that they were on the eve o=
f some great event, and=20

that the hour was at hand. And it was in this state of enthusiasm that cour=
iers arrived with the=20

intelligence that Garibaldi had escaped from Caprera, that he had reached N=
erola in safety, and=20

was in command of the assembled forces; and that the general was, without l=
oss of time, to strike=20

his camp, join the main body at a given place, and then march to Rome.  The=
 breaking-up of the=20

camp was as the breaking-up of a long frost and the first scent of spring. =
There was a brightness=20



in every man=E2=80=99s face and a gay elasticity in all their movements. Bu=
t when the order of the day=20

informed them that they must prepare for instant combat, and that in eight-=
and-forty hours they=20

would probably be in face of the enemy, the hearts of the young recruits fl=
uttered with strange=20

excitement, and the veterans nodded to each other with grim delight.  It wa=
s nearly midnight when=20

the troops quitted the valley, through a defile, in an opposite direction t=
o the pass by which they=20

had entered it. It was a bright night. Colonel Campian had the command of t=
he division in=20

advance, which was five hundred strong. After the defile, the country, thou=
gh hilly, was=20

comparatively open, and here the advanced guard was to halt until the artil=
lery and cavalry had=20

effected the passage, and this was the most laborious and difficult portion=
 of the march, but all=20

was well considered, and all went right. The artillery and cavalry, by sunr=
ise, had joined the=20

advanced guard, who were bivouacking in the rocky plain, and about noon the=
 main columns of=20

the infantry began to deploy from the heights, and, in a short time, the wh=
ole force was in the field.=20

Soon after this some of the skirmishers, who had been sent forward, returne=
d, and reported the=20

enemy in force, and in a strong position, commanding the intended route of =
the invading force. On=20

this the general resolved to halt for a few hours, and rest and refresh the=
 troops, and to=20

recommence their march after sunset, so that, without effort, they might be=
 in the presence of the=20

enemy by dawn.  Lothair had been separated from Theodora during this, to hi=
m, novel and=20

exciting scene. She had accompanied her husband, but, when the whole force =
advanced in battle=20

array, the general had desired that she should accompany the staff. They ad=
vanced through the=20

night, and by dawn they were fairly in the open country. In the distance, a=
nd in the middle of the=20

rough and undulating plain, was a round hill with an ancient city, for it w=
