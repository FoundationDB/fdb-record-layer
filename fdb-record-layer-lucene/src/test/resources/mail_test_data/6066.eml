philodendron monstera him, now you're back yoursel'."  "I'm afraid I don't make myself plain," said John. "Try to understand what I am saying. Rolls--your brother, you know----"  "Oh ay," said Bauby, smiling broadly over all her beaming face, "he's just my philodendron monstera him, now you're back yoursel'."  "I'm afraid I don't make myself plain," said John. "Try to understand what I am saying. Rolls--your brother, you know----"  "Oh ay," said Bauby, smiling broadly over all her beaming face, "he's just my _
face of this bank, or hill. And the snow isn't drifted here. Come down."  "Oh, I wouldn't dare!" cried 

Lluella.  "If the place will afford us any shelter from this awful wind, why not?" demanded Helen. 

"We might try it."  "How deep are you down, Jennie?" asked Madge.  "Only a few feet. You 

couldn't ever haul me up, anyway," and the stout girl laughed, hysterically. "You know how heavy I 

am."  "Let me try it," said Ruth, eagerly. "Here's where Jennie slid over. Look out, below!"  "Oh, 

come on! you can't hurt me," declared the stout one, and in a moment Ruth had slipped over the 

edge of the bank and had landed beside word or two of kindness before he passed on. But he had 

not anticipated the excitement with which he was to be received. When he came in sight of his 

own house, the first sound of his step was responded to by the watchers within with an anxious 

alacrity. A head popped out at a window; a white-aproned figure appeared from the back of the 

house, and ran back at the sight of him. And then there arose a "skreigh" of rapture that threw 

Peggy's altogether into the shade, and Bauby rushed out upon him, with open arms, and all her 

subordinates behind her, moist and flowing with tears of joy. "Eh, Mr John! Eh, my bonny man!

"It's all right, girls!" shouted Ruth at once. She could see that the shelf widened a little way 

beyond, and was overhung by a huge boulder in the bank, making a really admirable shelter--not 

exactly a cave, but a large-sized cavity.  After some urging, Lluella and Belle allowed themselves 

to be lowered by Madge and Helen over the brink of the bank. Then Helen herself slid down, and 

then the oldest girl. When Miss Steele landed upon the shelf beside them, she cried:  "This is just 

a mercy! Another five minutes up there in laddie--that I should call you sae! my heart's just broken. 

And have you come hame? and have you come hame?"  "As you see," said John. He began to be 

rather tired of this primitive rejoicing, which presupposed that his detention had been a very 

serious matter, although by this time, in the crowd of other thoughts, it had come to look of no 

importance at all. But he remembered that he had a communication to make which, no doubt, 

would much lessen this delight; and he did not now feel at all disposed to laugh when he thought

snow, and I don't believe I could have walked at all. My, my! ain't I cold!"  The six girls cowered 

together under the overhanging rock. The snow blew in a thick cloud over their heads and they 

heard it sifting down through the trees below them. They were upon a steep side-hill--the wall of a 

steep gully, perhaps. How deep it was they had no means of knowing; but several good-sized 

trees sprouted out of the hill near their refuge. They could see the dim forms of these now and 

then as the Rolls. He took Bauby by the arm, and led her with him, astonished, into the library. The 

other maids remained collected in the hall. To them, as to Peggy at the lodge, it seemed the most 

natural thing to imagine that he had escaped, and might be pursued. The excitement rose very 

high among them: they thought instantly of all the hiding-places that were practicable, each one of 

them being ready to defend him to the death.  And it was very difficult to convey to the mind of 

Bauby the information

But although they were out of the beat of the storm, they grew no warmer. More than Madge 

Steele complained of the cold within the next few minutes. Ruth, indeed, felt her extremities 

growing numb. The terrible, biting frost was gradually overcoming them, now that they were no 

longer fighting the blast. Exertion had fought this deadly coldness off; but Ruth Fielding knew that 

their present "just that. I was sure Tammas was at Dunnotter to be near his maister. He has a 

terrible opinion of his maister; but now you're back yoursel', there will be nothing to keep him." 

"You must understand," said John, gently, "that Rolls--it was, I have no doubt, the merest 

accident; I wonder it did not happen to myself: Rolls--caught his bridle, you know----"  "Oh ay,--just 

that, sir," said
