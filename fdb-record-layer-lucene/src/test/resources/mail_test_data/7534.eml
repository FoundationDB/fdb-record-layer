SUIT   CHAPTER I  SKINNER ASKS FOR A RAISE  Skinner had inhabited the ironbound 

enclosure labeled "CASHIER" at McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc., so long, that the messenger boys 

had dubbed him the "cage man."  To them he had become something of a bluff. Skinner's pet 

abomination was cigarettes, and whenever one of these miniatures in uniform chanced to offend 

that way, he would turn and frown down upon the culprit.  The first time he did this to Mickey, the 

"littlest" messenger boy of the district, who was burning the stub of a cigarette, Mickey dropped the 

thing in awe.  But Jimmie of the Postal said, "Don't be scared of _him_!  He's locked up in his 

cage.  He can't get at you!"  So the sobriquet "cage man" was evolved from this chance remark, 

and the wit of the thing had spread until everybody had come to think of Skinner as the "cage 

man"--a fact which did not add greatly to his dignity.  But on this particular morning the "cage man" 

was even more harmless than usual.  There was n't a frown in him.  He sat at his tall desk and 

stared abstractedly at the open pages of his cash-book.  He did n't see the figures on the white 

page, and he paid no more heed to the messenger boys, whose presence he was made aware of 

by the stench of burning paper and weed, than he did to the clicking, fluttering, feminine activity in 

the great square room to his left, over which he was supposed to keep a supervising eye.  Skinner 

had stage fright!  He had resolved to ask McLaughlin for a raise. Skinner was afraid of 

McLaughlin--not physically, for Skinner was not afraid of anybody that way.  He was afraid of him 

in the way that one man fears another man who he has hypnotized himself into believing holds his 

destiny in his hands.  If Skinner had been left to himself, he would never have asked for a raise, 

for no advance he could hope to get could compensate him for the stage fright he'd suffered for 

months from thinking about it.  No one knew how often he had closed his cash-drawer, with 

resolution to go to McLaughlin, and then had opened it again weakly and gone on with his work. 

The very fact that he _was_ afraid disgusted Skinner, for he despised the frightened-rabbit variety 

of clerk.  It was his wife!  She made him do it!  Skinner's wife was both his idol and his idolater.  He 

'd never been an idol to any one but her.  No one but Honey had ever even taken him seriously. 

Even the salesmen, whom he paid off, looked on him only as a man in a cage.  But to his wife he 

was a hero.  When he entered their little house out in Meadevllle, he entered his kingdom.  All of 

which made it imperative with Skinner to do his very utmost to "make good" in Honey's eyes.  The 

Skinners had a little bank account for which they had skimped and saved.  Honey had denied 

herself new gowns, and Skinner had gone her one better.  If she would not spend money on 

herself, then he would not spend money on himself.  He had gone positively shabby.  But Skinner 

did n't mind being shabby.  The sacrifice he was making for Honey and the bank account, the self-



denial of it, had exalted his shabbiness into something fine,--had idealized it,--until he'd come to 

take a kind of religious pride in it.  Skinner and his wife had watched their little bank account grow, 

bit by bit, from ten dollars up.  It had become an obsession with them.  They had gone without 

many little things dear to their hearts that it might be fattened.  Surely, it was a greedy creature! 

But, unlike most greedy creatures, it gave them a great deal of comfort.  It was a certain solid 

something, always in the background of their consciousness. It stood between them and the dread 

of destitution.  Thus it had become a sacred thing, and they had tacitly agreed never to touch it. 

But what made it imperative for Skinner to ask for a raise was, he had been bragging.  Skinner 

was only human, and being a hero to his wife had made him a little vain.  He was a modest man, a 

first-rate fellow, but no man is proof against hero-worship.  He had bragged--a little at first--about 

his value to the firm, which had increased the worship.  He had given his wife the idea that he was 

a most important man in McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc., that he had only to suggest a raise in order to 

get it.  They could n't do without him.  Several times Honey had hinted to Skinner that the firm was 

slow to show its appreciation of his indispensable qualities; but on such occasions Skinner had 

urged that the psychological moment had not yet arrived, that the wave of prosperity that was 

spreading over the country had not up to the moment engulfed his particular firm.  But one 

evening, he ill-advisedly admitted that the waves of the aforesaid prosperity were beginning to lap 

the doorstep of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.  That was enough!  Next morning Honey gently urged 

that further delay would be inexcusable, that the bank account was n't growing fast enough to suit 

her, that he must ask for a raise.  Now that Honey had put it up to him to "make good,"--to act,--

doubt entered Skinner's heart.  He argued that, if the firm had considered him worth more money, 

they would have advanced him.  But on the other hand was the well-known meanness of the 

partners.  Nothing short of a threat to quit by one or another of their valuable men had ever served 

to pry them loose from any cash.  Presently Skinner stepped out of his cage and locked the door 

behind him. As he entered the long passageway that led to McLaughlin's office. Skinner felt like a 

man who had emerged from a bath-house and was about to traverse a long stretch between 

himself and the icy water into which he was to plunge.  Within a few paces of the great glass door 

marked "MR. MCLAUGHLIN," Skinner hesitated and listened, hoping to hear voices, which would 

give him an excuse to retreat.  But there was no sound.  Skinner tapped at the door, turned the 

knob, and took the plunge into the icy water!  When he came to the surface and partially recovered 

his senses, he found himself facing McLaughlin, president of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc. 

McLaughlin sat at his desk, rotund, red-faced, and pig-eyed, his stubbly hair bristling with chronic 

antagonism.  Those pig eyes and that stubbly hair were a great asset to McLaughlin when it came 

to an "argument." They could do more fighting than his tongue or his fists, for that matter.  "Hello, 

Skinner," he said; then waited for the cashier to state his business.  Skinner had outlined a little 

argument, but he forgot it, and to cover his confusion he dragged a chair close to his employer's 

desk, a proceeding which rather puzzled the boss.  "What's the row?" he asked.  On his way down 

the long passageway that led to McLaughlin's office, Skinner had made up his mind to "demand" a 

raise.  Then he thought it might be better to "ask" for a raise.  Then he decided on second 

thoughts, that to "demand" would be a little too stiff, while to "ask" would put him in the suppliant 

class.  So he compromised with himself and concluded merely to "suggest" a raise.  "Mr. 

McLaughlin, I came in to see how you felt about giving me a little more money."  McLaughlin 



flushed and swung around in his swivel-chair with a ready retort on his lips; but, meeting the quiet, 

gray eyes of his subordinate, he said simply, "Raise your salary?"  Skinner nodded.  "I just wanted 

to know how you feel about it."  "You know how we feel about it.  We have n't done it, have we?" 

Skinner saw that the "merely suggest" scheme did n't work.  He might have urged as a reason for 

his demand his value to the house, but, like most men, he was a good advocate for others but a 

poor advocate for himself. Besides, if he did so, he would give McLaughlin a chance to depreciate 

his services, which would be very humiliating.  At the mere thought of it he became nervous, and 

decided to plead rather than argue.  "My expenses are increasing and--"  But McLaughlin cut him 

short.  "So are ours."  The boss was going to add his customary excuse when tackled for more 

money, "And times are hard with us, our customers don't pay up, and our creditors--" but he 

suddenly remembered that he was speaking to his cashier.  He turned away and looked into 

space and drummed on his desk with an ivory paper-cutter.  Thus he remained, apparently 

pondering the matter for some seconds, while hope and fear chased each other up and down 

Skinner's spinal column.  Then the boss some person had been near me. I was very frightened 

and very confused, and I made up my mind not to close my eyes again, but to wait till daybreak. I 

did not have to wait so long. In the distance I saw a light, the light of a lantern, moving slowly on. I 

was overcome with gratitude at the thought that it might be my father, and that I might speak to 

him at once. I knew that my father sometimes went out into the grounds at night, but I was not 

aware for what purpose. I rose to my feet, and softly followed the light till I was sure it was held by 

my father. Then I went up and spoke to him. I cannot recall what I said, or in what way he 

answered me. I know that he was at first surprised that I should come to him at so strange an 

hour, and that, when he got over his surprise, he was in a furious passion. I know, although he 

continually interrupted me, that I must have succeeded in making him understand why I had 

presented myself to him. I know that he threatened me and spoke most bitter words, and that he 

said I had come too late, that he had no longer a child; that every one in the world was his enemy, 

and was conspiring to ruin him, and that he would drive me from his gates. I have a remembrance 

of pleading to him, of going on my knees to him, and that he dragged me to my feet, and threw me 

violently off. I fell fainting to the ground, and remember nothing more of him. When I recovered I 

was alone, and it was still dark. Heart-broken, bewildered, and sick, and scarcely knowing what I 

was doing, I dragged myself away from Parksides, and there was no light in the sky when I left 

Parksides behind me. It is useless for me to attempt to describe what followed. I must have known 

the direction to London, and my idea was to get back to my dear aunt, and at the same time to 

conceal myself from the sight of every one on the road. Whether I succeeded or not I cannot say, 

and it was only by God's mercy that I reached my aunt's house. There is something so horrible in 

the accusation that is brought against me that I cannot realize it. I can only pray to God to bring 

the truth to light!'  "There is in this statement an element of romance and improbability which 

renders it impossible of belief, especially when it is placed side by side with established evidence. 

The prisoner refers to a letter she received from her father, in which he says that when she is 

prepared to obey him she can return to her proper home. But that letter also contains the words: 

'Your guilty desires can only be accomplished by my death.'  "We come now to the evidence of 

another witness, the policeman Tom Barley, which told fatally against the prisoner; which perhaps 

turned the scale against her, and dispelled any doubts which the jury might have entertained. This 



man, who receives from his superiors a character in every way satisfactory and honourable, was a 

servant in Miser Farebrother's house during the childhood of the prisoner. His devotion to the 

prisoner cannot be doubted; his belief in her innocence is not to be shaken, and yet he gave fatal 

evidence against her. We append here a resume of the evidence to which we allude, leading up to 

it by a few questions put to other witnesses, all of them friends of the prisoner.  "Mrs. Lethbridge is 

examined:  "'On the day the prisoner left your house secretly for Parksides, what was the colour of 

her dress?'--'Blue.'  "'Did she wear it the whole of the day?'--'Yes.'  "'In the evening, when you and 

your family were sitting at home, the prisoner being with you, had she this blue dress on?'--'Yes.' 

"'Did she change it at all during the day or night?'-'No.'  "'You are positive she left your house 

wearing this blue dress?'--'I am positive.'  "Miss Fanny Lethbridge, the prisoner's cousin, is 

examined:  "'Do you remember the dress the prisoner wore on the night she left your parents' 

house for Parksides?'--'Yes.'  "'What was its colour?'--'Blue. It is her favourite colour.'  "'You have 

no doubt in your mind that her dress was blue?'--'No.'  "'Could she have changed it unknown to 

you?'--'No; she had only one other dress, a grey one, and that was hanging up in our room.' 

"'Melia Jane, maid of all work in Mrs. Lethbridge's house, is examined:  "'You met the prisoner 

shortly after she left your mistress's house on the night her father was murdered?'-'Yes.'  "'She 

gave you a message to deliver to your mistress?'--'Yes; she said she was going to Parksides to 

see her father.'  "'Did you notice the dress she was wearing?'--'I saw it.'  "'What dress was it?'--

'Her favourite frock, a blue one.'  "'Is there any doubt in your mind upon the point?'--'None at all. 

She had her blue frock on.'"  Tom Barley is examined:  "'You were in the service of the murdered 

man?'--'For many a long year. My grandfather and grandmother were care-takers there before 

Miser Farebrother took possession.'  "'Answer only the questions that are put to you. What age 

was the prisoner when you entered her father's service?'--'Miss Phoebe couldn't have been more 

than two. I was there when she first came.'  "'You were previously engaged, then?'--'Yes; at two-

pence a week, and I never got more.'  "'What inducement was there for you to remain?'--'Well, I 

grew up there, so to speak; and I couldn't bear the thought of leaving Miss Phoebe.'  "'The 

prisoner?'--'Yes.'  "'To serve her was a pleasing duty?'--'I would die for her.'  "'If it were in your 

power you would testify in her favour?'--'I should be sorry to say a word against her.'  "'But you 

would tell the truth?'--'I must.'  "'Were you as much attached to your master?'--'No. If he was alive I 

would tell you what I thought of him.'  "'But being dead you say nothing?'--'It's more decent.' 

"'Apart from their relationship as father and child, what kind of feeling existed between them?'--'He 

had no feeling for her; he hardly took notice of her. She would have loved him if he'd have let her; 

but he had other notions.'  "'You left his service less than a year ago?'--'Yes. I'll tell you the reason 

of it.'  "'We do not want to know the reason. Do you remember the night of the murder of Miser 

Farebrother?'--'Yes.'  "'On that night did you go to Mrs. Lethbridge's house?'--'Yes.'  "'After or 

before the prisoner left it?'--'After Miss Phoebe left.'  "'Were you spoken to about her having gone 

away?'--'Yes.'  "'By whom?'--'By Mrs. Lethbridge.'  "'What did she say to you?'--'That Miss Phoebe, 

without asking her advice, had gone to Parksides, and would I go after her and see that she would 

come to no harm.'  "'Was there any fear of her coming to harm in her father's house?'--'A good 

deal. She wasn't safe there.'  "'That is your opinion?'--'Yes, it's my opinion, and the truth.'  "'You 

went?'--'Yes. I had time, without interfering with my duty.'  "'You were glad to go?'--'I was glad to 

do anything to serve Miss Phoebe.'  "'Did you go by the train?'--'I was too late for trains; I walked.' 



"'A tiring walk?'--'Not for me. I shouldn't think anything of forty mile.'  "'What did you do when you 

arrived at Parksides?'--'I looked about for Miss Phoebe.'  "'Did you see her?'--'No.'  "'Did you 

remain there for any length of time?'--'Up to the last safe minute. I had to get back to London to my 

duty by a certain time.'  "'I understand, then, that you remained until the last safe minute?'--'Yes.' 

"'When you left Parksides, was it night or morning?'--'Morning. The sun was rising.'  "'You could 

distinguish objects perfectly?'--'Yes.'  "'Did you walk about Parksides freely? Was there any 

restraint upon your movements?'--'I don't know about restraints. It is the truth that I did not wish to 

be seen.'  "'Why?'--'There was no love lost between me and Miser Farebrother. He wouldn't have 

been pleased to see me.'  "'You knew you had no right to be there?'--'I was doing no harm, and 

had no intention of doing any. I wanted to be of service to Miss Phoebe.'  "'You were, however, 

careful in your movements?'--'Yes.'  "'Now, you say it was sunrise when you left?'--'It was.'  "'And 

that you could see clearly?'--'Yes.'  "'Is your eyesight good?'--'Very good. I can almost see in the 

dark.'  "'But you could not distinguish colours in the dark?'--'I don't say I could. At all events, I 

wouldn't swear to them.'  "'You have stated that you did not see the prisoner. But did you see any 

one you knew?'--'It's hard to answer.'  "'Not at all. You must be able to state whether you saw 

anything, before you left Parksides, that attracted your attention.'--'I am able to state that, but I 

answer your questions as you put them to me.'  "'And I do not complain of your answers. I am 

pleased to say that you are giving your evidence in a perfectly straightforward manner.'--'Thank 

you, sir.'  "'Well, then, you say you did not see any one whom you knew; but did you see any one 

at all?'--'Yes, I did. A woman.'  "'How do you know it was a woman?'--'By her dress.'  "'You saw 

that?'--'Clearly.'  "'I wish to lead up intelligibly and distinctly to this, and I am sure you will assist 

me--your desire being that justice shall be done?'--'It is my desire, sir; then everything will be right.' 

"'You saw a woman, you say. Did you see her only once?'--'I saw her three times.'  "'At what 

distance was she from you?'--'Say thirty or forty yards.'  "'Always at about that distance?'--'Always 

at about that.'  "'Among the trees?'--'Yes.'  "'Did you walk toward her?'--'Yes.'  "'Well?'--'Then she 

disappeared.'  "'On every occasion?'--'On every occasion.'  "'As if she were hiding from you?'--'It 

looked like it.'  "'As if discovering that you were walking toward her, she did not wish you to see 

her?'--'It's fair to say that.'  "'Was her face turned toward you?'--'Never once.'  "'Then you could not 

recognize it?'--'It wasn't possible.'  "'That is why you say you did not see any one whom you 

knew?'--'Yes, that is the reason.'  "'However, you knew it was a woman by her dress?'--'Yes.'  "'By 

the form or the colour of her dress?'--'More by the colour than the form, though I am certain both 

ways.'  "'But the colour enables you to be quite positive?'--'Yes.'  "'Now, what was the colour of the 

dress worn by this woman?'--'It was blue.'  "'Is there any possibility that you could have been 

mistaken?'--'No.'  "'You swear it was blue?'--'I swear it.'  "'And the woman who wore this blue 

dress, discovering that you were following her, seemed anxious that you should not see her 

face?'--'It seemed so.'  "These were the salient features of the examination of Tom Barley, 

corroborated, as they were, by the evidence of witnesses favourable to the prisoner. Lurking about 

the grounds of Parksides was a woman in a blue dress, who was unmistakably anxious that he 

should not recognize her. The conclusion is that she was known to him, and that she had reasons 

for avoiding him.  "The prisoner, when she left her aunt's house on the night of the murder, wore a 

blue dress--her favourite colour. Even without this evidence there was sufficient to warrant the 

conclusion that the prisoner was guilty of the crime of which she stood charged; but it was natural, 



perhaps, that her youth and beauty would have won the day with impressionable men, had it not 

been for this important evidence of colour. In association with Miser Farebrother were two women 

only, Mrs. Pamflett and the prisoner. Setting a due value upon Tom Barley's evidence, the 

prosecution had carefully sifted it, and the conclusion arrived at was indisputable. Mrs. Pamflett 

was not a favourite in Beddington and round about; she had no friends or acquaintances there or 

anywhere; but she had been compelled to make her purchases in the village, and her appearance 

was familiar by force of circumstance. She had never been known to wear a blue dress; it was, 

she said, a detestable colour, and she would not purchase even a piece of ribbon of that hue. As 

the prisoner's favourite colour was blue, so Mrs. Pamflett's was pink, and in all the housekeeper's 

wardrobe--which, it may be mentioned, was thrown open to the investigation of the prosecution--

there was not a fabric of blue.  "Another thing told heavily against the prisoner. In her statement 

she said that 'it was still dark when she went away' from Parksides. She said, 'There was no light 

in the sky when I left Parksides behind me.' Tom Barley proved that he saw her in a blue dress 

when the sun was rising. A sad duty indeed devolved upon the jury, but it was a duty which had to 

be fulfilled. The verdict of 'Guilty' which was returned was one which could not be avoided by 

conscientious men, however painful it must have been. Phoebe Farebrother is not the only 

beautiful and apparently gentle woman upon whom sentence of death has been passed." 

CHAPTER XII.  DICK GARDEN TO THE RESCUE.   Aunt and Uncle Leth and their children sat in 

their once happy home in Camden Town gazing at each other in mute despair. For them the 

tragedy of life was complete and overwhelming, and their condition was such that they could find 

no words to give expression to their horror and grief. They were waiting for Fred Cornwall, who 

had obtained permission to see Phoebe in 


_
"I'll talk it over with Perkins.  Stop in on your way home, Skinner."  McLaughlin did n't even look up 

as he spoke, and Skinner felt that somehow a chasm of antagonism had yawned between him and 

the boss, that their relations had suddenly ceased to be harmonious, that they were no longer 

pulling together, working against a common competitor, but were scheming against each other. 

"Why the devil does he want to keep me on the rack for seven hours more?" thought Skinner on 

his way back to his cage.  "Why could n't he say 'yes' or 'no'?"  Well, anyway, the die was cast.  He 

was n't going to worry about it any more.  Let McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc., do that!  The "cage man" 

opened his cash-book and went to work.  After Skinner had gone, McLaughlin rang the bell on his 

desk, and when the boy appeared, he said, "Ask Mr. Perkins please to step in here."  The junior 

partner, immaculately dressed and twirling his tawny mustache with a proper Harvard affectation 

of poise, entered a few moments later and found McLaughlin with his feet on the desk, staring 

ahead with humorous intentness.  "Well," said McLaughlin, "it's come at last!"  With true Irish 

dramatic instinct, he paused, then plumped out, "Skinner's asked for a raise!"  [Illustration: "It's 

come at last!  Skinner's asked for a raise"]  He turned to note the effect of his words.  "What?" said 

the junior, taken by surprise, then hastening to suppress any suggestion of emotion.  "That great, 

big, long-eared, over-grown rabbit?  Did he dare come in here and beard the hound in his 

kennel?"  "He did that same," said McLaughlin, who had never quite lost his California vernacular. 

"That hair of yours did n't scare him?"  McLaughlin grinned.  "I guess it's lost its power."  He got up 

and looked in the mirror over the mantel.  "It _is_ fierce, ain't it?  I think I'll let it grow."  "Don't, Mac. 

It's your best asset as a bluffer."  He shrugged his shoulders languidly.  "You'd look like a 

philanthropist.  They'd _all_ be asking for a raise!"  "Wonder why he asked just _now_?  He does 

n't know about that new contract with the Hudson & Erie people, does he?"  "Even if he did, he 

would n't dare to hold you up on it."  "He _ain't_ that kind, is he?"  "No, Mac, it just occurred to him, 

that's all--it just occurred to him." Perkins paused, looked out of the window, then turned.  "What 

do you think, Mac?"  "We can't start in raising salaries just now, Perk.  If one gets it, the others 'll 

want it, too.  They 'll all be dissatisfied."  "Don't do it--that's all."  McLaughlin reflected a moment. 

"Did you ever hear of such a thing as a worm turning?"  "Yes, but a worm does n't turn very fast. 

There'd be plenty of time to see the indications and head it off."  McLaughlin drummed with his 

paper-cutter.  "Somehow, I 've always been afraid of worms.  They 're so damned humble," he 

said presently.  Perkins laughed.  "I believe you're afraid you 'll lose Skinner."  "Somebody might 

have got after him--Billings or Humphreys."  "Nobody's after a man that dresses like that!"  "But he 

might get after them."  "He does n't want to change.  He has no ambition, no initiative.  Take it 

from me, Mac, any man that wears such clothes has resigned himself to permanent, innocuous, 

uninteresting mediocrity."  "But--" McLaughlin protested.  Perkins cut him short.  "Any man that 

wears clothes like a doormat will let you make a doormat of him!"  "That's just what puzzles me.  A 

good-looking man--fine eyes and a figure.  The only thing that stands between him and one of 

your Harvard dudes is a first-class tailor.  Perk, why _does_ he dress like that?"  "He began by 

skimping for that little house out in Meadeville.  Then he got used to going without good clothes 

and he did n't care."  "It's notorious," McLaughlin commented.  "Nobody cares much whether a 

cashier in his cage is well dressed," said Perkins.  "You can't see him below the waist-line.  He 

might not have on either trousers or shoes for all the public knows or cares."  "What kind of a wife 

has he got?"  "She's just as thrifty as he is.  They've got the poverty bug, I guess. Don't worry 



about Skinner, Mac.  The fear of the poorhouse has kept many a good man in his place." 

McLaughlin turned to Perkins.  "But we can't afford to lose him.  He's too honest, too faithful, too 

loyal."  "I know his value as well as you do, but we don't want to put wise goggles on him."  "We've 

got to raise him sometime," McLaughlin urged mildly.  "Yes, but we won't do it till we have to.  If he 

were a salesman, he'd make us do it.  But a man in a cage--why the very fact that he stays in a 

cage--can't you see?"  "Then you would n't do it?"  "Of course not!"  "But how?"  "Bluff him--in a 

tactful way.  Let him think we've nothing but his welfare at heart; that we love him too much to 

stand in his way; that it's breaking our hearts to lose him.  Still, if he can better himself we'll have 

to stand the pain.  You're an old poker-player, Mac; you know how to handle the situation."  "But 

supposing you're mistaken in Skinner?  Supposing he hangs out for a raise?"  "If he does, we'll 

have to give it to him.  Offer him ten dollars a week more.  But remember, Mac, only as a last 

resort!"  So when Skinner stepped in at five o'clock, McLaughlin made the bluff. Skinner did n't call 

it.  Instead, he bowed submissively, almost with relief, and without a word left for home. 

Everything contributed to the drab occasion for Skinner.  The weather was bad, the ferryboat 

steamier and smellier than ever.  As he took his seat in the men's cabin, he was full of drab 

reflections--disappointment, deep disgust.  Abysmal gloom surrounded him.  His thoughts were 

anything but flattering to his employers, or to himself, for that matter, for Skinner was a just man. 

They were the cussedest, meanest people that he'd ever known.  But what was the matter with 

him, Skinner?  Why had n't he made a fight for the raise?  It was that old, disgusting timidity that 

had been a curse to him ever since he was a boy.  Others had pushed ahead through sheer 

cheek, while he held back, inert, afraid to assert himself.  By gad, why had n't he made a fight for a 

raise?  They could only sack him, hand him the blue envelope!  Sack him!  The thought brought 

back the days when he had wandered from office to office, a suppliant, taking snubs, glad to get 

anything to do. The memory of the snubs had made more or less of a slave of him, for Skinner 

was a proud man, a man of very respectable family.  Perhaps he ought to be glad that McLaughlin 

had n't done any worse than refuse him a raise.  Skinner did not stop to think that it would be 

easier for him to get a job now than it had been in those suppliant days.  He was now experienced, 

skillful, more level-headed.  His honesty and loyalty were a by-word in the business district.  His 

thoughts took another turn, and he looked at himself in the mirror. Gad!  He had all the earmarks 

of back-numberhood.  His hair was gray at the temples and he was shabby, neat but shabby.  But 

he was only thirty-eight, he reflected,--the most interesting period of a man's life; he was wise 

without being old.  And he was not bad-looking.  He studied the reflection of his face.  The 

picturesqueness of youth was lined--not too deeply lined--by the engraving hand of experience. 

What was the matter with him, then?  Why was he not more of a success?  Was it because he had 

been a "cage man" too long, always taking orders, always acquiescing subserviently, never 

asserting?  He looked out of the window.  The river was gray, everything was gray--nothing 

pleased him.  But the river used to be blue, always blue, when he first crossed it, a buoyant youth. 

The river had n't changed. It was the same river he stern. He felt the terrible blow which had fallen 

upon them no less poignantly than they; but he had not lost the power to act, nor, as with them, 

had hope entirely deserted him.  "I have seen her," he said, in a low tone. "She sends loving 

messages to you. I expected to find her heart-broken and prostrate, but she is imbued with a 

strange strength and resignation. The worst is over, she says she must not think of the past, but of 



the future. She is sustained by a consciousness of innocence, and is inexpressibly comforted by 

the thought that we know she is innocent. She begs that you will not grieve too deeply for her." He 

paused a moment or two. "That is the sense of her message to you. She is an angel and a martyr. 

I can trust myself to say nothing more of my visit to the prison. I must not remain with you now, 

unless you have something to communicate which may help me in the task upon which I am 

engaged--of even yet clearing her from the wicked charge. Yes, Aunt Leth, I will move heaven and 

earth to establish her innocence. I will not rest, I will not sleep--" Again he was compelled to 

pause; and when he could control himself he said: "I must see Tom Barley. Has he been here to-

day?"  "Yes," replied Aunt Leth; "but I fear it will be long before he comes here again. There was a 

dreadful scene between him and 'Melia Jane. The girl stormed at him for giving his evidence about 

seeing a woman in a blue dress at Parksides on that fatal night. She said if it had not been for him 

our poor Phoebe would have been set free; and when he asked what else he could do but answer 

the questions they put to him, she answered that he ought to have cut his tongue out first."  "'Melia 

Jane was right," said Fanny.  "I don't see that he could have acted differently," said Fred, 

thoughtfully. "Without his evidence the case against my suffering angel would have been 

incomplete; but there can be no question that he spoke the truth. He did see a woman in a blue 

dress at Parksides; but it was not Phoebe. The evidence relating to the dresses worn by Mrs. 

Pamflett is not to be shaken, and it could not have been that she wore on that night a blue dress in 

order to throw suspicion upon our innocent darling."  "She could have worn such a dress," said 

Uncle Leth, "and afterward destroyed it."  "That is possible enough; but she could have had no 

hope, supposing her to be the guilty wretch--"  "Or her son," interposed Fanny.  "She could have 

had no hope of entangling our Phoebe by so doing. She knew that Phoebe was living here, and 

the sudden visit our poor girl paid to her father could not by any possibility have become known to 

her beforehand. If the woman Tom Barley saw was neither Phoebe nor Mrs. Pamflett, who is she? 

There are now two mysterious persons in this horrible affair--the man who was in the habit of 

visiting Miser Farebrother late at night and this woman whom Tom Barley saw, and who was 

conspicuously anxious that he should not see her face. These matters must be followed up; we 

can agitate, we can get time. I hear on all sides nothing but sympathy expressed for our dear 

Phoebe, and the case against her is so entirely circumstantial that I will not, I cannot, give up 

hope. A friend of mine who has chambers next to mine is so much interested in the case that he 

has offered to help me all he can. He is clearer-headed than I am just now, and cleverer, and 

higher up the ladder. He is convinced that Phoebe is innocent, and that there is a mystery in the 

affair which, unravelled, would set her free."  "God bless him!" sobbed Fanny. "What is the name 

of this good friend, that I may remember it in my prayers."  "Dick Garden. We are going to work 

together. He is waiting for me now in my rooms. He is a good fellow--the best of friends; I rely 

greatly upon him. Calm as I appear, I am burning with wrath and indignation, and I am scarcely to 

be depended upon for a clear judicial reasoning upon anything we may happily discover. I must go 

at once. Then you cannot tell me where I can find Tom Barley?"  "I will find him for you," said 

Robert, starting up.  "Do; and send him on to my place immediately. Good-by--good-by. If you 

hear anything, don't fail to let me know."  He drove rapidly to his rooms, where he found his friend 

Richard Garden awaiting him. This friend was of about the same age as himself; an ambitious, 

astute young fellow, determined to get along in the world, and almost certain to succeed, for the 



reason that he had brains and indomitable courage and industry.  He looked up from the paper 

upon which he was writing when Fred entered. Upon a smaller table in the room some food was 

spread: a plate of ham and beef, a cold pie, and bread; also a jug of ale.  "You have had nothing 

to eat?" said Garden. Fred shook his head impatiently. "Of course you haven't; and you think that 

we can go into an affair like this with empty stomachs. No, old fellow; we must assist ourselves like 

sensible men. A craving stomach is a bad mental foundation. Come, tuck away; force something 

down. That's right. Just taste this cold pie--good, isn't it? A pint of ale between us--here's your half, 

no more and no less. You feel better, don't you? Now we are fit to set to work. You saw her?" 

"Yes."  "Did you get her to talk calmly?"  "She was calmer than you are, Dick. She has made up 

her mind to die."  "Not for many a long year yet. Here's a letter I've written to the papers, signed 'A 

Lawyer,' showing up the weak points in the case, and appealing for sympathy and a surer kind of 

justice. Just finished the fourth copy as you came in. My lad is down-stairs; he will take the letters 

to the newspaper offices, and to-morrow they will be all over the country. Don't lose heart, Fred; 

there is some infernal mystery at the bottom of this affair, and I mean to get at it. You asked the 

poor girl about the dresses Mrs. Pamflett was in the habit of wearing?"  "Yes; and she said she 

never saw the woman in a blue dress."  "Is she still positive about the brooch?"  "She has not the 

slightest doubt. When her father turned her from his house she left the brooch behind her."  "Then 

it must have been placed in the grounds by some person--deliberately placed there."  "Unless it 

was dropped by accident."  "If so, it must have been a female who dropped it. Either way, the 

person who dropped or placed it where it was found can be no other than Mrs. Pamflett. Let us 

suppose that. If dropped by accident, it proves that she must have been near the spot where the 

miser was murdered; if placed there by her, it must have been placed there for a motive. Miss 

Farebrother adheres to the truth of her story as to what occurred on the night of her visit to 

Parksides?"  "Yes."  "She did not see Mrs. Pamflett?"  "No."  "But Mrs. Pamflett may have seen 

her. Let us assume that she or her son committed the deed. She sees Miss Farebrother in the 

grounds, and overhears, perhaps, what passes between the poor young lady and her father. She 

witnesses Miss Farebrother's departure from Parksides. After that the murder is committed. Then, 

seeing Miss Farebrother's veil on the ground--in Miss Farebrother's condition there are a thousand 

reasonable hypotheses to account for its having become detached from her hat--the idea presents 

itself to Mrs. Pamflett to strengthen the case against Miss Farebrother by placing the brooch also 

near the dead body."  "You do not forget the female in a blue dress that Tom Barley saw in the 

grounds?"  "I do not; and I cannot account for it. Did you ask Miss Farebrother anything about the 

man who, according to Mrs. Pamflett, had been in the habit for years of visiting Miser Farebrother 

secretly at night?"  "To her knowledge, no such man ever presented himself, and no such 


_
him, Skinner.  Why had he gradually ceased to enjoy things?  Who was to blame for the drab 

existence he was suffering?  Was it the outside world or himself?  As a boy, things were new to 

him--that was why the river was blue.  But there were many things new to him to-day--peoples, 

countries, customs--yes, a thousand things new and interesting right in New York, close at hand, if 

he'd only take the trouble to look them up.  Why was his ability to appreciate failing?  Other men, 

much older than he and only clerks at that, were happy.  He sighed.  It must be himself, for, after 

all, the world had treated him as well as he had treated the world, he reflected, being a just man. 

Unfortunately, on the train Skinner got a seat in the very center of a circle of social chatterboxes, 

male commuters, and female shoppers.  Some talked of their machines and rattled off the names 

of the makers.  There was the Pierce-Arrow, the Packard, the Buick, and all the rest of the 

mechanical visits ever took place."  "She has no remembrance of anything of the kind occurring?" 

"Not the slightest."  "It is inexplicable. There's some one at the door. Come in!"  It was Robert 

Lethbridge, who came to say that Tom Barley was on duty, and would not be able to visit Fred 

Cornwall before the morning; but if they wished to speak to him at once they would find him on his 

beat.  "No," said Garden; "we will not go to him. I want him when his time is his own, so that we 

can talk quietly and uninterruptedly. Go and tell him to come and see us at nine o'clock in the 

morning."  "He can be here earlier, Dick," said Fred Cornwall.  "Nine o'clock is early enough. It will 

give us time to sleep and rest. I am physician as well as lawyer in this case, it seems."  Robert 

Lethbridge departed with the message, and he was barely gone before two other visitors 

presented themselves. These were Kiss, the comedian, and Mr. Linton, the dramatic author. They 

looked very grave as they 


_
phrases--six-cylinder, self-starter, non-puncturable, non-skiddable.  But he did n't hear any such 

terms as non-collidable, non-turnoverable, or non-waltz-down-the-hillable.  Nor did they spare him 

the patriarchal jokes about the ubiquitous Ford.  They talked about the rising cost of gasoline 

which brought John D. in for a share a shrewd glance at them, and then said, quietly:  "You have 

something to tell us?"  "You can speak freely," said Fred. "Mr. Garden and I are working together 

in this terrible matter."  "A terrible matter indeed, Mr. Cornwall," said Kiss, with deep feeling in his 

voice, "and Mr. Linton and I are responsible for it." The young 


_
mention of John D. everybody turned to golf and Skinner got that delightful recreation _ad 

infinitum, ad nauseam_.  Skinner felt that this talk about machines was only to impress others with 

the talkers' motor lore.  For familiarity with motor lore means a certain social status.  It is part of 

the smart vernacular of to-day. Any man who can own a car has at least mounted a few steps on 

the social ladder.  The next thing to owning a car is to be able to talk about a car, for if a man can 

talk well about a machine everybody 'll think that he must have had a vast experience in that line 

and, therefore, must be a man of affairs.  Girls chattered about continued: "It is the melancholy 

truth that if it had not been for us an innocent young girl, an angel of sweetness and purity, would 

not be lying at death's door as we stand here. Unless we can prove her innocence it will haunt us 

to our dying day."  "Why do you accuse yourselves?" asked Garden.  "Was it not through our folly 

that Mr. Lethbridge was plunged into difficulties? Believing that my friend Linton had written a play 

which would make all our fortunes, did we not go to Mr. Lethbridge and by our plausible 

statements induce him to sign a bill for three hundred pounds which that infamous scoundrel, 

Jeremiah Pamflett, discounted? You will 


_
them, but that they had many friends who owned them, that they were greatly in demand as auto 

companions--thus vicariously establishing their own social status.  There was something fraternal 

about it, Skinner thought, like golf.  The conceit occurred to him that it would be a good scheme to 

get up a booklet full of glib automobile, golf, and bridge chatter, to be committed to memory, and 

mark it, "How to Bluff One's Way into Society." It might have a wide sale.  Skinner suddenly 

realized that his thoughts were a dark, minor chord in the general light-hearted chatter, for he 

cordially hated which, because of an extraordinary first-night speech made by Mr. Linton, blazed 

up for a fortnight or so, and then spluttered out like a tallow candle with a damp wick. It was in the 

hope of helping her uncle out of his difficulties--for which we, and we alone, were responsible--that 

Miss Farebrother paid a visit to her father on the night he was murdered. Had she not gone he 

would have been murdered all the same--there is no doubt in our minds as to that--and, safe and 

happy at home with her aunt and uncle, by no possibility could suspicion have been cast upon her. 

But she _did_ go,
