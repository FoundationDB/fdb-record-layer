that had been buried beneath the tree. The following day we uprooted the other tree, but failed to 

find any trace of more booty. We concluded that the remaining chest had probably been removed; 

but that is still an unsettled question.  Besides the coin, we had discovered the remains of much 

silver plate; but it was of little value, being almost entirely destroyed. But the gold--there was an 

abundance of it, and we were all made rich!  In the meantime our parents appeared on the scene 

to learn the cause of our protracted absence from home. It is needless to say that there was no 

rod of correction held over us that day.  If I had taken care of my share of the treasure as I should 

have done after my father's death, I would be living in luxury and comfort to-day; but, even 

regretting my poor judgment, I can now thank a good Providence that I have been sustained 

through a long life, which has had an undue share of misfortune, by the splendid fortune which 

came to me in that happy May of long ago.   [Illustration: "The decaying hulks of blockade runners 

that rise a little here and there above the waves"]     THE CONQUEST OF JAMESBY.   I reached 

home for tea a little late, and saw my young friend Jamesby in the back yard where he had gone 

to admire my fowls, in which I take a just pride. Old Henry, my colored servant, was playing the 

part of host; for there was no one else at home. When I made my appearance, the chickens had 

evidently become a matter of secondary interest.  Jamesby, a rising young banker of the city, was 

sitting on an empty box near the fence, and Henry was standing before him, leaning upon his 

cane, chuckling and talking in his customary deferential manner, which has always made him a 

very acceptable servant about my premises.  I approached without being observed, and did not 

hail them, for I did not wish to intrude too suddenly upon what appeared to be a very amusing 

subject of conversation. I heard Jamesby say laughingly, "Why, it was in the paper this morning--

five or six columns of it! It was a great big yarn. I can't imagine why he never told you anything 

about it."  I knew what they were talking about. I was well aware that I had told my tale of Money 

Island for publication; for had I not been sought after by men, women, and children for every 

imaginable explanation and sidelight relating to the story which might have been omitted from the 

MS furnished the printer? And had I not been asked to repeat by living voice facts in the narrative 

which I had written, as I thought, with entire clearness in the published story? The boys had all 

read the story, and I had been put to my wits' end to answer the questions asked by them; but I 

had assured several of them that if they would take a copy of the paper, go to the Island and there 

read it on the very spot where the treasure had been buried, and then and there take a careful 

survey of the situation, there would be no difficulty in their comprehending even the slightest detail. 

This seemed to me to be a very sensible suggestion; and I suppose some of them will carry it out. 

While I really enjoyed the experience of having entertained so many people that day, I was fairly 

well fatigued when I reached home, where I thought I could at least be quiet and free from the 

constant inquiries of interested the ambitious and daring project that had been placed before him. 

Hitherto it had been pretty much of an idle speculation--a dream, in short, that looked very 

charming and fascinating as the black-eyed young lady from over the seas sate in the stern of the 

boat and chatted through the idle hours.  Her imagination did not stay to regard the immediate and 

practical difficulties and risks; all these seemed already surmounted; Ronald had assumed the 

position to which he was entitled by his abilities and personal character; she only wondered which 

part of Scotland he would be living in when next her father and herself visited Europe; and whether 

they might induce him to go over with them for a while to the States.  But when Ronald himself, in 



cold blood, came to consider ways and means, there was no such plain and easy sailing.  Not that 

he hesitated about cutting himself adrift from his present moorings; he had plenty of confidence in 

himself, and knew that he could always earn a living with his ten fingers, whatever happened. 

Then he had between L80 and L90 lodged in a savings bank in Inverness; and out of that he could 

pay for any classes he might have to attend, or perhaps offer a modest premium if he wished to 

get into a surveyor's office for a short time.  But there were so many things to think of.  What 

should he do about Maggie, for example? Then Lord Ailine had always been a good master to 

him: would it not seem ungrateful that he should throw up his situation without apparent reason? 

And so forth, and so forth, through cogitations long and anxious; and many a half-hour on the 

hillside and many a half-hour by the slumbering peat-fire was given to this great project; but 

always there was one side of the question that he shut out from his mind.  For how could he admit 

to himself that this lingering hesitation--this dread, almost, of what lay await for him in the future--

had anything to do with the going away from Meenie, and the leaving behind him, and perhaps for 

ever, the hills and streams and lonely glens that were all steeped in the magic and witchery of her 

presence?  Was it not time to be done with idle fancies? And if, in the great city--in Edinburgh or 

Glasgow, as the case might be--he should fall to thinking of Ben Loyal and Bonnie Strath-Naver, 

and the long, long days on Clebrig; and Meenie coming home in the evening from her wanderings 

by Mudal-Water, with a few wild-flowers, perhaps, or a bit of white heather, but always with her 

beautiful blue-gray Highland eyes so full of kindness as she stopped for a few minutes' friendly 

chatting--well, that would be a pretty picture to look back upon, all lambent and clear in the tender 

colours that memory loves to use.  A silent picture, of course: there would be no sound of the 

summer rills, nor the sweeter sound of Meenie's voice; but not a sad picture; only remote and 

ethereal, as if the years had come between, and made everything distant and pale and dreamlike. 

The first definite thing that he did was to write to his brother in Glasgow, acquainting him with his 

plans, and begging him to obtain some further particulars about the Highland and Agricultural 

Society's certificates.  The answer that came back from Glasgow was most encouraging; for the 

Rev. Alexander Strang, though outwardly a heavy and 


_
But here was Jamesby with designs against me! He had dashed my fond hopes of rest; although 

he was somehow always considerate and endurable. I could never become impatient with him, 

even if I knew he was going to make demands upon me for more information concerning Money 

Island.  "What is Uncle Henry telling you, Jamesby?" I asked on drawing closer to them.  "Oh," he 

answered in a somewhat self-conscious manner, "he was about to tell me of an experience of his 

in money digging."  Now, I had heard old Henry tell that story before. It was one which seemed to 

justify his very sober ideas as to money getting by any other means than by one's daily work. 

"Well, Henry," I said, taking my seat also on the box, "did you really ever dig for money?"--as if I 

had never before heard him say anything about it. The implied doubt would, I knew, make him all 

the more ready to talk.  He replied promptly, with a grin of interest, "Yes, sah, cose I tried money 

diggin'."  Then he paused as if to await an invitation to proceed. "Go on, Uncle Henry," urged 

Jamesby.  Henry shifted his position, and, leaning upon his cane from another angle, went on: 

"'Twas dis away. Once uponer time me an' John Gomus an' John Flowers, we was round at Mr. 

Holmes' stables, right back of Mr. Kidder's whey I uster keep my horse and kyart; dere was woods 

right dare den, sah, an' a graveyard; an' I had a horse and kyart of my own. So one evenin' an ole 

white 'oman come fum de Sound, an' she tole us that a sperit had done tole her whey some 

money was buried; an' she wanted us to come down dere and dig it up; she couldn't dig for it, but 

she knowed whey 'twas--de sperit had tole her. So we got togedder and made a club to go down--

three of us. De place was on Wrightsville Sound, not fur from Mr. Wright's place.  "De sign was, 

dat one read de Bible back'ards, and no one speak--all hadter go by signs, an' dat'd keep de 

sperits fum pesterin' us. John Gomus, he had de rod goin' roun', an' fonn' a place to stick it. I 

dunno why he stick it whey he did. De rod pinted right down dere; and right whey de rod pinted we 

digged. When we commence diggin', it was about half-past eight o'clock, and we worked hard, 

sah. We digged a hole big enough to set a small house in. John, he kep' bearin' on de rod, an' de 

rod it kep' goin' down. Den de rod at las' struck sumpn; and we was so glad, thinkin' we'd struck de 

pot! Every one was rejoiced! We didn' talk, but jes fling up de dirt! An' when we dig down dere, 

sah, what you spose 'twas. Nothin' but a big ole cow's horn. An' after all dat diggin'! We done an' 

digged a hole 'bout fifteen or twenty feet across, and goodness knows how deep; an' 'twas 'bout 

four in de mornin' before we quit. We pack up an' come back home, feelin' jes as cheap as a wet 

chicken.  "De ole 'oman come 'roun agin, an' tole us dat de money was dere; fer de sperit had tole 

her agin 'twas dere. But we warn't anxious to try for it agin. We thought we done enough."  Old 

Henry chuckled, and limped away; and we both laughed heartily at his droll yarn. Jamesby 

enjoyed the tale particularly; and, although I felt that it might somehow be at my expense, I was 

duly amused.  When Jamesby descended from his hilarious heights, he turned to me rather 

gravely, and said, "Now, I want it from your own lips; did you really dig for money on Money 

Island?"  I answered, "I did."  "And," he continued, "was that a true story you told about it?"  "Now, 

Jamesby," I replied, "I really cannot endure this doubt cast upon the truthfulness of my story. I 

decline to discuss the matter. You have read the paper, and you know me as the author of the 

story."  "But," he added in rather a comical tone, "there are some things which (with all due respect 

for your trustworthiness) call for a more positive confirmation."  I knew I would not have written 

anything on so important a subject without proper consideration; and he knew it too. However, I 

realized the fact that an effort to believe such a story as I had offered to the public may have made 



a somewhat weighty demand upon credulity, at least with some people. To answer his last 

suggestion, I merely drew out of my pocket a copy of the "Savannah Morning News", containing 

an account of a stranger's mysterious movements about Warsaw Island near Savannah, and his 

sudden disappearance, leaving good evidence that he had carried with him a hidden treasure 

found there, and which tradition had stated lay upon the Island. I also reminded him of the fact that 

Dutch Island near Savannah is full of what are known as "treasure holes", which have been made 

by persons seeking the buried booty of the pirates of the olden times. He knew all about these; 

and he had also heard that some of the enterprising explorers into the mysteries of that island had 

been successful.  But Jamesby was still incredulous. So I turned the conversation to my fowls; and 

he was very ready to admit that I had told the genuine thing in describing to him some of the 

excellent points of my prize birds. There was no doubt that I could exhibit several specimens 

which any fancier would be proud of.  Jamesby remained to tea, so that we could go to the lodge 

together, and I enjoyed the quiet stroll down town with him. We had hardly entered the hall, 

though, before the historian of the town, who is also a leading Mason, approached me regarding 

my Money Island revelations. "Sir," he said, "I regard it throughout as a most interesting and 

plausible narrative; and I am glad we have been favored by being allowed to read it. I have made 

a study of the pirates who infested our coast in the early colonial days, and I know that this 

section, particularly the lower region of the Cape Fear, was a favorite rendezvous for them. It is 

known upon most reliable information that there are immense quantities of captured treasure 

secreted along the coast, and the wonder is that there have not been some really serious efforts to 

find it."  Another gentleman added, "Yes, and they also buried treasure further down South; for at 

my old home (and I speak the honest trath) I have stood in the hole from which my friend, Mr. 

Coachman, unearthed accidentally a small fortune, which gave him a very comfortable start in 

life."  The conversation lingered in this absorbing vein until the meeting was opened, much to my 

relief; for I had been surfeited with the subject of money finding for that day, at least. But that was 

not all; for, during the solemnity of the opening exercises, I heard some one telling, in an 

undertone, of a negro who had found a roll of old bank notes in a log which had been hauled to a 

saw mill to be cut.  The next day I was still aware that I possessed an unusual attraction; and I 

resigned myself patiently to the service of all my inquiring friends. Jamesby actually stopped by my 

office to walk up with me at lunch time. He was willing to move along slowly with me, for now in my 

old age I find I have to walk slowly. I knew it would have been more natural for him to have gone 

on briskly; but he was polite and assured me that the pleasure of my company was better than too 

much time spent at his meal.  We stopped on the way at a newspaper office. The editor and 

proprietor had observed our approach and they were awaiting us with looks of amused interest. 

"Hello!" the proprietor said cheerily, "you have really stimulated the enterprise of the town. Why 

have you kept so reticent on that subject all these years?"  Of course, I knew what subject was 

referred to; for I had been living for person, not a little proud of the position that he had won for 

himself, and rather inclined to conceal from his circle of friends--who were mostly members of his 

congregation--the fact that his brother was merely a gamekeeper in the Highlands.  Nay, more, he 

was willing to assist; he would take Maggie into his house, so that there might be no difficulty in 

that direction; and in the meantime he would see what were the best class-books on the subjects 

named, so that Ronald might be working away at them in these comparatively idle spring and 



summer months, and need not give up his situation prematurely.  There was even some hint 

thrown out that perhaps Ronald might board with his brother; but this was not pressed; for the fact 

was that Mrs. Alexander was a severely rigid disciplinarian, and on the few occasions on which 

Ronald had been their guest she had given both brothers to understand that the frivolous gaiety of 

Ronald's talk, and the independence of his manners, and his Gallio-like indifference about the 

fierce schisms and heart-burnings in the Scotch Church were not, in her opinion, in consonance 

with the atmosphere that ought to prevail in a Free Church minister's house.  But on the whole the 

letter was very friendly and hopeful; and Ronald was enjoined to let his brother know when his 

decision should be finally taken, and in what way assistance could be rendered him.  One night 

the little Maggie stole away through the dark to the Doctor's cottage.  There was a light in the 

window of Meenie's room; she could hear the sound of the piano; no doubt Meenie was practising 

and alone; and on such occasions a visit from Maggie was but little interruption. And so the 

smaller girl went boldly towards the house and gained admission, and was proceeding upstairs 

without any ceremony, when the sudden cessation of the music caused her to stop.  And then she 

heard a very simple and pathetic air begin--just touched here and there with a few chords: and 

was Meenie, tired with the hard work of the practising, allowing herself this little bit of quiet 

relaxation?  She was singing too--though so gently that Maggie could scarcely make out the 

words. But she knew the song--had not Meenie sung it many times before to her?--and who but 

Meenie could put such tenderness and pathos into the simple air?  She had almost to imagine the 

words--so gentle was the voice that went with those lightly-touched chords--  _'The sun rase sae 

rosy, the gray hills adorning,_   _Light sprang the laverock, and mounted on hie,_ _When true to 

the tryst o' blythe May's dewy morning,_   _Jeanie cam' linking out owre the green lea._ _To mark 

her impatience I crap 'mong the brackens,_   _Aft, aft to the kent gate she turned her black e'e;_ 

_Then lying down dowilie, sighed, by the willow tree,_   _"I am asleep, do not waken me."'[#]_  [#] 

'I am asleep, do not waken me' is the English equivalent of the Gaelic name of the air, which is a 

very old one, and equally pathetic in its Irish and Highland versions.  Then there was silence.  The 

little Maggie waited; for this song was a great favourite with Ronald, who himself sometimes 

attempted it; and she would be able to tell him when she got home that she had heard Meenie 

sing it--and he always listened with interest to anything, even the smallest particulars, she could 

tell him about Meenie and about what she had done or said.  But where were the other verses? 

She waited and listened; the silence was unbroken.  And so she tapped lightly at the door and 

entered.  And then something strange happened.  For when Maggie shut the door behind her and 

went forward, Meenie did not at once turn her head to see who this was, but had hastily whipped 

out her handkerchief and passed it over her eyes.  And when she did turn, it was with a kind of 

look of bravery--as if to dare any one to say that she had been crying--though there were traces of 

tears on her cheeks.  'Is it you, Maggie?  I am glad to see you,' she managed to say.  The younger 

girl was rather frightened and sorely concerned as well.  'But what is it, Meenie dear?' she said, 

going and taking her hand. 'Are you in trouble?'  'No, no,' her friend said, with an effort to appear 

quite cheerful, 'I was thinking of many things--I scarcely know what.  And now take off your things 

and sit down, Maggie, and tell me all about this great news. It was only this afternoon that my 

father learnt that you and your brother were going away; and he would not believe it at first, till he 

saw Ronald himself.  And it is true, after all?  Dear me, what a change there will be!'  She spoke 



quite in her usual manner now; and her lips were no longer trembling, but smiling; and the 

Highland eyes were clear, and as full of kindness as ever.  'But it is a long way off, Meenie,' the 

smaller girl began to explain quickly, when she had taken her seat by the fire, 'and Ronald is so 

anxious to please everybody, and--and that is why I came along to ask you what you think best.' 

'I?' said Meenie, with a sudden slight touch of reserve.  'It'll not be a nice thing going away among 

strange folk,' said her companion, 'but I'll no grumble if it's to do Ronald good; and even among 

strange folk--well, I don't care as long as I have Ronald and you, Meenie.  And it's to Glasgow, and 

not to Edinburgh, he thinks he'll have to go; and then you will be in Glasgow too; so I do not mind 

anything else.  It will not be so lonely for any of us; and we can spend the evenings together--oh 

no, it will not be lonely at all----'  'But, Maggie,' the elder girl said gravely, 'I am not going to 

Glasgow.'  Her companion looked up quickly, with frightened eyes.  'But you said you were going, 

Meenie!'  'Oh no,' the other said gently.  'My mother has often talked of it--and I suppose I may 

have to go some time; but my father is against it; and I know I am not going at present anyway.' 

'And you are staying here--and--and Ronald and me--we will be by ourselves in Glasgow!' the 

other exclaimed, as if this prospect were too terrible to be quite comprehended as yet.  'But if it is 

needful he should go?' Meenie said. 'People have often to part from their friends like that.'  'Yes, 

and it's no much matter when they have plenty of friends,' said the smaller girl, with her eyes 

becoming moist, 'but, Meenie, I havena got one but you.'  'Oh no, you must not say that,' her friend 

remonstrated. 'Why, there is your brother in Glasgow, and his family; I am sure they will be kind to 

you.  And Ronald will make plenty of friends wherever he goes--you can see that for yourself; and 

do you think you will be lonely in a great town like Glasgow?  It is the very place to make friends, 

and plenty of them--  'Oh, I don't know what to do--I don't know what to do, if you are not going to 

Glasgow, Meenie!' she broke in.  'I wonder if it was that that Ronald meant.  He asked me whether 

I would like to stay here or go with him, for Mrs. Murray has offered to take me in, and I would 

have to help at keeping the books, and that is very kind of them, I am sure, for I did not think I 

could be of any use to anybody.  And you are to be here in Inver-Mudal--and Ronald away in 

Glasgow----'  Well, it was a bewildering thing.  These were the two people she cared for most of all 

in the world; and virtually she was called upon to choose between them.  And if she had a greater 

loyalty and reverence towards her brother, still, Meenie was her sole girl-friend, and monitress, 

and counsellor.  What would her tasks be without Meenie's approval; how 


_
gold, buried treasure, marvelous discoveries, pirates and other engaging topics of thought; and I 

now looked for nothing else.  "In my opinion," he continued, "it was a very good story. Of course, it 

goes without saying that it is true. I tell you, sir, that it is my judgment that this whole section of 

coast line is rich in gold. Not only did those pirates bury gold here, but, during the Civil War, the 

Confederate blockade runners, when fearing capture, were known repeatedly to throw gold into 

the sea along the beach, sometimes by the keg full; and not one dollar's worth of it has ever yet 

been recovered, so far as I can learn. It is all right there where they dropped it. And besides that, 

at least on one occasion, it is a well proven fact that a chest of gold was buried by the commander 

of one of the blockade runners in the marsh grass on the shore not far below Wilmington; and 

there is no evidence that it has ever yet been unearthed. In fact, all knowledge of the exact spot 

has been lost, I understand."  "Yes," interposed the editor, "it is all quite reasonable; and, as 

something germain to the subject, I can cite an interesting instance. When, soon after the War our 

old Confederate naval captain bought his home on Greenville Sound and was preparing to build 

his residence, he had the old house which stood upon the site torn down, and, upon the 

carpenters coming one morning to begin the erection of the new building, they found an immense 

excavation right where the old house stood. Now, that old building was in former years used by a 

Portuguese as an inn for the entertainment of sailors from the vessels in the port of Wilmington; 

and, there being certain traditions in regard to some money having been buried beneath it, it was 

natural to conclude that the excavation resulted from an energetic effort to find the money. The 

hole was made at night, but by whom it has never been found out. The incident was shrouded in a 

mystery which has never been cleared."  We talked still further along that vein, the editor 

emphatically asserting his assured belief in the possibility of recovering quantities of gold from the 

seashore below Meenie's aid; what would the days be like without the witchery of Meenie's 

companionship--even if that were limited to a passing word or a smile?  Ronald had not sought to 

influence her choice; indeed, the alternative had scarcely been considered, for she believed that 

Meenie was going to Glasgow also; and with her hero brother and her beautiful girl-friend both 

there, what more could she wish for in the world?  But now---?  Well, Meenie, in her wise and kind 

way, strove to calm the anxiety of the girl; and her advice was altogether in favour of Maggie's 

going to Glasgow with her brother Ronald, if that were equally convenient to him, and of no greater 

expense than her remaining in Inver-Mudal with Mrs. Murray.  'For you know he wants somebody 

to look after him,' Meenie continued, with her eyes rather averted, 'and if it does not matter so 

much here about his carelessness of being wet and cold, because he has plenty of health and 

exercise, it will be very different in Glasgow, where there should be some one to bid him be more 

careful.'  'But he pays no heed to me,' the little sister sighed, 'unless I can tell him you have been 

saying so-and-so--then he listens.  He is very strange.  He has never once worn the blue jersey 

that I knitted for him. He asked me a lot of questions about how it was begun; and I told him as 

little as I could about the help you had given me,' she continued evasively, 'and when the snow 

came on, I thought he would wear it; but no--he put it away in the drawer with his best clothes, and 

it's lying there all neatly folded up--and what is the use of that?  If you were going to Glasgow, 

Meenie, it would be quite different.  It will be very lonely there.'  'Lonely!' the other exclaimed; 'with 

your brother Ronald, and your other brother's family, and all their friends. And then you will be able 

to go to school and have more regular teaching--Ronald spoke once or twice to me about that.' 



'Yes, indeed,' the little Maggie said; but the prospect did not cheer her much; and for some 

minutes they both sate silent, she staring into the fire.  And then she said bitterly--  'I wish the 

American people had never come 


_
of blockade runners that rise a little here and there above the waves, where they met a disastrous 

check to their efforts to slip into the harbor.  As we started out again upon the street, Jamesby 

said, "Well, sir,--pardon my frankness--but I must say that I have never found your company so 

interesting before; and I shall be equally frank in saying that--I have never been able yet to believe 

half the tales I have heard It never would have come into Ronald's head to leave Inver-Mudal but 

for them.  And where else will he be so well known--and--and every one speaking well of him--and 

every one so friendly----'  'But, Maggie, these things are always happening,' her companion 

remonstrated.  'Look at the changes my father has had to make.'  'And I wonder if we are never to 

come back to Inver-Mudal, Meenie?' the girl said suddenly, with
