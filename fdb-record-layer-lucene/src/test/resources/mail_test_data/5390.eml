=E2=80=99s no vanity!... I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered;=
 there=E2=80=99s but three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and they are=

to it some general virtues=E2=80=94we may indeed go further and say that co=
medy produces perhaps the=20

terror as well as the pity of tragedy, and that the two kinds of writing ar=
e, as Socrates said, but=20

one. The tragic or epic hero, portrayed as better than in actual life, may =
have faults, but so far from=20

despising him on that account, we may not even smile; we like him so much t=
hat the faults seem=20

his misfortune. Moreover, if we refer the weakness of the comic character t=
o nature itself, how can=20

we be hard on the individual? And if we add to the faults positive and lova=
ble virtues, will not the=20

comic character seem at last to be tragic? In English drama Falstaff is per=
haps the prince of comic=20

characters, so vitally imagined that he lives on the stage apart from any p=
lot; he is a living person,=20

with no virtues at all, yet infinitely likable. He can be played to make th=
e groundlings laugh, but=20

most of us after we have laughed taste profound tragedy in what we have lau=
ghed at. He is almost=20

majestic in those moments of Brittany. Anne made some show of reluctance, o=
f inconsolable grief,=20

and of scruples moral and sentimental. As a matter of fact, however, she ha=
d consented to marry=20

Louis before the divorce from Jeanne had been secured, and within four mont=
hs from the death of=20

Charles. The decree of divorce, brought by magnificent Caesar Borgia himsel=
f, was published in=20

December, 1498, and the marriage of Anne and Louis XII. was celebrated at N=
antes in January,=20

1499.  Anne had profited by her sojourn at the French court; the new contra=
ct of marriage was far=20

from being as favorable to France as that imposed by Anne de Beaujeu. It wa=
s now stipulated that=20

she should retain in her own hands the administration of Brittany, and that=
 the administrative=20

offices and the ecclesiastical benefices should be filled by natives of Bri=
ttany only and with the=20

consent of the duchess; that the ancient rights and privileges so dear to t=
he Bretons should be=20

respected; and that the province should descend to the second child of the =
marriage, or to=20


_
exactly as he is=E2=80=94when he sees himself, as it were, from outside, an=
d points to those aspects of=20

his frailty which belong to mankind. An actor might play the scenes on the =
battle-field in _Henry=20

IV_ so as to inspire, not laughter at the fat knight=E2=80=99s depravity, b=
ut a pitiful and self-accusing=20

silence. When he finds the corpse of Sir Walter Blunt, just slain=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=9CSoft! who are you? Sir Walter=20

and Louis, or to her own heirs next of kin, in case the marriage should pro=
ve childless. But little=20

hope was left in this contract that the dearest wish of Anne de Beaujeu sho=
uld be gratified, and=20

that Brittany should remain French.  A complete change of character and of =
policy in a woman of=20

twenty-three is very remarkable; and we are therefore surprised to find tha=
