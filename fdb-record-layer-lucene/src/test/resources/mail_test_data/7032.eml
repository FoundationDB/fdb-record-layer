the Serpent-holder is the head of the so-called Kneeler. Their heads are th=
e more readily to be=20

distinguished as the stars which compose them are by no means dim.  5. The =
foot of the Kneeler=20

rests on the temple of that Serpent which is entwined between the She-Bears=
 (called=20

Septentriones). The little Dolphin moves in front of the Horse. Opposite th=
e bill of the Bird is the=20

Lyre. The Crown is arranged between the shoulders of the Warden and the Kne=
eler. In the=20

northern circle are the two She-Bears with their shoulder-blades confrontin=
g and their breasts=20

turned away from one another. The Greeks call the Lesser Bear [Greek: kynos=
oura], and the=20

Greater [Greek: elike]. Their heads face different ways, and their tails ar=
e shaped so that each is in=20

front of the head of the other Bear; for the tails of both stick up over th=
em.  6. The Serpent is said=20

to lie stretched out between their tails, and in it there is a star, called=
 Polus, shining near the head=20

of the Greater Bear. At the nearest point, the Serpent winds its head round=
, but is also flung in a=20

fold round the head of the Lesser Bear, and stretches out close to her feet=
. Here it twists back,=20

making another fold, and, lifting itself up, bends its snout and right temp=
le from the head of the=20

Lesser Bear round towards the Greater. Above the tail of the Lesser Bear ar=
e the feet of Cepheus,=20

and at this point, at the very top, are stars forming an equilateral triang=
le. There are a good many=20

stars common to the Lesser Bear and to Cepheus.  I have now mentioned the c=
onstellations which=20

are arranged in the heaven to the right of the east, between the belt of th=
e signs and the north. I=20

shall next describe those that Nature has distributed to the left of the ea=
st and in the southern=20

regions.     CHAPTER V  THE SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS   1. First, under the H=
e-Goat lies=20

the Southern Fish, facing towards the tail of the Whale. The Censer is unde=
r the Scorpion's sting.=20

The fore parts of the Centaur are next to the Balance and the Scorpion, and=
 he holds in his hands=20

the figure which astronomers call the Beast. Beneath the Virgin, Lion, and =
Crab is the twisted=20

girdle formed by the Snake, extending over a whole line of stars, his snout=
 raised near the Crab,=20

supporting the Bowl with the middle of his body near the Lion, and bringing=
 his tail, on which is the=20

Raven, under and near the hand of the Virgin. The region above his shoulder=
s is equally bright.  2.=20

Beneath the Snake's belly, at the tail, lies the Centaur. Near the Bowl and=
 the Lion is the ship=20

named Argo. Her bow is invisible, but her mast and the parts about the helm=
 are in plain sight, the=20

stern of the vessel joining the Dog at the tip of his tail. The Little Dog =
follows the Twins, and is=20

opposite the Snake's head. The Greater Dog follows the Lesser. Orion lies a=
slant, under the Bull's=20

hoof; in his left hand grasping his club, and raising the other toward the =
Twins.  3. At his feet is the=20

Dog, following a little behind the Hare. The Whale lies under the Ram and t=
he Fishes, and from his=20

mane there is a slight sprinkling of stars, called in Greek [Greek: harpedo=
nai], regularly disposed=20

towards each of the Fishes. This ligature by which they hang is carried a g=
reat way inwards, but=20

reaches out to the top of the mane of the Whale. The River, formed of stars=
, flows from a source at=20

the left foot of Orion. But the Water, said to pour from the Waterman, flow=
s between the head of=20

the Southern Fish and the tail of the Whale.  4. These constellations, whos=
e outlines and shapes=20

in the heavens were designed by Nature and the divine intelligence, I have =
described according to=20

the view of the natural philosopher Democritus, but only those whose rising=
s and settings we can=20

observe and see with our own eyes. Just as the Bears turn round the pivot o=
f the axis without ever=20

setting or sinking under the earth, there are likewise stars that keep turn=
ing round the southern=20

pivot, which on account of the inclination of the firmament lies always und=
er the earth, and, being=20

hidden there, they never rise and emerge above the earth. Consequently, the=
 figures which they=20



form are unknown to us on account of the interposition of the earth. The st=
ar Canopus proves this.=20

It is unknown to our vicinity; but we have reports of it from merchants who=
 have been to the most=20

distant part of Egypt, and to regions bordering on the uttermost boundaries=
 of the earth.=20

CHAPTER VI  ASTROLOGY AND WEATHER PROGNOSTICS   1. I have shown how the=20

firmament, and the twelve signs with the constellations arranged to the nor=
th and south of them, fly=20

round the earth, so that the matter may be clearly understood. For it is fr=
om this revolution of the=20

firmament, from the course of the sun through the must confess I am afraid:=
 her brother and she=20

have a strange way of thinking; they look at things strangely, you know, an=
d her disposition is very=20

impetuous. One may get married, and then, there is no knowing, one may find=
 oneself in an=20

unpleasant position.'  "And he did not make an offer; he kept putting it of=
f, to the great vexation of=20

the headmaster's wife and all our ladies; he went on weighing his future du=
ties and=20

responsibilities, and meanwhile he went for a walk with Varinka almost ever=
y day--possibly he=20

thought that this was necessary in his position--and came to see me to talk=
 about family life. And=20

in all probability in the end he would have proposed to her, and would have=
 made one of those=20

unnecessary, stupid marriages such as are made by thousands among us from b=
eing bored and=20

having nothing to do, if it had not been for a _kolossalische scandal_. I m=
ust mention that=20

Varinka's brother, Kovalenko, detested Byelikov from the first day of their=
 acquaintance, and could=20

not endure him.  "'I don't understand,' he used to say to us, shrugging his=
 shoulders--'I don't=20

understand how you can put up with that sneak, that nasty phiz. Ugh! how ca=
n you live here! The=20

atmosphere is stifling and unclean! Do you call yourselves schoolmasters, t=
eachers? You are=20

paltry government clerks. You keep, not a temple of science, but a departme=
nt for red tape and=20

loyal behaviour, and it smells as sour as a police-station. No, my friends;=
 I will stay with you for a=20

while, and then I will go to my farm and there catch crabs and teach the Li=
ttle Russians. I shall go,=20

and you can stay here with your Judas--damn his soul!'  "Or he would laugh =
till he cried, first in a=20

loud bass, then in a shrill, thin laugh, and ask me, waving his hands:  "'W=
hat does he sit here for?=20

What does he want? He sits and stares.'  "He even gave Byelikov a nickname,=
 'The Spider.' And it=20

will readily be understood that we avoided talking to him of his sister's b=
eing about to marry 'The=20

Spider.'  "And on one occasion, when the headmaster's wife hinted to him wh=
at a good thing it=20

would be to secure his sister's future with such a reliable, universally re=
spected man as Byelikov,=20

he frowned and muttered:  "'It's not my business; let her marry a reptile i=
f she likes. I don't like=20

meddling in other people's affairs.'  "Now hear what happened next. Some mi=
schievous person=20

drew a caricature of Byelikov walking along in his goloshes with his trouse=
rs tucked up, under his=20

umbrella, with Varinka on his arm; below, the inscription 'Anthropos in lov=
e.' The expression was=20

caught to a marvel, you know. The artist must have worked for more than one=
 night, for the=20

teachers of both the boys' and girls' high-schools, the teachers of the sem=
inary, the government=20

officials, all received a copy. Byelikov received one, too. The caricature =
made a very painful=20

impression on him.  "We went out together; it was the first of May, a Sunda=
y, and all of us, the=20

boys and the teachers, had agreed to meet at the high-school and then to go=
 for a walk together to=20

a wood beyond the town. We set off, and he was green in the face and gloomi=
er than a storm-

cloud.  "'What wicked, ill-natured people there are!' he said, and his lips=
 quivered.  "I felt really=20

sorry for him. We were walking along, and all of a sudden--would you believ=
e it?--Kovalenko came=20

bowling along on a bicycle, and after him, also on a bicycle, Varinka, flus=
hed and exhausted, but=20



good-humoured and gay.  "'We are going on ahead,' she called. 'What lovely =
weather! Awfully=20

lovely!'  "And they both disappeared from our sight. Byelikov turned white =
instead of green, and=20

seemed petrified. He stopped short and stared at me....  "'What is the mean=
ing of it? Tell me,=20

please!' he asked. 'Can my eyes have deceived me? Is it the proper thing fo=
r high-school masters=20

and ladies to ride bicycles?'  "'What is there improper about it?' I said. =
'Let them ride and enjoy=20

themselves.'  "'But how can that be?' he cried, amazed at my calm. 'What ar=
e you saying?'  "And=20

he was so shocked that he was unwilling to go on, and returned home.  "Next=
 day he was=20

continually twitching and nervously rubbing his hands, and it was evident f=
rom his face that he was=20

unwell. And he left before his work was over, for the first time in his lif=
e. And he ate no dinner.=20

Towards evening he wrapped himself up warmly, though it was quite warm weat=
her, and sallied=20

out to the Kovalenkos'. Varinka was out; he found her brother, however.  "'=
Pray sit down,'=20

Kovalenko said coldly, with a frown. His face looked sleepy; he had just ha=
d a nap after dinner,=20

and was in a very bad humour.  "Byelikov sat in silence for ten minutes, an=
d then began:  "'I have=20

come to see you to relieve my mind. I am very, very much=20


_
equinoctial gnomons, that we find the figure of the analemma.  2. As for th=
e branch of astronomy=20

which concerns the influences of the twelve signs, the five stars, the sun,=
 and the moon upon=20

human life, we must leave all this to the calculations of the Chaldeans, to=
 whom belongs the art of=20

casting nativities, which enables them to declare the past and the future b=
y means of calculations=20

based on the stars. These discoveries have been transmitted by the men of g=
enius and great=20

acuteness who sprang directly from the nation of the Chaldeans; first of al=
l, by Berosus, who=20

settled in the island state of Cos, and there opened a school. Afterwards A=
ntipater pursued the=20

subject; then there was Archinapolus, who also left rules for casting nativ=
ities, based not on the=20

moment of birth but on that of conception.  3. When we come to natural phil=
osophy, however,=20

Thales of Miletus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, Pythagoras of Samos, Xenophane=
s of Colophon,=20

and Democritus of Abdera have in various ways investigated and left us the =
laws and the working=20

of the laws by which nature governs it. In the track of their discoveries, =
Eudoxus, Euctemon,=20

Callippus, Meto, Philippus, Hipparchus, Aratus, and others discovered the r=
isings and settings of=20

the constellations, as well as weather prognostications from astronomy thro=
ugh the study of the=20

calendars, and this study they set forth and left to posterity. Their learn=
ing deserves the admiration=20

of mankind; for they were so solicitous as even to be able to predict, long=
 beforehand, with divining=20

mind, the signs of the weather which was to follow in the future. On this s=
ubject, therefore,=20

reference must be made to their labours and investigations.     CHAPTER VII=
  THE ANALEMMA=20

AND ITS APPLICATIONS   1. In distinction from the subjects first mentioned,=
 we must ourselves=20

explain the principles which govern the shortening and lengthening of the d=
ay. When the sun is at=20

the equinoxes, that is, passing through Aries or Libra, he makes the gnomon=
 cast a shadow equal=20

to eight ninths of its own length, in the latitude of Rome. In Athens, the =
shadow is equal to three=20

fourths of the length of the gnomon; at Rhodes to five sevenths; at Tarentu=
m, to nine elevenths; at=20

Alexandria, to three fifths; and so at other places it is found that the sh=
adows of equinoctial=20

gnomons are naturally different from one another.  2. Hence, wherever a sun=
dial is to be=20

constructed, we must take the equinoctial shadow of the place. If it is fou=
nd to be, as in Rome,=20

equal to eight ninths of the gnomon, let a line be drawn on a plane surface=
, and in the middle=20

thereof erect a perpendicular, plumb to the line, which perpendicular is ca=
lled the troubled. Some=20

scurrilous fellow has drawn an absurd caricature of me and another person, =
in whom we are both=20

deeply interested. I regard it as a duty to assure you that I have had no h=
and in it.... I have given=20

no sort of ground for such ridicule--on the contrary, I have always behaved=
 in every way like a=20

gentleman.'  "Kovalenko sat sulky and silent. Byelikov waited a little, and=
 went on slowly in a=20

mournful voice:  "'And I have something else to say to you. I have been in =
the service for years,=20

while you have only lately entered it, and I consider it my duty as an olde=
r colleague to give you a=20

warning. You ride on a bicycle, and that pastime is utterly unsuitable for =
an educator of youth.'=20

"'Why so?' asked Kovalenko in his bass.  "'Surely that needs no explanation=
, Mihail Savvitch--

surely you can understand that? If the teacher rides a bicycle, what can yo=
u expect the pupils to=20

do? You will have them walking on their heads next! And so long as there is=
 no formal permission=20

to do so, it is out of the question. I was horrified yesterday! When I saw =
your sister everything=20

seemed dancing before my eyes. A lady or a young girl on a bicycle--it's aw=
ful!'  "'What is it you=20

want exactly?'  "'All I want is to warn you, Mihail Savvitch. You are a you=
ng man, you have a future=20

before you, you must be very, very careful in your behaviour, and you are s=
o careless--oh, so=20



careless! You go about in an embroidered shirt, are constantly seen in the =
street carrying books,=20

and now the bicycle, too. The headmaster will learn that you and your siste=
r ride the bicycle, and=20

then it will reach the higher authorities.... Will that be a good thing?'  =
"'It's no business of anybody=20

else if my sister and I do bicycle!' said Kovalenko, and he turned crimson.=
 'And damnation take=20

any one who meddles in my private affairs!'  "Byelikov turned pale and got =
up.  "'If you speak to=20

me in that tone I cannot continue,' he said. 'And I beg you never to expres=
s yourself like that about=20

our superiors in my presence; you ought to be respectful to the authorities=
.'  "'Why, have I said any=20

harm of the authorities?' asked Kovalenko, looking at him wrathfully. 'Plea=
se leave me alone. I am=20

an honest man, and do not care to talk to a gentleman like you. I don't lik=
e sneaks!'  "Byelikov flew=20

into a nervous flutter, and began hurriedly putting on his coat, with an ex=
pression of horror on his=20

face. It was the first time in his life he had been spoken to so rudely.  "=
'You can say what you=20

please,' he said, as he went out from the entry to the landing on the stair=
case. 'I ought only to warn=20

you: possibly some one may have overheard us, and that our conversation may=
 not be=20


_
plane, let the line of the gnomon be divided off by the compasses into nine=
 parts, and take the=20

point designating the ninth part as a centre, to be marked by the letter A.=
 Then, opening the=20

compasses from that centre to the line in the plane at the point B, describ=
e a circle. This circle is=20

called the meridian.  3. Then, of the nine parts between the plane and the =
centre on the gnomon,=20

take eight, and mark them off on the line in the plane to the point C. This=
 will be the equinoctial=20

shadow of the gnomon. From that point, marked by C, let a line be drawn thr=
ough the centre at the=20

point A, and this will represent a ray of the sun at the equinox. Then, ext=
ending the compasses=20

from the centre to the line in the plane, mark off the equidistant points E=
 on the left and I on the=20

right, on the two sides of the circumference, and let a line be drawn throu=
gh the centre, dividing=20

the circle into two equal semicircles. This line is called by mathematician=
s the horizon.=20

[Illustration]  4. Then, take a fifteenth part of the entire circumference,=
 and, placing the centre of=20

the compasses on the circumference at the point where the equinoctial ray c=
uts it at the letter F,=20

mark off the points G and H on the right and left. Then lines must be drawn=
 from these (and the=20

centre) to the line of the plane at the points T and R, and thus, one will =
represent the ray of the sun=20

in winter, and the other the ray in summer. Opposite E will be the point I,=
 where the line drawn=20

through the centre at the point A cuts the circumference; opposite G and H =
will be the points L and=20

K; and opposite C, F, and A will be the point N.  5. Then, diameters are to=
 be drawn from G to L=20

and from H to K. The upper will denote the summer and the lower the winter =
portion. These=20

diameters are to be divided equally in the middle at the points M and O, an=
d those centres=20

marked; then, through these marks and the centre A, draw a line extending t=
o the two sides of the=20

circumference at the points P and Q. This will be a line perpendicular to t=
he equinoctial ray, and it=20

is called in mathematical figures the axis. From these same centres open th=
e compasses to the=20

ends of the diameters, and describe semicircles, one of which will be for s=
ummer and the other for=20

winter.  6. Then, at the points at which the parallel lines cut the line ca=
lled the horizon, the letter S=20

is to be on the right and the letter V on the left, and from the extremity =
of the semicircle, at the=20

point G, draw a line parallel to the axis, extending to the headmaster of o=
ur conversation... in its=20

main features. I am bound to do so.'  "'Inform him? You can go and make you=
r report!'  "Kovalenko=20

seized him from behind by the collar and gave him a push, and Byelikov roll=
ed downstairs,=20

thudding with his goloshes. The staircase was high and steep, but he rolled=
 to the bottom unhurt,=20

got up, and touched his nose to see whether his spectacles were all right. =
But just as he was=20

falling down the stairs Varinka came in, and with her two ladies; they stoo=
d below staring, and to=20

Byelikov this was more terrible than anything. I believe he would rather ha=
ve broken his neck or=20

both legs than have been an object of ridicule. 'Why, now the whole town wo=
uld hear of it; it would=20

come to the headmaster's ears, would reach the higher authorities--oh, it m=
ight lead to something!=20

There would be another caricature, and it would all end in his being asked =
to resign his post....=20

"When he got up, Varinka recognized him, and, looking at his ridiculous fac=
e, his crumpled=20

overcoat, and his goloshes, not understanding what had happened and supposi=
ng that he had=20

slipped down by accident, could not restrain herself, and laughed loud enou=
gh to be heard by all=20

the flats:  "'Ha-ha-ha!'  "And this pealing, ringing 'Ha-ha-ha!' was the la=
st straw that put an end to=20

everything: to the proposed match and to Byelikov's earthly existence. He d=
id not hear what=20

Varinka said to him; he saw nothing. On reaching home, the first thing he d=
id was to remove her=20

portrait from the table; then he went to bed, and he never got up again.  "=
Three days later Afanasy=20



came to me and asked whether we should not send for the doctor, as there wa=
s something wrong=20

with his master. I went in to Byelikov. He lay silent behind the curtain, c=
overed with a quilt; if one=20

asked him a question, he said 'Yes' or 'No' and not another sound. He lay t=
here while Afanasy,=20

gloomy and scowling, hovered about him, sighing heavily, and smelling like =
a pothouse.  "A month=20

later Byelikov died. We all went to his funeral--that is, both the high-sch=
ools and the seminary.=20

Now when he was lying in his coffin his expression was mild, agreeable, eve=
n cheerful, as though=20

he were glad that he had at last been put into a case which he would never =
leave again. Yes, he=20

had attained his ideal! And, as though in his honour, it was dull, rainy we=
ather on the day of his=20

funeral, and we all wore goloshes and took our umbrellas. Varinka, too, was=
 at the funeral, and=20

when the coffin was lowered into the grave she burst=20


_
point H. This parallel line is called the Logotomus. Then, centre the compa=
sses at the point where=20

the equinoctial ray cuts that line, at the letter D, and open them to the p=
oint where the summer ray=20

cuts the circumference at the letter H. From the equinoctial centre, with a=
 radius extending to the=20

summer ray, describe the circumference of the circle of the months, which i=
s called Menaeus.=20

Thus we shall have the figure of the analemma.  7. This having been drawn a=
nd completed, the=20

scheme of hours is next to be drawn on the baseplates from the analemma, ac=
cording to the=20

winter lines, or those of summer, or the equinoxes, or the months, and thus=
 many different kinds of=20

dials may be laid down and drawn by this ingenious method. But the result o=
f all these noticed that=20

Little Russian women are always laughing or crying--no intermediate mood.  =
"One must confess=20

that to bury people like Byelikov is a great pleasure. As we were returning=
 from the cemetery we=20

wore discreet Lenten faces; no one wanted to display this feeling of pleasu=
re--a feeling like that we=20

had experienced long, long ago as children when our elders had gone out and=
 we ran about the=20

garden for an hour or two, enjoying complete freedom. Ah, freedom, freedom!=
 The merest hint, the=20

faintest hope of its possibility gives wings to the soul, does it not?  "We=
 returned from the cemetery=20

in a good humour. But not more than a week had passed before life went on a=

gloomy, oppressive, and senseless--a life not forbidden by government=20

are always divided into twelve equal parts. Omitting details, therefore,--n=

but lest I should prove tiresome by writing too much,--I will state by whom=
 the different classes and=20

designs of dials have been invented. For I cannot invent new kinds myself a=
t this late day, nor do I=20

think that I ought to display the inventions of others as my own. Hence, I =
will mention those that=20

have come down to us, and by whom they were invented.     CHAPTER VIII  SUN=

there will be!"  "That's just how it is," said Ivan Ivanovitch and he light=
ed his pipe.  "How many=20

more of them there will be!" repeated Burkin.  The schoolmaster came out of=
 the barn. He was a=20

short, stout man, completely bald, with a black beard down to his waist. Th=
e two dogs came out=20

with him.  "What a moon!" he said, looking upwards.  It was midnight. On th=

the whole village, a long street stretching far away for four miles. All wa=
s buried in deep silent=20

slumber; not a movement, not a sound; one could hardly believe that nature =
could be so still.=20

When on a moonlight night you see a broad village street, with its cottages=
, haystacks, and=20

slumbering willows, a feeling of calm comes over the soul; in this peace, w=

On the left the open country began from the end of the village; it could be=
