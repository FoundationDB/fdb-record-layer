philodendron monstera showed me Phaed and Merak, which mark the bottom of the bowl, and then Dubhe at the bowl's outer rim.  I tried hard, but I was very stupid about getting the names right. Then Gershom asked away into the woods and spend hours in study and thinking. He sat up late at night, and as light was expensive, made a blaze of shavings in the cooper's shop.

me, always, as long as I live. And some day, when you are a great man, and all the world is at 

your feet, I'm going to bring it to you and show it to you. For I know now that you are going to be a 

great man, and that your old mother is going to live to be so proud of you it'll make her heart ache 

with joy!"  He hugged me close, in a little back-wash of rapture, and then settled down on his 

pillows.  "I could do better ones than that," he finally said, with a glowing eye.  "Yes," I agreed. 

"They'll be better and better. And that'll make your old Mummsy prouder and prouder!"  He lay 

silent for several minutes. Then he looked at the square of paper which I held folded in my hand. 

"I'd like to send it to Uncle Peter," he rather startled me by saying.     _Saturday the Twenty-Ninth_ 

Once more I'm a grass widow. My Duncan is awa'. He scooted for Calgary as soon as his 

threshing-work was finished up. But that tumult is over and once more I've a chance to sit down 

and commune with my soul. Everything here is over-running with wheat. Our bins are bursting. 

The lord of the realm is secretly delighted, but he has said little about it. He has a narrow course 

village, and then turned adrift as being unfit company for the people of that settlement." If the 

stranger consented to race or wrestle, it was arranged that there should be foul play, which would 

lead to a fight; a proper display of mettle in which was accepted as a proof of the "gentleman's" 

fitness for society. Abe escaped initiation, his length and strength of limb being apparently deemed 

satisfactory evidence of his social respectability. But Clary's Grove was at last brought down upon 

him by the indiscretion of his friend and admirer, Offutt, who was already beginning to run him for 

President, and whose vauntings of his powers made a trial of strength inevitable. A wrestling 

match was contrived between Lincoln and Jack Armstrong, and money, jackknives and whiskey 

were freely staked on the result. Neither combatant could throw the other, and Abe proposed to 

Jack to "quit." But Jack, goaded on by his partisans, resorted to a "foul," upon which Abe's 

righteous wrath blazed up, and taking the champion of Clary's Grove by the throat he "shook him 

like a child." A fight was impending, and Abe, his back planted against Offutt's store, was facing a

this wheat will bring in to him, yet he can see it would never do to harp too loudly on the 

productiveness of our land--on _my_ land, I ought to say, for Casa Grande has now been formally 

deeded to me. I find no sense of triumph, however, in that transfer. I am depressed, in fact, at the 

very thought of it. It seems to carry a vague air of the valedictory. But I refuse to be intimidated by 

the future.  Gershom and I, indeed, have been indulging in the study of astronomy. The air was 

crystal clear last night, so that solemn youth suggested that we take out the old telescope and 

study the stars. Which we did. And which was much more wonderful than I had imagined. But 

Gershom had no reflector, so after getting a neck-ache trying to inspect the heavens while on our 

feet we took the old buffalo-robe and a couple of rugs out to a straw-pile that had been hauled in 

to protect our winter perennials. There we indecorously reposed on our backs and went stargazing 

in comfort. And Gershom even forgot that painful bashfulness of his when he fell to talking 

mediator appeared. Jack Armstrong was so satisfied of the strength of Abe's arm, that he at once 

declared him the best fellow that ever came into the settlement, and the two thenceforth reigned 

conjointly over the roughs and bullies of New Salem. Abe seems always to have used his power 

humanely and to have done his best to substitute arbitration for war. A strange man coming into 

the settlement, on being beset as usual by Clary's Grove and insulted by Jack Armstrong, knocked 

the bully down with a stick. Jack being as strong as two of him was going to "whip him badly," 

when Abe interposed, "Well Jack, what did you say to the man?" Jack repeated his words. "And 

what would you do if you were in a strange place and you were called a d--d liar?" "Whip him, by --

-." "Then that man has done to you no more than you have done to him." Jack acknowledged the 

golden rule and "treated" his intended victim. If there were ever dissensions between the two 

"Caesars" of Salem, it was because Jack "in the abundance of his animal spirits" was addicted to 

nailing

slipped out of his shell and spoke with genuine feeling.  He suggested that we begin with the Big 

Dipper, which I could locate easily enough well up in the northern sky. That, Gershom told me, 

was sometimes called the Great Bear, though it was only a part of the real _Ursa Major_ of the 

astronomers. Then he showed me Benetnasch at the end of the Dipper's handle, and Mizar at the 

bend in the handle, then Alioth, and then Megrez, which joins the on the side of mercy.  Abe's 

popularity grew apace; his ambition grew with it; it is astonishing how readily and freely the plant 

sprouts upon that soil. He was at this time carrying on his education evidently with a view to public 

life. Books were not easily found. He wanted to study English Grammar, considering that 

accomplishment desirable for a statesman; and, being told that there was a grammar in a house 

six miles from Salem, he left his
