slash from the sword of Abou Do, who, with great dexterity and speed, had closed in behind him, 

just in time to reach the leg. Unfortunately, he could not deliver the cut in the right place, as the 

elephant, with increased speed, completely distanced the aggageers; he charged across the deep 

sand, and reached the jungle. We were shortly upon his tracks, and after running about a quarter 

of a mile, he fell dead in a dry watercourse. His tusks were, like the generality of Abyssinian 

elephants, exceedingly short, but of good thickness.  Some of our men, who had followed the 

runaway horses, shortly returned, and reported that, during our fight with the  Nature had blessed 

Pal Gregorics with a freckly face and red hair, which made people quote the old saying, "Red-

haired people are never good."  So Pal Gregorics made up his mind to prove that it was untrue. All 

these old sayings are like pots in which generations have been cooking for ages, and Pal 

Gregorics intended to break one of them. He meant to be "as good as a piece of bread, and as

had heard other elephants trumpeting in the dense nabbuk jungle near the river. A portion of thick 

forest of about two hundred acres, upon this side of the river, was a tempting covert for elephants, 

and the aggageers, who were perfectly familiar with the habits of the animals, positively declared 

that the herd must be within this jungle. Accordingly, we proposed to skirt the margin of the river, 

which, as it made a bend at right studies, he went into a tobacconist's shop and bought some fine 

Havanas, which at once set all the tongues in Besztercebanya wagging.  "The good-for-nothing 

fellow smokes seven-penny cigars, does he? That is a nice way to begin. He'll die in the 

workhouse. Oh, if his poor dead father could rise from his grave and see him! Why, the old man 

used to mix dry potato leaves with his tobacco to make it seem more, and poured the dregs of
