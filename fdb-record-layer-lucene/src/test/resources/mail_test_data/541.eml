dracaena marginata still the one eternal Monad in the infinity of a Manvantara?" The answer to this is easy for the true Occultist, while for the uninitiated profane it must appear absurd. The to sleep here and to start again very early to-morrow. Eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage."  "The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on," replied Raoul, "that I dracaena marginata still the one eternal Monad in the infinity of a Manvantara?" The answer to this is easy for the true Occultist, while for the uninitiated profane it must appear absurd. The to sleep here and to start again very early to-morrow.

ascertained that while the body is acting--even though only mechanically--or resting in one place, 

its astral double may be appearing and acting independently in another, and very often distant 

place. This is quite a common occurrence in mystic life and history, and if this be so with ecstatics, 

Seers and Mystics of every description, why cannot the same thing happen on a higher and more 

spiritually developed plane of existence? Admit the possibility on the lower psychic plane, then 

why not on a higher plane? In the cases of higher Adeptship, when the body is entirely at the 

command of the Inner Man, when the Spiritual Ego is completely reuenited with its seventh 

principle even during the life-time of the personality, and the Astral Man or personal Ego has 

become so purified that he has gradually assimilated all the qualities and attributes of the middle 

nature (Buddhi and Manas in their terrestrial aspect) that personal Ego substitutes itself, so to say, 

for the spiritual Higher Self, and is thenceforth capable of living an independent life on earth; when 

corporeal death takes place the following mysterious event often happens. As a Dharmakaya, a 

Nirvani "without remains" entirely free from terrestrial admixture, the Spiritual Ego cannot return to 

reincarnate on earth. But in such cases, it is affirmed, the personal Ego of even a Dharmakaya 

can remain in our sphere as a whole, and return to incarnation on earth if need be. For now it can 

no longer be subject, like the astral remains of any ordinary man, to gradual dissolution in the 

Kama Loka (the _limbus_ or purgatory of the Roman Catholic, and the "Summer-land" of the 

Spiritualist); it cannot die a second death, as such disintegration is called by Proclus.(659) It has 

become too holy and pure, no longer by reflected but its own natural light and spirituality, either to 

sleep in the unconscious slumber of a lower Nirvanic state, or to be dissolved like any ordinary 

astral shell and disappear in its entirety.  But in that condition known as the Nirmanakaya [the 

Nirvani "with remains,"] he can still help humanity.  "Let me suffer and bear the sins of all [be 

reincarnated unto new misery] but let the world be saved!" was said by Gautama BUDDHA: an 

exclamation the wine to your servant, and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the 

bargain."  "Do as you like," said Raoul, who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular 

class of society, who, when there were robbers on the highroads, were connected with them, and 

who, since highwaymen no longer exist, have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place. 

The host, his mind at ease about his bill, placed pen, ink and paper upon the table. By a lucky 

chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to write. The host remained standing in front 

of him, looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face, combining both gravity 

and sweetness of expression. Beauty has always been and always will be all-powerful.  "He's not 

a guest like the other one here just now," observed mine host to Olivain, who had rejoined his 

master to see if he wanted anything, "and your young master has no appetite."  "My master had 

appetite enough three days ago, but what can one do? he lost it the day before yesterday."  And 

Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn, Olivain, according to the custom of 

serving-men well pleased with their place, relating to the tavern-keeper all that he could say in 

favor of the young gentleman; whilst Raoul wrote on thus:  "Sir,--After a four hours' march I stop to 

write to you, for I miss you every moment, and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to 

reply when you speak to me. I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at 

our separation, that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I 

feel toward you. You will forgive me, sir, for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can 

well understand all that has passed in mine. I entreat you to write to me, for you form a part of my 



existence, and, if I may venture to tell you so, I also feel anxious. It seemed to me as if you were 

yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking, about which I did not dare to question you, 

since you told me nothing. I have, therefore, as you see, great need of hearing from you. Now that 

you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring. You sustained me powerfully, sir, 

and I protest to you

will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"(660) asks the astral Jesus of Peter. "Till I come" 

means "till I am reincarnated again" in a physical body. Yet the Christ of the old crucified body 

could truly say: "I am with my Father and one with Him," which did not prevent the astral from 

taking a form again nor John from tarrying indeed till his Master had come; nor hinder John from 

failing to recognize him when he did come, or from then opposing him. But in the Church that 

remark generated the absurd idea of the millennium or chiliasm, in its physical sense.  Since then 

the "Man of Sorrows" has returned perchance, more than once, unknown to, and undiscovered by, 

his blind followers. Since then also, this grand "Son of God" has been incessantly and most cruelly 

crucified daily and hourly by the Churches founded in his name. But the Apostles, only half-

initiated, failed to tarry for their Master, and not recognizing him, spurned him every time he 

returned.(661)      SECTION XLII. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES.   The "Mystery of Buddha" is that of 

several other Adepts--perhaps of many. The whole trouble is to understand correctly that other 

mystery: that of the real fact, so abstruse and transcendental at first sight, about the "Seven 

Principles" in man, the reflections in man of the seven powers in Nature, physically, and of the 

seven Hierarchies of Being, intellectually and spiritually. Whether a man--material, ethereal, and 

spiritual--is for the clearer comprehension of his (broadly-speaking) triple nature, divided into 

groups according to one or another system, the foundation and the apex of that division will be 

always the same. There being Will you have the goodness, sir, should you receive news from 

Blois, to send me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere, about whose 

health, when we left, so much anxiety was felt? You can understand, honored and dear guardian, 

how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with 

you. I hope that you will sometimes, too, think of me, and if at certain hours you should miss me, if 

you should feel any slight regret at my absence, I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought 

that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself, and that I have been able to 

prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you."  After finishing this letter Raoul felt 

more composed; he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching 

him, whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper, a mute and touching caress, which the heart of 

Athos might well divine on opening the letter.  During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and 

eaten his pie; the horses were also refreshed. Raoul motioned to the host to approach, threw a 

crown upon the table, mounted his horse, and posted his letter at Senlis. The rest that had been 

thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace. At 

Verberie, Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding 

them; he had been observed to pass only three-quarters of an hour previously, but he was well 

mounted, as the tavern-keeper had already said, and rode at a rapid pace.  "Let us try and 

overtake this gentleman," said Raoul to Olivain; "like ourselves he is on 


_
Upadhis (bases) in man, any number of Koshas (sheaths) and their aspects may be built on these 

without destroying the harmony of the whole. Thus, while the Esoteric System accepts the 

septenary division, the Vedantic classification gives five Koshas, and the Taraka Raja Yoga 

simplifies them into four--the three Upadhis synthesized by the highest principle, Atma.  That 

which has just been stated will, of course, suggest the question: "How can a spiritual (or semi-

spiritual) personality lead a triple or even a dual life, company."  It was about four o'clock in the 

afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the 

young gentleman who was in advance of them. He had stopped, like Raoul, at the Hotel of the Bell 

and Bottle, the best at Compiegne; and had started again on his journey, saying that he should 

sleep at Noyon.  "Well, let us sleep at Noyon," said Raoul.  "Sir," replied Olivain, respectfully, 

"allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning. I think it
