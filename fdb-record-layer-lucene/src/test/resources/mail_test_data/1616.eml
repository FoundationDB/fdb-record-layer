n the shape of a seat=20

in the coffee-room whereon to pass the night, for indeed she had no bed to =
spare, and the man=20

from Chelwood brought up the rear--still ejaculating cries of astonishment =
rather than distress.=20

"You are that careless, man!" the woman admonished him placidly, "and I giv=
e you a lanthorn and=20

all for to look after your 'orzes properly."  "But you didn't give me a 'an=
d for to tie 'em up in their=20

stalls, and give 'em their feed. Drat 'em! I 'ate 'orzes and all to do with=
 'em."  "Didn't you give 'em=20

the feed I give you for 'em then?"  "No, I didn't. Think you I'd go into on=
e o' them narrow stalls and=20

get kicked for my pains."  "Then they was 'ungry, pore things," she conclud=
ed, "and went out after=20

the 'ay what's just outside. I don't know 'ow you'll ever get 'em back in t=
his fog."  There was indeed=20

no doubt that the nags had made their way out of the stables, in that irres=
ponsible fashion peculiar=20

to animals, and that they had gone astray in the dark. There certainly was =
no sound in the night to=20

denote their presence anywhere near.  "We'll get 'em all right in the morni=
ng," remarked the=20

woman with her exasperating placidity.  "To-morrow morning!" exclaimed Mart=
in-Roget in a=20

passion of fury. "And what the d----l am I going to do in the meanwhile?"  =
The woman reiterated=20

her offers of a seat by the fire in the coffee-room.  "The men won't mind y=
e, zir," she said, "heaps=20

of 'em are Frenchies like yourself, and I'll tell 'em you ain't a spying on=
 'em."  "It's no more than five=20

mile to Chelwood," said the man blandly, "and maybe you get a better shaked=
own there."  "A five-

mile tramp," growled Martin-Roget, whose wrath seemed to have spent itself =
before the=20

hopelessness of his the last spoonful of robbiboo, the last limb of duck an=
d the last mug of tea.=20

Such a remark at such a period in the entertainment caused Billie to laugh.=
  "Why, Archie, you've=20

been at work this half-hour, and there's nothing left to go to work upon no=
w."  "You know quite=20

well, Little Bill, that I refer to the _day's_ work. What is it to be?  Pro=
visions must be got if the camp=20

is not to starve, and you and I are bound to do our share.  Shall we go to =
Willow Point and shoot=20

ducks and geese, or cross the lake and trawl for fish?"  "Both," answered t=
he invalid with decision.=20

"We'll do both.  We will paddle to Willow Point, and try for jack-fish on t=
he way."  "Just so--the very=20

thing, Little Bill.  Are you ready to start?"  Billie professed himself qui=
te ready.  Archie took him on=20

his back, replaced him in the stern of the canoe in company with the big st=
one, and then stepped=20

gently into his own place at the bow, where a common trading gun, with the =
old-fashioned flint lock=20

and single barrel, rested against the gunwale.  Pushing off they soon left =
Breakfast-isle far behind=20

them, and crept swiftly along by the margin of the reeds.  On the way Billi=
e cast out his fishing-line.=20

It was a strong cod-line, with a great cod-hook attached and a lump of fat =
pork on it; for Archie, in=20

the fervour of hope coupled with piscatorial ignorance and a sanguine dispo=
sition, had strongly=20

advised his brother to err, if err he must, on the safe side, and be prepar=
ed for anything, from a=20

great lake-serpent to a fresh-water whale.  No civilised fish would have de=
igned to give a second=20

thought to the obvious deception which a mass of indigestible pork presente=
d, but fish of the=20

backwoods--especially in the early years of this century--were not suspicio=
us.  An enormous pike,=20

or "jack-fish,"=20


_
gloom, and knee-deep in mud.... There'll be a sovereign for you, woman," he=
 added curtly, "if you=20

can give me a clean bed for the night."  The woman hesitated for a second o=
r two.  "Well! a=20

zovereign is tempting, zir," she said at last. "You shall 'ave my son's bed=
. I know 'e'd rather 'ave=20

the zovereign if 'e was ever zo tired. took it.  Not only so, but it took t=
he great cod-hook and ten=20

inches of the line besides.  A shout such as Billie had not uttered for man=
y months announced the=20

fact.  "Hi! hold on, Archie!  Back water!  I say, I'd believe I had hanked =
the bottom if it didn't tug in=20

such a lively way!"  "Pay out line, Little Bill!" cried the=20


_
house, "mind them 'urdles there."  "And where am I goin' to zleep?" called =
the man from Chelwood=20

after the two retreating figures.  "I'll look after the man for you, zir," =
said the woman; "for a matter=20

of a shillin' 'e can sleep in the coffee-room, and I'll give 'im 'is breakf=
ast too."  "Not one farthing will=20

I pay for the idiot," retorted Martin-Roget savagely. "Let him look after h=
imself."  He had once more=20

reached the porch. Without another word, and not heeding the protests and c=
urses of the=20

unfortunate man whom he had left standing shelterless in the middle of the =
yard, he pushed open=20

the front door of the house and once more found himself in the passage outs=
ide the coffee-room.=20

But the woman had turned back a little before she followed her guest into t=
he house, and she=20

called out to the man in the darkness:  "You may zleep in any of them outho=
uses and welcome,=20

and zure there'll be a bit o' porridge for ye in the mornin'!"  "Think ye I=
'll stop," came in a furious=20

growl out of the gloom, "and conduct that d----d frogeater back to Chelwood=
? No fear. Five miles=20

with blazing eyes, but unable to render any assistance owing to the small s=
ize and crank nature of=20

the canoe.  "Stay, I'll turn about and become steersman, while you play the=
--whew!  It's a whale!  I=20

say--ease off!"  "Ease off!" cried Billie in desperation; "how can I ease o=
ff, with only a few yards o'=20

the line left?"  "Pitch the reel back to me then.  I'll manage it!" cried A=
rchie, who had converted the=20

bow of the canoe into the stern--both ends being alike--by the simple proce=
ss of turning himself=20

round and sitting with his face towards his brother.  What Archie had style=
d the reel was simply a=20

piece of stick with the line wound round it.  His brother pitched it to him=
 with one hand while the=20

desperate jerking of the other--indeed of his whole body--told at once of t=
he size and the=20

impatience of the fish.  Unwinding the line in haste, Archie fastened the e=
xtreme end of it to two=20

spare paddles and flung them overboard.  "Now, Little Bill," he said; "you =
may let him have his=20

head, and if you can't hold on without risking the line just let it go."  A=
s he spoke the=20


_
ain't nothin' to me, and 'e can keep the miserable shillin' 'e'd 'ave give =
me for my pains. Let 'im get=20

'is 'orzes back 'izelf and get to Chelwood as best 'e can. I'm off, and you=
 can tell 'im zo from me.=20

It'll make 'im sleep all the better, I reckon."  The woman was obviously no=
t of a the pike is a=20

sluggish creature in all waters--but with a steady persistency that meant r=
esolution of purpose.  In=20

a few seconds our invalid was compelled to let go, and, the line tightening=
, the paddles=20

disappeared with a jerk.  Soon after they reappeared, and the boys paddled =
towards them=20
