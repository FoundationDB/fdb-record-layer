 himself _
that she could only hold on with both hands.  "Stop them! Stop them!" she c=
ried.  But that was=20

much easier said than done. The animals had been willing enough to start wh=
en given the word by=20

a stranger; but now they did not recognize their master's voice when the bo=
y yelled:  "Yea-a! Yea-

a!"  Instead of stopping, the mules went faster and faster. They had their =
bits 'twixt their teeth and=20

were running away in good earnest.  Almost immediately, when the bumping an=
d jouncing wagon=20

got away from the store and the two or three neighboring houses, they were =
in the deep woods.=20

There were no farms--no clearings--not even an open patch in the timber. Th=
e snow lay deep=20

under the pines and firs. The road had been used considerably since the las=
t snow, and the ruts=20

were deep. Therefore the mules kept to the beaten track.  "Oh, stop them! s=
top them!" moaned=20

Ruth, clinging to the swaying, jouncing cart.  "I can't! I can't!" repeated=
 the terrified boy.  "Oh, you=20

wicked, wicked boy! you'll kill us both!" cried Ruth.  "It's your own fault=
 you're here," returned Fred,=20

sharply. "And I wouldn't never have got onto the wagon if you hadn't chased=
 me."  "I believe you=20

are the very worst boy who ever lived!" declared nights past he had been in=
 the habit of doing, and=20

began to pace up and down his room. The house was all buried in repose and =
silence--the woods=20

rustling round, the river flowing, the silence outside tingling with the ne=
ver altogether hushed=20

movements of nature; but indoors nothing stirring--all dark; nothing but th=
e heavy breath of sleep=20

within the thick old walls. The fire was dying out on the hearth; the candl=
es, which he lighted=20

hastily, did not half light the room, but rather cleared a little spot in t=
he darkness, and left all else in=20

gloom. A nervous tremor was upon the young man,--he to whom nerves had been=
 all folly, who=20

had scoffed at them as affectation or weakness; but he had no longer that c=
ommand of himself of=20

which he had once been proud. His mind strayed involuntarily into thoughts =
which he would fain=20

have shut out. They dwelt upon one subject and one scene, which he had shut=
 his mind to a=20

hundred times, only to feel it the next moment once more absorbing every fa=
culty. His shadow=20

upon the window paced up and down, up and down. He could not keep quiet. He=
 did not care to=20

have the door of his room behind him, but kept it in sight as if he feared =
being taken at a=20

disadvantage. What=20


_
girl from the Red Mill, in both anger and despair. "And I wish I had let yo=
u go your own wicked=20

way."  "I wish you had," growled Hatfield, and then tried to soothe the run=
ning mules again.  He=20

was successful in the end. He had driven mules before and understood them. =
The beasts, after=20

traveling at least two miles, began to slow down. The wagon was now passing=
 through a wild=20

piece of the forest, and it was growing dark very fast. Only the snow on th=
e ground made it=20

possible for the boy and girl to see objects at a distance.  Ruth was wonde=
ring what her friends=20

would think when they missed her, and likewise how she would ever get back =
to the railroad.=20

Would Mr. Cameron send back for her? What would happen to her, here in the =
deep woods, even=20

when the mules stopped so that she dared leap down from the cart?  And just=
 then--before these=20

questions became very pertinent in her mind--she was startled by a wild scr=
eam from the bush=20

patch beside the road. Fred cried out in new alarm, and the mules stopped d=
ead-- for a moment.=20

They were trembling and tossing their heads wildly. The awful, blood-chilli=
ng scream was=20

repeated, and there was the soft thudding of cushioned paws in the bushes. =
Some beast had=20

leaped down from a tree-branch to the hard snow.  "A cat-o'-mountain!" yell=
ed Fred Hatfield, and=20

as he shouted, the lithe cat sprang over the brush heap and landed in the r=
oad, right beside the=20

timber cart.  Once Ruth had been into the menagerie seized hold upon him--h=
e who had never=20

known what imagination was. He could not rest for it. The quiet was full of=
 noises. He heard the=20

furniture creaking, as it does at night, the walls giving out strange echoe=
s; and never having kept=20

any vigil before, thought that these strange voices of the night had to do =
with himself, and in his=20

soul trembled as if he had been surrounded by enemies or spies searching hi=
s inmost thoughts.=20

Thus he walked up and down the room, keeping his face to the door. Did he e=
xpect any one,=20

anything to come in? No, no; nothing of the kind. But it is certain that so=
metimes along the long=20

passage he heard sounds as of a horse's hoofs. He knew it was nonsense. It =
was the sound of the=20

river, to which he was perfectly accustomed; but yet it sounded somehow lik=
e a horse's hoofs. He=20

never would have been surprised at any moment to see the door pushed open a=
nd something=20

come in. He knew it was ridiculous, but still he could not help the feeling=
. And the silence of the=20

house was a pain to him beyond telling. One of these nights one of the serv=
ants had been ill, and=20

Rintoul was glad. The sense that some one was waking, moving about, was a r=
elief. It seemed=20

somehow to give him a sort of security,--to deliver him from himself. But w=
hile he thus felt the=20

advantage of waking humanity near him, he was thankful beyond description t=
hat the society of=20

the house was diminished--that his mother and Edith were away. He knew that=
=20


_
come to Darrowtown while her father was still alive. She had seen there a p=
anther, and the=20

wicked, graceful, writhing body of the beast had frightened her more than t=
he bulk of the elephant=20

or the roaring of the lion. This great cat, crouching close to the snow, it=
s tail sweeping from side to=20

side, all its muscles knotted for another spring, struck Ruth dumb and help=
less.  Fortunately her=20

gloved hands were locked about the timber on which she lay, for the next in=
stant a third savage=20

scream parted the bewhiskered lips of the catamount and on the heels of the=
 cry the mules started=20

at full gallop. The panther sprang into the air like a rubber ball. Had the=
 mules not started the beast=20

must have landed fairly upon the boy and the girl clinging to the reach of =
the timber wagon.  But=20

out--if not what was in his mind, at least that there was something on his =
mind. During the last=20

twenty-four hours particularly they would have been worse spies than the tr=
ees and the winds.=20

How could he have kept himself to himself in their presence, especially as =
they would have=20

besieged him with questions, with incitements to do something. They would h=
ave assumed that=20

they knew all about it in their ignorance. They! They were always assuming =
that they knew. There=20

was a fierce momentary satisfaction in Rintoul's mind to think how complete=
ly out they would be,=20

how incapable of understanding the real state of the case. They thought the=
y knew everything! But=20

he felt that there was a possibility that he might have betrayed himself in=
 the very pleasure he=20

would have had in showing them that=20
