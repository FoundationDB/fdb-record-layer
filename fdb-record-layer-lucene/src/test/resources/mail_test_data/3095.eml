philodendron monstera for hire, the smiling women who thrust forward baskets of oranges for sale, the beguiling children who held out little brown hands and begged for _soldi_ (halfpennies), and the post-card Cordillera of the Andes, afford striking proofs of the justness of this assertion.  Till the middle of the last century, the mountains round the valleys of Aragua were covered with forests. philodendron monstera for hire, the smiling women who thrust forward baskets of oranges for sale, the beguiling children who held out little brown hands and begged for _soldi_ (halfpennies), and the post-card Cordillera of the Andes, afford striking proofs of the justness of this assertion.

grumble. I've got an exeat and I didn't expect it, and I'm going off my head a little. That's all! Don't 

worry yourselves about me. I'm sane at the bottom."  With Peachy and Delia prancing about and 

hardly able to regulate their satisfaction the expedition promised to be a lively one, though the 

harum-scarum pair calmed down in the presence of Miss Bickford, and assumed a deportment of 

due decorum. The favored twelve were half seniors and half Transition, the remaining pair of the 

latter consisting of Bertha Ford and Mabel Hughes. The Camellia Buds exchanged eloquent 

glances at the sight of their arch-enemies, but wisely forbore to make any provocative remarks; 

Delia indeed even murmured something pleasant about the excursion to which Bertha grunted a 

reply, so the party started off in apparent harmony.  Antonio, with his big key, unlocked the great 

gate, they filed through into the eucalyptus-shaded road, and in ten minutes they had left the quiet 

school behind them, and were down in the gay little town of Fossato. It was new and wonderful to 

Irene. The wide main street with its intense brilliant sunshine contrasting with the deep shade of 

the narrow side streets, the open shop-fronts with their displays of picturesque wares, the stalls of 

fruit and vegetables sold by quaint country vendors, the balconies full of flowers, the kindly, dark-

eyed, smiling people, the pretty peasant children clattering about in heelless wooden shoes, the 

brightly painted carts and the horses decorated with flowers and feathers as if for a perpetual May 

Day, all made up a scene that was more like a portion of a play than a piece of real life, and made 

her almost able to imagine herself upon the stage of a theater. They had reached a great square, 

where leafless trees were covered with a beautiful purple blossom, something like mezereon. 

From a marble fountain bareheaded women, with exquisitely arranged dark tresses and bright 

level, when they communicate by a lateral channel.  The changes which the destruction of forests, 

the clearing of plains, and the cultivation of indigo, have produced within half a century in the 

quantity of water flowing in on the one hand, and on the other the evaporation of the soil, and the 

dryness of the atmosphere, present causes sufficiently powerful to explain the progressive 

diminution of the lake of Valencia. I cannot concur in the opinion of M. Depons* (who visited these 

countries since I was there) "that to set the mind at rest, and for the honour of science," a 

subterranean issue must be admitted. (* In his Voyage a la Terre Ferme M. Depons says, "The 

small extent of the surface of the lake renders impossible the supposition that evaporation alone, 

however considerable within the tropics, could remove as much water as the rivers furnish." In the 

sequel, the author himself seems to abandon what he terms "this occult case, the hypothesis of an 

aperture.") By felling the trees which cover the tops and the sides of mountains, men in every 

climate prepare at once two calamities for future generations; want of fuel and scarcity of water. 

Trees, by the nature of their perspiration, and the radiation from their leaves in a sky without 

clouds, surround themselves with an atmosphere constantly cold and misty. They affect the 

copiousness of springs, not, as was long believed, by a peculiar attraction for the vapours diffused 

through the air, but because, by sheltering the soil from the direct action of the sun, they diminish 

the evaporation of water produced by rain. When forests are destroyed, as they are everywhere in 

America by the European planters, with imprudent precipitancy, the springs are entirely dried up, 

or become less abundant. The beds of the rivers, remaining dry during a part of the year, are 

converted into torrents whenever great rains fall on the heights. As the sward and moss disappear

drawing water in brass pitchers, and chattering the soft southern dialect with the pretty tuneful 

Neapolitan voices that speak like singing and sing like opera. An equestrian statue of Garibaldi 

stood on a pedestal in the midst of a flowerbed of gay geraniums, and below, in the shadow, a 

military officer, with a gorgeous pale blue cloak draped over one shoulder, was talking to two 

Italian soldiers whose plumed hats were adorned with shining cocks' feathers.  Miss Bickford, in 

the van of the Villa Camellia queue, strode on, taking no notice, beyond a firm shake of the head, 

of the various sides of the mountains, the waters falling in rain are no longer impeded in their 

course; and instead of slowly augmenting the level of the rivers by progressive filtrations, they 

furrow, during heavy showers, the sides of the hills, bearing down the loosened soil, and forming 

sudden and destructive inundations. Hence it results, that the clearing of forests, the want of 

permanent springs, and the existence of torrents, are three phenomena closely connected 

together. Countries situated in opposite hemispheres, as, for example, Lombardy bordered by the 

Alps, and Lower Peru inclosed between the
