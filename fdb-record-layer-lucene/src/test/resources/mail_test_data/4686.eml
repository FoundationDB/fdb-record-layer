philodendron monstera treatise will be better informed in advance, and able=
 to select, among the different kinds, those which will be of use in their =
works. Therefore, since the preliminaries have been explained, the building=
s themselves will be treated in the that I subscribe five thousand, and to =
give her some advice about the organization, and to warn her that her inexp=
erience in such a complicated and responsible matter might lead to most lam=
entable results. In short, I wanted to see my wife, philodendron monstera t=
reatise will be better informed in advance, and able to select, among the d=
ifferent kinds, those which will be of use in their works. Therefore, since=
 the preliminaries have been explained, the buildings themselves will be tr=
eated in the that I subscribe five thousand, and to give her some advice ab=
out the organization, and to warn her that her inexperience in such a compl=
icated and responsible matter might lead to most lamentable results. In sho=
rt, I wanted to see my wife, _
Caesar, being with his army in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and having or=
dered the towns to=20

furnish supplies, the inhabitants of a fortified stronghold there, called L=
arignum, trusting in the=20

natural strength of their defences, refused to obey his command. So the gen=
eral ordered his=20

forces to the assault. In front of the gate of this stronghold there was a =
tower, made of beams of=20

this wood laid in alternating directions at right angles to each other, lik=
e a funeral pyre, and built=20

high, so that they could drive off an attacking party by throwing stakes an=
d stones from the top.=20

When it was observed that they had no other missiles than stakes, and that =
these could not be=20

hurled very far from the wall on account of the weight, orders were given t=
o approach and to throw=20

bundles of brushwood and lighted torches at this outwork. These the wife co=
uld now stop=20

ourselves; and that next day or the day after, the outburst of hatred would=
, as I knew by=20

experience of past years, be followed by something revolting which would up=
set the whole order of=20

our lives. "So it seems that during these two years we have grown no wiser,=
 colder, or calmer," I=20

thought as I began walking about the rooms. "So there will again be tears, =
outcries, curses,=20

packing up, going abroad, then the continual sickly fear that she will disg=
race me with some=20

coxcomb out there, Italian or Russian, refusing a passport, letters, utter =
loneliness, missing her,=20

and in five years old age, grey hairs." I walked about, imagining what was =
really impossible--her,=20

grown handsomer, stouter, embracing a man I did not know. By now convinced =
that that would=20

certainly happen, "'Why," I asked myself, "Why, in one of our=20


_
16. The flames soon kindled the brushwood which lay about that wooden struc=
ture and, rising=20

towards heaven, made everybody think that the whole pile had fallen. But wh=
en the fire had=20

burned itself out and subsided, and the tower appeared to view entirely uni=
njured, Caesar in=20

amazement gave orders that they should be surrounded with a palisade, built=
 beyond the range of=20

missiles. So the townspeople were frightened into surrendering, and were th=
en asked where that=20

wood came from which was not harmed by fire. They pointed to trees of the k=
ind under discussion,=20

of which there are very great numbers in that vicinity. And so, as that str=
onghold was called=20

Larignum, the wood was called larch. It is transported by way of the Po to =
Ravenna, and is to be=20

had in Fano, Pesaro, Ancona, and the other towns in that neighbourhood. If =
there were only a=20

ready method of carrying this material to Rome, it would be of the greatest=
 use in buildings; if not=20

for general purposes, yet at least if the boards used in the eaves running =
round blocks of houses=20

were made of it, the buildings would be free from the danger of fire spread=
ing across to them,=20

because such boards can neither take fire from flames or from burning coals=
, nor ignite=20

spontaneously.  17. The leaves of these trees are like those of the pine; t=
imber from them comes=20

in long lengths, is as easily wrought in joiner's work as is the clearwood =
of fir, and contains a liquid=20

resin, of the colour of Attic honey, which is good for consumptives.  With =
regard to the different=20

kinds of timber, I have now explained of what natural properties they appea=
r to be composed, and=20

how they were produced. It remains to consider the question why the highlan=
d fir, as it is called in=20

Rome, is inferior, while the lowland fir is extremely useful in buildings s=
o far as durability is=20

concerned; and further to explain how it is that their bad or good qualitie=
s seem to be due to the=20

peculiarities of their neighbourhood, so that this subject may be clearer t=
o those who examine it.=20

CHAPTER X  HIGHLAND AND LOWLAND FIR   1. The first spurs of the Apennines a=
rise from the=20

Tuscan sea between the Alps and the most distant borders of Tuscany. The mo=
untain range itself=20

bends round and, almost touching the shores of the Adriatic in the middle o=
f the curve, completes=20

its circuit by extending to the strait on the other shore. Hence, this side=
 of the curve, sloping=20

towards the districts of Tuscany and Campania, lies basking in the sun, bei=
ng constantly exposed=20

to the full force of its rays all day. But the further side, sloping toward=
s the Upper Sea and having a=20

northern exposure, is constantly shrouded in shadowy darkness. Hence the tr=
ees which grow on=20

that side, being nourished by the moisture, not only themselves attain to a=
 very large size, but their=20

fibre too, filled full of moisture, is swollen and distended with abundance=
 of liquid. When they lose=20

their vitality after being felled and hewn, the fibre retains its stiffness=
, and the trees as they dry=20

become hollow and frail on account of their porosity, and hence cannot last=
 when used in=20

buildings.  2. But trees which grow in places facing the course of the sun =
are not of porous fibre=20

but are solid, being drained by the dryness; for the sun absorbs not at tha=
t time left me altogether?=20

I should not have had this yearning for her now, this hatred, this anxiety;=
 and I should have lived=20

out my life quietly, working and not worrying about anything."  A carriage =
with two lamps drove into=20

the yard, then a big sledge with three horses. My wife was evidently having=
 a party.  Till midnight=20

everything was quiet downstairs and I heard nothing, but at midnight there =
was a sound of moving=20

chairs and a clatter of crockery. So there was supper. Then the chairs move=
d again, and through=20

the floor I heard a noise; they seemed to be shouting hurrah. Marya Gerasim=
ovna was already=20

asleep and I was quite alone in the whole upper storey; the portraits of my=
 forefathers, cruel,=20

insignificant people, looked at me from the walls of the drawing-room, and =
the reflection of my=20



lamp in the window winked unpleasantly. And with a feeling of jealousy and =
envy for what was=20

going on downstairs, I listened and thought: "I am master here; if I like, =
I can in a moment turn out=20

all that fine crew." But I knew that all that was nonsense, that I could no=
t turn out any one, and the=20

word "master" had no meaning. One may think oneself master, married, rich, =
a kammer-junker, as=20

much as one likes, and at the same time not know what it means.  After supp=
er some one=20

downstairs began singing in a tenor voice.  "Why, nothing special has happe=
ned," I tried to=20

persuade myself. "Why am I so upset? I won't go downstairs tomorrow, that's=
 all; and that will be=20

the end of our quarrel."  At a quarter past one I went to bed.  "Have the v=
isitors downstairs gone?"=20

I asked Alexey as he was undressing me.  "Yes, sir, they've gone."  "And wh=
y were they shouting=20

hurrah?"  "Alexey Dmitritch Mahonov subscribed for the famine fund a thousa=
nd bushels of flour=20

and a thousand roubles. And the old lady--I don't know her name--promised t=
o set up a soup=20

kitchen on her estate to feed a hundred and fifty people. Thank God... Nata=
lya Gavrilovna has=20

been pleased to arrange that all the gentry should assemble every Friday." =
 "To assemble here,=20

downstairs?"  "Yes, sir. Before supper they read a list: since August up to=
 today Natalya=20

Gavrilovna has collected eight thousand roubles, besides corn. Thank God...=
. What I think is that if=20

our mistress does take trouble for the salvation of her soul, she will soon=
 collect a lot. There are=20

plenty of rich people here."  Dismissing Alexey, I put out the light and dr=
ew the bedclothes over my=20

head.  "After all, why am I so troubled?" I thought. "What force draws me t=
o the starving peasants=20

like a butterfly to a flame? I don't know them, I don't understand them; I =
have never seen them and=20

I don't like them. Why this uneasiness?"  I suddenly crossed myself under t=
he quilt.  "But what a=20

woman she is!" I said to myself, thinking of my wife. "There's a regular co=
mmittee held in the=20

house without my knowing. Why this secrecy? Why this conspiracy? What have =
I done to them?=20

Ivan Ivanitch is right--I must go away."  Next morning I woke up firmly res=
olved to go away. The=20

events of the previous day--the conversation at tea, my wife, Sobol, the su=
pper, my=20

apprehensions--worried me, and I felt glad to think of getting away from th=
e surroundings which=20

reminded me of all that. While I was drinking my coffee=20


_
The trees in sunny neighbourhoods, therefore, being solidified by the compa=
ct texture of their=20

fibre, and not being porous from moisture, are very useful, so far as durab=
ility goes, when they are=20

hewn into timber. Hence the lowland firs, being conveyed from sunny places,=
 are better than those=20

highland firs, which are brought here from shady places.  3. To the best of=
 my mature=20

consideration, I have now treated the materials which are necessary in the =
construction of=20

buildings, the proportionate amount of the elements which are seen to be co=
ntained in their natural=20

composition, and the points of excellence and defects of each kind, so that=
 they may be not=20

unknown to those who are engaged in building. Thus those who can agreeable =
item he saved for=20

the last.  "The thieves who stole our rye have been found," he announced wi=
th a smile. "The=20

magistrate arrested three peasants at Pestrovo yesterday."  "Go away!" I sh=
outed at him; and a=20

propos of nothing, I picked up the cake-basket and flung it on the floor.  =
IV  After lunch I rubbed my=20

hands, and thought I must go to my wife and tell her that I was going away.=
 Why? Who cared?=20

Nobody cares, I answered, but why shouldn't I tell her, especially as it wo=
uld give her nothing but=20

pleasure? Besides, to go away after our yesterday's quarrel without saying =
a word would not be=20

quite tactful: she might think that I was frightened of her, and perhaps th=
e thought that she has=20

driven me out of my house=20
