s well as from the=20

preceding arguments, it plainly appears, that thou art bounden to do the ju=
stice required by my=20

lady of Orleans.  =E2=80=98I shall now demonstrate the crime of our adversa=
ry, and how he perpetrated=20

such an unpardonable deed, to which I shall add six arguments to prove the =
fealty and loyalty of=20

my lord of Orleans, taking for my theme the words of the advocate of our op=
ponent,=E2=80=94namely,=20

=E2=80=98Radix omnium malorum cupiditas.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98It seems to me,=
 that covetousness has been the original=20

cause of this murder,=E2=80=94not covetousness of wealth alone, but likewis=
e covetousness of honours=20

and ambition.=E2=80=94Covetousness has then been the original cause, as sha=
ll more plainly be shown=20

hereafter.  =E2=80=98To prove the greatness and abomination of this crime, =
I shall use six arguments. The=20

first is founded are usually directed from left to right, and they may be d=
irected from above=20

downward or in the opposite direction. Oblique wounds from above downward m=
ay be either=20

suicidal or homicidal; those directed from below upward are almost always h=
omicidal.  When a=20

wound is caused by an instrument both cutting and puncturing, suicide canno=
t be admitted unless=20

the direction of the wound is compatible with that which the weapon which i=
nflicted the wound,=20

held in the hand of the deceased, might cause. Taylor recommends to place t=
he weapon in the=20

hand of the deceased to see if the direction of the wound could possibly co=
rrespond with that=20

which could be taken by the weapon in the hand of the deceased with any pos=
ition possible for the=20

arm and hand. Therefore certain wounds by position and direction exclude su=
icide, but if a wound=20

is possibly suicidal it is also=20

authority of a judge over the deceased.  =E2=80=98Secondly, Supposing he ma=
y have had any authority=20

over him, he proceeded in his own way, contrary to every maxim of law and o=
f justice.  =E2=80=98My third=20

argument is grounded on the strict alliance that had been formed  Though su=
icidal wounds vary,=20

the above points are sometimes of real assistance in distinguishing between=
 suicide and homicide,=20

especially if the body has not been moved.  =3DEvidence Furnished by the Nu=
