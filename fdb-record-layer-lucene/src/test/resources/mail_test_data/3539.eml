man alone has often=20

been sufficient to incite a sedition in the minds of various parties or cas=
tes in those islands; and in=20

any case it is very dangerous to entrust positions of command to persons wh=

in all branches of the administration and government of those islands to an=
y other cause than the=20

injudicious selection of many of their employees. The military corps, whose=
 former captains and=20

subalterns had been mainly sergeants sent from the Peninsula, were kept in =
the best order and=20

d bodies, and excel in=20

discretion and ability, and in the art of governing, and of promoting the w=
elfare of a country, rather=20

than in the military art. The intendants should be "enlightened economists,=
 capable of creating and=20

promoting the great wealth of which that virgin country is capable." The of=
ficials of the Audiencia=20

should be at least thirty-five years old, with ten years of service, and ex=
perienced in legal practice;=20

case of earthquakes the reverse is the rule; none dread them more than thos=
