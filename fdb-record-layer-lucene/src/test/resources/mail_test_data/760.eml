guarantee have we that we won't be compelled to go all the way?"  The fine-=
lined wrinkles were=20

appearing again at the corners of the hereditary Blount eyes.  "You can't q=
uite rise to the occasion,=20

can you, Hardwick?" smiled the boss. "You'd like to behave yourself and be =
good, of course; but=20

you want to be cocksure beforehand that it isn't going to cost too much."  =
"Well, anyway, I'm going=20

to ask for a little time in which to consider it," was the vice-president's=
 final word.  "Sure! You have=20

all the time there is between now and the election. Go on and do your consi=
dering. I've told you=20

what I'm going to do."  "You know very well that we can't allow you to do w=
hat you propose. With=20

an unfriendly attorney-general we might as well throw up our hands first as=
 last."  "All right; it's=20

right pointedly up to you," was the calm reply.  The vice-president rose an=
d dusted the cigar-ash=20

from his coat-sleeve with the table-napkin. When he looked up, the heavy fr=
own was again=20

furrowing itself between his eyes.  "Let me know when your son is coming an=
d I'll try to make it=20

possible to meet him here," he said rather gratingly.  And thus, at the pre=
cise moment when=20

Richard Gantry, some three thousand miles away to the eastward, was declari=
ng his weariness=20

and his intention of going to bed, the two-man conference in the Inter-Moun=
tain private dining-

room was closed.     III  A FALSE GALLOP OF MEMORIES   As a churlish fate d=
ecreed, it turned=20

out that Evan Blount was not to have Gantry for a travelling companion beyo=
nd Chicago. On the=20

second day of westward faring the railroad traffic manager, whose business =
The craft looked=20

smaller than the ship, and in another quarter of an hour he was convinced t=
hat she was the pirate.=20

Then he hastened to the cabin, and announced the news to the captain, and L=
ouis heard him.=20

"Are you sure it is the pirate, Flix?" demanded Captain Scott, as he sprang=
 from his bed and=20

looked eagerly into the face of the messenger.  "Not absolutely sure; only =
reasonably confident,"=20

replied Felix, as he followed the captain to the forecastle.  Scott examine=
d the distant sail with the=20

glass for a little time, and Louis did the same with another. Morris was ar=
oused by the voices, and=20

rushed out with his field-glass.  "That's the pirate!" exclaimed the captai=
n; and the others had=20

waited for him to express his opinion.  "If my mother should step on deck a=
nd tell me so, I=20

shouldn't know it any better," added Felix; and Louis and Morris were equal=
ly sure of the fact.  "Go=20

to the engine-room, Morris, and tell Felipe to stir up his fires," said the=
 captain, who had suddenly=20

become a mass of vim and activity. "Then call all hands."  Scott observed t=
he approaching=20

steamer with his glass till she was within three miles of the Maud. Morris =
had been ordered to set=20

the American flag, and it was now floating in the light breeze at the ensig=
n staff.  "Now all hands=20

will come with me," continued the captain; and all but Felipe followed him =
to the cabin.  His first=20

movement was to throw off the cushions from the divan on the port side, and=
 raise the lid of the=20

transom. From this place he took out a breech-loading rifle, one of half a =
dozen deposited there=20

three months or more before. They had been=20


_
him like an implacable Nemesis wherever he went, had wire instructions to s=
top and confer with=20

his vice-president in the Illinois metropolis. Hence, on the morning of the=
 following day, Blount=20

continued his journey alone.  Twenty-odd hours later the returning expatria=
te had crossed his=20

Rubicon; in other words, his train had rolled through the majestic steel br=
idge spanning the clay-

colored flood of the Missouri River at Omaha, and he was entering upon scen=
es which ought to=20

have been familiar--which should have been and were not, so many and striki=
ng were the changes=20

Samothraki on the Maud in Pournea Bay, and had never been removed. No one a=
sked any=20

questions; and the captain ordered them to be conveyed to the pilot-house a=
nd engine-room,=20

where they would be available for immediate use. A supply of cartridges was=
 also sent forward,=20

and those who had revolvers were instructed to put them in their pockets.  =
All these orders were=20

promptly obeyed, and the situation began to look decidedly warlike. Louis c=
ould not help asking=20

himself whether or not Captain Scott was not proceeding too rapidly. But th=
e belligerent chief had=20

Captain=20


_
been wrought during his fourteen years of absence.  Though he was far enoug=
h from realizing it,=20

his education and the Eastern environment had given him a touch of Old-Worl=
d insularity. The=20

through sleeper in which he had his allotment of space was well filled, and=
 there were the usual=20

opportunities for the making of passing acquaintanceships in the smoking-co=
mpartment. But it was=20

not until the second day, after the dining-car luncheon and its aftermath o=
f a well-chosen cigar had=20

broken down some of the barriers of the acquired reserve, that he fell into=
 talk with the room for a=20

protest. Everything appeared to be ready to give the pirate a warm receptio=
n, and nothing more=20

could be done.  The Moorish steamer was feeling her way into the bay very s=
lowly, sounding all=20

the time. The Maud was anchored in fourteen feet of water, which placed her=
 keel very near the=20

rocky bottom, and with no greater depth for a cable's length outside of her=
. Scott had chosen the=20

position of the little steamer so that the Fatime could not come alongside =
of her, or within a cable's=20

length of her, which is one-fifth of a nautical mile.  "I think we are all =
right now,=20


_
who had seized upon the only chair in the smoking-compartment--a man whose =
thin, hawk-like=20

face, narrowly set eyes, and uneasy manner were singularly out of keeping w=
ith the fashionable=20

cut of his clothes, with his liberal tips, and with the display of jewelry =
on his watch-fob.  At first the=20

conversation was baldly desultory, as it was bound to be, with an escaped l=
over, whose=20

disappointment was still rasping him like a newly devised Nessus shirt, to =
sustain an undivided=20

half of it. The hawk-faced one, who had boarded the train at Omaha and whos=
e section was=20

directly opposite Blount's, defined himself as a mine-owner whose property,=
 vaguely located as=20

somewhere "in the mountains," was involved in litigation.  It was the refer=
ence to the litigation=20

which first completed his preparations.  "It looks as though you meant to f=
ight the pirate," added=20

Louis.  "Not if it can be avoided; but I do not intend to let Mazagan take =
any one of my people out=20

of the Maud; and all hands will shoot before anything of that kind can happ=
en," replied Scott very=20

mildly, and with no excitement in his manner; for he had studied the bearin=
g of his model, and tried=20

to imitate him.  "Do you expect Mazagan will resort to violence, Captain Sc=
ott?"  "That is an odd=20

question, Louis," answered Scott, laughing heartily, perhaps as much to man=
ifest his coolness as=20

to treat the question lightly. "Excuse me, Louis, but you make me smile. Do=
 I expect Mazagan to=20

resort to violence? For what did he visit Pournea Bay? Did he resort to vio=
lence when he caught=20


_
the boundaries of the commonplaces. Oddly enough, considering the fact that=
 his planned-for=20

Eastern career would have given him little occasion to dip into the mining =
codes, he had=20

specialized somewhat in mining law. Hence, when the hawk-faced man had told=
 his to violence=20

when his assistants attempted to capture you and Miss Blanche in Zante? Wha=
t do you suppose=20

he followed the Maud up here for, Louis?"  "Perhaps to induce me to pay him=
 twenty thousand=20

dollars to let up on Miss Blanche and myself," replied Louis,=20


_
thawing out sufficiently to be suggestively helpful to the man who had appa=
rently purchased more=20

trouble than profits in his mining ventures.  Into the cleft thus opened by=
 the axe of human=20

sympathy the man in the wicker chair presently inserted a wedge of cautious=
 inquiry touching=20

another matter. In addition to his mining ventures he had been making  "Are=
 you ready to pay=20

him?"  "Never!"  "Then he will resort to some other means to accomplish his=
 purpose in coming to=20

Cyprus. Do you wish me to surrender the Maud to him?" asked the captain.  "=
Certainly not."  The=20

Fatime let go her anchor as near the Maud as the depth of water would permi=
t her to come.=20
