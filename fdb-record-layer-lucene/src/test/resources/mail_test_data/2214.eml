Professor Bumper kept on with his search for the lost city of Pelone. Back =
and forth he wandered=20

among the wild Andes Mountains, now hopeful that he was on the right trail,=
 and again in despair.=20

Tom and Mr. Damon went with him once more for a week, and though they enjoy=
ed the trip, for=20

the professor was a delightful companion, there were no results. But the sc=
ientist would not give=20

up.  Tom Swift was kept busy looking after the shipments of the explosive, =
and arranging for the=20

blasts. He had letters from Ned Newton in which news of Shopton was given, =
and Mr. Swift wrote=20

occasionally. But the mails in the wilderness of the Andes were few and far=
 between.  Tom wrote a=20

letter of explanation to Mr. Nestor, in addition to the wireless he had sen=
t regarding the box=20

labeled dynamite, but he got no answer. Nor were his letters to Mary answer=
ed.  "I wonder what's=20

wrong?" Tom fleet of fifteen warships, besides forty-six transports and sto=
re {160} ships, was got=20

ready, and with the fleet seven of Marlborough's best regiments were ordere=
d to set sail for=20

Canada.  But it is not always big armaments, many men, many ships, many gun=
s, that win the=20

famous battles of history.  Sometimes, as we have seen, so far from winning=
 the battle, they do=20

not even strike a blow.  This expedition was England's shame.  This, which =
might have conquered=20

Quebec for the English flag, melted away in sorrow, disease, and disgrace, =
all because of the utter=20

incompetency of its leaders.  The Admiral, Sir Hovenden Walker, was both fo=
olish and perverse.=20

As for the commander of the land forces, Sir John Hill, he was chosen not b=
ecause of his war-like=20

talents, but because he was a brother of Mrs. Masham, the Queen's great per=
sonal friend.  You=20

may be interested in learning=20


_
that on purpose. And even if Mr. Nestor is angry at me for something that w=
asn't my fault, Mary=20

ought to write."  But she did not, and Tom grew a bit despondent as the day=
s went by and no word=20

came.  "I suppose they might be offended because I left Rad to do up that p=
ackage instead of=20

attending to it myself," thought Tom. "Well, I did make a mistake there, bu=
t I didn't mean to. I never=20

thought about Eradicate's not reading. I'll make him go to night school as =
soon as I get back. But=20

maybe I'll never get another chance to send Mary anything. If I do, I'll no=
t let Rad deliver it--that's=20

sure."  The feeling of alarm engendered among the Indians by the disappeara=
nce of their ten=20

fellow-workers seemed to have disappeared. There were rumors that some of t=
he mysterious ten=20

had been seen in distant villages and settlements, but the Titus brothers c=
ould not as afterwards=20

written by the Duchess of Marlborough.  "Abigail Hill's brother, whom the b=
ottle man afterwards=20

called 'honest Jack Hill,' was a tall boy whom I clothed (for he was all in=
 rags) and put to school in=20

St. Albans.  I afterwards got my Lord Marlborough to make him groom of the =
bedchamber to the=20

Duke of Gloucester, and though my Lord always said that Jack Hill was good =
for nothing, yet to=20

oblige me he made him his aide-de-camp and afterwards gave him a regiment."=
  Under such a=20

commander the fleet and army, crossing the Atlantic, arrived at Boston.  He=
re they were joined by=20

two Massachusetts regiments under the command of Samuel Vetch, a New Englan=
der, who had=20

been made Governor of Annapolis.  The {161} plan decided upon was that Cana=
da should be=20

attacked, simultaneously with Quebec and Montreal, by 12,000 men.  Surely, =
with such a force, it=20

"I don't think anything serious happened to them, anyhow," said Job Titus o=
ne day. "And I should=20

hate to think our work was responsible for harm to any one."  "Your rivals =
don't seem to be doing=20

much to hamper you," observed Tom. "I guess Waddington gave up.  "I won't b=
e too sure of that,"=20

said Mr. Titus.  "Why, what has impossible to fail!  But failure had marked=
 the enterprise for its=20

own.  A dense fog hung over the gulf and river of St. Lawrence.  In vain Ad=
miral Walker was=20

warned that to steer to the north was to advance to certain destruction.  W=
alker simply laughed at=20

the advice. But his laughter had scarcely died away ere the=20
