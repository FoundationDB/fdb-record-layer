dracaena marginata came up with the returning bell-boy. "Mr. Blount, this is Mr. Hardwick McVickar, first vice-president of the Transcontinental Railway Company."  There was no trace of the recent battle in Mr. McVickar's voice or manner when he acts of Captain Mazagan," added Louis. "They had to obey his orders, and I doubt if they had any knowledge of his intentions."  "I did not see a single person, as well as I could make them out in the boats, who looked like an dracaena marginata came up with the returning bell-boy. "Mr. Blount, this is Mr. Hardwick McVickar, first vice-president of the Transcontinental Railway Company."  There was no trace of the recent battle in Mr. McVickar's voice or manner when he acts of Captain Mazagan," added Louis. "They had to obey his orders, and I doubt if they had any knowledge of his intentions."  "I did not see a single person, as well as I could make them out in the boats, who looked like an _
took. "If you had seen his face when Lackner and I came away, you'd have said there was battle, 

murder, and sudden death in it for somebody."  "But, see here, Bradbury," Gantry held his visitor 

to say, "it wasn't in the game that you were to fill him up with a lot of lies. I won't stand for that, you 

know. He is too good a fellow, and too good a friend of mine."  It was at this conjuncture that 

Blount, if he had been present and invisible, would have seen a sour smile wrinkling upon the face 

of the club gossip.  "I owe the senator one or two on my own account, Gantry. But it wasn't 

necessary to go out of the beaten path. If young Blount or his daddy would like to sue us for libel, 

we could prove every word that was said--or prove that it was common report; too common to be 

doubted. And it got the young fellow; got him right in the solar plexus. If you don't see some 

fireworks within the next few days, I miss my guess and lose my ante."  This is what Evan Blount, 

carrying out his intention of going to Gantry, might have seen and heard. On the other hand, if he 

had lingered a few minutes longer on the station platform he could scarcely have failed to mark the 

side-tracking of private car "008," and he might have seen the herculean figure of the vice-

president crossing to the carriage-stand to climb heavily into a waiting automobile.  Mr. McVickar's 

order to the chauffeur was curtly brief, and a little later the vice-president entered the lobby of the 

Inter-Mountain and shot a brisk question at the room-clerk.  "Is Senator Blount in his rooms?"  "I 

think not. He was here a few minutes ago. I'll send a boy to hunt him up for you. You want your 

usual suite, I suppose, Mr. McVickar?"  "No; I'm not stopping overnight. Is young Blount here in 

the hotel?"  "He has just gone up to the fifth floor with some friends of his--Mr. Anners and his 

daughter, from Boston. Shall I hold him for you when he comes down?"  "No; I want to see the 

senator. Hustle out another boy or two. I can't wait all night."  It was at this moment that Evan 

Blount, bearing luggage-checks and going in search of the house baggageman, missed another 

incident which might have drawn him back suddenly to his problem and its unsettled condition. 

The incident was the meeting between his father and the railroad vice-president at the room-

clerk's counter. It was neither hostile nor friendly; on McVickar's part it was gruffly business-like. 

"Well, Senator, I'm here," was the follow-up of the perfunctory hand-shake. "Let's find a place 

where we can flail it out," and together the two entered an elevator.  Reaching the floor of the 

private dining-room suites, the ex-cattle-king led the way in silence to his own apartments; rather 

let us say he pointed the way, since in the march down the long corridor the two field commanders 

tramped evenly abreast as if neither would give the other the advantage of an inch of precedence. 

In the sitting-room of the private suite the senator snapped the latch on the door, and pressed the 

wall-button for the electric lights. McVickar dragged a chair over to one of the windows 

commanding a view of the busy street, and dropping solidly into it, like a man bracing himself for a 

fight, began abruptly:  "I suppose we may as well cut out the preliminaries and come to the point at 

once, Blount. Ackerton wired me that you had definitely announced your son as a candidate for 

the attorney-generalship. Have you?"  The senator had found an unopened box of cigars in a 

cabinet and he was inserting the blade of his pocket-knife under the lid when he said, with good-

natured irony: "The primaries do the nominating in this State, Hardwick. Didn't you know that?" 

"See here, Blount; I've come half-way across the continent to thresh this thing out with you, face to 

face, and I'm not in the humor to spar for an opening. Do you mean to run your son or not? That is 

a plain question, and I'd like to have an equally plain answer."  "I told you two weeks ago what you 

might expect if you insisted on sticking your crow-bar in among the wheels this fall, McVickar, but 



you wouldn't believe me. I'll say it again if you want to hear it."  "And I told you two weeks ago that 

we couldn't stand for any such programme as the one you had mapped out. And I added that you 

might name your own price for an alternative which wouldn't confiscate us and drive us off the face 

of the earth."  "Yes; and I named the price, if you happen to remember."  "I know; you said affair 

which I do not yet understand."  "The cook says he must not talk yet, and he is taking charge of 

the case."  "Where is Louis?"  "He was looking on, and doing what he could for the wounded man. 

Do you know, Captain Scott, I believe it was the ball from his rifle that struck Mazagan!" said Felix, 

with an impressive expression on his face.  "Nonsense, Flix!" exclaimed Scott. "How under the 

canopy can you tell who fired the shot, when five of you were firing at the same time?"  "Within my 

knowledge Louis has defended himself with a revolver in his hand three times, and in every one of 

them he hit his man in the right shoulder," replied Felix. "He never fires to kill; he is a dead shot, 

and he can put the ball just where he pleases every time. If Mazagan had been shot dead, I 

should know that Louis did not do it."  "I remember that the fellow in the Muski was hit in the right 

shoulder," added the captain.  "That disables a man without making a very dangerous wound. But, 

Captain, darling, don't whisper a word to Louis that he did it, for it might make him feel bad."  "I 

won't say a word; but ask him to come to the pilot-house, for I want to see him, Flix," said Scott, as 

he had had no opportunity since the catastrophe to speak to the one he regarded as the most 

important personage on board of the Maud.  In fact, but a very few minutes had elapsed since the 

event occurred. Those on the wreck had made haste to escape before they should be carried 

down with it, and they were still pulling at no great distance from the Maud for the shore. Louis 

appeared at the door of the pilot-house very promptly; for he imagined that his presence before 

the wounded man was not agreeable to him, and that it emphasized in his mind the disastrous 

failure of his expedition to this island.  "What next, Louis?" asked the captain with a smile on his 

face; for he believed he had stolen his friend's first question "after the battle."  "That is for you to 

decide, Captain Scott, and I intend to avoid any interference with the duties of the commander," 

replied Louis.  "But when the commander asks for advice it may be given without offence," 

suggested Scott. "We have just got out of the tightest place in which we have ever been placed, 

and our experience hitherto has been boy's play compared with this day's work."  "That is very 

true; this is by all odds the most serious affair in which we have ever been engaged," answered 

Louis, as he seated himself on the divan.  "I am not going to beat about the bush for a moment, 

my dear fellow; and before we talk about anything else, even of what we will do next in this trying 

situation, I want to say that I am very much troubled in my mind in regard to the consequences of 

what _I_ have done," continued Scott, as he seated himself by the side of his friend and model on 

the divan.  "I don't wonder that you are troubled; so am I, for I think we may well regard what has 

happened as an extraordinary event," added Louis.  "I say what _I_ have done; for I purposely 

abstained from asking advice of you or any other fellow, after I had decided what to do, even if 

there had been time for me to consult you. In other words, I took the entire responsibility upon 

myself; and there I purpose to have it rest."  "Of course you had no time to ask the opinion of any 

fellow, even if it could have been of any use to you."  "I believe I did the best I could. The shallow 

water at the south of us prevented me from running away in that direction, as I tried to do, and the 

only avenue out of the difficulty was directly ahead of the Maud."  "I understand it all perfectly, for I 

could measure the situation from the upper deck," said Louis.  "I headed the steamer to the east. 



Then came that shot through the galley. The Fatime was coming about in order to bring her port 

gun to bear upon us. She could not well avoid hitting us if she had tried to do so, we were so near. 

If the ball went through the engine or the boiler, both of which were exposed to the fire, that would 

have been the last of us. Half of us might have been scalded to death; or, at the best, Mazagan 

might have knocked the Maud all to pieces at his leisure after he had disabled the vessel." 

"Precisely so."  "I might have hoisted a white rag, and surrendered, permitting the pirate to take 

you on board his steamer; but if I had done that, I could never have held up my head again, and I 

could never have looked my recording angel in the face to tell him I had let 


_
Paramounters and take our chances on a clean administration. Naturally, we're not going to do 

any such Utopian thing as that. What I want to know now is what it is going to cost us to do the 

practical and possible thing."  "Want to buy me outright this time, do you, Hardwick?" said the 

boss, still smiling.  "We"--McVickar was going to say--"We have bought you before," but he 

changed the retort to a less offensive phrasing--"We have had no difficulty heretofore in arriving at 

some practical and sensible _modus vivendi_, and we shouldn't have now. But as a condition 

binding upon any sort of an arrangement, I am here to say that we can't let you nominate and elect 

your son as attorney-general; that's out Belgrave out of the Maud."  "It would not have ended in 

just the way you have pictured it, Captain Scott," added Louis with a smile. "I think enough of the 

ship's company would have stood by me to enable me to make an effectual resistance, and 

Mazagan might have got a bullet through his left breast instead of through his right shoulder." 

"Every fellow would have stood by you, my dear fellow, as long as you stood yourself," replied the 

captain. "If Mazagan had disabled the Maud, he could have retired out of reach of our rifle balls, 

and knocked a hole through the vessel with his guns, and sunk her. Then he would have had 

nothing to do but to pick up his millionaire, and ransom him with double the sum 


_
it's going to prove a personal disappointment to you, we'll be reasonable and try to make it up to 

you in some other way."  Again the grimly humorous smile was twinkling in the gray eyes of the 

old cattleman. "What is the market quotation on disappointments, right now, Hardwick?" he 

inquired.  With another man McVickar might have been too diplomatic to show signs of a 

shortening temper. But David Blount was an open-eyed enemy of long standing.  "I don't know 

anybody west of the Missouri River who has a better idea of market values than you have," the 

vice-president countered smartly. Then, dropping a heavy hand upon the arm of his chair: "This 

thing has got to be settled here and now, Blount. If you put your son in as public prosecutor, you 

can have but one object in view--you mean to squeeze us till the blood runs. We are willing to 

discount that object before the fact!"  "So you have said before, a  "Perhaps you are right, Captain 

Scott; but I think we need not discuss what might have been. We know what is; and this is the 

problem with which we have to deal."  "Bluntly, Louis, I desire to ask you whether you approve or 

disapprove what I have done as the captain of the Maud?" continued Scott rather nervously for 

him.  "I wholly and heartily approve of what you have done!" protested Louis with emphatic 

earnestness, and without an instant's hesitation.  "My dear Louis, give me your hand!" exclaimed 

Scott, springing to his feet; they clasped hands in front of the wheel, and the captain seemed 

disposed to extend it to an embrace. "You have removed all my doubts and anxiety by what you 

said and the manner in which you said it. If you approve my action, I believe the commander will 

do the same."  "While I do not accept your view of what might have followed if you had done 

otherwise, I believe you did 


_
different ways. It's getting sort of monotonous, don't you think?"  "I sha'n't say it many more times, 

David; you are pushing me too far and too hard."  "All right; what will you say, then?"  "Just this: if 

you won't meet me half-way--if you insist upon a fight--I'll fight you with any weapons I can get 

hold of!"  Once more the quiet smile played about the outer angles of the hereditary Blount eyes. 

"You've said that in other campaigns, Hardwick; in the end you've always been like the 'possum 

that offered to come down out of the tree if the man wouldn't shoot."  "I'll hand you another proverb 

to go with that one," snapped the man in the arm-chair: "The pitcher that goes once too often to 

the well is sure to be broken. You've got a joint in your armor now, Blount. You've always been 

able to snap your fingers at public opinion before this; can you afford to do it now?"  "Oh, I don't 

know; I reckon I'll have to grin and bear it if you want to buy up a few newspapers and set them to 

blacklisting me, as you usually do," was the half-quizzical reply. Then: "I'm pretty well used to it by 

this time. You and your folks can't paint me much blacker than you have always painted me, 

Hardwick."  "Maybe not. But this time we're going to give you a chance to start a few libel suits--if 

you think you can afford to appear in the courts. We've got plenty of evidence, and by heavens 

we'll produce it! You put your son in as public prosecutor and we might be tempted to make your 

own State too hot to hold you. Had you thought of that?"  "Go ahead and try it," was the laconic 

response.  "But that isn't all," the railroad dictator went on remorselessly. "Your fellow citizens here 

know you for exactly what you are, Blount. You rule them with a rod of iron, but that rule can be 

broken. When it is broken, you'll be hounded as a criminal. In our last talk together you had 

something to say to me about our not keeping up with the change in public sentiment; public 

sentiment _has_ changed; changed so far that it is coming to demand the punishment of the great 

offenders as well as the jailing of the little ones. If we want to push this fight hard enough, it is not 

impossible that you might find yourself in a hard row of stumps at the end of it, David."  "I'm taking 

all those chances," was the even-toned rejoinder of the man who was to be shown up.  "But there 

is one chance I'm sure you haven't considered," McVickar went on aggressively. "This son of 

yours; I know as much about him as you do--more, perhaps, for I have taken more pains to keep 

tab on him for the past few years than you have. He is clean and straight, Blount; a son for any 

father to be proud of. If that is the real reason why we don't want to have him instructing the grand 

juries of this State, it is also your best reason for wanting to keep the past decently under cover. 

What will you say to him when the newspapers open up on you? And what will he say to you? And 

suppose you get him in, and we should show you up so that you'd be dragged into court with your 

own son for the prosecutor? How does that strike you?"  For the first time since the opening of the 

one-sided conference the senator laid his cigar aside and sat thoughtfully tugging at the drooping 

mustaches.  "You'd set the house afire over my head, would you, Hardwick?" he queried, with the 

gray eyes lighting up as with a glow of smouldering embers. "The last time we talked you'll 

remember that you posted your 'de-fi'; now I'll post mine. You go ahead and do your damnedest! 

The boy and I will try to see to it that you don't have all the fun. I won't say that you mightn't turn 

him if you went at it right; but you won't go at it right, and as matters stand now--well, blood is 

thicker than water, Hardwick, and if you hit me you hit him. I reckon, between us, we'll make out to 

give you as the end had not come just as you say, it would have amounted to the same thing. Let 

us leave the subject now, and come back to the question you asked me when I came in. What 

shall be done next?" said Louis.  "I don't think we can do anything but wait here till the Guardian-



Mother comes. If we go to sea, she will not know where to find us," replied Captain Scott. "What 

do you think of it, Louis?"  "I am decidedly opposed to remaining where we are. Though you and I 

may agree that what has been done is all right, the officers of the Turkish government in authority 

on this island may not be of that opinion. There is no town, or anything like one, in sight, and I 

have not been able to make out even a single house or habitation of any kind."  "It is an 

exceedingly rough-looking country on shore. There are nothing but mountains and forests to be 

seen. The nearest town put down on the chart is more than ten miles distant, though there may be 

a village or houses behind those hills on the shore to the south of us. If any of the inhabitants had 

heard the three shots fired by the pirate, they would have shown themselves before this time." 

"But I think we had better be farther from the island. When the Guardian-Mother comes, she must 

take the same course which we followed yesterday," persisted Louis. "I quite agree with you that 

we must remain in this vicinity. It is almost as calm outside the bay as it is inside. How is the water 

off the cape?"  "There are eight fathoms half a mile from the point. I think you are right, on the 

whole, Louis; for we don't care to meet any Turkish officers of any kind," replied the captain, as he 

rang the gong to go ahead.  The sound of the bell brought all hands except Morris, who had 

volunteered to stay with the patient in the cabin, to the forecastle. Pitts had gone to the galley to 

ascertain the condition of his wares after the passage of a twelve-pound shot through his quarters. 

The stove had not been struck, but it had knocked about everything else into the utmost confusion. 

He was arranging things as well as he could; for it was now five o'clock in the afternoon, and time 

to think of getting supper.  "How is your patient, Pitts?" asked Louis, coming to the door.  "He is 

doing well enough, though he has a good deal of pain. I suppose the ball is still in his shoulder, 

and he will not be much better till that is removed, Mr. Belgrave," replied the cook. "We are under 

way again, sir."  "We are running out to the cape to wait for the Guardian-Mother," returned Louis, 

as he joined the others on the forecastle.  The two boats from the wreck had made a landing on a 

point near the conic rock on the ledge. The course of the Maud took her within half a mile of them; 

for she passed over the outer extremity of the ledge.  "They are making signals to us," said Felix to 

the captain. "There goes a white cloth on a pole."  A little later a boat put off pulled by four men, 

with another in the stern sheets. The captain rang to stop the screw; for he was curious to know 

what the men wanted.  "Let the boat come alongside," said he.  There was not force enough to do 

any mischief if the Moors had been so disposed. Don was sent for to do the talking; but the first 

person Louis saw was Jules Ulbach, who had been Mazagan's assistant in his operations. Louis 

talked with him in French. His first statement was that his employer had been shot in the shoulder, 

and had gone down with the wreck. The spokesman for the steamer did not deem it advisable to 

contradict this statement.  Then Ulbach begged for a passage to some port from which he could 

return to Paris. A few words passed between the captain and Louis, and the request was 

peremptorily refused. The Frenchman begged hard, declaring that the island was a desolate 

place, and he should starve there. The men had come to beg 


_
lean heavily upon the table--"all but one thing: you fight fair, Hardwick; say anything you like about 

me and I'll stand for it; but if that boy has anything in his past that I don't know about--any little fool 

trick that he wouldn't want to see published--you let it alone and keep your damned newspaper 

hounds off of it!"  The vice-president, being of those who regain equanimity in exact proportion as 

an opponent loses it, chuckled grimly; was still chuckling when an interrupting tap came at the 

locked door. Blount got up and turned the latch to admit an office-boy wearing the uniform of the 

railroad headquarters. "Note for Mr. McVickar," said the messenger; and at a gesture from the 

senator he crossed the room to deliver it.  For a full half-minute after the boy had gone, the vice-

president sat poring over the pencilled scrawl, which was all that the sealed envelope yielded. The 

note was lacking both date-line and signature, though the clerks in Richard Gantry's office were 

familiar enough with the hieroglyph that appeared at the bottom of the sheet. In his own good time 

the vice-president folded the bit of paper and thrust it into his pocket. Then he resumed the talk at 

the precise point at which it had been broken off.  "You needn't let the boy's record trouble you," 

he averred. "As I said a few minutes ago, it's as clean as a hound's tooth. That is one of the things 

I'm banking on, David. If you don't look out, I'm going to have that young fellow fighting on our side 

before we're through."  At this the light in the gray eyes flamed fiercely, and the ex-cattle-king took 

the two strides needful to place him before McVickar.  "Don't you try that, McVickar; I give you fair 

warning!" he grated, his deep-toned voice rumbling like the burr of grinding wheels. "There's only 

one way you could do it, and--"  The vice-president stood up and reached for his hat.  "And you'll 

take precious good care that I don't get a chance to try that way, you were going to say. All right, 

David; you tell me  "Give them all they want to eat," replied the captain when the request was 

translated to him.  "The Guardian-Mother!" suddenly shouted Felix at the top of his lungs.  All 

hands gave three rousing cheers, to the astonishment of the Frenchman and those in the boat. 

Pitts came out of the galley to ascertain the cause of the demonstration, and he made out for 

himself the bow of the ship passing the point of the cape. A plentiful supply of food was put into 

the boat, and the Maud continued on her course.     CHAPTER XV  THE ARRIVAL OF THE 

GUARDIAN-MOTHER   The appearance of the Guardian-Mother in the offing was hailed with 

rejoicing by every person belonging to the Maud. Off on an independent cruise as the boys were, 

and "when the cat's away the mice will play," it would not have been strange if they had enjoyed 

their freedom from the restraining presence and influence of the commander; but no such feeling 

pervaded the minds of the ship's company.  Not even the captain of the little steamer had felt that 

he was in possession of any unusual liberty. It might have been otherwise with him and his 

companions if the threatening presence of the Fatime had not been a serious damper upon them. 

As it was, the voyage to Cyprus had resulted in a tremendous event.  Whatever Scott had said to 

Louis Belgrave about knocking a hole in the side of the pirate, as Captain Ringgold had done with 

the Viking, had no bearing whatever upon what he had actually done when the critical moment 

had come in the encounter. He declared rather lightly that he would proceed to this extremity if he 

were the captain of the larger steamer; but it had not occurred to him to do such a reckless deed 

with the little Maud, when his opponent was a steamer of four hundred tons.  Captain Scott and his 

companions had expected to see the Guardian-Mother long before she appeared. The 

commander might naturally have felt some anxiety in regard to the safety of the Maud in the gale 

of the night before, though it had not been a very severe 


_
damnedest, and I'll hand _that_ back to you, too. You do the same, and we'll see who comes out 

ahead."  The vice-president caught an elevator at the end of his leisurely progress down the 

corridor, and had himself lowered to the lobby. The electric lights were glowing, and the great 

gathering-place was beginning to take on its evening stir. Mr. Hardwick McVickar pushed his way 

to the desk, and a row of lately arrived guests waited while he asked his question.  "Where shall I 

be most likely to find Mr. Evan Blount at this time of day?" he demanded; and the obliging clerk 

made the guest-line wait still longer while he summoned a bell-boy and sent him scurrying over to 

one of the writing-tables.  "This is Mr. Evan Blount," said the clerk, indicating the supposed he 

would make all possible haste to be near her. Instead of that, she was fully ten hours behind her, 

even with her superior speed and more weatherly ability. They could not explain her delay, and it 

was useless to attempt to do so.  "What do you suppose will become of those fellows from the 

pirate, Captain Scott?" asked Louis, looking at the people from the Fatime on the shore.  "I haven't 

the least idea, and I don't think I shall trouble my head with the question," replied the captain. "We 

have given them provisions enough to keep them alive for several days, and they can make their 

way to some town. I don't consider their condition as at all desperate. If Captain Ringgold thinks it 

necessary, he will do whatever he deems advisable."  "I
