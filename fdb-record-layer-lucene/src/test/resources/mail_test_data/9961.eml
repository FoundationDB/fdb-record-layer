ENT.   The mode of=20

punishing infractions of the prison rules at the Stillwater penitentiary co=
nsists of standing the=20

prisoner on the inside of a cell door; putting his hands through the bars, =
and handcuffed on the=20

outside. He is kept standing in this position ten hours during the day, and=
 then let down during the=20

night; is allowed only a single slice of bread and a cup of water each day =
while undergoing=20

punishment. There are no beds in these cells, nothing but a plank on which =
to sleep.  As a rule,=20

prisoners are only kept in these punishment cells from four to six days, an=
d it frequently occurs=20

that he is released in one day, providing he promises to obey the rules and=
 will try to avoid getting=20

into trouble in the future. It is not the custom to subject the inmates of =
the Stillwater penitentiary to=20

this form of punishment for trivial offenses, but it is applied to those pr=
isoners who attempt to=20

escape, who destroy property, or who indulge in fights and who display a ge=
neral negligence in=20

regard to their work.  On entering the punishment cell the prisoner is sear=
ched thoroughly and=20

given a third-grade uniform. After the punishment is over he is kept in the=
 third grade for thirty=20

days, and by good conduct at the end of that time he is admitted to the sec=
ond grade. While in the=20

third grade all his privileges are cut off, such as permission to write let=
ters, receiving visits from=20

friends, and tobacco and newspapers.  Not very many prisoners are subjected=
 to this form of=20

punishment and it is resorted to only when all other means of enforcing pri=
son discipline fails.=20

THE TWINE FACTORY   There is a twine factory in operation in the Minnesota =
State Prison=20

having a yearly capacity of nearly eighteen million pounds of binder twine.=
 This adjunct to the=20

prison's industries was inaugurated about eighteen years ago, the author of=
 the measure being the=20

brilliant Ignatius Donnelly, known as the Sage of Nininger. At that time th=
e farmers of this state=20

were groaning under the iron heel of the trust, being compelled to pay eigh=
teen cents a pound for=20

their twine, but today the prison is manufacturing twine of superior qualit=
y and selling it to the=20

farmers at an average price of about seven cents per pound.  In its infancy=
 the twine plant was=20

conducted on a very small scale, but the present management has developed a=
nd added to its=20

equipment until now the factory supplies almost the entire demand of the st=
ate. There is little=20

opposition from labor unions against the employment of prison labor in this=
 industry, for there is=20

but a small proportion of the product manufactured in this state outside of=
 the prison, and outside=20

factories are under the domination of the Cordage Trust.  The successful op=
eration of Minnesota's=20

twine plant has aroused the keenest interest among prison officials in othe=
r states, and there are=20

now quite a number of similar factories operating in other penitentiaries. =
Delegations of prison=20

officials from other states are frequent visitors at the Minnesota factory,=
 inspecting the=20

manufacture of twine, and they are invariably enthusiastic over results att=
ained.  The twine factory=20

is what is known to the trade as a "three-system plant;" that is, it contai=
ns three complete sets of=20

each of the machines necessary to convert the fibre into twine ready for sh=
ipment. Mixture of Fish,=20

_&c._ tying them at both ends, and lay them for twenty four Hours in a Pick=
le of Wine and Salt,=20

and taking them out from thence, hang them in a Chimney where they may be w=
ell smoak'd with a=20

Wood-Fire, or burning Saw-dust for twenty-four hours, or longer if you plea=
se, provided you have=20

allow'd Salt and Spices enough. When you would use them, boil them gently i=
n White-wine, with a=20

Bunch of Sweet Herbs; or in Water, with one third part White-wine, and Swee=
t-Herbs. These are=20

served cold at the Table, and eat very well.  The Boars that were put up fo=
r Brawn, are now fit to=20

kill. It is to be observ'd, that what is used for Brawn, is the Flitches on=
ly, without the Legs, and they=20



must have the Bones taken out, and then sprinkled with Salt, and lay'd in a=
 Tray, or some other=20

thing, to drain off the Blood; when this is done, salt it a little, and rol=
l it up as hard as possible, so=20

that the length of the Collar of Brawn be as much as one side of the Boar w=
ill bear, and to be,=20

when it is rolled up, about nine or ten Inches diameter. When you have roll=
ed up your Collar as=20

close as you can, tye it with Linnen Tape, as tight as possible, and then p=
repare a Cauldron with a=20

large Quantity of Water to boil it: In this boil your Brawn till it is tend=
er enough for a Straw to pass=20

into it, and then let it cool; and when it is quite cold, put it in the fol=
lowing Pickle. Put to every=20

Gallon of Water a handful or two of Salt, and as much Wheat-Bran; boil them=
 well together, and=20

then strain the Liquor as clear as you can from the Brawn, and let it stand=
 till it is quite cold, at=20

which time put your Brawn in it; but this Pickle must be renewed every thre=
e Weeks. Some put half=20

small Beer and half Water; but then the small Beer should be brewed with pa=
le Malt: but I think the=20

first Pickle is the best. _Note,_ The same Boar's Head being well cleaned, =
may be boiled and=20

pickled like the Brawn, and is as much esteem'd.  This is a good Season to =
make what they call=20

Hung-Beef: The way of doing it, is, to take the thin Pieces of the Beef, an=
d salting them with Salt-

Petre about two Ounces to a Pound of common Salt, and rubbing it well into =
the Meat, dry it in a=20

Chimney with Wood Smoke. When this is throughly cured, it will be red quite=
 through, which one=20

may try by cutting; for if there is any of the Flesh green, it is not smoke=
d enough. It is, in my=20

opinion, better than any Bacon to be boiled and eaten hot.  This is what I =
shall say, concerning the=20

use of such things as are generally found about a Gentleman's Country-Seat,=
 or about a Farm,=20

which I think will be very useful, tho' a little out of the common Road; an=
d so I shall make no=20

Apology for publishing such Receipts as I am sure are good. If I do not use=
 proper Terms in some=20

of my Receipts in Cookery, I have at least put my Receipts into such a Meth=
od, as I suppose will=20

make them intelligible, and what any one may understand: But I must take no=
tice before I=20

conclude, that the meaning of publishing this, is to instruct those who may=
 not have had=20

opportunity of observing or collecting so much as I have done, and not any =
way pretending to=20

inform those who are full enough of Knowledge already. However, I hope my R=
eaders will be=20

contented with what I have here given them, and meet with something that is=
 New and Useful.=20

effected principally by a series of combings. From the moment the rush- pla=
ited cover is removed=20

and the bale is opened until the long strands of fibre reach the spinning m=
achines to be twisted=20

into cord the material is constantly undergoing combing.  The binder twine =
fibre is unloaded from=20

the cars inside the prison yard. It is weighed and stored in the warehouse =
until it is used. Adjoining=20

the fibre warehouse is the opening room in which the bales are opened and s=
pread out, the kinks=20

shaken out of the long strands by hand and the fibre put through a machine =
called a "breaker."=20

The breaker subjects it to the first course of raking, and in order to toug=
hen the material and make=20

it more pliable distributes a limited amount of oil through it. After passi=
ng through the first breaker,=20

it is sent on to a second, where it is again cleaned and straightened. Then=
 it is removed from the=20

opening room to the next shop, where it is passed through first to a coarse=
 then a fine "spreader."=20

Like the breaker, the spreader is merely a steel comb on a belt.  DELIGHTS =

After leaving the spreaders the fibre is in long, straight and fairly clean=
