dracaena marginata number four shot did not have a mortal effect upon the q=

 With a loud "Hoof," and an agonized grunt of pain, the bear fled precipita=
tely in one direction, and the hunter, thinking that he had jeopardized his=

er.  The man did not Lady Corisande in their barouche, resting for a moment=

ht, the cause of his feeling of disappointment occurred to him. He had hope=
d in this visit to have established some basis of intimacy, and to have asc=
ertained his prospect and his means of occasionally seeing her. But _
concern.  He did not look or smell like anything that Black Bruin had ever =
observed before.  The=20

odd thing about him was that he was covered with small sharp points stickin=
g out in every=20

direction, which gave him a very bristling appearance.  As the bear came up=
, he merely squatted=20

upon the ground and drew himself into a rotund shape.  What a strange creat=
ure!  Black Bruin=20

reached his nose closer to get a better whiff of the body scent, and if pos=
sible to discover what the=20

animal was.  Quick as a flash the porcupine's tail struck upward and three =
of the longest, sharpest=20

quills in this queer body were firmly planted in the hunter's nose.  With a=
 growl of pain and rage=20

the bear dealt this strange enemy a crushing blow.  The porcupine's back wa=
s broken, but the=20

conqueror carried off four more quills in his paw.  [Illustration: BLACK BR=
UIN DEALT THE=20

PORCUPINE A CRUSHING BLOW]  It was not much like a conqueror that he went, =
for he limped=20

off on three legs, and sitting down in a thicket, pulled the quills from hi=
s paw as well as he could;=20

but two were broken off and finally worked through the foot, coming out a d=
ay or two later on the=20

upper side.  The paw was so sore that he could not travel on it, and the af=
flicted bear either went=20

upon three legs, or kept quiet.  Two of the quills in his lower jaw he got =
rid of, but one stayed with=20

him for several days, and finally made its appearance in his cheek, coming =
out near the ear.  The=20

experience was a sorry one, and although several days afterward Black Bruin=
 saw the dead body=20

of the porcupine lying where he had crushed it, he would not go near it.  T=
his creature, like the=20

skunk, had a peculiar way of fighting which the bear could not understand, =
so he would give the=20

next porcupine that he met the entire road if he wanted it.  Black Bruin's =
relations with man had=20

been most peculiar up to the time of his killing his cruel master and escap=
e into the wild, and they=20

did not tend to make him wise in regard to this creature, which all normal =
wild animals shun as=20

their greatest danger.  He had been brought up in close companionship with =
men; had slept and=20

ate with them for the first three or four years of his life.  He had wrestl=
ed with the men cubs and=20

had found in it nothing but sheer delight.  Children and their caresses had=
 been his one pleasure=20

during the strenuous year with Pedro.  Now, suddenly all this relationship =
toward man was=20

changed.  Black Bruin had gone from the pale of civilization into that of s=
avagery.  He was now a=20

wild beast, feared by men, although without much cause.  Little by little t=
his new relationship=20

between himself and the man beast was borne in is radically wrong. Youth sh=
ould attend lectures=20

on art and science by the most illustrious professors, and should converse =
together afterward on=20

what they have heard. They should learn to talk; it is a rare accomplishmen=
t, and extremely=20

healthy. They should have music always at their meals. The theatre, entirel=
y remodelled and=20

reformed, and, under a minister of state, should be an important element of=
 education. I should not=20

object to the recitation of lyric poetry. That is enough. I would not have =
a book in the house, or=20

even see a newspaper.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThese are Aryan principles?=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThey are,=E2=80=9D said Mr.=20

Phoebus; =E2=80=9Cand of such principles, I believe, a great revival is at =
hand. We shall both live to see=20

another Renaissance.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd our artist here,=E2=80=9D said =
Lothair, pointing to the statue, =E2=80=9Cyou are of=20

opinion that he is asserting these principles?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; beca=
use he has produced the Aryan form by=20

studying the Aryan form. Phidias never had a finer model, and he has not be=
en unequal to it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

fancied,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, in a lower and inquiring tone, though Mrs. =
Campian had some time before=20

glided out of the pavilion, and was giving directions to the workmen=E2=80=
=94=E2=80=9CI fancied I had heard that=20

Mrs. Campian was a Roman.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe Romans were Greeks,=E2=80=
=9D said Mr. Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cand in this=20

instance the Phidian type came out. It has not been thrown away. I believe =
Theodora has inspired=20



as many painters and sculptors as any Aryan goddess. I look upon her as suc=
h, for I know nothing=20

more divine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI fear the Phidian type is very rare,=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIn nature and in art there must=20

always be surpassing instances,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CIt is a=
 law, and a wise one; but, depend upon=20

it, so strong and perfect a type as the original Aryan must be yet abundant=
 among the millions, and=20

may be developed. But for this you want great changes in your laws. It is t=
he first duty of a state to=20

attend to the frame and health of the subject. The Spartans understood this=
. They permitted no=20

marriage the probable consequences of which might be a feeble progeny; they=
 even took=20

measures to secure a vigorous one. The Romans doomed the deformed to immedi=
ate destruction.=20

The union of the races concerns the welfare of the commonwealth much too ne=
arly to be intrusted=20

to individual arrangement. The fate of a nation will ultimately depend upon=
 the strength and health=20

of the population. Both France and England should look to this; they have c=
ause. As for our mighty=20

engines of war in the hands of a puny race, it will be the old story of the=
 lower empire and the=20

Greek fire. Laws should be passed to secure all this, and some day they wil=
l be. But nothing can=20

be done=20


_
their way, fearing that some man might capture him and again claim him for =
the road.  The wild,=20

free life made him glad.  To be here to-day and there to-morrow was to his =
liking, and he did not=20

intend to live again upon a chain.  But that Black Bruin's long companionsh=
ip with men was a=20

disadvantage to him in his new life was only too apparent, for it led him i=
nto indiscretions, which a=20

normal bear would never have committed.  In his natural state the bear is a=
 very wary animal,=20

always upon the watch, even when he is feeding; always and forever testing =
the wind with both=20

ear and until the Aryan races are extricated from Semitism.=E2=80=9D       =
CHAPTER 30 Lothair returned to=20

town in a not altogether satisfactory state of mind. He was not serene or c=
ontent. On the contrary,=20

he was rather agitated and perplexed. He could not say he regretted his vis=
it. He had seen her,=20

and he had seen her to great advantage. He had seen much too that was pleas=
ing, and had heard=20

also many things that, if not pleasing, were certainly full of interest. An=
d yet, when he cantered=20

back over the common, the world somehow did not seem to him so bright and e=
xhilarating as in=20

the ambling=20


_
it was different.  In his own mind he had nothing to fear from men.  He had=
 walked through their=20

villages and along their country roads and seen them by thousands and tens =
of thousands.  They=20

had never harmed him, and he had no reason to think they ever would.  One S=
eptember morning=20

he was digging roots along the edge of the woods. He had found something qu=
ite to his liking and=20

was much absorbed, when suddenly a fresh puff of wind blew the strong body =
scent of a man full=20

into alone? And yet why should he expect she should be alone? She had many =
friends, and she=20

was as accessible to them as to himself. And yet a conversation with her, a=
s in the gardens of=20

Blenheim, would have been delightful, and he had rather counted on it. Neve=
rtheless, it was a=20

great thing to know men like Mr. Phoebus, and hear their views on the natur=
e of things. Lothair=20

was very young, and was more thoughtful than studious. His education hither=
to had been,=20

according to Mr.=20


_
Then a twig snapped in the cover near at hand, and a squirrel hunter steppe=
d into view, not fifty=20

feet away.  The hunter was probably much more astonished than was Black Bru=
in.  The great=20

shaggy brute was so close to him that he looked like a veritable monster.  =
With the hunter's=20

instinct, that acts almost before the mind has time to think, the gun went =
to his shoulder and both=20

barrels were discharged in such quick succession as to call for merely one =
echo.  The hunter was=20

of the right principle, and chiefly in the open air; but he was intelligent=
 and susceptible, and in the=20

atmosphere of Oxford, now stirred with many thoughts, he had imbibed some p=
articles of=20

knowledge respecting the primeval races which had permitted him to follow t=
he conversation of=20

Mr. Phoebus not absolutely in a state of hopeless perplexity. He determined=
 to confer with Father=20

Coleman on the Aryan race and the genius of Semitism. As he returned throug=
h the park, he=20

observed=20
