he would miss his train for Pride's Crossing, buy the lady's tickets, and see her off at the South 

Station for Chicago, he would have regarded the prophet as a lunatic. But that is precisely what 

Mr. Wentworth did. And when, as her train pulled out, Honora bade him goodby, she felt the tug at 

her heartstrings which comes at parting with an old friend.  "And anything I can do for you here in 

the East, while--while you are out there, be sure to let me know," he said.  She promised and 

waved at him from the platform as he stood motionless, staring after her. Romance had spent a 

whole day in Boston! And with Mr. Alden Wentworth, of all people!  Fortunately for the sanity of the 

human race, the tension of grief is variable. Honora, closed in her stateroom, eased herself that 

night by writing a long, if somewhat undecipherable, letter to Chiltern; and was able, the next day, 

to read the greater portion of a novel. It was only when she arrived in Chicago, after nightfall, that 

loneliness again assailed her. She was within nine hours--so the timetable said--of St. Louis! Of all 

her trials, the homesickness which she experienced as she drove through the deserted streets of 

the metropolis of the Middle West was perhaps the worst. A great city  "Mrs. Pamflett?"  "Yes."  "It 

was found in the grounds of Parksides to-day." Mr. Beeminster took his companion aside and 

whispered a few words to him; the man nodded and left the room. Aunt Leth heard him close the 

street door behind him. "When, within your knowledge, did Miss Farebrother wear this brooch 

last?"  "I cannot say positively; it is a long time since. I believe she did not bring it away with her 

from Parksides when she left her father's house to come to us."  "Can you swear to that?"  "No; 

but my niece will be able to tell you."  "I shall not ask her; it might be used in evidence against 

her."  "In evidence against her! For God's sake tell me what you are here for! Do not keep me any 

longer in suspense!"  "Not for a moment longer. Miser Farebrother is dead."  "Dead!"  "Dead. 

Found murdered this morning in the grounds at Parksides. A cruel murder. I have brought a copy 

of an evening paper with me containing the information. It was just out as I came here. Would you 

like to read it? But you do not seem in a fit state. I will read it to you."  Mr. Beeminster unfolded the 

paper and read:  "FRIGHTFUL MURDER.--A MYSTERIOUS CASE.  "This morning, at eleven 

o'clock, the discovery was made of a horrible murder committed on a small estate known as 

Parksides, on the outskirts of Beddington.  "For a number of years Parksides has

not felt the depressing effect of it? And, so far as the incoming traveller is concerned, Chicago 

does not put her best foot forward. The way from the station to the Auditorium Hotel was hacked 

and bruised--so it seemed--by the cruel battle of trade. And she stared, in a kind of fascination that 

increased the ache in her heart; at the ugliness and cruelty of the twentieth century.  To have 

some cause or other, was generally spoken of as Miser Farebrother. He was a man, it is 

understood, of penurious habits, and the only servant in the house was a house-keeper, Mrs. 

Pamflett. He had one child, a daughter, who for some time past has not resided with him, but who 

found a home with an aunt and uncle living in London. Mrs. Pamflett bore the reputation of being 

an attentive and capable

suffering, and Honora was paying the penalty for hers. It ran riot now. The huge buildings towered 

like formless monsters against the blackness of the sky under the sickly blue of the electric lights, 

across the dirty, foot-scarred pavements, strange black human figures seemed to wander 

aimlessly: an elevated train thundered overhead. And presently she found herself the tenant of two 

rooms in that vast refuge of the homeless, the modern hotel, where she sat until the small hours 

looking down upon the myriad lights of the shore front, and out beyond them on the black waters 

of an inland sea.            .......................  From Newport to Salomon City, in a state not far from the 

Pacific tier, is something of a transition in less than a week, though in modern life we should be 

surprised at nothing. Limited trains are wonderful enough; but what shall be said of the modern 

mind, that travels faster than light? and much too fast for the pages of a chronicle. Martha 

Washington and the good ladies of her performing her duty. Like her master, however, she was 

not a favourite in the village. The establishment altogether was not in good repute, although the 

only charge that can be brought against the inmates is that they did not court society, and kept 

themselves from their neighbours. This remark does not apply to Miser Farebrother's daughter. 

She was generally liked, and has been in the habit of going frequently to London and paying long 

visits to her aunt and uncle. The only persons in Parksides yesterday, until the afternoon, were 

Miser Farebrother and Mrs. Pamflett, the house-keeper. Then the house-keeper was sent by her 

master to the telegraph office with a message to his manager in London, requesting him to come 

down to Parksides, presumably upon business. The business conducted in London was a money-

lending business, and--Miser Farebrother being confined to his house by gout and rheumatism--

the confidential manager here was Mr. Jeremiah Pamflett, the son of the house-keeper. Before the 

telegram could

eliminated. In these enlightened times, if in one week a lady is not entirely at home with husband 

number one, in the was on his way to his master, having an important matter of business to 

discuss with him. The business settled, Mr. Pamflett left for London.  "At about ten o'clock last 

night a man called at Parksides to see Miser Farebrother, and being expected, was admitted to 

Miser Farebrother's room. For the last three or four
