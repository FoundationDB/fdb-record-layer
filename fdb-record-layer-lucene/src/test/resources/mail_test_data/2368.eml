and      promoting the comfort of every man, woman, and child throughout he=

 weapons were fire,=20

water, and their own powerful breath. In the crash of the thunder the Arab =
heard their terrible=20

the hustings on the day=20

of nomination.  "Gentlemen, I have the honour to subscribe myself, Your ver=
y faithful and obedient=20

servant, HORATIO MOUNT-STEPHEN FIPPS."    The bill-sticker lost no time in =
placarding the=20

walls of the town; but his functions had been largely anticipated by the di=
sclosures of the toll-bar=20

keeper, Boniface, his boots, Bung, and his ostler.  The town was set in a c=
ommotion. The Green=20

Swan with Two Tails was crowded in the bar-parlour, in front of the bar, an=
d in every public room it=20

had. Mr. Smith (I mean Mr. Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps) received a dozen of=
fers of professional=20

assistance, two or three score of requests for the honour of making his acq=
uaintance, letters=20

innumerable for his autograph, with other delicate and indelicate overtures=
 of good-will and=20

friendship,--all within a few hours. Mr. Fipps, after he had returned to Lo=
ndon, and been=20

retransformed into "Smith," told me it was the "jolliest spree" he had ever=
 been engaged in during=20

his life; and my man told me that the fictitious candidate played his part =
with the skill of a genius.=20

In the course of the morning a crowd assembled in front of the Swan with Tw=
o Tails, and loud=20

huzzas were heard in honour of "the independent" and now "popular candidate=
." A speculative=20

printer had, without orders, either in the excess of political zeal, or in =
reliance upon a careless=20

auditing of accounts, got another placard stuck upon the walls, which read =
thus:       "FIPPS FOR=20

EVER!!!"  The mob became towards afternoon a little impatient and uproariou=
s, and the candidate=20

had to present himself on the balcony of the hotel, and harangue his admire=
rs. I regret to say, no=20

short-hand writer being present, I cannot give the reader a report of this =
speech, which I am sorry=20

for, because I have been told it was one of the grandest orations of the ki=
nd ever uttered by a=20

pretended or real candidate. However, let that pass.  Towards evening a dep=
utation asked=20

permission to wait upon Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps, Esq., to express their=
 admiration of the=20

principles so clearly and exactly enunciated in his address, and so beautif=
ully illustrated and=20

enforced in his most eloquent speech. Their request was granted with the ut=
most cordiality by that=20

great man, and he supplicated them to do him the honour of dining with him.=
  The hospitality of the=20

Green Swan with Two Tails was, I am told, worthy of a more pretentious esta=
blishment; and ample=20

justice was done, as the penny-a-liners say, to the culinary skill of the h=
ostess. Mine host's=20

vintages were also duly appreciated, or at least I judge so by the items of=
 account which I=20

afterwards saw under the date of this entertainment. It is true that the go=
od things bore familiar=20

names; but that circumstance may rather be ascribed to the English characte=
r of the candidate=20

and his admirers, than to the limited capacity or means of the landlord and=
 his better half. Sherry=20

and port and champagne--champagne and port and sherry--seemed to have been =
mingled in=20

profusion with cigars that, in the aggregate, weighed made man in his own i=
mage; man has ever=20

since endeavored to make all things in his own. So have the winds become pe=
rsonified in every=20

age and land.  Charles Kingsley has given us a beautiful picture of the =E2=
=80=9Cair mothers,=E2=80=9D and the part=20

they play in the realm of nature. Compare the ancient with the modern. We n=
ow know the laws=20

and the work of the winds; but we have not found a better manner of picturi=
ng them. They are still=20

the beautiful spirits of the air; the Peris of the upper deep, thoughtless =
in life, weeping repentant=20

tears in the hour of their death.  =E2=80=9CWho are these who follow us sof=
tly over the moor in the autumn=20

evening? Their wings brush and rustle in the fir boughs, and they whisper b=
efore and behind us,=20

as if they called gently to each other, like birds flocking homeward to the=
ir nests.  =E2=80=9CThe=20

woodpecker on the pine stems knows them, and laughs aloud for joy as they p=
ass. The rooks=20



above the pasture know them, and wheel around and tumble in their play.  =
=E2=80=9CThe brown leaves on=20

the oak-tree know them, and flutter faintly, and beckon as they pass. In th=
e chattering of the dry=20

leaves there is a meaning, and a cry of weary things longing for rest.  =E2=
=80=9C=E2=80=98Take us home, take us=20

home, you soft air-mothers, now our fathers, the sunbeams, are grown dull. =
Our green summer=20

beauty is all draggled, and our faces are grown wan and thin; and the buds,=
 the ungrateful children=20

whom we nourished, thrust us off from our seats. Waft us down, you soft air=
-mothers, upon your=20

wings, to the quiet earth, that we may go to our home, as all things go, an=
d become air and=20

sunlight once again!=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9CThe bold young fir seeds know them,=
 and rattle impatiently in their cones.=20

=E2=80=98Blow more strongly, blow more fiercely, slow air-mothers, and shak=
e us from our prisons of dead=20

wood, that we may fly and spur away northeastward, each on his horny wing. =
We will dive like=20

arrows through the heather, and drive our sharp beaks into the soil, and ri=
se again, as green trees,=20

toward the sunlight, and spread out lusty boughs.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9CThey n=
ever think, bold fools, of what is coming=20

to bring them low in the midst of their pride--of the reckless axe which wi=
ll fell them, and saws=20

which will shape them into logs, and the trains which will roar and rattle =
over them as they lie=20

buried in the gravel of the way, till they are ground and rattled into powd=
er, and dug up and flung=20

upon the fire, that they too may return home, like all things, and become a=
ir and sunlight once=20

again.  =E2=80=9CThe air-mothers hear their prayers, and do their bidding: =
but faintly, for they themselves=20

are tired and sad, and their garments rent and worn. Ah! how different were=
 those soft air-mothers,=20

when, invisible to mortal eyes, they started on their long sky journey, fiv=
e thousand miles across=20

the sea.  =E2=80=9COut of the blazing caldron which lies between the two Ne=
w Worlds, they leaped up,=20

when the great sun called them, in whirls and spouts of clear hot steam, an=
d rushed to the=20

northward, while the whirling earthball whirled them east.  =E2=80=9CSo nor=
theastward they rushed aloft,=20

across the gay West Indian Isles, having below the glitter of the flying-fi=
sh, and the sidelong eyes=20


_
take it from the price they cost me or my principal) the finest that Havann=
ah could produce.  At this=20

improvised banquet speeches were of course delivered, toasts were drunk, an=
d songs were sang,=20

until the _finale_,--a medley of variations from "Rule Brittania," "God Sav=
e the Queen," and "We=20

won't go Home till Morning,"--which last chorus embodied a resolution that =
the patriotic admirers of=20

Fipps did faithfully perform.  Out of this party a committee was formed by =
the sober men; for, let it=20

be observed, Smith--that is, I mean Fipps--kept faith by keeping sober with=
 a constant eye to=20

results; and all now was expected to go on merrily as a marriage-bell.  The=
 next day was spent=20

very much as the previous one had been, except that the third and popular c=
andidate, as a matter=20

of form, called upon a cruel sharks: above the canefields and the plantain =
gardens, and the=20

cocoanut groves which fringe the shores: above the rocks which throbbed wit=
h earthquakes, and=20

the peaks of old volcanoes, cinder-strewn: while far beneath, the ghosts of=
 their dead sisters=20

hurried homeward on the northeast breeze.  =E2=80=9CWild deeds they did, as=
 they rushed onward, and=20

struggled and fought among themselves, up and down, and round and backward =
in the fury of=20

their blind hot youth. They tired themselves by struggling with each other,=
 and by tearing the heavy=20

water into waves; and their wings grew clogged with sea-spray, and soaked m=
ore and more with=20

steam.  =E2=80=9CAt last, the sea grew cold beneath them, and their clear s=
team sank to mist; and they saw=20

themselves and each other wrapped in dull, rain-laden clouds. Then they=20


_
candidate's duties, such as shaking hands with one or two loungers in front=
 of the hotel clad in=20

soiled smock-frocks, kissing a few slobbering babies, talking pleasantly to=
 the voters' wives, and=20

expounding principles to the voters themselves.  On this day the attorney o=
f Mr. Twitch sent a note=20

by hand to the veiled themselves for very shame: and they said, =E2=80=98We=
 have been wild and=20

wayward: and alas, our pure youth is gone. But we will do one good deed, ye=
t, before we die, and=20

so we shall not have lived in vain. We will glide onward to the land and we=
ep there, and refresh all=20

things with warm, soft rain, and make the=20
