Perhaps Mr. Stewart will take me in as senior partner, if I ask him."  "I d=

Jimmy, laughing.  "Then perhaps I can get a few scholars in drawing. Can't =
you recommend me?"=20

to sell newspapers, and it was necessary in this fighting in the state of U=

for customers. Being an enterprising boy, he was sure to meet with fair suc=
cess in any business=20

which he undertook. So it happened that at ten o'clock he had sold out his =
stock of papers, and=20

realized a profit of fifty cents.  It was getting late for morning papers, =
and there was nothing left to=20

do till the issue of the first edition of the afternoon papers.  "I'll go d=
own and see how George Barry=20

is getting along," thought Paul.  He crossed Broadway and soon reached the =
familiar stand.=20

"How's business, George?" he inquired.  "Fair," said Barry. "I've sold four=
 ties."  "How do you=20

feel?"  "I'm not so strong as I was, yet. I get tired more easily. I don't =
think I shall stay in this=20

business long."  "You don't? What will you do then?"  "I've got a chance in=
 Philadelphia, or I shall=20

have by the first of the month."  "What sort of a chance?" by some Birivas,=

learned, used the =E2=80=9Csirigote,=E2=80=9D that is, the old-fashioned hi=

hos, which is flat, and suited better for=20

galloping upon a plain than for long marches over mountain passes and throu=
gh woods.  All the=20

points, qualities, with the shortcomings and the failings of a mule, he did=
 rehearse.  It then=20

appeared a mule should be mouse-coloured, for the red-coloured mule is of n=

You know how to sell ties, and can make money."  "There's only one objectio=

that?"  "I haven't got any capital."  "It don't need much."  "How much?"  "=
I'll sell out all my stock at=20
