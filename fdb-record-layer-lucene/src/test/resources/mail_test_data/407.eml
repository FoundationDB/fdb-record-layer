Tuzulatlan, inhabited by a warlike people, whom the Spaniards had never been able to conquer, 

partly on account of the difficult nature of the country, and partly on account of the skill and 

courage of the providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this

necessaries for his support, Las Casas only asked that the conditions expressed in the following 

agreement bearing the Governor's signature should be scrupulously observed. The act was thus 

worded:  "By these presents I promise and give my word in the name and on behalf of his Majesty 

and by the royal power which I hold that should you, or anyone of your religious here present, to 

wit, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, Fray Rodrigo de the following which you do or cause to 

occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or 

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  Section 2.

care, bring any provinces or Indians of them, which may be all or partly within my jurisdiction which 

I exercise for his Majesty, to peaceably recognise his Majesty as sovereign and to pay a tribute 

according as their means and property may permit either of gold, if it exists in their country, or of 

cotton, maize, or any other product which they possess and use for trade amongst themselves, I 

will, by virtue of his Majesty's authority, recognise all such and their provinces in his Royal name 

and present them to his Majesty that they may serve him as his vassals; nor will I give them to any 

one, nor shall they be given in encomienda to any Spaniard either now or at any time.  I will 

command that no Spaniard shall molest them nor enter their country, under grave penalties, for a 

period of five years, that they may not disturb them or hinder your preaching and their conversion, 

unless I should myself go personally when it may seem good to you and when you may 

accompany me; for in this matter I desire to fulfil the will of God and of his Majesty and to aid you 

as far as I possibly can to win the natives of this province to the knowledge of God and the service 

of his Majesty, etc."  Provided with this official guarantee, the friars began to carefully study the 

best means for approaching the Indians of Tuzulatlan and after much reflection, they hit upon a 

plan as simple as it was ingenious.  They composed couplets in the Quiche tongue, in which were 

recited the creation of the world and the story of Eden; man's fallen state and need of redemption; 

the birth and miracles of Our Lord and finally His death upon the Cross.  These verses were very 

much after the style of the text of the miracle-plays which were so popular throughout Europe in 

the Middle Ages, and as they contained the entire epitome of the Christian religion, the Indians, by 

merely listening to the chanting of them, would catch the rhythm by ear, exists because of the 

efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and 

financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching 

Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain 

freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and 

future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and

penetrate their understanding, once their attention had been secured.  Selecting four Christianised 

Indians who plied their trade as itinerant merchants between the country of Zacapula and the 

Quiche tribes, whom they thought qualified to play the part, the friars carefully taught them the 

verses. The Indian's memory is as tenacious as his faculty for learning by rote is quick, and as the 

rhymes were graceful and the subject matter spread public support and donations to carry out its 

mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely 

distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including 

outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining 

tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws

dramatic and mysterious, the four traders quickly learned to chant them in chorus, accompanied 

by several Indian musical instruments.  Some time was necessarily consumed in these 

preparations and it was August of 1537 before the friars were ready to send forth their apostolic 

troubadours. The news of their conditions and agreement with the governor reached Mexico, 

where the Bishop Marroquin had gone for his consecration, and met with approval both from the 

Dominican superiors there and the Governor of the Audiencia.  States. Compliance requirements 

are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and
