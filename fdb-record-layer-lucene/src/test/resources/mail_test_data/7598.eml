XXIII. THE WIFE'S RESOLVE, 222 to Lord Robert West--a man who, as his broth=
er has no=20

children, might some day make her a Duchess.  "Sorry to have seemed rude ju=
st now, sir," said=20

one of the two railway-key men, suddenly reminding me of his unnecessary ex=
istence. "Hardly=20

knew what I was about when I shoved you away from the door. Me and my frien=
d was afraid of=20

missing the train, so we pushed--instinct of self-preservation, I suppose,"=
 and he chuckled as if he=20

had got off some witticism. "Anyhow, I apologise. Nothing intentional, 'pon=
 my word."  "Thanks. No=20

apology is necessary," I replied as indifferently as I felt.  "That's all r=
ight, then," finished the=20



Jewish-faced man, who had spoken. He turned to his companion, and the two r=
esumed their=20

conversation behind the newspaper: but I now became conscious that they occ=
asionally glanced=20

over the top at their neighbour or at me, as if their whole attention were =
not taken up with the news=20

of the day.  Any interest they might feel in me, provided it had nothing to=
 do with a certain pocket,=20

they were welcome to: but the little man was apparently not of the same min=
d concerning himself.=20

His nervously twitching hand on the upholstered seat-arm which separated hi=
s place from mine=20

attracted my attention, which was then drawn up to his face. He was so sick=
ly pale, under a kind of=20

yellowish glaze spread over his complexion, that I thought he must be ill, =
perhaps suffering from=20

train sickness, in anxious anticipation of the horrors which might be in st=
ore for him on the boat.=20

Presently he pulled out a red-bordered handkerchief, and unobtrusively wipe=
d his forehead, under=20

his checked travelling cap. When he had done this, I saw that his hair was =
left streaked with damp;=20

and there was a faint, purplish stain on the handkerchief, observing which =
with evident dismay he=20

stuffed the big square of coarse cambric hastily into his pocket.  "The lit=
tle beast must dye his=20

hair," I thought contemptuously. "Perhaps he's an albino, really. His eyes =
look like it."  With that,=20

he threw a frightened glance at me, which caused me to turn away and spare =
him the humiliation=20

of knowing that he was observed. But immediately after, he made an effort t=
o pull himself together,=20

picking up a book he had laid down to wipe his forehead and holding it so c=
lose to his nose that=20

the printed page must have been a mere blur, unless he were very near-sight=
ed. Thus he sat for=20

some time; yet I felt that no look thrown by the other two was lost on him.=
 He seemed to know=20

each time one of them peered over the newspaper; and when at last the train=
 slowed down by the=20

Admiralty Pier all his nervousness returned. His small, thin hands, freckle=
d on their backs, hovered=20

over one piece of luggage after another, as if he could not decide how to p=
ile the things together.=20

Naturally I had not brought my man with me on this errand, therefore I had =
let my suitcase go into=20

the van, that I might have both hands free, and I had nothing to do when th=
e train stopped but=20

jump out and make for the boat. Nevertheless I lingered, folding up a newsp=
aper, and tearing an=20

article out of a magazine by way of excuse; for it was not my object to be =
caught in a crowd and=20

hustled, perhaps, by some clever wretches who might be lying in wait for wh=
at I had in my pocket.=20

going in procession with=20

their garlands, and nosegays, and nonsense!" exclaimed Nancy Sands, the wif=

expression anything but amiable upon her flushed face. "One might fancy tha=

lingered also, for some=20

reason of their own. They had no luggage, except a small handbag each, but =
these they opened at=20

the last minute to stuff in their newspapers, and apparently to review the =
other contents. Presently,=20

when the first rush for the boat was over, and the porters who had come to =
the door of our=20

compartment had gone away empty-handed, I would have got out, had I not cau=
ght an imploring=20

glance from the little man who had reserved the carriage.=20
