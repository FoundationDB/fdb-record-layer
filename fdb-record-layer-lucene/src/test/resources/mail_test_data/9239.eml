continuation. Although the horn of a rhinoceros is a weapon of immense powe=
r, it has no solid=20

foundation, but when the animal is killed, it can be separated from its hol=
d upon the second day=20

after death, by a slight blow with a cane. The base forms an exceedingly sh=
allow cup, and much=20

resembles the heart of an artichoke when the leaves have been picked off. T=
he teeth are very=20

peculiar, as the molars have a projecting cutting edge on the exterior side=
; thus the jaws when=20

closed form a pair of shears, as the projecting edges of the upper and lowe=
r rows overlap: this=20

makes a favourable arrangement of nature to enable the animal to clip off t=
wigs and the branches=20

upon which it feeds, as, although it does not absolutely refuse grass, the =
rhinoceros is decidedly a=20

wood eater. There are particular bushes which form a great attraction, amon=
g these is a dwarf=20

mimosa with a reddish bark: this tree grows in thick masses, which the rhin=
oceros clips so closely=20

that it frequently resembles a quickset hedge that has been cut by the wood=
man's shears. These=20

animals are generally seen in pairs, or the male, female, and calf; the mot=
her is very affectionate,=20

and exceedingly watchful and savage. Although so large an animal, the cry i=
s very insignificant,=20

and is not unlike the harsh shrill sound of a penny trumpet. The drinking h=
our is about 8 P.M. or=20

two hours after sunset, at which time the rhinoceros arrives at the river f=
rom his daily retreat, which=20

is usually about four miles in the interior. He approaches the water by reg=
ular paths made by=20

himself, but not always by the same route; and, after drinking, he generall=
y retires to a particular=20

spot beneath a tree that has been visited upon regular occasions; in such p=
laces large heaps of=20

dung accumulate. The hunters take advantage of this peculiarity of the rhin=
oceros, and they set=20

traps in the path to his private retreat; but he is so extremely wary, and =
so acute is the animal's=20

power of scent, that the greatest art is necessary in setting the snare. A =
circular hole about two=20

feet deep and fifteen inches in diameter is dug in the middle of his run, n=
ear to the tree that has=20

been daily visited; upon this hole is placed a hoop of tough wood arranged =
with a vast number of=20

sharp spikes of a strong elastic wood, which, fastened to the rim, meet in =
the centre, and overlap=20

each other as would the spokes of a wheel in the absence of the nave, if le=
ngthened sufficiently.=20

We will simplify the hoop by calling it a wheel the ground seemed to be bur=
ning under his feet, so=20

he went straight into the town to look for the man with the three hairs on =
his nose.  It was not=20

difficult to find him, and at the first place he asked at, three voices ans=
wered at once:  "That must=20

be Andras Prepelicza. His mustache made a mistake, and grew on the top of h=
is nose instead of=20

on his lip."  After that it was mere child's play, for every workman knew t=
hat Prepelicza was=20

"building Pest," as they expressed it. He was working at a large house in t=
he Kerepesi Street.=20

Gaspar immediately had the horses harnessed, and drove to Pest, not stoppin=
g till he reached the=20

capital; and there he set to work to find Prepelicza among the Slovak workm=
en. The mason was=20

just going up on a pulley to the third story when he found him, and Gaspar =
shuddered as he=20

thought: "Supposing the cords were to give way now!"  "Hallo, Prepelicza!" =
he shouted. "Wait a bit,=20

I was just looking for you. I want to have a talk with you."  "All right," =
called out the mason,=20

examining the newcomer from above. "Come up if you want to talk."  "You com=
e down to me, it is=20

very important."  "Well, shout it out, I can hear it all right up here."  "=
I can't do that, I must speak to=20

you in private at any cost."  "Good or bad?"  "Very good."  "Good for me?" =
 "Yes, good for you."=20

"Well, if it is good for me it can wait till the evening. I shall be down b=
y then, but I want to finish this=20

top window first."  "Don't argue, but come down at once. You won't be sorry=
 for it."  "Why, I don't=20

even know who you are."  "I'll send you word in a minute."  And with the ne=
xt pulley he sent=20



Prepelicza up a nice new crisp ten-florin note. The man who took it up got =
a florin for doing so.  At=20

the sight of this novel visiting-card Prepelicza threw down his hammer and =
trowel, and with the=20

next pulley returned to his mother earth, where miracles have been going on=
 ever since the time of=20

Moses.  "What can I do for you, sir?"  "Follow me."  "To the end of the wor=
ld, sir."  "We need not=20

go as far as that," said Gregorics, smiling. And they only went as far as "=
The Cock," a small public-

house, where they ordered some wine, after drinking which, the wily Gaspar =
began, smiling=20

blandly:  "Can you speak, Prepelicza?"  The mason began to wonder what was =
going to happen,=20

and looked long and attentively into the steely gray eyes of his new acquai=
ntance, and then said=20

guardedly:  "A jay can speak, sir."  "I am from Besztercebanya."  "Really? =
There are very=20


_
spokes sharpened and overlapping the middle. The instrument being fitted ne=
atly above the hole,=20

a running noose of the strongest rope is laid in the circle upon the wheel;=
 the other extremity of the=20

rope is fastened to the trunk of a tree that has been felled for that purpo=
se, and deeply notched at=20

one end to prevent the rope from slipping. This log, which weighs about fiv=
e or six hundredweight,=20

is then buried horizontally in the ground, and the entire trap is covered w=
ith earth and carefully=20

concealed; the surface is smoothed over with a branch instead of the hand, =
as the scent of a=20

human touch would at once be detected by the rhinoceros. When completed, a =
quantity of the=20

animal's dung is swept from the heap upon the snare. If the trap is undisco=
vered, the rhinoceros=20

steps upon the hoop, through which his leg sinks into the hole, and upon hi=
s attempt to extricate=20

his foot, the noose draws tight over the legs; as the spiked hoop fixing ti=
ghtly into the skin prevents=20

the noose from slipping over the foot. Once caught, his first effort to esc=
ape drags the heavy log=20

from the trench, and too, sir."  "You probably mistake me for my half-broth=
er," said Gaspar. "You=20

know, the one who had the caldron put away so secretly."  "The caldron!" Pr=
epelicza's mouth was=20

wide open from astonishment. "Was that your brother? Now I understand where=
 the likeness is, at=20

least ... I mean ... (and he began to scratch his ear doubtfully). What cal=
dron are you speaking of?=20

I can't be expected to remember every pot and pan I have seen in my life." =
 Gaspar was prepared=20

for such hitches as this, so was not surprised, and offered the mason a cig=
ar, which he=20

immediately wetted to make it burn slower, then lit it, and began to drum o=
n the table like a man=20

who has just found out that he has something to sell, and has the right pur=
chaser before him. Now=20

he must be as phlegmatic as possible, and the price of the article would ri=
se in proportion.  His=20

heart beat loud and fast, and the white cock framed on the wall above the g=
reen table seemed to=20

awake to life before his eyes, and to crow out these words: "Good afternoon=
, Andras Prepelicza!=20

Cock-a-doodledo. You have luck before you! Seize hold of it!"=20
