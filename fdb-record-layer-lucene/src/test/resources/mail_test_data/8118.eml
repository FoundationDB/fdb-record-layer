A BOY'S LETTER.   Dear Tom,--I last saw you waving your cap as our train ro=
lled out of the=20

station. That night I slept on a shelf in the sleeping-car, and the next mo=
rning we got breakfast at=20

Hornellsville; and it was a good one, I tell you. About noon we got off the=
 cars at Jamestown, and=20

after dinner rode over the hill in a stage, and came to what looked like a =
narrow river winding=20

among the trees.  This they said was the outlet of Chautauqua Lake. You wou=
ld suppose that the=20

water runs into Lake Erie, which is only seven miles away from Lake Chautau=
qua. But instead it=20

goes into the Ohio River, and then down the Mississippi into the Gulf of Me=
xico.  We went on=20

board a steamboat three stories high, with a big paddle-box fastened on the=
 stern, and steamed=20

up the outlet for about three miles through the wildest swamp I ever saw, u=
ntil all at once the lake=20

opened before us. I thought that we would be at Chautauqua in a few minutes=
, but the old stern-

wheel kept pushing us on for a couple of hours. At last I began to catch gl=
impses of cottages=20

among the trees. Then we drew up to a little wharf, and almost everybody we=
nt ashore. We=20

followed the crowd through the gate, and so we found ourselves at Chautauqu=
a.  The first thing=20

that I saw was a park, with flowers and fountains and statues under the gre=
at trees. Then I came=20

upon the model of a city, with all its houses and churches. This was Jerusa=
lem. A man was=20

explaining it to a crowd of people, and pointing out the places with a long=
 pole. There is an=20

Oriental house, and a park laid out to look like Palestine, with the top of=
 Mount Hermon white-

washed, and the Jordan with real water. A frog winked his eye at me, and th=
en jumped into the=20

Dead Sea. (That makes poetry, don't it?)  There are any number of streets l=
aid out in the woods,=20

and lined with all sorts of cottages. We all asked uncle to let us live in =
a tent, and you don't know=20

how airy and pleasant it is. Cousin Jennie says she can't find any places t=
o hang up "her things";=20

but I put mine on the floor, which is always handy.  I happened to be awake=
 early the next morning=20

after we came. Everything was quiet and still until the bell rang for six o=
'clock. Then there was a=20

noise, as if all the boys in our school were hollering at once. I jumped up=
, wondering if the Fourth=20

of July had come again. But pretty soon I found that it was only the newsbo=
ys (which means most=20

of the boys here) selling the morning paper, _The Assembly Herald_. I went =
out and got a lot of=20

papers, and made ten cents profit on them before breakfast.  There is a big=
 bell on the upper part=20

of the grounds. An old man rang it while I was standing by, and all at once=
 I saw dozens and=20

dozens of boys and girls running from all directions toward the corner wher=
e I stood. I asked one=20

fellow what it all meant, and he said, "Why, don't you know?--it's the _chi=
ldren's hour_." So I just=20

dropped into the stream, and went up the street to a large building with a =
dome and some wings.=20

They call it "The Children's Temple." It was so full of young people that I=
 had hard work to crowd=20

myself into the corner of a seat. There was a platform in front, and a big =
black-board, and two=20

gentlemen, both with foreheads that went clear over to the back of their he=
ads. There was singing,=20

and then one gentleman talked to us, and got us all to answer and repeat, a=
nd we never knew that=20

he was teaching us a lesson until we had learned it. The other gentleman th=
en came forward and=20

drew a picture so fast that it seemed like magic, and so funny that we all =
laughed and laughed=20

again. It's the jolliest "children's hour" I ever saw, and I'm going every =
day.  I can't begin to tell you=20

of the good times here for boys. When you read in the papers about the big =
meetings and the long=20

lectures, you might suppose that young people don't have much chance; but y=
ou'd be mistaken.=20

We go boating on the lake, and fishing down at the Point, and bathing in a =
safe place along the=20

shore. This afternoon all the boys and girls are going pilgriming through P=
alestine in a procession.=20



Last evening I went out with little Susie for a walk. We came upon an immen=
se telescope. The=20

gentleman let me take a peek through it, and I saw the ring around the plan=
et Saturn. Then he=20

held little Susie up in his arms, and let her see it too.  There is a tent =
with a lot of microscopes, and=20

two young ladies who show people how to use them. I looked at a drop of wat=
er through one, and=20

saw in it an animal fierce enough and almost big enough to bite off your he=
ad.  And then there=20

were the fire-works last night. I spent six happy months with a small tribe=
, fishing and swimming,=20

hunting, spearing fish, living on taro and bananas, and having for a friend=
 one Tean, son of a chief,=20

a youth of his own age.  The vision of the happy life came back to him; the=
 dazzling beach, the=20

heavy foliage of the palao and bread-fruit trees; the grove of cocoa-nuts, =
and the zigzag and=20

intricate paths leading from hut to hut, which when a boy he traversed dail=
y, knowing them all by=20

instinct in the same way that horses in wild countries know how to return t=
owards the place where=20

they were born.  And still the vision haunted him; not making him unhappy, =
for he was one of=20

those who find relief from thought in work, but always there in the same wa=
y that the=20

remembrance of a mean action is ever present, even when one has made atonem=
ent, or induced=20

oneself to think it was not really mean, but rendered necessary by circumst=
ances; or, in fact, when=20

we imagine we have put to sleep that inward grasshopper which in our bosoms=
, blood, brain,=20

stomach, or wheresoever it is situated, is louder or more faint according t=
o our state of health,=20

digestion, weakness, or what it is that makes us hear its chirp.  And so it=
 was that cheap=20

champagne seemed flat to him; the company of the yellow-haired and faded _d=
emi-mondaines_=20

whom Paris dumps upon New Caledonia insipid; the villas on the cliff outsid=
e Noumea vulgar; and=20

the prosperity and progress of the place to which he had so much contribute=
d, profitless and stale.=20

Not that for a single instant he stopped working, planning and improving hi=
s estates, or missed a=20

chance to acquire =E2=80=9Ctown lots,=E2=80=9D or if a profitable 10,000 ac=
res of good land with river frontage came=20

into the market, hesitated for a moment to step in and buy.  Now, though by=
 this time he had long=20

got past the need of actually trading with the natives at first hand, and k=
ept, as rich men do,=20

captains and secretaries and lawyers to do his lying for him, and only now =
and then would=20

condescend to exercise himself in that respect when the stake was large eno=
ugh to make the=20

matter reputable, yet sometimes he would take a cruise in one of his own sc=
hooners and play at=20

being poor.  Nothing so tickles a man=E2=80=99s vanity as to look back upon=
 his semi-incredible past, and=20

talk of the times when he had to live on sixpence a day, and to recount his=
 breakfast on a penny=20

roll and glass of milk, and then to put his hands upon his turtle-bloated s=
tomach, smile a fat smile=20

and say, =E2=80=9CAh, those were the days, then I was happy!=E2=80=9D altho=
ugh he knows that at that halcyon=20

period he was miserable, not perhaps so much from poverty, as from that env=
y which is as great a=20

curse to poor men as is indigestion to the rich.  So running down the coast=
 of New Caledonia in a=20

schooner, trading in pearls and copra, he came one evening to a well-rememb=
ered bay.  All=20

seemed familiar to him, the low white beach, tall palm-trees, coral reef wi=
th breakers thundering=20

over it, and the still blue lagoon inside the clump of breadfruit trees, th=
e single tall grey stone just=20

by the beach all graven over with strange characters, all struck a chord lo=
ng dormant in his mind.=20

So telling his skipper to let go his anchor, he rowed himself ashore.  On l=
anding he was certain of=20

the place; the tribe, about five hundred strong, ruled over by the father o=
f his friend Tean, lived=20

right along the bay, and scattered in palm-thatched huts throughout the dis=
trict.  Then he=20

remembered a certain cocoa-nut palm he used to climb, a spring of water in =
a thicket of hibiscus, a=20



little stream which he used to dam, and then divert the course to take the =
fish, and sitting down, all=20

his past life came back to him.  As he himself would say, =E2=80=9CC=E2=80=
=99etait le bon temps; pauvre Tean il doit=20

=C3=AAtre Areki (chef) maintenant; sa soeur peut-=C3=AAtre est morte ou mar=
i=C3=A9e . . . elle m=E2=80=99aimait bien . . . =E2=80=9D=20

But this day-dream dispelled, it struck him that the place looked changed. =
 Where were the long=20

low huts in front of which he used to pass his idle hours stretched in a ha=
mmock, the little taro=20

patches?  The zigzag paths which used to run from house to house across the=
 fields to the spring=20

and to the turtle-pond were all grown up.  Couch-grass and rank mimosa scru=
b, with here and=20

there ropes of lianas, blocked them so that he rubbed his eyes and asked hi=
mself, Where is the=20

tribe?  Vainly he shouted, cooeed loudly; all was silent, and his own voice=
 came back to him=20

muffled and startling as it does when a man feels he is alone.  At last, fo=
llowing one of the paths=20

less grown up and obliterated than the rest, he entered a thick scrub,=20


_
gorgeous they were: fountains lit up with bright colors; Roman candles flas=
hing, and rockets=20

soaring to the stars; the steamers all hung with Chinese lanterns, and sail=
ing round and round=20

upon the lake; the woods bright with the blazing electric lights overhead. =
Oh, it was grand!  I can't=20

stop to write about the squirrels that run up and down the trees, nor the b=
ig tent now and then with=20

his jack-knife, stumbling through swamps, wading through mud, until in a li=
ttle clearing he came=20

upon a hut, in front of which a man was digging yams.  As many of the nativ=
es in New Caledonia=20

speak English and few French, he called to him in English, =E2=80=9CWhere b=
lack man?=E2=80=9D  Resting upon his=20

hoe, the man replied, =E2=80=9CAll dead.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhere Chief?=E2=
=80=9D And the same answer,=20


_
where we sleep, nor the pictures at evening in the Amphitheatre (that's a g=
reat hall where they=20

hold meetings), nor lots of other things. Next year I hope you'll come with=
 us, and have a good=20

time.    Your friend,   BOB.     MIMIR'S WELL.  A SCANDINAVIAN MYTH.  BY JU=
LIA CLINTON=20

JONES.   In the north of Europe there is a rugged land, where the winters a=
re long and dark, with=20

short bright summers. Nine hundred years ago the people there were pagans, =
believing in gods=20

and giants, and their mythology is full of wonderful stories. As these myth=
s, or sacred fables, tell of=20

strange adventures, I think you will like them quite as well as even the _A=
rabian Nights_.  Take=20

your maps now, and find this wild north land. Chief; he ill, die soon; Tean=
 inside that house.=E2=80=9D  And=20

Higginson, not understanding, but feeling vaguely that his dream was shatte=
red in some way he=20

could not understand, called out, =E2=80=9CTean, oh, Tean, your friend John=
ny here!=E2=80=9D  Then from the hut=20

emerged a feeble man leaning upon a long curved stick, who gazed at him as =
he had seen a=20

ghost.  At last he said, =E2=80=9CThat you, John?  I glad to see you once b=
efore I die.=E2=80=9D  Whether they=20

embraced, shook hands, rubbed noses, or what their greeting was is not reco=
rded, for Higginson,=20

in alluding to it, always used to say, =E2=80=9CC=E2=80=99est b=C3=AAte, ma=
is le pauvre homme me faisait de la peine.=E2=80=9D=20

This was his sickness.  =E2=80=9CMe sick, John; why you wait so long? you n=
o remember, so many years=20


_
Scandinavia, and comprises Norway and Sweden. The home of these Northern go=
ds was a city=20

called Asgard, built above the clouds, in the midst of which stood Valhalla=
, the hall of the chief=20

god, Odin. Such a marvellous place as this was! It had a golden roof that r=
eflected light over all the=20

earth, just like the sun, and its ceiling was supported by dead five years =
ago . . .  When me go=20

kaikai (eat) piece sugar-cane, little bit perhaps fall on the ground, big b=
ird he come eat bit of sugar-

cane and eat my life.=E2=80=9D  Poor Higginson being a civilized man, with =
the full knowledge of all things=20

good and evil contingent on his state, still was dismayed, but said, =E2=80=
=9CNo, Tean, I get plenty big gun;=20

you=20


_
while millions of shields formed its walls, over which were draped coats of=
 mail. A huge wolf stood=20

before its immense gates, through which eight hundred men could march abrea=
st. Around the=20

walls flowed a deep river, through whose waves Odin's guests were forced to=
 wade. But I can not=20

tell you now of Odin's feast, which was always being held in Valhalla, butt=
erfly he fall.  I shoot big=20

bird so that when you go kaikai he no eat pieces, and you get well again.=
=E2=80=9D  Thus Higginson from=20

his altitude argued with the semi-savage, thinking, as men will think, that=
 even death can be kept=20

off with words.  But Tean smiled and said, =E2=80=9CJohnny, you savey heap,=
 but you no savey all.  This=20

time I die.  You go shoot bird he=20
