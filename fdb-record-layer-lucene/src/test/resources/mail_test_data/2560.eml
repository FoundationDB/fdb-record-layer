And then, a long, sweeping wave picked up their small raft with startling s=
uddenness and they=20

found themselves on a gravel beach. Before the next wave arrived they had d=
ragged the raft to=20

safety.  "That's service!" Jack exclaimed. "Now let's have a look." He snap=
ped on a small=20

flashlight.  They discovered the beach to be from a bullet implies at least=
 one wound, namely, that=20

of entrance, and perhaps another, that of exit. It does not always happen t=
hat the bullet passes=20

through the body. The appearance of the wound of entrance is usually one of=
 irregular circular=20

puncture, its edges perhaps slightly torn or lacerated, with a purplish or=
=20


_
piles of massive rocks, and behind these, a solid, stone wall.  "Look!" Ste=
w pointed to tangled=20

masses of logs, seaweed, and broken palms that lay on the rocks far above t=
heir heads. "Some=20

storm to do that!"  "Yes, and another storm may do the same to us. We'd bet=
ter ramble."  To the=20

right the beach ended abruptly in a stone wall, but to the left it broadene=
d. Tramping over the=20

rocks for a quarter of a mile, they came at last to a spot where the land s=
loped away, offering=20

enough soil to support coconut palms and other tropical trees.  "This will =
do," Jack decided.=20

Climbing up the width from a line or two to one-half inch. When the weapon =
is fired close to the=20

body there are likely to be more or less powder-marks, and possibly actual =
burning from the heat=20

and flame of the gunpowder. If the part of the body injured had been covere=
d by clothing at the=20

time, the marks of powder and of burning would probably be confined to the =
same. Bleeding is=20

usually slight and occurs more commonly from the wound of entrance than fro=
m that of exit.=20

Regularity of either of these wounds depends in large measure upon the angl=
e at which the bullet=20

has struck the surface. When=20

After striking off the husks, he bored holes through the eyes with his shea=
th knife and drank the=20

milk.  "Um-m-m!" he breathed. "Not bad."  When they had drained four coconu=
ts dry, they turned=20

their attention to other matters.  They broke open their rations and ate sp=
aringly. They cracked a=20

coconut and ate its meat. Then they stretched out side by side on the rubbe=
r raft, pillowed their=20

heads against the round outside, drew a mosquito-bar canopy over themselves=
, and lay there=20

looking at the stars.  "If we were on the shore of Lake Superior," Jack sig=
hed, "I could like this for a=20

long time."  "I suppose it's great," said Stew. "I've never been there."  "=
Great's the word, all right!"=20

Jack became enthusiastic. "We used to have a regular gang, half a dozen fel=
lows and more girls.=20

Campfire parties, canoeing in the moonlight, sings--all that...." His voice=
 trailed off. Then, "Patsy=20

was up there once."  "Who's Patsy?" Stew asked.  "Just a girl I used to kno=
w. We grew up=20

together."  "Uh-huh," Stew drawled.  "Ted took her away from me at last, or=
 at least I think he did."=20

"Our Ted?" Stew sat up. "The one who came out today to help us fight the Ja=
ps? The Ted who=20

saved our lives? Hm-m-m! Sounds a little bit queer."  "Yes, but we practica=
lly saved his life too.=20

That might also seem strange. It's that way in war. War changes a lot of th=
ings."  "You see," Jack=20

said, sitting up, "Ted and I were rivals. He was what the girls call 'smoot=
h'. I wasn't. You know how=20

I am."  "Oh sure."  "He beat me in some things, and I beat him in others. T=
hen he went after=20

Patsy."  "But you weren't smooth?" Stew drawled.  "That's what I said."  "T=
hen how come you're=20

pals now?"  "We're oval or the bullet may have ploughed a furrow or a chann=
el, by a study of=20

which the relative position of the assailant and the assailed at the moment=
 of injury may, perhaps,=20

be determined. It is of importance to determine if possible the approximate=
 distance at which the=20

bullet was fired, since the question of self-defence, for instance, may hin=
ge upon evidence of this=20

character. The charge of powder and the weight of the bullet being known, o=
ne may sometimes=20

estimate this distance by the depth of penetration or the appearance of the=
 bullet. Still, the nature=20

of the tissues must figure largely in such consideration. Many suicides who=
 shoot themselves in=20

the head show only one wound of entrance and none of exit.  =3DExperiments =
Testing Powder-

Marks.=3D=E2=80=94Powder-marks and burns from weapons ordinarily used will =
scarcely appear when the=20

distance has exceeded ten or twelve feet. LaChese, of Antwerp, found that i=
n firing a gun even=20

from a distance of only four feet the skin was only partially blackened.  A=
s the result of=20

experiments made with a Ballard rifle, old style, .44 calibre, with bullets=
 of 220 grains and 28=20

follows:  At two feet, particles too numerous to count, with some of the lu=
bricant blown upon the=20

board;  At four feet the same;  At six feet the same;  At eight feet, nine =
grains of powder;  At ten=20

feet, five grains of powder in one case and six in another.  That these wer=
e powder-grains were=20
