rintend the moral and=20

spiritual concern of the slaves, to take upon himself the religious instruc=
tion of the adult Negroes,=20

and to take particular care that all the Negro children are taught to read =
by the catechist and the=20

two assistant women (now employed by the society) and also that they are di=
ligently instructed by=20

the catechist in the principles of the Christian religion, till they are fi=
fteen years of age, when they=20

shall be instructed by himself with the adult Negroes.  "This instruction o=
f the Negro children from=20

their earliest years is one of the most important and essential parts of th=
e whole plan; for it is to the=20

education of the young Negroes that we are principally to look for the succ=
ess of our spiritual=20

labours. These may be easily taught to understand and to speak the English =
language with=20

fluency; these may be brought up from their earliest youth in habits of vir=
tue, and restrained from=20

all licentious indulgences: these may have the principles and the precepts =
of religion impressed so=20

early upon their tender minds as to sink deep, and to take firm root, and b=
ring forth the fruits of a=20

truly Christian life. To this great object, therefore, must our chief atten=
tion be directed; and as=20

almost everything must depend on the ability, the integrity, the assiduity,=
 the perseverance of the=20

person to whom we commit so important a charge, it is impossible for us to =
be too was given. One=20

after another the members of the family advanced to receive it: first the s=
oldier sons and=20

grandsons, keeping down their emotion with manly self-control; then Ivan Pe=
trovitch, and a few=20

others whose circumstances had prevented their volunteering with the rest; =
lastly the women and=20

children. But Feodor did not stir from his place, until at length the old m=
an called him by name.=20

Then he slowly rose and stood before him.  =E2=80=9CSon Ivan,=E2=80=9D said=
 Petrovitch, =E2=80=9Ccome hither and take this=20

boy=E2=80=99s hand in thine. Children, you know that little Feodor is all G=
od has left with me of Maria=20

Petrovna, the daughter of my old age, the one white dove in our falcon=E2=
=80=99s nest. Be tender with him,=20

all of you; and thou, Ivan, take care of the lad, and be to him a father in=
 my place.--Feodor, my=20

little Feodor, Maria=E2=80=99s son, God bless thee!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CKnee=
l, boy,=E2=80=9D whispered Ivan Petrovitch almost angrily,=20

as Feodor, like one in a trance, stood motionless, with his passive hand in=
 his uncle=E2=80=99s.  The boy=20

obeyed mechanically. The aged eyes of Petrovitch were full of unaccustomed =
tears, and his voice=20

faltered, grew almost inaudible, as he murmured the words of blessing over =
that beloved head. But=20

Feodor showed no sign of feeling, except that cheek and lip were white as m=
arble.  Ivan Pojarsky,=20

who, though he had withdrawn into the background, had not left the place, o=
bserved him with=20

sorrowful wonder. =E2=80=9CThe boy,=E2=80=9D he thought, =E2=80=9Cwill soon=
 forget the old man, who will die with a prayer=20

of a CATECHIST. He must consider it his province, not merely to teach the N=
egroes the use of=20

letters, but the elements of Christianity; not only to improve their unders=
tandings, but to form their=20

hearts. For this purpose they must be put into his hands the moment they ar=
e capable of=20

articulating their words, and their instruction must be pursued with unrele=
nting diligence. So long=20

as they continue too young to work, they may be kept constantly in the scho=
ol; as they grow fit to=20

labour, their attendance on the CATECHIST must gradually lessen, till at le=
ngth they take their full=20

share of work with the grown Negroes.  "A school of this nature was formerl=
y established by the=20

society of Charlestown in South Carolina, about the year 1745, under the di=
rection of Mr. Garden,=20

the Bishop of London's commissary in  Once more the aged voice was heard. P=
etrovitch arose=20

slowly from his seat, and lifted up his hands over the group. =E2=80=9CNow =
farewell, my children, and God=20

bless you. May he grant us in his mercy a joyful meeting in the home above,=
 the abode of the=20

righteous, where no enemy or evil thing can enter. Go in peace.=E2=80=9D  S=
adly and slowly, one by one,=20

they turned away. Ivan Pojarsky followed, to assure his weeping friends tha=
t he at least would do=20

all he could for the comfort and protection of their father. There were ser=
vants, too, who purposed=20

remaining in the house for the present; and to these was intrusted the task=
 of consummating the=20

sacrifice by setting fire to what had been the happy home of three generati=
ons.  With a feeling akin=20

to awe Ivan returned to the side of the now solitary old man. He was almost=
=20


_
province. This school flourished greatly, and seemed to answer their utmost=
 wishes. There were at=20

one time sixty scholars in it, and twenty young Negroes were annually sent =
out from it well=20

instructed in the English language, and the Christian faith. Mr. Garden, in=
 his letters to the society,=20

speaks in the highest terms of the progress made by his scholars, and says,=
 that the Negroes=20

themselves were highly pleased with their own acquirements. But it is suppo=
sed that on a=20

parochial establishment being made in Charlestown by government, this excel=
lent institution was=20

dropt; for after the year 1751, no further mention is made of it in the min=
utes of the society. From=20

what little we know of it, however, we may justly conceive the most pleasin=
g hopes from a similar=20

foundation at Barbadoes."--_The Works of Bishop Porteus_, vi., pp., 171-179=

"THE ACTS OF DR. BRAY'S difficulties and perplexities before him. A reveren=
