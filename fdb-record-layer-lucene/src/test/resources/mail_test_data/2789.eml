dracaena marginata however high-born, can be but flattering--and I should s=
ay welcome to those who have her future welfare at heart."  But in response=
 to this gracious tirade, M. le duc de Kernogan bowed gravely, and his ster=
n features did not relax as he said coldly:  "Your Royal Highness is please=
d to take an interest in the affairs of my daughter. I am deeply grateful."=
  There was a second's awkward pause, for every one felt that despite his o=
bvious respect and began to sing.  Low and soft at the beginning, like a dr=
eam of song.  "At the first note the Indians halted--every man; each in the=
 position in which he was fixed.  If a foot was up he kept it up.  If both =
feet were down he left them down.  The feet that were up came slowly to the=
 ground when the Indians got tired, but no one took another step.  My mothe=
r's voice was a weird voice.  It sounded as if the place from which it came=
 was nowhere--or dracaena marginata however high-born, can be but flatterin=
g--and I should say welcome to those who have her future welfare at heart."=
  But in response to this gracious tirade, M. le duc de Kernogan bowed grav=
ely, and his stern features did not relax as he said coldly:  "Your Royal H=
ighness is pleased to take an interest in the affairs of my daughter. I am =
deeply grateful."  There was a second's awkward pause, for every one felt t=
hat despite his obvious respect and began to sing.  Low and soft at the beg=
inning, like a dream of song.  "At the first note the Indians halted--every=
 man; each in the position in which he was fixed.  If a foot was up he kept=
 it up.  If both feet were down he left them down.  The feet that were up c=
ame slowly to the ground when the Indians got tired, but no one took anothe=
r step.  My mother's voice was a weird voice.  It sounded as if the place f=
rom which it came was nowhere--or _
life--our honeymoon, my dear lord--will be spent in their house."  "Blakene=
y has lent me Combwich=20

Hall for as long as we like to stay there. We'll drive thither directly aft=
er the service, dear heart, and=20

then we'll send a courier to your father and ask for his blessing and his f=
orgiveness."  "Poor=20

father!" sighed Yvonne again. But evidently compassion for the father whom =
she had elected to=20

deceive did not weigh over heavily in the balance of her happiness. Her lit=
tle hand once more stole=20

like a timid and confiding bird into the shelter of his firm grasp.   V  In=
 the card-room at His=20

Highness' table Sir Percy Blakeney was holding the bank and seemingly luck =
was dead against=20

him. Around the various tables the ladies stood about, chattering and hinde=
ring the players.=20

Nothing appeared serious to-night, not even the capricious chances of hazar=
d.  His Royal=20

Highness was in rare good humour, for he was winning prodigiously.  Her Gra=
ce of Flintshire=20

placed her perfumed and beringed hand upon Sir Percy Blakeney's shoulder; s=
he stood behind his=20

chair, chattering incessantly in a high flutey treble just like a canary. B=
lakeney vowed that she was=20

so ravishing that she had put Dame Fortune to flight.  "You have not yet to=
ld us, Sir Percy," she=20

said roguishly, "how you came to arrive so late at the ball."  "Alas, madam=
," he sighed dolefully,=20

"'twas the fault of my cravat."  "Your cravat?"  "Aye indeed! You see I spe=
nt the whole of to-day in=20

perfecting my new method for tying a butterfly bow, so as to give the neck =
an appearance of=20

utmost elegance with a minimum of discomfort. Lady Blakeney will bear me ou=
t when I say that I=20

set my whole mind to my task. Was I not busy all day m'dear?" he added, mak=
ing a formal appeal=20

to Marguerite, who stood immediately behind His Highness' chair, and with h=
er luminous eyes, full=20

of merriment and shining with happiness fixed upon her husband.  "You certa=
inly spent a=20

considerable time in front of the looking-glass," she said gaily, "with two=
 valets in attendance and=20

my lord Tony an interested spectator in the proceedings."  "There now!" rej=
oined Sir Percy=20

triumphantly, "her ladyship's testimony thoroughly bears me out. And now yo=
u shall see what Tony=20

says on the matter. Tony! Where's Tony!" he added as his lazy grey eyes sou=
ght the brilliant=20

crowd in the card-room. "Tony, where the devil are you?"  There was no repl=
y, and anon Sir=20

Percy's merry gaze encountered that of M. le duc de Kernogan who, dressed i=
n sober black,=20

looked strangely conspicuous in the midst of this throng of bright-coloured=
 butterflies, and whose=20

grave eyes, as they rested on the gorgeous figure of the English exquisite,=
 held a world of=20

contempt in their glance.  "Ah! M. le duc," continued Blakeney, returning t=
hat scornful look with his=20

habitual good-humoured one, "I had not noticed that mademoiselle Yvonne was=
 not with you, else=20

I had not thought of inquiring so loudly for my friend Tony."  "My lord Ant=
oine is dancing with my=20

daughter, Sir Percy," said the other man gravely, in excellent if somewhat =
laboured English, "he=20

had my permission to ask her."  "And is a thrice happy man in consequence,"=
 retorted Blakeney=20

lightly, "though I fear me M. Martin-Roget's wrath will descend upon my poo=
r Tony's head with=20

unexampled vigour in consequence."  "M. Martin-Roget is not here this eveni=
ng," broke in the=20

Duchess, "and methought," she added in a discreet whisper, "that my lord To=
ny was all the=20

happier for his absence. The two young people have spent a considerable tim=
e together under the=20

shadow of the gallery in the ball-room, and, if I mistake not, Lord Tony is=
 making the most of his=20

time."  She talked very volubly and with a slight North-country brogue whic=
h no doubt made it a=20

little difficult for the stranger to catch her every word. But evidently M.=
 le duc had understood the=20

drift of what she said, for now he rejoined with this season o' the year, a=
n' that we would not see=20

him an' his wife sterve when our kettles wass full.  Iss not that so, Okema=
tan?  You know him=20



best."  Thus appealed to, the Indian, whose usual expression was one of int=
ense gravity, shut his=20

eyes, opened his mouth, displayed his superb teeth, and uttered a low chuck=
le, but made no=20

further reply.  It was enough.  Those who understood Okematan and his ways =
were well aware=20

that he thought La Certe uncommonly sly.  The half-breed had indeed followe=
d the expelled=20

colonists in the belief that they would certainly possess plenty of powder =
and shot--which he had=20

not the means of purchasing.  He also knew that the whole of Rupert's Land =
swarmed with game=20

in autumn and spring, and that the Scotch were an open-handed race when app=
roached in the=20

right way. Putting these things together, he carefully gummed his canoe, pu=
t his wife and child into=20

it--also some of the provision which had been supplied to him by Duncan McK=
ay junior--and=20

followed the settlers over Lake Winnipeg to Jack River.  Here, finding that=
 a new party of=20

immigrants had arrived, who were necessarily unacquainted with his little p=
eculiarities, La Certe=20

attached himself to them and made himself agreeable.  This he could do very=
 well, for the Switzers=20

understood his bad French, as well as his good tuneful voice, and appreciat=
ed his capacity for=20

telling a story.  "Did you never," he said to Andre Morel, after his song w=
as finished, "hear of how=20

my old mother saved her whole tribe from death one time in the Rocky Mounta=
ins?"  "Never,"=20

Morel replied with a somewhat sceptical but good-natured smile.  "No!  I wo=
nder much, for every=20

one in this land heard about it, an' I thought the news must have spread ov=
er Europe and--and,=20

perhaps Africa. Well, I will tell you.  Where is my baccy-bag?"  "Never min=
d, fill your pipe from=20

mine," said Morel, tossing him a little bag of the coveted weed.  "Thank yo=
u.  Well, you must know=20

that my mother had a beautiful voice-- O! much more beautiful than mine.  I=
ndeed, I do not joke,=20

so you need not laugh.  It was so sweet that men were always forced to list=
en till she was done.=20

They could not help it."  "Did they ever want to help it?" asked Morel quie=
tly.  "O yes--as you shall=20

hear.  Well, one day my mother was living with all our tribe--I say _our_ t=
ribe because my mother=20

was an Indian--with all our tribe, in a great dark gorge of the Rocky Mount=
ains.  The braves had=20

gone out to hunt that day, but my mother stayed behind with the women and c=
hildren.  I was a little=20

foolish child at that time--too young to hunt or fight.  My father--a Frenc=
h Canadian--he was dead.=20

"We knew--my mother and I--that the braves would be home soon.  We expected=
 them every=20

minute.  While we were waiting for them, my mother went into the bush to pi=
ck berries.  There she=20

discovered a war-party of our enemies.  They were preparing to attack our v=
illage, for they knew=20

the men were away, and they wanted the scalps of the women and children. Bu=
t they did not know=20

the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched, and were just going, after a=
 feed, to look for it.=20

"My mother ran home with the news, and immediately roused the camp, and mad=
e them get ready=20

to fly to meet the returning men.  "`But, my daughter,' said an old chief, =
who had stayed in camp,=20

`our enemies are young and active; they will quickly overtake us before we =
meet our men.'  "`No,'=20

said my mother, `I will stop them.  Get ready, and set off quickly.'  "She =
then ran back on her trail--

my mother was a tremendous runner-- superb!  She came to a narrow place whe=
re our enemies=20

would have to pass.  A very thick tree grew there.  She climbed it, and hid=
 among the branches.  It=20

projected beyond a precipice and overhung a stream.  Soon after that she sa=
w the enemy=20

advancing, step by step, slowly, cautiously, like men who dread an ambush, =
and with glances=20


_
"Mlle. de Kernogan is too well educated, I hope, to allow the attentions of=
 any gentleman, against=20

her father's will."  "Come, come, M. de Kernogan," here interposed His Roya=
l Highness with easy=20

familiarity, "Lord Anthony Dewhurst is the son of my old friend the Marquis=
 of Atiltone: one of our=20

most distinguished families in this country, who have helped to make Englis=
h history. He has=20

moreover inherited a large fortune from his mother, who was a Cruche of Cre=
wkerne and one of=20

the richest heiresses in the land. He is a splendid fellow--a fine solemn f=
rom side to side, like men=20

who see a foe in every stump and stone."  La Certe paused at this point.  H=
e was an adept at=20

story-telling.  His voice had slowed by degrees and become increasingly dee=
p and solemn as he=20

proceeded.  "Now," continued he, in a higher tone, "my mother did not fear =
that they would see her=20

if they looked up when they passed the tree.  She was too well hidden for t=
hat; but she was not=20

sure what the effect of her voice would be, for she had never tried it in t=
hat way before.  However,=20

she was full of courage.  She resembled=20
