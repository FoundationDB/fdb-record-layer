dracaena marginata Franks was more annoyed by the titter from some of his scholars, which now followed the gentlemen's uproarious mirth, than he was by the more direct insults of the strangers. That his "jovial crew," that a single boy amongst them, should be mean enough to join in the laugh against dracaena marginata Franks was more annoyed by the titter from some of his scholars, which now followed the gentlemen's uproarious mirth, than he was by the more direct insults of the strangers. That his "jovial crew," that a single boy amongst them, should be mean enough to join in the laugh against _
relish in the "baiting and badgering" of the school-master in the presence of his pupils. "As I'm the 

patron of this school, I've a good right, I take it, to see that the teacher isn't a blockhead or a 

dunce."  And then, at a sign from him, the flippant lawyer began to aim a shower of questions, like 

a flight of arrows, against the unfortunate school-master,--questions ingeniously contrived to 

perplex and puzzle even one who had received a better education than had fallen to the lot of Ned 

Franks. At every query to which no reply was or could be given by him who had passed his youth 

at this reason, we find that Fowls always make their Nests upon the Ground, while Birds, for the 

most part, build their Nests aloft; so then our common Poultry are Fowls, the Pheasant, Partridge,

Neri and Bianchi, Palleschi and Piagnone, the respective styles of French, German, and Dutch 

infidel writers, and the names of female favorites of Bourbon kings, was as absurd as if he had 

been unable to repeat the multiplication-table. Certainly, Sir Lacy could not have himself answered 

one of the questions. But what of that? One needs no deep study to learn how to laugh; and it was 

rare fun to what these Fowls feed upon; and we may observe, that as neither Birds nor Fowls have 

Teeth to macerate their Food with, so Nature has provided them not only with a Crop to soften 

their Meat, but a Stomach furnish'd with thick strong Mucles, whose use is to grind the Grains of 

Corn, or any hard Meat swallow'd whole, which they perform by the help of little Stones, which 

Birds and Fowls swallow now and then, and which supply the defect of Teeth. It is observable, that
