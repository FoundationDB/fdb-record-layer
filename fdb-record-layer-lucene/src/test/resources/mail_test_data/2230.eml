dracaena marginata  MRS. ALVING. At any rate, the fact remains that with my=
self I took no counsel whatever.  MANDERS. Well then, with your nearest rel=
atives--as your duty bade you--with your mother and your two aunts.  MRS. A=
LVING. Yes, that is the rocks, and none too soon. At that very moment the m=
en of Hood charged out of the valley, and the height was held only by the m=
ost obstinate combat.  From the valley, meantime, came up a tumult of arms =
which, as the sun threw dracaena marginata  MRS. ALVING. At any rate, the f=

 your two aunts.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, that is the rocks, and none too soon. A=
t that very moment the men of Hood charged out of the valley, and the heigh=

no doubt let him see that she had money in her purse, and told him some tal=
e about a foreigner=20

who put in here with a yacht that summer. So she and Engstrand got married =
in hot haste. Why,=20

you married them yourself.  MANDERS. But then how to account for--? I recol=
lect distinctly=20

Engstrand coming to give notice of the marriage. He was quite overwhelmed w=
ith contrition, and=20

bitterly reproached himself for the misbehaviour he and his sweetheart had =
been guilty of.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Yes; of course he had to take the blame upon himself.  MANDERS. But=
 such a piece of=20

duplicity on his part! And towards me too! I never could have believed it o=
f Jacob a war-god. The=20

friends of Lee have denounced him for a sluggishness and insubordination th=
at, as they claim, lost=20

for them the battle.[259] His defence of himself is earnest and pathetic, o=
f great weight as coming=20

from one of the most able and manful figures on either side in the Civil Wa=
r.  Of Longstreet=E2=80=99s three=20

divisions, only one, that of McLaws, was on hand with all its brigades on t=
he forenoon of July 2d.=20

At noon arrived Law, completing Hood=E2=80=99s division. Pickett=E2=80=99s =
division was still behind; but in mid-

afternoon, without waiting for him, Longstreet attacked--Hood, with all pos=
sible energy, striking=20

Sickles in his far-advanced position and=20

to take him seriously to task; he may be sure of that.--And then the immora=
lity of such a=20

connection! For money--! How much did the girl receive?  MRS. ALVING. Three=
 hundred dollars.=20

MANDERS. Just think of it--for a miserable three hundred dollars, to go and=
 marry a fallen woman!=20

MRS. ALVING. Then what have you to say of me? I went and married a fallen m=
an.  MANDERS.=20

Why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! A fallen man!  MRS. ALVING.=
 Do you think=20

Alving was any purer when I went with him to the altar than Johanna was whe=
n Engstrand married=20

her?  MANDERS. Well, but there is a world of difference between the two cas=
es--  MRS. ALVING.=20

Not so much difference after all--except in the price:--a miserable three h=
undred dollars and a=20

whole fortune.  MANDERS. How can you compare Longstreet=E2=80=99s generals,=
 Hood and afterward=20

Law (Hood falling wounded in the first attack), though men of courage and d=
ash, assaulted only=20

after having filed written protests, feeling sure that the position could b=

with little fighting. But Lee had been peremptory, and no choice was left.[=

POSITION, JULY 2, 2.30 P.M.]  Gouverneur K. Warren, then chief-engineer of =
the Army of the=20

Potomac, despatched by Meade to the left during the afternoon, found the Ro=
und Tops=20

undefended. They were plainly the key to the Federal position, offering poi=
nts which, if seized by=20

the enemy, would make possible an enfilading of the Federal line. Troops of=
 the Twelfth Corps, at=20
