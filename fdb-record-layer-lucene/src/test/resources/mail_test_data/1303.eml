ogre, Miss Daisy."     CHAPTER XXXIX.  THE JOURNEY.   Poppy went away prese=
ntly, and the=20

moment she was gone Daisy began to make some hasty little preparations.  "I=
'll take the Pink with=20

me," she said to herself. "I'll empty all the things out of my little work-=
basket, and my darling Pink=20

can sleep in it quite snugly, and she'll be great company to me, for I cann=
ot help feeling very=20

shaky, and I do start so when I see any one the least like Mr. Dove in the =
distance. I mustn't think=20

about being frightened now--this is the least I could do, and if I'm terrif=
ied all over I must go "So it=20

seems to him on the face of the action I must take. But at bottom it is an =
act of true friendship. He=20

does not know the particulars, and I am in no position to explain."  "What =
is it you are going to=20

do?" she asked, drawing farther into the corner near the window.  "I must r=
equest that you ask me=20

no questions. You are not familiar enough with the law to comprehend."  Her=
 gaze was fixed on=20

him, and the Elder hitched sidewise in his chair, vainly trying to avoid he=

But the eyes of his child continued to bore into his guilty soul.  "Why do =
you stare at=20

Then Daisy wrote a tiny note--a little note on half a sheet of paper--which=
 she tore out of her copy-

book. It was blotted with tears and almost illegible. This was what she sai=
d:--  "Primrose, darling, I=20

and the Pink, we have gone away for a little bit. Your money is lost, Primr=
ose, and I cannot look=20

you in the face until I get it back again. Don't be a bit frightened about =
me--I and the Pink will come=20

back when we have got the money. her to his side.  "I don't know." She gave=
 no evidence that she=20

saw his effort to draw her near him.  "Then, stop glaring like that. How ma=
ny times have I told you=20

that it is unladylike?"  "You're going to take his place from him because h=
e cannot pay that loan!"=20

she whispered. "How can you be so cruel?"  Mr. Fox was left without excuse =
or reply. When he=20

spoke, his voice was harsh, and his words were sharp.  "I see, I have been =
unwise=20
