done so then until the day and its terrible events were over. The blunder w=
as that when these=20

three men saw us coming, instead of waiting for us to get up with them they=
 slammed right on into=20

the bank regardless, leaving the door open in their excitement."  "I was ou=
t in the street,=20

pretending I was having trouble with my saddle. Meantime I had told Miller =
to close up the bank=20

door. A man named Allen, who kept a store near by, was then trying to get i=
nto the bank, but Miller=20

foolishly shouted at him and told him to get away. Allen at once became exc=
ited and saw that=20

something was wrong, and ran off up the street shouting to every one to get=
 his gun, as the bank=20

was being robbed."  "A Dr. Wheeler, who saw that something was happening ou=
t of the ordinary,=20

began to yell 'Robbery!' Then I a Drachm of Musk to six Gallons of Liquor; =

making of Vinegar will be a considerable Article, seeing that few of our fi=
ne Preparations for the=20

Table can be made without it. A Gentleman of great note has given me the fo=
llowing Receipt for it,=20

_viz._  To nine Gallons of Water, put eighteen Pounds of _Malaga_ Raisins, =
chopt a little, Stalks=20

and all; put this into a Cask, bound with Iron Hoops, and place it in the w=
armest Exposure you can=20

find in the open Air: then take a _Florence_ Flask, divested of its Straw, =
and put the Neck of it into=20

the Bung-hole, fixing it as close as may be, with some Linnen-Cloth, and a =

in three Weeks time. The use of the=20

of harm's way and then I=20

fired a signal to the three men at the bridge for them to come up and help =
us, as we had been=20

trapped."  "Chadwell, Woods and Jim came galloping up, and at the same mome=
nt that they=20

arrived I heard a shot fired inside the bank. The three boys were firing th=
eir guns as they rode=20

along, shouting to everybody they saw to get out of the way and get indoors=
, but I am quite sure=20

they never killed anybody. My theory always has been that the man Gustafson=
, who was shot=20

down in the street, was struck by a glancing shot from some of the citizen'=
s rifles, as they were out=20

blazing away at this time."  "Miller was then shot by a man named Stacy and=
 his face filled full of=20

bird shot. A man named Manning killed Pitts' horse, and, as a matter of fac=
t, the street was full of=20

flying lead, coming from every direction. It wasn't long before I was wound=
ed in the thigh by=20

Manning, and the next instant he shot Chadwell through the heart."  "Dr. Wh=
eeler, from an upper=20

floor of a hotel, got a bead on Miller and brought him down, so that he soo=
n lay dying in the middle=20

of the street. Every time I saw a man pointing a gun at me I dropped off my=
 horse and tried to drive=20

the shooter under cover, but there were so many of them, and I couldn't see=
 in every direction, so I=20

soon found out that, wounded as I was, I was helpless. Meanwhile there was =
a tragedy going on=20

inside the bank."     [Reproduction of finger print system in vogue at the =

his gun to his left=20

and got on Miller's horse, thinking that Miller was dead. By this time Howa=
rd and Pitts had got out=20

of the bank, and I told them that Miller was still alive and we'd have to s=
ave him. I told Pitts to put=20

Miller on my horse, but when we lifted him I saw he was dead, so I told Pit=
