sband, Sir Robert=20

Worsley, possessed the   estate of Appuldercombe.]  "Madam,--I will never t=
ell, but I will always=20

remember how many years have run out since I had first the honor and happin=
ess to be known to=20

Your Ladyship, which however I have a thousand times wished to have never h=
appened, since it=20

was followed by the misfortune of being banished from You for ever. I belie=
ve you are the onely=20

Lady in England that for a thousand years past hath so long remembered a us=
eless friend in=20

absence, which is too great a load of favor for me and all my gratitude to =
support.  "I can faithfully=20

assure your Ladyship that I never received from You more than one letter si=
nce I saw you last; and=20

that I sent you a long answer. I often forget what I did yesterday, or what=
 passed half an hour ago;=20

and yet I can well remember a hundred particulars in Your Ladyship's compan=
y. This is the=20

memory of those who grow old. I have no room left for new Ideas. I am offen=
ded with one passage=20

in Your Ladyship's letter; but I will forgive You, because I do not believe=
 the fact, and all my=20

acquaintance here joyn with me in my unbelief. You make excuses for not soo=
ner sending me the=20

most agreeable present that ever was made, whereas it is agreed by all the =
curious and skilfull of=20

both sexes among us, that such a piece of work could not be performed by th=
e most dextrous pair=20

of hands and finest eyes in Christendom, in less than a year and a half, at=
 twelve hours a day. Yet=20

Mrs. Barber, corrupted by the obligations she hath to you, would pretend th=
at I over reckon six=20

months, and six hours a day. Be that as it will, our best virtuosi are unan=
imous that the Invention=20

exceeds, if possible, the work itself. But to all these praises I coldly an=
swer, that although what=20

they say be perfectly true, or indeed below the truth, yet if they had ever=
 seen or conversed with=20

Your Ladyship as I have done, they would have thought this escritoire a ver=
y poor performance=20

from such hands, such eyes, and such an imagination. To speak my own though=
ts, the work itself=20

does not delight me more than the little afterward at restaurant or club, a=
nd asks a married woman=20

of his acquaintance to act as chaperon, he expects to pay her more attentio=
n and courtesy than he=20

will give to other guests, while at the same time expecting from her an ass=
umption of some of the=20

duties of hostess for the occasion. He may send her flowers if he chooses. =
She must have the=20

seat of honor in the front of the box engaged at the theater and, later, th=
e seat of honor at the=20

supper party.  [Sidenote: THE CHAPERON=E2=80=99S PRIVILEGES]  In return she=
 must exercise her=20

power of pleasing generally and not for the benefit only of the two or thre=
e of the party whom she=20

likes best. Her surveillance of the company is, of course, merely nominal. =
It is taken for granted in=20

civilized society that young people will behave properly. A chaperon is mer=
ely the official sign that=20

the proprieties are observed. She is not an instructress and is not likely =
to be asked to fill the=20

position of chaperon more than once if she assumes to be. Her presence prev=
ents embarrassment=20

and embarrassing situations. It should also act upon the guests as an amalg=
amating agent. At a=20

party of the description given, her business is to mix agreeably the differ=
ent elements of the=20

company.  The duties and privileges of acting as chaperon, in such circumst=
ances, are of so=20

pleasant a kind that the office is a coveted one. Attractive women are much=
 more apt to be asked=20

to fill the position than unattractive ones, except when a chaperon is rega=
rded simply as an=20

offering on the altar of propriety.  Generally speaking, the duties of a ch=
aperon are somewhat=20

various, and more or less arduous, according to the quality of those chaper=
oned. These duties=20

depend so largely upon circumstances that they are not easily classified. I=
t is, of course, the part=20

of the chaperon to smooth over awkward situations, to arrange and make smoo=
th the path of=20



pleasure. It is the duty of the chaperoned to agree without demur to whatev=
er the chaperon may=20

suggest. On any debatable point her decision must be regarded as final.  [S=
idenote: CHAPERONS=20

AT A BALL]  A personal and individual chaperon for every young girl is not =
necessary at a ball. It is=20

ved not the least from=20

lifts a drawer for wax, hath=20

 of a small pin; but it=20

touches onely an end of a cloud; and yet I have been carefull to twist a sm=
