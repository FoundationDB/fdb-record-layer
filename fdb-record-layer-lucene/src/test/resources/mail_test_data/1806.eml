TIES AND dracaena marginata deposited in the castle of St Remy, in the expe=

ndy, having left St Omer, passed through Hesdin, where the duchess was, to =
Douay, where he received the intelligence that the duchess of Brabant had b=
een dead some little time. He was very indignant at having been forced to d=
isband the forces he intended to march to Calais, and for that cause concei=
ved a deep hatred against many of the king of France=E2=80=99s objects as t=

o the singular imprints left by crutches or a walking-stick. The imprint le=

  DEFORMITIES AND _
Burgundy obtained liberty from the king of France and his council to raise =
a sufficient force in his=20

own countries to lay siege to Calais. The king also promised that he should=
 be assisted with men=20

at arms, and as much money as could be raised in the realm.  On this being =
concluded, he=20

returned to his county of Flanders, and issued his summons for all men at a=
rms to meet him at St=20

Omer: evidence, but too much importance should not be attached to them as a=
rticles tending to=20

prove criminality. The futility of such evidence is shown in the varying si=
zes of different=20

impressions of the foot of the same person=E2=80=94first in rapid progressi=
on, secondly by standing, and=20

third by slow advance. The results appear less sure in the case of footprin=
ts made in mud, sand,=20

dust, or snow.=20


_
same time, he prepared many engines of war,=E2=80=94and particularly, he ca=
used to be constructed in=20

the forest of Beaulot two large bastilles, ready to be conveyed to Calais. =
He likewise caused many=20

engines to be made for casting stones at different places.  On the other ha=
nd, the king had=20

assembled a numerous body of combatants, who, like the others, traversed Pi=
cardy in their road to=20

Saint Omer, doing much mischief to the country. Among the number were from =
four to five=20

hundred Genoese, the greater part of whom were cross-bows on foot.  When al=
l were arrived at St=20

Omer, they were found to amount to six thousand armed with helmets, three t=
housand archers,=20

and fifteen hundred cross-bows, all picked men, without including those on =
foot from the countries=20

of Flanders, Cassel, and other parts, who were very numerous. There were ve=
ry many carts to=20

convey bombards, cannons, artillery, provisions, and other necessaries for =
the war. But=20

notwithstanding all these preparations had been made through the applicatio=
n of the duke of=20

Burgundy, and with the full approbation of the king and his council, as has=
 been said, and that the=20

musters were about to be made for their immediate departure, certain messen=
gers came to the=20

duke of Burgundy and his captains, with letters from the noble king of Fran=
ce, to forbid them to=20

proceed further with this army.  The duke, on reading these orders, assembl=
ed a council of war,=20

and remonstrated with them on the commands he had received from the king, s=
aying it was=20

shameful and disgraceful thus to disarm so noble an army as he had assemble=
d. The lords,=20

however, considering that the king=E2=80=99s orders muse be obeyed, conclud=
ed to break up the army, and=20

to return every man to his own country; for the king had also written to th=
e count de St Pol, to the=20

master of the cross-bows[102], and to other great lords, to forbid them, on=
 relating thereto may be=20

noted with great certainty. The question has been mooted as to whether or n=
ot the impress left=20

upon the soil gives always the exact dimensions of the foot that has made t=
hem. One side has=20

contended that the footprints _are a little smaller_, while the other refut=
es this opinion and thinks=20

that they are _a little larger_. The consistency of the soil, which does no=
t seem to have entered=20

into the discussion, doubtless accounts for the small differences that have=
 given rise to this=20

discrepancy of opinion. The outline of the sole of the foot and the relativ=
e position of the toes are=20

more or less neatly designed as the ground is more or less wet or soft. The=
 means employed for=20

taking impressions of foot or other tracks in mud, etc., show considerable =
ingenuity on the part of=20

those who have elaborated the subject. To discover foot-marks in mud, powde=
red stearic acid is=20

spread over the imprint and a heat of at least 212=C2=B0 is applied from ab=
ove. By this means a solid=20

mould may be taken of the imprint. These researches have been extended to t=
he exact=20

reproduction of imprints left upon snow by pouring melted gelatine upon the=
 imprint previously=20

sprinkled with a little common table salt, which rapidly lowers the tempera=
ture of the snow about=20

fifteen degrees and permits the mould to be taken without too much hurry. T=
he study has been=20

extended to the configuration of the plantar imprints in tabetics, but it d=
oes not appear so far to be=20

of much medico-legal value.  The question may arise as to the length of tim=
e since the imprints=20

were made. This would, of course, depend upon many circumstances, as weathe=
r, temperature,=20

and the like. It is a fact that in Greenland footsteps in snow have been re=
cognized many months=20

after they were made. A few summers ago, on an arctic expedition, I climbed=
 Cape Lisbourne,=20

Alaska, in company=20


_
expedition, under pain of incurring his indignation. Thus was this armament=
 broken up on the night=20

of Martinmas-day.  The duke of Burgundy, however, swore by a great oath, in=
 the presence of=20

many of his people, that within the month of March ensuing, he would return=
 to St Omer with a=20

powerful army, and thence march to make war against the English in the Boul=
onois, and subject=20

them to his obedience, or die in the attempt.  The duke and his vassals lef=
t St Omer, and returned=20

to their homes. This retreat caused great discontent throughout Picardy, an=
d the frontiers of the=20

Boulonois, against the king and his council, as well as against those who h=
ad raised this army,=20

and not without cause, for the multitudes that had been collected had done =
infinite mischief to the=20

country.  Sir William de Vienne, lord of St George, and lieutenant-governor=
 of Picardy, resigned=20

this office to the duke of Burgundy, who nominated in his place the lord de=
 Croy. The greater part=20

of the king=E2=80=99s thawed in many places, our feet left very decided imp=
rints in the mud. A year=20

afterward I visited the same spot, and on again making the ascent was aston=
ished to recognize=20

the footsteps made the year before.  Circumstances sometimes direct expert =
attention to vestiges=20

of other animals. The tracks of a dog or of a horse may become the object o=
f a medico-legal=20

inquest. The books record a case in which it was necessary to ascertain whe=
ther a bite had been=20

made by a large or a small dog. This question was settled by producing the =
dogs and comparing=20

their teeth with the scars. Persons familiar with border life know the impo=
rtance of trails and the=20

minute observation that is brought to bear on them by the experienced front=
iersman. In following=20

cattle-thieves and murderers, while with the Fourth United States Cavalry o=
n the Rio Grande=20

frontier, I have known the peculiarity of a horse=E2=80=99s footprint in th=
e prairie to tell a tale of great=20

significance.  Observation in this=20
