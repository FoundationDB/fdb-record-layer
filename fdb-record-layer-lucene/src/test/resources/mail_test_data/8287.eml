Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}   Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK 

SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the 

widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists 

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers almost as large as the palm of one's hand_. This 

is a striking instance to prove that the _initial_ force of this powder, when exploded, is very great, 

but that it extends but a very little way. If it be strewed through a glass tube of three-fourths of an 

inch in diameter, and exploded by a coal of fire or hot iron, the tube may be held in the naked 

hand, and the powder only flashes without breaking the tube, and merely coats it over inside, and 

that very prettily, with the revived quicksilver.   _Fulminating Silver._  Chemists are too well 

acquainted with the tremendous energy of this preparation, to make any comment upon its powers 

necessary. Unhappily, however, it is now made a subject of amusement; it is prepared for sale by 

those who know nothing of it, except as a nostrum, and it is bought by others who have not even 

this degree of knowledge. It is true it

of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is 

critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring that the 

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for generations 

to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a 

secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future 

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how 

your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at 

http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.      Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit little toys called 

torpedoes, and, if exploded one by one, they will ordinarily do no harm; but as they fall into the 

hands of children, we can never be secure that they will be discreetly used.  A very severe 

accident, from the unexpected explosion of this substance, occurred some years since in the 

laboratory of Yale College. (See Bruce's Journal, Vol. I. p. 163.) And, notwithstanding that this 

occurrence was well known in New-Haven, the same accident, only under a severer form, has 

again occurred in that town.  A man who had bought the secret of making fulminating silver, had 

prepared as much as resulted from the solution of one ounce and a half. Apparently, in a great 

measure, unaware of the nature of the preparation, he had placed it, unmixed with any thing, on 

an earthen plate, which stood on a 


_
Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN 

or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at 

http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary 

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your 

state's laws.  The Foundation's principal around, he sat down to distribute the powder upon 

several papers which he had prepared for the purpose; sand and shot are mixed with the powder 

in the papers for the purpose of giving momentum, and of producing attrition when the torpedo is 

thrown, in order to ensure its explosion. Probably also the sand, looking not very unlike the 

powder, may be intended to screen it from view, and thus to preserve the secret,
