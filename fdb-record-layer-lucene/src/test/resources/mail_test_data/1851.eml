Infinity and Omnipresence, which cannot be extraneous to or outside of one =
single atom; and=20

(_b_) that by skipping the whole of the pre-cosmic period--the manifested K=
osmos here being=20

meant--the very root of Occult teaching, he explains only the Kabalistic me=
aning of the dead-letter=20

of the _Bible_ and _Genesis_, leaving its spirit and essence untouched. Sur=
ely the "ranges of=20

perception" of the Western mind will not be greatly enlarged by such a limi=
ted teaching.  Having=20

said a few words on Tohu-vah-bohu--the meaning of which Wordsworth rendered=
 graphically as=20

"higgledy-piggledy"--and having explained that this term denoted Cosmos, he=
 teaches that:=20

Above the dark abyss [Chaos] were the Waters; ... the earth [_la     terre!=
_] was Tohu-vah-bohu,=20

_i.e._, in confusion, and darkness     covered the face of the Deep, and ve=
hement Breath moved=20

on the     Waters when the Spirit exclaimed [?], "Let there be light," and =
    there was light. Thus=20

the earth [our globe, of course] was in a     state of cataclysm; _thick_ v=
apours veiled the=20

immensity of the     sky, the earth was covered with waters and a violent w=
ind was     agitating this=20

dark ocean, when at a given moment the equilibrium     revealed itself and =
light reaeppeared; the=20

letters that compose the     Hebrew word "Bereshith" (the first word of _Ge=
nesis_) are "Beth,"=20

the binary, the verb manifested by the act, a _feminine_ letter;     then "=
Resch," the Verbum and=20

Life, number 20, the disc multiplied     by 2; and "Aleph," the spiritual p=
rinciple, the Unit, a=20

masculine     letter.      Place these letters in a triangle and you have t=
he absolute Unity,     that=20

without being included into numbers creates the number, the     first manif=
estation, which is 2, and=20

these two united by harmony     resulting from the analogy of contraries [o=
pposites], make 1,=20

only. This is why God is called Elohim (plural).   All this is very ingenio=
us, but is very puzzling,=20

besides being incorrect. For owing to the first sentence, "Above the dark a=
byss were the Waters,"=20

the French Kabalist leads the student away from the right track. This an Ea=
stern Chela will see at=20

a glance, and even one of the profane may see it. For if the Tohu-vah-bohu =
is "under" and the=20

Waters are "above," then these two are quite distinct from each other, and =
this is not the case.=20

This statement is a very important one, inasmuch as it entirely changes the=
 spirit and nature of=20

Cosmogony, and brings it down to a level with exoteric _Genesis_--perhaps i=
t was so stated with=20

an eye to this result. The Tohu-vah-bohu is the "Great Deep" and is identic=
al with "the Waters of=20

Chaos," or the primordial Darkness. By stating the fact otherwise it makes =
both "the Great Deep"=20

and the "Waters"--which cannot be separated except in the phenomenal world-=
-limited as to space=20

and conditioned as to their nature. Thus Eliphas in his desire to conceal t=
he last word of Esoteric=20

Philosophy, fails--whether intentionally or otherwise does not matter--to p=
oint out the fundamental=20

principle of the one true Occult Philosophy, namely, the unity and absolute=
 homogeneity of the=20

One Eternal Divine Element, and he makes of the Deity a male God. Then he s=
ays:       Above the=20

Waters was the powerful Breath of the Elohim [the     creative Dhyan Chohan=
s]. Above the Breath=20

appeared the Light, and     above the Light the Word ... that created it.  =
 Now the fact is quite the=20

reverse of this: it is the Primeval Light that  "Perhaps we shall meet on o=
ur road."  "That is not=20

probable."  "Who knows? Chance is so capricious. Adieu, till we meet again!=
 Apropos, should=20

Mazarin speak to you about me, tell him that I should have requested you to=
 acquaint him that in a=20

short time he will see whether I am, as he says, too old for action."  And =
Rochefort went away with=20

one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make D'Artagnan shudd=
er, but D'Artagnan=20

could now see it without alarm, and smiling in his turn, with an expression=
 of melancholy which the=20

recollections called up by that smile could, perhaps, alone give to his cou=
ntenance, he said:  "Go,=20



demon, do what thou wilt! It matters little now to me. There's no second Co=
nstance in the world."=20

On his return to the cathedral, D'Artagnan saw Bazin, who was conversing wi=
th the sacristan.=20

Bazin was making, with his spare little short arms, ridiculous gestures. D'=
Artagnan perceived that=20

he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself.  D'Artagnan slipped out =
of the cathedral and=20

placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes; it was i=
mpossible that Bazin=20

should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him.  In five minutes Baz=
in made his appearance,=20

looking in every direction to see if he were observed, but he saw no one. C=
almed by appearances=20

he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame. Then D'Artagnan rushed o=
ut of his hiding=20

place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the Rue de la Juiverie and=
 enter, in the Rue de la=20

Calandre, a respectable looking house; and this D'Artagnan felt no doubt wa=
s the habitation of the=20

worthy beadle. Afraid of making any inquiries at this house, D'Artagnan ent=
ered a small tavern at=20

the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras. This beverage req=
uired a good half-hour=20

to prepare. And D'Artagnan had time, therefore, to watch Bazin unsuspected.=
  He perceived in the=20

tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied h=
e had seen not=20

twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister. He questioned him, an=
d as the boy had no=20

interest in deceiving, D'Artagnan learned that he exercised, from six o'clo=
ck in the morning until=20

nine, the office of chorister, and from nine o'clock till midnight that of =
a waiter in the tavern.  Whilst=20

he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazin's house=
. It was saddled and=20

bridled. Almost immediately Bazin came downstairs.  "Look!" said the boy, "=
there's our beadle,=20

who is going a journey."  "And where is he going?" asked D'Artagnan.  "Fors=
ooth, I don't know."=20

"Half a pistole if you can find out," said D'Artagnan.  "For me?" cried the=
 boy, his eyes sparkling=20

with joy, "if I can find out where Bazin is going? That is not difficult. Y=
ou are not joking, are you?"=20

"No, on the honor of an officer; there is the half-pistole;" and he showed =
him the seductive coin,=20

but did not give it him.  "I shall ask him."  "Just the very way not to kno=
w. Wait till he is set out and=20

then, marry, come up, ask, and find out. The half-pistole is ready," and he=
 put it back again into his=20

pocket.  "I understand," said the child, with that jeering smile which mark=
s especially the "gamin de=20

Paris." "Well, we must wait."  They had not long to wait. Five minutes afte=
rward Bazin set off on a=20

full trot, urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie, which he was in=
 the habit of using instead=20

of a riding whip.  Scarcely had he turned the corner of the=20


_
Secret Doctrine teaches us that the reconstruction of the Universe takes pl=
ace in this wise: At the=20

periods of new generation, perpetual Motion becomes Breath; from the Breath=
 comes forth=20

primordial Light, through whose radiance manifests the Eternal Thought conc=
ealed in darkness,=20

and this becomes the Word (Mantra).(418) It is _That_ (the Mantra or Word) =
from which all This=20

(the Universe) sprang into being.  Further on Eliphas Levi says:       This=
 [the concealed Deity]=20

radiated a ray into the Eternal Essence     [Waters of Space] and, rushed a=
fter him like a=20

bloodhound on full scent.  Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returne=
d.  "Well!" said=20

D'Artagnan.  "Well!" answered the boy, "the thing is done."  "Where is he g=
one?"  "The half-pistole=20

is for me?"  "Doubtless, answer me."  "I want to see it. Give it me, that I=
 may see it is not false."=20

"There it is."  The child put the piece of money into his pocket.  "And now=
, where is he gone?"=20

inquired D'Artagnan.  "He is gone to Noisy."  "How dost thou know?"  "Ah, f=
aith! there was no great=20

cunning necessary. I knew=20


_
the Essence expanded,(419) giving birth to the Heavenly Man from     whose =
mind were born all=20

forms.   The _Kabalah_ states very nearly the same. To learn what it really=
 teaches one has to=20

reverse the order in which Eliphas Levi gives it, replacing the word "above=
" by that of "in," as rode;=20

it belonged to the butcher, who lets it out now and then to M. Bazin. Now I=
 thought that the butcher=20

would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going. A=
nd he answered 'that=20

Monsieur Bazin went to Noisy.' 'Tis his custom. He goes two or three times =
a week."=20
