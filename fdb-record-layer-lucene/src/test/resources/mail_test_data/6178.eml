sweatingly anxious about something."  Gantry flung his cigarette away and l=
ighted another. After a=20

deep inhalation or two he said: "Let it alone, Evan. I have a hunch that yo=
u'll be happier if you=20

don't try to drag the cover off of that particular cesspool."  "Listen," sa=
id Blount shortly. "When my=20

father turned me down last night I told him that I still had five days in w=
hich to--"  "I know," Gantry=20

nodded. "Just the same, you're not going to do it."  "If I don't, it will b=
e because I can't; because the=20

time is too short." Then, with a sudden and impulsive gesture of appeal: "D=
ick, for Heaven's sake=20

help me to find that man Gryson, if you know where he is! I shall blow up i=
f I can't do something!"=20

Gantry rose and tossed the second cigarette among the coals in the grate.  =
"I've been afraid all=20

along that they'd corner you and beat you to death with feather-dusters," h=
e lamented. "And the=20

only thing I can say will make matters worse instead of better. I have it p=
retty straight that Gryson=20

has been fired--shooed out of town, and probably out of the State."  "Who d=
id it, Gantry?"  "There=20

is only one man in this bailiwick who can take the whip to a fellow like To=
m Gryson. I guess I don't=20

need to name him for you, Evan."  Blount got out commander. "If anything sh=
ould happen to you,=20

or to any of your ship's company, I should never forgive myself."  "I don't=
 see that she will be of=20

any use to us hereafter," suggested the discontented young navigator.  "I a=
dvised her purchase=20

mainly for use in the Mediterranean; and she has certainly been very useful=
, adding very much to=20

the pleasure of the party."  "If you cannot use her, I should think you wou=
ld sell her," added Scott.=20

"Of whatever service she may have been, she seems to be played out, and is =
of no use at all=20

now."  "You are nearer right, Captain Scott, than perhaps you suppose; and =
to be candid with you,=20

I regard the Maud as very like an elephant on our hands."  "Then I hope you=
 will sell her," replied=20

the young man, with something like desperation in his manner. "For my part,=
 I am entirely willing=20

you should do so, sir."  "It is plainly impracticable to make any use of he=
r in the next six months,=20

except in harbor service, and we hardly need her for that," continued the c=
ommander. "I know that=20

Louis and Morris do not wish to go to sea in her again; and I suppose Felix=
 would prefer to be=20

where his crony is."  "Cruising in the Maud is then decidedly a thing of th=
e past," said Scott, with a=20

feeble attempt to laugh.=20
