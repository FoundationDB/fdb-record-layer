Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to id=

realized that he had found the method of presentation for his interior-furn=

secure photographs of the most carefully furnished homes in America.  He im=
mediately employed=20

the best available expert, and within six months there came to him an assor=
ted collection of over a=20

thousand photographs of well-furnished rooms.  The best were selected, and =
a series of=20

photographic pages called "Inside of 100 Homes" was begun.  The editor's wo=
man friend had=20

correctly pointed the way to him, for this series won for his magazine the =
enviable distinction of=20

being the first magazine of standing to reach the then marvellous record of=
 a circulation of one=20

million copies a month.  The editions containing the series were sold out a=
s fast as they could be=20

printed.  The editor followed this up with another successful series, again=
 pictorial.  He realized=20

that to explain good taste in furnishing by text was almost impossible.  So=
 he started a series of=20

all-picture pages called "Good Taste and Bad Taste."  He presented a chair =
that was bad in lines=20

and either useless or uncomfortable to sit in, and explained where and why =
it was bad; and then=20

put a good chair next to it, and explained where and why it was good.  The =
lesson to the eye was=20

word could have done, and=20

began to put on the market the tables, chairs, divans, bedsteads, and dress=

magazine was portraying as examples of good taste.  It was amazing that, wi=

physical appearance of domestic furniture in the stores completely changed.=
  The next=20

undertaking was a systematic plan for improving the pictures on the walls o=

Bok was employing the best artists of the day: Edwin A. Abbey, Howard Pyle,=
 Charles Dana=20

Gibson, W. L. Taylor, Albert Lynch, Will H. Low, W. T. Smedley, Irving R. W=
iles, and others.  As=20

his magazine was rolled to go through the mails, the pictures naturally suf=
fered; Bok therefore=20

decided to print a special edition of each important picture that he publis=
hed, an edition on plate-

paper, without text, and offered to his readers at ten cents a copy.  Withi=
n a year he had sold=20

nearly one hundred thousand copies, such pictures as W. L. Taylor's "The Ha=
nging of the Crane"=20

and "Home-Keeping Hearts" being particularly popular.  But all this was sim=
