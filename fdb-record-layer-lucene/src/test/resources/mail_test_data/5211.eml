warm, I'm stifling. Please, Mr. Mravucsan, could we have the window open?" =
 "Of course," and the mayor ran to open it.  "Button up your coat, Wladin!"=
  A fresh spring air entered by the window, and a slight breeze put out bot=
h the candles.  "Kisses allowed," called out Klempa.  A branch of lilac was=
 just outside the window, _
direct upon us. At the next step that he made, I raised my rifle gently to =
my shoulder, and whistled=20

sharply: in an instant it tossed its head up, and seeing nothing in front, =
as my clothes matched with=20

the leafless bushes, it turned its head to the left, and I immediately pull=
ed the trigger. It fell as=20

though smitten by a sledge hammer, and it lay struggling on the ground. Bac=
heet sprang forward,=20

and with an Arab sword he cut the hamstring of one leg. To the astonishment=
 of us all, the=20

rhinoceros jumped up, and on three legs it sprang quickly round and charged=
 Bacheet, who=20

skipped into the bushes, while I ran alongside the rhinoceros as it attempt=
ed to follow him, and,=20

with Fletcher No. 24, I fired through the shoulder, by placing the muzzle w=
ithin a yard of the=20

animal. It fell dead to this shot, which was another feather in the cap of =
the good little rifle. The=20

skull of the rhinoceros is very curiously shaped; I had fired for the templ=
e, and had struck the exact=20

point at which I had aimed, but, instead of hitting the brain, the bullet h=
ad smashed the joint of the=20

jaw, in which it stuck fast. I never have been able to understand why that =
powerful rifle was thus=20

baffled, unless there had been some error in the charge of powder. This rhi=
noceros had no ears,=20

they had been bitten off close to the head by another of the same species, =
while fighting; this=20

mutilation is by no means uncommon.  From this point I traversed the countr=
y in all directions;=20

upon one occasion I took a large supply of water, and penetrated into the v=
ery heart of the Base,=20

half way between the Settite and the river Gash or Mareb, near the base of =
the mountain chain;=20

but, although the redoubtable natives were occasionally seen, they were as =
shy as wild animals,=20

and we could not approach them.  Having explored the entire country, and en=
joyed myself=20

thoroughly, I was now determined to pay our promised visit to Mek Nimmur. S=
ince our departure=20

from the Egyptian territory, his country had been invaded by a large force,=
 according to orders sent=20

from the Governor-General of the Soudan. Mek Nimmur as usual retreated to t=
he mountains, but=20

Mai Gubba and a number of his villages were utterly destroyed by the Egypti=
ans. He would, under=20

these circumstances, be doubly suspicious of strangers.  My camel-men had c=
onstantly brought=20

me the news on their return from Geera with corn,* and they considered that=
 it was unsafe to visit=20

Mek Nimmur after his defeat, as he might believe me to be a spy from the Eg=
yptians; he was a=20

great friend of Theodorus, king of Abyssinia, and as at that time he was on=
 good your coat,=20

Wladin!"  Wladin heaved a sigh of relief, and undid his coat.  Veronica ret=
urned to the subject of=20

the butterflies.  "I think butterfly catching must be the same to me as hun=
ting is to a man."  "I am=20

very fond of butterflies," answered Gyuri, "because they only love once."  =
"Oh, I have another=20

reason for liking them."  "Perhaps because of their mustaches?"  Veronica t=
urned her head away=20

impatiently.  "Mr. Wibra, you are beginning to be unpleasant."  "Thank you =
for the compliment."=20

"What compliment?"  "You say I am beginning to be unpleasant, which is as m=
uch as to say I was=20

pleasant till now."  "I see it is dangerous to talk with you, for you put w=
ords into my mouth I never=20

intended saying. I shall not speak again."  "I'll never do it again, never,=
 I assure you. Only do talk,"=20

pleaded Gyuri.  "Do the butterflies really interest you?"  "Upon my honor, =
they interest one more at=20

this moment than lions and tigers."  "I think butterflies are so pretty--li=
ke a beautifully dressed=20

woman. And what tasteful combinations of color! I always look at their wing=
s as though they were=20

so many patterns of materials. For instance, look at a Hebe, with its black=
 and red under-wings, do=20

not they match beautifully with the yellow and blue-top wings! And then the=
 Tiger, with its brown=20

and yellow-spotted dress! Believe me, the renowned Worth might with advanta=
ge take a walk in=20

the woods, and learn the art of combining shades from the butterflies."  "G=
ently, Wladin!" called=20



out Mrs. Szliminszky at this moment. "How many lungs have you? A three-kreu=
tzer stamp is=20

sufficient for local letters."  Wladin and Senator Fajka were wondering how=
 matters would stand if=20

they were both very deaf, and Wladin was talking so loudly that his loving =
spouse felt bound to put=20

in a word of remonstrance, and request him to have some respect for his lun=
gs.  "They are quite=20

close to each other, and yet they shout as though they were trying to persu=
ade some one not to=20

put a fifteen-kreutzer stamp on a local letter. Oh dear! When will people b=
e more sensible?"  At=20

that moment, Senator Konopka rose and drank to the health of the host, the =
"regenerator" of=20

Babaszek. He spoke in exactly the same thin, piping voice as Mr. Mravucsan;=
 when the guests=20

closed their eyes, they really believed the master of the house himself was=
 speaking, and=20

sounding his own praises; of course this caused great amusement. Upon that =
up sprang the=20

mayor, and answered the toast in Konopka's voice, with just the same grimac=
es and movements=20

he always made, and the merriment rose in proportion. Kings do this too in=
=20


_
the English, I saw no reason to avoid his country.    * Among other news I =
was glad to hear that my=20

patient     Jali could walk without difficulty.  We arrived at Ombrega, but=
, instead of camping=20

among the thick jungle as formerly, we bivouacked under four splendid tamar=
ind trees that formed=20

a clump among the rocks on the left bank of the river, and which shaded a p=
ortion of its sandy=20

bed; this was a delightful resting-place. We were now only one day from Gee=
ra, and we sent a=20

messenger to the sheik of the Hamrans, who shortly returned with a young gi=
rl of about seventeen=20

as a corn-grinder in the place of Barrake; she was hired from her owner at =
a dollar per month.  My=20

camel-men had determined not to proceed to Mek Nimmur's country, as they we=
re afraid that their=20

camels might be stolen by his people; they therefore came to me one evening=
, and coolly declared=20

that they should return to Geera, as it would be folly to tempt Mek Nimmur.=
 It was in vain that I=20

protested, and reminded them that I had engaged them to accompany me throug=
hout the=20

exploration. They were afraid of losing their camels, and nothing would sat=
isfy them; they declared=20

that they required no wages, as the meat and hide, &c. they had received we=
re sufficient for their=20

services, but through Mek Nimmur's country they were determined not to go. =
Taher Noor was the=20

only man who was willing, but he had no camel. We had constructed a fence o=
f thorns around our=20

camp, in which the camels were now reposing, and, as the argument had becom=
e hot, the Arabs=20

expressed their determination of starting homewards that very instant, and =
we were to be left=20

alone, unless they could persuade other men of their tribe to join us with =
their animals.=20

Accordingly, they at once proceeded to saddle their camels for an immediate=
 start. Without saying=20

another word, I quietly took my little Fletcher rifle, and cocked both barr=
els as I sat within ten yards=20

of the exit from the camp. The men were just ready to depart, and several h=
ad mounted their=20

camels. "Good bye," I said; "give my salaams to the sheik when you arrive a=
t Geera; but the first=20

camel that passes the zareeba (camp) I shall shoot through the head." They =
had heard the sharp=20

click of the locks, and they remembered the firing of the grass on a former=
 occasion when I had=20

nearly burnt the camp;--not a camel moved. My Tokrooris and Taher Noor now =
came forward as=20

mediators, and begged me not to shoot the camels. As I had the rifle pointe=
d, I replied to this=20

demand conditionally, that the Arabs should dismount and unsaddle immediate=
ly: this led to a=20

parley, and I agreed to become responsible for the value of the camels meet=
ings and banquets=20

they pay each other the compliment of dressing up in each other's uniforms;=
 and yet no one thinks=20

of laughing at them.  Toast succeeded toast.  "You have let the dogs loose =
now," whispered Fajka=20

to Konopka.  Mokry drank to the health of the lady of the house, and then M=
ravucsan stood up a=20

second time to return thanks in his wife's name. He remarked that, to their=
 great disappointment,=20

one of those invited had been unable to come, namely, Mrs. Muencz, who had =
at the last moment=20

had an attack of gout in her foot, which was no wonder, considering the amo=
unt of standing and=20

running about she did when there was a fair in their town. Then they all em=
ptied their glasses to=20

the health of the old Jewess.  After the shouts of acclamation had died awa=
y, Wladin Szliminszky=20

called out:  "Now it is my turn!"  "Wladin, don't make a speech!" cried his=
 wife. "You know it is bad=20

for your lungs to speak so loud."  But she could do nothing now to prevent =
him; a henpecked=20

husband is capable of everything; he will button or unbutton his coat, eat =
or drink to order, but=20

refrain from making the speech his brain has conceived he will not; at leas=
t, it has never yet been=20

heard of in the annals of Hungarian history.  "I take up my glass, gentleme=
n, to drink to the fairest=20

flower of the company, beloved by God, Who on one occasion sent down His se=
rvant from=20



Heaven, saying: 'Go down at once, Peter, with an umbrella; don't let the ch=
ild get wet.' Long life to=20

Miss Veronica Belyi!"  Veronica was as red as a rose, especially when the g=
uests all got up one=20

after the other, and went and kissed her hand; some of them even knelt to d=
o it, and pious Mrs.=20

Mravucsan bent down and kissed the hem of her dress.  Gyuri thought at firs=
t on hearing Wladin's=20

peculiar speech that the good man had gone mad, and now seeing every one fo=
llowing his=20

example, was more surprised than ever, and a strange feeling crept over him=
.  "What miracle is it=20

your husband is referring to?" he asked, turning to Mrs. Szliminszky.  That=
 good lady looked at him=20

surprised.  "What! Don't you know the story? Why, it is impossible. It is e=
ven printed in Slovak=20

verse."  "What is printed?"  "Why, the story of the umbrella ... Wladin, yo=
u are very hot, your face=20

is the color of a boiled lobster. Shall I give you my fan?"  "What about th=
e umbrella?" queried Gyuri=20

impatiently.  "It is really strange you have never heard anything about it.=
 Well, the story runs, that=20

when your fair neighbor was a little child, they once left her out on the v=
eranda of the priest's=20

house. Her brother, the priest of Glogova, was in the church praying. A sto=
rm came on, it poured=20

in=20


_
Mek Nimmur's country. The affair was settled.  On March 16th, the day follo=
wing this argument, as=20

we were sitting in the evening beneath our trees in the river's bed, I sudd=
enly heard the rattle of=20

loose stones, and immediately after, a man on a white hygeen appeared from =
the jungle on our=20

side of the river, followed quickly by a string of Arabs, all well mounted,=
 who silently followed in=20

single file towards the ford. They had not noticed us, as we were close to =
the high rocky bank=20

upon their left, in the deep shade of the tamarind trees. I counted twenty-=
three; their shields and=20

swords were slung upon their hygeens, and, as their clothes were beautifull=
y clean, they had=20

evidently started that morning from their homes.  The leader had reached th=
e ford without=20

observing us, as in this wild spot he had expected no one, and the whole pa=
rty were astonished=20

and startled when I suddenly addressed them with a loud "Salaam aleikum" (p=
eace be with you).=20

At first they did not reply, but as I advanced alone, their leader also adv=
anced from his party, and=20

we met half way. These were a troop of Mek Nimmur's people on a foray. I qu=
ickly explained who I=20

was, and I invited him to come and drink coffee beneath the shade in our ca=
mp. Taher Noor now=20

joined us, and confidence having been established, the leader ordered his p=
arty to cross the ford=20

and to unsaddle on the opposite side of the river, while he accompanied me =
to our camp. At first=20

he was rather suspicious, but a present of a new tarboosh (cap), and a few =
articles of trifling value,=20

quickly reassured him, and he promised to be our guide to Mek Nimmur in abo=
ut a couple of days,=20

upon his return from a inflammation of the lungs, or something of the kind,=
 if a miracle had not=20

taken place. An old man appeared on the scene, no one knows from where; he =
seemed to have=20

fallen from heaven, and he spread an umbrella over the child's head."  "My =
umbrella!" burst=20

unconsciously from the lawyer.  "What did you say?"  "Nothing, nothing."  H=
is blood coursed more=20

quickly through his veins, his heart beat faster, he raised his head quickl=
y, with the result that he=20

also knocked his glass over.  "A christening, another christening!" called =
out every one.  "My best=20

wishes," said Mr. Rafanidesz, turning to Mrs. Szliminszky, who blushed beco=
mingly and told him=20

not to talk nonsense.  But the young lawyer would not let her continue the =
conversation; he drew=20

his chair nearer to hers, and said:  "Please go on."  "Well, the gray-haire=
d man disappeared, no=20

one knew how nor where, and those who saw him for a moment swore it was St.=
 Peter."  "It was=20

Muencz!"  "Did you speak?"  Gyuri bit his lip, and saw that he had spoken h=
is thoughts aloud.=20

"Nothing, nothing; please go on."  "Well, St. Peter disappeared, and left t=
he umbrella behind him."=20

"And does it still exist?"  "I should think it does indeed. They keep it as=
 a relic in the church of=20

Glogova."  "Thank God!"  He drew a deep breath, as though a great weight ha=
d fallen from him.=20

"Found!" he murmured. He thought he would have fallen from his chair in his=
 joy.  "And to whom=20

does it belong? To the Church?" asked Gyuri.  "It may be yours once," said =
Mrs. Szliminszky. "It=20

will be Veronica's when she marries; the priest of Glogova told me so himse=
lf. 'It will belong to my=20

sister,' he said, 'unless she makes a present of it=20
