Expectant silence closed in about them. The circle was waiting. In the gree=
nery on the right=20

something made a slow, heavy stir.  TT's lips peeled back from her teeth. H=
er head swung=20

towards the motion, ears flattening, transformed to a split, snarling demon=
-mask. A long shriek=20

ripped from her lungs, raw with fury, blood lust and challenge.  The sound =
died away. For some=20

seconds the tension about them held; then came a sense of gradual relaxatio=
n mingled with a=20

partly amused approval. Telzey was shaking violently. It had been, she was =
telling herself, a=20

deliberate test ... not of herself, of course, but of TT. And Tick-Tock had=
 passed with honors. That=20

_her_ nerves had been half ruined in the process would seem a matter of no =
consequence to this=20

rugged crew....  She realized next that someone here was addressing her per=
sonally.  It took a few=20

moments to steady her jittering thoughts enough to gain a more definite imp=
ression than that. This=20

speaker, she discovered then, was a member of the circle of whom she hadn't=
 been aware before.=20

The thought-impressions came hard and cold as iron--a personage who was ver=
y evidently in the=20

habit of making major decisions and seeing them carried out. The circle, it=
s moment of sport over,=20

was listening with more than a suggestion of deference. Tick-Tock, far from=
 conciliated, green=20

eyes still blazing, nevertheless was settling down to listen, too.  Telzey =
began to understand.  Her=20

suggestions, Iron Thoughts informed her, might appear without value to a nu=
mber of foolish minds=20

here, but _he_ intended to see they were given a fair trial. Did he perhaps=
 hear, he inquired next=20

of the circle, throwing in a casual but horridly vivid impression of snappi=
ng spines and slashed=20

shaggy throats spouting blood, any objection to that?  Dead stillness all a=
round. There was,=20

definitely, no objection. Tick-Tock began to grin like a pleased kitten.  T=
hat point having been=20

settled in an orderly manner now, Iron Thoughts went on coldly to Telzey, w=
hat specifically did she=20

propose they should do?         *       *       *       *       *  Halet's =
long, pearl-gray sportscar showed up=20

above the park grounds, would be a triumphant answer to the insidious and c=
alumnious=20

paragraphs which had circulated during the last six months, and an authenti=
c testimony that=20

Lothair was not going to quit the Church of his fathers.  This announcement=
, however, produced=20

consternation in the opposite camp. It seemed to more than neutralize the a=
nticipated effect of the=20

programme, and the deftly-conceived paragraph. Monsignore Catesby went abou=
t whispering that=20

he feared Lothair was going to overdo it; and considering what he had to go=
 through on Monday, if=20

it were only for considerations of health, an early celebration was inexped=
ient. He tried the=20

duchess=E2=80=94about whom he was beginning to hover a good deal=E2=80=94as=
 he fancied she was of an=20

impressible disposition, and gave some promise of results; but here the gro=
und had been too=20

forcibly preoccupied: then he flew to Lady St. Aldegonde, but he had the mo=
rtification of learning,=20

from her lips, that she herself contemplated being a communicant at the sam=
e time. Lady=20

Corisande had been before him. All the energies of that young lady were put=
 forth in order that=20

Lothair should be countenanced on this solemn occasion. She conveyed to the=
 bishop before=20

dinner the results of her exertions.  =E2=80=9CYou may count on Alberta St.=
 Aldegonde and Victoria=20

Montairy, and, I think, Lord Montairy also, if she presses him, which she h=
as promised to do.=20

Bertram must kneel by his friend at such a time. I think Lord Carisbrooke m=
ay: Duke of Brecon, I=20

can say nothing about at present.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLord St. Aldegonde?=E2=
=80=9D said the bishop.  Lady Corisande shook=20

her head.  There had been a conclave in the bishop=E2=80=99s room before di=
nner, in which the interview of=20

the morning was discussed.  =E2=80=9CIt was successful; scarcely satisfacto=
ry,=E2=80=9D said the bishop. =E2=80=9CHe is a=20

very clever fellow, and knows a great deal. They have got hold of him, and =
he has all the=20



arguments at his fingers=E2=80=99 ends. When I came to the point, he began =
to demur; I saw what was=20

passing through his mind, and I said at once: =E2=80=98Your views are high:=
 so are mine: so are those of=20

the Church. It is a sacrifice, undoubtedly, in a certain sense. No sound th=
eologian would maintain=20

twenty minutes later. Telzey, face turned down towards the open law library=
 in her lap, watched=20

the car from the corner of her eyes. She was in plain view, sitting beside =
the lake, apparently=20

absorbed in legal research. Tick-Tock, camouflaged among the bushes thirty =
feet higher up the=20

bank, had spotted the car an instant before she did and announced the fact =
with a three-second=20

break in her purring. Neither of them made any other move.  The car was app=
roaching the lake but=20

still a good distance off. Its canopy was down, and Telzey could just make =
not involve the coarse=20

interpretation of the dark ages.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGood, good,=E2=
=80=9D said the archdeacon; =E2=80=9Cand what is it your lordship=20
