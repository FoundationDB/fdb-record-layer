fortunes were made by men who are now little more than beggars. To this group belongs the man 

who in spite of reduced circumstances manages still to make one think of top hats and state 

affairs. Although small of stature and almost disabled by rheumatism, he has the fiery dignity and 

straight back that we associate with men who have ruled others. At the same time he might also 

be characterized as a sweet old person, with all the tender reminiscences of the old days and the 

and childish prejudices against all things new. As might be expected, he lives in the past and 

always is delighted whenever he is asked to tell about the only life that he has ever really lived. 

Together with his aged wife he lives with his children and is known to local relief agencies who 

supplement the very small income he now derives from what is left of what was at one time a 

considerable fortune.   REFERENCE  Personal interview with subject, Frank Berry, 1614 West 

Twenty-Second Street, Jacksonville, Florida     FLORIDA FOLKLORE SLAVE CUSTOMS AND 

ANECDOTES  MARY MINUS BIDDIE   Mary Minus Biddie, age one hundred five was born in 

Pensacola, Florida, 1833, and raised in Columbia County. She is married, and has several 

children. For her age she is Carthage even if it is to be assigned to the date to which Mommsen, 

and not to that which Polybius assigns it, shows that before 348 B.C. she had an interest in a wide 

sea-board, which must have carried with it some amount of maritime power.  Now this wealthy, 

and, as we suppose, industrial and commercial city was the chief place, and in course of time 

became the mistress and protectress, of a plain large for that part of Italy, and then in such a 

condition as to be tempting to the spoiler. Over this plain on two sides hung ranges of mountains 

inhabited by hill tribes, Sabines, AEquians, Volscians, Hernicans, with the fierce and restless 

Samnite in the rear. No doubt these hill tribes raided on the plain as hill tribes always do; probably 

they were continually being pressed down upon it by the migratory movements of other tribes 

behind them. Some of them seem to have been in the habit of regularly swarming, like bees, 

under the form of the _Ver Sacrum_. On the north, again, were the Etruscan hill towns, with their 

lords, pirates by sea, and probably marauders by land; for the period of a more degenerate luxury 

and frivolity may be regarded as subsequent to their subjugation by the Romans; at any rate, 

when they first appear

and do her house work. With optimism she looks forward to many more years of life. Her health is 

excellent.  Having spent thirty-two years of her life as a slave she relates vividly some of her 

experiences.  Her master Lancaster Jamison was a very kind man and never mistreated his 

slaves. He was a man of mediocre means, and instead of having a large plantation as was usual 

in those days, he ran a boarding house, the revenue therefrom furnishing him substance for a 

livelihood. He had a small farm from which fresh produce was obtained to the AEqui and Volsci 

have been ludicrously multiplied and exaggerated by Livy; but even without the testimony of any 

historian, we might assume that there would be wars with them and with the other mountaineers, 

and also with the marauding Etruscan chiefs. At the same time, we may be sure that, in personal 

strength and prowess, the men of the plain and of the city would be inferior both to the 

mountaineers and to those Etruscan chiefs whose trade was war. How did the men of the plain 

and of the city manage to make up for this inferiority,
