philodendron monstera  "Hey there! citizens of the Company Marat!"  One of the red-capped men looked up leisurely.  "Your desire, citizen?" he queried with insolent deliberation, for they were mighty men, this bodyguard of the great sands in his glass were running low?  Was it to be his fate to face his glaring murderer until he had not vital power left to grapple with it, or to guard his throat from its hideous fangs?

the door looked out upon the Place below. It was from there that suddenly there came the sound 

of a loud peal of laughter--quaint and merry--somewhat inane and affected, and at the sound 

Chauvelin's pale face took on the hue of ashes and even Martin-Roget felt a strange sensation of 

cold creeping down his spine.  For a few seconds the two men remained quite still, as if a spell 

had been cast over them through that light-hearted peal of rippling laughter. Then equally 

suddenly the younger man shook himself free of the spell; with a few long strides he was already 

at the door and out in the vast hall;  It is but right to add that he did not philosophise much on the 

subject. Having consumed his meal, he lay down beside his gun and slept the sleep of the weary. 

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.  A DESPERATE SITUATION.  Awaking next morning much 

refreshed, but with a keen appetite for more grouse, Dan Davidson sat up and reflected.  He felt 

that, although refreshed, the great weakness resulting from excessive loss of blood still rendered 

him almost helpless, and he knew that making new blood was a process that required good 

feeding and considerable time.  What, then, was to be done?  He had scarcely asked himself the

IV  The clock in the tower of the edifice was even then striking five. The Marats in the hall looked 

up with lazy indifference at the two men who had come rushing out in such an abrupt and excited 

manner.  "Any stranger been through here?" queried Chauvelin peremptorily of the sergeant in 

command.  "No," replied the latter curtly. "How could they, without a permit?"  He shrugged his 

shoulders and the men resumed their game and their argument. Martin-Roget would have 

parleyed with them but Chauvelin had already crossed the hall and was striding past the clerk's 

office and the lodge of the concierge out toward the open. Martin-Roget, after a moment's 

hesitation, followed him.  The Place was wrapped in gloom. From the platform of the guillotine an 

oil-lamp hoisted on a post threw a small circle of light around. Small pieces of tallow candle, set in 

pewter sconces, glimmered feebly under the awnings of the booths, and there was a street-lamp 

affixed to the wall of the old chateau immediately below the parapet of the staircase, and others at 

the angles of the Rue de la Monnaye and the narrow Ruelle des Jacobins.  Chauvelin's keen eyes 

tried to pierce the surrounding darkness. He leaned over the parapet and peered into the remote 

angles of the building and round the booths below him.  There were a few people on the Place, 

some walking rapidly across from one end to the other, intent on business, others pausing in order 

to make purchases at the booths. Up and down the steps of the guillotine a group of street urchins 

were playing hide-and-seek. Round the angles of the narrow streets the near him caused him to 

look quickly round and seize his gun.  But the noise was not repeated, and nothing could be seen 

to justify alarm. Still Dan felt that the sound justified caution; he therefore kept his gun handy, and 

loosened in its sheath the scalping-knife which he always carried in his belt--for eating purposes, 

not for scalping.  Thus he sat for nearly an hour with an uncomfortable sensation that danger of 

some sort lurked near him, until he almost fell asleep.  Then, rousing himself he proceeded to 

breakfast on the bones and scraps of the previous night's supper.  While thus engaged he tried to 

make up his mind what course he ought to pursue--whether to remain where he was until his 

friends should have time to find him--for he felt sure that Okematan would escape and reach the 

Settlement, in which case a search for him would certainly be set on foot--or whether he should 

make a desperate effort to stagger on, and ultimately, if need be, creep towards home.  The pain 

of his wound was now so great as to render the latter course almost impossible.  He therefore 

resolved to wait and give his friends time to institute a search, trusting to another shot at willow-

grouse for a supply of food.  He had scarcely made up his mind to this plan when the rustling in 

the bushes was repeated again.  Seizing his gun, which he had laid down, Dan faced round just in 

time to see the hindquarters and tail of a large grey wolf disappearing in the bushes.  To say that 

he felt considerable alarm when he saw this is not to stamp him with undue timidity, for he would 

have rejoiced to have had the

now easily discernible in the light of the street lanthorns, anon swallowed up again in the darkness 

beyond. Whilst immediately below the parapet two or three men of the Company Marat were 

lounging against the walls. Their red bonnets showed up clearly in the flickering light of the street 

lamps, as did their bare shins and the polished points of their sabots. But of an elegant, 

picturesque figure such as Chauvelin had described awhile ago there was not a sign.  Martin-

Roget leaned in his clutches, then and there, and to engage in single combat with it, weak though 

he was.  What troubled him was his knowledge of the fact that the mean spirited and sly brute was 

noted for its apparent sagacity in finding out when an intended victim was growing too feeble to 

show fight--either from wounds or old age--and its pertinacity and patience in biding the time when 

an attack could be made with safety.  Had this horrible creature discerned, by some occult 

knowledge, that
