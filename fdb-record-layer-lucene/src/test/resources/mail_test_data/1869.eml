dracaena marginata new blanket, which we hope will out-last January. We hav=
e had but one so long uninterrupted spell of sleighing for these many years=

 cold days before and after the 5th, the month has been quite favorable for=

tendency to form mechanical obstructions. Perhaps the occurrence of such in=

decidedly fine, and were I the owner of a whole herd of Jerseys I should en=
deavor to engage this=20

genius to write them up for me. At any rate I think he should be brought We=

PRAIRIE FARMER, the other day,=20

from Springfield, where I was paying a flying visit to the agricultural roo=
ms, a copy of the Reynolds=20

argument for a change in the awarding of sweepstakes prizes on cattle. Mr. =
R. applied it to the Fat=20

Stock Show alone, and I believe the State Board adopted the suggestions. Bu=
t for the life of me I=20

can not see why the principle is not equally applicable to the State Fair p=
remiums, and indeed to=20

similar exhibits at all our fairs. Next year I hope the State Board will ex=
tend the innovation to the=20

State Fair, and from this it may be it will extend to similar organizations=
 of lesser magnitude.         *=20

*       *       *       *  I notice that the National Academy of Sciences h=
ave decided that glucose is not=20

injurious to health. Well, this is good news, at any rate, but it does not =
follow that manufacturers=20

and merchants have the right to mix it with cane sugar or sell it to us for=
 genuine cane sirups, or=20

real honey, or pure sugar candy, or in any of the other ways in which we ar=
e made to pay two or=20

three times what it is really worth. It does not do away with the great nee=
d of a rigorous food=20

adulteration act, though there is great satisfaction in knowing that when w=
e eat it we are not taking=20

in a mild death-dealing potion. But, come to think of it, there are other g=
reat scientists in the=20

country besides those composing somewhat gritty to the teeth, and imparting=
 an earthy and saline=20

taste to the tongue.  1. 120 grains of the powder were put into about a hal=
f ounce of alcohol,=20

digested for six hours, then, washed with more alcohol, filtered and carefu=
lly dried.  2. On weighing=20

the dry powder, the loss appeared to be but one grain, so that it contains =
very little of any=20

substance which is soluble in alcohol.  3. 115 grains (four grains having b=
een lost in the transfer=20

from the filter) were collected and put into rather more than eight times t=
heir weight of cold distilled=20

water, and digested for two hours.  4. This watery solution was then filter=
ed, and on weighing, the=20

residue appeared to be 48 grains, so that 67 grains must have been dissolve=
d.  5. 10 grains of the=20

insoluble residue (4) were put into a flask, with 10 ounces of distilled wa=
ter, and boiled for 1 hour.=20

6. A small portion of this solution, on being tested with nitrate of baryte=
s, gave a copious white=20

precipitate, with oxalic acid, a white cloud; with ammonia, a slight white =
cloud; with muriatic acid, a=20

slight bluish tinge. From these tests it was inferred that sulphate of lime=
 was present, with perhaps=20

a slight trace of muriate of lime.  7. The remainder of this solution was f=
iltered, and on weighing the=20

dried residuum, the loss appeared to be 2 grains, so that sulphate of lime =
probably constitutes=20

nearly  of the insoluble residence (48 grains. 4.)  8. The watery solution,=
 (4) which was supposed=20

to contain 67 grains, was evaporated, and left a residue that weighed but 3=
4 grains, so that 33=20

grains must have disappeared in the process.  9. Some of this residue disso=
lved in distilled water,=20

was tested with carbonate of soda, forming an immediate white cloud; with n=
itrate of barytes, the=20

same; with ammonia, the same; but with oxalate of ammonia, it did not form =
any=20

National Academy. Some of them have decided in a contrary manner. Is it not=
 best to have the=20

question decided by a majority vote of reputable chemists, and then stick t=
o the good old things,=20

whichever way the decision may be? On principle I don't object to suine, ol=
eo, or any of the=20

objectionable articles. All I want is to know when I am buying, and paying =
for them in real genuine=20

dollars. Bogus dollars are every whit as respectable as bogus butter or bog=
us honey, though the=20

law makes it a little unhealthy to use them with any degree of liberality. =
    Letter from Champaign.=20

A light rain yesterday (the 18th) was the first for five weeks, and the fir=
st sign of a January thaw we=20

have had. But it began to snow at dark, continued lightly all night, and ha=
s been snowing, blowing,=20

and drifting to-day up to this hour, 2 P. M. Coming soft at first, that par=
t of it will lay where it fell,=20

and the uncovered portion of the wheat has got a some time, and then it was=
 slight. From these=20

tests it was inferred that sulphate of magnesia was present.  10. A portion=
 of the dried residuum=20

(7) was treated with diluted muriatic acid, which dissolved nearly the whol=
e of it, with considerable=20

effervescence. The new compound, on examination, proved to be muriate of li=
me; so that it may=20

be concluded the residuum (7) was principally carbonate of lime.  On consid=
ering the results of the=20

preceding experiments, it will appear that more than one half of the substa=
nces submitted to=20

analysis, was easily soluble in water, and from the chemical tests used, th=
at it was composed=20

principally of sulphate of magnesia, (Epsom salt) with perhaps a small port=
ion of muriate of lime or=20

magnesia, that of the remainder, about  was sulphate of lime, and difficult=
ly soluble in water; and=20

that the rest was perfectly insoluble in water, and consisted principally o=
f carbonate of lime.  There=20
