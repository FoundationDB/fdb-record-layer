the tyranny, violence, and injustice of the Spaniards towards these       g=
entle lambs, accompanied=20

by cruelty, inhumanity, and wickedness,       most worthy of all fire and t=
orture, which continue in=20

the said       provinces, go on increasing, I cite the following. 37.37. Af=
ter the massacres and=20

slaughter of the war, the people are       condemned, as was said, to the h=
orrible slavery described=20

above.  To       one of the devils, two hundred Indians were given, to anot=
her,       three.  The devil=20

commandant ordered a hundred Indians to be called       before him and when=
 they promptly came=20

like so many lambs, he had       the heads of thirty or forty cut off; and =
said to the others: "I       will=20

do the same to you, if you do not serve me well, and if you       leave wit=
hout my permission."=20

38.38. Now in God's name consider, you, who read this, what sort of deeds  =
     are these, and=20

whether they do not surpass every imaginable cruelty       and injustice, a=
nd whether it squares=20

well with such Christians as       these to call them devils; and whether i=
t could be worse to give the=20

Indians into the charge of the devils of hell than to the Christians       =
of the Indies. 39.39. I will also=20

tell of another such operation; I do not know which is       the more cruel=
, the more infernal, and=20

nearer the ferocity of wild       beasts, this one or that one just told. 4=
0.40. It has already been said,=20

that the Spaniards of the Indies have       tamed and trained the strongest=
 and most ferocious dogs=20

to kill and       tear the Indians to pieces. 41.41. Listen and see, all yo=
u who are true Christians and=20

also you who       are not, whether such deeds have ever been heard of in t=
he world; to       feed=20

the said dogs they take many Indians in chains with them on       their jou=
rneys, as though they=20

were herds of swine; and they kill       them, making public butchery of hu=
man flesh; and one says=20

to the       other; "lend me a quarter of one of these villeins to give to =
my       dogs to eat, until I kill."=20

It is as though they were lending a       quarter of pork or of mutton. 42.=
42. There are others, who=20

go hunting with their dogs in the morning and       when one is asked on hi=
s return for dinner how it=20

has fared with       him, he replies; "it has fared well with me, because I=

law-suits started by some=20

tyrants against others. What can be       filthier, fiercer, and more inhum=
an? 44.44. I will finish with=20

ny such there can be: or=20

s I believe and hold=20

ughter, deaths, and great=20

and horrible cruelties, and most foul       ways of violence, injustice, ro=
bbery, and massacre, done=20

among those       people and in all those countries of the Indies, that wit=
h all I       have described,=20

and those upon which I have enlarged, I have not       told nor enlarged up=
on, in quality and=20

quantity, a ten thousandth       part of what has been done and is being do=
ne to-day. 46.46. And=20

that all Christians may have greater compassion on those       innocent nat=
ions, and that they may=20

more sincerely lament their loss       and doom, and blame and abominate th=
e detestible avarice,=20

ambition,       and cruelty of the Spaniards, let them all hold this truth =
for       certain, in addition to=20

what I have affirmed above; namely, that       from the time the Indies wer=
e discovered down to the=20

present,       nowhere did the Indians harm any Christians, before they had=
       sustained harm,=20

robbery, and treachery from them.  Nay, they always       esteemed them imm=
ortal, and come from=20

Heaven; and as such they       received them, until their deeds manifested =
their character and=20

intentions. 47.47. It is well to add something else, that from the beginnin=
g till the       present day=20

the Spaniards have given no more thought to providing       for the preachi=
ng of the faith of Jesus=20

Christ to these people than       if they were dogs or other animals: nay, =
they have persistently=20

afflicted and persecuted the monks, to prevent them from preaching,       b=
ecause it seemed to=20

them an impediment to the acquisition of the       gold and wealth they pro=
mised themselves in=20

their greedy desires. 48.48. And to-day there is not in all the Indies more=
 knowledge of God=20

among these people, as to whether He is of wood, or in heaven or on       e=
arth, than there was a=20

hundred years ago, except in new Spain,       where monks have gone and whi=
