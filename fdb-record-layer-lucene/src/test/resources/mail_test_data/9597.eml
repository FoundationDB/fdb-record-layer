Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or other person than his patient=
, and excluding from=20

his consideration privileged knowledge.[476] And he may also testify as to =
matters which came to=20

his knowledge before or after or independent of his employment as physician=
,[477] or which were=20

immaterial to his acting in a professional capacity, and as to which his pa=
tient could have had no=20

reasonable ground for believing that they were necessarily disclosed in ord=
er that the physician=20

might so act.[478] It is the patient=E2=80=99s privilege and not the physic=
ian=E2=80=99s; and, therefore, the physician=20

is not absolutely incompetent as a witness, and has no right to refuse to t=
estify.[479] But where he=20

is a party he may object and then he will not be forced to disclose his pat=
ient=E2=80=99s confidence.[480]  In=20

Indiana it has been held that where the patient testifies in an action agai=
nst his physician for=20

malpractice the physician is then at liberty to testify or to introduce any=
 other witness to testify=20

concerning the matters in controversy.[481]  In Michigan, a physician who w=
as plaintiff in a libel=20

suit was not permitted to insist upon the privilege to prevent the disclosu=
re of his maltreatment of=20

his patient or what other physicians had discovered with regard to it by vi=
sits to his patients.[482]=20

The measure of the physician=E2=80=99s exemption and liability in testifyin=
g is the language of the statute,=20

and not his idea of his duty to his patient or the patient=E2=80=99s injunc=
tions of confidence or secrecy.[483]=20

In some of the States there are statutory provisions entitling physicians t=
o sue for compensation=20

for their professional services.[484] The statutes regarding privileged com=
munications are to be=20

construed together with these. There seems to be no reason why a physician=
=E2=80=99s right of action for=20

his services and medicines should not survive the prohibition of his eviden=
ce; but it would seem=20



that he cannot as a witness in such an action testify regarding privileged =
matter. But he can prove=20

it by other witnesses.[485]   THE RESULT OF THE LEGISLATION.  It is doubtle=

Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with th=

luding obsolete, old,=20

 of volunteers and=20

hey have not proved an=20

unalloyed benefit, and some of their features have brought about conditions=
 which in some cases=20

have embarrassed the administration of justice. The law in New York may be =
taken for illustration;=20

it formerly cut off the safest means of ascertaining the mental condition a=
nd competency of a=20

testator;[487] it now precludes a physician from disclosing the condition o=
f his patient who is a=20

lunatic or habitual drunkard,[488] though it be the most satisfactory evide=
nce; it shuts out much=20

testimony tending to show fraud in insurance cases;[489] it precludes a phy=
sician from stating the=20

cause of his patient=E2=80=99s death,[490] though there is no longer any se=
crecy connected with it, for the=20

law makes it the duty of the physician to make, for filing with the local b=
oard of health, a certificate=20

of the probable cause of the death of a patient.[491] It has been the subje=
ct of much adverse=20

criticism,[492] but all such considerations are properly to be addressed to=
 the legislature and not to=20

the courts. It seems to be the most far-reaching in its exclusion, and thou=
