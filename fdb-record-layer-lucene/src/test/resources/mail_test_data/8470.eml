dracaena marginata solid by three coats of sand mortar and as many of marbl=
e, will not possibly be liable to cracks or to any other defect.  7. And fu=
rther, such walls, owing to the solid foundation given by thorough working =
with polishing instruments, and the smoothness of it, due to the hard and d=
azzling white marble, will bring out in brilliant splendour the colours whi=

owing to the solid foundation given by thorough working with polishing inst=

Why, he is a European fool! Upon my word, you could not find another like h=
im all over Europe! He lectures--can you imagine?--as though he were suckin=
g a sugar-stick--sue, sue, sue;... he is in a nervous funk; he can hardly d=
ecipher his own manuscript; his poor little thoughts crawl along like a bis=
hop on a bicycle, and, what's worse, _
and sand, to check any drops that may fall from the joists or from the roof=
. If a supply of Greek=20

reed is not to be had, gather slender marsh reeds, and make them up with si=
lk cord into bundles=20

all of the same thickness and adjusted to the proper length, provided that =
the bundles are not=20

more than two feet long between any two knots. Then tie them with cord to t=
he beams, as above=20

described, and drive wooden pegs into them. Make all the other preparations=
 as above described.=20

3. Having thus set the vaultings in their places and interwoven them, apply=
 the rendering coat to=20

their lower surface; then lay on the sand mortar, and afterwards polish it =
off with the powdered=20

marble. After the vaultings have been polished, set the impost mouldings di=
rectly beneath them.=20

These obviously ought to be made back upon it, I see my whole life as a fin=
e composition=20

arranged with talent. Now all that is left to me is not to spoil the end. F=
or that I must die like a man.=20

If death is really a thing to dread, I must meet it as a teacher, a man of =
science, and a citizen of a=20

Christian country ought to meet it, with courage and untroubled soul. But I=
 am spoiling the end; I=20

am sinking, I fly to you, I beg for help, and you tell me 'Sink; that is wh=
at you ought to do.'"  But=20

here there comes a ring at the front-door. Katya and I recognize it, and sa=
y:  "It must be Mihail=20

Fyodorovitch."  And a minute later my colleague, the philologist Mihail Fyo=
dorovitch, a tall, well-

built man of fifty, clean-shaven, with thick grey hair and black eyebrows, =
walks in. He is a good-

natured man and an excellent comrade. He comes=20

for when they are large, their weight carries them down, and they cannot su=
pport themselves.=20

Gypsum should by no means be used in their composition, but powdered marble=
 should be laid on=20

uniformly, lest gypsum, by setting too quickly should keep the work from dr=
ying uniformly. We=20

must also beware of the ancients' scheme for vaultings; for in their mouldi=
ngs the soffits overhang=20

very played a prominent part in the history of literature and enlightenment=
. He is himself intelligent,=20

talented, and very highly educated, but has his oddities. To a certain exte=
nt we are all odd and all=20

queer fish, but in his oddities there is something exceptional, apt to caus=
e anxiety among his=20

acquaintances. I know a good many people for whom his oddities completely o=
bscure his good=20


_
dangerous.  4. Some mouldings are flat, others in relief. In rooms where th=
ere has to be a fire or a=20

good many lights, they should be flat, so that they can be wiped off more e=
asily. In summer=20

apartments and in exedrae where there is no smoke nor soot to hurt them, th=
ey should be made in=20

relief. It is always the case that stucco, in the pride of its dazzling whi=
te, gathers smoke not only=20

from its own house but also from others.  5. Having finished the mouldings,=
 apply a very rough=20

rendering coat to the walls, and afterwards, when the rendering coat gets p=
retty dry, spread upon=20

it the layers of sand mortar, exactly adjusted in length to rule and line, =
in height to the plummet,=20

and at the angles to the square. The stucco will thus present a faultless a=
ppearance for paintings.=20

When it gets pretty dry, spread on a second coat and then a third. The bett=
er the foundation of=20

sand mortar that is laid on, the stronger and more  Coming in to us, he slo=
wly takes off his gloves=20

and says in his velvety bass:  "Good-evening. Are you having tea? That's ju=
st right. It's diabolically=20

cold."  Then he sits down to the table, takes a glass, and at once begins t=
alking. What is most=20

characteristic in his manner of talking is the continually jesting tone, a =
sort of mixture of philosophy=20

and drollery as in Shakespeare's gravediggers. He is always talking about s=
erious things, but he=20

never speaks seriously. His judgments are always harsh and railing, but, th=
anks to his soft, even,=20

jesting tone, the harshness and abuse do not jar upon the ear, and one soon=
 grows used to them.=20

Every evening he brings with him five or six anecdotes from the University,=
 and he usually begins=20

with them when he sits down to table.  "Oh, Lord!" he sighs, twitching his =
black eyebrows=20

ironically. "What comic people there are in the world!"  "Well?" asks Katya=
.  "As I was coming from=20

my=20

6. When not less than three coats of sand mortar, besides the rendering coa=
t, have been laid on,=20

then, we must make the mixture for the layers of powdered marble, the morta=
r being so tempered=20

that when mixed it does not stick to the trowel, but the iron comes out fre=
ely and clean from the=20

mortar trough. After this powdered marble has been spread on and gets dry, =
lay on a medium=20

second coat. When that has been applied and well N---- on the stairs.... He=
 was going along as=20

usual, sticking out his chin like a horse, looking for some one to listen t=
o his grumblings at his=20

migraine, at his wife, and his students who won't attend his lectures. 'Oh,=
' I thought, 'he has seen=20

me--I am done for now; it is all up....'"  And so on in the same style. Or =
he will begin like this:  "I=20

was yesterday at our friend Z. Z----'s public lecture. I wonder how it is o=
ur alma=20
