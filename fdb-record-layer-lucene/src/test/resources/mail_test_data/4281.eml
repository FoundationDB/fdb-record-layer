counsel as their situation may require."--_Ibid_., p. 39.   FROM THE MINUTE=
S OF THE=20

HADDONFIELD QUARTERLY MEETING  "In Haddonfield Quarterly Meeting, a committ=
ee was=20

kept steadily under appointment for several years to assist in manumissions=
, and in the education=20

of the negro children. Religious meetings were frequently held for the peop=
le of color; and=20

Haddonfield Monthly Meeting raised on one occasion 131 pounds, for the educ=
ation of negro=20

children.  "In Salem Monthly Meeting, frequent meetings of worship for the =
people of color were=20

held by direction of the monthly meeting; funds were raised for the educati=
on of their children, and=20

committees appointed in the different meetings to provide books, place the =
children at school, to=20

visit the schools, and inspect their conduct and improvement.  "Meetings fo=
r Divine worship were=20

regularly held for people of color, at least once in three months, under th=
e direction of the monthly=20

meetings of Friends in Philadelphia; and schools were also established at w=
hich their children=20

were gratuitously instructed in useful learning. One of these, originally i=
nstituted by Anthony=20

Benezet, is now in operation in the city of Philadelphia, and has been cont=
inued under the care of=20

one of the monthly meetings of Friends of that city, and supported by funds=
 derived from voluntary=20

contributions of the members, and from legacies and bequests, yielding an i=
ncome of about $1000=20

per annum. The average number of pupils is about sixty-eight of both sexes.=
"--_Ibid_., pp. 40-41.=20

FROM THE MINUTES OF THE RHODE ISLAND QUARTERLY MEETING OF THE FRIENDS,=20

1769  A committee reported "that having met, and entered into a solemn cons=
ideration of the=20

subject, they were of the mind that a useful alteration might be made in th=
e query referred to; yet=20

apprehending some further Christian endeavors in labouring with such who co=
ntinue in possession=20

of slaves should be first promoted, by which means the eyes of Friends may =
be more clearly=20

opened to behold the iniquity of the practice of detaining our fellow creat=
ures in bondage, and a=20

disposition to set such free who are arrived to mature age; and when the la=
bour is performed and=20

report made to the meeting, the meeting may be better capable of determinin=
g what further step to=20

take in this affair, which hath given so much concern to faithful Friends, =
and that in the meantime it=20

was the cry that went up that bitter hour from the soul of Petrovitch. It w=
as not his first cry to God;=20

for the hand that had drawn a veil over the eyes of his body had been gradu=
ally and gently=20

opening the eye of his soul to another and holier light. What though, at th=
e best, that light was dim=20

and clouded? It was enough for his needs; and in this hour of lonely anguis=
h it shone out with=20

greater clearness than ever before. =E2=80=9CI am a sinful man,=E2=80=9D th=
ought Feodor Petrovitch; =E2=80=9Cand now the=20

last hour of my long day of life has struck. I am going into the presence o=
f God. But there is the=20

dear Bog Sn,[27] and the cross, of which Pope Yefim talks. I hope to be for=
given for the sake of=20

what He suffered there, and to see His face with joy in the resurrection.=
=E2=80=9D  Then thoughts of the=20

past chased each other quickly across his mind, like clouds across a summer=
 sky. All the events of=20

his life seemed to crowd upon him, and to pass in review before him =E2=80=
=9Clike a tale that is told.=E2=80=9D First=20

came visions of his early years,--his village home, his boyhood=E2=80=99s f=
riends, his dear lord, Prince=20

Pojarsky, with the face of Ivan grown older; then his own struggles as a ma=
n,--his efforts to secure=20

an honourable place in the world, to gain wealth, character, and the esteem=
 of all. But these things=20

flitted lightly by, and did not stay. What came and stayed, fresh and vivid=
 as though he saw them=20

even now, were the faces that he loved--faces over which the grave had clos=
ed long ago.=20

=E2=80=9CYesterday they seemed so far; to-day they are close at hand. I sha=
ll see them before another sun=20



has set,=E2=80=9D he thought. The wife of his youth came back, young and fa=
ir as on her bridal day. Scarce=20

younger and not less fair, so like that they seemed to mingle into one swee=
t all-pervading=20

presence, was that child of his heart, so tenderly loved, so deeply mourned=
. As the Hebrew=20

patriarch, casting a retrospective glance over his long and weary pilgrimag=
e, rested the wistful=20

gaze of his dying eye upon one chief unforgotten sorrow--=E2=80=9C_As for m=
e_, when I came from Padan,=20

Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan=E2=80=9D--so it was with Feodor Pet=
rovitch. A passionate=20

yearning swept over him to see his daughter=E2=80=99s face, to hear her voi=
ce again.  By-and-by another=20

change came. It was no longer faces that haunted him, but voices--voices an=
d footsteps. The little=20

feet of his grandchildren pattered around him; he heard their merry shouts,=
 their ringing laughter at=20

their play. He felt tempted to call them; he=20


_
possession, to treat them with tenderness; impress God's fear on their mind=
s; promote their=20

attending places of religious worship; and give such as are young, so much =
learning, that they=20

may be capable of reading.  "Are Friends clear of importing, buying, or any=
 ways disposing of=20

negroes or slaves; and do they use those well who are under their care, and=
 not in circumstances,=20

through nonage or incapacity, to be set at liberty? And do they give those =
that are young such an=20

education as becomes Christians; and are the others encouraged in a religio=
us and virtuous life?=20

Are all set at liberty that are of age, capacity, and ability suitable for =
freedom?"--_Ibid_., pp. 45,46.=20

FROM THE MINUTES OF THE YEARLY MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF VIRGINIA IN 1757=
=20

AND 1773  "Are Friends clear of importing or buying negroes to trade on; an=
d do they use those=20

well which they are possessed of by inheritance or otherwise, endeavoring t=
o train them in the=20

principles of the Christian religion?"  The meeting of 1773 recommended to =
Friends, "seriously to=20

consider the circumstances of these poor people, and the obligation we are =
under to discharge our=20

religious duties to them, which being disinterestedly pursued, will lead th=
e professor to Truth, to=20

advise and assist them on all occasions, particularly in promoting their in=
struction in the principles=20

of the Christian religion, and the pious education of their children; also =
to advise them in their=20

worldly concerns, as occasions offer; and it advised that Friends of judgme=
nt and experience may=20

be nominated for this necessary service, it being the solid sense of this m=
eeting, that we, of the=20

present generation, are under strong obligations to express our love and co=
ncern for the offspring=20

of those people, who, by their labours, have greatly contributed toward the=
 cultivation of these=20

colonies, under the afflictive disadvantage of enduring a hard bondage; and=
 many amongst us are=20

enjoying the benefit of their toil."--_Ibid._, pp. 51, 52, and 54.   EXTRAC=
T FROM THE MINUTES=20

OF THE METHODIST CONFERENCE, 1785  "Q. What directions shall we give for th=
e promotion=20

of the spiritual welfare of the colored people?  "A. We conjure all our min=
isters and preachers, by=20

the love of God and the salvation of souls, and do require them, by all the=
 authority that is invested=20

in us, to leave nothing undone for the spiritual benefit and salvation of t=
hem, within their respective=20

circuits or districts; and for this purpose to embrace every opportunity of=
 inquiring into the state of=20

their souls, and to unite in society those who appear to have a real desire=
 of fleeing from the wrath=20

to come, to meet such a class, and to exercise the whole Methodist Discipli=
ne among them."  "Q.=20

What can be done in order to instruct poor children, white and black to rea=
d?  "A. Let us labor, as=20

the heart of one man, to establish Sunday schools, in or near the place of =
public worship. Let=20

persons be appointed by the bishop, elders, deacons, or preachers, to teach=
 gratis all that will=20

attend or have the capacity to learn, from six o'clock in the morning till =
ten, and from two o'clock in=20

the afternoon till six, where it does not interfere with public worship. Th=
e council shall compile a=20

proper school book to teach them learning and piety."--Rev. Charles Elliott=

Secession front the Methodist Episcopal Church_, etc., p. 35.   A PORTION O=
F AN ACT OF THE=20

GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN 1800.  The Assembly=20

recommended:  "2. The instruction of Negroes, the poor and those who are de=
stitute of the means=20

of grace in various parts of this extensive country; whoever contemplates t=
he situation of this=20

numerous class of persons in the United States, their gross ignorance of th=
e plainest principles of=20

religion, their immorality and profaneness, their vices and dissoluteness o=
f manners, must be filled=20

with anxiety for their present welfare, and above all for their future and =
eternal happiness.  "3. The=20

purchasing and disposing of Bibles believed that if he called they would co=
me to him. At last he=20



heard the footstep that he loved best--so plain, so near, that he thought h=
e must be dreaming.=20

How strangely fancy must be cheating him! Surely that _was_ Feodor--_his_ F=
eodor--trying in jest,=20

as he was wont to do, to steal upon him unawares and surprise him. Surely, =
as in the old happy=20

days, the boy had slipped off his lapti, and was stepping softly and noisel=
essly upon the rugs that=20

strewed the floor. Surely he was close to him now--his breath was touching =
his very cheek. All=20

unconsciously the name escaped his lips, and he called aloud, =E2=80=9CFeod=
or!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_D=C3=A4dushka_=E2=80=9D the voice=20

he loved seemed to answer.  =E2=80=9CO God!=E2=80=9D sobbed the old man, fo=
r the first time completely unnerved,=20

=E2=80=9Cleave me my senses. Do not let me lose myself in vain delirious dr=
eams. Grant that I may give up=20

my soul to thee in peace.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CD=C3=A4dushka, do not be afrai=
d. It is I--it is your little Feodor.=E2=80=9D And now he=20

knew it was no dream, for Feodor=E2=80=99s arms were around him, Feodor=E2=
=80=99s face was buried in his breast.=20

=E2=80=9CDid you think I could leave you, d=C3=A4dushka? Did you think I co=
uld really go away with the others?=20

Of course I pretended to go; but I watched my opportunity, slipped off, and=
 came back to you as=20

soon as I dared. I have been hiding ever since.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy child=
, my child, I must send you from me.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CD=C3=A4dushka, you must not, for I cannot go. Listen--I have sworn=
 upon bended knees before the=20

picture of my saint that where you die there will I die also.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CMy boy, I cannot have it--the old have=20

so little life to give, the young so much!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CD=C3=A4dushka=
, I will not live after you; for am I not yours=20

altogether? My mother is dead, and my father too. You have ever been to me =
instead of both. I=20

have nothing in the world but you. But what need of words?=E2=80=9D said th=
e boy, drawing up his slender=20

figure to its full height; =E2=80=9C_I have sworn_.=E2=80=9D  Petrovitch co=
uld not see how his young face glowed, and=20

his dark eyes shone like lamps of fire; but he heard the tones of his voice=
, which had in them the=20

ring of a steadfast purpose, not proud or self-confident, scarcely even pas=
sionate, only full of a=20

quiet resolute persuasion that he was doing something to which God had call=
ed him.  The old=20

man=E2=80=99s reverence for the sanctity of an oath was rendered stronger b=
y a tinge of superstition.=20

Moreover, he thought this world--where apparently and for the present the i=
nfidel Nyemtzi were=20

victorious--not such a safe and happy home that true hearts need mourn to l=
eave it. Perhaps it=20

would even be well for him to take his dearest treasure with him to the bet=
ter land, and bring Maria=20

Petrovna the little one she had intrusted to his care. Thus it was that whe=
n once more Feodor=20

whispered softly, =E2=80=9CAnd I too, d=C3=A4dushka,--I am glad to die for =
the Czar,=E2=80=9D he only answered, =E2=80=9CFor our=20

monarch, our country, and our God. May he accept the sacrifice, and receive=
 our souls into his=20

kingdom.=E2=80=9D  Just then a servant hastily entered the room. =E2=80=9CF=
ather,=E2=80=9D he said, in great agitation, =E2=80=9Ca=20

horseman is galloping through the streets, crying aloud that the French are=
 coming. Their=20

standards may be seen, he says, upon the Sparrow Hill. And, father,=E2=80=
=9D he added, =E2=80=9Cthe kibitka is=20

ready, according to your orders.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen give me thine arm,=
 Feodor,=E2=80=9D said the old man rising. =E2=80=9COur=20

     That we should weep for=20

thee?=E2=80=9D   The slow hours that had dragged their weary length since t=
he evacuation of the doomed=20

city began, seemed a lifetime to Ivan. He almost felt as if the suspense, t=
he dull, hushed lull of=20

expectation that was not hope and yet was scarcely fear, would never end. B=
ut the end came at=20

length, and from that hour events followed each other with tremendous, bewi=

thereupon resolved,  "5. That there be made a purchase of so many cheap and=

view of distributing them=20

not only among the frontiers of these States, but also among the poorer cla=
sses of people, and the=20

blacks, or bridges). Ivan sprang to the nearest point of observation, and s=
aw some horsemen in=20

fantastic uniforms, and bringing with them a couple of guns, actually cross=
ing the stream. A=20

personage, splendidly attired and surrounded by a brilliant staff, was dire=
cting their movements,=20

and apparently preparing to follow them. This, though Ivan knew it not, was=
 Murat, King of Naples,=20

who was leading the French vanguard, thirsting for glory and plunder, and a=
lready devouring with=20

covetous eyes the fabulous treasures of the Kremlin.  Ivan returned to his =
companions. =E2=80=9CGod has=20

delivered them into our hands,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CWe will let them =
cross the ford, and then--=E2=80=9D  What=20
