Valiant, I force the dwelling of another.     But see, the stars in deepest dark are clouded,       And 

the night shields me like a careful mother.            10  I made a breach in the orchard wall and 

entered. And now I must force my way into the inner court as well.      Yes, let men call it vulgar, if 

they will,       The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;     Yes, knavery, not bravery, call 

it still,       To overreach confiding folk a-bed.  P. 86.9]      Far better blame and hissing, fairly won. 

Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;     This antique path was trod by Drona's son,       Who 

slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.                 11  But where shall I make the breach? 

Where is the spot which falling drops decayed?       For each betraying sound is deadened there. 

No yawning breach should in the walls be made,       So treatises on robbery declare.     Where 

does the palace crumble? Where the place       That niter-eaten bricks false soundness wear? 

Where shall influence. Grevin, while professing originality, really follows the traditions of the farce. 

Jean de La Taille, in his prose comedy _Les Corrivaux_, prepared the way for the easy and 

natural dialogue of the comic stage. The most remarkable group of sixteenth-century comedies 

are those translated in prose from the Italian, with such obvious adaptations as might suit them to 

French readers, by PIERRE DE LARIVEY (1540 to after 1611). Of the family of the Giunti, he had 

gallicised his own name (_Giunti_, i.e. _Arrives_); and the originality of his plays is of a like kind 

with that of his name; they served at least to establish an Italian tradition for comedy, which was 

not without an influence in the seventeenth century; they served to advance the art of dialogue. If 

any comedy of the period stands out as superior to its fellows, it is _Les Contents_ (1584), by 

Odet de Turnebe, a free imitation of Italian models united with something imported from the 

Spanish _Celestina_. Its intrigue is an Italian imbroglio; but there are

Fulfilment of my wishes waits me there.                    12  [_He feels the wall._] Here is a spot 

weakened by constant sun and sprinkling and eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt 

thrown up by a mouse. Now heaven be praised! My venture prospers. This is the first sign of 

success for Skanda's[46] sons. Now first of all, how shall I make the breach? The blessed Bearer 

of the Golden Lance[47] has prescribed four varieties of breach, thus: if the bricks are baked, pull 

them out; if they are unbaked, cut them; can but rarely be found among the predecessors of 

Moliere. In general the comedy of the sixteenth century is wildly confused in plot, conventional in 

its types of character, and too often as grossly indecent as the elder farces. Before the century 

closed, the pastoral drama had been discovered, and received influences from both Italy and 

Spain; the soil was being prepared for that delicate flower of poetry, but as yet its nurture was little 

understood, nor indeed can it be said to have ever taken kindly to the climate of
