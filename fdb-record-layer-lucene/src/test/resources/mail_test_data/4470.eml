And dats why your=20

mamma's named Julia stead of Mary Jane or Hannah or somethin' else--She cos=

den my own freedom. But she was worth it--every bit of it!"  "After that I =
put off my trip back home=20

and made her home my home for three years. Den with our two young children =
we left Floridy and=20

went to the West Indies to live. We traveled bout a bit gettin as far as En=

e whole country was=20

turned upside down. De po niggers went mad. Some refused to work and dey di=
dn't stay in one=20

place long 'nough to do a thing. De crops suffered and soon we had starvati=
on times for 'bout two=20

years. After dat everybody lernt to think of a rainy day and things got bet=
ter."  Edward recalls of=20

hearing his father tell of eating wild hog salad and cabbage palms. It was =
a common occurence to=20

see whole families subsisting on any wild plant not known to be poisonous i=
f it contained the least=20

food value. The freedmen helped those who were newly liberated to gain a fo=
oting. Prior to=20

Emancipation they had not been allowed to associate with slaves for fear th=
ey might engender in=20

them the desire to be free. The freedmen bore the brunt of the white man's =
suspicion whenever=20

there was a slave uprising. They were always accusing them of being instiga=
tors. Edward often=20

heard his mother tell of the "patter-rollers", a group of white men who cau=
ght and administered=20

severe whippings to these unfortunate slaves. They also corraled slaves bac=
k to their masters if=20

they were caught out after nine o'clock at night without a pass from their =
masters.  George=20

Lycurgas was born at Liverpool, England and became a seaman at an early age=
. Edward thinks=20

he might have had a fair education if he had had the chance. The mother, Ju=
lia Gray, Lycurgas,=20

was the daughter of Barbara and David Gray, slaves of the Flemings of Clay =
County, Florida.=20

These slaves were inherited from generation to generation and no one ever t=
hought to sell one=20

except for punishment or in dire necessity. They were treated kindly and li=
ke most slaves of the=20

wealthy, had no knowledge of the real cruelties of slavery, but upon the de=
ath of their owner it=20

became necessary to parcel the slaves out to different heirs, some of whom =
did not believe in=20

holding these unfortunates. These would-be abolitionists were not averse to=
 placing at auction=20

their share of the slaves, however.  It was on this occasion that George Ly=
curgas saw and bought=20

the girl who was to become his wife. Both are now dead, also all of the sev=
eral children except=20

Edward who tells their story here.  Edward Lycurgas was born on October 28,=
 1872, at Saint=20

Augustine, Florida shortly after the return of the family from the West Ind=
ies. He lived on his=20

father's farm sharing at an early age the hard work that seemed always in a=
bundance, and=20

listening in awe to the stories of the recent war. He heard his elders give=
 thanks for their freedom=20

when they attended church and wondered what it was all about.  No one faile=
d to attend church on=20

Sundays and all work ceased in a vicinity where a camp meeting was held. Fa=
rmers flocked to the=20

meeting from all parts of Saint Johns County. They brought food in their la=
rge baskets. Some=20

owned buggies but most of them hauled their families in wagons or walked. T=
he camp meetings=20

would sometimes last for several days according to the spiritual fervor exh=
ibited by those=20

attending.  Lycurgas recalls the stirring sermons and spirituals that rang =
through the woods and=20

could be heard for several miles on a clear day. And the river baptisms! Th=
ese climaxed the=20

meetings and were attended by large crowds of whites in the neighborhood. A=
ll candidates were=20

dressed in white gowns, stockings and towels would about their heads bandan=
a fashion. Tow by=20



two they marched to the river from the spot where they had dressed. There w=
as always some=20

stiring song to accompany their slow march to the river. "Take me to the wa=
ter to be baptized" was=20

the favorite spiritual for this occasion.  As in all things, some attended =
camp meetings for the=20

opportunity it afforded them to indulge in illicit love making. Others went=
 to show their finery and=20

there was plenty of it according to Lycurgas' statement. There seemed to be=
 beautiful clothing, fine=20

teams and buggies everywhere--a sort of reaction from the restraint upon th=
em in slavery. Many=20

wore clothing they could not afford.  There seemed to be a deeper interest =
in politics during these=20

infirmities of noble minds," such as ambition and the love of fame, in whic=
h the selfish element is=20

mingled with one not wholly selfish, and which commend themselves at least =
by their refinement,=20

as contrasted with the coarseness of the merely animal vices, may perhaps b=
e regarded as=20

belonging to the class of phenomena quaintly designated by some writers as =
"pointer facts," and=20

as marking the process of transition. In what morality consists, no one has=
 yet succeeded in=20

making clear. Mr. Sidgwick's recent criticism of the various theories leads=
 to the conviction that not=20

one of them affords a satisfactory basis for a practical system of ethics. =
If our lower nature can be=20

traced to an animal origin, and can be shown to be in course of elimination=
, however slow and=20

interrupted, this at all events will be a solid fact, and one which must be=
 the starting-point of any=20

future system of ethics. Light would be at once thrown by such a discovery =
on some parts of the=20

subject which have hitherto been involved in impenetrable darkness. Of the =
vice of cruelty for=20

example no rational account, we believe, has yet been given; it is connecte=
d with no human=20

appetite, and seems to gratify no human object of desire; but if we can be =
shown to have inherited=20

it from animal progenitors, the mystery of its existence is at least in par=
t explained. In the event of=20

this surmise being substantiated, moral phantasms, with their mediaeval tra=
ppings, would for ever=20

disappear; individual responsibility would be reduced within reasonable lim=
its; the difficulty of the=20

question respecting free will would shrink to comparatively narrow proporti=
ons; but it does not=20

seem likely that the love of virtue and the hatred of vice would be diminis=
hed; on the contrary, it=20

seems likely that they would be practically intensified, while a more pract=
ical direction would=20

certainly be given to the science of ethics as a system of moral training a=
nd a method of curing=20

moral disease.  It is needless to say how great has been the influence of t=
he doctrine of Evolution,=20

or rather perhaps of the method of investigation to which it has given birt=
h, upon the study of=20

history, especially the history of institutions. Our general histories will=
 apparently have to be almost=20

rewritten from that point of view. It is only to be noted, with regard to t=
he treatment of history, that=20

the mere introduction of a physical nomenclature, however elaborate and app=
arently scientific,=20

does not make anything physical which before was not so, or exclude from hu=
man actions, of=20

which history is the aggregate, any element not of a physical kind. We are =
impressed, perhaps, at=20

first with a sense of new knowledge when we are told that human history is =
"an integration of=20

matter and concomitant dissipation of motion; during which the matter passe=
s from an indefinite=20

incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity, and during whi=
ch the retained motion=20

undergoes a parallel transformation." But a little reflection suggests to u=
s that such a philosophy is=20

vitiated by the assumption involved in the word "matter," and that the phil=
osophy of history is in=20

fact left exactly where it was before. The superior complexity of high civi=
lization is a familiar social=20

fact which gains nothing in clearness by the importation of mechanical or p=
hysiological terms.  We=20

must also be permitted to bear in mind that evolution, though it may explai=
n everything else,=20



cannot explain itself. What is the origin of the movement, and by what powe=
r the order of=20

development is prescribed, are questions yet unsolved by physical science. =
That the solution, if it=20

could be supplied, would involve anything arbitrary, miraculous, or at vari=
ance with the observed=20

order of things, need not be assumed; but it might open a new view of the u=
niverse, and dissipate=20

for ever the merely mechanical accounts of it. In the meantime we may fairl=
y enter a caveat=20

against the tacit insinuation of an unproved solution. Science can apparent=
ly give no reason for=20

assuming that the first cause, and that which gives the law to development,=
 is a blind force rather=20

than an archetypal idea. The only origination within our experience is that=
 of human action, where=20

the cause is an idea. Science herself, in fact, constantly assumes an analo=
gous cause for the=20

movements of the universe in her use of the word "law," which necessarily c=
onveys the notion, not=20

merely of observed co-existence and sequence, but of the intelligent and co=
nsistent action of a=20

higher power, on which we rely in reasoning from the past to the future, as=
 we do upon=20

consistency in the settled conduct of a man.  Unspeakably momentous, howeve=
r, we once more=20

admit, the=20


_
Mass meetings, engineered by "carpet baggers" were often held and largely a=
ttended, although=20

the father of Edward did not hold with these activities very much. He often=
 heard the preacher=20

point out Negroes who attended the meetings and attained prominence in poli=
tics as an example=20

for members of his flock to follow. He believes he recalls hearing the name=
 of Joseph Gibbs.  Next=20

to the preacher, the Negro school teacher was held in greatest respect. Unt=
il the year of the=20

"shake" (earthquake of 1886) there were no Negro school teachers on Saint J=
ohn's County and no=20

school buildings. They attended classes at the fort and were taught by a wh=
ite woman who had=20

come from "up nawth" for this purpose. Edward was able to and great is the =
debt of gratitude due=20

to its illustrious authors. Yet it seems not unreasonable to ask whether in=
 some respects we are=20

not too much under its immediate influence, and whether the revolution of t=
hought, though=20

destined ultimately to be vast, may not at present have somewhat overpassed=
 its bounds. Is it not=20

possible that the physical origin of man may be just now occupying too larg=
e a space in our minds=20

compared with his ulterior development and his final destiny? With our eyes=
 fixed on the=20

"Descent," newly disclosed to us, may we not be losing sight of the _Ascent=
_ of man?  There=20

seems in the first place, to be a tendency to treat the origin of a being a=
