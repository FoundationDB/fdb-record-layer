CHAPTER XXIII  TACTICS   It was a fortnight since Hugo Tancred arrived at W=
ren's End, and Jan=20

had twice put off Peter's visit.  During the first few days Hugo's temperat=
ure remained so high that=20

she grew thoroughly alarmed; and in spite of his protestations that he was =
"quite used to it," she=20

sent for the doctor. Happily the doctor in his youth had been in the East a=
nd was able to reassure=20

her. His opinion, too, had more weight with Hugo on this account, and thoug=
h he grumbled he=20

consented to do what the doctor advised. And at the end of a week Hugo was =
able to come=20

downstairs, looking very white and shaky. He lay out in the garden in a dec=
k-chair for most of the=20

day and managed to eat a good many of the nourishing dishes Hannah prepared=
 for him.  It had=20

been a hard time for Jan, as Hugo was not an invalid who excited compassion=
 in those who had to=20

wait upon him. He took everything for granted, was somewhat morose and exac=
ting, and made no=20

attempt to control the extreme irritability that so often accompanies fever=
.  When the fever left him,=20

however, his tone changed, and the second stage, indicated by Tony as "sad,=
" set in with severity.=20

His depression was positively overwhelming, and he seemed to think that its=
 public manifestation=20

should arouse in all beholders the most poignant and respectful sympathy.  =
Poor Jan found it very=20

difficult to behave in a manner at all calculated to satisfy her brother-in=
-law. She had not, so far,=20

uttered one word of reproach to him, but she _would_ shrink visibly when he=
 tried to discuss his=20

wife, and she could not even pretend to believe in the deep sincerity of a =
grief that seemed to find=20

such facile solace in expression. The mode of expression, too, in hackneyed=
, commonplace=20

phrases, set her teeth on edge.  She knew that poor Hugo--she called him "p=
oor Hugo" just then--

thought her cold and unsympathetic because she rather discouraged his outpo=
urings; but Fay's=20

death was too lately-lived a tragedy to make it possible for her to talk of=
 it--above all, with him; and=20

after several abortive attempts Hugo gave up all direct endeavour to make h=
er.  "You are terribly=20

Scotch, Jan," he said one day. "I sometimes wonder whether anything could m=
ake you _really_=20

feel."  Jan looked at him with a sort of contemptuous wonder that caused hi=
m to redden angrily,=20

but she made no reply.  He was her guest, he was a broken man, and she knew=
 well that they had=20

not yet even approached their real difference.  Two people, however, took H=
ugo's attitude of=20

profound dejection in the way he expected and liked it to be taken. These w=
ere Mr. Withells and=20

Hannah.  Mr. Withells did not bear Jan a grudge because of her momentary la=
pse from good=20

manners. In less than a week from the unfortunate interview in the nut-walk=
 he had decided that=20

she could not properly have understood him; and that he had, perhaps, sprun=
g upon her too=20

suddenly the high honour he held in store for her.  So back he came in his =
neat little two-seater car=20

to call at Wren's End as if nothing had happened, and Jan, guiltily conscio=
us that she _had_ been=20

very rude, was only too thankful to accept the olive-branch in the spirit i=
n which it was offered.  He=20

took to coming almost as often as before, and was thoroughly interested and=
 commiserating when=20

he heard that poor Mrs. Tancred's husband had come home from India and been=
 taken ill almost=20

immediately on arrival. He sent some early strawberries grown in barrels in=
 the houses, and with=20

them a note conjuring Jan "on no account to leave them in the sickroom over=
night, as the smell of=20

fruit was so deleterious."  Hannah considered Hugo's impenetrable gloom a m=
ost proper and=20

husbandly tribute to the departed. She felt that had there been a Mr. Hanna=
h she could not have=20



wished him to show more proper feeling had Providence thought fit to snatch=
 her from his side. So=20

she expressed her admiration in the strongest of soups, the smoothest of cu=
stards, and the most=20

succulent of mutton-chops. Gladly would she have commanded Mrs. Earley to s=
lay her fattest=20

cockerels for the nourishment of "yon poor heartbroken young man," but that=
 she remembered=20

(from her experience of Fay's only visit) that no one just home from India =
will give a thank-you for=20

chickens.  Jan had cause to bless kind Mr. Withells, for directly Hugo was =
able for it, he came with=20

his largest and most comfortable car, driven by his trustworthy chauffeur, =
to take the invalid for a=20

run right into Wiltshire. He pressed Jan to go too, but she pleaded "things=
 to see to" at home.=20

Hugo had seen practically nothing of Meg. She was fully occupied in keeping=
 the children out of=20

their father's way. Little Fay "pooah daddied" him when they happened to me=
et, and Tony stared=20

at him in the weighing, measuring way Hugo found so trying, but Meg neither=
 looked at him nor did=20

she address any remark whatever to him unless she positively could not help=
 it.  Meg was=20

thoroughly provoked that he should have chosen to turn up just then. She ha=
d been most anxious=20

that Peter should come. Firstly, because, being sharply observant, she had =
come to the=20

conclusion that his visit would be a real pleasure to Jan, and secondly, be=
cause she ardently=20

desired to see him herself that she might judge whether he was "at all good=
 enough."  And now=20

her well-loved Jan, instead of looking her best, was growing thin and hagga=
rd, losing her colour,=20

and her sweet serenity, and in their place a patient, tired expression in h=
er eyes that went to Meg's=20

heart.  She had hardly seen Jan alone for over a week; for since Hugo came =
downstairs Meg had=20

taken all her meals with the children in the nursery, while Jan and Hugo ha=
d theirs in the rarely-

used dining-room. The girls breakfasted together, as Hugo had his in his ro=
om, but as the children=20

were always present there was small chance of any confidential conversation=
.  The first afternoon=20

Mr. Withells took Hugo for a drive, Meg left her children in Earley's care =
the minute she heard the=20

car depart, and went to look for Jan in the house.  She found her opening a=
ll the windows in the=20

dining-room. Meg shut the door and sat on the polished table, lit a cigaret=
te and regarded her own=20

pretty swinging feet with interest.  "How long does Mr. Tancred propose to =
stay?" she asked.=20

"How can I tell," Jan answered wearily, as she sat down in one of the deep =
window-seats. "He has=20

nowhere to go and no money to go with; and, so far, except for a vague allu=
sion to some tea-

plantation in Ceylon, he has suggested no plans. Oh, yes! I forgot, there w=
as something about=20

fruit-farming or vine-growing in California, but I fancy considerable capit=
al would be needed for=20

that."  "And how much longer do you intend to keep Mr. Ledgard waiting for =
_his_ visit?"  "It would=20

be small pleasure for Mr. Ledgard to come here with Hugo, and horrid for Hu=
go, for he knows=20

perfectly well what Peter ... Mr. Ledgard thinks of him."  "But if friend H=
ugo knew Mr. Ledgard was=20

coming, might it not have an accelerating effect upon his movements? You co=
uld give him his fare-

-single, mind--to Guernsey. Let him go and stay with his people for a bit."=
  Jan shook her head. "I=20
