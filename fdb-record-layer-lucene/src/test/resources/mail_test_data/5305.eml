the passage to which he had just been listening.  "How happy that woman mus=
t have been!--so=20

much happier than if the Lord had granted her prayer directly!"  "I don't s=
ee why," said Sophy.  "Do=20

you not?" cried Benoni. "Why, if the Lord had made her child well at once, =
she would never have=20

heard that delightful word, 'O woman, great is thy faith!' I always fancy t=
hat the Lord smiled upon=20

her as he said that, but that he sighed when he said to Peter, 'O thou of l=
ittle faith, wherefore didst=20

thou doubt?' I suppose," continued the boy, "that both the woman and St. Pe=
ter really loved and=20

served their Master, but he spoke very differently to them. Sometimes I thi=
nk--perhaps it is a=20

childish thought--that when God's people have no more troubles, and they ar=
e welcomed up to=20

glory, and see that what looked wrong really was right, those who _trusted_=
 most will be those to=20

_rejoice_ the most. To some, then, the Saviour may say, 'Great was thy fait=
h;' and oh, the delight=20

to hear him say _that_! But I'm afraid that to most he will rather say, 'Th=
ou of little faith, why didst=20

thou doubt?'"  These words from the lips of a child were as a soft warm bre=
eze from the south,=20

melting and stirring the ice round the heart. Sophy felt that her sullen mi=
strust was dishonoring her=20

Lord, and that, had _she_ been in the place of the woman of Canaan, the fir=
st discouragement=20

would have driven her away from the Saviour. The blind girl made no reply, =
but a few minutes=20

afterwards she said, "I'll go to church this morning; there's really nothin=
g to hinder me."  "Yes, yes,=20

we will all go together!" cried Benoni, cheerfully giving up at once, and w=
ithout any apparent=20

regret, the plan of going to Westminster Abbey, a place too distant for Sop=
hy to walk to. It was=20

agreed that the three should, as usual, attend service in their own parish =
church.  And Sophy, like=20

many other sorrowful ones, found the Saviour in the temple of God. Her burd=
en grew lighter as=20

she listened to the numerous voices around her joining in singing the prais=
e of the Lord. She=20

thought of the multitudes clothed in white robes, come out of _great tribul=
ation_, and felt that those=20

who will share such bliss _then_, may learn _now_ to _glory in tribulations=
 also_.  Sophy and the=20

Isaacs were among the last to quit Marylebone church. As the blind girl slo=
wly walked down the=20

steps under the portico, she was almost startled by the joyful exclamation,=
 "Hurrah! I've found=20

them at last!"  "Ned Franks!" cried Isaacs and Benoni in a breath. It would=
 be difficult to decide=20

who was most delighted by a meeting so unexpected,--Franks, or those whom h=
e had so=20

anxiously sought. Isaacs invited his friend to go home with him; then almos=
t repented having done=20

so, for he was ashamed of his miserable abode. Benoni was secretly glad tha=
t for once there was=20

something better than a crust to offer to the guest.  Franks was so eager t=
o tell his good news, that=20

he could scarcely wait till they had reached a more quiet place than the Ma=
rylebone Road. His=20

eagerness was greatly increased by the poverty betrayed by the appearance o=
f his friends. "Help=20

has not come before it was needed," he thought, as he looked at their thin,=
 sunken features, and=20

their shabby, though still decent, dress. "How thankful I am that I came on=
 this cruise! and doubly=20

thankful that I did not start for Colme this morning, and so lose the prize=
 which was right ahead of=20

me!"  Franks kept his great secret tolerably well, only letting the fact th=
at he had some good news=20

ooze out a little, till the party had entered together the gloomy lodging o=
f Isaacs. Then, indeed, he=20

enjoyed to the full that feast to a kindly heart, the power of imparting gl=
ad tidings. The very=20

bareness of the kitchen seemed to make his message brighter, like a dark ba=
ckground setting off=20

a pattern of gold. Isaacs' grave features relaxed into a smile; Benoni clap=
ped his thin hands and=20

could hardly keep from shouting; Sophy looked at first as if she could hard=
ly believe what she=20

heard, then clasped her hands and raised her sightless eyes towards heaven.=
  "Father," cried=20



Benoni, "you said that if you'd but a little capital to start with, you cou=
ld make your way"--Isaacs=20

hurriedly stopped him short by gesture and glance.  "I shall advise Sophy h=
ow to lay out her little=20

property to the best advantage for herself," said the Jew.  "And that is by=
 your taking it, using it,=20

doing what you will with it!" cried Sophy with      money paid for a work o=

child; have you not said again and again that our purse should always be on=

ours and my brother's;=20

let it start you in business, and we will all share together whatever your =

rather throw the money into the street, and myself go into the workhouse, t=

not enjoy it with you and my dear Benoni!"  "The lass says well," observed =
Franks. "Her money=20

can't be better laid out than in giving you the power to support all three.=
"  "I might take it as a loan,=20

if Sophy would trust me," said Benjamin Isaacs.  "_Trust you!_" exclaimed t=
he blind girl, while=20

joyful tears coursed down her cheeks; "you to whom I owe so much, you who h=
ave been to me as=20

a father, from whom I deserved nothing, and yet have received everything! I=
t would be strange=20

indeed if I could not trust you!"  Did conscience then whisper to Sophy tha=
t it had been stranger=20

still that she should mistrust One who _like as a father pitieth his childr=
en_, who had loved and=20

watched over her from her cradle, and would love and bless her even to the =
end?  And so the long=20

struggle with poverty came to a close with Benjamin Isaacs. From that time =
he was to be as=20

successful in business as he had formerly been unfortunate. The working jew=
eller was to realize=20

how true is the Word of God, _The blessing of the Lord it maketh rich, and =
he addeth no sorrow=20

with it_. Sophy laid out her little property to very good interest when she=
 lent it to her father by=20

adoption. The blind girl never recovered her bodily sight, but the darkness=
 had passed from her=20

soul; she had learned to _rejoice in the Lord_, and to wait with trustful h=
ope for the day when all=20

clouds of sorrow and mists of doubts shall be rolled away forever.     XXXI=
.  The Baronet's Return.=20

Ned Franks had an exceedingly pleasant journey home. He arrived at Colme in=
 high spirits, and=20

received a joyful welcome from Persis; to whom he gave a very amusing accou=
nt of all his=20

adventures in London, and of their happy conclusion.  Persis, on her part, =
had a good deal to tell,=20

though, like a sensible wife, she let her husband first have out his say. S=
he told of her visit to=20

Nancy Sands. Franks listened to her account with interest and pleasure; and=
, when he heard that=20

the poor woman had attended church upon Sunday, his honest blue eyes lighte=
d up with an=20

expression of joy.  "It's a real pleasure," he cried, "to see a fellow-crea=
ture lifted out of poverty, and=20

given a good start in life, like Benjamin Isaacs; but it's a still greater =
pleasure to see a poor sinner=20

that was going to ruin raised out of the mire, and turning her face towards=
 Zion. O Persis! I trust=20

that there's many a one that man would have rooted up as worthless tares th=
at will be found in the=20

heavenly garner at last!"  "And poor Ben Stone is, I hear, far more anxious=
 about his soul than he=20

ever was before," said Persis. "I do trust that he is now resting on sure g=
round; that he is giving up=20

all vain hopes of being saved by anything but living faith in the one great=
 Sacrifice for sin."  "You=20

and I are exchanging good tidings, my Persis," said Franks. "All seems brig=
ht sunshine now, within=20

as well as without, in this glorious month of June."  "I cannot quite say t=
hat, dear Ned. We had=20

something of a cloud sweeping over Colme yesterday in the shape of a carria=
ge and four, with=20

postilion and post-horn, dashing through the village during church-time, on=
 the way to the Hall."=20

"You don't mean to tell me that young Sir Lacy Barton has come to take poss=
ession of his=20

property!" exclaimed Ned Franks, looking startled at the news. "I had hoped=
 with all my heart and=20

soul that he would have kept away for years. You know that I had but too go=
od an opportunity of=20

judging of the character of that young man when I was a sailor on board the=
 same man-of-war in=20

which he was serving. I don't like to think ill, still less to speak ill, o=
f any one who has served under=20

the dear old Union-jack of England; but I should be sorry to think that the=
 queen has another=20



officer to match that young scapegrace, Barton. I wish that the old baronet=
 had lived till he was a=20

hundred years old; it might have saved our village from the mischief which =
must be brought by the=20

influence and example of such a man as his son."  Ned Franks, who had been =
doing all in his=20

power to train the village boys under his charge to be not only good schola=
rs but good Christians,=20

felt like a shepherd who hears that a bear has been let loose in the midst =
of his flock. The lord of=20

the manor would be like a little king at Colme amongst his tenants, and his=
 influence for good or=20

for evil would be very extensive indeed.  "The new baronet did indeed drive=
 to the Hall yesterday,"=20

said Persis, "and he took good care that all the village should know of his=
 arrival; for, as he dashed=20

past the church where we were listening to Mr. Leyton's sermon, the post-bo=
y blew a loud flourish=20

on his horn. The church doors were open on account of the heat, so you may =
imagine the effect of=20

the trampling of horses, and the sudden loud blast upon our little congrega=
tion. Every one turned=20

his head round, half the people rose from their seats, some of the children=
 ran out of church to see=20

the great man drive past! One could hardly blame them, poor little things. =
It was strange in Sir=20

Lacy to return thus to the home of his poor dead father."  "Just like him, =
just like him," muttered=20

Franks.  "You should have seen how our young curate flushed up to his foreh=
ead, and for a=20

moment or two could hardly go on with his sermon," said Persis.  "It was a =
personal insult to Mr.=20

Leyton for Sir Lacy Barton to have the horn blown at the very door of his c=
hurch," cried Franks. "It=20

is the more strange that the baronet should behave thus, as our curate is h=
is own cousin, and, I've=20

heard, the heir to his title and property."  "Sir Lacy might not like him t=
he better for  Project=20

 of the Project=20

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely =
shared with anyone.  For=20

thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with =
only a loose network=20

of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from s=
everal printed=20

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a =
copyright notice is=20

included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any p=
articular paper=20

edition.  Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's=
 eBook number, often=20

in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML=
 and others.=20

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old=
 filename and etext=20
