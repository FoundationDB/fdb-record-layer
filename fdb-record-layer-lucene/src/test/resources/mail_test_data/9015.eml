in its glow--two of them. The torch itself was wedged in a crack of the roc=
k, and beneath its flame=20

the couple seemed to tug and wrench at something that gleamed darkly, like =
a great metal=20

toadstool at the bottom of the depression. So engrossed were the workers th=
at they did not notice=20

Parr and his companions, and Parr, drawing near, had time to recognize both=
.  One was Sadau,=20

who would have remained his friend. The other was Varina Pemberton. In the =
coming up the hill?=20

OLD WOMAN. I thought I heard the noise I used to hear when my friends came =
to visit me. [_She=20

begins singing half to herself._]      I will go cry with the woman,     Fo=
r yellow-haired Donough is=20

dead,     With a hempen rope for a neckcloth,     And a white cloth on his =
head,--  MICHAEL=20

[_coming from the door_]. What is that you are singing, ma'am?  OLD WOMAN. =
Singing I am=20

about a man I knew one time, yellow-haired Donough, that=20


_
when he had seen her last.  "What are you doing?" he called to them.  Abrup=
tly they both snapped=20

erect and looked toward him. Sadau seized the torch and whirled it on high,=
 shedding light. Varina=20

Pemberton peered at the newcomers.  "Oh," she said, "it's you. Parr. Well, =
get out of here."  Parr=20

stood his ground, studying the toadstool-thing they had been laboring loude=

 ploughing his field,=20

Turning up the red side of the ground,      And building his barn on the hi=

sprouted from the floor of rock. By turning it, they could finish opening a=
 great rock-faced panel=20

near by....  "Get out," repeated the girl, with a hard edge on her voice.  =
Parr felt himself grow=20

angry. "Take it easy," he said. "Your crowd booted me out, and I'm not unde=
r your rule any more.=20

Neither can this be said to be your country. We've as much right here as yo=
u."  "Four of us," added=20

Ruba with threatening logic. "Two of you. Fight, uh?"  "Parr," said Sadau, =
"do as Miss Pemberton=20

tells you. Leave here."  "And if I don't?" temporized Parr, who felt the ea=
gerness of his beast-men=20

for some sort of a skirmish.  Varina Pemberton took something from her belt=
 and pointed it. A=20

brittle report resounded--_whick_! And an electro-automatic pellet exploded=
 almost between Parr's=20

feet, digging  PETER [_aside to_ BRIDGET]. Her trouble has put her wits ast=
ray.  MICHAEL. Is it=20

long since that song was made? Is it long since he got his death?  OLD WOMA=
N. Not long, not=20

long. But there were others that died for love of me a long time ago.  MICH=
AEL. Were they=20

neighbours of your own, ma'am?  OLD WOMAN. Come here beside me and I'll tel=

them. [MICHAEL _sits down beside her at the hearth._] There was a red man o=
f the O'Donnells=20

from the north, and a man of the O'Sullivans from the south, and there was =
one Brian that lost his=20

life at Clontarf by the sea, and there were a great many in the west, some =
that died hundreds of=20

years ago, and there are some that will die to-morrow.  MICHAEL. Is it in t=
he west that men will die=20

to-morrow?  OLD WOMAN. Come nearer, nearer to me.=20
