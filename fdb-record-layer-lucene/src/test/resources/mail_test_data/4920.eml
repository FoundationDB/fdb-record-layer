tangle was growing clearer now.  The very best she could hope was to make J=

she thought. And that would mean she would have to drop Dwight and all chan=
ce of meeting those=20

people he knew. She would live with a Joe so suspicious that she would be u=

Fanny Carr. "She'll be my friend, and bring me in touch with whatever other=
 people she likes. I'll=20

have to be nice to them--every one. And I'll live her life. Amy's life." Sh=
e looked at the large=20

. How do I know what she=20

was at my age? As I grow older, all hemmed in, why not stop caring for anyt=
hing else?  "Oh, now=20

do let's be sensible!" With an impatient movement of her lithe beautiful fi=
gure Ethel was up off the=20

bed and walking the room with grim resolution in her brown eyes. Soon she w=
as much quieter.=20

She felt the warm youth within her rise. There must be a way! So far, so go=

she tried to think what way, again at once she was off her ground. What cou=

Joe? Her failure to manage him that afternoon had shaken her confidence in =
herself. Ethel was=20

twenty-five, and now she felt even younger than that. All at once in a sick=
ening way her courage=20

oozed; she felt herself ignorant and alone. Why did not Joe come back, she =
asked. Was he going=20

to stay away all night? And if he did, what would it mean? She remembered w=
hat he had said=20

when he left: "Then you and I are through, you know." All right, then what =
was he going to do! "I=20

don't even know how a man goes about it, if he wants to get a divorce!" And=
 panic seized her as=20

before. "I can't do this all by myself! I can't talk to him as I've got to =
talk--not till I know just what to=20

say! I bungled it so! I need sound advice! Oh, for somebody to help me!" Sh=
e thought of Dwight,=20

ad not he told her of=20

if she did want to see him, could she, without being watched by some wretch=

whole town seemed bristling with detectives and police. And the city of New=

long ago, her first in New York, when she had listened excitedly and though=
