for them too, with solemn warnings to the rebels, close this psalm of glad submission. It is 

remarkable for the absence of all petitions. He needs nothing beyond what he has. As the 

companion psalm says, his soul "is satisfied." Communion with God has its moments of restful 

blessedness, when desire is stilled, and expires in peaceful fruition.  The other psalms of this 

period must be left unnoticed. The same general tone pervades them all. In many particulars they 

closely resemble those of the Sauline period. But the resemblance fails very significantly at one 

point. The emphatic assertion of his innocence is gone for ever. Pardoned indeed he is, cleansed, 

conscious of God's favour, and able to rejoice in it; but carrying to the end the remembrance of his 

sore fall, and feeling it all the more penitently, the more he is sure of God's forgiveness. Let us 

remember that there are sins which, once done, leave their traces on memory and conscience, 

painting indelible forms on the walls of our "chambers of imagery," and transmitting results which 

remission and sanctifying do not, on earth at least, wholly obliterate. Let David's youthful prayer be 

ours, "Keep back Thy servant from presumptuous sins: then shall I be upright, and I shall be 

innocent from much transgression."  It does not fall within the scope of this volume to deal with the 

suppression of Absalom's revolt, nor with the ten years of rule that remained to David after his 

restoration. The psalter does not appear to contain psalms which throw light upon the somewhat 

clouded closing years of his reign. One psalm, indeed, there is attributed to him, which is, at any 

rate, the work of an old man--a sweet song into which mellow wisdom has condensed its final 

lessons--and a snatch of it may stand instead of any summing-up of the life by us:    "Trust in the 

Lord, and do good;    Dwell in the land, and enjoy security;    Delight thyself also in the Lord,    And 

He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.    Commit thy way unto the Lord.     Rest in the Lord 

and wait patiently for Him.     I have been young and now am old,    Yet have I not seen the 

righteous forsaken.     I have seen the wicked in great power,    And spreading himself like a green 

tree....    Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not."  May we not apply the next words to the 

psalmist himself, and hear him calling us to look on him as he lies on his dying bed--disturbed 

though it were by ignoble intrigues of hungry heirs--after so many storms nearing the port; after so 

many vicissitudes, close to the unchanging home; after so many struggles, resting quietly on the 

breast of God: "Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace?" 

Into this opal calmness, as of the liquid light of sunset, all the flaming splendours of the hot day 

have melted. The music of his songs die away into "peace;" as when some master holds our ears 

captive with tones so faint that we scarce can tell sound from silence, until the jar of common 

noises, which that low sweetness had deadened, rushes in.  One strain of a higher mood is 

preserved for us in the historical books that prophesy of the true King, whom his own failures and 

sins, no less than his consecration and victories, had taught him to expect. The dying eyes see on 

the horizon of the far-off future the form of Him who is to be a just and perfect ruler; before the 

brightness of whose presence, and the refreshing of whose influence, verdure and beauty shall 

clothe the world. As the shades gather, that radiant glory to come brightens. He departs in peace, 

having seen the salvation from afar. It was fitting  "So you were, Polly, but I asked leave to keep 

you here for the day, and to take you home in the evening."  "Upon my word!" said Polly.  "You are 

very cool, ain't you?"  However, Polly seemed to think it a good idea, and added, "I suppose I must 

give you a kiss, though you _are_ cool."  The kiss given and taken, they sat down to breakfast in a 

highly conversational tone.  "Of course, you are going to amuse me?" said Polly.  "Oh, of course," 



said Barbox Brothers.  In the pleasurable height of her anticipations, Polly found it indispensable to 

put down her piece of toast, cross one of her little fat knees over the other, and bring her little fat 

right hand down into her left hand with a business-like slap.  After this gathering of herself 

together, Polly, by that time, a mere heap of dimples, asked in a wheedling manner: "What are we 

going to do, you dear old thing?"  "Why, I was thinking," said Barbox Brothers, "--but are you fond 

of horses, Polly?"  "Ponies, I am," said Polly, "especially when their tails are long.  But horses--n--

no--too big, you know."  "Well," pursued Barbox Brothers, in a spirit of grave mysterious 

confidence adapted to the importance of the consultation, "I did see yesterday, Polly, on the walls, 

pictures of two long-tailed ponies, speckled all over--"  "No, no, NO!" cried Polly, in an ecstatic 

desire to linger on the charming details.  "Not speckled all over!"  "Speckled all over.  Which 

ponies jump through hoops--"  "No, no, NO!" cried Polly, as before.  "They never jump through 

hoops!"  "Yes, they do.  O I assure you, they do.  And eat pie in pinafores--"  "Ponies eating pie in 

pinafores!" said Polly.  "What a story-teller you are, ain't you?"  "Upon my honour.--And fire off 

guns."  (Polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting to fire-arms.)  "And I was 

thinking," pursued the exemplary Barbox, "that if you and I were to go to the Circus where these 

ponies are, it would do our constitutions good."  "Does that mean, amuse us?" inquired Polly. 

"What long words you do use, don't you?"  Apologetic for having wandered out of his depth, he 

replied: "That means, amuse us.  That is exactly what it means.  There are many other wonders 

besides the ponies, and we shall see them all.  Ladies and gentlemen in spangled dresses, and 

elephants and lions and tigers."  Polly became observant of the teapot, with a curled-up nose 

indicating some uneasiness of mind.  "They never get out, of course," she remarked as a mere 

truism.  "The elephants and lions and tigers?  O dear no!"  "O dear no!" said Polly.  "And of course 

nobody's afraid of the ponies shooting anybody."  "Not the least in the world."  "No, no, not the 

least in the world," said Polly.  "I was also thinking," proceeded Barbox, "that if we were to look in 

at the toy-shop, to choose a doll--"  "Not dressed!" cried Polly, with a clap of her hands.  "No, no, 

NO, not dressed!"  "Full dressed.  Together with a house, and all things necessary for 

housekeeping--"  Polly gave a little scream, and seemed in danger of falling into a swoon of bliss. 

"What a darling you are!" she languidly exclaimed, leaning back in her chair.  "Come and be 

hugged, or I must come and hug you!"  This resplendent programme was carried into execution 

with the utmost rigour of the law.  It being essential to make the purchase of the doll its first 

feature--or that lady would have lost the ponies--the toy-shop expedition took precedence.  Polly in 

the magic warehouse, with a doll as large as herself under each arm, and a neat assortment of 

some twenty more on view upon the counter, did indeed present a spectacle of indecision 


_
that this fullest of his prophecies should be the last of his strains, as if the rapture which thrilled the 

trembling strings had snapped them in twain.  And then, for earth, the richest voice which God 

ever tuned for His praise was hushed, and the harp of Jesse's son hangs untouched above his 

grave. But for him death was God's last, best answer to his prayer, "O Lord, open Thou my lips;" 

and as that cold but most loving hand unclothes him from the weakness of flesh, and leads him in 

among the choirs of heaven, we can almost hear again his former thanksgiving breaking from his 

immortal lips, "Thou hast put a new song into my mouth," whose melodies, unsaddened by 

plaintive minors of penitence and pain, are yet nobler and sweeter than the psalms which he sang 

here, and left to be the solace and treasure of all generations!     INDEX.   PSALM

work of a brilliant and effective teacher. He writes with       real power and insight."--_Saturday 

Review._        "Dr. Maclaren has evidently mastered his subject with the aid of       the best 

authorities, and has put the results of his studies       cloud passed.  The lovely specimen oftenest 

chosen, oftenest rejected, and finally abided by, was of Circassian descent, possessing as much 

boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme feebleness of mouth, and combining a sky-

blue silk pelisse with rose-coloured satin trousers, and a black velvet hat: which this fair stranger 

to our northern shores would seem to have founded on the portraits of the late Duchess of Kent. 

The name this distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the glowing skies of a sunny 

clime was (on Polly's authority) Miss Melluka, and the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper, 

from the Barbox coffers, may be inferred from the two facts that her silver teaspoons were as large 

as her kitchen poker, and that the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her frying-pan. 

Miss Melluka was graciously pleased to express her entire approbation of the Circus, and so was 

Polly; for the ponies _were_ speckled, and brought down nobody when they fired, and the 



savagery of the wild beasts appeared to be mere smoke--which article, in fact, they did produce in 

large quantities from their insides.  The Barbox absorption in the general subject throughout the 

realisation of these delights was again a sight to see, nor was it less worthy to behold at dinner, 

when he drank to Miss Melluka, tied stiff in a chair opposite to Polly (the fair Circassian possessing 

an unbendable spine), and even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due decorum the 

prevailing glorious idea.  To wind up, there came the agreeable fever of getting Miss Melluka and 

all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with Polly, to be taken home.  But by that time 

Polly had become unable to look upon such accumulated joys with waking eyes, and had 

withdrawn her consciousness into the wonderful Paradise of a child's sleep. "Sleep, Polly, sleep," 

said Barbox Brothers, as her head dropped on his shoulder; "you shall not fall out of this bed, 

easily, at any rate!"  What rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket, and carefully folded into 

the bosom of Polly's frock, shall not be mentioned.  He said nothing about it, and nothing shall be 

said about it.  They drove to a modest suburb of the great ingenious town, and stopped at the 

forecourt of a small house.  "Do not wake the child," said Barbox Brothers, softly, to the driver, "I 

will carry her in as she is."  Greeting the light at the opened door which was held by Polly's mother, 

Polly's bearer passed on with mother and child into a ground-floor room. There, stretched on a 

sofa, lay a sick man, sorely wasted, who covered his eyes with his emaciated hands.  "Tresham," 

said Barbox, in a kindly voice, "I have brought you back your Polly, fast asleep.  Give me your 

hand, and tell me you are better."  The sick man reached forth his right hand, and bowed his head 

over the hand into which it was taken and kissed it.  "Thank you, thank you!  I may say that I am 

well and happy."  "That's brave," said Barbox.  "Tresham, I have a fancy--can you make room for 

me beside you here?"  He sat down on the sofa as he said words, cherishing the plump peachy 

cheek that lay uppermost on his shoulder.  "I have a fancy, Tresham (I am getting quite an old 

fellow now, you know, and old fellows may take fancies into their heads sometimes), to give up 

Polly, having found her, to no one but you.  Will you take her from me?"  As the father held out his 

arms for the child, each of the two men looked steadily at the other.  "She is very dear to you, 

Tresham?"  "Unutterably dear."  "God bless her!  It is not much, Polly," he continued, turning his 

eyes upon her peaceful face as he apostrophised her, "it is not much, Polly, for a blind and sinful 

man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than himself as a little child is; but it would be 

much--much upon his cruel head, and much upon his guilty soul--if he could be so wicked as to 

invoke a curse.  He had better have a millstone round his neck, and be cast into the deepest sea. 

Live and thrive, my pretty baby!"  Here he kissed her.  "Live and prosper, and

this commentary really helps to the better understanding of the       Psalms, that, far from 

degrading, it vivifies and illuminates       these sublime stories, and that it is written in a charming

praise which is its due."--_Scotsman._        "It is scholarly, honest, thoughtful, and suggestive."--

does       here--largely because it is he who does it. The book is most       heartily to be 

commended. Preachers will find it to be a mine of       wealth, and to Christians of all kinds it may 

serve as a manual of       devotion."--_Christian World._        "Dr. Maclaren's charming pages 

furnish a most fruitful field of       study, alike for those whose chief aim is personal edification, 

and for those who are in quest of suggestions in the line of       ministerial service. Altogether a 

most valuable book."--_United       Presbyterian Magazine._        "Most heartily do we welcome 

this new volume of Dr. Maclaren's       'Exposition of the Psalms.' It fully sustains the traditions of 

insight, scholarly instinct, and spiritual force which gather       around that beloved name. 

Notwithstanding the rich treasures of       devout literature which the Psalter has called forth, there 

is a       special niche for this book, and it makes a distinct advance in       tone and method upon 

all other commentaries on the Psalms. We       greatly err if this does not prove the most popular 

and useful       commentary in the English language, both among preachers and the

gave her up gently to both her parents, and went out.  But he went not to Wales.  No, he never 

went to Wales.  He went straightway for another stroll about the town, and he looked in upon the 

people at their work, and at their play, here, there, everywhere, and where not.  For he was 

Barbox Brothers and Co. now, and had taken thousands of partners into the solitary firm.  He had 

at length got back to his hotel room, and was standing before his fire refreshing himself with a 

glass of hot drink which he had stood upon the chimney-piece, when he heard the town clocks 

striking, and, referring to his watch, found the evening to have so slipped away, that they were 



striking twelve.  As he put up his watch again, his eyes met those of his reflection in the chimney-

glass.  "Why it's your birthday already," he said, smiling.  "You are looking very well.  I wish you 

many happy returns of the day."  He had never before bestowed that wish upon himself.  "By 

Jupiter!" he discovered, "it alters the whole case of running away from one's birthday!  It's a thing 

to explain to Phoebe.  Besides, here is quite a long story to tell her, that has sprung out of the road 

with no story. I'll go back, instead of going on.  I'll go back by my friend Lamps's Up X presently." 

He went back to Mugby Junction, and in point of fact he established himself at Mugby Junction.  It 

was the convenient place to live in, for brightening Phoebe's life.  It was the convenient place to 

live in, for having her taught music by Beatrice.  It was the convenient place to live in, for 

occasionally borrowing Polly.  It was the convenient place to live in, for being joined at will to all 

sorts of agreeable places and persons.  So, he became settled there, and, his house standing in 

an elevated situation, it is noteworthy of him in conclusion, as Polly herself might (not irreverently) 

have put it:      There was an Old Barbox who lived on a hill,     And if he ain't gone, he lives there 

still.  HERE FOLLOWS THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT WAS SEEN, HEARD, OR OTHERWISE

Special rules, instance--my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so--him as belongs to 

Smith's bookstall.  Why he no more dares to be up to our Refreshmenting games, than he dares to 

jump atop of a locomotive with her steam at full pressure, and cut away upon her alone, driving 

himself, at limited-mail speed.  Papers, he'd get his head punched at every compartment, first, 

second and third, the whole length of a train, if he was to ventur to imitate my demeanour.  It's the 

same with the porters, the same with the guards, the same with the ticket clerks, the same the 

whole way up to the secretary, traffic manager, or very chairman.  There ain't a one among 'em on 

the nobly independent footing we are.  Did you ever catch one of _them_, when you wanted 

anything of him, making a system of surveying the Line through a transparent medium composed 

of your head and body?  I should hope not.  You should see our Bandolining Room at Mugby 

Junction.  It's led to, by the door behind the counter which you'll notice usually stands ajar, and it's 

the room where Our Missis and our young ladies Bandolines their hair.  You should see 'em at it, 

betwixt trains, Bandolining away, as if they was anointing themselves for the combat.  When 

you're telegraphed, you should see their noses all a going up with scorn, as if it was a part of the 

working of the same Cooke and Wheatstone electrical machinery. You should hear Our Missis 

give the word "Here comes the Beast to be Fed!" and then you should see 'em indignantly 

skipping across the Line, from the Up to the Down, or Wicer Warsaw, and begin to pitch the stale 

pastry into the plates, and chuck the sawdust sangwiches under the glass covers, and get out the-

-ha ha ha!--the Sherry--O my eye, my eye!--for your Refreshment.  It's only in the Isle of the Brave 

and Land of the Free (by which

Refreshmenting is so effective, so 'olesome, so constitutional, a check upon the public.  There was 

a foreigner, which having politely, with his hat off, beseeched our young ladies and Our Missis for 

"a leetel gloss hoff prarndee," and having had the Line surveyed through him by all and no other 

acknowledgment, was a proceeding at last to help himself, as seems to be the custom in his own
