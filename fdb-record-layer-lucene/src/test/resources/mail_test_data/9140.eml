nobles, or even the king or others to visit her. The better to colour his w=

queen to understand that this project must be kept secret, and executed wit=
h much caution, lest=20

she and her family should be stopped on the road to Luxembourg. He advised =
her to undertake a=20

pilgrimage with her children to St Fiacre, and thence to our Lady at Liesse=
, whence he would=20

escort her to Luxembourg, and give her such an establishment as should be s=
uitable for her and=20

her children=E2=80=99s rank, until the present dispositions of the king sho=
uld be changed.  =E2=80=98He frequently=20

pressed the queen on this subject, using nearly the words I have related, a=
ll tending to put the=20

queen and her children in his power to do with them as he pleased. They cer=
tainly were in great=20

danger,=E2=80=94and it would have increased, if some worthy persons, real f=
riends to the queen, had not=20

informed her, that all she had heard was false, which made her alter her in=
tentions the moment=20

she discovered the wicked and damnable designs of the duke or Orleans. She =
determined, in=20

consequence, not to undertake this journey.=E2=80=94Thus concludes the seco=
nd article of my minor,=20

which plainly proves the late duke of Orleans guilty of high treason agains=
t the person of the=20

queen of France.  =E2=80=98I shall now show, that the duke of Orleans has b=
een guilty of high treason in the=20

third degree, by three different crimes: the first, by poisons and intoxica=
tions; the second, by=20

fallacious deceptions; the third, by his false representations to the pope.=
  =E2=80=98In regard to my first=20

charge, I declare the late duke of Orleans guilty of intending the death of=
 the late dauphin by=20

means of a poisoned apple which was given to a child, with orders to offer =
it to my lord the late=20

dauphin, and to none other, which was done. It chanced as he was carrying t=
his apple, he passed=20

through the gardens of the h=C3=B4tel de St Pol, where he met the nurse to =
the children of the duke of=20

Orleans, carrying one  INTERNAL HEMORRHAGE may be fatal from mechanical int=
erference with=20

the function of an organ, as well as from syncope. Thus we may have death f=
rom syncope due to=20

hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity or, after contusions, into the interc=
ellular spaces and the=20

cavity due to the blow, into which several pounds of blood may be extravasa=
ted. Internal=20

hemorrhage is most fatal when due to the rupture of a viscus such as the he=
art, lungs, liver,=20

kidney. Taylor[627] cites a case of a man run over and brought to Guy=E2=80=
=99s Hospital in November,=20

1864. He had pain in the back, but there were no symptoms or marks of sever=
e injury. He left the=20

hospital and walked home, where he was found dead in bed a few hours later.=
 His abdomen=20

contained a large amount of blood from the rupture of a kidney. After sever=
e flagellation blood may=20

be effused in large quantity beneath the skin and between the muscles, whic=
h is just as fatal as if it=20

had flowed externally from a wound. In fact, if the injuries are numerous t=
he loss of much less=20

blood is enough to prove fatal, the element of shock here assisting that of=
 hemorrhage.  _How are=20

we to ascertain whether a person has died from hemorrhage?_ This may be mor=
e difficult in the=20

case of an open wound, for the body may have been moved from the spot where=
 it lay after the=20

wound was received, and the blood on the body, clothes, and surrounding obj=
ects may have been=20

removed. Then the case may be presumptive only, but we may arrive at a defi=
nite conclusion by=20

attention to the following points: If the wound was in a very vascular part=
 and of some size, or if a=20

large vessel or many moderately large vessels were divided and the vessels,=
 especially the veins=20

in the neighborhood, are empty, then we may be quite sure of death from hem=
orrhage. If there is=20

no disease found which could be rapidly fatal the case is still stronger. T=
he body should be pallid=20

after fatal hemorrhage, but the same may be the case from=20


_
bade the child give it to her, that she might present it to the infant she =
was carrying,=E2=80=94but he said=20

he would not give it to any one but my lord the dauphin. Seeing the boy so =
obstinate, the nurse=20

took the apple from him by force and gave it her child to eat, who soon aft=
er fell sick and died.  =E2=80=98I=20

here ask one question. This innocent died of the poisoned apple: ought the =
boy who brought it, or=20

the nurse who gave it the child, be punished? I reply, No, neither of them;=
 but the crime must be=20

attributed to those who poisoned it, or caused it to be carried.  =E2=80=98=
In regard to my second charge, of=20

fallacious deceptions, I have already touched upon them, in his treacherous=
 conduct and advice to=20

the queen, to quit the kingdom for have not been disturbed, then the amount=
 of clotted blood in the=20

wound, on the body and clothes, and about the body, taken in connection wit=
h the foregoing=20

points, can leave no doubt. We should remember, however, that not all the b=
lood about the body=20

was necessarily effused during life, but a little hemorrhage may have occur=
red after death while=20

the body was still warm and the blood fluid, _i.e._, during the first four,=
 eight, or ten hours. But the=20

amount thus lost is small. In cases of death from internal hemorrhage we do=
 not have so much=20

difficulty in pronouncing an opinion, as by post-mortem examination we can =
determine the amount=20

of the hemorrhage. We can judge, too, from its position, whether it has act=
ed=20


_
=E2=80=98As to my third charge, it is well known, that the duke of Orleans,=
 persevering in his wicked=20

designs, has personally, and by ambassadors, often practised with the pope =
to deprive the king of=20

his crown and kingdom. To succeed in this damnable conspiracy, he falsely a=
nd wickedly charged=20

the king with crimes affecting his royal progeny, which he gave the pope to=
 understand were such=20

as required him to declare and has thus caused death, or whether the latter=
 was due to syncope=20

from the quantity lost.  =3D2. Severe mechanical injury of a vital organ=3D=
, such as crushing of the=20

heart, lungs, brain, etc. This crushing may be accompanied by hemorrhage, b=
ut death may be=20

more immediate than the hemorrhage would account for. The mechanical injury=
 done to the vital=20

centres in the medulla by the act of pithing is the direct=20


_
his posterity unworthy to hold or succeed to the crown of France. He also r=
equested the pope to=20

grant absolution to all who should act contrary to the oath of fidelity the=
y had been constrained to=20

take to the king, and to declare the next of his blood the successor to the=
 crown and government=20

of France.  =E2=80=98The better to secure the pope in his interests, he has=
 always favoured and supported=20

which follows it. Exceptionally slight violence to a vital organ is fatal, =
but this may be better=20

explained by attributing it to shock.  =3D3. Shock.=3D=E2=80=94An injury is=
 often apparently not enough to=20

account for the fatal result so speedily. The marks of external injury may =
fail entirely or be very=20

trifling. Thus more than once persons have died in railway collisions with =
no external marks of=20
