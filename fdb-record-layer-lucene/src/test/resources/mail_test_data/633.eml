inundations are caused by the sudden rush of waters from the torrents of Abyssinia in July, 

August, and September; and that the soil washed down by the floods of the Atbara is at the 

present moment silting up the mouths of the Nile, and thus slowly, but steadily, forming a delta 

beneath the waters of the Mediterranean, on the same principle that created the fertile Delta of 

Egypt. Both the water and the mud of the Nile have duties to perform,--the water to irrigate; the 

deposit to fertilize; but these duties are not regularly Crashington, having put little Fred to sleep, 

was roused from a reverie by the sound of several footsteps outside, followed by a loud ring at the 

bell; she opened the door quickly, and her husband was borne in and laid on his bed.  "Not dead?" 

exclaimed the woman in a voice of agony.  "No, missus, not dead," said David Clazie, "but hardly 

better, I fear."  When Maggie looked on the poor bruised form, with garments torn to shreds, and 

so covered with charcoal, water, lime, and blood, as to be almost an indistinguishable mass, she

sometimes the rush of the inundation is overwhelming, at others it is insufficient; while at all times 

an immense proportion of the fertilizing mud is not only wasted by a deposit beneath the sea, but 

navigation is impeded by the silt. The Nile is a powerful horse without harness, but, with a bridle in 

its mouth, the fertility of Egypt might be increased to a vast extent.  As the supply of water raised 

by the sageer is received in a reservoir, from which the irrigating channels radiate through the 

plantations, so should great reservoirs be formed throughout the varying levels of Egypt, from 

Khartoum to the Mediterranean, comprising a that he was alive, had not a slight heaving of the 

broad chest told that life still remained.  "It's a 'orrible sight, that, missus," said David Clazie, with a 

look that seemed strangely stern.  "It is--oh it is--terrible!" said Mrs Crashington, scarce able to 

suppress a cry.  "Ah, you'd better take a good look at it," added Clazie, "for it's your own doing, 

missus."  Maggie looked at him in surprise, but he merely advised her to lend a hand to take the 

clothes off, as the doctor would be round in a minute; so she silently but actively busied herself in 

such duties as were necessary.  Meanwhile Phil Sparks went about the streets of

of fifteen hundred feet. The advantage of this great difference in altitude between the Nile in 

latitude 15 degrees 30 minutes and the sea, would enable any amount of irrigation, by the 

establishment of a series of dams or weirs across the Nile, that would raise its level to the required 

degree, at certain points, from which the water would be led by canals into natural depressions; 

these would form reservoirs, from which the water might be led upon a vast scale, in a similar 

manner to the insignificant mud basins that duties of his own particular business.  To judge from 

appearances, it seemed to be rather an easy occupation, for it consisted mainly in walking at a 

leisurely pace through the streets and thoroughfares, with his hands in his pockets and a pipe in 

his mouth.  Meditation also appeared to be an important branch of this business, for Phil frequently 

paused in front of a large mansion, or a magnificent shop, and gazed at it so intently, that one 

might have almost fancied he was planning the best method of attempting a
