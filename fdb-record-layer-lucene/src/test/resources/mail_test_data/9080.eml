      CHAPTER 19                               "I Promise"   Knowing that M=
rs. Jones and the Cubs might not be able to hold the tramp a prisoner very =
long in the barricaded basement, Dan ran as fast as he could to myself. All=
 the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, the old priest and me=
, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers on horse. All those o=

                           CHAPTER 19                               "I Prom=
ise"   Knowing that Mrs. Jones and the Cubs might not be able to hold the t=
ramp a prisoner very long in the barricaded basement, Dan ran as fast as he=
 could to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, =
the old priest and me, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers =
on horse. All those officers, when they see what I carry under the cloth, p=
ull up their horses and kneel down on the _
shoulder."  He pounded on the door with his fist. The Cubs waited uneasily.=
 The tramp had turned=20

into the lane and was running faster now.  "Wait, boys!" he shouted. "I got=
 something to tell you!"=20

"He probably wants to give us a stick of candy!" Dan muttered. "Oh, why doe=
sn't Mrs. Jones open=20

the door--"  Just then, the widow did answer the knock.  "Let us in and we'=
ll explain later," Dan=20

said breathlessly. "That tramp is after us!"  Without asking questions, Mrs=
. Jones hustled Anton=20

Jelinek. He was a strapping young fellow in the early twenties then, handso=
me, warm-hearted, and=20

full of life, and he came to us like a miracle in the midst of that grim bu=
siness. I remember exactly=20

how he strode into our kitchen in his felt boots and long wolfskin coat, hi=
s eyes and cheeks bright=20

with the cold. At sight of grandmother, he snatched off his fur cap, greeti=
ng her in a deep, rolling=20

voice which seemed older than he.  "I want to thank you very much, Mrs.=20


_
"Better lock the door," Brad advised, setting the money box on the kitchen =
table. "That bird may try=20

to break in."  "Let him!" said Mrs. Jones. Nevertheless, she locked the kit=
chen door as the boy had=20

advised.  The Cubs barely had time to explain where they had obtained the m=
oney, than the man=20

was pounding to be let in.  "Don't do it," Brad advised the widow. "He's a =
tough customer. Better=20

let the police handle him."  Chips and Midge had gone to the window to look=
 out.  "Come back,=20

boys," Mrs. Jones ordered. "If that tramp is a criminal, he might take a sh=
ot through the glass."=20

Alarmed, the two boys moved back out of range.  Outside, a door slammed as =
if in the wind. Mrs.=20

Jones, hearing the sound, stiffened.  Then, unmindful of her own warning to=
 the Cubs, she ran to=20

the window.  "Why, that sneak!" she exclaimed. "He's opened the poor strang=
ers from my kawn-

tree."  He did not hesitate like a farmer boy, but looked one eagerly in th=
e eye when he spoke.=20

Everything about him was warm and spontaneous. He said he would have come t=
o see the=20

Shimerdas before, but he had hired out to husk corn all the fall, and since=
 winter began he had=20

been going to the school by the mill, to learn English, along with the litt=
le children. He told me he=20

had a nice "lady-teacher" and that he liked to go to school.  At dinner gra=
ndfather talked to Jelinek=20

more than he usually did to strangers.  "Will they be much disappointed bec=
ause we cannot get a=20

priest?" he asked.  Jelinek looked serious. "Yes, sir, that is very bad for=
 them. Their father has=20

done a great sin," he looked straight at grandfather. "Our Lord has said th=
at."  Grandfather=20

seemed to like his frankness. "We believe that,=20


_
down into the basement!"  "Then he'll be up here in another minute!" Babe q=
uavered. "He'll get=20

us!"  "Oh, no, he won't," said Mrs. Jones confidently.  Moving across the k=
itchen, she locked the=20

inside door which led into the basement. As a double precaution, she then p=
laced the heavy oak=20

table in front of the door.  "That should hold him," she announced. "I have=
 another little idea too!"=20

The Cubs could not guess what the widow was up to as she darted out of the =
house, not even=20

bothering to put on a wrap.  In a moment though, they understood. Mrs. Jone=
s slammed shut the=20

double doors entering into the cellar, and bolted them.  As Dan and Brad ra=
n out to help, she told=20

them to bring several pieces of heavy machinery from the shed. These the bo=
ys trundled out and=20

placed on top of the double doors.  "That should hold But we believe that M=
r. Shimerda's soul will=20

come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is=
 our only intercessor."  The=20

young man shook his head. "I know how you think. My teacher at the school h=
as explain. But I=20

have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.=
"  We asked him what=20

he meant.  He glanced around the table. "You want I shall tell you? When I =
was a little boy like this=20

one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I make my first communion ver=
y young; what the Church=20

teach seem plain to me. By 'n' by war-times come, when the Austrians fight =
us. We have very=20

many soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that ca=
mp, and the men die=20

like flies. All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to=
 dying men, and I go=20


_
work.  From inside the house, they could hear the tramp pounding on the doo=
r.  "He may break it=20

down!" Dan said uneasily.  "He could," the widow admitted. "Dan, run down t=
he road and see if=20

you can find out what's keeping Mr. Hatfield and the state troopers. the Ho=
ly Sacrament.=20

Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. =
But we have no=20

sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Chr=
ist, and it preserve=20

us." He paused, looking at grandfather. "That I know,=20
