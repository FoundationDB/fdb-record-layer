rare in the two last books of the Psalter (Delitzsch, ii. 393). In some cas=
es they are obviously=20

erroneous, but in the greater number there is nothing inconsistent with the=
ir correctness in the=20

psalms to which they are appended; while very frequently they throw a flood=
 of light upon these,=20

and all but prove their trustworthiness by their appropriateness. They are =
not authoritative, but=20

they merit respectful consideration, and, as Dr. Perowne puts it in his val=
uable work on the=20

Psalms, stand on a par with the subscriptions to the Epistles in the New Te=
stament. Regarding=20

them thus, and yet examining the psalms to which they are prefixed, there s=
eem to be about forty-

five which we may attribute with some confidence to David, and with these w=
e shall be concerned=20

in this book.     II.--EARLY DAYS   The life of David is naturally divided =
into epochs, of which we=20

may avail ourselves for the more ready arrangement of our material. These a=
re--his early years up=20

to his escape from the court of Saul, his exile, the prosperous beginning o=
f his reign, his sin and=20

penitence, his flight before Absalom's rebellion, and the darkened end.  We=
 have but faint=20

incidental traces of his life up to his anointing by Samuel, with which the=
 narrative in the historical=20

books opens. But perhaps the fact that the story begins with that consecrat=
ion to office, is of more=20

value than the missing biography of his childhood could have been. It teach=
es us the point of view=20

from which Scripture regards its greatest names--as nothing, except in so f=
ar as they are God's=20

instruments. Hence its carelessness, notwithstanding that so much of it is =
history, of all that merely=20

illustrates the personal character of its heroes. Hence, too, the clearness=
 with which,=20

notwithstanding that indifference, the living men are set before us--the co=
uld not resist letting a=20

certain tone of pique penetrate this speech, and the puzzled and pained exp=
ression of Lady=20

Ursula's face afforded me a sense of momentary gratification, of which I sp=
eedily repented. As she=20

looked at me earnestly, her large blue eyes filled slowly with tears. "Is s=
he crying because this last=20

speech of mine proves me hopelessly mad?" thought I; "or does she feel hers=
elf in a pecuniary=20

trap, and is she crying because she does not see her way out of it?" and I =
felt the old sensation=20

coming over me, and my head beginning to swim. Why, oh why, am I denied tha=
t method in my=20

madness which it must be such a comfort to possess? It is just at the criti=
cal moment that my=20

osseous matter invariably plays me a trick. I seemed groping for light and =
strength, and=20

mechanically put out my hand; the soft touch of one placed gently in it thr=
illed through my nerves=20

with an indescribable current, and instantaneously the horrid feeling left =
me, and I emerged from=20

the momentary torpor into which I had fallen. I don't think Ursula remarked=
 it, for she said, and her=20

eyes were now overflowing, in a voice of surpassing sweetness, "Lord Frank,=
 I have discovered=20

your _real_ secret; it is no longer possible for you to conceal the noble m=
otives which have=20

actuated you under your pretended----"  "Hush!" I said, interrupting her; "=
what I did, whether rightly=20

or wrongly, I did for the best. Now I will be guided by your wishes. What a=
m I to do?"  "Allow no=20

worldly consideration, however unselfish, either for myself or those deares=
t to me, to induce you to=20

swerve from the course which truth and honour distinctly point out. Whateve=
r may seem to be the=20

consequences, we are both bound to follow this, and we have but to feel tha=
t, if need be, we are=20

ready to make great sacrifices to receive the requisite=20


_
a dozen strokes of the chisel.  We do not know the age of David when Samuel=
 appeared in the=20

little village with the horn of sacred oil in his hand. The only approximat=
ion to it is furnished by the=20

fact, that he was thirty at the beginning of his reign. (2 Sam. v. 4.) If w=
e take into account that his=20

exile must have lasted for a very considerable period (one portion of it, h=
is second flight to the=20

Philistines, was sixteen months, 1 Sam. xxvii. 7),--that the previous resid=
ence at the court of Saul=20

must have been long enough to give time for his gradual rise to popularity,=
 and thereafter for the=20

gradual development of the king's insane hatred,--that further back tremble=
d slightly, "whatever=20

happens, I shall feel that you have given me proofs of a friendship upon wh=
ich I may depend."  I=20

pressed the hand I still held, and I felt the touch was sacred. "Ah," thoug=
ht I, as I left the room, and=20

was conscious that the gentle influence of her I had parted from was still =
resting upon me, "that is=20

the right kind of spirit-medium. There is a magnetism in that slender finge=
r which supports and=20

purifies." O my hardened and material readers! don't suppose that because I=
 know you will laugh=20

at the idea of a purifying or invigorating magnetism I shall hesitate to wr=
ite exactly what I feel on=20

such matters. If I refrain from saying a=20
