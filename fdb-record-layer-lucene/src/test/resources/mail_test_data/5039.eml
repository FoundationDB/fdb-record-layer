Just as the South Carolinian began speaking, a shadow darkened the doorway of the Senate 

chamber, and Daniel Webster stepped casually inside. The Massachusetts member was at the 

time absorbed in the preparation of certain cases that were coming up before the Supreme Court, 

and he had given little attention either to Foote's resolution or to the debate upon it. What he now 

heard, however, quickly drove Carver's Lessee vs. John Jacob Astor quite out of his mind. 

Aspersions were being cast upon his beloved New England; the Constitution was under attack; the 

Union itself was being called in question. Webster's decision was instantaneous: Hayne must be 

answered--and answered while his arguments were still hot.  "Seeing the true grounds of the 

Constitution thus attacked," the New equivocal. She certainly had everything to gain for her own 

offspring by the death of Isabelle's children; but there is no proof that she even harbored evil 

designs, and the whole course of her rather quiet and obscure life gives the lie to the evil 

insinuations. She was gentle, pious according to the habit of the day, and had received a careful 

education which left her not without some appreciation of arts and letters, for we find her the 

patroness of a poet from her native Brabant, Adenet le Roi, called "king of minstrels." The real 

facts in the case, however, we can never know; and Marie hardly appears again in history, though 

she lived on in apparent wealth and fair renown until 1321, when her death occurred.  Before 

Marie de Brabant died many other queens had come and gone 


_
The debate was now fairly started, and the word quickly went round that a battle of the giants was 

impending. Each foeman was worthy of the other's steel. Hayne was representative of all that was 

proudest and best in the South Carolina of his day. "Nature had lavished on him," says Benton, 

"all the gifts which lead to eminence in public, and to happiness in private, life." He was tall, Paris, 

during the reigns of Philippe le Bel and his sons, Louis le Hutin, and Philippe le Long. But not one 

of these is of sufficient fame or notoriety to merit extended comment; instead, we may centre our 

attention upon a typical _grande dame_ of the period, a woman who was a direct vassal of the 

crown and who played no small role in the affairs of her own domain, this is the Countess Mahaut 

d'Artois. 


_
Webster was an equally fitting representative of rugged New England. Born nine years earlier than 

Hayne, he struggled up from a boyhood of physical frailty and poverty to an honored place at the 

Boston bar, and in 1812, at the age of thirty, was elected to Congress. To the Senate he brought, 

in 1827,  Mahaut, or Matilda, was one of the high nobility, illustrious in her birth and in her 

relationship to persons of some note in history, being great-niece of Saint Louis, cousin of Philippe 

le Bel, grandmother of a Duke of Burgundy and of a Count of Flanders, and, greater still, mother of 

two unhappy Queens of

When, therefore, on the 21st of January, Hayne rose to deliver his First Reply, and Webster five 

days later took the floor to begin his Second Reply--probably the greatest effort in the history of 

American legislative oratory--the little chamber then used by the Senate, but nowadays given over 

to the Supreme Court, presented a spectacle fairly to be described as IV. She lived an active and 

a useful life, and is a character not unpleasant to consider. From the days of her impetuous 

grandfather, Robert d'Artois, brother of Saint Louis, her family had been fond of the battlefield, on 

which many of them had died. Robert, first Count of Artois, was killed at Mansourah; Mahaut's 

father, Robert II., had fallen in the great

During the later stages of the discussion people of prominence from adjoining States filled the 

hotels of the city and bombarded the senators with requests for tickets of admission to the senate 

galleries. Lines were formed, and when the doors were thrown open in the morning every 

available inch of space was instantly filled with and her brother, Philippe, had fallen in another 

battle with the sturdy burghers of Flanders, in 1298. The death of this brother left Mahaut the 

heiress of Artois, and she succeeded to her heritage when, as we noted above, her father was 

slain at Courtrai, in 1302.  At that time Mahaut was already a matron and a great lady in the land;
