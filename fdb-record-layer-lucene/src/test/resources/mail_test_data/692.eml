silence until after the service, when they could 'tell it to the deacon', a colored man who would 

listen to the confessions or professions of religion of the slaves until late into the night. The Negro 

deacon would relay his converts to the white minister of the church, who would meet them in the 

vestry room at some specified time.  Some of the questions that would be asked at these meetings 

in the vestry room would be:  "What did you come up here for?"  "Because I got religion".  "How do 

you know you got religion?"  "Because I know my sins are forgive".  "How do you know your sins 

are forgiven?"  "Because I love Jesus and I love everybody".  "Do you want to be baptized?"  "Yes 

sir."  "Why do you want to be baptized?"  "Cause it will make me like Jesus wants me to be". 

When several persons were 'ready', there would be a baptism in a nearby creek or river. After this, 

slaves would be permitted to hold occasional servives of their own in the log house that was 

sometimes used as a school.  Mrs. Scott remembers vividly the joy that she felt and other slaves 

expressed when first news of their emancipation was brought to them. Both she and her mistress 

were fearful, she says; her mistress because she did are those bloody vagrant laws, in which 

whipping, branding, hanging are ordained as the punishment of vagrancy by lawgivers, many of 

whom were themselves among the idlest and most noxious vagabonds in the country, and the 

authors of senseless wars which generated a mass of vagrancy, by filling the country with 

disbanded soldiers. In the reign of Richard II., the poll tax being added to other elements of class 

discord, labour strikes, takes arms under Wat Tyler, demands fixed rents, tenant right in an 

extreme form, and the total abolition of serfage. A wild religious communism bred of the 

preachings of the more visionary among the Wycliffites mingles in the movement with the sense of 

fiscal and industrial wrong. "When Adam delved and Eve span, where was then the gentleman?" 

is the motto of the villeins, and it is one of more formidable import than any utterance of peasant 

orators at Agricultural Labourers' meetings in the present day. Then come fearful scenes of 

confusion, violence and crime. London is in the power of hordes brutalized by oppression. High 

offices of state, high ecclesiastics are murdered. Special vengeance falls on the lawyers, as the 

artificers who forged the cunning chains of

she thought the Union soldiers would harm Mrs. Dove. When the chief officer of the soldiers came 

to the home of her mistress, she says, he demanded entrance in a gruff voice. Then he saw a ring 

upon Mrs. Dove's finger and asked: "Where did you get this?" When told that the ring belonged to 

her husband, who was dead, the officer turned to his soldiers and told them that they should "get 

back; she's alright!"  Provisions intended for the Confederate armies were broken open by the 

Union soldiers and their followers, and Anna's mother, to protect her master, organized groups of 

slaves to 'tote the meat from the box cars and hide it in dugouts are paralyzed by the aspect of the 

sea of furious savagery raging round them. The boy king, by a miraculous exhibition of 

courageous self- possession, saves the State; but he is compelled to grant general charters of 

manumission, which, when the danger is over, the feudal parliament forces him by a unanimous 

vote to repudiate. Wholesale hanging of serfs, of course, follows the landlords' victory.  The rising 

under Jack Cade, in the reign of Henry VI., was rather political than industrial. The demands of the 

insurgents, political reform and freedom of suffrage, show that progress had been made in the 

condition and aspirations of the labouring

divided between Negroes and whites.  A Provost Judge followed the advance of the army, and he 

obtained a list of all of the slaves held by each master. Mrs. Dove gave her list to the official, who 

called each slave by name and asked what that slave had done on the plantation. He asked, also, 

whether any the Tudors came the final breakup in England of feudalism, as well as of Catholicism, 

attended by disturbances in the world of labour, similar to those which have attended the abolition 

of slavery in the Southern States. This is the special epoch of the sanguinary vagrancy laws, the

made to them since the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed, and when answered in the 

negative told them that 'You are free now and must be paid for all of the work you have done since 

the Proclamation was signed and that you will do in the future. Don't you work for anybody without 

pay'.  The Provost Judge also nobility of courtiers and upstarts, who had shared with the king the 

plunder of the monasteries, were hard landlords of course; they robbed the people of their rights of 

common, and swept away homesteads and cottages, to make room for sheep farms, the wool 

trade being the great source of wealth in those days. By the
