board, but an hour later he came up to the flight deck. When he saw the jet=
 plane he stared,=20

rubbed his eyes, and then looked again.  "Jack! How did you get it? And whe=
re?" he demanded.=20

So, once more Jack told his story.  "It seems almost unbelievable!" said th=
e Commander. "Before I=20

was assigned to the _Black Bee_, I was sent to England to study an English =
plane that was an=20

exact duplicate of this one!"  "But this is an all-American plane, sir," sa=
id Jack. "The maker's name=20

is on each instrument."  "That means we are considering going into producti=
on, or would be," the=20

Commander corrected, "if this plane had been shipped to us for a tryout. Bu=
t now--h'm--what are=20

we to make of it? You say the first men who flew it seemed to be British?" =
 "Yes, sir, and the last=20

two were Nazis. They even had three Japs with them."  "Well, anyway," the C=
ommander said, "we=20

have the plane. What to do about it, that's the question."  "I'd like to fl=
y her in the big push!" Jack=20

leaned forward eagerly. "She's a natural for scouting and bombing. No Zero =
could ever catch her.=20

And in the stratosphere she'd bring you home faster than the wind."  "Tired=
? Had a hard day?" the=20

Commander demanded.  "Practically just rolled out of my berth, sir," Jack g=
rinned.  "Then we'll try=20

her out right now. Night's the time for that. We'll not be spotted."  They =
did try the plane out. Jack=20

went up alone at first with one pale light showing. The Commander, watching=
 and listening on the=20

deck, was sometimes on tiptoe and sometimes doing a jig as Jack put the scr=
eamer through its=20

paces. An ardent enthusiast was the Commander.  "Boy! What a plane!" he exc=
laimed the=20

moment Jack leaped from the cockpit. "What a kite! Have her gassed. I'll go=
 get my flying jacket=20

and we'll go up together!"                                   CHAPTER XXVI  =

produced and other severe ocular affections may result.  _Hearing._=E2=80=
=94Sudden and total deafness=20

may be caused by lightning, as in the case of Cook, where perforation of bo=
th tympana was found.=20

This may prove to be only temporary, as in the case of Nason, where the pat=
ient, though totally=20

deaf at first, is reported as hearing fairly on the fifth day; on the seven=
teenth day, however, the=20

hearing was still dull. The deafness may be permanent. With deafness tinnit=
us is apt to occur.=20

Hyperacustia, or extreme sensitiveness to noise, has also been reported in =
several cases.  _Smell=20

and Taste._=E2=80=94The person affected sometimes has noticed a smell resem=
bling that of sulphur, and=20

this has also been said to have been apparent to others. A metallic taste i=
n the mouth is not rare.=20

=3DGeneral Symptoms.=3D=E2=80=94When first struck by lightning and while st=
ill unconscious, the patient has=20

usually a flushed and reddened face, with dilated pupils. Immediately follo=
wing, or perhaps without=20

this preliminary stage, appear the symptoms of collapse. Cyanosis may occur=
, and the patient may=20

appear to be asphyxiated.  Fever, not caused by injuries, may sometimes occ=
ur, but certainly not=20

to any extreme degree. In many cases the temperature when taken was normal,=
 and even in=20

cases of severe stroke without serious surgical injury the temperature has =
not risen above 101=C2=B0. In=20

these latter cases it is hard to say how far the temperature is affected by=
 the burns which are=20

always present.  The pulse is sometimes slow, sometimes rapid and feeble, o=
r almost=20

imperceptible; at times it is irregular.  The respiration is apt to be labo=
red. In Paige=E2=80=99s case there=20

was marked dyspn=C5=93a. It may be almost imperceptible. It is sometimes sl=

"I've used up all my kerosene, sir!" Jack declared in sudden consternation.=
 "And I'm quite sure this=20

jet plane won't run on gas."  "Oh, don't let that worry you!" was the Comma=
nder's instant reply.=20

"You've been around this old flat-top long enough. You should know that we =
carry a greater variety=20

of goods and supplies than you'd find in a department store. We service the=
 entire task force."=20

"Sure, I know. But kerosene--"  "We carry that for land operations. You can=

PATHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.  A few words must be said in regard to =
the=20

pathological conditions which may be directly produced by lightning and can=
 be detected during=20
