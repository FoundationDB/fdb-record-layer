philodendron monstera explained. Two men upon our side now each held a rope=
, and one of these walked about ten yards before the other. Upon both sides=
 of the river the people now advanced, dragging the rope on the surface of =
the water until they reached the ambatch float that was swimming to and fro=
, according to the movements of the hippopotamus below. By a dexterous jerk=
 of the main line, the float was now placed between the two would exclaim: =
 "Well, if this is not a town, what is?"  "You won't see as many Jews as th=
at in Pelsoec in ten years," answered another proudly.  Old Mrs. Muencz fea=
sted her eyes on her sons when she sat, as she usually did, in the doorway =
of her shop, her knitting in her hands, her spectacles on her nose (those s=
pectacles lent her an additional charm in the eyes of her admirers). She wa=

cles on her nose (those spectacles lent her an additional charm in the eyes=
 of her admirers). She was a pleasant-looking old _
as they purposely sunk out of view; in a few seconds later they reappeared =
at the edge of the rock=20

upon which the young hippo stood. It would be difficult to say which starte=
d first, the astonished=20

young hippo into the water, or the harpoons from the hands of the howartis!=
 It was the affair of a=20

moment; the hunters dived directly they had hurled their harpoons, and, swi=
mming for some=20

distance under water, they came to the surface, and hastened to the shore l=
est an infuriated=20

hippopotamus should follow them. One harpoon had missed; the other had fixe=
d the bull of the=20

herd, at which it had been surely aimed. This was grand sport! The bull was=
 in the greatest=20

comfortable as possible. It is a wonder they did not bring her into the tow=
n in triumph on their=20

shoulders, which would have been no joke, for she weighed at least two hund=
redweight.  Some of=20

the townsfolk were very discontented that the mayor had only brought a Jewe=
ss into the town, and=20

not a Jew, for it would sound grander if they could say: "Our Jew says this=
, or our Moricz or Tobias=20

did that," than if they had said: "Our Rosalia says this, that, or the othe=
r;" it sounds so very mild.=20

They would have liked a Jew with a long beard, and hooked nose, and red hai=
r if possible; that=20

was the correct thing!  But Mr. Konopka, the cleverest senator in the town,=
 who=20


_
blowing in his impotent rage; but as the ambatch float was exceedingly larg=
e, and this naturally=20

accompanied his movements, he tried to escape from his imaginary persecutor=
, and dived=20

constantly, only to find his pertinacious attendant close to him upon regai=
ning the surface. This=20

was not to last long; the howartis were in earnest, contract with Mrs. Muen=
cz, and who had even=20

gone himself to fetch her and her luggage from Besztercebanya with two larg=
e carts, the horses of=20

which had flowers and rosettes on, coldly repudiated these aspersions on th=
eir Jewess, with an=20

argument which struck as heavily as the stones in David's sling.  "Don't be=
 so foolish," he said.=20


_
who, with two of the aggageers, Abou Do and Suleiman, were near at hand; th=
ese men arrived=20

with the long ropes that form a portion of the outfit for hippo hunting.  T=
he whole party now halted=20

on the edge of the river, while two men swam across with one end of the lon=
g rope. Upon gaining=20

the opposite bank, I observed that a second rope was made fast to the middl=
e of the main line;=20

thus upon our side we held the ends of two ropes, while on the opposite sid=
e they had only one;=20

accordingly, the point of junction of the two ropes in the centre formed an=
 acute angle. The why=20

should not a Jewess fill the place of Jew in Babaszek?"  (This was a refere=
nce to the words of the=20

nation addressed to Maria Theresa: "We will fight for our 'king' and our co=
untry.")  Of course they=20

soon saw the truth of this, and ceased grumbling; and they were in time qui=
te reconciled to their=20

Jewess, for every year, on the Feast of Tents, all Mrs. Muencz's sons, seve=
n in number, came to=20

see their mother, and walked about the market-place in their best clothes, =
laced boots, and top-

hats. The townsfolk were glad enough then, their hearts swelled with pride =
