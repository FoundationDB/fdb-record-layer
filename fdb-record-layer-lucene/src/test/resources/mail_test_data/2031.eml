dracaena marginata prison Yvonne had only once seen the interior of the hou=
se and that was when, half fainting, she had been dragged across its thresh=
old and up the stairs. She had therefore only a very vague idea as to where=
 the stairs lay and how she was to get about without stumbling.  "Have you =
spoken to Duncan on the subject?" asked Dan.  "No, I cannot bear to let him=
 imagine even for a moment that I could believe him guilty of murder--that =
I even suspected him of it.  But you say you have heard something, Dan--tha=
