In his light, powerful fighter Ted climbed for the clouds. There weren't many, but those he saw 

were immense. "Once you're inside one of those babies you're as good as lost," he told himself. 

Climbing through one of these he soared away, glorying in the wonderful beauties of the sunrise. 

"The heavens declare the glory of God," he repeated slowly. "And the firmament showeth His 

handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge."  If we could 

read half the things written in the skies we'd be mighty wise, he thought. After that for quite some 

time he sailed on, not thinking much about anything, just storing up energy for what lay ahead. 

And he was to need all the energy and wisdom he possessed.  He had covered the greater part of 

the distance to his destination, had picked out the island on which he believed his friends to be 

marooned, and was heading straight for it when he began to hear a strange, low, screaming noise. 

"Rats!" he exclaimed. "Something's wrong with my motor!"  Shutting off the gas, he glided silently 

downward, but still that strange sound reached his ears.  "Not my motor," he thought, sending his 

ship shooting forward once more. "That's the queerest thing I ever heard."  Puzzled and disturbed 

by this strange phenomenon, he gave his ship a fresh burst of speed and headed straight for his 

island goal.  With every second the peculiar howling sound, which at and course of the current. In 

the less severe cases this gradually passes away, and in many cases the patient, although weak 

and feeling shaken and tired, suffers no further ill effects beyond those of the burns and 

mechanical injuries. Sometimes there follows a general tremor which may last a few hours or for 

days, and occasionally a clonic rhythmical spasm of one or more extremities. The loss of 

consciousness may, however, be accompanied or followed by a condition of collapse, in which the 

pale face, profuse perspiration, cold extremities, and feeble pulse all suggest the administration of 

stimulants and restoratives. As a rule, in the stage of unconsciousness the face is reddened and 

rather cyanotic. The pupils are dilated as a rule and the respiration stertorous or absent; the pulse 

may be full or feeble, sometimes imperceptible for a time. The unconsciousness sometimes lasts 

for hours, and all means of stimulation, electricity, artificial respiration, rubbing, have to be applied 

before the patient can be restored. Sometimes this condition is succeeded by delirium (Moyer). In 

a certain number of cases the shock is immediately fatal, and in others the patients cannot be 

recalled from their unconsciousness.  The secondary results of the shock, aside from the injuries, 

may be very slight or again may be serious and lasting. They are far more apt to be of the first 

class, and when long or continued motor

more than a whistle, increased until it was like a fire alarm.  Thirty seconds had not passed before 

an airplane such as he had never seen came shooting out of a large cloud to go darting across his 

path.  "Lost its propeller," was his first thought. "It will crash into the sea."  When suddenly the 

plane banked sharply, began to climb, and then came darting at him like a hornet, his sensory 

changes unconnected with injuries follow, we are justified in suspecting mental or psychical 

phenomena. One class of secondary results is the motor. In addition to weakness, unsteadiness 

and tremor of the limbs and trunk, it is not uncommon for the patient to suffer from grand 

rhythmical movements, at first, perhaps, of all extremities, but soon limited to the extremity or
