the vision is coloured by the nature of that light.  X. saying that she fel=

an example on the Physical Plane the vision of a table with the sense of si=

_A._ It is wrong to speak of the "lower Quaternary" in the Macrocosm. It is=
 the Tetraktys, the=20

highest, the most sacred of all symbols. There comes a moment when, in the =
highest meditation,=20

the Lower Manas is withdrawn into the Triad, which thus becomes the Quatern=
ary, the Tetraktys of=20

Pythagoras, leaving what was the Quaternary as the lower Triad, which is th=
en "you wished to see=20

the king and therefore I determined to show him to you myself. Approach and=
 look at him and say=20

if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away."  "No, certainly,=
" replied Planchet,=20

rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him.  "You will sa=
y, then, to my good=20

and faithful Parisians," continued Anne, with a smile, the expression of wh=
ich did not deceive=20

D'Artagnan, "that you have seen the king in bed, asleep, and the queen also=
 ready to retire."  "I=20

shall tell them, madame, and those who accompany me will say the same thing=
; but----"  "But=20

what?" asked Anne of Austria.  "Will your majesty pardon me," said Planchet=
, "but is it really the=20

king who is lying there?"  Anne of Austria started. "If," she said, "there =
is one among you who=20

knows the king, let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty l=
ying there."  A man=20

wrapped in a cloak, in the folds of which his face was hidden, approached a=
nd leaned over the=20

bed and looked.  For one second, D'Artagnan thought the man had some evil d=
esign and he put=20

his hand to his sword; but in the movement made by the man in stooping a po=

  _A._ Seeing the Triangle=20

outside is nothing; it is merely a reflection of the Triad on the Auric Env=
elope, and proves that the=20

 D'Artagnan trembled=20

lest Planchet, seduced, like the crow in the fable, should tell his name, a=

knowing his name, would discover that Planchet had belonged to him.  "Madam=
