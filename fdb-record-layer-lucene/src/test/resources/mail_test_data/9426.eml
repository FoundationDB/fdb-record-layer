ccurred.  Various symptoms of the _
wail of the jet plane he feared the worst. They had been killed or taken pr=
isoner. Only the fact that=20

six husky natives armed with powerful rifles were hidden away in the shadow=
s beyond his small=20

harbor kept him there.  Then suddenly he heard a loud "Yoo--hoo! Yoo--hoo! =
I'm here! Taxi over!"=20

He recognized the voice. It was Mary.  When he slid in close to a flat rock=
 he found her=20

surrounded by a score of natives. She was embracing them and calling them p=
et names as if they=20

were her brothers and sisters.  At last, grabbing up a battered overnight b=
ag and Jack's violin, she=20

called out a native word that Ted thought must mean "good-by," then made a =
flying leap for his left=20

wing, which very nearly touched the rock.  From the rock came a roar of far=
ewells. Then two=20

bronze giants leaped into the water to push the plane away.  Ted set his mo=
tor roaring, slowed it=20

to a crawl, then sent his fighter gliding out onto the moonlit sea.  A mome=
nt later, like wild birds=20

separated for a time, two planes--one a fighter, the other a freak--came cl=
ose to one another, then=20

streaked away toward the western night skies.  Ted was in the lead. From ti=
me to time Jack=20

banked this way and that, testing the jet plane. He went into a short spira=
l, then righted the plane=20

to climb back into position.  "Boy!" he exclaimed. "This is the smoothest f=
lying kite I ever hope to=20

see!"  He wanted to tilt her nose and aim at the stars, to try out the plan=
e in the stratosphere, but=20

he could not be sure of the oxygen, and besides, he did not wish to lose co=
ntact with Ted. Ted had=20

the chart showing the course the task force was taking. It would be easy to=
 become lost on the=20

vast Pacific, to run out of gas and fall into the sea. What a climax to an =
exciting adventure that=20

would be!  The sky had cleared. The moon shone in all its glory. "No troubl=
e finding the task force=20

on such a night," he said to Stew.  "None at all," Stew agreed.  They zoome=
d along until Jack's=20

dial indicated that they had passed the halfway mark in their journey. Shou=
ld overtake the _Black=20

Bee_ in another hour at the most, he thought.  Meanwhile in the plane ahead=
 a transformation was=20

taking place. on the neck similar to those produced by the fingers of a han=
d applied for=20

strangulation. In the case related by Cook and Boulting the right side of t=
he body appeared like an=20

exaggerated example of post-mortem staining. There are sometimes found also=
 dark-brown spots,=20

small or large, which may be soft and, when cut, containing fluid blood, or=
 they may be hard and=20

like parchment, dry, and bloodless on section.  Closely connected with thes=
e are the so-called=20

dendroid or dendritic marks, which are dark-colored reddish bands or stripe=
s, often more or less=20

dichotomously branched, not disappearing under pressure, found on the bodie=
s of those struck by=20

lightning. Though usually of the form mentioned, they may assume other shap=
es, as that of an=20

irregular star with zig-zag rays. Balfour has figured an excellent example =
of these.  =3DMetallic=20

staining=3D of the skin has been known to occur where metals were in contac=
t with it at the time of=20

the lightning stroke. These stains may be permanent and are due to the intr=
oduction of the finely=20

divided metal. Richardson has succeeded in producing this artificially in a=
nimals. He found two=20

conditions required, that the metallic conductor should be sufficiently fin=
e to offer resistance to the=20

current and that the current itself should be an electric discharge of low =
tension.  Loss of hair is=20

said to have occurred from lightning, though the hair was not burnt. One ca=
se has been reported=20

where after a severe stroke all the hair on the body is said to have fallen=
 out.   SYMPTOMS.=20

Under this heading we shall consider only such symptoms as are, so far as c=
an be ascertained,=20

We will consider first those=20

relating to the nervous system.  =3DLoss of Consciousness.=3D=E2=80=94This =
occurs to a greater or less=20

extent in all but the very mildest cases. It varies throughout all degrees =
from a slight momentary=20



benumbing of the faculties to the most profound stupor or coma. It may then=
 last hours or even=20

days. On recovery the patient is apt to have some loss of memory, to be daz=
ed and confused for=20

some time, and a certain obtuseness or blunting of the=20
