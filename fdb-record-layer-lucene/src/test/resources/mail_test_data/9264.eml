normal attitude toward his fellow-men than a disposition to yield to the sudden joking impulse. But 

the hawk-faced man's perturbation was so real, or so faultlessly simulated, that he could not resist 

the temptation.  "How do you know that I am not a Government agent?" he demanded, with a 

decent show of gravity.  "Because you are not travelling on Government transportation," was the 

shrewd retort.  At another time Blount might have wondered why a casual fellow-traveller should 

have taken the trouble to make the discovery. But at the moment he was intent only upon keeping 

the small misunderstanding alive.  "I suppose you have seen my ticket, but you can't tell anything 

by that," he countered, laughing. "A good many civilian employees of the Government travel 

nowadays on regular tickets, like other people."  "I know away his valuables.  But the plan 

suggested by Scott and adopted by the commander had not worked as had been expected. The 

Guardian-Mother ought to be there in the bay, or somewhere in the vicinity; but nothing had been 

seen of her, and no one knew what had become of her. According to the plan, the two steamers 

were to find a way to escape from the pirate, and Scott had marked out the manner in which it was 

to be done. The gale and the non-appearance of the ship had upset the plan, though the Maud 

had carried out her portion of the programme.  "What next, Captain Scott?" asked Louis.  "Wait," 

replied the captain.  "Wait for what?"  "I don't know," replied Scott, shaking his head. "Wait for 

whatever is to come."  "But what is to come?" asked Louis, who still had a fear that the captain 

would resort to some fool-hardy

swift eye-shot which Blount missed: "Especially if they happen to be travelling on the quiet to catch 

some poor devil napping on the job."  "You needn't be alarmed; you haven't told me anything that 

the department could make use of," returned Blount, carrying the jest the one necessary move 

farther along.  It was precisely at this point, as Blount remembered afterward, that the timber-

thieving subject was dropped. Later on, after the talk had drifted back to mining, and from mining 

to politics, the nervous gentleman pleaded weariness and declared his intention of going to his 

section to take a nap, and presently disappeared to carry it out.   "You know just as much about 

this affair as I do, Louis, and you may be a better prophet than I am. It is not a question of 

navigation just now, or I should be willing to take the entire responsibility. Of course the handling 

of the Maud is an important element in getting out of the scrape, whatever it may prove to be. I 

have somewhere seen a picture of a good-looking gentleman playing chess with an individual 

provided with horns, hoofs, and a caudal appendage. But in this game the mortal appeared to 

have the best of it, and he says to the infernal power, 'Your next move.'"  "And that is what you say
