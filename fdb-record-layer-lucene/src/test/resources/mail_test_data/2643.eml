suddenly away.  "You can't beat it anywhere in _this_ world," he said with a smile.  It was an 

unpretentious sort of pleasure that Teeny-bits and his friend shared that Sunday afternoon. When 

the meal was over they walked lazily through the village to look at some of the old buildings that 

were standing in Revolutionary days and then they came lazily back and Dad Holbrook harnessed 

the sorrel horse and drove them up to Ridgley. Neil Durant spoke sincerely when he said:  "I don't 

know when I've had such a good Sunday, and as for the dinner--I could talk a week about it." 

While Teeny-bits and the football captain were spending the afternoon in Hamilton, two of their 

schoolmates, Campbell and Bassett, were using their time, as it seemed to them, to no little 

advantage. Campbell had telephoned to his mother and had persuaded her to send the family 

automobile--a heavy, seven-passenger machine--to the school for him.  The chauffeur brought it to 

a stop in front of Gannett Hall at twelve o'clock and Campbell had the satisfaction of ordering the 

driver to take the rear seat and, with Bassett at his side, of piloting the big car out of the campus. 

He went by the most roundabout way and cut the corners of the gravel drives at a pace that was 

intended to make the Ridgleyites who were lounging in the dormitory windows sit up and take 

notice. After a spin out through Greensboro they arrived at the Campbell place in time for dinner 

and Bassett had an opportunity to see the "got-rich-quick" pictures and to eat from plates that 

were lavishly decorated in the best style of the shops that cater to the tastes of those persons 

whose family crest is the dollar sign. Bassett thought it was "grand and gorgeous" and he made a 

mental note of several things that he intended to have duplicated in his own home at the next 

available opportunity.  Campbell, Senior, was away on a business trip, but Mrs. Campbell 

succeeded in making the dinner sufficiently impressive. She was a large woman with a heavy, 

double chin and a high, somewhat whining voice which she kept in constant use. Obviously she 

was much attached to Tracey, and Bassett could see with half a glance that her son could, by 

using his talents, persuade her to do almost anything for him.  "I suppose you two are great 

friends," she said to Bassett. "Every one likes Tracey."  "Oh, yes, we go around together a lot," 

said the Whirlwind with his most winning smile.  "And are you as athletic as Tracey is?" asked Mrs. 

Campbell.  "Well, you see, I've got flat feet," said Bassett in a tone that implied that if he were not 

so afflicted he would be captain of all the major sports in the school.  "You're on the first team now, 

I suppose, Tracey," said Mrs. Campbell.  "No," said Tracey, "they're still making me play with the 

scrub."  "Why?" demanded his mother, raising her shrill voice. "You told me two and a sanguine 

hope is entertained, that no backwardness or indifference will be manifested by those who may 

fortunately have it in their power to forward specimens.  In collecting the fishes and reptiles of the 

Ohio, the Mississippi, and the Lakes, the managers will likewise need all the aid which their fellow-

citizens may feel disposed to give them. Although not a very interesting department of zoology, no 

object of the Society offers so great a prospect of novelty as that which embraces these animals. 

The managers, therefore, flatter themselves that they will not be suffered to proceed unaided in 

this portion of their labours.  The obscure and neglected race of insects will not be overlooked, and 

any specimens sufficiently perfect to be introduced into a cabinet of entomology, will be thankfully 

received.  The western country, from having afforded some of the most gigantic and curious 

remains of land animals which have yet been discovered, seems entitled to a museum of such 

relics. A collection of this kind will be one of the earliest objects of the Society. Its funds will be 

liberally expended for the purpose; and if aided by those who may be so fortunate as to discover 



any of the great bones which lie buried in our alluvial or bottom lands, the managers hope, at no 

distant period, to repair, in some degree, the losses which have been repeatedly sustained by 

exportation of these interesting fossils.  The third class comprises objects of very little utility, but of 

extraordinary interest. Nothing, indeed, presented by the western country seems to excite in a 

higher degree the curiosity of strangers, than the relics and vestiges of the extinct and 

comparatively civilized population with which it abounds.  The managers will make every possible 

effort to form an extensive collection of these remains.  It is extremely unfortunate for those 

engaged in researches concerning the objects of this class, that so many of them have been 

disseminated abroad. To study them successfully, it is necessary that they should be compared, 

and for this purpose they must be brought together. The managers hope, therefore, that such 

persons as now hold, or may hereafter possess any of these antiquities, will dispose of them to the 

Society, instead of sending them out of the country. In this way, and in this only, can a valuable 

collection of these unique curiosities be formed.  The remaining class comprehends the weapons, 

utensils, trinkets, and other manufactures of our neighbouring Indians, of which the managers 

hope, in a short time, to be able to exhibit a great variety.  The curiosities of this country are the 

primary, but not the exclusive objects of the Society. It proposes in due time to open a gallery of 

paintings, and thus offer to the lovers and cultivators of the fine arts, a few of those models which 

are absolutely necessary to the

you tell me?"  "They're not giving Tracey a fair show, Mrs. Campbell," declared Bassett. "The 

coach has a few favorites and he can't see _anything_ that any one else does."  Mrs. Campbell let 

her fork fall into her plate with a clatter. "I'm going to see Doctor Wells about it!" she declared. 

"Such a condition is perfectly shameful! Why, it's--it's----"  "Now, mother, don't do anything like 

that," warned Tracey. "You'd only spoil what chances I've got."  "Well, if they can't treat you fairly, 

I'd rather have you leave the school. Your father will have something to say about this when he 

comes home. I don't doubt that he'll go right up there and make them stand around a bit."  "By the 

time he gets home I'll be on the team," said Tracey.  In the afternoon Campbell and his satellite 

rode out into the country without the chauffeur and Tracey took occasion to race any automobile 

that would accept an obvious challenge. It was his particular delight to drive alongside a car of one 

of the cheaper makes and to pretend that he was doing his utmost to pass and in that way to lure 

the small-car owner into competition. Sometimes he succeeded and after he had made his victim 

believe that the big car was about to be vanquished he would step hard on the accelerator and 

leave the scene of competition in a cloud of dust. On such occasions Bassett felt called upon to 

turn and thumb his nose at the crestfallen driver.  At dusk the pair came back to Greensboro for 

refreshment and Campbell declared that he would take Bassett to a "regular place."  Greensboro 

was a bustling town in which there were department stores, theaters and restaurants. The stores 

and theaters were closed, but the restaurants were open, though Sunday business was dull. 

Campbell drove the big car down a side street and stopped in front of a building that was 

decorated with an Oriental sign announcing to the world that this was the Eating Palace of Chuan 

Kai. "Here's where I feed you the dinner I owe you," he said.  Tracey seemed to be well known to 

the Oriental managers of the restaurant. Chuan Kai himself, a yellow Chinaman in American 

clothes, greeted him in with a smile that showed his tusks; he directed the two to a table set in a 

little booth that was decorated with panels showing dragons and temples. Here Tracey and 

Bassett lolled back at ease, ate chow mein and chop suey with mushrooms, drank tea from small 

cups without handles and smoked till the air of the little booth was blue.  Chuan Kai stole softly in 

and out and occasionally glanced with satisfaction at the two students. They were spending 

money freely and the wily old Oriental knew that young Campbell would drop a fat tip into his 

yellow palm when it so pleased him to leave the restaurant. Silently the Chinese waiters in their 

slippers and loose trousers slipped in and out of the mysterious regions where the strange food 

was prepared. Tracey, displaying nonchalance for Bassett's benefit, declared that old Chuan Kai 

kept "a dozen Chinks on the job", and that they all slept in rooms directly above the restaurant. 

The persons who sat at the  The managers will be happy, moreover, to receive from such of their 

eastern brethren as are desirous of contributing to the amelioration and advancement of a new 

and remote community, any of the productions of foreign countries that may be calculated to 

promote this object; and will, in return, cheerfully exchange any specimens of the curiosities of this 

country which they can spare without injury to their collection.  They will, if required, pay a 

reasonable price for every article which may be deemed worthy of introduction into the museum. 

They intend to publish, annually, a catalogue of all the more valuable donations which may be 

made to the museum, with the names of the donors.    ELIJAH SLACK,   }   JAMES FINDLAY,  }

15, 1818._  Caleb Atwater, Esq. of Circleville, Ohio, is engaged in writing Notes on the State of 



Ohio, a work which is intended to embrace the most important features and interests of this new 

and rising State.   To this laudable effort, and to that of the Western Museum Society, whose 

address is published above, we cordially wish success. From the zeal, talent, and industry of the 

gentlemen concerned, we have every reason to expect a happy result.  We view, with much 

satisfaction, the efforts which have been already made, and are rapidly increasing, to bring to light 

the resources, and to develope the history, of the western States; and it will always give us 

pleasure, if through the medium of this Journal, or in any other manner, we can contribute to 

promote them.     ART. XXIV. _Extract of a Letter from Colonel Gibbs to the Editor._ 

SUNSWICK, June, 1818.    DEAR SIR,  Since I saw you, I have made only one experiment on 

magnetism. I determined the power of my magnet, as it had been shut up in the dark for a long 

time, and lying down. I then exposed it to the rays of the sun, also lying down, and remote from the 

iron support, and I found that it had gained 12 oz. power in 40 minutes, and 14 oz. power only in 

five hours.     ART. XXV. _A New Lamp, without Flame._  From the Annals of Philosophy for 

March, 1818. Communicated by Mr. THOMAS GILL.   This lamp is one of the results of the new 

discoveries in chemistry. It has been found, by Sir H. Davy, that a fine platina wire, heated red hot, 

and held in the vapour of ether, would continue ignited for some time; but, I believe, no practical 

use has been made of this fact.  If a cylindrical coil of thin platina wire be placed, part of it round 

the cotton wick of a spirit lamp, and part of it above the wick, and the lamp be lighted, so as to 

heat the wire to redness; on the flame being blown out, the vapour of the alcohol will keep the 

upper part of the wire _red hot_, for any length of time, according to the supply of alcohol, and with 

little expenditure thereof; so as to be in constant readiness to kindle German fungus, or paper 

prepared with nitre, and, by this means, to light a sulphur match at pleasure. This lamp affords 

sufficient light to show the hour of the night by a watch, and to

nondescript lot--some the riff-raff of the town who found it cheaper to eat at Kai's than to eat 

elsewhere, others, more respectable in appearance, who doubtless had been drawn to the place 

by curiosity.  "Do you really want to give him a good jolt?" said Bassett to Campbell.  "I told you I 

did."  "Then why not try my plan? I know it will work."  Bassett leaned forward and talked in low 

tones as if fearing to be overheard, but there was no danger of that, for the other persons in the 

restaurant were too much interested in their own affairs to eavesdrop on two young fellows 

chatting in a booth.  At eight o'clock Campbell and Bassett sauntered out other useful services; but 

does not hinder the repose of persons unaccustomed to keep a light burning in their bed-room, nor 

does it require to be snuffed.  The proper size of the platina wire is the 1/100th part of an inch: a 

larger one will only yield a dull, red light, and a smaller one is difficult to use. About 12 turns of the 

wire will be sufficient, coiled around any cylindrical body suited to the size of the wick of the lamp; 

and four or five coils should be placed on the wick, and the remainder of the wire above it; and 

which will be the part ignited. A wick, composed of twelve threads of the ordinary sized lamp 

cotton yarn, with the platina wire coiled around it, will require about half an ounce of alcohol to 

keep it alight

received his fat tip. The big car rolled out to the "mansion" on the hillock and, when the chauffeur 

had been found, sped to Ridgley School. Five minutes before nine it discharged its burden at the 

doors of Gannett Hall.  During the week that followed there was a frenzy of football talk in every 

Ridgley dormitory. At chapel on Tuesday morning Doctor Wells granted Neil Durant's request to 

hours.  An agreeable and slightly acid smell arises from this lamp during its ignition. It is perfectly 

safe, as nothing can fall from it; and its novel appearance, in a wick's keeping red hot for such a 

length of time, is very surprising to persons unacquainted with its nature.  P.S.--When the wire has 

become oxided, it will be necessary to uncoil it, and rub it bright again with fine
