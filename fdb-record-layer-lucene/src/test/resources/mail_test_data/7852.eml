bills which Negroes=20

Tucker said: "Our sole=20

 and their means of using=20

it--a security which we have lately found is not to be relied on, and which=

diminishes. Every year adds to the number of those who can read and write; =

knowledge is the principal agent in evolving the spirit we have to fear."[6=

by a formidable plot which the officials believed was due to the "sinister"=
 influences of enlightened=20

Negroes.[1] The moving spirit of this organization was Denmark Vesey. He ha=

Jack Purcell, an accomplice of Vesey, weakened in the crisis and confessed.=
 He said that Vesey=20

was in the habit of reading to him all the passages in the newspapers, that=
 related to Santo=20

Domingo and apparently every accessible pamphlet that had any connection wi=
th slavery.[3] One=20

day he read to Purcell the speeches of Mr. King on the subject of slavery a=

friend of the Negro race declared he would continue to speak, write, and pu=
blish pamphlets=20

against slavery "the longest day he lived," until the Southern States conse=
nted to emancipate their=20

slaves.[4]  [Footnote 1: _The City Gazette and Commercial Daily Advertiser_=

uence of the educated=20

Negro. This official felt that Monday, the slave of Mr. Gill, was the most =
daring conspirator. Being=20

able to read and write he "attained an extraordinary and dangerous influenc=
e over his fellows."=20

"Permitted by his owner to occupy a house in the central part of this city,=
 he was afforded hourly=20

opportunities for the exercise of his skill on those who were attracted to =
his shop by business or=20

favor." "Materials were abundantly furnished in the seditious pamphlets bro=

they say.    From a lily bud can a voice be sent?--   'Let us hope the Capt=

who leave _Home_ with regret,   And greet it again as the sailor greets sho=

fifty questions beginning with Who?   Midnight approaches--a sense of repos=

 almost a stare--   Pulls=20

liberty by his perusal of the accounts of servile insurrections and the con=
