And he sends a letter to Robespierre. And to the Committee of Public Safety=

in death!"  His friends call this new invention of his: "Marriage Republica=
in!" and he is pleased with=20

the _mot_.  And Republican marriages become the order of the day.   II  Nan=
tes itself now is akin=20

to a desert--a desert wherein the air is filled with weird sounds of cries =
and of moans, of furtive=20

footsteps scurrying away into dark and secluded byways, of musketry and con=
fused noises, of=20

sorrow and of lamentations.  Nantes is a city of the dead--a city of sleepe=
rs. Only Carrier is awake-

-thinking and devising and planning shorter ways and swifter, for the exter=
mination of traitors.  In=20

the Hotel de la Villestreux the tiger has built his lair: at the apex of th=
e island of Feydeau, with the=20

windows of the hotel facing straight down the Loire. From here there is a m=
agnificent view=20

downstream upon the quays which are now deserted and upon the once prospero=
us port of=20

Nantes.  The staircase of the hotel which leads up to the apartments of the=
 proconsul is crowded=20

every day and all day with suppliants and with petitioners, with the citize=
ns of the household and=20

the members of the Compagnie Marat.  But no one has access to the person of=
 the dictator. He=20

stands aloof, apart, hidden from the eyes of the world, a mysterious person=
ality whose word sends=20

hundreds to their death, whose arbitrary will has reduced a once flourishin=
g city to abject poverty=20

and squalor. No tyrant has ever surrounded himself with a greater paraphern=
alia of pomp and=20

circumstance--no aristo has ever dwelt in greater luxury: the spoils of chu=
rches and chateaux fill=20

the Hotel de la Villestreux from attic to cellar, gold and silver plate ado=
rn his table, priceless works=20

of art hang upon his walls, he lolls on couches and chairs which have been =
the resting-place of=20

kings. The wholesale spoliation of the entire country-side has filled the d=
emagogue's abode with=20

all that is most sumptuous in the land.  And he himself is far more inacces=
sible than was _le Roi=20

Soleil_ in the days of his most towering arrogance, than were the Popes in =
the glorious days of=20

mediaeval Rome. Jean Baptiste Carrier, the son of a small farmer, the obscu=
re deputy for Cantal=20

in the National Convention, dwells in the Hotel de la Villestreux as in a s=
tronghold. No one is=20

allowed near him save a few--a very few--intimates: his valet, two or three=
 women, Fleury the=20

commander of the Marats, and that strange and abominable youngster, Jacques=
 Lalouet, about=20

whom the chroniclers of that tragic epoch can tell us so little--a cynical =
young braggart, said to be=20

a cousin of Robespierre and the son of a midwife of Nantes, beardless, hand=
some and vicious: the=20

only human being--so we are told--who had any influence over the sinister p=
roconsul: mere=20

hanger-on of Carrier or spy of the National Convention, no one can say--a m=
alignant personality=20

which has remained an enigma and a mystery to this hour.  None but these fe=
w are ever allowed=20

now inside the inner sanctuary wherein dwells and schemes the dictator. Eve=
n Lamberty, Fouquet=20

and the others of the staff are kept at arm's length. Martin-Roget, Chauvel=
in and other strangers=20

are only allowed as far as the ante-room. The door of the inner chamber is =
left open and they hear=20

the proconsul's voice and see his silhouette pass and repass in front of th=
em, but that is all.  Fear=20

of assassination--the inevitable destiny of the tyrant--haunts the man-tige=
r even within the=20

fastnesses of his lair. Day and night a carriage with four horses stands in=
 readiness on La Petite=20

Hollande, the great, open, tree-bordered Place at the extreme end of the Is=
le Feydeau and on=20

which give the windows of the Hotel de la Villestreux. Day and night the ca=
rriage is ready--with=20

coachman on the box and postillion in the saddle, who are relieved every tw=
o hours lest they get=20

sleepy last descended on them they found the garrison ready.  But the defen=
ders might as well=20

have remained quiet and gone to their beds.  Night was drawing near at the =
time, and was, as it=20

were, precipitated by the grasshoppers, which darkened the whole sky with w=
hat appeared to be a=20



heavy shower of snow.  The fires were lighted, water was poured into the tr=
ench, and the two=20

households fought with blanket, sheet, counterpane, and towel, in a manner =
that proved the=20

courage of the ancient heroes to be still slumbering in men and women of mo=
dern days.  But what=20

could courage do against such overwhelming odds?  Thousands were slaughtere=
d.  Millions=20

pressed on behind.  "Don't give in, lads," cried the heroic and desperate H=
ighlander, wielding a=20

great green blanket in a way that might have roused the admiration if not t=
he envy of Ajax himself.=20

"Keep it up, Jenkins!"  "Ay, ay, sir!" responded the nautical warrior, as h=
e laid about him with an=20

enormous buffalo robe, which was the only weapon that seemed sufficiently s=
uited to his gigantic=20

frame; "never say die as long as there's a shot in the locker."  Elise stoo=
d behind him, lost in=20

admiration, and giving an imbecile flap now and then with a towel to anythi=
ng that happened to=20

come in front of her.  Elspie was more self-possessed.  She tried to wield =
a jack-towel with some=20

effect, while Dan, Fergus, Duncan junior, Bourassin, Andre Morel, and other=
s ably, but uselessly,=20

supported their heroic leader.  La Certe, who chanced to be there at the ti=
me, went actively about=20

encouraging others to do their very best.  Old Peg made a feeble effort to =
do what she conceived=20

to be her duty, and Okematan stood by, calmly looking on--his grave counten=
ance exhibiting no=20

symptom of emotion, but his mind filled with intense surprise, not unmingle=
d with pity, for the=20

Palefaces who displayed such an amount of energy in attempting the impossib=
le.  That self-

defence, in the circumstances, was indeed impossible soon became apparent, =
for the enemy=20

descended in such clouds that they filled up the half-formed ditch, extingu=
ished the fires with their=20

dead bodies, defied the blanket-warriors, and swarmed not only into the gar=
den of old Duncan=20

McKay but overwhelmed the whole land.  Darkness and exhaustion from the fig=
ht prevented the=20

people of Ben Nevis Hall and Prairie Cottage from at first comprehending th=
e extent of the=20

calamity with which they had thus been visited, but enough had been seen to=
 convince McKay that=20

his garden was doomed.  When he at last allowed the sad truth to force itse=
lf into his mind he=20

suffered Elspie to lead him into the house.  "Don't grieve, daddy," she sai=
d, in a low comforting=20

tone; "perhaps it won't be as bad as it seems."  "Fetch me my pipe, lass," =
he said on reaching his=20

bedroom.  "Goot-night to you, my tear," he added, on receiving the implemen=
t of consolation.=20

"Won't you eat--or drink--something, daddy dear?"  "Nothing--nothing.  Leav=
e me now.  We hev=20

had a goot fight, whatever, an' it iss to bed I will be goin' now."  Left a=
lone the old man lay down in=20

his warrior-harness, so to speak, lighted his pipe, smoked himself into a s=
ort of philosophical=20

contempt for everything under the sun, moon, and stars, and finally dropped=
 his sufferings, as well=20

as his pipe, by falling into a profound slumber.  Next morning when the peo=
ple of Red River arose,=20

they became fully aware of the disaster that had befallen them.  The grassh=
oppers had made what=20

Jenkins styled a clean sweep from stem to stern.  Crops, gardens, and every=
 green herb in the=20

settlement had perished; and all the sanguine hopes of the long-suffering s=
ettlers were blighted=20

once more.  Before passing from this subject it may be as well to mention t=
hat the devastating=20

hosts which visited the colony at this time left=20


_
slack--with luggage in the boot and provisions always kept fresh inside the=
 coach; everything=20

always ready lest something--a warning from a friend or a threat from an en=
emy, or merely a=20

sudden access of unreasoning terror, the haunting memory of a bloody act--s=
hould decide the=20

tyrant at a moment's notice to fly from the scenes of his brutalities.   II=
I  Carrier in the small room=20

which he has fitted up for himself as a sumptuous boudoir, paces up and dow=
n just like a wild=20

beast in its cage: and he rubs his large bony hands together with the excit=
ement engendered by=20

his own cruelties, by the that which turned out to be a worse affliction th=
an themselves.  They had=20

deposited their larvae in the ground, and, about the end of the June follow=
ing, countless myriads=20

of young grasshoppers issued forth to overrun the fields.  They swarmed in =
such masses as to be=20

two, three, and--in some places near water--even four inches deep.  Along t=
he rivers they were=20

found in heaps like sea-weed, and the water was almost poisoned by them.  E=
very vegetable=20

substance was devoured--the leaves and even bark of trees were eaten up, th=
e grain vanished as=20

fast as it appeared above ground, everything was=20


_
has invented and carried through.  There never was an uglier man than Carri=
er, with that long=20

hatchet-face of his, those abnormally high cheekbones, that stiff, lanky ha=
ir, that drooping, flaccid=20

mouth and protruding underlip. Nature seemed to have set herself the task o=
f making the face a=20

true mirror of the soul--the dark and hideous soul on which of a surety Sat=
an had already set his=20

stamp. But he is dressed with scrupulous care--not to say elegance--and wit=
h a display of jewelry=20

the provenance of which is as unjustifiable as that of the works of art whi=
ch fill his private sanctum=20

in every nook and cranny.  In front of the tall window, heavy curtains of c=
rimson damask are drawn=20

closely together, in order to shut out the light of day: the room is in all=
 but total darkness: for that is=20

the proconsul's latest caprice: that no one shall see him save in semi-obsc=
urity.  Captain Fleury=20

has stumbled into the room, swearing lustily as ultimately, when they died =
in myriads, the=20

decomposition of their dead bodies was more offensive than their living pre=
sence.  Thus the=20

settlers were driven by stress of misfortune once again to the plains of Pe=
mbina, and obliged to=20

consort with the Red-men and the half-breeds, in obtaining sustenance for t=
heir families by means=20

of the gun, line, trap, and snare.    CHAPTER TWENTY.  LITTLE BILL BECOMES =
A DIFFICULTY.=20

We must now pass over another winter, during which the Red River settlers h=
ad to sustain life as=20

they best might--acquiring, however, in doing so, an expertness in the use =
of gun and trap and=20

fishing-line, and in all the arts of the savages, which enabled them to act=
 with more independence,=20

and to sustain themselves and their families in greater comfort than before=
.  Spring, with all its=20

brightness, warmth, and suggestiveness had returned to cheer the hearts of =
men; and, really,=20

those who have never experienced the=20


_
his shins against the angle of a priceless Louis XV bureau. He has to make =
report on the work=20

done by the Compagnie Marat. Fifty-three priests from the department of Anj=
ou who have refused=20

to take the new oath of obedience to the government of the Republic. The re=
d-capped Company=20

who tracked them down and arrested them, vow that all these _calotins_ have=
 precious objects--

money, jewelry, gold form no conception of the feelings with which the body=
--to say nothing of the=20

soul--opens up and expands itself, so to speak, in order to receive and ful=
ly appreciate the sweet=20

influences of spring.  For one thing, seven or eight months of cold, biting=
, steely frost causes one=20

almost to forget that there ever was such a thing as summer heat, summer sc=
ents, summer=20

sounds, or summer skies.  The=20


_
persons. What is to be done about these things? Are the _calotins_ to be al=
lowed to keep them or=20

to dispose of them for their own profit?  Carrier is highly delighted. What=
 a haul!  "Confiscate=20

everything," he cries, "then ship the whole crowd of that pestilential rabb=
le, and don't let me hear=20

another word about them."  Fleury goes. And that same night fifty-three pri=
ests are therefore like=20

the glad, unexpected meeting of a dear old friend; and the trumpet voice of=
 the first goose, the=20

whirring wing of the first duck, and the whistle of the first plover, sound=
s like the music of the=20

spheres to one's long unaccustomed ears.  Then the trickle of water gives o=
ne something like a=20

new sensation.  It may be but a thread of liquid no thicker than a=20
