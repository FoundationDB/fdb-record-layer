the depths of despair."  "Blakeney, you are absolutely incorrigible," retorted His Highness with a 

laugh. "M. le duc," he added, once more turning to the grave Frenchman with his wonted 

graciousness, "I pray you do not form your judgment on the gilded youth of England by the 

example of my friend Blakeney. Some of us can be serious when occasion demands, you know." 

"Your Highness is pleased to jest," said M. de Kernogan stiffly. "What greater occasion for 

seriousness can there be than the present one. True, England has never suffered as France is 

suffering now, but  "I only want to know if she took long to swim ashore out o' that pool," said the 

sceptic, simply.  La Certe cast on him a glance of suspicion, and replied that his mother had found 

no difficulty in getting out of the pool.  "Is the old lady alive yet?" asked the pertinacious sceptic. 

"Of course not.  She died long long ago--thirty years ago."  "What! before you was born?  That's 

strange, isn't it?"  "No, but you not understand.  I suppose my speech is not plain to you. I said 

_three_ years ago."  "Ah! that's more like it.  I only missed what you said," returned the sceptic, 

whose name was Fred Jenkins, "for I've lived a while in France, and understand your

has engaged in a conflict against the most powerful democracy the world has ever known, she has 

thrown down the gauntlet to a set of human beasts of prey who are as determined as they are 

ferocious. England will not emerge victorious from this conflict, Monseigneur, if her sons do not 

realise that war is not mere sport and that victory can only be attained by the sacrifice of levity and 

of pleasure."  He had dropped into French in response to His Highness' remark, in order to 

express his thoughts more accurately. The Prince--a little bored no doubt--seemed disinclined to 

pursue the subject. Nevertheless, it seemed as if once again he made a decided effort not to show 

ill-humour. He even gave a knowing wink--a wink!--in the direction of his friend Blakeney and of 

Her Grace as if to beg them to set the ball of conversation rolling once more along a smoother--a 

less boring--path. He was obviously quite determined not to release M. de Kernogan from 

attendance near his royal person.   VI  As usual Sir Percy threw himself in the breach, filling the 

sudden pause with his infectious laugh:  "La!" he said gaily, "how beautifully M. le duc does talk. 

Ffoulkes," he added, addressing Sir Andrew, who was standing close by, "I'll wager you ten 

pounds to a pinch of snuff that you couldn't deliver yourself of such splendid sentiments, even in 

your own native lingo."  "I won't take you, Blakeney," retorted Sir Andrew with a laugh. "I'm no 

good at peroration."  "You should hear our distinguished guest M. Martin-Roget on the same 

subject," continued Sir Percy with mock gravity. "By Gad! can't he talk? I feel a d----d worm when 

he talks about our national levity, our insane worship of sport, our ... our ... M. le duc," he added 

with becoming seriousness and in atrocious French, "I appeal to you. Does not M. Martin-Roget 

talk beautifully?"  "M. Martin-Roget," replied the duc gravely, "is a man of marvellous eloquence, 

fired by overwhelming patriotism. He is a man who must command respect wherever he goes." 

"You have known him long, M. le duc?" queried His Royal Highness graciously.  "Indeed not very 

long, Monseigneur. He came over as an _emigre_ from Brest some three months ago, hidden in a 

smuggler's ship. He had been denounced as an aristocrat who was furthering the cause of the 

royalists in Brittany by helping them plentifully with money, but he succeeded in escaping, not only 

with his life, but also with the bulk of his fortune."  "Ah! M. Martin-Roget is rich?"  "He is sole owner 

of a rich banking business in Brest, Monseigneur, which has an important branch in America and 

correspondents all over Europe. Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest recommended him specially to 

my notice in a very warm letter of introduction, wherein he speaks of M. Martin-Roget as a 

gentleman of the highest patriotism and integrity. Were I not quite satisfied as to M. Martin-Roget's 

antecedents and present connexions I would not have ventured to present him to your Highness." 

"Nor would you have accepted him as a suitor for your daughter, M. le duc, _c'est entendu_!" 

concluded His Highness urbanely. "M. Martin-Roget's wealth will no doubt cover his lack of birth." 

"There are plenty of high-born gentlemen devoted to the royalist cause, Monseigneur," rejoined 

the duc in his grave, formal manner. "But the most just and purest of causes must at times be 

helped with money. The Vendeens in Brittany, the Princes at Coblentz are all sorely in need of 

funds...."  "And M. Martin-Roget son-in-law of M. le duc de Kernogan is more likely to feed those 

funds than M. Martin-Roget the plain business man who has no aristocratic connexions," 

concluded His Royal Highness dryly. "But even so, M. le duc," he added more gravely, "surely you 

cannot be so absolutely certain as you would wish that M. Martin-Roget's antecedents are just as 

he has told you. Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest may have acted in perfect good faith...." 

"Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest, your Highness, is a man who has our cause, the cause of our 



King and of our Faith, as much at heart as I have myself. He would know that on his 

recommendation I would trust any man absolutely. He was not like to make careless use of such 

knowledge."  "And you are quite satisfied that the worthy Bishop did not act under some dire 

pressure ...?"  "Quite satisfied, Monseigneur," replied the duc firmly. "What pressure could there 

be that would influence a prelate of such high integrity as Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest?"   VII 

There was silence for a moment or two, during which the heavy bracket clock over the door struck 

the first hour after midnight. His Royal Highness looked round at Lady Blakeney, and she gave 

him a smile and an almost imperceptible nod. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had in the meanwhile quietly 

slipped away.  "I understand," said His Royal Highness quite gravely, turning back to M. le duc, 

"and I must crave your pardon, sir, for what must have seemed to you an indiscretion. You have 

given me a very clear expose of the situation. I confess that until to-night it had seemed to me--

and to all your friends, Monsieur, a trifle obscure. In fact, it had been my intention to intercede with 

you in favour of my young friend Lord Anthony Dewhurst, who of a truth is deeply enamoured of 

your daughter."  "Though your Highness' wishes are tantamount to a command, yet would I 

humbly assert that my wishes with regard to my daughter are based upon my loyalty and my duty 

to my Sovereign King Louis XVII, whom may God guard and protect, and that therefore it is 

beyond my power now to modify them."  "May God trounce you for an obstinate fool," murmured 

His Highness in English, and turning his head away so that the other should not hear him. But 

aloud and with studied graciousness he said:  "M. le duc, will you not take a hand at hazard? My 

luck is turning, and I have faith in yours. We must fleece Blakeney to-night. He has had Satan's 

own luck these past few weeks. Such good fortune becomes positively revolting."  There was no 

more have left anything on it.  This air o' the wilderness beats the air o' the sea itself for givin' a 

fellow a twist."  The remarks of Jenkins, while they did not absolutely destroy the confidence of the 

Swiss party, shook it enough to show the wily half-breed that he must do something if possible to 

re-establish his credit.  He therefore volunteered another song, which was gladly accepted and 

highly appreciated; for, as we have said, La Certe possessed a really good and tuneful voice, and 

these immigrants were a musical people.  While this was going on at the Swiss camp-fires an 

incident occurred at the fire round which the McKay-Davidson party was assembled, which 

deserves particular notice.  Old McKay was giving some directions to Fergus; Duncan junior was 

seated opposite Dan Davidson, smoking his pipe, and Elspie had gone into her tent, when 

Slowfoot, the spouse of La Certe, drew near.  "Come along, old girl," exclaimed McKay senior.  "It 

iss some baccy you will be wantin', I'll wager."  Slowfoot did not reply in words, but the smile upon 

her face was eloquent.  "Come away, then," continued the hospitable Highlander.  "You shall hev 

a pipe of it, whatever."  He handed her a large plug of tobacco, and the woman, sitting down close 

to young Duncan, produced her pipe, and drew out a knife for the purpose of cutting up the 

tobacco.  "Hallo!" exclaimed Duncan, "where did you get hold o' my knife?"  He stopped abruptly--

a little confused in spite of himself.  For the moment he had quite forgotten that the knife had been 

left in the camp where he had slain Perrin, and the sudden sight of it had thrown him off his guard. 

It was now too late to unsay the words, but not too late to mislead his hearers.  "I got it from Marie 

Blanc," said Slowfoot with a look of surprise. "Does the knife belong to Cloudbrow?"  "I think it 

does.  I'm almost sure it iss mine.  Let me see it," returned Duncan, taking the knife from the 

woman's hand, and examining it with cool and critical deliberation.  "No," continued he, "it iss not 



mine, but very like one that I lost--so like that I felt sure at first it wass mine."  Men who lie, usually 

overact their part.  Duncan glanced suspiciously at Dan to see how he took the explanation as he 

returned the knife to Slowfoot, and Dan observed the glance, as being uncalled for-- unnatural--in 

the circumstances.  Dan was by no means of a suspicious nature, nevertheless the glance 

haunted him for many a day after that.  Suspicion once aroused is a ghost which is not easily laid. 

He tried to shake it off, and he carefully, loyally, kept it confined in his own breast; but, do what he 

would, he could not banish entirely from his mind that Duncan McKay--the brother of his Elspie--

had some sort of guilty knowledge of the murder of poor Henri Perrin.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN. 

DIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS OVERCOME.  When the bright warm days and cool starry 

nights of the Indian summer gave place to the sharp days and frosty nights of early winter--when 

young ice formed on the lakes and rendered canoeing impossible, and the ducks and geese had 

fled to warmer climes, and the Frost King had sent his first messengers of snow to cover the 

wilderness with a winding-sheet and herald his return to the Winter Palace--then it was that the 

banished Red River settlers began to feel the pinch of poverty and to understand the full extent of 

the calamity that had befallen them.  We have not space to follow them through all the details of 

that winter at Jack River.  Some died, all suffered more or less; but they had to endure it, for 

escape from the country to the civilised world was even more difficult and hopeless than escape 

from the dreaded wilds of Siberia.  The men hunted, fished under the ice, trapped, and sustained 

themselves and their families in life during the long, dreary winter; the only gain being that they 

became more or less expert at the Red-man's work and ways of life.  Only two of the Indians 

remained with them to help them over their difficulties--namely, Okematan and Kateegoose, with 

their respective squaws.  These last were invaluable as the makers of moccasins and duffle socks 

and leathern coats, without which existence in such a climate would have been impossible.  They 

also imparted their knowledge in such matters to the squaws of the white men.  There was one 

friend, however, who did not remain with the settlers when things began to look dismal around 

them.  This was the amiable, musical, story-telling La Certe.  That tender-hearted man could not 

endure the sight of human distress.  If he could not relieve it, he felt constrained to shut his eyes to 

it and to flee from it.  At the first indication of the approach of winter he had come to old McKay 

with that peculiarly mild, humble, deprecatory expression of countenance with which he was wont 

to preface an appeal for assistance of some sort.  "What iss it you will be wantin' _now_?" 

demanded the old man, rather testily, for he had an aversion to the half-breed's sneaking ways. 

"Surely you will not be wantin' more powder an' shot efter the supply I gave you last week?"  O no! 

nothing could be further from the mind of La Certe.  He had plenty of ammunition and provisions. 

He had only come to say that he was going back to--to--Red River.  "Weel, weel," returned the 

Highlander, "there is no call for hesitation, man, in tellin' me that.  I will not be breakin' my heart 

when ye are gone.  I suppose that now ye hev got the best the season can supply, ye think the 

comforts o' the Settlement will be more to your taste."  The remonstrative expression on La Certe's 

face deepened.  The idea of his own taste or comfort had not once entered his head: but he had a 

wife and child whom he was bound to consider, and he had a hut--a home-- in Red River which he 

felt constrained to look after.  Besides, he had social duties of many kinds which claimed attention. 

"I've no doubt ye hev," said McKay, with a short sarcastic laugh, "an' ye will attend to them too--I'll

father felt that her future had already been discussed far too freely by all these well-wishers who of 

a truth were not a little indiscreet. He thought that the manners and customs of good society were 

very peculiar here in this fog-ridden England. What business was it of all these high-born ladies 

and gentlemen--of His Royal Highness himself for that matter--what plans he had made for 

Yvonne's future? Martin-Roget was _bourgeois_ by birth, but he was vastly rich and had promised 

to pour a couple of millions into the coffers of the royalist army if Mlle. de Kernogan became his 

wife. A couple of millions with more to follow, no doubt, and a loyal adherence to the royalist cause 

was worth these days all the blue blood that flowed in my lord Anthony Dewhurst's veins.  So at 

any rate thought M. le duc this night, while His Royal Highness kept him at cards until the late 

hours of the morning.     CHAPTER IV  THE FATHER   I  It was close on ten o'clock now in the 

morning on the following day, and M. le duc de Kernogan was at breakfast in his lodgings in Laura 

Place, when a courier was announced who was the bearer of a letter for M. le duc.  He thought the 

man must have been sent by Martin-Roget, who mayhap was sick, seeing that he had not been 

present at the Assembly Rooms last night, and the duc took the letter and opened it without 

misgivings. He read the address on the top of the letter: "Combwich Hall"--a place unknown to 

him, and the first words of the letter: "Dear father!" And even then he had no misgivings.  In fact he 

had to read the letter through three times before the full meaning of its contents had penetrated 

into his brain. Whilst he read, he sat quite still, and even the hand which held the paper had not 

the slightest tremor. When he had finished he spoke quite quietly to his valet:  "Give the courier a 

glass of ale, Frederick," he said, "and tell him he can go; there is no answer. And--stay," he added, 

"I want you to go round at once to M. Martin-Roget's lodgings and ask him to come and speak with 

me as early as possible."  The valet left the room, and M. le duc deliberately read through the 

letter from end to end for the fourth time. There was no doubt, no possible misapprehension. His 

daughter Yvonne de Kernogan had eloped clandestinely with my lord Anthony Dewhurst and had 

been secretly married to him in the small hours of the morning in the Protestant church of St. 

James, and subsequently before a priest of her own religion in the Priory Church of St. John the 

Evangelist.  She apprised her father of this fact in a few suppose, to take a tender farewell o' me. 

What iss it you will be wantin'?  Oot wi' it, man!"  "There is a canoe--" said La Certe, with some 

hesitation.  "There iss many a canoe!" returned McKay with a peculiar grin.  "True, but there is one 

on the shore now, close to the flat rock which--"  "My own canoe!" interrupted the other, "what will 

ye be wantin' wi' that?"  La Certe did not wish to appear greedy, but the season was late, and his 

own canoe was not in a very fit condition to carry a family round the shores of a lake so large as 

Lake Winnipeg.  Would the white father lend his canoe to him?  It could not be wanted much 

longer that Fall, and the one he would leave behind him was an excellent canoe for ordinary 

fishing and hunting purposes.  He would be quite willing to hire the canoe or to pay the full price 

for it if any accident should happen to it.  "No," said McKay, firmly.  "No, La Certe; your hiring 

means borrowing, and your payin' means owin' a debt for the remainder o' your natural life.  I will 

see you at the bottom o' Lake Winnipeg before I will be lending you my canoe."  La Certe smiled 

sadly, and gazed at the cap with which his hands played, as if appealing to it for sympathy.  With 

an aspect of the profoundest resignation he made his bow and left the Presence.  But La Certe 

was not in the least put out by this failure.  He went to his tent, and recounted the interview to his 

squaw, who, when he entered, was in the act of giving her child, a creature of about four years of 



age, one or two draws of her pipe, to let it taste how nice it was.  Smoking in calm placidity, the 

amiable pair discussed the subject.  The conclusion they came to was, as usual, harmonious.  "I 

think he will agree to lend it next time I go to him," said La Certe, hopefully.  "He will give in," 

replied Slowfoot, decidedly.  The four-year-old could not understand the subject, and made no 

comment; but it howled for another smoke, and got it.  La Certe was wrong, and his wife was right-

-as usual.  Old McKay did not agree to "lend" his canoe the "next time," or the next again, but he 

did "give in" at last, more, perhaps, to get rid of the half-breed's importunity than because of good-

will, and sold the canoe to him--on credit.  When that winter was over, the Hudson's Bay Company 

again encouraged the settlers to return, under promise of protection, and the spring found the 

persevering people, in spite of all difficulties and previous failures, busy putting into the ground 

what little seed they possessed, and otherwise cultivating the soil.  Some of them 


_
to be dictated by profound affection and filial respect, but in which M. de Kernogan failed to detect 

the slightest trace of contrition. Yvonne! his Yvonne! the sole representative now of the old race--

eloped like a kitchen-wench! Yvonne! his daughter! his asset for the future! his thing! his fortune! 

that which he meant with perfect egoism to sacrifice on the altar of his own beliefs and his own 

loyalty to the kingship of France! Yvonne had taken her future in her own hands! She knew that 

her hand, her person, were the purchase price of so many millions to be poured into the coffers of 

the royalist cause, and she had disposed of both, in direct defiance of her father's will and of her 

duty to her King and to his cause!  Yvonne de Kernogan was false to her traditions, false to her 

father! false to her King and country! In the years to come when the chroniclers of the time came 

to write the histories of the great families that had rallied round their King in the hour of his deadly 

peril, the name of Kernogan would be erased from those glorious pages. The Kernogans will have 

failed in their duty, failed in their loyalty! Oh! the shame of it all! The shame!!  The duc was far too 

proud a gentleman to allow his valet to see him under the stress of violent emotion, but now that 

he was alone his thin, hard face--with that air of gravity which he had transmitted to his daughter--

became distorted with the passion of unbridled fury; he tore the letter up into a thousand little 

pieces and threw the fragments into the fire. On the bureau beside him there stood a miniature of 

Yvonne de Kernogan painted by Hall three years ago, and framed in a circlet of brilliants. M. le 

duc's eyes casually fell upon it; he picked it up and work, determined to provide second strings to 

their bows by following the buffalo-hunters to the plains.  These were chiefly the young and strong 

men, such as Dan Davidson and his brother Peter, Fergus McKay, Antoine Dechamp, and 

Jacques Bourassin, among many others.  La Certe also went, as well as his squaw and the four-

year-old.  He managed the thing characteristically thus.  When the half-breeds were making 

preparations for their spring hunt, he paid a visit to Duncan McKay, who was busy at the time 

helping his father and brother to rebuild their house.  Indeed the edifice was almost rebuilt, for the 

erection of small wooden houses does not usually take long.  "You've come to beg, borrow, or 

steal, no doubt," said Cloudbrow, who was worthy of his nickname, for he was as short of temper 

as Duncan senior.  No, La Certe had come to do none of these things, he said, with a conciliatory 

smile.  "Well, then, you can't have come to buy or to ask advances," growled Duncan; "for you see 

that our store and all we possessed has been burnt by your precious countrymen."  La Certe knew 

this, and professed himself profoundly grieved as well as indignant with his countrymen.  No, he 

did not come to buy or to borrow, but to hire.  The McKays had still some horses left, and carts. 

Could they not spare a horse and cart to him on hire?  "No, we can do nothing of the sort," said 

Duncan shortly, resuming his axe and work.  "You can go to the Company.  Perhaps they will trust 

you--though they are fools if they do."  La Certe was regretful, but not cast down.  He changed the 

subject, commented on the building that was going on, the prospects of a good harvest, and finally 

took refuge in that stale old subject, the weather. Then he

with his heel, destroying in this paroxysm of silent fury a work of art worth many hundred pounds. 

His daughter had deceived him. She had also upset all his plans whereby the army of M. le Prince 

de Conde would have been enriched by a couple of million francs. In addition to the shame upon 

her father, she had also brought disgrace upon herself and her  "By the way--that knife that my 

wife got from Marie Blanc--"  Young McKay stopped, and looked quickly up for a moment, with a 

slight flush, but instantly resumed work.  "Well," he said, quietly, "what about the knife?"  "Would 

you like to have it--my wife bade me inquire?"  "Why should _I_ like to have it?" he asked 

carelessly.  "Oh!  I thought it was

minor and this clandestine marriage, contracted without her father's consent, was illegal in France, 

illegal everywhere: save perhaps in England--of this M. de Kernogan was not quite sure, but he 

certainly didn't care. And in this solemn moment he registered a vow  "You are mistaken.  I said it 

was very like mine.  But it is _not_ mine--and I have no wish for what does not belong to me."  "Of 

course not.  Well, I must be going," said the half-breed, preparing to leave.  "I wished much to 

have your horse and cart, for they

long as he lived would he be reconciled to that English nincompoop who had dared to filch his 

daughter from him, and never--as long as he lived--would he by his consent render the marriage 

legal, and the children born of that wedlock legitimate in the eyes of his country's laws.  A calm 

akin to apathy had followed his first outbreak of fury. He sat down in front of the fire, and buried his 

chin in his good, and I would offer you 4 pounds for the trip, which, you know, is double the usual 

charge, for I never grudge a good price for a good thing."  "Yes, all the more when you hev no 

intention to pay it," said McKay with a laugh.  "However, since you seem so anxious, and offer so 

good a price, I am willing to oblige you this time, in the hope that you are really becoming an 

honest man!"  The half-breed
