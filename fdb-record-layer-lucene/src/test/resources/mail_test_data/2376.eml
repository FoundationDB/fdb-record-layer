dracaena marginata  _Chandanaka._ Don't you know Charudatta, man? nor Vasantasena? If you don't know Charudatta, nor Vasantasena, then you don't know the moon in heaven, nor the moonlight.      Who does n't know this moon of goodness, the _Cid_ definitely fixed, for the first time in France, the type of tragedy. The central tragic strife here is not one of rival houses.

Or Mars in his fifth?[69] Who will dare to be giving     The herdsman protection, while I am still 

living?         9, 10  _Viraka._ Chandanaka, you mercenary!      I swear on your heart, he's been 

long out of prison,     For the herdsman escaped ere the sun was half risen.         11 

_Vardhamanaka._ Get up, bullocks, get up!  _Chandanaka._ [_Discovers him._] Look, man, look! 

A covered cart is moving in the middle of the road;     Investigate it, whose it is, and where it takes 

its load!    12  _Viraka._ [_Discovers him._] Here, driver, stop your cart! Whose one of the 

household of Marie de Medicis, directed Corneille to the Spanish drama. The _Illusion Comique_, 

the latest of his tentative plays, is a step towards the _Cid_; its plot is fantastical, but in some of 

the fanfaronades of the braggart Matamore, imported from Spain, are pseudo-heroics which only 

needed a certain transposition to become the language of chivalric heroism. The piece closes with 

a lofty eulogy of the French stage.  The sun had indeed risen and the stars might disappear when 

in the closing days of 1636 the _Cid_ was given in Paris at the Theatre du

is this? who is in it? where is it going?  _Vardhamanaka._ This is Charudatta's cart. Mistress 

Vasantasena is in it. I am taking her to the old garden Pushpakaranda to meet Charudatta. 

_Viraka._ [_Approaches Chandanaka._] The driver says it is Charudatta's cart; that Vasantasena 

is in it; that he is taking her to the old garden Pushpakaranda.  _Chandanaka._ Then let it pass. 

_Viraka._ Without inspection?  [101.3. S.  _Chandanaka._ Certainly.  _Viraka._ On whose 

authority?  _Chandanaka._ On Charudatta's.  _Viraka._ Who is Charudatta, or who is 

Vasantasena, that the cart should pass Marais; the eulogy of the stage was speedily justified by its 

author. His subject was found by Corneille in a Spanish drama, _Las Mocedades del Cid_, by 

Guilhem de Castro; the treatment was his own; he reduced the action from that of a chronicle-

history to that of a tragedy; he centralised it around the leading personages; he transferred it in its 

essential causes from the external world of accident to the inner world of character; the critical 

events are moral events, victories of the soul, triumphs not of fortune but of the will. And thus, 

though there are epic episodes and lyric
