the answer to the question as to whether the given acts of the victim were =
compatible with the fatal=20

character of the wound. An alibi can aid in the acquittal of the accused on=

injury was such that death would be supposed to be immediate or nearly so. =

and degree noticed in my major; that is to say, in the first, second, third=
 and fourth degrees.  =E2=80=98In=20

examples. Wounds of the brain are especially noticeable in allowing a survi=
val of several hours,=20

cupations. Where the=20

survival has lasted days or weeks, the alibi has no importance, but not if =
the survival is of shorter=20

duration. The following case is cited by Vibert[1] and may be mentioned in =
this connection, though=20

the wound was caused by a bullet which traversed from behind forward the en=

brain. After the injury the victim was seen by several witnesses to climb a=
