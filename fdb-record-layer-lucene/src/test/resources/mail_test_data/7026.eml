philodendron monstera relentlessly from crevice to Arctic crevice. They hav=

Tolerant the empire was, at least if you did not object to having the statu=
e of Caligula set up in your Holy of Holies, and this toleration fostered t=
he growth of a new _
love him. But I balk at that word "loyal." For if I expect loyalty in my of=
fspring I surely must have it=20

myself. And I stood up before a minister of God, not so many years ago, and=
 took an oath to prove=20

loyal to my husband, to cleave to him in sickness and in health. I also too=
k an oath to honor him.=20

But he has made that part of the compact almost impossible. And my children=
, if I go back to him,=20

will come under his influence. And I can't help questioning what that influ=
ence will be. I have only=20

one life to live. And I have a human anxiety to get out of it all that is c=
oming to me. I even feel that=20

it owes me something, that there are certain arrears of happiness to be mad=
e the garden of Italy=20

became a desert. The decisive fact, however, is that the provinces decayed,=
 and that when the=20

barbarians arrived, all power of resistance was gone. That the empire was c=
onsciously levelling=20

and cosmopolitan, surely cannot be maintained. Actium was a Roman victory o=
ver the gods of the=20

nations. Augustus, who must have known something about the system, avowedly=
 aimed at=20

restoring the number, the purity, the privileged exclusiveness of the domin=
ant race. His legislation=20

was an attempt to regenerate old Rome; and the political odes of the court =
poet are full of that=20

purpose. That the empire degraded all that had once been noble in Rome is t=
rue; but the=20


_
things over with. I have had the impulse to write to Peter, and tell him ev=
erything, and ask him=20

what I ought to do. But that doesn't impress me as being quite fair to Pete=
r. And, oddly enough, it=20

doesn't impress me as being quite fair to Dinky-Dunk. So I'm going to wait =
a week or two and let=20

the cream of conviction rise on the pan of indecision. There's a tiny parli=
ament of angels, in the=20

inner chambers of our heart, who talk these things over and decide them whi=
le we sleep.=20

_Friday the Seventeenth_   We had to dig in, like bears, for two whole days=
 while the first real=20

snow-storm of the winter raged outside. But the skies have cleared, the win=
d has gone, and the=20

weather is crystal-clear again. Dinkie and Poppsy, furred to the ears, are =
out on the drifts learning=20

to use the snow-shoes which Percy and Olga sent down to them for Christmas.=
 Dinkie has made=20

himself a spear by lashing his broken-bladed jack-knife to the handle of my=
 headless dutch-hoe=20

and has converted himself into a stealthy Iluit stalking a polar bear in th=
e form of poor old Scotty,=20

who can't quite understand why he is being been noble in Rome was not the r=
egeneration of=20

humanity. The vast slave population was no more elevated by the ascendency =
of the freedmen of=20

the imperial household than the female sex was elevated by the ascendancy o=
f Messalina.  That=20

intellect declined under the emperors, and that the great writers of its ea=
rlier period, Tacitus=20

included, were really legacies of the Republic, cannot be denied; and surel=
y it is a pregnant fact.=20

The empire is credited with Roman law. But the Roman law was ripe for codif=
ication in the time of=20

the first Caesar. The leading principles of the civil law seem by that time=
 to have been in=20

existence. Unquestionably the great step had been taken of separating law a=
s a science from=20

consecrated custom, and of calling into existence regular law courts and wh=
at was tantamount to a=20

legal profession. The mere evolution of the system from its principles requ=
ired no transcendant=20

effort; and the idea of codification must have been something less than div=
ine, or it could not have=20

been compassed by the intellect of Justinian. The criminal law of the empir=
e, with its arbitrary=20

courts,=20
