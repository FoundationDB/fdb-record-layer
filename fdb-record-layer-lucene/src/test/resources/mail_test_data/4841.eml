"A little bird told me."  C. W. has an idea that the origin is from the _Ko=
ran_, where is an account=20

of all the birds being summoned before Solomon. The lapwing absents himself=
. Upon being=20

questioned why he did not immediately obey, he says he has been at the cour=
t of the Queen of=20

Sheba, who has resolved upon visiting Solomon. On the hint, Solomon prepare=
s for the queen's=20

reception. The lapwing sets off to Ethiopia, and tells the Queen that Solom=
on wishes to see her.=20

The meeting, as we know, took place.  Not having the _Koran_, C. W. cannot =
refer to it to see if it=20

is right or wrong.  183. _Baroner._--At page 105. of the volume of _Bury Wi=
lls_ published by the=20

neighbor, and charity for the needy, there would be no propriety in writing=
 this chapter. Home,=20

domestic comfort and happiness being our best earthly possessions, we would=
 be eagerly willing=20

to share them with others.  As society is constructed under a state of arti=
ficial civilization, and as=20

our homes are kept and our households are run, the element of duty must int=
erfere, or hospitality=20

would become a lost art. Even where the spirit of this=E2=80=94one of the m=
ost venerable of virtues=E2=80=94is=20

not wanting, conscience is called in to regulate the manner and the seasons=
 in which it should be=20

"Baroner" of the Monastery of Bury St. Edmunds, should assign two children =

copious and valuable, but he omits to explain the term "Baroner;" and the o=
bject of this Query is to=20

ascertain if he, or any of your numerous correspondents, can do so. I conje=

was the master of the children (or song school), but I am not aware of any =

184. _William the Third at Exeter--History of Hawick._--1. Mr. Macaulay, in=
 describing the entrance=20

of William of Orange into Exeter, mentions that he was preceded, amongst ot=
hers, by three=20

hundred gentlemen of English birth. Can any of your correspondents inform m=
e whether the=20

names of these gentlemen are known, and, if so, where the roll may be met w=
ith?  2. I remember=20

to have read an extract from a work called the _History of Hawick_ in Tevio=
tdale, but I have never=20

met with any one acquainted with the work. Is the book now extant, and, if =
so, where can it be=20

seen? If any of your correspondents should have prominence.  [Sidenote: RET=
URNING=20

COURTESIES]  It may sound harsh to assert that you have no right to accept =
hospitality for which=20

you can never make any return in kind. The principle is, nevertheless, soun=
d to the core.  Those=20

who read the newspapers forty years ago will recall a characteristic incide=
nt in the early life of=20

Colonel Ellsworth, the brilliant young lawyer who was one of the first nota=
ble victims of the Civil=20

War. His struggles to gain a foothold in his profession were attended by ma=
ny hardships and=20

humiliating privations. Once, finding the man he was looking for on a matte=
r of business, in a=20

restaurant, he was invited to partake of the luncheon to which his acquaint=
ance was just sitting=20

down. Ellsworth was ravenously hungry, almost starving, in fact, but he dec=
lined courteously but=20

firmly, asking permission to talk over the business that had brought him th=
ither, while the other=20

went on with the meal.  The brave young fellow, in telling the story in aft=
er years, confessed that=20

rth Wales.  185.=20

_Johannes Lychtenberger._--The "Pronosticatio," or "prophecies," which bear=
 this name, have=20

been often reprinted since what I believe to be the first edition was publi=
shed in the year 1488. In=20

giving an account of the copies of it in the Lambeth Library, I stated that=
 I knew of no other copy of=20

this edition, except one in the Douce collection in the Bodleian. Eight yea=
rs have elapsed since=20

that time, and I have not heard of any; and as circumstances have lately le=
d to my being engaged=20

about the book, I shall be glad if you will allow me to ask food.  [Sidenot=

(This by the way!)  I do not mean if your wealthy acquaintance invites you =
to a fifteen-course=20

dinner, the cost of which equals your monthly income, that you are in honor=
 or duty bound to bid=20

her to an entertainment as elaborate, or that you suffer in her estimation,=
 or by the loss of your=20

self-respect. But by the acceptance of=20

her copies of _this_=20

one of 1488?      S. R. MAITLAND.    Gloucester.  186. _Lestourgeon the Hor=
ologist._--I have in=20

my possession an apparently very old, though very elegant and very excellen=
t, eight-day clock,=20

with the maker's name on its face, _Thomas Lestourgeon, London_. Some years=
 ago there was=20

y of Edinburgh, what is=20

reciprocation of some sort. If you can do nothing more, ask your hostess to=
 afternoon tea in your=20

own house or flat, and have a few congenial spirits to meet her there. It i=

that makes alive and keeps alive the genial glow of good will and cordial f=
riendliness. The letter of=20
