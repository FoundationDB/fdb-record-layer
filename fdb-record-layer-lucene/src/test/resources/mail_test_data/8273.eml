JOURNEY TO BAR-LE-DUC AND TO BRUSSELS.   At this same season, Charles[65] k=
ing of=20

Navarre came to Paris to wait on the king. He negotiated so successfully wi=
th the king and his=20

privy council that he obtained a gift of the castle of Nemours, with some o=
f its dependant=20

castlewicks, which territory was made a duchy. He instantly did homage for =
it, and at the same=20

time surrendered to the king the castle of Cherbourg, the county of Evreux[=
66], and all other=20

lordships he possessed within the kingdom of France, renouncing all claim o=
r profit in them to the=20

king and to his successors, on consideration, that with this duchy of Nemou=
rs the king of France=20

engaged to pay him two hundred thousand gold crowns of the coin of the king=
 our lord.  When this=20

was done, duke Philip of Burgundy left Paris to go to Bar-le-Duc, to attend=
 the funeral of his sister=20

the duchess of Bar[67], who had died there. After this ceremony, he went to=
 his town of Arras,=20

where the duchess was, and there celebrated the feast of Easter. He then we=

Brabant, to the duchess=E2=80=99s, grandmother[68] to his wife, who had sen=

[A. D. 1404.]                                CHAP. XVIII.      THE DUKE OF =
BURGUNDY DIES IN THE=20

TOWN OF HALLE, IN         HAINAULT.=E2=80=94HIS BODY IS CARRIED TO THE CART=
HUSIAN=20

CONVENT         AT DIJON, IN BURGUNDY.   At the beginning of this year, the=
 good duke of=20

Burgundy, Philip, son to king John, and brother to Charles the rich, caused=
 himself to be carried in=20

a litter from the town of Brussels, in Brabant, to Halle, in Hainault. That=
 the horses which carried=20

him might travel more safely, and he be less shaken, labourers advanced bef=
ore the litter, with=20

spades and pick-axes to repair and smooth the roads.  When at Halle, he fix=
ed his lodgings near=20

to the church of our Lady, at an h=C3=B4tel bearing the sign of the Stag; a=
nd, finding his disorder=20

increase, he sent for his three sons, namely, John count de Nevers, Anthony=
 and Philip. On their=20

arrival, he entreated and commanded them to be loyal and obedient, during t=
heir lives, to king=20

Charles of France and to his successors, and made them promise obedience on=
 their love to him.=20

This engagement the three princes readily granted to their lord and father,=
 who then assigned to=20

each such lordships and estates as they were to hold after his decease, and=
 specified the manner=20

in which he intended they should enjoy them. All these, and various other a=
rrangements, were=20

wisely ordered by the duke in a manner becoming such a prince, who had a go=
od memory in his=20

last moments. When he had finished these matters, he died in this h=C3=B4te=
l. His body was then=20

opened, and his bowels interred in the church of our Lady at Halle; but his=
 body being well=20

embalmed, was placed in a leaden coffin, and carried to the towns of Douay =
and Arras,=20

magnificently attended, and in a manner suitable to his rank.  At Arras the=
 corpse was placed in=20

his chapel, where a solemn service was performed. The duchess Margaret[69] =
there renounced=20

her claim to his moveables, from fear of the debts being too great, by plac=
ing her girdle with her=20

purse and keys on the coffin, as is the usual custom in such cases,=E2=80=
=94and demanded that this act=20

should be put into writing by a public notary there present.  The body was =
afterward conveyed to=20

Burgundy, and interred in the church of the Carthusians near Dijon, which c=
hurch he had founded=20



and ornamented at his own expense. His heart was carried to the church of S=
aint Denis, and=20

placed near to his royal ancestors, from whom he was descended.  The duke, =
in addition to the=20

three before mentioned sons, had three daughters, namely, the archduchess o=
f Austria[70], the=20

countess of Holland[71], wife to William count of Hainault, and the duchess=
 of Savoy[72].  There=20

were great lamentations at his death, not only by his children but generall=
y by the greater part of=20

the lords of France and of his own countries; for he had prudently and ably=
 governed the affairs of=20

France, in conjunction with his elder brother the duke of Berry, by whom he=
 was much regretted.=20

After his decease, John count of Nevers, his eldest son, took possession of=
 the county and duchy=20

of Burgundy: his second son, Anthony, was declared heir to the duchy of Bra=
bant, after the death=20

of his great aunt the duchess, who immediately resigned to him the duchy of=
 Limbourg[73]. Philip,=20

his third son, inherited the county of Nevers and woman was or was not preg=
nant at the time of=20

death, since the absence of f=C5=93tal remains on the one hand might imply =
their entire decomposition=20

in advance of those of the adult; on the other hand, the indiscriminate hab=
it of undertakers, who=20

often bury still-borns with adults, may account for their presence.   ACCID=
ENTAL SIGNS AND=20

EVOLUTION OF THE TEETH.  The trade or occupation leaves but few marks on th=
e bones that=20

are useful in the matter of identification. It is in the recent and well-pr=
eserved cadaver, or, better=20

still, in the living subject, that the _professional signs_ are of importan=
ce. As a rule, the relatively=20

larger scapul=C3=A6 point to the fact of a day-laborer; necrosis of the low=
er jaw suggests a worker in=20

phosphorus; worn and discolored teeth a user of tobacco, and aurification o=
f the teeth might=20

suggest the previous social condition. Gold crowns and fillings and dental =
prosthesis generally are=20

among the most common and, at the same time, among the most useful signs of=
 identification. By=20

this means the bones of persons killed by Indians on the Western plains hav=
e been recognized=20

years afterward. The traveller Powell, massacred in Abyssinia, was recogniz=
ed in this way. From=20

the presence of artificial teeth and the mechanical appliances for fixing t=
hem, dentists may=20

recognize their own work beyond a doubt. One of the most common-hackneyed o=
f these cases is=20

that of Professor Webster.[578] Later cases, in which this kind of proof es=
tablished convincing and=20

conclusive identification, are those of Dr. Cronin, assassinated in Chicago=
 in 1889, and of the=20

bomb-thrower, Norcross. Every now and then accounts appear in the daily pre=
ss of corpses=20

having been recognized by inspection of the teeth. In Washington, only a sh=
ort time since, the=20

remains of an unknown man were exhumed from the Potter=E2=80=99s Field for =
judicial reasons. The=20

unrecognized body had been found in the Potomac in an advanced stage of dec=
omposition. From=20

the signs furnished by the teeth the remains were identified as those of a =
person who had=20

disappeared mysteriously and under circumstances that pointed to his having=
 been murdered at a=20

Virginian gambling den, and his body thrown into the river. In connection w=
ith this subject the=20

Goss-Udderzook tragedy is of instructive interest.  In every important case=
 a cast of the mouth=20

should be taken, in order to set at rest any question that may subsequently=
 arise as to the=20

condition of the jaw, the absence of teeth, their irregularity or other den=
tal peculiarities. A cast of=20

the mouth of the deceased in the Hillmon case showed all the teeth to be re=
gular and perfect,=20

while it is alleged that Hillmon=E2=80=99s teeth were just the opposite. Ex=
ternal signs furnished by dentition=20

may assist greatly in fixing both age and identity. The evolution of the hu=
man dental system has=20

been so well studied from intra-uterine life to old age that we may approxi=
mately tell the age,=20

especially of children, from the teeth alone. This sign, so valuable in chi=
ldhood, loses its value as=20



the dentition progresses. Elaborate tables and dental formul=C3=A6 to be fo=
und elsewhere deal with the=20

two periods of dentition, the relative position and number of the teeth, an=
d the like.  At birth the=20

jaws show points of ossification only; but children are sometimes born with=
 central incisors, as the=20

writer has, in common with others, noted in several instances. The _first d=
entition_ takes place=20

from the seventh to the thirtieth month; the _second_ between four and five=
 years. In rachitic=20

children these periods are later; but a syphilitic taint may hasten their d=
evelopment. The twenty-

eight teeth characterize early youth. Wisdom teeth appear between eighteen =
and twenty-five,=20

sometimes as late as thirty years. The presence of thirty-two teeth indicat=
es maturity. This number=20

is sometimes exceeded. Dr. Tidy, in his work on =E2=80=9CLegal Medicine,=E2=
=80=9D reports having seen several=20

children between six and seven years with forty-eight teeth. Instances are =
recorded of cutting the=20

teeth at advanced age, seventy and one hundred and eighteen years; of adult=
s who have never=20

had teeth; of supernumerary teeth, and of a third dentition. What purported=
 to be a third dentition=20

came under my notice some years ago, in the person of an old negro =E2=80=
=9Cvoodoo doctor.=E2=80=9D A more=20

recent case, said to have occurred in an old man of seventy-four, at Seymou=
r, Ind., is reported in=20

the _Weekly Medical Review_, St. Louis, Mo., April 16th, 1892, p. 314.  The=
 pathological signs=20

furnished by the teeth should, of course, be looked upon as a personal char=
acteristic that may=20

lend additional light in the question of identity.   CONGENITAL PECULIARITI=
ES, DEFORMITIES,=20

AND INJURIES.  But congenital peculiarities or injuries of other parts of t=
he skeleton are studied to=20

greater advantage in determining proof or disproof of identity. We may reco=
gnize cranial=20

asymmetry; the peculiar conformation of the idiot skull; the prognathous sk=
ull of the negro; the=20

pyramidal skull of some of the yellow=20

advisers, on the manner in which they should conduct themselves towards the=

lord.                                    CHAP. XIX.      WALERAN COUNT DE S=

FORCE ON THE ISLE OF         WIGHT, TO MAKE WAR AGAINST ENGLAND, BUT RETURN=
S=20

WITHOUT         HAVING PERFORMED ANY GREAT DEEDS.   In this year, Waleran c=
ount de St=20

Pol assembled at Abbeville, in Ponthieu, about sixteen hundred fighting men=
,=E2=80=94among whom were=20

numbers of the nobility, who had made great provision of salted meats, bisc=
uit, wines, brandy,=20

butter, flour, and other things necessary on board of ships. From Abbeville=
 the count led them to=20

the man; besides the ethnic artificial deformities already touched upon in =
considering the question=20

of race. A metopic cranium, a cleft palate, a deformed spine or pelvis, a l=
arger left=20

scapula=E2=80=94indicative of left-handedness; a shortened extremity; bowed=
 legs, club foot, the presence=20

of extra fingers or toes, and the relative length of the fingers are each a=
nd all valuable facts in=20

judiciary anthropology. In women of Spanish extraction the fifth finger is =
almost as long as the=20

fourth=E2=80=94a fact so well known that glove-makers take advantage of it =
in sending gloves to Mexico,=20

the Antilles, or to South America.  An estimate of the length of the hand s=
eems to be a matter of=20

difficulty, notwithstanding the extensive observation of high authority. In=
 the majority of cases the=20

ring-finger is longer than the index.  Important evidence is furnished=20


_
they found vessels of all descriptions to receive them.  When they had rema=
ined there some few=20

days to arrange their matters, and to recommend themselves to the protectio=
n of St Nicholas, they=20

embarked on board these vessels, and sailed for the Isle of Wight, which li=
es opposite to the=20

harbour of Southampton. They landed on the island, making a bold countenanc=
e to face their=20

enemies, of whom indeed they had seen but little on their landing,=E2=80=94=
for all, or at least the greater=20

part of the islanders, had retreated to the woods and fortresses.  Several =
new knights were=20

created by the count, namely, Philippe de Harcourt, Jean de Fosseux, the lo=
rd de Guiency and=20

others, who went to burn some miserable villages, and set fire to a few oth=
er places. During this, a=20

sensible priest of the island came to the count to treat for the ransom and=
 security of the island, for=20

which he gave the count to understand a very large sum of money would be pa=
id to him and his=20

captains. He too readily listened to this proposal; for it was a deception =
on the part of the priest to=20

delay their operations, and amuse them with words, until the English should=
 arrive to fight with=20

them.  Count Waleran was at length informed of this plan, and, in consequen=
ce, re-embarked with=20

his men on board the vessels; and they returned to the place whence they ha=
d come, without=20

doing any thing more. Many of the nobles were much displeased at this condu=
ct, because they=20

had expended large sums in laying in their purveyances. The countries throu=
gh which his men at=20

arms returned were greatly harrassed by as fractures, whether old or recent=
; the marks of gunshot=20

wounds, of trephining, amputation, excision, or other surgical operation on=
 the bones. The remains=20

of an old, ununited fracture in his left humerus enabled Sir William Fergus=
son to verify and settle=20

all doubt as to the identity of the body of the great missionary and explor=
er, Dr. Livingston.[579]=20

The existence of an injury may constitute evidence of great importance to t=
he accused, as=20

happened in the case of an English gentleman charged with murder, where the=
 trial turned on the=20

deposit of callus in a broken rib, the only bone produced in court. From th=
e state of this callus=20

there could be no doubt that the fracture must have been produced about eig=
ht or ten days before=20

death, and could not have belonged to the deceased. There was, therefore, c=
omplete failure of the=20

identity, and the accused was discharged.[580]  On the other hand, circumst=
ances may arise in=20

which the existence or not of an injury is a fact of great importance to th=
e prosecution. Among=20

other specimens in the Army Medical Museum at Washington, the bones of the =
forearm of Wirtz,=20

executed for inhuman treatment of prisoners during the Civil War, show no r=
emains or trace of=20

fracture; yet it was claimed in defence at the trial that he could not have=
 been guilty of the=20

atrocities attributed to him, for the reason that this arm was disabled fro=
m a fracture.  _Disease of=20

the bones_, whether hereditary or acquired, is an essential descriptive ele=
ment in reconstituting=20

individuality. Caries and necrosis, rickets, spinal disease,=20


_
much murmuring against the count, but no redress could be obtained.=20
