philodendron monstera  There was a heavy fall, a groan of pain, as the gambler dropped over on the floor; then for the space of a few seconds all was the wildest confusion throughout the mammoth saloon.  Revolvers were in every hand, knives boy."

"Hello!" gasped Redburn, quailing under the gaze of a cold steel tube--"what's the row, now?" 

"Draw your revolver!" commanded Harris, sternly, having an eye on the card-sharp at the same 

time, "Come! don't be all night about it!"  Redburn obeyed; he had no other choice.  "Cock it and 

cover your man!"  "Who do you mean?"  "The cuss under my left-hand aim."  Again the "pilgrim" 

felt that he could not afford to do otherwise than obey.  So he took "squint" at the gambler's left 

breast after which Harris withdrew the siege of his left weapon, although he still covered the young 

Easterner, the same. Quietly he moved around to where the card-sharp sat, white and trembling. 

"Gentlemen!" he yelled, in a clear, ringing voice, "will some of you step this way a moment?"  A 

crowd gathered around in a moment: then the youth resumed:  "Feller-citizens, all of you know 

how to play cards, no doubt. What is the penalty of cheating, out here in the Hills?"  For a few 

seconds the room was wrapt in silence; then a chorus of voices gave answer, using a single word: 

"Death!"  "Exactly," said Harris, calmly. "When a sharp hides cards in Chinaman fashion up his 

sleeve, I reckon that's what you call cheatin', don't you?"  "That's the size of it," assented each 

bystander, grimly.  Ned Harris pressed his pistol-muzzle against the gambler's forehead, inserted 

his fingers in each of the capacious sleeves, and a moment later laid several high cards upon the 

table.  A murmur of incredulity went through the crowd of spectators. Even "pilgrim" Redburn was 

astonished.  After removing the cards, Ned Harris turned and leveled his revolver at the head of 

the young man from the East.  "Your name?" he said, briefly, "is--"  "Harry Redburn."  "Very well. 

Harry Redburn, that gambler under cover of your pistol is guilty of a crime, punishable in the Black 

Hills by death. As you are his We doctors call it a safety-valve, and it is.  I would much rather," 

concluded the poet, "you would forget all that I have ever written than that you should forget what I 

tell you about having a safety-valve."  "And now do you know," smilingly said the poet, "about the 

Charles River here?" as they returned to his study and stood before the large bay window.  "I love 

this river," he said.  "Yes, I love it," he repeated; "love it in summer or in winter."  And then he was 

quiet for a minute or so.  Edward asked him which of his poems were his favorites.  "Well," he said 

musingly, "I think 'The Chambered Nautilus' is my most finished piece of work, and I suppose it is 

my favorite.  But there are also 'The Voiceless,' 'My Aviary,' written at this window, 'The Battle of 

Bunker Hill,' and 'Dorothy Q,' written to the portrait of my great-grandmother which you see on the 

wall there.  All these I have a liking for, and when I speak of the poems I like best there are two 

others that ought to be included--'The Silent Melody' and 'The Last Leaf.'  I think these are among 

my best."'  "What is the history of 'The Chambered Nautilus'?" Edward asked.  "It has none," came 

the reply, "it wrote itself.  So, too, did 'The One-Hoss Shay.'  That was one of those random 

conceptions that gallop through the brain, and that you catch by the bridle.  I caught it and reined 

it.  That is all."  Just then a maid brought in a parcel, and as Doctor Holmes opened it on his desk 

he smiled over at the boy and said:  "Well, I declare, if you haven't come just at the right time.  See 

those little books?  Aren't they wee?" and he handed the boy a set of three little books, six inches 

by four in size, beautifully bound in half levant.  They were his "Autocrat" in one volume, and his 

better-known poems in two volumes.  "This is a little fancy of mine," he said.  "My publishers, to 

please me,

straight and rid your country of an A No. 1 dead-beat and swindler!"  "Oh! no!" gasped Redburn, 

horrified at the thought of taking the life of a fellow-creature--"I cannot, I cannot!"  "You _can!_" 

said Harris, sternly; "go on--_you must salt that card-sharp, or I'll certainly salt you!_"  A deathlike 

silence followed.  "_One!_" said Harris, after a moment.  Redburn grew very pale, but not paler 

was he than the card-sharp just opposite. Redburn was no coward; neither was he accustomed to 

the desperate character of the population of the Hills. Should he shoot the little sets, "they have 

sent me six sets.  Are they not exquisite little things?" and he fondled them with loving glee. 

"Lucky, too, for me that they should happen to come now, for I have been wondering what I could 

give you as a souvenir of your visit to me, and here it is, sure enough!  My publishers must have 

guessed you were here and my mind at the same time.  Now, if you would like it, you shall carry 

home one of these little sets, and I'll just write a piece from one of my poems and your name on 

the fly-leaf of each volume.  You say you like that little

himself a murderer. On the contrary, in the natural laws of Deadwood, such a murder would be 

classed justice.  "_Two!_" said Ned Harris, drawing his pistol-hammer back to full cock. "Come, 

pilgrim, are you going to shoot?"  Another silence; only the low breathing of the spectators could 

be heard.  "_Three!_"  Redburn raised his pistol and fired--blindly and carelessly, not knowing or 

caring whither went the    "'A few can touch the magic string.'  "Then I'll write those four lines in this 

volume."  And he did.    "A few can touch the magic string,     And noisy Fame is proud to win 

them,--   Alas for those who never sing,     But die with all their music in them!"                OLIVER 

WENDELL HOLMES.  As each little volume went under the poet's pen Edward said, as his heart 

swelled in gratitude:  "Doctor Holmes,
