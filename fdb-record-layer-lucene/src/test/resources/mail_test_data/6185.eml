ossession of old Jed;=20

much of a start, and although the finish was close, the so-called Whirlwind=

bell braced himself=20

firmly and jerked back on the reins so roughly that the horse was brought t=
o a sliding stop.  "You=20

win," he yelled to Bassett. "I'll buy the dinner."  Attracted by the commot=
ion, Teeny-bits had thrust=20

up the window of his room, and old Daniel Holbrook had joined him in lookin=
g down upon the=20

scene. At first the station master had laughed a little and said:  "Some of=
 your friends seem to be=20

playing a few pranks on me."  But when he heard the noise of the whip and s=
aw the horse jump=20

with fright and pain, his expression had changed and he had started down to=
 the campus. Teeny-

bits followed close behind him; they had reached the steps of Gannett Hall =
when the spectacular=20

finish of the race occurred. Tracey Campbell, seeing the owner of the horse=
, leaped out of the=20

buggy and said facetiously:  "I just borrowed Some advocates of irregular s=
ystems of temperament=20

have, indeed, maintained this irregularity to be a positive advantage, as g=
iving variety of character=20

to the different keys. But this variety of character is obviously neither m=
ore nor less than that of=20

greater and less degrees of dissonance. Now, what performer on a perfect in=
strument ever struck=20

his intervals false, for the sake of variety? Who was ever gratified by the=
 variety produced in vocal=20

music by a voice slightly out of tune? If this be absurd, when applied to i=
nstruments capable of=20

perfect harmony, it is scarcely less so to urge variety of character as bei=
ng of itself a sufficient=20

emperaments will have=20

nearly the same effect, compared with the smaller ones, that small temperam=
ents would have,=20

when compared with the perfect harmony of voices and perfect instruments. P=
ossibly a discordant=20

interval, or a concord largely tempered, might, in a few instances, add to =
the resources of the=20

composer. But when an instrument is once tuned, the situation of these inte=
rvals is fixed beyond=20

st perfect harmony, it=20

might as often thwart as favour the intended effect.  Since, then, the prop=

use a dumb animal=20

crowd tittered, but most=20

of them were silent. They knew that the station master was right, and they =
were ashamed that=20

when they are considered jointly, that is, as formed into harmonic triads, =
unless, by rendering the=20

concords of the same name unequal in their temperament, the mean temperamen=

could be increased, and that of the IIIds and 3ds proportionally diminished=

Campbell's attitude and manner of speaking carried an open insult; it stirr=

introduction of some inequality among those of the same name. But it is dem=

system of equal=20

semitones, is the least possible. Hence no changes in the Vths can diminish=

temperaments of the IIIds and 3ds.  _Cor._ Hence we derive an important pra=
