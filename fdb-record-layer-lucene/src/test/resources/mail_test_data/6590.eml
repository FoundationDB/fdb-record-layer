the cabin, and it told them to be on their guard, as Dick might now come al=
ong at any moment.=20

Slowly the minutes dragged by, and both were growing impatient, when the fi=
rm tread of "the=20

Prince" was heard swiftly approaching. Quickly the lasso was drawn taut. Di=
ck, not dreaming of=20

the trap, came boldly along, tripped, and went sprawling to the ground. The=
 next instant his=20

enemies were on him, each with a long murderous knife in hand.     CHAPTER =
XV.  TO THE=20

RESCUE!   The suddenness of the onslaught prevented Deadwood Dick from rais=
ing a hand to=20

defend himself, and the two strong men piling their combined weights upon h=
im, had the effect to=20

render him utterly helpless. He would have yelled to apprise his comrades o=
f his fate, but=20

Alexander Filmore, ready for the emergency, quickly thrust a cob of wood in=
to his mouth, and=20

bound it there with strong strings.  The young road-agent was a prisoner.  =
"Hal ha!" leered the=20

elder Filmore, His mother, knowing her son better than did any one else, lo=
oked at him with=20

amazement.  She could not believe that he was serious in his decision to ca=
ter to women's needs=20

when he knew so little about them. His friends, too, were intensely amused,=
 and took no pains to=20

hide their amusement from him.  They knew him to be the very opposite of "a=
 lady's man," and=20

when they were not convulsed with hilarity they were incredulous and marvel=
led.  No man,=20

perhaps, could have been chosen for the position who had a less intimate kn=
owledge of women.=20

Bok had no sister, no women confidantes: he had lived with and for his moth=
er.  She was the only=20

woman he really knew or who really knew him.  His boyhood days had been too=
 full of poverty and=20

struggle to permit him to mingle with the opposite sex. And it is a curious=
 fact that Edward Bok's=20

instinctive attitude toward women was that of avoidance.  He did not dislik=
e women, but it could=20

not be said=20

face--"ha! ha! my young eaglet; so I have you at last, have I? After repeat=
ed efforts to get you in=20

my power, I have at last been rewarded with success, eh? Ha! ha! the terrib=
le scourge of the Black=20

Hills lies here at my feet, mine to do with as I shall see fit."  "Shall we=
 settle him, and leave him=20

lying here, where his gang can find him?" interrupted the younger Filmore, =
who, now that his blood=20

was up, cared little what he did. "You give him one jab, and I will guarant=
ee to finish him with the=20

second!"  "No! no! boy; you are too hasty. Before we silence him, forever, =
we must ascertain, if=20

possible, where the girl is."  "But, he'll never tell us."  "We have that y=
et to find out. It is my opinion=20

that we can bring him to terms, somehow. Take hold, and we will carry him b=
ack to our hole in the=20

hill."  Deadwood Dick was accordingly seized by the neck and heels, and bor=
ne swiftly and silently=20

toward the western side of the gulch, up among the foothills, into the rift=
, where the plotters had=20

lain concealed since their arrival. Here he was placed upon the ground in a=
 sitting posture, and his=20

two enemies crouched on either side of him, like beasts ready to spring upo=
n their prey.  Below in=20

the valley, the Utes had kindled one solitary fire, and this with a starlik=
e gleam of light from the=20

cabin window, was the only sign of life to be seen through the night's blac=
k shroud. The trio in the=20

foothills were evidently quite alone.  Alexander Filmore broke the silence.=
  "Well, my gay=20

Deadwood Dick, Prince of the Road, I suppose you wish to have the matter ov=
er with, as soon as=20

possible"  The road-agent nodded.  "Better let him loose in the jaws," sugg=
ested Filmore the=20

younger; "or how else shall we women, therefore, he knew little; of their n=
eeds less.  Nor had he=20

the slightest desire, even as an editor, to know them better or to seek to =
understand them.  Even=20

at that age, he knew that, as a man, he could not, no matter what effort he=
 might make, and he let=20

it go at that.  What he saw in the position was not the need to know women;=
 he could employ=20

women for that purpose.  He perceived clearly that the editor of a magazine=
 was largely an=20

executive: his was principally the work of direction; of studying currents =
and movements, watching=20

their formation, their tendency, their efficacy if advocated or translated =
into actuality, and then=20

selecting from the horizon those that were for the best interests of the ho=
me.  For a home was=20

something which Edward Bok did understand.  He had always lived in one; had=
 struggled to keep=20

it together, and he knew every inch of the hard road that makes for domesti=
c permanence amid=20

adverse financial conditions.  And at the home he aimed rather than at the =
woman in it.  And with=20

his own limited knowledge of the sex, he needed, and none knew it better th=
an did he, the ablest=20

women he could obtain to help him realize his ideals.  Their personal opini=
ons of him did not=20

matter so long as he could command their best work.  Sooner or later, when =
his purposes were=20

better understood, they might alter those opinions.  For that he could affo=
rd to wait.  But he could=20

not wait to get their work.  By this time the editor had come to see that t=
he power of a magazine=20

might lie more securely behind the printed page than in it.  He had begun t=
o accustom his readers=20

to writing to his editors upon all conceivable problems.  This he decided t=
o encourage.  He=20

employed an=20


_
I'll hold my six against his pulsometer. If he squawks, I'll silence him, s=
ure as there is virtue in=20

powder and ball!"  The elder, after some deliberation, acquiesced, and Dick=
 was placed in=20

possession of his speaking power, while the muzzle of young Filmore's revol=
ver pressed against=20

his breast, warned him to silence and obedience.  "Now," said the elder Fil=
more, "just you keep=20

mum. If you try any trickery, it will only hasten your destruction, which i=
s inevitable!"  Deadwood=20

Dick gave a little laugh.  "You talk as if you were going to do something f=
eminine endeavor, upon=20

the distinct understanding that the most scrupulous attention should be giv=
en to her=20

correspondence: that every letter, no matter how inconsequential, should be=
 answered quickly,=20

fully, and courteously, with the questioner always encouraged to come again=
 if any problem of=20

whatever nature came to her.  He told his editors that ignorance on any que=
stion was a=20

misfortune, not a crime; and he wished their correspondence treated in the =
most courteous and=20

helpful spirit.  Step by step, the editor built up this service behind the=
