 that I should follow him. If, when I overtook  And naught can present so s=
ombre and terrifying an aspect as those phantoms of the air, when mailed wi=
th the lightning and flying with the storm.  Yet, upon the cloud the welfar=
e of the human race is dependent, as much as upon _
opportunities for the commission of crime, in the well-sustained outward sh=
ow of virtue. He was=20

absolutely sure that that fellow Wilson was at the bottom, if not also at t=
he top, of the crime.  The=20

solicitors to the company were instructed to take such steps as they might =
think fit in the case.=20

They consulted me, and I gave it as my decided opinion that the facts were =
as consistent with the=20

innocence of the clerk as with his guilt. This was a view of the matter whi=
ch had not occurred to=20

the solicitors. Lawyers have a kind of second instinct, which always makes =
       And whiten the=20

green plains under.      And then again I dissolve in rain,        And laug=
h as I pass in thunder.       I=20

am the daughter of earth and water,        And the nursling of the sky,    =
  I pass through the pores=20

of the ocean and shores,        I change, but I can not die.      For after=
 the rain, when with never a=20

stain        The pavilion of heaven is bare,      And the winds and sunbeam=
s with their convex=20

gleams,        Build up the blue dome of air,      I silently laugh at my o=
wn cenotaph,        And out of=20

the caverns of rain,      Like=20


_
Of criminal lawyers this is especially true. A regular Old-Bailey practitio=
ner cannot understand a=20

theory of innocence. It would be far more easy to convince any judge or jur=
y of the guiltlessness of=20

an accused man or woman, than it would that able and accomplished gentleman=
 with the hooked=20

nose and guttural voice, who is known as the "thieves' attorney-general," i=
n the City of London.=20

But what does he care about the guilt or innocence of his clients? Literall=
y nothing. Under the=20

genial influence of a fee, he will speak as eloquently (in his own and in s=
ome other person's=20

opinion) and contend as loudly that his client is really guiltless, whether=
 he be so or not. If any=20

thing, as he has often had occasion to say, he likes to have a confession o=
f crime        I arise and=20

unbuild it again.=E2=80=9D   The cloud is well worth Shelley=E2=80=99s admi=
ration; for though it be but a vague=20

oppressive mist when it enwraps, yet afar it assumes either beauty or gloom=
, as its seeming=20

whims may dictate. Few are they who have never paused in silent admiration =
of some beautiful=20

fleecy spirit of the upper deep, changing every instant like the shifting f=
igures of a kaleidoscope, or=20

presenting fantastic likenesses of natural objects, or ever and anon presen=
ting pictures of strange=20

monsters, such as only the superstitious and timid can imagine. Often in ti=
mes past have nations=20

light from the hidden sun, darting through a rift in the clouds,=20

accused, because then he knows that the client is not humbugging him; he re=
lies upon a=20

knowledge of the worst; he is sure that no facts are being concealed from h=
im; and he can tell how=20

far it is safe to carry his objurgations or his cross-examination of witnes=
ses. the destruction of=20

_
solicitors were, it is true, not men of this precise stamp. Still, they had=
 in their professional career=20

seen so very much of the corrupt and evil in mankind, and so very little of=
 the higher traits of=20

human nature, that they were always ready to accept unfavourable hypotheses=
 in explanation of=20

human conduct, and slow to receive opposite theories in their place. They w=
ere hard to convince=20

that Wilson _might_ be innocent of all participation in the robbery. At len=

and accusation of the=20
