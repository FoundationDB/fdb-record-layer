dracaena marginata or wouldn't take bribes, or get gold in any bad way, and so were sometimes hungry and poor while they lived upon earth. And sometimes it has seemed to me," continued Benoni, "that even if I "Until this time to-morrow?"  "No. For if you cheated me, it would be too late to act for another twelve hours. But I will give you till to-morrow noon. You agree to that?"  "I agree." My lips dracaena marginata or wouldn't take bribes, or get gold in any bad way, and so were sometimes hungry and poor while they lived upon earth. And sometimes it has seemed to me," continued Benoni, "that even if I "Until this time to-morrow?"  "No. For if you cheated me, it would be too late to act for another twelve hours. But I will give you till to-morrow noon. You agree to that?"  "I agree." My lips _
even religious differences would entirely break the threefold tie of gratitude, friendship, and blood." 

Benjamin Isaacs paused, knit his dark brows, and pressed his lips tightly together. Benoni thought 

of that which is written, _Brother shall rise up against brother_, and silently thanked God that he 

and his father, at least, had at the same time given themselves to the Lord. Isaacs continued his 

narration; it seemed a relief to him thus to pour out the bitterness of his spirit in words,-- 

"'Reuben,' said I, and held out my hand; he drew back, and looked as if he would as lief have 

grasped a viper. 'Turncoat, dog of a Christian!' he hissed forth, and passed me with a gesture, 

which, had I _not_ been a Christian, would have made me strike him to the pavement, and stamp 

upon him as he lay there!" The dark eyes of Isaacs seemed to flash fire as he said this, and 

intuitively he clenched his thin hand.  "O father, dear, then you'll have your scars to show!" cried 

Benoni. The soft, sweet voice of the boy sounded to Sophy like music after a storm.  "Scars! what 

do you mean?" asked Isaacs.  "Ned Franks said that what we have to suffer for Christ, because 

we are his faithful soldiers, will be to us at last like the scars left by wounds got in battle."  There 

was something soothing in the idea to one who was at the moment smarting from persecution 

borne for righteousness' sake. The furrows on Isaacs' brow smoothed down; he seated himself 

wearily on the chair, and drew his little boy towards him.  "You seem to have a good memory, 

Benoni, for everything done or said by your good friend the sailor, though you were so young 

when we left the village of Colme."  "We had such happy days there," said Benoni; "the happiest 

days in all my life, when you and I lodged in the pretty cottage with old Mr. Meade and dear Persis, 

and every evening Ned Franks came to court her for his wife. He used to take me on his knee, and 

tell me stories, and I think of them now so often,--most of all at night when I can't get to sleep; it 

seems as if they brought those dear old times back again." Benoni, in that gloomy London kitchen, 

could not repress a little sigh. As memory may have recalled to Adam the sights and sounds of 

Eden, so she pictured Maxine. I mean to have you--or I will crush you, and now you know I can. 

Choose."  I sprang up, and looked at him. Perhaps there was murder in my eyes, as for a moment 

there was in my heart, for he exclaimed:  "Tigeress! You would kill me if you could. But that 

doesn't make me love you less. Would du Laurier have you if he knew what you are--as he will 

know soon unless you let me save you? Yet I--I would love you if you were a murderess as well as 

a--spy."  "It is you who are a spy!" I faltered, now all but broken.  "If I am, I haven't spied in vain. 

Not only can I ruin you with du Laurier, and before the world, but I can ruin him utterly and in all 

ways."  "No--no," I gasped. "You cannot. You're boasting. You can do nothing."  "Nothing to-night, 

perhaps. I'm not speaking of to-night. I am giving you time. But to-morrow--or the day after. It's 

much the same to me. At first, when I began to suspect that something had been taken from its 

place, I had no proof. I had to get that, and I did get it--nearly all I wanted. This affair of Dundas 

might have been planned for my advantage. It is perfect. All its complications are just so many 

links in a chain for me. Girard--the man Dundas chose to employ--was the very man I'd sent to 

England; on what errand, do you think? To watch your friend the British Foreign Secretary. He 

followed Dundas to Paris on the bare suspicion that there'd been, communication between the 

two, and he was preparing a report for me when--Dundas called on him."  "What connection can 

Ivor Dundas' coming to Paris have with Raoul du Laurier?" I dared to ask.  "You know best as to 

that."  "They have never met. Both are men of honour, and--"  "Men of honour are tricked by 

women sometimes, and then they have to suffer for being fools, as if they had been villains. Think 



what such a man--a man of honour, as you say--would feel when he found out the woman!"  "A 

woman can be calumniated as well as a man," I said. "You are so unscrupulous you would stoop 

to anything, I know that. Raoul du Laurier has done nothing; I--I have done nothing of which to be 

ashamed. Yet you can lie about us, ruin him perhaps by a plot, as if he were guilty, and--and do 

terrible harm to me."  "I can--without the trouble of lying.

green wooded dell, with the gurgle of the stream and the clack of the mill and the happy voice of 

Persis singing hymns at her grandfather's door.  "And what was it that Franks said about wounds 

and scars?" asked Isaacs.  "You know that Ned Franks had served the queen, and had been in 

more than one battle; yet he told me that he had never so much as received a scratch in fight, and 

that he half envied the fellows that carried away some marks that they'd been in the struggle; for 

that though wounds may be sore at the time, an old soldier or sailor likes afterwards to look at his 

scars. Franks said, that if the bright angels in heaven, who have nothing but peace, happiness, 

and love, could envy us poor mortals anything, it must be the opportunity of giving up something 

and suffering something for the sake of the Lord Jesus, who suffered so much for us. The angels 

may have the harps of gold and the crowns of life, but they can't have the victor's _scars_, for no 

one has ever hated or persecuted them for righteousness' sake. Sometimes," continued the boy, 

nestling closer to his father, and speaking on, because he felt that his simple words were giving 

comfort,--"sometimes I like to think of all the Lord's faithful soldiers marching in glory before him, 

when all their trials and battles are over, and when everything which du Laurier and make up your 

mind to marry me. I always meant to have you. You are the one woman worthy of me."  "You are 

the man most unworthy of any woman. But, give me till to-morrow evening--at this time--to decide. 

Will you promise me that?"  "No, I know what you would do. You would kill yourself. It is what is in 

your mind now. I won't risk losing you. I have waited long enough already. Give me a ring of yours, 

and a written word from you to du Laurier, saying that you find you have made a mistake; and not 

only will I do nothing to injure him, but will guard against the discovery of--you know what. 

Besides, as a matter of course, I'll bring all my influence to bear in keeping your name out of this 

or any other scandal. I can do much, everything indeed, for I admit that it was through me the 

Commissary of Police trapped you with Dundas. I will say that I blundered. I know what to do to 

save you, and I will do it--for my future wife."  "No power on earth could induce me to break with 

Raoul du Laurier in the way you wish," I said. "If--if I am to give him up, I must tell him with my own 

lips, and bid him good-bye. I will do this to-morrow, if you will hold your hand until then."  We 

looked at each other for a long moment in silence. Godensky was trying to read my mind, and to 

make up his accordingly.  "You swear by

got his scar when he was thrown into prison; Daniel, his in the den of lions; the three brave Jews, 

in the burning, fiery furnace. And then there will be the scars of those who have been reviled and 

spoken against and laughed at because they would serve the Lord; scars of those who have lost 

money for  "By the memory of my father and mother, martyred by bureaucrats like you, I pledge 

my word that--that--if I can't break with Raoul, to let you know the first thing in the morning, and 

dare you to do--what you will."  "You will not 'dare' me, I think. And because I think so, I will wait--a 

little longer."
