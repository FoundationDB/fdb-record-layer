ration: THE HOLLAND DYKES.]  Holland, the land of windmills, is another reg=
ion which has a continual struggle with this levee question. The native nam=
e of the country, =E2=80=9CNederlands,=E2=80=9D or Netherlands, refers to t=
he character of the region, which lies as an average, _
name of a well-known criminal practitioner, one of the cleverest and one of=
 the most respectable of=20

his class.  The professional man recognised his client. He had before been =
employed as the agent=20

of that client's family solicitor in a prosecution.  Within ten minutes aft=
er the arrival of the lawyer at=20

the station, the door of Mr. Goodwin's cell was opened, and that gentlemen =
with his attorney were=20

shown into the head private apartment of the officer who lives on the premi=
ses. Miss Goodwin was=20

also looked after with as much tenderness during her stay in this urban hos=
telry.  After a short=20

further interview between the attorney and gentleman, and a few words with =
the lady in=20

compulsory waiting, a conference was held between the magistrate, his learn=
ed clerk, and the=20

attorney.  Mr. and Miss Goodwin were then next shown into his worship's pri=
vate room, and the=20

brother and sister were liberated on their own recognisances.  Nothing furt=
her was done in the=20

case against the occupants of the suburban cottage. Nothing was done by tha=
t lady and=20

gentleman against any other person for setting the law in motion against th=
em. The vigilant=20

sergeant got promoted. On what theory and by what influences, let the reade=
r guess. Was it as a=20

reward for past clever and prudent service? Was it the price of perpetual s=
ilence? Was it the seal=20

upon a mystery?  I cannot explain why the sergeant was thus dealt with; but=
 as much of some=20

other things as I can properly explain, I will.  First, let me say that I h=
ad no further interference by=20

the police with my plans for the detection of the real thieves, and that I =
hunted them down to=20

conviction.  In the second place, I may inform the reader that Mr. Goodwin =
was no other than an=20

_alias_ for his Grace the Duke of Nomatterwhere, a nobleman who boasts of a=
 long pedigree, and=20

whose own father was not a little proud of the historic traditions of the h=
ouse of Nomatterwhere.=20

The their beds had formerly been. As soon as this was discovered, the two p=
asses were partially=20

dammed up, and the water thus forced through the South Pass.  It is evident=
, at a glance, that the=20

amount of =E2=80=9Cscour=E2=80=9D will only be as much as will permit ready=
 exit of the water at ordinary stages.=20

The moment that point is reached, the =E2=80=9Cscour=E2=80=9D ceases, and d=
oes not again act unless the river be=20

still further narrowed. Hence, this plan, while increasing facility of navi=
gation, only robs Peter to=20

pay Paul, so far as protection is concerned; for what is gained in depth an=
d speed, is necessarily=20

lost in breadth. The =E2=80=9Cscour=E2=80=9D system has even failed to hold=
 its own, and has had to be reinforced=20

by dredging machines.  This last fact tends to confirm the arguments of the=
 outlet advocates. They=20

urge that the immense amount of silt carried by the river is destructive to=
 the entire scheme.=20

During flood time this silt is nearly equally distributed throughout the wa=
ter. When an overflow=20

occurs, the immense quantity is shown by the vast alluvial deposits left in=
 the submerged region.=20

According to the believers in the anti-levee theory, if overflows are preve=
nted, the earth held in=20

suspension, instead of being deposited where it will enrich the land, will =
gradually sink to the=20

bottom of the river. The result will be that the river-bed will be steadily=
 raised until the surface of=20

the water at ordinary stages will be as high as the present floodmarks. Lev=
ees will have to be built=20

higher and higher, the river will be raised far above the adjacent country,=
 and should a break occur=20

at any point, the consequence will be disastrous in the extreme. As an exam=
ple of the effect of=20

confining a silt-bearing alluvial river to its bed, the Hoang-Ho in China i=
s cited. By constant dyking=20

 country and some of=20

of which goes to Miss Goodwin, who, although not a sister, is in very intim=
ate relationship towards=20

him. He had reasons of his own, I dare say, for the quiet, or, as I should =
say, mysterious manner in=20

which his visits to the cottage in the western suburb were shrouded.     TH=
E ATTORNEY AND=20

THE SMUGGLER.   Tommy Johnson was a smuggler of the modern school, about wh=
ich it is=20

hardly necessary to say more than that it differs considerably from the old=
 or the ideal school.=20

Neither Tommy nor any of his men were the picturesque ruffians that school-=
boy imagination=20

describes, under the tutelary genius of well-known romancists; nor did they=
 much resemble the=20

full-booted, rollicking giants which low art, in common pictures, invariabl=
y makes the bold=20

smuggler.  Tommy, the smuggler chief, was a short, stout, ruddy-faced, good=
-humoured fellow,=20

who lived much as small tradesmen (of whom he was also one) live in that pa=
rt of the south of=20

England to which he belonged. Every body, it is said, liked him, and he lik=
ed every body--except a=20

revenue-officer.  Of Johnson's kith and kindred nobody knew, and few cared =
to inquire, any thing.=20

Whether Tommy was his real name or not, I am uncertain. When on one occasio=
n, being in=20

trouble, he was asked by a local magistrate who his friends (perhaps meanin=
g his relatives) were,=20

jovial Tommy, with a show of distress, replied somewhat as that eccentric c=
hild of the Rev. Mrs.=20

Stowe, Topsy, might have done, "that he 'spected he hadn't got any." There =
was, however, too=20

much modesty or a little untruth in this. Tommy Johnson had hosts of sympat=
hisers, who were=20

prepared at all times to do him any service in their power. Rumour for many=
 miles about his place=20

of abode gave him credit for being what he really was--a smuggler. Tommy fe=
lt it necessary=20

sometimes to vary the compliment, but not always. He never went so far as t=
o repudiate having=20

defrauded the revenue. He was rather pleased to hear folks embody in words =
the popular theory=20

that there was no harm in robbing the Custom House. He did not care to hide=
 from some people=20

that he did now and then run a vessel clandestinely between a Dutch port an=
d some mysterious=20

point off a craggy side of the Isle of Wight. He, however, usually preferre=
d to be known as a man=20

who had once been in, but now retired from, that business.  Tommy, who was =
an otherwise=20

prosperous man, once determined that he would indeed give up his perilous a=
nd unlawful=20

business or profession.  "My dear," he once observed to his loving wife, on=
 their return from=20

church one Sunday evening, "I'll cut smuggling. I'm thinking it's time I di=
d. We can afford it, you=20

know. This here business, the butcher's shop, pays; the inn at P---- would =
honestly pay of itself;=20

and the brickfield turns out right."  "I wish you would, with all my heart,=
" his wife replied.  "I will. My=20

mind's made up."  "You have said that before, Tommy," observed his sweet pa=
rtner; "but you can't=20

do it. I wish you could. You must be a smuggler. It's the fun of it you lik=
e, as you say, I suppose?"=20

"Well, yes, I will. I've quite made up my mind. When I _do_ really make up =
my mind to any thing,=20

you know, I do it. I'll have just one more run, just _one_ more, and then I=
 drop the game, and stick=20

to the trade on land."  "That's what you said the year before last. Do you =
recollect the time,=20

Tommy?"  Tommy shuddered. He made that promise to himself, and kept it by r=
unning a lugger=20

from a port in the Netherlands to one of his points of concealment here. Th=
e affair turned out a bad=20

one. The coast-guard discovered the arrival of the boat, seized the craft a=
nd its contents, and=20

Tommy Johnson also, and ultimately lodged him in the gaol at break in the d=
ykes during floods.=20

The natural result of the continual raising of the bottom is that where any=
 serious breach occurs, it=20

is simply impossible to repair it. So the great river has changed its chann=
el entirely several times in=20

the past two thousand years. In 1852 it burst through its banks three hundr=
ed and fifty miles from=20



the sea, and cut a new channel through the northern part of the province of=
 Shantung to the Gulf=20

of Pechili, where it emptied nearly two hundred and seventy-five miles nort=
h of its former mouth in=20

the Yellow Sea. The sharp angle at which it turned off is noticeable on the=
 maps. This region being=20

almost unknown to foreigners at that time, no one can say how many thousand=
s or millions of lives=20

were destroyed by =E2=80=9CChina=E2=80=99s Sorrow.=E2=80=9D  But the greate=
st disaster of this sort occurred in 1887, when=20

the heavy fall rains of the northwest provinces swelled the streams, and th=
e Yellow River finally=20

broke its banks at a sharp bend in the Ho-nan province, where the town of C=
heng Chou is=20

situated. Frantic efforts were made to close the gap, but in vain. It rapid=
ly grew to a width of one=20

thousand two hundred yards. Some distance away the yellow torrent turned in=
to the valley of a=20

small stream known as the Luchia, down which it rushed in an easterly direc=
tion, overwhelming=20

everything in its path.  =E2=80=9CTwenty miles from Cheng Chou it encounter=
ed Chungmou, a walled city of=20

the third rank. Its thousands of inhabitants were attending to their usual =
pursuits. There was no=20

telegraph to warn them, and the first intimation of disaster came with the =
muddy torrent that rolled=20

down upon them. Within a short time only the tops of the high walls marked =
where a flourishing=20

city had been. Three hundred villages in the district disappeared utterly, =
and the lands about three=20

hundred other villages were inundated.  =E2=80=9CThe flood turned south fro=
m Chungmou, still keeping to=20

the course of the Luchia, and stretched out in width for thirty miles. This=
 vast body of water was=20

from ten to twenty feet deep. Several miles south of Kaifeng the flood stru=
ck a large river which=20

there joins the Luchia. The result was that the flood rose to a still great=
er height, and pouring into a=20

low-lying and very fertile plain which was densely populated, submerged upw=
ard of one thousand=20

five hundred villages.  =E2=80=9CNot far beyond this locality the flood pas=
sed into the province of Anhui,=20

where it spread very widely. The actual loss of life could not be computed =
accurately, but the=20

lowest intelligent estimate placed it at one million five hundred thousand,=
 and one authority placed=20

it at seven million.=E2=80=9D  The inundated provinces were under water fou=
r months. Two million survivors=20

were left destitute. The mind quails at the appalling magnitude of such a c=
atastrophe.  Such is the=20

warning given by the Yellow River. It is urged that if the Mississippi is h=
eavily leveed, the same=20

results will follow. The Po is another instance. The bed of the stream has =
been raised by dykes=20

until it is higher in many places than the tops of the houses, and such dis=
asters as have befallen=20

the dwellers near the Yellow River of China, have only been avoided because=
 of the fact that the=20

Po is a comparatively diminutive stream. It is said that the same state of =
affairs exists on a smaller=20

scale still on the Tiber. But the opponents of the outlet theory ascribe th=
e China floods to ignorant=20

engineering--a charge that can not be easily made to stick, when it is reme=
mbered that the=20

Chinese have some of the most remarkable specimens of engineering skill in =
existence.  In=20

support of the outlet theory, a number of experienced river captains and pi=
lots assert that the bed=20

of the river has been=20


_
arrival of the assizes.  That the smuggler then had friends was here demons=
trated. The facts were=20

as plain as they could be, but their interpretation or bearing on the quest=
ion of guilt or innocence=20

was left to the jury, who had the law expounded for their guidance with all=
 during the past thirty=20

years; that levees are needed at points where none were years ago, while at=
 the same time there=20

is less water in the channel at those points than formerly. At the time of =
this writing Captain=20

Condon is urging that an outlet be made through Lake Borgne, from=20


_
was acquitted in the teeth of evidence and the strength of a sympathy betwe=
en himself and every=20

man in the jury-box.  Let me, however, return to the last conversation betw=
een Mr. and Mrs.=20

Johnson.  "I would have cut it after that," he said; "but it cost such a si=
ght of money. What with the=20

loss of the ship, and all the rum, brandy, and hollands, and the hard money=
 I paid Lawyer=20

Swelling, we were almost ruined. I couldn't stop then. Neck or nothing, I m=
ust go in again; but now=20

we're on our legs again, thank God! and I'll drop the game after one more s=
lice of luck."  Having=20

made this resolution, Mr. Johnson next day proceeded to execute it. He drew=
 out two good round=20

sums of money from different costs, only asking that if successful, they sh=
all be paid $500,000 for=20

every foot of reduction of the high water level. He asserts that one-fourth=
 of the flood waters can=20

be readily drained off by this means. This Lake Borgne idea, commendable as=
 it appears, has=20

been agitated, more or less, for forty years, without being tried. A noted =
government engineer,=20

Charles Ellet, urged it at the time of the flood of 1853, without avail.  W=
hatever be the result of=20

present deliberations, we must hope that no effort will be spared to thorou=
ghly test the merits of=20

any system agreed upon. But the long deliberations and the slow movements o=
f the governmental=20

committees are vexatious to those most vitally=20


_
fine lugger, "a perfect beauty," as he declared, was soon afterwards bought=
, and she was in due=20

course freighted with liquors on a neighbouring coast.  I happened, not man=
y weeks after this, to=20

be travelling as an outside passenger by the coach from Cowes to Ventnor, i=
n the Isle of Wight,=20

when two revenue-carts, heavily laden, passed us on the road.  "My eyes!" e=
xclaimed my driver;=20

and addressing a man who swayed the whip in the first cart, he inquired, "W=
hose is that lot?"=20

"Tommy Johnson's, we suppose."  "Poor fellow! unlucky again!" sighed the co=
achman.  The last=20

venture that was to crown the honest resolution had, then, failed, and wors=
e had to be=20

encountered.  The repentant prominent Louisianian says: =E2=80=9CIf the gov=
ernment and the people had=20

raised $500,000, placed a larger force, and held that Morganza levee, it wo=
uld have cost less than=20

the mere relief expenditures, to say nothing of the millions of total loss =
of the flood.=E2=80=9D And _Harper=E2=80=99s=20

Weekly_ affirms that =E2=80=9Cin one respect the casual observer is moved t=
o sarcastic reflections. When a=20

flood does come, like the present one, or even one of much less dimensions,=
 the work of the=20

commission is of necessity suspended, and at first sight it seems extremely=
 ridiculous to see=20

engineers waiting for the water to subside before they can place confines m=
any feet below the=20

present surface, which confines are=20
