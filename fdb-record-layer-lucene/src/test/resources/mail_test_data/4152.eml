philodendron monstera longer dull reading to one who cares to look upon the=
 working of a passionate troubled human soul, and who can enter into its tr=
ials and share in the joy of its triumphs.  In the soorahs revealed at Mekk=
a, Mohammad has but one theme--God; and one object--to draw his people away=
 from their idols and bring them to the feet of that God. He tells them of =
Him in glowing language, that comes from the heart's white heat. He points =
to the glories of nature, and tells them these are God's works. With http:/=
