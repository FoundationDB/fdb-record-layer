that the _parting_ may be very far off."  Ned Franks, by whom this tribute of regard from his 

neighbors had been altogether unexpected, was taken by surprise, and looked more confused and 

embarrassed than if he had been receiving a reproof instead of a present.  "No--indeed, sir--I am 

very thankful--grateful to you--to all--but I could not,"--he stammered forth, shrinking from touching 

the proffered purse. "Pray, let the money be returned to the subscribers. I feel, from my heart I 

feel, their great kindness all the same as if I availed myself of it."  "They won't touch it, not a penny 

of it!" exclaimed Nancy, who was standing behind the vicar's chair. "I went round to every one this 

morning. You must take the purse, Ned Franks, if it be but to throw it away!"  John Sands, who 

had a high sense of decorum, looked aghast at his wife thus venturing "to put in her word" in the 

vicar's own study; but the clerk only attempted to stop her by a faintly murmured "My dear!"  "No, 

indeed, I will never throw away money so kindly, so generously given," said Franks. "Pray, sir," he 

continued, addressing Mr. Curtis, "let the contents of the purse go towards repairing the 

almshouses in Wild Rose Hollow. I and my wife have everything that we need, and I think that I 

can answer for Persis that this is the way in which she would best like the money to be spent." 

There was a little murmur through the circle of villagers, in which admiration of the sailor's 

generosity was mingled with something like dissatisfaction at his giving everything away. Nancy 

said, in a very audible whisper, "They could have had their trip to the sea-side." Mrs. Curtis, who 

had hitherto remained a silent though interested spectator, now spoke.  "Perhaps all parties will be 

gratified by a compromise," said the lady; "let half of the contents of the purse be contributed by 

Franks to the object for which he has pleaded and worked so hard, and let him satisfy his friends 

here by using the other half for a little holiday-trip for himself and his wife, when his pupils for a 

time give up their studies for gleaning."  The proposal of the lady gave universal satisfaction, that 

they drink smooth as Oil; but in the Cellars which are unequal, by letting in Heats and Colds, the 

Drink is subject to grow stale and sharp: For this reason it is, that Drink, which is brew'd for a long 

Voyage at Sea, should be perfectly ripe and fine before it is exported, for when it has had sufficient 

time to digest in the Cask, and is rack'd from the Bottom or Lee, it will bear carriage without injury. 

It is farther to be noted, that in proportion to the quantity of Liquor, which is enclosed in one Cask, 

so will it be a longer or a shorter time in ripening. A Vessel which will contain two Hogsheads of 

Beer, will require twice as much time to perfect itself as one of a Hogshead; and from my 

experience I find there should be no Vessel used for strong Beer, which we design to keep, less 

than a Hogshead: for one of that quantity, if it be fit to draw in a Year, has Body enough to support 

it two, or three, or four Years, if it has strength of Malt and Hops in it, as the _Dorseshire_ Beer 

has; and this will bear the Sea very well, as we find every day.  There is one thing more to be 

consider'd in the preservation of Beer; and that is, when once the Vessel is broach'd, we ought to 

have regard to the time in which it will be expended: for if there happens to be a quick Draught for 

it, then it will last good to the very bottom; but if there is likely to be a slow draught, then do not 

draw off quite half, before you bottle it, or else your Beer will grow flat, dead, or sour. This is 

observed very much among the Curious.  One great piece of Oeconomy is the good management 

of Small Beer; for if that is not good, the Drinkers of it will be feeble in Summer-time, and 

incapable of strong Work, and will be very subject to Distempers; and besides, when Drink is not 

good, a great deal will be thrown away. The use of Drink, as well as Meat, is to nourish the Body; 

and the more Labour there is upon any one, the more substantial should be the Dyet. In the time 



of Harvest I have often seen the bad Effects of bad Small Beer among the Workmen; and in great 

Families, where that Article has not been taken care of, the Apothecaries Bills

Franks and his happy wife had quitted the vicar's house, the loud ringing, joyous cheer which 

greeted them from the boys who had been waiting outside went as warm to their hearts as the 

praise of their pastor, and the practical token of the loving esteem of their neighbors.  When the 

sound of cheers had died away, and all the shaking of hands and exchange of words of kindness 

were over at last, Franks and his wife, thankful and happy, turned towards their own home, whilst 

neighbors and boys dispersed to theirs. For several minutes neither husband nor wife spoke a 

word; perhaps each understood too well what was passing in the mind of the other for any words 

to be needful. At length the silence was broken by Ned.  "Persis," he said, with emotion, "I think 

I'm more humbled than exalted by all this kindness, and all this praise. How our friends judge by 

the outside! It is God alone who reads the heart. How little they guess what a struggle with evil 

was going on here," Ned laid his hand on his breast, "and that not forty-eight hours since!"  "God 

gave you the victory," said Persis, softly.  "He helped me in the hour of temptation," said Franks; 

"and when the enemy of souls takes advantage of my weakness, and sends his fire-ships again to 

set this impatient spirit in a blaze, may I be enabled to be watchful and vigilant, and steer my 

onward course in the safe track left by Him who was _meek and lowly in heart_!"  My little story is 

almost ended. I shall not linger over any description of the well-earned holiday-trip, which was 

greatly enjoyed by Franks and his wife. The almshouses in Wild Rose Hollow were put in most 

perfect repair before winter, and each one had a beautiful porch. The work of Ned and his "jovial 

crew" was helped forward by the ready purse of the new baronet. Sir Claudius never forgot that he 

was the minister of the gospel, as well as the lord of the manor.  I will but give a short glimpse of 

the party of village boys gathered would have come to, that would have kept the Servants in 

strength and good health; besides one thing more, which I observed above, good wholesome 

Drink is seldom flung away by Servants, so that the sparing of a little Malt ends in loss to the 

Master. Where there is good Cellaring, therefore, it is adviseable to brew a flock of Small Beer, 

either in this Month or _October_, or in both Months, and to be kept in Hogsheads, if possible: The 

Beer brew'd in _March_ to begin drawing in _October_, and that brew'd in _October_ to begin in 

_March_, for Summer drinking; having this regard to the quantity, that a Family of the same 

number of working Persons, will drink a third more in Summer than in Winter,  If Water happens to 

be of a hard nature, it may be softened by setting it exposed to the Air and Sun, and putting into it 

some Pieces of soft Chalk to infuse; or else when the Water is set on to boil, for pouring upon the 

Malt, put into it a quantity of Bran, which will help a little to soften it.  I shall now mention two or 

three Particulars relating to Malt, which may help those who are unacquainted with brewing: In the 

first place, the general Distinctions, between one Malt and another, is only that one is high dried, 

the other low dried; that which we call high dried, will, by brewing, produce a Liquor of a brown, 

deep Colour; and the other, which is the low dried, will give us a Liquor of a pale Colour. The first 

is dried in such a manner, as may be said rather to be scorch'd than dried, and will promote the 

Gravel and Stone, and is much less nourishing than the low dried, or pale Malt, as they call it; for 

all Corn in the most simple way is the most feeding to the Body. I have experienc'd too, that the 

brown Malt, even tho' it be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the pale Malt, if that be fairly 

brewed. I am told, that a Gentleman in _Northamptonshire_ has dried Malt upon the Leads of a 

House, and has made very good Drink of it: And the

study, but to partake of a substantial feast provided for them by Sir Claudius. The large room was 

richly decked out with wreaths of bay and holly, bunches of mistletoe, and sprigs of laurel. Even 

blind Sophy had helped to form the garlands; for the long-cherished wish of Benoni had been 

gratified at last, and Isaacs had brought him and his adopted sister to spend their Christmas at 

Colme. once proposed to the Publick, will do very well for a small quantity, but 'tis much too 

tedious to be ever rendered profitable; however, any means that can be used to dry Malt without 

parching of it, will certainly contribute to the goodness of the Malt. At the _Greyhound_ at 

_Marlborough_ I have drank of the palest-colour'd Ale I ever saw, and the best tasted, and the 

strongest that I have
