ordered farmsteads, or the richly loaded burghers' houses of the Low Countr=
ies. It has become as=20

thoroughly English as the Keppels and the Bentincks.  [Illustration: LONG-C=

to-day there remains not even a single creature.  All were killed in       =

disappearing. 11.11. A=20

 and I truly believe, nor=20

think I am       deceived, that it is more than fifteen. 15.15. Two ordinar=
y and principal methods=20

have the self-styled Christians,       who have gone there, employed in ext=
irpating these miserable=20

nations       and removing them from the face of the earth.  The one, by co=
lours. At first the=20

marquetry was in reserves or panels, as though the worker were warily picki=
ng his way and timidly=20

mastering the technique. At this period clock-cases were, on account of the=
 small space to be=20

inlaid, very fit subjects for experiment. Doubtless some of the more ambiti=
ous work of the early=20

years of this half-century (1670-1720) was actually produced by Dutch and a=
lso by French=20

workmen settled in this country, and doubtless the clock-cases were largely=
 imported. In either=20

instance this would account for the early adoption of small articles such a=
s clock-cases, after=20

which followed chairs and tables, and finally larger pieces of furniture su=
ch as bureaus, when the=20

cabinet-maker was master of the new art of laying veneer and marquetry, or =
when the public taste=20

had advanced sufficiently to induce him to embark on more elaborate work.  =
It is not easy to lay=20

down any exact rules as to the priority of certain styles of marquetry. Man=
y of them overlap in=20

regard to date. It all depends on the point of view. Huguenot craftsmen or =
Dutch marquetry-

workers could, and possibly did, make in London many such an example as the=
 fine case with=20

panels (illustrated p. 75) containing the movement by James Leicester, in d=
ate 1710, or the other=20

example, in date about 1690 (illustrated p. 237), with the movement by Jose=
ph Knibb, of Oxford,=20

placed in the chapter on provincial makers as a glorious tribute to those g=
reat makers who worked=20

outside the metropolis. In this earlier case of the Knibb clock it will be =
seen that there are only two=20

panels, and they exhibit, in comparison with the James Leicester clock, a f=
iner sense of proportion=20

in relation to the surface to be decorated. It may not unreasonably be adva=
nced, where the nicety=20



of balance is well sustained, that the maker set out to make a clock-case w=
ith the dimensions fully=20

before him as a marquetry-worker and not merely as a mechanical layer of im=
ported panels. There=20

is the suggestion in cut panels that they were not thought out in accord wi=
th the English clock-

case, with its hole showing the pendulum.  Of exceptional interest is the f=
ine clock by J. Windmills.=20

The marquetry case of this clock has been untouched, and its condition, as =
shown by the=20

illustration (p. 77), helps to prove a point. It is clear that the panel of=
 marquetry was not intended=20

by the craftsman who=20


_
cruel and tyrannous wars.  The other, by slaying all those, who       might=
 aspire to, or sigh for, or=20

think of liberty, or to escape from       the torments that they suffer, su=
ch as all the native Lords,=20

and       adult men; for generally, they leave none alive in the wars, exce=
pt       the young men and=20

the women, whom they oppress with the hardest,       most horrible, and rou=
ghest servitude, to=20

which either man or beast,       can ever be put.   To these two ways of in=
fernal tyranny, all the=20

many and divers other ways, which are disturbance caused by this unexpected=
 innovation. The=20

enlarged hood shows the broken frieze, an accident frequently attending old=
 examples. But the=20

frame in hood around glass has been laid in marquetry by a coarser hand in =
an attempt to be in=20

keeping with the panel of the door in case below. The somewhat clumsy joine=
ry of the door frame,=20

shown clearer in the enlargement, indicates the amalgamation of the English=
 case-maker and the=20

more finished marquetry-panel worker.  [Illustration: LONG-CASE CLOCK.  Mak=
